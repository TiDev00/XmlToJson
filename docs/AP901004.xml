   The United States and the Soviet Union have
agreed to extend a military exchange program to help eliminate the
``atmosphere of suspicion and mistrust'' between the two countries,
a Soviet official said Thursday.
   Gen. Mikhail Moiseyev, Soviet first deputy minister of defense,
and his American counterpart, Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, announced the agreement, signed earlier this
week.
   It extends a program of goodwill exchanges between the two
superpowers until 1992. The previous agreement, which included
visits by U.S. and Soviet navy ships to Vladivostok and San Diego,
respectively, expires this year.
   ``The plan include a wide range of military exchanges,'' said
Moiseyev, speaking through an interpreter. ``I do hope that the
result of that mutual exchange program will give us the possibility
to get to know each other much better. And of course we do plan to
carry on the military exchanges which will be instrumental in
eliminating the atmosphere of suspicion and mistrust.''
   Powell said improved relations between the former Cold War
rivals had already opened new avenues of trust.
   ``Obviously we both protect that information which we believe is
classified (and) is essential to our national security,'' Powell
said. ``What is impressive is the degree of openness that now
exists where we can share information with each other that a year
or two ago we never would have thought of sharing.''
   The two generals made their remarks following a tour of two U.S.
Navy vessels, including a nuclear-powered attack class submarine,
at the North Island Naval Air Station in San Diego.
   Moiseyev, who is on a five-day tour of the United States, is
expected to travel to Washington on Friday with Powell to hold a
joint news conference.
   The Soviet general said he was pleased with the welcome he had
received at American military bases.
   ``I was especially deeply impressed by the degree of openness,
by the degree of unlimited and open desire to tell us, the members
of the military delegation, about their military hardware,''
Moiseyev said of his American hosts.

   A former police lieutenant who
criticized riot squad officers for acting like ``wild dogs'' has
been rejected for reinstatement on the force, according to news
reports.
   Gregory Rockman became a folk hero in some black areas last year
when he publicly accused fellow officers of beating and whipping
protesters in the mixed-race township of Mitchell's Plain near Cape
Town.
   The independent South African Press Association on Thursday
quoted a spokesman for Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok as
saying Rockman's application for reinstatement was denied.
   Rockman, who is of mixed-raced, was suspended and later
dismissed from the force for refusing a transfer to a border post.

<HEAD>The Power of Suggestion: Fewer Painkillers Needed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A study published today found that patients who
listened to soothing tapes during surgery required less pain relief
during recovery.
   Fifty-seven women undergoing hysterectomies at two hospitals in
Glasgow, Scotland, wore personal stereos into the operating room,
researchers reported in the current edition of the British Medical
Journal.
   Half of the women were played blank tapes and the others
listened to positive statements during the operation.
   Doctors found that the women who listened to the tape playing
soothing remarks - including ``Everything is going very well, we're
very pleased with your progress,'' and ``Any pain that you feel
after the operation will not concern you'' - used 23 percent less
morphine while recovering than those who were played blank tapes.
   The women were connected to a system that allowed them to
administer the amount of morphine they wanted.
   The report said none of the patients could recall hearing any
sounds during surgery.
   Dr. Phil Richardson, who has conducted three similar studies at
London's St. Thomas' Hospital, said he agreed with the report's
recommendation that more patients should be played tapes with
positive messages during surgery.
   Richardson's studies have shown that patients who were played
such tapes during surgery left the hospital sooner and had fewer
unpleasant side effects than those who were played blank tapes.

   The sale of $7.3 billion in new weaponry to
Saudi Arabia is just one step in creating a Persian Gulf
``coalition defense'' against the long-term threat posed by Iraq,
say two senior Bush administration officials.
   That sale will be followed by more sales next year to the
Saudis, perhaps to their neighbors Bahrain and the United Arab
Emirates, and new military help for Israel, Undersecretary of
Defense Paul Wolfowitz and Undersecretary of State Reginald
Bartholomew told Congress on Wednesday.
   In doing so, the United States hopes ``to build a Saudi and a
gulf force capability that will, in effect, drive up significantly
the costs to anybody looking to take a whack at them,'' Bartholomew
said.
   ``We do not want to leave the road to Bahrain open, as it was on
the second of August,'' the day Iraq invaded Kuwait, he told a
hearing of two House Foreign Affairs subcommittees.
   President Bush has asked Congress for permission to sell $7.3
billion worth of weapons, including tanks, attack helicopters and
anti-missile defenses, to Saudi Arabia.
   The two officials said the weapons would help the Saudis present
a more credible deterrent to aggression from Iraq or elsewhere, and
would permit them if attacked to resist long enough to allow
reinforcements from friendly countries to arrive.
   They noted that past U.S. military sales to the Saudis, some $50
billion over the past four decades, helped build many of the
facilities that now are supporting Operation Desert Shield, the
American-led international troop deployment in that country.
   ``Some have said that once Desert Shield is over Iraq will no
longer be a threat because the U.S. and allied forces will have
destroyed the Iraqi military,'' Wolfowitz said. ``We cannot count
on that. ... No outcome is likely to permanently eliminate Iraq as
a regional power.''
   U.S. strategy is based on a principle of ``coalition defense,''
Wolfowitz said. He said that includes strengthening the ability of
gulf nations to defend themselves, encouraging defense cooperation
among countries in the region and making it easier for them to
receive reinforcements from allies.
   The sale of 150 advanced M1A2 tanks is particularly important,
Wolfowitz said, noting that U.S. strategists were particularly
afraid of Iraqi tanks in the early days of the military deployment.
   ``We had severe concerns about the ability of Iraqi armor to
penetrate rather quickly,'' he said. ``We didn't have anything on
the ground to stop Iraqi tanks. We don't want to ever be in the
position of saying that again.''
   The officials asked that Congress quickly approve the newest
sale to Saudi Arabia. They said additional sales to Riyadh, as well
as to the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, would be proposed early
next year.
   Next year's Saudi package will include F-15 fighter planes,
additional Patriot anti-missile batteries and more tanks and
anti-armor weapons, Bartholomew said. The administration also is
considering requests from Bahrain for Apache attack helicopters and
multiple-launch rocket systems, and from the United Arab Emirates
for Apaches, he said.
   Responding to concerns from supporters of Israel, Wolfowitz
noted the administration is prepared to quickly transfer two
Patriot batteries from current U.S. stocks and is looking at
additional ways to aid Israel militarily.
   Asked by Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., whether it is U.S. policy to
retaliate against Iraq immediately if it attacks Israel,
Bartholomew said: ``I don't have any reason to open that up to
question.''
   Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., raised the possibility that weapons
sold to Saudi Arabia could fall into enemy hands if its current
government ever falls, and cited similar past occurrences in Iran
and Kuwait.
   Bartholomew acknowledged that some U.S. weapons that had been
sold to Kuwait now are in the hands of Iraqi forces, including a
number of improved Hawk antiaircraft missiles, TOW anti-tank
missiles, self-propelled 155-millimeter howitzers and ammunition,
and about 16 A-4 attack aircraft.

   It wasn't the message but a word President
Bush used that elevated eyebrows after his television speech on the
deficit the other night.
   There he was in about the most solemn setting at a president's
command - a prime-time Oval Office address, only the fourth of
Bush's presidency - and he used a phrase more appropriate to a
bumper sticker.
   ``And now let me tell you what this agreement will not do,'' the
president said. ``It will not raise income tax rates, personal or
corporate. It will not mess with Social Security in any way.''
   ``... will not mess with ...''
   Brilliant choice of words, said Ken Khachigian, a San Clemente,
Calif., lawyer who used to write Oval Office speeches for Richard
Nixon and Ronald Reagan. ``That's the conversational Bush,'' he
said. ``That's one of the reasons he is doing so well.''
   No, ``mess'' was a bad choice, said a student of language,
William Lutz of Rutgers University, chairman of the Committee on
Public Doublespeak of the National Council of Teachers of English.
   ``The language does not flow from the man. It strikes our ear as
artificial,'' said Lutz. ``In a matter of such grave seriousness
and in a formal address by a president, people look for more formal
language. A more elevated tone would have been more appropriate.''
   If nothing else, the issue shows the importance that can be
attached to every presidential word, especially those uttered in
formal settings.
   Robin Lakoff, professor of linguistics at the University of
California at Berkeley, thought Bush's choice of ``mess'' was
``very characteristic of Bush. He's trying to be a regular guy.''
   ``American people like to see their presidents as populists,''
said Ms. Lakoff, author of ``Talking Power: The Politics of
Language in Our Lives.''
   ``Bush is by birth an aristocrat,'' she said. ``So he has to
spend a whole lot of his energy proving that he isn't.
   ``He used `mess' as though saying, `See, I empathize with
you,''' she said. ``I think it is too manipulative to work. It
doesn't work for me. On the other hand, he has an 80 percent
popularity rating.''
   Ms. Lakoff also commented on another phrase in the same speech.
Bush said, ``It is the best agreement that can be legislated now.''
   That's an insiders' use of ``legislated.'' Usually, legislators
legislate.
   Ms. Lakoff said Bush was expressing authority by choosing that
buzzword.
   ```Mess' says, `I talk your language, I'm one of you,''' she
said. ```Legislated' says `I understand complicated issues. I am at
the hub of where things happen. So you can trust me as an
authority.' They're two ways of appealing for trust.''
   Fred Mish, the dictionary man, comes down on Bush's side.
   ``It's a little offbeat,'' said Mish, editorial director of
Merriam-Webster, Inc. of Springfield, Mass., speaking of Bush's use
of ``legislated,'' He added: ``What he means seems clear enough.''
   As for ``mess,'' thus spake Mish: ``It's sort of an informal
word in a fairly formal context. It's quite intentional, and
possibly effective.
   ``If Franklin Roosevelt had said it, it would have been almost
unbelievable. But the nature of public discourse has changed in the
last 50 years.''

   When Grace Kelly married Monaco's
prince, they seemed like lovers favored by the stars in an old
romantic tale. Now, the oyal family is starting to seem as
star-crossed as players in an ancient tragedy.
   The death Wednesday of Princess Caroline's husband, Stefano
Casiraghi, in a speedboat crash added to the pain of a family
troubled by marital problems and the death of Princess Grace eight
years ago.
   Grace Kelly, a beautiful American film star, married a dashing
Prince Rainier in a civil ceremony on April 18, 1956, after a
courtship in his tiny Riviera realm.
   Miss Kelly, who came from a blueblood Philadelphia family,
became Her Serene Highness Princess Grace. She gave up filmmaking
and bore three children, Caroline, Albert and Stephanie.
   The couple looked down on their debt-free, tax-free, fully
employed realm from the royal palace atop ``Le Rocher'' - the rock
- which dominates the Bay of Monaco.
   The years passed smoothly, although some gossips whispered that
Princess Grace grew bored with palace life and spent too much time
visiting Paris.
   But the general sentiment was reflected in the words of a
journalist who wrote on the occasion of the couple's silver wedding
anniversary in 1981: ``They have been living happily ever after.''
   The sky fell a year later.
   On Sept. 13, 1982, Grace and Stephanie were traveling a winding
road from the family's summer residence near La Turbie, France, in
the hills overlooking Monaco.
   The automobile failed to negotiate a hairpin turn and tumbled
down a ravine. Grace, 52, died of a stroke a day later. Stephanie
suffered neck injuries and deep emotional stress.
   The Royal Palace has steadfastly maintained that Grace drove the
car, although persistent rumors put Stephanie behind the wheel. At
the time, Stephanie was 17, a year too young to drive legally.
   Grace's death plunged the principality into mourning. A
distraught Rainier seldom appeared in public for the next four
years and was said to spend most of his time alone.
   Stephanie became the family's wild child, posing nude for a
photographer, dancing through the night at discotheques and
modeling swimsuits.
   She has been linked romantically to race driver Alain Prost,
actor Rob Lowe, actor Jean-Paul Belmondo's son Paul, actor Alain
Delon's son Anthony and the scion of another troubled clan, John F.
Kennedy Jr.
   All that was to end when she became engaged to property
developer Jean-Yves Le Fur in April. But the wedding, announced for
June, never came off. No public reason was ever given.
   Brother Albert, the heir to the throne, strikes a sober
contrast. The 32-year-old has worked in business and law and
represented the nation on the bobsled team in the 1988 Winter
Olympics in Calgary.
   Caroline, 33, has had troubles beyond the loss of her mother and
husband.
   As the oldest child, she attracted enormous attention from
celebrity-watchers when she came into adulthood in the 1970s.
   In 1978, Caroline married French playboy Philippe Junot, a man
17 years her senior. She later said she married him to rebel
against her mother, who challenged her to marry Junot or dump him.
   ``And I think he married just because it was another lark,'' she
told Le Figaro Magazine. ``It was as stupid as that.''
   The union ended two years later, after several press photos
showed him in the company of other women.
   Caroline dated Roberto Rossellini and tennis star Guillermo
Vilas before marrying Casiraghi, an Italian financier, in 1983.
   The couple led a relatively low-profile lifestyle and had three
children, Andrea, Charlotte and Pierre.
   A practicing Roman Catholic, Caroline unsuccessfully sought a
Vatican annulment of her first marriage so her children could be
recognized by the Church.
   A year after their marriage, Casiraghi developed a passin for
the dangerous sport of offshore boat racing, in which speeds often
exceed 125 mph.
   Casiraghi won the 1989 world championships and was defending his
title Wednesday when his boat struck a wave and flipped, killing
him instantly.
   One of his friends, Italian journalist Franco Bartolini, said
Casiraghi planned to quit the speedboat circuit after this race.
   ``He was going too fast,'' Bartolini told reporters. ``I think
he wanted to go all out, one last time, at his place, at Monaco.''

   As Carl Gillis sees it, President Bush has a
problem with hard-line anti-tax people in rural Georgia. ``He done
told us one time he wasn't going to tax. I think in the backside of
their minds there may be a little backlash.''
   Not that Gillis is against the president. He's a Republican
National committeeman from Georgia.
   But the people he's talking to, ``the vocal ones,'' are strongly
opposed to the budget compromise Bush is trying to sell to the
country and Congress.
   In Massachusetts, where a full-blown tax revolt is under way,
the compromise also gets a negative reception, according to
Republican Party chairman Ray Shamie.
   ``People don't blame the president,'' said Shamie. ``They blame
Congress.''
   As the House moved toward a vote on the outlines of the package
of tax increases and spending cuts, there was a strong sense of
bipartisan political nervousness around the country.
   Clearly the most nervous are those in tough political races.
   ``If you're a marginal member (of Congress), this is a
disaster,'' said Democratic pollster Celinda Lake. She described
the electorate as a ``very, very crabby and unhappy set of
voters.''
   She said Democrats are ``in a very hard place and conservative
Republicans are making it harder for Democrats.''
   Conservatives like House GOP Whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia were
quick to break with the Republican president on the budget
compromises. Equally swift in putting distance between themselves
and the package were GOP candidates.
   Reps. Tom Tauke of Iowa, Claudine Schneider of Rhode Island,
Lynn Martin of Illinois, and Bill Schuette of Michigan were among
the first to declare their opposition to the package.
   All are Republicans, all are challenging Democratic senators and
are behind in the polls but remain within striking distance.
   Rep. Pat Saiki, R-Hawaii, was the only GOP Senate challenger in
the House who was not flatly opposed to the compromise. She also
was the only one leading her Democratic opponent, Sen. Daniel
Akaka, in the polls.
   ``I think most Republicans recognize we're in a very difficult
position,'' said Richard Schwarm, chairman of the Iowa Republican
Party. ``Republicans are truly divided over whether this is the
best deal possible. How it falls out politically, I have no way of
knowing.''
   In Iowa, and in neighboring South Dakota and Nebraska, similar
complaints were heard about the proposed increase in the gasoline
tax and the higher premiums for Medicare as well as cuts in farm
programs.
   But there also was a sense that the country needed to stand
behind the president in a difficult time.
   ``My feeling is we have to do something,'' said Norm Riffel, the
Nebraska GOP chairman. ``We have to share in taking care of this
deficit.''
   But candidates were less inclined to be supportive than party
officials.
   Former congressman Hal Daub, challenging Nebraska Democratic
Sen. James Exon, said he was skeptical of the figures included in
the compromise.
   ``They're very false numbers,'' he said. ``They're not
real-world numbers. They have painted far too rosy a scenario.''
   Alabama Republican Bill Cabaniss, challenging Sen. Howell
Heflin, said the plan was ``almost guaranteed to drive our economy
into a recession.''
   The budget compromise often provided an area of agreement
between opposing candidates.
   Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, joined with Tauke in opposition to the
plan, as did the Republican and Democratic candidates battling to
succeed Rep. Bill Frenzel, R-Minn., who is retiring.
   The accord is ``anti-growth, anti-jobs,'' said Republican Jim
Ramstad.
   ``Another example of politics as usual,'' said Democrat Lou
DeMars.
   ``The people I'm talking to in the real world ... don't want tax
increases,'' said Ramstad. ``They are particularly angry with the
gas tax increase.''
   Lake said higher gasoline taxes were ``a key element'' in a
public sense that the economy is rapidly going downhill.
   In a televised appeal for support for the compromise, Bush urged
Americans Tuesday night to call members of Congress.
   The joke, however, said Rep. Pete Geren, D-Texas, is ``they're
all calling their congressmen a whole lot more than yesterday, but
they're all calling to say vote against it.''
   The staff member who answered the telephone in the Washington
office of Gingrich laughed when asked if the office was getting a
lot of calls.
   Gingrich, the No. 2 Republican in the House, was on the budget
negotiating team but opposed the agreement and refused to
participate with the president in announcing the settlement.
   ``At 10 o'clock this morning in our Morrow, Ga., office we had
143 calls against it and 20 for it. And we'd only been open since
nine,'' said the Gingrich aide. She said the Washington office had
received 91 calls against the budget and 22 for it by the same
time.

   President Bush is trying to quell regional
concerns about the $500 billion deficit-reduction plan by arguing
that failure to pass the package will hurt every area of the
country equally.
   ``I'm not sure there won't be any adverse effects by one
provision or another. I am totally sure that failure to get a
deficit deal will adversely affect every region of the country,''
the president said Wednesday.
   Bush, budget director Richard Darman and Treasury Secretary
Nicholas Brady briefed regional journalists in an effort to win
support in the heartland for the package of taxes and spending
cuts.
   Bush defended the proposed 12-cent increase in gasoline taxes,
which would be phased in over two years, against complaints that
people living in the South and West would be hardest hit because
they drive more.
   ``I think when you look around at world prices on gasoline, I
mean, we are still substantially below world markets,'' the
president said. ``So I would simply say that it is a tax that
everybody has to pick up, as I said last night, some share of the
burden.''
   Darman argued that certain tax increases would be offset by an
overall improvement in the nation's financial health.
   The package ``hasn't been designed to try to equalize by
region,'' he said. ``It is also not, in my opinion, something that
discriminates by region in a way that's especially preferential to
one or unfavorable to another.''
   Darman defended the budget negotiators' decision to increase the
tax on home heating oil by 2 cents a gallon, a proposal that is
opposed by New England legislators.
   ``It's legitimate and a legitimate worry,'' he said. ``On the
other hand, you cannot say in the end that a package is balanced
and fair and not have little bits and pieces from almost
everything. And this is one more little bit and piece.''

   Environmentalists are working with singers
Carole King and John Oates to have logging and mining outlawed on
13 million acres of Northwest wilderness.
   The two appeared Wednesday at a news conference to pus a
proposal from the Alliance for the Wild Rockies, based in Missoula,
Mont.
   ``Some environmental groups are like the unpopular kids at a
high school dance who stand around in the corner because no one
wants to dance with them,'' said Oates, from the band Hall &amp; Oates.
   ``I'm here to see if I can't get someone to dance with them,''
he said.
   King said taxpayer money should not be used to drill, build
roads and clear-cut trees in national forests.
   ``If we stopped spending federal money to destroy our public
lands maybe we wouldn't have to raise the taxes that President Bush
talked about this morning,'' she said.
   The alliance wants to ban logging, mining and road-building on
public lands in Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Oregon and Washington.

   FULTON, Mo. (AP) - Former President Reagan will dedicate a
sculpture next month that marks the first anniversary of the Berlin
Wall's demise.
   Reagan will dedicate the sculpture ``Breakthrough'' on Nov. 9 at
Westminster College, where Sir Winston Churchill said in a 1946
speech that ``an iron curtain has descended'' on Europe.
   The sculpture was done by artist Edwina Sandys, Churchill's
granddaughter. It includes eight concrete sections of the wall,
which went up in 1961 to separate Germany and became the physical
embodiment of Churchill's metaphor.
   Ms. Sandys went to East Germany soon after border restrictions
were eased and persuaded the government to donate sections of the
wall.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Mobster-turned-informant Henry Hill has seen
``GoodFellas,'' the movie based on his life, and gives it two
thumbs up for reality.
   ``That movie was 99 percent accurate. That's the way we lived,
that's (the way) we treated our wives, always on the hustle,'' Hill
said in an interview with the syndicated television program
``Inside Edition.''
   Hill, whose story was told by author Nicholas Pileggi in the
book ``Wise Guy,'' took pride in the performance of Academy
Award-winning actor Robert DeNiro.
   ``I spent a lot of time on the phone with DeNiro, coching him
for playing Jimmy the Gent,'' said Hill, who appears on the show
wearing a beard and sunglasses because he is in the witness
protection program.
   Hill says life has changed dramatically since he turned
government witness and slipped into anonymity. He is remarried and
has a new baby.
   ``I can put my head on the pillow and not have to worry about a
phone call in the middle of the night to `come and meet me with a
shovel,' '' said Hill. ``All that craziness, that insanity, is gone
from my life.''
   The interview aired in some markets Wednesday.

   SAVANNAH, Ga. (AP) - Pat DiNizio, lead singer of the rock group
the Smithereens, underwent an emergency appendectomy while on tour.
   As a result, the Smithereens have canceled a show Saturday in
Harrisonburg, Va. But the group plans to resume the tour in a few
days, the band's touring manager, Brendan McCabe, said Wednesday.
   McCabe said the singer began complaining of pains in his side
late Monday after a performance in Savannah. DiNizio was diagnosed
with appendicitis and surgery was performed Tuesday.
   ``He still has a little pain, but he's in good spirits and he's
doing fine,'' said McCabe. ``He just needs a couple of days to
recover.''

   The cost of food, clothing and medical
supplies for American troops in the Mideast is nearing $600 million
as the deployment approaches the two-month mark and begins to
generate lucrative business for Pentagon suppliers.
   In the past week alone, the Pentagon has issued $100 million in
contracts for meals and new, desert-style suits designed to protect
troops from deadly chemical weapons.
   The deployment of 170,000 troops some 7,000 miles from the
United States is a major test for the military's supply operations.
So far, Defense Department officials say they have filled from
existing stocks about90 percent of orders from units deployed to
the Middle East.
   But major orders already are going to suppliers to rebuild
inventories and they will have to do so increasingly as the
deployment drags on.
   Food, clothing and medical supplies are by far the greatest
needs of the still-growing deployment. The need to feed troops sent
so far from home has forced the Pentagon to scrap plans to cut
purchases of the modern-day C-ration, Meals Ready to Eat, or MRE,
and instead spend millions ordering more.
   Suplly depots also are being called on to supply cots to sleep
on, coolers to protect ice from the heat of the Saudi Arabia
desert, circuits, switches and other parts for radios and other
equipment exposed to the harsh conditions and thousands of other
items ranging from nuts and bolts to sunscreen and chigger
repellant.
   At the Defense Industrial Supply Center in Philadelphia, for
example, some $9 million worth of spare parts, from washers and
bearings to heavy-duty cable, are being supplied for the
deployment. Nearly 200 new contracts have been negotiated and 500
others modified because of the buildup, most of them to replenish
stocks, according to center records.
   And the Defense Electronics Supply Center in Dayton, Ohio, has
processed 22,000 orders for goods valued at $6.7 million for the
Mideast buildup, filling 90.5 percent from depot stocks, according
to its records. The center is letting 200 contracts a month to fill
back orders, now totaling 1,600, for supplies earmarked for the
Middle East.
   The biggest crunch is at the support center that handles orders
for food, clothing and medical supplies, which as of Tuesday had
received 47,208 requisitions for $563 million worth of goods
directly related to Desert Shield, the Pentagon's code name for the
Mideast operation.
   Those orders were for $55.8 million in medical supplies, $293
million in food and $214 million in clothing and textiles,
according to records at the Philadelphia center.
   Requested so far by units in and around Saudi Arabia were nearly
40 million meals - 30 million MREs and 7.8 million servings of hot
meals packaged in ready-to-heat trays.
   Just Monday, the Pentagon awarded two new contracts for MREs
worth more than $52 million. The contracts with Southern Packing
Co. of South Carolina and Cincinnati Packaging of Ohio were for
nearly 33 million MREs, the 3,000-calories meals served to troops
when they have no access to hot meals.
   Those companies assemble and box the meals, which on average
cost the government $3.70 apiece. Some of the components are
supplied by the government, others are purchased by the packing
firms from subcontractors.
   Also on order are thousands of new desert uniforms and
protective suits.
   Last Friday the Pentagon exercised an option it had with Isratex
Inc. of West Virginia to provide 294,550 chemical suits, to be made
with desert camouflage fabric. Isratex has supplied the suits to
the military in the past, but in traditional dark green camouflage.
   One the same day it awarded that $18 million contract - roughly
$61 a suit - the Pentagon also signed a $22 million agreement with
Raven Industries of Sioux Falls, S.D., to produce 250,000
desert-style chemical suits. The latter contract pays the
manufacturer $88 a suit.
   Those contracts are for the protective pants and jackets only. A
separate depot is ordering the gas masks and gloves. Details of
those orders were not immediately available.
   The two new contracts for chemical suits are in addition to
orders for 800,000 suits made with three companies from late August
through mid-September. Those contracts were worth a total of $61.7
million.

<HEAD>U.S., Canada Plan Talks Toward Deregulating Air Service</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States and Canada will open
negotiations next year to dismantle barriers to free and open
competition in the skies between the airlines of the two nations.
   Transportation Secretary Samuel K. Skinner said the talks could
result in an unprecedented deregulation of air traffic across
international borders and add up to 2 million passengers a year to
what is already the world's largest aviation market.
   Skinner and Canadian Transport Minister Doug Lewis made the
announcement in a joint statement issued simultaneously in
Washington and Toronto on Wednesday.
   Skinner told reporters that all aspects of air service between
the two nations will be up for discussion when the talks begin in
early 1991.
   Lewis said negotiators will explore the possibility of creating
an ``open regime.''
   The goal: Airlines from each country would be allowed to operate
between any point in one country and any point in the other as well
as between points in the other country.
   Skinner said the possibility of permitting Canadian airlines to
open hubs in the United States and American air carriers to open
hubs in Canada also will be on the table.
   In their statement, Skinner and Lewis noted that the current
aviation agreement between the two countries has remained basically
unchanged since 1974. They said it is now ``out of step with the
transportation needs of Canada and the U.S.''
   ``We want an aviation market in which the flow of goods and
services would be unimpedd by governmental economic regulation,''
the two officials said.
   Skinner noted that the two countries have already deregulated
their domestic airline industries and said that fact should make it
easier to deregulate air service across their common border.
   The United States and Canada signed a free-trade agreement in
1988 and Skinner said that created a totally new economic
atmosphere and the opportunity to expand and deregulate air links.
   ``We will basically take down the barriers that exist,'' he
said.
   About 13 million passengers fly between Canada and the United
States each year, producing annual revenue of more than $2 billion.
   U.S. airlines carry about two-thirds of the scheduled traffic,
about 11 million passengers a year, while almost all of the charter
passengers, about 2 million a year, are carried by Canadian
airlines.
   Skinner said growth of the U.S.-Canadian air market has been
sluggish in recent years because of the restrictions the two
countries impose to limit the numbers of air carriers and flights.
   The National Transportation Policy announced by Skinner earlier
this year calls for improving access to international markets for
U.S. airlines. The transportation secretary said the U.S.-Canada
air negotiations will mark a good first step toward that objective.
   Tom Lydon, a lawyer for the Air Transport Association, the
principal trade group of U.S. airlines, said member carriers
generally support the new negotiations, in part because the present
air service treaty with Canada is ``one of the more restrictive''
of all such international agreements.
   For example, only one airline from each country may operate on
any route, and U.S. carriers would like to serve more cities in
Canada regardless of how many companies are doing so already, he
said.

<TEXT>
   Markus Wolf, the late East Germany's spymaster of
legend, is reported to have fled to the Soviet Union, but his
successor was arrested hours after the two Germanys became one.
   For weeks, officials have been debating what to do with the
spies from East Germany's hard-line Communist regime who routinely
infiltrated West Germany during the Cold War era. Plans for an
amnesty were rejected.
   When unification came on Wednesday, the spies became fair game
for federal prosecutors eager to bring them to justice. East
Germany had about 8,000 spies, but officials say fewer than 50
arrest warrants have been issued.
   Wolf is by far the biggest fish among them.
   An urbane espionage wizard who gained the grudging respect of
his Western foes, Wolf left behind tales of intrigue before
retiring in 1987.
   As the struggling East German Communists sought to hang on to
power last fall, Wolf claimed he wanted to help reform the
government.
   Pro-democracy figures mocked him, citing his role as a central
figure in the Communists' well-maintained spy and secret police
apparatus.
   Since then, Wolf has apparently lived off and on near Moscow,
writing his memoirs in the relatively safe haven there.
   In today's editions, the mass-circulation Bild newspaper of
Hamburg quoted the new Germany's chief prosecutor, Alexander von
Stahl, as saying Wolf was ``probably in the Soviet Union'' right
now.
   Von Stahl told Berlin's RIAS television on Wednesday that he had
received a letter from Wolf.
   ``He wrote to me and said he wanted to avoid arrest,'' Von Stahl
said, adding he still plans to try to apprehend Wolf.
   ARD television also said that Wolf had fled, as had Hans-Joachim
Tiedge, a long-time East German spy in Bonn who fled to East Berlin
in 1985.
   According to Bild, Wolf contacted the federal prosecutor's
office through his lawyer last week, indicating he would turn
himself in expecting to receive clemency.
   One of Wolf's major coups as head of the former East German spy
network was the planting of top agent Guenther Guillaume as a close
aide to then-West German Chancellor Willy Brandt.
   When Guillaume's true identity was revealed in April 1974, an
embarrassed Brandt took full responsibility for the grave security
breach and resigned.
   Wolf was replaced by Werner Grossmann, who was arrested on
Wednesday in the eastern side of Berlin.
   The chief federal prosecutor's spokesman, Hans-Juergen Foerster,
said investigators originally went to Grossmann's home early
Wednesday to arrest him, but he was not home. He was there when
they returned in the afternoon.
   Grossmann was the last spy chief in the now-dissolved East
Germany.

<HEAD>Judge Denies His Published Remarks Prejudiced Bush Case</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The judge considering a federal
conflict-of-interest case against Neil Bush says he didn't
prejudice the case by calling it ``a pain'' because his remarks
didn't favor either side.
   But some legal experts said this week that administrative law
judge Daniel J. Davidson went against professional ethics by
talking to reporters about the case against the president's son.
   In two newspaper interviews published before a public hearing on
regulators' charges against Bush, Davidson called the savings and
loan case ``a pain,'' ``a political football'' and ``one of the
minor ones'' from a legal standpoint.
   Stephen Gillers, a law professor at New York University, called
Davidson's remarks ``ill-advised.''
   ``You don't want the judge to become a player ... the judge is
first of all a neutral,'' Gillers said. Judges shouldn't comment on
cases outside of court because ``the public's confidence in the
process becomes compromised,'' he said.
   ``The usual practice is that judges don't give interviews,''
said Nahum Litt, the chief administrative law judge at the Labor
Department.
   Normally, he said, administrative law judges tell reporters
seeking interviews to call an official spokesman of the federal
agency where the judge works.
   Court judges rarely speak publicly about pending cases.
Administrative law judges, who interpret federal law and
regulations enforced by the agencies for which they work, are
generally expected to follow the same standards as other judges.
   ``I am not infallible,'' Davidson told The Associated Press on
Tuesday.
   He said he may have breached ethical standards by making the
statements to the reporters, but that he spoke to them because
``I'm a nice guy.''
   ``Shame on me for not hanging up'' the telephone, Davidson
joked.
   He said his remarks didn't compromise the case because they
didn't indicate that he leans ``one way or the other.''
   Davidson, who has been an administrative law judge for 22 years,
won't make a binding ruling in the case. He will recommend to the
director of the Office of Thrift Supervision what sanctions, if
any, should be imposed on Bush.
   Bush, 35, an oil and gas developer in Denver, could be barred
from the banking and savings industry.
   He has been accused of conflict of interest in his role as a
director of Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan Association of
Denver, which collapsed in late 1988, several months after Bush
resigned from the thrift. The failure is expected to cost taxpayers
$1 billion.
   The OTS alleges Bush failed to adequately inform fellow
Silverado directors of his business ties with two developers who
eventually defaulted on more than $132 million in Silverado loans.
   ``This one is going to be a pain,'' Davidson told The New York
Times in a story published Sept. 25, the day the Bush hearing began
in Denver. ``It's a political football, and I don't get involved in
politics.''
   A day earlier, in The Denver Post, Davidson was quoted as saying
the case had received public attention only because Bush is a son
of the president and that from a legal standpoint, it is ``one of
the minor ones.''
   OTS spokesman Tom Mason and Bush's attorney, James Nesland,
declined comment on Davidson's statements, as did American Bar
Association spokesman Robert Evans.
   Bush testified last Thursday in a combative three-hour
appearance, insisting that his actions as a Silverado director
involved no conflict.
   Davidson showed a feisty, sometimes humorous style at the
hearing, scolding Bush several times for interrupting the
government attorney and making judgments from the witness stand
that should be made by the judge.
   ``Please don't try to decide what questions are proper,''
Davidson told Bush. ``I'll do that. OK?''
   Davidson, 56, first served as an administrative law judge at the
Interstate Commerce Commission. He now works for the Food and Drug
Administration but has been ``loaned out'' to other federal
agencies.
   The Office of Personnel Management chose Davidson to preside
over the Bush proceeding and his selection was approved by the OTS.
   The model code of judicial conduct for federal administrative
law judges states:
   ``An administrative law judge should abstain from public comment
about a pending or impending proceeding before a judge in any
agency in which the judge serves, and should require similar
abstention on the part of agency personnel subject to the judge's
direction and control.''

   A prominent physicians' organization and the
U.S. surgeon general accuse the tobacco industry of being
irresponsible by ``the unconscionable targeting of women'' in
cigarette advertising.
   ``Tobacco companies must stop encouraging young women to smoke
cigarettes,'' the American College of Obstetricians and
Gynecologists said Wednesday. ``The health of women and of our
future generations demand at least that much consideration.''
   Surgeon General Antonia Novello said at a news conference that
pregnant women who smoke are more likely to have miscarriages,
premature deliveries and low-birthweight babies. Smoking is
responsible for about 4,000 infant deaths in the United States each
year, she said.
   ``Let no woman be deceived,'' Novello said. ``Tobacco is an
addictive and deadly drug. It leaves its sinister mark across the
entire physiological landscape; hypertension, bronchitis, chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease, heart disease and cancer.''
   The Ob-Gyn group said more than 126,000 women die each year from
smoking-related disorders and that smoking causes 75 percent of
lung cancer cases. About 27 percent of American women smoke, it
said.
   ``It is irresponsible for tobacco companies to single out women,
especially educationally or otherwise disadvantaged women, and
encourage them to smoke,'' the organization said in a statement.
   ``Tobacco companies must stop encouraging young women to smoke
cigarettes,'' it said. ``The health of women and of our future
generations demand at least that much consideration.''
   Thomas Lauria of the Tobacco Institute, representing cigarette
manufacturers, said in response: ``We are pointing out it's 1990,
and to segregate women as being incapable of making the same
choices as men about an adult consumer product seems
paternalistic.''
   George Gross, executive vice president for the Magazine
Publishers Association, said magazines support commercial free
speech, ``the advertising of a legal product.''
   Dr. Ezra C. Davidson, president of the physicians' group, said
the most vulnerable women are teen-agers who have limited
understanding of the health risks of smoking.
   ``The magazines they read extol the glamour of cigarette smoking
in the advertising and the advertising revenue very often makes the
magazines reluctant to publish the other side - the side that warns
of miscarriages, low birthweight, stillbirths, lung cancer, heart
attacks and the many other deadly results of the cigarette habit,''
Davidson said.
   Dr. Virginia Ernster of the University of California Medical
School in San Francisco, said tobacco companies have dealt women a
low blow.
   ``Their advertising is fictitious,'' she said. ``It associates
female smoking with images of physical fitness and independence.
   ``The reality of smoking for women is often quite different -
addiction and death,'' she said. ``The ads suggest that women who
smoke are `in control,' but it is actually the women in our society
who have the least going for them in terms of income, education and
jobs who are the most likely to smoke.''

<HEAD>Vitamin A Reduces Deaths Among Malnourished Children</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The childhood death rate in parts of the world
where malnutrition is common can be cut in half by giving underfed
children $2 worth of vitamin A annually, according to a study
released today.
   Doctors who conducted the study in India gave children the same
amount of vitamin A that they would get in a healthy diet, with
dramatic results, according to the study published in the New
England Journal of Medicine.
   The study was conducted by Dr. Laxmi Rahmathullah and colleagues
from Aravind Children's Hospital in Madurai, India. The United
Nations estimates that 20 million to 40 million children have at
least mild vitamin A deficiency, and nearly half of them live in
India.
   In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Gerald T. Keusch of New
England Medical Center called the results ``positive, impressive
and convincing,'' but said the $2 pricetag still might be too high
for impoverished nations.
   ``It is time that the international community did something more
about this than talk,'' he wrote.
   The study was conducted on 15,419 preschool children in southern
India. They were randomly selected to receive vitamins A and E or
vitamin E alone.
   During the one-year study, 125 children died, but the risk of
death among those taking vitamin A was only half that of those who
got vitamin E alone.
   The vitamin A appeared to reduce the risk of dying from diarrhea
or other infections in malnourished children.
   An earlier study conducted in Indonesia reached similar
conclusions.

   Sen. John McCain says he's frustrated with the
slow pace of an investigation of his and four colleagues' efforts
to help political donor Charles H. Keating Jr. when his savings and
loan was failing.
   McCain, an Arizona Republican, was asked to appear beoore the
Senate Ethics Committee today to explain why he joined the four
other senators to intervene with U.S. banking regulators on
Keating's behalf.
   Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, appeared before the committee Wednesday
in a closed session, the first of the five asked to testify.
   Congressional sources, insisting on anonymity, have confirmed
that committee special counsel Robert S. Bennett proposed that the
investigation of McCain and Glenn be dropped.
   Bennett recommended the investigation go forward against
Democratic Sens. Alan Cranston of California, Donald W. Riegle Jr.
of Michigan and Dennis DeConcini of Arizona, the sources said. The
three are expected to meet with the committee individually next
week.
   Glenn met with the Ethics Committee for 2{ hours and said
afterward, ``I survived. I appreciated very much the fact that the
committee would take the time to discuss this whole issue with me,
which we did. There was adequate time to present everything.''
   He would not discuss the substance of the meeting. Committee
Vice Chairman Warren Rudman, R-N.H., said there was no committee
decision in Glenn's case, nor would any action be taken on McCain
today.
   McCain said Wednesday, ``I am frustrated by the lack of progress
and I see no reason for delay now that the special counsel has made
his recommendations.''
   The five senators received a total of $1.3 million for their
campaigns and political causes from Keating and his associates. All
five have said they were trying to ensure that Keating was treated
fairly by regulators. They said their contacts with the regulators
were not motivated by the donations.
   Keating's Irvine, Calif.-based Lincoln Savings and Loan was
taken over by the federal government in May 1989, and its losses
may cost taxpayers more than $2 billion. Keating has been indicted
on state criminal fraud charges in California.
   Bennett submitted his recommendations on Sept. 10 to the
committee, which announced its preliminary investigation on Dec.
22, 1989.
   One Republican congressional source, insisting on anonymity,
said there was concern among Senate GOP members that any failure to
act quickly on Bennett's recommendations would be seen as
``absolutely, totally political.''
   McCain is the only Republican among the five, and if his case
was dropped before the election, only Democratic senators would be
under a Senate ethics investigation for their roles in the savings
and loan crisis.
   This could be a counterpoint to a possible move by Democrats to
make an issue of conflict-of-interest allegations against the
president's son, Neil Bush, for actions he took as a board member
of a failed thrift in Denver.
   Ethics Committee members have declined to comment on any aspect
of the investigation, including their timetable, since receiving
Bennett's report.
   McCain in the past has pointed out that Lincoln's parent
company, American Continental Corp., was based in Phoenix and has
said, ``I did nothing that I wouldn't do for any major employer, or
economic factor, in my state.''
   The Arizona Republican received $112,000 in campaign
contributions from Keating and associates, and said he would return
the money if it was found to have been diverted from Lincoln. More
than a third of the money was donated while McCain was a member of
the House, including contributions that preceded Keating's purchase
of Lincoln.
   In May and June 1989, McCain paid back $13,433 to American
Continental for the cost of nine corporate and charter jet flights
the senator and his family took to the Bahamas in Keating planes
from 1984-86.
   The trips were not disclosed at the time by McCain, then a
member of the House. McCain said his failure to pay for the trips
earlier ``was a serious error. But it doesn't mean I did anything
improper for Charles Keating.''

<HEAD>Another Black Mayor Endorses Campbell For Re-Election</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Note content of 4th graf</NOTE>
<DATELINE>COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The black mayor of the town of Denmark
joined nearly 300 local officials across the state in publicly
endorsing Gov. Carroll Campbell's re-election.
   The endorsement by Mayor Orlando White, who is an independent,
came a day after Democratic opponent Sen. Theo Mitchell held his
latest news conference in which he accused the governor of starting
his political career on racism.
   A list of city and county officials statewide who publicly
support Campbell was released at the news conference. It included
135 mayors, 109 county council members and 50 city council members.
   Mitchell, who is black, said he holds no animosity against the
mayor for endorsing Campbell, but pointed out that White works for
South Carolina State College, which is affected by the governor.
Last week, Mitchell lashed out when Campbell got support from the
Rev. Richard Fisher and five black mayors. Mitchell called them
``house niggers'' and ``Uncle Toms.''
   White said Campbell is very strong in areas such as fiscal
management and has worked hard to bring industrial development into
small towns such as Denmark.
   The governor has made sure funds are distributed evenly in rural
areas, White said. As an example, he cited a $100,000 grant given
about a year ago by Campbell for indoor facilities in Denmark.

<HEAD>Houstonians Parody Williams' Rape Joke in Song</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Houston businessmen have created a parody in
song of Republican gubernatorial candidate Clayton Williams' cowboy
image and a controversial joke he made about rape.
   Donnell Price and Fred Cebrun of Futuristic Enterprises said
Wednesday they hope ``Texas, It's a Cryin' Shame'' will attract
Texas radio listeners before the Nov. 6 election.
   Cebrun sings it to the tune of ``Home on the Range.''
   ``Clayton Williams on the range,'' the refrain begins.
   ``His sense of humor is strange.
   ``His types of jokes
   ``Offend lots of folks.
   ``Texas, it's a cryin' shame.''
   The song specifically addresses a joke Williams made while at
his ranch with reporters in April. Williams compared the rainy
weather to rape, saying, ``if it's inevitable, just relax and enjoy
it.'' He has since apologized for the comment, but initially said
it was intended to be ``campfire humor.''
   ``Clayton, what did you say? No woman enjoys being raped,''
Cebrun sings.
   ``Everybody in the campaign'' of Democrat Ann Richards likes the
song and ``asks for copies, but nobody's been willing to put up the
money for it,'' Price said.

   The son of former Gov. Martha Layne
Collins says he will seek the Democratic nomination for lieutenant
governor, an office his mother held from 1979-83.
   Steve Collins has never held public office before, but he says
he's familiar with the political arena from years of watching and
helping his mother. And she will be his campaign finance manager.
   ``I had a lot of experience in that particular office,'' said
Collins, 29. ``The one where I felt I could go in and hit the
ground running was the lieutenant governor's office.''
   Collins used the same room at the Woodford County Courthouse to

<HEAD>Congress Gives Final Approval to Bill Outlawing Age Discrimination</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House has given final congressional
passage to legislation aimed at reversing the effects of a Supreme
Court decision that allowed employers to limit job benefits for
older workers.
   The House voted 406-17 Wednesday to approve the same version of
legislation passed by the Senate on Sept. 24.
   It now goes to the White House for President Bush's signature.
   The Supreme Court held in a 1989 ruling that employee benefits
were not afforded protection under the Age Discrimination in
Employment Act of 1967.
   The measure puts Congress on record as taking the position that
the high court's decision went against lawmakers' intent when they
passed the landmark age discrimination bill 23 years ago.
   Several lawmakers had been seeking to reverse the effects of the
court ruling more than two years ago in a case pitting June Betts
of Cincinnati against the Employees Retirement System of Ohio.
   At 61, Ms. Betts, a speech pathologist in Hamilton County, Ohio,
was disabled with Alzheimer's disease. She was denied disability
retirement because she was over 60. The ruling denied her an
additional $200 a month.

<HEAD>DEA Seizes More Than $1 Billion in Cash, Assets in Fiscal 1990</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Drug Enforcement Administration seized
more than $1 billion in cash and other assets from drug traffickers
in the fiscal year that ended Sunday, says agency chief Robert C.
Bonner.
   Reaching the $1 billion mark ``shows that DEA has been quite
aggressive in stripping drug traffickers of their ill-gotten gains,
the proceeds of their illegal activities,'' Bonner said.
   The $1.025 billion seized, according to preliminary figures for
fiscal 1990, was far higher than the DEA's budget of $548.7 million
for that year, Bonner said. It represented a 4.4 percent increase
over the $979.1 million in assets seized by the DEA the previous
year.
   But Bonner said in an interview Tuesday that the seizures won't
help defray the federal budget deficit just yet. The assets must
first be forfeited, which can take years.

<HEAD>U.S. Admiral Warns of Attitudes In Philippine Military</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At about the same time Philippine soldiers
began a rebellion on the southern island of Mindanao, a U.S.
admiral was expressing concern to Congress over attitudes within
the country's military.
   Since a coup attempt in December 1989, said Rear Adm. M. A.
McDevitt, it has become apparent that some Philippine officers want
to take roles ``that transcend defense and security.''
   McDevitt, speaking for the Pentagon, testified Wednesday
afternoon before the House Asian affairs subcommittee. He was
joined by committee members and other Bush administration officials
in reiterating warnings that any military overthrow of President
Corazon Aquino would bring an immediate cutoff of all U.S. aid.
   He spoke shortly after mutinous soldiers seized an army base and
the city of Butuan on Mindanao at 1 a.m. local time - noon in
Washington. Military leaders in Manila apparently remained loyal to
the government, however, and said they were taking steps to isolate
the uprising.
   ``A military takeover would only compound, not alleviate,
current problems and frustrations,'' McDevitt said in written
testimony submitted to the committee. ``It would not be, as some
suggest, a short cut to solutions and reforms, but rather a short
cut to disaster.''
   McDevitt summarized his testimony for the hearing and answered
questions from the panel.
   He said there is ``no hard evidence of serious plotting'' among
leading elements of the Philippine military and discounted
speculation in Manila of a possible ``constitutional coup'' in
which top brass would back a bloodless overthrow of Mrs. Aquino.
   Even that kind of overthrow, said McDevitt, would require a
total aid cutoff under U.S. law.
   ``However,'' he said, ``that has not deterred the plotters from
moving twice in the past, and therefore probably would not be a
pivotal factor in any future decision to launch another coup
attempt.''
   McDevitt said soldiers' attempts to influence issues that go
beyond their traditional role ``seem now to be an established
feature of the Philippine political landscape.''
   ``We continue to hope and to emphasize that the military use its
voice wisely and responsibly, and continue to reject radical action
as a short cut to social, economic and military reform,'' he said.
   In other testimony, officials said the Philippines continues to
lag behind in using foreign aid, but problems facing the country
require more rather than less assistance.
   Congress has been cutting President Bush's aid requests to the
country which is struggling to overcome devastation from a strong
earthquake, drought and flooding and has been rocked by the Persian
Gulf crisis's impact on oil prices and overseas Filipino workers'
remittances.
   Carole Adelman, assistant administrator of the Agency for
International Development, said $40 million remains uncommitted
from the first-year U.S. contribution to a multinational aid plan
and the pipeline of unspent aid to the Philippines from all sources
totals about $500 million dollars.
   She said, however, that much of the backlog is understandable
because of the windfall $3.5 billion dollars pledged under the
Multilateral Assistance Initiative, which is in addition to aid
tied to the U.S. bases and other bilateral assistance.

<HEAD>Conservatives Gain in Brazilian Congressional and Gubernatorial
Vote</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TODD LEWAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In what was seen as a vote of
support for President Fernando Collor de Mello, conservatives led
or won most races in nationwide congressional and gubernatorial
elections, exit polls indicated.
   But polls also indicated that about 12 percent of Brazil's 83
million voters cast blank ballots Wednesday to protest Collor's
harsh economic policies and to express a general sentiment that
politicians are not serving the people.
   Final results will not be known for more than a week. However,
exit surveys indicated conservatives had captured at least eight of
27 gubernatorial races and a majority of Senate and House seats.
   The far-right Liberal Front Party, which won only one
governorship in 1985, won in five states on Wednesday. Collor's
tiny National Reconstruction Party made gains across the country,
including the governorship in Collor's home state of Alagoas in
northern Brazil.
   Besides the governorships in all 26 states and the capital
district of Brasilia, all 503 seats in the federal House of
Representatives and 31 of 81 Senate spots were at stake.
   Runoffs will be held Nov. 25 if no gubernatorial candidate
receives 50 percent of the vote. A majority is not required in
other races.
   Voting is mandatory in Brazil and from the southern pampas to
the northern Amazon jungle, voters lined up to cast ballots.
   Troops patrolled many areas to ensure peaceful voting, the first
since December, when Collor became the country's first popularly
elected president since 1960.
   The military gave up power in 1985 after ruling the country by
dictatorship for 19 years.
   Collor cast his ballot before cheering residents in his home
city of Maceio, 1,400 miles northeast of Rio.
   ``We have shown with this election that our democracy is stable
and consolidated,'' the 40-year-old president said.
   Local issues largely prevailed in the election campaigns, but
analysts said the vote was an important indicator of Collor's
popularity.
   There has been growing resentment of his economic austerity
plan, which aims to halt annual inflation of nearly 5,000 percent,
but Brazil's left appeared unable to capitalize on the discontent.
   City streets were littered with pamphlets and streamers when the
polls closed, but the election fervor that marked last year's
presidential vote was absent. In major states, polls showed that
most voters did not even know who the congressional candidates
were.
   ``Politicians show up in the slums the day before the election
and throw a few barbecue parties to get votes, then do nothing for
the next four years,'' said machine operator Joao Alves Filho, 34,
as he stood in a voting line in Rio's middle-class district of Vila
Isabela.
   He said he would cast a blank ballot.
   In Sao Paulo, the top electoral prize with almost 19 million
voters, rightist Paulo Maluf of the Social Democrats - the official
party of the former military regime - led the gubernatorial race
with 42 percent of the vote.
   Leftists won governorships outright in just two states, in Rio
de Janeiro and in the northern state of Ceara, according to exit
polls by the Brazilian Institute of Public Opinion and Statistics.
   The militant socialist Workers Party nearly captured December's
presidential election and had been seen as a growing force in
Brazilian politics. But it faded dramatically in this campaign.
   Only in one gubernatorial race, in the far-western Amazon state
of Acre, was a Workers Party candidate close to the lead and even
there he is expected to face a runoff.
   In remote areas, a number of elderly voters traveled miles by
canoe, mule and horseback to reach regional electoral centers.
Ballot boxes are delivered by mules and the vote count is mainly
done by hand.
   The new congress will meet on Feb. 3, 1991. The winners in the
governor's races take office on March 15.

<TEXT>
   Soldiers mutinied across the northern
coast of the country's second-largest island Thursday in what
appeared the first stage of a new attempt to overthrow President
Corazon Aquino.
   The mutineers on Mindanao, about 500 miles south of Manila,
seized the city of Butuan and also appeared to be in control of
Cagayan de Oro, a major port of about 200,000 people.
   They were led by the former chief of staff of Mrs. Aquino's
guard force, who has been at large since participating in a bloody
December coup attempt.
   Witnesses said rebels were marching around the streets of
Cagayan de Oro in a virtual ``victory parade,'' attracting large
crowds of curiosity seekers.
   The armed forces went on nationwide alert and Mrs. Aquino
gathered with her Cabinet, senior military officers and congressmen
at the presidential palace.
   ``I'm calling once again on the people to rally against these
troublemakers,'' Mrs. Aquino said on the radio. ``The constitution
will be upheld with force when challenged with force.''
   Military Chief of Staff Gen. Renato de Villa said the mutiny
appeared a secessionist move and vowed to do ``whatever is
necessary to prevent any dismemberment of this republic.''
   Officials said about 200 rebels launched the revolt about 1
a.m., seizing the 402nd Brigade army base in Butuan, about 500
miles south of Manila. Flights to Mindanao were canceled and
schools on the island closed.
   The rebels later moved into Cagayan de Oro, 70 miles west of
Butuan.
   Manila radio station DZXL interviewed their leader, renegade
Col. Alexander Noble, at the regional national police headquarters
in Cagayan de Oro.
   ``This shows that the free Mindanao movement is not just
propaganda,'' Noble told reporters at Camp Evangelista.
   In the city of Iligan just west of Cagayan de Oro, loyalist
troops secured government buildings and blocked roads to the nearby
military camp after residents said a rebel helicopter had hovered
overhead and urged troops to join the mutiny. The residents said
government planes chased the helicopter away.
   National Security Adviser Rafael Ileto said that the rebels hope
to establish a secessionist government on Mindanao, then ``move up
north.''
   There have been rumors that a coup attempt was brewing in the
region for nearly six months.
   Military sources said the mutineers were planning to stage
``pocket rebellions'' in remote areas of the country before
striking in the capital.
   Mrs. Aquino has survived six coup attempts since she took office
in February 1986. In the most recent attempt, in December, rebels
seized Manila's financial district in bloody fighting and nearly
toppled the government. More than 100 people were killed.
   Also Thursday, a bomb exploded outside a Manila army base three
hours after the Mindanao base was taken. There were no injuries.
   It was the 35th explosion in the capital since August. Officials
see the bombings as the work of military officers hoping to
destabilize the country.
   De Villa said soldiers from the 53rd Infantry Battalion, one of
the units at the 402nd Brigade, organized the takeover. About 3,000
soldiers are based at the brigade.
   The brigade's commanding officer, Col. Hercules Galon,
apparently escaped the rebel soldiers, said a military spokesman,
Brig. Gen. Emiliano Templo. But later Templo said Galon may have
joined the rebels.
   Templo said the dissidents cut off communication lines from
Butuan, and officials in Manila were relying on commercial radio
stations and the military regional headquarters in Cagayan de Oro.
   De Villa said he called commanding officers of various camps
around the country and was assured of their loyalty.
   ``I think this is small thing and we can control this,'' de
Villa said in a radio interview. ``We wish to inform the public
that the armed forces is united. Except for this breakaway group,
we are in control of all units in Manila and the entire country.''
   Templo said there were no plans to send troops from Luzon, the
main island, to reinforce government forces on Mindanao.
   ``We are guarding against the possibility that this Butuan
incident has a second part in another part of the country that we
are not aware of,'' de Villa said. ``We are just taking
precautions.''
   Rumors of a new coup plot in recent months have suggested that
military dissidents would seize strongpoints in the south to draw
government forces out of Manila, then start a new uprising there.
   The bomb Thursday exploded at a water pumping station at the
Philippine Army headquarters in Manila, de Villa said. There were
no injuries.
   De Villa appealed to the mutineers to surrender.
   ``I just want to tell them that this uprising is a big mistake
and may endanger our civilians,'' de Villa said. ``What they did is
something that cannot be supported by our civilains and the
majority of the armed forces of the Philippines.''
   ``Don't allow our armed forces to be divided. Think it over
because there is still time,'' he said.
   Since August, government troops had been chasing Noble in the
jungles of Agusan del Sur province south of Butuan.
   Noble was involved in the December coup and escaped to Mindanao,
where he organized a private army.

<HEAD>Last Shaker Eldress Dies at 93</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CANTERBURY, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bertha Lindsay, the last eldress of the
Shakers, a celibate religious sect that promoted communal living
and pacifism for more than 200 years, has died. She was 93.
   Lindsay, who died Wednesday, was one of the last members of the
religion that once boasted 6,000 members in 24 communities. One
woman in her 90s remains in Canterbury, once home to 400 Shaker
residents. Fewer than 10 live in Maine. Able to add to their ranks
only by taking in orphans or converts, Shaker spiritual leaders
decided to halt new membership in 1965, but Lindsay often said the
movement's beliefs would not die with the last Shakers.
   ``Mother'' Ann Lee, who brought the religion to the United
States in the 1774, prophesied that ultimately Shakers ``would
diminish to as many as a child could count on one hand, and then
there would be a revival of the spirit,'' Lindsay once said.
   Lindsay, born July 28, 1897, in Braintree, Mass., died nearly 2{
years after Eldress Gertrude Soule, who also lived at Shaker
Village in Canterbury.
   Only 94-year-old Sister Ethel Hudson remains in the New
Hampshire village. A small community in Sabbathday Lake, Maine,
includes five pre-1965 members and at least three admitted
afterward despite the decision by Canterbury leaders.
   The religion originated in England in the 1770s as the Shaking
Quakers and grew under Lee's leadership. She who moved to New York
in 1774 with eight followers. The community in Canterbury was
founded in the 1780s.
   The Shakers, formally the United Society of Believers in
Christ's Second Appearing, gained their nickname from trembling
brought on by religious fervor. They advocated living apart from
society at large in communal villages.
   Everyone was considered equal and Shaker government offered
women leadership roles little known in the 19th and early 20th
centuries. Two eldresses and two elders formed the ministry that
made decisions for the society.
   Lindsay said she believed Lee's prophesy that Shaker beliefs
would gain broader acceptance.
   ``It wouldn't be called Shakers,'' she said. ``They wouldn't
live in communities. But it would be worldwide felt and known. And
we think that is coming to pass.''
   As evidence, Lindsay noted that more visitors come to Shaker
Village every year, including many from Europe. They view exhibits
of the efficient homespun handicrafts and furniture that made
Shakers famous, including creations like the flat broom, clothespin
and ladderback chairs.
   Lindsay came to Canterbury in 1905 as an orphan. Orphans taken
in by the Shakers had to decide at age 21 whether to take a vow of
celibacy and remain in the community or leave.
   ``I had studied the laws and regulations of the church and felt
this was the life for me,'' Lindsay said. ``I could give as much
here as I could anywhere else in the world and could have more
friends, both men and women. If I had gone into the world and
married, I wouldn't have had that. ... It has been a busy, active
life and a wonderful experience.''
   When she turned 90, Lindsay lost her sight and put her energies
into recording her life story and memories of Shaker life.
   ``I want people to know we did have fun and plenty of it,'' she
said.
   Lindsay is survived by a niece. At Lindsay's request, no funeral
will be held, but a memorial service will be held at an unspecified
date.

<HEAD>County Bans Future Prostitution at Defunct Bordello</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM GARDNER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RENO, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prostitution has been banned at Mustang Ranch,
America's best-known legal brothel, by county officials who are
tired of its notoriety.
   The prohibition leaves no room for the Internal Revenue Service
to sell the 105-room, 440-acre ranch as a working bordello when it
goes up for auction to pay the longtime owners' tax debt, estimated
at $13 million.
   The Storey County Commission decided Tuesday to make
prostitution illegal in the area of the county where the Mustang is
located, leaving in the clear a nearby brothel.
   Commissioners stressed they remain in favor of legal
prostitution in Nevada, but rezoned the Mustang because of the
``circus'' surrounding it for 35 years.
   ``It just wouldn't look good for Storey County,'' Commissioner
Karl Larson said.
   The Mustang's owners, Joe and Sally Conforte, had tried
unsuccessfully to sell the ranch. They filed for liquidation Sept.
18 and federal bankruptcy trustees assumed management of the
Mustang.
   The trustees had expected to operate the ranch as a brothel to
pay off creditors, but U.S. Bankruptcy Judge James Thompson said
the only creditor of significance was the IRS, so he turned the
Mustang over to the agency Sept. 21 to dispose of as it wished.
   IRS spokeswoman Norma Lally said Wednesday she did not know
whether the commission action would affect bidding at the auction.
The IRS said it will let the buyer decide what to do with the
property.
   The agency is making an inventory of the brothel and its
contents. The auction is at least one to two months away, Lally
said.
   The County Commission's action gives Conforte's nephew, David
Burgess, a monopoly in the county's brothel business at the Old
Bridge Ranch next to the Mustang.
   Larson said the county would more than double Burgess' $30,000
annual license fee to make up for lost revenue from the Mustang.
   Burgess' wife, Ingrid, manager and co-owner of the Old Bridge
Ranch, said business is booming.
   ``It's been very busy here ever since the Mustang shut down. We
have all the girls over here we can hold,'' she said. ``I think
it's sad a lot of people have lost their jobs. There is nothing
wrong with a little competition.''

   Share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange closed
sharply lower Thursday, and the dollar dropped against the Japanese
yen.
   The dollar finished the day at 135.90 yen, down 0.75 yen from
Wednesday's close. Trading ranged between 135.65 yen and 135.98
yen, after opening at 135.88 yen. It was the lowest opening rate
for the U.S. currency in 14 months.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
fell 571.20 points, or 2.56 percent, to 22,278.19 points. It had
shed 49.04 points on Wednesday after a record surge the previous
day.
   In bond dealings, the yield of the benchmark 10-year government
bond fell to 8.290 percent , down from 8.310 percent on Wednesday.
The price rose to 82.40 yen, up from 82.32 yen on Wednesday.
   Currency traders said the dollar weakened after U.S. Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said Wednesday that the proposed
U.S. budget would ``almost certainly'' depress interest rates.
   Greenspan told a Congressional committee that failure to approve
the budget's $500 billion deficit-reduction package would be a
``grave mistake'' with serious consequences for an already weakened
U.S. economy.
   The market seems to have reached a floor at 135 yen to the
dollar, however, said Hiroyuki Yamaguchi at Commerz Bank A.G.
``There seems to be a lot of buying orders at 135, I think maybe we
will not see 134 for the rest of this week,'' he said.
   The recovery on the stock market, short-covering and pessimism
about lower interest rates in the United States are moving the
dollar-yen exchange, said Masato Hayashi, chief customer dealer for
the Bank of Tokyo.
   ``Every morning we see a much lower level. So every day, at
first, people try to sell. Then there are more buyers, until the
dollar reaches the high from outside (markets). Then the dollar
falls again,'' he said.
   The dollar probably already has hit its high for the day, he
said.
   Stock traders cited higher oil prices and an overnight fall on
the New York stock market as reasons for the falling Nikkei
average.
   ``Basically, I think what we are seeing is a fair amount of
profit taking,'' said Steve Usher of Kleinwort Benson
International, Inc. Tuesday's record surge left people
``confused,'' but the basic sentiment is still depressed because of
poor fundamentals and uncertainty in the externals, he said.

   A blinding dust storm triggered two mass
collisions of cars and big-rig trucks on an interstate highway. One
person died and at least a dozen were injured, authorities said.
   Interstate 82 in southeastern Washington was closed for more
than nine hours Wednesday because of low visibility from dust blown
by wind gusting to more than 33 mph, the Washington State Patrol
said.
   Before it closed, two crashes involving 26 vehicles snarled
lanes in both directions.
   Christina Rivera, 24, of Hermiston, Ore., died in a crash
involving 15 cars and three tractor-trailer rigs on the southbound
side, the state patrol said.
   Another mass collision, involving five cars and three big rigs
was reported in northbound lanes, troopers said.
   At least 12 people were taken to hospitals, the patrol said.
   The interstate reopened before midnight.

   A black record store owner
convicted of obscenity for selling a sexually explicit album by the
black rap group 2 Live Crew says the all-white jury ``doesn't
represent my community.''
   ``It's unfair. The jury was all white. They don't know where E-C
Records is. They don't know a goddamned thing about the ghetto,''
Charles Freeman yelled to reporters after he was convicted
Wednesday.
   Critics of the rap group hailed the verdict as a milestone in
the battle against material they consider obscene. The music
industry and civil libertarians decried it as censorship.
   2 Live Crew and its album ``As Nasty as They Wanna Be'' have
been at the center of a First Amendment dispute since June 6, when
a federal judge deemed obscene lyrics that include references to
sodomy and sexual intercourse. Some also have objected to the
lyrics as violent and degrading to women.
   The jury of five women and one man took only 2{ hours to return
the verdict against Freeman, 31, on a misdemeanor charge. Jurors
later declined to discuss their decision.
   ``It's the first time in musical history that a piece of work
has been found to be obscene,'' said Trish Heimers, spokeswoman for
the Recording Industry Association of America, a Washington-based
trade association for U.S. record companies.
   ``I would most certainly characterize this as censorship,'' she
said.
   Donald Wildmon, founder of the conservative American Family
Association based in Tupelo, Miss., said the conviction is a sign
of a national trend against obscenity and pornography.
   ``There's definitely a shift in attitudes in America about this
kind of trash,'' he said.
   Luther Campbell, leader of 2 Live Crew, said he wasn't surprised
by the verdict.
   ``I had figured that the guy would be found guilty based on the
jury that was chosen,'' Campbell said in a statement. ``The
community standards in the black area and white area are completely
different.''
   Campbell and two other members of the rap group face trial
Tuesday on charges of performing obscene material at a nightclub
show in nearby Hollywood. Broward County Judge Paul Backman set
Freeman's sentencing for Nov. 2. The conviction carries a possible
one-year jail sentence and $1,000 fine.
   Freeman's trial was the first jury test of U.S. District Judge
Jose Gonzalez's ruling that the group's lyrics were obscene.
   The U.S. Supreme Court's legal test for obscenity asks whether
the dominant theme of the work appeals to prurient interest in sex,
whether the work is patently offensive based on contemporary
community standards, and whether the work lacks serious artistic or
political value.
   Gonzalez banned the sale of the album in three south Florida
counties, including Broward County. Shortly after the decision,
sales of the 2-year-old album approached 2 million nationwide.
   Freeman, whose legal expenses are being paid by the American
Civil Liberties Union, was arrested two days after the federal
ruling when he sold the album to undercover police officers at his
Fort Lauderdale store.
   Freeman's attorneys said they would appeal.
   ``It's clear that the jury is not from the (black) community or
familiar with the community that this record comes from,'' said
Bruce Rogow, a lawyer for Freeman. ``This music was like a foreign
country to them.''
   Prosecutors said cultural differences did not influence the
jury's decision.
   ``I don't think race is a factor,'' said Leslie Robson, the lead
prosecutor. ``The jury paid very close attention to the evidence.
They came back with a verdict that spoke the truth.''
   Defense attorneys had objected to the makeup of the 35-member
jury pool, which included only one black, whose name was not picked
when a dozen names were drawn at random as the final group of
prospective jurors.
   The group will not change its music, despite the result of
Freeman's trial and the upcoming trial of three of its members,
said David Hobbs, the group's disc jockey.
   ``We feel that we have to do what we have to do, and that's to
make the same records that we've been making,'' he said. ``That's
it.''

   The source of a suspected salmonella outbreak
among nearly 300 conventioneers remained a mystery today as two
dozen hit hardest by the food poisoning recovered in a hospital.
   Eight-five people attending the annual True Value hardware
stores convention were sickened Wednesday, after a group of 200
reported symptoms Monday, said Mike McCarthy, a spokesman for the
Chicago Health Department.
   ``It would certainly seem to be a salmonella problem,'' he said.
``At this particular time, we have not determined what substance
may have been the agent.''
   Both groups were poisoned by the same tainted food despite the
delay in reactions, McCarthy said.
   ``These people either had original symptoms that declined and
then flared up again, or they did not go for examination or
treatment originally,'' he said.
   Ambulances carried the victims to hospitals Wednesday, said
Randi Killian, spokeswoman for the Mid-America chapter of the
American Red Cross. Twenty-four people were admitted at Grant
Hospital and most were listed in fair condition, spokeswoman Pat
Leck said.
   Health officials inspected the kitchens at the Hyatt
Regency-Chicago, where conventioneers shared a buffet dinner Sunday
night, but no tainted food was found and kitchens were allowed to
remain open.
   Authorities also were checking into a meal served Monday at the
headquarters of True Value's parent firm, Cotter &amp; Co., McCarthy
said.
   Preliminary results of laboratory tests showed that 10 patients
admitted at Grant earlier this week suffered from salmonella
poisoning, said Ginny Sharp, another hospital spokeswoman.
   Symptoms of the contamination by the salmonella bacteria include
nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and fever. Sufferers must take care to
avoid dehydration, McCarthy said.

   Mayor David Dinkins wants to free more police
officers to confront street and subway crime by having firefighters
and city ambulance workers respond to more emergency calls without
police accompaniment.
   The proposal is part of Dinkins' $1.8 billion ``Safe Streets,
Safe City'' program to hire nearly 8,000 new police officers after
a summer of stinging criticism about the city's escalating
violence.
   New Yorkers placed 8.3 million 911 calls last year, the most of
any city in the nation, and officials estimate that police officers
spent 90 percent of their time answering 4.2 million of those
calls.
   More than 2 million were crank calls or incidents that were
resolved by the time police arrived, the Police Department said.
   The load-sharing proposal would let firefighters and Emergency
Medical Services ambulances respond to about 450,000 medical calls
and non-residential fires where ``there is no need for police - no
crime has been committed,'' police spokesman Michael Amarosa said
Wednesday.
   Police Commissioner Lee Brown wants more officers on the
streets. A cornerstone of the plan is to keep the number of 911
calls that police respond to at 4.2 million a year for the next few
years.
   ``We can't control the input, the 911 call,'' Amarosa said.
``What they're looking to stabilize is the 4.2 million radio
runs.''
   Police ``don't want to be 911-driven,'' Amarosa said.
   It is also hoped that the high visibility of the additional
officers will encourage people to report incidents to officers
directly, rather than relying on 911.

   The Soviet Union's top general preached
peace and urged expanded East-West cooperation in Europe in a
speech he delivered during a U.S. tour with his Pentagon
counterpart.
   Gen. Mikhail Moiseyev, chief of the Soviet general staff, said
Wednesday his country is reducing its military forces in Europe in
reaction to the end of the Cold War - symbolized by German
unification.
   ``Europe has used up the allotted limit of wars and human
losses,'' Moiseyev told about 1,000 people at a dinner at the
Fairmont Hotel. ``It can no longer be looked upon as a potential
theater of war.''
   Moiseyev toured U.S. military installations in five states with
Army Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff.
His speech Wednesday was his first during the tour.
   Moiseyev is the highest-ranking Soviet military officer to visit
the United States since Marshall Sergei Akhromeyev met with
then-Secretary of Defense Frank Carlucci in December 1987.
   Since then, however, the face of East-West relations has changed
drastically with the fall last year of communist governments
throughout Eastern Europe and continuing reforms in the Soviet
Union.
   Speaking through an interpreter, Moiseyev said the mission of
NATO needs to be reevaluated because the threat of war between the
superpowers has been reduced dramatically.
   ``Who are NATO members training to fight against in Europe?'' he
asked. ``In our view, the key to establishing a system of
collective security on the European continent lies in eliminating
the standoff of military blocs.''
   Noting the official joining of the post-World War II German
nations Wednesday, he said the ``question of Europe's future
security is inseparably linked with the unification of the two
German states.''
   ``The Soviet leadership stands for setting up a new all-European
security system, a united Europe of peace and cooperation,'' he
said.
   Soviet military strength has been reduced by 300,000 servicemen,
he said.
   ``In the European zone alone we have reduced our strength by
20,000 tanks, 24,000 artillery pieces, over 860 combat aircraft,
and 40 warships,'' Moiseyev said.
   ``In 1991 the Soviet forces will completely be withdrawn from
Hungary and Czechoslovakia, and in the near future from Germany and
Poland.''
   Powell introduced Moiseyev to the gathering sponsored by the San
Francisco Chamber of Commerce, World Affairs Council and the
Commonwealth Club.
   Moiseyev began by saying the ``postwar epoch has ended'' and is
being replaced by a ``new world that would shape the makeup of this
planet for many years to come.''
   This new world cannot be seen ``in its entirety yet,'' he said,
but ``part of it is undergoing severe testing in the crisis
situation in the Middle East.''

<TEXT>
   The House is nearing approval of an anticrime
bill that would expand the use of the death penalty, but it first
must choose between two plans designed to shorten delays in
carrying out executions.
   ``We who are the lawmakers believe that when the death penalty
is meted out, it should be done fairly but it should be done
expeditiously,'' Rep. Jack Buechner, R-Mo., said Wednesday as
debate got under way.
   Conservatives clamoring for tougher death penalty provisions
were blamed by the chief sponsor, Rep. William Hughes, D-N.J., for
turning the bill into a ``political football'' a month before
congressional elections.
   Under the bill, federal courts could impose the death penalty
for assassination of a range of government officials. The offenses
of treason and espionage also would be punishable by death.
   The bill also seeks to limit the number of habeas corpus
petitions inmates under death sentence could file and thus postpone
execution, by a decade or more in some case. Such petitions
challenge whether a prisoner is being held legally.
   Other features range from a shutoff in federal benefits for
convicted drug offenders to a one-year prison term for illegal
possession of steroids.
   If approved, the bill would go to a conference committee for
resolution of differences with a Senate-passed version.
   President Bush has criticized the House bill, saying some
features are less stringent that current law. He has been critical
of provisions that would allow death row inmates to use racial
statistics to bolster their appeals.
   Bush also has attacked the habeas corpus provision, saying that
far from speeding up the appeals process, it would stretch it to
greater length.
   Conservatives led by Rep. Henry J. Hyde, R-Ill., are pushing for
a tightened version and last week succeeded in blocking floor
action until Democrats agreed to a vote on their plan.
   The bill would require those under death sentence to file their
habeas corpus petitions within a year after exhausting their direct
appeals. It would limit them to one petition but provide for a
number of exceptions. Hyde wants to substitute a provision that
would allow state to impose the limits as long as the defendants
were represented by competent lawyers.
   Republicans also have forced sponsors to allow a vote on an
amendment sponsored by Rep. Chalmers P. Wylie, R-Ohio, that would
permit confiscation of the homes of those convicted of savings and
loan fraud. ``I'm tired of the lavish lifestyles of the S&amp;L
crooks,'' Rep. John Hiler, R-Ind., declared.
   Hughes pleaded with Republicans not to try to pepper the bill
with unconstitutional amendments. He said a tough bill was needed,
but also ``a bill we can all be proud of, a bill we can all go home
and campaign on.''
   GOP lawmakers, however, made it clear they wanted a substantial
reshaping of the legislation.
   Rep. Craig James, R-Fla., denounced ``endless appeals and
twisting the rules to prevent the will of the people from being
carried out.''
   ``In its present form, it would not help law enforcement, it
would hinder law enforcement,'' said Rep. Lawrence Coughlin, R-Pa.
   ``Some of my Republican colleagues want to play political
football with this issue,'' Hughes finally said. `` ... But the
Republican colleagues in my opinion are wrong in their belief that
the American public will award the moral high ground to whoever
claims to be the most bloodthirsty.''

   The govermment increased
security at embassies today after a bomb exploded at the U.S.
ambassador's home and police said they had seized dozens of weapons
from right-wing extremists.
   Police patrols were increased at embassies in Pretoria and
consulates in other cities after a small bomb exploded Wednesday at
the back gate of U.S. Ambassador William Swing's residence. No one
was hurt in the blast
   In other developments today, police said one man was killed in
black factional fighting in Natal, but the rest of the country was
quiet. Some 800 people have died in recent weeks in factional
battles.
   South African Foreign Minister Pik Botha said the government was
determined to catch whoever was responsible for the bombing at the
U.S. residence.
   No group took responsibility for the blast. South African press
reports today said it appeared to be the work of white
right-wingers opposed to government plans to end apartheid and
share power with the black majority.
   Ambassador Swing was home when the explosion occurred, said
Larry Schwartz of the U.S. Information Service. ``It's a total
surprise,'' Schwartz said. ``It's never happened before.''
   The United States backs President F.W. de Klerk's efforts to end
apartheid. De Klerk was given a warm welcome during a state visit
to Washington late last month.
   Right-wing whites also are angry with the United States for the
limited sanctions it has imposed on South Africa to protest
apartheid.
   Police said in a statement today that they had seized large
amounts of guns, explosives and ammunition at several houses in the
Pretoria and Johannesburg areas. The arms included machine guns,
mines, mortars and pistols, they said.
   Police commissioner Gen. Johan van der Merwe said some of the
weapons were stolen by right-wingers in a raid April 14 on air
force headquarters in Pretoria. He said the weapons were found
after the arrest last week of fugitive right-wing leader Piet
Rudolph.
   Rudolph declared ``war'' on the de Klerk government earlier this
year to try and halt efforts to end apartheid. Right-wingers were
blamed for a series of bombings in Johannesburg.
   White right-wing extremists claim whites and blacks cannot live
together and insist whites must have a separate homeland.
   Van der Merwe said some of the arms were recovered after police
promised immunity to people holding them.

   Engineers will rewrite the Magellan
space probe's computer programs to reduce the risk of again losing
contact with the Venus orbiter, an official says.
   Scientists have abandoned efforts to determine why they lost
contact with the spacecraft twice in August, said Tony Spear,
Magellan project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   ``We're reaching the point of diminishing returns in trying to
determine the root cause, so we are phasing that out. We're
focusing on fixes now,'' Spear said.
   Magellan on Wednesday continued using its radar to map and make
pictures of Venus, marking its 396th orbit since reaching the
planet Aug. 10.
   The spacecraft has now collected more ``bits'' of computerized
data than any other single planetary exploration spacecraft, said
Steve Wall, Magellan experiment representative. NASA has said that
by the end of Magellan's mission, it will have gathered more
information than all other spacecraft combined.
   The spacecraft made some test pictures of Venus Aug. 16, but
lost radio contact with Earth that night and again Aug. 21. That
delayed the start of full-scale mapping until Sept. 15.
   Engineers suspect the malfunctions stem from possible damage
that happened when the spacecraft jettisoned its braking rocket
several hours after it started orbiting Venus, Spear said.
   The damage might be a broken wire or circuit, Wall said. If
there was such damage, it apparently caused or aggravated
``noise,'' or static, that interferes with Magellan's computers,
Spear said.
   Rewriting the compute programs will help Magellan automatically
detect future glitches, reduce the chance of a complete loss of
radio contact, and allow the most trouble-prone of the four
computers to operate while bypassing ``corrupted'' portions of its
memory, Spear said.
   That computer - a backup computer that helps aim the spacecraft
- hasn't been used since the communications blackouts. The new
software will allow it to be used in case the primary directional
computer ever fails.
   The new computer programming will be radioed to Magellan to
replace existing software only as problems develop, and ``we will
test the living daylights out of it on the ground,'' Spear said.
   He said some of the new programs will be installed by the end of
this year, the rest by the end of 1991.
   Magellan's pictures of Venus have shown extensive faulting and
fracturing of the planet's surface, giant meteorite impact craters
and a wide variety of volcanoes.
   Laboratory spokesman Jim Doyle said 98.9 percent of all radar
mapping data collected by Magellan since Sept. 15 was transmitted
to Earth successfully. That means about four hours of information
were lost or damaged in transit.
   Spear said the most recent incident happened Tuesday when
high-energy particles in space slightly degraded one orbit's worth
of picture data. Computer processing should restore the quality of
those images, he said.

<HEAD>Fixing Eastern Europe's Natural Gas Leaks Could Ease Greenhouse
Effect</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Plugging natural gas leaks in polluted
Eastern European and Asian cities could help reduce future warming
of Earth's climate by the ``greenhouse effect,'' according to a
study published today.
   ``It would be one small step in the right direction - a manmade
contributon to global warming that can be remedied by mankind's own
efforts,'' said Stanley Tyler, an atmospheric scientist at the
National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo.
   The new study was published in the journal Nature by chemists F.
Sherwood Rowland, Donald Blake and Neil Harris at the University of
California, Irvine.
   ``It's very significant work'' because it shows one relatively
easy way to reduce future global warming, said Kathleen Hogan of
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's global change division.
   ``If we went in and found the leaks and fixed them in the
natural gas systems in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, you'd
have a very large start at reducing the contribution of methane
(natural gas) to global warming,'' Hogan said Wednesday by
telephone from Washington.
   Some scientists dispute the theory that gases from human
activities are heating Earth's atmosphere by trapping heat as glass
does in a greenhouse, but the scientific consensus is that the
greenhouse effect exists and is worsening. It is believed to have
warmed Earth's climate by one-half to 1 degree Fahrenheit during
the past century and will raise temperatures by 3 to 8 degrees more
by 2050.
   Such warming could trigger famine by disrupting agriculture, and
coastal areas could be flooded if sea levels are raised by melting
of glaciers, melting of the Greenland ice sheet and thermal
expansion of water.
   About half of global warming is caused by carbon dioxide gas
from fossil fuel burning, about 20 percent is due to chemicals
called chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, and an additional 20 percent
is caused by methane, which is natural gas, Rowland said. Other
trace gases cause the remaining warming.
   Researchers measured natural gas concentrations in several
areas. They found that compared with U.S. and Western European
cities and Eastern European rural areas, methane levels in urban
air were very high in Berlin; Budapest, Hungary; Krakow, Poland;
Prague, Czechoslovakia; Istanbul, Turkey; and Yerevan in Soviet
Armenia.
   Previous research found natural gas concentrations in Earth's
atmosphere increased 1 percent annually during the 1980s, and that
it takes 10 years for chemical reactions in the atmosphere to
remove natural gas.
   That means a 10 percent reduction in natural gas emissions
worldwide would halt increasing atmospheric concentrations of
methane and cancel its contribution to increased global warming,
Rowland said.
   He said reduction could be achieved by controlling leaks in
natural gas valves, pipelines, compressor stations and other
facilities, especially in Eastern Europe and Asia.
   Hogan said some studies estimate up to 10 percent of Eastern
Europe's natural gas leaks into the atmosphere because of aging,
poorly maintained transmission facilities.
   Leakage in the United States is less than a few percent, said
George Strang, vice president for engineering at Southern
California Gas Co.

   A fifth person died from injuries sustained
when a car careened through six intersections in central San
Francisco.
   Ha Fechter, 29, died late Wednesday at San Francisco General
Hospital where she was being treated for third-degree burns over 60
percent of her body, nursing supervisor Dorothy Washington said.
   Fechter's car was struck from behind and burst into flames in
the crash Tuesday.
   Police believe George Nelson, 91, of San Francisco, suffered a
heart attack before his car barreled through six intersections at
up to 80 mph, hitting four cars, which struck other cars. Nelson's
car eventually smashed into a telephone pole.
   Nelson, two children trapped in Fechter's car and one other
person died instantly.
   Police said Nelson had a history of heart trouble. Coroner's
officials said it will take three to six weeks to determine if he
had suffered a heart attack.

<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A warehouse owner says police officers advised him
how to dispose of a body before a booby trap he set killed a
burglar, a newspaper said today.
   Philip Connaghan, who pleaded guilty to manslaughter, said
Wednesday the police advice came in discussions about repeated
burglaries at his warehouse, The Denver Post reported.
   Police Chief Ari Zavaras said he was not aware of Connaghan's
allegations about police advice and ordered an investigation.
   Connaghan, a handyman from suburban Arvada, didn't disclose the
officers' names nor detail their suggestions.
   He said police told him ``steps of how to dispose of a body if I
found a body in my shop. They knew the terrible predicament I was
up against and they knew they couldn't help me.''
   A single-barrel, 12-gauge shotgun was propped inside the
warehouse and attached to a trip wire, killing Michael McComb, 19,
on April 14, authorities said.
   Connghan set two shotgun booby traps at the warehouse after a
break-in in January. During another burglary in March, one booby
trap was tripped but malfunctioned. He dismantled one of the traps
but told authorities he forgot to disarm the other.
   Connaghan said he set the traps because he was increasingly
frustrated by break-ins and the theft of expensive tools, personal
items and electronic equipment he needed for his work.
   The case triggered overwhelming support for Connaghan from
residents, who said they were fed up with the high crime rate. Some
people put up signs warning their businesses also were booby
trapped.
   District Attorney Norm Early said if officers did advise
Connaghan on how to dispose of a body, it would not constitute a
crime.
   Colorado has a ``make my day'' law that allows use of deadly
force to protect householders from intruders, but the district
attorney's office said it only applied to people in fear of their
lives.
   Prosecutors said Connaghan was not at the warehouse at the time
of the burglary and therefore not entitled to protection under the
law.
   Connaghan was sentenced in August to pay $9,500 in fines and
restitution to McComb's family and was placed on six years'
probation.

<HEAD>Five Westerners Escape Iraq By Boat, Aided By Rare Mist</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Gulf Rdp</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DHAHRAN, Saudi Arabia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three Britons and two Frenchman
escaped from Iraq by small boat in a daring 25-hour voyage, British
diplomats and Saudi officials said today.
   It was the first report of Western men escaping in six weeks.
   Guided only by a small compass and provisioned with cheese,
bread, vodka and whisky, the men were concealed by a rare mist that
arose as they drifted in high seas.
   The men were found Wednesday drifting in a shipping lane by the
Saudi coast guard off the town of Khafji on the border with Kuwait,
officials reported. They said the five were suffering the first
effects of exposure.
   The Britons contacted their families in England, who put them in
touch with the Daily Mail newspaper.
   The London paper quoted them as saying they spent 25 hours in
rough seas after taking a 10-foot fiberglass boat through the
marshes of southern Iraq.
   ``We only just made it and we know we're lucky,'' Mike Teesdale,
40, was quoted as saying. ``When we got off the boat the relief was
enormous. We sat down and tried to be big men, but we all felt like
crying.''
   The Mail said the five Britons had worked on a key oil
installation near the southern Iraqi port of Basra, and the two
Frenchmen were barge masters.
   The escapees were among a small number of Europeans living on
dwindling food supplies and denied permission to leave.
   It was the first report of Western men escaping from Iraq in
more than six weeks. Baghdad has prevented thousands of Western men
from leaving Iraq and Kuwait after Iraqi forces invaded the tiny
emirate on Aug. 2.
   Iraq has taken several hundred Westerners hostage and put them
near key military and civilian targets as a human shield against
military strikes by the U.S.-led multinational force building up in
Saudi Arabia.
   Iraqis were allowed to go fishing Tuesday because of a religious
holiday, so the men chose that night for their escape. They said
they made their way through the Shatt-al-Arab waterway into the
Persian Gulf.
   The Shatt-al-Arab, which forms the southern boundary between
Iran and Iraq, has been closed to shipping since the 1980-88
Iran-Iraq war.
   Teesdale said the men only had a small compass to guide them and
got lost several times as they tried to avoid villages and other
craft.
   A 10-foot swell prevented them from using their diesel engine as
they tried to follow the shoreline in the gulf past occupied
Kuwait. A rare heavy mist and overcast skies helped prevent them
from being spotted.
   Another of the Britons, 44-year-old Ivan Manning, told the Mail:
``We took supplies of bread, cheese, whisky and vodka ... . We knew
the risks.''
   The five worked in rotation, one on lookout, one steering and
one working the bilge pump.

<HEAD>Dollar Down, Gold Up</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar fell against other major foreign
currencies in early European trading today.
   Gold prices were slightly higher.
   Dealers said the dollar fell following remarks by Alan
Greenspan, Federal Reserve chairman, that the budget deficit
agreement could lead to lower U.S. interest rates.
   Lower interest rates make the dollar a less attractive
investment for foreign exchange dealers.
   Traders said the perception that an armed conflict in the
Persian Gulf could be avoided has also forced the dollar, a safe
haven currency, lower.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.75 yen to a closing 135.90 yen.
Later in London, it was quoted at 135.47 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Wednesday:
   -1.5415 German marks, down from 1.5435
   -1.2845 Swiss francs, unchanged
   -5.1635 French francs, down from 5.1747
   -1.7375 Dutch guilders, down from 1.741
   -1,155.25 Italian lire, down from 1,160.25
   -1.1510 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1516
   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.8995, compared
with $1.8990 late Wednesday.
   London's major bullion dealers fixed a recommended gold price of
$392.75 per ounce at midmorning, up from $390.75 bid per ounce late
Wednesday.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $392.85, up from $390.50 late
Wednesday.
   Hong Kong markets were closed for the Chinese Mid-Autumn
Festival.
   Silver traded in London at a bid price of $4.69 a troy ounce,
down from Wednesday's $4.70.

<HEAD>New Clues Surface in Search for Origin of Baseball</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 2nd graf, `Abner Doubleday's ...' to CORRECT Cooperstown,
Ohio, to Cooperstown, N.Y. Version also moving on sports circuits.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Harvard graduate student combing archives
uncovered new clues in the search for the origin of baseball in an
1845 newspaper sports story and box score.
   Abner Doubleday's ``invention'' of baseball in a Cooperstown,
N.Y., cow pasture has been debunked as a popular myth. The city of
Hoboken, N.J., then claimed the first game was played there in
1846.
   The story and primitive box score appeared in a copy of The New
York Morning News and recount a game played Oct. 21, 1845, between
the ``New York Ball club'' and a team from Brooklyn, The New York
Times reported today.
   The find by Edward L. Widmer, a Harvard doctoral candidate
researching his dissertation at the New York Historical Society,
indicates baseball had been in existence for some time when the
story was written.
   The newspaper account began: ``A friendly match of the
time-honored game of Base was played yesterday ...''
   New York won 24-4, aided by a grand slam, or in the vocabulary
of the time, ``four aces'' off a single hit.
   The newspaper account went on to say two new Brooklyn teams had
formed recently.
   After it was proved that Doubleday did not create baseball,
historians credited Alexander Cartwright, a New York bank clerk
said to have drawn up the rules and organized the first game in
1846 for the Knickerbocker ``Base Ball Club'' at the Elysian Fields
in Hoboken.
   The game reported in the Morning News also was played at Elysian
Fields, and Widmer found another clipping recounting a rematch Oct.
24, 1845, that was played in Brooklyn.
   The find indicates that ``New York City is the cradle of
baseball,'' said David Q. Voigt, a baseball historian and professor
at Albright College in Reading, Pa.
   ``Baseball was a city game, not a rural or farm game,'' he said,
adding that the find supports his theory that baseball developed in
stages.

<HEAD>Dukakis Faces More Rebellion Over Budget Cuts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JONATHAN YENKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   His lieutenant governor's mutiny ended weeks ago,
but Gov. Michael S. Dukakis still faces dissension within his
ranks.
   Dukakis has been slashing money from the state budget, which
itself has defied the governor's attempts to bring it into balance.
Just three months into the fiscal year, Dukakis twice has ordered
cuts, now totaling $460 million. The cuts have dug deeply into
health care and welfare accounts.
   But on Tuesday, Communities and Development Secretary Amy S.
Anthony said an order to cut $12 million from the state's
rent-subsidy account would increase homelessness, forcing almost
5,000 families onto the streets. So she declared she would not
comply with the orders.
   ``I think we've bitten the bullet an enormous amount in this
department,'' Anthony said. ``We've done everything conceivable.
But there are limits to what is doable and what is responsible.''
   Dukakis, who met with Anthony on Wednesday, said, ``There may be
ways of dealing with the problem without putting 5,000 people out
in the street.''
   Some programs might be spared if the Legislature can find cuts
elsewhere, he said. Dukakis imposed the cuts only where he had
authority to do so in the executive branch. He has not touched
other accounts, such as aid to cities and towns, which the
Legislature controls.
   On Wednesday, state Human Services Secretary Philip Johnston
also pledged to avoid some of the proposed budget cuts. He told a
group of hearing-impaired people that the state would find money to
pay for a phone system for the deaf.
   For his part, Dukakis said: ``I'm bound and determined as much
as possible when we walk out of here to leave a budget in
balance.''
   Reaching that goal has turned into an endless task for Dukakis,
who has been struggling with the state's fiscal troubles since the
day he lost the 1988 presidential election.
   In the last fiscal year, the state ran up a deficit of more than
$1 billion and its bond ratings plnged to the nation's lowest.
   Dukakis is not seeking re-election, but he has become the target
of wrath for many residents and politicians. Last month Lt. Gov.
Evelyn Murphy, who was foundering in her campaign to succeed
Dukakis, staged a revolt against him. With Dukakis away on a
European trade mission, she grabbed control of the state's finances
as acting governor.
   Murphy unveiled her own set of cuts. But Dukakis administration
officials said they wouldn't save as much money as she promised and
the governor's budget-cutting plans would go further.
   With her mutiny and election campaign swirling in disarray,
Murphy dropped out of the governor's race.
   But that has not stopped the state budget siege. A continuing
slide in the state economy, along with gloomy national forecasts,
have forced state officials to repeatedly lower their estimates for
tax collections.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said today it was
unnecessary to send Soviet troops to the Persian Gulf to join the
U.S.-led multinational force.
   Gorbachev made the comment to reporters before meeting in the
Kremlin with Qais Abdul Munim Al-Zawawi, Oman's deputy prime
minister for finance.
   Asked if he thought war would break out in the gulf, Gorbachev
replied, ``I think not.''
   In response to a query whether Soviet troops would be sent to
the gulf, Gorbachev said, ``I think there are already more than
enough troops there.''
   The comment came as a Gorbachev envoy, Yevgeny Primakov, arrived
in Baghdad today to discuss ways of seeking a peaceful resolution
to the crisis. Soviet diplomatic sources said Primakov was carrying
a message from Gorbachev but did not disclose its contents.
   The Soviet Union joined international efforts to condemn Iraq
following its invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2. It cut off arms sales
to Baghdad as part of the U.N. trade embargo against Iraq and has
warships in the gulf region.
   Soviet officials previously had said the Soviet Union might
consider joining the international military force in the region if
it is placed under U.N. command. An estimated 200,000 troops from
various countries, including 170,000 Americans, were dispatched to
Saudi Arabia after Iraq's invasion.
   Tass, the official Soviet news agency, said Gorbachev and
Al-Zawawi were expected to discuss relations between the two
countries and international issues, particularly the Middle East.

   Each side had its script and its props. Each
performed its role to perfection. It wasn't a play acted out,
however, but a riot.
   More than 40 people - including a dozen police officers - were
injured and 246 rioters were arrested, police said.
   West Berlin police and a veteran radical group re-enacted yet
another of their violent confrontations, only this time it took
place in what was once East Berlin.
   Thousands of leftist radicals opposed to Wednesday's German
unification used the first full day of the historic merger to
rampage through East Berlin's sprawling central square,
Alexanderplatz.
   The radicals trashed outdoor concessions stands, destroyed cars,
smashed windows, hurled rocks and fired flare guns at police.
   Police in riot gear used water cannons and tear gas against the
radicals. The two sides battled for hours for control of the
square, taking turns charging each other well into the night.
   About 500 leftists and 200 Turkish youths took part in the
riots, police said.
   ``It's almost comical,'' said East Berliner Herbert Schneider.
He watched, dumbfounded, as running gangs of radicals and hooligans
were chased around the square by hundreds of police with helmets,
shields and nightsticks.
   ``We have a complicated future here,'' he said.
   The clash began as a huge protest against German unity. The
leftists gathered in a grassy square in what was West Berlin for a
rally against what they said was rising racism and nationalism in
both sides of Germany.
   About 20,000 demonstrators marched into East Berlin, to a square
just outside of Alexanderplatz, where they tore down the new West
German flags from six flagpoles and hoisted the red-and-black flag
of their anarchist movement, and old Communist East German flags.
   The protest turned violent when the leftists began smashing
windows and trashing cars. Police ordered thousands of other people
celebrating unity to leave the area, and the leftists eventually
took over Alexanderplatz.
   Each side took turns charging and retreating, repeating in near
exact form past clashes that have been played out for many years in
West Berlin.
   The rioters joked and raided beer stands on the square. ``To
unity,'' laughed a young woman after police briefly drove the
thousands of people, most of them young West Berliners, to the
square's perimeter.
   Older people walked past the strewn rubble on the square and the
surrounding streets with shocked expressions. Beer kegs and
tear-gas canisters littered the area.
   A man who tried to drive through a swirling crowd of youths
angrily stopped his car and challenged them. He was escorted gently
back into his vehicle by three towering police officers.
   East Germany has been marred by right-wing and left-wing
extremist violence since it opened its borders to the West. But
Wednesday was the first time West Berlin leftists staged one of
their patented, hours-long, give-and-take riots.
   Leftists had told The Associated Press earlier this week that
the march against unity would turn into a clash with police. Police
likewise had said that unity day celebrations would be marred by
extremists.
   The predictions came true.

<HEAD>`Michael Feinstein in Concert: Piano and Voice' Opens on Broadway</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: No PMs planned.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Drama Critic</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Michael Feinstein could be the world's biggest
fan of classic popular music.
   That's part of his appeal, a genuine enthusiasm for the songs of
George Gershwin, Richard Rodgers, Jerome Kern, Jule Styne, Harry
Warren, Stephen Sondheim, Richard Whiting and scores of other
Broadway and Hollywood composers.
   His affection for these melody masters comes through in
``Michael Feinstein in Concert: Piano and Voice,'' his third trip
to Broadway since 1988.
   Once the technical glitches - particularly a balky sound system
- are ironed out Feinstein's new show, which is on view at
Broadway's Golden Theater through Oct. 27, could be his best yet.
   The evening has been constructed carefully, with songs grouped
together by theme or composer or lyricist. Feinstein always has
been adept at intertwining different songs by the same writers. The
numbers reverberate off each other, making the listener doubly
aware of what a composer or a lyricist was trying to say.
   For example, Feinstein does it with two standards that have
lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein - Jerome Kern's ``Make Believe'' and
Richard Rodgers' ``I Have Dreamed.'' Both numbers reveal the man's
unabashed sense of romanticism and his firm belief in true love.
   The evening's highlight is a medley of songs by Burton Lane,
with whom Feinstein recently has recorded an album. A spry,
ebullient Lane was on hand Tuesday night to assist Feinstein, and
it was Tin Pan Alley heaven. The 78-year-old composer is a marvel,
playing his own songs with a zest no mere second-hand interpreter
could ever muster.
   Besides such Lane evergreens as ``Babes on Broadway,'' ``How
About You'' and ``On a Clear Day You Can See Forever,'' Feinstein
and Lane ripped smashingly through a witty little ditty called
``Anything Can Happen in New York.'' The lyrics were by E.Y.
Harburg and recall a time when the unexpected in the Big Apple
actually could be fun.
   Feinstein has a conversational rapport with the audience. He
talks to them as if he were sitting in their living rooms. There's
a bit of a true believer in him as well. He knows he's right when
he extols the virtues of these songwriters.
   Near the end of the long evening, he delivers a little lecture
on lyricist Johnny Mercer, peppered with musical illustrations
ranging from the well-known, ``Come Rain or Come Shine,'' to the
more than obscure, ``Girlfriend of the Whirling Dirvish.''
   But Feinstein relishes even these most unknown of songs. He has
the same preciseness of enunciation that he gives such standards as
Rodgers and Hart's ``Manhattan'' or Gershwin's ``I'll Build a
Stairway to Paradise.'' And he can be heartfelt with an unknown
Jule Styne song, ``Killing Time,'' which has the last lyrics ever
written by Carolyn Leigh.
   Feinstein certainly doesn't hold anything back. He gives his
all. You wonder what kind of voice he'll have at the end of a
four-week engagement. There may be better singers and better piano
players, but nobody tops Michael in his love of performing these
grand musical standards.

<HEAD>Gen. LeMay Remembered as Skilled Leader</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MARCH AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gen. Curtis E. LeMay was
remembered at his funeral as a skilled military leader with little
time for small talk but strong concern for his troops and his
friends.
   ``He was a great man, great airman, great American,'' said
retired Lt. Gen. William Craigie, a former test pilot and longtime
friend of the gruff, cigar-chomping Air Force general.
   About 1,000 people crowded the base chapel for the formal,
military funeral ceremony Wednesday. LeMay's coffin was draped by
an American flag. Burial was scheduled today at the Air Force
Academy in Colorado Springs, Colo.
   LeMay, who directed the atomic bombing of Japan, organized the
Berlin Airlift and headed the Strategic Air Command, suffered a
heart attack Monday and died at a base hospital. He was 83.
   The four-star general and one-time Air Force chief of staff was
known for his skill as a military tactician, but his public
statements and sparring with former Defense Secretary Robert S.
McNamara often generated controversy.
   But Speakers at LeMay's funeral remembered the general in more
personal terms.
   ``(LeMay) believed in one thing, taking care of his people,''
said retired Maj. Gen. Edward Nichols.
   Nichols' voice wavered as he spoke of LeMay's concern for
military families.
   He said LeMay's first priority was that ``bases were set up to
take care of our wives and children when we are gone.''
   The base chaplain, Col. Benjamin Perez, said that LeMay spent
his final days helping untangle the government red tape of military
care for people living in his retirement complex, Air Force
Village, which LeMay helped found.
   ``There is much of General LeMay that remains,'' said Perez of
the general's contributions. ``We remember and we celebrate.''
   Taps were played after a traditional military rifle salute,
bringing tears to mourners.
   LeMay, a much-decorated veteran of some of the fiercest air
battles over Europe during World War II, later commanded U.S. air
forces in Europe and led SAC.
   Shortly after his retirement from the military in 1965, LeMay
was quoted as having made the infamous remark about bombing North
Vietnam ``back into the Stone Age.''
   LeMay later denied the statements, but then kept the controversy
alive by saying he saw nothing wrong with using nuclear weapons to
shorten any war and to save lives.

   This time the suits brought by four would-be
nightclub patrons were correct.
   A small claims court ordered the owner of a chic nightspot to
pay damages to the four, who claimed they were kept out of the club
because the doorman didn't deem them trendy enough.
   Commissioner Diana Wheatley on Wednesday awarded $250 apiece to
the plaintiffs, who waited in vain to get in the downtown Mayan
club on May 19.
   They filed lawsuits under the Unruh Civil Rights Act of 1959,
claiming they were kept out by an arbitrary and discriminatory
decision.
   The case pitted plaintiffs Jeff Stolzer, Kenneth Lipton,
Teresita Dubrall and Stephen Ambrosini against Sammy Chao,
president of the company that owns the Mayan.
   The club has become a popular nightspot since it opened about
six months ago. Some clubgoers are waved right in. Others must wait
as the doorman chooses among them.
   Chao testified Tuesday that no dress code exists and that the
doorman picks and chooses to keep out people who are drunk or
otherwise look like trouble, as well as save room inside for
patrons with reservations.
   Stolzer differed. He told the court: ``I think we were met at
the door by a flippant and arrogant doorman. They just looked you
over like you were scum.''
   The plaintiffs claimed the decisions were arbitrary. Had there
been a posted dress code, they argued, they would have complied.
   Vertigo, a nearby club, faces a similar legal problem. The state
Alcoholic Beverage Control Department has recommended suspending
Vertigo's liquor license for 30 days because undercover inspectors
were refused entry.
   The club's owner said the state inspectors were dressed
improperly.

<HEAD>Scientists Narrow Search for Marfan Syndrome Gene</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists believe they are zeroing in on the gene
responsible for Marfan syndrome, an inherited cause of heart
disease. But in a report released today they caution that no cure
is in sight.
   The researchers reported finding the general area of the gene,
an important step toward pinpointing the defective gene and finding
out how it causes the disease, according to the study in the New
England Journal of Medicine.
   People with Marfan syndrome usually are tall and lanky. They
often suffer heart ailments that can cause death.
   The dsease runs in families, and finding its genetic roots
should help doctors diagnose who is likely to have it, even before
birth. But the disease also does its damage during fetal
development, so that simply replacing the defective gene with a
good one later in life would not reverse the disease.
   ``For the foreseeable future, the discovery of the cause of
Marfan syndrome will be of primarily psychological benefit to
patients,'' Dr. Reed E. Pyritz of Johns Hopkins Hospital wrote in
an editorial published with the study.
   He said the biologic and technical problems of gene replacement
``make the task seem insurmountable at present.''
   The report was based on a genetic analysis of five families with
the disease in Finland. It was conducted by Dr. Leena Peltonen and
colleagues from the National Public Health Institute in Helsinki.
   The researchers narrowed down the location of the defective gene
to chromosome 15, one of the strings of genes that determines how
people develop.
   The findings have been widely known in medical circles for
several months, and efforts are under way to see if the same
genetic pattern shows up in other families with the disease.
   If they pinpoint the defective gene, scientists will be able to
figure out what it does normally and how it causes disease when it
malfunctions.
   Some experts believe the crucial gene may turn out to be one
that controls the body's production of fibrillin, a protein that
helps make skin and blood vessels stretch.

<HEAD>Woman Guilty Of First-Degree Murder In Death Of 4-Year-Old Son</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GARDEN CITY, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman has been convicted of killing
her 4-year-old son, and now faces trial in Texas in the deaths of
four other children, three of them her daughters, the other a
relative's child.
   A Finney County District Court jury returned a first-degree
murder verdict Wednesday against Diana Lumbrera, 32, who moved to
Garden City from Texas in 1985. The jurors deliberated a little
more than three hours.
   Besides the four deaths with which Ms. Lumbrera is charged in
Texas, the deaths of two other sons are under investigation there.
   The prosecution in Kansas contended Ms. Lumbrera smothered her
son to get sympathy and life insurance money.
   As the verdict was read, Ms. Lumbrera - who has no living
children - stood next to her lawyer, Michael Quint, and cried.
   Quint said he would appeal the conviction in the May 1 death of
Jose Lumbrera.
   ``We made it perfectly clear from the start that we believed the
trial should have been moved because of prejudicial, pretrial
publicity,'' he said.
   Jurors said the decision was difficult. They said many of them
had been leaning toward acquittal until two pathologists testified
as rebuttal witnesses for the prosecution.
   Dr. William Eckert, a Wichita pathologist called by the defense,
said the boy died of a viral infection.
   But the pathologists called to rebut his testimony said there
were no signs Jose died of natural causes.
   For a year before Jose's death, Ms. Lumbrera had been lying to
her landlord and friends, telling them the boy was dying of
leukemia. Finney County prosecutor Ricklin Pierce said he believed
that, coupled with the fact that she had not given the boy
prescription medicine the day he died, convinced the jury she was
not intent on keeping her son alive.
   ``The real heroes of this case were the forensic pathologists
and Garden City police who refused to give up on their
investigations,'' he said.
   Jurors said they had limited knowledge of the Texas cases, and
that they had no influence on their verdict.
   Ms. Lumbrera, who will be sentenced in November, faces life in
prison, with eligibility for parole in 15 years. Three of the cases
against her in Texas carry the death penalty on conviction.
   An extradition hearing was set for Friday.
   Estella Espinoza, the defendant's sister, said she thought
jurors had made up their minds before the trial began.
   ``I don't think it was fair,'' she said. ``They didn't give her
a chance. They made up their minds a long time ago. They convicted
an innocent woman. That will be on their conscience for the rest of
their lives.''
   ``I've known her all my life and I still don't believe she
killed the kid,'' said Ms. Lumbrera's uncle, Lupe Salazar, a farmer
from Bovina, Texas.
   He said he felt the trial should have been moved.
   Ms. Lumbrera, a former resident of Bovina, Texas, is charged in
Texas with killing three young daughters in 1976, 1978 and 1982 to
collect life insurance benefits.
   She also is charged in the 1980 death of a cousin's six-week-old
daughter.

   An orange fireball dropped from the
night sky and exploded ``like a miniature atomic bomb'' over the
town of Lockerbie, a policeman recalled today as he recounted the
crash of Pan Am Flight 103.
   ``The debris ran like a carpet across the countryside, a trail
of devastation and bodies,'' said Constable Michael Stryjewski.
   Stryjewski was the first witness to testify at the public
inquiry that began Monday into the terrorist bombing of the Boeing
747 on Dec. 21, 1988. All 259 people aboard the New York-bound
jetliner and 11 on the ground in Lockerbie were killed.
   In his account of the plane's final moments, Stryjewski said he
heard jet engines and saw ``an orange glow in the sky'' from the
window of his home that overlooks the town of 3,000.
   ``The glow appeared to be growing larger and coming downward,''
he said. ``The next thing I saw were shapes falling to the ground
somewhere in Lockerbie. ... There was a horrendous noise, an
explosion.''
   ``The explosion was like a miniature atomic bomb and a mushroom
of cloud and flame went upward,'' he said. ``It just kept going up.
I'd say it reached 1,000 feet.''
   Debris hit the roof of his house. The tiles lifted and came
down. The double-glazing on his windows cracked.
   The policeman said he could see houses on fire in the Sherwood
Crescent area and tried to make an emergency call but his phone was
dead.
   He jumped into his car, drove to the Lockerbie police station,
picked up a first-aid kit and headed for Sherwood Crescent, where
he found some houses on fire and others destroyed.
   He started searching for survivors. He found bodies in one
burning house. In another house, he said, he treated an elderly man
with a head wound.
   Then he drove to a nearby farm where he discovered more bodies
and two engines from an aircraft.
   Returning to Lockerbie, he saw wreckage scattered everywhere.
One body was in the road, and nearby he spotted an airline ticket
from London's Heathrow Airport to New York's John F. Kennedy
Airport.
   ``That's when I realized it was an airliner,'' he said. ``Up
until then, I thought it was two fighter aircraft that collided.''
   The inquiry, which is to focus on ways to prevent a similar
disaster, was adjourned Tuesday and Wednesday after the death of
Scottish attorney Michael Hughes, who was representing relatives of
American victims.
   He was killed in a car crash Monday.
   Police have said the radio-cassette recorder bomb hidden in a
suitcase was probably put aboard the flight in Frankfurt. The
flight changed from a Boeing 727 to a Boeing 747 at London's
Heathrow Airport.
   Scottish officials have said they are investigating Ahmed
Jibril's radical Palestinian group, the Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine-General Command, and Mohammed Abu Talb of
the Popular Struggle Front, who was convicted of bombings in
Europe.

<HEAD>Robby the Robot Negotiates Canyon in Mars Rover Test</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Robby, a $1 million robot rover vehicle
designed to explore Mars, successfully picked its way along a rocky
dry river bed without human help, NASA said.
   ``This is the first time that an autonomous vehicle has ever
navigated rugged terrain using video cameras,'' said Roger Bedard,
planetary rover program manager at the space agency's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory. ``Robby himself wouldn't go to Mars. He's a
test vehicle.''
   NASA called the Sept. 13 test ``a significant milestone'' in
developing a planet-roving, computer-guided vehicle that would
explore Mars to find suitable landing sites for a manned mission to
the red planet.
   It will be about 1995 before engineers fully develop rover
technology, and about 2000 before one can be built to go to Mars,
Bedard said Wednesday.
   During the test, Robby took four hours, 20 minutes to crawl
along a 109-yard course in the rugged Arroyo Seco, a dry river bed
in a canyon next to the laboratory. NASA wants a real Mars rover to
travel about 13 miles daily.
   Bedard said engineers told Robby where it was and where it was
supposed to go, but the six-wheeled vehicle used its twin
television cameras and computer to navigate a safe course around
boulders and other obstacles. Other tests were conducted last week.
   Robby is about 15 feet long, 6 feet wide and 6 feet tall. It was
named after Robby the Robot in ``Forbidden Planet,'' a 1956 science
fiction film.
   The robot's television cameras give it stereoscopic vision,
allowing it a three-dimensional look at objects about 6{ feet in
front of it. Robby moves about 6{ feet at a time, then stops to
survey another 6{-foot stretch of terrain before proceeding.
   Robby runs on a battery recharged by an onboard gasoline
generator. A Mars rover would be powered by the radioactive decay
of plutonium, Bedard said.
   The only unmanned rovers to explore another planet were two
Soviet Lunakod vehicles that explored the moon in the early 1970s,
Bedard said. NASA astronauts used a manned vehicle on the moon.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration doesn't yet
have specific plans to put rovers on Mars, Bedard said. The Soviets
are considering using rovers and terrain-hopping balloons during a
1994 mission to Mars.
   During the past week, 30-foot-tall balloons that would
repeatedly rise and settle on Mars' surface were tested in
California's desert by engineers from France, the Soviet Union and
the Planetary Society, a group that advocates space exploration.
   Balloons have the advantage of not needing to navigate rough
terrain, rising during the heat of day and settling to the Martian
surface at night to take measurements.
   Bedard said rovers can be directed to explore areas of
scientific interest, rather than taking a route that depends on
prevailing winds.

   It isn't far-fetched to predict
that Dennis Stout will win the upcoming mayoral election. And lose.
   And maybe even lose twice.
   Incumbent Dennis Stout is fending off a challenge by Dennis
Stout in the Nov. 6 election in this San Bernardino County
community.
   Confused? That's what the third candidate, Francine Manzano, is
hoping for.
   ``It's great for me,'' she said. ``I think it will cause a lot
of confusion at the polls. I hope that works.''
   Manzano even built her campaign slogan on the theme:
   ``One Small Woman Against Two Stout Men.''
   Measures have been taken to guard against voter mix-ups. A
warning will be printed at the top of each ballot alerting people
to the same-name candidates.
   Mayor Dennis Lee Stout, whose name appears second on the ballot,
has chosen to place a ``No. 1'' by his name.
   Challenger Alfred Dennis Stout, who goes by his middle name, is
emphasizing the word ``new'' in his campaign. One slogan calls for
``new leadership and direction.''
   The businessman said he chose to run for mayor out of genuine
desire, not because of the shared moniker.
   ``I don't want him to think I was doing it just to confuse the
issue,'' he said. ``I wish it was different, but if I ran under the
name Alfred Stout, my kids wouldn't even know who it is.''
   The incumbent, who is seeking a second term, said he isn't too
concerned.
   ``The voters of Rancho Cucamonga are extremely sophisticated,''
he said. ``I've never really been overly concerned with it. It just
makes the election interesting.''

<HEAD>Woman Sentenced to Attend School, But Son Absent</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BRANCHLAND, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seventh-grader Oscar Brooks was back in
class today after a one-day absence, but his mother is keeping a
perfect attendance record.
   A judge ordered Maxine Brooks, a 57-year-old widow from West
Hamlin, to attend her son's classes at Guyan Valley High School for
60 days after she was convicted of allowing him to be a truant. She
began serving the sentence Monday.
   On Wednesday, Mrs. Brooks reported her son ill and said she
didn't expect him to return to class.
   ``He hates school,'' Mrs. Brooks said in a tearful interview
during her 35-minute lunch break Wednesday.
   Mrs. Brooks said her son had a bad experience in the first
grade, which she would not detail, and that he has disliked school
ever since.
   ``For one thing, he hates books,'' she said.
   Mrs. Brooks was sentenced by Lincoln County Magistrate Mona
Snodgrass last week after being found guilty of allowing her son to
skip class repeatedly over the past two to three years. She also
was fined $50.
   Lincoln County Assistant Prosecutor Fred Staker said Mrs. Brooks
is being punished under a section of state law that holds parents
responsible for sending their children to school. He said the
school-time punishment is used only as a last resort, when all
other attempts to persuade a child to return to class fail.
   Although Mrs. Brooks is required to attend each class, she
doesn't have to take tests or complete assignments.
   At one point Wednesday, Mrs. Brooks said being sentenced to
school had been ``hell,'' but she later said her experience has had
its good points. She left school after the ninth grade.
   ``I've enjoyed being here,'' she said. ``I think it's an honor
to go to school with him.''
   Principal Paul Winters said he did not know how many times Oscar
had missed class but said a truancy petition was filed against him
last year, leading to last week's magistrate court hearing.
   ``She's been more than helpful and cooperative with me,''
Winters said. ``She's here under a court order, but she hasn't been
a disruption or anything like that.''

   Chancellor Helmut Kohl told the first meeting of
unified Germany's Parliament that as they shape their new nation
Germans must never forget the Nazi Holocaust or the repression of
the East German Communists.
   For the first time in nearly six decades, German lawmakers met
in the Reichstag, prewar Germany's parliament building.
   The ceremonial session one day after unification brought
together 664 deputies - 520 from the West and 144 from the East -
who will serve until elections on Dec. 2.
   Today's session was only five minutes old when the opposition
Social Democrats heckled Parliament Speaker Rita Suessmuth, a
member of Kohl's Christian Democrats who opened the session.
   Kohl confronted a barrage of verbal attacks from Oskar
Lafontaine, the Social Democratic candidate for chancellor in the
December elections.
   Lafontaine, waving his glasses and motioning energetically,
criticized Kohl for his environmental policies and the cost of
unification.
   He read from a London newspaper article saying Kohl had made ``a
series of mistakes'' for promising not to raise taxes and for
allegedly giving East Germans an overly favorable rate for their
now-worthless East German marks.
   The chancellor sat three yards away, looking impassively
straight ahead.
   While most of the West Germans wore suits and well-tailored
dresses, some of the East Germans came more casually dressed.
   ``Quite frankly, I feel a little bit like a guest here,'' said
Gregor Gysi, who was leader of East Germany's reformed Communist
Party, told reporters while drinking coffee during a break before
his speech.
   In her opening speech, televised live, Ms. Suessmuth welcomed
the lawmakers to the newly refurbished chamber decorated with
flowers and with the huge eagle that symbolizes Germany.
   ``We remember all the victims of the Nazis and we remember the
victims of the SED regime (East Germany's ousted Communists), the
victims of the Berlin Wall and barbed wire,'' she said.
   The lawmakers then stood for a moment of silence.
   Kohl told them: ``We must never forget, suppress or play down
the crimes committed in this century by Germans. ... Above all we
owe this to the victims of the Holocaust, the unparalleled genocide
of European Jews.''
   The chancellor also condemned the Communists who until last
autumn ruled eastern Germany. He said their dictatorship and
repression had left behind ``wounds in people's hearts.''
   Billions of dollars are needed to rebuild the devastated economy
left by the Communists, and already the wealthy west is complaining
about the cost.
   ``It is now essential to ensure that Germany is also swiftly
reunited in economic and social terms,'' Kohl said. ``This will
call for great exertions, and we shall also have to make
sacrifices.''
   The Reichstag, still scarred by World War II, had not hosted
parliament since it was gutted by a mysterious fire on Feb. 27,
1933, one month after Adolf Hitler became chancellor.
   Leaders of the new Germany assured the world Wednesday, the
official day of unification, that it would strive for peace and
never forget the harsh lessons of its Nazi past.
   Unification officially came after midnight Tuesday, and Germans
across the new nation celebrated into Wednesday, their newest
national holiday.
   About 20,000 leftist radicals protesting unity rampaged in
Berlin on Wednesday. Police fired tear gas and water cannons in
street battles. About 40 people were injured and 246 arrested.
   Numerous heads of state from around the world sent cables of
congratulations to Chancellor Helmut Kohl and the German people.
   A goverment spokesman said Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, widely credited with making unification possible, will
visit Germany next month. A hero's welcome is expected.
   As the chancellor of a united Germany, Kohl's first big
political test comes in less than two weeks when elections are held
in eastern Germany for the governments of the five states that will
be added to the existing 11 in the West. The 16 states will form
the Federal Republic of Germany as the new country is formally
called.

   Iraqi troops kissed Saddam Hussein's hands as he took his first
known tour of occupied Kuwait, and officials said today that three
Britons and two Frenchmen had fled Iraq in a daring escape by boat.
   The five Europeans were found Wednesday by the Saudi coast guard
drifting in the small boat in a Persian Gulf shipping lane off the
Saudi-Kuwait border, British diplomats and Saudi officials said.
   The British escapees told London's Daily Mail newspaper that
they had spent 25 hours in rough seas after taking the 10-foot boat
through the marshes of southern Iraq, into the Shatt-al-Arab
waterway and then the gulf.
   It was the first report of Western men escaping Iraq since
August.
   The Britons said they had been working on a key oil installation
near the Iraqi port of Basra, and the two Frenchmen were barge
masters. They were among a small number of Europeans living on
dwindling food supplies and denied permission to leave.
   Iraq is holding about 2,200 Westerners hostage in Kuwait and
Iraq, some at strategic installations to discourage attack by the
U.S.-led military forces that began massing in the region after
Iraq seized Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Nine of those hostages - all Frenchmen - returned to Paris today
after being freed by Iraq. Also today, 173 Brazilians arrived home
after Brazil negotiated their release from Iraq.
   Saddam's visit to Kuwait coincided with the arrival in the
region of two foreign leaders and a top envoy seeking a peaceful
solution to the crisis.
   Yevgeny Primakov, a senior adviser to Soviet President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev, arrived in Baghdad today carrying a message from
Gorbachev, Soviet diplomatic sources said. Its contents were not
disclosed. In Moscow, Gorbachev said today he did not think the
crisis would lead to war, and he also told reporters he saw no
reason to send Soviet troops to the gulf.
   In the Jordanian capital, Amman, Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu of
Japan met today with Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Taha Yassin
Ramadan. Ramadan rejected a negotiated settlement to the gulf
crisis as long as foreign troops remain on Arab lands, Baghdad's
official Iraq News Agency reported.
   Kaifu insisted on Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait first, said
Shigeo Takenaka, Kaifu's spokesman. Kaifu later met with Jordan's
King Hussein, who has tried to mediate the dispute, even through
many of his people support Iraq.
   French President Francois Mitterrand, arriving in Saudi Arabia,
discussed the gulf crisis with King Fahd and met with French troops
in the U.S.-led multinational force.
   The U.S. aircraft carrier Independence and its battle group
steamed out of the gulf today, two days after entering the waterway
in a show of force to Iraq. The Independence, the first such
American warship in the gulf in 16 years, was headed to the Arabian
Sea, said a U.S. military source in the gulf. The source spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   The international community has tried to isolate Iraq as
punishment for the invasion. That has led Iraq to court its
neighbor and former foe, Iran, in hope of persuading it to break a
U.N. economic embargo by sending food and medicine.
   On Wednesday, Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati of Iran said
his country would keep out of a military confrontation between Iraq
and the U.S. forces.
   He said on Tehran television that ``force should be the last
possible resort for solving this crisis, but Iran will not
participate in this in any way.'' Iran has called for an Iraqi
withdrawal, but has also demanded the multinational force leave the
region.
   The United States has said the force will remain until Kuwait's
sovereignty is restored.
   The Pentagon says Iraq has massed 460,000 troops in Kuwait since
the multinational force began forming in the gulf region. The
United States now has about 170,000 troops in Saudi Arabia and on
ships in the area.
   Saddam's tour of Kuwait on Wednesday was his first known trip to
the country since Iraq invaded the emirate and declared it
Baghdad's 19th province.
   He talked with Iraqi troops and presided over two meetings of
military commanders, said the Iraqi News Agency, monitored in
Cyprus. It said the soldiers confirmed ``their ever-readiness for
sacrifice for Iraq and the Arab nation and defeating all evil
attempts to desecrate our sacred land.''
   In pictures of the visit broadcast by Iraqi television, Saddam
was shown getting into a foxhole as he discussed a machine gun
placement with a soldier. Iraqi troops kissed his hands.
   The footage also included scenes of all-but-deserted Kuwait City
streets, although a dispatch from the Iraqi News Agency said the
city ``glittered with pride'' at Saddam's visit. The agency said
Kuwait ``appeared flourishing after its return to the mother
homeland.''
   Refugees say Iraqi troops have pillaged Kuwait City and executed
resistance fighters, seeking to break the spirit of the Kuwaitis
and erase their national identity.
   An Australian newspaper said today Iraq has set up two
interrogation centers in Kuwait City that are being used to torture
prisoners. The Sydney Morning Herald quoted unidentified Western
diplomats and another source who said at least 230 mutilated bodies
had been removed from one site since August.

   A suspicious pre-dawn fire ravaged a crowded
inner city house today, killing three small children and two
adults, officials said.
   Police said the fire may have been set. Witnesses said they saw
a man flee the house about the time flames were spotted.
   About two dozen people were living in the 2{-story house on the
city's north side when the fire broke out on the first floor,
officials said.
   The victims who died were trapped in the house.
   The youngest victims were aged 5, 2 and 6 months. Information
about the adults who died was not immediately available.
   Arson investigators were trying to pinpoint the fire's cause,
which Police Lt. Roosevelt Harrell termed suspicious.
   The landlord, Leo Balderas, said he had rented the building to
eight people this summer and had no idea 24 people were living
there.
   The house had working smoke detectors, he added.

<HEAD>FBI Director's Statement Ordered; `Unaware' of Gay Agents</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The lawyer for a homosexual FBI agent who
has filed a discrimination suit over his firing says his client's
security clearance was revoked to provide a reason to get rid of
him.
   ``They used a security clearance as an excuse to get rid of the
gay person, assuming the court will defer'' in security matters,
said Richard Gayer, representing former agent Frank Buttino.
   Gayer made public on Wednesday a letter from FBI Director
William Sessions to a congressman saying that ``the issue of
homosexual conduct by employees of the FBI raises serious policy
considerations'' involving ``public trust and confidence.''
Sessions also wrote that he was unaware of any openly homosexual
agents.
   A federal magistrate ordered Wednesday that Sessions must say
whether he had anything to do with revoking Buttino's security
clearance.
   Buttino, 45, was fired in June after 20 years with the FBI. His
security clearance, required for all agents, had been revoked the
previous month.
   In papers seeking to dismiss his suit, the Justice Department
said Buttino's clearance was lifted not because he was homosexual,
but because he had lied repeatedly to FBI investigators and placed
himself in a position that was vulnerable to coercion.
   Buttino said those explanations are a pretext for an
anti-homosexual policy that the FBI is unwilling to acknowledge. He
told reporters Wednesday that he has learned through contacts in
Washington that the FBI investigates and dismisses 50 homosexuals a
year.
   The only lie he told - in hopes of saving his career - was to
deny initially to investigators in 1988 that he had written a
letter to another person that indicated his homosexuality, Buttino
said. The letter was forwarded to the FBI by an anonymous person.
   Buttino said he met with investigators two months later and
volunteered that he had written the letter and that he was
homosexual.
   Buttino's lawyer sought permission to question Sessions about
the FBI's policies and about the director's meeting early this year
with Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., chairman of the House Judiciary
Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights.
   Edwards later sent Sessions a letter mentioning that they had
discussed Buttino's case and asking about the FBI's policies on
homosexuals.
   U.S. Magistrate Wayne Brazil said he had seen no evidence in the
case that would justify requiring the Sessions to submit to
questioning.
   But Brazil said Sessions must submit a sworn statement in
writing within 30 days saying whether he had any involvement in the
decision to revoke Buttino's clearance.
   Gayer gave reporters Sessions' Sept. 6 letter to Edwards in
which the director denied that homosexual conduct was automatic
grounds for firing.
   ``However, where sexual conduct, whether homosexual or
heterosexual, reflects a lack of judgment or discretion or a
susceptibility to undue influence or duress, the granting or
retention of a security clearance would not be consistent with the
interests of national security,'' Sessions wrote.

   A helicopter plucked the red star from
the roof of the Socialist Party headquarters Thursday, a month
after a crowd torched the building to back up demands for removal
of the symbol of Communist oppression.
   The star perched atop the partially gutted structure in downtown
Sofia was hoisted up by the helicopter at 9:30 a.m. to applause
from some of the 100 people gathered outside. Crews had spent two
days loosening it from the roof.
   Torch-carrying youths broke away from a large demonstration near
the building on Aug. 26, breaking its windows and setting curtains
and furniture inside ablaze. The fire burned for hours before it
was brought under control.
   The attack on the building capped an emotional weekslong

Communists, demanding that all symbols of former Communist rule be
removed from public view.

   Three workers conducting tests at a nuclear power
plant were lightly contaminated with radioactive iodine, the
national nuclear safety agency said Thursday.
   The accident occurred Wednesday at the Golfech plant near
Bordeaux, where the men had spent two days testing filters, the
agency said in a communique.
   The agency said the light radioactive dosage received by the men
was unlikely to cause harm. But it said one man was taken to the
agency's headquarters near Paris for additional testing.
   Officials at Golfech said the iodine apparently leaked out
during an annual injection procedure intended to maintain the
efficiency of carbon filters at the plant.

   Former Defense Minister Alexej
Cepicka, who was expelled from the Communist Party in the 1960s for
his support of Stalinist policies, has died, the state news agency
CTK reported Thursday. He was 80.
   No cause of death was given for Cepicka, son in law of former
Czechoslovak Communist leader Klement Gottwald. Cepicka died
Sunday.
   He became defense minister in 1950, but was dismissed from the
post in 1956. He was expelled from the party in 1963 for his role
in the ``deformations of the 50s,'' CTK said, alluding to the
Stalinist period in Czechoslovakia.
   Also Thursday, the urn with Gottwald's remains was removed from
the National Memorial of Zizkov in Prague and given to the
representatives of the Communist Party, CTK said.
   Government officials attended the act. The memorial continues to
house the remains of most other Czechoslovak presidents of the
Communist era, along with those of nationally renowned artists and
literary figures.
   There was no explanation of why Gottwald's urn was the only one
removed, but the move likely was related to his unpopularity among
most Czechoslovaks. The country's first Communist president,
Gottwald is widely blamed for the Stalinist repression of the
immediate post-war years.

   Industrialist Charanjit Singh, who
headed a soft drink company and built one of New Delhi's most
opulent hotels, died Thursday of a heart attack. He was 51.
   Singh, who was on the board of directors of the state-owned
Indian Airlines and Air India, also served a term in Parliament in
1980.
   Singh's Pure Drinks Co. was in partnership with Coca Cola until
the multinational firm was evicted from India in 1977 for refusing
to divulge the secret formula for Coke.
   He later joined with other Indian beverage companies in an
unsuccessful bid to keep out Pepsi Cola, which put its drink on the
Indian market earlier this year.
   Coke sued Pure Drinks for marketing its own Campa Cola in a
bottle too similar to Coke's well-known style. In an out-of-court
settlement last March, Singh agreed to use a redesigned bottle.
   Singh also was embattled over his 5-year-old hotel, Le Meridien,
which was heavily in debt and was threatened by a government
takeover for failure to pay rent.

<HEAD>Two Men Convicted of Laundering Drug Money with Noriega's Banker</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A court convicted a British financier on Thursday
of conspiring with the personal banker of Panamanian Gen. Manuel
Noriega to launder drug money.
   ``The banking community in London has got to learn the message
that they are not to deal with drug money,'' Judge Michael Parker
said in convicting Syed Akbar.
   Akbar, 46, was given an 18-month jail sentence and ordered to
pay $94,500.
   He was the second of two London financiers to be convicted in
connection with drug money laundering. Last month, a court
sentenced Asif Baakza, 40, to two years on the same conspiracy
charge, but suspended half the sentence.
   Both men worked in the corporate unit of the Bank of Credit and
Commerce International, and were convicted of conspiring with Amjad
Awan and Akbar Bilgrami, BCCI officials in Miami.
   Awan, who once worked for the bank in Panama, told a U.S. Senate
subcommittee that he kept a secret bank account for Noriega. The
deposed Panamanian leader is awaiting trial in the United States on
drug charges.
   Juries in the trials of Akbar and Baakza heard tapes made
clandestinely in a U.S. Customs Service sting operation. On the
tapes, the two financiers agreed to help in ``processing'' drug
money.
   Baakza was said to have accepted about $1 million which was
later withdrawn in the Bahamas under the guise of a loan. Akbar was
said to have laundered drug money into gold on the London Futures
Market.
   Both men were arrested by British customs officers shortly after
arrests were made in the United States in October 1988.
   BCCI pleaded guilty in the United States earlier this year to
laundering cash. A number of people, including Awan and Bilgrami,
were found guilty and are awaiting sentencing.

   Hundreds of people protesting alleged police
corruption threw rocks at rows of police guarding a police station
in Osaka today, the third day of street violence, which is rare in
Japan.
   About 1,500 riot police were mobilized late today in response to
the unrest in which at least 54 people have been injured -
including 30 policemen - and 25 arrested in the western Japanese
city, police said.
   The violence began on Tuesday following news reports that a
local officer took a bribe from a gangster. Although the policeman
has not admitted guilt, an Osaka police official issued an apology
today in an attempt to ease the tension, according to the Kyodo
News Service.
   But there was no immediate sign of lessening tensions.
   Since Tuesday, residents of the low-income Nishinari district
have surrounded the area police station, burning cars and throwing
rocks and beer bottles, police said. At its peak Wednesday, the
crowd reached about 1,500.
   Several gangs operate in the Nishinari district, and the crime
rate is higher than average, police said. Locals say there have
been bad feelings between area residents and police, who have
adopted harsh tactics to battle crime, including a 24-hour
surveillance camera system on street corners.
   The rioters, mostly menial and day laborers, burned 20
automobiles parked nearby Wednesday night. More than 1,000 police
were mobilized to block protesters from reaching the Nishinari
police station.
   Tonight about 700 demonstrators confronted riot police in front
of the station. Rioters, most of them high school-age youths,
intermittantly lunged from the crowd and threw rocks and
firecrackers at police.
   Such street violence is seldom seen in Japan, where public
issues rarely inflame passions. In recent years, there have been
few disturbances besides occasional battles between leftist
extremists who oppose expansion of Narita Airport outside of Tokyo
and riot police.
   The chief of the Osaka police headquarters, Masahiro
Tsubakihara, issued an apology at the local legislature today in
response to reports that an officer was involved in scandal, Kyodo
reported.
   The violence began following news reports Tuesday that a police
sergeant was suspected of having taken about $22,000 in bribes from
a local gangster in exchange for leaking information on police
operations.
   ``Come out dirty policemen. We will not stand this any longer,''
Kyodo News Service quoted one worker as shouting at the police
headquarters as he hurled rocks.
   Local news reports said the officer allegedly leaked information
on police operations to the gang in return for the money.

   FORT-DE-FRANCE, Martinique (AP) - Tropical Storm Klaus spawned
torrential rain and severe flooding on this French island in the
Caribbean today, leaving at least two people dead and four missing,
authorities said.
   The storm, with winds of 60 mph, was centered about 140 miles
north of Martinique and prompted tropical storm warnings and
watches throughout the Leeward Islands. It was the 11th named storm
of the Atlantic hurricane season.
   Among the missing in Martinique were two sisters, aged eight and
14, who were swept from a flooded bridge Wednesday in St. Joseph in
the center of the island. Rescuers were searching for the girls
today.
   The bodies of two men were found late Wednesday. Authorities
said one of the victims was a 56-year-old farmer, who fell from a
tractor into a flooded ditch. Circumstances of the second man's
death were unclear, but it was believed he also drowned in
floodwaters that reached nearly 10 feet in places.
   Two fishermen were reported missing today in Riviere Pilote, in
the southeastern part of the island. Officials told Radio Caribbean
International that the local outdoor market and soccer stadium were
under 5.5 feet of water.
   Many houses were flooded in the northern part of the island,
which was particularly hard hit. Schools were closed throughout the
island. Flooding disrupted telephone and electrical service.
   Martinique, a popular tourist spot, is an overseas department of
France with a population of 336,000 people.
   Klaus remained almost stationary during the night and this
morning. At noon EDT its center was near 16.6 north latitude and
60.5 west longitude, or about 95 miles east-southeast of Antigua,
the Hurricane Center in Miami said.
   The storm was expected to resume a northwestward drift later
today and pickup strength over the next 24 hours, the Hurricane
Center said.
   ``It's far enough off ... so that if it stays on that track it
won't move directly over the Leeward Islands. But just a little jog
to the west and it certainly could hit some of the islands,'' said
hurricane specialist Max Mayfield.
   ``Right now, there wouldn't be that much (damage) from the wind,
the biggest damage would be done by the rainfall. They could have
as much as 10 to 15 inches of rainfall,'' he said. ``But they could
really have a problem with mudslides and flash floods.''
   Tropical storm warnings were issued for the islands of the
northeast Caribbean, including St. Martin, St. Barthelemy, Saba,
St. Eustatius, Antigua and Barbuda, Anguilla, the British Virgin
Islands, Montserrat and St. Kitts-Nevis.
   A tropical storm watch was in effect for the island of
Guadeloupe and the neighboring French islands, according to the
National Hurricane Center in suburban Coral Gables.

<TEXT>
   A British fighter pilot's log book recording the
shooting down of ``Red Baron'' Manfred von Richthoven in World War
I was sold Thursday for $5,700.
   The auction house Christie's said a businessman in the northern
English city of Manchester bought the log book in a telephone bid
at the sale of aviation art and literature held at the Commonwealth
Institute. The buyer wanted to remain anonymous.
   The log book belonged to a friend of the late Lt. Lionel Lomas,
a member of the flight led by Capt. Roy Brown, a Canadian, who is
credited with shooting down the famous German ace behind British
lines over the Somme battlefield in 1918.
   Richthofen was known as the ``Red Baron'' because his Fokker
triplane was painted red. He was credited with 80 victories.
   The log records that on April 21, 1918, 14 British Camel
fighters attacked 24 enemy planes, shooting down three, and that
Brown brought down Richthofen.
   The claim was contested by Australian troops who said they shot
down Richthofen when they fired on his plane from the ground as it
flew low, pursued by Brown.
   ``We think the log book kept by another pilot is good evidence
to support Brown,'' said Susan Adams of Christie's South Kensington
salesroom.
   ``We have never had a log book from the First World War in a
sale here before and because of von Richthofen's fame we had many
inquiries about it from Europe, Australia and Canada, as well as
Britain,'' she said.
   Bidding began at $1,890 and went up in $189 increases. The final
price was double the pre-sale estimate.

   Success is sorely needed in shuttle
Discovery's mission with the disputed, nuclear-powered probe
Ulysses, said NASA, which encountered yet another problem today.
   A 70-pound metal beam, measuring 8-feet-11-inches long, was
found inside another shuttle's engine compartment, where workers
mistakenly had left it.
   NASA workers heard the beam bang around Atlantis' engine
compartment as the orbiter was being raised into a vertical
position inside the assembly building on Wednesday, NASA spokesan
Bruce Buckingham said today.
   They were unable to open the engine compartment until today,
after the solid rocket boosters and external tank were attached to
the orbiter.
   Officials were assessing the damage, and an investigative team
was being formed. It was not known whether the accident would
affect Atlantis' secret military flight in early November,
Buckingham said.
   The mission already is four months late because of Atlantis'
hydrogen leaks.
   Discovery was scheduled to blast off at 7:35 a.m. EDT Saturday
to launch the solar probe on a 1.86 billion-mile journey spanning
five years. The countdown began Wednesday and proceeded without
mishap.
   NASA test director Mike Leinbach said today two computer circuit
cards in Discovery's mobile launcher need to be replaced, a minor
job.
   ``Other than that, it's very clean,'' he said.
   The space agency's inability to launch a shuttle in nearly half
a year because of technical glitches heightens the need for a
successful mission, said Edward Smith, NASA project scientist for
Ulysses.
   ``I think it's very, very important, considering all the
problems that NASA has had,'' Smith said. ``We'd certainly love to
have a success. It gets everybody's morale back up. It adds to
their confidence.''
   Ulysses, a European Space Agency probe, has been ready for a
ride since 1983. After several delays that included changes in the
satellite's upper stage rockets, the mission was set for May 1986
but was put back on hold after the shuttle Challenger exploded
earlier that year.
   ``We've never gotten this close before,'' Smith said. ``I think
all of us are excited and apprehensive at the same time.''
   Anti-nuclear and environmental activists, however, want the $750
million mission canceled for safety reasons.
   They oppose NASA's use of nearly 23.7 pounds of deadly plutonium
in a generator attached to Ulysses. As it decays, the plutonium
will provide electricity for the satellite.
   A hearing was scheduled for late today in Washington before U.S.
District Judge Oliver Gasch, who last year refused to halt
Atlantis' launch with a plutonium-powered satellite bound for
Jupiter.
   Peter Wenzel, project scientist for the European Space Agency,
said a plutonium generator is the only means of getting Ulysses
into an orbit over the sun's poles.
   NASA officials said there is little chance plutonium would be
released and, if it did, would pose little health risk.
   The 807-pound spacecraft will be hurtled toward Jupiter, which
will give Ulysses a gravity assist and push it out of the ecliptic
plane. If all goes well, it will become the first spacecraft to
pass over the solar poles.
   ``Everybody is quite optimistic that many of our views about the
sun and the solar system will be absolutely revolutionized,'' Smith
said.
   Columbia has been grounded by hydrogen leaks since May; none of
its four countdowns in four months proceeded past fueling. Atlantis
has been crippled by leaking hydrogen since June.
   Discovery was the last shuttle to fly when it carried the Hubble
Space Telescope into orbit in April. Although the flight went
smoothly, NASA suffered harsh criticism when the telescope's
primary mirror was found to be flawed.
   NASA officials are confident Discovery will not spring any leaks
when more than a half-million gallons of liquid hydrogen and liquid
oxygen are pumped into the shuttle Friday night.
   Discovery boasts top-of-the-line plumbing that has been checked
thoroughly. In addition, hardly any work was performed in
Discovery's main engine compartment after its last flight.

   An art gallery director on trial for
displaying Robert Mapplethorpe's work says graphic photographs at
the center of the obscenity case are ``tough, brutal, sometimes
disgusting'' - but worthwhile art.
   The nation's first obscenity trial of an art gallery and its
director was expected to go to the jury by early Friday after
rebuttal testimony from the prosecution and closing arguments. But
today's proceedings were delayed by a defense challenge of the
credentials of a rebuttal witness for the prosecution.
   ``We're in a holding pattern,'' Hamilton County Municipal Court
Judge David Albanese told jurors. ``We're not under any pressure to
rush it, and we hope you're not under any pressure to rush it.''
   The prosecution wanted to present testimony by Judith Reisman, a
former producer for the old ``Captain Kangaroo'' TV show and author
of a 1,600-page study on children, crime and violence.
   Defense lawyers said Ms. Reisman lacked the qualifications to be
a witness.
   Dennis Barrie, director of the Contemporary Arts Center, scoffed
Wednesday at a prosecutor's suggestion that he and the gallery
showed an exhibit of Mapplethorpe's photographs as a publicity
stunt.
   ``This has been a strain on all of us, a strain on me personally
and a strain on my family,'' Barrie testified. ``But we were very
committed to the principle at stake here.''
   Barrie and the gallery were charged April 7 with pandering
obscenity and using children in nudity-related material, both
misdemeanors. The trial is focused on seven of 175 photos in the
exhibit, ``Robert Mapplethorpe: The Perfect Moment.''
   Three of the photos show penetration of a man's anus with
various objects. One shows a man urinating in another man's mouth.
A fifth shows penetration of a penis with a pinkie finger and two
show children with their genitals exposed.
   Barrie said some of the acts depicted in the show were ``tough,
brutal, sometimes disgusting,'' but part of the photographic
challenge Mapplethorpe accepted in trying to create a work of art.
   ``As difficult as the subject matter may be, you see the ability
of the man working through. He was brilliant with a camera,''
Barrie said.
   ``Every standard I had in terms of art exhibitions said this was
a perfectly fine exhibition and there should be no change in the
way the exhibition was presented.''
   Mapplethorpe, who was known for pursuing homosexual themes, died
of AIDS in March 1989 at age 42.
   The exhibit set an attendance record - 81,000 - for an art
exhibit in Cincinnati during a seven-week run at the gallery ending
in May. The show closes this week in Boston, where 103,000 tickets
have been sold.
   In January 1989, the Contemporary Art Center's board endorsed
Barrie's proposal to schedule an exhibit of Mapplethorpe photos.
   In June 1989, three months after Mapplethorpe died, Sen. Jesse
Helms, R-N.C., disputed use of National Endowment of the Arts
funding for work that might be considered obscene.
   Barrie said the board talked about the controversy and decided
to go ahead with the exhibit.
   The board's legal counsel, Stuart Schloss Jr., testified earlier
Wednesday that the board tried to get legal protection before the
show. The board filed a lawsuit asking the court to rule whether
the exhibit was obscene, but the case was dismissed the day before
the public opening of the exhibit in Cincinnati.
   After Barrie's testimony, Albanese refused a defense request to
dismiss the charges. Defense lawyers argued the prosecution never
proved its case.
   The U.S. Supreme Court's legal test for an obscenity
determination asks whether the dominant theme of the artwork
appeals to prurient interest in sex, whether the work is patently
offensive based on contemporary community standards, and whether
the work lacks serious artistic or political value.
   If convicted of both charges, Barrie could be sentenced to one
year in jail and fined $2,000. The gallery could be fined $10,000
for conviction on both counts.

<HEAD>Navy Stops Sudanese Freighter From Entering Gulf of Aqaba</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A U.S. Navy guided missile frigate prevented a
Sudanese freighter from entering the Gulf of Aqaba today after a
boarding party found that its cargo manifest did not account for
all of its cargo, the Pentagon announced.
   Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said no shots were fired.
   Williams said a party from the frigate Samuel B. Roberts boarded
the 12,900-ton Blue Nile, registered to the Sudanese Shipping Line,
in the Northern Red Sea.
   Williams said it was the seventh time a U.S. ship had diverted a
vessel as part of the enforcement of the United Nations embargo on
most shipping to Iraq and Kuwait.
   He said the vessel was a roll-on, roll-off ship carrying mostly
industrial equipment.
   ``The problem that resulted in the diversion was that the
maniest on board the ship did not indicate the shipper and
destination for all the cargo found during the boarding,'' Williams
said.
   He said he did not know where the Sudanese ship headed after
agreeing not to enter the Gulf of Aqaba. He said Navy personnel
left the ship after the diversion.
   Williams said there had been 170 boardings since the beginning
of the embargo, 139 of them by U.S. ships.
   He said 1,675 ships had been intercepted.

<HEAD>Elizabeth Dole A Big Draw on GOP Fund-Raising Circuit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KAREN BALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When President Bush scrapped a New England
campaign swing to lobby Congress for a deficit-reduction plan, the
White House scrambled for a popular Cabinet secretary to take his
place.
   The president's political operatives quickly settled on Labor
Secretary Elizabeth Dole, consistently a big draw on the national
campaign scene.
   ``She's warm, sincere and one of the best campaigners I've ever
seen,'' said Steve Beaujon, a spokesman for Gary Franks'
congressional campaign in Connecticut.
   Bush had been scheduled to appear for Franks on Thursday in
Waterbury, Conn., but Mrs. Dole was asked to make the trip instead.
She also was asked to step in for Bush at a $1,000-a-plate luncheon
in Boston to raise money for the Massachusetts GOP, gubernatorial
candidate William Weld and Senate candidate James Rappaport.
   Mrs. Dole, 54, is campaigning in more than a dozen states this
fall for more than 60 gubernatorial and House and Senate
candidates.
   Among Bush's Cabinet secretaries, she's at the top of the list
of campaigners that GOP candidates eye when scouting for big names
to invigorate rank-and-file party members, Republican officials
said. Jack Kemp, secretary of housing and urban development, also
is in high demand.
   ``She gets down off of the pedestal and she becomes one of the
many,'' said Hillard Selck, a Republican National Committeeman from
Missouri.
   ``There's no `Stay away from me, stay behind the barrier, I'm
too good for you.' That impresses people. They like to be able to
touch,'' Selck said.
   Sen. Pete Wilson of California has lured Mrs. Dole in twice
since July to help his gubernatorial race. He's made a bid to have
her back for a third swing right before the November election.
   On her last visit to help Wilson, 600 tickets for a $100-a-plate
dinner sold out, netting Wilson a quick $50,000 or more that
evening, said campaign manager Otto Bos.
   Mrs. Dole also has campaigned for Rep. Lynn Martin in Illinois,
who is trying to unseat Democratic Sen. Paul Simon; Gov. Kay Orr in
Nebraska, running for re-election; Clayton Williams, bidding for
the governorship in Texas; Gov. Mike Hayden, seeking a second term
in Kansas; and Rep. Claudine Schneider of Rhode Island, attempting
to oust Democratic Sen. Claiborne Pell.
   Part of her draw, Republicans say, is that Mrs. Dole herself is
a GOP success story. The Harvard-educated lawyer served as
President Reagan's transportation secretary before Bush nabbed her
for the Labor Department post.
   ``She's a good speaker and very dynamic. Here you have a prime
example of someone who is a pro, who excels at what she does. To
have someone like that showcased for you is a plus,'' Bos said.
   Mrs. Dole is not without critics.
   Champions of workers' rights give her credit for resurrecting an
agency widely considered a nonentity during the Reagan era. Yet
they also wonder if some of her projects - such as well-publicized
crackdowns on child labor violators and mandatory seat belts for
job-related travel - carry much substance.
   ``I don't think anyone in the administration signifies the
dichotomy within the White House better than Liddy Dole,'' said
Rep. Pat Williams, D-Mont. ``She presents a kinder and gentler
face, but precious little decision-making or leadership.''
   Joseph Kinney, who runs the National Safe Workplace Institute, a
private watchdog group in Chicago, contended that Mrs. Dole's
pledge to improve worker safety is ``all bark and no bite.''
   Still, despite her skeptics, Mrs. Dole has few enemies on
Capitol Hill.
   She dismisses speculation that she plans to step down to run for
the North Carolina Senate seat now held by Terry Sanford, a
first-term Democrat up for re-election in 1992.
   ``I have plenty of challenges right where I am,'' Mrs. Dole said
during a recent interview from her Labor Department office.
   ``One politician in the family's probably enough for the time
being,'' she said, referring to her husband, Senate Minority Leader
Bob Dole of Kansas. But she didn't rule out a future bid for some
type of elective job.
   ``That's not to say that some time, at some point ... I think if
you're a person who enjoys people, who has been in the political
system all your life, that's a possibility ... but I have no plans
to do that now,'' she said.

   The USS Independence, the first American
aircraft carrier to enter the Persian Gulf in 16 years, headed out
of the waterway today after a brief show of force.
   The carrier and its battle group entered the waterway on
Tuesday.
   The 79,000-ton Independence left through the Strait of Hormuz,
the narrow outlet of the gulf, in the early afternoon.
   The carrier and its battle group were sailing out to the Arabian
Sea, said a U.S. military source in the region who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   In Washington, a Defense Department public affairs officer, Lt.
Cmdr. Edward Lundquist, confirmed that the Independence and its
crew had left the gulf because ``they completed their operation
there.''
   Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said, ``We consider the mission
of the Independence in the gulf a success. The mission was to
demonstrate to our friends and allies in the region that it is
possible to put a carrier in the gulf and carry out operations.
Those were the goals, and they were accomplished.'' He said flight
operations were carried out.
   He declined to say what the Independence would do next.
   The carrier, with at least 70 aircraft aboard, had been inside
the gulf on a training mission. Few details had been publicized.
   The gulf voyage was seen as a way of showing Saddam Hussein the
extent of the U.S. naval air power in the U.S.-led military buildup
confronting him.
   The Independence was ``not meant in any way to increase regional
tensions,'' Lt. Cmdr. Mark Walker, a Navy spokesman, had said
earlier. He said its presence was ``a visible demonstration of the
operational capabilities of a carrier battle group to our friends
and allies in the region.''
   The Independence had been in the northern Arabian Sea since
July, before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   Aircraft carriers rarely enter the gulf because it is a
restricted body of water that has a high volume of shipping,
leaving little room for maneuvering. There is also only one outlet,
the Strait of Hormuz. In addition, its aircraft can reach Iraq and
Kuwait even when the carrier is outside the gulf.
   The last U.S. aircraft carrier to enter the gulf was the
Constellation in 1974.

<HEAD>Dartmouth Students, Faculty, Administrators to Protest Student
Paper</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Two trustees of The Dartmouth Review
apologized today for an anti-Semitic quote that appeared in the
off-campus weekly, but they also criticized the college president
for creating a ``lynch-mob mentality.''
   Students, faculty and others at the Ivy League school planned to
rally in protest of the quote by the independent paper, known for
its attacks on minorities. President James Freedman and other top
administrators planned to speak.
   The newspaper infuriated Jews by printing a quote from Adolf
Hitler in its latest edition. That edition was distributed
Saturday, Yom Kippur, the Jewish Day of Atonement and Judaism's
most solemn day.
   The quotation, from Hitler's ``Mein Kampf,'' was inserted
unattributed into the statement of principles on The Review's
masthead: ``Therefore, I believe today that I am acting in the
sense of the Almighty Creator: By warding off the Jews, I am
fighting for the Lord's work.''
   Backlash from the quote prompted the resignation of the Review's
president and two staffers.
   Student officials of the independent newspaper said the quote
was put in by an unknown staffer without the authorization or
knowledge of editors. One called it ``sabotage,'' and the paper
offered ``heartfelt apologies to Jews at Dartmouth and to the
Dartmouth community at large.''
   Trustees Dinesh D'Souza and Wendy Stone apologized at a news
conference called by the Review today.
   D'Souza lashed out at Freedman. He called Freedman a ``bully ...
who has contributed to the lynch-mob mentality on campus.''
   He said Freedman and other administrators have manipulated the
case to ruin the lives of the staffers at the Review.
   He said the trustees will contact the Jewish organization B'nai
Brith to send someone to Dartmouth to help investigate the
incident.
   Editor in Chief Kevin Pritchett, who also has taken over as
president, said he ``should have been more vigilant. I will do
everything in my power to find the person who did this.''
   Pritchard said that, if anything, the paper is pro-Israel.
   Alumni and even congressmen protested the incident, some saying
conservatives who've supported the Review should withdraw that
support.
   About 2,000 members of the campus community signed positions
denouncing the quote.
   It was not the first time the paper has attacked Jews. In 1988,
the Review ran a column likening Freedman - who is Jewish - to
Hitler and the effects of his campus policies to the Holocaust.
   On Tuesday, U.S. Rep. Chester Atkins, D-Mass., asked his
Republican challenger in the general election, John MacGovern, to
resign from the Review's board of directors. Atkins called the
newspaper ``nothing more than a fountain of venom.''
   MacGovern, an 1980 graduate of Dartmouth and one of the Review's
founders, said he would not resign unless a senior editor was found
responsible for putting the quote in.
   A day later, an angry open letter to the Review's advisory board
signed by 84 congressmen was obtained by The Associated Press.
   The letter, which originated in the office of Reps. Mel Levine,
D-Calif., called the paper's actions ``inexcusable and offensive,''
and said ``the time has come to end all alumni and public support
for The Review.''
   Students have published the Review since 1980. In their numerous
clashes with the school's administration, they have enjoyed backing
from some of the nation's most prominent conservatives.
   The Review's 10-member advisory board includes syndicated
columnist Patrick Buchanan and former U.S. Rep. James Cleveland,
R-N.H.
   In their letter, the congressmen said conservatives ``should no
longer dirty their hands with this kind of anti-Semitic, racist
rhetoric.''
   The letter said the Review should not be censored, but that
anyone who supports the paper financially or otherwise must
understand that by doing so they support its views.

   Convicted bank robber Dannie Martin has broken
the rules most of his life, so he's not intimidated by prison
regulations affecting his writing for the San Francisco Chronicle.
   A recent court ruling upheld U.S. Bureau of Prisons regulations
that say a federal prisoner can't be paid for writing for a
newspaper, can't be given a byline and can't ``act as a reporter.''
   The ruling is being appealed, and Martin continues to write the
features and commentary about prison life that have fascinated
Chronicle readers since 1986.
   He's not getting paid and his stories don't carry a byline. But
he says he risks additional jail time if he is found to have acted
as a reporter.
   ``I've been an outlaw so long and saw myself that way, I've
usually been against what rules they had anyway, so that doesn't
bother me as much as it would a square,'' said Martin, a former
drug abuser who has spent 25 of his 51 years in prison.
   ``I think the heart of the problem here, what really gets them
worried, is the experiences of prison, the things that happen in
here, have never been defined in a mainstream newspaper,'' said
Martin, who is 10 years into a 33-year sentence for two bank
robberies in Washington state.
   Martin has written more than 40 essays about prison life for the
Chronicle's Sunday Punch section since 1986.
   He spent time in solitary confinement at the federal
penitentiary in Lompoc, Calif., after he wrote an article in June
1988 that warned of a possible riot because of restrictions imposed
by a new warden.
   Shortly after that, he was transferred to the federal prison in
Phoenix. Martin and the Chronicle then filed suit to challenge the
rules the Bureau of Prisons said he violated.
   U.S. District Judge Charles Legge ruled in June that the
regulations were justified by the bureau's authority over prison
security. He said outside newspaper reporting by inmates could
cause rifts within a prison and improperly focus attention on
individual inmates.
   Dan Dunne, a spokesman for the Bureau of Prisons, said the rules
were made for security reasons long before Martin started writing
for the Chronicle.
   ``Reporting for a newspaper from the inside can focus attention
on individuals. And when you focus on individual prisoners, it
could lead to violence or unrest or create situations where you
have tension within the prison,'' Dunne said.
   Free speech advocates say the rules infringe on freedom of the
press by denying the Chronicle its editorial discretion in
soliciting free-lance work, purchasing outside articles and
deciding who merits a byline.
   For their efforts to overturn the regulations, Martin and his
Chronicle editor, Peter Sussman, are to be cited by the Society of
Professional Journalists at the group's national convention Oct.
12.
   ``As the criminal justice system is collapsing all around us, it
is important that we hear articulate voices from inside the prison.
It's clear that the government does not want us to hear those
voices,'' said Bruce W. Sanford, a Washington, D.C., lawyer who is
the journalism group's First Amendment counsel.
   Since the ruling, the Chronicle has published articles by
Martin, without his byline, describing the prison system's war on
drug smuggling and a fellow prisoner's ordeal when he was wrongly
accused of having swallowed contraband drugs. Martin said he is
working on a story on how prisoners react to very long sentences.
   He said the courts should throw out the regulations he is
challenging because the prison system has enough other rules in
place - against lying or inciting a riot - to curb abuses by
inmates writing for newspapers.
   ``They let people write books and get the money for it, or sell
leather goods or paint pictures. That rule (against compensation)
is ridiculous. There's no logical reason for it,'' Martin said.
   The prohibition on bylines is ``nothing but a thinly veiled
attempt to destroy my credibility,'' he said. ``My readers know me
and they know that's me writing. But if I hadn't established that,
they'd be saying, `Who is this guy and why is he saying these
things?' I wouldn't have any credibility.''
   Martin said he would like to get a job as a journalist when he
leaves prison. He's up for parole in February 1992.

   A man was jailed for investigation in
a series of sex assaults that included bizarre ritualistic acts on
at least three women.
   The attacker identified himself as ``St. Peter, the messenger of
the Lord'' before sexually assaulting the women. He also used a
knife with an 8-inch blade to carve upside down crosses in their
backs.
   The rapist also hacked off the victims' hair with the knife,
saying he would ``present their hair to God in order to cleanse
their souls,'' said police spokesman Jay Fogg. The rapist threw the
victims nude from his car.
   Joseph Brian Socha, 29, was arrested Wednesday. Detectives acted
with the help of a person who recognized Socha from news reports.
   Three women reported the rapist picked them up in a Volvo. Socha
himself drives Volvo with a vanity plate with the letters
``GIMMEMO.''
   Socha was arrested in his rented room in Rancho Palos Verdes, a
wealthy seaside community. He had been a renter about two weeks and
told his landlord he was a college student.
   Socha was booked for investigation of rape, sodomy, forced oral
copulation, kidnap and assault with a deadly weapon. He was jailed
in Los Angeles in lieu of $50,000 bail.
   The rapes occurred in and around Long Beach on Sept. 16, 21 and
28.
   The victims all entered the man's car voluntarily, investigators
said. Two women said they were hitchhiking and the third said she
accepted a ride.

   A 35-year-old federal prosecutor who is said
to be a descendant of Thomas Jefferson has been nominated to become
a federal judge.
   Timothy K. Lewis was selected for the lifetime appointment from
a field of four candidates by Sens. John Heinz III and Arlen
Specter, R-Pa. The candidates were chosen in July by the Federal
Judicial Nominating Commission.
   ``I'm a very fortunate man,'' Lewis said after the nomination.
   Lewis, who is black, is a descendant of Lewis Woodson, who
settled in the Pittsburgh area in 1831. Woodson was the son of
Thomas Woodson, who was said to be the son of Jefferson and Sally
Hemmings, a slave believed to have been the mistress of the third
U.S. president.
   The nomination now goes to the Justice Department, which will
conduct a background check before forwarding Lewis' name to the
Senate for consideration. An aide to Heinz said the process
probably will take about six months.
   If confirmed, Lewis would succeed Senior U.S. District Judge
Paul A. Simmons, who announced this week he will retire at the
close of the year.
   Lewis has been an assistant U.S. attorney since 1983. He also
spent three years as an assistant district attorney in Allegheny
County.

   Eric Sorlien didn't want to sugar-coat
Philadelphia's problems. But he did anyway.
   Sorlien cooked up a sarcastic entry for a cake-baking contest
organized to celebrate the re-lighting of the restored City Hall
tower Wednesday night.
   Sorlien's chocolate representation of City Hall was complete
with construction scaffolding and plastic rats and and pigeons.
   The tower's clock was carefully frosted to show 11:55.
   ``Midnight is bankruptcy,'' Sorlien said, referring to the
city's money woes.
   Dinosaurs bearing the transit agency's logo prowled below.
   ``I'm trying to bring attention to Philadelphia's problems,''
said Sorlien, 22.
   But on the drive in from suburban King of Prussia, Sarlien
encountered some of the city's potholes and his cake tower toppled.
He entered it anyway.
   Judges chuckled at his entry but gave it no prizes.
   Sorlien said he wasn't concerned about what city officials might
think.
   ``I've never seen Mayor (W. Wilson) Goode hit anybody, so I'm
not worried about that,'' he said.

   David H. Souter said today he realizes the
enormity of the task he will face when he joins the U.S. Supreme
Court next week. ``Nothing prepares a person for the
responsibilities of that court,'' he said.
   ``So many of the justices have said or written that ... and I
know that's going to be true in my case,'' Souter said. ``I can
feel it already.''
   He said he will get a jump on his high court career by reading
briefs this weekend - when he's not house-hunting in the nation's
capital.
   ``I will get the briefs read,'' Souter said in discussing his
weekend plans for getting ready for his first week as history's
105th Supreme Court justice.
   Confirmed by the Senate last week, the 51-year-old judge is to
be sworn in Tuesday, shortly before taking the bench with his eight
new colleagues.
   Finding a place to live in Washington ``is one of the first
orders of business,'' Souter said in an interview.
   As he did during his three days of testimony before the Senate
Judiciary Committee, Souter steered clear of any questions that
might evoke a controversial answer.
   Asked what current justice he most closely resembles in judicial
outlook, Souter declined to answer. ``You'll just have to keep
score,'' he said.
   Souter said a contingent of lawyer friends from the Concord area
and some neighbors will travel to Washington to see him sworn in.
But his mother, who turns 83 this weekend, will not make the trip
because of health concerns.
   ``There will be familiar faces to get me through,'' Souter said.
   Souter said he had seen an article in The Washington Post that
called him one of Washington's most eligible bachelors, and said it
pleased him.
   ``I've got to wait to see the results,'' he said, smiling.

   Health and Human Services Secretary Louis W.
Sullivan told drug dealers Thursday to beware of an ``angry and
active community'' as he announced grants of $42 million to 95
coalitions of community groups.
   ``Those who deal in drugs and death will lose this war. Those
who deal in community spirit will win,''' Sullivan said at a White
House news conference attended by many of the grant recipients.
   ``Let the traffickers and drug dealers take note of what we do
here today,'' he said. ``They may fear the police, but they should
fear an angry and active community even more.''
   The Community Partnership Demonstration Program to fund local
drug prevention efforts was part of the initial National Drug
Control Strategy developed by William J. Bennett, national drug
control policy director.
   ``Our experience indicates that nothing works as well as a
community mobilized top to bottom to prevent drug use,'' Bennett
said, describing the program as ``remarkably unbureaucratic.''
   The 95 recipient coalitions - generally consisting of a minimum
of seven organizations or agencies, including at least one local
government - were selected from 200 applicants, Sullivan said. The
money, included in the budget for fiscal 1990, which ended Sunday,
will cover the first 15 months of the five-year program, he said.
   Plans developed by the coalitions will be reviewed, he said, but
he rredicted the recipients will receive additional federal grants
in the future to carry out their programs, and that other
coalitions will be added later.
   Unlike many federal programs, the money will go directly to the
95 recipient coalitions, not to state governments that usually dole
out federal dollars.
   ``We don't view this as going over the heads of the governors,''
Sullivan said. ``We view this as working with local organizations.
And these are, of course, grants that are competitive.
   ``These awardees today are those who really developed the best
coalitions, the best plans, and have the best projections for
future success,'' he said.

   Eight Republican senators are helping out a
Democratic colleague by urging Louisiana voters to reject the GOP
candidacy of former Ku Klux Klansman David Duke.
   ``All of us would be embarrassed and mortified to have to serve
in the United States Senate with David Duke masquerading as a
Republican,'' Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo., said Wednesday.
   The senators endorsed Democratic Sen. Bennett Johnston's
re-election bid in Saturday's Louisiana primary election. Duke
represents hatred and bigotry, and GOP-endorsed candidate Ben
Bagert can't win, the senators said.
   Bagert pulled his ads from a radio station, cancelled scheduled
campaign appearances today and scheduled an afternoon news
conference.
   Charles Black, chief spokesman for the national Republican
Party, said Bagert planned to drop out.
   ``I think that's just the final insurance against Duke getting
any further,'' Black said.
   Five of the GOP senators signed an open letter to Louisiana
voters urging Johnston's re-election, and three more are joining in
the public endorsement.
   Duke ``has no place in our party or in this body,'' their letter
said. ``The need to speak out against hatred and bigotry far
outweighs any partisan interest we may have in this election, and
we urge the Republicans in Louisiana to vote for Sen. Bennett
Johnston.''
   Duke's candidacy, and his previous election to the state
Legislature as a Republican, have caused discomfort for national
Republicans and prompted the Republican National Committee to
repudiate him.
   Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, campaigned for Johnston in Louisiana
recently and urged Bagert to drop out. Still, the occasion was the
first any could recall that a group of Republican senators had
urged re-election of a Democratic colleague.
   Johnston is seeking a fourth term. In Louisiana's unique open
primary election system, a candidate can win the election outright
by receiving more than half of the vote Saturday. But if no
candidate achieves a majority, the two top vote-getters will face
each other in the general election Nov. 6.
   In addition to Johnston, Duke and Bagert, a state senator, the
field also includes two political unknowns, both Democrats.
   Bagert has run a distant third in polls, and the GOP senators
said it appeared he could not win. Stevens said he took the step
after seeing three polls each showing Bagert with less than 10
percent of the vote. Polls have shown Johnston's support at around
50 percent.
   The senators said they hoped Louisiana voters would give
Johnston a majority Saturday and deny Duke the opportunity to run
as the sole Republican candidate in the general election runoff.
   ``While the Republican tent is a large one and really can
include just about anyone, it has no room for hatred, it has no
room for racism, it has no room for anti-Semitism and some of the
other things David Duke ... has espoused,'' said Sen. Rudy
Boschwitz, R-Minn.
   Bagert called the national GOP support for Johnston
``treachery,'' and denounced the senators.
   The letter was signed by Boschwitz, Danforth, Stevens and Sens.
Warren Rudman of New Hampshire and William Cohen of Maine. Sen.
Dave Durenberger of Minnesota intends to sign it, aides said.
   In addition, Alaska Sen. Frank Murkowski of Alaska endorsed
Johnston at a news conference with the others, and Boschwitz said
Sen. Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas was joining them too.
   Should Duke win election to the Senate, Stevens said he and
others would seek to deny him membership to the Republican caucus,
in effect ostracizing him.
   Rick Shelby, political director of the National Republican
Senatorial Committee, said it still was backing Bagert. But if Duke
is in a runoff with Johnston, Shelby said, ``my recommendation
would be that everyone from the president on down endorse Bennett
Johnston.''

   Auto and truck horns outside the White House
trumpeted a clamorous lunch-hour protest Thursday to the $500
billion package of tax hikes and budget cuts pushed by President
Bush and congressional leaders.
   Responding to a half dozen demonstrators bearing ``Honk if You
Hate Taxes'' signs, motorists leaned on their horns by the scores.
   ``Let George Bush read your lips,'' one demonstrator, dressed in
a dark pinstripe suit, shouted at traffic. ``Want to pay 12 cents
more for gas? Then honk,'' another yelled.
   A majority of motorists - and nearly all cab drivers - seemed to
go along with the suggestion, eagerly leaning on their horns and
raising an ear-rending racket along Pennsylvania Ave. outside the
White House gates.
   Several booming blasts from truck horns added to the din.
   ``We figured if we came down here, maybe George Bush would look
out the window and say, `hey, what's the racket?''' said Amy
Morris, an organizer of the protest.
   She said she was with the National Center for Public Policy
Assessment, a conservative research organization, but that
``various groups'' were participating in the demonstration.
   ``We plan to stage as many high-visibility events as we can to
protest the package,'' she said.
   At the time of the demonstration, Bush was having lunch inside
the White House with House Speaker Thomas S. Foley to discuss the
budget stalemate.
   Although there was no indication that either heard the noise,
the blaring horns were clearly audible throughout the White House
grounds and inside the press area.

<BYLINE>Criticism Mounts Of China's Handling of Crash
^By JOHN POMFRET</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China faced severe criticism Thursday for the
handling of its worst reported air disaster, with aviation experts,
Western diplomats, relatives of passengers and a pro-Beijing
newspaper joining the chorus.
   Aviation experts and Hong Kong newspapers questioned Chinese
authorities' decision not to evacuate Canton's Baiyun International
Airport Tuesday morning while a hijacked Boeing 737 circled above
for 40 minutes before it crashed into two parked jets, killing an
estimated 127 people.
   Forty-seven of the deaths occurred aboard a full Boeing 757 that
was parked awaiting takeoff to Shanghai.
   ``The management of the airport was in a mess,'' said Hong
Kong's Wen Wei Po. ``There should be an urgent review.'' The
editorial was highly unusual because the paper is considered a
strident supporter of Beijing's hard-line leadership.
   Experts and Hong Kong newspapers also expressed surprise at the
apparent decision to fight the hijacking attempt with little regard
for the possible consequences.
   Chen Kaizhi, a high-ranking official of the Communist Party in
Guangdong province, said the pilot was told ``he could follow
international practice and fly the hijacked plane outside China.''
   But survivors of the crash quoted the pilot as saying the plane
did not have enough fuel to fly to Taiwan or Hong Kong. In reality,
both destinations could have been reached, Chen said.
   Once the hijacker discovered he had been tricked, he either
detonated explosives or scuffled with the pilot, causing the plane
to lose control and careen into the two parked jets, engulfing them
in a ball of flames.
   ``This is cops-and-robbers stuff,'' said one Hong Kong-based
aviation expert, who spoke on condition of anonymity because his
company does busiess in China. ``They are playing with hundreds of
people's lives and still they want to get the bad guy.''
   The expert noted that Chinese flight crews on previous hijacked
airliners were also more concerned with thwarting hijackers than
ensuring the flight's safety.
   The policy has apparently backfired at least once before.
   More than 100 people are believed to have been killed in 1981
when a jetliner went out of control and crashed after pilots
struggled to resist an armed hijacker. China's state-run media
never reported the incident.
   Chinese survivors also noted this as a factor in the crash.
   ``Is killing one hijacker worth the deaths of more than 100
people?'' one Chinese woman said from her hospital bed. ``Why
didn't our leaders just let the plane leave China?''
   Relatives of passengers hurt or killed in the disaster said they
were angry because Chinese authorities gave them no information
about the crash.
   Taiwanese relatives had to wait two days to see injured family
members. A group of relatives of the 31 Taiwan passengers killed in
the crash issued a statement blasting the Chinese authorities for
their slowness.
   ``We were anxious and upset that details were only released 30
hours after the crash,'' the statement said, referring to a list of
dead and injured circulated by Chinese authorities more than a day
after the accident.
   A Hong Kong resident, Choi Man-choi, said he learned of the
death of his brother, Choi Man-fat, from a news report in the
British colony on Wednesday.
   ``I've had no confirmation from Chinese authorities
whatsoever,'' he said. ``Their arrangements are in chaos.''
   Taiwanese and Hong Kong relatives of deceased passengers were
told they would have to wait until Friday to view the remains of
their kin. Richard Stites, spokesman for the U.S. Consulate in
Canton, reported that U.S. officials had been turned back at the
gates of Canton's mortuary when they went to view the remains of
the lone dead American, identified by her parents as Mary Anna
Gilbert, a 23-year-old English teacher from Alexander City, Ala.
   China's media has so far issued little information on the
disaster. The first official report, two sentences from the Xinhua
News Agency, came about eight hours after the jet went down.

   A trustee of the University of the District of
Columbia Thursday said negotiations with protesting students
seeking the resignation of 11 of the 15 board members have been set
back by the students' release of a tape of a closed meeting.
   ``The trustees who have not resigned felt that the ethics of the
negotiations were violated'' by releasing the tapes, board member
Alonza Evans said. ``It set us back 48 hours minimum.''
   Student protest leader Mark Thompson Wednesday night broadcast a
tape recording of a meeting with trustees to reporters to buttress
the students argument that board members are not taking the
university or the protest seriously.
   The students said they believe the board has done a poor job of
running the 12,000-student public institution. Protesters said the
board has allowed the quality of the school's academic programs to
decline to a point where their accreditations are in jeopardy.
   Thompson Thursday said that he and other protesting students are
not losing support and that negotiations are continuing.
   Dozens of students barricaded themselves inside a university
building Sept. 26. They are refusing to leave unless all 11 mayoral
appointees to the 15-member board submit resignations effective
March 31.
   Five of the 11 board members in question have agreed to resign,
including board chairman Nira Hardon Long.

   Iraq could survive for a matter of weeks at most
against the multinational force in the Persian Gulf, the
International Institute for Strategic Studies said Thursday.
   ``In Cold War days, NATO commanders talked in terms of days and
weeks of their capacity to sustain conventional battles,''
institute Director Francois Heisbourg said at a news conference to
present an annual survey of global forces, The Military Balance
1990-91.
   ``The situation is not very different given the nature of
conflict in that part of the world,'' he said, adding that the
impact of sanctions on Iraq would also mean ``the conflict would
not last terribly long.''
   Analysts presenting the report said Iraq totally rearmed 11 army
divisions between the end of its eight-year war with Iran in 1988
and invading Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   But President Saddam Hussein was forced to abandon an attempt to
raise 10 new divisions - 100,000 to 150,000 troops - for his nearly
1-million-strong army because the nation of 16 million people
simply does not have enough men, the analysts said.
   Assessing Iraqi strength and tactics if hostilities break out,
institute spokesman Andrew Duncan said Saddam likely will turn his
chemical weapons against civilians because of the difficulty of
attacking well-protected and mobile U.S. troops in the gulf.
   The institute, like American analysts, assumes that Iraq has
surface-to-surface missiles capable of carrying chemical weapons.
   But Duncan said Iraq would find it tough to pinpoint U.S. and
other multinational forces with missile-borne chemical attacks in
the desert, while its aircraft would be highly vulnerable to
airborne attacks.
   The institute said the 955,000-strong Iraqi army varied from six
formidable divisions of Republican Guards, well-paid and
politically motivated, to poorly armed and trained conscripts.
   The army includes seven armored divisions and 40 infantry
divisions as well as the Republican Guards which led the Kuwait
invasion.
   ``There are 1 million men in the forces and there are less than
1 million men aged 18 to 22 in the country,'' Duncan said. ``That's
one of the reasons there are over 1.5 million Egyptian farm
laborers in the country.''
   The institute analysts also said Iraqi tanks will be highly
vulnerable to U.S. air attacks if they move in the desert, rather
than acting as static firing platforms heavily defended in the
desert.
   On Iraq's nuclear capability, institute director Heisbourg said:
``Iraq in a peacetime situation - with reasonable access to outside
markets - would be a number of years away from a nuclear bomb.''
   On Soviet-U.S. tank strength, the survey showed the Soviets have
increased their overwhelmingly superior forces despite the end of
the Cold War and the imminence of a major conventional arms
reduction agreement.
   By early 1990, the report said, the Soviets had destroyed some
2,600 tanks and converted 500 to civilian use, but still had 61,500
main battle tanks compared with 60,000 last year.
   The United States has 15,440 main battle tanks, slightly down
from 15,600 last year, the institute said.
   The institute said the Soviets appear to have pulled some 7,000
tanks east of the Ural Mountains, out of the area covered by the
arms negotiations.
   ``These games are tolerated games as long as the numbers don't
become wholly unreasonable,'' Heisbourg said.
   The survey was released a day after the United States and the
Soviet Union announced agreement in principle on a major
conventional arms reduction treaty.
   The treaty, requiring the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact to withdraw
40,000 tanks from eastern and central Europe and move them east of
the Urals, is likely to be signed at a 34-nation East-West summit
in November.
   Draftees into the Red Army have fallen by 26 percent in the past
year, the survey said. It predicted that Soviet active forces,
nearly 4 million strong compared with the United States' 2.17
million, will be cut by half into a better equipped and more able
army.
   The institute, an international, non-governmental center for
research on security and arms control, is funded by private
foundations, membership fees and sales of its publications.

   President Bush and congressional leaders
pressed an all-out lobbying blitz today for their $500-billion
deficit-cutting plan, still shy of enough votes to move the
election-year plan through the House.
   Bush and House Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash., discussed strategy
at a White House lunch as arm-twisting continued on Capitol Hill.
Congressional leaders planned to hold off a vote until enough
support was assured.
   With Congress poised to vote on an outline of the budget
compromise, Foley and other lawmakers said specific elements of the
plan could be changed slightly before the package itself comes to a
vote in two weeks.
   ``They are not necessarily voting for every `i' and every `t' in
the budget agreement summit agreement,'' the speaker said.
   The focus of the battle was in the House, where despite public
expressions of confidence by Democratic and Republican leaders, the
White House and Bush's top allies said they did not yet have the
votes to pass it.
   Bush wooed 60 Republicans over coffee and doughnuts at the White
House this morning. House Minority Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill.,
emerged to say Bush had convinced several of the Republicans to
vote for the pact.
   But Michel acknowledged, ``We're not there yet.'' Presidential
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, ``We're inching along but we don't
have the votes yet. ... We're getting closer.''
   Democrats and Republicans met separately on Capitol Hill as
their leaders tried to drum up votes. House Majority Leader Richard
Gephardt, D-Mo., expressed confidence that 130 Democrats - a
majority of the 258 Democrats in the House - would support the
plan.
   ``We don't have 130 people who said yes, count me in, but we
have enough expressing indecision ... that I think we can get to
the number,'' Gephardt said.
   Facing a possible vote later in the day, sources on Capitol Hill
said Wednesday night that each side was about 40 votes short of
getting majority support in the House for the measure, with many
uncommitted members in both parties.
   ``I feel real good about our meeting with the president this
morning with a number of those who were on the fence,'' Michel told
ABC-TV as he emerged from the White House today. ``Several said,
`Your arguments are compelling. ... The alternatives just are not
acceptable.'''
   Michel said he was still hoping to have the showdown vote today.
Bush will ``absolutely not'' sign another stopgap spending bill
without a deficit agreement, he said.
   ``We just can't delay any more. We're up against it,'' said the
Republican leader.
   ``We're still worried,'' one Democratic staff aide said late
Wednesday. ``We're still working hard.''
   Some 27 GOP lawmakers made the trip down from Capitol Hill to
the White House on Wednesday to hear Bush's pitch. The president
cancelled a five-day political-and-holiday trip to New England to
stay in the capital and keep the pressure on fellow Republicans.
   Bush also dispatched lieutenants to the Capitol to buttonhole
lawmakers in corridors in what one White House aide called the
administration's biggest lobbying effort.
   ``We have people who have been ... advocating certain positions,
coming out of the left, coming out of the right, coming out of the
broad center, and I'm having to say to them, `Now look, lay aside
that passion for that specific issue ... and put the national
interest first,''' the president told reporters.
   Senate leaders seemed more confident of prevailing in today's
vote, which was to be on a broad outline of the spending plan.
Congress will vote in two weeks on a separate measure containing
the actual spending cuts and tax boosts.
   ``I've got mine, unless somebody discovers a time bomb in
there,'' said Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., when asked
if GOP senators would support the compromise.
   Lobbyists for various interest groups also fanned out across
Capitol Hill. Dole, for instance, was visited by vintner Ernest
Gallo, who was unhappy with the package's eight-fold increase in
the 3-cent-per-bottle tax on wine.
   The plan would produce $134 billion in new taxes, $109 billion
in cuts in benefit programs, and about $200 billion in reduced
military spending over the next five years, including $40 billion
in savings in the fiscal year that started Monday.
   Taxes would be raised on alcohol, tobacco, yachts and other
luxury items, gasoline, heating oil and a small portion of the
incomes of the wealthy.
   But since its unveiling Sunday after four months of White
House-congressional bargaining, the package has been under attack
from lawmakers on both ends of the political spectrum.
   Liberal Democrats are unhappy with the $60 billion in cuts in
Medicare, especially the $30 billion in higher costs and reduced
benefits for the elderly and handicapped people.
   They also believe the taxes would dispropotionately hurt poor
people and that the plan's $11 billion in tax breaks for small
businesses were nothing more than a gift to the wealthy.
   ``We're making available for the very wealthy an opportunity to
shelter income,'' complained Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill.
   Rostenkowski, chairman of the tax-writing House Ways and Means
Committee, said he did not know how he would vote. But he and other
lawmakers said they would push for changes in the package before it
is considered in two weeks.
   Conservatives were upset with the tax increases and with what
they considered insufficient spending cuts and benefits for
business.
   Rep. Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., a leader of the opposition, said he
believed the vote was too close to call. He had predicted Tuesday
that the supporters would win.
   ``I've had members walk up to me and say they've gotten so many
phone calls from their districts against the package that they
don't know if they can stay with it,'' said Gingrich, the No. 2
House GOP leader.
   Supporters of the plan readily conceded that it contained
something for everyone to dislike, but they argued it was needed to
help the economy and no alternative was available.
   ``It's sort of an indulgence to pick the agreement apart when
you don't have anything else to put on the table that has the
possibility of passing,'' said Sen. Wyche Fowler, D-Ga., who was a
budget negotiator.

   Chancellor Helmut Kohl signaled an end to the
nation's wedding celebrations Thursday, telling Germans to expect
hard work and sacrifices as they rebuild the east's shattered
economy.
   During the first meeting of the new German parliament, lawmakers
from all sides urged that they work together to face the enormous
tasks ahead.
   Otto Lamsdorff, the head of Kohl's junior coalition partner Free
Democrats, said ``the bottom has not been reached'' in revamping
the failed businesses in what before Wednesday was East Germany.
   Labor statistics showed that 444,825 East Germans were
unemployed when the two Germanys merged - up from 361,286 in
August. Some predictions say East Germany's transition to a free
market economy after four decades of communism may throw 4 million
people out of work within a few mnnths.
   As the leaders of former East and West Germany met in Berlin's
war-scarred Reichstag building the day after unification,
nationwide celebrations were quickly fading into memory.
   ``The German wedding party is over,'' said Wolfgang Thierse of
the opposition Social Democrats. ``Now, the married couple has to
earn a living, set up a home in a humane way, and take care of the
children.''
   Chancellor Kohl said economic recovery ``will call for great
exertions, and we shall also have to make sacrifices. The
destruction caused in the course of four decades (in East Germany)
cannot be set right within a few weeks and months.''
   The chancellor also cautioned that ``financial demands'' of
unification will have to be weighed against the need to keep the
overall economy sound.
   Five former East German officials, including Prime Minister
Lothar de Maiziere, were sworn as ministers in Kohl's cabinet.
   Differences in style were immediately evident among the
lawmakers.
   Most of those from the West wore dark suits or appropriately
reserved dresses. Some of those from the East wore more casual
clothes and no ties. Gregor Gysi, a member of parliament and head
of the renamed Communist Party, wore a tie but left his top button
unbuttoned.
   ``Quite frankly, I feel a little bit like a guest here,'' Gysi
said before his speech.
   Gysi had pleaded for a preservation of a socialist German state
- or at least some of its advantages. In his speech, he promised to
fight for such things as goverment financial support for children
and the sick.
   ``I warn against using the history of East Germany just to
glorify West Germany,'' Gysi said, noting that even the West has
poverty and social troubles.
   Thierse, a leading member of the Social Democrats from what was
East Germany, said people are worried about looming massive
unemployment, women's right to work and pensions for the elderly.
   Thierse also cited the ``worry that we soon will lose our
apartments, because we won't be able to afford the rent.''
   The lawmakers spoke at the daylong, televised meeting of the
parliament, made up of 144 members from the former East Germany and
519 from the West. They will hold office until parliamentary
elections Dec. 2.
   The Reichstag hall was hastily renovated by workers under tight
deadlines, and a giant eagle - Germany's emblem - was brought in
from the old West German parliament building in Bonn and placed on
the front wall. Outside, the patched-over bullet holes in the
rugged sandstone building's walls testify to the heavy fighting
that raged there as Adolf Hitler's Third Reich was collapsing in
flames.
   Kohl remarked on the developments that crushed Erich Honecker's
Communist government in the east and led to unification.
   ``We have been able to restore German unity in freedom without
war and violence, without bloodshed, in full agreement with our
neighbors and partners,'' Kohl said.
   Kohl also paid tribute to the victims of the Holocaust and those
who suffered at the hands of the Communists.
   Kohl later sat impassively as Oskar Lafontaine, the Social
Democrats' candidate for chancellor, berated him for alleged
mistakes in the unification process.
   Lafontaine chastised Kohl for refusing to disclose the costs of
unification - estimated by some in the hundreds of billions of
dollars.
   He said the ``mistakes'' included the promise not to raise taxes
and an allegedly overly favorable exchange rate given the East
Germans for their now-worthless money.
   ``The bad decisions of the government will cost an extra 100
billion marks (nearly $65 billion) a year for the next few years,''
Lafontaine said.
   In Berlin, authorities freed East Germany's spy chief from jail
but forbade him to leave Germany. Werner Grossmann, arrested
Wednesday, is being investigated on espionage charges.
   Grossman's organization was a division under former East German
secret police chief Erich Mielke. Mielke and another member of the
former Communist leadership, labor boss Harry Tisch, were moved to
a prison in the western part of Berlin on Thursday, officials said.
   Both men were arrested earlier this year. Mielke is being
investigated for persecution of dissidents and for giving sanctuary
to West German terrorists, while Tisch is under a investigation for
corruption.

<HEAD>Court Refuses To Reinstate Campaign Contribution Limits In
California</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Supreme Court justice Thursday refused to
reinstate campaign contribution limits for California's
gubernatorial and other state races to be decided next month.
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor rejected, without comment, an
emergency plea to suspend a federal judge's ruling that threw out
contribution limits imposed by California voters in 1988.
   The lower court ruling lets candidates for governor, other
statewide posts and some local offices exceed the contribution
limits from now until election day Nov. 5.
   U.S. District Judge Lawrence Karlton ruled on Sept. 25 the
limits give an unfair advantage to incumbents. Karlton also tossed
out a ban on transfers of funds between candidates that was imposed
by the same ballot initiative.
   His ruling invalidated Proposition 73, which, among other
things, limits individuals to a maximum of $1,000 in contributions
to a particular candidate per fiscal year. The measure also limits
political action committee donations to $2,500 or $5,000 per
candidate per fiscal year, depending on the size of the committee.
   It is unclear what effect the ruling may have on the
gubernatorial race between Democrat Dianne Feinstein and Republican
Pete Wilson.
   Wilson, who had only token opposition in the June primary,
raised $12.5 million through June and had $3.9 million in the bank
as of July 1. Feinstein raised $8.1 million through June but had
only $645,344 left over from her primary campaign against state
Attorney General John Van de Kamp.
   The limits were challenged by the Democratic Party and labor
unions, which said Proposition 73 unfairly limited constitutional
rights to free speech and association.
   California Assembly Minority Leader Ross Johnson, a Republican,
and independent state Sen. Quentin Kopp, two of the co-authors of
Proposition 73, asked O'Connor to block Karlton's ruling.

<HEAD>Bush Says Arms Pact Will `Redraw Military Map' of Europe</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush today hailed a tentative
East-West agreement to reduce conventional forces in Europe, saying
it would ``redraw the military map'' to match dramatic political
changes.
   He said the agreement, announced Wednesday in New York, would
pave the way for the signing of the treaty next month in Paris at a
34-nation conference.
   Twenty-two nations will be signatories to the treaty - the 16
nations of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the six
members of the Warsaw Pact.
   Bush said that, despite the recent easing of tensions throughout
the region, ``Europe is still the site of the greatest
concentration of armed strength in the world,'' Bush said.
   Bush, standing beside Secretary of State James A. Baker III in
the White House news briefing room, said, ``We must also redraw
military map of the continent and lift some of the shadows and
fears lived with for a century.''
   Baker and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze
announced the resolution of all remaining major issues on Wednesday
on the most comprehensive arms reduction accord since World War II.
   The two nations next will try to conclude a second pact slashing
their nuclear arsenals.
   Success in completing both treaties would carry arms control to
new heights and contribute to the reduction in East-West tensions.
   Bush said that the Soviet Union and the United States had
``agreed in principle on all the remaining issues'' on the
Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty ``and on essential details as
well.''
   Baker, giving some new details of the agreement, said that tanks
would be limited to 20,000 each for both NATO and Warsaw Pact
sides; armored combat vehicles to 30,000; helicopters to 2,000.
   Baker said that, within that ceiling, any one country can have
up to 13,300 tanks, 13,700 artillery pieces, 1,500 helicopter and
5,150 combat aircraft, Baker said.
   However, he said there was still no agreement on the overall
ceiling on combat aircraft. ``This is still subject to some
discussion with allies on both sides,'' he said.
   Baker said he did expect to bring an agreement on overall combat
aircraft levels to Paris for the Nov. 19-21 conference.
   Baker and Shevardnadze both cautioned that final approval must
await consultation with their allies. But if the allies go along,
the treaty should be ready for signing at the summit.
   Baker flew home to Washington on Wednesday, planning to return
to New York on Friday for a critical meeting with Shevardnadze on
nuclear weapons limits.
   They made some headway on cutting intercontinental ballistic
missiles, nuclear submarines and bombers by up to 30 percent, but
after nearly six hours of talks they decided on a one-day break.
   Baker and Shevardnadze want to push on while the Soviet foreign
minister is in New York for the U.N. General Assembly session.
   The Conventional Forces in Europe treaty will set ceilings on
non-nuclear weapons that may be deployed in Europe. But it does not
cover the number of soldiers that may be put in the field, a topic
Baker and Shevardnadze agreed to skip in order to meet the Paris
deadline.
   Shevardnadze said one sticking point remained concerning limits
on helicopters, ``but that is not very difficult'' and could be
resolved by negotiators in Vienna who have been working on the
treaty for 19 months.
   The last issues settled were limits on land-based airplanes and
verification procedures to guard against cheating.
   The two superpowers agreed in 1989 to limit their
intermediate-range nuclear weapons in Europe.
   In May, Bush slowed the competition in short-range nuclear
weapons by terminating a program to develop more potent U.S. Lance
missiles and deciding to withdraw short-range U.S. nuclear
artillery.
   Bush's action was prompted by a series of moves by Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to end the Cold War.
   A steady withdrawal of Soviet troops and tanks and U.S. cutbacks
already are doing what the treaty seeks to accomplish. But a treaty
represents a formal commitment by both sides.
   The conventional arms treaty would require the Warsaw Pact to
withdraw 40,000 tanks, more than 51,000 artillery pieces and more
than 40,000 armored personnel carriers from eastern and central
Europe - four-sevenths to two-thirds of estimated current
deployments.
   The arms would have to be moved east of the Ural Mountains in
the Soviet Union, about 1,200 miles east of the Soviet border with
Poland.
   The restrictions on the smaller NATO forces would be minimal,
requiring only the removal of about 2,000 tanks.
   Artillery strength could be built up to a new ceiling of 20,000
for each alliance. The ceiling for tanks would be 20,000 as well
and 30,000 for armored personnel carriers.
   The Soviets agreed to limit naval-based aircraft with a
statement outside the treaty.
   Turning to another unfinished arms accord, one between the
United States and the Soviet Union to cut long-range nuclear
weapons, Baker reported that ``we have been able to make
substantial progress.''
   The three major unsettled strategic arms-reduction issues are:
   -The kinds of restrictions to impose on the 154 heavy,
ground-based SS-18 intercontinental missiles the Soviets will
retain under the treaty.
   -Whether the Soviet Backfire bomber is to be classified as a
strategic weapon, as the United States demands. That would mean
counting Backfires against limits established in the treaty.
   -The restrictions to be imposed on U.S. and Soviet transfers of
weapons barred under the treaty to allies - from the United States
to Britain, for instance.

   Tonight, tonight, in fact through next week
there's a place again for Carol Lawrence and Larry Kert, who are
sharing a stage for the first time since they starred in ``West
Side Story'' 33 years ago as Maria and Tony.
   This time, it's not a Broadway theater with an inner-city
backdrop but the Rainbow and Stars nightclub in posh Rockefeller
Center. And they're not sticking to the tunes they were assigned as
the tragic teen-age lovers whose story put Juliet and Romeo on the
gang-ridden streets of New York.
   Kert gets to sing ``I Feel Pretty'' and together Lawrence and
Kert do ``America,'' the fanciful Puerto Rican ``anthem'' by
composer Leonard Bernstein and lyricist Stephen Sondheim.
   Lawrence, who turns 56 on Friday, and Kert, 59, cover lots of
other musical ground in an offering a New York Times reviewer found
praiseworthy Thursday. He had just one complaint.
   Unlike Tony and Maria, Kert and Lawrence got to reach maturity,
a point they note a bit too often ``as if,'' said the Times,
``they're about to move to a home for retired actors.''

   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) - Bob Hope, Barbra Streisand, Elizabeth
Taylor and Shirley MacLaine have joined actress Katharine Hepburn
in donating items to an art auction Saturday for the North American
Wildlife Association.
   The association, based in East Lyme, provides the only 24-hour
wildlife rescue service in Connecticut.
   Taylor has donated a signed tote bag. MacLaine is contributing
an autographed book. An oil painting by Hepburn will be one of 90
artworks auctioned.
   Hepburn, who has a home in Old Saybrook, became a backer of the
group after it rescued a seabird with a broken wing she had found.
   Hope, Streisand and Charlton Heston have donated autographed
photos and actor Chad Everett is expected to provide three original
poems, said Steve Sosensky, an auction organizer.

   FULTON, Mo. (AP) - Former President Reagan once challenged
Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to tear down the Berlin Wall.
   Now the wall is gone but hardly forgotten and on Nov. 9 Reagan
is to be at Westminster College to dedicate a sculpture marking the
first anniversary of the day the wall was breached.
   It was at the same school 44 years ago that Winston Churchill
made his prophetic speech about an iron curtain descending across
Europe. The Berlin Wall, erected in 1961, became the physical
symbol of Churchill's metaphor.
   The sculpture by Churchill's granddaughter Edwina Sandys uses
eight concrete sections of the actual wall.

   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) - At 72, singer Ella Fitzgerald says
she still enjoys performing because she has something to offer.
   ``I like to feel like I can give people something they know and
want and maybe something that's new to them,'' Miss Fitzgerald said
in a telephone interview from her home last week.
   When she performs, Fitzgerald gives more than a simple musical
retrospective of five decades on stage. She also surprises.
   ``I even did a rap in a concert in Washington,'' she said. ``I
was just messing around and they seemed to like it. Sometimes
people will ask for a song and I try to do it.''
   ``You'd be surprised how many young ones there are there,'' she
said of her concerts. ``They tell me their parents have my records
and that's how they learned.''

   LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) - Maxene Andrews, one-third of the
boogie-woogie Andrews Sisters, is singing the praises of staying
youthful by staying active.
   ``People say to me, `When are you going to retire, Maxene?' I
say, `Well, when I retire, you'll only know I'm retired when you
see them carrying me off the stage,' '' the 72-year-old singer said
Wednesday during a weeklong visit to Nebraska.
   While in the Nebraska she will make speeches, including one at a
dance to raise money for senior centers.
   ``I love doing these things,'' Andrews said. ``I talk to them
(senior citizens) about not getting old, if you know what I mean.
Just because you've passed that mark, you don't have to think that
the world is leaving you behind.''

   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) - Director Milos Forman, winner of
Oscars for ``One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest'' in 1975 and
``Amadeus'' in 1984, was saluted by Hollywoodas a master filmmaker
and educator.
   About 400 people gathered Wednesday at the Beverly Hills Hotel
to pay homage to Forman, recipient of the fourth annual Eastman
Kodak Second Century Award for achievement in finding new talent.
   The native of Czechoslovakia has been co-chair of the film
division at Columbia University's School of the Arts for the past
12 years.
   Forman acknowledged the universities may be turning out more new
filmmakers than Hollywood can absorb.
   ``That's one of the aspects you feel sad about and bad about,''
Forman said. ``It's always like that. You have hundreds and
hundreds every year who want to be Picasso or want to be John Ford
or Hemingway.
   ``How many will become that?''

   FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) - Pianist Van Cliburn is planning a New
Year's Eve concert with the Fort Worth Symphony at the Fort
Worth-Tarrant County Convention Center Theater.
   Cliburn, 56, ended a 10-year absence from the stage last year
and has since appeared in Philadelphia, Dallas and the Soviet
Union.
   On Tuesday, he gave his first solo recital in 10 years in his
boyhood hometown of Kilgore before a sellout crowd of 1,600.
   The international piano competition named in Cliburn's honor is
held every four years in Fort Worth.

   Espresso flows at cafes and street-corner stands
throughout this caffeine-charged city. It's served to moviegoers,
store-browsers - and now to patients awaiting tooth work at
Espresso Dental.
   ``It wouldn't fly in Topeka,'' Dr. Ron Wallach acknowledges. But
in Seattle, where red neon espresso signs seem nearly as abundant
as stoplights, Wallach is booked weeks in advance. He's been only
in operation one month.
   ``It's been an overwhelmingly positive response,'' Wallach said,
standing in open casual shirt and cotton slacks in his north
Seattle office.
   Coffee, especially the carefully steamed concoctions from
elaborate espresso machines, is as essential to most Seattlites as
a raincoat. The brew can be found in video shops and laundries,
movie houses and sporting goods stores, and the city boasts nearly
150 espresso carts on its streets.
   Wallach's office, a former home, was split into a reception area
in front, with a pressed-wood log burning in the fireplace and a
silvery espresso machine sitting on a corner stand. In the rear are
three dental chairs, including one in a children's room where two
stuffed bears sit before coffee cups at a cafe table.
   The name is intended to overcome patients' fear of dentists,
Wallach said.
   ``With the connotations of the word dental - it's the last place
you'd want to go. But espresso is leisure time, friends,
conversation.''
   Encouraging further relaxation is Sharing Lawrence, a licensed
massage therapist whose hands help calm patients traumatized before
they go under the drill.
   ``Coming to a dentist is one of the hardest thing for people to
do,'' Lawrence said. ``When you even mention a root canal people's
shoulders go up 3 inches.''
   Lawrence said her massage is ``a human connection, and that's
what's missing in health care.''
   The steamed espresso drinks and massages are free to patients.
Lawrence said several people have walked in off the street thinking
they could order a cafe mocha or latte. They can if they make a
donation to Greenpeace, or the Protective Animal Welfare Society,
she said.
   Wallach talked of opening a full-service espresso cafe in an
extension of the office if the business continues to do well.
   The experience wouldn't be foreign. Before his 17 years as a
practicing dentist, Wallach helped friends manage a couple of
vegetarian restaurants in Vancouver, British Columbia. He described
them as places to ``hang out all night, listening to guitar,'' and
drink coffee. He hopes to capture that same atmosphere at Espresso
Dental.
   ``It's like coming home,'' said patient Cherie Paulo, 35.
Espresso Dental is ``just everything I would want in a dentist,''
she said.
   Paulo's 12-year-old daughter, Christine, was in for some drill
work, and while Wallach looked in her mouth, Lawrence massaged her
feet.
   Espresso Dental's first patient, Dennis Clancy, had some work
done on old fillings Wednesday morning. When he returned to talk
about billing in the afternoon he was treated to a full upper-body
massage by Lawrence.
   ``There's something going on here that I'm very, very
comfortable with,'' Clancy said.

<TEXT>
   It's been a whirlwind of activity for
Troy and Trina Kinast and their son Seth since people started
hearing about what the 3-year-old boy can do.
   Since last week, Seth has been in newspaper headlines and he's
been sought-after for network talk shows. Appearances are scheduled
with syndicated talk-show hosts David Letterman and Sally Jesse
Raphael.
   Seth is in demand because of his amazing ability to learn.
   He can count in three languages, recite the English alphabet
forward and backward and read at an upper second-grade level. His
parents say he has already mastered the Greek alphabet.
   ``We are just overwhelmed,'' Mrs. Kinast said of the numerous
telephone calls requesting interviews with her son.
   ``I feel like I am in a fog,'' said Kinast, just back a trip to
New York on Tuesday and Wednesday for an appearance on CBS' ``This
Morning.'' ``I don't think I have awakened yet.''
   The family was returning to New York for an appearance on the
David Letterman show on NBC on Friday.
   He said Seth stared, mouth agape, at New York's skyline and
played in the large back seat of the limousine that took them to
the airport.
   ``It was crowded,'' Seth said Wednesday after arriving home from
New York. He described the limo as the ``longest.''
   Mrs. Kinast said she and her husband never thought of their son
as a genius.
   ``We just took our time with him,'' she said. ``He is just a
normal 3-year-old kid full of orneriness.''
   Her husband said that because he and his wife are first-time
parents, they had no one to compare to Seth and were surprised by
all the attention.
   ``We have friends that have children Seth's age, and we didn't
see a whole lot of difference,'' Kinast said. ``When 3-year-olds
converse, the Greek alphabet and the names of shapes don't come
into play.''
   Seth has access to nearly 1,000 books and ``the computer is his
toy,'' his father said.
   Learning has become like playing.
   ``This is an everyday thing for him,'' said his mother. ``It is
just fun and games. We don't have a television, and Seth has to
play an active role instead of a passive role.''

   The Republican Senate candidate is
dropping out of the race, leaving former Ku Klux Klansman David
Duke as the only major candidate to challenge the incumbent, a
ranking GOP's official confirmed today.
   Charles Black, the Republican Party's main spokesman in
Washington, said GOP hopeful Ben Bagert planned to drop out and
urged his supporters to vote for the 18-year incumbent Democrat,
Sen. J. Bennett Johnston.
   ``I think that's just the final insurance against Duke getting
any further,'' said Black.
   Asked if national party leaders had urged Bagert to drop out,
Black replied: ``Not exactly.''
   ``At the point at which we concluded that it was unrealistic to
think that he (Bagert) could get into a runoff, we sort of
encouraged him not to carry the thing through,'' he said.
   Black said it was clear to him three weeks ago that Bagert could
not beat out Duke and get into a runoff against Johnston.
   The party spokesman said that, although he and other party
leaders had no role arranging endorsements of Johnston by Senate
Republicans, ``we sure didn't discourage anybody.''
   He added, ``The Republican National Committee should not endorse
a Democrat while there is a bone fide Republican in the race.''
   Johnston is seeking a fourth term. In Louisiana's open primary
system, a candidate can win the election outright by receiving more
than half of the vote Saturday. But if no candidate achieves a
majority, the two top vote-getters will face each other in the
general election Nov. 6.
   Besides Johnston; Duke, a first-term state representative; and
Bagert, a state senator, the field also includes two political
unknowns, both Democrats.
   Bagert has run a distant third in polls, which also have shown
Johnston's support at about 50 percent.
   Local radio and television stations earlier said Bagert had
canceled all commercials and would announce his withdrawal today.
   Bagert's staff confirmed that he had canceled all campaign
appearances and scheduled a 2 p.m. news conference.
   Kelly Johnston, deputy political director of the Republican
Senate Campaign Committee, earlier said a runoff between Johnston
and Duke ``would be the worst possible thing that could happen to
us.''
   It would allow Democrats across the nation to link any
Republican in the November general election to Duke, she said.
   On Wednesday, eight Republican senators in Washington urged
Louisiana voters to reject Duke.
   Duke represents hatred and bigotry, and Bagert can't win, the
senators said.
   ``All of us would be embarrassed and mortified to have to serve
in the United States Senate with David Duke masquerading as a
Republican,'' Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo., said Wednesday.

   Tamil rebels ambushed and killed seven
government soldiers early Thursday and injured a dozen more in the
troubled north, military officials said.
   It was the single largest casualty toll the government has
acknowledged in recent weeks.
   The soldiers were killed near the Chettikulam village in the
Vavuniya district, 135 miles northeast of Colombo, according to the
officials, who cannot be identified by name. They said many of the
injured soldiers were in critical condition.
   On Wednesday, police commandos killed six Tamil Tiger rebels in
skirmishes in the east.
   Military officials said three of the rebels were killed after an
unsuccessful grenade attack near the village of Karaitivu and a
fourth was killed near Rufus Kulam. Two more rebels died when
police raided a guerrilla hideout near the Wattamadu village, they
said.
   At least 14,000 people have been killed in the seven-year
separatist war being waged by Tamil militia against the
Sinhalese-dominated government. Tamils, who make up 18 percent of
the island's 16 million people, say they are discriminated against
by the Sinhalese, who are 75 percent of the population.

   The Justice Department on Thursday stepped up
its investigation of the steep rise in gasoline prices by
subpoenaing records of major U.S. oil companies.
   The department's announcement that it had sought records from a
large number of oil companies, independent refiners and marketers
signalled that the civil antitrust investigation was entering a new
phase.
   In August, Justice Department lawyers began informally
interviewing petroleum industry executives to seek explanations for
the steep rise in gasoline prices since Iraq invaded Kuwait Aug. 2.
   James F. Rill, assistant attorney general for antitrust, said
the records being sought by civil investigative demands (CIDS)
would enable investigators ``to examine more closely those
explanations and also pursue some issues for which we don't yet
have answers.''
   Within two days of the invasion, U.S. oil companies raised their
gasoline prices an average of 4 cents a gallon, according to one
survey. Another showed that wholesale gasoline prices jumped 9.5
cents a gallon in the three days.
   The public outcry over price rises of up to 15 cents a gallon
prompted several major oil companies to freeze or roll back their
wholesale costs.
   ``We aggressively will pursue this investigation until we
determine whether or not violations of antitrust law contributed to
the rise in gasoline prices,'' Rill said in a statement.
   To establish antitrust violations, investigators would have to
determine that producers, refiners or marketers colluded to raise
prices. Antitrust laws carry both civil and criminal penalties.
   The department has not opened a criminal investigation into the
price hikes. To do so, prosecutors would have to convene a grand
jury.
   The Federal Trade Commission, the Energy Department and several
state attorneys general are assisting the Justice Department's
investigation.
   Rill said the interviews with petroleum industry executives
``developed substantial information about the nature of crude oil
and gasoline markets and how they behaved in the wake of the August
2 invasion.''
   ``It also provided us with an opportunity to have the parties
explain the factors that caused them to raise gasoline prices,'' he
said.
   The department's antitrust division will continue to interview
executives of oil companies as well as independent refiners and
marketers and collect price and supply information, Rill said.
   The average pump price of gasoline has risen 27.1 cents a gallon
since the invasion, according to a survey issued this week by the
American Automobile Association. Crude oil prices have nearly
doubled and the threat of war in the Persian Gulf have produced
wild price gyrations on commodities markets.
   Oil company spokesmen expressed confidence that investigators
would conclude there was no illegal conduct.
   Mobil Oil Corp. spokesman John Lord predicted that the Justice
Department probe would result in the same conclusion that antitrust
investigators reached when they found no evidence of price gouging
during a jump in heating oil prices last winter.
   ``When the cold weather passed, the prices fell but the
investigations continued and when the investigations were
completed, as usual, they found no price gouging whatsoever,'' Lord
said. ``That will be the case again.''
   Mike Libbey, a spokesman for Chevron Corp., said that gasoline
prices went up in August to keep pace with the rising cost of crude
oil, which shot up after the invasion.
   ``We are quite confident there was absolutely no price gouging
of any kind,'' Libbey said.

<HEAD>Trendy Club Vows Appeal of Verdict Favoring Group Denied Entry</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A trendy club is trying on old-fashioned
justice, appealing a court ruling that it was too discriminating
when it kept out four people who couldn't pass muster with the
doorman.
   A small claims court on Wednesday ordered the owner of the
downtown Mayan club to pay $250 each to the plaintiffs, who weren't
allowed in on May 19 apparently because of their appearance.
   Larry Nagler, a Beverly Hills attorney representing the club,
said he would appeal the case in Superior Court.
   The plaintiffs, meanwhile, celebrated the verdict as a victory
over arbitrary discrimination.
   ``I feel vindicated,'' plaintiff Jeff Stolzer said. ``This will
give these nightclubs something to think about.
   ``Either there will be some guidelines that are known to
everybody or they should just stop all door policies altogether and
let people in first come, first serve.''
   The Mayan opened about six months ago in an old porn theater by
the same name. In a custom more typical of New York clubs than West
Coast nightspots, getting in is a seemingly mysterious process:
some arriving patrons get waved right in while others must wait to
be chosen, if at all.
   The case pitted Stolzer, Kenneth Lipton, Teresita Dubrall and
Stephen Ambrosini against Sammy Chao, president of the company that
owns the Mayan.
   Chao testified Tuesday that there is no dress code and that the
doorman is picky about who is let in to keep out people who are
drunk or otherwise look like trouble. That system also saves room
inside for people with reservations.
   Stolzer differed. He told the court: ``I think we were met at
the door by a flippant and arrogant doorman. They just looked you
over like you were scum.''
   The plaintiffs argued that the decisions are arbitrary. If there
had been a posted dress code, they said, they would have been able
to comply.
   Vertigo, a nearby club, is facing a similar legal problem. The
state Alcoholic Beverage Control Department has recommended a
30-day suspension of Vertigo's liquor license because undercover
inspectors were refused entry.
   The club's owner has said the state inspectors weren't dressed
properly.

<HEAD>Two Solidarity Veterans to Compete for Polish Presidency</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki agreed
Thursday to run for president of Poland in a contest that would pit
him against his former ally and mentor, Solidarity chairman Lech
Walesa.
   The decision opens the way for the first popularly contested
race for president in Polish history and for a competition that
will involve the country's two best-known politicians.
   When Mazowiecki became the first non-Communist head of
government in the East bloc in the summer of 1989, his nomination
was engineered by Walesa.
   Since then, however, Walesa has accused Mazowiecki's government
of being too slow to privatize the state-dominated economy and to
dismiss former Communists from positions of authority in government
and industry. Mazowiecki supporters accuse Walesa of personal
ambition and demagoguery.
   Mazowiecki made his announcement on national television.
   ``The time for an answer has come and today I want to give this
answer, a short one,'' Mazowiecki said, speaking into the camera at
the start of the main evening news program.
   ``Following great deliberations and consideration of all
circumstances I have decided to express approval (to run for
president) if my candidacy is put forward,'' he said.
   ``One must move forward. One cannot retreat from the path Poland
has chosen and fought for so hard this year.''
   Elections are scheduled Nov. 25. Aside from Walesa and
Mazowiecki, several minor candidates are also expected to seek a
place on the ballot.
   Walesa announced his campaign for president Sept. 16 and held
his first meeting with potential voters Monday in the central city
of Torun.
   The office will be vacant because Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, the
former Communist leader, last month asked parliament to have his
six-year term shortened after 17 months as president, citing public
demands for a popularly elected leader.
   The Senate passed the final legislation setting up the elections
Saturday and Jaruzelski signed it into law Monday.
   Mazowiecki, 63, a longtime Catholic journalist and former
political prisoner, became prime minister Aug. 24, 1989.
   His nomination came after Communists failed to win sufficient
support to govern in partially free elections in June 1989.
   For most of the 1980s, Mazowiecki was an adviser and ally to
Walesa, participating in the Gdansk shipyard strikes in 1980 and
1988 that helped to topple Communist rule in Poland.
   Supporters of Mazowiecki have already begun gathering the
required 100,000 nominating signatures.
   ``It is true we have started to collect signatures,'' said
Halina Bornowska, spokesman of Citizens Movement for Democratic
Action, known by its Polish initials ROAD, the main group
supporting Mazowiecki.
   ``For the time being, we are doing it among ourselves, among our
sympathizers. ... That is why we are not making much fuss about
it,'' she told The Associated Press in a telephone interview.

<HEAD>Runner Hits Wrong Start Line, Runs 26.2 Miles Instead of Intended
Five</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   MILTON-FREEWATER, Ore. (AP) - A mentally handicapped man who was
prepared to run a five-mile race instead found himself finishing
the 26.2-mile Portland marathon after a mix-up at the starting
line.
   Art Pease stopped only once to walk and finished with an
unofficial time of 4 hours, 18 minutes and 23 seconds.
   Pease, 23, said it was just as well he didn't discover he was
running the wrong race right away.
   ``If I had known I was going to do all that, I might not have
finished,'' he said.
   When Pease discovered the mix-up, he was going strong and
decided to finish.
   Pease said he originally intended to run the marathon, but
settled for the five-mile race because the combination of a hot
summer and a busy work schedule left him without time to train
seriously.
   Pease's father, Charles, blames himself for the mix-up at the
starting line.
   The races were scheduled to begin within half an hour of each
other Sunday. Pease's father told him to get ready while he went
back to a hotel to pick up a friend who was taking part in a
five-mile walk.
   In the meantime, the gun went off and Pease, who happened to be
in the marathon line, started the race with thousands of other
runners. He became suspicious after about four miles when he
noticed that other runners were wearing green and orange tags but
his was white.
   But by then, he decided to see if he could stick it out.
   Pease's parents contacted race officials, who spotted Pease at
mile 16.
   The couple said their son had run 17 miles in the Special
Olympics Torch Light Run two years earlier and he was allowed to
continue after officials checked on him.
   ``We were very proud. It was such an accomplishment,'' Charles
Pease said. ``The doctor said he was in better shape than a lot of
them in the race.''

<NOTE>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE; No pickup.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Here, at a glance, are Thursday's developments in the Persian
Gulf crisis:
   
   The USS Independence left the gulf two days after entering the
waterway in a show of strength to Iraq. In Washington, a Pentagon
spokesman, Lt. Cmdr. Edward Lundquist, said the Independence had
``completed its operation there.''
   ---
   Five Europeans were found by the Saudi coast guard drifting in a
small boat in a Persian Gulf shipping lane off the Saudi-Kuwait
border, British diplomats and Saudi officials said.
   The British escapees told London's Daily Mail newspaper that
they had spent 25 hours in rough seas after taking the 10-foot boat
through the marshes of southern Iraq, into the Shatt-al-Arab
waterway and then the gulf.
   ---
   Yevgeny Primakov, a senior adviser to Soviet President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev, arrived in Baghdad carrying a message from Gorbachev,
Soviet diplomatic sources said. Its contents were not disclosed. In
Moscow, Gorbachev said he did not think the crisis would lead to
war, and he also told reporters he saw no reason to send Soviet
troops to the gulf.
   ---
   In the Jordanian capital, Amman, Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu of
Japan met with Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Taha Yassin Ramadan.
Ramadan rejected a negotiated settlement to the gulf crisis as long
as foreign troops remain on Arab lands, Baghdad's official Iraq
News Agency reported. Kaifu insisted on Iraq's withdrawal from
Kuwait first, said Shigeo Takenaka, Kaifu's spokesman.
   ---
   In Saudi Arabia, King Fahd met with French President Francois
Mitterrand, whom Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has tried to engage
in separate peace talks linking the invasion with Israel's
occupation of the Gaza Strip and West Bank and Syria's military
presence in Lebanon. There was no immediate statement on the
Saudi-French discussions.
   ---
   In Baghdad, a radical Palestinian group loyal to Iraq threatened
to launch ``powerful strikes'' if the United States endangers Iraqi
aircraft while enforcing the U.N. air embargo on Iraq. The
statement by the Arab Liberation Front was the second such threat
in as many days by radical Palestinians and heightened fears of a
terrorist campaign against the Western and Arab nations confronting
Iraq.
   ---
   Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said American sailors from the
Frigate Samuel B. Roberts boarded the Sudanese freighter Blue Nile
and turned it away from the Gulf of Aqaba. Williams said no shots
were fired.
   Williams said the freighter, carrying industrial equipment, was
diverted because the ship's log did not account for all of its
cargo. Under the U.N. embargo, shipments to the Jordanian port of
Aqaba, a prime port for Iraqi cargo, has been cut severely.
   ---
   Iraq, hurting from the international sanctions following its
invasion of Kuwait, planned to argue its case before the United
Nations on Thursday night. The world body, which has condemned
Iraq's invasion and placed a naval and air embargo on the country,
may consider stronger measures.
   ---
   An Australian newspaper said Iraq has set up two interrogation
centers in Kuwait City that are being used to torture prisoners.
The Sydney Morning Herald quoted unidentified Western diplomats and
another source who said at least 230 mutilated bodies had been
removed from one site since August.
   ---
   Iran's foreign minister, Ali Akbar Velayati, said on Tehran
television that his country wants a peaceful settlement to the
Persian Gulf crisis. He also said ``force should be the last
possible resort for solving this crisis.'' Concerning armed
conflict, he said: ``Iran will not be participating in this in any
way.'' The remarks, monitored in Cyprus, indicated Iran is
distancing itself from Iraq, following earlier suggestions that it
could circumvent the U.S.-led embargo and provide food and
medicine.
   ---
   The proposed sale of $7.3 billion in weapons to Saudi Arabia is
one step in creating a Persian Gulf ``coalition defense'' against
the long-term threat posed by Iraq to other countries in the
region, according to administration officials in Washington. The
sale would be followed by more sales to the Saudis next year and
perhaps to Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates as well,
Undersecretary of Defense Paul Wolfowitz and Undersecretary of
State Reginald Bartholomew told Congress.
   ---
   The Bush administration is ready to quickly provide two Patriot
anti-missile batteries to Israel to strengthen its position against
military action by Iraq, Wolfowitz told Congress. He said the
administration is also looking at other ways to help Israel. But
Bartholomew declined to say whether the U.S. would retaliate
immediately against Iraq if it attacks Israel.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Frees Wholesale Prices - Somewhat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev moved to boost the
output of Soviet businesses on Thursday by allowing them - with
certain restrictions - to negotiate their own wholesale prices.
   A presidential decree on prices, released by the Tass news
agency, was billed as a step toward a market economy. It was
Gorbachev's second decree since the Soviet legislature on Sept. 24
gave him sweeping new powers to rescue the collapsing economy and
maintain law and order.
   Economists have said freeing prices to respond to market forces,
rather than having them set by the government, is essential to
curing the economy.
   It is unclear, however, whether the decree frees prices enough
to make a difference.
   The decree says businesses can sign contracts with each other
for 1991 using negotiated wholesale prices. But it then adds three
restrictions. It says the prices must be based on those outlined by
the Council of Ministers in June 1988, that profits over a
state-set limit will be taxed and that wholesale prices of some
goods will remain fixed.
   Finance Minister Valentin Pavlov told Soviet television the
decree was a compromise but did not say what the differences had
been.
   A correspondent for the nightly TV newscast ``Vremya'' said the
decree should put more goods into the stores, by offering price
incentives for increased production. Shortages have left many
stores nationwide bare of such essential goods as flour, matches,
cheese and bread.
   Pavlov insisted the decree has no direct relation to retail
prices and assured viewers that state subsidies will continue. But
it appeared stores would have to raise retail prices if they had to
pay more to receive wholesale stocks.
   The finance minister said the decree was necessary so businesses
can know now what prices they will be able to charge - and
therefore how much product to plan - in 1991.
   In his first decree, issued one week ago, Gorbachev ordered
businesses to fulfill supply contracts and the government to ensure
distribution in 1991. He threatened businesses with fines if they
did not fulfill supply contracts to government retailers.
   Many workers and businesses are uncertain how they will fit in
the market economy Gorbachev is trying to establish and find it
more profitable to trade goods on the black market, rather than
distribute them in the established structure.
   The Supreme Soviet legislature is to choose a plan for switching
to a market economy on Oct. 15. The most radical blueprint, written
by economist Stanislav Shatalin, calls for junking the central
planning system and moving to a market economy within 500 days by
selling factories to private owners and breaking up collective
farms.

   After five weeks off for elective surgery and
recuperation, Joe Garagiola will return Monday to NBC's ``Today''
show and on Tuesday report on the baseball play-offs, NBC said
Thursday.
   Garagiola, 64, has declined to say what kind of surgery was
performed. A former ``Today'' co-anchor, he returned to the show
last June on a three-day-a-week basis as part of NBC's effort to
revive the show's ratings.
   The once-dominant program suffered a ratings slump after the
replacement in January of Jane Pauley by Deborah Norville, a
co-anchor with Bryant Gumbel.
   NBC's efforts to boost the show back into first place haven't
worked yet. ABC's rival ``Good Morning America'' was first in
morning ratings last week fo  the 39th consecutive week.
   It averaged a 4.4 rating, A.C. Nielsen Co. estimates
showed.``Today'' had a 3.2 and ``CBS This Morning'' a 2.6. Each
ratings point represents 931,000 homes.

   Three Britons who escaped from Iraq
by sea said Thursday their fear of Iraq sustained them through
their long hours bobbing in 10-foot swells of the open Persian
Gulf.
   The three, rescued Wednesday morning along with two Frenchman
off the border city of Khafji, spent 25 hours in a 10-foot
fiberglass boat floating through the marshes and canals of southern
Iraq, down the Shatt-al-Arab waterway and into the gulf.
   They avoided lights, used a small compass to navigate and got
lost several times before being picked up by a Saudi coast guard
vessel.
   ``It's a trip I wouldn't like to do again, but it was well worth
it now that I am here,'' Mike Teesdale, 40, told a news conference.
``My fear was of Iraq, not of the trip.''
   The men said they would fly back to London early Friday.
   It was the first report of Western men escaping Iraq in over six
weeks. Baghdad has permitted hundreds of women and children to
leave Iraq and Kuwait since its invasion Aug. 2 of Kuwait, but has
restricted departures of thousands of Western men.
   Iraq has taken several hundred of the hostages and put them near
key military and civilian targets, describing them as ``guests''
serving to prevent a military attack on Iraq. Western leaders have
described them as a ``human shield.''
   The Britons said they knew of some Americans being held near the
oil installation where they worked south of the Iraqi port of
Basra. They said they did not want to reveal the information about
the detainees publicly.
   The other escapees were Britons Ivan Manning, 44, and Keith
Barkworth, 36. The Frenchman were Amedee du Paty, 53, and Janel
Cellier de Buriane, 55, both barge masters. They refused to talk to
the press on the advice of their embassy.
   The Britons said they had been planning their trip for a month.
   While they had plenty of food and water and were not being held
at gunpoint, they were worried about what might happen if a war
breaks out over the Iraqi occupation.
   ``The conditions were OK,'' Teesdale said. ``What we feared most
was if trouble started who knows what would have happened. I just
don't trust a lot of people in Iraq.''
   Actual preparations took ``one day and it took about four weeks
to build up the courage to do it,'' Barkworth said.
   Throughout the time the men ``were pretending to work,'' he
said.
   The boat was readily available to them because of their
exploration work in the marshes, so they chose it over a land
route. They packed the boat with beer, whisky, vodka and cheese
sandwiches like they were going out for a picnic.
   In hindsight, Manning joked: ``We hadn't enough ice for the
trip.''
   At the last minute, at least one Briton backed out, he said.
   They made their way along canals out into the gulf through the
Shatt-al-Arab waterway, closed to shipping since the 1980-88
Iran-Iraq war.
   A 10-foot swell prevented them from using their diesel engine as
they tried to follow the shoreline in the gulf past Kuwait. A rare
heavy mist and overcast skies helped prevent them from being
sighted.
   The five worked in rotation, one on lookout, one steering and
one working the bilge pump.
   After 25 hours they thought they were near Bahrain but had
actually gone just 80 miles and were drifting back to Kuwait when
they were found by a Japanese barge, which notified the Saudi coast
guard.
   Saudi officials said the men were suffering from exposure but
all felt fine after a night in Khafji.

   Gun attack survivors and friends of gunshot
victims pleaded with Congress on Thursday to ban assault rifles.
   Mike Campbell, who was shot when a man with an assault rifle
went on a rampage at a printing plant in Louisville, Ky., last
year, said: ``What he did to myself and fellow workers will be with
us forever. It is devastating.''
   Campbell was joined at a news conference by James Brady, the
former White House press secretary shot in the assassination
attempt on President Reagan, and by friends of John ``Nick''
Sheehy, a University of California student killed last week when a
gunman held hostages at a pub in Berkeley, Calif.
   ``Something has to be done'' to ban assault weapons, said Tracy
Carney of Los Gatos, Calif. ``I can't believe this is even an
issue.''
   They urged passage of a bill banning assault weapons. They also
urged defeat of an amendment, sponsored by Rep. Jolene Unsoeld,
D-Wash., that would protect domestic assembly of assault weapons.
   ``They are weapons of war, designed for human slaughter,'' said
Betty Campbell, Mike Campbell's wife.

<HEAD>Seats By Plane Exit Doors To Be Restricted To Able-Bodied</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Beginning Friday, seats by exit doors on U.S.
airlines will be restricted by government order to the able-bodied
only.
   The Federal Aviation Administration regulation says only people
able and willing to open exit doors in an emergency and help flight
crews evacuate the airplane will be seated in rows adjacent to
them.
   Those barred from seats near exit doors include parents with
small children, people too frail to operate the door, passengers
with broken limbs or other disabilities that would inhibit
movement, obese people, children under 15 and the blind.
   The FAA regulation limits seating in exit rows to passengers who
can locate the door quickly, follow instructions for its use, are
physically able to open the heavy doors and can judge whether it is
safe to leave the aircraft.
   They must also understand verbal and hand-signaled instructions
from flight attendants and be able to get around obstacles to lead
other passengers off the aircraft.
   At the time the regulation was issued last January organizations
representing the blind called it discriminatory and said it would
reduce a blind person's chances to survive an airplane crash.
   Some airlines already bar blind travelers from exit-door seats
and several blind people have been arrested in recent years for
refusing to move from the seats.
   A lobbying effort to prevent implementation of the regulation
proved unsuccessful.
   Under the new procedures, gate agents at each airport will
assign the exit row seats to passengers who meet the new
requirements and appear able and willing to perform emergency
functions.
   Information cards will be provided at exit row seats describing
the functions passengers sitting there may have to perform during
an emergency.
   Flight attendants will describe these functions before each
flight.
   ``This is an important safety initiative,'' said William Hoover,
executive vice president of the Air Transport Association, which
represents the nation's airlines.
   ``Airline accidents are rare, but when they do happen it is
essential that the people seated in exit rows are capable of
hearing and understanding instructions, opening emergency exits and
assisting their fellow passengers in an evacuation of the
aircraft,'' Hoover said.
   The FAA describes an exit row seat as one from which passengers
may go directly to an exit without stepping first into an aisle.

   New England Telephone and New York Telephone
have agreed to pay $1.4 million to the U.S. Treasury and cut
long-distance rates $35.5 million to resolve allegations they
overcharged customers through a subsidiary, the Federal
Communications Commission said Thursday.
   The payment is a voluntary contribution and doesn't constitute a
fine, the FCC said.
   Under the consent decree, Nynex Corp. admitted no guilt and the
FCC said it made no findings of wrongdoing and was ending its
enforcement action. Nynex is the regional parent company of New
England Telephone and New York Telephone.
   The FCC said in February that it intended to fine the two
telephone companies $1.4 million over apparent violations of FCC
rules governing transactions between regulated telephone companies
and unregulated affiliates.
   The FCC had ordered the companies to return $35.5 million to
customers because of alleged $118.5 million in overcharges to the
companies by Materiel Enterprises Co., an unregulated Nynex
purchasing subsidiary.
   Nynex agreed to the $35.5 million rebate, to be made within 30
days, and said the two phone companies would reduce their capital
accounts by $32.6 million to ``remove the alleged excess profits on
plant and equipment'' bought from the purchasing subsidiary.
   Local phone rates won't be affected.
   ``We hope this puts to rest any questions concerning Nynex's
desire to comply with all FCC regulations and policies in
transactions among affiliate companies,'' Nynex Chairman William C.
Ferguson said in a statement.
   The agreement ends one of several pending federal or state
actions against Nynex, one of the seven regional Bell holding
companies created in 1984 from the old Bell System.
   Nynex also has been the focus of investigations that New York
Telephone suppliers helped pay for bawdy parties and prostitutes at
annual conventions of company employees in Florida from 1984 to
1988. Nynex has denied that any ratepayer funds were involved in
the conventions.
   In May, the Justice Department filed a one-count criminal
indictment alleging that Nynex had violated the information
services restrictions in the 1982 consent decree that created the
regional Bell companies. Nynex denied any wrongdoing.
   On Wednesday, New York state utility regulators authorized a
study into whether Nynex should be forced to divest New York
Telephone.
   Toby Webb, Nynex vice president for government affairs, said
Thursday he could not estimate how much the $35.5 million rebate
would affect long-distance prices for New York and New England
phone customers.
   Webb said Nynex had agreed to the latest consent decree to avoid
a potentially long court battle over accounting and purchasing
procedures that no longer were in effect. Materiel Enterprises was
merged into New York Telephone and New England Telephone earlier
this year, making Materiel a fully regulated company under FCC
rules.
   ``The agreement is preferable to engaging in prolonged
litigation over past events and practices which have been
changed,'' Webb said.
   The $1.4 million contribution to the Treasury will be paid by
Nynex shareholders, Webb said, and will not affect rates.

<HEAD>Communists Reject Calls to Abandon Celebrations of Bolshevik
Revolution</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Communist Party on Thursday rejected demands
to abandon the traditional celebration of Revolution Day on Nov. 7,
saying such suggestions are ``unjustified and unfounded.''
   The mayors of Moscow and Leningrad have proposed the traditional
celebrations be scrapped because shortages and long lines give
Russians nothing to celebrate this year.
   The anniversary of the 1917 revolution is one of the major
holidays on the Soviet calendar, a day usually devoted to praising
the glories of communism.
   But this year, instead of plastering cities with propaganda
posters and carrying giant portraits of Marx, Engels and Lenin
through the streets, Mayors Gavriil Popov of Moscow and Anatoly
Sobchak of Leningrad suggested that Russians spend the day planting
bushes and insulating buildings for winter.
   The Communist Party Central Committee's Secretariat, however,
said in a statement released by the Tass news agency that the
holiday was valid as ``an outstanding date in the revolutionary
renewal of the world.''
   ``Any attempts to deprive our multinational people of its main
all-state holiday are unjustified and unfounded,'' the secretariat,
the party managers, said.
   ``It has become a holiday for all who believe in the creative
potential of socialist ideas.''
   In the past, Revolution Day has been marked in the capital by a
parade of military equipment, including tanks and rockets, followed
by a vast ``people's demonstration'' in which hundreds of thousands
of Moscow residents streamed through the city's main avenues and
across Red Square.
   There, at the heart of Soviet power, members of the Communist
Party's ruling Politburo and top generals stood on Lenin's tomb.
   The celebration marks the day the Bolsheviks seized power - Oct.
25 by the old Czarist calendar, Nov. 7 by the new one introduced
later.
   Popov and Sobchak urged Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to
limit the festivities in Moscow to a military parade. So far, he
has not responded.
   May Day, another major Soviet holiday, was marked this year by
counter-demonstrations involving tens of thousands of people in
Moscow. As they passed through Red Square, many shouted ``Resign!''
and jeered at Gorbachev, who suffered the embarrassment stoically
for 20 minutes and then left the reviewing stand.

<HEAD>Study Finds House Challengers Can't Compete Financially</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a measure of how severely the political
playing field is tilted against challengers, a private study
released Thursday found that 95 percent of House incumbents are in
financially uncompetitive races.
   The study by the lobbying group Common Cause found that only 23
of the 405 House members who are seeking re-election face
challengers with comparable campaign funds. The other 382 had
opponents with less than half as much money to spend on a campaign,
or no opponents at all.
   The money could serve to protect incumbents against a widely
reported public disgust with Congress, said Common Cause President
Fred Wertheimer.
   ``House members are shielded by a wall of political money that
makes them nearly invincible,'' Wertheimer said. ``House incumbents
will have a free ride in 1990, largely financed by special-interest
PAC contributions.''
   Of the $119 million total raised by all incumbents so far during
the election cycle, just under half - $57.2 million - came from
political action committees. Challengers received just $1.9 million
from PACs during the same period.
   Topping the group's list of the ``financially unopposed'' was
Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y., who has nearly $2 million amassed
against an opponent who hasn't even filed a campaign finance
report. Candidates are not required to file unless they raise or
spend at least $5,000.
   In all, 296 House members faced opponents with less than $25,000
in campaign money or no opponents. Incumbents in that category had
a total of $130 million, compared with just $1.1 million for their
challengers.
   Another 86 House incumbents were in what Common Cause called
``financially non-competitive'' races, where the challenger had
more than $25,000 but still less than half the war chest of the
incumbent.
   The most lopsided was the contest between incumbent Democrat Mel
Levine in California, who had $2.1 million on hand, and Republican
David Cohen, with just $31,000.
   The total on hand for lawmakers in that category was $40.3
million, compared with $7.9 million for challengers.
   Seventy-eight incumbents had no major party opposition, but
those lawmakers still raised $19.2 million in the current two-year
election cycle, more than half of it from PACs.

   A 23-year-old woman died Thursday, hours after she
walked into a gun battle apparently arising from a stolen baseball
cap.
   Sandra Smith was standing on a street when bullets sailed from
an apartment complex during a fight between two 18-year-old men
arguing over the cap, police said.
   Witnesses told police Zarail Joiner shot Robert Greer with a
.30-caliber rifle then repeatedly rammed Greer's body with the
rifle stock until it broke. Joiner was charged Thursday with
attempted murder. He remained jailed Thursday on $4,500 bond.
   Greer was in critical condition Thursday at Parkland Memorial
Hospital.
   While Greer was being battered, a 15-year-old friend began
shooting at his attacker and struck Ms. Smith, police said. She was
taken to Parkland and died about five hours later from a single
gunshot wound to the abdomen.
   The 15-year-old was arrested, police said.

<HEAD>Dinkins Orders Wage Freeze; Considers 15,000 Layoffs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN SHANAHAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two days after announcing plans to hire 8,000
new police officers, Mayor David Dinkins ordered a freeze on city
hiring and promotions Thursday and was considering 15,000 layoffs.
   He said the freeze would save $115 million during this fiscal
year and the next one.
   His Office of Management and Budget had recommended the layoffs
and other agency reductions, which Dinkins said would cut an
additional $800 million from an expected budget deficit in fiscal
1992 of $1.4 billion.
   Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman, meanwhile, said the budget gap
for next year could reach $2.6 billion. She also projected a budget
deficit in the current fiscal year of as much as $738 million.
   The mayor claims the budget is balanced for this fiscal year.
   Holtzman called for a summit meeting of the city's top fiscal
officers, labor leaders and academic and financial experts to deal
with the problem.
   Dinkins issued a statement saying that ``a recessionary economy
and the hard times that come with it are facts of life in our city
and region.''
   ``With hard times come hard choices,'' the mayor said. ``We all
hope and pray for better economic times. Until they arrive,
however, I will continue to impose strict budgetary discipline.''
   On Tuesday, Dinkins announced a $1.8 million crime-fighting plan
that included the hiring of nearly 8,000 police officers.
   Mayoral spokesman Leland T. Jones said Dinkins has ordered
Budget Director Philip Michael to devise a plan for layoffs to
determine what impact they would have on city services.
   ``He's inclined to do it,'' Jones said.
   The last layoffs of such scale were at the height of the city's
fiscal crisis in 1975, when about 25,000 workers were laid off.

<HEAD>Canada's Murder Rate Declines</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Canada's annual murder rate declined slightly in
1989, according to government figures released Thursday.
   Statistics Canada reported the number of murders committed in
1989 increased to 657 from 575 a year earlier. But it said the
figure represented a drop in the homicide rate from 2.57 murders
per 100,000 people in 1988 to 2.51 last year.
   By comparison, preliminary estimates indicate there were 21,500
murders in the United States in 1989, for a rate of 8.7 murders per
100,000 people or 3{ times higher than Canada's rate, the agency
said.
   Quebec led all provinces with 215 murders, including 14 women
massacred at the University of Montreal last December by Marc
Lepine, who committed suicide during a gun battle with police.
   Manitoba had the highest homicide rate for the fourth year in a
row, with 43 murders or a rate of 3.96 per 100,000 people. Prince
Edward Island, with one murder and a rate of 0.77, had the lowest
homicide rate for the eighth consecutive year, the agency said.
   New Brunswick, where six murders in the Miramichi River region
terrorized residents in the final half of 1989, reported 18 murders
for the year, compared with eight in 1989, the agency said.

   Democrat Barbara Roberts is deadlocked
with Republican Dave Frohnmayer in the race for Oregon governor, a
new poll says.
   The statewide poll commissioned by The Oregonian also showed
that Sen. Mark Hatfield has lost ground but still has the lead over
his Democratic challenger, Harry Lonsdale.
   Attorney General Frohnmayer has 44 percent support to 43 percent
for Secretary of State Roberts, well within the poll's margin of
error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.
   One month ago, Roberts was seven points back. Independent Al
Mobley has 7 percent, and Libertarian Fred Oerther was backed by
fewer than 1 percent.
   Meanwhile, Lonsdale has made huge gains in his campaign against
Hatfield, a 24-year U.S. Senate veteran. Hatfield, who led by 36
points in an August survey, now leads Lonsdale 49 percent to 43
percent.
   The random telephone poll of 600 Oregon voters was taken Sept.
25-30 by Griggs-Anderson Research of Portland.

to new polls.
   A random telephone poll conducted by Champaign-based Midwest

those questioned, while Edgar was selected by 40 percent. But
Hartigan's 4 percentage point edge was within the poll's margin of
error of plus or minus 5 percentage points.
   One percent of those polled supported another candidate, and 15
percent were undecided. The sample included 415 likely voters
questioned between Sept. 26 and Monday.
   A similar poll by Midwest Television in August found Edgar was
the choice of 42 percent of those polled, while 40 percent backed
Hartigan, 1 percent favored another candidate. Seventeen percent
were undecided.
   Another poll released late Wednesday by Chicago television
station WLS-TV showed 43 percent of the voters favoring Edgar, 42
percent favoring Hartigan, and 15 percent undecided.
   The WLS poll of 900 registered voters was conducted Sept. 23 to

<HEAD>New Wellstone Ad Adds To Friction Between Senate Candidate Camps</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Senate candidate Paul Wellstone's
latest TV ad shows him in a madcap effort to engage Republican Sen.
Rudy Boschwitz in debate.
   The ``Looking for Rudy'' ad, which aired Wednesday and Thursday,
is a takeoff on the 1989 documentary ``Roger and Me'' in which a
filmmaker tries to track down General Motors Chairman Roger Smith
to ask him about auto-worker layoffs.
   The two-minute video - four times the usual length of a TV
political spot - shows Democrat Wellstone striding into Boschwitz's
campaign headquarters and Senate offices, confronting startled
campaign staff members and getting politely rebuffed.
   Wellstone's newest entry in the TV ad campaign and earlier radio
and TV ads have prompted Boschwitz's campaign press secretary to
label the challenger a ``leftist hustler'' and an ``Abbie
Hoffman-type character.''
   An Oct. 14 debate between the candidates tentatively has been
agreed on and negotiations on two additional debates are under way,
said Boschwitz's press secretary, Jay Novak.
   Wellstone ``is more interested in dramatic gestures ... and
generating notoriety for himself than in advancing any serious
agenda,'' said Novak.
   Wellstone adviser Pat Forciea said Boschwitz should be the last
to criticize anyone's use of ads.
   ``His entire career ... has been based on show business and
ads,'' said Forciea, who added that Boschwitz is spending far more
on ads than Wellstone is.
   ``I guess our pea-shooter's got pretty good aim,'' Forciea said.

   A 17-year-old mother carrying her week-old son
on a Brooklyn street was fatally stabbed, bringing one day's toll
of teen-age victims in the city to one dead, five wounded.
   Deborah Joseph was stabbed once in the chest Wednesday afternoon
by another 17-year-old girl with whom she had a long-standing
dispute, polic said Thursday.
   Joseph was holding her week-old son, Darren, and walking with a
friend when she saw her attacker brandishing a knife.
   The mother handed the baby to her friend and began to flee, but
was outrun by the assailant, who fatally stabbed her in the chest.
The suspect fled after the stabbing, and had not been arrested,
police said.
   A spate of shootings that left five teen-agers wounded Wednesday
began at a popular Manhattan dance club at 3:30 a.m., when a
17-year-old-girl was shot in the face by a young man with whom she
refused to dance, police said.
   Rodney Selby, 22, was charged with attempted murder and criminal
possession of a handgun, which was not recovered, Police Officer
Fred Weiner said. The victim, Sayeeda Kelly, was listed in stable
condition at St. Vincent's Hospital.
   Two girls in Harlem, ages 13 and 14, were shot and wounded by a
14-year-old boy at 7 p.m., during what police said was a lover's
quarrel.
   An investigator at the 32nd Precinct detective squad would only
say of the shootings, ``It's typical. You have a gun, you use it.''
   The 14-year-old suspect, identified by police as Vaughn
Chiddick, was charged with attempted murder, first-degreee assault,
criminal possession of a deadly weapon and first-degree reckless
endangerment.
   In the Bronx, two 15-year-olds were shot and wounded in separate
incidents.
   In the first shooting, the victim was shot in the left leg
shortly after 9 p.m. The motive, as well as the suspect and the
type of gun used, were not known.
   The other youth was shot at 10:15 p.m. on what was described as
a drug-prone street in the Fordham section. Police said the
shooting was believed to be motivated by a previous street fight
between the two teen-agers. The suspect fled and was not
immediately arrested.
   Lt. Joel Pierson, head of the detective squad that investigated
the two Bronx shootings, said the average age of shooting victims
in the city was getting younger.
   ``Throughout the city there's an overall increase in shooting
incidents and it works its way down to younger people being shot,''
said Pierson. ``In every precinct there are more and more young
people being shot.''

<HEAD>Journalist Who Defended Soviet News Blackout of Watergate Dead at
78</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sergei G. Lapin, a former diplomat and journalist
who told U.S. correspondents during the Watergate scandal that the
story was not worth reporting in the Soviet Union, died Thursday,
according to state television. He was 78.
   In a career that spanned six decades, Lapin served as head of
two of the most powerful Soviet media organizations - the
Gostelradio television and radio agency and the official Soviet
news agency Tass.
   ``Sergei Georgiyevich Lapin put all his strength and heart into
all this. And today his heart stopped,'' said an anchorwoman on
Soviet television's nightly newscast ``Vremya.''
   The obituary did not give a cause of death, mention survivors or
say when memorial services are planned. Tass, where Lapin once
worked, did not immediately carry a report of his death.
   In a 1974 interview with U.S. reporters in Moscow, Lapin was
repeatedly asked why Soviet TV viewers had been kept in the dark
about then-President Nixon's Watergate troubles. He said the story
was an ``internal problem'' of the United States and that Soviet
media did not report ``rumors.''
   ``Only facts, without forecasting, without rumors. We never
analyze rumors,'' he said when asked why Soviet media didn't report
the possibility Nixon might be impeached.
   Soviet media have since become much more open in line with
Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of glasnost.
   Lapin headed Gostelradio from 1970-85 and before that was
general director of Tass for three years. He was ambassador to
Austria from 1956-60 and to China from 1965-67. He began his
journalistic career in 1932, working for Leningrad newspapers.

<TEXT>
   I would like to answer today a question that has been put to me
for many weeks. It is the question about whether I will agree to
run for the office of president of the Polish republic, if my
candidacy is put forward.
   This is the question I have been thinking about for many hours,
many days and weeks. It was even commonly thought that it took too
long. But this is a question that is very difficult for me
personally, and generally; personally, with regard to the
circumstances in which I must answer it, and generally, in view of
the great responsibility of this office.
   The time for an answer has come and today I want to give this
answer, a short one.
   Following great deliberations and consideration of all
circumstances, I have decided to express approval if my candidacy
is put forward.
   One must move forward. One cannot retreat from the path Poland
has chosen and fought for so hard this year. One cannot expose it
to dangers. One has to go forward in a better, faster and more sure
way - but along this path, not a different one.
   Poland, which has a great chance in today's world and in Europe,
should take the place that is due to it - of a wise country, based
on Christian values, of a country of people who are tolerant toward
each other, a country that co-exists well with all its neighbors.
   I want to defend this line and these values, and my decision
stems from these motives. I am making it with a total feeling of
modesty. I know there are many who are more worthy of this
position. I am making it because the historical situation has put
me in such a position.
   This is all I can say today. About the difficulty of this
decision, about a broader and further program, I will talk at some
other time.
   Today I only want to pass my best greetings to all of you who
are listening to me.''

   Storms caused damage and injuries Thursday in Mississippi, and
rain was scattered across broad sections east of the Mississippi
Valley.
   High wind whipped through a trailer park at Verona, Miss.,
during heavy thunderstorms early Thursday, slightly injuring two
people, damaging several mobile homes and uprooting trees,
authorities said.
   Officials worked to restore power for residents, schools and
City Hall. Officials said schools were open despite power outages.
   National Weather Service and civil defense officials had not
determined if the damage was caused by a tornado.
   The weather service reported a storm that might have been a
tornado at Royal, Ala., and damaging gusty wind at Hartselle, Ala.,
and near the Louisa-Fluvanna County line in Virginia.
   During the afternoon, showers and thunderstorms reached across
western South Carolina, eastern Tennessee, the northwest half of
Georgia, Alabama, the Florida Panhandle, southern and central
Mississippi, southern and central Louisiana and the upper Texas
Gulf Coast. Showers and thunderstorms also reached from the South
Carolina coast across northeastern and east-central Florida.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours up to 2 p.m. EDT included
1.75 inches at Galveston, Texas; 1.32 at Mary Esther, Fla.; 1.28 at
Columbus, Miss.; 1.25 at Valparaiso, Fla.; and 1.09 at Huntsville,
Ala.
   It also was warm across the South.
   Brownsville, Texas, tied its record high of 95, on the books
since 1900. Corpus Christie, Texas, warmed to a record 95 and
Jacksonville, Fla., hit a record 94.
   Showers occurred along a cold front extending over western
Vermont, New York state, eastern Ohio, West Virginia, Pennsylvania,
western Maryland, western Virginia and western North Carolina.
   Showers and thunderstorms were scattered over western Lower
Michigan, northwestern Idiana, southeastern Wisconsin, northern
Illinois and east-central Ohio.
   Thunderstorms produced small hail in Lower Michigan during the
early afternoon, the weather service said.
   In the Northwest, showers and thunderstorms spread across
western Montana, the Idaho Panhandle, northeastern Washington state
and western Washington state.
   Wyoming had high wind with gusts to around 50 mph at Cheyenne,
Laramie and Vendauwoo, and 59 mph at Cody. Wind gusted to 63 mph at
Livingston, Mont.
   The center of Tropical Storm Klaus was near the island of
Antigua, with strongest sustained wind speed of 60 mph. The
National Hurricane Center said the storm was likely to strengthen
and hurricane warnings were posted for the northern Leeward
Islands. Another tropical storm, Josephine, was in the mid-Atlantic
with winds of 65 mph.
   Thursday's low for the Lower 48 states was 24 at Gunnison, Colo.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 44 at
International Falls, Minn., to 97 at both Beeville and Harlingen,
Texas.

   Another group of Americans will be flown out
of Iraq and Kuwait next Wednesday on a U.S.-government charter
flight, the State Department said Thursday.
   The approximate number of Americans who will board the flight
was not disclosed but officials said the total could be significant
because a Boeing 747 has been chartered.
   During September, about 1,900 Americans - almost all of them
women and children - were allowed to fly out of Iraq and Kuwait.
The flights were halted Sept. 22 because the State Department said
virtually all those who wanted to leave and had permission to do so
had departed.
   But U.S. officials, asking not to be identified, said that since
Sept. 22, a number of Americans with permission to leave have made
their presence known to U.S. diplomatic officials and said they
wanted to return to the United States.
   The State Department said late last month that at least 900 U.S.
citizens remained trapped, including 600 to 700 in Kuwait and 300
to 350 in Iraq.
   Almost all are adult males, more than 100 of whom have been
detained by Iraqi authorities and taken to military and industrial
sites. The Iraqis believe the presence of the Americans these
locations will deter a U.S. military attack.

   Here is President Bush's statement at the
White House on Thursday on prospects for a conventional-arms
treaty:
   Yesterday in the Rose Garden we celebrated the dawn of a new era
for Germany and welcomed the prospect of a Europe whole and free.
But despite these dramatic political events, Europe is still the
site of the greatest concentration of armed strength in the world.
   As Europe is transformed politically, we must also redraw the
military map of the continent and lift some of the shadows and
fears that we and our allies have lived with for nearly half a
century.
   Today, Secretary Baker will describe our latest efforts to
ensure that the political transformation of Europe is matched in
the military field in our negotiations to reduce and limit
conventional armed forces in Europe - the so-called CFE talks.
   Some of you here will remember when in May of 1989 at the NATO
summit I proposed a series of initiatives to quicken the pace in
CFE, and I pledged then to devote our full effort to the speedy
conclusion of a CFE agreement, a treaty that would decisively
improve the balance of military power on the continent and back our
hopes for lasting stability.
   We followed through on that commitment, and there is still -
let's face it - more work to do. And I want to remind you that CFE
is not an accord between the United States and the Soviet Union. It
will be a treaty among 22 states, East and West. All must be
satisfied with the treaty's provisions.
   We've consulted repeatedly with our allies about our efforts,
both before New York and then during the many talks up there. We
believe our allies are pleased with the progress being made.
Pending further consultation with our NATO partners, we have agreed
in principle with the Soviet Union on resolution of all the major
remaining issues in CFE and on many of the essential details as
well.
   Along with our allies, we will continue to push to complete this
treaty next month so that the way is clear for convening a CSCE
summit in Paris.
   In conclusion, I want to thank the secretary of state and the
people that have been working with him during these negotiations.
And let me just say how pleased I am with the progress that we have
achieved here.
   And I would like to now turn to Secretary Baker who has a
statement and then he'll be glad to take your questions. Well done.
Good luck to you.

   The official GOP candidate dropped out of
Louisiana's U.S. Senate race Thursday to boost the Democratic
incumbent's chances of defeating ex-Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke
without a runoff.
   State Sen. Ben Bagert's withdrawal turned Saturday's Senate
primary election into essentially a two-man race between three-term
Sen. Bennett Johnston and Duke, a state legislator who is running
as a Republican without party support.
   Bagert's name will remain on the ballot, but the Secretary of
State Fox McKeithen said votes for Bagert would not be counted if
he formally notified state officials he was out. That makes it
almost certain one candidate would get more than half the votes and
avert a runoff.
   National GOP leaders had openly expressed fear that Bagert would
pull enough votes to force Duke and Johnston into a runoff Nov. 6.
With Duke on the ballot, labeled as a Republican, the race could
hurt GOP candidates nationwide.
   ``All of us would be embarrassed and mortified to have to serve
in the United States Senate with David Duke masquerading as a
Republican,'' said Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo.
   Bagert said his polls indicated that Duke's support was
unwavering and that the Bagert ads were drawing votes from
Johnston.
   ``As my campaign finally began to get on track in the last
couple of weeks,'' Bagert said, ``it became more and more apparent,
that instead of forcing a runoff between myself and Bennett
Johnston, I might very well be forcing a runoff between somebody
else and Bennett Johnston.''
   After announcing his decision, Bagert was asked if he would vote
for Johnston. ``Yes, reluctantly,'' he replied. ``I'm not endorsing
anybody, but I'm not voting for David Duke.''
   Duke and Johnston said Bagert's withdrawal was good news.
   ``It's been a two-man race for some time and this makes it very
clear. The Bagert vote kind of confused things,'' said Johnston.
``I'm very much hoping that that Bagert vote, which has been about
8 percent, would come to me.''
   ``I think if he gets out we'll just have to whip Johnston in the
first primary,'' Duke said. He called it a clear choice between a
liberal and a conservative.
   Louisiana's unique open primary system puts all candidates on
one ballot, regardless of party. If no one gets more than 50
percent of the vote, a runoff is held between the top two
vote-getters.
   Despite several polls that have shown him a distant second to
Johnston in recent months, Duke said his own polls show him running
even with the incumbent. He said Bagert's withdrawal will help him
win the election because he will pick up Bagert's votes.
   But pollster Joe Walker said Bagert's decision ``kind of decides
it for Johnston.''
   ``The polls I've seen indicate that the Bagert vote is not a
Duke vote,'' said Walker. ``Bagert has run as a very strident
anti-Duke candidate from the very beginning. So as a result, the
vote he did attract is not one that would transfer to Duke.''
   Although Johnston has voted a conservative line on such issues
as defense spending and aid to the Nicaraguan Contras, he was
attacked by Duke and Bagert as an ``ultra-liberal.'' One reason was
his lead role in defeating former President Reagan's nomination of
Judge Robert Bork to the Supreme Court. Another was his support of
the Civil Rights Act of 1990, which his opponents said would impose
racial hiring quotas on American businesses.
   ``I'm going to vote for the things the people of this state want
and now we're going to have a clear-cut choice and I can win on
Saturday,'' said Duke, who has run a campaign calling for welfare
reform and an end to affirmative action programs.
   But the most recent poll indicated Johnston could eke out a
first-ballot victory even with Bagert in the race.
   The poll released Wednesday by Mason-Dixon Opinion Research of
Columbia, Md., showed Johnston was the choice of 53 percent of
voters surveyed. Duke drew 26 percent, while Bagert polled 8
percent. Thirteen percent were undecided, according to the poll,
which had a margin of error of 3.5 points. The poll of 825
registered voters was taken Sunday through Tuesday.
   Still, Mason-Dixon officials and other pollsters generally agree
that Duke has hidden support. As Susan Howell, a pollster at the
University of New Orleans put it, Duke ``flies under radar.''
   Bagert had been endorsed by President Bush in radio and
television ads. But polls consistently showed him running a poor
third.
   Eight Republican senators from other states endorsed Johnston on
Wednesday - a move Johnston called unprecedented in party politics.
   In Washington, Charles Black, chief spokesman for the Republican
Party, said Bagert's withdrawal was ``just the final insurance
against Duke getting any further.''
   Three minor candidates also were on the ballot, but one dropped
out earlier this week ``to help Johnston.'' The others weren't
expected to affect the outcome.

<HEAD>Education Department Stops Loans to 14 Trade Schools</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TAMARA HENRY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos, vowing to
``protect the integrity of the federal student aid programs,'' on
Thursday stopped funding to 14 trade schools for alleged violation
of rules.
   Using emergency authority granted the Education Department less
than two weeks ago, Cavazos said an investigation found the
for-profit institutions violated rules governing student financial
assistance programs, including falsifying student records and
misrepresenting education programs, facilities, tuition and fees.
   ``We are honoring our pledge to take action against those who
would abuse such programs,'' Cavazos said in a statement.
   The schools named include: Transwestern Institute and
Metropolitan Business College, both of Long Beach, California;
Balin Institute of Technology, Atlanta; Metropolitan Business
College, Port Orchard, Wash.; and Hartford Modern School of
Welding, Hartford, Conn.
   Nine others are located in Florida. They are Cocoa Beach Beauty
College, Cocoa Beach; National Beauty Academy, Tampa; Titusville
Beauty School, Titusville; and various Romar schools in Winter
Park, Palm Bay, Merritt Island, Melbourne and Kissimmee.
   The schools will have an opportunity to show cause why the
sanction should be lifted.
   Cavazos' action is the first under regulations implementing the
Student Loan Reconciliation Amendments of 1989, which became
effective Sept. 21. Those rules say that funds may be withdrawn
from a school and its students if there is reliable information
that the school is violating the law and immediate action is
necessary to prevent misuse of federal funds.
   According to officials, the emergency actions taken against the
14 schools were based on:
   -Falsification of student records;
   -Using the availability of federal student aid funds to recruit
students to an institution that has misrepresented its education
programs, facilities, tuition and fees, or the employment prospects
of its graduates;
   -Failure to make required refunds to students who withdrew prior
to graduation;
   -Approving federal financial aid for students enrolled in
ineligible programs;
   -Failure to account for federal funds received;
   -Approving federal financial aid for students who did not have
the ability to benefit from the training.

<HEAD>Newspaper That Prints Only Arrests Goofs, Costs Man Job</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Informer was supposed to fight
crime by printing the names of everyone arrested for a crime in the
St. Petersburg area. But readers of the newspaper's very first
issue were misinformed.
   The Informer erroneously reported that a man had been arrested
on a cocaine charge, costing him his job. The newspaper's
publisher, Ray Aden, is contrite but still believes his publication
can serve its purpose.
   ``Unfortunately,'' he said, ``some people might be hurt.''
   ``He was relying on his people to be accurate and one of them
messed up,'' said Shawn Exposito, 23, who was fired from his
$500-a-week job as a carpet installer just a month after the birth
of his third child. ``It couldn't have come at a worse time.''
   Aden said he will print a retraction and do everything he can to
help out Exposito, but that doesn't include an offer to make up for
his lost income.
   Exposito's boss at M&amp;M Floor Co., co-owner Bert Butler, has
tried to help by giving him a lesser job at half the pay until his
previous position reopens. Butler already had hired someone else to
replace his employee of eight years.
   Even before its first issue, The Informer drew skeptical
comments from civil libertarians concerned that it would overlook
the presumption of innocence until guilt is proven.
   The Informer correctly printed that Exposito was arrested last
month for driving with a suspended driver's license. It also
printed that he was arrested on a cocaine charge, which jail
records show is inaccurate.
   Butler saw the drug arrest item Friday and fired Exposito the
next day.
   ``Maybe I acted a little too quickly, but still, in my business
I'm sending this man into another person's house,'' Butler said.
``Would you want a drug addict, someone that's thought of as doing
drugs, in your home? I know I wouldn't.''
   Exposito took work in the carpet warehouse until his old job
opens up.
   ``It's a raw deal for Shawn,'' Butler said. ``These people
shouldn't print anything before they get the facts straight.''
   Aden said he is still trying to determine how the mistake was
made and is trying to find another job for Exposito.
   ``He calls me sometimes two or three times a day,'' Exposito
said. ``I'm sure he's losing sleep over this, probably not as much
as I am.''

<TEXT>
   The flag atop the royal palace flew
at half-staff Thursday as the family prepared to bury Princess
Caroline's husband, killed in a speedboat accident defending his
world champion title.
   A public funeral for Stefano Casiraghi was scheduled for
Saturday morning at the Cathedral of Monaco, three days after he
died during the World Offshore Championships, the palace announced.
   The 41 other boats competing in the event withdrew from the
third and final round, also scheduled for Saturday, and planned a
memorial Mass on Friday followed by a wreath-laying at sea,
organizers said.
   Several racers competing Wednesday against the 30-year-old
Casiraghi said he was driving too fast to handle the choppy water.
One newspaper called his boat a ``floating coffin.''
   The catamaran, which hit by a large wave, somersaulted and
Casiraghi slammed into the water.
   The principality press office said Casiraghi was strapped in to
a seat in the boat but was standing, as was his custom, at the time
of the accident.
   ``That explains why he died on impact,'' said a spokesman,
adding that Casiraghi's head caught the brunt of the crash. In a
seated position, the driver has some protection in his plexiglass
cockpit.
   Race organizers had announced the resumption of the competition
Saturday, saying the interrupted second round would be abandoned.
But organizers, speaking at a news conference, said all 41
remaining boats withdrew from the competition and the 1990 offshore
championships were canceled.
   Press reports said Casiraghi had told his family he would quit
racing after the championships. In a letter reproduced in the
event's official program, Casiraghi paid homage to Caroline, 33,
``who supported me throughout, despite the fears that I caused her
...''
   It was not immediately clear whether Casiraghi would be buried
in the royal family's tomb or in the Casiraghi family's chapel at
Fino Mornasco in Italy.
   Residents of the principality, but not tourists, were allowed to
file past Casiraghi's body in a mortuary near the Princess Grace
Hospital.
   He lay in a simple, brass-handled mahogany coffin, still wearing
the red-and-white racing suit in which he died. There was a slight
cut under one eye.
   A press aide to the royal family said Caroline went to the
mortuary Wednesday night, after hurrying back from a visit to
Paris, and again Thursday morning. She was described as composed
and dignified.
   Prince Rainier III, who never married after the death of former
Hollywood star Princess Grace eight years ago in a car accident,
spent the day at the Casiraghi home, not far from the palace,
according to press reports.
   Several drivers and crew members, while expressing sorrow at his
death, said Casiraghi was going too fast and should have realized
he was risking death.
   ``The guy was driving like a madman,'' said Simon Fletcher, a
British mechanic for one of the other boats. ``All the other boats
had slowed down after the first buoy after it (the water) got
rough.''
   Nice Matin, the main regional newspaper, claimed the ``Pinot de
Pinot'' was a ``floating coffin,'' its design ill-suited to its
enormous potential for speed.
   Bruno Plchetti, another Italian driver, was quoted as telling
the newspaper France-Soir: ``We were going much too fast, but
nobody wanted to slow down because we wanted to catch the ones in
front of us (including Casiraghi).''
   Several people connected to the offshore racing circuit said
Casiraghi normally has his own helicopter rescue crew flying near
his boat during a race but did not have one in the air Wednesday.
   Shops and businesses in Monaco remained open Thursday, and
streets were busy. Throughout the city, there were posters
promoting the speedboat race, showing a picture of Casiraghi and
his co-pilot, Patrice Innocenti.
   According to other racers, Innocenti - who was injured - was
handling the steering, while Casiraghi was controlling the throttle
of the boat. The 42-foot boat flipped over while ahead of the pack
at the start of the second round.
   Innocenti ejected, but Casiraghi did not as the two-engine,
five-ton boat slammed into the water upside down. It sank moments
after rescuers reached it.
   Casiraghi had competed in offshore racing since 1984, winning 12
of 80 races, including last year's world championship held off
Atlantic City, N.J.
   Caroline, the oldest child of Prince Rainier and Princess Grace,
divorced French playboy Philippe Junot in 1980. She married
Casiraghi on Dec. 29, 1983 in a simple civil ceremony under a
portrait of her late mother.
   They had three children - Andrea, 6; Charlotte, 4 and Pierre, 3.

   A House subcommittee approved a bill Thursday
that would put into federal law a woman's right to an abortion as
ruled in the Supreme Court decision Roe vs. Wade.
   ``The language of the bill is drawn directly from Roe,'' said
Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., chairman of the House Judiciary
subcommittee on civil and constitutional rights.
   He said the Freedom of Choice Act was necessary to preserve the
reproductive options women have had since the Supreme Court
decision was issued.
   ``It is clear from recent Supreme Court decisions that Roe is in
jeopardy,'' Edwards said. ``American women can no longer rely on
the courts to protect their right to choose. Nor can we leave this
vital issue up to a patchwork of state laws.''
   Five Democrats voted for the bill and three Republicans voted
against it. The action came after two days of hearings. A similar
version is pending in the Senate.
   Edwards said he would press the House leadership for speedy
consideration of the measure. However, time is running out on the
session and the prospects of the bill making it through Congress
this year are dim.
   Rep. Christopher Smith, R-N.J., said he would welcome a floor
fight on Edwards' bill, calling it an ``abortion on demand''
measure.
   Although Smith said it was unlikely to reach the floor during
the current session, he said the bill ``would seek to overturn many
state laws'' restricting abortion.
   Among other things, he said, it would override state laws
requiring spousal and parental consent for the procedure.
   Republican Reps. William Dannemeyer of California and James
Sensenbrenner of Wisconsin offered a host of amendments seeking
provisions restricting abortions under certain circumstances, and
each failed by a straight party line vote.
   ``I think the bill is an extremist bill,'' said Sensenbrenner,
who failed in an attempt to attach an amendment permitting states
to enact laws shielding physicians who refuse to perform abortions
for religious or moral reasons.
   ``This goes far beyond the scope of Roe vs. Wade,'' he said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The loss of wetlands on private lands slowed
significantly during the mid-1980s, Agriculture Secretary Clayton
Yeutter said Thursday.
   Yeutter said new figures by the department's Soil Conservation
Service indicated wetland losses ranged from 100,000 to 200,000
acres per year from 1982 to 1987, including areas that reverted to
open water.
   This was ``significantly less'' than wetland loss estimates
before 1982, he said.
   No previous conservation service estimates were available.
Spokeswoman Diana Morse said the agency began its five-year surveys
in 1977. The new figures comparing 1987 with 1982 were the first,
she said.
   The new figures came from the agency's 1987 National Resources
Inventory, or NRI, which is conducted on non-federal lands every
five years in cooperation with the Iowa State University
Statistical Laboratory.
   Officials said the inventory serves as the main source of
information on the status, condition and trends of soil, water and
related resources. It also provides a soil-and-water data base for
non-federal rural lands.
   The report said there were about 82 million acres of wetlands on
non-federal rural lands in 1987, down from 83.2 million acres in
1982, a decline of nearly 1.2 million acres.
   However, the service estimated the loss of wetlands to
agricultural and development uses at ``closer to 500,000 acres,''
or an average of 100,000 acres a year.
   ``The remaining change in wetlands was due to factors such as
300,000 acres changing from private to federal ownership - still
likely remaining in wetlands but not included in the service's
non-federal lands inventory - and over 400,000 acres that changed
to open water, primarily adjacent to the Great Salt Lake in Utah
and in southern Louisiana,'' the report said.
   Of the nearly 500,000 acres lost to agriculture and development,
about 215,000 were converted farmland, including wetlands drying up
because of drought and about 280,000 acres to development.
   Regionally, the inventory indicated wetland losses over the
five-year period were greatest in the Southeast, Mississippi Delta
states, and the Great Lakes states.
   Losses were reported at 170,000 acres in the Southeast, 150,000
in the Delta, and 80,000 in the Great Lakes.
   Morse said that there were no available breakdowns by state and
that the service considered those estimates too inexact for
publishing. She said the regional estimates were the only ones the
agency had available at the present time.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A vaccine that prevents bacterial meningitis
and other life-threatening diseases now can be given to infants as
young as two months to protect them when they most need it.
   The Food and Drug Administration, in approving Thursday use of
the vaccine at younger ages, said new studies show it is safe and
effective for these infants and could prevent hundreds of deaths a
year.
   The vaccine was approved in 1988 for use in children 18 months
and older, and later for use in children 15 months and older.
However, bacterial meningitis and other diseases caused by the
Haemophilus influenzae type b bacteria take their heaviest toll in
infants ages six to 12 months.
   The vaccine has significantly reduced incidence of the
Haemophilus b diseases in children 18 months and older, but
physicians still diagnose about 10,000 cases of Haemophilus
meningitis a year, mostly in children under 18 months, the FDA
said.
   About 500 of these children die and of those who survive, about
3,800 children suffer blindness, deafness, mental retardation and
other neurological complications, the FDA said.
   When the vaccine was first approved, federal health officials
said data were not available to show the vaccine was effective in
younger children.
   But a recently completed two-and-a-half year, multiracial and
multiethnic study of more than 60,000 infants less than six months
old showed the vaccine was safe and would protect against the
Haemophilus b diseases, the FDA said.
   The vaccine can be given at the same intervals as the
diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis vaccine - two months, four months
and six months, the agency said. A booster dose would be given when
the child is 15 months or older.
   Researchers found only mild and transient side effects among the
infants in the study, including swelling and warmth at the
vaccination site and occasional fever.
   Besides bacterial meningitis, the vaccine is effective against
epiglottitis, which is an often fatal inflammation of the flap that
covers the breathing tubes, pneumonia, septicemia and septic
arthritis.
   The vaccine is not effective against viral meningitis.
   The vaccine, marketed under the name HibTITER, is made by Praxis
Biologics Inc. and is distributed by Lederle Laboratories, both
part of American Cyanamid of Wayne, N.J.

Beitchman told the Tribune-Review of Greensburg. ``I just know that
on Tuesday morning I got a bunch of anonymous calls and people were
applauding in the background.''
   Beitchman, 43, a former senior editor at Sports Illustrated,
resigned Monday after 18 months on the job. Earlier that day, he
was arraigned in Bucks County on charges of impersonating a public
servant and harassment by communication.
   The Bucks County district attorney's office has alleged
Beitchman threatened a Bucks County man for trying to collect $921
in damages against Beitchman's brother, Arthur, after a May 8,
1989, car accident.
   In one of four telephone calls made to the man on March 13,
Beitchman allegedly used the name and title of Deputy Attorney
General William Finnegan.
   Beitchman said Wednesday he will prove his innocence at a
hearing next week but does not plan to return to the paper.
   ``I think it is a sign from above that it is time to move on,''
he said.
   Beitchman faces other charges in Cambria County. West Hills
Regional Police charged him with drunken driving on Sept. 2, when
Beitchman was heading home from a wedding reception.
   Police said he had a blood-alcohol level of 0.237 percent, more
than twice the state's legal intoxication limit of 0.10.

<TEXT>
   West African soldiers ousted rebel
leader Charles Taylor from positions in the capital Wednesday and
fought over an airfield that could be used to fly much-needed
supplies to the starving capital.
   A spokesman for the multinational army said its 4,000 soldiers
had forced Taylor's rebels out of the city center and were fighting
his troops at Spriggs Payne airfield and the national radio
station, which Taylor has been using.
   Once the West Africans gain control of the airfield it could be
used to fly in desperately needed food and medicine. Most of
Monrovia's 400,000 residents have had little to eat for weeks.
   Remnants of slain President Samuel Doe's army and rival rebel
leader Prince Johnson support the West African offensive, now in
its third day. The West Africans aim to neutralize Taylor and
install an interim government to organize fair elections.
   Taylor is opposed to foreign intervention in Liberia's
9-month-old civil war, which Taylor started Dec. 24 when he invaded
from Ivory Coast.
   The five-nation West African force also set up armored cars and
sandbags around the presidential palace and the downtown barracks
Wednesday to prevent Prince Johnson from launching attacks on
government troops holed up there.
   Johnson's soldiers captured and killed Doe in September and have
been hunting down the remnants of his army.
   In fighting against Taylor's forces, the West Africans gained
control of Gardnersville, a suburb 2{ miles north of the city
center, and wiped out artillery batteries, said a West African
spokesman.
   Taylor had used the base to shell the port of Monrovia, where
the West African army has its headquarters. Ten refugees waiting to
be evacuated were killed by shells Tuesday and Wednesday, the
spokesman said, speaking on condition he not be named.
   Nigerian warplanes have made more than 30 sorties against
Buchanan and Robertsfield International Airport to cut Taylor's
lines of supply, said a West African diplomat in Freetown, capital
of neighoring Sierra Leone. Robertsfield is 35 miles east of
Monrovia and Buchanan is 50 miles further east.
   Taylor had left the multinational army no choice by refusing to
attend peace talks toward the establishment of the interim
government, said the diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``The only option left for the Economic Community of West
African States is to shoot at him, and more bombing attacks will
take place,'' the diplomat said.
   Taylor has declared himself president of Liberia. His men have
overrun most of the country, but have been unable to capture
Monrovia. Johnson, a former aide to Taylor, split off to form his
own guerrilla band in the spring.
   The war has claimed more than 5,000 lives, most of them
civilians, many killed simply because of tribal affiliation.
Members of Doe's Krahn tribe have been targeted by the rebels.
   In an incident Wednesday in the Mamba Point diplomatic enclave,
reporters watched as rebels of Johnson's army captured a woman.
   ``I am not a Krahn,'' the woman screamed. Ghanaian soldiers from
the West African force arrived from a checkpoint down the road and
forced the rebels to release the woman.

   Crews using body-sniffing dogs searched
Thursday through an apartment building destroyed by an apparent gas
explosion that killed at least five people.
   Cause of the pre-dawn blast was not established officially, but
firemen and gas company officials said it appeared to have been a
gas leak. Thirty-seven apartments were destroyed in the low-income
building near the western outskirts of Paris.
   Gas company investigators said preliminary findings suggest a
gas leak in in one of the apartments, rather than in a conduit
serving the entire five-story building.
   At least eight people, including a child, were injured. Seven of
the 49 residents were still unaccounted for late Thursday,
authorities said.
   ``We haven't heard any call for help from under the debris,''
said Jean-Louis Duffeigneux, a regional administrator.
   The search by about 170 rescue workers, including some teams
equipped with specially trained dogs, progressed slowly because of
danger from weakened walls and roof.
   Names of those killed were not immediately released.

<TEXT>
   Rep. Ralph Regula, R-Ohio, had hoped to spend
Wednesday evening in the president's box at the Kennedy Center,
watching ``The Playboy of the Western World'' with constituents.
   But the White House took away his seats because he opposes the
giant deficit-reduction bill that President Bush and congressional
leaders are trying to ram through Congress, Regula said Thursday.
   Regula said he received a telephone call Wednesday from a White
House lobbyist seeking his support for the package of tax increases
and spending cuts.
   When he said he remained in opposition, ``It was clear the box
wasn't available.''
   The congressman bought six tickets on his own for the play.
   ``There have been better moments,'' he said.
   Regula and his wife had planned to use the seats with two
couples who had won a trip to Washington at an annual charity
auction for Aultman Hospital in Canton, Ohio.
   Members of Congress and the Cabinet may use the president's box
when the president is not there, and they frequently do. But the
president controls the tickets.
   Regula said he opposes the budget measure because its $134
billion hit poor people too hard, and because it doesn't shrink
spending enough.
   White House spokesman Stephen Hart said he was not aware of the
incident.

<HEAD>Black Community Leaders Act To Help Catch Professor's Killer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENNIS GEORGATOS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Black community leaders, worried that police
may be preoccupied with finding a serial killer, have mobilized to
help track down the killer of a black college professor.
   Charles W. Thomas, a professor at the University of California's
San Diego campus, was found mortally wounded in his car Friday
night. His death has prompted James Del Rio, a retired Michigan
judge and legislator, to organize a reward fund for information
leading to an arrest.
   ``I think black people owe him. They are indebted to him and I'm
seeking to get them to repay it,'' said Del Rio. ``He used to have
a famous saying, `Don't mourn. Organize.' That's what we're trying
to do.''
   Del Rio, a longtime friend of Thomas, made a personal $1,000
donation to start the fund this week.
   By Thursday, he said, the fund had reached $4,200.
   Though he said he would work closely with police and the local
Crime Stoppers chapter, Del Rio said the fund is an independent
effort by the black community to try to help bring Thomas' killer
to justice.
   Police spokesman Bill Robinson said the department welcomes
assistance from the black community and will take the tips passed
on to investigators seriously.
   ``There's no law preventing citizens from helping police and as
long as these efforts don't interfere with our investigation, we
welcome the help,'' Robinson said.
   Del Rio noted that the police department's resources are being
taxed by the manhunt for a serial killer believed responsible for
the murders of five women in San Diego this year.
   ``They've got more murders going on than this one. That's why I
feel the black community should get off their duff and do
something,'' he said.
   Robinson insisted that the Police Department is working
vigorously to solve the Thomas case, despite the personnel drain
caused by the serial killer investigation.
   Thomas, 64, died Saturday at a hospital. Before he died, he was
able to describe his attacker, but police had not determined a
motive.
   ``A lot of people are trying to catch the peron who committed
this crime,'' said the Rev. George Walker Smith, who is black.
``White folks do it all the time. Black folks don't. I don't know
why, but now we're trying to do this so whoever did this gets
caught.''
   Smith, pastor at Christ United Presbyterian Church in southeast
San Diego, contributed $1,000 to the reward fund.
   Businessman Hartwell Ragsdale said he contributed $1,000 because
``we've had too many unsolved murders in the black community.''
   ``The black community must do what we can do ... to see to it
that the people who are destroying our leaders and other citizens
are brought to justice.''
   Memorial services for Thomas were scheduled Friday at UCSD and
at the First United Methodist Church. At the college, flags flew at
half staff this week in memory of Thomas, a psychologist and urban
studies professor at the university since 1971.
   Thomas sometimes surprised people with his teaching methods,
which were geared toward helping people understand root causes of
societal problems. For instance, to help his students understand
racism, Thomas brought white supremacist Tom Metzger into the
classroom.
   ``Thomas didn't consider that reading a person's work was
enough. He wanted the students to see, for example, that racists
truly believed in racism,'' said Cecil Lytel, a provost at UCSD.
``He took teaching beyond teaching and created lasting learning
experiences for his students.''

<TEXT>
   Two California producers of adult videotapes
were charged Thursday with violating federal obscenity laws by
shipping what prosecutors called hard-core pornography to Oklahoma.
   The indictment of the president and vice-president of a Van
Nuys, Calif. video company ``stakes out our commitment to
aggressively pursue large-scale producers of illegal hard-core
pornography,'' Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said in a
statement. ``They will be pursued in every state in the nation.''
   The indictment returned in Tulsa, Okla., is one of the few
federal obscenity cases brought against producers of pornography,
officials said.
   The Justice Department's pornography unit, which has generally
targeted distributors rather than producers, has been criticized by
civil libertarians since it was begun in the Reagan administration.
   Sidney Niekerk, the president of Cal Vista Ltd. of Van Nuys,
Calif., and Jack Gallagher, the company's vice president, were
charged in the five-count indictment with shipping four movies to
Broken Arrow, Okla.
   The indictment, which also named the company as defendant,
charged the two with conspiracy, interstate transportation of
obscene material, aiding and abetting and engaging in a business of
selling obscene matter.
   If convicted, Niekerk and Gallagher could be sentenced up to 25
years in prison and fined as much as $1.25 million. The company
faces a maximum fine of $2.5 million.
   The indictment resulted from a series of 24 searches in the Los
Angeles area conducted earlier this year by the the FBI and Los
Angeles police, the Justice Department said.
   The videocassettes showed a variety of sexual acts, including
group sex and lesbianism, the department said.
   Denver defense attorney Arthur Schwartz, who represents Niekerk,
said evidence will show that the company had never shipped its
videocassettes to Oklahoma until it was lured into doing so by
undercover federal agents.
   ``They were really ensnared into doing it,'' Schwartz said.
   The lawyer charged that Justice Department chose to bring
charges against his client in Oklahoma to take advantage of
conservative moral standards in that part of the country.
   ``The approach of the government in trying to regulate access to
sexually oriented material is to go to the most conservative areas
in the United States in an effort to pressure companies located in
more liberal areas out of existence,'' Schwartz said.
   ``Are the people in Tulsa going to decide what the people in New
York feel they have a right to have?''
   Federal juries are allowed to apply prevailing community
standards in deciding whether material is obscene. What may be
found to be obscene in Utah or Oklahoma may not be considered so by
a jury in another federal jurisdiction.

   NASA suffered another setback
Thursday when a toppled beam was found inside the space shuttle
Atlantis, but the countdown continued for the scheduled weekend
launch of Discovery.
   The space agency also faced another hurdle, in a Washington,
D.C., courtroom. A federal judge took under advisement a request by
anti-nuclear activists to halt Discovery's launch because its
satellite is powered by highly radioactive plutonium.
   He did not say when he would rule. The satellite, called
Ulysses, is being sent to study the sun in the Discovery mission
scheduled for liftoff Saturday.
   The 70-pound metal beam, painted bright yellow, was accidentally
left by workers inside Atlantis' engine compartment, said Forrest
McCartney, director of Kennedy Space Center. The beam was heard
crashing around in the compartment Wednesday when the orbiter was
being raised into an upright position in the assembly building.
   Workers found the 8-foot-11-inch-long beam on a pile of cables
inside the compartment after the solid fuel booster rockets and
external tank were attached to the orbiter Thurday.
   McCartney said a quick survey of the compartment found that
insulation covering some components and plumbing had been dented.
He said it was too soon to tell if the accident will delay
Atlantis' secret military flight scheduled for early November.
   Atlantis' mission already is four months late because of
hydrogen fuel leaks that grounded the craft in June. The leak
repairs were completed Friday.
   The beam, which had been used in a work platform, was left by an
experienced crew, McCartney aid. The paperwork indicated everything
had been removed, he said.
   ``It should have been caught and wasn't,'' McCartney said.
   McCartney said he did not see any connection between the latest
mishap and other accidents this year involving the shuttle fleet.
An investigation board concluded last week that workers' failure to
follow procedures and improper use of a clamp led to an accident
involving a thruster in July.
   The thruster, one of 14 on Discovery's right orbital maneuvering
system pad, was dented when it fell off a work stand.
   ``I don't think we can say procedures were a problem'' with
Atlantis, McCartney said. ``I don't think we can say training was a
problem. I think what we can say is that we did not do the job in
the way we intended to do it.''
   An investigative team was being formed to look into the matter.
NASA officials also were reviewing Discovery's paperwork and
equipment inventory to make sure nothing was overlooked in that
shuttle's engine compartment.
   Brewster Shaw, deputy director of shuttle operations, said he
did not anticipate any problems with Discovery.
   In Washington, the activists said they fear an accident like the
explosion of the shuttle Challenger would spew the deadly plutonium
over Florida.
   The same judge, Oliver Gasch of U.S. District Court, refused to
interfere with Atlantis' launch last October with a
plutonium-powered satellite bound for Jupiter.
   The activists, in their latest action, cited NASA's inability to
launch a shuttle in nearly half a year. Columbia, like Atlantis,
has been grounded for months by hydrogen leaks.
   Ulysses carries nearly 23.7 pounds of plutonium-238, half as
much as the Jupiter satellite. The decaying plutonium will provide
electricity for Ulysses during its 1.86 billion-mile journey
through space. To place it into an orbit over the sun's poles,
Ulysses will be sent to Jupiter to be kicked back by the planet's
gravity.
   Officials of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration
insist a plutonium generator is the only way to power Ulysses
through its long journey. Solar panels large enough to collect
light as far away as Jupiter could have been built. But they would
have added so much weight to 807-pound spacecraft that there would
not be a powerful enough launcher to lift it, said Derek Eaton,
Ulysses project manager for the European Space Agency.
   The agency provided the $250 million spacecraft.
   NASA's environmental impact study on Ulysses indicates a less
than one in 1 million chance of an accident resulting in a
plutonium-related cancer death. An Energy Department team of 70
people is setting up radiation-monitoring equipment as a
precaution.
   After Ulysses is released from Discovery, a two-stage engine and
a smaller booster engine will send it hurtling toward Jupiter at a
record speed of 34,450 mph. After Jupiter gives it a gravity
slingshot, it will pass over the sun's south pole in 1994 and the
north pole in 1995.
   Scientists expect to know whether Ulysses is safely on its way
shortly after the last engine fires and the spacecraft separates
from the booster, about 7{ hours after liftoff.
   Ulysses, ready to go since 1983, was assigned after several
launch delays to a May 1986 flight aboard Challenger. The shuttle's
explosion earlier that year resulted in the spacecraft being put
back in storage.
   If Discovery does not lift off by Oct. 23, the mission will have
to wait 13 months for the proper planetary alignment.
   ``It (success) is important for the project because we've been
around for a long time, and a delay means a delay in science and
more money,'' said Willis Meeks, NASA's project manager for
Ulysses. ``But I think it would be very important to the morale of
all of us in this business to see the shuttle flying again.''

<TEXT>
   A special counsel's report that recommends an
ethics investigation proceed against Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr.
gives important weight to the timing of a fund-raiser held by
savings and loan figure Charles H. Keating Jr., sources close to
the probe said Thursday.
   The March 23, 1987, fund-raiser occurred just before meetings
between senators and U.S. banking regulators.
   Five senators intervened with regulators on behalf of Keating, a
major political donor, as his S&amp;L headed for collapse.
   Also influencing the recommendation was a brief discussion about
Keating between Riegle and the top U.S. thrift regulator - Edwin J.
Gray - on March 6, 1987, the sources said. Riegle suggested Gray
meet with senators and such a meeting occurred the next month.
   The information on Bennett's report was confirmed to The
Associated Press by sources who spoke only on condition of
anonymity.
   The Ethics Committee is looking for any connections between
actions by the senators and the $1.3 million in political donations
they received from the businessman and his associates.
   Congressional sources previously confirmed that Special Counsel
Robert S. Bennett recommended the probe continue against Riegle,
D-Mich., and Sens. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., and Dennis DeConcini,
D-Ariz.
   He also proposed that two senators be dropped from the
investigation: John McCain, R-Ariz., and John Glenn, D-Ohio.
   McCain met with the committee privately Thursday, a day after a
similar session with Glenn. The other three senators are to appear
over the next two weeks.
   Emerging after about three hours, McCain said he ``felt good''
about the session and predicted he would be exonerated before the
Senate adjourns later this month.
   The senator said the investigation has been politically damaging
and that Arizonans will ``judge my conduct'' by the outcome of the
inquiry.
   ``I refuse to believe the Ethics Committee would be motivated by
political concerns,'' said McCain, the only Republican among the
five.
   If his case is dismissed, only Democrats in the Senate would be
under investigation for their roles in the savings and loan mess.
   In the recommendations on Riegle, one source said Bennett was
``throwing up for committee the possibility that when a political
contribution is so close to an event, is there way it cannot be
connected?''
   ``He's wrestling with a new concept not articulated before in an
ethics ruling,'' the source said. ``There's never been a case like
this where people are looking to the appearance and proximity (of
contributions) as possible problems. Riegle epitomizes this because
his conduct, absent (receipt of Keating's) political contributions,
amounts to nothing.''
   Both the March fund-raiser and Riegle's meeting with Gray were
in close to crucial meetings between senators and banking
regulators April 2 and 9, 1987.
   Riegle only attended the second meeting, while the other
senators went to both sessions. The senators said they were trying
to ensure that Keating's Lincoln Savings and Loan was treated
fairly and have denied any links between Keating's money and their
assistance.
   The Irvine, Calif., thrift was taken over by federal regulators
in April 1989 and it may cost taxpayers more than $2 billion to
cover its losses.
   At the April 2 meeting between four senators and Gray, the chief
regulator said the lawmakers offered a deal that would have helped
Keating. The senators vigorously denied such an offer was made.
   The April 9 meeting was between all five senators and the San
Francisco-based regulators who were investigating Lincoln. The
examiners told the senators they were referring results of their
investigation to the criminal section of the Justice Department.
   Riegle's office has denied any links between the timing of the
March 23, 1987, fund-raiser and the April meetings.
   The senator's aide, David Krawitz, has said the event ``was
confirmed and scheduled on Jan 30, 1987,'' months before the
meetings with regulators were set up.
   Riegle raised $78,250 at the fund-raiser from Keating and his
associates. A year later, while maintaining there was no connection
between the contributions and the April 9 meeting, Riegle announced
he returned the money because it could ``create the appearance of a
conflict of interest.''

   The perils-of-Pauline finish of the Boston
Red Sox atop the American League's Eastern Division has not
captivated once-bitten David Souter, who will become the newest
Supreme Court justice Tuesday.
   ``After 1967 (when the team lost the World Series) I said I'm
never going to let myself get excited again about the Red Sox and I
have not done so,'' Souter said Thursday, the day after the Sox won
the division title.
   The Sox have many fans in New Hampshire and throughout the New
England states.
   Souter said he's a casual observer, not a true fan, and attended
a Red Sox-Baltimore Orioles game the day after concluding his
Senate confirmation testimony mainly because friends wanted him to
go.
   The biggest fan in the Souter family is the judge's mother, who
will be 83 this week. As a girl, she saw Babe Ruth play for the Red
Sox before his celebrated trade to the New York Yankees 1919, a
trade fans have recalled as ``the curse of the Bambino'' in
predicting eventual repetition of the team's late-season collapse.
   ``If I want to know a batting average or something,'' Souter
said, ``I can always call her up. She's the fan.''

   Deputies in Slovenia on Thursday
proposed a plebiscite on independence from Yugoslavia after
declaring many federal laws incompatible with the republic's newly
drawn constitution.
   In the neighboring republic of Croatia, deputies voted down a
proposal to follow Slovenia's lead and declare independence. Debate
also raged over ethnic tensions between Croats and Serbs. One irate
deputy hurled his briefcase at an opponent.
   In the Parliament of Slovenia, the smallest of Yugoslavia's six
republics, legislators ruled that 30 federal laws touching on the
economy, politics and defense were incompatible with the Slovenian
constitution as it was amended last week.
   A legislative committee called for a plebiscite on the creation
of an ``independent, sovereign state of Slovenia,'' the state news
agency Tanjug reported. But it was unclear whether such a vote
would have legal standing.
   The committee proposed the vote take place before the new
constitution is adopted in early November, Tanjug said.
   Slovenia has about 2 million people, less than 10 percent of the
Yugoslav population.
   Most leaders in the republic favor transforming Yugoslavia, a
loose federation of six republics, into a confederation in which
each state would have de facto sovereignty.
   This view is supported by Croatia, the only other republic to
have held free elections.
   Center-right parties trounced the Communists in recent balloting
in both republics.
   But the Communist rulers of Serbia, the largest republic, favor
more centralized control and vehemently oppose confederation.
   Tensions eased somewhat Thursday in a Serbian-majority enclave
of the Croatian republic that has been wracked by rioting in recent
days.
   In Knin, where armed Serbs set up roadblocks last Friday, rail
traffic to the coast gradually resumed, Tanjug said.
   The protesting Serbs, who make up 10 percent of Croatia's 5
million people, claim the center-right government of the republic
discriminates against them. Croatian authorities charge the
Communist government of Serbia is whipping up ethnic tensions to
destabilize Croatia's newly established democracy.
   Deputy Croatian Interior Minister Perica Juric said scores of
guns and 60,000 rounds of ammunition were seized by Serbs from
police armories in Petrinja, Glina and Dvor na Uni last week.
   Serbian Democratic Party delegate Radoslav Tanjga of Knin
accused Croatian authorities of ``continuous tyranny against the
Serbian people in Croatia.''
   Deputy Ivan Bobetko of the governing Croatian Democratic Party
hurled his briefcase at Tanjga, hitting the lectern, Tanjug said.

   A Soviet envoy carried a secret message from Mikhail Gorbachev
to Baghdad and Japan's prime minister met with Iraq's No. 2 leader
Thursday in new efforts for peace in the Persian Gulf. Five
Europeans used a 10-foot boat in a daring escape from Iraq and
plans were announced to evacuate more Americans.
   The USS Independence - the first American aircraft carrier in
the gulf in 16 years - left the waterway after a brief show of
force. A Navy warship enforcing a U.N. embargo on Iraq stopped a
Sudanese freighter from entering the Gulf of Aqaba, the Pentagon
said.
   Iraq, hurting from the international sanctions following its
Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, planned to argue its case before the
United Nations. The world body, which has condemned Iraq's invasion
and placed a naval and air embargo on the country, may consider
stronger measures.
   At the United Nations, Iraq's planned address to the General
Assembly was postponed after the nation's U.N. ambassador suffered
a nose bleed.
   Ambassador Abdul Amir al-Anbari was expected to read a statement
in response to President Bush's suggestion Monday that an
unconditional Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait could lead to
``opportunities'' toward a broad Middle East peace settlement.
   The ambassador was taken to a U.N. medical office for treatment
and then went home to rest. Cause of the nose bleed was not
immediately known.
   U.N. officials said the speech would be rescheduled, possibly
for Monday.
   British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd, following up on Bush's
suggestion, said Thursday that Israel must be prepared to negotiate
the Palestinian problem once Iraq withdraws from Kuwait. Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein has tried to link a pullout from Kuwait
with Israel's occupation of territories it captured in the 1967
Middle East war.
   In the Middle East, other diplomatic attempts to resolve the
2-month-old crisis continued.
   Yevgeny Primakov, a senior adviser to Gorbachev, arrived in
Baghdad carrying a message from the Soviet president, Soviet
diplomatic sources said. Its contents were not disclosed. Tass
quoted him as saying in Baghdad that a negotiated solution was
needed ``toavoid a military explosion.''
   Primakov planned to request that some of about 5,000 Soviet
citizens, most oil industry workers, be allowed to leave Iraq, the
diplomatic sources said.
   Primakov also met early Thursday with Palestine Liberation
Organization chairman Yasser Arafat in Amman, Jordan, and delivered
a message from Gorbachev, said a PLO source who requested
anonymity.
   Arafat met later in Baghdad with Saddam and the two ``agreed
that a political solution to the crisis is possible within an Arab
context,'' said a PLO source. The PLO has maintained ties with Iraq
since the invasion.
   Gorbachev said Thursday he saw no reason to send Soviet troops
to join the U.S.-led multinational force in the gulf. In response
to a query, Gorbachev told reporters in Moscow: ``I think there are
already more than enough troops there.''
   In the Jordanian capital of Amman, Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu
of Japan met with Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Taha Yassin Ramadan.
Ramadan, considered No. 2 to Saddam, rejected a negotiated
settlement to the crisis as long as foreign troops remain on Arab
soil, Baghdad's official Iraq News Agency reported.
   Kaifu insisted on Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait first, said
Shigeo Takenaka, Kaifu's spokesman. Kaifu, meeting later with
Jordan's King Hussein, granted $250 million in development loans to
Jordan, which has been hard-hit by the embargo of Iraq.
   French President Francois Mitterrand assured Saudi King Fahd
that he backed international efforts to isolate Iraq. The meeting
in the Saudi port of Jiddah followed Iraqi attempts to engage
France in separate peace talks.
   Also in Saudi Arabia, three Britons on Thursday said their fear
of Iraq sustained them during their daring escape. The three
Britons and two Frenchmen crammed aboard a 10-foot boat and spent
25 hours - much of the time being tossed in 10-foot swells - before
being rescued Wednesday.
   ``It's a trip I wouldn't like to do again, but it was well worth
it now that I am here,'' Mike Teesdale, 40, told a news conference
in the Saudi border town of Khafji. ``My fear was of Iraq, not of
the trip.''
   It was the first report of Western men escaping Iraq since
August. Iraq has allowed hundreds of Western women and children to
fly home aboard chartered planes.
   The British escapees said they had taken the 10-foot boat
through the marshes of southern Iraq, into the Shatt-al-Arab
waterway and then the gulf. Teesdale said the men had only a
compass to guide them and got lost several times before being
picked up by the Saudi coast guard.
   The Britons said they had been working on an oil installation
near the Iraqi port of Basra and the two Frenchmen were barge
masters. They were among a small number of Europeans living on
dwindling food supplies and denied permission to leave.
   Iraq is holding about 2,200 Westerners hostage in Kuwait and
Iraq, some at strategic installations to discourage attack by the
U.S.-led military forces that began massing in the region after
Iraq seized Kuwait.
   Nine of those hostages - all Frenchmen - returned to Paris on
Thursday after being freed by Iraq. Also Thursday, 173 Brazilians
arrived home after Brazil negotiated their release from Iraq.
   The U.S. State Department announced Thursday that another
special flight is planned for Wednesday for Americans to leave Iraq
and Kuwait. The exact number of Americans expected to board the
U.S.-government charter was not disclosed, but a Boeing 747 is
scheduled to be used. Some 747s can carry more than 500 passengers.
   The last U.S.-sanctioned special flight was Sept. 22, but more
Americans with permission to leave Iraq or Kuwait have come
forward, said U.S. officials who askednnot to be identified.
   The State Department said late last month that at least 900 U.S.
citizens - mostly men - remained trapped in Kuwait and Iraq.
   In Baghdad, a radical Palestinian group loyal to Iraq threatened
to launch ``powerful strikes'' if the United States endangers Iraqi
aircraft while enforcing the U.N. air embargo on Iraq. The
statement by the Arab Liberation Front was the second such threat
in as many days by radical Palestinians and heightened fears of a
terrorist campaign against the West.
   The United States now has about 170,000 troops in Saudi Arabia
and on ships in the area, making up most of the estimated
200,000-member international force. The Pentagon says Iraq has
massed 460,000 troops in Kuwait since the invasion.
   Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said sailors from the Navy
frigate Samuel B. Roberts boarded the Sudanese freighter Blue Nile
on Thursday.
   Williams said the freighter, carrying industrial equipment, was
diverted from the Gulf of Aqaba because the ship's log did not
account for all of its cargo. Under the U.N. embargo, shipments to
the Jordanian port of Aqaba, a prime port for Iraqi cargo, has been
cut severely.
   Williams also said the aircraft carrier USS Independence, which
left the Persian Gulf two days after entering the waterway, had
sucessfully completed its mission ``to demonstrate to our friends
and allies in the region that it is possible to put a carrier in
the gulf and carry out operations. Those were the goals, and they
were accomplished.''
   He declined to say what the Independence would do next.

   The United States is responding to the
unification of Germany by altering its strategy in Europe to a
military presence rather than troops massed near the borders, a top
Pentagon official said Wednesday.
   ``Forward deployed forces will be smaller, with greater emphasis
on mobility and versatility than in the current NATO structure, to
allow maximum flexibility in times of crisis,'' said Army Maj. Gen.
John Seawall.
   The vice director for strategic plans and policy and two other
Defense Department officials described for the Senate Armed
Services Committee details of the unification and its impact on
American and NATO troops.
   As the Soviet Union withdraws its forces from what was East
Germany - with a target for completion of 1994, the military
situation undergoes significant changes.
   In the past, the United States and its NATO allies maintained
forces shoulder-to-shoulder with the best defense closest to the
Warsaw Pact nations. Under the new strategy, the concept is
``defense of the borders as opposed to defense on the border,''
Seawall said.
   Stephen Hadley, assistant secretary of defense for internationl
security policy, said that based on dramatic changes in Europe, the
withdrawal of Soviet troops and the expected treaty to reduce
conventional forces, a new NATO force is warranted.
   The allies will move toward ``a reduced reliance on nuclear
forces; smaller and restructured active forces which are highly
versatile and rely increasingly on multinational corps composed of
national units; and greater reliance on reserves and the ability to
reconstitute larger forces as and when necessary.''
   President Bush has proposed a troop level of 195,000 in Central
Europe. However, the withdrawal of Soviet forces and action by the
Congress could cut deeper into the troop strength.
   The Senate, in its defense bill, approved a reduction in active
duty troops of 100,000, including 50,000 in Europe. The House
adopted a budget calling for a cut of 129,500, including 50,000 in
Europe.
   Negotiators for the two sides are currently working on a final
package.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, said the planned change in strategy represented a
``very, very important statement.''
   ``This is the first reference I have seen to a new thinking of
NATO strategy,'' Nunn said.

   Rwandan forces firing helicopter-borne
rockets and cannons blocked rebels advancing toward the central
African nation's capital in a bid to overthrow the government, a
diplomatic source said Thursday.
   ``Frankly, the tide has turned,'' the diplomat said from
Rwanda's capital, Kigali. ``It's not looking good for the rebels.''
   He said the invading force, estimated at several hundred to more
than 1,000, was sharply reduced during the army's counterattack
Wednesday and Thursday near Gabiro, 40 miles northeast of Kigali.
   There were no reliable reports of casualties. Diplomats in
Kigali said the government was trying to move civilians out of the
combat zone.
   The region is sparsely populated and relatively flat compared
with the steep hills covering much of the impoverished nation.
   Despite the two-day blitz on the rebels' main force around
Gabiro, a group of more than 100 guerrillas reportedly has reached
the shores of Lake Muhazi, 30 miles east of Kigali, using unusual
hit-and-run tactics.
   The rebels have eluded government forces by changing into
civilian clothes aften's conference in New York.
   The well-armed rebels, made up of Rwandan refugees,
predominantly of the Tutsi tribe, invaded Rwanda from its northern
neighbor Uganda on Sunday. Many are deserters from Uganda's army.
   The rebels have lived in Uganda since fleeing bloody ethnic
battles in Rwanda in the late 1950s and early 1960s when the
majority Hutu tribe gained control of the country.
   Uganda has denounced the invaders and closed its border with
Rwanda, cutting off any possibility of retreat or resupply by the
rebels.
   The rebels admit their forces are predominantly Tutsi, but say
that is a function of history and deny they are bent on ethnic
revenge, according to interviews with guerrillas in Uganda's state
newspaper New Vision.
   But in Kigali authorities have arrested about a dozen prominent
Tutsi and Hutu citizens, including army officers, government
officials, business people and intelligentsia. Charges against them
were not immediately announced.
   Eighty-five percent of Rwanda's foreign earnings come from
coffee exports and have fallen by more than half in recent years
because of lower coffee prices on the international market.
   The rebels said they also would like to end the refugee problem
and give citizenship to all Rwandans, including those outside the
nation's borders.
   There are more than 100,000 Rwandan refugees in Africa and the
rebels estimate more than 1 million worldwide. Rwanda says it has
no place to put the refugees.
   The nation is among the most crowded in the world with an
estimated 566 people per square mile. It also has a population
growth rate of nearly 4 percent annually, among the world's
highest.

<HEAD>Storm Klaus Bears Down on Caribbean, Hurricane Warnings Issued</HEAD>

   Tropical Storm Klaus bore down
Thursday on the eastern Caribbean after causing severe flooding on
the French island of Martinique, where six people were reported
dead and two missing.
   The National Hurricane Center in Miami said Klaus, the 11th
named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, had sustained winds
of 60 mph and could grow into a hurricane by Friday.
   Hurricane warnings were issued for the Leeward Islands along an
arc from the French and Dutch island of St. Martin-St. Maarten in
the north to the British colony of Montserrat in the south.
Tropical storm warnings remained in effect for Martinique and its
sister island of Guadeloupe.
   ``The storm has been showing signs of getting stronger, and
we're forecasting the possibility of it becoming a hurricane within
the next 24 hours,'' said forecaster Miles Lawrence at the
hurricane center.
   Klaus was expected to pass near the sparsely populated island of
Barbuda late Thursday or early Friday, the center reported.
   Tropical storms are upgraded to hurricanes when their maximum
sustained winds reach 74 mph.
   The hurricane center said rainfall of 10 to 15 inches was
possible for the islands of the northeastern Caribbean. That could
trigger flash flooding and mudslides.
   Stan Cieniewicz, administrative officer for the Pan-Caribbean
Disaster Preparedness and Prevention Project in Antigua, said
commercial airlines were flying to the region as scheduled.
   He said authorities in Guadeloupe warned residents to move
cattle to protected areas, to avoid long road trips and to keep
away from rivers that could overflow in heavy rains.
   At 6 p.m. EDT, Klaus was centered near latitude 17.0 north and
longitude 61.0 west, or about 55 miles east of Antigua. It was
moving northwest at 6 mph, with tropical storm-force winds
extending 115 miles from its center.
   Earlier, Klaus dumped torrential rain on Martinique, a French
overseas department of 336,000 inhabitants, where six people were
reported drowned in floodwaters that reached nearly 10 feet in
places. Hundreds of people were evacuated from their homes as rain
continued for a second day Thursday.
   Among the dead were two sisters, aged 8 and 14, who were swept
from a bridge Wednesday in St. Joseph, authorities said. Rescuers
found their bodies Thursday.
   Four men were drowned in different parts of the island. They
included a 56-year-old farmer who fell from his tractor into a
flooded ditch.
   Two fishermen - a father and son - were reported missing
Thursday in Riviere Pilote. Officials told Radio Caribbean
International that the local outdoor market and soccer stadium were
under 5{ feet of water.
   Jocelyne Van Elverdinghe, an aide to Prefect Jean-Claude Roure,
the French government's representative on the island, said flooding
forced 750 people from their homes in Lamentin.
   Schools were closed throughout the island. Flooding disrupted
telephone and electrical service.
   In Barbados, southeast of Martinique, floodwaters forced the
evacuation of a few families overnight and temporarily blocked some
roads, although the major tourist hotels on the western coast were
unaffected.
   Lightning knocked out electricity across the island Wednesday
night.
   High wind downed utility poles and trees in Dominica to the
north.
   Islands covered by hurricane warnings included St. Martin-St.
Maarten, St. Barthelemy, Saba, St. Eustatius, Antigua and Barbuda,
Anguilla, the British Virgin Islands, Montserrat and St.
Kitts-Nevis.
   Many of the same islands were battered by Hurricane Hugo, which
devastated the region in September 1989 before hitting the Carolina
coast.
   Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Josephine, with winds near 70 mph, was
reported at 6 p.m. to be drifting north at 8 mph in the
mid-Atlantic about 1,050 miles southwest of the Azores.
   The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 to Nov. 30.

   The chairman of the National Endowment for the
Arts said Thursday that evangelist Pat Robertson should apologize
for lying about whether federal money was used to produce an
Atlanta puppet show he said featured simulated oral sex.
   NEA chairman John E. Frohnmayer said the charge was false.
   At a news conference in Atlanta, where he flew to talk to local
arts leaders about the controversy, Frohnmayer said Robertson has
subjected Americans to ``an irrational, sometimes irresponsible
debate about public support for the arts in this country.''
   Earlier in the day, Robertson charged on his ``700 Club''
television show that if members of Congress vote to give the
federal arts agency more money next year, ``it shows they are
totally out of touch with America and with morality.''
   A report on Robertson's show said Atlanta puppeteer Jon Ludwig
``had use of a large bloc of NEA money'' when he presented the
controversial puppet show Sept. 21 at the Arts Festival of Atlanta.
   Frohnmayer urged Robertson ``to apologize to Congress, to
apologize to the people of Atlanta, and to apologize to those who
look to him for truth.''
   He said he hopes the issue can be put to rest and a healing
process can begin.
   ``I believe the time has come for fairness. I believe the time
has come for honesty,'' said Frohnmayer.
   In Washington, the NEA released a copy of a Sept. 28 letter in
which Frohnmayer told Robertson that the evangelist's claim of
endowment support for the festival to present the puppet show was
``categorically false.''
   In that letter, and in an NEA letter circulated in Congress,
Frohnmayer denied that any federal funds went either to the arts
festival or the puppet show.
   His assertion was supported last week by festival officials and
the executive director of the Georgia Council on the Arts, a state
agency that receives NEA funds. Festival officials said the puppet
show was financed entirely by ticket sales and concession receipts
and did not receive any government money.
   Robertson earlier said the puppet show included simulated
foreplay followed by an exhibit of oral sex acts before an audience
of 800, including children.
   Ludwig said the scene was a satirical treatment of sexual
temptation, as part of an adult morality play, but that it did not
include oral sex.
   The Rev. John Norton of Marietta, Ga., who originally complained
about the pupet show, later backed down.
   The Methodist clergyman said he objected not to the performance
but to allowing unaccompanied children to view adult material.
Festival officials promised they would solve that problem.
   In an indirect reference to Robertson, Norton said: ``We do not
feel it is appropriate for us to be placed in the position of being
connected with the greater issues others have attempted to draw us
into.''
   The Christian Coalition, a non-profit organization headed by
Robertson, said the NEA gave $132,500 last year to the Center for
Puppetry Arts in Atlanta, where Ludwig is artistic director.
   That was confirmed by the NEA, but the agency denied that any of
the money was spent on the puppet show. Vincent Anthony, the
center's director, said the festival signed an independent contract
with Ludwig to produce the show.
   Robertson told his TV viewers that there is ``this incredible
shell game that goes on in Washington with the NEA'' and its grant
money.
   At a time when Congress is considering raising taxes to reduce
federal budget deficits, Robertson said, ``there shouldn't be one
dollar of it spent on oral sex at puppet shows, or Jesus Christ
immersed in urine, or the Mapplethorpe exhibit of homoerotic art.''
   The evangelist, who ran for the 1988 Republican presidential
nomination, was referring to controversial NEA grants for
exhibitions of works by artist Andres Serrano and photographer
Robert Mapplethorpe, which conservatives have denounced as obscene
and blasphemous.
   In his letter to ``a Christian whose religion values truth,''
Frohnmayer told Robertson that Robertson ``clearly made a mistake''
about NEA support for the puppet show and should correct his error.
   Robertson said Thursday he had not actually seen the puppet show
but relied on newspaper accounts.
   In an Oct. 1 reply to Frohnmayer, the evangelist said the puppet
show was ``another example of what can happen when federal money is
given without supervision and oversight.''

<HEAD>Prime Minister of Trinidad Blames U.S. on Arms Purchase Dispute</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VICTORIA GRAHAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The prime minister of Trinidad and Tobago
said Thursday that U.S. authorities failed to tell his government
of arms purchases in Miami by Moslem coup-plotters.
   ``If we had the information possessed by U.S. authorities in
Miami, this coup would have been avoided,'' Prime Minister Arthur
N.R. Robinson told a news conference.
   Later, a U.S. State Department official, requesting anonymity,
said, ``We did not withhold information which would have enabled
Prime Minister Robinson to prevent the coup d'etat.''
   On July 27, Moslem militants stormed Parliament and the
government-run TV station and took the prime minister and more than
50 others hostage.
   The ensuing six-day siege and accompanying looting left 24
people dead and 500 wounded. Trinidad is a Caribbean island nation
of 1.2 million people off northeast Venezuela. The fighting caused
an estimated $60 million damage to the main shopping district in
Port-of-Spain.
   In answer to a question, Robinson said his government has
evidence the rebels had ties to Libya.
   ``In fact, the leader of the terrorist organization has
confessed openly about his visits and relations with Libya.''
   He declined to say, however, whether the coup was backed by
Libya, saying the case was in the courts.
   Rebel leader Yasin Abu Bakr, a former policeman who converted to
Islam, and 113 followers were jailed to face charges of treason and
murder after the coup was suppressed. Saying it fearing that Bakr's
supporters might be plotting another attack, the government
extended a state of emergency until mid-November. The proclamation
gives security forces unrestricted rights of search and arrest.
   Robinson, who was shot in the leg by the rebels, said in a
speech to the United Nations General Assembly that the coup was
launched by ``a new breed of fanatics claiming divine inspiration,
but acting rather under satanic impulse.''
   Robinson walked with a cane as he went to the podium at U.N.
headquarters.
   After his speech, Robinson told reporters that he would raise
the issue of exchanging information about security when he meets
President Bush on Monday in Washington.
   ``We must find out why there was not a proper transfer of
information,'' he said. ``We want to ensure that in the future,
more effective arrangements are made about information exchange.''
   He said it was common knowledge that some of those later
involved in the coup were buying weapons in Miami with large
amounts of U.S. currency and shipping the arms to the island
nation, a former British colony.
   U.S. authorities in Miami knew about the arms purchases, he
said.
   ``Oh, yes,'' he said, ``there was much more information that
U.S. authorities had'' which was not passed along to his
government.
   Federal agents from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
arrested an Moslem, Louis Haneef of Pompano Beach, Fla., on charges
of supplying assault rifles, ammunition and other equipment to the
coup leaders.
   But Jack Killorin, a spokesman for the bureau in Washington,
said its agents were not aware of any contact between the man
buying the guns and Trinidad until after the coup attempt.
   ``Had it been known that the firearms were going to go to
Trinidad, the Trinidad authorities would have been notified,''
Killorin said. ``It simply was not known until Trinidad authorities
captured the arms and we matched them to the arms shipment in
Miami.''
   ``We couldn't agree more with the prime minister that
governments should set up avenues of communication to crack down on
this gun running,'' he added.

   The defense rested its case Thursday at the
obscenity trial involving Robert Mapplethorpe's photos, and closing
arguments in the case were expected Friday.
   Most of the day was taken up with legal arguments over the
qualifications of a rebuttal witness for the prosecution, prompting
an expression of frustration by defendant Dennis Barrie.
   ``I just wish something would happen,'' said Barrie, who could
go to jail if the jury finds him guilty of the misdemeanor charges
of pandering obscenity and using children in nudity-related
material.
   Barrie, 43, is director of the Contemporary Arts Center. A
Hamilton County grand jury indicted Barrie and the art gallery
April 7 because of seven photographs in a 175-picture exhibit that
day.
   Five of the photos depict sexually explicit acts involving men,
and two show children with their genitals exposed. If convicted of
both charges, Barrie could be sentenced to one year in jail and
fined $2,000. The gallery could be fined $10,000.
   Although the jury could get the case as early as Friday,
Hamilton County Municipal Judge David Albanese told the
eight-member panel he felt no pressure to speed things along.
   ``If we have to recess over the three-day weekend, we will,''
Albanese said. The court won't be in session Monday because of
Columbus Day.
   The defense contended the exhibit was legitimate art by a
nationally known photographer and that the display was part of the
art gallery's cultural mission.
   In testimony Wednesday, Barrie said some of the acts depicted in
the show were ``tough, brutal, sometimes disgusting,'' but part of
the photographic challenge Mapplethorpe accepted in trying to
create a work of art.
   ``As difficult as the subject matter may be, you see the ability
of the man working through. He was brilliant with a camera,''
Barrie said.
   Defense lawyers Thursday challenged the credentials of proposed
prosecution rebuttal witness Judith Reisman of Arlington, Va. They
said she was not qualified to offer expert testimony regarding the
seven photographs.
   Ms. Reisman listed among her qualifications having prepared
educational videotapes and slide presentations for the Smithsonian
Institution in Washington. She said she also has been a consultant
for television's ``Captain Kangaroo'' show, former Attorney General
Edwin Meese's commission on pornography and for the conservative
American Family Association.
   Albanese allowed the testimony.
   Ms. Reisman, who practices what she called content analysis of
images, was asked to testify about the five photographs on which
the obscenity charges are based.
   ``Do you see in them any expression of human feeling?''
Assistant City Prosecutor Frank Prouty asked.
   ``No, I do not,'' Ms. Reisman said. ``There is no expression of
joy, anger, fear, shame, happiness, sadness, intent or distress.''
   By displaying sexually explicit photos that lack human emotion,
``one receives the information that that is an appropriate
activity,'' Ms. Reisman said.
   She said that displaying nude photos of children ``is a standard
technique for getting children into a child abuse situation.''
   Art experts testifying for the defense have described the
exhibit as a retrospective of the career of Mapplethorpe, who died
of AIDS in March 1989 at age 42.
   As the trial recessed for the day, Albanese cautioned jurors to
ignore about 40 demonstrators in front of the Hamilton County
Courthouse.
   Most of the protesters were dressed in black, some wearing death
masks as they staged a ``funeral'' for the Bill of Rights.
   It was the first such demonstration at the trial since jury
selection began Sept. 24, when about 150 gay rights and
anti-censorship demonstrators marched outside the courthouse.
   The exhibit drew 80,000 people during its seven week run, an
attendance record for an art exhibit in Cincinnati. The show closes
this week in Boston, where 103,000 tickets have been sold.
   The exhibit was canceled at a Washington museum because of
controversy over the photographs.

   Iraq's U.N. ambassador suffered a serious
enough nose bleed Thursday to force the postponement of the Iraqi
representative's speech to the General Assembly.
   The address was expected to be Iraq's response to President
Bush's hint that Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait could pave the way
for Mideast peace talks.
   Ambassador Abdul Amir al-Anbari was seen bleeding profusely from
his nose in the United Nations headquarters and was taken to the
U.N.'s medical office Thursday afternoon for treatment. Cause of
the nose bleed was not immediately known.
   U.N. officials said al-Anbari would be the last speaker Friday.
The ambassador headed home to rest late Thursday, Iraqi officials
said.
   In his speech Monday, Bush said that after Iraq's unconditional
withdrawal from Kuwait, there might be ``opportunities for Iraq and
Kuwait to settle their differences permanently; for the states of
the gulf themselves to build new arrangements for stability; and
for all the states and peoples of the region to settle the conflict
that divides the Arabs from Israel.''
   Bush, in the speech and in a later news conference, did not
elaborate on what settlements could be possible. The United States
has long been committed to a Mideast settlement in which Israel
would exchange territory for Arab recognition of its right to
exist.
   Bush's remarks echoed French President Francois Mitterrand's
speech to open the 45th General Assembly on Sept. 24.
   ``If Iraq were to withdraw its troops and free hostages,
everything may be possible,'' said Mitterrand.
   In other diplomatic moves in the Middle East, Japanese Prime
Minister Toshiki Kaifu met in Amman, Jordan with Iraq's deputy
prime minister, and later with King Hussein, and Mitterrand
discussed the gulf crisis in Jiddah with Saudi Arabia's King Fahd.

   A fire started by a 7-year-old boy swept
through an overcrowded inner city home Thursday, killing two women
and three children. Nineteen people survived the blaze.
   Police said at first they suspected arson. But ``an
investigation during the course of the day determined the fire was
started by a 7-year-old at the house,'' Capt. Joseph Purpero said.
   The boy apparently was playing with flammable materials when
fire broke out in the three-story dwelling, Purpero said.
   A man held for questioning was released. Police didn't say
whether the 7-year-old would be turned over to juvenile
authorities.
   The victims included a 22-year-old mother and her three
children, ages 9 months, 3 years and 6 years. An 18-year-old woman
also died.
   Fire Chief August Erdmann said a man and three children on the
first floor and 15 people on the upper floors of the home escaped,
some by jumping from windows. Twenty-four people were living in the
house, officials said.
   Rescue workers took five people to Sinai Samaritan Medical
Center, including a 25-year-old woman who fractured her pelvis and
a 32-year-old woman who injured her spine, spokeswoman Susan
Lebergen said. Both women were injured after jumping from the
house, she said.
   The fire broke out about 5 a.m. and spread quickly through the
wood-frame house, trapping the five victims on the first floor,
Erdmann said.
   Deangelo Barron, a friend of a first floor resident, said he
spotted the fire and then saw a man running from the building. Jon
Moore, who lives nearby, said his children overheard one of the
boys who escaped from the house tell police a man set the fire.
   ``I was told he saw the guy who started the fire. He (the man)
woke the little boy up and told him to get his mother out,'' Moore
said.
   Patricia Ann White, a neighbor, said five families were living
in the 80-year-old house. ``That's too crowded,'' she added.
``There were too many people. It's a wonder everybody didn't
burn.''
   Leo Balderas, 40, the owner of the house, said he rented the
building to eight people this summer and was unaware 24 people were
living there. He said smoke detectors were operating in the house.
   ``I've seen extra people staying in houses before,'' he said.
``When I confront the tenants, they say they're visiting or only
staying a couple of days. I don't know how you can watch that.''
   Balderas, who owns 30 houses in the area, blamed the crowding on
a housing shortage.

<HEAD>Soviet Migrants Bolster Israeli Conscription, Military Reserve</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The influx of Soviet Jews into Israel will
significantly add to the Jewish state's military potential, the
International Institute for Strategic Studies said Thursday.
   ``While this (Soviet immigration) will not in the long term
redress the demographic imbalance between Jews and Arabs (both in
Israel and the West Bank and Gaza Strip), it will add significant
numbers to the pool available for conscription and reserve,'' the
institute said.
   The institute noted in its annual survey of global forces, The
Military Balance, that the Soviet Jewish immigration is the ``focus
of much attention'' among Israel's Arab neighbors.
   It said a total of 100,000 Soviet Jews were expected to arrive
in 1990 ``with perhaps as many as 1 million coming over the next 10
years.''
   The report said Israel's defense forces have accepted they
cannot quell the Palestinian uprising in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip, which began in December 1987. It said military service there
continues to erode training standards among Israeli troops and
undermine moral.
   Elsewhere, the institute said in its section on the Middle East
that both Iran and Iraq continued to rebuild their forces following
the end of the eight-year gulf war in 1988.
   The report, written before Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait,
said Iraq's new acquisitions included 12 Soviet-made MiG-29 fighter
planes this year.
   ``(Iraq's) ballistic missile development has been relatively
successful with the 900 km(560 mile)-range Al-Abbas (missile) and
the 600 km(370 mile) Al-Husayn having been deployed and five other
types under development,'' the report said.
   ``Iraq has deployed at least six Al-Husayn launchers to an
airfield close to an area commonly known as H-2 ... in the western
Iraqi desert from where targets throughout Syria and most of Israel
can be engaged.''
   It said the Egyptian Army has received 700 U.S. M-60A1 tanks
from surplus stocks in Europe.
   It said Saudi Arabia took delivery of a squadron of American
UH-60 transport helicopters, 24 Tornado fighter planes and six
British mine hunters.

<TEXT>
   President Elias Hrawi consulted with
other leaders Thursday about asking for Syria's help to launch an
assault on rebel Gen. Michel Aoun's stronghold in east Beirut.
   Police said Aoun's troops and militia under rival Christian
warlord Samir Geagea traded mortar and gunfire during the morning
across their front lines in Beirut's Christian sector. No
casualties were reported. Geagea backs Hrawi's government.
   Hrawi held six hours of talks with senior members of his
Cabinet, the Parliament and top army officers at his west Beirut
residence Thursday, according to sources close to the president.
   The talks focused on a letter Hrawi drafted to Syrian President
Hafez Assad, seeking logistical support to help crush Aoun, said
the sources, who spoke on condition they not be named.
   Parliament speaker Hussein Husseini and the Cabinet have
approved the draft, the sources said, but it will have to be
endorsed by Prime Minister Salim Hoss before it is sent to Assad.
   Assad, who met with Hrawi in Damascus last week, has offered any
assistance necessary to end Aoun's mutiny.
   The Syrian army's deputy chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Ali Aslan,
visited Moslem west Beirut on Tuesday and met with Hrawi's senior
military aides, including Gen. Emile Lahoud, the army commander.
   Aoun, who refused to recognize Hrawi's election as president
Nov. 24, is holding out with 15,000 mainly Christian troops in
parts of east Beirut and the adjoining Metn Mountains.
   Hrawi sacked Aoun as army commander last November. Aoun rebelled
and claims he is the only legitimate authority in Lebanon.
   He has rejected an Arab League-brokered peace plan to end
Lebanon's 15-year-old civil war between Christians and Moslems
because it does not guarantee the withdrawal of Syria's 40,000
troops, in Lebanon since 1976.
   Hrawi, a Maronite Catholic who enjoys the support of most Moslem
factions, has ordered the 20,000 troops under his command to
tighten a blockade on Aoun's enclave Sept. 30.
   Food and other essentials have been cut off to about 150,000
Christians living there.
   Aoun has been in revolt since March 1989, when as army commander
he began a campaign to smash Moslem militias. Dismissed as
commander, he seized control of part of the Christian enclave of
east Beirut and north of the capital.
   Geagea's 6,000-strong militia has gained control of about 80
percent of the 310 square miles in the Christian area.

<TEXT>
   Sen. Daniel P. Moynihan, D-N.Y., said Thursday
he will offer his proposal to cut Social Security tax rates as an
amendment to a stopgap budget bill when it goes before the Senate.
   ``This measure is not a deal-buster,'' Moynihan said in a letter
to his Senate colleagues. `It is transparently just; overwhelmingly
popular; economically sound; and as a matter of public trust, an
elemental duty.''
   Moynihan has attracted much attention this year with his plan to
cut Social Security tax rates, but the idea has never come to a
vote.
   The Senate was slated to consider a combined stopgap budget and
an extension of the debt ceiling Friday. The House passed both
measures Sunday, and if the Senate can't finish work on the bills
by midnight Friday, the federal government will run out of money.
   If Moynihan's gambit succeeds, the House and Senate would have
to appoint a conference committee to come up with a reconcilation
of differences.
   Moynihan's press secretary, Brian Connolly, dismissed concerns
that such an outcome would gum up the works.
   ``They've done it before,'' he said.
   The Social Security payroll tax is currently producing more
revenue for the federal government than the government is paying
out in benefits - an estimated $74 billion more in the fiscal year
that began Oct. 1.
   Last December, Moynihan introduced a bill to cut the Social
Security tax rate for two years, reducing collections this year by
about $60 billion, and to take Social Security off-budget - that
is, not use its surplus to make the overall federal deficit smaller
than it would otherwise appear.
   In July, he modified the plan to spread the cuts over five
years, reducing the rate more gradually in an attempt to appeal to
convert Congress to his cause.
   This latest version would spread the cuts over six years and
provide for a trust fund reserve equal to a year-and-a-half's worth
of benefits by 1995. Under this plan, the Social Security tax rate
would be reduced from the current 6.2 percent to 5.1 percent by
1996.

   A doctor was jailed overnight for contempt
after he refused to give his personal notes to the defense in an
injury trial, but he was released Thursday afternoon.
   Rice County District Judge Herb Rohleder cited Dr. Michael
Patterson after he refused to turn over notes on a man suing a
woman for injuries in an auto accident.
   Attempts to reach Rohleder and Patterson by telephone at their
homes Thursday evening were unsuccessful, and the Rice County jail
would not release any information about why Patterson was released.
   Patterson, director of the rehabilitation section of a
Hutchinson hospital, said he withheld the notes because they would
violate the privacy of his patients.
   The patients he treats have been severely handicapped by strokes
or have suffered traumatic head injuries and have diminished
control of themselves, Patterson said.
   ``If releasing this information is a condition for my release,
something else will have to be decided,'' Patterson said prior to
gaining his freedom. ``I'm not leading any kind of crusade. This is
an individual thing.''
   Patterson treated Curtis Bruce of Lyons after Bruce was injured
in an auto accident in 1988. Bruce is suing the driver of the other
car.

   The overthrow of President Corazon Aquino
could prompt the world to ``turn its back on the Philippines in
disgust,'' the chairman of the Senate's Asian affairs subcommittee
said Thursday.
   And the result could be that in 20 years the country will turn
into ``an economic backwater, similar to Burma today,'' Sen. Alan
Cranston, D-Calif., added in a floor speech.
   Cranston urged senators to support the Bush administration next
week in providing the current $200 million U.S. installment of the
five-year Multilateral Assistance Initiative pledged with Japan and
other countries to speed economic recovery in the Philippines.
   He voiced concern that Wednesday's attacks by military rebels
against government positions in Mindanao island represent the start
of ``the long-threatened next coup attempt'' against the Aquino
government, target of six attempted coups in four years.
   ``Now is the time for the United States to demonstrate anew its
support for Philippine democracy,'' Cranston said. ``At this very
moment when democracy is once again being challenged by
totalitarian elements, we must not be pusillanimous.''

<HEAD>De Klerk Pays Surprise Visit to Natal Townships</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM COHEN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President F.W. de Klerk was
cheered Thursday when he made an unannounced visit to black
townships in Natal Province that have been wracked for years by
factional fighting.
   He praised local leaders of the warring factions for negotiating
a Shongweni township truce that halted the fighting, which has
claimed 5,000 lives in Natal in five years.
   Such a trip would have been unthinkable a year ago, before de
Klerk pushed for an end to apartheid and freed African National
Congress leader Nelson Mandela from prison.
   The white-led government and the ANC have held peace talks since
May on eliminating apartheid.
   The black faction fighting spread to Johannesburg area townships
in August, killing about 800 people. It has eased the past two
weeks, but strained relations between the government and the ANC.
   Most of the fighting has pitted Zulu supporters of the
conservative Inkatha movement against Xhosas and other blacks
linked to the ANC.
   It was the second time in a month de Klerk has ventured into
black townships, an extremely rare act by a South African leader.
He also drew a warm reception on his visit last month to the Soweto
township southwest of Johannesburg.
   Residents of Shongweni and the Imbali township cheered and sang
Thursday when de Klerk appeared, accompanied by his wife and other
government leaders.
   Tight security was evident, with yellow police helicopters
circling the presidential party's helicopter.
   De Klerk presented bibles to Victor Kabisi of Inkatha and Tulani
Zulu of the United Democratic Front, an ANC affiliate, and praised
them for the peace agreement in Shongweni.
   ``I hope other leaders throughout the country will follow your
example,'' de Klerk said.
   The entourage also visited the King Edward Hospital in Durban,
where patients lying on mattresses on the floor cheered de Klerk.
He announced the government had allocated an additional $20 million
for health services in Natal and the KwaZulu tribal homeland.
   He later expressed disappointment that Mandela and Inkatha
leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi were not meeting to discuss the
violence.
   ``The time has arrived for us to put down our instruments of
conflict and to turn our back on conflict and violence, and to
speak our minds in a peaceful manner,'' de Klerk said.
   Mandela and Buthelezi, who also is KwaZulu leader, had been
invited to take part in an ANC-called meeting with homeland leaders
Friday to discuss the violence.
   But Buthelezi rejected the invitation, saying he should meet
with Mandela as the Inkatha leader because the fighting involves
Inkatha and ANC supporters.
   He said Thursday he doubted a meeting with Mandela would happen
in the near future. Mandela is scheduled to leave the country
Sunday for a trip abroad of almost four weeks.
   The ANC has refused to meet with Buthelezi in a one-on-one
format. It charges Inkatha spread the violence from Natal to the
Johannesburg townships to broaden its constituency.
   Inkatha accuses the ANC of trying to monopolize power among
black opposition groups as the country moves toward negotiations on
a new constitution.
   The ANC and Inkatha both oppose apartheid but differ on a future
South Africa. Inkatha wants a free market economy and appeals to
Zulu nationalism, while the ANC is more leftist and pan-tribal.

   French President Francois Mitterrand
spoke with King Fahd of Saudi Arabia on Thursday amid Iraqi
overtures apparently aimed at driving a wedge between Paris and
other nations confronting Iraq in the Persian Gulf.
   Earlier this week, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein praised
Mitterrand's ideas on the Middle East and suggested France as a
possible negotiator in the gulf crisis. He also freed nine French
captives, who arrived Thursday in Paris.
   But French officials have declared Paris remains committed to
the international campaign to force Iraq to leave Kuwait, the
oil-rich emirate it overran and annexed in early August.
   The two leaders met for two hours before Mitterrand left to
inspect France's 4,000-man rapid action force at Yanbu, further
north on the Red Sea coast. He planned to return to Paris Thursday
night.
   There was no immediate statement on the talks.
   But members of his entourage quoted Mitterrand as affirming that
France was ready to respond to any call by Saudi Arabia or other
countries feeling menaced in the region.
   They said the two leaders backed an enforcement of the U.N.
Security Council's trade embargo against Baghdad.

<TEXT>
   Retired Brig. Gen. John Groff, a World War I
hero and the Marine's oldest surviving general, has died of a heart
attack at age 100.
   Groff died Tuesday at Oceanside's Tri-City Hospital, Kathie
Graler, the service's historian at Camp Pendelton Marine Corps
base, said Thursday.
   ``He was the grand old man of the Marine Corps,'' said a family
friend, Lance ``Dutch'' Parker, a retired Marine chief warrant
officer whose late father, David ``Whitey'' Parker, served with
Groff.
   Graler said Groff had been the oldest surviving Marine general
and the last member of the World War I Lodge in Oceanside, about 45
miles north of San Diego.
   Born in Syracuse, N.Y., in 1890, Grof enlisted in the Marines in
1912. He was a gunnery sergeant and patrol leader when his unit
fought in France in the Battle of Belleau Wood, one of the
bloodiest and most storied battles in the Corps' history.
   Groff was wounded in the battle, which stopped a German push
toward Paris. He was awarded the Navy Cross, the Distinguished
Service and the Purple Heart and promoted to second lieutenant.
   ``We didn't realize we were going to get shot like that,'' Groff
said in a newspaper interview earlier this year. ``We lined up and
went into the woods, and then all hell broke loose.''
   Promoted to major in 1938, Groff became commanding officer of
the Marine Corps Recruit Depot in San Diego, a post he held for six
years, helping train Marines who would fight in World War II.
   Groff participated in the 1942 dedication ceremonies opening
Camp Pendleton and in recent years was frequently guest of honor at
Marine Corps ceremonies.
   Groff retired in 1946 and was promoted from colonel to brigadier
general for his distinguished service, Graler said.
   He worked for Hughes Aircraft Co. and Douglas Aircraft Co.
during the late '40s and early '50s. He moved to Oceanside in 1969.
   Groff is survived by daughters Mildred Ann Hanson of Bothell,
Wash.; Pauline Ethel Ralston of Victorville, and son John Louis
Groff of Poway.

   Officials said Thursday they were close to
eliminating a bus driver shortage that caused thousands of pupils
in the nation's third-largest school system to miss some classes.
   ``Early in the year bus delays affected about 4,000 students in
15 to 20 of the more than 350 schools served,'' said Robert L.
Johnson, director of student transportation for Chicago Public
Schools. ``As of (Thursday) morning, the number of children that
are still affected would be less than 150.''
   Some children missed entire school days because their buses
never picked them up. But Johnson said no one apparently missed
school Thursday because of bus problems.
   Johnson said a new, tougher federal commercial drivers'
licensing law caused ``tremendous difficulty'' for bus companies.
``But they knew what our needs were going to be,'' he said.
   ``There's no doubt that when contract renewal comes up, those
companies that have not performed satisfactorily will feel the
effects,'' Johnson said.
   Mark Schmidt of the secretary of state's office said the bus
companies were able to recruit enough potential drivers but more
than usual failed the tests because of the tougher law.
   Drivers were so sparse early this year that more buses than
usual had to make double runs, causing some students to miss their
first hour of school - and important classes often taught in the
morning, like reading. Some children also had to wait longer than
usual for afternoon buses.
   The delays were particularly hard on disabled pupils who must
receive medicine and physical therapy on schedule, said Sue Stoll,
assistant principal at Hanson Park School.

   Prime Minister V.P. Singh said Thursday
he will not rescind a program guaranteeing nearly half of
government jobs to low-caste Hindus despite a wave of riots and
suicides.
   ``When we go for reforms, we should be ready to face
consequences. I am ready to face it,'' Singh said during a debate
in Parliament's lower house, the Lok Sabha.
   Singh was replying to demands for his resignation by the
opposition Congress Party, led by former Prime Minister Rajiv
Gandhi.
   During the 2{-hour debate, Congress Party members accused Singh
of driving the country to the brink of ``disintegration.''
   ``My resignation has been demanded. May I say, you cannot make
me resign from my commitment,'' said Singh, accompanied by the loud
thumping of desks by members of his National Front coalition.
   Singh on Aug. 7 announced the government will reserve 27 percent
of federal jobs for the low-caste workers to offset centuries of
discrimination. That is added to an existing 22.5 percent quota for
the lowest of the Indian social system - the untouchables and the
tribespeople.
   Untouchables are below the four major castes, which determine
social position by birth and often sets economic and educational
paths.
   The decision touched off widespread riots across northern India,
killing at least 53 people and prompting curfews in more than a
dozen areas. At least 26 young people have committed suicide by
burning themselves or eating poison.
   White-collar civil service jobs are coveted by many graduates.
The government employs about 18 million people.
   Many upper-caste students say they will be bypassed for jobs in
favor of unqualifid candidates. At present, there are about 17
million educated but unemployed youths in the nation of 800 million
people.
   In the Lok Sabha, Singh said he was deeply anguished by the
suicides, and hoped the students will accept his offer for talks.
Several student groups have refused to open negotiations until the
job policy is withdrawn.
   India, which is 82 percent Hindu, professes secularism and
outlaws discrimination by caste, but the practice persists.
   Singh has said the government plans to generate 3 million more
jobs and is ready to give loans to youths who want to start
businesses.

<HEAD>Trial of Suspected Palestinian Terrorists Opens in Frankfurt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two suspected members of a Palestinian
terrorist group linked to the Pan Am Flight 103 bombing went on
trial Thursday on charges of attacking two U.S. military trains.
   German officials say they have no evidence linking the two,
Hafez Kassem Dalkamoni and Abdel Fattah Ghadanfar, to the Pan Am
disaster. But searches of their apartment found explosives similar
to that that exploded aboard the plane.
   Both men were arrested in Germany two months before Flight 103
exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland. The Dec. 21, 1988, explosion
killed all 259 people aboard the New York-bound Boeing 747 and 11
people on the ground.
   In Dumfries, Scotland, a Lockerbie constable testifying Thursday
in a public inquiry on the tragedy recalled seeing an orange
fireball drop from the night sky.
   ``The debris ran like a carpet across the countryside, a trail
of devastation and bodies,'' said Constable Michael Stryjewski.
   Dalkamoni, 45, and Ghadanfar, 49, are believed to be members of
the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command,
a radical group that is believed linked to the Pan Am bombing.
   Ghadanfar, a Jordanian, and Dalkamoni, a Palestinian, were
arrested in a Franfkurt apartment in October 1988.
   Investigators found anti-tank grenades, Kalashnikov rifles, hand
grenades and more than two pounds of plastic explosives in their
search of the apartment.
   They also found a portable radiocassette recorder containing
plastic explosives, of the type that apparently blew up Flight 103.
   A policeman was killed attempting to defuse a radio containing
another bomb at the apartment.
   Dalkamoni and Ghadanfar are charged with forming a terrorist
organization and attempted murder for the two bomb attacks aimed at
U.S. military trains in August 1987 and April 1988. A woman was
slightly injured in the first attack.
   The defense attorneys Thursday demanded the replacement of two
suspects' court-appointed Arabic translator, who they claimed was
working for German investigators. A ruling on a new translator was
expected by Oct. 15, when the trial resumes.
   If found guilty, Dalkamoni and Ghadanfar could receive up to
life imprisonment.

<HEAD>`Stand-Up Tragedy,' A Play by Bill Cain, Opens on Broadway</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: No PMs planned.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Drama Critic</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``Stand-Up Tragedy'' is music video theater, a
contemporary kaleidoscope of story, song and dance about the
futility of teaching in an inner-city high school.
   If that sounds depressing, well, it is and it isn't. The play,
which opened Thursday at Broadway's Criterion Center Theater, is
fast, furious, often funny and startlingly different. Call it a
raw, raucous updated ``Blackboard Jungle'' with a rap beat, but
with no easy answers and a pessimistic ending.
   The story comes from author Bill Cain's real-life experiences
teaching in a Catholic school on Manhattan's Lower East Side. Tom
Griffin, played by Jack Coleman, is an idealistic new teacher from
a wealthy WASP family. He's trying to save a little bit of the
world and until now, his only problem has been deciding on whether
or not to go to law school.
   Instead, he finds himself battling to teach young Hispanics,
particularly a withdrawn student named Lee (Marcus Chong) who has a
problem home life. Lee, an accomplished artist, also has an
overactive imagination. The youth has created a fantasy world of
comic-strip superheroes, an exotic environment where he can block
out his junkie of an older brother and his alcoholic mother.
   Tom tries to get through to Lee but the more he tries to help,
the more it hurts Lee. ``Your family's your fate,'' says the
fatalistic student. And playwright Cain pooh-poohs the quick-fix
solution of education lifting these teen-agers out of a life of
poverty and crime. His spokesman is a craggy, nearly disillusioned
cleric, Father Ed Larkin, played with a fine sandpaper edge by
Charles Cioffi.
   Larkin explains that ``an ecology of evil'' permeates the
neighborhood and once you upset the balance, who knows what will
happen. This environment is portrayed at warp speed by director Ron
Link who never lets ``Stand-Up Tragedy'' stop.
   One scene blends quickly into the next, the dialogue and music
often machine-gunning the actors all over the stage. And some of
the performers play more than one role, often at the same time. The
baby-faced Chong does triple duty. In an unnerving series of
transformations, he changes from the bewildered Lee to his defiant
brother to the boy's haughty mother. It's an amazing performance.
   Coleman exudes the right amount of white-bread benevolence as
the do-good teacher, and there are distinctive portraits drawn by
John C. Cooke and Dan Gerrity as his cynical cohorts in the
teaching profession.
   Four other students rap and jive their way through the
production, under the rapid-fire choreography of Charles
Randolph-Wright. They are all over designer Yael Pardess' grim,
graffiti-scarred set with four high school lockers placed at stage
center.
   ``Stand-Up Tragedy'' is unlikely Broadway fare. It's
unconventional and almost aggressive in its determination to turn
the norms of straightforward plot and character upside-down and
inside-out. But stay with it. It's a wild and most satisfying ride.

<HEAD>Electoral Council Signs Observer Agreement With OAS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) - The Electoral Council signed an
agreement Thursday for the Organization of American States to
provide observers for Haiti's elections on Dec. 16.
   About 25 observers will arrive for the three-week registration
period, which starts Friday. The observers will return for the
elections to choose a new president, legislature and mayors.
   The president-elect was to be sworn in Feb. 7, 1991, on the
fifth anniversary of the overthrow of dictator Jean-Claude
Duvalier. Since then, the country has suffered a series of military
coups, violence and economic crisis.
   In 1987, the last attempt at free elections collapsed when thugs
supported by the army shot and hacked to death at least 34 voters.
   The agreement was signed at Electoral Council headquarters by
council president Jean-Robert Sabalat and OAS representative Pierre
Cote.
   More observers will be sent by Caricom and by former President
Carter. A Haitian request for United Nations observers is under
review.
   ``We want to have as many witnesses as possible,'' council
member Emmanuel Ambroise said.
   ``Certain forces which want to hold the country hostage'' are
opposed to the observer, he said.
   In recent months, figures linked to the security apparatus of
Duvalier's government have returned to the country and are alleged
to have carried out several murders.

<NOTE>EDs: INSERTS grafs 6-7: ``Another official,'' with source
confirming that Vreeland indeed dropped</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration is withdrawing the
nomination of Frederick Vreeland to be ambassador to Burma, a
Republican senator who raised questions about the nomination said
Thursday.
   Sen. Alfonse D'Amato of New York said State Department officials
told him that Vreeland's name had been withdrawn because of
objections from Burma about pro-democracy statements Vreeland made.
   But D'Amato said the real reason was evidence linking Vreeland
to efforts to cover up Bulgarian and Soviet involvment in the 1981
assassination attempt against Pope John Paul II.
   ``If you believe the State Department reason, you believe the
moon is made of green cheese,'' D'Amato said.
   State Department spokesman David Denny said he could not confirm
that Vreeland had been dropped as the ambassadorial nominee for
Burma.
   Another official, however, confirmed that Vreeland had been
dropped.
   This official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Burmese
objections to Vreeland's pro-Democracy statements were indeed the
real reason, and the attempt to kill the pope had nothing to do
with the case. The pro-Democracy statements were described as
nothing more than ``oft-stated U.S. policy.''
   Denny said Assistant Secretary Richard Solomon met with Burmese
Deputy Foreign Minister Ohn Gyaw on Wednesday and had expressed
concern about lack of progress toward democracy in the country,
``harrassment of U.S. Embassy employees and continued opium
production.''
   He declined to say what Gyaw replied, and said he could not say
whether there was any discussion of Vreeland.
   D'Amato said one State Department official told him Vreeland had
irked the Burmese with statements concerning the need for a free
and independent government in Burma, where a military junta has
refused to yield power to a civilian government elected in May.
   A Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Vreeland's nomination
Monday was held behind closed doors.
   At the request of D'Amato and Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., the
committee had scheduled a second hearing on the nomination Thursday
but later postponed it until next week.
   D'Amato said he wanted to question Vreeland about reports that
he tried to cover up details about the assassination attempt and
discourage journalists from writing about the Bulgarian connection.
   Congressional sources said some senators were concerned over
published reports about Vreeland's career as a CIA agent.
   An official biography supplied to the committee by the
administration described Vreeland as a career diplomat with several
State Department assignments. Vreeland, 63, is son of the late
Vogue magazine editor, Diana Vreeland.
   D'Amato said that by law he could not discuss whether Vreeland
was a CIA agent, but he said the Senate hearing would have
questioned him about his activites as a U.S. Embassy officer in
Rome at the time the attempted assassination was being
investigated.
   Ali Agca, a Turk who wounded the pope in St. Peter's Square, is
serving a life term in Italy. Agca at first said he acted alone but
later claimed Soviet involvement. An Italian court ruled there was
not enough evidence to convict three Bulgarians charged in the
case.
   D'Amato said he has met with the new president of Bulgaria,
Zhelyu Zhelev, and asked him to pursue an inquiry into both the
Bulgarian connection to the attempt on the Pope and any U.S.
efforts to cover it up.
   Zhelev, on a U.S. visit last week, said he would press for an
independent investigation into charges that Bulgarian police
participated in the papal attack.
   The motive for the coverup, said D'Amato, may have been to
prevent an escalation of U.S.-Soviet differences or to prevent
facts from coming out that might be embarrassing to U.S. officials.

<HEAD>Sandinistas Join Government, Private Business in Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DORALISA PILARTE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sandinista labor unions agreed to
participate in talks Thursday with the government and business
groups seeking a common program to relieve the country of its
economic ills.
   It was a victory for President Violeta Chamorro's 5-month-old
government, which had met stiff Sandinista resistance to its
economic recovery program.
   Former President Daniel Ortega has said the Sandinista Front
would support any agreement the unions reach with the government.
The Sandinista-linked unions have about 200,000 members.
   After meetings with Ortega this week, Antonio Lacayo, Mrs.
Chamorro's senior aide, announced the government would distribute
food, create job banks and freeze planned layoffs of government
workers.
   The Sandinistas in turn agreed not to oppose a government review
of state property the Sandinistas gave away during the two-month
transition period between their Feb. 25 election loss and Mrs.
Chamorro's April 25 inauguration.
   The government also has agreed not to return property previously
owned by the family of the late dictator Anastasio Somoza, ousted
by the Sandinistas in 1979.
   The Sandinistas had refused to take part in a first round of
talks, which began Sept. 20, but decided to submit to the forum
after a series of protest marches failed to muster support.
   The Superior Council of Private Enterprise, Nicaragua's most
important business group, opposed the Sandinista unions'
participation.
   The group blames Nicaragua's economic woes on Sandinista
mismanagement and claimed the government has showed weakness in
dealing with the ousted leftists.
   Lacayo, the most powerful member of the government, has taken
great pains to obtain the cooperation of the Sandinistas. Further
discord can only hurt Nicaragua's chances of getting badly needed
foreign aid, he has said.
   The Sandinistas have opposed to nearly every facet of Mrs.
Chamorro's economic plan. That plan aims at reigning inflation,
which has been running at about 80 percent monthly, reducing a
fiscal deficit and increasing production.
   The government has tried to slash the public payroll, privatize
most of the 400 state enterprises confiscated by the Sandinistas
during their decade in power, end state subsidies of public
services and devalue the currency to make Nicaraguan exports such
as coffee and bananas competitive.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House voted Thursday to do away with
``endless, endless, endless delays'' in carrying out death
sentences, handing the Bush administration a major victory in
debate on a wide-ranging anticrime bill.
   The 285-146 vote came as angry words and sarcastic cries of
`kill, kill, kill'' rang out in protest over repeated victories by
supporters of placing harsher death penalty provisions in the bill.
   ``Would it be possible to bring the guillotine directly to the
House floor?'' Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., said with a mordant smile
after lawmakers added 12 more offenses to a growing list of federal
crimes punishable by death.
   The House also voted 257-172 to allow domestic manufacture of
semi-automatic assault rifles, whose importation has been banned by
President Bush, but only if American-made parts are used. The vote
threw out of the bill a section banning domestic manufacture of
semi-automatic weapons whose importation has been banned by the
president.
   Final passage had been expected Thursday evening, but the House
dropped the debate without a final vote in order to take up the
budget compromise.
   The measure calls for the death penalty for assassination of the
president and numerous other government officials. Treason and
espionage also would be punishable by death.
   Other features range from a shutoff in federal benefits for
convicted drug offenders to a one-year prison term for illegal
possession of steroids.
   In a victory for Bush, the House voted 285-146 to replace major
provisions requiring Death Row inmates to file their habeas corpus
petitions in federal court no later than a year after exhausting
direct appeals.
   Prisoners use these petitions to claim they were denied their
constitutional rights. Some Death Row inmates have filed repeated
petitions and thus delayed their executions for more than a decade.
   Democratic sponsors of the crime bill had incorporated in the
bill a plan that, besides setting a time limit for filing
petitions, would have guaranteed prisoners competent lawyers in
capital punishment cases. It also would have limited the defendants
to one habeas corpus petition in normal circumstances.
   Rep. Henry J. Hyde, R-Ill., a leading critic, said exceptions to
the limit would result in ``endless, endless, endless delays.''
   The House adopted instead a Hyde provision leaving the matter up
to individual state legislatures to limit the time in which their
prisoners could file habeas appeals in federal court. Conservatives
who seek to shorten delays in carrying out executions hailed the
plan while liberals blasted it.
   Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., complained that the plan, drafted by
a commission headed by former Supreme Court Justice Lewis Powell,
actually represented ``a plot ... by the chief justice'' of the
Supreme Court.
   Chief Justice William Rehnquist has been pressing for changes in
the habeas corpus law.
   As it came to the floor, the bill prescribed capital punishment
for 10 groups of offenses approved by the Judiciary Committee.
   The House approved 271-159 an amendment sponsored by Rep. George
Gekas, R-Pa., calling for the death penalty for offenses ranging
from genocide to murder by mail bombing. It included murder through
terrorist bombing of an airplane, train wreck and destruction of a
motor vehicle.
   Gekas told the House that the bill needed stiffening and that
his plan was supported by a wide range of Americans ``from the cop
on the beat to the man on the street.''
   Democratic sponsors of the measure said some of its provisions
appeared unconstitutional. ``I hope we never bring up another crime
bill a month before an election,'' Rep. William Hughes, D-N.J.,
said. ``Because today we are tearing up a document that has served
us well for many years.''
   Sarcastic cries of ``kill, kill, kill'' wafted briefly from a
knot f lawmakers near a door on the Democratic side of the chamber.
   The Senate already has approved a different bill that, unlike
the House version, would curb nine semiautomatic assault weapons.
Differences will have to be resolved by a House-Senate conference
committee.
   As it became clear that the Gekas plan would be approved
overwhelmingly, tempers started to fray. Rep. Craig Washington,
D-Texas, accused Gekas of not answering his question about how the
amendment would work.
   ``Thank you for not answering my question,'' he said.
   ``Thank you for not quoting a good question,'' Gekas said.
   Washington, who had already left the microphone and taken his
seat, shouted: ``You wouldn't know a good question if you heard
it.''
   The substititute provision on semi-automatic weapons was
sponsored by Rep. Jolene Unsoeld, D-Wash.
   Handgun Control Inc., a Washington-based group that campaigns
for firearms restrictions, released a report to the Federal
Election Commission from Unsoeld's campaign committee, reflecting a
$4,950 contribution from the National Rifle Association shortly
after she introduced the amendment.
   The group issued a statement saying Unsoeld ``sold her political
soul to the assault weapon lobby in the hope it will help her get
reelected.''
   ``Absolute baloney,'' Unsoeld said. She said she had not
discussed the amendment with the NRA before introducing it and had
not known about the campaign contribution at the time.
   She said the amendment was needed ``because there are a lot of
us who support the Second Amendment (right to bear arms) who would
feel compelled to vote against the bill otherwise.''

   The last time Josef Felder attended a Parliament
session at the Reichstag, the future looked ominous as he and other
opposition lawmakers battled vainly against growing Nazi powers.
   On Thursday, however, Felder returned to the building full of
hope for the newly united Germany.
   ``I believe we have a good development in the sense of securing
democracy,'' said Felder, 90, the only member of the prewar
Parliament to attend the opening session.
   Felder took a seat next to President Richard von Weizsaecker to
observe the first meeting of Parliament in the Reichstag since Dec.
9, 1932, when Felder was a newly elected deputy in a nation in
chaos as Nazis consolidated power.
   In the coming years, Felder would face Nazi harassment, flee
underground and, ultimately, be sent to a concentration camp.
   Adolf Hitler dissolved the legislature after he was named
chancellor on Jan. 30, 1933, and called new elections. A fire
gutted the Reichstag before the vote was held March 5.
   Felder, a Social Democrat from Bavaria, was re-elected, but
faced increasing threats from the Nazis. The regime had already
jailed many opposition communists and socialists, the first targets
of Hitler's repression.
   More than 100 members of the Reichstag were killed or
imprisoned.
   ``The election campaign in February 1933 was exceptionally
difficult for the opposition. The Social Democrats were forbidden
access to the press by Hitler,'' recalled Felder.
   After the Nazis marched into Bavaria on March 9, 1933, Felder
and other lawmakers changed apartments to avoid arrest, determined
to take their seats in parliament.
   Felder recalled the tumultuous March 23, 1933, session - held in
the nearby Kroll Opera - when Hitler forced through a plan allowing
his government to make laws without the Reichstag's approval. Some
of the Social Democrats were called ``scoundrels'' by crowds.
   Felder attended a Parliament meeting May 17, 1933, when a
resolution calling for equal treatment of Germany at the Geneva
disarmament convention was debated. It was his last session.
   In July, the Nazis banned the Social Democrats and Felder fled
to Austria.
   He continued underground work under an assumed name until 1934,
when the Nazi threat forced him to flee for Czechoslovakia.
   But fearing reprisals against his family, Felder returned to
Bavaria and was thrown into the Dachau concentration camp outside
Munich for two years.
   He worked as an accountant following the war and gradually
returned to politics. In 1957, he was elected to the West German
legislature in Bonn. The Bundestag, the West German parliament, is
also the name of the new German legislature.
   After his third term expired in 1969, Felder devoted himself to
political education, traveling thousands of miles each year to talk
to school children about his experiences.
   Parliament President Rita Suessmuth on Thursday warmly welcomed
Felder, who said it was a ``great satisifcation'' to attend the
historic meeting.
   Felder warned the new government must not permit the rise of
obsessive nationalism, which ``would endanger everything we
achieved through negotiations with our allies.''

   David H. Souter said Thursday that
soon-to-be colleagues on the Supreme Court are eager for him to be
sworn in to avoid the possibility of tie votes in controversial
cases.
   Souter, who will take his oath Tuesday as history's 105th
Supreme Court justice, said he needs to find a home and would love
to play tourist - perhaps ``with a paper bag over my head'' to hide
his newly famous face.
   But he said of the other justices, who have already heard three
days of case arguments, ``They very much wanted me to start sitting
on Tuesday because there is always the possibility of a 4-4
decision if they're sitting without the full complement.''
   ``The difficulty with that is if the case has to be re-argued,
everybody knows that the whole re-argument is going to be addressed
to the one judge who is sort of there to make the difference.''
Souter said in an interview with The Associated Press. ``They were
very solicitous about (not) getting me in that position if we could
avoid it.''
   The court is expected to be closely divided in the first major
case Souter will participate in, a sex-bias dispute over an
employer's fetal protection policy barring all women of
child-bearing age from some hazardous jobs. The case will be argued
Wednesday.
   Souter said he knows he has a big task ahead. ``So many of the
justices have said or written that nothing prepares a person for
the responsibilities of that court, and I know that's going to be
true in my case. I can feel it already.''
   The 51-year-old judge said finding a home in the nation's
capital ``is one of the first orders of business.'' He said Sen.
Warren Rudman, R-N.H., would be showing him some prospects over the
weekend.
   Souter indicated he intends to live in the District of Columbia,
not its Maryland or Virginia suburbs. Told that all the current
justices are suburbanites, he said, ``I'm going to break new ground
for a year anyway.''
   When not house hunting, Souter's weekend will be spent reading
legal briefs in preparation for his first week on the high court.
   He said he would have to put off a secret ambition: Playing
tourist.
   ``There are some things I have never done that most school kids
have done. I have never, for example, toured the Capitol,'' he
said. ``Some day - I may have to do it with a paper bag over my
head - I'm going to do some of those touristy things.''
   Souter said he once was more familiar with his future home.
``Right after law school, I had various friends down there and
there was a woman down there I was interested in, so I made some
trips to Washington,'' he said.
   Acknowledging a recent Washington Post article that named him
one of the city's most eligible bachelors, Souter smiled and said,
``I've really got to wait and see what effects it brings. It
sounded pretty good to me.''
   Asked about his emotions during his three days of testimony
before the Senate Judiciary Committee last month, Souter said,
``There wasn't time to be that reflective. I guess I could tell you
this much, as we got toward the end of the third day, sure, I was
getting tired. I'm glad that the most vigorous questioning of the
three days did not come at the tail end.''
   Souter said neighbors and lawyer friends from Concord would be
on hand for his swearing-in, but that his mother, who will be 83
this week, would not make the trip. ``She gets along fine but she
said she does it by not pushing herself too far,'' he said.

   Salvadoran guerrillas Thursday
denounced President Alfredo Cristiani's recent cease-fire offer as
a tactic taken only to win more military aid for his government.
   In a speech Monday to the 45th General Assembly of the United
Nations, Cristiani proposed a government cease-fire if the FMLN
would do the same.
   ``It is an old offer that seeks to end the war without ending
the causes that originated it,'' the rebels said in the broadcast
on Radio Venceremos, their clandestine voice.
   The offer ``isn't really directed at us, who have a promise with
the government and the United Nations to negotiate ahead of time
the conditions for a cease-fire,'' the rebels said. ``It is aimed
at the American Senate, who Cristiani is trying to impress ... to
get more military aid for the war.''
   Cristiani returned this week to El Salvador after meeting in New
York with President Bush, who is seeking $85 million in new
military aid to El Salvador. The aid package faces an especially
tough battle in Congress, where there is indignation over
continuing human rights abuses.
   Six Jesuit priests who taught at the University of Central
America were murdered in November. Little progress has been made in
bringing evidence against officers believed to have ordered the
killings.
   Cristiani told a news conference Thursday that he met with U.N.
Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar during his trip and
wanted to step up the pace of talks with the rebels of the
Farabundo Marti National LIberation Front.
   ``I consider it necessary to implement some formulas whic will
make the process more dynamic,... which will move more quickly than
what has happened until now,'' Cristiani said.
   Government and guerrilla representatives met under U.N.
sponsorship five times this year, but failed to reach agreement on
terms for ending the decade-old civil war which has claimed at
least 73,000 lives, mostly civilians.
   Cristiani expressed regret at the guerrilla rejection of his
proposed cease-fire, saying he had offered it ``thinking that the
Salvadoran people should not have to continue suffering violence.''

   A judge ruled Thursday that the Roman Catholic
Church may evict a theater company from a former parochial school
where it staged a play about a cardinal who kills a pregnant woman
while driving drunk.
   The church had sought the ruling against the RAPP Theater Co.,
charging that the group violated the lease by performing material
``detrimental to the landlord's reputation as a Roman Catholic
Church.''
   An attorney for the church, Frank C. McLaughlin, argued before
state Supreme Court Justice Irma Vidal Santaella that the lease on
the building states clearly that the church is the ``sole and
absolute judge'' of what is detrimental to its reputation.
   Thomas Disch, who wrote the play, ``The Cardinal Detoxes,'' and
RAPP's artistic director, R. Jeffrey Cohen, both accused church
officials of trying to censor the play because they find it
offensive.
   RAPP attorney Richard Sbeglia argued that it was
``unconscionable'' and a violation of public policy to force a
tenant to give up free speech rights to get a lease.
   But Santaella found that the lease was not unconscionable
because there was not a lack of meaningful choices by either of the
parties. She also said Cohen had voluntarily relinquished his
constitutional rights. ``He read the lease and signed of his own
free will.''
   ``I'm astonished,'' said Disch after the ruling.
   Santaella's ruling lifted a temporary restraining order and
allowed the church to begin eviction proceedings immediately.
   However, Cohen and Sbeglia said they would seek another
restraining order from the State Supreme Court's Appellate
Division. If they fail to get it, Cohen said he has rented a
storefront across the street from the former school and will stage
the play there.
   The play is a 35-minute monologue by a cardinal who is being
treated for alcoholism by the church after he kills the woman.
   After the cardinal calls the church a sham and suggests he will
expose its problems, a silent monk in the room with him gives him
poisoned wine.

   Hundreds of rioters in a crime-ridden
neighborhood torched stores and threw rocks at police Friday in a
protest that began over reports a policeman took a bribe from a
gangster.
   At least 88 people, including 58 police, have been injured since
the violence in the Nishinari district began Tuesday, police said.
Forty people had been arrested by early Friday, authorities said.
   The scope of the violence is extremely rare for Japan, where
public issues rarely inflame passions to such a degree.
   The rioting started after news reports a police sergeant had
taken $20,000 in payment for leaks of police information. The
officer has not admitted guilt, but the Osaka police chief
apologized Thursday in an attempt to ease the tension.
   Early Friday, a convenience store was set ablaze and ransacked
and a grocery store also was looted as the violence spread to the
northern areas of the Nishihari area.
   Up to 1,000 demonstrators confronted about 600 riot police
Thursday night on streets near the station. High school-age youths
lunged out of the crowd to throw rocks and firecrackers at police.
   ``Come out dirty policemen! We will not stand this any longer!''
Kyodo quoted one of the workers as shouting as he hurled rocks at
the police headquarters in this city in western Japan.
   Some charged police shields with their shoulders and were driven
back.
   ``Most of the people who are throwing rocks at us are ...
juvenile delinquents who saw this on television and thought it was
a rare chance to take advantage of the police,'' said one officer,
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Police earlier had said the demonstrators were mostly menial and
day laborers who live in the shabby hotels of the seedy district.
   There have been bad feelings between area residents and police,
whose anti-crime tactics include a 24-hour surveillance camera
system on street corners in Nishinari. Residents also complain of
widespread gang activity.
   Since Tuesday, as many as 1,400 residents of the district have
faced off with police about a quarter-mile from the district police
station, burning cars and throwing rocks, bicycles and beer
bottles, police said.
   Such street violence is seldom seen in Japan. In recent years,
there have been few disturbances other than occasional battles
between riot police and leftist extremists who oppose expansion of
Narita Airport outside of Tokyo.
   Osaka police chief Masahiro Tsubakihara issued an apology at the
prefectural legislature Thursday in response to reports the officer
had taken the bribe, Kyodo News Service reported.

<HEAD>Technicality Shouldn't Keep Measures Off Ballot, Oregon High Court
Rules</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SALEM, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A technical foulup by state officials
shouldn't block Oregon's initiative petition process, the Oregon
Supreme Court said Thursday in explaining its decision to return
five measures to the Nov. 6 ballot.
   The court had no desire to ``entirely thwart ... the right of
citizens to propose laws and amendments to the constitution and
enact or reject them independently'' of the Legislature, Chief
Justice Edwin Peterson wrote in the opinion written Sept. 28 and
released Thursday.
   The unanimous ruling overturned a lower court decision that
removed five of 11 measures from the ballot.
   The problems began when a state committee missed a deadline for
certifying statements for the ballot that explained what the
measures would cost. Marion County judges invalidated those
statements because of the missed deadline.
   Marion County Circuit Judge Richard Barber later invalidated
five measures because they wouldn't be accompanied by the cost
estimates.
   The measures targeted by Barber's ruling would limit property
taxes, shut down the Trojan nuclear plant, ban some non-recyclable
packaging, allow tax credits for private schooling and set up a
pilot work program for welfare applicants.
   The nine-member Supreme Court reversed Barber but upheld the
lower court decisions to keep the estimates off the ballot.
   Despite the failure to meet the deadlines on fiscal impact
statements, a statewide vote on the measures ``goes on without the
estimates,'' Peterson's opinion said.
   The ballot measure dispute has become an issue in the governor's
race.
   Attorney General Dave Frohnmayer, the Republican candidate, said
Secretary of State Barbara Roberts must accept blame because as the
state's top election officer she should have kept closer tabs on
the deadlines.
   Roberts, a Democrat, in turn has accused Frohnmayer of playing
politics with the issue. She said Frohnmayer also has missed
deadlines as attorney general.

   A proposal to give $11.1 billion in newttax
breaks to small corporations is being criticized as opening the
door for wealthy investors to duck their share of federal taxes.
   The Bush administration is pushing the new incentives as a
substitute for the capital gains tax cut that congressional leaders
refused to accept. Some of those leaders are suspicious of the
substitute, which actually includes a small capital gains
reduction.
   The proposal is attached to the $500 billion, five-year
deficit-reduction agreement that President Bush and congressional
leaders reached this week.
   The tax break proposal ``has very serious flaws,'' Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen, D-Texas, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said
Wednesday. ``I think it will lead to a substantial increase in tax
shelters and great abuse.''

   NEW YORK (AP) - The United States and the Soviet Union are in
substantial agreement to reduce non-nuclear weapons in Europe and
now will try to conclude a second pact slashing their nuclear
arsenals.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze announced the resolution of all
remaining major issues Wednesday for the most comprehensive arms
reduction accord since World War II.
   The U.S.-led North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the
Soviet-led Warsaw Pact would limit their tanks, anti-aircraft
artillery, land-based airplanes, armored combat vehicles and
helicopters across Europe - from the Atlantic Ocean to the Ural
Mountains that separate Soviet European from Asian regions.
   Baker and Shevardnadze both cautioned that final approval must
await consultation with their allies. But if the allies go along,
the treaty should be ready for signing at a 34-nation summit in
Paris on Nov. 19-21.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - The sale of $7.3 billion in new weaponry to
Saudi Arabia is just one step in creating a Persian Gulf
``coalition defense'' against the long-term threat posed by Iraq,
say two senior Bush administration officials.
   That sale will be followed by more sales next year to the
Saudis, perhaps to their neighbors Bahrain and the United Arab
Emirates, and new military help for Israel, Undersecretary of
Defense Paul Wolfowitz and Undersecretary of State Reginald
Bartholomew told Congress on Wednesday.
   In doing so, the United States hopes ``to build a Saudi and a
gulf force capability that will, in effect, drive up significantly
the costs to anybody looking to take a whack at them,'' Bartholomew
said.
   ``We do not want to leave the road to Bahrain open, as it was on
the second of August,'' the day Iraq invaded Kuwait, he told a
hearing of two House Foreign Affairs subcommittees.

   FORT LAUDERDAE, Fla. (AP) - A black record store owner
convicted of obscenity for selling a sexually explicit album by the
black rap group 2 Live Crew says the all-white jury ``doesn't
represent my community.''
   ``It's unfair. The jury was all white. They don't know where E-C
Records is. They don't know a goddamned thing about the ghetto,''
Charles Freeman yelled to reporters after he was convicted
Wednesday.
   Critics of the rap group hailed the verdict as a milestone in
the battle against material they consider obscene. The music
industry and civil libertarians decried it as censorship.
   2 Live Crew and its album ``As Nasty as They Wanna Be'' have
been at the center of a First Amendment dispute since June 6, when
a federal judge deemed obscene lyrics that include references to
sodomy and sexual intercourse. Some also have objected to the
lyrics as violent and degrading to women.

   WATERVLIET, Mich. (AP) - When Dave Backus graduated from
Watervliet High School in 1978, there was never any question what
he'd do next.
   Like many of his classmates, he went to work in the town's
80-year-old paper mill, following his father and grandfather, as
well as his mother and aunt and uncles.
   Now the future is anything but clear. Watervliet Paper Co., the
biggest employer in this southwestern Michigan town of 1,867, has
been idle since June, when its parent company filed for bankruptcy
protection.
   The mill's employees are among hundreds of thousands of factory
workers left jobless in recent months as the nation's unemployment
rate worsens. Michigan has the worst unemployment among top
industrial states.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Elizabeth Dole's status as the top woman in
the Bush administration - and her flair for charming Republican
troops - are making the secretary of labor a big draw on the
national campaign scene.
   ``She gets down off of the pedestal and she becomes one of the
many,'' said Hillard Selck, a Republican National Committeeman from
Missouri.
   ``There's no `Stay away from me, stay behind the barrier, I'm
too good for you.' That impresses people. They like to be able to
touch,'' Selck said.
   Mrs. Dole, 54, is campaigning in more than a dozen states this
fall for more than 60 gubernatorial and House and Senate
candidates.

<HEAD>Barry Levinson Mines his Baltimore Boyhood for Films</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB THOMAS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   You can take the boy out of Baltimore, but
Barry Levinson keeps returning to his home town for distinctive
movies.
   Between such commercial ventures as ``Rain Man,'' for which he
won an Academy Award, ``Good Morning, Vietnam,'' ``The Natural''
and ``Young Sherlock Holmes,'' he has weaved the story of his life
growing up in Baltimore.
   His debut as a director came in 1982 with ``Diner,'' about
neighborhood pals who reunion at their old gathering place. Then
came ``The Tin Men,'' with Richard Dreyfuss and Danny DeVito as
aluminum siding salesmen at war with each other.
   Now, ``Avalon.'' The title is the name of the Baltimore rooming
house where members of Levinson's family, the Krinchinskys, first
settle on their arrival to the United States early in the century.
The movie spans 50 years, tracing the changes in the family and the
nation.
   Levinson is portrayed in ``Avalon,'' first as a boy, then as a
young man visiting his dying grandfather (played by Armin
Mueller-Stahl, the East German actor). The director recently talked
about on why he keeps returning to Baltimore for films in an
interview with The Associated Press.
   Q. Just how autobiographical is ``Avalon''?
   A. More than I thought. I wasn't necessarily trying to make it
absolutely true to life. But when I finished it and took a look, I
realized it was even more (autobiographical) than I thought. Most
of the incidents that take place did happen. ... I was surprised.
   Q. What was the origin of the film?
   A. One day I realized, perhaps because I have kids, how
different it is for them nowadays. I grew up with grandparents
around me, and my parents, and my uncles, and my aunts and friends
of the grandparents. They were all around, and you were i touch
with that as a kid: people talking different languages, telling
different stories. You had this big extended family.
   That's almost ended, and I think it's a loss. That's what I
started to write into, and more and more of the things from my life
kind of got into the piece.
   Q. You have a large, ensemble cast. Does that present certain
problems?
   A. Unfortunately, the jeopardy that you run into when you're
making non-action, non-crazy comedy things is that you're putting
an enormous demand on the actors to accomplish the work, because if
we miss in a scene in a relationship, the movie is like derailed.
Action movies can sustain scenes that don't really work. Because
you say, ``Wait till we get to the big action scene.''
   Q. Is there a quality that runs through the Levinson films? A
certain gentleness, perhaps?
   A. I think what I try to do is not hype the characters. I try
not to push them beyond what they may in fact do. I'm looking for
what you might call the smaller dramatic moments, rather than the
bigger ones. I'm trying to find those little moments that we laugh
at and recognize. ...
   ``Avalon'' is not a gritty, gritty movie, because this was not a
gritty environment. It was the end of the '40s, before things began
to radically change.
   Q. How did you break away from Baltimore?
   A. I left to go off to college - American University (in
Washington, D.C.).
   Q. That's not far from Baltimore.
   A. No, 40 miles. ... I ended up coming to L.A. I didn't know
what I was going to do out here; I just came out. ... Then I got
involved in a theater group here.
   Q. What did you study in college?
   A. I took broadcast journalism. I worked in local (Baltimore)
television and did OK in it. But I got fed up with it and didn't
know what else to do. There was not really any place to go unless
you were interested in sales. After you'd directed a news show,
you'd done it. So I came out here with absolutely no idea of what
to do.
   Q. When you started writing for comedy shows (Carol Burnett, Tim
Conway) and films (``Silent Movie,'' ``High Anxiety''), did you
think about directing?
   A. Not at all. But working with Mel Brooks was like an
apprenticeship. We were writing when we were on the set. Since he
was in the movie, he'd say, ``What d'ya think?'' You're watching
it, you saw it being edited and scored. Things start coming into
your head.
   When I got to ``Diner,'' then I knew it was something I wanted
to direct.
   Q. What's so great about Baltimore?
   A. I think it's a great-looking city in terms of a period kind
of look. Different, you know. Row houses. Suburbia. Old wood-frame
homes and trees. It's always made sense to do those movies there.
   Q. During one scene in ``Avalon,'' a diner is being set in place
by a crane. Is that your own kind of grace note?
   A. Yeah, I like the idea that it began with ``Diner'' and
whatever link these movies might have. I like the idea that this
kid might be going to that diner in the future.

<HEAD>Scientist Wages Lonely Struggle for Pandas

   Smiling, cavorting cartoon pandas look out on
every street, but real ones are fading quietly toward extinction.
   Poachers defy the death penalty to capture their pelts. Farmers
and foresters encroach on the shy animal's feeding grounds, even
inside reserves.
   Scientists, either from lack of funds or flagging interest, have
stopped studying pandas in the wild.
   All except one.
   Pan Wenshi, a biologist at Beijing University, spends half of
each year huddled on the cool, damp slopes favored by pandas,
tracking their movements in hopes of devising better preservation
strategies.
   He has studied the rare animals for a decade, and said he nissed
his daughter's childhood in the process.
   ``I want to know why pandas are becoming extinct, and . . . to
help them,'' Pan, 52, said in an interview. ``Only after study can
we come up with a method for saving pandas. Otherwise, any
proposals will be blind and unscientific.''
   For a national symbol whose name and image adorn hundreds of
Chinese products, surprisingly little is known about the panda.
   Organizers of the Asian Games held in Beijing last month chose
the panda as mascot and plastered images of it all over the city,
but depicted the animal with four digits on each paw. Real ones
have six, Pan pointed out.
   Ignorance can have more serious consequences. Hopes of using
pandas born in zoos to replenish the wild population, now estimated
at 1,100 to 1,500, have foundered because of the panda's poor
breeding record in zoos.
   Pan said many zoos give pandas too much food and too little
exercise, which makes them too fat and weak to mate.
   Only 37 pandas have been born in captivity in five decades, and
14 of them died within six months, he said.
   Even the $1 million breeding center at Wolong in Sichuan
province, built help from the World Wildlife Fund and great
fanfare, has succeeded in producing only one panda, in 1986.
Scientists have virtually deserted the facility.
   ``People don't know what conditions a mother needs to raise
cubs,'' Pan said. ``Does the mother need quiet? What diet does she
need? What kind of cave?''
   Such questions have sent him to the remote Qinling Mountains of
Shaanxi province, more than620 miles southwest of Beijing, where
an estimated 220 pandas roam.
   He snares the animals, fits them with radio-transmitting
collars, then releases them and tracks their movements. Sometimes,
college students and teachers join him as short-term volunteers,
but graduate student Lu Zhi is his nnly steady assistant.
   It's easy to see why.
   ``Look at this,'' Pan said, holding up the 25-year-old woman's
hand to show knuckles permanently swollen from cold.
   ``You lose a lot, but the rewards are great,'' she said.
   Among them was the sound of a suckling panda mother and cub. The
mother wore a radio collar.
   Pan and Lu have videotaped hours of mother-cub scenes. They
learned that mother pandas leave their cubs for up to two days to
hunt for food, which means cubs found alone in the wild may not be
abandoned after all.
   They learned that fewer than half the Qinling Mountain pandas
are fertile and their isolation has led to much inbreeding. Some
scientists have proposed introducing one or two pandas from another
part of the country to enlarge the gene pool, but Pan said the
Qinling pandas might not accept a newcomer.
   One of Pan's major concerns is how much human presence pandas
can tolerate. Tradition and bureaucracy have prevented the removal
of thousands of peasants from designated panda reserves, despite
the pleas of scientists.
   ``China has so many people, moving them won't work,'' Pan said.
``We need to find out ways that people and pandas can exist in a
common area.''
   He has found up to 60 percent of the forest cover in panda
habitats can be cut down without ill effect. He said farming is
possible if limited to the lower slopes of mountains and if
forested corridors between mountains are preserved.
   Firm policing and clear directives from the central government
are necessary, and Pan said he would ask for such directives in a
2,000-page report he was submitting to the Forestry Ministry.
   Too much logging already has been done in some forest areas of
the Qinling Mountains, he said, and others are threatened.
   Pan said prompt action was needed to save the habitat, which he
described as more promising for long-term panda survival than
Sichuan province to the south. More pandas live in Sichuan, but
also many more people.
   ``I think there is hope,'' Pan said. ``The problems are great,
but we have to continue making efforts. If we don't, it is over.''

   The Swedish army wishes the Gripen
combat plane were as imaginary as the mythological bird-beast whose
name it bears.
   Army officers, competing with the air force for dwindling
military funds in a neutral nation, call the single-seat Gripen the
greatest threat to defense since Sweden's last war, with Napoleon,
ended in 1814.
   The griffin, which had the head and wings of an eagle on a
lion's body, symbolized strength and vigilance. The supersonic
Gripen, way behind schedule, is more than $1 billion over budget
and the first prototype crashed.
   Sweden, a neighbor of the Soviet Union with only 8.4 million
citizens, says it needs a strong defense to reinforce its
neutrality. It has a conscript army of 750,000 and produces most of
its own weapons, including missiles, tanks, submarines, artillery
and explosives.
   Inflation has reduced the value of military budgets for two
decades, and some experts fear the Gripen's rising costs will force
Sweden to compromise security for lack of money.
   Gen. Bengt Gustafsson, supreme military commander, told
Parliament last month the military budget of $4.6 billion must be
increased or Sweden will have to revise its defense plans, close
bases, reduce military service and dismantle the defense industry.
   He also says, however, that the computerized jet is essential.
   It can be programmed for aerial interception, ground attack or
reconnaissance. In Sweden, which has long borders and is surrounded
by water, the air force would hold off an enemy until the army
could mobilize.
   The Gripen is a about 45 feet long with a takeoff weight of
eight tons - half the size of the Viggen warplane Sweden has used
for 15 years - and is much more maneuverable.
   Army commander Ake Sagren, anticipating a budget battle,
launched a public attack on the Gripen in August. The army ``risks
being phased out,'' the general wrote in the newspaper Svenska
Dagbladet, and ``Sweden will have an excellent air force well into
the next century'' without the new plane.
   At a tank training center in Kristianstad, the southern regional
capital, Col. Roland Appelqvist's face turned grim when the Gripen
was mentioned and said his base was targeted for closure.
   If the aircraft project had stayed within its budget, ``there
would have been money'' for the base, he said.
   Sweden budgeted the Gripen, its largest industrial project, at
$8.66 billion when work began in 1982, but cost overruns total
$1.16 billion so far and it is 18 months behind schedule. The
second prototype has made several test flights, but the first
crashed after six flights.
   The air force has ordered 30 planes and is expected to increase
that to 140 by the end of the year. Money for the aircraft has been
allocated in the long-term defense plan, but the cost probably will
rise to at least $80 million each from the original $65 million.
   No outsiders are participating in the Gripen project. Israel was
building a similar plane, the Lavi, a few years ago, but gave up
after the United States withdrew its backing because of mounting
costs.
   Some of Sweden's largest companies are involved with the Gripen,
including Saab, the Ericsson telecommunications group and Volvo
Aircraft Engines.
   Saab officials say the civilian aircraft industry they have
nurtured for a decade would die without the experience and spinoffs
provided by the warplane Gripen project.
   Parliament must decide by next year how to allocate defense
money through 1996. Gustafsson, the supreme commander, says
increasing costs have had the effect over 20 years of nearly
halving the number of operational defense units.
   He said the military needs a grant of $410 million and annual 3
percent budget increases through the 1990s to finance the Gripen
and current defense policies.
   It is unlikely Parliament will grant his request at a time when
the Soviet Union, perceived as the main threat to Sweden, is
reducing military spending.

<HEAD>The Real News in ``Murphy Brown''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH HASTINGS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's hard enough to separate reality from
make-believe on television. On CBS' ``Murphy Brown,'' the line
between fact and fiction is forever blurred.
   Real-life news broadcasters walk into the fictional ``FYI''
newsroom as themselves. Last season saw TV journalists Connie
Chung, Kathleen Sullivan and Linda Ellerbee in guest roles on the
comedy series about a make-believe television news magazine based
in the nation's capital.
   Besides cameos by news personalities, the highly rated program
also consistently draws its scripts from headline stories.
   This season is no different.
   The Sept. 18 premiere of ``Murphy Brown's'' third season saw the
cast and set of ``FYI'' undergo a total overhaul - complete with
toupees, short skirts and a Santa Fe nightmare of new furniture -
all in the name of chatty, user-friendly news and bigger ratings.
   The next episode concerned the ever-intense liberal and feminist
lead character Murphy Brown, played by Candice Bergen, doing an
interview with a racist, sexist comedian whom she despised (guess
who the comedian was modeled after).
   The show's writers also are working on a script tackling the
issue of what happens when news personalities say regrettable
things, a la Andy Rooney's now infamous remarks about gays and
blacks.
   ``People like to see issues from news and things that affect
them personally,'' said Diane English, the program's creator,
co-executive producer and frequent writer. ``The topicality of our
shows is one of the favorite things about `Murphy Brown.' ''
   Last month, the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences awarded
the critically acclaimed show an Emmy for best comedy series.
Bergen also won her second outstanding lead comedy actress trophy
for her acid-tongued portrayal of a star TV journalist.
   Despite such heady honors, English said the show will remain
largely the same. Some subtle, unexpected plot twists are being
planned, but she wouldn't divulge them.
   ``We like to have surprises for our viewers,'' English said.
   And while ``Murphy Brown'' uses news for entertainment,
real-life journalism has decided to use ``Murphy Brown'' for news.
   ``PrimeTime Live'' co-anchor Diane Sawyer just finished a week
on the set, taping a segment on the making of ``Murphy Brown.'' If
Sawyer's schedule would have permitted, English said, the former
``60 Minutes'' correspondent might have made an appearance on the
comedy series while doing a news story about it.
   In fact, English said, her show has extended several invitations
to Sawyer and ``all the `60 Minutes' guys'' including CBS evening
news anchor Dan Rather (a former ``60 Minutes'' guy) and Mike
Wallace.
   Rather is ``really not sure whether this is a good thing for him
to do,'' English said. ``He has a great sense of humor and it would
be great if people could see that.'''
   Cable talk show host Larry King's involvement is being sought
for an upcoming episode in which Brown is taken hostage by
environmentally conscious ``eco-terrorists,'' English said. ``She's
trying to convince people that she's really been kidnapped and no
one believes her because she's such a practical joker,'' English
said.
   In captivity, Brown sees King on television and tries to call in
on the talk show's viewer line.
   English said she and husband Joel Shukovsky, the show's other
executive producer, also are considering an episode about
management survival trips, at the suggestion of Sawyer.
   According to English, Sawyer said ABC had sent her and
``PrimeTime Live'' co-anchor Sam Donaldson into the wilderness to
rough it for a few days - a kind of management retreat that bigger
corporations are increasingly employing.
   English should just film Sawyer and the notoriously pugnacious
Donaldson hanging out with Mother Nature - now that would be
entertainment.
   Although ``Murphy Brown'' is lauded by critics and has climbed
steadily - if sporadically - in the ratings, English and Shukovsky
were very close to leaving the show this year because of protracted
contract battles with Warner Bros. Television.
   ``The negotiations were very long and very tedious and very
dismal at times,'' English said. ``We had even approved a press
release that CBS was going to put out in April saying we would not
be coming back to the show.''
   At the last minute, the studio agreed to give the pair more
money, a higher ownership percentage in the program and the right
to make other shows for other networks.
   In return, English and Shukovsky signed on for 100 more
episodes.
   ``We made this show,'' English said. ``Without us, there was no
`Murphy Brown. And we saw the network coming out way ahead of us.
I'm doing everything but catering the meals.''
   When it comes to monetary issues in the television business, the
line between reality and make-believe is very clear.

<HEAD>Investment Opportunity Amid Disaster</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The third quarter in the stock market was a
disaster for investors who had to sell. Almost every market average
and category took a drubbing. Only oil, gas and gold stocks were
major exceptions.
   The Dow Jones industrial average, the Standard &amp; Poor's
500-stock index and stock mutual funds lost 15 percent of their
value, but averages for smaller stocks fared worse. The
over-the-counter composite index plunged 25 percent.
   Those who tend to invest in certain categories of stocks might
have done much worse. Among New York Stock Exchange listings,
apparels lost 32 percent, textiles 31 percent, electronics 29
percent and automotives 27 percent.
   Some small-company shares lost more than half their value during
the three months of July, August and September. It wasn't very
unusual to see over-the-counter stocks with one-day declines of 25
percent in a single day.
   In some instances, professional pickers did as poorly as
amateurs. Many stock mutual funds lost more than 30 percent of
their value during the three months; that is, they performed worse
than dart-throwers.
   The statistical evidence is indeed a picture of disaster, but as
Chinese philosophers, inspirational teachers, evangelists and some
smart investors try to explain, disaster may also spell
opportunity.
   ``Stock prices have now declined to the point where
above-average long-term investment returns can once again be
expected,'' says Wright Investors, a large portfolio management and
advisory company that stresses the long term.
   For old investors who were forced to sell, the bad news is bad
indeed, but for new investors the bad news is good news, a
two-for-one promotion, a discount sale the like of which no
marketing executive ever imagined.
   It doesn't come without risk, of course, because the stock
market could fall even lower before the bear market ends. And the
sad fact is that the eventual rise in the market is likely to be
slower than its earlier fall.
   Nevertheless, this is the type of market in which patient
investors who stress fundamental values and maintain long-term
perspectives make lots of money. It has been demonstrated again and
again, but forgotten as often.
   The long term is stressed, for example, by investment clubs that
make up a large percentage of membership in the National
Association of Investment Clubs. The ups and downs of the economy
don't matter to them; they go right on buying.
   As a result, they automatically exploit economic dips and stock
market declines. When the market is high, they might have to pay
$10 a share, but when it falls they might get two shares for what
used to be the price of one.
   The assumption they make, of course, is that the general
tendency of the U.S. economy is to expand, and the general
direction of stocks, which reflect that economy, is to rise. They
buy and wait and profit.
   Some do, anyway. In spite of the professions of optimism and
patience, many individuals and investment clubs lose faith when the
market falls. They fail to perceive opportunity. NAIC records show
many clubs dissolve.
   It isn't easy to see beauty in the debris of a bull market, or
view it as a two-for-one sale. They might buy toothpaste that way,
but not stocks.

<HEAD>Thousands of Children Orphaned or Abandoned in Romania</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By DAN PETREANU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stan Barbu is 3 and runs on his knees
because the parents who abandoned him will not let surgeons fix his
twisted legs. The 50 other children in the orphanage are blind,
retarded or maimed.
   They are the dregs of tens of thousands of abandoned or orphaned
children who owe their plight to Nicolae Ceausescu's obsession with
population growth.
   Ten months after the Commuist dictator was overthrown and
executed, no one knows just how many children languish in Romania's
78 orphanages and in dozens of hospitals. The government says there
may be 60,000 in a total population of 23 million, but other
estimates range up to 100,000.
   What to do with them has yet to be decided. Some foreigners
believe adoption is part of the answer.
   Stan is pale and fair-haired, with a broad grin and bright eyes
that make his crippling infirmities difficult to believe.
   His fingers and toes are grown together and his legs bend inward
in arcs so severe that he must walk and run on his knees. He
delights in showing visitors what he can do.
   Although Stan's parents abandoned him two years ago, Romanian
law gives them the right to say whether he should have surgery.
They have refused, and ``there's nothing we can do but watch him
suffer'' unless the law is changed, one of his nurses said.
   Ceausescu, put to death last Christmas Day, did not permit
contraception and abortion was illegal, with few exceptions. Women
were required to have regular medical examinations to determine
whether they were pregnant.
   Couples were encouraged to have at least four children each, but
Ceausescu's economic policies made it difficult to afford more than
one.
   Parents abandoned tens of thousands of children to state
institutions. Dr. Emil Tomescu, deputy health minister, estimates
no more than 3 percent of the children in orphanages actually are
orphans.
   Of the approximately 800 Romanian children diagnosed this year
as having AIDS, most are abandoned. Doctors said the fatal disease
was spread among them through transfusions of infected blood given
before Romania had blood-screening equipment.
   Tomescu said he expected legalized abortion, new family planning
centers and an improved economy to help ease the problem of
abandoned children and orphans.
   Dr. Marghareta Creteanu, director of Stan's ward at the St.
Catherine Home for Children in Bucharest, said the institution had
admitted only 120 children since January, about half the number of
the same period in 1989.
   Barry Child of Orphanages Trust, a British organization that
aids Romania, said his organization plans to buy some houses and
put two to four children in each, along with subsidized house
parents helped by British volunteers.
   ``This way, fewer would have to live in orphanages'' and fewer
might go to orphanages, where he said ``conditions are absolutely
terrible.''
   Child said the most serious problem in orphanages was
understaffing, ``so we first want to provide groups . . . to teach
the Romanian staff wat to do to take good care of the children.''
   Liz Brown, team leader of four young Scottish nurses working as
Orphanages Trust volunteers, said: ``A head nurse won't just jump
in and help . . . as we would in other countries, and this
exacerbates the problem.''
   The deputy health minister, Tomescu, said the government
recognized the problem and had decided to increase the nurse-child
ratio from 1 to 23 to 1 nurse for each 10 children.
   Mariana Gheorghiu, a nurse at the Bucharest home, said the new
policy had not yet taken affect and ``things haven't really changed
much, despite the efforts of some dedicated people who came here to
help.''
   ``We have more milk and meat, but there is a grave crisis in
terms of personnel . . . too many kids, too few nurses,'' she said.
   As she spoke, Ms. Gheorghiu changed the diaper of Gabriela, who
was 9 months old and dying of pneumonia.
   St. Catherine's is known as one of the best children's homes in
Romania. Conditions there are poorer than in the West, but far
better than at other Romanian orphanages.
   David Livianu, director of the American Center for Romanian
Adoptable Children, said adoption is ``their only way out of a
lifetime of struggle and indignity.''
   He took the photographs of 16 children with him to the United
States in August, and said adoptive parents awaited them in the
United States. Livianu recently established an adoption center and
his organization also has offices in the Health Ministry.
   ``It can cost people up to $15,000 to come here, stay in Romania
for months and pay middlemen and lawyers en route to adopting a
child,'' he said. ``We want to . . . encourage people to instead
make donations, which can be used to buy much-needed biomedical
equipment such as incubators.''
   Adoption was simplified in August by repeal of a law that
required presidential approval of all adoptions. Under the new law,
adoptions are handled by local courts and need only the approval of
child-care specialists and the child's parents, if they are alive.
   Dan Koch, 36, the first American to adopt under the new law,
said he ``encountered very little'' bureaucratic delay or
corruption.
   ``I believe it would have taken longer and been more complicated
. . . back home,'' said Koch, who works for the Delaware state
insurance commission.
   He returned to his wife, Kathleen, with 3-year-old Ioan, now
named John Nicholas.

<DATELINE>HORSHAT TAL, Israel (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two thousand Americans on a hillside
sang ``Amazing Grace,'' and it seemed for a moment like a folk fest
of the 1960s.
   But Syria is just over the mountain, the valley is only a few
thousand yards from Lebanon and, in Israel, each day brings a new
threat from Saddam Hussein, protests by Palestinians, a tax
increase or other bad news.
   Israelis from the United States have come to Horshat Tal, in the
shadow of Mount Hermon, for 15 years to sing of adventure, Jewish
independence, religious freedom and hopes for a better world.
   Organizer Menachem Vinegrad said Americans and other
English-speaking immigrants started the Jacob's Ladder Festival
because they were ``liberals interested in changing the world'' and
missed folk and protest songs from home.
   A few thousand American Jews arrived in the first years after
independence in 1948, then victory in the 1967 Middle East war
brought a surge of Jewish pride and a rush of immigrants.
   About 65,000 Americans now live in Israel, one of the highest
population ratios of U.S. expatriates in a foreign country. They
also have one of the highest dropout rates - 35 percent.
   Among the reasons cited by Americans who return home are low
salaries, high taxes, the military draft and government
bureaucracy.
   One who stayed is Yoav Peck, who in the late 1960s became
disillusioned with the power of the American establishment and
failures in the anti-war movement.
   ``Instead of fighting against some encrusted social injustices
and everything I saw in America, I got to be a positive part of
building a nation in its adolescent years,'' said Peck, director of
the Association of Americans and Canadians in Israel.
   He said friends in America who were part of the 1960s protest
movement at the University of California's Berkeley campus now seek
meaning for their lives in the 1990s.
   In his own case, Peck said, he realizes every day that ``I have
a lifelong Berkeley'' in Israel.
   Americans have gained recognition in nearly every walk of
Israeli life, from Golda Meir, who grew up in Milwaukee and became
prime minister, to weatherman Bob Ulinski from New Jersey, who
enchants morning radio listeners with his heavily accented Hebrew.
   Most male American immigrants do reqired army service and
reserve duty. More than 150 have been killed defending the Jewish
state.
   Israelis from the United States cut across Israel's political
spectrum from Meir Kahane, founder of the Jewish Defense League on
the extreme right, to the Peace Now movement, which favors Israeli
concessions to the Arabs.
   They are among Jewish settlers in the occupied West Bank and
Gaza Strip who argue that those areas are Israel's by biblical
right.
   Unlike Israelis who sought refuge from persecution, most
American Jews have come as willing volunteers. They always have
been free to return to the United States.
   ``I wasn't a refugee,'' said Steve Lebowitz of Laurelton, N.Y.
``The only thing I was running away from in the U.S. was the rat
race.''
   Lebowitz, 38, is Israel's football commissioner, presiding over
11 amateur touch-football teams.
   ``Israel is a smaller society,'' he said. ``I really feel that
in Israel you can have an impact.''
   Sara Chark said she was called anti-Semitic names while growing
up in Lafayette, La., a predominantly Roman Catholic area. She has
three children and moved to Israel seven years ago.
   ``Here, I can go into the street and my neighbor is Jewish and I
know he may hate me because my kids make too much noise or
something else,'' she said, ``but if there is trouble, I know he is
my brother and will help me.''
   In 1983, Rabbi Shlomo Riskin of New York arrived with 40 members
of his synagogue to live in Efrat, a West Bank settlement four
miles from Bethlehem.
   ``In America, we're at best a footnote to Jewish history,'' he
said. ``In Israel, we have the possibility of becoming chapter
headings.''
   Riskin said he views those who came to Israel as ``heroes,
putting the lives of their children and grandchildren on the line
for the cause of Jewish independence.''
   Hebrew is a major challenge for immigrants, but the poor grammar
and heavy accent of Joe Criden, an American who arrived 40 years
ago, has helped make a hit of his television show about car
maintenance.
   ``We continue being Americans,'' said Marc Leventhal, a lawyer.
   Leventhal, from New Haven, Conn., is a member of the Democratic
National Committee representing Americans living abroad. He said
Americans in Israel have the highest absentee voting rate.
   ``I think most of us discover the meaning of patriotism only
after we immigrate to Israel,'' Peck said. ``The real sense of
belonging and common destiny with a country for many of us is only
born here.''
   Lenny Ravich, a founder of the Jacob's Ladder Festival, came to
Israel from Birmingham, Ala. One habit he gave up was celebrating
American holidays, he said, but now he brings hot dogs and relish
to Israeli Independence Day celebrations.
   ``While we sing Israeli songs I'll close my eyes and eat a hot
dog,'' he said. ``That, for me, is the Fourth of July.''
   David Krizelman, arrived soon after graduation from the
University of Michigan in 1967.
   ``If you could tell me I could walk around America for a half
hour during Christmas season, or go to a college football game on a
Saturday in autumn, I'd find that absolutely wonderful,'' he said.
``But I don't miss it enough to look for an excuse to go back.''

<HEAD>A Courtly Gentleman Retires From Congress</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   He arrived in time for the tidal wave of Great
Society activism, championed social concerns during the
penny-pinching Reagan era and leaves as he came, fighting for civil
rights.
   Rep. Augustus Hawkins, 83, chairman of the House Education and
Labor Committee, is a black man who never played racial politics; a
liberal who inspires affection among conservatives; a courtly
gentleman who rarely gives up or gives in.
   The diminutive, soft-spoken Democrat is retiring this year after
28 years in Congress representing Watts, the Los Angeles
neighborhood notorious for the riots that tore it apart in the
1960s.
   In the brave new Capitol Hill world of sound bites, cynicism and
big money, the void left by Hawkins' departpre may not be
immediately obvious. But there will be one. Ask any education,
labor or civil rights lobbyist; the senior Republican on his
committee; even Rep. Tom Downey, who bested him in a recent dispute
over how to channel child-care money to states and parents.
   ``This institution is going to miss him terribly,'' said Downey,
D-N.Y.
   ``He has been a relentless pursuer of social justice,'' said
Michael Edwards, chief lobbyist for the National Education
Association. ``He has very deeply held principles and a great sense
of mission. And yet he was always able to bring people together.''
   Hawkins' basic philosophy - that government must help its less
fortunate citizens - hasn't changed much since he was elected to
the California Assembly in 1934.
   ``I truly believe every person in our country is entitled to
equal opportunities. If we give them those opportunities, it will
help everybody else. That's good, ordinary common sense,'' he said
in an interview last week.
   The son of a British-born adventurer who moved his family to the
United States after exploring Africa, Hawkins won his House seat in
1962. He was the first black member from a Western state, and one
of the first things he did was sponsor the equal employment section
of the landmark 1964 Civil Rights Act.
   It was an early triumph in a congressional career that has
spanned eras of plenty and parsimony, pendulum swings in political
thought, and the inevitable mixture of achievements and
disappointments.
   Chief among the latter was the 1978 Humphrey-Hawkins full
employment bill, which put forth an admirable goal but lost a
federal job guarantee before passage. ``It's been an outright
failure in terms of implementation,'' Hawkins said bluntly. ``No
one's taken it seriously, beginning with the Carter
administration.''
   The widely supported 1988 welfare reform law, with its
requirement that some recipients take jobs, was another setback
from Hawkins' perspective. Workfare is ``a punitive approach to
forcing people off the rolls,'' he declared on the floor.
   It was an unusually harsh stand for a man who, despite his
enduring New Deal concerns, generally prefers compromise to
confrontation.
   Hawkins' grasp of political reality was put to the test in 1984,
when he became committee chairman amid rampant conservatism and a
scarcity of domestic resources. For the most part he adapted well,
building coalitions and inching ahead where possible.
   ``If you only have a potato, the only thing you can make is
potato soup. You can't make stew,'' said Bob McGlotten, chief
lobbyist for the AFL-CIO. ``Under severe circumstances, Gus has
done a tremendous job to make sure the educational systems in our
society don't fall apart.''
   The kind of money Hawkins wanted to spend on education and
programs for disadvantaged children wasn't available, but he
settled for modest gains and was rewarded with near-unanimous
passage of many major education bills.
   There was far more contention in the labor area, including
protracted battles over raising the minimum wage and guaranteeing
unpaid family leaves to workers. But civility was always the order
of the day.
   ``We don't have any animosity. We have differences,'' said Fred
Krebs, manager of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's labor and human
resources department.
   The same civility characterized Hawkins' relations with
Republicans on the committee, who recently threw him a retirement
party. Among his gifts was a homemade gavel to crack crabs and a
gag picture of Downey with a forged inscription that said ``I
really enjoyed working closely with you.''
   ``I'm very saddened that he is leaving,'' said Rep. Bill
Goodling, R-Pa., the senior Republican on Hawkins' committee. ``He
is one of the finest gentlemen I've ever met.''
   The two men had a close partnership, with the chairman often
testing his ideas on Goodling and molding them to attract broader
support.
   ``If he doesn't agree with what I'm trying to do, I try to find
out why. I know I will get the same disagreements from others,''
Hawkins said. ``If I can make modifications, we'll get something
done. If you are really interested in results, why not be
cooperative?''
   Hawkins, so light-skinned he is often thought to be white, has
never chaired the Congressional Black Caucus and prefers to cast
issues in economic rather than racial terms.
   He has promoted education, health care and nutrition for the
needy, and been instrumental in securing passage of many civil
rights laws that opened up opportunities for minorities and others.
   Ironically, as he leaves Congress, Hawkins is once again trying
to restore some of the protections he first fought for in 1964.
Bush is threatening to veto this year's Kennedy-Hawkins civil
rights bill, although Hawkins said he amended it 22 times to try to
please the administration.
   ``In some ways we're back where we were,'' Hawkins said. ``It is
discouraging, but not to the point where we're giving up. You have
this ebb and flow in American politics... You win a few and you
lose a few. By and large you try to be incremental in making
advances.''
   When Hawkins retires, he won't vanish onto the Chesapeake Bay in
his beloved fishing boat. Instead he intends to speak, volunteer
and organize on behalf of Job Corps, Head Start and other programs
he fostered in Congress. ``You don't have to be in elective office
to make a difference,'' Hawkins said. ``There's lots of things to
do, and in between I'll do a little fishing.''

<HEAD>Archaeological Site Shows First Evidence of Dental Carvings on
Child</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CUIDAD VICTORIA, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Archaeologists say the tombs of a
mysterious city have yielded the first example of the use on
children of an ancient art: carving or engraving teeth as a sign of
beauty.
   Evidence of the engraving was discovered on the teeth of a young
boy's skeleton found in the ruins of Montezuma's Balcony, whose
civilization was far more advanced than any previously thought to
exist in the region.
   Montezuma's Balcony is 310 miles north of Mexico City outside
Ciudad Victoria, capital of northeastern Tamaulipas state. Its name
is derived from that of Moctezuma, the Aztec king.
   Tamaulipas, which spent more than $53,000 on the project, plans
to open the site to the public this year.
   Two canyons and a mountain surround the remote, 12-acre city. It
is reached by a steep, rocky road that veers two miles off the main
highway to 86 huge slabs of stone named the ``grand stairway.''
   Only from the top of the stairway can the remains of more than
100 circular structures be seen, each up to 50 feet in diameter,
built from stacked and fitted rocks.
   More than 100 skeletons were found in basements, along with
ceramic fragments, food-grinding utensils, pipes, necklaces,
arrowheads, knives and small figurines.
   The remains of the boy, no older than 5, showed evidence of the
carving, called dental mutilation, in his two upper incisors and
one lower incisor.
   ``This is a very rare find,'' said Jesus Narez, director of the
Montezuma's Balcony restoration project. ``Until now, we have never
detected dental mutilations in a person this young.''
   In primitive cultures, dental mutilation is believed to be
practiced only on adults. It still is done by some Brazilian,
Indonesian and African communities.
   ``We think it hurts a lot, but . . . peyote, which was commonly
used in those times, was probably used to put the child to sleep or
dull the pain,'' Narez said.
   Several other things make Montezuma's Balcony unique, said
Narez, curator-investigator of the architectural and cultural
collections of northern Mexico at the National Museum of
Anthropology and History in Mexico City.
   He said two groups of people lived there: the Grassiles, thin
and fine featured, and the Robustus, big-boned and heavy.
Archaeologists chose the names.
   ``At least for now, we think they lived there together, but
radiocarbon testing is being done to determine if they were there
at the same time or if one group followed the other,'' Narez said.
   According to Narez, the city's 3,000 people probably lived
between the years 600 and 1400. The elite occupied in the
structures and were buried in their basements, and the others lived
in wooden huts, he said.
   References to Montezuma's Balcony appeared in a researcher's
report in the mid-1800s, and there was another report in the 1940s.
Work on the site began in 1988 and was completed in August.
   Although their culture was higher than others in the area, the
Montezuma's Balcony residents were not as advanced as the
Teotihuacans, Zapotecs or Mayas of southern Mexico, who built
pyramids and cities in the same period.
   Northern tribes like the Huastecas the warrior-like Chichimecas,
led more primitive, simpler lives than the people of Montezuma's
Balcony, Narez said.
   ``We never thought we'd find these types of buildings so far
north,'' he said, adding that huge pieces of rock used to build the
Montezuma's Balcony structures were moved with the aid of planks
and rope.
   ``A tribal group with limited organization would not have had
sufficient social structure to construct these buildings,'' he
said. ``They must have had chiefs, priests, workers and so on.''
   He said the site probably was chosen because only the side with
the ``grand staircase'' would have to be guarded.
   Circular structures are typical of Huastecas. Dome-like huts of
palm and wood built over basements were believed to lesson the
impact of hurricanes and cyclones.
   Montezuma's Balcony may have been part of a commercial corridor,
Narez said, because artifacts like pipes and necklaces show
influences of tribes from farther north like the Kaddo, Adena,
Apaches and Mississippians.
   He said how its people became extinct had not been determined.
   ``We can only guess at this point,'' he said. ``Climate changes
may have made it hard to get enough to eat. There may have been
frequent fighting with the Chichimecas. There may have been
illness.''

<HEAD>Harold Pinter: Britain's Angry Old Playwright at 60</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT WOLF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Harold Pinter, the most influential playwright of
his generation, approaches his 60th birthday as an angry artist who
hasn't written a full-length play in 12 years.
   To celebrate his birthday on Oct. 10, Pinter is being remembered
with a flurry of revivals and the delayed publication of a
decades-old novel. But there also is a sense among admirers that he
has momentarily lost or squandered his gifts.
   The man who turned the conversational pause into an emotional
minefield is now known as much for his volatility as for his
creative talent.
   ``Angry old man,'' read the headline of a Sept. 16 cover story
in Britain's Sunday Correspondent magazine focusing on his personal
belligerence, not his literary output.
   In the late 1950s and throughout the next decades, Pinter
codified a style steeped in verbal evasion and violence, menace
both spoken and not. Its effect was felt in the United States in
the plays of Sam Shepard and David Mamet and throughout British
literature, which suddenly had a new adjective: Pinteresque.
   Such plays as ``The Birthday Party'' and ``The Homecoming''
examined the sour, even horrifying underside of domestic rituals.
Their working-class milieu reflects Pinter's early life as the son
of a Jewish tailor from London's East End. He began his career in
the provinces as an actor.
   In ``Old Times'' and ``Betrayal,'' he took a literary scalpel to
highly charged erotic triangles.
   ``Betrayal,'' written in 1978, was his last full-length play.
Reflecting on his career right now, colleagues wonder whether he's
capable of another one.
   ``Maybe he's said all he wanted to say,'' says actress Eileen
Atkins, who starred in Pinter's brief play, ``Mountain Language,''
two years ago.
   ``He hasn't got a play to write, alas,'' Sir Peter Hall, his
longtime director, says.
   But he has many works worth reviving.
   This month Hall began rehearsals for a 25th-anniversary
production of ``The Homecoming,'' which he previously directed in
London and on Broadway and filmed in 1973. The play originally
starred Pinter's first wife, actress Vivien Merchant, who died in
1982, two years after their divorce.
   His first major play, 1958's ``The Birthday Party,'' is on
national tour and arrives in London on Nov. 20.
   ``Betrayal'' comes around again next year, opening Jan. 22,
1991, at north London's Almeida Theater. Rehearsals start in April
for a West End revival of ``The Caretaker,'' which Pinter himself
will direct.
   All of which reminds admirers how a once-prolific output has
dried up. In the 1980s, Pinter's only stage plays have been
one-acts: ``A Kind of Alaska'' (1982), ``One for the Road'' (1984)
and the 20-minute ``Mountain Language'' (1988).
   Even his new novel ``The Dwarfs,'' published Oct. 1,
resuscitates a work first begun, and then abandoned, more than 30
years ago.
   ``I've been very busy doing a lot of other things,'' Pinter said
in a radio interview last month for the British Broadcasting Corp.
``I haven't any plans to write a play at the moment.''
   These days, it's Pinter's politics, not his plays, that make
headlines.
   ``Yanquis go home!'' the writer argued in Britain's Independent
On Sunday newspaper in May. The piece was a broadside against
American policy in Latin America.
   Two years earlier, Pinter and his second wife, Lady Antonia
Fraser, formed the 20th July Group, a forum for anti-Tory opinion
designed to oppose the policies of Conservative Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher.
   ``I strongly feel it's my job as a citizen of this country to
keep an eye on these things,'' he sad in the BBC interview.
   When not distinguishing himself with his political
outspokenness, Pinter raises eyebrows with his choice of projects.
   A former actor, he has turned more and more to directing shows
that scarcely seem worth his time. In 1986, he directed Faye
Dunaway in ``Circe and Bravo,'' by American writer Donald Freed, to
mixed reviews.
   In May, he staged an American satire, Jane Stanton Hitchcock's
``Vanilla,'' on the West End. The play received harsh reviews and
closed seven weeks later.
   Screenwriting also keeps him occupied. Having written such 1960s
classics as ``The Servant,'' ``Accident'' and ``The Go-Between,''
he began the last decade adapting John Fowles' ``The French
Lieutenant's Woman.''
   He wrote two recent movies: ``The Handmaid's Tale,'' released
last spring, and the imminent ``The Comfort of Strangers,'' based
on the Ian McEwan novel.
   Pinter told the BBC that it was ``absolute nonsense,'' however,
to assume his playwriting days were finished.
   ``There's nothing I'd love more,'' he said. ``I'm 60 any minute,
and I've got plenty left in me, I think.''

<HEAD>Bradys on Stage Draw Bunches of Fans - But Why?</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   OK, video kids, fill in the blank:
   ``Here's the story
   ``Of a man named - - - - -''
   If you answered ``Brady,'' get in line for the unlikeliest hit
on Chicago's theater scene: ``The Real Live Brady Bunch.''
   The show is a live, word-for-word re-enactment of an episode
from the early 1970s television series, ``The Brady Bunch.'' The
all-adult cast plays it straight, from the dopey sing-along theme
song to little Cindy's irritating lisp.
   The show has become so popular since beginning its Tuesday night
run in early June that the 110-seat Annoyance Theater added a
second weekly performance in mid-August. The cramped theater in a
funky, North Side neighborhood charges $7 a ticket.
   If ``The Real Live Bradys'' is art - and not even the actors
agree on that point - it may be the first case of art imitating TV
sitcom life, a kind of life so far removed from the real thing that
it's, well, laughable.
   A concept this loopy could only have been hatched by people with
genuine affection for the Bradys: sisters Faith and Jill Soloway,
who jointly produce and direct the shows for the Metraform theater
company.
   ``We pay tribute to the Bradys, we don't disrespect them,'' Jill
said.
   Like the young professionals who fill the theater, the Soloways
are in their mid-20s and grew up watching the Brady Bunch, which
stayed on television from 1969-'74 and ran as an hour-long series
in 1977 before hitting the rerun trail.
   ``We were all really jealous of the Bradys,'' Jill said, a
sentiment also expressed by several spectators at a recent
performance.
   Brady envy? It's not hard to understand.
   In their suburban digs, the Bradys resided in a universe far
removed from the social and political turmoil of their times.
Teen-ager Greg Brady never worried he might be drafted and sent to
Vietnam. No Brady ever wondered if Nixon was a crook.
   Nor were the Brady children ever stressed by the dynamics of
their mix-and-match family: a widower and his new wife, her three
daughters, his three sons and Alice, their old-maid housekeeper.
   Brady family crises involved such mundane aggravations as Dad's
misplaced architectural plans and middle daughter Jan sneaking a
peek at eldest daughter Marcia's diary.
   And as self-styled Brady historian Max Merlin, a Northwestern
University film student, observed, ``their problems always worked
out in 23{ minutes.''
   Actress Eve Plumb, who played Jan in the series, experienced the
Brady revival first-hand when the Soloway sisters flew her in from
Los Angeles to guest star in one of their shows during the summer.
She played a bit part, choosing not to reprise her role as
pubescent Jan at age 32.
   It was ``a totally bizarre experience,'' Plumb said in a
telephone interview from Los Angeles, where she is a rotating cast
member of the Groundlings, an improvisational troupe.
   She said she doesn't understand the Bradys' enduring appeal, but
thinks the Chicago show is ``sort of a hoot.''
   ``Brady Bunch'' creator Sherwood Schwartz, who also gave us
``Gilligan's Island,'' suggested the lure of the Bradys is mostly
nostalgia.
   ``It's something people have as a reference point in their
youth, and they hold fond memories of those shows,'' he said in a
telephone interview from Los Angeles.
   But Chicago actress Jane Lynch, who plays mother Carol in ``The
Real Live Bradys,'' holds that nostalgia is only part of the show's
draw.
   She said the other half - the element that transforms ``The Real
Live Bradys'' from camp into art - is the realization by audience
members that the Bradys' uncomplicated lives were nothing like what
life turned out to be.
   ``A teacher once told me the purpose of art is to enlighten and
inform,'' Lynch said. ``This informs us as to what we bought into
as children and enlightens us that it was crap.''

   The violence of ``GoodFellas'' and other current
mob movies hasn't rattled those who crusade against rap and heavy
metal. But in the early 1930s, police and concerned citizens agreed
something had to be done about the ``too live crew'' of gangster
films.
   The New York Patrolman's Benefit Association passed a resolution
calling for a ban on films that ``glorify the lives of gangsters,
gunmen and racketeers.'' The Better Films Committee of Montclair,
N.J., blamed the death of a 12-year-old boy on a gangster movie the
murderer had seen.
   The main culprits were ``Little Caesar'' and ``The Public
Enemy.'' No matter that stars Edward G. Robinson and James Cagney
got theirs in the end; who could possibly root for the coppers when
the bad guys were played by better actors (with better wardrobes)?
   Hollywood tried. Cagney insisted he was ``sick of carrying guns
and beating up women. Movies should be entertaining, not
bloodbaths.'' And when ``Scarface: The Shame of the Nation,'' was
released in 1932, a grim warning was placed at the beginning of the
film:
   ``This picture is an indictment of gang rule in America and of
the callous indifference of the government to this increasing
menace to our safety and our liberty. ... What are YOU going to do
about it?''
   But director Howard Hawks undermined the message; the thugs
stole the show. None of the speechmaking by the film's police
commissioner was as effective as watching George Raft coolly clip
paper dolls or Paul Muni gun down fellow mobster Boris Karloff at a
bowling alley, a bullet knocking down the 10th pin.
   ``Being a gangster was better than being president of the United
States,'' Ray Liotta boasts as gangster Henry Hill in the current
``GoodFellas.'' Muni's Tony Camonte felt the same way as he stared
outside his apartment at a neon sign that read ``The World Is
Yours.''
   Gangsters really weren't that different from the old Hollywood
bosses. They talked tough, wore fancy clothes, cut million-dollar
deals. They grew up poor and had little education, but made it to
the top through hard work, ruthlessness and a strong belief in free
enterprise.
   Death was inevitable - taxes were not.
   `` . . . because they ennoble energy and because they are low
born, cocky, and self-sufficient, they demonstrate what one can
accomplish against all the odds outside the traditions,'' film
critic Neil Gabler wrote in ``An Empire of Their Own,'' his book
about Hollywood.
   Current mob movies include ``Miller's Crossing,'' starring
Gabriel Byrne as an Irish mobster with conflicting loyalties;
``State of Grace,'' another story about Irish mobsters, this one
set in New York's Hell's Kitchen and starring Sean Penn, Gary
Oldman and Ed Harris; and Martin Scorsese's ``GoodFellas.''
   The highly publicized ``The Godfather: Part III,'' again
directed by Francis Ford Coppola, is due in November. ``The
Godfather,'' released in 1972, won the Academy Award for best
picture and ``The Godfather Part II'' did the same two years later.
   No one can really identify the first gangster film, but D.W.
Griffith's ``Muskateers of Pig Alley,'' released in 1912, contained
some of the classic elements: a young couple trapped in a war
between rival gangs, a saloon, a dance hall, crooked cops and
gunmen with nervous hands.
   ``The Gangsters'' and ``The Making of Crooks,'' released during
the next few years, included such devices as a policeman working
undercover (a major part of the 1949 classic ``White Heat'') and a
pool hall where crooks and aspiring crooks gathered.
   By the late 1920s, all a Hollywood producer had to do was pick
up the newspaper to get inspiration. ``Torn From Today's
Headlines'' was how one publicity department described the gangster
films. ``Scarface,'' for instance, has a plot similar to the
notorious St. Valentine's Day massacre.
   Al Capone (nicknamed ``Scarface'') was feuding for control of
Chicago's bootlegging operations. On the morning of Feb. 14, 1929,
four men - two dressed as police officers, raided rival George
``Bugs''Moran's garage headquarters. They lined up the men against
a wall feigning a routine frisk, but instead shattered their bodies
with bullets.
   ``More and more is the realization growing that pictures can and
do play an all-important part in the cultural and educational
development of the world,'' said Jack Warner, the studio chief at
Warner Bros., which produced most of the gangster films.
   ``I do not mean we should strive for so-called intellectual
films, but we should strive for pictures that provide something
more than a mere idle hour or two of entertainment.''
   This was tabloid moviemaking, 90 minutes (or less) of screaming
headlines, random violence and sex as gentle as a grapefruit in the
kisser. Asked how Camonte (Muni) got the scar on his face, an
associate snapped, ``In a war - with a blonde in a Brooklyn
speakeasy.''
   Darryl Zanuck, the young production chief at Warner's, was the
mastermind behind many of the best gangster films, including
``Little Caesar'' and ``Doorway to Hell.'' Of Cagney's character in
``The Public Enemy,'' he boasted: ``Every other underworld picture
has had a thug with a little bit of good in him. He reforms before
the fade-out. This guy is no good at all. It'll go big.''
   Warner's churned out product like a machine gun spitting
bullets. Films were often completed in less than three weeks, with
directors rushing from set to set and writers at times working on
10 projects at the same time. Cagney once made six pictures in a
span of 40 weeks.
   Some of Hollywood's biggest stars began as tough guys and
``molls.''
   Spencer Tracy appeared in a series of gangster films, notably
``Quick Millions,'' when he was under contract to Fox in the early
1930s. At MGM, Clark Gable was a gangster in several films, edging
just slightly toward the right side of the law as he became more
famous.
   Jean Harlow had a supporting role in ``The Public Enemy,'' Bette
Davis appeared opposite Tracy in ``20,000 Years in Sing Sing'' and
Cagney in ``Jimmy the Gent,'' and Barbara Stanwyck was no angel as
the star of ``Baby Face.''
   But by 1933, the first run of gangster films was soon over. In
1933, the repeal of Prohibition ended the bootlegging wars and the
following year the Hays Office's production code called for the
violence to be toned down and demanded a stop to all the ``passions
that stimulate the baser emotions.''
   Gangsters remained on the screen, but soon the best films were
often parodies (``A Slight Case of Murder''), reflections on aging
(``High Sierra'') or chronicles of a time (``The Roaring
Twenties'') when silver tongues and deadly bullets gave small-time
hustlers the chance to be big shots.
   ``Out of this mix of energy, suspicion, gloom, iconoclasm and
liberalism came not only a distinctive kind of film, but also a
distinctive vision of America - particularly urban America,''
Gabler wrote.
   ``It was a . . . world where one's only hope and only meaning
lay not in higher morals, not in love, not in family, not in
sacrifice, but in action leavened by a sense of honor.''
   Camonte, with a reassuring pat to his coat pocket, put it
another way:
   ``In this business, there's only one law you gotta follow to
keep out of trouble.''

<HEAD>Trying To Make Souter the Benchmark Conservative Appointment</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Although David H. Souter isn't their kind of
Supreme Court justice, some influential Senate Democrats are trying
to make him a benchmark, advising President Bush that they'll fight
any future nominee who is markedly more conservative.
   The advice accompanied overwhelming Senate consent to Souter,
who takes his Supreme Court seat on Tuesday. Democrats said they
couldn't expect a more moderate choice from Bush - but wouldn't
accept one with more restrictive constitutional views.
   They may not have a lot of choice. As Republicans were quick to
note, Bush won the right to nominate judges by winning the White
House in 1988.
   One Republican said it was all an opening salvo in the next
round over the Supreme Court. Bush will likely appoint more than
one justice, certainly if he wins a second term in 1992.
   Therein lies the problem for Democrats trying to keep the court
from turning more sharply to the right. It already has turned,
since seven of the nine justices were nominated by Republican
presidents.
   ``That pendulum swings,'' reflects Justice Harry A. Blackmun, a
Republican appointee but an ally of the dwindling liberal bloc on
issues like abortion and affirmative action, the agenda by which
the spectrum now is defined. He is one of two justices over 80 and
he sees a swing to the right as a change that will last for
generations.
   ``It will stay that way now for 40 or 50 years, I'm sure,'' he
said in an interview earlier this year, before the retirement of
Justice William J. Brennan Jr., the man Souter succeeds.
   Souter was approved 90 to 9 last Tuesday. The opposition votes
came from liberal Democrats, who fear that he will tip the court
toward reversal of its 1973 decision legalizing abortion. But
theirs was no more than a protest vote because Bush never would
name a justice who would satisfy liberals on that point.
   In Souter, they got a nominee with no clear statements or prior
rulings on the issue, so nobody knows how he'd rule. He said he has
no agenda on abortion, and would listen to the arguments before
making up his mind on any ruling.
   Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del., who ran the Souter hearings
and voted for confirmation, said that if Bush were to nominate
someone opposed to abortion rights, the odds on confirmation would
drop to even at best.
   But Biden also said that if the Democratic Senate were to reject
nominees who weren't committed to abortion rights, there would be
an impasse and ``an eight-man court for as long as the president is
president ...
   ``He obviously has no intention of submitting, and will never
submit, a nominee who adheres to my very different point of view on
this matter,'' said Biden, who supports abortion. ``I know that and
we all know that.''
   Biden said that Bush should not read the wrong message into the
overwhelming vote for Souter. The vote doesn't guarantee easy
confirmation for future nominees, he said, adding ``hardliners who
believe that the Constitution is meant to be read very narrowly''
would not be acceptable.
   That's easier said than enforced, even with a Democratic
majority in the Senate.
   When the Senate voted 58 to 42 to reject Robert H. Bork three
years ago, it was dealing with a high-profile political target - a
man with sharp, confrontational, conservative positions. And the
vote followed a month of campaigning, complete with television
commercials, by a liberal coalition opposed to Bork.
   But there was not a single Senate vote against the confirmation
of President Ronald Reagan's other three court nominees, all
conservatives, all approved unanimously.
   With Biden and other Democrats arguing that Souter is as far
right as Bush should dare go, Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, protested
what he said ``appears to be in large part a thinly-veiled,
extraordinary, unfortunate and, in my view, unconvincing effort to
set the parameters'' on future nominees.
   Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., said a president has the right to
his choice unless opponents of confirmation can prove a nominee
unfit.
   The Democrats don't buy that - at least when Republicans hold
the White House.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., who opposed Souter because of
his philosophy, argued the opposite case 23 years ago, when
President Lyndon B. Johnson named Thurgood Marshall to the court.
Kennedy said then that the Senate should consider the background,
temperament, qualifications and integrity, not whether the views of
a Supreme Court nominee coincide with their own.
   Thurmond was one of the 11 senators who voted against Marshall's
confirmation in 1967.
   Inconsistency is bipartisan.

<HEAD>Rehab Center Reneges on Smoking Ban</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CLAUDIA COATES</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ALIQUIPPA, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Robin D. was in her late 20s fighting
heroin addiction, Gateway Rehabilitation Center allowed smoking.
She kicked heroin, but she couldn't kick cigarettes.
   Last summer, Robin died of emphysema. She was 43.
   ``That just pushed me over the brink,'' Gateway's co-founder and
medical director, Dr. Abraham Twerski, said.
   Her death strengthened his determination to help alcoholics and
drug users stop smoking cigarettes, which he noted kill more
Americans than all other drugs combined.
   So last October the 139-bed center 20 miles northwest of
Pittsburgh repainted its yellowed walls and banned smoking by
patients and staff. But after effectively treating drug and alcohol
abusers for 18 years, the ban lasted just eight months.
   ``It was easy to write a policy. It was hard to make it work,''
Neil Capretto, director of treatment, said.
   At first, Gateway treated nicotine like any other mood-altering
substance. ``You use - you're kicked out,'' Sharon Eakes, director
of therapy programs, said.
   Patients, whose last names are abbreviated to protect their
privacy, argued and pleaded. Alcoholic Joe M. begged through tears
to be admitted to Gateway's relapse program and be allowed to
smoke, and Ms. Eakes had to turn him away.
   Fuming patients demanded the right to smoke. During one
community meeting, one patient threatened to call in the American
Civil Liberties Union, Ms. Eakes said.
   Leeann Unitas, patient evaluator, remembered the feeling among
patients as: ``Not right now. I can't do everything at the same
time.''
   Gateway held its ground and many patients held theirs, smoking
on the sly under the threat of dismissal. And they lapsed into
addictive behaviors:
   - Family and friends smuggled in tobacco.
   - People drove up to the center at odd hours, dropped off
packages and sped away.
   - A black market developed in which a single cigarette sold for
$3 to $5.
   - Nicotine products were hidden in toilets, ceilings, radios and
even body cavities.
   - Patients went AWOL to walk to the corner gas station to buy
cigarettes. ``They were sneaking out at night, climbing out of
windows,'' Capretto said.
   The risks were great. For some, Gateway is the last chance to
salvage a relationship with a spouse fed up with drug abuse or to
keep a job where the boss has warned to dry out or move on.
   Knowing what was at stake and seeing toughness fail,
administrators softened and allowed illicit smokers two warnings
before cutting them loose. But the change just created an extra
level of bureaucracy with lists of patients warned once and twice.
The smoking and dismissals coninued.
   The policy grated on staff members, too. Employees who quit
smoking felt the same pressure and frustration as the patients.
Among the workers were recovering drug users who didn't appreciate
being treated like addicts again.
   ``It was as if they were being told their recovery didn't
count,'' Ms. Eakes said.
   Employees smoked at home, then felt guilty enforcing Gateway's
rule against patients. Sympathetic staffers pretended not to see
patients smoking, Ms. Eakes said.
   For her, the last straw came when a convict ordered by the court
to lose his addiction was kicked out of Gateway. He had been caught
walking down the road to K mart for cigarettes, she said.
   The man went back to jail - for smoking.
   By May, the dropout rate had tripled and the non-profit
treatment center was losing money. More importantly, values were at
stake. The quality that Gateway tries hardest to instill in
patients fighting addictive behavior - honesty - was being
undermined.
   Today, Gateway holds to a tenuous compromise, created in part
after officials learned at a convention last spring that other
``smoke-free'' clinics allowed smoking in restricted areas.
Patients are not permitted to smoke during lectures or group
therapy, which take up most of their time. But they may smoke in
their leisure time in a designated area outdoors.
   ``That's going to hurt a lot of people,'' said Darryl S., a coal
miner who managed to kick alcohol and cigarettes in a four-week
program at Gateway.
   ``Every few days, I think about it,'' he said. ``You do
something for so long. You pick a cup of coffee up - well, a
cigarette goes with it.''
   But the urge passes in 30 or 40 seconds, he said. Now proudly
nicotine- and alcohol-free, he spends more time with his family and
rides a bicycle nearly every day.
   Terry S., 49, hung in and also kicked nicotine and alcohol at
Gateway. But the tobacco lure proved too strong for Terry, an
accounting manager in West Virginia with his own office and plenty
of opportunity to puff his usual 30 cigarettes a day.
   ``Today, I'm smoking,'' he said. ``I don't know if it's the
pressure or the stress. I would truly like to quit.''
   It could take years, but Twerski hopes to try again to establish
a truly smoke-free clinic.
   ``We're looking as to what happened. It's all very recent. We've
got to do our homework,'' he said. ``I still hope to go for the
full loaf.''

<HEAD>New Research Links Cholesterol Cutting With Violent Death</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Doctors have long felt justified urging Americans
to lower their cholesterol. Even though many of them probably won't
benefit, cutting fat out of the diet certainly cannot hurt anyone.
   Or can it?
   Evidence is mounting that people who lower their cholesterol do
indeed reduce their risk of dying from heart disease. But a new
report concludes that is completely offset by a striking increase
in another way of death.
   For reasons no one can explain, when people reduce their
cholesterol, they seem to become more likely to die from accidents,
suicides, murders and other violent tragedies.
   ``The questions about adverse effects of cholesterol reduction
are not at all answered,'' said Dr. Matthew F. Muldoon, who
directed the study. ``That causes a lot of problems for the
strategy that you give cholesterol reduction to everybody because
it doesn't do any harm. That can't be said with much confidence.''
   Could it be that by at least one measure, lowering cholesterol
does as much harm as good?
   The discovery is so difficult to understand that experts are
cautioning people against suddenly going back to wolfing down slabs
of roast beef and gobs of ice cream. Stick to the low-fat regimen,
they urge, until they sort out what's happening.
   ``It's an interesting and disturbing phenomenon,'' said Dr. John
LaRosa, dean for research at George Washington University Medical
Center. ``Expressing concern is appropriate but not making policy
changes based on this.''
   Health policy rarely changes as a result of a single study. And
in this case, Muldoon and a few other skeptics are up against the
inertia of public belief in the evils of cholesterol as well as the
interests of a corps of influential heart specialists who want to
change Americans' way of eating.
   Hints that lower cholesterol is linked with some forms of cancer
and strokes have not cooled anti-cholesterol zeal. Neither have
niggling doubts about whether old people, women and children need
to worry about their cholesterol.
   The chief vehicle for promoting the mainstream view is the
government's 5-year-old National Cholesterol Education Program. Its
goal is to persuade people to get their cholesterol checked, eat
less saturated fat and lower their average cholesterol level by 10
percent.
   ``It is a very prudent public health policy,'' said Dr. James
Cleeman, the program's coordinator. ``This study does not shake my
confidence in the wisdom of that approach.''
   Nonetheless, the latest research increases doubts for some.
   ``The finding that there is no clear benefit in total mortality
is of concern,'' said Dr. Paul Meier, a tatistician at the
University of Chicago. ``It's cause for being more circumspect in
insisting that everybody has got to get his cholesterol down.''
   Lowering cholesterol reduces the risk of heart attacks. Since
heart attacks kill 500,000 Americans a year, many assume that lower
cholesterol also helps people live longer. But proof is skimpy.
Several studies that have delved into the health effects of
cholesterol reduction have been too small or too short to yield
definite conclusions.
   So Muldoon, a University of Pittsburgh researcher, decided to
combine results of several studies to see if a statistically
meaningful picture emerges.
   His report, published recently in the British Medical Journal,
joined the statistics of six comparison studies conducted on a
total of 24,847 healthy men. These people either reduced their
cholesterol levels an average of 10 percent or carried on without
change.
   Muldoon calculates that for every 100,000 people who cut their
cholesterol, there are 28 fewer deaths each year from heart
disease. But there are also 29 more deaths from suicides, homicides
and accidents.
   Thus, as many lives are lost as are saved.
   ``It hasn't been a large enough increase to cause a national cry
of alarm, but anybody carefully analyzing the facts has to be
concerned about it,'' said Dr. Thomas James, president of the
medical branch of the University of Texas at Galveston.
   One of the most puzzling aspects of this discovery is that there
is no obvious scientific explanation. Muldoon raises three
possibilities:
   - Cholesterol is an important ingredient of the body's cells.
Perhaps lowering the body's supply changes brain chemistry and
behavior, and this somehow makes people more reckless or
aggressive.
   - People find it ``chronically frustrating'' to give up the food
they like, and this also makes them more apt to die tragically.
   - The cholesterol-lowering drugs tested in the studies tasted
awful and caused intestinal problems. ``There may be a susceptible
group of folks where this pushes them over the edge,'' Muldoon
said.
   Actually, the study's findings are no surprise to people who
have followed the major cholesterol experiments of the 1980s.
   The first strong evidence that lowering cholesterol cuts the
risk of heart disease came in 1984 when researchers finished the
Lipid Research Clinics Coronary Primary Prevention Trial.
   Men who took cholesterol-lowering drugs in this experiment
reduced their heart disease rate by 19 percent, but they didn't
live longer. While they experienced eight fewer coronary deaths
than a comparison group, they suffered seven more violent deaths.
At the time, researchers dismissed the increase in violent deaths
as a statistical fluke.
   There was no obvious connection among these unfortunate people.
One was murdered. Others committed suicide. Some died in car
accidents, including ones in which they were not even behind the
wheel.
   However, three years later, the Helsinki Heart Study found
something similar: 11 violent deaths in those with lower
cholesterol, four in the comparison group.
   In all, researchers have conducted six studies to test the
effects of lowering cholesterol alone on otherwise healthy people.
When Muldoon combined their results, he found the chance of dying
from suicide or violence nearly doubled after cholesterol
reduction.
   Muldoon said other lines of research also have suggested links
between behavioral problems and cholesterol. Unusually low
cholesterol levels have been seen in criminals, murderers and
people with aggressive conduct disorders or poor self-control.
   A study by Dr. J.R. Kaplan of Bowman Gray School of Medicine
looked at the effects f cholesterol on monkeys. He found that
animals fed a low-fat diet like the one recommended by the American
Heart Association to lower their cholesterol committed 50 percent
more aggressive acts than did those eating fat levels closer to the
typical American diet.
   Even if Muldoon's theory is correct, backers of the war on
cholesterol argue that too much is made of death. By warding off
heart attacks, cholesterol reduction saves money, reduces misery
and helps people lead healthier lives.
   Dr. William Castelli, director of the Framingham Heart Study,
said Muldoon ``is trying to make the public believe that all that
happens to you is death. Well, it's the least that happens to you.
   ``When you have your heart attack, you're not going to die,'' he
said. ``You're going to be alive and chronically ill for the rest
of your life. We can prevent that.''

<HEAD>Fluoride Controversy Far from Over</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Public Enemy No. 1. A communist plot.
Nerve-poison.
   In the 1950s, opponents of fluoridation marshaled rhetoric and
research to fight what they called the poisoning of public water
supplies. Some doctors linked fluoride to indigestion, deafness,
and skin and mental diseases.
   Today, fluoride is mainstream. Toothpaste tubes blare it.
Bottled drinks and mouth rinses contain it, and doctors recommend
it. Sixty-one percent of Americans live in communities with
fluoridated public water.
   But the debate is far from over.
   Take Jody Morgenegg, who gathered signatures and handed out
fliers seeking to stop the Scotia village board from putting
fluoride in the water system.
   ``It's carcinogenic,'' she said. ``We feel it's not appropriate
to adulterate the water with it.''
   Or Jim Palmer, one of several board trustees who voted to
fluoridate village water earlier this year: ``It's going to protect
the children in the years their teeth are really forming.''
   The board won, and Scotia has been fluoridating its water since
March.
   Most major American health organizations - including the U.S.
Public Health Service, the American Dental Association and the
American Medical Association - have endorsed fluoridation, and cite
hundreds of studies that show fluoride reduces dental caries. Most
health organizations recommend one part per million when
fluoridating drinking water.
   ``It's a safe and effective means of preventing tooth decay,''
said Darrell Sanders, fluoridation engineer with the federal
Centers for Disease Control.
   But a vocal minority condemns fluoride as an industrial waste
product that not only mottles teeth, but kills thousands of people
every year.
   ``If you're drinking fluoridated water for 20, 30 years, you're
probably increasing your cancer risks by 5 to 15 percent,'' John
Yiamouyiannis, a biochemist in Delaware, Ohio, said.
   This year, debate over fluoride rose a notch with the release of
a study by the National Toxicology Program showing that some male
rats given high doses of fluoride in water suffered higher rates of
bone cancer than rats and mice on lower doses.
   The author of the study, Dr. John Bucher, said the results
provided only ``equivocal evidence'' that fluoride is linked to
cancer.
   Scientists first linked the mottling of teeth to fluoride early
this century in parts of the Southwest. They found the condition -
often called ``Colorado brown stain'' or ``Texas teeth'' and known
today as fluorosis - in places with high natural levels of fluoride
in drinking water. Fluoride, a compound of the element fluorine, is
found in rocks and soil and in at least trace amounts in natural
water supplies.
   Later research among children, including pilot studies in
Newburgh, N.Y., and Grand Rapids, Mich., in the 1940s, showed that
controlled amounts of fluoride in water sharply reduced tooth
decay.
   At first, scientists were unclear why. Today, fluoride is
believed to reduce the solubility of enamel in acid and can
remineralize enamel that has suffered decay.
   Since then, fluoridation has spread.
   The Pennsylvania Legislature is considering a bill that would
require most water companies in the state to fluoridate. At least
eight other states have passed similar bills, said Dr. H. William
Gross, chairman of Partners For Better Oral Health, a coalition of
groups backing the Pennsylvania bill.
   The reduction in dental caries in the decades since fluoride was
introduced is substantial. The rate of tooth decay has declined by
as much as 75 percent to 80 percent since the 1940s, according to a
1988 study by the National Institute for Dental Research.
   But opponents of fluoridation attribute the decline to better
infant nutrition and dental hygiene, and contend most of the
studies linking fluoride to tooth decay reduction are biased.
   Instead, they say fluoride is a lethal by-product of the
phosphate industry.
   Dr. Albert Burgstahler, a professor at the University of Kansas,
said he has treated people for ``fluoridation poisoning'' - chronic
fatigue, headaches and gastrointestinal problems.
   ``When patients switch to non-fluoridated water, they found that
their symptoms cleared up,'' Burgstahler said.
   ``It's the non-specific syndrome,'' said Stephen Corbin, a
dental public health specialist with the CDC. ``None of that stuff
has been attributed to fluoridation exposure.''

<HEAD>More Colleges Responding to Vegetarians' Needs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY MacVEAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vegetarian students considering colleges have to
look at more than just the course catalog.
   At some schools they could be end up surviving on salad bars and
peanut butter, while at others, entire dining rooms are devoted to
vegetarian food.
   ``Food service directors are really working hard in meeting each
segment of the student population's expectations,'' said Clark
Dehaven of the National Association of College and University Food
Service in East Lansing, Mich.
   Vegetarian eating has grown slowly but steadily over the last
decade in colleges, Dehaven said, but Vegetarian Times magazine
said it could find no public high schools that have developed
vegetarian menus.
   An estimated 8 million to 9 million Americans are vegetarians.
   The Marriott Corp., which provides food for about 400 colleges,
offers at least one vegetarian entree at lunch and dinner in
addition to salad bars and yogurts, spokeswoman Kathy Boyle said.
The company had about a dozen vegetarian recipes in its menu
rotation 15 years ago, and now has about 50, including carrot loaf
with pea sauce, curried vegetables with beans and sunflower seeds,
and vegetable quiche, she said.
   ``I think it's a matter of taking the time and investing the
time in the students and developing a program,'' said Paul
Tuennerman, director of dining services for Morrison Custom
Management, which provides the food at Swarthmore College in
Pennsylvania.
   ``A year and a half ago, I thought a vegetarian entree was rice
with cheese on it,'' he said.
   Then Tuennerman began meeting with vegetarian students, reading
books and testing recipes. Now the school serves such dishes as
tofu Oriental salad, carrot loaf, eggplant con queso, and Moroccan
stew with yams, raisins, carrots and other vegetables.
   There are two vegetarian choices at every meal, one of them
vegan, meaning no animal products of any kind. Lacto-ovo
vegttarians eat no flesh but do eat eggs and dairy products.
   At Oberlin College's lacto-ovo ``veggie dining hall,'' there
also is a vegan option for lunches and every other dinner, said
dietitian Rebecca Stotter.
   About 20 percent of Oberlin's 2,200 students eat vegetarian, and
there's usually a waiting list for the dining hall, she said.
   ``We're finding more students are wanting strict vegan entrees.
Health reasons, possibly ethical reasons, too,'' Stotter said. ``It
seems to me that it's increasing. ... I do think more colleges are
offering vegetarian options.''
   Yale University has served vegetarian food since the early
1970s, but only started offering a vegan menu in the spring of
1989, said Karen Dougherty, executive dietitian for the division of
dining halls.
   ``We have noticed that students are eating down the food
chain,'' Dougherty said. ``They are eating less beef and more
chicken and fish. And the vegetarian students are eating more vegan
dishes.''
   But at some places, there may not be much more than ``rabbit''
food. ``I think a lot of places right now are like that,'' said
Lige Weill of the Vegetarian Awareness Network, a Washington-based
non-profit organization that disseminates information about
vegetarianism.
   Cindy Meyers, a sophomore at the University of Kentucky at
Lexington, is collecting signatures on a petition in an effort to
get more vegetarian food in the cafeterias at her school.
   Last year, she said, ``I'd eat the same things every day - salad
potatoes, that sort of thing.'' But she said she is finding less
variety in the cafeteria she frequents this year.
   ``It's not only that there aren't many choices like vegetarian
lasagne, but it's also green beans cooked in bacon or that sort of
thing that you don't know about,'' she said.

   After a strenuous workout, you can feel proud
- and not just because you survived. Exercise, some researchers
say, might improve your self-esteem - although they say you can't
bank on it.
   ``All I have is anecdotal information, and it appears those who
persist in exercise say, `Yeah, it enhances self-esteem,' '' said
Wynn F. Updyke, associate dean of health, physical education and
recreation at Indiana University in Bloomington.
   Updyke is setting up a study to check the relationship between
exercise and self-esteem. He and his colleagues intend to give
physical and psychological tests to about 800 students from fourth
grade on, for at least three years. They want to study changes over
time so they can search for possible cause and effect.
   The researchers plan to test the idea that confidence in a
student's physical abilities generalizes into confidence about
himself, and they want to see if improved exercise performance
generalizes into better grades.
   Previous research generally has reported that people who
exercise tend to have higher self-esteem, said Robert J. Sonstroem,
a professor of physical education at the University of Rhode
Island.
   However, it hasn't been proved if exercise causes a change -
and, assuming it does, how important exercise is compared with
other causes, he said.
   Although Sonstroem believes exercise might raise a person's
opinion of his body, which could lead to higher overall
self-esteem, others are less certain.
   ``I think that question is still out,'' said Don Hellison, a
professor of physical education at California State University at
Chico. ``Do we think about ourselves in a holistic way, or in terms
of roles and abilities?''
   Self-esteem about physical appearance, fitness and competence in
sports might correlate with each other without generalizing into an
overall feeling, said Hellison, who is working with Updyke to plan
the study.
   Another issue is that self-esteem seems to have a lot of
behavioral roots, making it difficult to find a measurement system
that can tease the roots apart, Updyke said. In physical education,
for instance, ``it's never just exercise, it's always sports or
some other sort of skillful activity,'' he said.
   The fitness tests to be used in the study will try to reduce the
skill component by including such standard laboratory measures as
stationary bicycle riding, Updyke said.
   If the results are positive, they may indicate something else
about self-esteem - that trying and succeeding is good for your
emotional health, Updyke said. If that's the case, then programs to
improve self-esteem through exercise might empower disadvantaged
students to take charge of their lives in other areas, the research
outline said.
   For that matter, Sonstroem said, the amount of exercise you do
may be less important than how you feel about your accomplishments
in doing it.
   ``Nothing succeeds like success with self-esteem,'' he said.

<HEAD>Expert: Rural Hospitals on Critical List</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MORGANTOWN, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rural hospitals that don't adopt some
of the strategies of their big-city rivals have little hope of
fiscal recovery, a federal health expert said.
   ``Rural hospitals need to develop more aggressive marketing
strategies, using radio and television at times, as well as
aggressive community campaigns,'' said Jeffrey Human, executive
director of the Office of Rural Health Policy for the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services.
   ``Hospitals need to be promoted within their communities,'' said
Human. ``And citizens need to know that if they don't support their
hospitals, they'll lose them and the access to health care they can
afford.''
   Human said one in 10 rural hospitals closed in the last decade.
Six hundred of the remaining 2,500 are in dire fiscal condition, he
said at a state rural health conference last month.
   ``The consequences of the closure of a rural hospital to local
residents are almost always more significant than the closure of
one of many urban hospitals,'' said Human.
   Contributing to the failing health of rural hospitals, he said,
are:
   - Rural hospitals are paid 25 percent less than urban hospitals
when reimbursed by Medicare for comparable procedures.
   - Falling admissions caused, in part, by physicians referring
patients to urban hospitals.
   - A large percentage of rural patients unable to pay hospital
bills.
   - Shortage of doctors, nurses and other professionals.

<HEAD>Tlingit Fish Trap May Provide Glimpse Into Indian History</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The remains of a 700-year-old fish trap
may shed some light on the history of the Tlingit Indians in
southeastern Alaska.
   A fisherman found the trap along an eroding bank of Montana
Creek last year.
   A curved and fragile section of the basket trap is being kept in
a plastic tub filled with water at the Alaska State Museum because
it is too delicate to expose to air, which would reduce it to dust.
   Root lashings on the trap disappeared before workers' eyes when
exposed to the air, said Steve Henkriskon, museum collections
curator.
   The surging creek, a tributary of the Mendenhall River,
apparently covered the trap with mud and silt hundreds of years
ago. The mud cut off oxygen, helping to preserve the trap,
Henrikson said.
   After collaborating with several agencies and organizations,
Henrikson and archaeologist Wally Olson removed one-third of the
trap from the water in May. The rest remains buried under a
protective layer of mud.
   Recent carbon testing dated the cylindrical trap to sometime
between 1270 and 1410  more than 300 years before Russian explorer
Vitus Bering came to Alaska.
   The techniques Tlingits used to build the traps have been lost,
said Steve Langdon, an anthropologist at the University of Alaska
Anchorage.
   Jon Erlandson, an anthropology professor at the University of
Oregon, said the trap has the potential to tell anthropologists how
the devices were constructed. Erlandson and his wife,
anthropologist Madonna Moss, formerly worked at the University of
Alaska Fairbanks and have seen the trap at the museum.
   He said the trap is clearly a Tlingit artifact, likely from the
Auke Tlingit Indians.
   The Montana Creek trap also may help settle a debate about when
the Tlingits settled in southeastern Alaska. Some historians
contend they were relative newcomers, settling in the area as
recently as 300 years ago.
   But some anthropologists believe Tlingits may have settled in
the region as long as 3,000 years ago.

   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan
endorsed the $500 billion deficit-reduction package, telling
Congress that failure to approve it would have serious consequences
for an already weakened U.S. economy.
   Greenspan's views were considered crucial to chances for success
by the Bush administration, which hopes the Fed will support the
pact by lowering interest rates.
   Greenspan did not specifically promise to lower interest rates
but he replied with an emphatic ``most certainly'' when asked
Wednesday whether he believed an enacted budget agreement would
exert downward pressure on rates.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - An ill-advised excursion into risky
investments, not the high interest rates used to tame inflation
early in the 1980s, caused the savings and loan debacle late in the
decade, former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker said.
   ``The industry could have survived that episode (of high
interest rates) and the great bulk of it did,'' Volcker told the
House Banking Committee on Wednesday.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Rising oil prices from the Persian Gulf crisis
helped push up the value of orders to factories for manufactured
goods 1.8 percent in August, the government reported.
   Analysts said Wednesday that the oil-inflated boost disguised
the weakness in the industrial sector.
   ``To me, the number excluding petroleum is consistent with our
view that the economy is sliding and slipping into a recession,''
said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist with the Norwest Corp. in
Minneapolis.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - The judge presiding over the government's
conflict-of-interest case against Neil Bush went against
professional ethics by talking to reporters about the case, some
legal experts say.
   But the administrative law judge, Daniel J. Davidson, said his
remarks didn't prejudice the case or indicate that he leans ``one
way or the other.''
   In two newspaper interviews published just before the start of a
public hearing on regulators' charges against the president's son,
Davidson called the savings and loan case ``a pain,'' ``a political
football'' and ``one of the minor ones'' from a legal standpoint.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Four transactions prosecutors have chosen to
prove that Michael Milken made a career of lawbreaking have one
thing in common: They all involve taking advantage of clients.
   Legal experts said Wednesday that the theme contrasts starkly
with the defense portrait of the junk bond financier now and in the
past as a man who made a few mistakes to better serve his
customers.
   In picking its silver bullets for a mini-trial that begins next
week on allegations to which Milken has not pleaded guilty, the
government wants to challenge defense claims that Milken's crimes
were aberrant.

   Is Britain, Europe's economic miracle of the
1980s, in a recession?
   It depends whom you ask.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher says no. She criticizes
``voices of gloom'' for exaggerating ``short-term economic
difficulties,'' and insists interest rates will stay high until the
10.6 percent inflation rate is tamed.
   But many business people and economists say yes. Britain's
largest employers group, the Confederation of British Industry, is
calling for a cut in 15 percent interest rates to ``to ensure that
the recession is not any deeper than it needs to be.''
   ``Britain's economy is in a recession and there is now room for
a gradual easing in interest rates,'' said David Kern, chief
economist of National Westminster Bank.
   Britons have enjoyed eight years of sustained economic growth,
which was thought to have ended a cycle of high inflation and high
interest rates. Now the country is suffering what many economists
call the same old symptoms, and is putting in the worst performance
of the major industrialized countries.
   The generally accepted definition of a recession is two
consecutive quarters of negative or zero economic growth. One of
the difficulties, however, is pinpointing when a recession has
begun.
   Mrs. Thatcher, addressing the Welsh Confederation of British
Industry last week, complained that newspapers already have
proclaimed the beginning of a world recession, ``a return to
stagflation and an end to the United Kingdom economic miracle.''
   She said every new statistic, including the latest monthly
survey by the Confederation of British Industry, is interpreted as
heralding ``the onset of a major economic downturn.''
   The confederation survey showed confidence in Britain's
manufacturing had hit the lowest point in eight years and provided
clear evidence the economy had moved into recession.
   ``Business risks talking itself into a completely unjustified
mood of doom and gloom, a kind of artificial psychological
trough,'' Deputy Prime Minister Sir Geoffrey Howe said last week.
   Chancellor of the Exchequer John Major said the word recession
implies a slump as deep as the Great Depression.
   ``We are not in those sorts of circumstances,'' he said. ``We
have a significant but necessary slowdown at the moment.''
   But Karl Otto Poehl, president of Germany's Bundesbank, or
central bank, disagrees. ``The U.K. is already in a recession,'' he
said last week.
   Kern of National Westminister Bank said the recession signals
include a rise of 20,000 in the number of jobless in August, up
from 13,000 in July, and a Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corp. report of a 35
percent increase in business failures in the first nine months of
1990, to the highest number in a decade.
   He predicts economic growth will fall 0.8 percent in the third
quarter and 1 percent in the fourth.
   The economists offered one consolation: that the setback won't
be as bad as last time around. During the last recession, which
began in the first quarter of 1980, economic contraction lasted
five straight quarters.
   ``It bears absolutely no comparison with 1980-1981, which was
more painful,'' said Kevin Darlington, an economist at the London
investment firm UBS Phillips and Drew.
   If interest rates come down, Britain's economy could recover
next year, the economists say.

   The millions of Americans who sock away money in
mutual funds didn't escape the pain and suffering on Wall Street
during the past three months.
   In addition to taking a toll on the blue chips of the Dow Jones
industrial average, the quarter that ended Sunday belted funds
across the board. The Persian Gulf and the weakening economy were
to blame.
   ``There were very few places to hide in the third quarter,''
said Michael Lipper, whose company, Lipper Analytical Securities
Corp., released its quarterly performance report on nearly 1,800
mutual funds Wednesday.
   Lipper groups the funds into 27 categories based on the type of
investments they make, such as growth stocks or corporate bonds.
Two-thirds of these groups performed as poorly as they did in past
recessions.
   And the worst may be yet to come.
   ``If we look at our measures of prior down markets compared with
the present, there may be more to go,'' Lipper said in an
interview.
   Mutual funds are a popular way for individuals to invest in the
stock, bond and money markets. By pooling the money of many
investors, mutual funds can buy a wider variety of securities than
could a single investor, limiting the risk should any of the
investments go bad.
   Lipper's figures were for funds that invest in stocks and
taxable bonds. They did not include money market mutual funds, a
popular investment alternative to savings accounts, or funds that
invest in tax-exempt government bonds.
   Among the funds in the ranking, those that invest in stocks
fared the worst during the third quarter, declining an average of
15.5 percent. That compares with a gain of 5.9 percent in the
second quarter.
   By comparison, the 30-stock Dow Jones average had a negative
return of about 14 percent during the quarter, assuming dividends
were reinvested, while Standard &amp; Poor's 500 stock index, another
popular gauge of the stock market, lost 13.7 percent, Lipper said.
   A decline in stock funds also was not surprising given the
unusually strong performance of these funds in the 1980s, Lipper
said. The top-ranked fund in the 10 years ended Sept. 30, Fidelity
Investment's Magellan fund, grew 622.7 percent, which he called
``unsustainably high.''
   The Iraqi standoff also took a toll on many bond funds during
the quarter, since bond prices are extremely sensitive to the
inflation caused by higher oil prices. Funds that invest in
long-term, taxable bonds declined 0.8 percent on average during the
quarter, compared with a gain of 3.2 percent in the second quarter.
   The only groups of funds that grew were so-called world income
funds, which invest primarily in corporate bonds worldwide, and
gold funds, which buy stock of gold mining companies as well as
gold bullion and coins. Both were up about about 4 percent.
   However, individual funds in other groupings also rose,
including funds that invest in energy companies that benefitted
from the oil price runup, Lipper said.
   Among the losers were funds that invest in science and
technology companies, financial services, environmental companies
and small businesses, he said.
   So what should an investor do?
   David McLaughlin, a financial adviser with Chase Investment
Counsel in Charlottseville, Va., said that depends on the objective
of the investment.
   If it's for retirement, it may be safe to stay in stock funds,
since the long-term trend of the stock market is up despite
periodic slumps. These investors should look for funds that have a
good record in bear markets, he said.
   But for shorter-term investments, consider short- and
medium-term government securities, McLaughlin said.
   Signs of a looming economic downturn were evident at the end of
the second quarter, Lipper said, when half of the Lipper fund
groups were performing as they did in previous recessions. Now,
with two-thirds of them performing this way, there is no doubt
about the state of the economy, he said.
   But there's some short-term positive news for fund investors, he
said.
   ``We're down far enough that we can have a rally in this fourth
quarter'' as some investors sense the fund prices are cheap enough
to make them attractive, he said.
   During the third quarter, the top-performing fund was Dreyfus'
Capital Value fund, up nearly 13 percent in total return. For the
year ended Sept. 30, the top gainer was Equity Strategies, a small
fund that invests in bankrupt companies and is closed to new
investors.
   The worst performer for the quarter and the year ended Sept. 30
was the Prudent Speculator: Leveraged fund, which plummeted almost
47 percent for the quarter and 51 percent for the year. The fund
borrows money to make its investors' money go further, increasing
its risk in a down market, Lipper said.
   For the past 10 years, the worst-performing fund was the 44 Wall
Street Fund, which dropped almost 83 percent in return. Lipper
called it a ``stock-picking fund'' that has had a ``checkered
career.''

<TEXT>
   A proposal to give $11.1 billion in new tax
breaks to small corporations is being criticized as opening the
door for wealthy investors to duck their share of federal taxes.
   The Bush administration is pushing the new incentives as a
substitute for the capital gains tax cut that congressional leaders
refused to accept. Some of those leaders are suspicious of the
substitute, which actually includes a small capital gains
reduction.
   The proposal is attached to the $500 billion, five-year
deficit-reduction agreement that President Bush and congressional
leaders reached this week.
   The tax break proposal ``has very serious flaws,'' Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen, D-Texas, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said
Wednesday. ``I think it will lead to a substantial increase in tax
shelters and great abuse.''
   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the House Ways and
Means Committee, also has reservations. If the proposals ``are
growth incentives, he thinks they promise only to help tax shelters
grow,'' an aide said.
   Public outrage about tax sheltering was a major factor in the
sweeping income tax overhaul in 1986. Before then, many wealthy
individuals and profitable corporations were able to cut their
taxes to almost zero by making investments - many with no chance of
success - that offered huge up-front deductions.
   A Chamber of Commerce official said the new provisions could be
drawn tightly enough to avoid reviving such tax shelters.
   Bush said the plan would provide ``powerful new incentives for
productive investment in the kinds of companies that account for
much of America's job growth.''
   The key part would allow a person to deduct 25 percent of the
first $50,000 invested in a year in a ``small corporation.'' Such a
corporation would be defined as one with non-borrowed capital of
$50 million or less.
   Critics said the definition is so broad it could cover some
giant companies so heavily in debt that stockholder equity falls
below the $50 million threshold.
   Others noted the possibility a big company could split into
smaller divisions in an effort to attract investors looking for tax
breaks.
   ``It's an outrage and probably stands a shot at being knocked
out of the budget package,'' said Robert McIntyre, director of
Citizens for Tax Justice, a labor-financed group. ``We don't see
the need to encourage people to invest their money in ways that
don't make sense for them in the absence of a tax incentive.''
   The special deduction and several other small-corporation
incentives were written into the budget agreement at the
administration's insistence. That occurred after congressional
leaders refused to accept Bush's proposal to cut the capital gains
tax, on grounds that nearly 80 percent of the benefit would go to
those with incomes over $100,000 a year.
   Capital gains, the profits from the sale of investments, are
fully taxed at the same rates as other income.
   One of the proposed incentives is a new capital gains tax cut -
albeit a narrow one. It would allow an investor in a small
corporation to avoid tax on up to half the price for which the
stock was sold, as long as it was held at least five years.
   Steve Entin, an analyst with the conservative Institute for
Research Into Economics of Taxation, who wants a broad capital
gains cut, said the incentive package is so narrowly drawn that it
would benefit ``only a handful of well-to-do people who could
afford to sink a substantial portion of their money into risky
small companies.''
   Ordinary investors have to diversify to reduce risks, Entin
said, and there is little in the package for them.

<HEAD>New Claims Common Thread: Milken Took Advantage of Clients</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The four transactions prosecutors have chosen to
prove that Michael Milken made a career of lawbreaking have one
thing in common: They all involve taking advantage of clients.
   Legal experts said that theme contrasts starkly with the defense
portrait of the junk bond financier now and in the past as a man
who made a few mistakes trying to better serve his customers.
   In picking its silver bullets for a mini-trial on allegations
Milken has not been formally charged with or pleaded guilty to, he
government wants to challenge a posture that Milken's crimes were
aberrant.
   U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood ordered the unusual proceeding so
she could better understand Milken and devise an appropriate
sentence.
   Three of the transactions involve some form of trading on
nonpublic information available to Milken about a client - behavior
now viewed as a sinister and deliberate breach and not a technical
regulatory violation.
   Three of the allegations involve dealings with Ivan F. Boesky,
the disgraced stock speculator who spent time in prison and gave
the government the lion's share of its dirt on Milken.
   ``Contrary to his efforts to characterize the crimes he
committed as petty, Milken's crimes were neither technical or
victimless,'' the government said in its lengthy pre-sentencing
memorandum.
   The Justice Department claims against Milken will be aired at
the special hearing scheduled to begin Oct. 11 after Wood on
Wednesday pushed back the start date by two days. They were
included in the government's memorandum, designed to persuade Wood
to sentence Milken to a long prison term.
   Milken, former head of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s high-yield
bond department, faces a maximum 28 years in prison on six felonies
to which he pleaded guilty in April after a nearly four-year
investigation.
   The transactions to be taken up at the court hearing involve
allegations of insider trading and other violations in trading
securities of Caesar's World Inc., MGM-UA Entertainment Inc. and
Storer Communications Inc., and manipulation of Wickes Cos. stock.
   In court papers, Milken's attorneys said their client did
nothing wrong in the transactions. Prosecutors plan to call up to
14 witnesses to bolster their claims, including Boesky and several
former Drexel employees.
   After Milken's guilty plea, his chief lawyer, Arthur Liman,
noted that the six counts didn't involve insider trading and most
of them were ``instances in which Michael went too far in helping
clients.''
   Now, the government is using legal precedent to offer the
unproven claims at sentencing as evidence of years of wrongdoing.
Judge Wood asked prosecutors to limit their presentation to under
five of about 35 unproven crimes.
   ``The common denominator to the cases . . . is the government is
able to allege a breach of Milken's and Drexel's duty to their
client,'' John C. Coffee Jr., a Columbia University law professor
who has followed the case closely, said Wednesday.
   ``They tend to line up not as overzealousness on behalf of the
client but predatory behavior against a client,'' he said.
   For instance, the government claims Milken illegally used
information from his role advising Turner Broadcasting System about
its 1985 acquisition of MGM-UA in a stock trading scheme with
Boesky that netted more than $3 million.
   By buying large amounts of MGM-UA stock when the deal looked
good, the government alleges, Milken made handsome profits and
generated a false sense of the deal's viability. When the deal
appeared to sour, Milken and Boesky stopped buying, according to
the government's pre-sentencing memo. Milken's attorneys say the
charges aren't supported by the timing and prices of Boesky's stock
purchases.
   In the Storer transaction, the government claims Milken and
Boesky took advantage of a 1985 bidding war over the Drexel client
to buy and sell the company's stock, making more than $1 million in
profits. Milken's lawyers say the government's facts are wrong and
Milken did nothing illegal.
   Court papers also allege Milken bribed money managers into
buying risky Storer securities by selling other Storer securities
at below market value. The government alleges thatcash proceeds
from the Storer transactions surpassed $325 million, with Milken
and another unidentified individual personally making $172 million
in 1988.
   The Caesar's transaction alleges Milken in 1983 bought more than
$3 million in securities of the company after meeting with Caesar's
executives to discuss restructuring its debt. Drexel managed the
restructuring.
   The defense memo said the government had offered a distorted
picture of events in all the transactions and in some instances
omitted evidence it has that would undermine the claims against
Milken.

   Here are details of four alleged illegal
transactions prosecutors claim were committed by junk bond
financier Michael Milken that will be aired at a special court
hearing starting next week.
   The allegations were contained in the government's
pre-sentencing memorandum accusing the former Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc. financier of widespread wrongdoing beyond the six
felonies to which he has pleaded guilty.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>MGM-UA Entertainment Inc.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The government alleges Milken tipped Ivan F. Boesky about the
proposed 1985 acquisition of MGM-UA by Turner Broadcasting System
Inc., which was receiving financial advice from Drexel and Milken.
   Boesky allegedly bought and sold MGM-UA securities at Milken's
direction and later split more than $3 million in profits.
   The government says the trading enhanced the likelihood of the
deal's success by creating artificial demand for MGM-UA stock and
that Milken misappropriated information from Turner to generate
illegal trading profits.
   Milken's attorneys say the charges aren't supported by the
timing and prices of Boesky's stock purchases.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Caesar's World Inc.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The government claims Milken used nonpublic information to buy
more than $3 million in Caesar's bonds in 1983 prior to
announcement of debt restructuring managed by Drexel. The
government says the bonds were bought by Drexel and sold two days
later to Milken's personal retirement account.
   The government says the idea for a debt-for-stock swap was
broached at a June 29, 1983, meeting among Milken, other Drexel
executives and Caesar's representatives. The government claims
Caesar's officials favored the idea and committed to it July 1; the
defense maintains that didn't happen for a week.
   The bond purchases by Drexel were dated June 30 and in turn were
sold to Milken a day later.
   Milken's lawyers said the Securities and Exchange Commission in
1985 investigated the trading and found no wrongdoing. They said
Caesar's had not decided on a restructuring when Drexel made the
purchases.

<HEAD>Storer Communications Inc.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Prosecutors allege Boesky bought Storer securities in July 1985
after Milken tipped him about a proposed leveraged buyout by
Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts &amp; Co., which hired Drexel to secure
financing. Prosecutors claim more than $1 million in trading
profits were credited to Drexel in January 1986.
   According to court papers, Milken allegedly bribed money
managers to buy risky Storer securities by selling other securities
of the Florida cable television company at below market value. They
allege Milken also misappropriated warrants that would allow a
purchase of 25 percent of the company to private partnerships in
which he had an interest.
   The government alleges that cash proceeds from the Storer
transactions surpassed $325 million, with Milken and another
unidentified individual personally making $172 million in 1988.
   Milken's lawyers say the claims are ``based both on
misunderstandings and misstatement of the facts and the law.'' They
say KKR gave Drexel discretion to sell warrants and that money
managers have denied the alleged kickback arrangement.

<HEAD>Wickes Cos.</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The government claims Milken asked Boesky to buy a large block
of shares of Wickes, a California building products business, to
push up its stock price and make it qualify for a special and
costly dividend.
   Wickes hired Drexel in 1985 to raise money via a series of
securities offerings, including two promising a high fixed dividend
of $2.50 per share. The company did not have to redeem the shares
for three years unless its stock closed above $6.12{ for 20 out of
30 consecutive trading days.
   The government alleges Milken pushed his traders to find buyers
of Wickes stock to drive up the price. When the stock reached the
level on 19 of 28 days in spring 1986, Milken allegedly had Boesky
buy 1.9 million shares late in a trading day, pushing it above the
required level. That helped Wickes avoid having to pay the
expensive dividend for the full three years.

   Despite expecting weak sales for the rest of
this year and into next, executives running Federated Department
Stores Inc. and Allied Stores Corp. are planning for the retailers
to emerge from bankruptcy in 1991.
   The sister retailers owned by financially distressed Campeau
Corp. on Wednesday unveiled a business plan for the years through
1996 that includes store closings, but no outright sales of entire
department store chains.
   Allen I. Questrom, chairman and chief executive of Allied and
Federated, said the plan is the foundation on which to build a
proposal to get out of bankruptcy proceedings.
   He said Allied and Federated are making a push to get out of
bankruptcy as quickly as possible because the longer the process
drags on the costlier it will become.
   Neither Questrom nor James M. Zimmerman, president and chief
operating officer of Allied and Federated, would provide specific
information on what the reorganization proposal would contain.
   They refused to state how much money would be offered to
creditors who collectively are owed around $7.7 billion. Most of
the debt was amassed when Canada's Campeau bought Allied and
Federated with borrowed money in the 1980s.
   The judge supervising the bankruptcy in a Cincinnati court last
month gave Federated Stores Inc., the holding company for Allied
and Federated, until Feb. 28 to submit its reorganization plan.
   Companies operating under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy
Act are allotted time in which they have the exclusive right to
come up with their own plans. Federated has been granted two
extensions.
   The executives said the reorganization plan, which must be
approved by creditors and U.S. Bankruptcy Judge J. Vincent Aug Jr.,
would not propose chopping off any Allied or Federated divisions.
Among the nine chains they run are such well-known retailers as
Bloomingdale's, Bon Marche, Burdines, Jordan Marsh, Lazurus and
Rich's.
   The business plan presented Wednesday projects operating
earnings of Allied and Federated will more than double over the
next six years.
   Operating profits, which represent earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization, are forecast to grow to $1.13
billion in 1996 from an estimated $486 million this year.
   The plan forecasts sales will rise to $9.89 billion in 1996 from
$7.22 billion in 1990.
   Questrom said the plan contains seven key elements that will be
implemented throughout all Allied and Federated chains.
   ``It's not a plan that gets us to the moon. It's one that's
realistic,'' he said.
   It focuses on basic merchandising matters and realigns various
retail functions, such as buying, to make them more centralized. An
emphasis will be placed on keeping inventory fresh and improving
the retailers' abilities to respond quickly to changing consumer
tastes.
   It also envisions capital expenditures of $1 billion for
remodeling and maintenance. Some 16 new stores plus some
replacements are slated to be opened.
   An unspecified number of store closings are contemplated.
Zimmerman said stores that are failing to generate sufficient cash
flow will be shut down. But he declined to say which of Allied's
and Federated's 250 stores are likely to go out of operation.
   Zimmerman and Questrom said they believed pruning poor
performers would provide a better return to creditors than trying
to sell off whole divisions.
   Questrom, who was recruited after Allied and Federated filed the
bankruptcy petition Jan. 15, claimed progress will be slow in
turning around the retailers in the near future. The business plan
assumes that the country will be in a virtual recession from about
now through three quarters of next year.
   He said Allied and Federated won't engage in drastic discounting
this year to boost sales, as they have ben accused of doing in the
last Christmas season.
   He said the retailers haven't bought too much merchandise so
they won't be stuck with excessive inventories if business is as
bad as some forecasters say it will be. Inventories, at the end of
August, were about $330 million below the level of a year ago, he
said.

   Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. said Wednesday it has
formed a large fund to invest in debt-laden companies, becoming one
of the first prominent Wall Street brokerages to see opportunity in
the excesses of the 1980s.
   The venerable firm said that since April, it has raised $683
million for the fund from major U.S. and foreign pension funds,
international banks, university endowments, insurance companies and
individuals.
   In addition, the firm contributed $100 million of its own
capital and will serve as general partner of the fund, called the
Water Street Corp. Recovery Fund I, L.P.
   The fund's strategy of targeting troubled firms marks a big
departure from the goals of multimillion dollar funds of the 1980s,
which sought takeover targets or took companies private in highly
leveraged deals.
   Other smaller investment concerns have seen potential rewards in
getting distressed companies back on their feet, but Goldman's
entry into the business signaled an interest on a much larger
scale.
   Mikael Salovaara, head of Goldman's leveraged finance group and
supervisor of the fund's daily activities, anticipates annual
returns of between 25 percent and 35 percent for investors, who
contributed a minimum $5 million to participate.
   In taking large positions in financially troubled companies, the
fund will ``work as an active partner with managements whenever
possible to help them restructure financially,'' Goldman said in a
statement.
   In the past four months, Salovaara said, the fund has invested a
total of $250 million in 10 companies, most of which are Fortune
1,000 concerns. Salovaara refused to identify them.
   ``The restructuring we anticipate taking place will see a
company shrink the amount of outstanding debt . . . through
bankruptcy if it comes to that, and allow it to have a strengthened
balance sheet,'' Salovaara said.
   In the aggressive takeover days of the 1980s, investment firms
and partnerships raised millions to establish funds that invested
in acquisitions and leveraged buyouts.
   Since then, however, the stock and junk-bond markets have been
battered and the economy has weakened, forcing companies burdened
with heavy debt loads into bankruptcy or restructurings.
   Coniston Partners, one of the most prominent takeover alliances
of the 1980s, said in June that it would disband a $700 million
investment pool because of the continued shrinkage of the mergers
and acquisitions market. Both suitable takeover targets and
adequate financing had become scarce.
   In its heyday, Coniston's biggest targets included Gillette Co.,
Allegis Corp. and TW Services Inc. Coniston also agreed to
participate in the employee-led buyout of United Airlines.
   Salovaara said buying into trouble companies is ``clearly an
area people need to look at. We have a lot of companies with way
too much debt on their balance sheets, and unless that situation is
changed outside of bankruptcy court, it will end up being changed
inside bankrutpcy court.''

   Former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker
denies that the high interest rates he encouraged in the early
1980s spawned the problems of the savings and loan industry later
in the decade.
   Volcker, appearing Wednesday before the House Banking Committee,
said the industry's ill-advised excursion into risky investments,
not the highest interest rates since the Civil War, proved its
downfall.
   ``The industry could have survived that episode (of high
interest rates) and the great bulk of it did,'' he said.
   As head of the nation's central bank from 1979 to 1987, Volcker
quelled the double-digit inflation of the 1970s by drastically
slowing the economy with interest rates topping 20 percent.
   ``It was very painful, but I don't think it was the fundamental
cause of what was happening in the late 1980s,'' he said at the
second of a series of hearing exploring the roots of the S&amp;L mess.
   Banking Committee Chairman Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, who once
sought to impeach Volcker for his monetary policy, agreed that
interest rates weren't the fundamental cause, but he said they were
a contributor.
   Volcker primarily blamed the losses on the expansion of S&amp;Ls
into investments outside their traditional role of mortgage lending
and serving family financial needs, and on the inability of
inexperienced S&amp;L examiners to monitor the new business.
   ``The whole atmosphere during those years was not conducive to
strict supervision and strict regulation ... it was not in the air,
so to speak,'' he said.
   Volcker was particularly critical of S&amp;Ls' direct investment in
commercial real estate projects as part-owners rather than as
lenders.
   ``That is the single area that's bankrupted more savings and
loans than any other area,'' he said.
   ``I thought that was a bad idea to start with. ... I think that
events have clearly demonstrated that it was even more catastrophic
than I thought,'' Volcker said. ``It is just an area that
inherently is rife with conflicts of interest and temptations for
self-dealing.''
   Former thrift regulator Edwin J. Gray, who appeared with
Volcker, blamed former Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan and other
Reagan administration officials for his inability to hire and keep
the competent examiners needed to oversee S&amp;L expansions.
   Regan, who appeared before the panel Monday, characterized Gray
as an absentee regulator who as chairman of the Federal Home Loan
Bank Board from 1983 to 1987 served as a front man for the
industry.
   Gray denied the charges.
   ``Regan ... simply never lifted a finger to help us in any
material way to avert the thrift crisis,'' he said.
   Gray said Regan and the Office of Management and Budget opposed
his efforts to hire the examiners needed to monitor the activities
of thrifts in states with liberal laws and denounced the system of
state-regulated, but federally insured thrifts.
   ``The only reason why we ever had a dual federal-state thrift
system ... was that this enabled state politicians to get political
contributions,'' he said.
   Gray also said Regan, a former chairman of Merrill Lynch,
opposed his effort to clamp down on brokered deposits. Such
high-interest-rate deposits placed by money brokers are blamed for
fueling the explosive growth of risk-taking S&amp;Ls. Merrill Lynch was
the leader in that business.
   ``The U.S. Treasury Department, headed by Donald Regan, lined up
with the money brokers against the federal deposit insurance
agencies. ... He opposed the deposit insurance agencies' brokered
funds regulation,'' Gray said.

   Prices fell on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, but the
pace of trading eased after two days of feverish activity. The
dollar fell against the yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 571.20 points, or 2.56
percent, to close at 22,278.19 points. The average shed nearly 50
points in heavy trading on Wednesday after a record surge the
previous day.
   Trading was a thin 320 shares, or about half of Wednesday's
volume.
   Many players stayed away to avoid the effects of arbitrage
trading by major securities houses, said Amy Yip, manager of sales
for Baring Seucrities.
   ``Today was a relatively quiet and stable (cash) market,
although it drifted down'' on ``very, very thin activity,'' she
said.
   ``The markets are waiting to see the employment report from the
United States,'' said Yoshiro Inoue, an analyst for Nomura
Securities. The September employment report is due out in
Washington on Friday.
   Other influences included a decline on Wall Street overnight and
higher oil prices.
   Higher oil prices alone will not hurt the economy greatly over
the short term, said Tsutomu Toichi, research coordinator and chief
economist for the independent Institute of Energy Economics. What
would really hurt is higher prices over the long term, or worse,
disruption of supply.
   ``The key is how long the high prices continue: For one year,
two years, three years? If the high prices continue for four years,
then the Japanese economy can cope,'' Toichi said. ``But the world
economy will be so severely damaged (and that) will have an impact
on the economy.''
   Some analysts saw the market turning up, but only temporarily.
   ``We expect to see the market fall below Monday's low sometime
in the first quarter of next year,'' said Pelham Smithers of
Shearson, Lehman Hutton Asia Ltd. On Monday, the Nikkei index fell
as low as 19,781 points.
   In currency dealings, the dollar closed at 135.90 yen, down 0.75
yen from Wednesday.
   Traders said the dollar slid in reaction to comments by U.S.
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan indicating that U.S.
interest rates might fall.
   Greenspan said Wednesday that the proposed U.S. budget would
``almost certainly'' depress interest rates.
   He told a Congressional committee that failure to approve the
budget's $500 billion deficit-reduction package would be a ``grave
mistake'' with serious consequences for an already weakened U.S.
economy.
   In bond dealings, the yield of the benchmark 10-year government
bond fell to 8.290 percent by 3 p.m., down from 8.310 percent on
Wednesday. The price rose to 82.40 yen, up from 82.32 yen on
Wednesday.

<HEAD>Farm Exports Seen Down Slightly in New Fiscal Year</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: also on general news wires.</NOTE>

<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Farm commodity exports are expected to decline
a bit in the fiscal year that began this week, mainly because of
hefty grain supplies throughout much of the world.
   The Agriculture Department says another reason, although not a
large factor, is the historic joining of the two Germanys on
Wednesday, which will mean a slip in corn exports. East Germany
typically bought about 500,000 metric tons annually.
   But with unification, the new Germany becomes part of the
European Community, said Stephen MacDonald of the department's
Economic Research Service. Suddenly, it becomes too expensive to
import U.S. corn.
   ``Their price goes up and that price is protected by the (EC)
tariff,'' MacDonald said, commenting on a report in the October
issue of Agricultural Outlook magazine.
   Normally, West Germany has not been a significant U.S. corn
market, he said. Some has been imported, but mostly for industrial
uses.
   The main reason for a weakening of U.S. farm export prospects is
large foreign supplies of wheat, rice and corn in both the
importing and exporting countries.
   In some measure, the outlook for 1990-91 could reflect what
happened in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, although USDA
analysts say it's too early to make flat predictions.
   Also, they say, there are many variables relating to the Mideast
crisis, energy costs and global finances.
   But in 1989-90, U.S. agricultural exports probably reached 148.5
million metric tons, worth $40 billion, both slightly more than the
year before, the report said.
   ``Export volume likely rose about 2 million tons (in 1989-90),
as larger corn and soybean exports offset lower wheat exports,''
the report said. ``During the first 10 months of fiscal 1990, corn
exports rose 8 million tons, soybeans rose 2.5 million, and wheat
exports fell 7 million.''
   The drop in U.S. wheat exports was attributed to larger
prospective crops in several major importing countries, including
the Soviet Union and China; rising supplies among competitors,
especially Canada; and the anticipation of foreign buyers that
prices would decline in the future.
   Total U.S. agricultural exports to China dropped more than 40
percent last fiscal year, mostly because of the decline in wheat
shipments.
   In the first nine months of the fiscal year, the report said,
China's wheat imports from all sources fell nearly 10 percent, and
the U.S. market share dropped to about 25 percent from 50 percent.
Meanwhile, Australia and Canada increased their share of the
Chinese market.
   Wheat exports to Egypt also have weakened, the report said. This
has been due mostly to Egypt's difficulty with past-due payments
for U.S. credit extended in earlier years.
   Egypt's imports of U.S. vegetable oil, tallow and poultry meat
also are down, although sales of short-staple cotton were up
sharply as Egypt continued to increase its exports of textiles and
long-staple cotton.
   ``The U.S. ban on trade with Iraq and the U.N. general trade
embargo helped lower fiscal 1990 U.S. agricultural exports to Iraq
by $200 million from a year earlier,'' the report said. ``Wheat and
soybean meal likely accounted for most of the decline. Sunflower
oil exports also were down.''

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Imagine, a joint expedition of U.S. and Soviet
Union bug hunters hacking their way through the Amazon jungle
looking for a natural enemy of the Colorado potato beetle.
   That's a bit far-fetched, but not by much. The Agriculture
Department says the expedition to the hinterlands of Brazil bgan
this week, including three entomologists from the department's
Agricultural Research Service and one from the Soviet Union.
   Robert F.W. Schroder said in a report released by the agency
that the Colorado potato beetle is ``the single most important pest
of potatoes in both countries.'' The pest also eats tomatoes and
eggplants.
   Although the beetle itself is not a resident of Brazil, there
are 200 closely related species. And the scientists will be looking
for enemies of those relatives, seeking some that would also attack
the potato beetle.
   Schroder said the team will use sweep nets to collect live
potential beetle enemies along roadsides, into the bush and
forested areas ``wherever our guide takes us.''
   Other scientists include Michael M. Athanas, who works with
Schroder at the agency's research center in Beltsville, Md., and
Benjamin W. Puttler, who recently retired from the agency's
laboratory in Columbia, Mo.
   The Soviet scientist is Ivan Kriak of the All Union Institute
for Biological Methods of Plant Protection in Kishinev, Moldavia.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - The Agriculture Department says the Soviet
Union has bought an additional 150,000 metric tons of U.S. soybean
meal under a long-term grain agreement between the two countries.
   Officials said Wednesday that private exporters sold the meal
for delivery through Dec. 31. The current agreement, including a
three-month extension, will expire at that time and a new five-year
pact will take over.
   The new sales were made by unidentified private exporting
companies, which are required to report large sales to the
department. No selling prices or further details were released.
   Under the current grain agreement, the Soviet Union bought more
than 1.37 million tons of soybean meal during the fiscal year that
ended Sept. 30, along with 342,000 tons of soybeans.
   Grain purchases during the year totaled 20.3 million tons,
including nearly 16.5 million tons of corn and 3.8 million tons of
wheat.

<DATELINE>WATERVLIET, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Dave Backus graduated from
Watervliet High School in 1978, there was never any question what
he'd do next.
   Like many of his classmates, he went to work in the town's
80-year-old paper mill, following his father and grandfather, as
well as his mother and aunt and uncles.
   Now the future is anything but clear. Watervliet Paper Co., the
biggest employer in this southwestern Michigan town of 1,867, has
been idle since June, when its parent company filed for bankruptcy
protection.
   The mill's employees are among hundreds of thousands of factory
workers left jobless in recent months as the nation's unemployment
rate worsens. Michigan has the worst unemployment among top
industrial states.
   Backus, 31, sits at home most days now, collecting his last few
unemployment checks and awaiting word on whether anyone wants to
buy the mill and rehire its 250 workers.
   He wonders if he'll have to leave his hometown to find work.
   ``After all we've been through, I don't even want to go back -
but I will,'' he says in his living room, over the noise of an
``Andy Griffith Show'' rerun. ``The paper mill is all we know.''
   Some mill workers have moved away. Others have taken the few
full-time jobs available in the area. Most are reluctant to leave
while the mill's fate remains uncertain.
   They say no other business in the rural area can come close to
matching the $10 an hour they earned at the mill, and they worry
things are little better elsewhere.
   Michigan leads the nation's 11 largest industrial states in
unemployment with a seasonally adjusted 7.9 percent jobless rate
for August. Watervliet is in Berrien County, which has a 7.2
percent jobless rate.
   The national jobless rate in August was 5.6 percent - a two-year
high. The Labor Department will release September unemployment
figures Friday.
   Since March 1989, the number of factory jobs nationally has
fallen by more than 450,000.
   Nick Khouri, an economist for the Michigan Senate Fiscal Agency,
predicts the state's jobless rate will be 8.5 percent a year from
now.
   ``With the increase in the price of oil continuing to drain the
economy, we're going to see even more of an economic slowdown in
the next six to 12 months,'' Khouri said.
   The closure forced Mayor Robert Flaherty, who relies on the mill
for 35 percent of the municipal tax base, to eliminate the position
of police chief. There will be more cuts if the mill doesn't reopen
soon.
   Watervliet went through the same kind of emergency two years ago
when the mill's previous owner closed the mill.
   In March 1989, residents rejoiced when Kalamazoo-based Kapaco
Group Inc. bought the mill and rehired every worker.
   Kapaco had it running at full speed again within a few months,
churning out 140 tons a day of coated paper used for playing cards,
product labels and catalogs.
   ``They told us we were making the greatest paper in the world,''
says idle worker Joe Crady, sipping iced tea at the counter of
Jasmine's Family Restaurant, where his wife works as a waitress.
``I still don't understand what happened.''
   Adding to the pain of joblessness is a dispute over health
insurance. Kapaco allegedly continued payroll deductions after
canceling its insurance program.
   Kapaco Chairman Richard Jones declined to comment on the matter,
saying it would be worked out in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Kalamazoo.
   Merchants say they've been only mildly affected by the shutdown
so far, but they worry about a bleak holiday season and an even
darker future.
   ``I don't know how long I'll be able to last,'' says A.C. Bolin,
who owns a furniture store on Main Street. ``Nobody here's making
enough to even be thinking about buying furniture.''
   If the mill doesn't reopen, hope centers on the city's
small-town charm, surrounding fruit farms and scenic Paw Paw Lake,
which keep it popular among vacationers from Chicago.
   Officials also are trying to attract new industries, playing up
the town's easy access to Interstate 94, which links Detroit and
Chicago.
   ``We're optimistic things are going to work out,'' says David
Gearhart, a supermarket owner and chairman of the town's business
association. ``I don't think you're going to see Watervliet dry
up.''

<HEAD>Helms Raps GAO Report Defending Chilean Grape Ban</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: also on general news wires.</NOTE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   A government report that finds no fault with
last year's temporary ban on fruit from Chile is ``riddled with
holes and replete with inaccuracies,'' Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C.,
contends.
   The report by the General Accounting Office, the investigative
arm of Congress, looked into the finding last year of two grapes
from Chile tainted with cyanide and the subsequent five-day
suspension of all fruit imports from Chile.
   A draft copy of the GAO study circulated among news media on
Wednesday and Helms says it should not be released in final form
until the agency resolves several ``serious contradictions and
unsupported assertions.''
   ``It is riddled with holes and replete with inaccuracies. It
simply does not measure up to the usual standards of the GAO,''
Helms said in a letter to Comptroller General Charles A. Bowsher,
who heads the office.
   ``GAO has failed to present any analysis which would explain how
FDA was able to find only two contaminated grapes among millions,
before it then issued a false alarm banning Chilean fruit and
forcing its destruction in retail and wholesale outlets,'' Helms
said. ``This failure to provide any explanation for the `miracle
find' alone invalidates the entire report.''
   The GAO concluded after ``extensively evaluating FDA's
laboratory testing procedures,'' that there was no merit to charges
from Chile that the tests were botched and fruit samples
mishandled. Chilean growers say they lost $333 million by the
five-day import suspension.
   ``We found that FDA's discovery of cyanide in Chilean grapes was
based on generally accepted tests that were conducted properly,''
the GAO told Helms, who had requested the investigation. ``Based on
its finding, FDA acted within its legal authority to suspend
imports of Chilean fruit.''
   A Washington law firm that represents the Chilean Exporters
Association raised points similar to Helms' in a lengthy response
and said the report ``is riddled with errors, omissions and blind
faith acceptance of FDA excuses for inexcusable procedures and
decisions.''
   The statement by the firm of Lepon, McCarthy, Jutkowitz &amp;
Holzworth said the association's own experiments ``proved that it
was virtually impossble to inject and retain significant amounts
of cyanide in grapes. It wondered, too, about ``the incredible
claim that FDA found two and only two grapes that had been injected
with cyanide out of 90,000 pallets en route to the United States,
after looking at only 12 pallets.''
   On March 2, 1989, an anonymous caller told the U.S. Embassy in
Chile that he had poisoned fruit destined for the U.S. and Japan to
draw attention to the poor living conditions of Chilean workers.
Neither the type of fruit nor the ship on which it was being sent
was identified.
   The FDA increased its inspections of Chilean fruit and on March
12 - after checking 1,200 crates of grapes from one ship arriving
in Philadelphia - found two grapes laced with cyanide. It issued
its ban the following day.
   Two more warnings were telephoned to the embassy but no more
contaminated fruit was found.
   The GAO said it had not investigated the $333 million loss claim
by the Chilean Exporters Association.
   The agency said it used four outside consultants to evaluate the
adequacy of FDA's testing and sample protection methods and to
assess the reliability of FDA's findings.
   But Helms said the report is filled with conjecture, leaves
major scientific deficiencies unaddressed and does not consider
whether ``FDA's apparently lax security measures were adequate to
prevent adulteration of the sample after it was taken into
custody.''

<HEAD>Banks Up Against Deadline For UAL Buyout Decision</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The final push by United Airlines employees to
secure loans for a $3.8 billion buyout of parent UAL Corp. is
yielding encouraging results, says a source close to the deal.
   But the outcome of the effort isn't expected to be known until
tonight, the deadline imposed by the union-led group for bankers to
say whether they will finance the bid to create the nation's
largest employee-owned company.
   ``The informal feedback we've gotten has been good and somewhat
encouraging,'' the source said Wednesday. ``But there is a big
difference between informal feedback and commitments.''
   UAL's board has given the employee group until next Tuesday to
present a fully financed buyout package.
   The buyout group, led by United's unionized pilots, machinists
and flight attendants, originally sought to secure commitments for
a $2 billion loan by Wednesday. They extended the deadline for one
day after four lead banks tentatively agreed to kick in a total of
$1.4 billion, the source said.
   The four - Bankers Trust New York Corp., Manufacturers Hanover
Corp., Security Pacific Corp., and First Chicago Corp. - had until
the close of business Thursday to receive commitments from about 20
other banks to complete the financing, said the source, who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   The source said the other banks would not necessarily have to
pledge $600 million by Thursday but would have to commit enough to
ensure ``a successful syndication.'' The lead banks have not
defined that amount.
   ``It would be the judgment of each of the four banks whether the
syndication has been successful and whether amounts they are
prepared to provide have been committed,'' the source said.
   Financing commitments received after Thursday would be welcomed,
the source said.
   Employee group spokeswoman Martha Cid would not comment the
buyout effort, which has been alive in one form or another for
nearly four years.
   UAL's stock slipped 25 cents to $111.75 Wednesday on the New
York Stock Exchange, ending three straight days of strong gains
that had boosted its value by more than $21 a share.
   The employees are trying to put together a package that would
pay UAL shareholders about $175 a share - $150 in cash and $25 in
securities, the source said. That would be lower than the
$201-per-share, $4.4 billion bid that the board initially accepted
in April.
   The package would leave 15 percent of UAL's stock in the
public's hands, according to the source; the April offer did not
include any public ownership of UAL.

<HEAD>McDonnell Douglas Cargo Jet Program In Deeper Financial Trouble</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: also on general news wires.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
  A confidential Pentagon analysis of the
McDonnell Douglas Corp.'s C-17 cargo jet program shows a cost
overrun of up to $500 million, a newspaper reported today.
   A company official acknowledged the overrun but disputed the
figure.
   Unidentified defense officials told the Los Angeles Times they
expect the overrun to cause serious financial and political trouble
for the aerospace company.
   ``The real concern now is that this thing could blow up
politically,'' a Pentagon source was quoted as saying.
   McDonnell Douglas Vice President Michael Birch confirmed
Wednesday the company likely will overstep its $4.9 billion budget
for developing the C-17, but not by $500 million.
   ``We know it is going to be high, but not that high,'' Birch
said.
   Until last week, the company was projecting that C-17
development would run $300 million below budget.
   The C-17 is being developed and produced in Long Beach at
McDonnell's Douglas Aircraft Co. subsidiary, which employs 40,000
people.
   Last week, the Pentagon said it stopped paying McDonnell for
work on the cargo jet after questioning the contractor's project
cost estimates. The Pentagon has withheld $300 million so far.
   But Birch said McDonnell Douglas is certain it will profit from
the C-17.
   ``We feel confident that we can make money on the C-17,'' Birch
said. ``We are not going to do anything that hurts the long-term
health of the corporation.''
   Even with the cost overrun, Birch said McDonnell will not incur
losses on the C-17 program until the combined ceilings of three
different contracts are exceeded.
   The contracts include the $4.9 billion development contract and
two production contracts totaling $6.57 billion, Air Force
spokesman Capt. George Sillia said.
   Birch said McDonnell will borrow if necessary to overcome
current problems with the C-17.
   ``We still have adequate capacity to borrow,'' he said. ``We
still have hundreds of millions of dollars before we would exceed
our debt coverage.''
   McDonnell is $2.9 billion in debt. In a new credit agreement
reached with bankers earlier this year, McDonnell can run debt up
to $3.7 billion.

<HEAD>Environmental Group: Oil Companies Destroying Ecuador's Rain
Forests</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A South American oil pipeline built over a major
earthquake fault line is responsible for more spilled oil than
gushed from the Exxon Valdez, an environmental group charged.
   The Natural Resources Defense Council said oil development by
Texaco Inc. and other companies was destroying Ecuador's 32 million
acres of tropical rain forest.
   It demanded that Texaco establish a $50 million fund for
emergency cleanups and implement environmental controls to prevent
further contamination of the rain forests.
   ``The company bears at a minimum a moral responsibility to make
appropriate reparations,'' the group said in a report on results of
its 18-month on-site investigation.
   A Texaco spokesman, Dave Dixon, said the company did not receive
a copy of the report and therefore could not comment on specific
charges. But, he said, ``In all its operations, Texaco's policy is
to operate in accordance with the highest standards of
environmental conservation.''
   The report was released Wednesday at a press conference attended
by Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an attorney for the group who went to
Ecuador in July with its investigative team.
   He said contamination from spilled oil and poisonous wastes from
hundreds of oil wells was some of the worst he has seen.
   ``Children have pus coming out of their eyes from bathing in
streams, animals are dead ... adults have rashes covering their
bodies,'' Kennedy said.
   The government of Ecuador has recorded about 30 major oil spills
from the Trans-Ecuadorian pipeline between 1972 and October 1989,
with an estimated loss of 16.8 million gallons of oil, the council
said. The pipeline was then operated by Texaco, it said.
   The Exxon Valdez oil tanker spilled about 10.8 million gallons
of oil into Prince William Sound in Alaska in March 1989.
   The environmental group said that besides spills, more than 4
million gallons of untreated toxic wastes are discharged daily into
unlined pits and ultimately seep into streams and aquifers.
   The pipeline is particularly vulnerable to spills because it
crosses a major Andean fault. In March 1987, earthquakes caused 5.9
million gallons of oil to spew into the Coca River.
   Cleanup efforts are primitive, at best, the group reported.
   Kennedy said he saw residents of the Cuyabeno Wildlife Reserve
using their bare hands to scoop oil into plastic bags during a
cleanup. The bags were buried in open pits.
   At an oil well near the Shuara community he saw a man walk into
a pit filled with toxic wastes from oil production hauling out logs
and sticks to clean it up.
   ``He was submerged in oil. You could only see the whites of his
eyes,'' Kennedy said.
   Besides its charges against Texaco, the environmental group
urged Conoco, a subsidiary of Du Pont Co., to cancel plans to drill
oil in the region, saying it would risk irreparable injury to the
indigenous Huaorani people.
   Ed Davies, president and general manager of Conoco Ecuador, said
in a telephone interview from Quito, Ecuador, that the company was
working closely with the Huaorani, who number only 1,580, to ensure
oil development does not harm them.
   Environmental problems in Ecuador's tropical rain forests result
from an outdated mindset about oil drilling, he said.
   ``They really are 20-year-old developments that the entire oil
industry recognizes must change. And Conoco is committed to doing
development in a responsible manner,'' Davies said.

<HEAD>Fiat, French Electronics Group Announce Accord</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TURIN, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Italian auto giant Fiat SpA and the French
electronics group Cie. Generale d'Electricite on Thursday unveiled
a cooperation plan that will involve an exchange of stock and
industrial activities.
   Under terms of the deal announced by both companies, Fiat will
acquire 6 percent of CGE's capital, from CGE's existing shares and
from a new issue of convertible bonds. In return, CGE will get
about 3 percent of Fiat's capital, becoming one of the largest
Fiat's shareholders after the controlling Agnelli family.
   The companies valued the transaction at roughly $370 million.
   The accord is aimed at expanding their industrial activites in
the telecommunications and car battery markets. They plan to create
a 50-50 European holding company to manage and develop the
alliance, especially in high-technology.
   Other terms include:
   - CGE's Alcatel Face unit will merge with Telettra, a
telecommunications equipment concern 90-percent-owned by Fiat.
Telettra will be valued at about $2.2 billion and will become a
leader in microwave and cable transmission equipment, Alcatel said.
   - Fiat will take a controlling interest in CGE's battery unit,
Cie. Europeenne d'Accumulateurs, which holds 14 percent of the
European auto battery market. The unit will combine with Fiat's
Magneti Marelli auto unit.
   - Fiat said talks are under way to transfer a controlling
interest in its railway unit to Gec-Alsthom, a maker of railway
equipment 50 percent owned by CGE.
   Fiat has been seeking international cooperation and joint
ventures to face the growing competition of U.S. and Japanese
companies in the European markets.
   Fiat recently signed an agreement with Ford to take over the
tractor division of the U.S. group and also acquired Enasa, the
Spanish heavy truck manufacturer.
   The Italian group is known to be in talks with Ford and Chrysler
for cooperation and possible mergers in the industrial vehicles and
four-wheel-drive car sectors.

<DATELINE>NUREMBERG, Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly a half-million people were
jobless in what was East Germany as the two German states united,
the Federal Labor Office reported Thursday.
   Sharply-rising unemployment in former East Germany is one of the
major problems facing the newly united nation.
   The transition to a free market ecomony after four decades of
Communism is forcing many former East German companies to close or
to lay off workers.
   The Federal Labor Office said the unemployment rate in former
East Germany rose to 5 percent in September, from 4.1 percent.
   Economists say that up to 4 million eastern Germans could end up
losing jobs as unprofitable state-run companies are shut down. The
latest former East German company to close is the Dresden-based
camera manufacturer Pentacon, which employed about 5,000 people.
   In former West Germany, however, the unemployment rate fell to
6.6 percent in September from 6.9 percent in August, the Labor
Office said.

   Apple Computer Inc. has entered into negotiations
with Toshiba Corp. to develop lower-priced computers, Toshiba
officials confirmed Thursday.
   The announcement comes days after Japan's Sony Corp. said it is
discussing forging business ties with Cupertino, Calif.-based
Apple, one of the leading U.S. personal computer makers.
   Toshiba spokesman Masao Mochizuki said Apple recently proposed
the alliance, but he declined to elaborate.
   Analysts say Apple is seeking to diversify its product line and
lower prices. ``Apple's computer is good in performance, but is
rather expensive at present, so Apple is trying to develop new
mass-production models to expand its market shares in Japan,'' said
Yasumichi Satoh, an analyst with Sanyo Investment Management Co.
   Toshiba, a leading Japanese electric machinery maker, currently
supplies Apple with semiconductors for its personal computers.
   According to Kyodo News Service, Apple is discussing an
agreement under which Sony would make personal computers in Japan
to be marketed under Apple's name.
   Sony now produces computer disk drives and displays for Apple
Computer.
   At a board meeting held in Tokyo last week, Apple Chief
Executive officver John Sculley told reporters that his company is
bent on expanding its limited presence in Japan.

   The stock market showed no clear trend today in
another indecisive session.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials edged up 1.98 to
2,491.34 in the first half hour of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 5 to 3 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 319 up, 532 down and
441 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 15.89 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Analysts said whatever enthusiasm traders had mustered for a
compromise reached last weekend on the federal budget seemed to
have faded.
   The plan has been the subject of some sharp criticism in
Congress, raising questions about its chances for passage.
   At the same time, fresh evidence of the weak state of the
economy loomed in Friday's scheduled Labor Department report on the
employment situation in September.
   The figures are expected to show an increase in the unemployment
rate, probably to 5.7 percent, from 5.6 percent in August.
   Among the blue chips, McDonald's rose &rsqb; to 27&rsqb;; Procter &amp; Gamble
gained \ to 77&rsqb;; Philip Morris dropped &lsqb; to 48, and General
Electric was down { at 54.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dipped .11 to 170.69. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down .68 at 308.57.
   On Wednesday the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 15.84 to

   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 5 to 3 on the
NYSE, with 557 up, 956 down and 448 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 135.49 million shares, against 188.32

<HEAD>Survey: Half of Executives Don't Like Speaker Phone Conversations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Almost half of the business executives contacted
in a survey say they can't stand phone conversations where the
other party is on a speaker phone, pointing out another
technological innovation that's causing friction along with its
benefits.
   Like the mushrooming of fax machines, the proliferation of
speaker phones in recent years as standard office equipment
apparently has caused a backlash.
   ``Executives today are increasingly inundated with more
efficient but less personal means of communication, such as a fax
that anybody can read or a telephone conversation via speaker phone
that any passerby can overhear,'' said Robert Half, founder of
Accountemps, the temporary-worker agency that sponsored the survey.
   The main concern cited by those surveyed who oppose speaker
phones was the potential lack of privacy, Accountemps said.
   The next most frequent complaint was the sound quality of
speaker phone conversations, which often seem to resemble a
conversation in an echo chamber.
   Another sore point was the belief that speaker phone calls are
impersonal or patronizing.
   The survey, conducted by a market research firm, involved
questions posed to 200 executives at the nation's 1,000 largest
companies, Accountemps said.

<TEXT>
   Help-wanted advertising volume dropped in
August, in another sign of a softening in the labor market and the
overall economy, according to a monthly survey released Thursday.
   The Conference Board, a business research group, said its index
measuring help-wanted advertising volume in 51 newspapers
nationwide declined five points in August to 127 from July and 20
points from its year-ago level.
   Advertising volume rose by 7.7 percent in the region that
includes newspapers in Birmingham, Ala., Louisville, Ky., and
Knoxville and Nashville, Tenn. It also rose by 3.4 percent in
Denver, Phoenix and Salt Lake City, but declined elsewhere in the
country.
   The biggest drop, 6.6 percent, was in the region including
newspapers in Kansas City, Mo., Minneapolis, Omaha, Neb., and St.
Louis.
   The tally showed that the south Atlantic states had begun to
join the rest of the East Coast in a sharp decline in labor market
conditions. The southwest oil region, though, lost little ground,
indicating continued recovery from the mid-1980s oil slump, the
Conference Board said.
   Overall, 22 percent of the surveyed labor markets showed rising
want-ad volume in August, down from 57 percent in July.
Unemployment rose to 5.6 percent in August from 5.5 percent the
previous month.
   ``The labor market is in a slump and is unlikely to recover over
the next 12 months,'' Conference Board economist Ken Goldstein
said.
   Help-wanted advertising volume is considered to be sensistive to
labor market conditions, providing a measure of change in job
supply.

<TEXT>
   The European Community said Thursday it
would be willing to trim costly export subsidies for farmers,
although it still refused to embrace the sharp cuts demanded by the
United States.
   The community's executive body unveiled its latest agriculture
position in international trade talks that have been stalled by a
bitter dispute between the 12-nation trading bloc and the United
States over farm payments.
   Ray MacSharry, the community's top agriculture official, said in
a statement that the proposal ``strikes a careful balance between
the needs'' of European farmers and the desire for a successful
conclusion to the Uruguay Round of trade talks.
   The four-year negotiations, which are scheduled to end in
December, are aimed at overhauling the world trading system. They
are designed to reduce barriers to trade in 15 areas, including
agriculture, textiles and other manufactured goods and services
such as banking and investment.
   Community officials have been fighting to protect their export
subsidies, which are designed to help local products find buyers on
the world market. They contend getting rid of the program would
mean higher farm prices in Europe and cost millions of jobs.
   But the United States objects to the program as giving an unfair
advantage to farmers overseas.
   The community's new proposal would cut farm payments by 30
percent for such products as cereals, rice, sugar and livestock to
1996. A 10 percent reduction is proposed for fruits, vegetables and
tobacco.
   In return, it wants to raise protective measures for such
commodities as oilseeds.
   The community also said it will not give new export subsidies
for commodities not covered now.
   Moreover, it said it is willing to translate these changes into
numbers and then ``re-evaluate this quantification.''
   The U.S. Mission to the European Community had no immediate
reaction to the proposal.
   The EC statement appeared to signal the community's willingness
to bargain for reductions in export subsidies, although not to the
level the United States has been pushing for.
   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills has said the United States
intends to propose a 10-year plan for reductions of up to 70
percent in domestic farm supports and import duties and even
greater reductions in export subsidies.
   The United States backed off a previous demand that export
subsidies be eliminated. But it still wants the community to widen
its markets to foreign farm goods and slash farm payments that
encourage overproduction.
   The final offer must be approved next week by the member
nations' farm and trade ministers.

   The U.S. dollar dropped in European dealings today
and hit a postwar low against the German mark.
   Gold continued climbing for a third day.
   The dollar hit a low of 1.5310 against the mark in early
afternoon trading, breaking the previous postwar low of 1.5385
reached on Aug. 27.
   Anticipation of lower U.S. interest rates, bolstered by comments
Wednesday from U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, helped
push the dollar lower throughout the day, dealers said.
   Lower U.S. interest rates dampen demand for U.S. investments and
therefore the need for dollars.
   Greenspan endorsed the government's deficit reduction budget
proposal, saying enactment of the plan would ``lessen pressures in
credit markets'' and help investment and economic growth. Earlier,
he said a credible agreement could prompt the Federal Reserve to
reduce interest rates.
   ``When the agreement on the budget came out, people didn't know
what was going to happen,'' a senior dealer in London said. ``Now
that Greenspan more or less told the market the rates were going
down, that set the whole thing on fire.''
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.75 yen to a closing 135.90 yen.
Later in London, it fell to 134.00 yen. At midday in New York, the
dollar was trading at 134.09 yen.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.9115 from $1.8990 late
Wednesday. In New York one pound cost $1.9075.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late
Wednesday's rates included: 1.5340 German marks, down from 1.5435;
1.2760 Swiss francs, down from 1.2845; 5.1400 French francs, down
from 5.1747; 1.7300 Dutch guilders, down from 1.7410; 1,150.00
Italian lire, down from 1,160.25, and 1.1485 Canadian dollars, down
from 1.1516.
   Selected midday dollar rates in New York included: 1.5369 German
marks; 1.2723 Swiss francs; 1,151.25, and 1.1484 Canadian dollars.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $396.25 a troy ounce
from $390.75 bid late Wednesday. In Zurich, the metal rose to a
closing bid of $396.25 from $390.50 bid late Wednesday.
   Hong Kong markets were closed for the Chinese Mid-Autumn
Festival.
   Silver bullion rose in London to a late bid price of $4.71 a
troy ounce from $4.70 bid late Wednesday.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>

   British brewer Bass PLC said Thursday it plans to
invest $1 billion in its Holiday Inn hotel chain over the next
three years.
   Bass Chairman Ian Prosser said it will spend the money on
improving facilities and ``developing new concepts and new ideas.''
   ``The Holiday Inn Worldwide business offers significant
long-term profit potential, which we are determined to capture.
This investment is part of our strategy to ensure continued
development,'' he said at a gathering of Holiday Inn franchisees in
New York. A copy of his comments was made available in London,
where Bass is based.
   Investment in Bass's traditional core brewing, pub retailing,
soft drinks and leisure industry interests would continue, the
chairman said. They all ``have significant opportunities to grow.''
   Bass acquired the North American assets of Holiday Corp. in
August for $1.98 billion after paying $475 million for the
company's international hotel businesses in a deal completed in
1988.
   The billion-dollar investment would cover the 50,000 rooms that
the company said in June it would add to the chain in the coming
years.
   The chain now has 315,695 rooms in 1,584 hotels.

   When things started looking bleak for
Bloomingdale's corporate parent last autumn, a Manhattan movie
theater near the famous department store proclaimed on its marquee
``Good Luck Bloomies!''
   Now, a photograph of that message hangs on the wall outside the
seventh floor board room at the Bloomingdale's headquarters. It
reminds executives of the goodwill that has accompanied the
retailer since it entered bankruptcy proceedings in January.
   To customers, nothing seems much different. But changes lie
ahead at Bloomingdale's and the other eight chains of U.S.
department stores entangled in bankruptcy litigation by the sins of
their parent, Campeau Corp.
   Although hurt by the current spending slump and sure to suffer
if the looming recession bears down on the economy, the retailers
probably will pull through bankruptcy - although not necessarily
intact.
   Executives running Campeau's U.S. retail arms, Allied Stores
Corp. and Federated Department Stores Inc. are so sure of a
successful conclusion to bankruptcy reorganization that they are
planning on it.
   Allen I. Questrom, chairman and chief executive of Allied and
Federated, joined by James M. Zimmerman, president and chief
operating officer, presented a long-term business plan this past
week that assumes the retailers will emerge in 1991.
   Questrom told a New York news briefing the Allied and Federated
case could be one of the more successful bankruptcy reorganizations
ever in retailing.
   ``I think it's a testimony to the strength of our organizations
that they have survived this,'' he said.
   History might judge Questrom and his colleagues as overly
optimistic.
   In fairness to them, they acknowledged there are legal
complications to unravel before the retailers are ready to operate
without constraints. A tax conflict must be resolved with the
Internal Revenue Service and junk bondholders threatening to sue
Allied must be placated.
   Howard Davidowitz, chairman of Davidowitz &amp; Associates Inc., a
New York-based retail consulting firm, said presentation of the
upbeat business plan marked a preliminary skirmish in what will be
a long negotiating battle between the forces of Federated and
Allied and their creditors, who are collectively owed around $7.7
billion.
   The debt was heaped on the retailers when the Canadian real
estate developer Campeau bought them in the 1980s.
   The retailers are posturing now; trying to persuade creditors
how valuable their department stores are. That way creditors might
think they are getting a good deal if they're offered stakes in
Allied and Federated, Davidowitz said.
   Campeau's U.S. holding company, Federated Stores Inc., is
developing a reorganization plan. In it, Federated will make
compensation offers to creditors. The offers to the banks,
suppliers and holders of junk bonds, likely will be far less than
100 cents on the dollar, possibly a combination of cash and
interests in a reorganized company.
   Federated so far has obtained two extensions in the time in
which it has the exclusive right to write its own plan. Last month,
a federal bankruptcy judge in Cincinnati delayed the deadline to
Feb. 28 from Sept. 12.
   Companies operating under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy
Act almost always need longer ``exclusivity periods'' than judges
initially allot.
   Allied and Federated, which together operate 250 stores in 27
states and employ about 100,000 people, wanted the deadline pushed
past Christmas so they could tote up their take from the year's
biggest sales season before proposing how their holdings might be
divvied up.
   It might not make much difference, though, because the retail
industry's holiday will be mediocre at best. The Allied and
Federated business plan for the years through 1996 expects
recessionary conditions to prevail from now through next year's
third quarter.
   The Allied and Federated chains, with some exceptions, have had
unimpressive sales so far in 1990. Revenue slipped to $3.11 billion
in the first half of this year from $3.2 billion a year earlier.
Monthly statements submitted to bankruptcy court show they continue
to bleed money.
   Questrom and Zimmerman stressed at the briefing that the
reorganization plan would not propose selling entire divisions of
Allied or Federated. Instead, they will close individual stores
that fail to produce enough cash.
   After Questrom was recruited to run the retailers while they
reorganized, the proposed sale of Bloomingdale's was scrapped.
Apparently, even the crown jewel in Federated's collection couldn't
attract high enough bids.
   Regardless, outsiders doubt Federated and Allied can be
preserved in their present forms. Whole chains could go their
separate ways as pieces of the Campeau empire are carved up to pay
creditors' claims.
   Tortuous negotiations are in store, with creditors fighting for
what they think they should get. Davidowitz said asset sales will
be the answer as impatient creditors seek to get as much money as
possible as soon as possible. With today's weak economy, creditors
will be less willing to accept equity stakes and bet on getting
better returns sometime in the future.
   ``How else are they going to get cash without selling assets?''
Davidowitz said. ``They're going to have to have billions in cash.
They're just going to have to sell divisions.''
   ``I think they're definitely going to emerge from bankruptcy but
you're not going to recognize them,'' he said. ``They will emerge
four or five years from today as a much smaller company. Even the
divisions they keep will have fewer stores.''
   Experts say average shoppers don't know and don't care that
Allied and Federated are in a serious financial predicament.
   Bloomingdale's has tried to preserve its pizazz and still
conducts retailing as theater, complete with splashy promotions and
celebrity-studded galas. Since last autumn, the retailer has thrown
about 10 chain-wide events, including one this September saluting
Spain and promoting Spanish merchandise.
   ``I don't see that the retail operations, from a consumer's
point of view, have any changes. It seems to me to be business as
usual,'' said Diann Valentini, who shops with an extra critical eye
because of her job at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New
York.
   Valentini, assistant chairwoman of FIT's fashion
buying-merchandising department, said popular suppliers still are
prominent at Bloomingdale's. The chain continues to carry trendy
merchandise and has been able to ride the crest of fashion waves.
   It's difficult to endure the scrutiny of a bankruptcy court
judge and creditors, but Allied and Federated have handled it well,
said Lewis S. Rosenbloom, an attorney with the Chicago law firm
Winston &amp; Strawn.
   Rosenbloom, who represents unsecured creditors in the Federated
case, said the situation is unusual for a retailing bankruptcy
because the problems that drove the department stores into
bankruptcy weren't related to merchandising.
   The retailers have benefitted from the goodwill of suppliers and
financial backers.
   ``In my experience, what we have seen thus far in terms of the
level of support is quite extraordinary,'' Rosenbloom said. ``The
vendor support has been substantial.''

September sales picked up from the prior month's pace thanks to
robust business in Germany.
   Harold E. Sells, Woolworth's chairman and chief executive, said
demand in the newly united Germany will help compensate for a
sluggish retailing environment at home.
   ``Today, as the North American economy appears to be temporarily
slowing, we see Germany picking up the pace enough to offset
possible `shortfalls' elsewhere,'' Sells said.
   In remarks at a retail industry conference, Sells reaffirmed
Woolworth's intention to expand its presence in Germany and open
new stores in what had been East Germany. East and West Germany
united formally on Oct. 3.
   The German subsidiary of Woolworth plans to open one or two new
outlets by the end of this year in the former East Germany. The
retailer is looking at six to eight sites for potential stores to
be opened there in 1991, Sells said.
   He said Woolworth is ``proceeding at a cautious pace until the
stability of the market can be assessed.'' But he added that he
believes the area of former East Germany could support ``upwards of
50 to 60 Woolworth stores.''
   Woolworth has done business in Germany since the 1920s.
Currently, it operates 426 stores there, including 292 general
merchandise stores and 134 specialty stores.
   Sells said Woolworth's geographic diversity ``reduces the
potential impact of unfavorable political or economic developments
in any single market.''
   Woolworth, which operates numerous specialty chain such as Foot
Locker in addition to the Woolworth variety stores, does business
in Canada, Europe and Australia besides the United States. It has
its world headquarters in New York.
   A summary of Sells' comments to the conference sponsored by the
investment company Salomon Brothers was released by his office.
   In other comments, he said Woolworth's worldwide sales rose 15
percent in the eight weeks ended Sept. 29 from a year earlier. That
followed a 13.2 percent sales gain for the four weeks through Sept.
1.
   Sells said Woolworth's September revenue was ``well ahead of the
August pace'' largely because of the ``continued sharp gains in
Germany.'' He didn't provide specific figures.
   Woolworth, along with most of the nation's other big retailers,
is scheduled to release its results for the five weeks ending Oct.
6 next Thursday.

   The stock market drifted in a mixed pattern
today, registering what analysts described as continuing
uncertainty about the economic outlook.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down about 20 points at
midmorning, was up 14.35 at 2,503.71 by 3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   But losers outnumbered gainers by about 6 to 5 in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 666 up, 809
down and 449 unchanged.
   Analysts said whatever enthusiasm traders had mustered for the
compromise reached last weekend on the federal budget seemed to
have faded.
   The plan has been the subject of some sharp criticism in
Congress, raising questions about its chances for passage.
   At the same time, fresh evidence of the weak state of the
economy loomed in Friday's scheduled Labor Department report on the
employment situation in September.
   The figures are expected to show an increase in the unemployment
rate, probably to 5.7 percent, from 5.6 percent in August.
   Among actively traded blue chips, Philip Morris dropped &rsqb; to
47}; General Electric lost &lsqb; to 54&rsqb;; Boeing rose | to 43\, and
Pepsico gained { to 24|.
   Navistar was the volume leader, unchanged at 2| in trading that
included a 2.93 million-share block at 2{.
   Digital Communications Associates tumbled 4&rsqb; to 10|. The company
reported sharply lower earnings for the quarter that ended Sept.
30.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks edged
up .03 to 170.83. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down 1.78 at 307.47.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 122.49 million shares with an
hour to go.

<TEXT>
   A Japanese company is trying to make a futuristic
dream come true by opening an international video telephone service
for the public.
   Six Japanese women and a child sitting in the fffice of Videocom
International Corp. squealed with delight this week as they
listened to - and watched - friends and relatives in Singapore.
   Their friends spoke from a telephone office equipped with a
similar terminal, which looks like a small television with a
built-in camera.
   Service between Tokyo and Los Angeles is expected to start this
week with New York and London to follow.
   ``It was fun, great'' said Izumi Sueda, 36, who with a friend
talked in Tokyo with two friends in Singapore.
   But would they buy one? Most consumers around the world be
skeptical, analysts say.
   ``There certainly will be individuals who are eager to see their
relatives, but I don't really think it will catch on,'' said David
Benda, head of research and a specialist in electronics for
Barclay's de Zoete Wedd Securities in Japan.
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. developed a videophone in the
1950s. But the company let it ``drop by the wayside in terms of
marketing and product development,'' said John Murray, senior
technical support manager at AT&amp;T's Tokyo office.
   AT&amp;T studies showed business people missed the personal contact
of meetings. ``People would still rather jump on the plane and rack
up those frequent-flier miles. There's something about getting out
of the office,'' he said.
   Nippon Telegraph &amp; Telephone Corp., Japan's largest
telecommunications company, lists only 25 videophone customers
among its 50 million customers. About 200 customers use telephones
that provide a series of still color pictures of speakers and
listeners, while 150,000 use similar machines that provide black
and white pictures, NTT says.
   Analysts list a few reasons why Videocom's service may also be
limited in the immediate future.
   One is cost. A videophone costs more than $2,200, compared to
$73 to $365 for an ordinary telephone, NTT says.
   Meanwhile, a 15-minute call from Japan to the United States
costs $40, and from Japan to Singapore, $49.
   Videocom, which is 36 percent-owned by Kokusai Denshin Denwa
Co., Japan's main international telecommunications company, offers
an international video conference service at roughly 10 times the
price of a videophone call, but with much clearer video pictures.
   Another problem is inconvenience. At least two machines are
needed for a video call. Moreover, they need to be the same type
because machines produced by different companies often cannot
communicate, said Toshio Satoh, Videocom's president.
   For that reason, Videocom's service in Singapore is limited to a
single Singapore Telecom office and in Los Angeles to the office of
a private company, Equal Access Corp.
   The service operates only between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. local time
in Japan.
   Despite the drawbacks, Videocom hopes that several changes will
help win customers.
   One is the growing use of digital telecommunications lines,
which send information using digital instead of analog signals.
Digital signals, used by Videocom, are clearer than analog and can
carry more information.
   Such digital technology ``will force us to take a second look''
at videophones, AT&amp;T's Murray said.
   Fiber optic cables, which will become increasingly common in the
future, can transmit even more information, resulting in clearer
pictures at lower cost. Images on Videocom's equipment,
manufactured by Mitsubishi Corp. using KDD technology, now are
fuzzy and slightly jerky.
   Also, the International Telegraph and Telephone Consultative
Committee is expected this year to set standards for videophones
that should encourage manufacturers in the United States, Europe
and Japan to make machines that can communicate with each other, he
said.
   ``If people are accustomed to the video telephone, then in the
near future, there will be an opportunity to promote or market our
equipment to them,'' Satoh said.
   More demand will bring lower prices within ``one or two years,''
he said.

   The government confirmed Thursday it ordered Amoco
U.K. to improve work supervision on a North Sea gas platform or
face criminal prosecution.
   The Sept. 17 action by the Department of Energy followed an
inspection on the Amoco Alpha platform in the Leman field off the
Norfolk coast, the department said.
   The disclosure that an improvement notice had been served on
Amoco was made Thursday by Roger Lyons, assistant general secretary
of the technical workers union.
   The union claims the platform doesn't have enough supervisors
and that workers are being required to work up to 18 hours a day.
   A spokesman for Amoco wasn't immediately available for comment.
   Amoco Alpha is at the hub of the Leman gas system which produces
about 10 percent of Britain's gas supplies.
   The notice said Amoco was failing to provide a proper system of
work and proper supervision for contractors, and gave the company
until Nov. 30 to make improvements.

<TEXT>
   New England Telephone and New York Telephone
have agreed to pay $1.4 million to the U.S. Treasury and a $35.5
million rebate to long-distance customers to resolve allegations
they overcharged customers through a subsidiary, the Federal
Communications Commission said Thursday.
   The FCC in February said it intended to fine the two companies
$1.4 million - a record amount - over apparent violations of FCC
rules governing transactions between regulated telephone companies
and unregulated affiliates.
   The FCC had ordered the companies to return $35.5 million to
customers because of alleged overcharges to NYT and NET by Materiel
Enterprises Co., an unregulated Nynex purchasing subsidiary.
   The $1.4 million payment announced Thursday is a voluntary
contribution and not a fine, the FCC said. Under what's known as a
consent decree, Nynex admitted no guilt and the FCC said it had
made no findings of wrongdoing and was ending its enforcement
action.
   Nynex agreed to the $35.5 million rebate, to be made within 30
days, and would take other accounting steps to resolve allegations
of excess profits on plant and equipment purchased from the
Materiel Enterprises subsidiary.
   Local phone rates will not be affected.
   ``We hope this puts to rest any questions concerning Nynex's
desire to comply with all FCC regulations and policies in
transactions among affiliate companies,'' Nynex Chairman William C.
Ferguson said in a statement.
   The agreement ends one of several pending federal or state
actions against Nynex, one of the seven regional Bell holding
companies created in 1984 from the old Bell System.
   Nynex also has been the focus of investigations that New York
Telephone suppliers helped pay for bawdy parties and prostitutes at
annual conventions of company employees in Florida from 1984 to
1988. Nynex has denied that any ratepayer funds were involved in
the conventions.
   In May, the Justice Department filed a one-count criminal
indictment alleging Nynex violated the information services
restrictions on the regional Bell companies. Nynex denied
wrongdoing.
   On Wednesday, New York state utility regulators authorized a
study into whether Nynex should be forced to divest New York
Telephone.
   The FCC in February had said Materiel Enterprises apparently
overcharged NYT and NET by $118.5 million from 1984 to 1988. Of
that, the FCC said, $35.5 million was passed through to
long-distance customers.
   Long distance companies such as AT&amp;T, MCI and US Sprint pay
``access charges'' to Nynex and other regional Bells, and those
charges are figured into long-distance prices.
   Toby Webb, Nynex's vice president for government affairs, said
Thursday he could not estimate how much the $35.5 million rebate
would affect long-distance prices for New York and New England
phone customers.
   Webb said Nynex had agreed to the latest consent decree in order
to avoid a potentially long court battle over accounting and
purchasing procedures that no longer were in effect. Materiel
Enterprises was merged into New York Telephone and New England
Telephone earlier this year, thus making Materiel a fully regulated
company under FCC rules.
   ``The agreement is preferable to engaging in prolonged
litigation over past events and practices which have been
changed,'' Webb said. ``It is time to focus fully on meeting the
needs of our customers.''

<HEAD>Pentagon Says Shipping Free Cigarettes to Troops Violated Policy</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Version on general news wires.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A shipment of donated cigarettes was
inadvertently sent to U.S. troops in the Middle East in violation
of a Defense Department policy of discouraging the use of tobacco,
the Pentagon said Thursday.
   ``A unit did mistakenly ship four or five pallets of donated
cigarettes, not being aware of the directive against such a
practice,'' Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said.
   He said the unit was reminded of the directive and no further
shipments were sent. He did not identify the unit.
   ``Tobacco products are not an acceptable gift for distribution
to service personnel,'' the spokesman said.
   He said department regulations prohibit the military services
from distributing or transporting free tobacco products for the
troops.
   Cigarettes can be purchased at post exchanges in the Persian
Gulf region as elsewhere, Williams said.
   ``Department of Defense policy is that smoking is one of the
leading preventable causes of disease and death among military
personnel,'' he said. ``The department discourages the use of
tobacco products and encourages those who use tobacco to quit.''
   In response to a question, Williams said he did not know how
many packages of cigarettes were on the pallets. Nor did he say who
had donated the cigarettes.
   ``I think they have been consumed,'' he said.
   Earlier this week, Philip Morris U.S.A. said it had donated 2
million cigarettes to U.S. troops in response to letters from the
soldiers. That followed a Sept. 25 announcement that Brown &amp;
Williamson Tobacco Corp. planned to send an undisclosed number of
smokes to the troops.
   The announcements drew strong criticism from anti-smoking
groups, who attacked the tobacco industry for what they called a
ploy to subvert Defense Department policy and hook a new generation
of smokers.

<HEAD>Disney Sues 37 Firms for Merchandise Piracy</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Walt Disney Co. sued 37 companies Thursday
for illegally using Disney characters on clothing and other
merchandise in Florida, the company said.
   The anti-piracy suit - Disney's 26th since 1985 - charged the
defendants with copyright infringement, false designation of origin
and unfair competition.
   Disney accused the 37 companies representing about 50 stores of
selling sweatshirts, T-shirts, hats, watches, clocks, sun catchers,
dolls and other items depicting Mickey and Minnie Mouse, Donald
Duck, Goofy and Pluto.
   Among the defendants was Gala Enterprises of Central Florida, a
chain of more than 25 retail stores near Walt Disney World. Fifteen
of its stores were named in the action. Company representatives
were not immediately available for comment.
   The other 36 defendants were retail establishments, many of them
small gift shops, said Disney attorney John J. Tormey III.
   The federal suit seeks an injunction to prevent further sale of
the merchandise plus damages of at least $50,000.
   Disney has been known for vigorously protecting its trademarks,
at one point threatening to sue a day-care center for paintings of
Disney characters on the building's walls.
   In the last four years, Disney has previously filed anti-piracy
suits against about 1,070 defendants in 11 states and the District
of Columbia.
   Despite the latest lawsuit, piracy of Disney products ``will
crop up again,'' said Tormey.
   ``When you look at the 37 named in the suit today, you're
looking at the tip of the proverbial iceberg,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Assets of the nation's 522 money market mutual
funds rose $865.4 million in the latest week to a new record of
$409.96 billion, the Investment Company Institute said Thursday.
   The rise in the seven-day period ended Wednesday broke the
previous record of $409.09 million set a week earlier. That figure
originally was reported as $409.12 million but was revised by the
Washington-based mutual fund trade group.
   In the latest week, it said, assets of 255 general purpose funds
rose $192.9 million to $145.74 billion, assets of 105 broker-dealer
funds increased $85.6 million to $165.9 billion, and assets of 162
institutional funds rose $586.9 million to $99.03 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds rose in
the week ended Tuesday to 7.48 percent from 7.47 percent the
previous week, said Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade journal
in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield remained steady at 7.47 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
47 days, up from 46 days, Donoghue's said.
   The newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of 100 leading
commercial banks, savings and loan associations and savings banks
in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the effective annual
yield available on money market accounts was 6.05 percent as of
Wednesday, the same as a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super
NOW accounts, remained steady at 5.02 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 7.68
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, down from 7.69
percent the previous week. Yields were 7.82 percent on 1-year CDs,
down from 7.83 percent; 7.92 percent on 2{-year CDs, down from 7.94
percent; and 8.06 percent on 5-year CDs, unchanged from a week
earlier.

<HEAD>Business Leaders Lure Residents To Buy Stock</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Forget those dour economic forecasts for a couple
days. Business leaders are trying to put a bright face on
Massachusetts by giving residents a small bargain for buying stock
in the state's companies.
   The effort was dubbed ``Take Stock in Massachusetts Business.''
It opened with the start of trading Thursday on the Boston Stock
Exchange, and the window will close at the end of Friday's session.
   For the two days, the stock exchange agreed to waive transaction
fees for brokerage firms that in turn waived commissions for
residents who buy stock in companies headquartered in
Massachusetts.
   ``It's an opportunity for the people of Massachusetts to be
partners in their own economic future,'' said Gerald Scott,
organizer of the program, who launched the sesion by ringing an
old-fashioned school bell.
   Lately, the state's economic future has looked grim.
Unemployment has risen sharply, as the once-powerful computer,
financial and construction sectors have suffered heavy beatings.
   But the organizers of the stock program insisted that all is not
bad in Massachusetts - some companies are performing well.
   Larry Vale, a spokesman for Keane Inc., a Boston-based software
company, pointed to his firm as an example. Vale, who participated
in Thursday's opening, said Keane's net earnings grew by 24 percent
last year.
   ``In this gloom and doom mentality, people tend to forget that
below the surface there are good companies,'' he said.
   Even some companies that have been battered recently can be good
stock buys, investment analysts said. Ed Sullivan, representing
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., mentioned Digital Equipment Corp. and
Bank of Boston Corp. as two high-profile companies that have been
hurt recently but should perform well in the long run.
   For investors who think they have found a good buy, they will
avoid paying commissions that range from about 1 percent to 3
percent. That means a person buying $5,000 worth of stock will save
anywhere from $50 to $150.
   People taking advantage of the program must buy at least $1,000
worth of stock but no more than $25,000.
   Organizers cautioned that investors shouldn't buy stock simply
because they can save a small amount of money on commissions.
Instead, the main reason is to make a long-term investment.
   Similarly, Scott said he didn't expect a tidal wave of in-state
investments during the two-day program. But he said it should make
Massachusetts residents more interested in and aware of the
different companies based in the state.

   A late rally in blue chips provided one of the
few highlights in a mixed and sluggish session in the stock market
Thursday.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down about 20 points at
midmorning, closed with a gain of 27.47 at 2,516.83.
   But declining issues slightly outnumbered advances in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 731 up, 780
down and 465 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 145.41 million
shares, against 135.49 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 176.03 million shares.
   The upswing in blue chips was attributed primarily to
computer-program buying by professionals engaged in multiple
trading strategies involving options and futures on stock indexes.
   Otherwise, analysts said there had been little in the news to
dispel investors' worries about the economic outlook and impending
corporate earnings reports for the third quarter of the year.
   The enthusiasm investors initially mustered for the compromise
reached last weekend on the federal budget appeared to have faded.
The plan has been the subject of some sharp criticism in Congress,
raising questions about its chances for passage.
   At the same time, fresh evidence of the weak state of the
economy loomed in Friday's scheduled Labor Department report on the
employment situation in September.
   The figures are expected to show an increase in the unemployment
rate, probably to 5.7 percent, from 5.6 percent in August.
   Gainers among the blue chips included Eastman Kodak, up 1&lsqb; at
38&rsqb;; International Paper, up 1{ at 47{; Procter &amp; Gamble, up 1{ at
78|; American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, up } at 32\, and McDonald's,
up { at 27{.
   Navistar ranked among the volume leaders, unchanged at 2| in
trading that included a 2.93 million-share block at 2{.
   Elsewhere, several stocks were depressed by adverse earnings
surprises.
   Digital Communications Associates tumbled 4&rsqb; to 10|. The company
reported sharply lower earnings for the quarter that ended Sept.
30.
   Toro Co., which said it expects to post a loss for the fiscal
quarter ending Oct. 26, fell 2} to 12\.
   Ingersoll-Rand dropped 5~ to 33\. The company said its profits
for September and the third quarter didn't live up to expectations.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $3.76 billion, or 0.13
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained .53 to 171.33.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 1.05 to 368.42, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was up 1.29 at 312.69.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
dropped 1.56 to 349.89. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 308.14, down 1.11.

<HEAD>Dollar Off on Interest Rate Speculation; Gold Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar dropped against all major foreign
currencies Thursday amid selling on the widespread assumption that
U.S. interest rates will fall in the near future.
   Gold prices eased in U.S. trading after climbing on precious
metals markets abroad.
   The heaviest dollar selling in the United States occurred when
activity began. Domestic foreign exchange dealers took their cue
from Europe, where the dollar earlier had touched a new postwar low
against the German mark.
   John McCarthy, chief dealer at the Amsterdam Rotterdam Bank's
office in New York, said the strong dollar sales subsided as the
session progressed. But the dollar still closed lower than the day
before.
   Dealers were given an incentive to dump dollars by Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's comments to a congressional
committee on Wednesday.
   Speaking in support of the fiscal 1991 budget proposal,
Greenspan indicated the central bank would pursue a more generous
credit policy if Congress enacts the compromise on cutting the
federal deficit.
   A looser Fed policy would lead to lower U.S. interest rates,
which would tend to curb dollar demand by making returns on
dollar-denominated investments less rewarding than foreign
alternatives.
   The report due Friday on the September employment situation is
expected to reconfirm the economy's weakness and possibly weigh
down the dollar further. A downturn in the economy in itself could
cause interest rates to fall - even if the Fed doesn't give them a
nudge.
   In Europe, the dollar hit a low for the post-World War II era of
1.5310 against the mark in early afternoon trading, breaking the
previous postwar low of 1.5385 reached on Aug. 27. It traded at
1.5340 marks late in New York, down from 1.5420 late Wednesday.
   The dollar also weakened against the Japanese yen. In Tokyo, it
fell 0.75 yen to a closing 135.90 yen. Later in London, it fell to
134.00 yen. The dollar closed at 133.83 yen in New York vs. 136.04
yen Wednesday.
   The British pound rose to $1.9115 from $1.8990 late Wednesday.
In New York, it cost $1.9145 to buy a pound, more expensive than
Wednesday's $1.9025.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Wednesday's
late quotes, included: 1.2800 Swiss francs, down from 1.2835;
5.1375 French francs, down from 5.1660; 1,149.00 Italian lire, down
from 1,155.75; and 1.14865 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1516.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Wednesday's
rates, were: 1.5340 German marks, down from 1.5435; 1.2760 Swiss
francs, down from 1.2845; 5.1400 French francs, down from 5.1747;
1.7300 Dutch guilders, down from 1.7410; 1,150.00 Italian lire,
down from 1,160.25, and 1.1485 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1516.
   Gold prices were mixed. On New York's Commodity Exchange,
bullion for October delivery settled at $392.30 a troy ounce, down
$1.60 from Wednesday. Later, Republic National Bank quoted a bid
for gold of $393.20 an ounce, 75 cents below Wednesday's 4 p.m. EDT
bid.
   In London, gold rose to a late bid of $396.25 a troy ounce from
$390.75 bid late Wednesday. In Zurich, the metal rose to a closing
bid of $396.25 from $390.50 bid late Wednesday.
   Hong Kong markets were closed for the Chinese Mid-Autumn
Festival.
   Silver prices also were mixed. On New York's Comex, silver for
current delivery settled at $4.668 a troy ounce, down from $4.690
on Wednesday. In London, silver rose to a late bid of $4.71 a troy
ounce from $4.70 bid late Wednesday.

<HEAD>Pork Belly Runup Peaks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A powerful three-day surge in pork belly futures prices peaked
Thursday on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange as buying interest
sparked by a surprising government hogs-and-pigs report exhausted
itself.
   Frozen pork bellies for delivery in February closed above
Wednesday's closing price but below the day's high of 64.9 cents a
pound, which represented a gain of nearly 12 percent since Friday.
   On other commodity markets, livestock futures were mixed; energy
futures were mixed; precious metals retreated; and grains and
soybeans were mixed.
   Pork bellies settled .65 cent lower to .25 cent higher with
February up .25 cent at 64.45 cents a pound.
   Pork bellies had risen the permitted daily limit of 2 cents a
pound Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday in reaction to Friday's
quarterly hogs-and-pigs inventory.
   The Agriculture Department report included an estimate of the
number of pigs born during the summer that was 2 percent lower than
in 1989. Most market analysts had expected summer farrowings to be
unchanged or even a little higher than a year earlier.
   The unexpectedly low number means the number of hogs available
for slaughter in the first quarter of 1991, when those piglets
mature, also will be below the year-ago level, said Charles Levitt,
senior livestock analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.
   He said most observers had expected the slaughter rate to level
off or begin to rise in the first quarter.
   ``What we did not expect was that the decline in slaughters from
a year earlier would be extended into next year, which means it's
going to be at least next spring before we get increases in the hog
slaughter compared to the year previous,'' Levitt said.
   The market also was supported recently by indications that
frozen belly supplies are virtually depleted, he said.
   Phil Stanley, a livestock consultant for DEC Futures Inc., said
the relative weakness Thursday in the belly market also reflected
profit-taking by traders who had taken bullish positions ahead of
the report.
   In livestock trading on the Merc, live cattle futures settled
.08 cent to .33 cent lower with October at 79.75 cents a pound;
feeder cattle were .15 cent lower to .20 cent higher with October
at 87.75 cents a pound; live hogs were .62 cent lower to .65 cent
higher with October at 57.25 cents a pound.
   Crude oil and gasoline futures ended lower in a day of volatile
trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange as a new push for peace
in the Persian Gulf began.
   Among other Middle East events Thursday, a Soviet envoy carried
a secret message from Mikhail Gorbachev to Baghdad and Japan's
prime minister met with Iraq's No. 2 leader.
   And the USS Independence - the first American aircraft carrier
in the gulf in 16 years - left the waterway after a brief show of
force.
   Light sweet crude oil futures finished 35 cents to 75 cents
lower with November at $36.93 a barrel; heating oil was .34 cent to
.90 cent higher with November at 99.92 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .30 cent to 2.35 cents lower with November at 90.86
cents a gallon.
   Precious metal futures, which have shadowed crude oil's moves
since the Persian Gulf confrontation began, fell on New York's
Commodity Exchange.
   Gold finished $1.60 to $2 lower with October at $392.30 a troy
ounce; silver was 2.2 cents to 2.3 cents lower with October at
$4.668 a troy ounce.
   Soybean futures ended lower on the Chicago Board of Trade after
a late round of profit-taking but corn and wheat futures rose for
the third straight day.
   With the soybean harvest due to begin in earnest within a week,
many traders cashed out of the market with profits produced by
Wednesday's sharp advance, said William Biedermann, research
director for the commodities brokerage Allendale Inc.
   Wheat futures settled 2 cents lower to } cent higher with
December at $2.75 a bushel; corn was 1 cent to 2 cents higher with
December at $2.30} a bushel; oats were { cent to 1 cent lower with
December at $1.23\ a bushel; soybeans were 2\ cents to 4\ cents
lower with November at $6.17} a bushel.

<HEAD>Broadest Measure of Money Supply Falls</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The broadest measure of the nation's money
supply fell in the week ended Sept. 24, while the second-broadest
measure grew slightly, the Federal Reserve Board reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 rose to a seasonally
adjusted $3,316.2 billion from $3,315.6 billion the previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, fell to a seasonally adjusted
$4,085.8 billion from $4,093.3 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose to a
seasonally adjusted $821.7 billion from $820.6 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   The growth rate in M2 in the past 52 weeks was 5 percent, which
is within the Fed's target range of 3 percent to 7 percent. The
growth rate in the past year in M3 was 1.8 percent, which is within
the Fed's target range of 1 percent to 5 percent. The Fed has not
set a target for M1 growth since early 1987.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3,299 billion, a 3 percent
seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous 13 weeks.
M3 averaged $4,083.4 billion, up 1.5 percent, while M1 rose 4.2
percent to an average of $815.2 billion.
   In other reports:
   - The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window, excluding extended credit,
averaged $503 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, down from
$513 million the previous week.
   - The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $318.4 billion in the two-week period ended
Wednesday, down from $318.8 billion two weeks earlier.

<HEAD>Black &amp; Decker Sells Four Emhart Divisions To Meet Debt Payments</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALEX DOMINGUEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tool and appliance giant Black &amp; Decker will
sell four divisions for $150 million in order to meet payments on
nearly $4 billion in debt taken on when it bought Emhart Corp.
   The company agreed to sell its True Temper Hardware division to
Huffy Corp. of Dayton, Ohio, for about $55 million, Huffy said
Thursday.
   In addition, Black &amp; Decker is selling its Medic division, the
medical computer system unit of Planning Research Corp., to a
management-led buyout group; and its domestic capacitors operation
to an investment group, Yosemite Investment Inc.
   The company announced Wednesday it had agreed to sell
GardenAmerica, which makes watering devices for lawns, for $40
million to James Hardie Industries Ltd. of Australia.
   The total sale price of all four divisions is expected to be
about $150 million, said the Towson, Md.-based company.
   ``We are pleased to announce another step in our program to
reduce our acquisition debt by $1 billion,'' Black &amp; Decker chief
executive officer Nolan Archibald said. ``When the proceeds of
these sales are applied, reductions will total approximately $700
million.''
   Black &amp; Decker bought Emhart Corp. last year with $3.8 billion
in borrowed money. Since then, the slumping economy has cut into
sales, leaving it strapped to make debt payments. Emhart is a
Farmington, Conn., maker of industrial and consumer products.
   Clifford Ransom, an analyst with Ferris, Baker Watts in
Baltimore, said the move is good news for Black &amp; Decker stock,
which has taken a beating.
   ``People have been concerned over delays in selling assets,''
Ransom said. ``This set of announcements indicates that program was
only delayed, not derailed. So it's good news.''
   Black &amp; Decker stock, which had traded as high as $24 in the
last year, closed down another 75 cents to $8.87{ Thursday, after
falling $1 the previous day.
   Black &amp; Decker was required to sell about $150 million in assets
by the end of the year as part of its bank loan agreement, Ransom
said.
   ``The valuations they're getting for these businesses look good,
although the details have been sketchy,'' Ransom said.
``GardenAmerica looks like it was (bought) at 13 times operating
income, which is good. True Temper looks like it's between eight or
nine times operating income. I would guess that's a pretty good
price.''
   The company also announced it had signed contracts to sell
certain properties in the United Kingdom and France.
   Earlier this year, Black &amp; Decker sold its Bostik adhesives
division for $345 million; its footwear materials division for $125
million; and the European operations of its Arcotronics capacitor
business for $80 million.

<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Czechoslovak government,
facing a winter of higher oil costs and dwindling Soviet supplies,
imposed higher oil and gasoline prices Thursday and appealed to
Moscow for help.
   Measures taken by a ''crisis team'' of government officials,
announced in a TV address by Economics Minister Vladimir Dlouhy,
are aimed at stemming a near panic about potential fuel shortages,
the state CTK news agency said.
   ``To make it simple, the main problem is that oil is much more
expensive now,'' Dlouhy said on national television.
   The Soviet Union, for years the main oil supplier in East bloc
countries, is unable to fulfill its quotas. At the same time, it
will begin demanding scarce convertible currency for its oil
beginning Jan. 1.
   Many of the countries have lost supplies of Iraqi oil because of
their support for the U.N. sanctions against Saddam Hussein, and
their fragile economies are facing much higher prices on the world
market.
   Elsewhere, Poland announced it would import oil from Iran to
make up for dwindling Soviet supplies and losses caused by the Gulf
crisis.
   Dlouhy estimated Czechoslovakia's loss because of the Gulf
crisis at about $1.4 billion.
   Beginning midnight Friday, Czechoslovak consumers will be
allowed to buy only about six gallons of gasoline in October at the
official price of about $3 a gallon. Additional gasoline will cost
about 25 percent more.
   Motor and heating oil will be increased from about $2.24 dollars
to $3 a gallon.
   New limits for November will be announced later, CTK said.
   Premier Marian Calfa appealed for urgent talks with Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Premier Nikolai I. Ryzkov on
faltering Soviet oil supplies.
   Soviet supplies began falling in the first half of the year, and
the shortfall led to a panic in July that forced the government to
drive up the price by 50 percent, CTK said.
   CTK quoted Finance Minister Vaclav Klaus as saying that he could
not rule out more changes in wholesale prices by the end of the
year.

<HEAD>Bankruptcy Judge Steps Down in Drexel Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal judge overseeing the Drexel Burnham
Lambert Group Inc. bankruptcy withdrew from the case Thursday
because he is considering a job at a law firm that has represented
a Drexel creditor.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Howard C. Buschman III said he was
stepping down from the bench after seven years to return to
better-paying private practice.
   Attorneys for Drexel and creditors said the departure would
delay proceedings while his replacement becomes familiar with the
largest collapse of a financial firm in Wall Street history.
   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Frank Conrad, who sits in Rutland, Vt.,
was named to take over the Drexel proceedings. Attorneys said
Conrad has indicated he will spend about two weeks per month in New
York on the case.
   Buschman, 46, was appointed to a 14-year term in 1983, but said
he had ``regretfully concluded that the financial needs of my
family will not permit me to continue to serve out the remainder of
the term to which I was appointed.''
   The judge said he was under consideration for a job at an
unidentified law firm that has represented a creditor in the Drexel
case but not filed any pleadings or argued in court before him.
   Buschman said that he was not required to disqualify himself
from the case and he was reluctant to burden another judge with the
case, but ``in an excess of caution I think it appropriate to
request that these cases be reassigned.''
   The judge also had presided over the Chapter 11 proceedings of
Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc.
   Buschman won praise from attorneys in the seven-month-old Drexel
case for his preparation, attention to detail and ability to
control often contentious proceedings.
   ``I'm sorry we're losing him,'' Alan Miller, an attorney for
Drexel, said. ``This has been a difficult case and I think he's
done a job of keeping it under control.''
   Attorneys said they expected delays in the case while Judge
Conrad digests the background of the bankruptcy proceedings to
date. ``You can't read a case and a file, you also have to
understand some of the dynamics that go into a decision,'' he said.
   ``It's a very complicated bankruptcy case with a number of
inter-relationships,'' said Barry Dichter, who represents a large
Drexel creditor. ``It will take a new judge some time to understand
the complexities.''
   Drexel filed for bankruptcy protection from creditors in
February in the aftermath of a junk bond market collapse and a
failure to recover from its guilty plea to federal securities
violations.
   Drexel still is liquidating its large securities portfolio and
drawing up, along with creditors, a reorganization plan.

<HEAD>Ford Gives UAW Contract Proposal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co. on Thursday gave the United Auto
Workers union a comprehensive proposal for a new national labor
contract that, according to one company official, mirrors the
contract reached with General Motors Corp.
   The union, which ratified a three-year agreement with GM late
last month, has insisted that the UAW-GM agreement serve as a model
for contracts with Ford and Chrysler Corp.
   Except for one provision on overtime pay, Ford isn't expected to
have trouble agreeing to a contract similar to GM's.
   ``I think probably Ford has fallen in line with that,'' said the
company official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The UAW agreements with the Big Three cover more than 450,000
active workers - about 300,000 at GM, about 100,000 at Ford and
about 60,000 at Chrysler.
   The GM-UAW agreement raises base wages by 3 percent in the first
year and includes lump-sum increases equal to 3 percent of base
wages in the second and third years. Cost-of-living protection on
wages would be maintained and retirees will receive more money.
   It guarantees income for employees laid off for more than 36
weeks during the life of the agreement and makes no changes in
health-care provisions.
   The pattern agreement also contains a new provision boosting the
penalty for excessive overtime worked in a week. Ford has been
using overtime much more liberally than the two other U.S.
automakers, and the union has suggested it be curtailed and the
company hire more workers.
   Neither company nor union officials would talk about specific
provisions of the proposal offered Thursday. They issued a joint
statement saying only that the proposal was delivered and that the
union was studying it.
   A union official, who also requested anonymity, said studying
the document and holding some meetings of bargaining subcommittees
would take negotiators into Thursday night.
   On Tuesday, UAW President Owen Bieber said he expected
negotiations with Ford could be completed by the end of the week.
Company Vice President Peter Pestillo said that was possible.
   After a contract is ratified by Ford workers, the union will
turn to Chrysler, where it faces an uncertain reception. The No. 3
automaker has said it may not be able to afford a contract similar
to the other autoworkers', but the union is expected to push for
the model agreement.

<HEAD>New Chip Trade Pact Proposal Would End Price Controls</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVE WILSTEIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American computer and semiconductor
makers, feuding for years over a computer chip trade agreement with
Japan, announced a new trade plan Thursday that could bring lower
prices to consumers.
   The proposed pact, which industry leaders said received an
encouraging response from Bush administration officials, would end
price controls on imported memory chips and remove an irritant in
U.S.-Japanese relations.
   The proposal for a new 5-year agreement to succeed the 1986
U.S.-Japan Semiconductor Trade Agreement, set to expire next July
31, marks the first time chipmakers and computer makers have joined
to achieve the same trade policy.
   U.S. Chipmakers pushed for the 1986 agreement to stop Japanese
companies from ``dumping'' unfairly priced memory chips in the
United States. But U.S. computer makers complained the agreement
kept prices high for a key component of their products.
   If the new pact is adopted, it could bring down the cost of
memory devices and be a bonanza for consumers and computer makers,
analysts said.
   Top executives of both industries, represented by the
Semiconductor Industry Association, a trade group, and the Computer
Systems Policy Project worked for months on the new proposal.
   The computer group, founded last year, includes the chief
executives of International Business Machines Corp.,
Hewlett-Packard Co., Apple Computer Inc., Sun Microsystems Inc.,
Tandem Computers Inc., Compaq Computer Corp. and five other
companies.
   Wilfred Corrigan, chief executive officer of LSI Logic Corp. and
chairman of the semiconductor group, said in Washington that the
proposal is ``based on the premise that open markets and the
availability of semiconductors at reasonable prices will promote
the health of the U.S. electronics industry, foster better
relations between the U.S. and Japan, and allow market forces to
function freely.''
   Rod Canion, chief executive officer of Compaq and vice chairman
of the computer group, said it is important that both groups speak
with ``a united voice'' on issues of high-tech trade.
   Industry analysts praised the two sides for putting aside their
differences.
   ``The fact that they can speak with one voice to Congress and
the administration is very significant,'' said Marc Elliot of
Dataquest Inc. in San Jose. ``I think you'll see a lot more
cooperation out of the Bush administration because of that.''
   Instead of using ``fair market values'' to determine the prices
at which Japanese chips are sold in the United States, the proposal
calls for ``fast track'' investigations by the Commerce Department
of dumping allegations.
   ``Anything that takes away from the fair market value and that
level of accountability is going to be favorably looked on by the
Japanese,'' Elliot said. ``They consider themselves to be honorable
people who don't need to be treated like children. I think that's
what this trade policy did. I think it will ease some of the
animosity that has existed.''
   The proposal acknowledges the success of the current trade
agreement and lawsuits in getting Japanese companies to stop
dumping, and urges less government involvement. It calls for a halt
in an investigation into dumping of memory chips called DRAMs.
   ``This proposal is very promising in that it focuses on the real
issue, which is access to the Japanese market,'' said Michael
Murphy, editor of the California Technology Stock Letter.
   The proposal seeks to boost the U.S. share of overall
semiconductor sales in Japan to 20 percent by the end of 1992, and
calls for review of further targets in 1993.
   ``When the original trade agreement was signed, the U.S. had
about 10 percent of the Japanese (semiconductor) market, and they
had about 10 percent of our market,'' Murphy said. ``Now we have
about 11 percent of their market and they have about 17 percent of
ours. So the original agreement actually caused the problem, in my
view.''
   One of the problems, he said, is that about 20 percent of U.S.
chip production is for military devices that the Japanese don't
need, and about 40 percent of Japan's demand is for cheap chips for
consumer products, which U.S. chip companies aren't interested in
making.
   ``So by the time you exclude military and consumer chips, you
wind up with a relatively small area in which we make chips that
they use,'' he said.
   The biggest beneficiaries in the semiconductor industry, he
said, would be the U.S. companies that make standard
microprocessors, such as Texas Instruments Inc., LSI Logic and
Chips &amp; Technologies Inc.

   Pipeline companies that allegedly
profited illegally from higher natural gas prices in the early
1980s agreed Thursday to a $432 million settlement in an antitrust
suit brought by utilities.
   Consumers should get 100 percent of the settlement after legal
costs, probably in the form of credits on their bills and lower
rates, according to the attorneys general of Missouri and Kansas.
   The settlement also includes a guarantee of natural gas for the
next 20 years at what is expected to be lower than market rates,
said Attorneys General William Webster of Missouri and Bob Stephan
of Kansas in announcing the settlement.
   Agreeing to the settlement were Amoco Production Co., Oxy USA,
Inc. and Williams Natural Gas Co.
   Amoco and Oxy had settled a week ago, but details of the
agreement were not released because of a gag order issued by U.S.
District Judge Earl O'Connor.
   The case against Williams then went to trial. The parties
negotiated until 4 a.m. Thursday, cleaned up details later in the
morning, and O'Connor dismissed the case late in the morning.
   None of the defendants admitted liability in the settlement.
   Oxy said in a statement released late Thursday its share of the
settlement comes to $24.5 million. Amoco and Williams would not
disclose the amounts they agreed to pay.
   ``Irrespective of one's feelings regarding the merit of our
position, you reach a point where it makes more sense to put the
issue behind you and turn your attention to the business at hand.
This is such a time,'' said Joseph H. Williams, chairman and chief
executive officer of Tulsa, Okla.-based Williams.
   Details of the plan must be approved by the Missouri Public
Service Commission and the Kansas Corporation Commission.
   The case was taken to court starting in 1984 by utilities and
the states. The suits, which alleged antitrust violations from 1979
to 1984, were then consolidated.

   Oil prices eased back Thursday, reflecting what
trading professionals called a temporary respite from the wild
swinging on the futures market.
   ``There's a definite feel of being in the eye of a hurricane,''
said Peter Beutel, an oil analyst with Pegasus Econometric Group
Inc. in Hoboken, N.J.
   Light sweet crude oil fell 39 cents to $36.93 per barrel on the
New York Mercantile Exchange for November delivery contracts.
   Unleaded wholesale gasoline fell 2.28 cents to 90.86 cents a
gallon on November contracts, while wholesale home heating oil rose
.51 cent to 99.92 cents a gallon for November contracts.
   Later contract months were lower for crude, mostly lower for
gasoline and higher for heating oil.
   The lackluster trading followed drops in crude prices totaling
more than $5 per barrel early in the week and a rally of more than
$3 per barrel on Wednesday.
   Traders said they were taking things easy through Thursday's
session while waiting to see what Iraq might say during a scheduled
evening address to the United Nations, that was eventually canceled
because of a nose bleed suffered by the Iraqi ambassador.
   ``We're really not going anywhere right now,'' said Ed Kevelson,
a trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   The Iraqi U.N. ambassador, Abdul Amir al-Andari, had been
expected to respond to President Bush's suggestion Monday that an
unconditional Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait could lead to
``opportunities'' toward a broad Middle East peace settlement.
   Traders had said a more conciliatory stance from Iraq could send
prices even lower, while more saber-rattling could push them back
up.
   Oil's sharp decline early in the week seemed to strip away the
``war premium'' that had elevated crde futures to new heights as
speculators bet that hostilities in the Gulf could lead to supply
shortages. Thursday's trading failed to sustain the rally from
Wednesday, making buyers reluctant to get into the uncertain
market.
   Natural gas fell 1.7 cents to $1.898 per 1,000 cubic feet on
November contracts, with most other contracts closing higher.

<HEAD>Trump Files Payment Plan For Taj Mahal Subcontractors With SEC</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A plan to repay more than $54 million
in overdue bills to subcontractors who worked on Donald Trump's Taj
Mahal Casino Resort was filed Thursday with the federal Securities
and Exchange Commission.
   The casino said it had already paid $15 million in cash and
would pay another on $3.2 million in cash by Oct. 15 for
construction work on the mammoth casino, which cost $1 billion to
build.
   In addition, the casino pledged $36.4 million in notes that will
come due on Aug. 15, 1995. The notes bear 8 percent interest in the
fourth year and 10 percent in the fifth year, according to the
filing.
   At least four subcontractors who did not go along with the deal
have gone to court to enforce payment from the Manhattan developer.
   The Taj Mahal, which opened amid much hoopla on April 2, has not
taken in the $1.3 million a day that analysts have said it needs to
break even. Parts of the property remain unfinished.
   The state Casino Control Commission must approve the plan to
repay the subcontractors. The commission has scheduled hearings
Oct. 30 to examine the financial stability of the Taj Mahal and
Trump's other two casinos.

   The United Steelworkers union is focusing on
getting back wage concessions its members made in the early 1980s
as the union prepares for the start of talks with USX Corp.
   The union will ask USX to raise pay $1.25 an hour, Andrew
``Lefty'' Palm, District 15 director and chairman of the USX
negotiating committee, said Thursday.
   Union members at USX make an average of $10.84 an hour,
excluding benefits, USW officials said.
   The USW, representing 18,000 members at USX mines and mills in
seven states, opens talks with the nation's largest steelmaker Oct.
15. A four-year contract expires Feb. 1.
   ``We're only asking to go back to what we made in 1982,'' Palm
said at a news conference at a Hilton hotel in suburban Moon
Township.
   Bethlehem Steel Corp., National Steel Corp., Armco Inc. and two
financially ailing steelmakers, Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp. and
LTV Steel Co., all agreed to reinstate pay concessions, Palm said.
   ``The key word, gang, is pattern plus,'' he said. ``The pattern
is out there, and they know what it is. All the companies that
signed up to the pattern still are making money.''
   USX Chairman Charles A. Corry and Thomas J. Usher, president of
USX's steel division, have said the company will stand alone in the
talks, ignoring agreements struck with competitors.
   Statements from both the union and USX said negotiations were
scheduled to end Nov. 10.
   The talks are beginning 3{ months before the contract's
expiration, 1{ months earlier than in previous years. The USX
statement did not explain the additional time, but Palm speculated
the company was pressured by its customers into settling the
contract early.
   Palm said the union will ask USX to pay a penalty into an
industry fund for retraining workers if the company schedules
excessive overtime. The other steelmakers have accepted the
penalty, he said.
   Union leaders began two days of talks Thursday with presidents
and other officials of locals at USX operations. The officials will
return to the plants for two weeks of ironing out local issues
before returning Oct. 29 for the companywide contract.

<HEAD>Frequent Flyers File Suits Saying American Airlines Breached
Settlement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENDA C. COLEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHAMPAIGN, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thirteen American Airlines customers are
seeking more than $45 million in two lawsuits alleging the company
reneged on an agreement to honor its obligations under the
frequent-flyer program.
   The lawsuits, filed Tuesday in Champaign County Circuit Court,
both accuse American of breach of contract, fraud and violating
federal racketeering law.
   Tom Stack, a spokesman in Chicago for Dallas-based American,
said Thursday the company had not seen the lawsuits and could not
comment on them.
   American has responded to the flyers' complaints previously that
they had violated the rules of the program, called ``AAdvantage,''
by transferring and selling mileage credits.
   One lawsuit, comprising 49 counts on behalf of eight frequent
flyers, says American has failed to honor a settlement it reached
with the flyers after they filed a series of consumer fraud
complaints with the Illinois attorney general in 1988.
   In the settlement, American said it would let the flyers and
others use the credits they had earned under the frequent flyer
program, according to the lawsuit.
   The lawsuit seeks $650,000 in actual damages and $10 million in
punitive damages. Punitive damages could be tripled under the
federal Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, also
called RICO, said the plaintiffs' attorney, Jeffrey Frederick.
   The second lawsuit, comprising 32 counts on behalf of five
plaintiffs, alleges that American failed to honor tickts earned by
frequent flyers who were not part of the settlement agreement,
Frederick said Thursday.
   That lawsuit seeks $100,000 in actual damages and $5 million in
punitive damages.
   ``There's got to be some changes in all these programs because
no one really knows what's going on, and the airlines are changing
the rules at their own whim,'' said Frederick.
   He said the lawsuits were filed in Champaign for the convenience
for many of the plaintiffs who live nearby and for himself.
   American forced a newlywed couple to cancel their honeymoon
plans by refusing to honor their frequent flyer credit on reserved
flights to New York and on the Concorde to London, the second
lawsuit alleged. Frederick said reservations had been confirmed the
day before.
   He said customers also typically were allowed to fly to a
distant destination - such as Hawaii - on frequent flyer credit,
only to have the airline refuse to honor their return-trip tickets.
The customers then were forced to pay full fare to get home,
Frederick said.
   Like many other airlines, American has been the target of
previous lawsuits on behalf of angry frequent flyers who claimed
the airlines were failing to live up to their promises.
   One of the lawsuits, a 2-year-old class action on behalf of 9
million American Airlines customers, is pending in Illinois
appellate court, said Gilbert Gordon, an attorney for the
plaintiffs in Chicago.
