<HEAD>Federal Judge Orders Temporary Halt to State's Drug Testing</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal judge Friday ordered Georgia to stop
mandatory drug testing for job applicants until he holds another
hearing on a lawsuit contending the state's new drug testing law is
unconstitutional.
   U.S. District Judge Robert Hall granted a request for a
temporary restraining order that will allow Atlanta lawyer Ed
Martin to take a job with the state Department of Human Resources
without undergoing the test.
   The lawsuit opposing the drug testing law, which took effect
July 1, was filed by the Georgia Association of Educators, Martin
and two teachers. The plaintiffs contend the law violates state job
applicants' constitutional guarantee of privacy.
   Hall scheduled a hearing on a request for a preliminary
injunction in the case for Aug. 16 and 17, and ordered testing of
all state job applicants halted until then.
   Michael Kramer, an attorney for the association, argued that the
new law is too sweeping because it requires testing for all state
job applicants, from teachers to maintenance workers.
   Under the law, anyone refusing to submit to the test or testing
positive for drugs would be banned from public employment for two
years, and their names would be placed on a state list for an
indefinite period of time.
   Association attorneys estimated that 1,500 applicants have
submitted to the drug tests since July 1.
   Martin found the idea of submitting to the test ``deeply
offensive,'' Kramer said.
   Kramer also argued that Martin, who has been offered a legal job
in the Department of Human Resources' Office of Regulatory
Services, which oversees nursing homes, posed no risk to the state
and should not be required to take the test.
   The state passed the new law ``to make a statement,'' Kramer
said. ``They have no evidence there was any need for this
across-the-board testing.''
   Senior Assistant Attorney General Wayne Yancey argued that the
drug testing law is necessary, especially for teachers who ``are
the frontlines in trying to educate the students and stop use of
drugs.''
   ``We don't need to have the public work force to be the haven
for all drug users in the state of Georgia,'' Yancey said.
   Martin said he was pleased with the judge's ruling. ``I couldn't
see where they had a right to do that to people,'' he said of state
legislators who approved the law. ``I had to take a stand.''
   The other two plaintiffs in the Atlanta lawsuit are Mary Smith,
a six-year teacher who did not teach during the 1989-1990 school
year and wants to return to the classroom, and Richard Schmidt, who
has applied for science teaching jobs.
   In granting the temporary restraining order, Hall said a 1989
ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court cannot be used to uphold all parts
of the Georgia law.
   In that case, the high court approved tests for U.S. Customs
Service workers after the government contended drug use by workers
in sensitive jobs could make them likely targets of bribery or
blackmail.

   Louisiana Insurance Commissioner Doug
Green and his wife and brother entered innocent pleas Thursday to
charges they took bribes to keep a floundering insurance company
from going under.
   The trio was indicted by a grand jury in East Baton Rouge Parish
on June 28.
   Doug Green is accused of accepting bribes from Champion
Insurance Co. officials while he was a candidate for the
commissioner's post in 1987, with an eye toward helping the company
stay alive once he took office.
   The second count in the state indictment charged that while
Green was in he and his wife, Linn, and brother, Donald accepted or
offered to accept bribes to influence Green's conduct.
   Judge L. J. Hymel set bond at $25,000 for each of the three, and
they were booked and released.
   Hymel said he would set a trial date in September. Green also
faces federal charges stemming from the Champion scandal.
   Champion failed on June 5, 1989, more than a year after Green
took office. The company left unpaid claims in Louisiana estimated
at between $150 million and $180 million, a debt that will be
covered by state taxpayers under Louisiana's insurance system.
Champion was the third-largest automobile insurer in the state.
   The company also left an estimated $45 million in claims in
Alabama and an undetermined amount in Tennessee.
   Champion owner John Eicher Jr., his son Naaman and other members
of their family already have pleaded guilty to various federal
charges stemming from the Champion failure.

   Things have been looking up for John Baron since
flamboyant developer Donald Trump disclosed his favorite alias _
John Baron.
   Baron's mother calls him ``The John,'' he says his children look
at him with new respect and his business partners toyed with the
idea of renaming their management consulting firm Greenberg, Trump,
Simon &amp; Miller.
   Trump acknowledged during testimony in a civil lawsuit in New
York last week that he has used the name John Baron on occasion.
   In a letter dated Wednesday, Baron wrote Trump that use of the
alias has ``my mother very proud.''
   ``I ask only that you consider inviting my mother, the estimable
Betty Baron, to lunch in New York as a way of thanking her. After
all, it was she who came up with the name by which we both have
prospered,'' he wrote.

<HEAD>AP Speeds Up PhotoStream and Picture Desk Schedules</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Associated Press will accelerate
implementation of its PhotoStream network and installation of the
AP Leaf Picture Desks, aiming at completing the nationwide program
by the end of 1991, a year earlier than previously announced.
   AP President Louis D. Boccardi said Thursday the decision to
attempt to speed up the installation schedule was made in response
to encouragement from AP member newspapers to put the news agency's
new photo system in place as soon as possible.
   Installations of PhotoStream and the AP Leaf Picture Desks will
start in September in New York, the state in which AP will save the
most money by switching from land-line transmission to satellite
delivery of pictures.
   Installations will start in October in other northeastern
states. In February 1991, installations will commence
simultaneously in the three other divisions of the AP's domestic
photo service _ Southeast, Central and West.
   Within each region, AP teams will be working in more than one
state at a time, but the general order for installations is
determined by where the greatest savings can be made to help pay
for the program.
   The original timetable had called for a 28-month implementation
schedule. ``But development of hardware and software has proceeded
at a pace that indicates we should attempt to accomplish this
enormous task in 16 months,'' Boccardi said.
   The pace of progress on the installations will depend on several
factors, including site preparation, newsroom training and
decisions by newspaper executives on how they wish to integrate the
AP Leaf Picture Desk with their production systems, Boccardi said.
   ``We anticipate that the pace of installations will grow as AP
and the members gain familiarity with what happens when the Leaf
Desk arrives in the newsroom,'' Boccardi said. ``AP expects to make
30 installations by the end of 1990 and the rest through 1991.''
   He said that the AP would give its members at least a quarterly
update on the progress of the installation program.
   AP's U.S. photo network is divided into four regions with
headquarters bureaus in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and
Washington.
   In addition to the land-line savings, the northeastern region is
the first to begin conversion because of its proximity to AP's
photo and computer headquarters in New York, AP's technical center
in New Jersey and Leaf Systems Inc. in Massachusetts. Leaf Systems
is the company that produces the AP Leaf Picture Desk.
   The New York region states, in order of installations, are: New
York, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New Jersey, Maine,
Vermont, New Hampshire and Connecticut.
   Installation will begin simultaneously in the other three
regions in February 1991 in this general order:
   Chicago region: Texas, Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Iowa,
Nebraska, South Dakota, North Dakota, Minnesota, Illinois, Kansas,
Missouri, Wisconsin, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Colorado and Wyoming.
   Los Angeles region: California, Nevada, Oregon, Washington,
Arizona, New Mexico, Idaho, Montana, Utah, Alaska and Hawaii.
   Washington, D.C., region: Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee,
Alabama, Georgia, Florida, North Carolina, West Virginia, Virginia,
South Carolina, Maryland and Delaware.
   Additional photo editors will be hired for the four control
bureaus to edit and transmit pictures from bureaus and newspapers
in the states under their jurisdiction. Additional staff also will
be hired to install the darkrooms and train member newspaper
staffs. Technical training for the AP staff has begun and a member
training program is being designed. In addition, AP will set up a
full-time Help Desk to assist members with the changeover.
   In the present analog photo network, black and white pictures
are transmitted in about nine minutes and color pictures in 30
minutes. When fully implemented, PhotoStream will allow digital
delivery of black and white pictures in one minute each and color
pictures in three minutes.
   The AP also announced that it would use the AP Leaf Picture Desk
for its internal photo computer system and would discontinue
development and marketing of the AP VAX Picture Desk, which runs on
Digital Equipment Corp. computers.
   ``The AP Leaf Picture Desk exceeds our expectations in power,
speed and functionality,'' said John Reid, AP vice president and
director of communications and technology. ``Work on new features
is proceeding rapidly. Members attending ANPA-TEC saw the
difference and demonstrated an overwhelming preference for the
Leaf.''
   If an AP member newspaper does not want an AP Leaf Picture Desk,
it may elect to keep its present photo receiver or accept a
two-minute receiver. Or it may choose to buy an electronic darkroom
from another company, in which case AP will provide that member
with a rebate of $47 weekly for five years, effective on the date
the member would have received its AP Leaf Picture Desk.
   The present photo receiver will be left in place at sites where
an AP Leaf Picture Desk is installed.
   Members receiving an AP Leaf Picture Desk and PhotoStream will
be assessed a surcharge of between $15 and $80 weekly, depending on
circulation.

<HEAD>Brando's Daughter Subpoenaed in Tahiti to Testify in Killing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Marlon Brando's daughter was served with a
subpoena in Tahiti to testify against her half-brother, who is
charged with killing her boyfriend, authorities said Thursday.
   It was not immediately clear whether Cheyenne Brando will return
to Los Angeles in time for Monday's hearing for 32-year-old
Christian Brando. An American diplomat served the notice to her in
Papeete on Wednesday.
   Miss Brando, 20, left for French Polynesia after refusing to
testify against her half-brother, who is accused of the May 16
shooting death of Dag Drollet at her father's estate in the Santa
Monica mountains.
   The case is complicated by reports that authorities in Tahiti
filed a complaint allowing them to question Miss Brando in the
killing and that she was forbidden to leave French Polynesia for
the time being.
   Further clouding the matter is that Miss Brando is believed to
hold both American and French passports.
   Sandi Gibbons, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County district
attorney's office, said that extradition procedures would be
unnecessary in any case because Miss Brando is wanted by Los
Angeles authorities as a witness, not as a suspect.
   Drollet, the father of Miss Brando's unborn child, was gunned
down at Marlon Brando's estate. The actor was home at the time of
the slaying, but he was elsewhere in the house and did not see it.
   Christian Brando reportedly told police that Drollet died during
a struggle over a gun.
   Miss Brando, a native of the South Pacific islands, is the
daughter of Brando and his current wife, Tarita Teriipia. Miss
Teriipia is the Tahitian actress who played his love interest in
the 1962 remake of ``Mutiny on the Bounty.''
   Miss Brando returned to French Polynesia eight months pregnant
with the child of her slain boyfriend. She gave birth and is now in
a Tahitian hospital undergoing treatment for nervous exhaustion.
   Marlon Brando maintains a home in Tahiti.

   The dedication of former president Richard
Nixon's presidential library prompted protesters to show up
Thursday, but not in the numbers known when he was the nation's
37th chief executive.
   Hundreds of noisy, clamoring demonstrators gathered Thursday
evening outside the Los Angeles Century Plaza Hotel, where Nixon
loyalists gathered for a gala black tie dinner.
   ``Heil, heil, the gang's all here,'' said one sign. ``Republican
Leaders Fail People With AIDS,'' said another. ``Stop the U.S. War
In El Salvador,'' said one other.
   A girl who appeared to be no older than 16 laid down in the
middle of the street in the midst of about 50 policeman with billy
clubs at the ready. The girl was wearing a sign that said, ``I died
in the streets of Los Angeles homeless.''
   Suddenly, without apparent provocation, three policeman rolled
her on her stomach and cuffed her hands behind her back. A few
minutes later, she was put aboard a police bus, loaded with what
appeared to be a dozen or more people.
   Meanwhile, the party goers walked under the bridge on which the
demonstrators were standing, few of them looking back. But some of
the guests in the hotel sat on their balconies watching the scene
below.
   At the dedication of the Nixon library earlier in the day,
dozens of protesters registered objections to the former president
and also criticized President Bush's handling of policy for AIDS
victims.
   Two were ejected from the site of the dedication ceremonies in
Nixon's home town of suburban Yorba Linda.
   Outside the library on Yorba Linda Boulevard, people waved signs
saying ``He's still Tricky Dick,'' and ``Richard Repent.''

   Queen Mother Elizabeth sang with gusto at a gala
celebrating her 90th birthday that included actors Michael Caine,
Roger Moore and Howard Keel and singer Placido Domingo.
   The show Thursday night at the London Palladium highlighted the
changing face of entertainment throughout the queen mother's nine
decades, from the Edwardian music hall to pop music and the hit
musical ``Phantom of the Opera.''
   The 2,298-seat theater was packed and millions of Britons are
expected to watch the gala when it is shown on BBC-TV on Aug. 4,
the queen mother's birthday.
   A Noel Coward sequence was introduced by Sir John Mills, who
reminded the queen mother that her ``great friend'' would also have
been 90 this year. ``And I know he would have wanted to have been
the first to salute you,'' Mills said.
   The queen mother sang along enthusiastically with Bernie Winters
and Leslie Crowther when they re-enacted Flanagan and Allen
routines ``Underneath the Arches'' and ``Strolling.''
   After the show, she told Winters, who was a great favorite of
her late husband King George VI: ``I had a little weep. The show
brought back some very happy memories of my late husband.''
   Placido Domingo flew in from Austria where he is rehearsing for
the Salzburg Festival to sing an aria from ``Tosca,'' and ``You Are
My Heart's Delight.''
   Howard Keel interrupted rehearsals for ``Dallas'' in the United
States to recreate the part he originally played at the Theater
Royal Drury Lane in 1947 _the cowman Curly in the musical
``Oklahoma.''
   Dame Kiri Te Kanawa sang both opera and songs from ``My Fair
Lady'' and Michael Caine and Roger Moore hammed away as a pair of
top-hatted punters in the musical's Ascot scene seeking a tip from
the ``one person who knows more about racing than anyone.''
   The queen mother, wearing pale green and gold and a diamond
tiara, was flanked by her daughters, Queen Elizabeth II and
Princess Margaret.
   The two-hour show ended with the whole cast led by Dame Kiri
singing a special birthday song composed by Carl Davis _ ``The Most
Wonderful Birthday of All'' _ and director Sir Richard Attenborough
calling for three rousing cheers.
   Eleven service and allied charities are to share the nearly $2
million expected to be raised.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of the world's endangered plants,
from tiny Indonesian orchids to the giant saguaro cactus of
Arizona, have found a home in a cluster of government-run
greenhouses where they are nursed back from the brink of extinction.
   ``We keep the Noah's Ark of the plant world,'' said Rob
Pennington, superintendent of collections at the U.S. Botanic
Garden's 20-acre Poplar Point Nursery in southeast Washington.
   Among the 25,000 plants that flourish in the nursery's two dozen
greenhouses on the Anacostia River banks are about 3,000 rare and
exotic specimens seized by customs officials at U.S. ports of entry.
   The plants were removed from import shipments that violated the
Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, a
multinational accord that forbids trafficking in a long list of
endangered plants and animals without strict certification.
   Diseased plants are destroyed immediately. The others are sent
to 15 government ``plant rescue stations'' around the country,
including Poplar Point, where they are nurtured and bred for
scientific study and display at botanical gardens.
   The Botanic Garden, established by Congress in 1821, also grows
plants at Poplar Point to landscape the Capitol and adjacent
federal buildings and for seasonal floral displays at its
conservatory, a formal greenhouse on the Mall at the foot of
Capitol Hill.
   There are no man-eating plants in Pennington's collections, but
there are extremely rare specimens of Encephalaratos lehmannii
cyads from the desert region of Africa. These primitive, palm-like
plants survived the dinosaur era because of their toxic trunk and
roots. For centuries, they have poisoned human beings who beat the
pulp into bread flour.
   Poplar Point also acquired hundreds of Javanicum Tortipelatum, a
small, endangered orchid from Indonesia, from a grower's shipment
that was confiscated in Los Angeles. They had spent six weeks in
boxes without light or water. Pennington said it's a miracle that
many managed to survive.
   Domestically, the greenhouse is the last refuge of a ``sneeze
weed'' that the state of Virginia spent 30 years trying to
eradicate. Also here is the insect-gobbling Saracenia Oreophila
plant, now nearly extinct in its natural habitat along the Carolina
and Gulf Coast shores.
   Poplar Point also is salvaging a majestic saguaro cactus of
Arizona, once commonplace as a travel poster symbol of the arid
Southwest until it was nearly bulldozed into oblivion by land
developers.
   Pennington delights visiting school children with tales about
his Pittosporum boninensis, a nondescript shrub that's nearly
extinct on its native island of Chichi Jima in the Pacific Ocean. A
cannibal supposedly lived there at one time.
   Chichi Jima became a footnote in the history books when George
Bush, a young Navy pilot who later became president, ditched his
crippled plane a few miles offshore after a bombing run against
Japanese forces in World War II.
   ``I tell the kids that the cannibal used to hide in this
shrubbery waiting to eat downed pilots, and that George Bush
escaped with his life,'' Pennington said with a laugh. ``When you
have a plant this plain and ugly, you have to think of something to
tell them.''
   Pennington, 36, a horticulturist trained in plant pathology,
said the biggest threat to the world's tropical plants comes from
runaway population growth. More and more people means destruction
of forests and vast amounts of foliage for food, housing and
commercial development.
   ``These plants are endangered because they no longer have a home
when their environment is removed,'' he said. ``We provide a home
for wayward plants, you might say.''

<HEAD>Muslim Candidates Exploring Political Mainstream</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BLADENSBURG, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Like Douglas Wilder in 1989 and Andrew
Young this year, Abdul Alim Muhammad is waging an uphill battle for
political office. Like them he is black. But there is a difference.
   There is nothing colorblind about Muhammad's campaign for
Congress. He is the candidate of the Nation of Islam, the
fundamentalist Muslim organization long regarded as a bastion of
black separatism.
   This year, for the first time, the group headed by Louis
Farrakhan is exploring the political mainstream, running three
candidates with its official endorsement.
   ``It is highly likely this is not the last time we are going to
be involved in electoral politics,'' Muhammad said in an interview
at his storefront campaign headquarters in Maryland's Prince
George's County just outside Washington.
   The other two candidates are George Cure, a legal adviser to the
Nation of Islam who is running for the District of Columbia's
non-voting delegate seat in Congress, and Shawn Brakeen, a
schoolteacher candidate for the district's school board.
   The Muslim movement has espoused racial separation since it
began nearly 60 years ago, but Muhammad said, ``We have never been
isolated. We believe that where we are dominant in numbers we
should have a position of leadership that is representative of our
numbers.''
   ``My objective in Congress will be to inspire and organize and
secure resources ... so that Prince George's County will be a
shining light, an example of what highly motivated blacks can do to
pull themselves up by their own bootstraps, so to speak,'' said
Muhammad.
   Farrakhan has been criticized for making comments offensive to
Jews and other ethnic groups, but he said recently that the Muslim
candidates would represent all people, regardless of their ``race,
creed or color.''
   The emergence of Nation of Islam candidates comes amid growing
black prominence in American politics.
   Wilder, the former Virginia lieutenant governor, became the
nation's first elected black governor last year after successfully
courting both black and white voters.
   Young, a civil rights leader and former mayor of Atlanta,
finished second in Georgia's Democratic gubernatorial primary on
Tuesday and faces a runoff Aug. 7 against Lt. Gov. Zell Miller.
Some black leaders have criticized Young for running a colorblind
campaign in an effort to woo white support in a state where about
22 percent of the registered voters are black.
   Muhammad said it was understandable for Wilder and Young to
reach out to white voters, but he said such ``crossover''
politicians do not provide the same leadership for the black
community as would a ``black leader.''
   ``Andy Young can't win with the black vote in Atlanta,'' he
said. ``He needs some of the rural white vote. To win at least some
of those voters he has to be what is called a crossover candidate.
   ``Blacks have to understand that it is possible for blacks to be
leaders in that sense. But they should not expect from this kind of
crossover politician the kind of thing you would expect from a
black leader.''
   ``Doug Wilder has become governor of all the people of Virginia,
but he should not be mistaken for a black leader who is going to do
very much to correct the wrongs in the black community,'' he said.
   Muhammad, 42, a surgeon who is Farrakhan's spokesman, is running
in the Sept. 11 primary against Steny Hoyer, chairman of the House
Democratic caucus. Hoyer, 50, has represented Maryland's 5th
Congressional District for four terms and is strongly favored for
re-election.
   The district, which includes most of Prince George's County, is
about evenly divided between black and white, with the black
population increasing.
   As almost all candidates do, Muhammad said he expects to win.
   Hoyer, however, has a strong lead in fundraising, having raised
$453,000 for his campaign before he announced. Muhammad has been
raising funds among blacks in the Washington area as well as in
Philadelphia and other cities.
   Muhammad declined to say how much had been raised but said the
campaign had been advised it need not file with the Federal

   A crude incendiary device has been sent to
Princess Diana at Buckingham Palace, Scotland Yard said.
   The palace's security system spotted it Thursday within minutes
and anti-terrorist squad officers took it away for forensic
examination, a police statement said.
   ``It must be emphasized that this crude incendiary device was
not a bomb and did not originate from any terrorist organization,''
the statement said.
   Police sources said it was believed the work of ``a crank.''
   Scotland Yard said no member of the royal family was ever at
risk in the incident.
   The device was contained in a package addressed to the Princess
of Wales and delivered to Buckingham Palace Thursday morning, the
statement said.
   It is not known where the princess was when the package arrived.
She and her husband, Prince Charles, live about a mile away at
Kensington Palace when they are in London.
   Diana kept to her official schedule and visited a center for the
elderly in southwest London Thursday morning.

<HEAD>Salmonella Bacteria Turning Up in U.S. Eggs</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: Lead prospects uncertain</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Last year, a healthy 40-year-old man died from
severe dehydration brought on by food poisoning blamed on the eggs
in a meringue pie.
   Twenty-one guests at a baby shower in New York became ill after
eating an undercooked pasta dish made with raw eggs.
   Six people developed the same infection after eating homemade
ice cream made with eggs in Illinois.
   The guilty bacteria, salmonella enteritidis or SE, is turning up
in more and more eggs around the country and beginning to alarm the
egg industry, public health officials, agricultural community and
Congress.
   The House Energy and Commerce subcommittee on oversight and
investigations was hearing today what the Agriculture Department is
doing to stem its spread.
   ``The World Health Organization has characterized SE as an
international epidemic,'' said a memo from the panel, chaired by
Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich. ``In the United Kingdom, where the issue
of SE resulted in the resignation of the minister of health, the
existence of the Phase 4 SE strain has plagued the European egg
industry and the health ministries.''
   This particularly virulent strain has not spread in the United
States, although isolated incidents have been reported in Canada
and health officials here are worried, the memo said.
   Before 1979, only cracked eggs were believed to be likely
carriers of the bacteria. Now it is believed that it comes from the
hen's ovaries and can exist in the egg's yolk, according to the
federal Centers for Disease Control.
   ``In 1982, the CDC confronted the first outbreak of
egg-associated salmonella enteritidis in a restaurant in Boston's
Logan Airport,'' said the memo from Dingell's committee.
   ``Although the CDC suspected that there may be a problem with
this little-known strain of salmonella, it was not until 1986 that
the CDC became convinced that the theory of bacterial transmission
in an intact egg via the yolk was plausible.''
   From 1985 through October 1989, a total of 6,604 illnesses and
43 deaths were blamed on the bacteria. Last year, there were 2,394
illnesses and 14 deaths and in the last six months there have been
450 cases of illness but no deaths, according to CDC statistics.
   The problem so far has been the worst in the Northeastern
states, although it has shown up across the country.
   How worried should you be?
   Cooking expert Julia Child said it's a little like playing
Russian roulette, but she protects herself by knowing where her
eggs are produced.
   ``I eat eggs all the time, but I'm very careful where I buy
them,'' Child said in a telephone interview from her home in
Massachusetts.
   Her advice to consumers is to make sure their eggs are
refrigerated from the time they are laid until they are eaten.
   ``If the eggs have been refrigerated, the danger is low you will
have a problem,'' she said, advising that consumers leave the eggs
in the box when they refrigerate them at home. The egg containers
on refrigerator doors don't keep eggs as cold, she said.
   Eggs must be cooked at 140 degrees to kill the salmonella,
according to Child. That's more heat than is needed for scrambled
or poached eggs, for example.
   The very old, very young and very sick are the most vulnerable
to death from the eggborne salmonella.
   ``In Pennsylvania, six nursing home patients died after eating
stuffing that contained undercooked eggs,'' said the Dingell
committee memo. ``Eleven died and 512 were sickened in a New York
hospital after being served contaminated eggs from Maryland.''
   The states and United Egg Producers are seeking action from the
Agriculture Department, which is looking into the situation along
with the Food and Drug Administration.

<HEAD>Poland Complains of Restrictions on Visitors To Soviet City</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has protested
anti-profiteering measures in a Soviet city near the Polish border
that bar foreign visitors from taking home scarce goods.
   The Polish Foreign Ministry will send a delegation to Lvov, 50
miles east of the border, to ``discuss the liquidation of these
restrictions,'' government spokeswoman Malgorzata Niezabitowska
said Thursday.
   The new rules that which began last Friday in Lvov apply to all
foreign visitors to the former Polish city in the western Ukraine.
   Poles say the move is aimed mainly at them, part of a growing
crackdown by Poland's neighbors on international commerce by
private traders.
   As the Polish government has eased limitations on travel by
Poles, they have gained a reputation as voracious traders,
especially in goods scarce in East bloc countries or available more
cheaply because of socialist-system subsidies.
   Meanwhile, to the north along Poland's eastern border, the
crossing into Lithuania will reopen Saturday, the official Polish
news agency PAP reported, quoting the Lithuanian agency ELTA.
   The crossing at Ogrodniki has been closed since April, when
Soviet authorities imposed an economic blockade on the
independence-seeking republic. The Lithuanian parliament on June 29
accepted a compromise that traded a 100-day moratorium on the
declaration of independence for an immediate end to the blockade
and the start of negotiations.

<HEAD>Drug and Child Abuse Charges Filed Against Chuck Berry</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. CHARLES, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities charged rock 'n' roll great
Chuck Berry with child abuse and possession of marijuana based on
evidence seized in a raid on his home last month.
   Three charges of child abuse allege that Berry, 63, made films
of nude youths under age 17 for sexual gratification. A fourth
charge alleged possession of more than 35 grams of marijuana.
   William Hannah, St. Charles County prosecutor, announced the
charges Thursday. His office said he wouldn't comment further.
   In a raid last month at Berry's estate near Wentzville, about 40
miles west of St. Louis, authorities said they turned up several
plastic bags of marijuana, some hashish, two .22-caliber rifles and
a shotgun, plus $122,000 and various pornographic videotapes,
slides and books.
   Berry's telephone number is unlisted and calls to the office of
Berry's attorney, Wayne Schoeneberg, went unanswered Thursday.
   After the raid, Schoeneberg had questioned the basis for
Hannah's investigation.
   He said he believed the investigation was related to a lawsuit
filed in December by a former cook at Berry's Southern Air
restaurant in Wentzville. She alleged he made videotapes of her and
other women as they dressed, undressed and used the toilet in the
women's restroom.
   Last month, a class-action lawsuit was filed against Berry on
behalf of 200 other women.
   Last month's raid came after an informant told authorities Berry
had received a large amount of cocaine and would have it at his
home, court documents said. But police found no cocaine.
   Berry, who made a surprise appearance at a news conference
Hannah held after the raid, said he had never used cocaine.

<HEAD>Gun That Killed Colombian Presidential Candidate Came from Antigua</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. JOHN'S, Antigua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Colombian government official says
a weapon used to assassinate a presidential candidate in Colombia
last year was part of an arms shipment sent by Israel to Antigua.
   Pablo Gonzalez Monge of the Colombian attorney general's office
testified Wednesday before a commission investigating the shipment
of Israeli arms from Antigua to Colombian drug lord Gonzalo
Rodriguez Gacha.
   Gonzalez Monge said the shipment included one rifle that was
used in the August assassination of Colombian presidential
candidate Luis Carlos Galan. He said the weapon was identified by
its serial number.
   The killing sparked the Colombian government's crackdown on
cocaine traffickers.
   Israel has accused a son of Prime Minister Vere Bird of ordering
weapons for Antigua's army that wound up at a farm owned by
Rodriguez Gacha.
   An earlier investigation determined that the arms arrived in
Antigua on April 24, 1989, and left the same day.
   The weapons included machine guns, submachine guns, assault
rifles and shoulder-fired rockets. They were seized from the farm
in Colombia during an army raid in February.
   The Antiguan government has said it never sanctioned the arms
purchase, but Israeli officials claim former National Security
Minister Vere Bird Jr. made the order.

<HEAD>Government Wants Bigger Concession Fees</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Profits are good for food vendors and gift
shops at the national parks and the Interior Department believes
the government should get a bigger part of the action.
   Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan said Thursday that in future
contract talks with park concessionaires he will press for higher
franchise fees. He said Uncle Sam now gets only about 2.5 percent
on average of what customers pay.
   Lujan told a news conference he also intends to seek other
changes in the park concession system to provide more competition.
Several congressional panels are looking into park concessionaire
profits and the lack of competition for contracts.
   Two recent investigations by the Interior Department concluded
that park concessionaires are reaping millions of dollars in
profits, while paying in some cases less than 1 percent of gross
receipts to the federal government.
   In 1988, gross receipts of concessionaires were reported at more
than $500 million, of which only $12.5 million went to the National
Park Service.
   Lujan said he had no quarrel with the quality of park
concessions in general, but he said the government should receive
more money from concession revenues so parks can be improved.
   ``I don't think we will put any concessionaires in a position of
losing money'' but the intent is to cut into ``the excessive
profits,'' he said. He said the park service will push for higher
franchise fees as contracts come up for renewal over the next few
years.
   Lujan declined to say specifically how much more concessionaires
should pay, saying that would tip his hand in upcoming contract
negotiations. But he noted that he considers Yellowstone National
Park, where the government collects fees of about 22 percent of
concession receipts, as a model.
   Financial information from concessionaires has been difficult to
obtain. When the recent Interior studies included profit figures at
specific parks, the Conference of National Park Concessioners, a
trade group, successfully won a court order barring disclosure of
the information.
   Environmentalists called Lujan's announcement a good first step.
   ``For too long now, too many concessionaires have been getting a
sweetheart deal,'' said Paul Prichard, president of the National
Parks and Conservation Association.
   George Frampton, president of the Wilderness Society, said that
while Lujan is aiming in the right direction, Congress should pass
legislation to open the park concession business to competition.
   The Wilderness Society is considering bidding for concession
rights at some parks, including Yosemite National Park in
California, but Frampton said entry into the business is almost
impossible because of the advantages given an incumbent
concessionaire.
   Under the law, concessionaires are given preferential contract
renewal rights that allow them to match any other bid. The
government also has allowed incumbent concessionaires to value
their capital improvements at parks artificially high, making it
difficult for a competitor to purchase these facilities.
   As a result, there has been little competition for concession
rights, although business at some of the parks has been highly
profitable. Lujan said that of 29 contract bids that have gone out,
only one has attracted competitive interest.
   Lujan said he hopes to make the bidding system more competitive
by seeking shorter contracts, redefining what should constitute
``preferential rights'' and adopting new accounting methods when
setting values for capital improvements by concessionaires.
   In addition, the National Park Service plans to use outside
consultants to analyze concessionaires' financial statements,
appraisals and other documents as part of future contract
negotiations. Contract talks traditionally have been conducted by
local park officials who have little financial background.
   While some park concessions continue to be run by small
companies, concessionaires at large parks often are subsidiaries of
major entertainment conglomerates, such as MCA Inc., whose Park &amp;
Curry Co. subsidiary runs concessions at Yosemite.

<HEAD>Meat Critics Don't Snap at Hot Dogs</HEAD>

   Animal rights groups, at least one country
singer and a former Beatle have been snapping at meat eaters
lately. But none has bitten down hard on the hot dog.
   That's came as something of a surprise, considering it's
National Hot Dog Month, the industry says. And critics might be
expected to challenge this extravaganza and the 5 billion hot dogs
consumed by Americans each year.
   But Sara Lilygren of the American Meat Institute, a national
trade association, says she has heard no specific protests about
hot dogs. She did, however, mention some of the general meat
protests now making the rounds.
   ``Hot dogs have not been attacked in any big way that I know
of,'' Lilygren said Thursday in a telephone interview. ``But
there's something about a hot dog that's so all-American, maybe
that's the reason.''
   In Ames, Iowa, this week, Paul McCartney stirred resentment
among many farmers in the big corn-beef-and-pork state when his
anti-meat sentiments were publicized. But the former Beatle played
down his vegetarianism during his concert there Wednesday night.
   ``We haven't come on this tour to preach against meat,'' he
said. ``We're pro-corn, very pro-corn.''
   That didn't stop the Maryland-based animal rights group, People
for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, from offering concert goers
tofu ``not dogs'' as an alternative to the meat kind.
   Lilygren noted that Canadian-born singer k.d. lang also has been
controversial with her ``Meat Stinks'' commercials for PETA,
causing some Midwest radio stations to ban her albums.
   The institute and the National Hot Dog and Sausage Council said
a joint ``full course hot dog lunch'' in Washington, D.C., recently
was a howling success.
   More than 400 attended, including Rep. Kika de la Garza,
D-Texas, chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, who
proclaimed hot dogs to be ``an American tradition,'' they said.
   For those who pursue trivia, the hot dog industry also provided
some background:
   Frankfurt-am-Main, in West Germany, is traditionally credited
with inventing the frankfurter in 1484. In the late 1800s, hot dogs
_ also called dachshund sausages because of their shape _ gained
popularity in the United States, as they had in Europe.
   A German butcher in New York City opened the first Coney Island
hot dog stand in 1871. Hot dogs were sold at the 1893 Chicago
world's fair, and they quickly became standard fare at baseball
parks.
   ``Hot dogs earned their unique name in 1901 at the New York Polo
Grounds,'' the report said. ``On a cold April day, concessionaire
Harry Stevens was losing money with ice cream and cold drinks.''
   Stevens, goes the legend, sent out for dachshund sausages and
rolls. His vendors began hawking hot dogs from portable hot water
tanks, yelling, ``They're red hot! Get your dachshund sausages
while they're red hot!''
   Sports cartoonist Tad Dorgan heard the vendors and drew a
cartoon of barking dachshund sausages on a roll with the caption,
``Hot dog!'' The new name stuck.

   A conservation group says a new survey shows
most farmers would support changes in federal law that would help
protect the environment.
   Officials of the American Farmland Trust said Thursday the
survey provided ``strong evidence that farmers are more supportive
of environmentally sound farming practices than their Washington
lobbyists admit.''
   The survey results were released as the Senate began debate on
the 1990 farm bill, a complex measure that will guide U.S. farm
programs and policy for the next five years.
   In recent months, the trust said, much of the debate about farm
bill amendments has centered on alleged farmer resistance to
changes in federal law that would help clean up the environment,
including reduced use of chemicals and fertilizers.
   According to the survey, more than 70 percent of about 1,000
farmers interviewed in 22 states were ``interested in participating
in a federal cost-sharing program that would reduce contamination
of water through the adoption of new farm management practices.''
   Further, it said, majorities of these farmers approve of
pesticide and fertilizer use plans that would help farmers
economize on the use of these materials.
   Ralph Grossi, president of the Farmland Trust, a membership
organization, said he gave congressional agriculture committees
high marks for their efforts to protect wetlands and set the right
course on water quality planning and flexible cropland use.
   But he added, ``I give them very low marks on long-term soil
protection, promotion of environmentally sustainable farming, and
protection of farmland from urban encroachment.''
   Officials said the survey was designed to reflect national
attitudes. It did not show state breakdowns.
   The states where the survey was conducted are: Alabama,
Arkansas, California, Georgia, Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas,
Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Montana, North Dakota,
Nebraska, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Texas, Washington
and Wisconsin.

   Milk prices at the farm declined last winter
but regained some of their lost ground during the spring, an
Agriculture Department report said.
   ``However, continued substantial growth in milk production and
reductions in probably swollen user inventories of non-fat dry milk
likely will limit further advances in milk and dairy product
prices,'' the report said Thursday.
   Milk production in the second half of 1990 probably will rise
about 3 percent from a year earlier, the report said. That would
raise total 1990 milk output by about 2 percent from last year.
   If wholesale prices hold relatively steady the rest of 1990,
analysts said the average price increase for farm milk prices may
be in the range of 3 percent to 5 percent for the entire year.
   Retail prices for dairy products in 1990 may be up an average of
8 percent to 10 percent from last year, the report said.

   The death toll from a devastating

Marine plane crashed during rescue operations near this mountain
resort. One crewman was killed.
   U.S. and Philippine officials said the OV-1 observation plane

110 miles north of the capital Manila.
   One crewman died and the other was rushed to a U.S. hospital in

   The plane was from the Subic Bay naval base and was taking prt

triggered by Monday's quake.
   Jose de Jesus, chairman of presidential task force supervising
recovery operations, said at least 224 people were killed in this
mountain resort during the earthquake, which measured 7.7 on the
Richter Scale. Two of the dead were Americans.
   De Jesus said more than 1,800 people were rescued from the
wreckage of 27 buildings, including eight hotels severely damaged
or destroyed during the temblor. He said another 129 people died in
surrounding Benguet province.
   The latest figures brought the number killed in the quake to at
least 608 with more than 1,200 others injured. The toll was
expected to rise as new reports of casualties were still being
received four days after the quake.
   About 190 people were believed buried in ruins of seven other
hotels and in a factory in Baguio that caught fire after the quake,
de Jesus said. Rescuers feared most were dead.
   Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos said there were indications more
deaths may have occurred in the northern province of Nueva Vizcaya
than the 27 so far reported.
   Social Welfare Secretary Mita Pardo de Tavera said more than 70
people may have been killed in Nueva Vizcaya although the reports
were still being verified.
   Ramos said about 900 motorists were believed stranded by
landslides along the national highway along the border between
Nueva Ecija and Nueva Vizcaya province, about 100 miles north of
Manila.
   U.S. Marines and the Philippine air force planned air missions
Friday to rescue passengers in about 50 buses, trucks and cars
stranded along the Kennon Road, a major highway near Baguio.
   On Friday, a Philippine air force helicopter flying relief
supplies to Baguio was forced to land in the mountains because of
strong winds. There was no word on whether the crew was injured.
   As many as 30,000 people fled on foot from Baguio resort for the
lowlands along a highway blocked by landslides, an official said.
   Scores of people crowded aboard military aircraft which were
flying relief supplies. The U.S. military also flew about 500
Americans and Filipinos from Baguio to Clark Air Base.
   All roads to the city were cut off by the quake and army
engineers worked to try to clear one highway. Highways Secretary
Fiorello Estuar complained the exodus was delaying clearing
operations.
   President Corazon Aquino imposed price controls Thursday on
rice, pork and other staples in the quake-affected areas.
   American rescuers halted rescue operations Thursday at the
Nevada Hotel in Baguio after recovering the bodies of Richard
Finley, an official of the U.S. Agency for International
Development, and Alice Laya, wife of former Education Minister
Jaime Laya.
   Both had been attending an agency conference. Officials said
about 20 Filipinos working for the organization were missing and
feared dead in the hotel. U.S. officials said an American woman was
killed but her name was withheld pending notification of kin.
   ``The rescue effort (at the Nevada) is over,'' said John
Mitchell, a fireman from Miami, who was among Americans sent by the
U.S. government for the rescue effort. ``Nobody's alive in there.''
   Rescue efforts continued at the Hyatt, where more than 50 people
were believed trapped, including five Americans. Mario Say-Ocha, a
miner who volunteered to search for survivors, said the stench of
death was so strong that ``it can turn your stomach.''
   Benumbed survivors complained they were receiving little help
from the government.
   ``We are trying to bring my daughter down to Nueva Ecija but we
are given the runaround,'' said Ricardo Manalastas, whose daughter
Marissa, 21, was killed. ``If I can just carry my daughter's body
over my shoulders, I will do so.''
   In Cabanatuan, 60 miles north of Manila, British technicians
using sensor devices found no signs of life in the debris of the
six-story Philippine Christian College.
   Hundreds of students and teachers were trapped when the building
collapsed. Rescuers found 137 survivors and 60 dead in Cabanatuan.
British rescuers said sensors indicated about 25 bodies remained
buried.
   In La Union province, officials reported widespread damage in
several towns, including Agoo where the municipal hall, public
market and a church collapsed. Officials complained aid was slow in
coming.
   Edgar Bacungan, mayor of Caba in La Union, said most of the
15,000 residents were camping out in front of the town auditorium
because so many homes were damaged or destroyed.
   ``We don't have any tents,'' he said. ``The children are getting
sick.''
   In Manila, Rep. Rolando Andaya, chairman of the House
appropriations committee, said he would propose a two-year
suspension of payments on the country's $26 billion foreign debt to
free funds for reconstruction.
   The House resumes sessions Monday after the summer recess, and
Andaya said he expected the resolution to pass easily.
   Preliminary estimates place quake damage at more than $1 billion.

<TEXT>
   The presidents of Italy and France
celebrated the 25th anniversary of the Mont Blanc tunnel that runs
through the Alps and connects their countries. They said it
symbolizes European unity.
   About 100 environmentalists demonstrated at Thursday's
celebration to protest a proposal to double the capacity of the
tunnel under 15,000-foot Mont Blanc, the highest peak in the Alps.
   French President Francois Mitterrand, with Italian President
Francesco Cossiga at his side, said no decision had been made on
expansion but that the nations ``must look ahead to new passages
through the Alps.''
   He praised the tunnel as ``a precursor to the barriers falling
around Europe.''
   Any expansion proposal should include a high-speed train link
between France and Italy, Mitterrand said, although a final
decision can wait for a few years.
   Annual traffic through the tunnel has more than tripled since it
opened 25 years ago. In 1989, 1,821,698 vehicles passed through,
compared to 592,450 in 1966.
   An estimated 29 million vehicles have since made the 7.2-mile
passage between Chamonix, France and Aoste, Italy.

   Forget Bruce Willis, Arnold Schwarzenegger and
Tom Cruise. The new stars of the summer are a spooky spider and a
bubbly bear.
   The mega-budget, male-oriented films ``Die Hard 2,'' ``Total
Recall'' and ``Days of Thunder'' have yet to excite moviegoers the
way last summer's ``Batman'' did.
   But the Walt Disney Co. hopes its ``Arachnophobia'' and ``Jungle
Book'' can find loyal patrons in the crowded summer film season.
   There's no way ``Arachnophobia'' will match ``Batman,'' which
made $252 million in 1989. The eight-legged drama does have the
potential, though, to emerge as one of the season's sleeper
successes.
   In a campaign littered with hardware-laden projects aimed at
young males, ``Arachnophobia'' and Paramount's ``Ghost,'' two
modest, original works, appear to have a good chance of reaching a
broader audience.
   There are signs that a share of the audience is more interested
in novel, non-sequel titles than the more heavily promoted and
expensive cookie-cutter films.
   ``Jungle Book,'' the 1967 film re-released last Friday by
Disney, enjoyed the best opening ever for an animated movie with
$7.7 million last weekend, surpassing the $7.5 million collected by
``The Land Before Time'' in its debut weekend in 1988.
   On Wednesday, ``Arachnophobia,'' starring Jeff Daniels and John
Goodman, opened to moderate but unspectacular business of about
$1.2 million on more than 1,200 screens. ``Who Framed Roger
Rabbit,'' by comparison, grossed $1.8 million in its first night on
999 screens two summers ago.
   On Tuesday, Walt Disney Co. President Frank Wells predicted the
thriller, the first release from Disney subsidiary Hollywood
Pictures, would be one of the season's biggest hits.
   The head of marketing for a competing studio, speaking on
condition that he not be identified, said ``Arachnophobia'' should
open slowly and build forcefully on strong word of mouth. (It's
pronounced ah-rak'-nah-foh'-bee-yah.)
   CinemaScore, which tracks audience reactions to movies, said the
film scored a B&plus; in surveys of 335 patrons Wednesday. That places
it alongside ``Dick Tracy,'' but below ``Ghost,'' ``Days of
Thunder'' and ``Die Hard 2,'' all of which earned an A rating.
   Among the summer releases that have been savaged by reviewers
are ``RoboCop 2,'' ``Betsy's Wedding,'' ``Fire Birds,'' ``The
Adventures of Ford Fairlane,'' ``Cadillac Man,'' ``Quick Change''
and ``Ghost Dad.''
   ``Arachnophobia'' is about the invasion of a small California
town by a deadly South American spider. In ``Ghost,'' a murdered
man's spirit comes back to protect his lover and solve his own
slaying.
   On Monday and Tuesday nights, ``Ghost'' quietly made more money
than Bruce Willis' noisy ``Die Hard 2,'' even though the latter
film, made at an estimated cost of a staggering $62 million, was
playing on more than twice as many screens.
   While there's no ``Batman'' this summer, the season, now halfway
finished, is hardly fizzling. In fact, it likely will be the
second-best in Hollywood history, and it easily should exceed the
1988 holiday season returns of $1.7 billion.
   ``The business of some of these movies is incredible,'' said Tom
Sherak, president of domestic distribution and marketing for 20th
Century Fox. ``Shame on everybody for comparing it to last year.''
   Said Barry London, president of Paramount's motion picture
group: ``Some films, depending on who was in them and the kind of
film they were, were coming in with unreasonably high
expectations.''
   The trade newspaper Daily Variety is predicting this summer's
box-office take will be about $1.85 billion, compared with the
record-setting 1989 summer when moviegoers spent $2.04 billion.
   ``You can't expect records to be broken every week,'' said John
Krier, president of Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc., which tracks
box-office figures. ``But it's a good summer.''

<HEAD>House Of Commons Votes To Make TV Coverage Permanent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House of Commons has voted to make television
coverage of its often rowdy proceedings permanent.
   The 131-32 vote Thursday night followed an eight-month
experiment that began Nov. 21 with TV cameras recording selected
sessions of the proceedings.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was among those who initially
opposed TV coverage, but the Conservative Party leader later
changed her mind.
   Opponents said they feared for the reputation of the House
because of frequent boisterous behavior among legislators.
   Bruce Grocott of the opposition Labor Party, a member of the
committee and a former TV producer, said TV audiences for
``question time,'' the twice weekly session when the prime minister
answers legislators' questions, ranged from 800,000 to 2 million.
   The sessions are noted for sharp exchanges between Mrs. Thatcher
and Labor leader Neil Kinnock.
   Mrs. Thatcher's replies and questions by Kinnock and other
legislators are often drowned out as rival legislators bellow
insults and the Speaker of the House, Bernard Weatherill, bawls
``order! order!''
   The House of Lords, the unelected upper chamber of Parliament,
has had TV coverage since 1985.

   The government plans to clean up one of

miners have dumped mercury, officials say.
   ``Without a doubt, there is an ecological time bomb set to go
off in the Tapajos river,'' geologist Elmer Salomao, director of
the National Department of Mineral Production, said in an interview
Thursday.
   Salamao said about 600 tons of mercury have been dumped since
1980 into the Tapajos, a 37,200-square-mile basin and tributary of
the Amazon river located in the northern Amazon state of Para.
   The government plans to decontaminate the river with a $200
million World Bank loan after a study is completed in December,
Salamao said.
   Prospectors use mercury in gold panning to join gold dust
particles.

<HEAD>GOP Leader Says Further Durenberger Sanctions Unwarranted</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The chairman of the Senate Republican
conference says Sen. Dave Durenberger is being punished enough for
ethics violations and he doesn't plan to take any action against
him.
   The GOP caucus could strip the 12-year senator from Minnesota of
his seniority or choice committee assignments.
   ``He has been examined quite thoroughly here,'' said Ed Quinlan,
a spokesman for Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I. ``It would seem that
there's no need for another entity to deal with these events.''
   The Senate Ethics Committee on Thursday recommended the full
Senate denounce Durenberger for ``reprehensible'' financial conduct
and require him to make up to $124,000 in restitution.
   The committee said Durenberger violated Senate rules by
laundering speaking fees through a book contract and claiming
reimbursement for staying in a Minneapolis condominium in which he
owned an interest.
   The committee referred its findings to the Senate Republican
conference as well as the Justice Department and the Federal
Election Commission.
   The GOP conference has no plans to pursue the matter and no
member has suggested disciplining Durenberger, Quinlan said.
   ``The language in the (Ethics Committee) report states that
there was no criminality, that there was no malice demonstrated by
his behavior, that Sen. Durenberger has publicly apologized for his
judgment and that's where it should lie,'' Quinlan said.
   Chafee, who considers Durenberger a personal friend, contributed
$1,000 to Durenberger's legal defense fund, according to records
released this week. He was the only sitting member of Congress to
do so.
   During its secret deliberations, the Ethics Committee rejected a
proposal to recommend that Republicans take away Durenberger's
committee seats, including a prized spot on the tax-writing Finance
Committee, said Lois West, Durenberger's press secretary.
   Durenberger agreed to reimburse the Senate $29,050 plus interest
for payments on his Minneapolis condominium and give to charities
$95,000 that he received in excess speaking fees, less whatever
taxes he paid on the income.
   Durenberger has already repaid $11,005 in condominium payments
to which the Senate Rules Committee said he wasn't entitled.
   He has paid $212,000 in legal fees, mostly from his campaign
treasury, and says he still owes about $377,000.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's chief economic adviser is
taking out after ``prophets of decline-ism'' who are forecasting
America is fast becoming a second-rate economic power.
   Michael Boskin, chairman of the president's Council of Economic
Advisers, says he is tired of hearing America is losing its
competitive edge to countries such as Japan or that the country is
losing control of its economic destiny to foreign investors who are
buying up America.
   ``The United States has not lost and is not losing its position
as the world's leading economic power,'' Boskin said Thursday in a
speech to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
   ``The fact is that with less than 5 percent of the world's
population, we produce 26 percent of the world's gross national
product,'' Boskin said.
   Boskin conceded that the country does face problems, listing in
particular the need to shrink the federal budget deficit and
improve a weak elementary and secondary school system, which he
called ``an outright disgrace and a ticking time bomb.''
   But Boskin said the United States can muster the political will
to correct its own problems.
   ``The real challenges facing the American economy are
significant, but this does not mean that the U.S. economy will
inevitably become second-class as the prophets of decline-ism would
have us believe,'' Boskin said in a speech previewing economic
themes likely to be used by Republicans during the fall
congressional campaigns.
   ``The United States is large and strong, indeed pre-eminent in
the world. Its future is neither bleak nor predetermined,'' he
said. ``Our destiny is overwhelmingly in our own hands.''
   Boskin attacked Democratic critics who have been pushing for the
administration to close U.S. markets to foreign goods in
retaliation for other countries erecting barriers to American
products. He said it is ``wrongheaded'' to call for the federal
government to take a more active role in promoting commercial
research and development projects normally done by private industry.
   This approach, sometimes called an industrial policy, is modeled
after the success Japan's powerful Ministry of International Trade
and Industry has supposedly achieved in promoting the economic
interests of Japanese businesses.
   Boskin said proponents of this approach chose to ignore the
failures of Japanese government planners, such as their suggestion
many years ago that Sony Corp. would have more success if it did
not get into the home electronics field.
   Boskin also dismissed forecasts that the current economic
expansion of nearly eight years _ the longest in peacetime history
_ is in imminent danger of ending in a recession.
   ``This expansion can, should and most likely will continue for
some time to come,'' he said. ``The most likely outcome is that
after a period of a few quarters of slower growth, we will see the
economy pick up the pace in the second half of this year.''

<HEAD>Salvadoran Rebels Insist on Purge of Military in Peace Talks
Opening Today</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUGLAS GRANT MINE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Salvadoran guerrilla leaders are sticking to
a stance they had when the last peace talks failed _ that the
government must purge the army of rights abusers.
   The talks scheduled to resume today in San Jose, Costa Rica, are
the third round of U.N.-mediated negotiations that started in
Venezuela in May.
   Rebel leaders say they are preparing for a military offensive
like one in November, their largest ever, if the new round of talks
fails to produce results on the issue of the armed forces.
   The leftist Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, or FMLN,
has fought a series of U.S.-backed governments in a 10-year-old
civil war that has claimed some 72,000 lives.
   ``There is a sector of the armed forces that must pay the bill
for so much oppression imposed on the counry,'' guerrilla commander
Schafik Handal, the chief rebel negotiator, said in an interview
with The Associated Press at the rebels' Mexico City office.
   This issue of the role of the military was a major sticking
point in the last round of talks held in Mexico in June between the
rebels and the conservative government of President Alfredo
Cristiani.
   Salvadoran Defense Minister Gen. Humberto Larios said the army
will handle the hiring and firing in its ranks.
   ``We do not reject the idea of purifying our institution. The
armed forces, like any other insitution is subject to evolution, to
improvement,'' Larios said in a recent interview. But he said, ``We
are purifying ourselves.''
   Since 1979, troops and death squads linked to them have executed
about 30,000 people suspected of leftist sympathies, international
human rights groups say. No officer has been tried or found guilty
for such crimes.
   The U.S. Congress, the financial underwriter of the Salvadoran
government's war effort, plans to tie military aid for 1991 to
progress made in peace talks and to prosecution of army officers
responsible for a November massacre of six Jesuit priests.
   The war could drag on for years if the military is not
restructured, Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn, said this week, adding
that about 50 high-ranking army men should be eliminated.
   ``Fifty seems to us a low number,'' said Handal. Top guerrilla
leaders have suggested that 200 officers should be dropped from the
ranks.
   Handal said the army's efforts at self-purification have been so
ineffectual that rebel leaders are proposing abolishment of the
institution in a ``demilitarization'' process that would also mean
the disappearance of the guerrilla fighters.
   ``If Larios maintains that the army is being constantly
`purified' and nevertheless it continues to play the role of
repressor, then it's obvious that `purification' is not enough to
clean it up. It should be abolished flat-out, which is our
conclusion,'' Handal said.
   The Costa Rican army was abolished in 1949. Costa Rica is the
only country in Central America that can claim a stable democracy
throughout recent decades.
   The rebels proposes a police force under civilian command to
maintain law and order after demilitarization. The military is dead
set against the idea, and has gotten Cristiani's backing.
   ``The continued existence of the armed forces is not a subject
of discussion,'' the president said after last month's five-day
round of negotiations.

   A notebook in which William Butler Yeats wrote
much of his poetry and prose over three years sold at Sotheby's for
$360,000, the auctioneers said.
   The notebook was part of a sale Thursday of English literary and
historical manuscripts and books that totaled $2.13 million,
Sotheby's said.
   Other items included letters written by Indian independence
leader Mohandas K. Gandhi and a script for a James Bond movie.
   H.D. Lyon, a London dealer, bought the Yeats notebook. The
seller was not identified but was believed to be a collector.
   In 1923, Yeats became the first Irishman to win the Nobel Prize
for literature.
   The Great Vellum Notebook, as the manuscript is known, contains
380 pages and was used by Yeats from November 1930 to the summer of
1933, six years before his death.
   A collection of 76 unpublished autograph letters written by the
Indian independence leader, Mohandas K. Gandhi, to his eldest son,
Harilal, between 1900 and 1914 was bought anonymously for $50,000.
   In the letters, Gandhi offered advice on sex, counseling
celibacy, and on diet, praising onions and deploring chocolates.
   The working film scripts for the first James Bond film, ``Dr.
No,'' by British screenwriter Wolf Mankowitz, sold at three times
their estimate for $5,000. They were bought by Quaritch, a London
dealer known for rare books.

<TEXT>
   Non-communist Cambodian guerrillas say
heavy government shelling has forced them out of a central
Cambodian town that functioned as the capital of the territory they
control.
   Guerrillas loyal to Prince Norodom Sihanouk retreated along with
civilians Thursday to the outskirts of the town, Stoung, in Kompong
Thom province, said spokesman Roland Eng.
   He said government forces had rained artillery and multiple
rocket launchers for two days, and some civilians were hurt.
   Neither side held Stoung today, but some guerrillas have
returned there, Eng said in a telephone interview from his Bangkok
office.
   The guerrillas said they took Stoung on April 12, and since used
it as an administrative and communications base for wide areas of
the province they have seized.
   Eng denied a statement from the Vietnamese-installed government
that it had retaken Stoung last Sunday.
   Stoung is only about 95 miles north of the national capital,
Phnom Penh. It was the most populated town under guerrilla control
with tens of thousands of residents.
   Sihanouk's forces are allied in a guerrilla coalition with the
communist Khmer Rouge and the non-communist fighters of former
Prime Minster Son Sann. They are fighting the government Vietnam
installed in Phnom Penh after invading the country in late 1978 to
topple a Khmer Rouge government.
   Sihanouk said Thursday his forces were more determined than ever
to fight after the U.S. announced a day earlier that it was
withdrawing recognition of the coalition's seat at the United
Nations.
   The U.S. shift was prompted by fears of a return to power of the
Khmer Rouge, the strongest rebel force. While in power from
1975-78, hundreds of thousands of people died as a result of a
radical program to turn the country into an agrarian commune.

   Regional economic growth in the United States
is shifting away from the bi-coastal pattern of the 1980s and
returning to the Sun Belt-Frost Belt split of the 1970s, a
government report indicates.
   The Commerce Department said Thursday that personal incomes grew
fastest in western states and slowest in New England between the
first quarter of 1989 and the January-March period of this year.
   By region, incomes in the Far West grew 8.5 percent; Southeast,
7.2 percent; Rocky Mountain states, 7.1 percent; Southwest and
Mid-Atlantic states, 7 percent; Plains states, 6.8 percent; Great
Lakes states, 5.5 percent and New England, 5.2 percent.
   Eight of the 11 states with fastest income growth were in the
West, while four of the nine states with the slowest growth were in
New England.
   Economists who follow regional patterns said Thursday's report
provided evidence that the bi-coastal economy of the 1980s, in
which California and the Northeast enjoyed more prosperity than the
nation's heartland, is over.
   ``We are returning to an economic pattern that we saw 15 to 20
years ago,'' said economist Robert Dye of The Wefa Group, a Bala
Cynwyd, Pa., forecasting firm.
   Growth rates among the top 11 ranged from Nevada's 12.2 percent,
the fastest in the United States, to Oregon and California's 8.2
percent. That compares with a national average over the period of
6.9 percent.
   Rates in other states in the top 11 were: Hawaii, 9.9 percent;
Alaska, 9.8 percent; Washington, 9.6 percent; Idaho, 9.2 percent;
Kansas, 8.9 percent, and Utah, Florida and Minnesota, 8.4 percent.
   The states with the slowest income growth were: North Dakota,
2.3 percent; South Dakota, 3 percent; New Hampshire, 3.6 percent;
Montana, 4 percent; Indiana and Maine, 4.4 percent; Massachusetts,
4.6 percent; West Virginia, 4.9 percent and Rhode Island, 5 percent.
   Economist Mark Zandi of Regional Financial Associates, a West
Chester, Pa., consulting firm, said a booming casino industry and
related construction are keeping Nevada growing.
   Growth in the Northeast is being fueled by strong lumber
exports, a flood of orders for civilian aircraft to Boeing Co. and
heavy migration of Californians looking for a more affordable place
to live, he said.
   Meanwhile, declines in real estate construction, high-tech
companies, defense contracting and banking are crimping New
England's income growth, he said.
   ``In New England, all the industries that supported the economy
are in recession,'' he said.
   According to the Commerce Department, a rebound in farm income
helped Kansas this year after drought shriveled the state's winter
wheat crop in 1989.
   Zandi said Florida and California were two high-growth states in
danger of cooling off.
   Migration and tourism have been supporting the Florida economy,
but when national economic growth softens, as it has this year,
fewer people take vacations, he said. Also, lackluster real estate
markets in the Northeast make it more difficult for retirees to
sell their houses and move south, he said.
   ``California is at risk because ... housing is extremely
unaffordable in most parts of the state. Crime, pollution and
congestion are all problems that are going to slow migration
flows,'' he said.
   ``You're probably not going to see a California recession, but
you will see much slower growth,'' Zandi said.

<HEAD>House Restores Proposed Cuts in Drug Program Funding</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Democrats are backing away from a
threatened $231 million cut in the administration's anti-drug
programs following a name-calling exchange with drug policy
director William J. Bennett.
   The House agreed Thursday to restore the proposed cut in fiscal
1991 drug education and treatment programs as it approved a $170
billion appropriations bill covering labor, health and education
spending.
   The outspoken Bennett had denounced Congress as ``cheap,
dishonest and sneaky'' after the House Appropriations Committee
last week approved a bill that contained cuts in President Bush's
requests for drug demand-reduction programs.
   Bush had sought $252 million, but the panel approved only $21
million.
   ``I just resent that,'' Rep. Silvio Conte of Massachusetts,
ranking Republican on the Appropriations Committee, said of
Bennett. ``He didn't just say Democrats. He said we're all a bunch
of clowns up here.''
   ``Bill Bennett has lost his effectiveness with the Congress,''
said Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., chairman of the House select
committee on narcotics. ``He has now seen fit to insult the
Congress rather than consult the Congress.''
   The House approved the appropriations bill 359-58, after
defeating a series of amendments that would have cut total spending.
   Democrats have strongly criticized Bennett in the past for not
putting enough money into and emphasis on treatment and education.
Bennett's discovery of the hidden cuts _ which were never debated
in public sessions _ politically embarrassed House Democrats.
   Rep. William H. Natcher, D-Ky., chairman of the Appropriations
subcommittee that wrote the bill, offered an amendment on the floor
that restored the cuts.
   The amendment was sought by House Democratic leaders and
approved on a voice vote, but only after congressmen paraded before
the podium to attack Bennett.
   ``If our drug czar is going to wind up hyperventilating in
public every time he doesn't get a dollar he wanted, then I suggest
he go back to chain smoking so he can calm down,'' said Rep. David
Obey, D-Wis.
   Bennett said later he was pleased the money was restored and
that the changes represented drug treatment for as many as 100,000
people.
   ``I know Democrats are upset. I know some Republicans are upset,
too. And I'm sorry about the rancor this has caused,'' Bennett
said. ``But we needed this money. We were taken completely by
surprise on these cuts, and raising a ruckus seemed the only way to
get this money back.''
   Appropriations Committee members said they had agreed to the
cuts because much of the money in the programs' 1990 budget had not
yet been spent.
   Natcher, in an interview, said only 29 percent of $1.1 billion
in block grants to the states for drug treatment had been spent in
the first 9{ months of the current fiscal year.
   ``I don't want to get in any disagreement with Bill Bennett,''
Natcher said. ``Sometimes you can get a little mad and say things
you shouldn't. ... Bill Bennett was mad, and I'm not.''
   The programs targeted for cuts included a block grant program to
states to finance drug treatment programs, an Education Department
program for drug education in the schools and funding for local
assistance for treatment.
   The bill provides $7.6 billion for the Department of Labor in
fiscal 1991. It authorizes $135.7 billion for the Department of
Health and Human Services, $26 billion for the Department of
Education, and $1 billion for related agencies.
   The total represents a $17.3 billion increase over 1990 spending
and a $4.2 billion increase over the amount requested by Bush in
his proposed 1991 budget.

<TEXT>
   President Bush had lots of practical reasons
to decide to open talks with Vietnam about the war in neighboring
Cambodia.
   The question now is whether he acted in time.
   The Khmer Rouge, which massacred hundreds of thousands of
Cambodians when it ran the Southeast Asian country from 1975 to
1978, is advancing toward the capital, Phnom Penh.
   The Khmer Rouge poses a far more serious threat to the Cambodian
people than the pro-Vietnam government the United States has been
trying to upset with millions of dollars of aid to insurgents, some
of it covert.
   Bush's decision, which was urged on him by Secretary of State
James A. Baker III, means talking to the Vietnamese about holding
multi-party elections in Cambodia.
   It also may lead to U.S. recognition of Vietnam, a lowering of a
15-year trade embargo and perhaps a slowdown of the tragic exodus
of ``boat people.'' Many of these Vietnamese economic refugees, if
they survive, reach Malaysia or Hong Kong only to be pushed off.
   Those are some of the practical steps that could follow this
latest decision by a practical president who won the White House
disguised as a conservative ideologue but mostly is a politician
who keeps his ear close to the ground.
   Another step could be to encourage Vietnam, which has sent
troops and advisers back into Cambodia after last year's pullout,
to step up the pressure on the Khmer Rouge.
   Whether Bush takes that nervy last step remains to be seen.
   But for now, at least, he has stopped trying to isolate Vietnam
diplomatically. Even though he isn't ready to normalize relations
with Hanoi or authorize talks with the Cambodian government, Bush
is no longer shunning the two countries as puppets of Moscow.
   The policy shift is hardly unprecedented.
   Bush has switched on taxes. He has dropped his suspicions about
Mikhail Gorbachev. And, most of all, he has concluded the Cold War
is over and is making military decisions accordingly.
   Pressure from Congress played a part in these turnabouts. And
Congress was moving to choke off aid to the Cambodian guerrillas
when the policy shift was hatched last Friday at the White House.
   But Bush and Baker, his pragmatic adviser, also were guided by
other practical considerations. One was successful cooperation with
the Soviet Union in other regional disputes. The next dividend
could be an agreement on how to end the 12-year war in Afghanistan.
   The most practical reason of all, however, was to try to staunch
the bloodletting in Cambodia.
   The guerrillas were unable to contain the Khmer Rouge, Baker
said in announcing the policy shift Wednesday in front of the U.S.
Embassy in Paris. ``The fighting continues,'' he said. ``Cambodians
continue to suffer and Cambodians continue to die.''
   So Bush has put aside two decades of U.S. hostility toward Hanoi
and effectively withdrew diplomatic recognition of the rebels
trying to overthrow Prime Minister Hun Sen in Phnom Penh.
   The Khmer Rouge are by far the most powerful of the three
guerrilla factions. Until now, the Bush administration hoped the
coalition with the factions headed by Prince Norodom Sihanouk and
Son Sann would be able to defeat the Cambodian army or at least
fight it to a draw, thereby bringing about elections.
   This scenario depended also on the Khmer Rouge playing a benign
role in the transition to a new government.
   But the history of the Khmer Rouge provides no evidence of
restraint or of submission to popular will. The massacres they
conducted in the name of agrarian reform when they ran the country
matched the worst holocausts of the century.
   Jeremy Stone, president of the Federation of American
Scientists, has been campaigning for the policy shift for a long
time.
   ``It was probably inevitable,'' he said Thursday. ``The one
question smart guys all over town have been asking the
administration was what if your coalition wins? At some point
before a Khmer Rouge victory the State Department had to come to
its senses.''
   Stone is convinced that Vietnamese military advisers combined
with Cambodian forces can stop the Khmer Rouge. And, he said,
``we've got to stop threatening the Phnom Penh government so it can
hold the multi-party elections it has already agreed to hold.''

<TEXT>
   Senate Banking Committee Chairman Donald
Riegle says he is giving away the campaign money he got from
savings and loan interests and will accept no more.
   ``The magnitude of the problems in the S&amp;L industry _ stemming
from multiple causes over a 15-year period _ leave a shadow across
the industry and across any campaign contributions from that
industry,'' Riegle, D-Mich., said in a statement Thursday.
   Riegle is one of five senators under investigation by the Ethics
Committee for intervening with federal regulators on behalf of
Charles H. Keating Jr., former owner of the failed Lincoln Savings
and Loan. The government seized the Irvine, Calif. thrift last
year, a move expected to cost taxpayers $2 billion.
   Riegle said he would give the federal government a check for
about $120,000. It will cover all the money he has received from
thrift interests except for $78,250 from Keating and his
associates, which Riegle returned in 1988.
   He said he no longer will accept contributions from political
action committees representing any company whose principal business
is under his panel's jurisdiction. He also is forswearing donations
from officers of such companies, as well as fundraising events of
their sponsorship.
   Riegle said there were ``no personal conflicts of interest in
any of these contributions given in past years,'' and that ``all
were legal, proper and publicly recorded.'' He said he considered
it appropriate to give his remaining S&amp;L money to the government
rather than to the original contributors.
   In March 1987, Keating hosted a fund-raiser for Riegle at the
Pontchartrain Hotel in Detroit. A year later, Riegle returned
$78,250 given by 77 individuals who listed 13 separate business
connections after The Detroit News disclosed their ties to Keating.
   The News reported last week that Riegle received $7,250 from
individuals associated with Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan
Association of Denver, Colo., in 1987. He visited the thrift and
met with board members, including President Bush's son, Neil.
Silverado collapsed a year later and its bailout is expected to
cost $1 billion.
   Riegle was re-elected to a third term in 1988. He became
chairman of the Banking Committee last year.
   He has come under fire in Michigan for accepting generous
contributions from the thrift industry while a ranking member of
the banking committee _ particularly after the S&amp;L crisis arose.
   Common Cause, the self-styled citizens' lobby, reported recently
that Riegle was Congress' second-largest recipient of S&amp;L donations
in the 1980s.

<HEAD>New Technique May Give Earthbound Telescopes Clearer View Than
Hubble</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New technology may give ground telescopes a
clearer view of the stars than is possible from a repaired Hubble
Space Telescope and at only a fraction of the cost, according to a
study published today.
   Horace W. Babcock, the former director of the Carnegie
Institution observatories, said in the journal Science that new
telescope systems now being developed hold the promise of seeing
stellar objects as far away as those thought to be visible only by
a perfectly working Hubble.
   Babcock said the new system uses a mirror that can be warped, or
deformed, in a systematic way to compensate for the distortion of
the atmosphere. The process is called ``adaptive optics.''
   ``Adaptive telescopes in the infrared will not match the
resolution of the HST (Hubble Space Telescope), but in the visible
they may exceed it,'' Babcock's paper said.
   Babcock said in an interview that even if the new telescope
concepts fulfill their promise, orbiting observatories still are
needed because the Earth's atmosphere scatters light in some parts
of the spectrum, such as the ultraviolet. Only telescopes in space,
above the atmosphere, could collect such light, he said.
   But for visible light, he said, adaptive optics could allow
ground telescopes to match or exceed the capabilities of Hubble.
   ``These are more than just dreams,'' Babcock said.
   The European Southern Observatory in South America already is
experimenting with adaptive optics and ``has proven the value of
these systems'' in the infrared portion of the spectrum, he said.
   To adapt the technique for the visible spectrum will require
more experiments, he said, but researchers already have proven
elements of the system.
   Installing adaptive optics in a new telescope, Babcock said,
would be ``only a fraction of the total cost'' of the Hubble. He
said an 8-meter telescope could be built at some locations for
about $40 million.
   NASA spent $1.5 billion to build the space telescope. Engineers
learned last month that it is crippled by a mirror that gives an
out-of-focus view of the universe. The flaw may be corrected in
1993 when a new camera is installed.
   John Manges, an optics engineer on the Hubble project at NASA's
Goddard Space Flight Center, said adaptive optics on ground
telescopes could exceed the clarity of Hubble ``in years to come,
eventually.''
   Even now, he said, ``adaptive optics are getting competitive
with the Hubble in the visible region.''
   But Manges pointed out that even with new ground systems, an
orbiting telescope would have an advantage because it would not be
affected by weather or clouds. Ground observatories cannot work on
cloudy nights and some are affected by high winds. An orbiting
telescope also is able to observe in the ultraviolet portion of the
spectrum, which is impossible from the ground, he said.
   Babcock said the adaptive optics system works by using a mirror
that changes shape rapidly with computer instructions.
   ``When the right instructions are sent to a deformable mirror,
it deviates from flatness in such a way to correct for the
distortions caused by the atmosphere,'' he said. ``This will
compensate almost entirely for the distortion.''
   A telescope with adaptive optics will first focus on a bright
star and use the twinkling light to establish a pattern. The shape
of the deformable mirror then is changed as needed to compensate
for the twinkle caused by the atmosphere.
   Babcock said the optics, in effect, create a circle of
compensation through which the telescope could look far into the
universe.
   ``Any faint object, if it falls within that circle, can be
observed with very high resolving power,'' he said. Asked if such a
telescope could see objects 14 billion light years away, which is
the range expected from a perfectly working Hubble, Babcock said,
``There is no reason why it shouldn't work at such a distance.''
   Science, which published the report, is the journal of the
American Association for the Advancement of Science.

<HEAD>Researchers Find Molecule That Blocks AIDS Spread to Healthy Cells</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A synthetic protein molecule attaches itself
tightly to an AIDS virus in test tube experiments and prevents the
virus from infecting healthy cells, according to a report published
today.
   Researchers at Harvard said in a study in the journal Science
that the manmade molecule, called CPF, prevents a molecule on the
surface of the AIDS virus from adhering to the immune cells it
usually attacks.
   ``The CPF very effectively prevents the AIDS virus from binding
(sticking to a target cell) and this inhibits the spread of the
virus,'' said Steven J. Burakoff, a researcher at the Dana-Farber
Cancer Institute, an affiliate of Harvard University.
   Burakoff said CPF ``is also very inexpensive and very simple to
synthesize.''
   The Harvard researchers found CPF while studying the chemistry
of how the AIDS virus _ called human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV
_ is able to attach itself to T-lymphocytes, blood cells that are
part of the immune system and a principal target of the AIDS virus.
   HIV attacks T cells by using its surface molecule, called gp120,
to attach to a molecule called CD4 on the outside wall of a T cell.
In effect, the gp120 acts as a key to open the lock on the surface
of the T cell. The virus can then move inside.
   A molecule that sticks to the gp120, would, in effect, prevent
the key from fitting in the lock on the T cell surface, Burakoff
said. This, he said, would keep healthy cells from becoming
infected.
   In laboratory experiments, Burakoff said, the Harvard group
exposed AIDS virus to CPF and found that the manmade molecule stuck
so firmly to gp120 that it could not be washed off.
   Burakoff said the group then exposed an AIDS virus bound with
the CPF to healthy T cells. The AIDS virus, which would normally
attack the T cells with ease, was unable to cause an infection.
   Next, Burakoff said, AIDS-infected T cells were put in a test
tube with both healthy T cells and CPF. The synthetic molecule, he
said, prevented the virus from spreading from the infected T cells
to the uninfected cells.
   ``We found it to be very, very effective,'' said Burakoff. ``In
the test tube, anyway, the CPF molecules look very interesting.''
   The researcher said that tests of the molecule in laboratory
animals are just beginning and that there are ``many hurdles to go
over'' before the compound could be tested in human patients.
   Another AIDS researcher, Dr. Allen Goldstein of the George
Washington University School of Medicine in Washington, said the
research was ``very solid'' but noted, ``There's a long way to go
before you could translate that into a clinical application.''
   Goldstein said that CPF joins ``a whole bunch of potential
antivirals'' that need to be tested further.
   Before such a molecule is useful as a drug, he said, researchers
will have to show that it is effective in a concentration that the
body can tolerate and that it affects only the target virus.
   ``It would have a major problem in the body if it will stick to
lots of other things,'' said Goldstein.
   Burakoff said CPF is composed of two amino acids, proline and
phenylalanine, and is a small molecule.
   ``Being small, there is a reasonable chance that it can be given
orally,'' he said. ``And the fact that it can be synthesized means
it can easily be modified to improve it.''
   The CPF research was a combined effort by Burakoff's Dana-Farber
group and the Harvard University Department of Chemistry. Science
magazine is the journal of the American Association for the
Advancement of Science.

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Korean peninsula was divided into
Communist North Korea and capitalist South Korea at the end of
World War II in 1945. Following is a chronology on relations.
   Aug. 15, 1945: Korea was liberated from 35 years of Japanese
colonial rule. In the post-war politics Korea was divided along the
38th parallel with Soviet Union troops in the North and U.S. troops
in the South.
   1948: North Korea established a communist dictatorship headed by
Kim Il Sung. South Korea held elections and established a
U.S.-supported government headed by Syngman Rhee.
   1950: North Korea invaded South Korea, triggering a bitter
three-year civil war. An estimated 2.4 million soldiers and 4.4
million civilians were killed or wounded on both sides.
   1953: The Korean War ended with an armistice and a 2.5-mile-wide
Demilitarized Zone was established, dividing the peninsula. A peace
treaty was never signed.
   1968: A group of 31 North Korean commandos tried unsuccessfully
to assassinate then-president Park Chung-hee; the U.S.
reconnaissance ship Pueblo was captured by North Korea for
allegedly sailing into its territorial waters. The crew was
released 11 months later.
   1972: The Koreas issued a joint statement renouncing hostilities
and pledging peaceful unification of the peninsula, but talks fail.
   1974: The first of four tunnels allegedly dug by North Korea for
an invasion under the Demilitarized Zone was unearthed by South
Korea. Other tunnels were found in 1975, 1978 and 1990. North Korea
denied digging them.
   1976: North Korean security guards killed two U.S. soldiers with
axes in a dispute over pruning a tree in the Demilitarized Zone.
   1983: North Korean commandos bombed a cemetery in Rangoon,
Burma, killing 17 South Korean officials, including four Cabinet
ministers accompanying then-president Chun Doo-hwan.
   1985: 151 people including art performers and journalists from
each side visited the Korean capitals in an exchange and reunion of
separated families.
   1987: Two North Korean terrorists bombed a South Korean airliner
over the Andaman Sea near Burma killing all 115 people aboard. One
terrorist was captured and sentenced to death in Seoul. She was
pardoned and released in 1990 on grounds she had been duped and
repented her actions.
   1988: The Summer Olympic Games were held in Seoul with 160
nations attending. North Korea boycotted the games.
   1989: South Korea jailed five people, including a radical
student and and an opposition lawmaker, for defying a government
ban on travel to North Korea.
   1990: North Korea boycotted inter-Korea talks for six months,
demanding the annual U.S.-South Korean military maneuvers be
canceled and U.S. troops be withdrawn.
   January: North Korea demanded South Korea tear down a
Berlin-type border wall. South Korea says the alleged wall is a
series of tank traps.
   July 3: The two Koreas agreed to hold their first prime
ministers' talks, propably in September. An accord arranging the
date and an agenda was to be signed July 26.
   July 6: North Korea said it would open a small portion of its
border inside the Demilitarized Zone Aug. 15 to welcome South
Koreans desiring unification. It also said Seoul must abolish
anti-communist laws.
   July 20: South Korean President Roh Tae-woo proposes to open the
border for five days beginning Aug. 13.

<HEAD>Democrats Join To Approve Eastern European Aid Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A plan to provide U.S. support for emerging
Eastern European democracies is tangled in a political dispute as
Senate Foreign Relations Committee Democrats go forward with an aid
package despite a Republican boycott.
   The Democrat-controlled panel on Thursday voted 10-0, with all
nine Republican members absent, to send the $535 million bill to
the full Senate. The measure would give President Bush a long menu
of ideas for advancing economic reform in the former Warsaw Pact
nations, including ``technical assistance'' for the Soviet Union.
   The committee's senior Republican, Sen. Jesse Helms of North
Carolina, said in a letter to Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., who
chairs the panel, that ``the feeling of comity has collapsed''
during work on the East Europe aid bill.
   Helms complained that the measure was being rushed into action
without time for Republicans to review it and his aides said the
Bush administration had an extensive list of concerns about the
measure's overall cost and its specific provisions.
   Unlike foreign aid legislation passed last year, in which U.S.
help was limited to Poland and Hungary, the measure approved
Thursday makes assistance available to any Eastern European country
that Bush believes needs help on its road to democratic and
economic reform.
   The bill makes available $535 million for the programs in the
year that begins Oct. 1, well in excess of the $300 million Bush
had sought and an increase from the $489 million already approved
by the House.

<HEAD>Spy Suspect Tries To Quit Foreign Service</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Felix Bloch, target of a U.S. spy
investigation, wants to quit the Foreign Service, but the State
Department is trying to decide whether to fire him instead, a
spokesman says.
   Bloch, 55, lost his job in the European Affairs bureau in
February and his $80,000-a-year pay stopped with his suspension. In
the meantime, the Justice Department looked into suspicions Bloch
gave sensitive information to the Soviet Union and had been paid by
Moscow.
   However, law enforcement sources have said the FBI was unable to
prove that Bloch passed along specific classified information,
which is necessary to prove espionage. A grand jury, meanwhile, had
examined his finances in an attempt to trace any Soviet payments.
   If Bloch is fired, he will be branded a violator of U.S.
national security.
   Spokesman Richard Boucher, confirming an account in The
Washington Times, said Thursday Bloch submitted his resignation on
July 5 and also withdrew a request for a hearing on the State
Department's attempt to fire him.
   ``The department has informed Mr. Bloch that it will continue
with the proceedings initiated last February to remove him from the
Foreign Service for national security reasons,'' Boucher said.
``The department will take no action on Mr. Bloch's tendered
resignation pending the outcome of these proceedings.''

<HEAD>Lawmakers Accuse Administration of Withholding Owl Information</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The administration suppressed a government
report that offered ways to reduce significantly the timber job
losses that would result from protection of the rare northern
spotted owl, two Northwest lawmakers say.
   Reps. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., and Jolene Unsoeld, D-Wash., said
Thursday the May 1 report was leaked to them by ``a source in the
administration.''
   The White House declined comment. A spokesman for Interior
Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. said the report was an internal document
that never was intended for release.
   ``They are just playing partisan politics,'' said the spokesman,
Steve Goldstein.
   The report prepared by the Forest Service, an arm of the
Agriculture Department, and the Bureau of Land Management, part of
the Interior Department, outlines ways to save as many as 21,000
timber jobs by, among other things, adding new restrictions on log
exports and boosting spending on Forest Service programs, DeFazio
said.
   He said it was prepared for release at the same time the two
agencies projected that one controversial plan to save the owl
would cut timber harvests in the region by nearly 50 percent and
cost the region more than 28,000 jobs by the end of the decade.

<HEAD>U.S. Peacekeeping Force Proposed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The foreign minister of Liberia and other
prominent Liberians say their president will soon resign and leave
the country and asked for a temporary U.S. peacekeeping force in
the war torn nation.
   A State Department official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the department received the appeal and may respond in some way
today.
   Foreign Minister J. Rudolph Johnson, Washington Ambassador
Eugenia Wordsworth-Stevenson and eight other Liberians wrote
President Bush Thursday that they expect the ``resignation and
departure from Liberia'' of President Samuel Doe ``and the
establishment of an interim government.''
   The letter proposed that ``a limited U.S. force be provided, on
the invitation of that interim government, to play an initial
peacekeeping role'' in the vicinity of Monrovia, the capital now
under siege by rebel forces.
   The appeal did not explain how the resignation and departure of
Doe would be carried out. While agreeing not to seek re-election,
the president has refused to leave the country and is sitting out
the approach of rebel forces in his heavily fortified residence in
Monrovia.
   The State Department said the letter was being studied by its
task force monitoring the crisis in the African nation founded by
freed American slaves 150 years ago.
   The letter and its signatures were regarded as authentic, the
U.S. official said.
   U.S. warships with Marine units embarked were moved close to
Liberia several weeks ago.
   Ambassador Wordsworth-Stevenson and former Liberian U.N.
Ambassador Winston A. Tubman, listed as a press spokesman, did not
answer their telephones Thursday night.
   Without foreign peacekeepers, victory ``by any faction'' will
not end the civil war and ``is far more likely to trigger a more
violent ethnic-based bloodbath,'' the letter said.
   This is because the war has spawned ``rival armed factions now
threatening the capital, has inflamed tribal animosities and
endangered the whole country as never before,`` it said.
   ``Liberians are now at the mercy of advancing bands of
foreign-armed combatants, each with its own agenda and none capable
of averting massive plunder and tribal revenge,'' the letter added,
not naming the arms providers.
   Because of its moral authority in Liberia going back to the
country's founding, ``the United States is uniquely positioned,
with minimum risk, manpower and expense to halt the breakdown of
law and order in Liberia and prevent even worse carnage,'' the
letter said.
   ``Neighboring African states can thereafter play, as it is
intended they should, a more sustained peacekeeping role,'' it
added.
   ``This crucial help would not be viewed as colonial paternalism,
Mr. President,`` the appeal said. ``It would be welcomed by all
Liberians as the generous assistance of ...the same friend that
helped create Liberia nearly a century-and-a-half ago and has been
our constitutional ideal ever since.''
   Hopes for reform ``have turned to dust'' under Doe, who took
power in a 1980 coup, the letter said. The rebels accuse his
government of corruption, mismanagement and widespread abuse of
human rights.
   Other signers of the letter were Tubman, former armed forces
chief George Toe Washington, former Customs Commissioner George
Toukolon, former Post and Telecommunications Minister Abdulai
Vandi, former Commerce Minister A. Romeo Horton, Senator Hilary F.
Gbunblee, former Justice Minister Lawrence A. Morgan and Winifred
Massaqquoi, former student adviser at the Liberian Embassy in
Washington.

<HEAD>Key Dates in Frank Ethics Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Here are some key dates in the ethics
investigation into Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass.:
   _July 1985. After paying male prostitute Stephen Gobie for sex,
Frank hires Gobie, using personal funds, as a housekeeper and
driver, hoping to change his way of life.
   _May 1987. In response to a reporter's question, Frank publicly
acknowledges for the first time that he is gay.
   _August 1987. Frank ends his relationship with Gobie after
learning that Gobie was running a prostitution ring out of Frank's
Capitol Hill apartment. Gobie later claims Frank was aware of the
prostitution all along and that claim becomes a major issue in the
ethics case.
   _November 1988. Frank wins election to a fifth term by a 70-30
margin.
   _Aug. 25, 1989. The Washington Times reports that Frank paid
Gobie for sex and hired him to do chores. It is the first public
word of Frank's relationship with Gobie.
   _Sept. 10, 1989. A Boston Sunday Globe editorial calls on Frank
to resign for ``his own good, and for the good of his constituents,
his causes and Congress.''
   _Sept. 11, 1989. The House ethics committee votes to conduct an
investigation into Frank's relationship with Gobie. Frank says he
won't resign and will decide his political plans after the
committee completes its investigation. He apologizes to his
constituents for ``some serious mistakes in judgment several years
ago. What I did was wrong.'' He says in a Newsweek interview that
Gobie was not the first prostitute he hired.
   _Oct. 20, 1989. The Washington Times reports that Gobie claims
he and Frank had sex in the House gymnasium. Frank denies it.
   _Oct. 30, 1989. The ethics committee holds the first of several
closed-door meetings on the Frank case.
   _Dec. 5, 1989. Gobie testifies.
   _Jan. 23, 1990. Rep. William Dannemeyer, R-Calif., says he plans
to demand that the House cast a roll-call vote on a proposal to
expel Frank.
   _Feb. 6, 1990. Penthouse magazine publishes an interview of
Gobie, who received $50,000 from the magazine, that breaks little
new ground.
   _April 17, 1990. Frank announces plans to seek a sixth term.
   _April 25-26, 1990. The ethics committee holds two marathon
sessions. Sources indicate that Democrats want to issue Frank a
letter reproving his conduct; Republicans are said to be pushing
for a tougher sanction.
   _May 10, 1990. A former prostitute testifies before the
committee after alleging publicly that Frank knew the sex-for-hire
ring was being operated from his apartment. Frank denies it,
producing an affidavit from his landlady that she believed Frank
was unaware of the prostitution.
   _July 19, 1990. The ethics committee recommends that the House
reprimand Frank.

<HEAD>Court Rules in Favor of Newspapers in Confidential Source Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY R. SANDOK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A newspaper cannot be held liable for
breaking a promise of confidentiality to a source, Minnesota's
highest court ruled today in rejecting a $700,000 award against the
state's two biggest daily papers.
   Lawyers for both sides agreed the 4-2 ruling by the state
Supreme Court has far-reaching implications for the nation's news
organizations.
   The court rejected a jury's award of $200,000 in compensatory
damages and $500,000 in punitive damages to Dan Cohen.
   Cohen had sued the Saint Paul Pioneer Press and the Star Tribune
of Minneapolis for 1982 stories identifying him as the source of
documents showing a Democratic candidate for lieutenant governor
had been convicted of shoplifting 12 years earlier.
   Cohen, then a Republican gubernatorial candidate's consultant,
had given the newspapers' reporters the information in return for
assurances of confidentiality. But the newspapers' editors
overruled the reporters, believing readers should know the
information came from the GOP candidate's campaign.
   The Supreme Court today upheld an appeals court's dismissal of
Cohen's claim of fraudulent misrepresentation, but reversed that
court's ruling allowing him to claim breach of contract.
   ``To impose a contract theory on this arrangement puts an
unwarranted legal rigidity on a special ethical relationship,
precluding necessary consideration of factors underlying that
ethical relationship,'' Associate Justice John Simonett wrote.
   The court also said enforcement of the promise of
confidentiality under a doctrine that implies a legal contract
where none exists would violate the newspapers' First Amendment
rights.
   The case involved ``the classic First Amendment context of ... a
political source involved in a political campaign,'' the majority
wrote.
   ``It's a very important case, one with far-reaching
implications,'' said Cohen's lawyer, Elliot Rothenberg. ``The issue
is, to what extent do newspapers and the media have a
constitutional right to violate promises to which everyone else in
society would be held liable?''
   Rothenberg said he would appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.
   The Associated Press filed the only friend-of-the-court brief in
the case. Louise Sommers, an attorney for the AP, called the ruling
a major victory for the news media.
   Cohen's victory at trial had produced a spate of similar
lawsuits around the country, the AP's attorneys said.
   Today's ruling is ``the first definitive opinion by a supreme
court of a state directly addressing'' the issues in Cohen's case,
said Dick Winfield, another attorney for the AP. He said the media
``can take considerable comfort'' in the decision.
   Cohen was doing public relations work for 1982 gubernatorial
candidate Wheelock Whitney when he gave reporters documents showing
that Marlene Johnson, a candidate for lieutenant governor, was
convicted of shoplifting in 1970.
   Johnson's conviction was vacated in 1971 with no sentence. She
was elected as Democratic Gov. Rudy Perpich's running mate in 1982,
was re-elected in 1986 and is running with Perpich this year.
   Editors at the newspapers testified that they believed the
public had a right to know the information about Johnson's past
came from the Whitney campaign.
   Reporters for the AP and WCCO-TV also promised Cohen anonymity
and received the documents. The AP published the story and honored
its promise; the TV station did not run the story.
   In rejecting Cohen's argument that he had a contract with the
newspapers, the Supreme Court said, ``We are not persuaded that in
the special milieu of media newsgathering a source and a reporter
ordinarily believe they are engaged in making a legally binding
contract.
   ``The parties understand that the reporter's promise of
anonymity is given as a moral commitment, but a moral obligation
alone will not support a contract,'' the court said.
   The court said it had to balance the constitutional rights of a
free press against the common-law interest of protecting a promise
of anonymity.
   ``The potentiality for civil damages for promises made in this
context chills public debate, a debate which Cohen willingly
entered albeit hoping to do so on his own terms,'' the court said.
``In this context, and considering the nature of the political
story involved, it seems to us that the law best leaves the parties
here to their trust in each other.''
   In a dissent, Associate Justice Lawrence Yetka said the result
of the ruling was to ``carve out yet another special privilege in
favor of the press that is denied other citizens.''
   Associate Justice Glenn Kelley, who also dissented, said the
decision ``serves to inhibit rather than to promote the objectives
of the First Amendment by `drying up' potential sources of
information on public matters.''
   Saint Paul Pioneer Press attorney Paul Hannah said the court
recognized the difficulties editors and reporters face in ``making
decisions about what voters are going to know about the candidates
and campaigns.''
   Star Tribune Executive Editor Joel R. Kramer said the newspaper
was ``especially pleased that the court has ruled that the decision
to publish true facts relating to the activities of `a political
source in a political campaign' is one that is protected by the
First Amendment.''

   United Flight 232 survivors wandered
pensively about the runway where a year ago their crippled jumbo
jet cartwheeled in flames, killing 112 of 296 people aboard.
   ``I want to see it without bodies and luggage and airplane parts
strewn all over,'' Brad Bayless of Littleton, Colo., said during a
reunion of survivors and victims' relatives on the crash
anniversary Thursday.
   Little evidence of the crash remains. The cornfield where the
wreckage came to rest is now planted in soybeans, the torn runway
has been patched and pieces of the shattered United Air Lines DC-10
are locked away in a hangar.
   Bayless and other survivors walked around the crash site and
into another cornfield, where they picked tassels as reminders.
   ``At first I thought, oh, no, they took away the corn because
they didn't want me to see it, to remember. But they explained it
was normal crop rotation,'' said Bayless' wife, Sharon. The couple
suffered minor injuries in the crash.
   Organizers of the reunion said 104 of the 184 people who
survived the crash returned for the gathering.
   ``I wanted my boys to know that Sioux City is a place where
normal things happen, that it's a place of mending as well as
catastrophe,'' said Brownell Bailey, of Bowmar, Colo. Bailey's
wife, Francie, died in the crash.
   Mrs. Bayless said: ``I have a lot of memories of some pretty
gruesome things, and we both feel guilty that we walked away
unharmed while so many others didn't. I knew it would be hard to
come back.
   ``But I realized I needed to feel some things that I have kept
under the surface over the last year, feelings like, was I really
here?''
   At a memorial service timed to coincide with the moment the
plane crashed, people huddled in a hangar at the Sioux Gateway
Airport to get out of heavy rain.
   Many cried quietly as the Rev. Gregory Clapper, a United
Methodist minister, led the survivors and families of victims in
part of the 23rd Psalm. Some survivors described feelings of guilt.
   When National Guard jets roared off to form a ``missing man''
formation, some put their hands over their ears and held their
fists to their mouths.
   They gave a standing ovation to Capt. Al C. Haynes, the pilot
who guided the crippled plane to the airport. Haynes' voice cracked
as he addressed the group.
   ``It's been an emotional roller coaster for all of us, but even
so, the remembering has been an important part of the healing
process,'' he said. ``But somehow, we must find a way to take them
(memories) away from our present and make them part of the past.''
   Pilots have marveled that Haynes got the jet even close to an
emergency landing after an engine shattered and severed the
hydraulic lines used to control the plane.
   Lori Michaelson used the reunion to call on Congress to require
child restraints on airliners. Currently, small children may sit on
their parents' laps.
   ``Let's have something positive come out of this crash,'' said
Ms. Michaelson, whose 11-month-old daughter, Sabrina, was torn from
her grasp in the crash. A passenger heard the baby's cries and
pulled her from the wreckage.

   The cars in this race whirred across the finish
line in the Motor City with faint whines and hums, not booming
exhausts and smoking tires.
   They were solar-powered, and the 11-day Florida-to-Detroit race
they completed Thursday gave a big boost to the technology that
harnesses the sun's energy, organizers and participants said.
   ``This race has definitely raised awareness of engineering and
science,'' said Bill Kaliardos, a member of the University of
Michigan's Sunrunner team, which won the 1,641-mile race. ``This is
about as good as engineering can get.''
   ``What these young people have learned will contribute to the
future technological developments in our country,'' said Robert C.
Stempel, president of General Motors Corp. The company sponsored
the GM Sunrayce USA along with the U.S. Energy Department and the
Society of Automotive Engineers.
   Sunlight glinted off the panels and heated the solar cells of
the lightweight, low-slung cars as they zipped across the race's
last leg.
   The cars _ just over 3 feet high but 19 feet long and 6.6 feet
across _ are designed to expose the maximum area of solar cells to
the sun and run on minimum power. In Sunrunner's case, that's 1.5
horsepower.
   The 575-pound Sunrunner finished in 72 hours, 50 minutes and 47
seconds, averaging 22.5 mph.
   The cars started July 9 at Disney World in Lake Buena Vista,
Fla., and traveled over secondary roads in Georgia, Alabama,
Tennessee, Kentucky, Indiana, Ohio and Michigan.
   GM is sending the top three finishers to Australia's World Solar
Challenge, a 2,000-mile race across the Australian outback from
Darwin to Adelaide. It starts Nov. 11.
   Western Washington University's Viking XX finished second and
the University of Maryland's Pride of Maryland was third.
   Viking XX was one of just three two-passenger vehicles in the
race.
   ``It's very radical,'' said Bill Lingenfelter, 23, an industrial
technology student and the Viking XX team captain.
   Student engineer-racers said they hope to change the face of the
auto industry _ and further their own careers.
   ``I love cars,'' said Susan Fancy, 27, a mechanical engineering
student who was Sunrunner's project manager. ``I'm interested in
the environment and alternative power vehicles. I'm hoping to work
for one of the Big Three.''

   The new Nixon library and birthplace
is open today for the people of his hometown and everyone else
curious about the successes and failures of the first president to
resign his office.
   It requires only $3.95 for adults, and children can get in free
to examine subjects ranging from Richard Nixon's triumph in China
to aspects of the Watergate scandal that forced the 37th president
from office.
   President Bush and former Presidents Ford and Reagan were among
guests at Thursday's dedication of the library.
   Bush gave advice to those who visit the museum, which chronicles
Nixon's career from his first run for Congress, through his
resignation and his post-White House life.
   ``Look at Richard Nixon the man,'' said Bush. ``He was an author
... he worked in the most pragmatic of arenas, yet insisted that
`politics is poetry, not prose.' He believed in love of country,
and in God _ in loyalty to friends, and protecting loved ones.''
   Fifty thousand spectators turned out for the dedication,
according to police estimates and the count from metal detectors at
the library.
   The $21 million library was built with private funds and will
receive no federal funds to operate. Many donors attended a fancy
black-tie party Thursday night in Los Angeles, wrapping up the
celebration.
   Those guests arriving at the front door of the Century Plaza
Hotel were confronted by several hundred demonstrators, espousing
causes as varied as pro-choice in abortion to AIDS research and the
war in El Salvador.
   Fourteen demonstrators were arrested.
   Guests were carefully screened and those without invitations
were turned away. That included reporters, who have never been
favorites of Nixon and his supporters.
   ``Much has been written and said about Richard Nixon _ some has
even been true,'' Ronald Reagan said in his speech at the
dedication. ``Journalists, historians, political pundits and just
plain folks will talk for decades about his career and what it
meant to our country and the world.
   ``It will come as no surprise to anyone here that there will
always be a good deal of debate about Richard Nixon.''
   Gerald Ford, got a laugh from the crowd by turning to each of
the men who have occupied the Oval Office and saying ``Mr.
President, Mr. President, Mr. President.''
   He said Nixon was proof that ``you can come home again.''
   The only living former president who was not there was Jimmy
Carter, who also is the only Democrat in the bunch. He sent regrets.
   The word Watergate was mentioned only once, and that was by
Bush, in passing. Bush called Watergate the ``seventh crisis,'' a
reference to ``Six Crises'' the first of Nixon's eight books.
   ``Mr. President, you worked with every fiber of your being to
help achieve `A Generation of Peace,''' Bush told Nixon. ``Today,
as the movement toward democracy sweeps our globe, you can take
great pride that history will say of you: `Here was a true
architect of peace.'''
   For Nixon, the dedication was a triumphant day, one widely
regarded as a milestone in his 16-year effort to overcome the
disgrace of the Watergate scandal in which burglars broke into the
Democratic headquarters, spurring a White House cover up.
   ``Over the past years, Pat and I have had the opportunity to
visit some wonderful places,'' Nixon told the crowd. ``But nothing
we have ever seen matches this moment _ to be welcomed home again
so warmly on this day by our friends in California.''

   The chairman of the state Republican
Party dismissed Democratic calls for Sen. Dave Durenberger to
resign now that a Senate committee has recommended that the full
Senate denounce him.
   Other state Republicans agreed, but said it's too early to tell
how much the senator's chances of re-election in 1994 have been
hurt.
   The Senate Ethics Committee said Thursday that Durenberger
violated Senate rules by laundering speaking fees through a book
contract and claiming reimbursement for staying in a Minneapolis
condominium in which he owned an interest.
   The panel recommended the full Senate denounce Durenberger for
``reprehensible'' financial conduct and require him to make
restitution.
   State GOP Chairman Bob Weinholzer said most callers to party
headquarters supported Durenberger.
   ``There have been a few callers who said they think he should
resign, but that was the minority,'' Weinholzer said.
   Lois West, Durenberger's press secretary, said most people who
called the senator's Washington office also were supportive.
   ``We're getting a lot of calls of support, and a few who say
things like, `Get out of town,' '' West said. ``But they are
overwhelmingly supportive.''
   Democratic Senate candidate Paul Wellstone said denouncement by
one's colleagues is a ``real disgrace'' that would make it
difficult for Durenberger to be an effective lawmaker.
   ``The people back here in Minnesota should figure in
somewhere,'' Wellstone said. ``What makes sense is for Dave
Durenberger to resign and the governor to appoint a caretaker
senator and for us to have an election in November. And if
Durenberger wants to run again, he should.''
   In Washington, Republican Sen. Rudy Boschwitz said he hopes that
``we are close to the point where David can put these mistakes
behind him and get back to being the strong, effective senator for
Minnesota that he has been for the past 11 years.''
   Weinholzer said calls for Durenberger's resignation were
``nonsense.''
   ``Some of these charges already were known to the electorate in
1988,'' when Durenberger won re-election to a 6-year term, he said.
``If he were to resign now, he would be disenfranchising those
voters.''
   If Durenberger were to step aside and then win re-election this
November, he would lose the seniority he earned during nearly 12
years in the Senate, Weinholzer said.

   Hot, humid weather prevailed in the East early today, a hazy
prelude to intense, gusty thunderstorms. Parts of the Midwest got
rain and the Southwest was in for more heat.
   A wide line of storms was expected to be strongest in the Ohio
Valley and New England. Sunshine mixed with cloudy skies was
forecast for the Southeast, followed by spotty showers that also
were to plague portions of Texas and Louisiana.
   Much of the United States was rained on Thursday.
   Thunderstorms in Ohio flooded streets and knocked out power.
Lightning killed a 57-year-old maintenance man as he worked outside.
   A state of emergency was declared in flooded Sutton, Neb., after
more than 9 inches of rain drenched the area, forcing the
evacuation of homes and flooding streets.
   Iowa also had some street flooding Thursday. High winds tore
down trees and covered roads with water in south-central New York
state.
   The high temperatures Thursday in the Lower 48 states was 116
degrees in the Arizona towns of Bullhead City and Lake Havasu City
and in Laughlin, Nev.

<HEAD>U.S. Secretary of State to Visit Mongolia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mongolia said today that U.S. Secretary of State
James Baker will pay a visit next month, becoming the first
high-level American envoy to do so since the two countries
established diplomatic relations in 1987.
   Among other things, Baker will sign an agreement for American
Peace Corps volunteers to work in the remote, Soviet-bloc nation,
said Tepbishiin Chimeddorg, spokesman for Mongolia's Foreign
Ministry.
   His announcement, made at a news conference in the Mongolian
capital of Ulan Bator, was reported by China's official Xinhua News
Agency.
   Chimeddorg said Baker will visit from Aug. 2-5. He will sign an
agreement on consular affairs and discuss a range of political,
economic and trade matters with Mongolian leaders, the spokesman
said.
   The State Department already had announced that Baker will
attend a July 30 meeting in Singapore on Pacific economic
cooperation, and will meet Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Schevardnadze in the Soviet city of Irkutsk on Aug. 1. Irkutsk is
in Siberia about 140 miles north of Mongolia.
   It appeared that Baker would not stop in Beijing.
   The Chinese capital is a main gateway to Ulan Bator, and it
normally would have been natural for Baker to spend a day in
Beijing en route north. However, the United States still has not
announced a resumption of high-level visits to China, halted since
China used the army to crush the nation's pro-democracy movement in
June 1989.
   China's Foreign Ministry spokesman, Jin Guihua, said last week
he had no information on any plans by Baker to visit.
   Mongolia, the world's second-oldest communist nation, has
undergone dramatic political changes in the past year. Spurred by
reforms in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, young urban
Mongolians began street protests last winter that led to the
resignation of top Communist Party and government leaders.
   The party voted to allow opposition parties after seven decades
of monopoly rule, and to separate its functions from those of the
government. The first multiparty elections in Mongolian history are
scheduled for July 29. Primaries are to be held Sunday.
   The United States joined the six other leading industrialized
democracies at the Houston summit this month in welcoming movement
toward greater political openness in Mongolia.

<HEAD>Legislation Proposed to Abolish Flogging</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government today proposed legislation to
abolish flogging as a means of punishing male criminals.
   The proposal will be debated by the law-making Legislative
Council in October, and the government said it hoped flogging would
be abolished this year.
   The punishment, administered with a light cane, was introduced
in Hong Kong in the heyday of the British empire. Its use has
declined in recent years; Hong Kong courts ordered only two
floggings last year, compared with 476 in 1952, officials said.
   Under existing laws, only men can be flogged. The number of
strokes range from 18 for offenders age 17 or older to six for
offenders under 14.
   A court can order floggings for offenses that include indecent
assault, robbery, rape of a woman under 16, weapons possession and
piracy.
   Flogging was abolished in Britain about four decades ago, and
the Hong Kong government has been encouraged to end the practice
because of international criticism.

   Gold prices also moved down.
   Traders said there weren't any new factors in the market to

<HEAD>Long-Delayed Nuclear Plant Reaches Full Power</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOINA CHIACU</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SEABROOK, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Seabrook nuclear plant, focus of
debate over atomic energy, has reached full power for the first
time.
   The $6.6 billion reactor _ among the nation's most expensive _
went to full throttle at 9:52 p.m. Thursday, plant spokesman Ron
Sher said. The plant generated 1,150 megawatts, electricity for 1
million New England homes.
   It's the most important milestone yet for the decade-late
project and another setback for anti-nuclear activists whose mass
civil disobedience demonstrations had made Seabrook a symbol of
their movement.
   ``Reaching full power fulfills the dream we have all worked so
hard to achieve,'' said Edward Brown, president of the plant's
operator, New Hampshire Yankee.
   For plant opponents, the milestone was the latest in a series of
disappointments since the Nuclear Regulatory Commission gave
Seabrook a commercial operating license in March.
   ``What they're doing now is another step in the long process of
the abuse of power,'' said Roy Morrison of the anti-nuclear
Clamshell Alliance. ``It's a complete disregard of the public
safety. The plant is unsafe. It's operating in a place where there
is no evacuation possible.''
   The project, conceived 22 years ago, is located less than two
miles from Hampton Beach, New Hampshire's most popular summer
resort. The peak summertime population within Seabrook's 10-mile
emergency planning zone is estimated at nearly 250,000.
   The NRC and Seabrook supporters say evacuation plans would
adequately protect the public in the unlikely event of a serious
accident.
   Plant supporters include White House Chief of Staff John Sununu,
who as New Hampshire governor during the 1980s helped keep the
project afloat despite financial troubles. The lead owner, Public
Service Company of New Hampshire, finally had to take bankruptcy
refuge in January 1988 because of Seabrook delays.
   Opponents were led by Gov. Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts,
which has six communities within 10 miles of Seabrook. Dukakis
contended that evacuation wouldn't be feasible, considering the
beach crowds and limited roads in the area.
   Many people interviewed on the beaches near Seabrook this week
have placed their trust, willingly or otherwise, in plant operators.
   ``I think they got everything pretty much under control or they
wouldn't be going up to full power,'' said Tom McDermott, 28, of
Lowell, Mass. ``I guess I'm just relying on them to take care of
it, to let us know if something's wrong.''
   Public Service proposed a nuclear power project in 1968 but
shelved it the next year, then proposed Seabrook in 1972 as a
twin-reactor plant with a cost of less than $1 billion. The first
reactor was planned for commercial operation in 1979, the second in
1981.
   Anti-nuclear acitivists began using civil disobedience to
publicize their cause in 1976. A protest that resulted in more than
1,400 arrests in May 1977 was, at the time, the largest ever
against an American nuclear plant. In all, anti-Seabrook
demonstrations have resulted in more than 3,200 arrests.
   Construction delays and billions of dollars in cost overruns
forced owners to scrap Seabrook 2 in the mid-1980s.

   Rebel soldiers who led a coup attempt
against President Corazon Aquino in December offered a truce today
to help relief efforts following this week's killer earthquake.
   ``We call on the present leadership to set aside all political
differences in order to squarely face this catastrophe,'' the
underground Revolutionary Alliance of the Masses-Soldiers of the
Filipino People said in a statement.
   Monday's earthquake, which measured 7.7 on the Richter Scale,
was the strongest to hit the country in 14 years and officials say
hundreds of people were killed.
   The rebel group said its members were prepared to help in the
relief effort but asked that the government agree to a ``temporary
and finite'' halt to the search and capture of rebel members.
   It said the rebels have declared a unilateral stop to all
anti-government activities ``during this time of national tragedy.''
   The statement was signed by former Lt. Col. Gregorio ``Gringo''
Honasan, who led the August 1987 coup attempt and was among key
leaders of the last coup attempt.
   The December attempt left at least 113 people dead and more than
600 injured. It was the sixth and most serious bid by rebellious
soldiers to topple Mrs. Aquino since she took power after a
``people power revolution'' ousted the late Ferdinand Marcos in
1986.

   A court decision this week throwing out convictions
in a terrorist bombing has added to public frustration that judges
and investigators have failed to pin down the blame in several
attacks in the past 20 years.
   An appeals court on Wednesday overturned the convictions of four
people sentenced to life in prison two years ago for the 1980
bombing that killed 85 people at Bologna's train station.
   The verdict meant investigators are back to square one in trying
to solve one of Europe's worst terrorist acts a full decade after
it occurred.
   ``How shameful for the state,'' said Il Messaggero, a moderate
Rome newspaper, in a front-page editorial. The leading Milan daily
Corriere della Sera called Italy ``a country without truth.''
   Some commentators blamed investigative incompetence, political
interference and the dark deeds of a secret service that may have
compromised the truth forever.
   The Bologna bombing was only the latest in a series of major
cases dating back more than 20 years that have gone unsolved.
   They include the bombing at a Milan bank in 1969 that left 16
dead and ushered in more than a decade of terrorism from the left
and right, bomb blasts in the city of Brescia and on trains in the
1970s and the mysterious crash of an Italian jetliner in 1980 that
killed all 81 aboard.
   In the Milan bombing there were arrests and at least three
trials, but in the end the suspects were acquitted. A trial of
Brescia suspects ended in acquittal. There were arrests in at least
one of the train bombings in the 1970s, but a trial never
determined the perpetrators.
   There have been no arrests in the plane crash. And experts have
still failed to make a firm determination on the cause _ whether a
bomb exploded aboard or whether it was downed by a missile fired by
an unidentified plane.
   Adding to the anguish of the victims' relatives, the judge
investigating the crash has just quit the case over a dispute with
a Socialist politician regarding his handling of it.
   ``Before the Bologna verdict, Italians were diffident if not
distrustful toward the system of justice,'' said Franco Ferrarotti,
a University of Rome sociologist in a telephone interview.
   ``The verdict has delivered a powerful blow to the relationship
between citizens and institutions in Italy,'' he said.
   Prosecutors in the Bologna case described the attack as a
neo-Fascist plot to undermine Italy's democracy and the four
convicted of planting the bomb as right-wing terrorists.
   Seemingly strengthening this theory was the indictment and
conviction in the first trial of Licio Gelli, former grandmaster of
the secret Propaganda Due (P-2) Masonic lodge which had been
accused of seeking to install a right-wing dictatorship with the
help of secret service officials.
   Gelli had been given 10 years in prison on charges of misleading
investigators, but he was also acquitted by the appeals court.
   The technique seemed to fit the pattern attributed to Italy's
neo-Fascist gangs: striking at masses of people in the city that is
the heart of Communist Party strength.
   Leftist terrorists were said to be more selective in their
targets, aiming at individual politicians or businessmen.
   It was in this highly politicized atmosphere that the trials in
the Bologna case were held. The Communist Party reponded to the
verdict Thursday by leaving the front page of its party newspaper
blank but for a photo of a rescue worker carrying a victim of the
train station bombing.
   Sociologist Ferrarotti said other countries carry the burden of
doubt-creating crimes, pointing to the theories on the 1963
assassination of President John F. Kennedy. ``But other countries
make an attempt to deal out justice swiftly.''
   It took six years to complete the investigation of the Bologna
bombing and two more years to bring it to trial. The appeals court
handed down its verdict just a few seeks before the 10th
anniversary of the bombing on Aug. 2.
   ``I don't know what was behind the reversal of the verdict,''
said a bitter Paolo Bolognesi, spokesman for the families of the
victims. ``I only know this this the court's anniversary present.''
   The trials have served as an unpleasant reminder of the dark
days of terrorism, in sharp contrast to the economic boom and
relative social peace enjoyed by Italians over the last decade.
   Leftist terrorism, responsible for the kidnapping and killing of
former Premier Aldo Moro in 1978, was crushed when dozens of the
urban guerrillas decided to turn state's evidence.
   ``The rich Italy of today will have to come to terms with its
past sooner or later,'' said the Il Messaggero editorial. ``A true
democracy can't exist with so many dark areas.''

<HEAD>Judge Rules Trump Can Be Questioned About Extramarital Affair</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge ruled that Donald Trump can be
questioned by attorneys representing his estranged wife, Ivana,
about an alleged extramarital affair.
   Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Phyllis Gangel-Jacob ruled on
Thursday that Trump would have to divulge his intentions toward
Marla Maples when he and Mrs. Trump updated a prenuptial agreement
in December 1987.
   Mrs. Trump contends she was tricked into signing papers that
would give her $25 million if she and Trump divorced.
   She said she would not have signed the agreement had she been
aware of his ``adultery and philandering.''
   The judge also ruled that Trump would not have to discuss his
relationship with Maples after the 1987 agreement.
   The agreement, which Trump attorney Jay Goldberg has called
ironclad, was fraudulently obtained, according to Mrs. Trump's
lawyer, Michael Kennedy.
   The New York Post reported today that Mrs. Trump revealed in
court papers obtained Thursday, that her relationship with Trump
began to sour four years ago.
   ``In 1986, he mentioned that he thought an open marriage might
be interesting, but he knew I was too old-fashioned a girl to even
tolerate any other sexual relationship or affair,'' she said.
   ``He did not tell me that ... he was seeing another woman and
having an affair with her,'' she said.
   Mrs. Trump had also sought to have the contract nullified
because of alleged adultery by Trump after December 1987.
   Trump's attorney, Goldberg, told the Daily News that decision is
``extremely valuable to Mr. Trump's cause and solidifies his
position that the 1987 agreement will be upheld.''

<TEXT>
   The prime minister has appointed nine men and
a woman to a new Cabinet that will assume power July 28 and include
politicians representing a wide diversity of opinions and platforms.
   Prime Minister Juan Carlos Hurtado announced the 10 appointments
Thursday and said the ministers of labor, justice and industry
would be announced later.
   The 10 ministers represent a range of political parties and
reflect President-elect Alberto Fujimori's plans for a government
of conciliation that will replace that of President Alan Garcia.
   Fujimori, of the centrist Change 90 party, on Wednesday named
Hurtado, a former agriculture minister, to be his prime minister
and economics minister. Hurtado had announced his resignation from
the center-right Popular Action party Wednesday morning.
   Fujimori's choice of Hurtado was the strongest indication yet
that in order to satisfy foreign creditors the new president will
pursue a more market-oriented economic policy than he spoke of
during his campaign.
   Before the June 10 election, Fujimori sharply criticized the
type of market-oriented ``economic shock therapy'' advocated by his
opponent, novelist Mario Vargas Llosa.
   The Cabinet members named Thursday were: Luis Marchand, current
ambassador to Chile, as foreign minister; Fernando Sanchez as
energy minister; Carlos Amat y Leon as agriculture minister; Dr.
Carlos Vidal as health minister; Eduardo Toledo as transportation
and communications minister.
   Army Gen. Rodrigo Alvarado was named as interior minister; Army
Gen. Jorge Torres as defense minister; Gloria Helfer as education
minister; Retired Navy Admiral Raul Sanchez as fisheries minister;
and Guillermo del Solar as housing and construction minister.
   Hurtado said the people selected to head the ministries of
industry and justice were out of the country and that their names
would be announced later.
   Hurtado said a labor minister had not been selected, and that he
planned to consult with labor leaders before making that choice.
   Alvarado was the most controversial appointment. As head of the
Interior Ministry he will oversee the national police forces, and
analysts say the appointment could aggravate the longstanding
rivalry between Peru's police and military.
   The rivalry is strongest in the country's emergency zones, where
the military has been given broad powers to fight leftist
guerrillas. More than one-third of the country is currently under
emergency regulations.
   The two major leftist guerrilla groups fighting the government
are the Maoist-inspired Shining Path and the pro-Cuban Tupac Amaru
Revolutionary Movement.

   Richard T. Boggs meditated to calm himself
as he sat in the electric chair for 12 minutes before he was
executed for the 1984 murder and robbery of an elderly neighbor.
   Head tilted back and eyes closed, Boggs walked slowly into the
death chamber at 10:50 p.m. Thursday. He appeared sedated, but
state Department of Corrections spokesman Wayne Farrar said Boggs,
27, had not taken any tranquilizers.
   ``He was meditating,'' said Farrar. ``He was into meditation.''
   Guards strapped Boggs into the wooden chair in the basement of
the State Penitentiary, placed a brown leather mask over his face
and attached electrodes to the crown of his head and his right calf.
   Comforted by prison chaplain Russ Ford, Boggs, his shaven head
still tilted backward, occasionally touched thumb to fingers on his
upwardly cupped hands as he waited for his execution, which took
place shortly after 11 p.m.
   Prison officials said that condemned prisoners are usually not
kept waiting on the chair but had no immediate explanation for the
delay.
   Earlier in the evening, Gov. L. Douglas Wilder refused to
commute Boggs' sentence to life in prison after the U.S. Supreme
Court denied a stay.
   The execution was the first during the 6-month-old
administration of Wilder, a former death penalty opponent who
successfully pushed for an expansion of the state's capital
punishment law this year.
   Boggs was sentenced to death for the Jan. 25, 1984, robbery and
slaying of his Portsmouth neighbor, Treeby M. Shaw, 87, whom he had
known all his life.
   She had just poured tea for Boggs when he beat her with a metal
bar and stabbed her because he needed money for drugs, he told
police. He took diamond rings from her fingers and family silver
from the house.
   Boggs' back arched as he was hit with the first 2,500-volt surge
of electricity. The electricity was administered for 55 seconds,
stopped for 5 seconds and turned on for an additional 55 seconds.
   Boggs, who had no final words, was pronounced dead at 11:07 p.m.
   The execution was the ninth since Virginia resumed executions in
1982 and the 135th nationwide since the Supreme Court reinstituted
the death penalty in 1976. It was the 15th this year.
   U.S. District Judge Richard L. Williams turned down Boggs'
request for a stay of execution Thursday morning and a three-judge
panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the ruling
late in the afternoon.
   Defense lawyers claimed the state's electric chair might
malfunction and that Boggs suffers from brain damage.
   Boggs' attorney, David Bruck, told Williams that Virginia's
electric chair is virtually identical to the one in Florida that
malfunctioned during the electrocution of Jesse Tafero in May.
Flames and smoke appeared from under the man's head covering.
   Florida officials contend that the problem was that a synthetic
sponge rather than a natural sponge was used under the hood. They
have replaced the sponge, but defense attorneys who argue that the
chair is still not fixed are continuing to raise objections to
executions in that state.

   Burma's most prominent opposition
leader marked a year under house arrest today, and the military
government sent troops and armored cars into the streets to quash
any calls for her freedom.
   Burma's military rulers were overwhelmingly defeated in May 27
elections, but have so far refused to hand over power or free Aung
San Suu Kyi, whose National League for Democracy won the balloting.
   Ms. Suu Kyi was put under house arrest July 20, 1989, after the
government accused her of subversion. A government spokesman said
at that time she would serve a one-year term, which could be
renewed.
   There was no word from the government today on prospects for her
release.
   Diplomats contacted by telephone said troops with automatic
rifles and armored cas patrolled the streets of the Burmese
capital, Rangoon, apparently to deter rallies by Ms. Suu Kyi's
supporters.
   Security was especially tight around her lakeside compound, they
said.
   On Thursday, 150 youths staged a march in Rangoon, shouting for
Ms. Suu Kyi's release and hoisting the National League for
Democracy's symbol.
   The league has asked the government to release Ms. Suu Kyi, but
has also been trying since the election to avoid antagonizing the
military.
   A military spokesman has said the government would not bow to
foreign pressure for her release.
   In a July 13 letter, 39 members of the U.S. Congress and 19
senators urged military leader Gen. Saw Maung to hold a dialogue
with civilian political parties and rapidly transfer power.
   The U.S. lawmakers called on the Burmese government to lift
martial law, free all political prisoners including Ms. Suu Kyi and
take steps to ensure basic human rights are protected.
   Ms. Suu Kyi was a leader of the national pro-democracy uprisings
that military officers crushed in September 1988 by killing
hundreds of people.
   The May elections were the first multiparty balloting allowed in
three decades. The military severely restricted campaigning by the
opposition, but Ms. Suu Kyi's party still won 396 of the 485 seats
in Parliament.
   Thursday's protest came hours after a peaceful commemoration of
Martyrs Day, which marks the the assassination 43 years ago of
independence leaders. Those leaders include Gen. Aung San, Ms. Suu
Kyi's father.
   Small groups of high school students staged demonstrations in
the city Tuesday and Wednesday calling for her release, a Western
diplomat said.

<HEAD>Woman Settles $30 Million Lawsuit Against TV Personality</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorneys say they have settled out of court a
$30 million lawsuit filed against television personality Geraldo
Rivera by a woman who was arrested during a drug raid carried live
on national television.
   Terry Rouse, 32, of suburban Channelview filed the libel suit
against Rivera in 1987 stemming from the Dec. 2, 1986, telecast of
``American Vice: The Doping of a Nation.''
   The settlement, involving an undisclosed amount of money, came
after Rivera was questioned for six hours during a deposition
Thursday.
   Before the settlement, Rivera had said he suspected the lawsuit
was pursued by attorneys ``with greedy motives.''
   The lawsuit was scheduled to go to trial Aug. 20. State District
Judge Ann Cochran on Thursday ordered Rivera to turn over a copy of
his most recent financial data, but she also ordered that it would
remain confidential.
   Dale Jefferson, attorney for Ms. Rouse, speculated the other
side settled because it did not savor discussing Rivera's salary in
open court.
   During the 1986 program, Rivera was broadcasting live outside a
duplex where Ms. Rouse was staying when Harris County Sheriff
Johnny Klevenhagen and several deputies raided the home. Rivera
said that the people inside were an alleged pimp and prostitute who
were supplying drugs to truckers.
   Ms. Rouse was dragged from the duplex and handcuffed as an
estimated 15 million viewers watched, she said in the lawsuit.
   Ms. Rouse has maintained she was hired to paint the house, which
belonged to a friend. Cocaine possession charges against her
stemming from the televised bust were later dismissed.
   Attorney Wayne Fisher, representing Rivera and the production
companies, said the settlement was the result of ``all the parties
sitting down together in one place.''

<TEXT>
   A strict, low-fat vegetarian diet can reverse
damage caused by heart disease, according to the findings of an
American study published in the weekly British medical magazine The
Lancet.
   ``The Lifestyle Heart Trial'' was conducted on 41 heart disease
patients by the Preventive Medicine Research Institute in
Sausalito, Calif.
   The study found that 82 percent of the heart disease patients
who adopted such a diet, quit smoking and attended
stress-management classes reversed their coronary artery blockages.
   ``What we're finding is that heart disease may be completely
preventable for most people if they are willing to make changes in
their lifestyle,'' the study's coordinator, Dr. Dean Ornish, said
in a telephone interview.
   The patients, all from the San Francisco area, were recruited
from Pacific Presbyterian Medical Center and from Moffitt Hospital
at the University of California at San Francisco for the study,
published in Lancet's July 21 issue.
   The 41, aged 35-75, were randomly divided into two groups.
   The experimental group comprised 22 of the 41. The 22 followed a
low-fat vegetarian diet, took regular exercise, attended stress
management classes and did not smoke. Eighteen of the 22, or 82
percent of the group, showed an overall reversal in coronary artery
blockages, the study found.
   The other 19 among the 41 were assigned to a control group which
followed the standard program recommended for people suffering from
coronary artery disease _ a diet of 30 percent fat, moderate
excercise and no smoking.
   Ten of the 19 _ 53 percent of the control group _ experienced a
worsening of their artery blockages, the study found.
   ``This finding suggests that conventional recommendations don't
go far enough for many people,'' Ornish said. ``The guidelines may
be enough to prevent heart disease but not to reverse it.''
   The low-fat vegetarian diet included fruits, vegetables, grains
and beans, the report said.
   The only animal products allowed were egg whites and a cup a day
of non-fat milk or yogurt. Cholesterol intake was limited to five
milligrams a day and caffeine was eliminated. Alcohol was limited
to two units a day, although drinking was not encouraged.
   The study took place over a year. Ornish said follow-up testing
will continue for four years to see whether blockages continue to
reverse.

<HEAD>US Team Heading for Angola to Discuss Food Aid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An American team is heading to Luanda at the
invitation of Angola's Marxist government to discuss how to get
food aid to all areas of the country, including those held by
U.S.-backed rebels.
   The four-person team will leave Saturday for the war-torn
country where hundreds of thousands of people are starving. The
team also will focus on efforts to achieve peace in the region.
   Guarded optimism that a solution could be found to the impasse
over food aid came Thursday after Angola's ambassador to the United
Nations, Manuel Pedro Pacavira, met with State Department officials
and Rep. Tony Hall, D-Ohio, chairman of the House Select Committee
on Hunger.
   Pacavira, in an apparent turnaround in his government's
position, said his country is willing to ``work closely'' with
State Department officials to bring food to hundreds of thousands
of people suffering hunger because of drought.
   ``What I heard was that the government of Angola is interested
in working with the United Nations to deliver food through
`corridors of safe passage' to all hungry Angolans, whether they
are in government-held or UNITA-held territory,'' Hall said. UNITA
is a U.S.-backed rebel group headed by Jonas Savimbi.
   ``That is a turnaround from what we were hearing a few weeks ago
and it is very, very encouraging,'' Hall said.
   Angolan officials have said they are concerned that food
deliveries to people in UNITA-held territory in Southern Angolan
could be used as a cover for supplying weapons to Savimbi.
   UNITA, which has waged a civil war for more than 15 years
against the Soviet-supported central government, controls major
portions of land in southern Angola where some of the 250,000
Angolans are at risk because of food shortages.
   The State Department was similiarly encouraged by Pacavira's
statements, a spokesman said. The ambassador had a ``frank and
honest'' discussion with Jeffrey Davidow, deputy assistant
secretary of state, and one of the four people who will travel to
Angola, the official said.
   But the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
logistics of actually delivering food to parts of Angola could be
sticky.
   Generally, an agreement on ``corridors of safe passage'' calls
for both sides to stop hostilities on clearly marked airways and
roads.
   If the United Nations is to monitor the arrangement, the Angolan
government will have to contact officials of the international
agency, an aide to Hall said.
   The United States had criticized the Angolan government for
blocking food shipments to UNITA-held territory. Some $2 million in
aid is already to be moved to areas where people are starving,
officials said.
   Although the United States does not have diplomatic relations
with Angola, State Department officials say since 1980 some $4
million in food has been sent to people in government-held
territory as a humanitarian gesture.
   Pacavira's visit coincided with secret deliberations in Congress
over how much military aid to provide Savimbi in 1991. A House
subcommitee started marking up the intelligence authorization bill,
which includes aid to Angola, on Thursday.

   Measles vaccination programs should target all
eligible people, but especially Hispanics who recently immigrated
to the United States, federal health officials say.
   A report issued Thursday by the Centers for Disease Control also
said measles continues to be transmitted in medical settings,
especially hospital emergency rooms, because cases often are not
diagnosed and isolated promptly.
   The CDC's weekly report, which highlighted information gathered
by the Washington State Department of Health, said at least 26
percent of the measles cases recorded there this year were acquired
in Mexico, or linked to cases acquired there.
   In contrast, 15 percent of the 55 cases reported in 1989 were
linked to Mexico.
   Washington health officials reported 266 cases of measles during
the first 26 weeks of 1990 _ nearly five times the number of cases
reported statewide during all of 1989 and the largest number in the
state since 1979.
   Nationwide, 7,653 cases were reported during the first 20 weeks
of this year, the CDC said.
   Nearly half the cases in the Washington epidemic occurred among
unvaccinated people, the CDC said. Of those unvaccinated, more than
half were Hispanics, who account for 4 percent of Washington
state's population of 4.5 million and make up its largest ethnic
minority group.
   Detailed data available for 218 of the cases showed 97 cases, or
45 percent, occurred among Hispanics. Hispanic children showed the
highest incidence rate, with 59, or 81 percent, under 5 years old.
Of those, 32 were younger than 16 months old.
   Although measles vaccination coverage for Washington's total
Hispanic population was unknown, the high attack rate for Hispanics
suggests that coverage was low, the CDC said, noting that the
state's Hispanic population increased by nearly 40 percent from
1980 to 1988.
   Barbara Baker, Washington's immunization director, said many of
the state's Hispanics are migrant workers who take seasonal jobs
harvesting fruit crops, including apples, cherries, peas and
asparagus, and hops, used to flavor beer.
   In response to the measles epidemic, the state Department of
Health spent $1.1 million for 76,000 doses of measles vaccine this
spring, Ms. Baker said. The vaccination clinics were publicized in
Spanish and English on radio and television, in newspapers and by
sound trucks driven through areas with a high number of Hispanic
residents, she said.

   The divided three-judge panel held that North was entitled to a

documents because U.S. District Court Judge Gerhard Gesell gave
erroneous jury instructions.
   The court also held that North was entitled to a full hearing
delving into whether North's nationally televised testimony seeped

   The court also held that if Gesell determines at the hearing
that such tainted evidence was used to convict North on the other
two charges, he would be entitled to a new trial on those counts as
well.

<TEXT>
   A U.S. Marine plane crashed today
while searching for people stranded after a devastating earthquake
that killed more than 650 people. One serviceman died in the
accident and one was hurt.
   President Corazon Aquino, in her first televised statement on
the disaster, today defended her administration's response to the
quake. The government has been widely criticized for being slow and
disorganized in its rescue and relief operations.
   Also today, rebel soldiers who led a December coup attempt
against Mrs. Aquino offered a truce to help relief efforts.
   In the mountain resort of Baguio in the heart of the quake zone,
two bodies were found today in the ruins of the Hyatt Hotel, where
nearly 50 people were believed trapped.
   The rescuers had worked through the night after finding fresh
human blood in a tunnel they dug under the rubble of the hotel,
indicating some people could still be alive. They pulled out the
body of a woman and found the body of a man, who could not be
immediately extricated.
   Power was restored to parts of Baguio today. Many city
residents, fearing they will be buried in their homes by
aftershocks, were camped in makeshift tents in a park.
   The crash of the observation aircraft occurred near Baguio, 110
miles north of Manila on Luzon island, the U.S. Embassy said.
   One crewman was killed and the other was airlifted to a U.S.
military hospital, the U.S. Embassy said. Their names were not
released pending notification of relatives.
   Officials said at least 224 people _ including two Americans _
were killed in Baguio during Monday's earthquake, which measured
7.7 on the Richter scale.
   Hundreds of people may have died in remote areas of the stricken
region that are only now reporting damage and deaths, officials
said.
   The latest official figures say 659 people died and more than
1,300 were injured in the earthquake.
   About 190 people were believed buried in ruins of seven hotels
and in a factory in Baguio that caught fire after the quake,
according to Jose de Jesus, chairman of the presidential task force
supervising rescue efforts in Baguio.
   Rescuers fear most are dead.
   De Jesus said Marines and Philippine troops had begun operations
to rescue more than 100 people believed stranded on highways near
Baguio.
   Heavy casualties were also concentrated in Cabanatuan, 60 miles
north of Manila, where more than 60 students and teachers were
killed at the Philippine Christian College.
   One girl who was injured at the college told ABS-CBN television
today that her class was in the middle of a lesson on earthquakes
when the quake struck and the classroom collapsed.
   Mrs. Aquino pledged in a nationally televised address that her
government would rebuild areas devastated by the quake, and
defended its much-criticized relief effort.
   ``Let us not blame others,'' she said. ``Let us stop making
snide remarks. What we need now is to help each other.''
   Rebels who tried to topple Mrs. Aquino in December offered a
truce to help with the relief effort.
   ``We call on the present leadership to set aside all political
differences in order to squarely face this catastrophe,'' the
underground Revolutionary Alliance of the Masses-Soldiers of the
Filipino People said in a statement.
   It said the rebels have declared a unilateral stop to all
anti-government activities ``during this time of national tragedy''
and called on the government to temporarily stop its operations
against the rebels.
   The Marine OV-1 light observation plane crashed while searching
the mountains for motorists and others stranded along highways
closed by landslides during the quake.
   Officials said the aircraft was from the U.S.-run Subic Bay
naval base 50 miles west of Manila.
   Philippine television, whose crews flew aboard some of the
search planes, showed several buses and cars wreckaged by
landslides. Some residents had apparently used gravel and limestone
to write `SOS'' along the highway.
   Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos said more than 900 others also
were feared stranded in a mountain pass along the border of Nueva
Vizcaya and Nueva Ecija provinces.

<HEAD>Judge Rules He Doesn't Have Authority to Change Movie Ratings</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A judge said he does not have the authority to
change the ``X'' rating given to the Spanish film ``Tie Me Up! Tie
Me Down!''
   But acting state Supreme Court Justice Charles Ramos in his
ruling Thursday also denounced the system that issued the ``X''
rating. The state Supreme Court is Manhattan's trial level court.
   The movie's American distributor, Miramax Films Corp., and its
producer-director, Pedro Almodovar, asked the court to change the
rating. They said the ``X'' designation was arbitrary, capricious,
unfair and a form of censorship.
   Ramos agreed that the rating system used by the Motion Picture
Association of America seven-member ratings board ``is an effective
form of censorship.'' But he said the petition before his court was
not the proper vehicle for relief.
   The MPAA says its rating system is a guide for parents to make
judgments about which movies they want their children to see. It is
not designed to rate the merits of a film, the MPAA says.
   The MPAA said Almodovar's movie, whose Spanish title is
``Atame!'', was rated ``X'' because of ``a prolonged and graphic
sex scene photographed from numerous angles and accompanied by an
explicit sound track.''
   Ramos said nothing supports the MPAA's claim that its ratings
are designed to protect children. No physicians, child
psychiatrists or child care professionals are on the board, nor is
guidance from such professionals sought, the judge noted.
   Ramos said that ``the rating system's categories have been
fashioned by the motion picture industry to create an illusion of
concern for children, imposing censorship, yet all the while
facilitating the marketing of exploitive and violent films with an
industry seal of approval.''
   ``Notably absent (from the ratings system) is any sensitivity to
the offenses suffered by women, minorities, the disabled and those
who may not share the values'' of the average American parent,
Ramos said.
   ``A film may be viewed by children that may contain `hard
violence' and `drug use' but not explicit sex,'' he said. ``It may
be that the MPAA ratings are skewed toward permitting film makers
huge profits pandering to the appetite for films containing `hard
violence' and `drug use' while neglecting the welfare of children.''
   The judge also said the MPAA needs a system that would
distinguish between movies for adult audiences like ``Tie Me Up!
Tie Me Down!'' and pornography.
   William Kunstler, lawyer for Miramax and Almodovar, said he will
appeal the decision.
   ``As the rest of the world moves toward freer and open
expression in politics and art, it is deeply disturbing, that in
the United States the censors, bigots and blue noses exert
increasing control over what we may see and what we may say,''
Kunstler said.

   Palestinian guerrillas ringed a stronghold
of pro-Iranian militiamen today after three PLO fighters were
killed by grenade-throwing fundamentalists, police reported.
   They said seven other Palestinians were wounded as fighters of
the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, charged out of the
hilltop town of Jarjou overnight and staged six hit-and-run grenade
attacks on the guerrillas.
   The PLO responded by rushing in 200 more guerrillas with
multibarreled rocket launchers from its main bases near the port
city of Sidon, police said.
   A 600-member Palestine Liberation Organization force arrived
Tuesday in Iqlim al-Tuffah, or the Apple province, in a vain bid to
halt a new round of fighting between Hezbollah and the pro-Syrian
Amal militia.
   The 5-day-old battle between the two Shiite Moslem factions in
Jarjou and a cluster of surrounding villages overlooking Israel's
self-designated security zone in southern Lebanon has left 70
Shiites dead and 232 wounded, by police counts.
   Lt. Col. Anwar Madi, commander of the PLO intervention force,
reported the Palestinian casualties in Hezbollah's attack. He also
told reporters at his headquarters in the village of Houmine that
``we have shot and killed or wounded many of them'' but did not
provide a specific figure.
   Hezbollah wrested Jarjou from Amal on Monday in renewed fighting
in the 3-year-old power struggle for control of Lebanon's 1.2
million Shiites, the country's largest sect.
   Today's casualties raised the overall toll to 1,114 killed and
3,374 wounded.
   Red Cross teams managed to get into Jarjou on Thursday for the
first time since the clashes began and removed 11 bloated corpses
that had been sprawled in the village square for four days.
   But the fighting flared anew, forcing them to dive for cover as
shells exploded around the village. They fled Jarjou in a seven-car
convoy.
   Red Cross officials said there were many other bodies lying
around Jarjou.
   Officials of the International Committee of the Red Cross said
today they did not know when they would try again to evacuate dead
and wounded.
   Most of the region's 50,000 inhabitants fled their villages in
January, when Hezbollah began a campaign to break out of its
mountain enclave and reach the Mediterranean coast to open up a new
supply route.
   A 600-man Palestine Liberation Organization force was deployed
Tuesday along a four-mile line between Amal and Hezbollah,
ostensibly to stop the fighting.
   But the primary objective of Yasser Arafat's PLO, which has its
main bases in the port city of Sidon 10 miles northwest of Jarjou,
was to block Hezbollah's push to expand its area of control.
   A thrust toward Sidon would allow Hezbollah to link up with
anti-Arafat Palestinian radicals and threaten Arafat's forces.
   If Hezbollah reached the coast, it would cut off Amal's
stronghold in the south from Beirut. The fundamentalists want a sea
outlet to bring in weapons and supplies from Iran.
   Their main supply route is vulnerable because it runs through
the Bekaa Valley in eastern Lebanon, which is controlled by the
Syrian Army.
   The Apple Province covers 50 square miles of a rocky panhandle
and abuts the supply route into the Christian town of Jezzine from
the Israeli-held border zone.
   Jezzine, 11 miles east of Sidon, is controlled by an
Israeli-armed militia, the South Lebanon Army. Its 3,000 mainly
Christian fighters patrol the 440-square-mile Israeli enclave.
   The South Lebanon Army commander, retired Lebanese Army Gen.
Antoine Lahd, warned Thursday night that his force might intervene
in the Shiite fighting if it escalates and threatens his territory.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Republican Chairman Lee Atwater, who has been
battling a brain tumor since March, said today that GOP consultant
Charles Black will serve as the party's chief spokesman until he
returns to work fulltime.
   Atwater said in a statement that his recovery is going very
well. ``The doctors tell me that my tumor has stopped growing and
is dying,'' he said.
   He said in recent weeks he has become more active in developing
strategy and themes for the party, but still must spend several
hours a day in physical therapy.
   Atwater said Black will serve as a daily spokesman for the party
_ a role ``too important to let slip as we head toward Election
Day'' _ until he can return to work on a fulltime basis.
   Atwater described Black as his ``best friend and political eyes
and ears'' for the last 18 years. Black is also close to President
Bush and has been helping run the Republican National Committee in
Atwater's absence.
   Atwater said last week's RNC meeting in Chicago pointed up to
him ``the need to have the strongest possible spokesmen available
to carry our message to the public on a day-to-day basis.''
   He said the meeting was a success because ``we did what we do
best _ used aggressive politics on offense.'' He accused the
Democrats of ``trying to use issue after issue for political gain''
and promised that his party would stay on the offensive.
   RNC spokesman Leslie Goodman said Black has been a consultant to
the party since Atwater became chairman 18 months ago. She said his
new role as chief spokesman will involve more public appearances
and press interviews.
   ``It's more formalized. People will realize he speaks for Lee
and the party,'' she said. ``Lee's got a lot on his mind and a lot
of things he wants to say. Charlie's the best vehicle for doing
that.''
   Goodman said RNC chief of staff Mary Matalin also will continue
to speak for the party. She said Black's new visibility will be an
enhancement of his role, ``not a diminution of anybody else's.''
   Black will continue his work as a GOP consultant and attend to
party business as needed, Goodman said.

<HEAD>Radical Reformer Sues Party for Firing Him From Job At Party
School</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The former director of a school that teaches
Communist ideology has filed a lawsuit claiming he was wrongfully
fired after announcing he was quitting the Communist Party, Tass
reported today.
   In a suit filed against Moscow's Communist Party organization,
Vyacheslav Shostakovsky asked a district court to protect his
``professional honor and human dignity,'' the official Soviet news
agency said.
   Shostakovsky had been the rector of Moscow's Higher Party
School, a party-run institution concentrating on continuing
ideological education for party members. He was fired after telling
the Communist Party Congress last week that he and other members of
the Democratic Platform reform group were quitting the party to
form an independent political group.
   Shostakovsky's was one of a wave of defections from the party
that began after reform politician Boris N. Yeltsin shocked the
congress by announcing his resignation from the party.
   Since then, some of the party's leading reformers, including the
mayors of Moscow and Leningrad, have announced that they, too, are
quitting the party.
   The Moscow party organization is led by Yuri Prokofiev, who was
elevated to the national party organization's Politburo after the
congress ended.
   Tass said some of Shostakovsky's staff wrote to Prokofiev to
protest the firing. They said he was fired without consulting the
local party body that had sent Shostakovsky to the congress, or the
council that had elected him rector of the school. The report gave
no further information on the suit.

<TEXT>
   President Bush lashed out today at the
Democrats, saying their ``stranglehold on Congress'' is to blame
for the skyrocketing deficit and ``government by gridlock in
Washington.''
   ``Twenty-nine out of the last 35 years of Democrat control is
long enough. We must have more Republicans in Congress,'' Bush said
at a $100-a-plate fund-raising breakfast for GOP Senate candidate
Allen Kolstad, Montana's lieutenant governor, who is trying to
unseat incumbent Democratic Sen. Max Baucus.
   Bush reiterated his promise to negotiate a budget agreement
``without preconditions'' and said ``we are getting some good
cooperation with the leadership on the Democratic side of the
aisle'' in those talks.
   He devoted most of the speech to a strident attack on the
opposition, who control the Senate by a 55-45 margin and the House
by 257-176. Bush is hoping to wrest back control of the Senate for
the GOP in this fall's 34 Senate races.
   ``With the Democrats now in the control of the United States
Congress, both houses, we're facing government by gridlock in
Washington, with spending skyrocketing out of control, good
legislation thrown aside for pork barrel programs and a budget
deficit looming over our children's children,'' Bush said.
   ``While the Republican Party is using everything we've got to
build a strong, competitive America, the Democratic stranglehold on
the United States Congress has finally taken its toll,'' he said.
   ``Enough is enough. We must end this 'deficits don't matter'
mentality,'' Bush said. ``I do not want to preside over these
godawful deficits that are saddling these young people here with
billions in debt.''
   He attacked Congress for not passing his educational excellence
act and his version of child care legislation, and blasted it for
adding $3.5 billion to his request for $800 million in emergency
aid for Panama and Nicaragua last spring.
   It took 108 days to win passage of the bill, Bush said, a delay
that ``jeopardized the hard-won freedom of the brave people of
Nicaragua and Panama. That's more than a difference between
parties. In my view that was a disgrace.''
   Later, at an anti-drug rally in Daylis Stadium, Bush criticized
Congress for not passing his anti-crime package.
   Standing in front of a huge banner with a map of Montana and the
legend, ``Don't Let Drugs Cloud The Big Sky,'' Bush declared,
``It's time for Congress to act. Our children, our communities and
our cops have waited long enough.''
   Bush was flying later to Cheyenne, Wyo., to attend a Frontier
Days parade and rally, inspect the nation's only squadron of 50 MX
missiles in their silos at Warren Air Force Base and get in a quick
fishing trip to the Middle Crow Creek Fishing Area before heading
back to Washington.
   Asked why Bush was going out of his way to inspect the newest
nuclear missile in the U.S. arsenal at a time of reduced East-West
tensions, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the president wanted to
underscore ``the need to maintain a strong defense during changing
times.''
   Soviet missiles are still ``aimed at us. Our relations are
changing, but both countries have millions of men under arms,''
Fitzwater said aboard Air Force One. ``We can't let down our
guard.''
   At a GOP fund-raising dinner in Boise, Idaho, on Thursday, Bush
defended his reversal on tax increases and blamed Congress for the
looming $160 billion deficit.
   Addressing 900 people at an event that raised upwards of
$200,000 for Rep. Larry Craig's Senate race, the president said
Congress ``appropriates every dollar and tells the president how to
spend every single penny.''
   ``I have said I will negotiate without preconditions. And I
will,'' he said.
   ``You've seen the firestorm about revenues being on the table,''
aid Bush, who sowed discord in Republican ranks last month by
abandoning his ``no new taxes'' campaign pledge in acknowledging
that ``tax revenue increases'' are needed to cut the deficit.
   ``Well, I've done my part and now it's their turn. A truly
comprehensive package, not a temporary Band-Aid. There must be
reform of the budget process and there must be real spending
control,'' Bush said, his voice rising to a shout. ``The American
people are entitled to that!''

   Police today ruled out alcohol as a
factor in a bus accident that killed two American students and
injured dozens of others.
   The yellow double-decker bus was carrying summer school students
and staff to an arts festival when it overturned Thursday as it
turned off a highway near Wheatley, six miles east of Oxford, said
Thames Valley Police Chief Inspector John Wheeler. No other vehicle
was reported involved in the incident, in which 59 people were
injured, most of them American teen-agers.
   Police today said the bus driver, who was slightly hurt, was
detained Thursday but released on bail after a breath test showed
no signs of alcohol.
   ``Alcohol wasn't the cause. It was a negative test,'' said a
police spokesman on condition of anonymity.
   One witness said the accident scene was filled with ``utter
chaos and mayhem.''
   ``There were girls and boys trapped in the coach and others
strewn up the bank,'' said ambulance superintendent Robin
Finlayson. ``They were crying, bawling and bloody. ... Many had
crush injuries.''
   Police identified the two dead students as Autumn Dubose, 18, of
Lilburn, Ga., and Lawrence Levine, 16, of Chappaqua, N.Y.
   Police said today they also were interviewing passengers.
   Four of the 59 injured people were seriously hurt, said Police
Chief Inspector Laurie Fray.
   Authorities said the 61 people on the bus included 47 Americans,
five Britons, two Japanese and one each from Canada, France, the
Netherlands, Austria, Italy, and Mexico. The nationality of one
student was not known.
   Most of the Americans were gifted students on a four-week summer
school course at Oxford University's Magdalen College organized by
the Oxford Advanced Studies Program in New York, said American
coordinator Paul Beresford-Hill. Their ages ranged from 16 to 20.
   David Watson of the Bus and Coach Council, speaking on behalf of
the bus owner, Bee Line, said it overturned on its right side as it
turned left off the highway for the arts festival. He said Sharma,
who has worked for the company for 14 years, appeared to have made
a wide turn.
   Authorities said some of the passengers were thrown through
windows and others crawled out of the bus. Some were pulled free
and at least three were trapped inside for an hour.
   Max Koltuv, a 16-year-old New Yorker who suffered a broken hand,
said he and three others were sitting in the front row on the top
deck of the bus.
   ``I knew it was going too fast when it began to turn off the
road. Suddenly, it began to tip and it rolled right over onto the
embankment. The four of us were thrown through the front window and
out into the grass, clear of the bus,'' he said.
   ``I blacked out but came around about 30 seconds later and all
the people left on the bus were shouting and were hysterical,''
Koltuv said.
   A spokesman at John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford said most of
the 35 people admitted had back and neck injuries ``of varying
severity.''
   A few suffered head injuries and others friction burns and
lacerations but ``very few'' were in critical condition, said the
spokesman, speaking on condition he was not identified.
   The 24 less seriously injured were taken to Wycombe General
Hospital in nearby High Wycombe.

   Five shrimpers were arrested off the
Texas coast in a federal crackdown on fishermen working without net
equipment to protect sea turtles.
   Two shrimp boat captains arrested Thursday off Freeport and
Galveston were headed for the Harris County Jail in Houston. Three
others arrested off Port O'Connor were held without bail in the
Nueces County Jail in Corpus Christi pending court hearings.
   All are accused of violating federal laws that require them to
use turtle excluder devices, or TEDs, to protect turtles that can
get caught in shrimp nets and drown. The penalty for criminal TED
violations can be up to six months in federal prison and $25,000
per incident.
   The arrests bring to six the number of captains accused of TED
violations after their shrimp boats were boarded in Texas waters.
   Authorities announced earlier this week they were beefing up
enforcement along the Texas coast after more than 31 sea turtles,
including 17 endangered Kemp's ridley turtles, were found dead.
   The cause of the turtles' deaths has not yet been determined,
but environmentalists have blamed the shrimpers.

   It took four months, but 82-year-old
Wilfrid Berg finished the mural he started 56 years ago in the
children's reading room of the city's public library.
   The Hackley Public Library dedicated on Thursday the
29-foot-long mural that had been curtailed when a New Deal program
was cut in 1934.
   ``I'm just overwhelmed,'' Berg said, tears welling in his blue
eyes. ``I've always wanted to finish it.''
   The mural, featuring characters from classic children's
literature, stands above bookcases and a doorway directly opposite
from another mural Berg painted in 1934.
   They both had been commissioned by the Works Progress
Administration.
   When funding was canceled, Berg's sketches were stored in the
Muskegon Museum of Art. They surfaced a few years ago, and they
supporters of the library decided to sponsor the project.
   ``I realized that after all this time, there was the possibility
he couldn't do it,'' said Robert Youngman, the museum's assistant
curator of graphics. ``But he still has a very sure hand.''
   Thursday's ceremony was part of the 100th anniversary
celebration of the library.
   Berg kept the mural's original design and theme, ``Idle Hours
with Good Books is Time Well Spent.''
   The mural depicts two children sitting on a hill reading _
portraits of Berg's siblings as children _ with such characters as
Cinderella, Huck Finn, Pinocchio and Peter Rabbit around them.
Geese, frogs and fairies are scattered throughout.
   Berg said he was satisfied with the result but was eager to get
out of the public spotlight.
   ``I'll be glad when this is all over,'' Berg said of the
ceremony. ``I've got a lot of projects I want to get started on.''

<HEAD>Canadian Archbishop Offers Resignation In Sex Abuse Scandal</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A report blaming Newfoundland's Roman Catholic
Church for failing to stop priests who were sexually abusing boys
has led Archbishop Alphonsus Penney of St. John's to offer his
resignation to Pope John Paul II.
   Penney made a public apology to the victims and their families
on Wednesday after the scathing report accused him of ignoring and
then denying claims that boys in Newfoundland, an island province
off the east coast of Canada, had been sexually abused by priests
for more than a decade.
   Penney, 65, said he accepted full responsibility for failing to
deal with the scandal, which first became public in 1987. Five men
_ including priests and former priests _ have been convicted on
sexual abuse charges in the past three years. Several others are
awaiting trial.
   For 2{ years Penney refused calls to step down while more than
20 of his priests and lay members of the Newfoundland Catholic
community were charged with or convicted of sexually abusing boys.
The report, written by a commission set up by the archbishop a year
ago, said church officials showed little compassion for the victims
and aligned themselves with the accused.
   ``We are sorry for the times you were not believed, were not
supported or were ostracized in any way in our community,'' Penney
told a Catholic audience in St. John's. ``For every word and action
which may have deepened your pain, we are profoundly sorry.
   The commission said the church adopted a policy of ``minimal
response'' to the scandal, even though it was receiving complaints
about some sexually deviant priests from parishioners, police
officers, social workers and other priests. That response, the
report said, ``was woefully inadequate and may have been
psychologically damaging to all concerned.''
   The boys, it said, were the victims of men they had been brought
up to trust, men who ``abused their position of priestly status and
power by acting out their regressed sexuality with children.''
   The commission's findings stunned Newfoundland's 120,000 Roman
Catholics.
   ``It pulled no punches on the state of affairs within our
diocese,'' said Barbara Crosbie, vice chairman of a committee
established to help the church respond to the report. The 700-page
document will be sent out to parishes for study. A public meeting
is scheduled for Oct. 11.
   ``I think the essence of the report will be embraced,'' Mrs.
Crosbie said.

   Penney made no defense of his actions. He has said in the past
that he had no knowledge of allegations of sexual abuse by priests
until November 1987, but the report found evidence he heard
allegations in 1979 and in 1984.
   The 55 recommendations the commission made included the
following:
   _That the church formally acknowledge its portion of guilt and
apologize to the victims.
   _That the church compensate victims financially.
   _That it should revise policies on reacting to sexual abuse
complaints.
   _That the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops be asked to
``fully, directly, hontestly and without reservation'' examine
problems created by forcing priests to be celibate.

<HEAD>Witnesses Say US Policy Still Helping Khmer Rouge</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Combines pvs with editing.</NOTE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. policy is still helping the Khmer Rouge
in Cambodia, despite changes announced by the Bush administration
this week, witnesses told a Senate committee today.
   Senators of both parties and private witnesses said continued
U.S. financial aid to a rebel coalition that includes the Khmer
Rouge, and a continued U.S. economic embargo against Cambodia, lend
indirect support to the feared rebel group.
   Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, a member of the intelligence
committee, said Bush's withdrawal of recognition for the rebel
coalition is insufficient.
   He called on Bush to help forge a coalition against the Khmer
Rouge between the non-communist rebel factions and the current
Cambodian government which they are fighting.
   ``Are we supporting a coalition we hope will win?'' asked Sen.
Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., who made a trip to Cambodia earlier this year.
``I think the answer is likely no'' because a rebel victory would
almost certainly install the Khmer Rouge _ the faction with the
strongest military force, he said.
   Former Secretary of State Edmund Muskie, who traveled to
Cambodia last year as chairman of the liberal Center for National
Policy, said he believed the Bush administration will make further
policy changes because ``the administration finally understands
that the U.S. government could have on its record, if not on its
conscience, the death of a nation.''
   U.S. intelligence reports show a pattern of military activity by
the Khmer Rouge much like the moves that led them to power 15 years
ago, say sources familiar with the reports.
   The information, including indications of military cooperation
and shared supply lines between the Khmer Rouge and the U.S.-backed
non-communist rebels, was contained in briefings the CIA and
Defense Intelligence Agency gave to congressional and executive
branch officials, the sources said.
   The Khmer Rouge presided over a massive agrarian reform
experiment in Cambodia during its 3{-year rule that resulted in the
deaths of more than 1 million countrymen from execution, starvation
and disease.
   Fearing a comeback by the communist guerrillas, the
administration announced Wednesday it was withdrawing support for a
United Nations seat for the three-party resistance that includes
the Khmer Rouge, the forces of Prince Norodom Sihanouk and the
faction of former Cambodian prime minister Son Sann.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III also said the United
States would open talks with Vietnam, which installed the current
Cambodian regime.
   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said U.S.
intelligence sees the events in 1974 and 1975 that led to the
takeover of Cambodia by the Khmer Rouge as a virtual ``model'' for
events occurring now.
   Those events include attacks on provincial capitals and other
significant targets, a near-permanent presence in the northern part
of the country and deeper penetration since Vietnamese occupation
forces withdrew last year.
   The stepped-up rebel attacks pose a threat to the Hun Sen
government, and there are reports that in some instances the
government's soldiers have stopped fighting, according to the
analysis. The Khmer Rouge has about 30,000 to 40,000 troops, while
government forces number 60,000 to 100,000.
   Soviet and Vietnamese aid to the Cambodian government has
declined, and while Phnom Penh remains a bustling capital with a
robust economy, the economy in government-controlled parts of the
countryside is fragile and inflation is rising, the analysts said.
Some government workers and military personnel are not being paid,
they said.
   U.S. intelligence believes that all of the 140,000 Vietnamese
troops who were in Cambodia have been withdrawn, with only a few
advisers remaining.
   The intelligence agencies estimate China's military aid to the
Khmer Rouge at about $100 million a year.
   Other sources have said the United States provides $13 million a
year in covert aid to the non-communist resistance forces, together
with $7 million in public, ``non-lethal'' aid. Singapore gives an
additional $10 million yearly to the non-communist forces.
   The U.S. aid remains the subject of hot debate on Capitol Hill,
where the Senate Intelligence Committee has voted to end the covert
program. Some congressional opponents of past U.S. policy say it
makes no sense to continue to send aid while withdrawing
recognition of the resistance coalition.

<HEAD>Customs Service Worker Charged With Leaking Confidential
Information</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. Customs Service worker was been charged
with passing confidential information from a nationwide computer
network to a second man who shared it with a suspected drug
smuggler, officials said.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Tom Stahl said the alleged leak scuttled
a drug-smuggling investigation.
   ``The loss to the government is that a drug smuggler learned
that he was being investigated for drug smuggling, and the
investigation was impaired,'' and subsequently dropped, Stahl said
Thursday.
   The compromised drug investigation involved no undercover
agents, and apparently no law enforcement figures were endangered
by the alleged leak, Stahl said.
   A five-page indictment identified the Customs Service worker as
David Henry Brown, 48, of San Diego. The Customs Service said Brown
is an information management specialist employed in the agency's
San Diego computer center.
   Customs Service spokesman Mike Fleming said that Brown, who had
worked for the Customs Service since 1972, was placed on
administrative leave Thursday and a decision was pending on whether
he would be fired.
   The information Brown allegedly passed came from the Treasury
Enforcement Communications System, a nationwide computer network
containing confidential law enforcement intelligence information.
   The data pool provides ``awide variety of information'' to
Customs Service agents, Fleming said.
   Included in the network is information on warrants, pending
criminal investigations and smuggling operations.
   None of the information is classified for national security
purposes, but the network contains confidential law enforcement
information, and thus ``is sensitive in a general sense,'' Fleming
said
   The indictment alleged that Brown passed the computer
information to Joseph Philip Souza, 47, of Newport, R.I., in 1988
and earlier this year. Souza was charged with Brown; both men face
one count of conspiracy to defraud the United States and two counts
of conversion of government property.
   Neither Brown nor Souza has been arrested; both are expected to

<HEAD>United States Postpones Annual Defense Meeting With Israel</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The United States is postponing an annual
meeting with Israeli representatives to review joint defense
projects, but officials say the move is not related to U.S. efforts
to prod Israel into accepting peace talks with the Palestinians.
   The talks, known as the Joint Security Assistance Program, were
scheduled to be held in Washington next week.
   Diplomatic sources said today, however, that Secretary of State
James A. Baker III has scheduled a meeting in Washington with David
Levy, the new Israeli foreign minister.
   The session could set the stage for a new Bush administration
drive to propel Israel into talks with Palestinian Arabs.
   Baker and Levy had planned to meet in Paris last week but Levy
was recuperating from surgery for a circulatory ailment. His
physicians advised him against traveling to France.
   The U.S. postponement of the Joint Security Assistance Program
talks took Israeli officials by surprise, coming as it did shortly
before the director general of Israel's defense ministry, David
Ivri, and the new defense minister, Moshe Arens, were scheduled to
arrive in Washington, said a source who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   A State Department official said the postponement was caused by
the budget meetings under way between the administration and
Congress, which he said have created some uncertainty about the
amount of money that will be available for foreign aid.
   The session with Israel was to focus on U.S. aid for fiscal year
1992 that starts Oct. 1, 1991. ``We still don't know what our
budget will look like then, how can we discuss it with the
Israelis?'' said the State Department official.
   Israel is the largest recipient of U.S. aid, getting $3 billion
annually in military and economic assistance.
   ``We are not sending any signals,'' said the official, who spoke
on condition of anonymity. The official said Israel had agreed to
the U.S. suggestion that the talks be held in September.
   Last March, a formula devised by Baker for talks between Israel
and Palestinian Arabs was rejected by the Israeli government, which
collapsed over the dispute. Levy, a hard-liner, has since taken
over as foreign minister.
   Baker, preparing to try again, has met in Washington with
Egyptian and Jordanian officials. But talks with the Palestine
Liberation Organization, held through U.S. Ambassador Robert
Pelletreau Jr. in Tunisia, were broken off after a failed terrorist
attack against Israel.
   The secretary of state has been pressing Israeli Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir to agree to peace talks with Palestinians in the
Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. But Shamir has resisted
the pressure and Baker has in recent weeks displayed marked
impatience.
   Arens was scheduled to arrive in Washington today for talks with
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney.
   Israeli and U.S. officials insisted Arens' visit was not
connected to the postponement of the talks despite the fact that it
had only been arranged within the past week and officially
announced on Thursday.
   Israeli officials said Arens had taken Cheney up on an
invitation delivered by telephone soon after Arens took office last
month.
   But other officials said Arens was anxious to discuss with
Cheney the question of continued U.S. financing for the
Israeli-developed Arrow anti-missile project.
   Arens also wants to discuss with Cheney recent threats by Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein against Israel and against Kuwait.
   The annual sessions are designed to review joint defense
projects such as research and development of weapons systems,
exchange of military and intelligence information and the
allocation of U.S. money for various projects in Israel.
   The talks involve representatives from Israel's treasury
department, its defense and foreign ministries, along with their
U.S. counterparts.

<HEAD>New Mooove: Summer Jackets Developed to Shield Cows from the Sun</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A university professor says he has developed summer
jackets with matching hats to shield cows from the sun, insects and
diseases _ and allow them to produce more milk.
   The outfit consists of three straw pieces that cover the head,
back and abdomen, Mosaku Sakurai, of the Tokyo University of
Agriculture, said Friday.
   He said he had developed the jackets after observing cows for
more than eight years. Sakurai, an agriculture professor, said cows
lose their appetites and produce less milk when they are exposed to
the sun during summer.
   The back of a black-haired cow can reach 140 degrees if it is
outside for about 20 minutes in summer, he said.
   By wearing the jacket, a cow can spend more time eating grass
and can produce more milk, he said. The jacket is not yet being
produced commercially.

   Thieves broke into a chapel housing a

made in the 17th and 18th centuries, police said Friday.
   Officials said it was difficult to estimate the value of the
items, stolen late Wednesday or early Thursday by thieves who broke
in through a window at the Chapel of the Penitents in the southern
town of Val.
   Investigators said they were examining footprints at the scene,
but no arrests have been made.
   Earlier this month, authorities reported four thefts from
museums in Paris, including ancient jewelry and a Renoir painting
stolen from the Louvre.
   The thefts prompted a major review of museum security.

   A homeless woman has been sentenced to three
months in jail for setting her dog on an American professor who
filmed her without permission and a policeman who came to the
professor's aid.
   Gloria Allison-Grey, 43, became angry when Richard Passman, 44,
of Shorewood, Wis., filmed her on June 27 in a squalid area of
London dubbed Cardboard City, the prosecutor said.
   She pleaded guilty to assaulting the policeman with intent to
resist arrest. She was not charged with assaulting Passman and his
wife because they had returned home and would not have been
available to give evidence.
   ``An innocent tourist, taking pictures, happens to catch you on
his film and this is what happens _ a violent attack on him,'' the
London magistrate said at Thursday's sentencing.
   The woman's lawyer said she suffered from epilepsy and had no
recollection of the incident.

   A heat wave near the Arctic Circle set off fires
in the tundra around the western Siberian city of Nadym, Tass
reported Friday.
   A dense cloud of smoke hung over the city after two dozen fires
broke out in peat bogs over an area of 1,730 acres, the official
Soviet news agency said.
   The mayor of Nadym, a gas-production center, told Tass that
firefighters were battling to keep fires away from gas pipelines.
   ``A tundra fire is a terrible scene,'' said construction worker
Igor Shapovalov. ``We do not have special-purpose equipment or
well-trained units to fight tundra fires. But we have still been
able to stop fires moving toward fuel mains in two locations.''
   Tass did not say what temperatures had been during the heat wave.

   Marion Barry spent a Virgin Islands vacation
working and playing with his son, not drinking and using cocaine as
prosecutors allege, a police bodyguard testified today at the
mayor's drug and perjury trial.
   But the witness, detective Ulysses Walltower, also testified
that he was not in Barry's presence during much of the time that
government witness Charles Lewis has said he used drugs with the
mayor.
   Testifying on the second day of the defense's presentation,
Walltower said Barry split his time between official duties and
playing with his son Christopher during the four-day trip to the
Virgin Islands in 1988.
   Lewis has testified that during Barry's first afternoon in the
Virgin Islands, the two smoked crack cocaine together when others
were absent from the mayor's hotel room.
   The detective said that on that afternoon he accompanied Barry's
son and the boy's companion to a nearby beach. ``They went down
several times, for 30 or 45 minutes,'' Walltower testified. ``Then
they would go back to the room, mess around, and go back down to
the beach.''
   Walltower also acknowledged he spent little time with the mayor
in the evenings _ periods where Lewis and other witnesses have said
drugs were used.
   Walltower, a 20-year police veteran, also said he saw Barry in
the company of only two women. Lewis, a convicted drug dealer, has
testified that he brought three women to Barry's hotel room.
   On Thursday, two of the mayor's other security guards said they
frequently drove the mayor to the homes of people who allegedly
provided him with drugs.
   And a contract supervisor said he understood the mayor was
interested in a city contract for Barry's girlfriend, former model
Rasheeda Moore.
   Outside the courthouse, Barry characterized some of the
government's questioning as ``satanic, dirt-like tactics.''
   The two security guards, who are city police officers, and the
supervisor, were called by the mayor's lawyers in an attempt to
attack the credibility of prosecution witnesses who said they saw
Barry use drugs.
   Instead, officer James Stays testified reluctantly that he took
Barry to the homes of alleged drug suppliers Lloyd Moore and Jeff
Mitchell and the restaurant of a man who said he gave drugs to
Barry about 30 times.
   Officer Warren Goodwine testified that he drove the mayor to the
home of Doris Crenshaw on at least two occasions. Crenshaw
testified she saw Barry use drugs about a dozen times.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Judith Retchin questioned Stays about
allegations that he had used cocaine. Stays denied that and also
denied telling another security officer that a friend of the
mayor's was providing him with cocaine.
   Retchin said a witness had given grand jury testimony that Stays
had used cocaine. She also said that Stays earlier this year had
refused to undergo a urinalysis for drugs.
   Goodwine told investigators earlier this year that he did not
want to know what the mayor was doing and that he stayed away from
Barry's activities as much as possible.
   Those statements were ``probably taken out of context,''
Goodwine testified Thursday. He said he felt he should stay out of
Barry's ``personal business ... that was not my business.''
   Stays testified that he never delivered money to Rasheeda Moore
so that she could buy drugs for the mayor.
   Darryl Hardy of the city's summer youth program said his boss
had given him the ``impression'' that Barry and top city officials
wanted a no-bid $57,000 contract awarded to Moore for a modeling
project.
   Hardy also told investigators earlier this year that he
understood that Barry wanted the dollar amount of the contract
doubled in 1987. But he testified that he couldn't recall making
the earlier statement.
   Hardy said he judged Moore's program on its merits and that
there was no interference to approve it in 1986 and 1987 or cancel
it in 1988. Moore has testified that Barry refused to help her get
it renewed in 1988 because she rejected his request for sex.
   Barry, 54, is accused of 10 counts of cocaine possession, one
count of conspiracy count and three felony charges of lying to a
grand jury about his alleged drug use.

   A quick-thinking chemical plant foreman ``very
likely saved a lot of lives'' when he sounded an alarm just seconds
before explosions ripped through the building, killing one worker
and injuring 68, authorities said.
   ``One of the maintenance foremen noticed a vapor cloud,
immediately ran over and pulled the alarm,'' Ron Leisner, a quality
assurance manager for BASF Corp., said at a news conference. ``He
was very calm under pressure and very likely saved a lot of lives
by doing so.''
   Leisner said the foreman, Joe Brock, was outside the resin
building when he saw the vapor, what Leisner described as being
similar to the shimmering effect above a blacktop road on a hot day.
   ``Our fire alarm went off, I got about five steps ... The
explosion hit and it knocked everybody off their feet,'' said
Thomas Borst, a chemist who was working in an adjacent building at
the plant when the blast hit.
   Larry Jameson, president of BASF's Coatings and Colorants
Division, said the company had not determined the cause of the
explosion, but suspected that something went wrong with equipment
that processes chemical polymers into paint.
   He said the process is used at other BASF plants, and there were
no plans to suspend those operations. ``We really have no reason to
suspect that this is an unsafe practice,'' Jameson said.
   Firefighters continued to douse the building with water today to
prevent chemicals from reigniting, Fire Chief Bill Miller said. It
took about 2{ hours to bring the fire under control.
   About 2,000 residents were evacuated from their homes Thursday
night while inspectors checked for structural damage.
   By this morning, Norwood Fire Chief David Cartuyvelles said,
everyone was allowed to return to their homes. Only some businesses
near the plant remained closed today, he said.
   Most of the evacuees were in Norwood, a suburb surrounded by
Cincinnati. The plant is on the line between the two municipalities.
   ``I thought an airplane hit the building,'' said Charles Moore,
a resident who said he was in his 80s. ``The concussion knocked me
out of my chair. It sounded like a bomb.''
   The cause of the explosions in the building on the 9-acre site
remained under investigation.
   ``We don't have any idea what started the blaze,'' BASF
spokesman Helmut von Moltke said.
   The first explosion sent a cloud of thick, black smoke pouring
from a four-story brick building containing resins and solvents.
   About 150 people were in the plant, which makes coatings for the
insides of soft drink cans and for paper cups, said Kenneth
Diedenhofer, a plant production manager.
   Diedenhofer said the building was ``engulfed in flames. I saw
one guy hanging from the steps outside the building. The steps were
blown out from the wall. His leg was tied into the steps. I was
able to get him out.''
   A second blast about a half-hour later blew out storefront
windows as far as a quarter-mile away in the neighborhood of small,
two-story homes. Smaller explosions sent balls of fire rolling into
the sky.
   Malcolm Adcock, assistant city health commissioner, said
preliminary findings by city investigators suggested that
``volatile and explosive'' industrial solvents leaked from a mixing
vat and were ignited by a spark.
   Police Chief Lawrence Whalen identified the dead man as Lawrence
D. Krechting, 55, of Norwood, a BASF maintenance worker. He
apparently was killed by flying debris in the building where the
explosions occurred, Whalen said.
   Hospitals in the city reported treating 68 people for burns,
broken bones and cuts caused by flying glass.
   Three people remained in critical condition today.
   The company has accounted for all of the workers who were in the
plant, Miller said.
   Tests by the city and by the Ohio Environmental Protection
Agency showed no toxic fumes in the smoke from the fire, Miller
said.

   President Bush has signed an order
proclaiming July 22-28 as Lyme Disease Awareness Week, the White
House said Friday.
   The proclamation, issued in conjunction with a joint
congressional resolution, notes that the tick-borne disease has
spread to 45 states since its discovery in Lyme, Conn., in 1975.
   The disease, which can affect the heart, nervous system and
other parts of the body, is caused by a bacterial infection
transmitted to humans through tick bites.
   The ticks, frequently no larger than the head of a pin, feed
primarily on deer and field mice, but can also attach themselves to
cats, dogs, birds, horses and other animals.
   ``Although it is easily treated when diagnosed early, Lyme
disease can become very serious if it remains undetected,'' Bush
said in his proclamation.
   The proclamation was released here while Bush was addressing a
political fund-raiser and anti-drug rally. He actually signed the
proclamation Thursday.

   The spray of an open fire hydrant _ for
generations, an escape from urban summer swelter _ is going the way
of such lost childhood pleasures as marbles and mumbletypeg.
   Newark is among a small group of cities that have turned to The
Custodian, a magnetic locking device, to crack down on the illegal
diversion of city water from hydrants.
   Hydrants have long offered children the easiest, cheapest way to
cool down on a summer's day. But the practice has a dangerous
downside _ it diverts water that may be needed to fight fires.
   Some children say they know about the dangers in opening
hydrants, but they need some relief from the sweltering conditions
of the city.
   ``They should and they shouldn't do it,'' said Latasha Harris,
14, who used to play under open hydrants. ``In a way, it's
dangerous, because people could be hurt in a fire if there's no
water.
   ``But it's hot. I mean, some people can't afford to go places to
go swimming. They should at least let people use the sprinklers.
That doesn't waste as much water.''
   Officials in Newark, Paterson and Passaic in New Jersey, and in
Boston, Chicago and Kansas City, Mo., say the magnetic lock that
slips over the top of a fire hydrant has sharply reduced the amount
of water loss. The lock comes equipped with a key wrench, which is
needed to open the hydrant. They are also used in Washington, D.C.,
and New Haven, Conn.
   ``This is the first thing we've found so far that has worked,''
said Bob Kerns, director of the Kansas City Board of Public
Utilities.
   Installing 1,500 caps on the most popular of the city's 5,200
hydrants saved Newark enough money on salaries, repairs and water
to pay for the devices, said Andrew Pappachen, a supervising
engineer in the Water Department.
   Hydra-Shield Manufacturing Inc. of Irving, Texas, sells The
Custodian and its special wrench for about $500, said salesman Ron
Green. Sales primarily have been in northeastern cities, he said.
   The average number of open hydrant reports on a typical summer
weekend dropped from 200 two years ago to 10 this summer, said
Newark Fire Department spokesman Larry Krieger.
   Vandals have used blow torches, chain saws, drills and
sledgehammers to damage the locking device, officials said, but
only on a few occasions have they succeeded in getting water from
the hydrants.
   ``Some people really attack them,'' said Mark Durham of the
Chicago Water Department. ``There have been cases where hydrants
were damaged and rendered inoperable, but no water was lost.''
   The Custodian is an improvement over earlier hydrant security
devices, said Wendell Inhoffer, general superintendent of the
Passaic Valley Water Commission, which installed 400 caps in
Paterson and Passaic.
   ``Some early devices needed scissor wrenches to open, so we made
sure all the fire departments had them. The kids found a way to
open them with coat hangers,'' Inhoffer said.
   Illegal taps were virtually eliminated in Boston after the caps
were installed on all hydrants in public housing projects, said
Fred Famolare, an aide to the Fire Department's deputy chief.
   ``But nothing's foolproof. We've noticed lately that some people
are putting a large magnet on top of the hydrant and then using a
plumber's wrench,'' Famolare said.
   Boston firefighters also have discovered a new problem:
out-of-town fire companies helping Boston units have found they
cannot open the hydrants. Famolare said wrenches are being supplied.
   Open hydrants can spew more than 1,000 gallons of water a minute
and reduce water pressure in a system, a potentially dangerous
problem when there is a fire.
   In Newark, Krieger said community groups are no longer allowed
to open hydrants with sprinkler caps. ``The drain on the water
system was tremendous,'' he said.

<HEAD>Federal Agencies Say No Investigation Planned of Rare Cancer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAYLORVILLE, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two federal health agencies say they
won't investigate an outbreak of a rare cancer suffered by three
babies here unless asked to do so by the state health department.
   The cancer, neuroblastoma, strikes the adrenal glands and
nervous system and occurs primarily in children under age 10.
Usually found in just nine of every million children, three
children under the age of 22 months in this central Illinois city
of 11,000 suffer from it.
   Earlier this week, some residents petitioned the federal Centers
for Disease Control in Atlanta to study whether the cancer might be
linked to a hazardous waste site in town, which the ill children
live near.
   Some residents of the town 50 miles south of Springfield fear
the cancer may be caused by a former coal gasification plant of
Central Illinois Public Service Co., where contamination was found
in surrounding soil and water.
   On Thursday, representatives of the CDC and the federal Agency
for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry said the petition for
help probably won't bring an immediate response.
   The Illinois Department of Public Health this spring completed
an initial health assessment and is reviewing all cancer cases,
childhood cancers and the neuroblastoma in Taylorville. It doesn't
plan to ask for federal help until the studies are completed, in
two to three months.
   The Taylorville children diagnosed with neuroblastoma since
March 1989 are 8-month-old Erika May, 22-month-old Zachary
Donaldson, and 7-month-old Chad Hryhorysak. Erika and Zachary have
been successfully treated. Chad is undergoing chemotherapy.
   The condition can be fatal if left untreated but usually can be
caught in time. All three children lived within three miles of the
abandoned plant when they got sick.

<TEXT>
   Communist North Korea on Friday
dismissed as propaganda a South Korean proposal to open temporarily
the heavily fortified border that has divided the peninsula for 45
years.
   South Korea offered to open its border at the border village of
Panmunjom for five days beginning Aug. 13, allowing North Koreans
to travel freely anywhere in the South.
   The Korean border is the last major outpost of the Cold War,
guarded by more than 1 million troops on either side behind
concrete bunkers and barbed wire.
   Neither side has ever allowed citizens to freely visit the other
side, and there is no telephone, mail or any other communications
between the two.
   Only once, in 1985, the Koreas exchanged 151 people from each
side for the first reunion of separated families in their capitals.
   South Korea's President Roh Tae-woo suggested the five-day
border opening as a trial period. It would include Aug. 15,
symbolically important to both Koreas as the day that ended 35
years of Japanese colonial rule.
   Panmunjom, the Korean War truce village, is in the Demilitarized
Zone located 35 miles north of Seoul. The village is manned by
U.S., South Korean and North Korean soldiers and is the site for
sporatic North-South talks.
   No civilians can enter the area without approval.
   ``The time has come to end total division,'' Roh said in a radio
and television address. ``Korea must not remain the world's only
land still partitioned by Cold War politics.''
   North Korea's Pyongyang Radio, monitored in Tokyo, called Roh's
offer a ``fradulant propaganda'' ploy.
   The official North Korean news agency, reacting to Roh's offer,
urged the demolition of barriers along the border, the repeal of
South Korean security laws that forbid unauthorized travel to the
north, and the release of prisoners jailed for making such visits.
   But the Korean Central News Agency report used unusually polite
and restrained language. Typically, the agency refers to Roh as a
``traitor.'' However, Friday's story referred to him as ``the South
Korean chief executive.''
   South Korea said it had suggested the two sides meet July 30 to
discuss the border-opening offer. Two weeks ago, North Korea
offered to open a small portion of its border beginning Aug. 15 at
Panmunjom, but with passage to be restricted.
   The two Koreas have already scheduled a meeting July 26 to sign
an accord setting up the first meeting of the two countries' prime
ministers, expected to be held in Seoul as early as August.
   Radical South Korean students claimed Roh's announcement was
aimed at diverting public attention from troubled domestic
politics. They demanded the immediate release of all political
prisoners, including a student and a pastor jailed last year for
travel to North Korea.
   Lee Hong-koo, one of Roh's top aides, said those arrested for
making illegal trips to North Korea would not be released.
   Korea was divided into Communist North Korea and capitalist
South Korea in 1945 at the end of World War II. The two fought a
three-year civil war in the early 1950s.

   Democratic Rep. Lindy Boggs announced today
she is retiring, ending a husband-and-wife congressional dynasty
spanning nearly half a century.
   ``This chapter in my service to the public is ending,'' Mrs.
Boggs, 74, said in a statement released this morning announcing her
decision not to run again.
   ``This is not the end of my career. I will continue to actively
participate in community activities here and in Washington ...,''
the statement said. ``Although there are challenges that remain to
be met, together we will go forward.''
   Later, she was applauded by a gathering of 150 colleagues,
supporters, friends and family when she said ``I am proud of my
small role in opening doors to blacks and women.''
   It had been widely reported in the New Orleans media that Mrs.
Boggs would retire to spend more time with her daughter, Barbara
Sigmund, who is suffering from cancer. Mrs. Sigmund is mayor of
Princeton, N.J.
   At the Tulane University gathering, Mrs. Boggs made no specific
reference to her daughter's illness. However she did say that the
decision to retire was a wrenching one because so many people
offered to help run her office and campaign and let her take care
of family obligations.
   ``I don't think I can share with you all of the things that ran
through my mind, because some of them are very personal,'' she said.
   Mrs. Boggs is the only white member of Congress representing a
black-majority district. She has been on Capitol Hill 17 years and
her withdrawal would offer an opportunity for Louisiana to elect
its first black congressman.
   Her husband, Hale, then a young New Orleans lawyer, won the 2nd
Congressional District in 1940. The district covers most of New
Orleans.
   He lost a re-election bid in 1942, but reclaimed the job in
1946, beginning a string of 22 consecutive victories by him or his
wife.
   Hale Boggs eventually became House majority leader. He was
presumed dead in the disappearance of a plane in Alaska in 1972.
   Mrs. Boggs took over his seat in March 1973 after winning a
special election.
   She was re-elected nine times, never getting less than 60
percent of the ote. She was appointed to the House Appropriations
Committee, which approves federal spending.
   Apart from her political strength, some black potential
candidates have not challenged Mrs. Boggs out of respect for the
family's steady support of civil rights issues.
   But two blacks have already announced their candidacies this
year _ State Sen. Jon Johnson and lawyer Marc Morial, a son of the
late Mayor Dutch Morial. State Sen. William Jefferson had said he
would probably enter the race if Mrs. Boggs stepped out.

<TEXT>
   Federal and state environmental officials
announced an agreement today intended to clear the way for the
cleanup of dioxin-contaminated Times Beach, which has been an
untouched ghost town since 1983.
   Morris Kay, regional director of the federal Environmental
Protection Agency, announced the settlement with Syntex
Agribusiness Inc., a Palo Alto, Calif.-based chemical and animal
health company, at a news conference.
   Today's agreement calls for Syntex to incinerate the
dioxin-contaminated soil from Times Beach and 27 other sites in
eastern Missouri. Syntex will design and build the incinerator at
Times Beach, and then tear it down and remove it when the cleanup
is complete.
   Times Beach, about 20 miles southwest of St. Louis, made
headlines seven years ago when health officials discovered that
dioxin in waste oil had been sprayed on the town's streets.
   The federal government bought out the town _ 801 homes and
businesses _ in 1983 and began trying to figure out how to clean up
the contaminated streets.
   Syntex, which was not the producer of the dioxin, became
involved in the settlement because it leased a plant owned by one
of its subsidiaries to a company that produced the dioxin as a
byproduct in making a disinfectant.
   Under federal environmental laws, Syntex is considered a
responsible party.
   ``We very pleased with the agreement and we believe the
agreement addresses the local people's concern,'' Kay said. ``We're
not going to allow anything that's unsafe.''
   The EPA has said the entire cleanup of Times Beach and other
Missouri sites will cost about $118 million and could take up to 10
years; Syntex estimates it will take seven years.
   The company declined to say how much it expects to spend on the
cleanup.
   ``We have accepted this settlement because it allows us to use
our scientific and technical expertise to help rid Missouri of
contamination,'' said Syntex spokesman Ray Forrester.
   The agreement was first proposed in 1988, but negotiations,
public hearings and other required procedures had to be held before
today's settlement could be reached.
   Although the settlement brings the start of work closer, it
remains unclear when the first loads of soil will actually be
burned.
   A 30-day comment period is required before the company can even
take the next step, which is to look for a company to design and
build the temporary incinerator.
   And some people who live near Times Beach have threatened to
file lawsuits to block the project, saying that the incinerator is
unsafe and may never be dismantled.
   ``There's no doubt in my mind that it will be permanent,'' said
Barney Nelson, mayor of nearby Eureka.

   A bomb blew a hole in the London Stock Exchange on
Friday, but no one was injured and trading hummed along without
interruption on computers. A telephone caller earlier had warned of
an IRA bomb.
   Authorities rushed to the exchange and evacuated scores of
traders and other employees just minutes before the market was to
open to hundreds of visitors.
   Glass and chunks of concrete showered down on Old Broad Street
in the heart of the city's financial district. The stock exchange
index was up for the day, but options trading was suspended until
Monday.
   Five hours after the blast, employees returned to the building.
   ``If the purpose of this callous act was to bring the City
(financial district) to a halt, they have failed singularly,'' said
Andrew Hugh Smith, chairman of the Stock Exchange.
   George Churchill-Coleman, commander of Scotland Yard's
anti-terrorist unit, said the bomb had been planted in a men's
restroom in a visitors' area, and contained 5 to 10 pounds of high
explosives.
   Asked if he believed the Irish Republican Army was responsible,
Churchill-Coleman said, ``That is a reasonable assumption.''
   Police evacuated the building and cordoned off streets after the
first warning was received at 8:02 a.m. The bomb exploded at 8:49,
just 11 minutes before the visitors' area was scheduled to open.
   ``We had only half an hour to reach the scene, evacuate the
building and clear the surrounding streets,'' said police Commander
Hugh Moore. ``If we have been a few minutes later getting there, it
would have been too late.''
   Police, firefighters, evacuated workers and sightseers jammed
the district's narrow streets, marked out centuries ago for foot
and horse traffic. Hundreds of commuters were delayed in cars and
buses caught in traffic jams.
   Churchill-Coleman said a man with an Irish accent made warning
calls to a newspaper, a news agency, the fire brigade, police, the
Salvation Army and the Stock Exchange. Police said the caller used
a code word to confirm that it was an IRA attack.
   There had been no warning before the IRA's bomb attack June 25
at the Carlton Club, a gathering place for Britain's governing
Conservative Party. The IRA, seeking to undermine support for
British rule in Northern Ireland, generally has concentrated its
attacks on government and military targets.
   Churchill-Coleman said it was ``the first time in recent years''
that a code had been given with the warning.
   Police said the bomb destroyed the men's room next to the public
visitors' gallery, which was heavily damaged.
   The explosion tore a jagged hole about 20 feet high and seven
feet wide in the modern concrete building, about 10 feet above
ground level.
   Liz Rowe, 26, a trader at Sumitomo Trust in the Royal Bank of
Scotland building opposite the exchange, said police told her to
run, but she had only traveled half a block when the bomb went off.
   ``It was not as loud as I would have thought. It sounded like
loads of scaffolding falling,'' Ms. Rowe said.
   Joe Phillips, a 21-year-old options trader, said a recorded
warning was broadcast inside the exchange.
   ``Normally they say this was a test, but a proper voice came on
the tannoy (address system) saying, `This is not a test. Get out of
the building,''' he said.
   There had been 30 to 40 people on the trading floor, standing
around reading The Financial Times, looking at their screens and
waiting for trading to start, Phillips said.
   Churchill-Coleman said the restroom had been cleaned Friday
morning but nothing suspicious had been reported by the cleaning
crew. It was not known when the device had been planted, he said.
   A uniformed guard normally searches bags and parcels carried by
visitors before they enter the gallery, which accomodated up to 100
people.
   Stock Exchange staff enter through a separate entrance and are
required to show their photo identification cards, a spokeswoman
for the Stock Exchange said.
   Security television cameras are used in the exchange but they do
not make videotape recordings, Churchill-Coleman said. He said
police had found no witnesses to the planting of the device.
   Churchill-Coleman said posters advertising a confidential
telephone number to report suspicious activities were going up
around London.
   ``The public must be our eyes and ears,'' he said. ``Somebody
out there knows where these individuals are.''
   Police have made similar pleas after other IRA bombings.
   ``There is clear evidence that people are being vigilant,'' said
a Scotland Yard press spokesman, who spoke on condition of
anonymity. ``We are attending a large number of false alarms. We
have always said we'd rather attend a large number of false alarms
and it is clear people are keeping their eyes open and being
careful.''

   President Corazon Aquino on Friday
defended her government against criticism that it has been tardy
and ineffective in aiding victims of a devastating earthquake that
killed nearly 700 people.
   ``Let us not blame others,'' she said in a nationally televised
address, her first since Monday's quake. ``What we need to do now
is help each other.''
   Five days after the earthquake, measuring 7.7 on the Richter
scale, officials said reports of damage and deaths were still
trickling in from remote areas. By latest counts, 674 people were
killed and more than 2,600 injured.
   Mrs. Aquino ordered several aides to take over relief
operations, apparently bypassing the disaster-coordinating agency
led by Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos.
   The president, already beset by Communist rebels, rebellious
military officers and popular discontent, has come under criticism
for a government rescue effort described by many as inadequate.
   The rescuers, for their part, battled poor communications,
fatigue, supply shortages and and equipment problems.
   On Friday, a U.S. Marine OV-1 observation plane taking part in
rescue operations crashed near Baguio, killing one of the two
crewmen. The victim's name was not released pending notification of
kin, and the cause of the crash was under investigation.
   Also Friday, a helicopter carrying Ramos on an inspection tour
made an emergency landing after a cockpit warning light came on.
Ramos transferred to another aircraft and continued his tour.
   Both incidents were near the mountain resort of Baguio, 130
miles north of Manila.
   Rescuers in Baguio dug through the night after finding fresh
blood in a tunnel they had dug under the rubble of the Hyatt Hotel
_ indicating there could be victims alive in the debris.
   But they found only the bodies of a man and a woman. As many as
50 people were believed to have been caught in the hotel when the
quake struck.
   Members of a British rescue team said it was unlikely there were
any survivors in the rubble of seven other Baguio hotels that
collapsed during the quake.
   At least 224 people, including two Americans, were killed in
Baguio during the quake. In addition, more than 120 were feared
dead in eight factories of the Baguio Export Processing Zone, which
caught fire during the quake.
   Power was restored to parts of Baguio, and banks resumed
operations. But more aftershocks rocked the city, terrifying the
city's 120,000 people. Many refused to sleep indoors.
   More than 100 people were believed stranded on highways near
Baguio, and Marines and Philippine troops mounted rescue operations.
   Officials said more than 900 people also were feared stranded in
a mountain pass along the border of Nueva Vizcaya and Nueva Ecija
provinces.
   Rebels who tried to topple Mrs. Aquino in December offered a
truce to help with the relief effort.
   The underground Revolutionary Alliance of the Masses-Soldiers of
the Filipino People said in a statement that ``during this time of
national tragedy'' the rebels would suspend anti-government
activity.
   Many leaders of the rebel movement are graduates of the
Philippine Military Academy, located in hard-hit Baguio.
   Heavy casualties were also concentrated in Cabanatuan, 60 miles
north of Manila, where more than 60 students and teachers were
killed at the Philippine Christian College.
   One girl who was injured at the college told ABS-CBN television
that her class was in the middle of a lesson on earthquakes when
the quake struck and the classroom collapsed.

<HEAD>City Stops Selling Bat Guano Because of Health Concerns</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARNARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GOLD HILL, Ore. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The mayor stopped selling bat guano
because of health concerns, but officials say small amounts of the
natural fertilizer pose little danger.
   Mayor Jay DeYoe stopped filling orders for the bat droppings
this week after a Delaware woman warned that the brown, gritty
substance could spread the fungal disease histoplasmosis.
   ``I got to thinking that if there was any possibility we might
be doing something that might be hurting somebody, we ought to
check it out,'' DeYoe said Thursday.
   However, histoplasmosis is very rare in the West and the chance
of getting it from a small amount of bat guano is remote, said Gary
Stevens, program manager for Jackson County Health Department's
environmental health services.
   ``The disease is normally common in individuals exposed to large
quantitites of chicken manure or bat guano and some type of
disruptive activity such as mining it or removing large quantitites
... where there is lots of airborn potential exposure,'' he said.
   Jacqueline Burgess called City Hall from Marydel, Del., after
reading about the bat guano in her local newspaper, which also
published a picture of DeYoe sniffing a bag of droppings.
   ``It really concerned me that he was doing this,'' she said in a
telephone interview. ``Years down the line he could get it.''
   Eight years ago, Burgess underwent laser surgery to repair a
blood vessel in her eye damaged by histoplasmosis. She said she
probably contracted it as a child when she lived near chicken coops
in southern Delaware.
   Histoplasmosis is a systemic fungal disease that begins in the
lungs and can spread to other organs, according to the Encyclopedia
and Dictionary of Medicine, Nursing and Allied Health. It can cause
pneumonia and is sometimes fatal.
   The disease is caused by the inhalation of contaminated dust and
is common in the rural Midwest, the dictionary said.
   Stevens said he was working with the national Centers for
Disease Control and the state Health Division to learn how to
sterilize the bat guano and make it safe to gather. If all goes
well, sales could resume by next week, he said.
   More than 20 orders of the $1 and $5 bags are waiting to be
filled, said DeYoe.
   An employee of this 1,000-resident town discovered a mother lode
of bat manure in a Gold Hill cave recently and DeYoe decided to
sell it to help support the police department, which has only one
paid officer and six volunteers.

<HEAD>Buckey Jury Reaches Verdict In One of Eight Counts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The jury in Raymond Buckey's second trial
told the judge today that it has reached a verdict on one of eight
counts against the former teacher at the McMartin Pre-School.
   Superior Court Judge Stanley Weisberg told the panelists to
resume their talks, and the one verdict submitted in a sealed
envelope was held in court custody until jurors resolve the
remaining charges.
   The jury has been deliberating for two weeks and heard nearly
three days of repetition of testimony earlier this week.
   Buckey is charged with molesting three young girls who attended
his family's nursery school in Manhattan Beach in the 1980s.
   He and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, were acquitted of 52
molestation counts in an earlier trial. But the jury deadlocked on
some of the charges against Buckey and eight of them were refiled.

   A problem with ground equipment
delayed today's blastoff of an Atlas rocket at least an hour,
putting off the rocket's commercial launch debut on a flight to
carry a satellite that will illuminate Earth's magnetic field.
   NASA and General Dynamics had planned to launch the unmanned
rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station sometime between 3:33
and 3:46 p.m. But workers could not start a compressor that
furnishes gaseous nitrogen to the rocket to keep the satellite cool.
   If the compressor can be started in time, officials planned to
try to launch the rocket during the next opportunity, a 12-minute
period beginning at 4:49 p.m. That will be the last chance for
liftoff until Saturday afternoon.
   The three-year science mission, costing about $258 million,
comes at a critical time for NASA. The space agency is under attack
for the crippled Hubble Space Telescope and a shuttle fleet that,
until this week, had been grounded by fuel leaks.
   ``I don't think we've felt any additional stress,'' NASA manager
Sid Saucier said Thursday. ``But we have a job to do, and we know
what is required to get the job done. We've tried to make sure that
everything was done according to the game plan.''
   The Atlas 1 rocket was to boost the Combined Release and
Radiation Effects Satellite, known as CRRES, to an elliptical orbit
217 miles by 22,236 miles high.
   The satellite is a joint program of the National Aeronautics and
Space Administration and the Defense Department.
   NASA is overseeing the satellite's release of 24 aluminum
canisters at various altitudes during the next year. One or two
canisters will be ejected at a time, releasing chemicals that will
form large, glowing clouds similar in appearance to the aurora
borealis, or the northern lights.
   The clouds will spread along Earth's invisible magnetic field
lines, making them visible to the naked eye.
   Scientists will study the clouds' interaction with charged
particles in the ionosphere and magnetosphere.
   The first canisters will be released in September over the South
Pacific. The first releases visible over North America will be in
early 1991.
   Two such releases already have been made over northern Canada,
originating from a Pegasus air-launched rocket in April. Unmanned
sounding rockets will drop similar canisters this summer and again
in 1991.
   Air Force instruments aboard the 2-ton satellite will probe the
Van Allen radiation belts encircling Earth. Micro-electronic
components also will be exposed to space radiation to determine
whether they could fail in future flights.
   The satellite originally was to have been deployed in 1987 from
the space shuttle. But the 1986 Challenger disaster pushed back the
mission by more than five years, and program managers opted for a
quicker launch and redesigned the satellite to fit into the Atlas.
   Under a barter agreement, the San Diego-based General Dynamics
Space Systems Division received Atlas spare parts and ground
support equipment from NASA in exchange for two launches.
   The Atlas 1 rocket was to have gone up in June. A series of
problems, including a damaged pressurization line and
malfunctioning software, delayed the mission until July.
   Today's launch was to be the eighth commercial rocket launch by
an American company.
   McDonnell Douglas sent up the nation's first commercial rocket,
a Delta, last August. Martin Marietta followed four months later
with its Titan.

   In one of the world's most
quake-prone nations, the study of earthquakes and their effects
commands so little government attention that only one of its 12
seismic stations has a telephone.
   The U.S. Geological Survey said about 30 significant earthquakes
have struck the Philippines since 1976, including a strong quake
that devastated central Luzon island last Monday, killing nearly
700 people.
   Raymundo Punongbayan, director of the Institute of Vulcanology
and Seismology, acknowledged that despite frequent quakes, there
was little interest in studying then.
   ``We have to know how to deal with earthquakes and prepare for
this,'' Punongbayan said. ``We are so helpless.''
   While modern seismological institutes use computers, digital
monitoring devices and acoustical sensors to measure quakes,
Punongbayan said his staff must rely on 15-year-old instruments.
   The institute operates 12 seismological stations nationwide. The
station on Leyte island, 350 miles south of Manila, is the only one
with a telephone, he said.
   The Philippines lies along the so-called Pacific Ring of Fire,
where 80 percent of the world's quakes occur. Between 1966 and
1988, the Philippines, which lies on 10 faults and tremor tracks,
recorded 9,678 quakes, or an average of five a day.
   First reports of earthquakes in the Philippines often come from
monitoring services in Hong Kong or the United States.
   Last February, a quake measuring 6.9 on the Richter scale shook
central Philippine islands. The quake was first reported by
seismologists in Australia.
   Punongbayan says his institute got first word of it when Manila
radio stations telephoned for confirmation.
   Punongbayan said his institute, established in 1986, is alloted
less than 1 percent of the $11.4 billion national budget. Before
1986, the onstitute was an obscure department of the Manila weather
service.

   An explosion rocked a Moscow-bound passenger train
in southern Russia overnight, killing five passengers and injuring
10, Soviet media reported Friday.
   The cause of the blast, which occurred around midnight Thursday
between the second and third passenger cars of the train, was under
investigation, according to the Tass news agency.
   The explosion occurred on the Matveyev Kurgan-Zakadychnoye
section of the Donetsk railway line in southern Russia, just south
of the Ukrainian border near the Sea of Azov, the government
newspaper Izvestia said. The train had departed Thursday from
Tshkaltubo in the republic of Georgia.
   The evening television news program ``Vremya'' showed footage of
the forest-green train, with the heavily damaged second and third
cars. Both cars had a gaping holes blasted outward from where they
were connected.
   Several windows were blown out, with curtains flapping in the
breeze.
   The newscast said 10 passengers were injured. Tass reported the
injured were taken to the central hospital in Matveyev Kurgan.
   Police were working to identify the dead, Izvestia said.
   Traffic on the line has been restored, it added.

   Mayor Marion Barry on Friday signed a law
requiring larger businesses to provide up to four months of unpaid
leave for workers seeking time off to care for ill family members,
including gay partners.
   ``Too many employees have had to choose between caring for their
families and keeping their jobs,'' Barry said.
   The legislation, which sponsors said was the broadest of its
kind in the country, would apply to workers who want leave to care
for a ``family member,'' including newborns, ill relatives or
partners in ``committed relationships.'' Federal workers are not
covered.
   ``This is a very compassionate piece of legislation designed to
protect those who are often most vulnerable _ working women, gays,
children, the elderly,'' said Ivy Young, spokeswoman for the
National Gay and Lesbian Task Force.
   The measure also would provide the same leave for an employee
unable to work because of serious illness.
   District officials could not say how many of the estimated
320,000 civilian work force would be affected.
   The District measure is broader than legislation passed by
Congress but recently vetoed by President Bush. That bill
envisioned leaves up to three months in fewer circumstances.
   The House is scheduled to vote Wednesday in an attempt to
override the presidential veto, but bill supporters say they
probably won't have enough votes.
   The District law would apply immediately to businesses with at
least 50 employees _ including the city government. Compliance
would be required after three years by businesses with 20 employees.
   Claudia Withers, spokeswoman for the Women's Legal Defense Fund,
a public policy advocacy group that monitors laws dealing with
family and women's issues, praised the bill.
   ``Although we always think that paid leave is best ... we think
it'll be the best in the nation,'' she said.
   However, Pedro Alfonso, president of the local Chamber of
Commerce, said the bill goes too far.
   ``It's going to be a tremendous burden on many of the small
businesses, which won't be able to afford to carry the costs of
just letting employees go,'' he said.
   All District of Columbia legislation is subject to override by
Congress, but there was no immediate indication whether an attempt
would be made to do so in this case.

<HEAD>Pro-Democracy Campaign Holds First Legal Rally</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LUSAKA, Zambia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of pro-democracy campaigners held
their first legalized public meeting Friday and said they would
form an alliance to fight for the end of two decades of one-party
rule.
   ``The changes in the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe and South
Africa have woken us up from years of indifference and
despondency,'' said former finance minister Arthur Wina.
   In what Wina called ``an atmosphere of utmost urgency,'' labor
leaders, businessmen, lawyers, academics and at least two other
former ministers attended the gathering at a motel hall outside
Lusaka, the capital.
   The meeting follows President Kenneth Kaunda's end Tuesday to a
ban on multiparty campaigning for the Oct. 17 referendum on
Zambia's political future. In recent months, protests have broken
out in Zambia and several other sub-Saharan African states
demanding an end to traditional one-party rule.
   Speakers who denounced one-party rule and demanded an end to a
26-year-old state of emergency received prolonged applause from
about 300 people in the crowded motel hall.
   Conferees gave a standing ovation to a founder of the ruling
United National Independence Party who declared a new allegiance to
reform.
   ``I was once an advocate of a one-party system,'' said farmer
and businessman Simon Zukas. ``However, I would like to apologize
to the nation for the stand I have taken because it was wrong.''
   The ruling party has been Zambia's only legal political
organization since 1973.
   Frederick Chiluba, head of the powerful Zambia Congress of Trade
Unions, said reformers were demanding the government give up its
emergency powers before the October referendum.
   He said their were fears the referendum would not be conducted
fairly and called for the presence of international observers to
monitor the polling.
   Last month, South Africa ended a state of emergency in all but
one province, and neighboring Zimbabwe earlier this week said it
would give up 25-year-old emergency powers on Wednesday.
   In April, Kaunda announced plans for the referendum and banned
public debate on the issue until arrangements for the vote were
worked out.
   The government drew sharp criticism from conferees Friday for
apparently refusing to update the voters roll.
   Voters were last registered in 1987 for parliamentary elections
that took place the following year.
   Many of those attending the meeting Friday said they would not
be allowed to vote in the referendum because they deliberatly had
not registered under the one-party system.
   About 2.6 million people in this southern African nation of 7.5
million are registered as voters.
   The gathering, organized by a group calling itself The Emerging
Alliance For Democracy And Development, disputed claims by Kaunda
that pluralism will cause tribal strife and factional fighting.
   ``We represent a new breed of Zambians for whom tribe is not a
factor in politics. We are talking about national issues,'' said
Akashamba Lewanika, head of the Zambia Economics Association, a
private business lobby.
   Zambia in June experienced the worst civil unrest since
independence from British colonial rule in 1964.
   At least 26 people died in police and army gunfire during
student-led demonstrations protesting food price increases and
continued one-party rule.

   The city horticulturist wants thieves to
leave the municipal parks alone.
   The theft of plants from the parks is growing so fast, the
city's greenhouse sometimes gets bare.
   Park Director Melvin Miller said that shrubbery seems to be the
most popular loot because the plants are easy to yank. Tulips,
roses and trees also are stolen.
   ``No sooner do we plant a bush than someone comes and rips it
out,'' Miller said.
   Along one boulevard, ``the average life of a shrub is about an
hour and a half,'' said Alex Vare, landscape architect.
   ``I guess when everybody's yard is filled up they'll leave the
parks alone,'' said Carl Mattil, Birmingham's horticulturist.
   ``We used to be able to go out once a month with about 25 plants
and replace all the ones that had died or been stolen,'' he said.
``Now we have trucks going out weekly with 100 plants.''

<HEAD>Valenti Sees No Change in Ratings System Despite Judge's Comments</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENISE CABRERA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The founder of the movie industry's rating
system said Friday that moviegoers can be assured the system will
continue to operate despite a judge's recommendations it be revised
or abandoned.
   ``There is no evidence that American parents are clamoring for
change,'' said Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture
Association of America and creator of the 22-year-old rating system.
   Valenti said that film critics and a few movie distributors
criticize the system but that parents have consistently praised it
as ``very useful'' in deciding what movies their children should
see.
   The MPAA's rating system was upheld _ but strongly criticized _
Thursday by New York Supreme Court Judge Charles Ramos, who said he
lacked the authority to change the X rating given to a Spanish
film, ``Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!''
   The movie's American distributor, Miramax Film Corp., and its
producer-director, Pedro Almodovar, had asked the court to change
the rating, saying the designation was arbitrary, capricious,
unfair and a form of censorship.
   Earlier this week, the National Society of Film Critics, in a
letter to Valenti and Richard Heffner, head of the ratings board,
recommended a new A rating for non-pornographic, adults-only movies.
   In his ruling, Ramos ``strongly advised'' there be some
revisions or abandonment of the present system.
   ``The rating system's categories have been fashioned by the
motion picture industry to create an illusion of concern for
children, imposing censorship, yet all the while facilitating the
marketing of exploitive and violent films with an industry seal of
approval,'' he added.
   The judge noted there are no physicians, child psychiatrists or
child-care professionals on MPAA's 11-member ratings board.
   Valenti contended that the judge and others err in concluding
that the system was designed to protect children.
   ``Our mission is very simple. We try to give some advance
cautionary warning to parents and parents make the decision about
what pictures their children should and should not see,'' he said.
   The association said its ratings board is comprised of
``parents'' but won't reveal the identities or other details of
individual members.
   The plan provides for five rating categories _ G, for general
audiences with all ages admitted; PG-13, which cautions parents
about viewing by children 12 and under; PG, for mature audiences
with parental guidance suggested; R, for restricted audiences in
which children under 16 must be accompanied by parent or guardian;
and X, in which no one under 16 is admitted.

<HEAD>Atwater Designates Charles Black as Party Spokesman</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Republican Chairman Lee Atwater named his best
friend as chief spokesman for the party on Friday, saying the GOP
needs a high-profile presence that he can't provide while he's
fighting a brain tumor.
   Atwater, 39, said GOP consultant Charles Black would serve as
his and the party's spokesman until he can return to work fulltime.
   Atwater said his medical treatment does not allow him to be a
daily spokesman, ``and that role is too important to let slip as we
head toward Election Day.''
   The GOP move comes as the party tries to cope with internal
splits on taxes and abortion as well as assaults from the Democrats
on the savings and loan scandal and other issues.
   Atwater, who has been spending his limited work time developing
strategy and advising the White House, has urged the party to take
the offensive against the Democrats.
   ``For the last 18 years, Charlie Black has been my best friend
and political eyes and ears. I've now asked him to also be my
mouthpiece,'' Atwater, 39, said in a statement. ``Charlie speaks
for me and for the party.''
   Black has been the senior consultant to the Republican National
Committee since Atwater became chairman 18 months ago. In his new,
more public role, Black will be available to the media and give
occasional speeches.
   Atwater said his recovery is going well, but he still must spend
several hours each day in physical therapy.
   A parade of officials, including Black, Vice President Dan
Quayle, RNC chief of staff Mary Matalin, and others tried to put
the party on the offensive as the Republicans held their mid-year
meeting in Chicago last week.
   Atwater pronounced the meeting a roaring success.
   ``Watching it all made it clear to me the need to have the
strongest possible spokesmen available to carry our message to the
public on a day-to-day basis,'' he said.
   Black said the Chicago meeting and the approach of the campaign
season prompted Atwater's move. ``We need more spokesmen, more
people out there carrying the ball,'' he said.
   Asked in Atwater was being supplanted, Black said no _ ``not
since it's me he's designated to speak for him. I've been his alter
ego all along. Even before he got sick, if he was too busy or
traveling or something ... I'd be the guy to do it a lot of times.
This is just formalizing what I've been doing.''
   Black said Atwater would do occasional interviews. But he said
the RNC chairman would spend most of his limited time and energy as
a behind-the-scenes party strategist.
   RNC spokeswoman Leslie Goodman said Black's new visibility will
be an enhancement of his role, ``not a diminution of anybody
else's.'' He will continue his work as a GOP consultant and attend
to party business as needed, she said.
   In his statement, Atwater said his doctors have determined that
``my tumor has stopped growing and is dying.'' In an interview this
week with the Columbia (S.C.) State, he said he might be able to
work five to eight hours a day by mid-August.
   ``I feel good. The doctors are optimistic. I'm optimistic,''
Atwater told the newspaper. ``But this is a big enemy. I'm not
going to say anything premature.''

   Jurors having problems deciding on
racketeering and murder charges in the 1985 slaying of a drug agent
were given new legal instructions Friday by a federal judge.
   ``You should follow the law regardless of where it takes you,''
U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie said in trying to clarify the
charges for jurors who had expressed confusion about them.
   Rafeedie told jurors their only duty ``is to determine whether
the government proved its case.''
   He rejected a defense request to ask jurors about the problems
they reported they were having Thursday. They sent a note to the
judge then, asking to break off their deliberations an hour earlier
than usual.
   The panel began weighing the evidence Monday after a nine-week
trial in the case of three Mexicans and a Honduran charged in the
Guadalajara slayings of drug agent Enrique Camarena and three other
men.
   Rafeedie summoned jurors into court before they resumed their
deliberations Friday and told them he was changing one legal
instruction to clarify an accusation.
   In order to find the defendants guilty of conspiracy to commit
violent acts in aid of racketeering, he said they must find the men
conspired to kidnap and murder Camarena rather than an unspecified
drug agent.
   The Honduran defendant is Juan Ramon Matta Ballesteros. The
three Mexican defendants are Ruben Zuno Arce, the brother-in-law of
former Mexican President Luis Echeverria; Juan Jose Bernabe
Ramirez, a former Mexican homicide officer and Javier Vasquez
Velasco, who is accused of murdering two American tourists in an
apparent mistake killing.
   Prosecutors allege that Camarena was murdered because of his
skill in wiping out marijuana and cocaine plantations in Mexico.
They said he had cost drug barons $5 billion in profits.

   Paul Simon is planning a benefit concert _
call it ``Bluff Aid'' _ to rescue the landmark lighthouse at
Montauk Point from the erosion threatening its existence.
   The 18th-century lighthouse is endangered by two centuries of
pounding water that has cut 240 feet off the bluff where it stands.
The erosion has left the lighthouse just 57 feet from the water.
   The show by Simon, who has a house near the lighthouse, will
raise part of the $500,000 needed to save the lighthouse.
   Officials said 6,000 tickets at $25 apiece will go on sale
Saturday for the Aug. 30 show at Deep Hollow Ranch in Montauk.
Sales of programs and souvenirs, along with program advertising,
also will go to the lighthouse.
   The Lighthouse Committee of the Montauk Historical Society
contacted Simon last year and discussed with him the difficulty of
raising money to combat the erosion problem, said panel Chairman
Richard White.
   The singer subsequently volunteered to help.

   Court bailiffs entered retired tennis
star Bjorn Borg's seaside home Friday to assess its value before a
possible sale.
   Bjorn Mellin, a court official, said after a two-hour inspection
that the property could be auctioned if Borg fails to pay a $1
million debt.
   But, Mellin added, the auction won't take place until September
at the earliest because of vacations in the department that handles
such cases.
   The bailiffs previously visited Borg's home June 21 to establish
a valuation, and nobody was home. Borg was out Friday, but one of
his employees opened the door.
   The house's value is put at $1.7 million-plus.
   The courts put a lien on Borg's house until he honors a personal
guarantee to a finance company for his former business partner,
Lars Skarke. Skarke, managing director of Borg's fashion business
until it collapsed last year, owes the finance company $1.1 million.
   Borg's lawyer, Henning Sjostrom, said earlier Borg planned legal
action against Skarke aimed at getting the money back.
   Skarke has sued Borg for $82 million to compensate for profits
he claimed the company would have made if Borg had kept it in
operation. The business, though successful, became overextended and
could not meet its debts. Borg refused an offer of outside capital
because he wanted to keep control.
   Borg, who retired in 1983, won an unprecedented five straight
Wimbledon titles from 1976 to 1980 and six French Open crowns, and
amassed a personal fortune of about $105 million.

   Everyone knows the ``Bo Knows ... '' advertising
campaign.
   And that success created a problem for Jim Riswold, associate
creative director at Nike's ad agency Wieden &amp; Kennedy in Portland,
Ore.
   ``It was a hard act to follow,'' said Riswold, copywriter on
both campaigns. ``We kept coming back to the question: How does Bo
do all these things? And we decided, well, Bo is more than one
person. We decided to use the dumbest joke in the history of
advertising.''
   For the new ad, Nike's admakers decided to have Bo Jackson don
gear used in a dozen different sports _ not only his Kansas City
Royals baseball uniform and his Los Angeles Raiders football suit.
   Each Bo was shot separately; skillful editing made it appear
they were gathering one by one in a locker room.
   Bo Football tries to guess Bo Baseball's name. Bo Cyclist
screeches to a halt and asks, ``Where's that Tour de France
Thing?'' Bo Hockey sports ``Le Bo'' stitched across his jersey.
   Cher's one-time beau _ and husband _ Sonny Bono even wanders in

   At least 25 states have some kind of family or
medical leave program, according to the National Womens Legal
Defense Fund.
   Connecticut, Maine and Wisconsin have family and medical leave
legislation similar to the law signed Friday by District of
Columbia Mayor Marion Barry, but the definition of family is more
limited.
   New Jersey has a family-leave only legislation, while Minnesota,
Oregon, Rhode Island and Washington state have parental leave laws.
   Kentucky has an adoption leave law only.
   Ten other states _ California, Hawaii, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana,
Massachusetts, Montana, New Hampshire, Tennessee and Vermont _ and
Puerto Rico have pregnancy disability leave laws in which women are
permitted time off only for the time they are physically unable to
work because of pregnancy or recovery.
   Florida, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania
and West Virginia have a variation of family or pregnancy
disability leave for state employees only.
   Illinois has passed a medical leave bill similar to the
district's but it only provides six weeks of leave for every two
years.
   Missouri passed a pregnancy leave law but it was vetoed by the
governor.
   The fund said its tally was as of January.

<HEAD>`Protection Plan' Announced for 25 Civil War Sites</HEAD>

   The federal government will ask private groups
and state and local governments to cooperate in preserving the
nation's historic battlefields, Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan
said Friday.
   The ``American Battlefield Protection Plan'' eventually will
cover all wars fought on U.S. soil, but will begin by focusing on
25 key Civil War sites, Lujan said.
   Because the government can't afford to buy all the land
involved, he said, a cooperative effort is needed to make sure the
farms and fields where Union and Confederate soldiers fought aren't
overwhelmed by shopping malls and industrial parks.
   ``We want the governors, local governments, foundations,
corporations and owners to all join,'' Lujan said in an interview
on NBC-TV's ``Today'' program.
   ``Some of the battlefields, for example, would be purchased, but
some of them can be commemorated simply by easements, some of them
maybe the owner would want us to put a plaque there commemorating
that particular battle,'' he said. ``We don't have enough money
just to go off and buy all these sites.''
   Details of his plan, which includes a request for $15 million in
seed money, will be explained Saturday when Lujan speaks at
Manassas National Battlefield Park in Virginia in ceremonies
marking the 129th anniversary of the First Battle of Bull Run.
   Lujan said he also planned to discuss his ideas with the
governors of the states where the sites to be protected are located.
   Florence Kennedy, director of the battlefield preservation drive
for the private Conservation Fund, praised Lujan's project.
   ``I think the secretary's initiative is a very important one
because it's placing great importance on partnership,'' she said in
an interview. ``This partnership cooperation will be a catalyst to
encourage private sector cooperation.''
   A bitter fight broke out in 1988 over a developer's plans to
build a mall on land adjacent to the Manassas park. Congress later
voted to add the disputed tract to the park, with a final cost
expected to exceed $100 million.
   ``I was in the Congress when we went through the Manassas
fight,'' said Lujan, who represented a New Mexico district in the
House of Representatives for 20 years.
   ``At that time I thought it was the worst way to do it. It's
more expensive, you have to file suits. If we have a planned
program, everything works much better,'' he said.
   As an example of the better way, Lujan cited the Richard King
Mellon Foundation's donation to the federal government three weeks
ago of 10 parcels of land, including important sites from the Civil
War battles of Antietem and Gettysburg.
   Lujan's plan has four parts:
   _Encouraging ``creative public and private land-use tools'' such
as zoning, easements, land-banking and historic district
designation to protect imminently threatened sites.
   _Distribute information on public and private projects to
protect battlefields.
   _Use limited federal funds to encourage land purchases by
private conservation organizations and other public agencies.
   _Develop a national strategy to protect other significant
battlefield sites that aren't imminently threatened, but may be in
the future.

<HEAD>Germanys Mark Anniversary of Failed Attempt to Kill Hitler</HEAD>

<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East Germany's defense minister told a batch
of army recruits Friday to put justice ahead of blind obedience and
remember the officer who once tried to kill Adolf Hitler.
   People in East and West Germany marked a rare moment of
resistance to an evil dictatorship by commemorating the 46th
anniversary of a famous attempt on the Nazi ruler's life.
   Rainer Eppelmann, a clergyman and pacifist who is now defense
minister in East Germany's new democratic government, used the
anniversary to make a point as he swore in 400 new soldiers.
   He told them not to let unthinking obedience to authority dull
their sense of right and wrong. He said ``soldiers should reconcile
the need for order and obedience with law and conscience.''
   ``With that, members of the National People's Army stand in the
tradition of the men who opposed the Nazi dictator,'' he said.
   Eppelmann, at a ceremony in the city of Strausberg just outside
Berlin, swore in the first batch of army recruits who were asked to
defend democracy rather than communism.
   The traditional pledge of the People's Army was rewritten to
reflect the democratic revolt that overthrew the Communist
government last autumn.
   The July 20, 1944, attempt on Hitler's life was supported by a
group of high-ranking German officers, some of whom had earlier
supported the dictator.
   It came after the German army had suffered several military
reverses during World War II.
   Col. Claus Schenk von Stauffenberg, a German count, put a
briefcase containing a bomb at Hitler's feet during a conference,
then went outside the headquarters room to answer a pre-arranged
phone call.
   Another officer then inadvertantly moved the briefcase because
it was in his way. It was placed behind a partition that shielded
Hitler from the blast. He survived and staggered from the rubble.
   The attempt was one of several made on Hitler's life, but it was
the one that came closest to success.
   In East Berlin, East German lawmakers stood up in a salute to
the would-be assassins.
   ``The heritage of these men and women of July 20 should oblige
us to fight dictatorships in every form, to keep peace in Germany
and Europe forever,'' said a declaration endorsed by all parties in
Parliament.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl also praised the
assassination plotters in a statement from the West German capital,
Bonn.
   ``The men and women of the German resistance gave in dark times
a shining example of their unshakeable yearning for freedom,'' he
said.
   Hitler killed himself in 1945 as Allied troops marched on
Berlin. Nazi Germany was divided, and now East Germany and West
Germany are preparing to unify in December.
   Kohl sought to put the anniversary in a historical perspective
of German unification. ``Forty-six years after July 20, 1944, we
are entering a new epoch in the history of our nation.''

   The House ethics committee recommended today
that Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass. be reprimanded for aspects of his
relationship with a male prostitute.
   Committee Chairman Julian C. Dixon, D-Calif., said the committee
voted unanimously for a full House reprimand of Frank, an
acknowledged homosexual. The recommendation will go to the House
floor next week for a vote on whether to accept it.
   The committee said Frank violated a House rule stating that a
member ``shall conduct himself at all times in a manner which shall
reflect creditably on the House of Representatives.''
   Frank violated that rule, the committee said, when he:
   _ Used his congressional privilege to fix 33 parking tickets
incurred by male prostitute Stephen L. Gobie when Gobie was using
the lawmaker's automobile for non-House-related business. Frank,
who used Gobie as a personal aide paid with the lawmaker's own
funds, was ordered to make restitution of an unspecified amount to
the District of Columbia.
   Frank has admitted there were occasions when he had parking
tickets waived, but he said that only happened when Gobie used the
congressman's car for official business. Frank said tickets Gobie
received for non-official business were paid.
   _ Wrote an April 16, 1986, memorandum to the commwealth's
attorney in Alexandria, Va., that contained misleading statements
favorable to Gobie. The misleading statements ``could be perceived
as an attempt to use political influence to affect the outcome of
the administration of Mr. Gobie's probation,'' the committee said.
   There was no immediate reaction from Frank, who was traveling to
Boston and scheduled a news conference for late in the afternoon.
   Expulsion is the most severe punishment the committee have
recommended. The next most serious would be censure, in which a
member stands before his colleagues to hear the speaker read a
letter condemning his conduct. The third most serious is reprimand.
   The decision followed a 10-month investigation that was one of
the most troubling in the history of the Committee on Standards of
Official Conduct.
   In considering whether Frank's behavior brought discredit upon
the House, the panel had to judge conduct that largely was personal
between the liberal lawmaker and Gobie.
   Two key aspects of the case involved official actions, however.
   Frank said he paid Gobie $80 for sex in 1985 and then hired him
as a housekeeper and driver with personal funds in an effort to
improve his life.
   He said he fired Gobie in August 1987 after learning that his
aide was running a prostitution ring out of the lawmaker's Capitol
Hill apartment.
   Frank repeatedly has denied Gobie's allegation that he was aware
of the prostitution operation, and submitted testimony by his
landlady saying the lawmaker was ``stunned'' to learn of the
activity.
   For months, the committee was unable to reach a consensus and
for a time, those favoring a milder letter of rebuke appeared to
have the upper hand. But it gradually became apparent to Chairman
Julian C. Dixon, D-Calif. and others that the rebuke lacked the
necessary votes.
   A reprimand would not satisfy the House's most conservative
lawmakers, however.
   Rep. William E. Dannemeyer, R-Calif. will be ready when the
committee report reaches the floor to propose expulsion instead,
said his spokesman, Paul Mero. That normally is reserved for those
convicted of serious crimes.
   Frank, a five-term liberal Democrat from suburban Boston, is one
of two acknowledged homosexual members of the House. The other
member, Rep. Gerry Studds, D-Mass. was censured for an affair with
a male page.
   Frank is seeking re-election in a race against Republican John
Soto, who has never held public office and who was soundly defeated
two years ago in a bid for state representative in his home town.
   Six members of the House have been reprimanded previously, a
relatively recent punishment that was first used in 1976.

   A 21-year-old leukemia victim who gained
national attention when more than 50,000 people were tested as
possible donors will undergo a bone-marrow transplant within 10
days although an ideal donor has not been found.
   Allison Atlas of Bethesda, Md., told WUSA-TV on Thursday that
her mother will donate the bone marrow. Her mother's bone marrow is
a near match, but not a perfect one.
   ``Ultimately, my condition is progressively getting worse, and
if I don't have the transplant soon and I get a bad infection, I
won't be able to have a transplant,'' Miss Atlas said. ``And I just
don't feel I have the luxury of waiting any longer.''
   She said her mother is looking forward to the operation.
   ``She's excited about doing this. She can't wait to be my
donor,'' she said.
   Fifteen of those tested as a match for Miss Atlas eventually
donated bone marrow to other leukemia patients.

   Julianne Delio said her husband made her
promise she would never let him live in a vegetative state
connected to artificial life support machines.
   Keeping that promise took more than a year of court battles,
cost Delio her job and left the 36-year-old New York woman
emotionally brutalized, she told a Senate subcommittee on Friday.
   ``You cannot imagine the psychological trauma involved in
pleading for the death of the person you love most in this entire
world,'' she said.
   Delio urged lawmakers to pass a bill that would help inform
people of their right to determine their own medical treatment
through such things as living wills and other advance directives
that legally enable others to speak for them if they cannot speak
for themselves.
   But an official of the Health Care Financing Administration,
which handles Medicaid and Medicare, said the bill could allow some
patients to be pressed into making a hasty choice.
   Living wills moved to the forefront of medical issues with the
Supreme Court's decision last month denying the family of Nancy
Cruzan their request to have her feeding tubes removed. Cruzan is
permanently unconscious but is not terminally ill and could live
for years in this condition, doctors say.
   Julianne and her husband, Daniel, were well educated, both with
doctorate degrees and working in the medical field. But he, like
Nancy Cruzan, did not have a living will and had never put his
wishes in writing, Delio said.
   ``We were young and enjoying a happy life,'' she said. ``Who
would have known what was to happen to us?''
   In 1986, when Danny Delio was 33 he underwent a minor operation.
Because of a problem with the anesthesia, he was left brain dead,
permanently unconscious, she said.
   ``His life was essentially over,'' she said of her husband, a
Ph.D. in exercise physiology, an expert in cardiac rehabilitation
and, until then, a marathon runner.
   She and her husband had had extensive discussions about
vegetative states, and ``he made me promise never to let him live
even one day in such a condition,'' she said.
   She requested that his life-support systems be shut off and he
be allowed to die, but the Westchester County Medical Center
refused and she filed a lawsuit. Shortly after that, she was fired
from her job as an assistant professor of medicine at New York
Medical College, which is affiliated with the hospital where her
husband was being treated.
   An appeals court eventually agreed with Delio and ordered the
hospital to terminate treatment or transfer her husband to another
facility that would abide by her wishes. Ten days after he was
transferred, he died in her arms.
   ``Even though the court system eventually worked for us, we were
brutalized by it,'' she said. ``No one should ever have to go to
court under these circumstances. Court is the last place a family
belongs when they are facing their darkest hours.''
   Delio urged the Senate Finance subcommittee on Medicare and
long-term care to approve legislation that would require the
federal Department of Health and Human Services to develop an
educational program to give people information about their options
in determining their own medical treatment.
   Hospitals, nursing homes and other facilities that provide
services to Medicare and Medicaid patients would be obligated to
provide such information as a condition for participating in these
programs, under the bill.
   ``What this issue is about is people's ability to make their
wishes known ... so when they can no longer speak for themselves,
they will already have spoken,'' said Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo.,
sponsor of the bill.
   ``This is a communications problem,'' he said. ``It's an issue
of letting people know ... how they can take steps so that worst
nightmare doesn't come to pass.''
   Rep. Sander Levin, D-Mich., who is sponsoring similar
legislation in the House, said the bill ``is about empowerment of
the individual. Without knowledge there is no power.''
   Gail Wilensky, who heads the Health Care Financing
Administration, testified that while she agrees with the goal of
educating people about living wills and other advance directives,
she opposed making such activities a federal requirement.
   She said the bill does not provide adequate safeguards for poor
and vulnerable patients, who could be pressured into making hasty
decisions. Decisions about living wills should be made before
someone gets to a hospital, she said.
   Wilensky said awareness of living wills was ``not directly and
immediately related to quality of care,'' and therefore should not
be made a requirement for participation in the Medicare or Medicaid
programs.
   Delio took strong exception to that saying, ``if (informing
patients of their rights) is not quality of care, I don't know what
is.''

   A man jailed on charges of threatening to
shoot President Bush said Friday he did not even know Bush was
going to be in Cheyenne.
   Gregory Joseph Hill, 34, of Fremont, N.H., was charged with the
felony of making a threat to kill the president and was ordered
held without bond at least until Bush completed his trip to
Cheyenne on Friday afternoon.
   Hill is accused of twice telling someone in a Cheyenne bar
Wednesday: ``I'm here to shoot the president.''
   But the unemployed data processor told U.S. District Judge
Clarence Brimmer on Friday that when he arrived in Cheyenne as part
of a cross-country trip, he did not know the president was planning
to visit.
   ``I realize the seriousness of this,'' he said. ``I can't
believe something like this could happen to me. I'm not a violent
person.''
   Hill was arrested at a motel Thursday evening after the man he
spoke to in the bar reported his statements to Secret Service
agents.
   A complaint filed in U.S. District Court on Friday said at the
time of his arrest, Hill admitted making the statement.
   ``Oh, God, I should have never said what I did,'' Hill was
quoted as saying at the time of his arrest.
   U.S. Attorney Richard Stacy said Hill possessed no weapons when
he was arrested.
   Brimmer ordered Hill held without bond after Stacy argued he
posed a threat to the community and would likely flee the state if
released on bail.
   The judge also agreed with Stacy that Hill should be held at
least until Bush's departure Friday evening, and said he would hold
a bail hearing for Hill on Saturday or Monday.
   ``Because this is such a serious matter, I will order you to be
detained without bond at least until the president's visit is
over,'' he said. ``While you speak well, look well and don't appear
to be a violent person, I have no way of judging that except
through what you say.
   ``The safest bet, for the sake of the nation, is to have you
detained.''
   If convicted, Hill could face a maximum penalty of five years in
prison and a $250,000 fine.

   A federal appeals court panel today vacated
Oliver North's three Iran-Contra felony convictions and ordered a
lower court to determine whether his trial was tainted by
congressional testimony he gave under a grant of immunity. One of
the three was reversed outright.
   The 2-1 ruling ordered a ``witness by witness'' hearing into
whether the evidence presented at North's trial violated his
constitutional right against self-incrimination.
   The former National Security Council aide was convicted on May
4, 1989, of three of 12 counts stemming from the Reagan
administration's clandestine effort to sell arms to Iran and aid
the Nicaraguan Contras.
   The divided three-judge panel reversed North's conviction on the
charge of altering and destroying sensitive NSC documents, finding
that U.S. District Court Judge Gerhard Gesell gave erroneous jury
instructions. North also was convicted of accepting an illegal
gratuity and aiding and abetting the obstruction of Congress.
   The court held that North was entitled to a full hearing on all
three counts delving into whether his nationally televised
testimony seeped into the case.
   The ruling also could signify problems for the conviction of
former national security adviser John Poindexter, who was convicted
earlier this year of five felonies in the scandal. Poindexter, like
North, gave immunized testimony to Congress.
   Independent counsel Lawrence Walsh, who supervised the
Iran-Contra investigation, said he was considering what his next
step will be.
   ``Everyone familiar with these proceedings has recognized the
difficulties presented by the grant of immunity by Congress,'' he
said in a statement. ``We have diligently tried to work around
these difficulties.''
   He said the Iran-Contra investigation was continuing. The grand
jury hearing the matter was in session Friday.
   Neither North nor his lawyer, Brendan Sullivan, was immediately
available for comment.
   North, a former Marine lieutenant colonel, described for
Congress and a spellbound national television audience in July 1987
how the Reagan administration secretly sold arms to Iran and then
used the profits to aid the Nicaraguan Contras. He was guaranteed
that his testimony would not be used in any criminal case against
him.
   If Gesell determines at the hearing that such tainted evidence
was used to convict North on the other two charges, the court said
he would be entitled to a new trial on those counts as well.
   Gesell ``must hold a ... hearing that will inquire into the
content as well as the sources of the grand jury and trial
witnesses' testimony,'' said the court.
   ``That inquiry must proceed witness-by-witness; if necessary, it
will proceed line-by-line and item-by-item,'' said the appeals
court.
   ``We readily understand how court and counsel might sigh prior
to such an undertaking,'' the appeals court said of the prospect of
such a hearing.
   ``Such a ... proceeding could consume substantial amounts of
time, personnel, and money, only to lead to the conclusion that a
defendant _ perhaps a guilty defendant _ cannot be prosecuted,''
the court said.
   The government must show by a preponderance of the evidence that
``no use whatsoever was made of any of the immunized testimony
either by the witness'' or by the Iran-Contra prosecutor's office
in questioning the witness, said the court.
   ``This burden may be met by establishing that the witness was
never exposed to North's immunized testimony, or that the allegedly
tainted testimony contains no evidence'' that wasn't obtained
before North testified, the panel added.
   ``Unless the District Court can make express findings that the
government has carried this heavy burden as to the content of all
of the testimony of each witness, that testimony cannot survive the
... test,'' said the opinion.
   The major rulings were supported by two Reagan administration
appointees, David Sentelle and Laurence Silberman. Chief Judge
Patricia Wald, a Carter administration appointee, dissented.
   North was convicted on May 4, 1989, by a federal court jury
after a two-month trial and placed on two years' probation. North
also was fined $150,000 and ordered to perform 1,200 hours of
community service.
   The obstruction of Congress conviction focused on North's
concealment of the fact that U.S. officials knew about a
CIA-assisted shipment of Hawk missiles from Israel to Iran at the
time the delivery was occurring, in November 1986.
   The gratuity involved his acceptance of a $13,800 home security
system from Richard Secord, whom North had enlisted to airlift arms
to the Contras. Secord is a retired Air Force major general turned
businessman. North said he had received terrorist threats against
his family and that the security system was not compensation for
his official duties.
   On the conviction that it reversed, the court held that Gesell's
jury instruction ``allowed the jury to convict without unanimously
concluding that North committed any one of the criminal acts
charged'' in that count.
   The ``jury could have found that North violated (the statute) in
several different ways'' without agreeing unanimously that he
committed a single illegal act, the court said.
   ``The circumstances of his destruction, alteration, and removal
of documents were distinct; any of those activities could serve as
an underlying criminal act,'' the court said in its unsigned
opinion.
   The verdict makes it impossible to determine whether the jury
agreed unanimously that North, who claimed that he considered his
actions lawful, actually intended to violate the law when he
altered or destroyed documents, the majority said.
   Wald said that ``I ... am satisfied that North received a fair
trial _ not a perfect one, but a competently managed and a fair
one.'' She said North received ``all of the constitutional
protections to which he was entitled.''
   ``As in all trials of this magnitude, a few errors were made,
but ... I do not find, singly or cumulatively, that any of them
rose to the status of reversible error,'' said Wald.

<HEAD>Senate Rejects Plan To Allow Additional Grain Production</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Associated Press Writer&equals;
   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The Senate on Friday voted down a proposal to
allow farmers to grow additional amounts of grain before being
subjected to government management controls.
   The amendment to the 1990 farm bill was offered by Sen. Rudy
Boschwitz, R-Minn., who said the acreage reduction program in the
legislation hurts the ability of U.S. farmers to compete in the
world market.
   But supporters of the acreage reduction plan prevailed in their
arguments that it was needed to control the size of surpluses and
stabilize prices. The amendment was defeated 50-37.
   Boschwitz said the program requires farmers to idle some of the
most fertile land in the country.
   ``We have foregone production and in the process given the
markets to the Europeans,'' said Boschwitz.
   Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., argued that the Export Enhancement
Program was designed to get those markets back and could be used
more effectively by the Bush administration.
   Kerrey said huge grain surpluses are expensive for the
government.
   ``One of things we're trying to do is balance the taxpayer
desire to keep costs down and producers need for stability,'' he
said.
   The Boschwitz amendment was the second major attack on the bill,
designed by the Senate Agriculture Committee to set farm policy for
the next five years.
   The first came Thursday in the 66-30 defeat of an amendment
offered by Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., that would have eliminated
subsidies to farmers with gross sales over $500,000 a year.
   An Agriculture Committee source, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said defeat of the two amendments was a good indication
that the general provisions of the committee's bill would stand.
   Debate will continue next week, with a battle over the sugar
program expected Tuesday. Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J., has introduced
an amendment that would reduce the loan rate on raw sugar from 18
cents to 16 cents a pound. It is supported by the Bush
administration.
   The sugar program is one of the most controversial support
systems in U.S. agriculture policy. Though it does not require
direct government payments, it controls supply by limiting the
amount of sugar that can be imported, thereby keeping prices high.
   Candy makers and other sugar users dislike the program because
they are kept from buying the cheaper world-price sugar. Foreign
policy makers say it works against U.S. objectives in places like
Central America, where sugar is so easily grown.
   ``While the taxpayers shell out considerable sums of money for
military and foreign assistance to the region, the sugar program
blithefully undermines our national security by closing our market
to one of the few ways these same countries have to earn money,''
said Bradley.
   The House begins debate on its version of the farm bill on
Monday.

<HEAD>Measure Would Reimpose Ad Limits On Children's TV</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Senate-passed bill would reimpose
advertising time limits on children's television shows and require
stations to provide some programs just for kids.
   The bill, sent to the House after a unanimous consent vote late
Thursday, would limit commercials to 10.5 minutes per hour on
weekends and 12 minutes per hour on weekdays for kids' programs on
both broadcast stations and cable. Similar restrictions were lifted
from broadcasters in 1984.
   The measure also would:
   _Require the Federal Communications Commission to complete an
investigation that could affect so-called program-length
commercials that feature toys.
   _Require broadcasters to provide more educational and
informational programming for kids.
   _Establish a $10 million public TV endowment for children's
educational programs.
   Broadcasters were able to water down provisions that would have
required stations, in order to gain an FCC license renewal, to show
they had substantially increased airings of programs ``specifically
designed'' for kids' educational and informational needs.
   The bill would allow the FCC to consider non-broadcast efforts
on behalf of kids by stations, such as programming guides.
   Despite the last-minute compromises, the bill marks a sharp
turnaround from Reagan-era deregulation of children's TV and
post-1984 FCC policy that children's needs can be served by the
``broad marketplace,'' including cable TV, public television and
VCRs.
   The bill also represented a personal victory for longtime
advocate Peggy Charren, head of Boston-based Action for Children's
Television.
   ``I've only been waiting for this for something like 22 years _
for children to be part of the audience the broadcast licensee is
obligated by law to serve,'' Charren, who founded ACT in 1968, said
in a telephone interview.
   ``We think this is the first step in getting millions of points
of educational light into American living rooms without raising the
deficit. I'm sure that everyone who cares about children will be
applauding the president when he signs the bill into law,'' she
said.
   A similar bill is pending in the House, where quick passage also
is expected. President Bush has not indicated whether he would sign
a children's TV bill, but the Justice Department last year
recommended that he veto the bill because it intrudes into program
content. President Ronald Reagan vetoed a similar measure in 1988.
   The National Association of Broadcasters generally has supported
the bill, but resisted a competing measure by Sen. Tim Wirth,
D-Colo., that would have imposed tighter ad limits, required the
larger amount of educational and informational programs and
outlawed program-length commercials.
   NAB maintained that family-type programs such as the ``Cosby
Show'' or National Geographic specials should count towards
broadcasters' obligations to children. The House bill allows
broadcasters to serve the needs of children through their ``overall
programming.''
   NAB spokesman Walt Wurfel said the compromise bill ``does a lot
to protect the interests of children, but it still recognizes that
the essential element of broadcasters being able to provide this
programing is a healthy flow of advertising revenue.''
   Until 1984, the FCC had limited commercials on children's TV
programs to 9.5 minutes per hour weekends and 12 minutes weekdays.
During congressional hearings on the House and Senate bills, there
was testimony that the amount of commercial ad time has grown
dramatically on kids' shows since 1984, while the amount of
informational and educational programs for kids had declined
sharply.

   NBC entertainment chief Brandon Tartikoff
went so far as to perform a rap duet with Fresh Prince in
acknowleding the challenge posed by Fox Broadcasting Co. and his
own network's subpar performance last year.
   Tartikoff, 41, and rapper Prince, aka Will Smith of NBC's new
fall series ``Fresh Prince of Bel Air,'' closed their rap duet
Thursday with ``We're hungry and we got a taste for Fox.''
   ``The Simpsons,'' the highest-rated Fox Broadcasting Co. show,
is scheduled against NBC's top-rated ``Cosby Show'' this fall.
Tartikoff has dismissed it and other Fox hits as tasteless appeals
to the lowest common denominator.
   NBC's biggest hope for new steam is the Fresh Prince series, in
which Smith plays an inner city youth who moves to the affluent Los
Angeles enclave.
   NBC's 1989 fall schedule ``had our share of disappointments,''
Tartikoff said. Those disappointments, he said, including
``Mancuso, F.B.I.'' and ``Hardball,'' which have been canceled.
``We got off our game,'' he said.
   Much of Thursday's news conference concerned NBC's plan to start
its fall season early.
   Last week, Fox announced plans to air one of its highly
publicized fall series, ``Babes,'' on Thursday, Aug. 23 _ the same
night ``The Simpsons'' moves to 8 p.m. Thursday against ``The Cosby
Show.''
   On Thursday, NBC said its series ``Ferris Bueller,'' a spin-off
on the hit teen-age feature film, will preview on August 23 against
``Babes.''
   Others of NBC's nine new programs, including ``Parenthood,''
``Working It Out,'' and ``Law and Order,'' also will be
``double-pumped,'' or shown twice before the traditional fall
schedule begins, Tartikoff said.
   Most of Tartikoff's remarks concerned his newly created job as
NBC Entertainment Group president.
   He said his new job as a kind of network guru for all
programming and NBC's in-house production company comes at a time
when he was growing tired of the daily grind.
   Tartikoff said even though he is credited with making NBC the
No. 1 network, he has been doing it for 10 years, and felt ``I may
get to a point where I don't want to do this anymore.''
   Four top-level managers have new titles, but the realignment
apparently means only that Tartikoff no longer will be involved in
day-to-day network entertainment, and if you have a new pilot to
pitch, ask for Warren Littlefield, not Tartikoff.
   Littlefield, former executive vice president of prime time
programming, takes Tartikoff's old title of entertainment
president. Replacing Littlefield is Perry Simon, formerly senior
vice president of prime time shows.
   John Agoglia, executive vice president of NBC productions, takes
on the additional duties of heading the recently formed NBC
Enterprises, which handles international distribution and satellite
business ventures.

<HEAD>Arab Nations Try to Mediate Kuwait-Iraq Dispute</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KUWAIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Arab leaders worked Friday to try to settle a
Persian Gulf dispute that flared when Iraq launched a series of
verbal salvos at its neighbor and former ally, Kuwait.
   Kuwaiti officials and diplomats have suggested Iraq's sudden
outburst of belligerence is aimed at getting its creditors _
including Kuwait _ to write off billions of dollars in debts from
the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war.
   The Arab League's secretary-general, Chedli Klibi, flew to
Kuwait Friday, and King Fahd of Saudi Arabia and President Hosni
Mubarak of Egypt have also appealed for moderation.
   Mubarak urged the two states to settle their differences by
``brotherly, constructive dialogue.''
   Baghdad has denounced Kuwait for what it says are border
violations and oil overproduction.
   Kuwait denies border encroachments and has asked an Arab League
committee to help settle the longstanding border dispute.
   Iraq has also demanded compensation for an estimated $2.4
billion worth of oil it says Kuwait stole from a border field.
Kuwait denies the charge.
   Iraq's President Saddam Hussein has accused Kuwait and the
United Arab Emirates of costing Iraq $14 billion in oil revenues by
overproducing and driving down prices.
   Saddam said production by the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait
beyond ceilings set by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries caused a recent fall in oil prices. He threatened use of
force to retaliate.
   In reports on the dispute, Kuwait's pro-government media played
up the ``noble Kuwaiti stance and sacrifices'' during the Iraq-Iran
war, when the emirate was a target of Iranian missile attacks,
attacks on its vital oil shipping lanes and terrorism by
pro-Iranian activists.
   Kuwait was second only to Saudi Arabia in an Arab effort that
pumped about $40 billion into Iraq's coffers during the war. The
United Arab Emirates also contributed.
   Gulf-based diplomatic sources said Saudi Arabia's King Fahd,
using the strong personal link he forged with Saddam during the war
years, has been in frequent contact with Baghdad over the dispute.
   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, also said
United Arab Emirates President Sheik Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, in
Morocco on a private visit, had expressed willingness to help
settle the financial aspects of the dispute.
   The Kuwait government Thursday night called off a state of alert
for its armed forces, which had been declared Wednesday.
   Iraq, with a population of 17 million, has a 1-million-man army,
as well as an arsenal of chemical weapons. Kuwait, with only 1.7
million residents, has 20,300 members of the armed forces.
   Despite the apparent cooling down, officials in Baghdad reported
that thousands of Kuwaitis visiting Iraq were heading home. Iraqi
media continued to accuse Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates of
``usurping Iraq's rights.''
   The Gulf region includes about two-thirds of the world's proven
oil reserves, so instability in the area brings nervous reactions
among oil consumers.
   However, the prospect that Kuwait and the U.A.E. will stop
producing over their OPEC ceilings has brought a rally in oil
prices.

<HEAD>Move Over, Cow Pie Bingo; Rubber Ducky Races Are Here</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   So you say your favorite charity's hurting for a
good fund-raiser? Masquerade balls are a bore; bachelor auctions
are passe; Cow Pie Bingo has come and gone. Catch hold of the
latest craze: rubber ducky races.
   In such places as Nashua, N.H., San Jose, Calif., Kansas City,
Mo., and Chicago, men, women and children are flocking to
reservoirs, rivers and ponds to cheer on the little yellow
critters, according to a company that has leased the non-toxic
ducks to organizations in those communities.
   It's all in the interest of their favorite good cause.
   ``We've had the golf outings, the dinner dances _ pretty
standard things,'' Northern Illinois Medical Center administrator
Bob Blazier said Friday. ``But this, this is different.''
   On Saturday, about 5,000 ducks hit the waters of Boone Creek in
McHenry, 20 miles northwest of Chicago, on the hospital's behalf.
   For the past few weeks, hospital supporters have been buying
duck ``adoption papers'' at $5 a pop, or a flock of 10 ducks
(complete with duck T-Shirt) for $50. Adoption papers sport a
number corresponding to a number on a rubber ducky's bottom.
   On Saturday, the duckies themselves will be ceremoniously dumped
from a truck into Boone's Creek for a race to the finish line.
   First duck through the ``duck trap'' _ a contraption rigged
across the finish line that pulls the ducks in order from the water
_ wins.
   But that's not until after the ``guess the ducks in the truck''
contest, to determine just how many of the fist-sized rubber ducks
will be paddling for the finish line.
   Boone Creek's duck race is just a drop in the bucket compared to
Illinois Masonic Hospital's August duck dash, in which participants
can, for $250, become VID's _ Very Important Ducks.
   In that contest, about 30,000 rubber ducks will be dropped off
Chicago's Michigan Avenue bridge for a race down the Chicago River.
If the current isn't strong enough that day, a Chicago Fire
Department boat will be standing by with water cannons to propel
the ducks forward.
   The fund-raising ducks are largely the brainchild of a Phoenix,
Ariz., company that says it drew on a 19th century Irish pastime
for its inspiration.
   Three years ago, during their first year in business, Great
American Duck Races managed to convince just eight organizations
that duck racing was the way to raise money. This year, 95 groups
have gone to ducks and next year, 103 have already been scheduled.
   ``Racing rubber ducks _ it sounds so silly, but it is serious,''
Michele Brown, the company's event coordinator, said Friday.
   Unlike Cow Pie Bingo, in which fields are divided into squares
and players guess on which square a cow will leave its mark, much
planning has gone into the duck-race business.
   ``We're still working on perfecting the duck,'' said Brown.
Among the considerations: ducks that can withstand high
temperatures and strong blowing winds.
   Ducks that have paddled too far are even retired, spending their
golden years as promotional ducks sold as part of the fund-raiser.
   But the birds are no laughing matter. Brown said 10 races were
conducted last year for a youth charity, Children's Miracle
Network. The races raised $1.3 million for the group, she said.

   Cattle feedlot inventories in the nation's 13
leading beef states totaled 8.76 million head as of July 1, up 1
percent from a year ago but down 6 percent from two years ago, the
Agriculture Department said Friday.
   Increases from a year ago were reported in Arizona, California,
Idaho, Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Oklahoma and Texas. Nebraska was
unchanged, and decreases were reported for Colorado, Kansas, South
Dakota and Washington.
   Marketing of fed cattle for slaughter during April, May and June
totaled 6.01 million head, down slightly from the same period of
1989 but 2 percent above 1988, the report said.
   The placement of new cattle and calves on feed during the second
quarter of the year totaled 5.11 million head, down 2 percent from
1989 and 14 percent below 1988.
   Officials said it was the smallest second-quarter placement of
new cattle in fattening pens since 1975.
   Cattle feeders indicated they expect to market 5.91 million head
during July, August and September, up fractionally from last year's
third quarter but 6 percent below 1988, the report said.
   State feedlot cattle inventories are listed here for the 13
states, which account for about 85 percent of the nation's beef.
The first number is the number of cattle, in thousands, as of July
1, and the second number is the percentage of a year earlier.

<HEAD>House Adopts Bill To Help States Meet Education Goals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House on Friday overwhelmingly passed a
bill aimed at helping states meet national education goals set by
President Bush and the governors.
   The bill, approved 350-25, authorizes $1 billion in new federal
education spending in fiscal 1991 and a total of $5.3 billion over
the next five years for education initiatives.
   The House also voted overwhelmingly, 315-59, to adopt an
amendment requiring suspension of federal student financial aid for
any student convicted of a drug offense.
   Rep. Peter Smith, R-Vt., also won support for an amendment to
allow states and the Education Department to pool resources for
special projects targeted at specific needs in a district. The
projects could be exempt from a wide range of federal and state
requirements.
   ``I think it is a major opening, major reform initiative to
encourage schools to reinvent themselves for sure-fire performance
for all students,'' said Smith, noting he had won endorsements from
the National Governors Association and the president's education
advisory council.
   The bill arose from the education summit Bush and the nation's
governors held in Charlottesville, Va., in September 1989. It
includes several of the statements of education policy goals
requested by Bush as well as broader Democratic plans for spending
programs.
   Bush's original version called for an estimated $400 million in
1991 spending. The House version increases authorization for
remedial assistance to disadvantaged children. It would authorize
$280 million for awards to exemplary schools, and includes money
for Bush's proposed National Science Scholars Program and programs
to fight illiteracy.
   It authorizes more money for financial assistance to college
students willing to enter the teaching profession and for
professional development of teachers.
   The Senate has passed a more limited version of the bill, and
differences will have to be resolved in a conference committee.

   BIOGRAPHY: Master Sgt. Samuel Kanyon Doe led a bloody coup April
12, 1980, that ended the rule of President William Tolbert, who was
killed.
   Doe's presidency has been characterized by numerous coup
attempts, murders and detentions of opposition leaders and
suppression of the country's press.
   Doe permitted elections in October 1985. When opposition parties
appeared to have won the voting, Doe's men burned and destroyed
ballots. The election commission Doe had appointed declared him the
winner.
   The election rigging triggered the worst violence yet under
Doe's rule. At least 1,500 people were estimated to have died,
including Brig. Gen. Thomas Quiwonkpa, who led a coup attempt.
   Quiwonkpa had been a popular commander from Nimba County and his
killing made his home area a fertile base for the Dec. 24, 1989,
invasion of Liberia by rebel leader Charles Taylor.

   BIOGRAPHY: Charles Taylor returned to Liberia from the United
States, where he worked as a factory mechanic, after Samuel Doe
took power in a 1980 military coup.
   Doe named Taylor head of the General Services Administration.
Taylor fled to the United States in 1983 to escape charges of
embezzlement.
   He was arrested in the United States but escaped before he could
be extradited.
   Taylor's revolt began Dec. 24, 1989, when he crossed the Ivory
Coast border into Liberia with a small band of men. They accused
Doe of corruption, mismanagement and human rights abuses. Taylor
based his men in Nimba County, an area hostile to Doe.
   Doe's forces responded with savage attacks on tribal groups that
supported Taylor. International agencies say hundreds were killed,
and the atrocities appeared to have increased support for Taylor.
   As a civilian, however, Taylor insists he is different from Doe,
who made his career in the military. He said he was leading ``a
grassroots civilian uprising to get rid of a dictator'' but
harbored no dictatorial ambitions himself.

<TEXT>
   The chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee is poised to oppose the B-2 bomber, according to
congressional sources. But Rep. Les Aspin, questioned about his
plans Friday, was coy.
   ``Stay tuned,'' the Wisconsin Democrat said in response to
persistent queries from reporters. Aspin did confirm that he will
deliver a major speech on the House floor Monday.
   Congressional sources, who requested anonymity, said Aspin will
likely announce his support for an amendment that calls for ending
the stealth bomber program at the 15 planes now in production.
   Meeting with reporters, Aspin cited five strategic weapons
systems _ the B-2 bomber, the Advanced Tactical Fighter, the
Advanced Tactical Aircraft, the C-17 transport plane and the light
helicopter _ which together would cost more than $300 billion.
   ``You can't have declining defense budgets and buy full bore,''
Aspin said.
   Opposition to the stealth bomber has grown in Congress, where
lawmakers have criticized the price tag of about $860 million a
plane. Faced with a declining Soviet threat and fiscal constraints,
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney announced in April a revised plan for
the program that cut the total number from 132 to 75 and reduced
this year's purchases from five planes to two.
   The revised proposal has had little effect in Congress,
especially in the House, where opponents of the Northrop
Corp.-manufactured aircraft say they are a handful of votes short
on a measure to terminate the program.
   The Armed Services chairman made the comments days before his
panel crafts a defense bill for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1.
The House will draw up legislation based on $283 billion in
military spending, $24 billion less than President Bush proposed in
January.
   To reach the lower total, the committee plans to cut $11 billion
from weapons procurement and $1.9 billion from research and
development of those systems.
   In crafting its version of the bill, the Senate Armed Services
Committee last week approved a $289 billion defense budget that
trims $1 billion from Bush's request of $4.7 billion for the
Strategic Defense Initiative and cuts active duty troop strength by
100,000, including 50,000 troops in Europe.
   Aspin predicted that his committee will produce a lower number
for SDI, commonly known as Star Wars, than the $3.7 billion the
Senate panel approved.
   The chairman also indicated his support for a reduction of at
least 100,000 troops from the armed forces' current level of 2.1
million. The committee is looking to cut $800 million from the
Pentagon's military personnel budget for fiscal 1991, which amounts
to a cut of around 120,000 people plus the cost of benefits
packages, severance pay for enlisted personnel and other programs.
   Aspin also used the session with reporters to renew his support
for an independent commission to determine what military bases
should be closed. The chairman vowed to include an amendment
calling for a commission to the defense bill.
   Earlier this year, Aspin criticized Cheney's list of base
closings as an attack on Democrats in Congress.

   Barristers were allowed to doff their heavy wigs
and animal lovers fretted over thirsty hedgehogs as Britain
sweltered in a heat wave Friday.
   Temperatures reached 90 degrees in Oxfordshire _ not all that
hot by standards in some parts of the world, but enough to pose a
problem for hedgehogs.
   The Vale Wildlife Rescue Centre said it had treated a dozen
dehydrated hedgehogs this week, and appealed for people to put out

<HEAD>Chinese Defector, Two Others Executed in Taiwan for Kidnapping</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Chinese defector and two other men were
executed at dawn Friday for kidnapping the son of Taiwan's richest
tycoon, the Justice Ministry said.
   Relatives of the three men, including Ma Xiaoqin, a sister of Ma
Xiaobin, who defected to Nationalist-ruled Taiwan in 1986, spent
five hours on their knees outside the residence of President Lee
Teng-hui pleading for clemency.
   They ignored presidential guards who told them Lee was out of
town.
   Ma, Wang Shih-chieh and Doung Lung, a Chinese-Vietnamese, were
convicted of kidnapping Chang Kuo-min, 33, the son of shipping
magnate Chang Yung-fa for a ransom of $1.9 million last year. Chang
was eventually released unharmed and the ranson recovered.
   A statement from the Justice Ministry said the three men, all
27, were executed by shots fired into their backs at Taipei's
Tucheng Prison. They were sentenced to death earlier this year.
   Forbes magazine this month listed the elder Chang, chairman of
the Evergreen Group, a conglomerate based on shipping, as Taiwan's
richest man. His fortune was estimated at more than $2 billion.
   The Taiwan government granted Ma Xiaoqin special permission
earlier this month to enter Taiwan to see her brother before his
execution. She said he told her he kidnapped Chang to get money to
return to China.
   Ma and 18 other Chinese defected to Taiwan four years ago after
sailing a fishing boat to South Korea.
   Human rights groups and lawyers held rallies to oppose the
executions. They criticized laws that dictated executions for
kidnappers, saying this could encourage kidnappers to kill their
victims to avoid recognition.

   The court that set aside Oliver North's
Iran-Contra convictions warned Congress that compelling the
testimony of suspected wrongdoers in major scandals is likely to
scuttle future prosecutions.
   The court, in effect, told Congress that it must choose between
its desire to quickly air the details of a major scandal such as
Watergate or the Iran-Contra affair or wait quietly while
prosecutors investigate the participants and put them on trial.
   By compelling testimony of witnesses such as North, lawmakers
are ``taking a great chance that the witness cannot
constitutionally be indicted or prosecuted'' because of Fifth
Amendment protections against self-incrimination, the court said.
   The ruling dealt a severe blow to the work of Independent
Counsel Lawrence E. Walsh, raising the possibility that the
conviction of former National Security Adviser John M. Poindexter
could meet the same fate as North's.
   Both men testified before televised congressional hearings on
the Iran-Contra affair under limited grants of immunity from
prosecution.
   This ``use immunity'' guaranteed that North and Poindexter's
words would not be used as evidence against them.
   But the court felt North's testimony received so much publicity
that his words might have influenced the memory of the witnesses
who gave evidence against him at his 1988 trial.
   ``It may be that it is possible in the present case to separate
the wheat of the witnesses' unspoiled memory from the chaff of
North's immunized testimony, but it may not,'' the ruling said.
   The court ordered the federal judge who presided over the North
case, Gerhard A. Gesell, to conduct a ``witness-by-witness'' and if
necessary a ``line-by-line'' review the trial testimony to make
that determination.
   The 2-1 ruling by the panel of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
here made it clear the majority believes that Walsh will have a
difficult time proving that the evidence was not infected with the
taint of North's congressional testimony.
   ``The fact that a sizable number of grand jury witnesses, trial
witnesses and their aides apparently immersed themselves in North's
immunized testimony leads us to doubt whether what is in question
here is simply `stimulation' of memory by `a bit' of compelled
testimony,'' the ruling said.
   ``Whether the government's use of compelled testimony occurs in
the natural course of events or results from an unprecedented
aberration is irrelevant to a citizen's Fifth Amendment right.''
   If allowed to stand, the ruling would give hard choices in the
future when it is in a race with prosecutors to get to the bottom
of a scandal that shakes the nation like a Watergate or an
Iran-Contra affair.
   ``The government must occasionally decide which it values more:
immunization (perhaps to discharge institutional duties, such as
congressional fact-finding and information dissemination) or
prosecution,'' the ruling said.
   As Congress prepared to hold hearings in 1987, Walsh warned that
it ``would create serious _ and perhaps insurmountable _ barriers
to the prosecution of the immunized witness.''
   In these situations ``you must weigh in the balance whether a
public disclosure of all the facts is more important than a
criminal prosecution,'' said Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill, a member of
the Iran-Contra committee.
   ``It's very difficult to have both without trespassing on
immunized testimony. We made a judgment, Congress did, that we
wanted the public hearing,'' Hyde said.
   The ruling on Friday makes the dilemma even harder for lawmakers.
   ``It makes it almost impossible to have both a public
congressional inquiry and a subsequent court proceeding against the
wrongdoers,'' said Paul Rothstein, a criminal law professor at
Georgetown University's law school.
   ``One or the other is going to have to do,'' Rothstein said.
   But when the next scandal breaks, ``there is really no way of
restraining Congress,'' said Gerald Caplan, a George Washington
University law professor.
   ``I am not sure in a matter of this importance whether public
information about what happens isn't more important than
guaranteeing the accuracy of the jury verdict,'' he said.
   ``We lawyers tend to think that guaranteeing the integrity of
the factfinding process is the most important thing,'' Caplan said.
``But I think in matters of national importance _ Watergate or
Irangate _ there is arguably an overriding public need for
information to make judgments, for example electoral judgments.''

   It's fine to let bygones be bygones, but it was
a tad disconcerting for The New York Times on Friday when the
byline that was supposed to be gone wasn't gone.
   Instead, it said the story was written by ``Fake Byline.''
   Byline's first _ and, the Times hopes, last _ appearance in the
paper came on page A8, where a story about a Texas-Mexico ferry
appeared under bold type declaring ``By Fake Byline.''
   ``The story was not supposed to have a byline on it, but our
computer format doesn't work without one,'' explained Times
spokeswoman Nancy Nielsen. ``We plug in `Fake Byline' so the format
works. It's supposed to be deleted, but ...''
   But an inexperienced computer operator, unsure of working the
equipment, failed to remove the bogus byline and out it went, she
said.
   The byline did not appear in all editions of The Times, so it
was unknown how many readers saw it, she said.

   The United States has no immediate plans to
send a U.S. peacekeeping force to Liberia as requested by officials
of the West African nation besieged by civil war, the State
Department said Friday.
   ``Our policy is to continue to urge both sides to participate in
negotiations to prevent the further loss of life,'' spokeswoman
Margaret Tutwiler told reporters.
   The United States, she said, strongly supports negotiations
aimed at a cease-fire and international peacekeeping force by the
Economic Community of West African States and ``regrets that the
talks have broken down,'' she said.
   Ms. Tutwiler confirmed that President Bush had received an
appeal from Foreign Minister J. Rudolph Johnson, Washington
ambassador Eugenia Wordsworth-Stevenson and eight other prominent
Liberians for a temporary U.S. force to prevent bloodshed until
international peacekeeping machinery is set up.
   Most Liberians would welcome U.S. help in ``averting massive
plunder and tribal revenge'' and in having President Samuel Doe
evacuated from the country, said one of the Liberian signers,
former U.N. Ambassador Winston Tubman.
   They letter said Doe's ``resignation and departure from Liberia
... and the establishment of an interim government'' was expected
soon.
   Rebels on Friday overran most of northern Monrovia, the capital
city, pushing several hundred remaining government troops into a
narrow strip of land on both sides of Doe's executive mansion.
   Witnesses reported many government casualties, and shipping
sources said two Liberian coast guard cutters were sunk in the port
by gunfire.
   U.S. warships with Marine units aboard were moved close to
Liberia several weeks ago.
   The African nation, founded by freed American slaves 150 years
ago, has traditionally had close ties with the United States.

   State health officials complained Friday that
the Agriculture Department has left them to their own devices in
the fight against salmonella enteritidis, a potentially fatal form
of bacteria found in raw or undercooked eggs.
   ``The absence of a coordinated federal response has left states
with no alternative but to take strong action to protect their
citizens from contaminated food often produced in other states,''
John J. Guzewich of the New York State Health Department told a
congressional oversight panel.
   Robert Flentge of the Illinois Public Health Department
complained about ``mixed signals at the federal level'' and
interference with his department.
   A.B. Park of the Maryland Agriculture Department said state
officials began tracing eggs and testing chickens while federal
officials were debating whether salmonellosis is a poultry disease.
   The witnesses appeared before the oversight and investigations
subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.
   The panel's chairman, Rep. John D. Dingell, D-Mich., alleged
that the Agriculture Department was late in recognizing the growing
number of outbreaks traced to the bacteria and withheld information
from the Food and Drug Administration, which also regulates the
food supply.
   Poisoning from the enteritidis form of salmonella has been
increasing steadily since 1982 and is most likely to be fatal among
the very old, the very young and others whose immune systems are
weak, according to the Centers for Disease Control.
   The agency says the increase is directly related to
contamination of Grade A eggs that are eaten raw or undercooked.
Infection has been spread through scrambled, poached and over-easy
eggs, as well as in home-made ice cream, cole slaw, sauces and
dressings.
   Since 1985, there have been 217 outbreaks responsible for 7,370
cases of infection. Of those cases, 44 resulted in death, CDC says.
   Health officials say tracing the food poisoning to a particular
flock is by nature difficult and is made more difficult by the lack
of effective regulation.
   Even an infected flock may produce only one contaminated egg in
1,000, said Dr. Robert Tauxe of the Centers for Disease Control.
Testing all chickens before allowing their eggs to be shipped is
also impossible for now, he said. Organ cultures are required to
find the bacteria.
   The problem can become worse when the eggs reach a restaurant,
nursing home or institution, said Tauxe. One contaminated egg can
contaminate a bowl of 500, he said.
   The state officials complained that federal inspections are
limited to brood hens that produce the laying hens, even though
environmental contamination remains a real risk.
   They also complained that no recall provision exists for eggs
that have reached the market, and that no effective way exists for
tracing eggs.

<HEAD>Costs Higher, Benefits Lower for Land Retirement Program</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Costs of a popular farm conservation program
are expected to be higher and its benefits lower than previously
estimated, an Agriculture Department report said Friday.
   A reassessment of the Conservation Reserve Program, or CRP,
shows federal outlays may be $6.6 billion to $9.3 billion over the
lifetime of the program, 1986 through 1999.
   Meanwhile, the report said, benefits may be $4.2 billion to $9
billion.
   The Conservation Reserve Program is a long-term plan designed by
Congress in 1985 to take 40 million to 45 million acres of highly
erodible cropland from production for 10 years, planting it to
grass and trees.
   In return, farmers get one-time assistance to plant the
protective vegetative cover plus annual rental payments averaging
about $50 per acre.
   An earlier assessment had put net benefits of the program,
assuming the full 45 million acres to be retired, at $3.4 billion
to $11 billion, and net federal costs at only $2.6 billion to $6.6
billion.
   ``The reassessment is based on current enrollment of 34 million
acres and reflects the reduced crops stocks and higher prices
caused by uneven weather other the past few years,'' the report
said. ``Higher prices lessened the commodity program savings that
might otherwise have been attributed to the CRP.''

<HEAD>FCC Fines Indianapolis Station for Sexually Explicit Broadcasts</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Indianapolis radio station has been fined
$10,000 for broadcasting sexually explicit material in violation of
federal indecency rules, the Federal Communications Commission said
Friday.
   The action against WFBQ-FM, owned by Great American Television
and Radio Co. in Cincinnati, was the latest in a spate of moves in
the past year by a newly constituted FCC bent on cracking down on
disc jockeys often called ``shock jocks.''
   The FCC, led by new chairman Alfred Sikes, has issued a number
of warnings and fines against stations, most recently a $20,000
fine in June against a San Jose, Calif., radio station, KSJO-FM.
   In all cases, the commission cited ``indecent'' material
involving sexual innuendo or descriptions of sexual organs
broadcast between 6 a.m. and 8 p.m.
   The commission earlier this month repeated its intention to try
to extend the ban on indecent broadcast material to 24 hours a day.
A court ruling on a 24-hour ban is pending.
   The FCC warned Great American officials a year ago that material
broadcast in 1987 on a show featuring disc jockeys Bob Kevoian and
Tom Griswold on WFBQ-FM and its sister station, WNDE-AM, may have
violated the FCC's indecency rules.
   Those rules prohibit the broadcast during daylight hours of
``language or material that ... depicts or describes, in terms
patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards
for the broadcast medium, sexual or excretory activities or
organs.''
   The commission also reviewed material the station broadcast in
1989 and considered the company's arguments.
   In a letter to Great American officials dated Thursday, the FCC
agreed with the company's assertion that two skits in question were
not indecent.
   But the commission said that material in several other programs
``fit squarely within our definition of indecency.''
   Station manager Chris Wheat said the company had not decided
whether to appeal.
   The fines stem from a complaint filed by John R. Price, a
Carmel, Ind., lawyer who founded Decency in Broadcasting.

   One of Barney Frank's earliest campaign posters
showed the rumpled, pudgy, bespectacled candidate under the caption
``Neatness isn't everything.''
   Later, the liberal congressman cleaned up his act. He lost
weight, spiffed up his wardrobe and shed glasses for contact lenses.
   That's also when Frank _ whose life had been dominated by
political work _ turned to a sex ad on his 45th birthday. The ad
put him in contact with Stephen Gobie, the male prostitute whose
disclosure of the relationship became the big blot on Frank's
10-year career in Congress.
   Two years later, in 1987, Frank publicly disclosed his
homosexuality.
   Observers have said that the sharp-tongued politician was naive
about private personal relationships. Frank himself said he took
Gobie under his wing, believing he could help reform the man he
acknowledges he paid for sex.
   Before the Gobie affair, Frank was best known as one of the most
liberal members of Congress, with a deadly political wit.
   It was Frank who once quipped of the conservative bent of the
anti-abortion lobby: ``Sure, they're pro-life. They believe that
life begins at conception and ends at birth.''
   Frank, 50, a graduate of Harvard Law School, cut his political
teeth as chief of staff to then Boston Mayor Kevin White in the
years 1968-1971. Frank then went to work as a congressional aide.
   Frank first entered the political arena on his own in 1980,
winning the old 4th Congressional District seat after the Rev.
Robert Drinan was ordered to retire by the Roman Catholic Church.
   Then, in 1982, Frank's district was folded into a new area that
stretched from the working-class mill city of Fall River to the
rich Yankee suburbs of Boston. The race pitted Frank against
incumbent Margaret Heckler, a Republican who had carved out a
strong political base in the suburbs where some of the state's most
affluent families live.
   Most of the new district was on Heckler's turf, but Frank raised
$1 million and won with a 60 percent margin.
   Now, despite his troubles over Gobie, Frank is considered a safe
bet to win this year's election. Frank is still popular with
constituents. His lone Republican challenger, John Soto, is a
lawyer-accountant from Attleboro with no experience in elected
office and a stormy relationship with the state GOP hierarchy.
   Soto has played up Frank's homosexuality in the race, calling on
the congressman to take a test for AIDS and make the result public.
But the move has backfired. Audiences have booed Soto, and he has
drawn criticism in the media.
   James Nuzzo, another Republican challenger considered a more
serious threat to Frank's seat, recently dropped out of the race.
   Soto called the House ethics panel's decision to reprimand Frank
a slap on the wrist. ``Mr. Frank's admitted high-risk behavior sets
a terrible example for the youth of America, that is in desperate
need of positive role models,'' he said.
   Although Frank has a strong hold on his district in this year's
race, he could face a tougher fight in the next election if
Massachusetts loses a congressional seat because of its lack of
population growth in comparison to the Sun Belt.
   Massachusetts could lose two seats in Congress, according to
some demographers, basing their predictions on Census projections.
The Legislature will decide which seats go, and conservative
legislators may be inclined to take Frank's seat.
   If the state loses only one seat, and if Rep. Silvio Conte, the
lone Republican in the Massachusetts delegation, retires after more
than 30 years representing the 1st Congressional District, Frank's
seat could be safe.
   But a loss of two seats, or a decision by Conte to stay on,
could pit Frank against another incumbent Democrat.
   For now, though, Frank has regained the fiesty attitude he
admits he lost in the first moments of embarrassment over the Gobie
affair.
   ``There is no question about it. I was unhappy and disappointed
and angry with myself,'' Frank said recently. ``It brought back a
whole lot of things that I had been dealing with in terms of
emotions and some in terms of action that I thought I had dealt
with.''

<TEXT>
   The nation's savings institutions lost $19.9
billion in deposits during the first two months of 1990, nearly
matching the record outflows of a year earlier, the government said
Friday.
   Depositors at institutions still under private ownership
withdrew $13.7 billion more than they deposited during January and
February, the Treasury Department's Office of Thrift Supervision
said in a long-delayed statistical report. Account holders at
failed institutions under government control withdrew a net $6.2
billion.
   At all institutions net withdrawals totaled $13.3 billion in
January, a record topping the previous mark of $10.9 billion in
January 1989, and $6.6 billion in February.
   The two-month total fell just short of the $20 billion drain in
January-February 1989. February marked the 20th deposit drain in 21
months and left the industry's total deposit base at $926.5 billion.
   Economists attributed the outflow to three factors:
   _Deliberate shrinkage by solvent S&amp;Ls trying to meet stringent
capital requirements imposed by last August's bailout bill.
   _A cut in the high interest rates offered by failed institutions
after they come under government control.
   _Lingering confidence problems among depositors at failed
thrifts, despite government insurance guaranteeing each account up
to $100,000.
   ``I would expect we'll have deposit outflows for quite some time
to come. I don't think we'll see the end of it until next year.
This industry is undergoing monumental restructuring,'' said
economist Martin Regalia of the National Council of Savings
Institutions.
   Friday's report was the first 1990 data released for thrifts.
Normally by this time, deposit flow information current through May
would have been available. But computer problems plus disarray
caused by the reorganization of the S&amp;L bureaucracy under last
year's law delayed the reports.
   Economist James Barth of Auburn University, a former chief
economist at the thrift office, criticized the information drought
and said it may even be hurting the governments' efforts to find
acquirers for failed thrifts.
   ``It makes it more difficult to induce people to come to the
table to do deals if they don't have timely information. ... If
you're going to buy an institution, you need to know how it
compares to the rest of the industry,'' he said.
   The thrift office also reported that S&amp;Ls wrote $23.7 billion in
new mortgages during January and February, down from $29.4 billion
in the same period of 1989.
   Regalia attributed the decline partly to a deliberate pull-back
by S&amp;Ls to meet new financial standards and partly to an anemic
housing market in many areas of the country.
   ``The housing market is really atrocious,'' he said.

   With all the Jim Smiths reserving
rooms for the national Jim Smith Society annual meeting, the
Sheraton Park Place Hotel needed a way to keep track.
   ``We're giving them all numbers. That's how I can keep up with
them all,'' Reservations Manager G'Ann Shannon said Thursday as she
grappled with 39 Jim Smith reservations.
   For example, if you wanted to get to Jim Smith of Dayton, you
asked for Jim Smith No. 2.
   The gathering, which began Friday, is an opportunity for Jim
Smith to talk with Jim Smith about the trials and tribulations of
having one of the most common names in the United States.
   Jim Smith of Dayton remembered all the confusion when he tried
to buy a house.
   ``When I bought my house, I had to sign affidavits saying that I
was not the Jim Smith that was sentenced to 15 to 20 years in
prison. And that I wasn't the Jim Smith that's been dead for 10
years,'' he said. ``Things like that have really been a nuisance.''
   Jim Smith of Braintree, Mass., said that a Sears store got him
confused with another Jim Smith.
   ``I used to keep getting these bills for baby stuff. And I
didn't have a baby,'' he said.
   The Jim Smith Society, founded in 1969, has 1,533 members
worldwide, including eight females.
   The annual convention includes the Jim Smith golf tournament,
the all-Jim Smith softball game, ``Meet Jim Smith'' mixers and
JIMGO, a version of bingo.
   Jim Smith of Camp Hill, Pa., said he started the organization
because he met so many people with the name and because of all the
teasing he got.

stolen our money,'' Liggett, 67, said as he stood beside his
decaying Sedan de Ville in front of the house Friday. ``The
humiliation doesn't bother me. All I want is justice.''
   The bank denied all allegations made by the Liggetts.
   The five-story townhouse is just off exclusive Sutton Place,
where the Liggetts say they have lived for 14 years. The
tree-shaded street is just large enough for cars to park in front
of the tony townhouses that overlook the East River.
   They claim that Bank Leumi Trust Co. took possession of their
home Wednesday, changed the locks and installed round-the-clock
guards, forcing the Liggetts and their poodle, Ferrari, into the
Cadillac.
   Two guards at the house Friday acknowledged the 24-hour presence.
   Taped to a front window is a November 1989 order from state
judge Burton S. Sherman giving Bank Leumi the property and ordering
the Liggetts out.
   The bank has since bought the house for $50,000 at an
unadvertised auction where it was the sole bidder _ all illegal,
according to the Liggetts.
   Bank President Richard Kane said, ``Every single allegation they
are making now they have made in a series of courts over the last
six years. Every time, they have been thrown out. There continues
to be no substance to the claims they make.''
   The couple's older son, John, said Liggett made his money from
plastics patents used by a company he founded in the late 1950s and
then sold for millions of dollars in the late 1970s.
   The couple once had Manhattan and Westhampton condominiums and
traveled abroad on the Concorde. Next to the Cadillac is a
non-working Mercedes, also from 1977.
   The couple claims they now have no money because they have been
defending themselves for years against what they say are the bank's
fraudulent claims.
   They said the bank claims it is owed more than $1 million
because they did not repay a $327,000 business loan from 1979. Mrs.
Liggett said they never got the loan money and, on top of that, she
deposited $327,000 in certificates of deposit as collateral, which
the bank has taken.
   They also claim that the bank continuously removed money _ up to
$3.6 million _ from their accounts without their permission.
   ``They locked me out of my house. The only thing I got out of my
house is what I have on. All the records I need to fight them are
in the house,'' Liggett said.
   ``I feel very angry, very hurt, very upset,'' said Mrs. Liggett,
who is French and, according to her husband, ``50-something.''
   The Liggetts said they could stay somewhere else but they wanted
the publicity from living in the Cadillac so they could get a good
lawyer.
   ``We have a good case against the bank,'' Mrs. Liggett said.
``Any attorney who works for us would be rewarded handsomely.''
   Her husband concurred.
   ``They blew us away,'' he said. ``Now we will blow them away.''

<HEAD>Mass Grave of Policemen Found in Sri Lanka</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government troops unearthed the bodies
of 110 policemen in a mass grave in eastern Sri Lanka, a Defense
Ministry statement said Friday.
   The policemen had surrendered to Tamil Tiger rebels last month
after the guerrillas rejected a 13-month-long cease-fire with
government forces. The bodies had been shot a single time in the
head, the statement said.
   Also Friday, 45 policemen escaped from rebel captivity after
killing three guerrillas, police said.
   At least 830 policemen were captured by the rebels soon after
fighting resumed in northern and eastern Sri Lanka on June 11. Many
of the captives have been killed, the government says.
   A senior police official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said 45 policemen reached government lines in Polonnaruwa, a town
103 miles northeast of Colombo, after escaping rebel captivity.
   They were being held at a Tamil-dominated village 42 miles
southwest of Polonnoruwa, the officer said.
   At least 2,600 combatants have been killed since the fighting
began. Many civilians also have died.
   Meanwhile, in India, the government of the southern state of
Tamil Nadu organized a daylong strike Friday to protest the
killings of Tamils.
   United News of India said the strike was total and peaceful. All
state government offices and schools were closed and there was no
traffic on the streets.
   Tamil Nadu, separated from northern Sri Lanka by a narrow strip
of sea, is home to India's 50 million Tamils, many of whom
sympathize with the rebels in Sri Lanka.
   A Sri Lankan parliamentary delegation is in New Delhi to express
concerns the rebels are using bases in Tamil Nadu.
   Sri Lankan Industries Minister Ranil Wickramasinghe, who is on
the delegation, told reporters Indian government officials had
promised to ensure that no sanctuary was given to the guerrillas.
   The fighting in SriLanka is the latest phase of the 7-year-old
war for an independent Tamil homeland in the island nation's north
and east. Tamil militants accuse the majority Sinhalese community
of discrimination in jobs, education and language.
   The insurgency has killed at least 13,600 people.
   Tamils make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people and
Sinhalese, who dominate the government and armed forces, comprise
75 percent.

<HEAD>Proposed Uniform Libel Law for States Criticized for Alleged Bias</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANTHONY SHADID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A proposed uniform libel law under which courts
would decide whether statements are true or false before
determining appropriate damages would not guarantee First Amendment
rights for defendants, critics say.
   The Uniform Defamation Act is the first proposal for a
nationwide standard in libel disputes. It was discussed Friday by
the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws _ a
group appointed by the nation's governors to draft model
legislation.
   The 28-page draft outlines a two-stage procedure for libel
trials. A court would first determine whether a statement under
question is true or false. Only later _ during the trial's second
stage _ would a court decide what, if any, damages to assess.
   Safeguards for the press _ protection if a reporter acted
without malice or allowances made if a plaintiff is a public
official _ would not apply in the trial's first stage.
   ``The substantive question is whether constitutional privileges
can be delayed until the truth is determined,'' said the draft's
author, Harvey Perlman, dean of the University of Nebraska's
College of Law.
   The committee said the draft was based on the premise that
plaintiffs are more interested in clearing their names than in
receiving damages.
   Perlman said the proposed law's intent was to protect
plaintiffs' reputations better, but it also would benefits news
organizations.
   Under the proposal, news organizations could print retractions
or pay a plaintiff's legal fees after the first stage _ a provision
proponents say would shorten trials and reduce the amount of
damages awarded.
   ``We wanted to create some incentives for the plaintiff to stop
early,'' Perlman said.
   But critics argue the committee's desire to design safeguards
for a person's reputation would create a ``chilling effect'' on the
First Amendment.
   ``One of our central concerns is the committee's desire to move
the law in favor of the plaintiff,'' said Henry R. Kaufman, counsel
for the Libel Defense Resource Center. ``There will be a chilling
effect if the media believes it is going to face higher costs and
greater burdens of libel and litigation.''
   Others at the annual conference questioned creating one standard
for an intricate field of First Amendment law and court decisions.
   ``I don't feel it's an area of the law where you can provide a
uniform act,'' said delegate John McClaugherty, a lawyer from
Charleston, W.Va. ``The First Amendment is constantly being
reinterpreted and by the time a law was passed it would already be
out of date.''
   Some delegates said they feared legislators with a grudge
against the press would attempt to draft legislation unfavorable to
the media.
   But Perlman said the criticism did not worry him.
   ``Traditionally, it is the people that have concerns that stand
up,'' he said. ``But I would be naive not to think there is
substantial concern about it.''
   The earliest a proposal would be redrafted and returned to the
350-member conference would be next year, he said, but no date was
set for a vote.

<HEAD>INS Resumes Denial of Asylum to Nicaraguans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Immigration authorities have resumed issuing
letters of denial to Nicaraguans seeking asylum in the United
States, after a five-month suspension, a spokesman said Friday.
   In coming months, letters will go out to some 12,000 Nicaraguans
whose requests for asylum have been rejected, said Duke Austin, a
spokesman for the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
   The INS stopped sending the letters last February to see whether
Nicaragua's Sandinista government would fulfill its pledge to hold
free elections, Austin said.
   The INS also wanted to evaluate the performance of the new
government elected to replace the Marxist Sandinistas, he said.
   Having satisfied themselves that the U.S.-backed government of
Violetta Chamorro has asserted control over the country and
resisted several challenges by the Sandinistas, U.S. authorities
decided to resume sending the denial letters on July 1.
   ``This does not mean that these people are in imminent danger of
being sent home involuntarily,'' Austin said.
   Applicants denied asylum have recourse through a lengthy appeals
process, which often takes several years.
   Another estimated 25,000 asylum requests from Nicaraguans are
still pending.
   Privately, immigration officials concede a successful switch to
democracy in Nicaragua may sharply curtail U.S. granting of asylum.
In addition, improved conditions may lessen the number of
applicants.
   But Robert Boyer, an immigration attorney in Miami who
specializes in Nicaraguan cases, said he's been flooded with calls
from worried Nicaraguan refugees who have received notices from the
INS.
   ``To wait only three months with the new situation in Nicaragua
and decide that things are stable enough to move ahead on this now
is really imprudent,'' he said.
   In fiscal year 1989, the INS granted just under 6,000 requests
from Nicaraguans for asylum, denying more than 10,000. Between
October 1989 and January of this year, about 500 were granted and
650 denied.
   The United States provides asylum to people who can prove they
will face persecution if they are sent back home. Most denials
occur because analysts rule applicants are economic, rather than
political, refugees.
   INS officials predict 65,000 foreigners will ask for asylum this
year, most of them from Latin America. The INS announced this week
it was improving its system for examining such requests by forming
a corps of 70-90 examiners who will deal only with asylum and be
versed in international affairs.

<HEAD>Wreckage of Stolen Plane Found Near Syria, Ending Long Search</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Searchers found the wreckage of a missing Air
Force plane near the Syrian border Friday, along with the body of
the reservist pilot who stole the craft, the army said.
   The discovery ended the largest air, land and sea search in
Israel's history, launched a week ago following the first theft of
an Israeli air force plane.
   The plane was stolen from an air base in central Israel by a
33-year-old reservist pilot, Hagai Morry, who made an unauthorized
takeoff shortly before he was scheduled to fly on a routine mission.
   A military communique said Morry's body was found near the
remains of the plane on the western slopes of the Golan Heights,
which were annexed from Syria after being captured in the 1967
Middle East war.
   The theft had fueled speculation that Morry, a captain in the
reserves, might have defected to a neighboring Arab country.
   But Maj. Gen. Avihu Bin Nun, the air force commander, told
reporters Friday he believed Morry intended to commit suicide by
crashing his plane.
   The aircraft was a West-German made twin-engine Dornier-28, a
common reconnaissance plane.
   Officials said earlier they believed Morry had personal
problems. Newspapers said he had been having marital problems and
was was not living with his wife.
   Morry, who was studying for a doctorate in physics, reportedly
flew over most of the country before disappearing. He buzzed his
home in the northern city of Haifa and was last seen flying north
toward the Lebanon border, newspapers said.

<TEXT>
   A low-fat vegetarian diet, clean living and stress
management can reverse heart disease in many patients in as little
as a year, according to a study published in this week's edition of
The Lancet.
   Dr. Dean Ornish of the Preventive Medicine Research Institute of
Sausalito, Calif., who coordinated ``The Lifestyle Heart Trial,''
said it is the first evidence that heart disease can be reversed
without surgery or drugs.
   ``Comprehensive lifestyle changes may be able to bring about
regression of even severe coronary atherosclerosis after only one
year,'' the study said.
   Researchers stressed that ``adherence to this lifestyle program
needs to be very good for overall regression to occur, although
more moderate changes have some beneficial effects.''
   The study noted only two other controlled studies had shown
regression of coronary atherosclerosis and both used
cholesterol-lowering drugs as the main treatment.
   The 10 researchers participating in the study cautioned that
important questions remained unanswered.
   The study involved only 41 patients and the researchers said it
was important to determine whether these results can be sustained
in large numbers of patients with coronary heart disease.
   Further research is also needed to determine the relative
contribution of each component of the lifestyle program, the
researchers said.
   Scientists should also study just how the disease regresses and
compare the results of changing lifestyles vs. using drugs or
surgery, they said.
   The study said 41 patients from the San Francisco area, aged
35-75, were randomly assigned to an experimental group and a
control group.
   The 22 patients in the experimental group ate a low-fat,
vegetarian diet. Smoking and caffeine were banned and alcohol was
limited to two drinks a day, although drinking was not encouraged.
   They exercised regularly and attended stress management training
classes.
   Eighteen of the 22 patients showed a reversal of coronary artery
blockages; three showed slight deterioriation, and one patient with
``poor adherence'' to the diet became markedly worse, the study
reported.
   The 19 control group patients stuck to a program generally
recommended for heart disease patients. They ate a diet of 30
percent fat, did not smoke and had moderate exercise.
   Ten of the 19 patients in the control group experienced
worsening of their coronary artery blockages. Eight improved. One
showed no change.
   ``This finding suggests that conventional recommendations don't
go far enough for many people,'' Ornish said in an interview. ``The
guidelines may be enough to prevent heart disease but not to
reverse it.''
   ``The amount of chest pain improved within a week or two and
there was a 91 percent reduction in chest pain. When you feel that
much better you are willing to make the changes. The healthier
lifestyle becomes self-reinforcing.''
   By contrast, the study found the control group patients
experienced a 165 percent rise in the frequency of chest pains.
   Ornish said the study turned up two unexpected findings.
   ``We found that women didn't have to change their lifestyle
completely to see a change,'' Ornish said. ``Men may have to do
more.''
   Four of the eight patients in the low-fat control group who
improved were women, he said, while 17 of the 18 in the
experimental group who improved were men.
   But he added that with only five women participating in the
study additional research on a possible gender variable was needed.
   Ornish said researchers were also surprised to find that the
more severe artery blockages showed the most improvement.
   ``Though the finding was unexpected, they (severe blockages) are
the most dangerous,'' he said.
   Ornish said follow-up testing will continue for four years to
see whether blockages continue to reverse.
   The study was funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood
Institute of the National Institutes of Health and more than 16
other organizations and foundations.

<TEXT>
   Interest on fixed-rate home mortgages dipped
below 10 percent this week for the first time in six months,
raising hopes that the sluggish real estate market may pick up
slightly as a result.
   The fixed rate for 30-year mortgages averaged 9.99 percent this
week, down from 10.11 percent last week, said the Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corp. The corporation is a congressionally-chartered but
shareholder-owned company indirectly financing about one in eight
American home purchases.
   It was the lowest since fixed-rate mortgages averaged 9.90
percent during the week ending Jan. 19.
   One-year adjustable-rate mortgages fell from 8.45 percent to
8.39 percent, also the lowest since Jan. 19, when the average was
an identical 8.39 percent.
   The rates, which do not include add-on fees known as points, hit
a high in May for the year so far of 10.67 percent for fixed-rate
loans and 8.63 percent for adjustable loans.
   ``It's always encouraging to see rates decline a little bit,
particularly to drop below the double-digit level,'' said economist
Thomas Holloway of the Mortgage Bankers Association of America.
``The housing market certainly needs a shot in the arm.''
   Sales of existing homes, as tracked by the National Association
of Realtors, have declined in four of the first five months of the
year to an annual rate of 3.29 million units in May.
   New home sales, meanwhile, rose in May for the first time in six
months to an annual rate of 532,000 units, but were still depressed
to levels not seen since the 1982 recession.
   Holloway said his trade group was forecasting continued
sluggishness in housing markets and saw little prospect for further
interest rate declines.
   ``Right now there is a huge inventory of homes available for
sale. The economy is not collapsing but it's not going gang busters
either,'' he said. ``This (recent) small move in rates is not
likely to do that much.''

   A bipartisan group of senators pressed the
Bush administration Friday to make more changes in its Cambodia
policy, including lifting a trade embargo and opening direct talks
with the communist government.
   Lawmakers at a Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee hearing
said administration moves to rescind recognition for a three-party
rebel coalition fighting the Cambodian government won't slow a
resurgence by the Khmer Rouge rebels.
   ``The Khmer Rouge ... remain the primary beneficiaries of our
policy,'' said Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass.
   An economic embargo imposed in 1975, when the Khmer Rouge were
in power, is weakening the government that replaced that regime,
Kerry said.
   The Khmer Rouge ruled Cambodia from 1975 to 1979, undertaking a
massive social experiment that forcibly scattered city dwellers
through the countryside and resulted in the deaths of more than a
million countrymen from execution, starvation and disease.
   ``It is time to rethink our policy,'' said Sen. Frank Murkowski,
R-Alaska. ``It is necessary to go further.''
   Murkowski, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said
the administration's policy changes have left a contradiction:
opposition to a Khmer Rouge return to power but support for their
participation in elections.
   He called for the United States instead to work with other
governments to forge a coalition between the Phnom Penh government
of Hun Sen and the U.S.-supported non-communist resistance
factions, isolating the Khmer Rouge.
   The United States provides about $20 million a year through
covert and open channels to the two non-communist groups fighting
the Hun Sen government in a loose alliance with the Khmer Rouge.
   Murkowski said aid should be continued to keep alive a
non-communist alternative that Cambodians could vote for in an
election. But he said all U.S. aid should be given openly and
should be primarily non-military.
   Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., said military aid should end, with
U.S. dollars channeled into support for building a democratic
political opposition.
   He spending $64,000 to set up a training facility for 200 boys
ages 12 to 16 at a resistance base camp was a misue of U.S. aid.
   The policy of supporting the rebel coalition is ``courting
disaster,'' said Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb. ``The potential for a
tragic outcome is great.''
   The Bush administration's intention to open talks with the
Vietnamese government will only worsen matters, Kerrey said. Citing
the intense hatred between Vietnamese and Cambodians, he said U.S.
talks with Hanoi will only fan the nationalistic fervor that is the
basis of the Khmer Rouge political appeal.
   The Khmer Rouge will be able to point to the talks and tell
peasants: ``Look! The American imperialists and the Vietnamese are
trying to take over your country,'' said Kerrey, a Vietnam veteran
who visited Cambodia earlier this year. ``It is very risky.''
   Cranston said 50 senators so far have signed a letter circulated
by Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, calling on
President Bush to make stopping the Khmer Rouge the primary aim of
U.S. policy.
   Fearing a comeback by the communist guerrillas, the
administration said Wednesday it was withdrawing support for a
United Nations seat for the three-party resistance that includes
the Khmer Rouge, the Sihanouk forces and the faction of former
Cambodian Prime Minister Son Sann.

<HEAD>Soviet Borders Tightened Because of Shelf-Stripping</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN FRIEDMAN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union is tightening its border controls
because of smuggling and profiteering that has stripped store
shelves in the western part of the country, Premier Nikolai I.
Ryzhkov announced Friday.
   Also Friday, Mikhail S. Gorbachev's top advisers huddled in the
Kremlin to outline long-delayed reforms for salvaging the Soviet
economy. Gorbachev said his concept for a union of sovereign
republics and the transfer to a market economy are linked.
   In a nationally televised address, Ryzhkov said the border
restrictions, which were relaxed in September 1988, are being
tightened temporarily because of the ``abnormal'' situation on the
western Soviet border. He did not elaborate on what the tighter
restrictions would entail.
   Ryzhkov said Soviets and residents of unspecified neighboring
countries were taking advantage of the considerably cheaper-priced
Soviet consumer goods and engaging in smuggling and rampant
black-marketeering.
   He said the situation has the potential to become uncontrollable.
   Ryzhkov said he signed a decision Thursday to repeal the
simplified rules for crossing the Soviet border until such time as
border and customs services can ensure normal relations with
neighboring nations.
   The simplified rules loosened restrictions on residents of
border areas to cross the frontier and export goods. Recently,
however, customs officials have been rigorously searching vehicles
to look for goods being taken out of the Soviet Union.
   On Thursday, the Polish government said it was seeking the
lifting of travel restrictions imposed on foreign visitors to the
western Ukrainian city of Lvov, where authorities have barred
tourists' cars and said scarce goods will be confiscated if
foreigners try to take them away.
   In recent months, Poles have gained a reputation as voracious
traders, buying up state-subsidized goods in the Soviet Union such
as televisions, jewelry, caviar and gasoline.
   But many Soviets have gone West as well, buying clothes and
other consumer goods not easily available in their country.
   At the Kremlin meeting of the Presidential Council and the
Federation Council, Gorbachev's top two advisory groups, Ryzhkov
outlined his government's plan for the transfer to a market economy
beginning in 1991, the Tass news agency reported.
   The official news agency said the plan includes freedom of
economic activities and enterprise, developing a system of
protecting citizens from increasing prices and unemployment,
decentralizing property and establishing anti-monopoly measures. No
specifics were given.
   An economic program presented by Ryzhkov in May caused panic
buying that made empty store shelves even barer. A new version of
the plan was ordered, with the first phase of food price increases
put off until 1991.
   Ryzhkov's new plan outlined Friday is to be presented to the
Soviet parliament when it reconvenes in September.
   Gorbachev stressed that the transfer to a market economy and the
drawing up of a new union treaty involving the 15 Soviet republics
were ``two sides of the same coin,'' according to Tass.
   The treaty, which would ensure increased autonomy of the
republics, would also create a single market-oriented system in
which all component parts will complement each other, Tass quoted
Gorbachev as saying.
   Separatist trends only make even more complicated the situation
both in the republics and the nation in general, Gorbachev said,
according to the news agency.
   To keep the Soviet Union from splintering, Gorbachev in June
proposed the 15 republics agree on a new, looser union of
``sovereign states.''
   Since Gorbachev began his reforms in 1985, many Soviet republics
have sought to exercise more and more independence from Moscow.
   The Baltic republics of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia have made
outright moves toward independence. The Russian federation, the
Ukraine, Moldavia and Uzbekistan have declared their sovereignty,

   The State Department on Friday announced it
had invited Israel's new foreign minister, David Levy, to talk
about moving forward the stalled peace process between Israel and
its Palestinian neighbors.
   The Defense Department, meanwhile, informed Israel that the
United States would contribute to the second phase of the Arrow, an
anti-missile missile being developed in Israel in cooperation with
the U.S. Star Wars program.
   Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Arens said he was informed of the
decision at a meeting with Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney.
   Israeli officials said Arens and Cheney did not discuss the
amount of the U.S. participation in the $240 million second phase,
but Israel was pleased by the U.S. commitment to support the
project.
   The Arens-Cheney meeting came as the administration tried to
defuse speculation that its decision this week to postpone
defense-cooperation talks with Israel was an attempt to wrest
concessions in the peace process.
   ``The postponement was an agreement between the United States
government and the Israeli government,'' said State Department
spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler. The annual talks will take place in
September, instead, she said.
   The administration is busy negotiating future budgets with
Congress and is uncertain about how much money it will have
available for foreign aid in fiscal year 1992, Tutwiler said.
   The administration has already asked Congress for $3 billion in
fiscal 1991 for Israel, which is the largest recipient of U.S. aid.
   ``The postponement is purely a practical matter. United
States-Israeli relations remain strong. Our commitment to Israel's
security and to the preservation of its qualitative edge remains
unshakeable,'' Tutwiler said.
   Israeli officials also insisted Arens' brief visit, which was
only announced Thursday, was unrelated to the postponement of the
annual talks on the Joint Security Assistance Program.
   Nonetheless, the postponement caught Israeli officials by
surprise and created unease in light of several expressions of
impatience from Secretary of State James A. Baker III about what he
described as Israeli foot dragging on the peace process.
   Baker's talks with Levy, who came into office when a government
of the hard line Likud bloc was sworn in last month, will take
place on Aug. 9 or 10, Tutwiler said.
   A U.S. official said Levy was still weak from surgery he
underwent for a circulatory ailment and may break the talks with
Baker into two sessions, one each day.
   Levy and Baker were supposed to meet last week in Paris but Levy
was advised by his doctors to stay home.
   Last March, Israel rejected a formula devised by Baker for talks
that would lead to elections among the 1.7 million Palestinians in
the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. An internal Israeli
dispute over the Baker plan led to the government's collapse.
   Baker, determined to try again, met here last month with
Egyptian and Jordanian officials and also urged the new Israeli
government _ in public and private _ to accept his plan.
   ``Secretary Baker wants to work with the new government of
Israel to create a common and credible basis on which to move on
the peace process,'' Tutwiler said.

<HEAD>Home Prices Fall In Washington, D.C., Metro Area</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The median price of single family homes in the
Washington, D.C., metropolitan area dropped 5 percent between April
1989 and April 1990, the first decline in the past decade.
   The median sale price of homes in the area dropped from $202,239
a year ago to $191,985, according to real estate transaction
records compiled by Silver Spring, Md.,-based Rufus K. Lusk &amp; Son.
   Rufus K. Lusk Sr., president of the company, said the decline
was indicative of a readjustment in a real estate market that has
become both unbalanced an overly expensive.
   He said home prices in the Washington area have risen so quickly
in recent years they simply have outstripped people's incomes in
many cases, he said.
   The median price _ the midpoint figure at which half the homes
sold for more and half sold for less _ was considered statistically
more significant than the average price, Lusk said.
   He said the average could easily skewered by a relatively few
transactions, such as the sales of large estates.
   The survey found that the decline was most extreme in the
District of Columbia, where median costs for single family homes
dropped 9 percent, from $201,192 to $183,451.
   In Fairfax County, Va., home prices dropped 6 percent to a
median price of $215,934; Montgomery County, Md., declined 3
percent to $216,446; and Alexandria, Va., prices fell 3 percent to
a median cost of $203,960.

<TEXT>
   Federal engineers are upgrading an
investigation of fires in 77,000 truck and bus engines manufactured
by Ford Motor Co., the government said Friday.
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said it had
reclassified the probe from a preliminary evaluation, which
involves mostly paperwork, to an engineering analysis, in which the
possibly defective parts will be studied.
   The investigation could lead to a recall.
   Consumers have reported 130 fires in trucks and buses with the
Ford engine, including 12 on school buses, agency spokesman Tim
Hurd said. No injuries have been reported.
   Ford spokeswoman Lynn Tuttle said, ``As has always been our
policy, Ford Motor Co. will cooperate fully with these
investigations.''
   In its monthly auto defects report, the agency said it also had
upgraded to engineering analysis status the investigations of:
   _Reports that safety belt retractor malfunctions in about
100,000 Chevrolet Corvettes from the 1985 through 1987 model years.
There have been 58 complaints. Consumers have blamed the problem
for five injuries and one death, Hurd said.
   _Hood latch failures in 22,554 Ford Thunderbirds and Mercury
Cougars from the 1989 and 1990 model years. There have been seven
complaints of hoods flying open because of latch failures.
   The government also said it had opened preliminary evaluations
of:
   _Oil seal failures in Isuzu Troopers with turbo-charged diesel
engines from the 1986 through 1990 model years. There have been
three complaints of oil being sucked into the combustion chamber,
causing the engines to surge. About 3,000 of the vehicles are on
the road.
   _Brake lamp switch failure in General Motors ``W'' cars, which
include the Oldsmobile Cutlass, the Buick Regal, the Pontiac Grand
Prix and the Chevrolet Lumina. About 763,000 of the cars are on the
road.
   There have been 12 complaints of brake lamps failing and failure
of the cruise control to disengage when the brake pedal is applied.
The same switch controls both functions.
   _Safety belt failure in Ford Mustangs from the 1984 and 1985
model years. About 274,000 of the cars are on the road.
   The agency discontinued an engineering analysis of seat belt
retractor failure in the 1985 Subaru station wagon, finding no
problem that posed an ``unreasonable risk.'' The same reason was
given for halting a preliminary evaluation of spare tire carrier
failure in 1982-89 GM Astros and Safaris.
   Preliminary evaluations discontinued because there was no
evidence of a widespread safety problem included probes of:
   _Seat floor mounting failure in 1986-89 Mustangs.
   _Speed control failure in the 1990 Lumina.
   _Windshield wiper failure in the 1985-90 Isuzu Trooper, PU and
Amigo.
   _Brake disc hub failure in 1986-89 Ford Taurus and Mercury Sable.

<HEAD>194 Kosovo Radio-TV Employees Fired by Serbian Authorities</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Serbian authorities on Friday fired
194 ethnic Albanian employees of the radio and television company
in Kosovo, the troubled province that has been a hotbed of ethnic
violence.
   Yugoslavia's official Tanjug news agency said that the workers,
mostly journalists, were dismissed for ``abandoning their jobs''
after Serbian police on July 5 took over broadcasting facilities in
Pristina, Kosovo's capital.
   The police takeover followed Serbia's decision to dissolve the
the troubled province's assembly and government. Both dismantled
bodies were dominated by ethnic Albanians, who make up 90 percent
of the province's 1.9 million people.
   Kosovo administratively is part of Serbia, but had been largely
autonomous.
   Serbian authorities, explaining the crackdown, claim that ethnic
Albanians are seeking independence from Yugoslavia, and that they
want Kosovo to join neighboring Albania.
   Kosovo Albanians deny those claims. They say Serbia's hard-line
Communist leader Slobodan Milosevic has used the issue, a highly
emotional one for Serbs who consider Kosovo the ancient heartland
of their culture, to gain popular support for his hard-line
policies.
   At least 60 ethnic Albanian protesters have died in clashes with
Serbian-led security forces in Kosovo since March 1989 when
Serbia's authorities first introduced strict limits on the
province's self-administration.

<HEAD>Atlantis' Bolts Tightened To Fix Leak; New Mishap on Discovery</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCIA DUNN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Aerospace Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NASA workers tightened most of the
48 bolts on one of space shuttle Atlantis' fuel lines Friday, but
the space agency won't know whether that fixed a hydrogen leak
until a tanking test next week.
   The shuttle's classified Defense Department mission is on hold
until the problem is resolved.
   All the bolts checked out fine, said NASA spokeswoman Lisa
Malone. ``Everything looked normal,'' she said.
   Discovery, meanwhile, has joined the other two shuttles with
problems.
   One of 14 thrusters on Discovery's right orbital maneuvering
system pad was dented when it fell off a work stand Thursday. A new
$600,000 thruster, which weighs 20 pounds and is about the size of
a football, will be installed.
   The accident occurred during routine maintenance work, Malone
said.
   ``They're looking into how the whole thing happened,'' she said.
   The replacement of the thruster will not jeopardize Discovery's
scheduled launch with the sun-probing Ulysses satellite in October,
Malone said. The damaged thruster was being returned to the
manufacturer for repairs.
   NASA officials believe that on Atlantis, hydrogen is escaping
from a flange on the external tank side of a 17-inch-diameter
valve. The valve is in a pipe that carries fuel from the tank to
the main engines.
   Before tightening the bolts around the flange, workers made mold
impressions to check the distance between each one and to measure
the flatness of the bolts' heads. Everything appeared within
specifications, Malone said.
   Technicians over-torqued 38 of the 48 bolts by 10 percent,
Malone said. The remaining 10 already were over-torqued and so were
not tightened, she said. The flange welds were to be checked late
Friday and Saturday.
   A pressurized helium test on the massive tank Thursday showed no
evidence of any leaks, said Malone. The leaks were detected in late
June and again last week when supercold liquid hydrogen was pumped
into the tank. Earlier tests with room-temperature helium had
failed to uncover any problems.
   NASA plans to launch Atlantis in mid-August if the shuttle
passes a third tanking test with liquid hydrogen on Wednesday.
Officials are doubtful, however, that the problem will be resolved
by simply tightening bolts at the launch pad.
   If hydrogen continues to escape from Atlantis, the shuttle will
be returned to the hangar for repairs. If a new tank is attached to
Atlantis, the shuttle could be rolled back out for a mid-September
launch, said launch director Bob Sieck. The other alternative is to
move Columbia back out to the pad for an early September liftoff
with the Astro observatory.
   On shuttle Columbia, a hydrogen leak was detected during fueling
for a May 30 launch attempt. The shuttle was returned to the hangar
and received a 17-inch-diameter valve taken from the new shuttle
Endeavour, under construction in California.
   Representatives of the company that makes the valves, Parker
Hannifin, were inspecting the newly installed device Friday. The
leaky component is undergoing laboratory tests in California by
shuttle builder Rockwell International.
   Columbia's leak is believed to be in a small shaft seal on the
orbiter side of the valve.

   The following are excerpts from the House
ethics committee's report on its investigation into Rep. Barney
Frank, D-Mass., and his relationship with male prostitute Stephen
Gobie.
   
   Both (Gobie and Frank) agreed that there was a dimension to
their relationship that transcended employment. Mr. Gobie spoke of
his personal admiration for Representative Frank, and
Representative Frank said that Mr. Gobie was good for his ego, and
that the relationship was not entirely arms length.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Frank was not totally candid and forthcoming (in a 1986 memo to
an Alexandria, Va., prosecutor) in describing either the nature of,
or the events giving rise to, his relationship with Stephen L.
Gobie; as well as Mr. Gobie's activities during probation. It is of
critical importance that such issues were directly relevant to any
consideration of whether Mr. Gobie's probation should have been
extended. ... The misleading statements could be perceived as an
attempt to use political influence to affect the administration of
Mr. Gobie's probation. That the memorandum had apparently had no
such effect does not detract from the inappropriateness of
communicating misleading statements which could have affected the
administration of Mr. Gobie's probation.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Frank either sought or received the administrative dismissal of
33 parking tickets for which Representative Frank himself instructs
that there was no adequate basis indicating his automobile was
being used for official purposes. The committee further concludes
that Representative Frank should take steps to negate fully any
such financial benefit.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   (On Gobie's testimony that he and Frank had sex in the House
gym, Frank testified:) ``The whole notion, the way they were
describing it, out in the locker room, which is where the doors
open from the swimming pool, that is the craziest notion. I will
agree that I behaved in ways that were inappropriate and stupid,
for which I feel very badly... But I never had sex in the gym with
Mr. Gobie or anyone else.''
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   In numerous instances where an assertion made by Mr. Gobie ...
was investigated for accuracy, the assertion was contradicted by
third-party sworn testimony or other evidence of Mr. Gobie himself.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   (The committee discounted as inconclusive testimony from a
female prostitute who) stated that because she believed the
individual with whom she spoke on the telephone was Representative
Frank _ because she ``recognized the voice... maybe slightly a lisp
and a northern accent,'' _ and based upon the conversation
described above, she personally concluded that the congressman knew
that his apartment was being used by Mr. Gobie for business
purposes.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The committee has taken into consideration the fact that during
his Dec. 11, 1989, interview, the congressman clearly and
unambiguously expressed regret for his actions and accepted full
responsibility for any parking tickets that were dismissed
regardless of whether he initiated such administrative action.

<HEAD>GAO Report Doubts PUREX Should Ever Be Restarted</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT SONNER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Energy Department has failed to prove that
its plutonium processing plant near Richland, Wash. can be operated
safely or that it should even be restarted, congressional
investigators said Friday.
   The department has failed to show that the plant on the Hanford
nuclear reservation is needed to produce plutonium or to help
manage radioactive wastes, said the report by the General
Accounting Office.
   The plant is called the PUREX plant, short for plutonium
extraction. It uses chemical methods to separate plutonium for
nuclear weapons produced by the irradiation of uranium nuclear
reactor fuel rods. It has been shut to improve safety since
December 1988.
   ``DOE has not demonstrated that a need exists for the remaining
weapons-grade plutonium that could be extracted, and it has not
fully compared PUREX with other waste processing alternatives to
determine whether PUREX is the best approach,'' the GAO said.
   ``DOE's plans for restarting PUREX are inadequate,'' said the
report requested nearly a year ago by Rep. Mike Synar, D-Okla.,
chairman of the House Government Operations subcommittee on
environment, energy and natural resources.
   ``A more important question is whether PUREX should be restarted
at all given the costs to operate PUREX, in combination with the
costs to prepare a supplemental environmental statement, the time
and costs associated with correcting identified safety and training
deficiencies,'' the fact that most plutonium for new weapons will
come from old weapons being retired and scrap on hand at weapons
plants and ``the possibility that a better alternative exists to
dispose of the fuel-grade plutonium'' in the unprocessed fuel rods
at Hanford.
   ``If a decision is made to continue with plans to restart PUREX,
we believe that a supplemental environmental impact statement
should be prepared prior to restart of the plant,'' the GAO said.
   A spokesman for the Energy Department said Watkins had not seen
the GAO report and would have no immediate comment. However,
spokesman Tim Tomastik said the report ``makes the assumption that
DOE has made a decision about restarting PUREX. The DOE has not
made a decision at this time with respect to whether or not to
restart PUREX.''
   Synar said Friday his subcommittee estimates that putting the
plant in mothballs would save the government more than $750 million
over the next 15 years.

<HEAD>Report: Durenberger Should Be Denounced Despite Impaired Judgment</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Dave Durenberger should be denounced for
abusing his office and misusing public funds even though
``emotional and traumatic events'' impaired his judgment, a report
released Friday recommended.
   The Senate Ethics Committee's report explained the panel's
recommendation, announced Wednesday, that the Minnesota Republican
be denounced on the Senate floor by a vote of his colleagues.
   The committee found that Durenberger knowingly violated Senate
rules and federal statutes in a book deal, in transactions
involving the Minneapolis condominium he partly owned, by failing
to report expense reimbursements and by accepting free limousine
rides in violation of gift limits.
   The six-member panel also recommended that Durenberger make
restitution of up to $122,780 _ $29,050 to the Senate for improper
reimbursements for his condominium; and $93,730 to charity, less
state and federal taxes already paid _ for exceeding limits on
speaking fees. The charity figure is about $1,000 less than the
amount announced Wednesday.
   Durenberger has admitted violating Senate rules, but said he
never intend to do so. He contended also that he always followed
the advice of his personal lawyers.
   The 12-year veteran senator also said his judgment was
influenced by tragedies in his life: the death of his first wife,
and the killing in Vietnam of his current wife's first husband.
   ``The committee finds that Sen. Durenberger did encounter severe
emotional strain from events in his personal life,'' the report
said.
   It found that the ``severe emotional and traumatic events ...
impaired his judgment. The committee finds that these factors do
not excuse the senator's conduct.''
   The report said Durenberger generated $248,300 in speaking fees
that he classified as promotions for his two books _ but the
appearances actually were normal honoraria speeches subject to
income limits.
   Durenberger, during a great many of these speeches ``did not
mention'' the books he supposedly was promoting. When he did
mention them, ``his only reference was extremely brief or was
belittling of the book's contents,'' the committee found.
   While Durenberger contended the Federal Election Commission
approved his book promotion speeches, the committee concluded the
senator misled the agency.
   Durenberger did not tell the FEC he would be making book
promotion speeches that were strikingly similar to honoraria
appearances subject to earnings limits; and he did not say that his
promotion appearances would result from invitations to deliver
traditional honoraria speeches.
   The committee found that Durenberger placed his Minneapolis
condominium in a partnership ``as a means of permitting'' him to
claim Senate reimbursements.
   Durenberger took his name out of the partnership and ``as a
result, the senator's ownership interest ... was concealed from the
Senate ...,'' according to the report.
   When his lawyer cautioned Durenberger that he could not find a
legal basis for the reimbursements under the partnership, the
senator ``failed to take any action'' and only asked the Senate for
advice after news articles surfaced on the condominium in 1989.
   Durenberger also arranged a ``purported'' sale of the residence
in 1987 to a business operated by a personal friend and former
campaign manager.
   The friend admitted that he would not have bought the unit but
for Durenberger's agreement to rent it. This was an arrangement
``which both parties understood would be financed at least in part
through Senate reimbursements,'' the report said.
   Durenberger's attorney, Jim Hamilton, filed a brief with the
committee that called the recommended punishment too strong, and
said a ``strong reprimand'' would be more fair.
   Hamilton called the book deal a ``good-faith venture'' and the
condominium transactions legitimate real estate deals. ``They were
not shams,'' he said.

<HEAD>Cuba Charges Western Plot as More Cubans Enter Spanish Embassy</HEAD>

   Five more Cubans took refuge inside the
Spanish Embassy in Havana on Friday, officials said, and Cuban news
media portrayed the continuing of asylum-seeking in foreign
missions there as a Western plot.
   Nine Cuban refugees now are at Madrid's embassy and four others
are in the residence of the Italian ambassador. Five who spent a
week in a Czechoslovak diplomat's apartment gave up their bid for
asylum earlier after receiving assurances they would not be
prosecuted, according to reports from Havana.
   Diplomats accused Cuban police of violating diplomatic territory
to make arrests, and a bitter dispute developed between Spain and
its former colony after Cuban police seized one refugee on Spanish
Embassy grounds.
   In Washington, Michael Kozak, a deputy assistant secretary of
state, called in a Cuban diplomat on Friday to protest Cuba's
claims that the United States encouraged Cubans to seek asylum in
embassies. The State Department has called such allegations
``outrageous.''
   The official Cuban news agency Prensa Latina said the run on the
embassies is being portrayed in Communist-ruled Cuba as part of a
Western plot to undermine the Communist-ruled Caribbean island
nation and tarnish its international image.
   The official Mexican news agency, Notimex, said the chief of the
U.S. Interests Section in Havana called an emergency meeting Friday
of all Western diplomats.
   Notimex said U.S. and West German officials in Havana denied
Cuban allegations their countries were involved in a plot. The U.S.
statement said Cuban agents tried several times to compromise U.S.
officials in past months.
   Reports from Madrid and Havana, monitored in Mexico City, said
the latest refugees entered the Spanish Embassy Friday morning.
   Two youths jumped an iron fence behind the mission, and shortly
afterward, a couple with a child got through the main entrance, but
another person was arrested by Cuban police, the Foreign Ministry
in Madrid said.
   Spain recalled its ambassador from Havana for consultations,
suspended $2.5 million in grants, and persuaded the European
Community to put three ``symbolic'' aid projects for Cuba on hold
after Cuba castigated Spanish Foreign Minister Francisco Fernandez
Ordonez.
   Fernandez Ordonez suggested the hard-line Communist government
of Fidel Castro would crumble if he allowed Cubans freedom to leave.
   Prensa Latina said state TV boradcast interviews Thursday night
with two Cuban dissidents and three of those who had sought refuge
in the Czechoslovak diplomat's residence. It said they accused
foreign diplomats of plotting the wave of asylum-seeking.

   A fierce storm overturned boats and tossed docks through the air
at a crowded New Hampshire resort lake Friday as thunderstorms
boomed over the East and the Gulf Coast.
   The storm that hit Lake Winnipesaukee also blew down huge trees
and knocked out power there and in Moultonboro, Tuftonboro and
Center Harbor, N.H., but no injuries were reported.
   The storm was part of a system developing along and south of a
stationary front stretching from Indiana to Maine.
   Thunderstorms over western New York state produced high winds
which downed power lines around Port Byron and felled a tree near
the town of Throop.
   Showers and thunderstorms produced locally heavy rain in the
Ohio Valley, and deluged parts of Iowa with 2 to 5 inches of rain.
Mount Ayer, Iowa, reported 5{ inches of rain.
   Flooding was reported along the Chariton River and the Thompson
River in Iowa. The Thompson River was expected to crest at 14 feet,
heavily flooding farmland.
   Showers and thunderstorms also fell over the central Gulf Coast
and the southern Atlantic Coast, and a few scattered showers
dampened the north-central Plains.
   Sunny, dry weather prevailed west of the Rockies.
   In the southern deserts of California, gusty, southeast winds
churned up dust and sand, cutting visibility to one to three miles.
   The nation's hot spot was Death Valley, where the temperature
hit a scorching 120 degrees.
   The low temperature Friday morning for the Lower 48 states was
46 degrees at Hibbing, Minn., and Jordan, Mont.

   Federal and state environmental officials
Friday announced an agreement intended to pave the way for cleanup
of the dioxin-contaminated ghost town of Times Beach after seven
years of study and negotiations.
   Morris Kay, regional director of the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency, announced at a news conference that a cleanup
agreement had been reached with Syntex Agribusiness Inc., a
chemical and animal health company.
   The settlement is subject to a 30-day public comment period and
then approval by U.S. District Judge John F. Nangle. But both Kay
and Syntex spokesman Ray Forrester said preliminary work could
begin within days of the judge's decision.
   Under the settlement, Syntex will build and later demolish an
incinerator to burn the tons of dioxin-tainted soil from Times
Beach and 27 other sites in eastern Missouri contaminated in the
1970s when waste oil containing dioxin was sprayed on roads to keep
dust down.
   Syntex, based in Palo Alto, Calif., did not produce the dioxin.
But the government considers Syntex a responsible party because the
dioxin was produced by a tenant in a Verona plant owned by a
company Syntex later acquired.
   ``I think this agreement is a good compromise,'' Forrester said.
``It allows the problem to be solved and allows the money to be
spent on the solution, rather than litigation.''
   The company declined to say how much it expects to spend on the
cleanup, but Kay said Syntex would do at least half of work the EPA
has estimated would cost $200 million.
   Under the agreeement, Syntex must pay the government $10 million
over five years to cover part of the cost of prosecuting the case.
In return, all federal and state lawsuits against the company will
be dismissed.
   ``We believe that this is a safe, effective, permanent solution
to this dioxin contamination and we certainly look forward to the
day when we can say this cleanup is finished,'' said Missouri
Department of Natural Resources spokeswoman Anita Randolph.
   Times Beach, about 20 miles southwest of St. Louis, has been
deserted since 1983, when the federal government bought up all 801
homes and businesses and moved the people out.
   Guards patrol its fenced perimeter to keep vandals out of
dilapidated buildings now taken over by weeds and wild animals.
   Announcement of the settlement brought angry words from
opponents of the incinerator plan, who criticized the secrecy of
the negotiations and who believe the incinerator will be unsafe and
will become a permanent fixture.
   ``We will have created the central hazardous waste site of the
United States if this goes through,'' said state Rep. Jim Murphy,
who with several other opponents showed up at the news conference.
   A recently passed state law limits an incinerator permit to five
years.
   The EPA's Kay, who said the agreement called for the cleanup to
be completed in five to seven years, said all concerns had been met.
   ``We are very pleased with the agreement and we believe the
agreement addresses the local peoples' concerns,'' Kay said.
``We're not going to allow anything that's unsafe.''
   He said the EPA would continue to pursue other potentially
responsible parties.
   Dioxin, an unwanted byproduct in the manufacture of chemicals
like disinfectant, is suspected of causing disorders of the nervous
system, liver, kidneys and bladder. It has been found to cause
cancer in laboratory animals.
   The EPA says the incinerator would roast the contaminated soil
so the dioxin molecules break up into carbon, oxygen, chlorine and
hydrogen.
   The treated soil would no longer be hazardous and would be
buried in a landfill on site. The area would then be safe again for
habitation, although federal flood plain regulations enacted since
Times Beach was founded would prohibit building houses there,
Randolph said.
   As part of the cleanup agreement, Syntex will demolish all
buildings on the site and restore it for public use, possibly as a
park or walking trails.

<HEAD>UNLV Becomes 2nd Basketball Champ in 3 Years Banned From
Postseason Play</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The University of Nevada, Las Vegas, was
barred Friday from defending its men's basketball title for
recruiting violations originally detailed in 1977.
   The school immediately announced it would appeal the one-year
ban on postseason play, which the the National Collegiate Athletic
Association imposed as the final resolution of a bitter battle with
head coach Jerry Tarkanian that stretches back 13 years.
   ``I think it's a miscarriage of justice,'' UNLV President Robert
Maxson said. ``We're being penalized twice for the same offense and
that violates one of the basic principles of justice.''
   The sanction will have no effect on television appearances or
the number of athletic scholarships UNLV is allowed to give. The
postseason ban would also include the NIT tournament.
   After UNLV and Tarkanian were found guilty of recruiting
violations in 1977, the school served a two-year probation and
Tarkanian was suspended for two years by the school, as ordered by
the NCAA. But he sued to block the suspension.
   The case reached the U.S. Supreme Court in 1988. In a 5-4
ruling, the high court reaffirmed the NCAA's right to discipline
member schools, but ruled that only the school can discipline a
coach. However, a Nevada state court injunction still effectively
bars the school from taking any action against Tarkanian.
   Kansas was the first champion barred from defending its title by
the NCAA. It received sanctions after winning the 1988 national
championship.
   Tarkanian, reached at his San Diego vacation home, declined to
comment.

   A federal grand jury demanded campaign
spending records from all 46 state senators Friday, expanding the
scope of an investigation into allegations that lawmakers traded
votes for cash.
   FBI agents delivered the grand jury subpoenas to the Senate
Ethics Committee two days after asking for similar campaign records
from all 124 House members. Those records were turned over Thursday.
   The probe involves an FBI sting operation in which a lobbyist
working undercover offered legislators cash in exchange for votes
on pari-mutuel betting legislation in the General Assembly. Agents
videotaped some lawmakers accepting money, a source who requested
anonymity told The Associated Press.
   ``It will cut deep _ both parties are involved. ... It crosses
everything,'' an unidentified source told The Charlotte (N.C.)
Observer for an article published Friday.
   The newspaper reported that sources called the probe one of the
Justice Department's top white-collar investigations this year.
   The investigation apparently involves possible violations of the
Hobbs Act, a federal anti-corruption law banning acceptance of
money or gifts in return for votes or other favors.
   U.S. Attorney Bart Daniel and Fred Verinder, the FBI's top agent
in South Carolina, confirmed only that an investigation was under
way into allegations of ``illegal conduct involving certain members
of the South Carolina Legislature.''
   ``There will be no further comment until charges are filed,''
they said in a statement.
   Ron L. Cobb, a former House member-turned-lobbyist, is at the
center of the probe, according to lawmakers. They said Cobb offered
at least three legislators money in exchange for their help on a
bill that would have allowed pari-mutuel betting in South Carolina.
The General Assembly failed to act on the measure before adjourning
in June.
   Cobb, who served in the House from 1977 to 1984, did not return
telephone messages left at his office Thursday or Friday. His home
telephone number is unlisted.
   Among Cobb's clients is Alpha Group, an Atlanta-based concern
interested in promoting pari-mutuel betting in South Carolina.
   Campaign contributions to legislators from Cobb, Alpha Group and
Cobb's company, Government Business Associates, totaled at least
$12,950 since 1987. Contributions ranged from $100 to $3,000.
   Cobb failed to meet this week's deadline to file an expense
report of his activities on Alpha's behalf, as required by law. The
secretary of state's office, which monitors lobbying activities in
South Carolina, is looking into the matter, Deputy Secretary of
State John Stokes said.
   Just who is behind Alpha Group remains a mystery.
   The telephone at Alpha Group's office went unanswered Thursday
and Friday; no street address is listed with directory information.
The computer at the Georgia secretary of state's office, where all
incorporated companies must register, was not working Friday, an
official said.
   Rep. Paul Derrick, who accepted $1,000 from Cobb in a Columbia
motel room earlier this year, said he now believes the cash payment
was part of an FBI sting.
   The Republican said Cobb did not ask him at the time for his
vote on pari-mutuel betting, but the lobbyist had earlier sought
his support for that bill.
   Rep. Ennis Fant, a Democrat, said he also discussed pari-mutuel
betting with Cobb, who told the lawmaker, ``Let me give you a
little gas for your tank,'' and produced $1,000 from his briefcase.
   Fant said he accepted two cash contributions totaling $1,300
from Cobb in March or April and reported them on his ethics
disclosure forms.
   Cobb is under investigation by Richland County prosecutors who
contend the lobbyist received several checks from an account at the
South Carolina Petroleum Marketers Association that may have been
used to pay off legislators, Solicitor James Anders said.

<HEAD>Committee Recommends Reprimand for Frank</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: INSERTS grafs 10-13: ``In his,'' more comment from Frank</NOTE>

   The House ethics committee's recommendation
Friday that Rep. Barney Frank be reprimanded for some of his help
for a male prostitute prompted some Republicans to call for stiffer
punishment, even expulsion.
   ``Barney Frank will certainly not consider it a slap on the
wrist,'' said ethics committee Chairman Julian Dixon, D-Calif., at
a news conference outlining the committee's findings. ``The
committee certainly does not consider it a slap on the wrist.''
   But Republicans said they would seek a vote to expel the
Massachusetts Democrat or censure him for his official actions on
behalf of male prostitute Stephen L. Gobie.
   Frank, a five-term liberal, said in a Newton, Mass., news
conference: ``I accept the judgement of the committee report.''
   The ethics committee unanimously reported that aspects of Rep.
Barney Frank's relationship with a male prostitute ``reflected
discredit upon the House'' and recommended that he be reprimanded
before the full House next week.
   But the panel also sharply criticized the credibility of Gobie,
Frank's chief accuser, saying that much of his testimony had been
contradicted when investigators checked it out. Gobie's lack of
credibility weighed heavily in the committee's conclusions, the
report stated.
   The panel also gave Frank credit for expressing regret for his
actions. Its report quotes the congressman as testifying:
   ``I will tell you again, with chagrin, that I did not handle the
pressures of having a public life, of being a closeted gay man,
nearly as well as I should have. I do think I managed to confine
most of the damage to myself. But when you are in a public
position, inevitably something spills over.''
   Frank is one of two acknowledged homosexuals in the House.
   In his news conference, he said, ``I think I am justified in
saying that this report bears out that ... I told the truth.''
   ``I don't think anyone who has judged the way this process has
gone, I don't think they'd say they're being soft on me.''
   He noted that work of the committee led to the resignation of
former speaker Jim Wright of Texas: ``This has been a tough group.''
   Gobie, meanwhile, told Boston radio station WEEI he was pleased
the committee was not harder on Frank.
   Frank paid Gobie $80 for sex and then hired him in July 1985 as
a housekeeper and driver, paying Gobie with personal funds. Frank
says he ended the relationship in August 1987 after learning that
Gobie was operating a sex-for-hire ring out of Frank's Capitol Hill
apartment.
   The panel, which has been investigating the case since Sept. 11,
unanimously concluded that Frank improperly fixed parking tickets _
some of them accumulated by Gobie using Frank's car on personal
business. And the panel said Frank ``set in motion'' a memo
containing misleading information about Gobie sent to a Virginia
prosecutor and ``which could have affected Mr. Gobie's probation.''
   Members of Congress do not have to pay parking tickets gathered
on official business in Washington.
   The committee rejected Gobie's accusation that Frank knew of a
prostitution ring that Gobie ran out of Frank's Capitol Hill
apartment. And the 12-member panel said it found no evidence
indicating that Frank and Gobie had sex in the House gymnasium, as
Gobie had alleged.
   The recommended reprimand is one of the milder sanctions
available to the House. Censure, the next most severe punishment,
would require that Frank stand in front of his colleagues while a
resolution condemning his activities is read.
   ``Every member is going to have to vote his or her conscience,''
said Rep. William Dannemeyer, R-Calif., who said he would propose
that the House expel Frank. ``The conduct of Mr. Frank failed to
meet the standard all of us must, that we reflect creditably on the
House of Representatives ... We live in a fishbowl in this
business.''
   Republican Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois said he expected there
would also be a motion to censure Frank.
   House Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash., predicted that the lasting
damage to Frank from the 10-month probe would be minimal.
   ``I think this matter will be soon put behind us,'' Foley said,
adding that the House would begin debate on the committee's
recommendation next week.
   ``Barney Frank remains one of the most effective and, I think
throughout the House, highly regarded members here,'' Foley said.
``His abilities, his intelligence, his capacities are well
respected and he's going to continue to be an extremely important
and significant member.''
   A summary of the committee's findings, outlined in five
conclusions:
   _Despite Gobie's testimony, ``The weight of the evidence does
not indicate that Representative Frank had either prior or
concomitant knowledge of prostitution activities alleged to have
taken place in his apartment involving third parties.''
   _Neither a sex therapist nor a probation officer overseeing
Gobie, who is a convicted felon on drug and sodomy charges, was
pressured by Frank to be lenient toward Gobie, again despite
Gobie's testimony.
   _Although Frank did not send the memo to the prosecutor in
Alexandria, Va., he did ``set into motion a series of contacts
resulting in that document being sent.'' The panel said the April
16, 1986 memo contained misleading statements favorable to Gobie.
   _``The committee concludes that Representative Frank acted
improperly in connection with 33 parking tickets.'' The committee
directed Frank to repay the tickets because ``there was no adequate
basis indicating his automobile was being used for official
purposes.''
   _In another rejection of Gobie's testimony, the committee said
there was no evidence indicating that the two had sex in the House
gymnasium.
   The misleading statements in the 1986 memo focused on statements
about how Frank met Gobie and false assertions that Gobie was
obeying the law.
   What prompted Frank to prepare the memo is unclear in the
committee's report. But the result, the committee said, was a
document sent to a prosecutor which ``could be perceived as an
attempt to use political influence to affect the outcome of the
administration of Mr. Gobie's probation.''
   Specifically, Frank said in the memo that he met Gobie ``through
mutual friends,'' concealing the fact that he met Gobie through an
advertisement for ``escort services'' in a gay publication. Frank
also indicated in the memo that he believe Gobie was obeying the
law while on probation.
   ``The congressman acknowledged to the committee that he was
aware that during the period in question Mr. Gobie was engaging in
prostitution,'' the committee said in its full report. ``It is
therefore clear that Representative Frank was not totally candid
and forthcoming in describing either the nature of, or the events
giving rise to his relationship with Stephen L. Gobie; as well as
Mr. Gobie's activities during probation.''
   Frank told his news conference he was less than candid in the
memo because he did not want to reveal his homosexuality.
   Frank is running for a sixth term from a suburban Boston
district. He faces a lone Republican opponent who has never held
elective office.

<HEAD>ANC, Government to Hold Second Meeting Next Month</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President F. W. de Klerk and
Nelson Mandela of the African National Congress met for an hour
Friday and agreed the government and the black nationalist movement
would hold a second round of talks next month.
   Friday's meeting was their first since just before Mandela left
on a six-week, three-continent tour urging the world to maintain
sanctions on South Africa until irreversible changes in apartheid
have been achieved.
   The Aug. 6 meeting, announced by de Klerk's office, is to
discuss obstacles in the way of formal negotiations on a new
constitution and the end of white minority rule. The ANC and
members of de Klerk's Cabinet reached preliminary agreements in
their May 2-4 meetings on such issues as violence, political
prisoners and returning exiles.
   A joint committee since then has made recommendations on how to
overcome disagreements, such as defining political crimes and who
would qualify for amnesty from prosecution.
   The two sides will consider the recommendations at the Aug. 6
meeting.
   De Klerk partially met one ANC demand by lifting the 4-year-old
national state of emergency in three of the country's four
provinces. He also signed executive orders allowing all members of
the ANC executive committee and many other officials to return to
South Africa without being arrested.
   The ANC says South African exiles number about 20,000, including
about 5,000 guerrilla fighters who would be subject to prosecution
under current law.
   The release of prisoners convicted of politically motivated
crimes or of acts connected to their affiliation with the ANC has
stalled recently after scores were freed earlier.
   De Klerk and his ministers have said they want speedy progress
toward negotiations with the ANC and other groups representing the
black majority. Mangosuthu Buthelezi's Zulu-based Inkatha party and
some other groups say they are ready to negotiate now. The Pan
Africanist Congress and some other groups insist on elimination of
apartheid and other demands before they will agree to talks.

   The way Jeff Daniels tells it, his first
reaction to the proposal of a film called ``Arachnophobia'' was
negative.
   ``My agent called and said, `Well, it's about spiders,' '' the
actor recalls. ``I said, `Oh great! `The Attack of the Killer
Spiders.' Great!
   Terrific! I'll pass.''
   When the agent explained that coproducers Frank Marshall,
Kathleen Kennedy and Steven Spielberg were involved in the project,
Daniels agreed to read the script. And liked it. His verdict: ``If
anybody can do this in a first-class way, those guys can.''
   After years of directing second unit on Spielberg films, Frank
Marshall made his debut as director with ``Arachnophobia.'' Besides
the human actors _ Daniels, John Goodman, Julian Sands, Harley Jane
Kozak _ Marshall directed hundreds of spiders that invade a small
California town.
   ``I don't mind the little guys,'' Daniels admitted. ``I'm pretty
much a manly man when it comes to that sort of thing. But the big
boys, nine inches across with the legs spread out, the kind that
spit at you.''
   ``They had a `spider orientation' on the second day of shooting.
We were all supposed to go and basically learn how to become
friends with the spiders and have them crawl on you as pets. I blew
that off. If we're supposed to be afraid of spiders, let's be
afraid of spiders.''
   ``If there's any opportunity at all to eliminate acting I'm all
for it. In the second half of this movie, there's not a lot of
acting going on. It's personal terror.''
   Danile said 90 per cent of the spiders in ``Arachnophobia'' are
the real thing, the rest are mechanical. The actor was fascinated
by the special affects _ ``that's one of the reasons I did this
picture: I wanted to see how they did it. And I had the best seat
in the house.''
   With his gangly frame and bland, blond looks, Jeff Daniels often
goes unrecognized for his solid contributions to films. He was fine
as Debra Winger's errant husband in ``Terms of Endearment,'' but he
was neglected in the shower of Academy nominations for the film
(``I think even the guy who combed my hair was nominated'').
   He rationalized: ``When I saw `Rain Man,' I said, `Hoffman is
great, but Cruise is the guy who makes the movie work.' The guys
who win the awards are the guys who get the flashy roles. It's
always been that way.''
   ``It's the same thing with `Arachnophobia.' Somebody's gotta
keep it all together. I'm the hub that goes through the movie.
People see the movie through me.''
   ``Hey, the whole point is to make a scene look as though it's
not acting. The phone keeps ringing. People keep hiring me. I must
be doing something right. It's okay. I'm glad to play the straight
man for a spider.''

<TEXT>
   A black man walking with his white girlfriend
was chased by a white man into the path of a truck that hit him,
leaving him critically injured in what police said was a racially
motivated attack.
   Daniel Porter, 21, of Baltimore was charged with assault and
reckless endangerment for chasing Herbert Jennings, 38, also of
Baltimore, on Thursday night. Porter was being held Friday pending
a bail hearing.
   Jennings and his 32-year-old white girlfriend, whom police would
not identify, were taunted shortly before 10 p.m. Thursday by two
white men in a pickup truck as they walked on a street in the
Highlandtown neighborhood of southeast Baltimore, not far from
where the girlfriend lives, police said.
   Moments later, Porter and two other white men approached the
couple and Porter yelled to the men in the truck, asking if they
wanted him to attack Jennings, whom he called by a racial epithet,
police said.
   A man in the truck yelled, ``Yes,'' and Jennings ran, with
Porter in pursuit, said police spokesman Dennis Hill.
   After running a short distance, Jennings slipped and fell and
was accidentally struck by another pickup truck, Hill said. The
driver of that truck was not charged.
   The girlfriend was not injured. The first truck, whose occupants
started the incident, sped away, Hill said.
   Hill said police don't believe that Porter, who lives about six
blocks from where the incident occurred, knew either Jennings or
the girlfriend. Jennings lives in a nearby neighborhood.
   Jennings was listed in critical condition Friday at the
University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center with a severe head
injury and cuts and bruises.
   His girlfriend and several other people were questioned, and
others may be charged, police said.
   Police community relations staff went to the neighborhood Friday
to calm residents' emotions.
   Highlandtown, a predominantly white working-class neighborhood
surrounded by predominantly black working-class neighborhoods, is a
quiet area with no history of racial problems, Hill said.
   ``I was over there this afternoon,'' he said. ``People were
expressing their regret that something like that would happen over
there.''
   Baltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke, who is black, said race relations
generally have improved in the city since the riots of the 1960s.
   In a separate incident early Wednesday, in a neighborhood
several miles away, a black man was stabbed to death when he and a
friend were attacked by a group of white men. Police had no clear
evidence that that incident was racially motivated, Hill said, but
he added, ``We are treating it as if it were.''
   Thursday night's incident provoked comparisons with one in New
York City, in which three white men were convicted in 1987 of
manslaughter, assault and conspiracy for attacking three black men
in the predominantly white Howard Beach section of Queens in 1986.
   One of the blacks was struck by a car and killed as he fled
across a nearby highway. Another man was beaten with tree limbs and
a baseball bat.

<HEAD>Indian Leaders Urge Quebec Police to Withdraw</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KAHNAWAKE, Quebec (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Canadian Indian chiefs on Friday called
for police to withdraw from barricades where they are locked in an
armed standoff with Mohawks who claim land there as ancestral
territory.
   The Indians from across Canada made the call at the end of a
three-day conference at the Kahnawake reserve south of Montreal.
   They called the conference to seek solutions for the crisis that
has left one police officer dead, prompted Indians from around the
nation to rally, and touched off an anti-Indian backlash.
   At the end of their meeting, the Indian leaders issued a
resolution calling for provincial police to pull away from the
barricades at Oka, a town 18 miles west of Montreal.
   The Indians are trying to block a plan by municipal officials to
build a golf course addition on the disputed land.
   At Friday's conference, the Indian leaders also asked Prime
Minister Brian Mulroney to reconvene Parliament immediately to deal
with the ``national crisis.''
   Mohawk Chief Joe Norton said both police and Indians should
withdraw from barricades in Oka and from a bridge between Montreal
and its southern suburbs, where a sympathy blockade has been set up
by other Indians. The bridge blockage has set off angry protests by
local residents, who have burned Indians in effigy and made
anti-Indian slurs.
   Norton also said the Mohawks at the blockades must be assured of
amnesty for a settlement to be reached.
   However, Quebec provincial Premier Robert Bourassa has already
said officials will not agree to amnesty for Indians involved in a
shootout at Oka on July 11. A provincial police officer was killed,
but it is not clear if he was killed by gunfire from Indians or
fellow officers.
   Tom Siddon, the federal Indian Affairs minister, added Friday,
``A federal minister cannot set aside the rule of law and deal with
an element which is using weapons and raising blockades on public
thoroughfares to achieve their ends.''
   Indians have been manning their barricade at Oka for four months.
   On Thursday, federal officials said they would try to acquire
the disputed land to block the golf course, but only if Indians
agree to lay down their arms.
   One Mohawk negotiator in Oka, Mavis Etienne, said Friday that
giving up their guns is ``out of the question.''
   ``You wouldn't ask your army or police officers to lay down
their arms. This has been done before, and they have put our young
people into jail _ for defending their own land,'' the negotiator
said.
   However, only a handful of Indians manned the barricade in Oka
during the day. One was seen carrying a gun.

   The Roman Catholic leader of Newfoundland offered
his resignation after a commission he formed blamed him and the
province's church for mishandling accusations that priests were
sexually abusing boys.
   Alphonsus Penney, archbishop of Newfoundland, made a public
apology Wednesday to the victims and their families after the
report was made public earlier in the day. He tendered his
resignation to Pope John Paul II.
   However, a Vatican spokesman said the pope was on vacation and
no decision had been made on the resignation. Penney can resign
only if the pope allows him to do so.
   Five priests or former priests have been convicted in the
eastern province on sexual abuse charges the past three years.
Several others are awaiting trial in the scandal, which first
became public in 1987.
   ``We are very sorry for the times you were not believed, were
not supported or were ostracized in any way in our community,'' the
archbishop said, accepting full responsibility for failing to deal
with the scandal. ``For every word and action which may have
deepened your pain, we are profoundly sorry.''
   For 2{ years, Penney refused calls to step down while more than
20 of his priests and lay members of the Newfoundland Catholic
community were charged or convicted of sexually abusing boys for
more than a decade.
   The five-member commission, created by Penney a year ago, said
the church adopted a policy of ``minimal response'' to the scandal,
even though it was receiving complaints about sexual misconduct by
some priests from parishioners, police, social workers and other
priests. It said church officials showed little compassion for the
victims and rallied behind the accused.
   The report stunned the 120,000 Catholics of Newfoundland, an
island province off the east coast of Canada.
   It said the boys were the victims of men who ``abused their
position of priestly status and power by acting out their regressed
sexuality with children.''
   Penney, 65, had denied he was aware of the charges against
priests before November 1987. But the report said there was
evidence he had been informed of the accusations in 1979 and 1984.
   Among the recommendations made by the commission were that the
church formally acknowledge its share of guilt and apologize to the
victims; that it revise policies on reacting to sexual abuse
complaints; that the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops be
asked to examine the problems created by forcing priests to be
celibate.
   The commission also proposed that a fund be established to
compensate victims, but it gave no dollar amount.
   The 700-page document will be sent out to parishes for study. A
public meeting is scheduled for Oct. 11.

<HEAD>RTC Reaches Bond Accord with Keating Company Creditors</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: A version is running on financial circuits</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   The Resolution Trust Corp. announced Friday
that it has reached an agreement with some creditors of American
Continental Corp. to recover some of the funds invested in bonds
sold by American Continental, a holding company controlled by
Charles H. Keating Jr.
   Keating is the target of a federal grand jury probe in Los
Angeles and a defendant in a $1.3 billion civil fraud suit filed in
Arizona by federal regulators. American Continental was the parent
of Lincoln Savings and Loan Association of Irvine, Calif., which
failed last year at a cost to taxpayers of around $1.5 billion.
   Under the new agreement, which is subject to court approval, the
unsecured creditors of American Continental would receive $21
million from the Resolution Trust Corp. to settle the claims they
filed in American Continental's bankruptcy case.
   The corporation is the government agency set up last year to
dispose of insolvent thrifts.
   The claims against American Continental by the bondholders and
other unsecured creditors total some $350 million. The company's
debts to them were not secured by any specific assets.
   The agreement also relieves Lincoln of any liability asserted by
the bondholders outside of the bankruptcy reorganization case.
   However, the bail-out corporation noted in a statement, no
settlement has yet been made with Keating and he will not be
allowed to share in the new agreement. The agreement does not
affect the lawsuit against Keating, who was the chief executive
officer of Phoenix-based American Continental.
   ``The settlement preserves the rights of the RTC and creditors
to pursue additional actions against Mr. Keating, other insiders,
accountants, lawyers and other persons who have contributed to the
insolvency of Lincoln Savings,'' the statement said.
   Keating's case has attracted great attention because of his
involvement with five senators who met with regulators on his
behalf after accepting political contributions. The so-called
``Keating Five'' are Sens. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., Dennis
DeConcini, D-Ariz., Donald W. Riegle, D-Mich., John Glenn, D-Ohio,
and John McCain, R-Ariz.

<HEAD>Stealth Fighter Arrives in Ohio, Escapes Storm</HEAD>

   A $42.6 million stealth fighter made three
quick passes and landed at its first air show Friday shortly before
a thunderstorm packing 70-mph winds swept through the area,
damaging two other planes.
   The F-117A touched down at Dayton International Airport at 3:45
p.m. and was safely in a hangar when the storm hit around 4:20 p.m.
Two Soviet MiG-29 fighters were on display, but also escaped damage.
   The 10-minute storm caused five minor injuries, damaged two Air
Force planes on display and knocked down some tents at the United
States Air and Trade Show in this Dayton suburb, organizers said.
   The show was expected to open as scheduled Saturday.
   Organizers billed the arrival of the black, sharply angled
stealth fighter as its first air show appearance. It was greeted by
hundreds of onlookers who rushed past security guards to get a
closer look.
   The fighter is not expected to perform aerial demonstrations at
the show, which runs through Sunday.
   Also on hand were the two Soviet fighters, as well as a
33-member Soviet delegation, none of whom was injured in the storm.
   The F-117A is a tactical aircraft designed for ground attack and
possibly air-to-air combat. It is designed to elude radar and was
developed in near-complete secrecy by Lockheed Corp.
   The Pentagon first acknowledged its existence in November 1988.
   The program to develop the stealth fighter was managed at
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton.
   Last week, the Air Force accepted the last of 59 fighters from
Lockheed's ``Skunk Works'' operation in Southern California, nine
years after the aircraft's first flight.
   The F-117A was not the only stealth aircraft getting attention
at the show. Leroy Schroeder, test pilot for the B-2 bomber,
conducted briefings Friday on the status of flight testing on that
stealth aircraft.
   Schroeder said the B-2 has been in the air for 67 hours during
its 16 flights.
   ``We've looked at how the airplane behaves ... and we're very,
very pleased with it,'' said Schroeder, who works for B-2 builder
Northrop Corp.
   More than 350,000 people are expected to attend the show.

   A military tribunal has condemned 10
officers to death for leading a failed coup attempt, Lagos
newspapers reported Friday. The trial was closed to the public and
the verdicts were not published.
   The newspapers, quoting sources, said the sentences were subject
to review by the Armed Forces Ruling Council, but 10 wooden stakes
had already been set up at Kirikiri Prison on the spot where
executions normally occur.
   The officers were charged with attacking Dodon Barracks,
military headquarters and residence of President Gen. Ibrahim
Babangida, on April 22. Babangida barely escaped with his life, and
his house was badly damaged.
   The coup leaders, who took over national radio headquarters for
several hours, said they wanted to end the domination of the
country by Moslem northerners.
   Forces loyal to Babangida put down the coup attempt.
   The Amnesty International human rights organization, with
headquarters in London, and other groups have appealed to the
military government to open the trial of the military men, and to
commute any death sentences to prison terms.

   Rep. Lindy Boggs, the powerful,
plantation-born dean of Louisiana's congressional delegation,
announced Friday she won't run again for the seat she and her late
husband held for 46 years.
   ``With my husband, I have devoted half a century to one of the
most noble pursuits I know _ public service. ... Today I am
announcing that this chapter in my service to the public is
ending,'' Mrs. Boggs told 150 colleagues and supporters including
former Archbishop Philip Hannan and former mayor Vic Schiro.
   Mrs. Boggs, her daughter Cokie Roberts, and politicians
including Mayor Sidney Barthelemy and Sen. J. Bennett Johnston,
D-La., spoke in a Tulane University building named after the
Democratic congresswoman.
   The room was small, and less than half the audience was seated.
Another crowd milled about and chatted in the lobby outside. A few
people stood outside, looking through the floor-to-ceiling windows
that made up two walls of the room, so they could see Mrs. Boggs.
   Mrs. Boggs, 74, wouldn't discuss details of her decision to
retire after 17{ years in Washington.
   ``I don't think I can share with you all of the things that ran
through my mind, because some of them are very personal,'' she said.
   It had been widely reported that she wanted to spend more time
with her daughter, Princeton, N.J., Mayor Barbara Sigmund, who is
suffering from cancer.
   Mrs. Boggs did not refer to Ms. Sigmund's illness. Asked if she
was retiring because of the strain of travel between New Jersey,
Washington and New Orleans, Mrs. Boggs said ``You've been talking
to some of my family!'' but added, ``No.''
   She did say the decision was a wrenching one because so many
people offered to help run her office and campaign so she could
take care of family obligations. And some of her colleagues
appeared to refer obliquely to Ms. Sigmund's illness.
   ``With the dignity and grace that marked her outstanding career
in the Congress, Lindy Boggs has announced her retirement from the
Congress. Words cannot adequately describe how much all of us will
miss Lindy, or the regret we feel at the reasons for her
retirement,'' said House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo.
   ``She'll be missed beyond my ability to say. There is no member
whom I've served with in 25 years whose departure from Congress I
more sincerely or deeply regret than Lindy Boggs,'' said House
Speaker Thomas Foley. ``With intelligence, grace, charm,
commitment, compassion, she has served the people of her district,
the state of Louisiana and the United States with extraordinary
dedication.''
   Mrs. Boggs took over the seat in March 1973 after winning a
special election to succeed her husband, the powerful House
majority leader, whose plane disappeared during a flight over
Alaska six months earlier.
   Hale Boggs had won the seat in 1940, as a young lawyer. He lost
a re-election bid in 1942 but reclaimed the job in 1946 after
returning from military service, beginning a string of 22 straight
victories by him or his wife.
   Mrs. Boggs, the only white representing a majority-black U.S.
House district, said she hasn't decided whether to endorse anyone
in the campaign for her seat. In a brief interview, she said she
makes endorsements only ``in specific runoffs or where there's a
huge difference between the candidates.''
   ``I'm enthusiastically for Bennett Johnston,'' she added.
   Johnston is running for re-election this year against David
Duke, an ex-Ku Klux Klan leader running as a Republican, and state
Sen. Ben Bagert, the GOP's endorsed candidate and sponsor of
Louisiana's new workfare law.
   Mrs. Boggs' announcement was interrupted by applause when she
said, ``I am proud of my small role in opening doors to blacks and
women....
   ``The civil Rights and Voting Rights Acts that Hale and I
supported were key to this progress, but so were the educational
and economic opportunities we helped to create.''
   She listed the Head Start program, her sponsorship of bills to
guarantee access to credit for women and minorities, and her work
to ensure participation of businesses owned by women and minorities
in major federal projects such as the superconducting supercollider
and the space station.
   ``I rejoice in my role in bringing about changes in the way we
think about our environment,'' she said. ``Clean air, clean water,
controls of hazardous materials, protection of our precious
wetlands, and the acknowledgement of the global warming trend are
now accepted policy objectives, not wishful thinking.''
   Blacks have been reluctant to challenge Mrs. Boggs in the past,
both because of her power _ she has taken 60 percent of the vote in
every election since the special election in 1973, when she was
first elected _ and her staunch support of civil rights throughout
her career.
   As the moderator was about to end the session Friday, an elderly
black stood up. ``You supported civil rights when civil rights was
decidedly unfashionable. ... You worked for the first subdivision
so blacks could own their own homes ... The black community says
`Thank you, Lindy, for all you have done for us,'' said Phillip
Baptiste, a businessman and longtime community and civil rights
activist.
   Mrs. Boggs' power was not only at the polls. Johnston, Reps.
Billy Tauzin and Jimmy Hayes, also Democrats, and other speakers
told story after story of how the soft-spoken congresswoman won
concessions that no other representative could get for his or her
city and state.
   When Housing and Urban Development money was frozen during a
scandal in the department, Mrs. Boggs got Secretary Jack Kemp to
release money for two projects for senior citizens, said
Barthelemy. Later, he said, one of Kemp's associates told him ``She
asked so sweetly and so nicely that the secretary couldn't turn her
down. He turned everybody else in the country down but Lindy
Boggs.''
   Ms. Roberts, who covers Congress for National Public Radio, said
Rep. Jamie L. Whitten, D-Miss., chairman of the Appropriations
Committee on which her mother sits, told her recently that ``your
mama can get anything she wants out of me.
   ``I said, `Mr. Chairman!' He said, `Yeah, just like my wife ...
I wouldn't dare say no to either one of them.'''
   However, at least two prominent black Democrats had already
announced they were running in the district, which has a 60 percent
black voting majority, and a third is likely to join them.
   State Sen. Jon Johnson kicked off his campaign for the Oct. 6
primary in April. Marc Morial, a lawyer and the elder son of the
late Mayor Dutch Morial, had a gala reception Thursday night to
formally announce his candidacy. State Sen. William Jefferson, who
said earlier that he probably would enter the race if Mrs. Boggs
stepped out, scheduled a Tuesday news conference to announce his
candidacy, said his wife, Andrea.
   If no candidate gets more than 50 percent of the vote, a runoff
would be held Nov. 6.

<HEAD>Lawsuit Settled; DOE Will Seek Permit Before Burning Rocky Flats

<TEXT>
   The Department of Energy has agreed to not burn
mixed plutonium and hazardous wastes in two incinerators at the
Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant without getting a permit from
Colorado or the Environmental Protection Agency.
   The consent agreement, approved Thursday by U.S. District Judge
Lewis T. Babcock and announced Friday, settles a lawsuit brought by
the Sierra Club against the federal agency. EG&amp;G Inc., which
operates Rocky Flats for the department, was added to the action
later.
   ``The settlement and the court's order remove the threat that
DOE will resume its `trial burn' plans without a hearing before the
public,'' Eugene DeMayo, chairman of the Sierra Club's Rocky
Mountain Chapter, said in a statement.
   ``We are happy that DOE agreed that a permit is necessary in
this instance,'' he said.
   The DOE had said it had authority to operate the incinerators
while awaiting a permit, but the Sierra Club challenged that claim
in its June 1989 lawsuit.
   Rocky Flats, 16 miles northwest of Denver, makes plutonium
triggers for nuclear weapons. Plutonium processing there has been
suspended until the plant's safety procedures are upgraded.
   David Simonson, DOE deputy director of Rocky Flats, said in a
telephone interview Friday that the agency agreed to drop its
contention that it did not need a permit before using the
incinerators.
   The incinerators never have been used to dispose of wastes mixed
with plutonium at the plant, and Simonson said there are no plans
to use them for that purpose.
   The Sierra Club and DOE have been at odds since 1987, when the
DOE first proposed a ``trial burn'' employing the incinerators,
over whether the federal government needed to get a permit before
burning the wastes.
   Following the announcement, the Sierra Club filed a lawsuit. It
was settled later in 1987 after the DOE agreed not to use the
incinerators until 45 days after completing an environmental
assessment report.
   But the agency continued to maintain, even after that
settlement, that it had authority to start up and operate the
incinerators while it went about getting a permit, said Adam
Babich, the Denver attorney who represented the Sierra Club.
   As a result, the Sierra Club brought its second lawsuit on June
2, 1989, just four days before scores of FBI and EPA agents raided
Rocky Flats, looking for evidence of violations of hazardous waste
disposal laws. A federal grand jury was convened in August 1989 to
examine the allegations, but no indictments have been returned.

<TEXT>
   A security guard for Marion Barry testified
Friday that he saw no drugs during the mayor's 1988 Virgin Islands
trip.
   The testimony by police Detective Ulysses Walltower contrasted
sharply with that of prosecution witnesses who described heavy drug
use and drinking by Barry during the four-day visit.
   However, Walltower said under cross-examination by the
prosecution that he was not with Barry during much of the time
convicted drug dealer Charles Lewis has said he used drugs with the
mayor.
   In a related development, defense lawyer R. Kenneth Mundy
alleged that Lewis had contacts with the family of convicted
District of Columbia drug kingpin Rayful Edmond III.
   The jury was out of the courtroom when Mundy made his
statements, which came as he questioned an FBI agent.
   Mundy said he brought up Lewis' alleged connection with Edmond
to impeach Lewis' testimony. However, U.S. District Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson said Mundy could impeach the testimony only if he
called Lewis as a witness.
   After the court session, Barry said he was happy with the way
his case was proceeding.
   ``We are up against an awesome power _ the U.S. government,''
Barry said. ``But our strategy is to prove that the government has
not proven, beyond a shadow of a doubt, the charges against me.''
   Lewis testified earlier in the mayor's cocaine possession and
perjury trial that Barry asked him on the first afternoon of the
Virgin Islands trip to buy crack cocaine. The request came when
there was no one else in the room, Lewis said.
   Walltower, testifying on the second day of the defense's case,
said that on that afternoon he accompanied Barry's son,
Christopher, and the boy's companion to a nearby beach.
   ``They went down several times, for 30 or 45 minutes,''
Walltower said. ``Then they would go back to the room, mess around,
and go back down to the beach.''
   Barry, Walltower said, spent his time on official business and
playing with his son.
   Walltower also said he spent little time with the mayor in the
evenings _ periods during which Lewis and other witnesses have said
drugs were used.
   Lewis testified that he bought $300 worth of crack cocaine that
he, the mayor and others smoked during Barry's four-day visit.
   Walltower, a 20-year police veteran, also said he saw Barry in
the company of only two women. Lewis testified that he brought
three women to Barry's hotel room.
   One of those women, Linda Maynard, testified that Barry sexually
assaulted her. Another, Zena Mattias, said she rebuffed Barry's
sexual advances.
   Walltower, who said he did not now the names of either woman he
saw, also testified that he thought one of them was with Lewis.
   Mundy also said Friday he will show a videotape he said places
Barry in a government meeting at a time when a government witness
has testified she delivered drugs to the mayor in Washington.
   One possession charge against Barry stems from the testimony of
Lydia Reid Pearson, who said she delivered cocaine _ and a city job
application _ to Barry at a government office building Sept. 7,
1988.
   Mundy said the tape is of a meeting between Barry and top fire
department officials that occurred at the time Pearson said she met
with the mayor.
   Barry, 54, has pleaded innocent to 10 misdemeanor cocaine
possession charges, one misdemeanor cocaine conspiracy count and
three felony charges of lying to a grand jury about his alleged
drug use.

   President Bush showed up about a half-hour
late at the Cheyenne Municipal Airport on Friday evening, sporting
a big smile and a baseball cap and toting a 12-inch trout.
   The president showed off his catch to the press and spectators
as he crossed the tarmac to Air Force One, which took off around
6:40 p.m. for Washington.
   When asked how his fishing went, the president gave the ``thumbs
up'' sign and said, ``Good.'' He then reached into a plastic
garbage sack and grabbed the trout to show to the press.
   Bush, who'd been scheduled to arrive at the airport at 5:50 p.m.
but didn't show up until around 6:20 p.m., spent about three hours
fishing in the Middle Crow Creek west of Cheyenne with U.S. Sens.
Al Simpson and Malcolm Wallop and Rep. Craig Thomas, all Wyoming
Republicans.
   Simpson and Thomas said Bush's fish was the last, biggest catch
of the day. They said the president appeared hesitant to leave for
the airport until he caught a fish.
   The delegation accompanied the president to the airport, where
Simpson opened a plastic garbage bag to show off the six other
trout caught by the group.
   The president was in Cheyenne to help celebrate Wyoming's
centennial, where he joined in a parade and gave a speech to
thousands of spectators.

<TEXT>
   President Bush's next move to keep the Khmer
Rouge from regaining power in Cambodia will likely be direct talks
with the government in Phnom Penh _ not just with its longtime
sponsor, Vietnam.
   That would mean going beyond this week's opening to Hanoi, a
move that reversed U.S. policy; crossed China, the major supplier
of the communist Khmer Rouge; and drew plaudits from Capitol Hill.
   It is a step, policy-making insiders said, urged by Secretary of
State James A. Baker III but opposed by Brent Scowcroft, the
president's national security assistant, when Bush considered his
options at a White house meeting last Friday.
   Baker, backed by others in the State Department, proposed Bush
deal with Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen, whose government the
United States has tried to overthrew for years by helping a
guerrilla coalition.
   Baker argued that dealing with Phnom Penh might help break the
link between China and the Khmer Rouge, the murderous and most
powerful of the three anti-government factions in the coalition.
   The Khmer Rouge, which massacred hundreds of thousands of
Cambodians when it ran the country from 1975 to 1978, now holds
much of the northern part of the country and is advancing toward
the capital.
   Scowcroft supported holding talks with Vietnam but advised
against going further at this time. He was willing, however, to
leave that door open if doing so would speed up elections in
Cambodia.
   To hold direct talks with Phnom Penh now, he cautioned, could
have the opposite effect and draw China and the Khmer Rouge even
closer together.
   Disagreements between the State Department and the National
Security Council are not unusual. It's been said the only time a
secretary of state and a national security adviser were in total
accord was when Henry A. Kissinger held both posts under Presidents
Nixon and Ford.
   Still, Baker and Scowcroft have been working in harmony since
the administration took office 18 months ago.
   But the disagreement over direct talks with the Cambodian
government is not upsetting officials at the State Department.
   ``I think at one point we will take that step,'' an official who
requested anonymity said. ``Given (that) we got most of what we
wanted, it wasn't so critical.''
   While Bush's decision will mean talking to the Vietnamese about
holding multi-party elections in Cambodia, it may also lead to U.S.
recognition of Vietnam, lowering a 15-year trade embargo and,
perhaps, a slowdown of the tragic exodus of ``boat people.''
   For now, Bush has given up trying to isolate Vietnam
diplomatically. Even though he isn't ready to normalize relations
with Hanoi or authorize talks with the Cambodian government, he is
no longer shunning the two countries as puppets of Moscow.
   Congress was moving to choke off aid to the Cambodian guerrillas
when Bush acted. ``American foreign policy can succeed only when it
enjoys bipartisan support,'' Baker wrote Senate Democratic leader
George Mitchell of Maine on Wednesday.
   Bush and Baker also were guided by other practical
considerations. One was successful cooperation with the Soviet
Union, which also backs the Cambodian government, in other regional
disputes. The next dividend could be an agreement on how to end the
12-year war in Afghanistan.
   The most practical reason of all, however, was to try to staunch
the bloodletting in Cambodia.
   The guerrillas were unable to contain the Khmer Rouge, Baker
said in announcing the policy shift Wednesday. ``The fighting
continues. Cambodians continue to suffer and Cambodians continue to
die.''

<HEAD>NEA Revises Obscenity Pledge for Artists It Funds With Foundation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CATHERINE CROCKER</BYLINE>

   The National Endowment for the Arts has agreed
to let artists also funded by the Rockefeller Foundation sign a
modified version of its controversial anti-obscenity pledge, both
parties said Friday.
   Joint grantees can add wording to the current NEA pledge that
they will comply with its provisions ``to the extent that such
terms and conditions, and the requirement to accept them, are
lawful under the Constitution and the laws of the United States.''
   The Rockefeller Foundation opposes the NEA pledge, which
requires grantees to promise not to create obscene works.
   In a letter to recipients released Friday, the foundation said
it believed the pledges were ``unconstitutional, unfair and
dangerous to artists, and that they limit the range of art
produced.''
   The modified language provided a measure of protection for
artists funded by both agencies, it said.
   The foundation first disclosed the agreement in a
friend-of-the-court brief filed late Wednesday on behalf of the New
School for Social Research, which sued the NEA and refused to sign
the anti-obscenity pledge to get a grant.
   The NEA confirmed the agreement on Friday; a spokesman said it
agreed to the modified language late last month.
   ``Because of the co-mingling of private and public money, the
endowment agreed to a modification of the guidelines,'' said
spokesman Josh Dare.
   Only artists and organizations receiving money from the NEA and
the foundation would be eligible to sign the revised agreement, he
said.
   ``We aren't including it for any others,'' Dare said. ``It's a
unique funding situation, so it turns into a unique compliance
situation.''
   The endowment decided earlier this month to use the definition
of obscenity established in 1973 by the Supreme Court rather than
broader language adopted by Congress last year, Dare said.
   The anti-obscenity language included in the endowment's fiscal
1990 appropriation forbids the NEA to fund work that might be
deemed obscene, ``including but not limited to, depictions of
sadomasochism, homoeroticism, the sexual exploitation of children,
or individuals engaged in sex acts, which when taken as a whole, do
not have serious literary, artistic, political or scientific
value.''
   The endowment and the Rockefeller Foundation jointly fund the
New Forms Regional Initiative, which gives grants to emerging
artists; Meet the Composer, which sets up collaborations with
composers; and the Fund for U.S. Artists at International
Festivals, Dare said.
   The endowment's funding for these projects in 1990 totaled
$540,00, while the foundation put up $791,000, he said.
   The Rockefeller Foundation expects to give out more than $90
million in grants this year, of which $15 million will be for the
arts and humanities, said foundation spokesman Frank Karel.
   The NEA's appropriation for 1990 was $153 million.

<HEAD>Famous Directors Petition MPAA to Reform Ratings</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Movie Ratings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN HORN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Many of the nation's leading filmmakers _
including Francis Ford Coppola, Barry Levinson and Paul Mazursky _
will ask the Motion Picture Association of America to change its
movie rating system.
   In a petition to be delivered to the MPAA offices here Tuesday,
more than a dozen top directors ask that a new rating be
established for adult-oriented films that are not pornographic,
according to a copy of the letter.
   ``The taint of an X rating clearly results in massive and
arbitrary corporate censorship,'' the petition says. ``Failure to
address this problem will help foster a new era of `McCarthyism' in
the arts as during the 50's, when the networks claimed it was not
they who blacklisted artists, but the sponsors.''
   The letter says the X rating ``has come to be universally
recognized as pertaining simply to pornography. ... We therefore
strongly suggest that a new rating of A (for adult) or M (for
mature) be incorporated into the system to indicate a film contains
strong adult themes or images and that minors are not to view
them.''
   A number of critically acclaimed films _ included ``Tie Me Up!
Tie Me Down!,'' ``Portrait of a Serial Killer,'' ``Scandal'' and
``The Cook, the Thief, His Wife &amp; Her Lover'' _ have been rated X
in recent months.
   The petition also was signed by Spike Lee, Rob Reiner, Jonathan
Demme, Jim Jarmusch, Ron Howard, John Sayles, Penny Marshall, John
Waters, Edward Zwick and John Landis, among others. It follows a
similar request made this week by the National Society of Film
Critics to the MPAA asking they create a new rating for mature
films.
   Mark Lipsky, the president of film distributor Silverlight
Entertainment, said he organized the directors' petition because
films with X ratings are denied newspaper and television
advertisements and are refused by many theaters. Films carrying the
X rating, he said, often are ignored by adult viewers who might
enjoy them because the rating has such negative connotations.
   ``And that's censorship,'' Lipsky said. ``The MPAA is being
irresponsible if they don't face the issue.''
   A spokeswoman for the MPAA in Washington said the organization
would not be able to comment on the letter until next week. Earlier
in the day, Jack Valenti, the MPAA president, said the rating
system works.
   A New York judge ruled Thursday that the MPAA's X rating
unfairly brands films for mature audiences as pornographic, and
called for the organization to devise a new rating system.
   Judge Charles Ramos, while saying he did not have the authority
to change an X rating given to the acclaimed Spanish film ``Tie Me
Up! Tie Me Down!,'' called the MPAA ratings system ``an effective
form of censorship.''
   In a scathing 15-page opinion, Ramos wrote that unless the MPAA
reforms the rating system, it might find itself subject to legal
challenge. He called on the organization ``to consider the
proposals for a revised rating system that provides a professional
basis for rating films or to cease the practice altogether.''
   He said the problem ``is the need to avoid stigmatizing films of
an adult nature, which ought not to be seen by children, but which
are clearly not pornographic.''
   ``Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!'' features one sex scene and a brief
masturbation scene, and was given an X rating. Many newspapers and
movie theaters prohibit advertising and exhibition of X-rated
movies.

   In his 34 years on the Supreme Court, Justice
William J. Brennan has left his mark in majority opinions that
helped shaped the law and in dissents that offered tributes to
individual liberties.
   Here is a sampling:
   In 1957, Brennan wrote for the court as it first attempted to
define obscenity and ruled that obscenity is not constitutionally
protected. He said material is obscene if ``to the average person
applying contemporary community standards, the dominant theme of
the material taken as a whole appeals to prurient interest.''
   In 1962, the court established its one-person, one-vote standard
of equal representation. Brennan said judges have authority to
strike down state-approved legislative district lines. ``The right
asserted is within the reach of judicial protection under the
Fourteenth Amendment,'' he said.
   In 1964, the court granted constitutional protection to the news
media when it is sued for libel. Brennan wrote, ``The
constitutional guarantees require, we think, a federal rule that
prohibits a public official from recovering damages for a
defamatory falsehood relating to his official conduct unless he
proves that the statement was made with actual malice _ that is,
with knowledge that it was false or with reckless disregard of
whether it was false or not.''
   When the court ruled against prison inmates in a little-noted
case during the 1986-87 term, Brennan wrote in dissent:
   ``Prisoners are persons whom most of us would rather not think
about. ... It is easy to think of prisoners as members of a
separate netherworld... Nothing can change the fact, however, that
the society these prisoners inhabit is our own. When prisoners
emerge from the shadows to press a constitutional claim ... they
speak the language of a charter upon whicch all of us rely to hold
official power accountable.''
   When the court ruled that a former soldier who unknowingly
ingested LSD in secret chemical warfare experiments could not sue
due the government, Brennan dissented and said:
   ``The subject of experimentation who has not volunteered is
treated as an object, a sample...Soldiers ought not to be asked to
defend a Constitution indifferent to their essential human
dignity.''

   The former Exxon Valdez inched its way out of
dry dock Friday night after 11 months of repairs to the tanker's
hull, which was shredded in the nation's worst oil spill.
   The ship, renamed the Exxon Mediterranean, was being maneuvered
about a quarter-mile to a shipyard pier in San Diego Bay for
systems tests.
   Winches on the deck of the 987-foot-long tanker pulled tow lines
as the ship emerged bow first from the dock at National Steel and
Shipbuilding Co.
   Several tugboats began towing the ship to the pier, where its
engines, pumps and other machinery will be tested before two weeks
of sea trials.
   ``They'll make sure everything runs and there's no leaks in any
of the systems,'' shipyard spokesman Fred Hallett said. ``It's
basic operating _ like idling a car.
   ``At sea, they'll go full speed ... putting her through her
maximum paces and making sure not only that she works, but to''
specifications, Hallett said.
   The 24-hour process of flooding the dry dock and ballasting the
ship began late Thursday, Hallett said.
   The ship is expected to remain pierside for about two weeks
before embarng.

   The judge who sent Pete Rose to prison for
cheating on his taxes challenged him to become a hero again in the
eyes of youngsters.
   U.S. District Judge S. Arthur Spiegel on Thursday sentenced
baseball's all-time hit leader to five months in prison and three
months in a halfway house. He also ordered Rose to pay a $50,000
fine and perform 1,000 hours of work at schools and a youth club
when he is released on a year's probation.
   Rose's gambling already had gotten him banned from baseball for
life, in August. In April he pleaded guilty to failing to report
more than $354,000 in income from gambling, autograph signings and
memorabilia sales.
   Spiegel said inner-city youngsters need someone to look up to _
and that Rose, whose baseball nickname was Charlie Hustle, still
can be that person.

   A newspaper cannot be held liable for
breaking a promise of confidentiality to a source, Minnesota's
highest court ruled today in rejecting a $700,000 award against the
state's two biggest daily papers.
   Lawyers for both sides agreed the 4-2 ruling by the state
Supreme Court has far-reaching implications for the nation's news
organizations.
   The court rejected a jury's award of $200,000 in compensatory
damages and $500,000 in punitive damages to Dan Cohen.
   Cohen had sued the Saint Paul Pioneer Press and the Star Tribune
of Minneapolis for 1982 stories identifying him as the source of
documents showing a Democratic candidate for lieutenant governor
had been convicted of shoplifting 12 years earlier.

   President Bush's savings and loan bailout fund
will be nearly out of money if officials reach their goal of
closing or selling 77 institutions by Sept. 30, a federal agency
says.
   Figures provided Thursday by the Resolution Trust Corp.
Oversight Board indicate that, unless Congress authorizes more
borrowing, regulators could have as little as $7.3 billion in
borrowing authority left when the new federal fiscal year begins
Oct. 1.
   ``The bottom line ... (is) it would cause us to very
significantly reduce the pace of resolutions,'' said Peter Monroe,
president of the oversight board.
   In addition to the $7.3 billion, the agency could spend any
money it can get by selling repossessed real estate and sour loans
inherited from previous S&amp;L bailouts, he said.

   United Flight 232 survivors wandered
pensively about the runway where a year ago their crippled jumbo
jet cartwheeled in flames, killing 112 of 296 people aboard.
   ``I want to see it without bodies and luggage and airplane parts
strewn all over,'' Brad Bayless of Littleton, Colo., said during a
reunion of survivors and victims' relatives on the crash
anniversary Thursday.
   Little evidence of the crash remains. The cornfield where the
wreckage came to rest is now planted in soybeans, the torn runway
has been patched and pieces of the shattered United Air Lines DC-10
are locked away in a hangar.
   Bayless and other survivors walked around the crash site and
into another cornfield, where they picked tassels as reminders.

<HEAD>New, Moderate Left Develops in Latin America</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEN SILVERSTEIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Moderate socialists are taking
over from Latin America's doctrinaire communists, who were cast
adrift when Eastern Europe threw out the old guard and the Moscow
line was reeled in.
   Reform leftists say old models of socialism, based on such
principles as one-party rule and state control of the entire
economy, have become obsolete.
   ``That has created a tremendous shock for those of us who
considered the past Soviet model to be a basic reference,'' said
Luis Maira, a leading Chilean intellectual and member of a
Christian Marxist group.
   Leftist guerrilla movements, common in the region 20 years ago,
have all but disappeared. Only Peru, El Salvador and Guatemala have
significant insurgent groups, and U.S. fears of Cuban-inspired
revolutions have gone the way of the Cold War.
   ``The left is a thing of the past,'' said Guerino Andreoni, an
Argentine labor leader. ``Ideologically, it expresses a feeling we
all share, but structurally it has remained stagnant.''
   Parties in the old Soviet style got no more than 7 percent of
the vote, and usually far less, in elections held over the last few
years in Argentina, Venezuela, Colombia, Peru, Paraguay, Ecuador,
Brazil, Chile, Mexico and Bolivia.
   Left-of-center parties are springing up to carry the banner of
the new, moderate socialism.
   ``The socialist models in Eastern Europe fell because they were
centralized, bureaucractic and authoritarian,'' said Roger Capella
Mateo, treasurer of Causa R, a Venezuelan party founded in 1983. It
won three seats in the national congress last year.
   ``Our party anticipated perestroika by creating a grass-roots
socialist model from the bottom up and not the other way around,''
he said, referring to the reform program of Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   In Colombia, former guerrilla leader Antonio Navarro finished
third in this year's presidential election. He described his M-19
party, named for his former guerrilla group, as nationalist and
committed to ``democratic capitalism.''
   Leftist parties received 23 percent of the vote in the 1989
Chilean congressional elections. That was a decline from 40 percent
in the 1970 election, the last free vote before the 1973 coup that
overthrew President Salvador Allende, an avowed Marxist.
   Chile's Socialist Party, which got most of the left's vote last
year, espouses moderate views similar to the Social Democrats of
Western Europe.
   Only Nicaragua, Brazil, Mexico and Uruguay have well-entrenched
leftist political movements.
   Nicaragua's Sandinista movement was voted out of office in
February after more than 11 years in power, but is a strong force
in opposition to the government of President Violeta Barrios de
Chamorro.
   In Brazil, Luis Inacio Lula da Silva of the Workers Party
coalition of trade unionists, members of the progressive wing of
the Roman Catholic Church and intellectuals, fell just short of
defeating conservative Fernando Collor de Mello in the December
presidential election.
   A Mexican ``new left'' was born during the 1988 presidential
campaign when leftist parties formed an unprecedented alliance to
back Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, who ran a strong second to Carlos Salinas
de Gortari, candidate of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary
Party.
   Socialist and other leftist parties in Uruguay, allied in the
Broad Front, won 21 percent of the vote in elections last year.
Luis Alberto Lacalle, a conservative, won the presidency, but Broad
Front candidate Tabare Vazquez became mayor of Montevideo, the
capital.
   Many traditional Communist parties have suffered major
defections in the past year.
   ``The Communist Party will no doubt continue to exist, but will
have no future to speak of, since it continues to suppress ideas,''
said Angelino Carzon, head of a major Colombian labor union. He
quit the party in April.
   In several other countries, liberal Communists inspired by
Gorbachev have either taken control of the parties or are trying to
do so.
   Sen. Jaime Perez, leader of the Uruguayan Communists, said the
collapse of communism in Eastern Europe took his party by surprise.
   ``We believed those regimes were consolidated, but reality has
shown the parties were isolated from the people,'' he said.
   Despite their more moderate approach, Latin America's new
leftists remain convinced capitalism is largely responsible for the
region's inequities and still put much of the blame on the United
States.
   They see President Bush's recent call for increased economic
integration in the hemisphere as an attempt to dominate Latin
economies.
   ``His plan would submit our economies to the control of foreign
capital and governments,'' said Joao Machado of the Workers Party
in Brazil.
   Deciding what they are for seems more difficult for leaders of
the new left than declaring what they are against.
   Socialists speak of a major redistribution of wealth, agrarian
reform and stopping payments on the region's $400 billion foreign
debt, but offer few specific plans.
   ``The position of the left based on its traditional discourse .
.. has been completely weakened; unfortunately, the left has not
come up with an alternative discourse,'' said Herbert Mueller, a
Bolivian political consultant.
   Some signposts have emerged.
   Leftist reformers have expressed a commitment to Western-style
elections, which old-guard Communists scorned as ``bourgeois
democracy.''
   ``We have to denounce the crimes of Eastern Europe, the crimes
of the gulag and the lack of liberty,'' said Rep. Jose Genoino, a
former guerrilla who fought Brazil's military governments of
1964-1985.
   Prominent socialists have even urged Fidel Castro to hold direct
elections in Cuba.
   While leftists still seek a substantial role for the state, many
say they also favor a role for private enterprise.
   ``Contemporary socialism doesn't sanctify the state or the
market and looks for an equilibrium,'' said Sen. Enrique Bernales
of the Socialist Left, a reformist Peruvian party. ``These days, we
can't reject the similiarities with social democracy.''
   Some leftists have shown an openness to foreign investment,
which previously was considered a threat to national sovereignty.
   In the Brazilian presidential campaign last year, da Silva said
foreign companies offered better conditions to workers than
Brazilian firms.
   ``Foreign capital has to come to Brazil,'' he said. ``The only
restriction we make is there has to be greater control.''
   Even hard-liners recognize the need for change.
   ``Socialism has lost a battle because it underestimated the
importance of democracy,'' said Patricio Echegaray, head of the
Argentine Communist Party, which followed the Moscow line
faithfully.

   While movie theaters on the main
drag play the loud and violent films of summer, a quiet, gentle
show called ``Pageant of the Masters'' is doing turn-away business
a few blocks away.
   This annual stage spectacle, coupled with a colorful art
festival, is such a box-office hit that it needs no help from the
National Endowment for the Arts. Instead, it will be giving money
back to the community which plays host to this cultural jewel.
   ``As far as I know, this is the only town that is paid by the
arts,'' said Jacquie Moffett, president of the Festival of the
Arts, who noted that the city of Laguna Beach receives about
$300,000 a year from the seven-week art extravaganza which runs
from July through Aug. 26.
   ``We're a non-profit organization and we do make money,'' she
said, explaining why much of the income from admission tickets is
given away both to the city and in scholarships to talented
residents.
   The Pageant of the Masters, centerpiece of the Laguna Beach Art
Festival, is an outdoor two-hour production in which great
paintings, sculpture and even pieces of jewelry are reproduced
larger than life size on a carefully lit stage.
   If the people in these art works appear lifelike, it's because
they are real people. The concept of ``living pictures,'' once an
entertainment of the French court, first came to Laguna Beach 58
years ago. Residents, their faces and bodies painted and costumed,
pose in exact duplicates of famous works of art.
   In an outdoor bowl under the stars, these frozen images are
accompanied by lyrical music and narration which tells the history
of the art work on view.
   With advanced makeup and lighting techniques, it's often hard to
tell that living, breathing individuals are wearing the paint and
costumes of the scene, standing without visibly blinking or
breathing.
   ``They are taught a shallow method of breathing, and you really
can't see them breathe,'' said Sally Reeve, longtime public
relations director for the festival who used to appear in the
pageant herself.
   ``Staying still is stressed above everything,'' said Moffett,
noting that this year's show features several small children who
managed to not move a muscle.
   Sometimes the performers' ability to stand still is severely
tested.
   ``Once a pigeon came and landed on a nude,'' Moffett recalls.
``She just stood there like she was a statue.''
   Because the show is held outdoors, she said, there's the added
problem of insects which sometimes land and get stuck in a
performer's makeup.
   ``That's particularly difficult if it's one of the nudes,'' she
said.
   The pageant is an all-year project for Laguna Beach residents
who not only perform but help select the works to be depicted. A
staff of ``detectives'' searches out the owners of paintings or
sculptures to obtain permission for its use in the Pageant of the
Masters.
   Moffett's own children appeared in the pageant in their younger
years. Community participation increases every year, she said,
noting, ``Everyone likes to be part of a success.''
   As for audiences, many of them are perpetual fans.
   ``A lot of people love the show and come back every year,''
Moffett said. ``They are probably the same people who don't like to
watch car chases in movies.'' The people who do like car chases,
she concedes, find the pageant ``too static.''
   Moffett, an artist who has exhibited on the grounds of the art
festival for 23 years, noted that many Laguna Beach resident
artists support themselves on the works they sell during the summer
festival. The juried show selects the most talented members of the
resort's huge art colony to exhibit here. Last year, one painting
shown on the grounds sold for $15,000.
   Some of those who do not win admission to the festival show
their works across the road at two commercial exhibits, the Sawdust
and the Art A-Fair which cater to tourists and those wanting a less
costly art souvenir.
   The Festival of Arts-Pageant of the Masters is the only
non-profit exhibition in town. Its success is measured by the
creation this season of the Festival of Arts Foundation, started
with $1.5 million in festival money.
   The tax-exempt foundation will provide funding for the arts in
Laguna Beach, including scholarships and grants to cultural
institutions. Its first grants went to such groups as the Laguna
Beach Chamber Music Society, the Laguna Playhouse and the Art
Institute of Southern California.
   Moffett hopes that future plans will include construction of
artist studios and residences for those unable to afford pricey
real estate in this beach-front community.
   ``Some artists move here just to be part of the festival,'' she
said. ``But lately some have had to move away because it's such an
expensive place to live.''

   It's a summer school like no other.
   Students immerse themselves in the works of Duke, Bird and
Miles. The ``dean'' of faculty once cavorted with Cab, swung with
Count and be-bopped with Dizzy.
   Since 1988, the Skidmore Summer Jazz Institute has brought six
renowned jazz artists and professors to Skidmore College to teach
and play that most of American of music.
   No more than 40 musicians ranging in age from 14 to 50-something
pay $1,000 each to spend two weeks eating, sleeping, playing and
talking jazz with such prominent figures as Milt ``The Judge''
Hinton, considered the elder statesmen of jazz bassists.
   ``He's jazz history walking around here,'' said Buddy Baker,
another faculty member. ``You're getting it from the guy who lived
it.''
   The Skidmore Summer Jazz Institute, held this year from June 25
through July 6, is unique because it places such importance on the
history of jazz and not on the ``hot, new young players,'' Baker
said.
   On the institute's fourth day, music filters through the walls
of the Janet Kinghorn Bernhard Theater, where 36 students divided
into five groups rehearse in separate rooms.
   In one studio, a teen-ager with shaggy blond hair slides his
fingers up and down a stand-up bass while his combo of high school
students works through a tune. He wears black pants and a black
T-shirt decorated with white skulls. An earring protrudes from one
nostril.
   Nearby, The Judge listens intently, then passes down his
sentence.
   ``OK, let's try it again,'' says Hinton, a bouncy 80-year-old
who brings six decades of jazz experience to Skidmore.
   T-shirts, sneakers and shorts are the uniform of the day. Two
teen-agers in Hinton's morning class wear their baseball caps
backward. Hinton, keeping with the casual theme, wears blue slacks,
white polo shirt, sneakers, maroon chintz jacket and golf cap.
   He nods toward the blond bassist, a ``very avant-garde dude''
who gave up his electric guitar for the acoustic bass. The tune
ends, and Hinton is quick to praise.
   ``That's much better, Mike, much better,'' he says.
   Another bass player steps in, this one a tall, skinny teen in a
New York Mets T-shirt. As the boy's long fingers pluck out a
throaty bass line, Hinton nods his head in satisfaction.
   ``He's really going to make it,'' he says.
   Hinton knows about making it.
   The son of a Chicago music teacher, he gave up the violin for
the bass after the introduction of talking motion pictures in 1929
put him and many other musicians playing in silent movie theaters
out of work.
   ``A string is a string, so I traded a small string for a big
string,'' Hinton said.
   In 1935, he signed on with Cab Calloway's band and stayed with
the flamboyant bandleader until the early 1950s. ``Cab Calloway
borrowed me for a while. He borrowed me until he could get to New
York and get a good bass player _ and I stayed in his band for 16
years.''
   Afterward came stints with Count Basie and Louis Armstrong.
Along the way he accompanied everyone from Duke Ellington and Paul
McCartney to Billie Holliday and Aretha Franklin. He uses his
experiences, along with some of the tens of thousands of
photographs he snapped over the years, to teach younger generations
the joys of jazz.
   The idea for the institute came from Don McCormack, dean of
special programs at Skidmore. McCormack envisioned a program that
would allow budding jazz musicians to play with and learn from some
of the best in the business. He took his idea to Jerry Zaffuts,
then a jazz instructor at Skidmore, now director of the institute.
   Zaffuts put together an all-star faculty that could handle a
classroom as well as a C note. Except for Vince DiMartino, who
could not attend last year, the faculty has been the same since the
institute began three years ago.
   In addition to Hinton, the faculty includes: Ed Shaughnessy,
drummer; Don Menza, a Grammy-nominated saxophonist; Dick Katz, a
pianist, record producer and jazz historian; Baker, a former
trombonist with the Stan Kenton and Woody Herman bands, now a
professor the University of North Colorado; and DiMartino, a
trumpet player who also teaches trumpet and jazz at the University
of Kentucky.
   Guest artists such as pianist Barry Harris and bassist Rufus
Reid give master classes.
   The faculty's impressive resumes aren't lost on the students.
   ``It's like having Einstein prove his theory to you while you're
sitting there,'' said Joel Mott, a 19-year-old trumpet player from
Oklahoma City.
   Most of the applications come from high school and college
students, although this year's group included a dentist, engineer,
state trooper and quite a few music teachers.
   Each applicant must submit an audition tape and each undergoes a
live audition once they arrive at Skidmore. The students then are
formed into bands based on their ability. Their stay is highlighted
by the two free concerts they perform at the Bernhard Theater.
   In the morning, the faculty works with the bands in rehearsals.
Later, students get one-on-one lessons with the faculty member
specializing in their instrument.
   ``Everybody has a really good attitude about trying to give a
lot to the kids. Nobody just puts in their time,'' Shaughnessy said.
   Good jazz musicians don't always make good jazz teachers, said
Shaughnessy, who has performed more than 600 lecture-clinics at
high schools and colleges across the nation.
   Jazz clubs used to be the training ground for aspiring
musicians. But except for such jazz hotspots as New York and New
Orleans, jazz clubs are few and far between.
   ``I really got my education in those clubs. I listened to all
the greatest drummers. I watched them for hours,'' said
Shaughnessy, who as a teen-ager in the 1950s frequented the famed
jazz clubs that lined New York City's 52nd Street.
   The problem today is finding serious jazz musicians with whom to
play, many of the students said. The institute gives them that
opportunity.
   Often, the advice Shaughnessy and the others offer can't be
found in a text book.
   ``I was telling a quitar player, `don't try to play so many
notes when you improvise. Play more spare,''' Shaughnessy said.
``He says to me afterward, `you know, that's just what I needed.'
That's a bit of street advice.''
   Teaching also takes place in the classroom. In Katz's history of
jazz class, students delve into its origins and changes, listening
to classic recordings of such greats as Earl Hines, Armstrong and
Miles Davis. Hinton also conducts a class, a kind of eyewitness
account of the golden age of jazz peppered with names such as
Calloway, Armstrong and Basie.
   ``Those people seem fictitious until you talk to Milt,'' said
Mott.
   But the faculty does more than teach. They perform three times
during the two weeks, once at the Newport Jazz Festival in Saratoga
Springs, and twice for free at Skidmore, where it's standing-room
only for the group's electrifying concerts.
   For Hinton, the institute is more than an opportunity to bring
the jazz club to the jazz student. ``It's our responsibility to be
sure to give them something, something that they can leave here
with.''

   Today is Sunday, July 22, the 203rd day of 1990. There are 162
days left in the year.
   Today's highlight in history:
   One hundred years ago, on July 22, 1890, Rose Fitzgerald
Kennedy, matriarch of one of America's most politically prominent
families, was born in Boston.
   On this date:
   In 1587, a second English colony _ also fated to vanish under
mysterious circumstances _ was established on Roanoke Island off
North Carolina.
   In 1796, Cleveland, Ohio, was founded by Gen. Moses Cleaveland.
   In 1812, English troops under the Duke of Wellington defeated
the French at the Battle of Salamanca in Spain.
   In 1844, Anglican clergyman William Archibald Spooner _ whose
habit of transposing words or parts of words while speaking
resulted in the term ``spoonerisms'' _ was born in London.
   In 1916, a bomb went off during a Preparedness Day parade in San
Francisco, killing 10 people.
   In 1933, American aviator Wiley Post completed the first solo
flight around the world in 7 days, 18 hours and 45 minutes.
   In 1934, bank robber John Dillinger was shot to death by federal
agents outside Chicago's Biograph Theater.
   In 1937, the Senate rejected President Franklin D. Roosevelt's
proposal to add more justices to the U.S. Supreme Court.
   In 1942, gasoline rationing began in the United States during
World War II.
   In 1943, Allied forces captured Palermo, Sicily.
   In 1975, the U.S. House of Representatives joined the Senate in
voting to restore the American citizenship of Confederate Gen.
Robert E. Lee, more than a century after his death.
   In 1981, Turkish extremist Mehmet Ali Agca was sentenced in a
Rome court to life in prison for shooting Pope John Paul II.
   Ten years ago: Ali Akbar Tabatabai, an exiled opponent of Iran's
revolutionary government, was shot to death at his home in
Bethesda, Md., by a gunman disguised as a postal worker.
   Five years ago: The Reagan administration issued a statement
blaming apartheid for being ``largely responsible for the current
violence'' in South Africa, but stopping short of criticizing the
government's declaration of a state of emergency.
   One year ago: Nearly 200,000 Palestinian children returned to
classrooms in the West Bank after the Israeli army lifted an order
that had kept their schools closed for most of the Palestinian
uprising, or ``intefadeh.''
   Today's birthdays: Rose Kennedy is 100. Sen. William Roth
(R-Del.) is 69. Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) is 67.
Singer Margaret Whiting is 66. Actor-comedian Orson Bean is 62.
Fashion designer Oscar de la Renta is 58. Actor Terence Stamp is
50. Game show host Alex Trebek is 50. Actor-singer Bobby Sherman is
45. Actor-comedian-director Albert Brooks is 43.
   Thought for today: ``I have always believed that God never gives
a cross to bear larger than we can carry. ... No matter what, God
wants us to be happy. He doesn't want us to be sad. Birds sing
after a storm. Why shouldn't we?'' _ Rose Kennedy (1890- ).

<HEAD>TNT's `Rising Son:' Convincing Portrait of a Family in Crisis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The urge to run away and hide, or at least
cringe, at the prospect of a television ``family drama'' usually is
justified.
   Television, after all, gave us ``Eight is Enough'' when four or
five of them would have been too many.
   Most TV scriptwriters don't seem to understand the drama of
families. They give us the unrelenting bummer of ``Family'' or
Huxtables-gone-bad or headline demons so disfiguringly evil as to
be unrecognizable as human.
   Happily, that's not true of ``Rising Son,'' a made-for-TV movie
Monday night on Turner Network Television. A jewel of a cast
creates an uncompromising, remarkably intelligent portrait of a man
and his family in crisis.
   Big, bearish Brian Dennehy plays Gus, a proud, working-class
hero who's made his way up from the factory floor to production
manager. We meet him in 1981, while the demise of his ``aging,
Rustbelt factory'' looms ever nearer.
   Matt Damon plays his son Charlie, a 19-year-old who's no longer
a boy and not yet a man. He wants to drop out of pre-med studies at
Penn State and work in the factory but can't work up the nerve to
tell Dad.
   Piper Laurie, in one of her richest performances in recent
memory, plays Gus' wife, Martha. Although her part is written
small, she creates a fully realized character in every gesture and
glance.
   Dennehy has never been better, or subtler, in showing us a man
in grave trouble. When Gus's factory closes, we see his humiliation
in his stubborn refusal to adapt. His face fills with chickens
coming home to roost.
   Just like alcoholism or drug dependency, his crisis wrecks the
family's precarious equilibrium.
   The movie's producers said they wanted to create a ``kitchen
sink'' drama like those of the postwar theater, particularly Arthur
Miller's ``All My Sons'' and ``Death of a Salesman.''
   They got more than they bargained for in screenwriter Bill
Phillips' subtle, unhistrionic script and its delivery by actors
who don't need to shout to convey their emotions.
   The strong supporting cast _ especially Tate Donovan as older
brother Des and Carol Longstreth as Charlie's ex-girlfriend _ give
us immediate, life-size characters.
   Sandy Sissel's photography _ especially in the last scene, when
night steam rises from a luminous blue lake _ is beautiful. She
shows the grace and dignity in the faces of workers without
resorting to beer-commercial sentimentality.
   Gary Chang's score is unobtrusive, beautiful counterpoint to the
night moods of the film.
   Director John Coles, making his second feature film, made the
kind of movie that big studios won't do nowadays because it has no
``blockbuster'' potential, no chase scenes, and it's uncomfortably
close to real life.
   Given the poor quality of theatrical movies this summer,
``Rising Son'' is a good reason to stay home to watch a fine movie
with real characters, a believable story that says something about
life and families:
   Families are messy; they're loud, riddled with conflicts and can
be very uncomfortable; sometimes they're even crazed and
pathological; and, yes, they're often the only comfort between us
and the long, cold, dark.

   Elsewhere in television ...
   TIMESHIFTERS ALERT! DEPT.: ``P.O.V.,'' the non-fiction TV show
has proved itself one of the best bets on television this summer,
and Tuesday night it offers the first national broadcast of the
classic documentary ``Salesman.''
   ``Salesman,'' a theatrical release during the late '60s, was a
tremendous critical success. It's a black-and-white chronicle of
six weeks in the lives of Bible salesmen from Greater Boston who
are peddling a $49.95 Bible in the neighborhoods of Opa Locka,
north Miami.
   ``Salesman'' was the first feature film to use the ``direct
cinema'' style that emerged in the early '60s with the advent of
hand-held cameras synchronized with portable tape recorders.
   It was produced by the fabulous Maysles brothers, Albert and
David, whose film of the Rolling Stones' 1969 tour, ``Gimme
Shelter,'' marked the end of the '60s at the infamous concert in
Altamont, Calif.

   A hundred Japanese ignored the giant flashing video
screens around Shibuya Square and listened intently as Hank Hirsh's
alto saxophone danced around ``Sunny Side of the Street.''
   Afterward, spectators approached shyly and dropped 1,000-yen
bills, worth about $6.70 each, into his open case. Hirsh bowed,
thanked them in Japanese and launched into a jazzy ``Autumn
Leaves'' with his bassist, Fukuro Kazuya.
   ``Down on the street, I make the same money I'd make in a
regular gig, but it's much more fun,'' said Hirsh, a 39-year-old
Chicagoan who lives in Kyoto. ``I'm communicating with people. .. .
The people who like it stop and listen.''
   Hirsh, who also plays in nightclubs and teaches saxophone, said
he and Kazuya had split 340,000 yen ($2,270) in six days on the
streets of Tokyo.
   He is among hundreds of Western musicians, performance artists,
jugglers, mimes, puppeteers and street merchants drawn to Japan's
largest city by its generous tippers and relatively safe streets.
   There are risks, including gangsters who demand payoffs from
performers on their turf and an occasional belligerent drunk.
Competitors sometimes inform on each other, but police generally
leave the Westerners alone unless they create a disturbance.
   David Findlay, a mime in whiteface from Vancouver, British
Columbia, was performing on a street in the Shinjuku entertainment
area. He had a sign saying: ``I am a pantomime. Please use your
hands to move me freely.''
   ``There's no way I'd do this in Canada,'' he said. ``They'd
treat me too badly. But in Japan, there is a certain respect for
the body.''
   Giggling teen-age girls moved his arms and legs into funny
positions. Others whooped in delight when he pointed at them,
silently inviting them to participate.
   ``He is very tough,'' an admiring man said. ``We cannot do
this.''
   Findlay, 36, said foreigners ``can make incredibly good money in
Japan if they're any good. It's the fact that you're a foreigner.
If a Japanese were doing it, they'd get a different reaction.''
   Japanese do perform on the streets, but usually not for money.
   Dozens of rock bands play side-by-side on a crowded street near
Yoyogi Park. Teen-agers in greased-back hair, black leather and
sunglasses dance to 1950s music blaring from boom boxes.
   Saxophonists, trombonists and conga players practice jazz riffs
and rhythms under bridges and in parks, but most seem to play for
the sheer joy of it.
   Many street Westerners live in rooming houses, for about $400 a
month, with other denizens of the low-end Western subculture _
teachers, writers, drifters, occasional smugglers and women who are
paid $20 an hour in nightclubs to pour drinks and talk to
businessmen.
   Western street merchants sell everything from jewelry and
mass-produced oil paintings to battery-powered pandas.
   ``I tell people I'm an art student and I painted these in Paris,
these in Hawaii,'' said a young Canadian woman selling landscapes,
seascapes and pictures of horses in Shinjuku. ``The real sad thing
is I have a degree in art history.''
   She would not give her name.
   In Harajuku, a fashionable shopping area, freelance journalist
Bill Balfour of Sheffield, England, was selling Soviet army
watches, pins and patches he bought during a reporting trip to
Sakhalin in the Soviet Union.
   He was dressed in a Soviet army uniform and his pitch was:
``Excuse me, sir, do you know what time it is in Moscow?'' People
admired the watches, but Balfour acknowledged the fad had not
caught on.
   Street Westerners say Japanese underworld gangs, known as
yakuza, demand 3,000 to 10,000 yen a week ($20 to $66), depending
on the area.
   ``It's worth it,'' Findlay said, because if a competitor ``is in
my patch, I don't have to do anything about it.''
   Other performers say the yakuza have pushed them around, kicked
their instruments, even thrown firecrackers in an effort to get a
payoff.
   Grego, a one-man band and puppeteer from Northern California,
said the yakuza once summoned police when he refused to pay.
   ``The cops said, `We're sorry, but please go home; you can come
back later','' said Grego, who asked that his last name be withheld
because he did not have a work permit.
   ``Japanese spectators stood back and watched ... but everyone
cheered when the yakuza left. They love seeing us buck the yakuza,
but they can't stick their necks out.''
   Findlay said he was performing in Shinjuku one night when a
``very large Japanese man rammed me.''
   ``Another guy stood up for me, but the big guy slammed him into
a shop door,'' he said. ``The crowd attacked the big guy, pummeled
him, kicked him in the head. ... Afterward, people shook my hand.''
   Hirsh said a bagpipe player in Ueno Park once accused Hirsh of
taking his place and brought in the police.
   ``About 500 people were waiting for us to play,'' he said.
``This one radical guy got the people together and they were booing
the police. It was a powerful thing. I was amazed to see it in
Japan.
   ``We played one tune, took in 1,500 yen ($10) and the police
escorted us to the train.''

<HEAD>Love for Music Brings Two Young Vietnamese to Refugee Camp</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WONG SAU-YING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   They fled the suffocating world of Hanoi to
pursue their love of music, and now two young Vietnamese violinists
are delighting Hong Kong with the strains of Mozart while the
colony decides whether to send them back.
   Nguyen Sam Thi, 26, and her 19-year-old brother, Nguyen Khac
Uyen, gave their first local public recital in early July, 16
months after a harrowing sea journey to this British colony to
escape their communist homeland.
   ``I don't think my performance was great. I was a bit nervous,''
Thi said after playing a Mozart violin sonata before an
appreciative lunchtime audience at the Academy for Performing Arts.
   Reviews from arts officials were much more positive. ``They've
got good technical background and good music instincts,'' said the
academy's director, John Hosier.
   ``They are both highly talented musicians with great
potential,'' said Angus Watson, head of music at the academy.
   Both believe the Vietnamese refugees would be accepted by any
top-notch conservatory.
   But musicianship is not all that the siblings have on their
minds these days. Since they are among the 44,000 boat people who
have landed in Hong Kong after June 1988, they must prove a
well-founded fear of persecution back home or face repatriation as
illegal immigrants.
   Immigration officials interviewed the two musicians last month.
A decision on whether they will be allowed to resettle in the West
has yet to be made.
   ``I'm not too sure about my future,'' a soft-spoken Uyen said
during a recent interview at the academy. ``I just keep playing my
violin, and I believe music would lead me somewhere.''
   According to the Nguyens, who spoke in English, it was their
love for music and the repeated attempts by Vietnamese authorities
to interfere in their artistic development that forced them to flee
the country.
   Both have received musical training since early childhood, first
from their father, who they said was the chief violinist with the
Vietnamese Symphony Orchestra, and then at the Hanoi Conservatory.
   Thi said she was handpicked by a team of Soviet music experts in
1981 and sent to Moscow for music studies before being suddenly
summoned back in 1985 with no explanation. Uyen said the Vietnamese
authorities nixed numerous offers for him to study in Moscow and
rejected an invitation for him to perform in Poland.
   Eventually, they said, their parents decided the children had to
escape Vietnam if they were to pursue a career in music.
   Having paid an agent gold worth more than $1,000, Thi, Uyen and
their mother boarded a 63-foot fishing junk that set sail from the
northern Vietnamese port of Bai Chay in March 1989 with 29 people
aboard. The father stayed behind and has since been fired because
of the escape, his children said.
   The group made occasional stops along the Chinese coast to take
on food supplies and for repairs. After about 20 days, the boat
reached Hong Kong's shores.
   ``It may seem silly to other people that I took along my violin
during the dangerous journey to Hong Kong, but the instrument is my
most valuable property,'' Uyen said.
   Thi stressed that they intended to continue practicing as soon
as they reached the territory. ``Music has become part of us.
Wherever we go, whatever situation we're in, we continue to play.''
   At first, the youths practiced daily at a laundry hut in a
detention center in rural Hong Kong. But the official in charge of
the camp quickly appreciated their talent and a battle followed to
provide Thi and Uyen with proper musical training.
   They have since been granted special permission to live with a
local German woman and her American husband during the week to
practice at the academy. On weekends, they are sent back behind the
imposing fences of the High Island detention center, where they
live in cramped bungalows with thousands of other boat people.
   The two violinists say they would gladly go to any country
willing to offer them refuge.
   Uyen dreams of becoming a soloist and composer, while his
sister's goal is to play with an orchestra.
   ``Let us wait and see. We need to practice, but we are hopeful
all the time,'' Thi said.

<DATELINE>MANSFIELD, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Laura Ingalls Wilder was 65 when at the
urging of her daughter, author Rose Wilder Lane, she began writing
her memories of pioneer life on the virgin prairie.
   At a desk in a tiny room in the Ozarks home she shared with her
husband, Almanzo, Wilder crafted ``Little House on the Prairie''
and 10 other related books that have sold millions of copies and
entertained children worldwide.
   Some mornings Almanzo would find Laura asleep on a sofa in her
study, exhausted from a night spent writing about the homesteading
adventures of Ma and Pa Ingalls and sisters Mary, Carrie and Grace.
   William T. Anderson has written several books about the Wilder
and Ingalls families, and when he's in the Wilders' two-story home,
nestled in woods just east of this small town, he says he almost
expects to look up and see Laura's diminutive 5-foot frame coming
through the door.
   ``It's like they've stepped out for a minute and you're walking
right in,'' said Anderson. ``Virtually everything has been
preserved in the home just as it was the day she died in 1957.''
   Rose donated the home, which took her parents nearly 20 years to
complete after arriving here from De Smet, S.D., in 1894, to the
Laura Ingalls Wilder Home Association after her mother's death at
age 90.
   In 1971, three years after Rose died at age 81, the association
dedicated a museum next to the house.
   Today about 30,000 people tour the Laura Ingalls Wilder-Rose
Wilder Lane Home and Museum each year. The museum is filled with
original artifacts familiar to fans of the ``Little House'' books
and the ``Little House on the Prairie'' television series.
   Perhaps the best known exhibit is the fiddle Pa Ingalls played
to entertain his family on the vast, lonely prairie.
   ``People sometimes are overcome with emotion when they see Pa's
fiddle because the books are so real to them,'' Anderson said.
``Coming here is like visiting close and dear relatives for a lot
of people.''
   Demoralized by four years of crop-withering drought, the death
of a newborn son and illness, Laura and Almanzo left South Dakota
hoping for a better life in Missouri's Ozarks, ``The Land of the
Big Red Apple.''
   Laura's first published article is in the museum _ a letter in
the Aug. 23, 1894, De Smet News &amp; Leader describing to folks back
home their 45-day, 650-mile journey to Mansfield in a covered wagon.
   The building also houses manuscripts of four of the ``Little
House'' books, which Laura wrote in pencil on Springfield Grocer
Co. school tablets that cost a nickel.
   The display also features a sewing cabinet Almanzo made for his
wife out of cigar boxes, family photographs and heirlooms, the
Bible Ma and Pa Ingalls gave Laura and Almanzo on their wedding day
and a nine-patch quilt made by Mary Ingalls.
   Laura named their 200-acre farm, where they lived happily for
more than a half century, Rocky Ridge Farm. She and Almanzo had a
successful livestock and poultry business and shipped fruit from
their apple and peach orchards to markets in Kansas City, St. Louis
and Memphis, Tenn.
   Almanzo, who lived to be 92, made much of the furniture in their
home, which is on the National Register of Historic Places.
Mansfield did not have a sawmill, so he and Laura cut, planed and
finished tall oaks for paneling and the living room ceiling beams.
   Laura boasted the most modern country kitchen in the Ozarks
after Almanzo piped water from a spring through their 1908
Montgomery Ward stove and into the sink for both hot and cold
running water.
   Rose Wilder Lane became an acclaimed and wealthy author,
journalist and essayist. She wrote biographies of Henry Ford and
Herbert Hoover and traveled extensively as a foreign correspondent,
including a wartime visit to Vietnam at age 79.
   In her later years, Laura lived alone at Rocky Ridge Farm but
wasn't lonely. She visited friends in Mansfield, autographed books
at bookstores into her mid-80s and answered mail from adoring fans.
   ``There is still an insatiable interest in Laura Ingalls Wilder,
all around the world,'' Anderson said. ``The `Little House' series
ended with her marriage to Almanzo. People come here because they
want to know what happened in her life after that.''

<HEAD>The 20-Year Lost Weekend: Rip Van Winkle Was a Drunk</HEAD>

   Rip Van Winkle did not sleep the sleep of
the enchanted, snoozing 20 years away in the haunted Catskill
Mountains.
   The lovable rogue of Washington Irving's story was a real man
who abandoned his wife and children to become an 18th century
barfly in New York City, claims literary detective Steven Press.
   Real or not, Rip was not so lovable, says Press, a theater
professor at Dutchess Community College in Poughkeepsie. And Rip
should be an example for today, when alcoholism is acknowledged as
a disease, and the drunk's loved ones are recognized as victims.
   It's wrong ``that we have romanticized the drunk and castigated
the woman who tries to hold the family together,'' Press says.
   True or false, Press' theory reflects society's growing sympathy
toward alcoholics, said David Musto, a professor at Yale
University's medical school. ``Even the fact that he's writing
about this and people are interested is a reflection of our
times,'' Musto says.
   In the early 1800s, heavy drinking was considered a sign of
individuality rather than a disease, says Jeffrey Hon of the
National Council on Alcoholism.
   ``In the early part of the 19th century, there was a lot more
public drunkenness,'' Hon says. ``That's what gave rise to the
temperance movement.''
   Alcohol consumption hit a peak in 1830, when average Americans
drank three times as much as they do today, said Musto, who has
studied drinking patterns of the time.
   ``When Washington Irving was writing, it was a time of enormous
alcohol consumption, for almost any purpose and at any time,''
Musto said. Alcohol was considered a food or medicine, he said.
   Alcoholism was widespread because the tavern was a community
center in those days, a lure to men with unhappy home lives such as
Rip's, Press said in an interview at his home in Poughquaq, 50
miles north of New York City.
   Press is writing two musicals based on his version of Rip's
story, passion plays sympathetic to the plight of Dame Van Winkle
and other wives abandoned by drunken husbands. Press has written
off-Broadway plays and hopes to get his musicals produced in New
York.
   Through files gathered from the Museum of the City of New York,
local libraries and other sources, Press determined Rip was born in
1727 near the Ulster County town of Gardiner. Press says he's not
sure if the name Rip Van Winkle was real or if Washington Irving
made it up. For convenience, Press uses Rip.
   At 16, Rip's father died, leaving the boy a fortune in land and
cash. The carousing Rip went on a 24-year binge and drank up his
inheritance. In the meantime, he married Dame Van Winkle _ the
she-devil of Irving's story _ and fathered two children, Judith and
Rip Jr.
   Dame Van Winkle's efforts to reform Rip failed. One day, Rip
wandered off _ and here's where Press' version differs with
Irving's story. Irving had Rip wander into the mystical Catskills,
where the ghost of explorer Henry Hudson casts him into a 20-year
sleep.
   According to Press, Rip fled home in 1767 and headed south on
the Hudson River to New York City. There, amid the Dutch taverns,
Rip lived off bar owners and patrons who came to hear his tavern
songs and stories. His long, lost weekend had begun.
   ``No one goes to sleep for 20 years,'' Press says. ``But we
certainly consider alcoholic stupor a sleep we could survive for 20
years.''
   After 20 years, Rip's daughter found him performing in a stage
show billed as ``The Old Dutcher.'' She took him home, and Rip
concocted the story of his long sleep to conceal his 20-year drunk
from neighbors.
   ``We paint an image of Rip as a wonderful guy, but that's a
terrible image,'' Press says. ``He abandoned his wife and kids. The
ogre of the story is Dame Van Winkle, the shrew who died of a heart
attack. Dame van Winkle was no ogre. She deserves to be pretty damn
angry at this guy.''
   While Rip inherited a fortune, Rip Jr. inherited his father's
drunken ways. Irving said Rip Jr. became a drunk, ``which is
interesting because of recent findings about genetic inheritance of
alcoholism,'' Press says.
   Historians and Irving scholars doubt Press' version.
   ``That's a new one on me,'' says Dan Porter, director of the New
York State Historical Association. ``He's got to have some pretty
strong evidence, because Irving dealt in fiction, not fact.''
   ``I'm sure there were people at the time who fit that pattern,''
said Robert Wells, an English professor who holds the Washington
Irving chair at Union College in Schenectady. ``There may well have
been people like Rip Van Winkle who were drunkards and were
irresponsible like that. But that's a long way from proving the man
really existed.''
   But if it was true, Irving _ a regular at the Hudson River
taverns himself _ was bound to encounter the story. Like Rip,
Irving was a sponge for both alcohol and the folk tales of the
Catskills and the Hudson Valley. Irving may even have heard the
story from Rip himself, Press says.
   Press' Rip died in 1818, when Irving was 35. Irving's ``Sketch
Book'' _ which contained ``Rip Van Winkle'' _ was published in 1819.
   ``My feeling is that Irving met him, they may have talked,''
Press says.
   Press began his search for the real Rip in the 1950s, while
studying theater at New York University. While Press was directing
Dion Boucicault's 19th century play ``Rip Van Winkle,'' a professor
told him Rip really lived and showed him papers about the Old
Dutcher.
   Rip's type _ the irresponsible boozer _ has a long tradition in
American literature. Whether he really lived and ran off to hide in
New York City's taverns doesn't matter, Press says. The fact is,
alcoholic husbands have abandoned their families in all ages, and
there were surely a few Rips among the 18th century Dutch settlers.
   ``Everybody knows that in Irving, there is always the germ of
truth,'' Press says. ``But he would put layer upon layer of fantasy
over it. We'll never know the real truth.''

<HEAD>Dow's High-Speed Run to 3,000</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also on financial wires.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If you harbor any doubts that things happen much
faster than they used to in the world of finance, consider the
recent rise of the Dow Jones industrial average to the 3,000 level.
   The familiar gauge of trends in stock market prices was more
than 100 years old before it surpassed 1,500 for the first time, on
Dec. 11, 1985.
   The next 1,500 points took less than five years, thanks to the
bull market still raging on Wall Street.
   But as impressive as that performance may look, it is partly the
result of a sort of optical illusion created by the math used to
calculate the average.
   The average that appears today in news headlines and
computerized market reporting systems is a far more complicated
entity than anything Charles Henry Dow must have had in mind when
he set out in 1884 to construct a yardstick for measuring the ups
and downs of stocks.
   Dow, co-founder of Dow Jones &amp; Co. and the first editor of the
Wall Street Journal, picked 11 stocks he deemed representative.
Befitting the makeup of the American economy in those days, nine of
his choices were railroads.
   By simply adding up the most recent prices of those stocks, and
then dividing by 11, he could figure and publish a market
``average.''
   In 1896, Dow devised an average of industrial stocks, separate
from the railroads, with 12 components. It was expanded to 20 in
1916 and 30 in 1928.
   As ``the Dow'' evolved, it also had to change its membership
roster at intervals to keep up with changes in the American
business scene.
   Early component stocks such as Pacific Mail Steamship, Central
Leather and Standard Rope &amp; Twine yielded in time to the likes of
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, International Business Machines,
Exxon and other of today's corporate giants.
   Amid all this activity, a continuous average could not be
calculated without making adjustments in the formula.
   So the number used as the average's divisor was changed, not
only every time the number of stocks was increased or one was
substituted for another, but also whenever a stock split occurred.
   Instead of 30, the divisor shrank by stages to about 10 in 1949,
less than two in 1969, and on downward to about 0.5 today.
   In a straight average, a rise of $1 each in the price of all the
component stocks would produce a one-point increase. With today's
divisor, by contrast, gains of $1 apiece in the components would
raise the average about 60 points.
   That has given rise to complaints from some observers that the
average overstates the volatility of today's stock market.
   Other critics say no sample of 30 stocks can accurately
represent what happens to investors in more than 1,600 issues
traded on the New York Stock Exchange and many thousands more
bought and sold in the various other U.S. markets.
   When professional investors compare the results they achieve
against a market measure, they seldom use the Dow, but refer
instead to a broader alternative like Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock
composite index.
   Still, in news reports and conversations at all levels of the
economy, the industrial average continues to fill the role for
which it was created, as a shorthand symbol of ``the market.''
   It stands, wrote Victor J. Hillery in a 1986 book on the Dow's
history, as ``the most widely recognized measure of the stock
market's gyrations.''

   Some of America's highest-paid athletes are
squaring off without benefit of shoulder pads in high-profile bids
to win another kind of game.
   The line between show business and sports blurred long ago, but
the proliferation of National Football League players bullying
their way through the television and movie landscape may be at an
all-time high.
   Former players such as Jim Brown, Joe Namath, Lyle Alzado, John
Matuszak, Merlin Olsen, Ed Marinaro and Alex Karras achieved
varying degrees of acting success. Mostly though, their roles came
in low-budget party flicks or TV series.
   Indianapolis Colts placekicker Dean Biasucci is out to change
that trend. The Pro Bowl kicker wants an acting career in the most
serious of theatrical forms, the stage.
   Earlier this summer, Biasucci completed his role as Marc Antony
in the Indiana Repertory Theatre's production of ``Julius Caesar.''
Michael Gross of TV's ``Family Ties'' headed the cast.
   ``I've been playing football since I was 9 years old, and it's
just so natural to me. Acting is becoming more comfortable to me,''
Biasucci said. ``After close games, I'm mentally exhausted. After
you give a good performance, you're that way, too.''
   Tackling Shakespeare was scarier to Biasucci than getting rushed
by a bunch of burly defensive linemen.
   ``I was kind of afraid of it because I'd never done it before. I
didn't start getting a hold of the Marc Anthony thing until two
weeks into the role,'' he said. ``Now I feel like I can be good.
You know when you have it.''
   The 27-year-old shared a dressing room with veteran stage actor
Michael Lipton (``Caesar and Cleopatra,'' ``Sleuth,'' ``Separate
Tables''), who played the title role of the fallen Roman leader.
   ``As Anthony, I said to him nothing will be as difficult to you
again. He's got guts, he's a very talented young man,'' Lipton
said. ``At the moment, he has a wonderful honesty on the stage and
he's simple. He certainly has the actor's gene.''
   Biasucci's passion for acting erupted when he took a drama class
during his sophomore year at Western Carolina University in
Cullowhee, N.C.
   ``I was going to major in business like everyone else. I took an
acting class and it was fun. I decided I may as well do something I
like,'' said Biasucci, who acted in about 10 college plays while on
a football scholarship.
   His thesis analyzed Arthur Kopit's ``The End of the World,''
which had a brief run on Broadway in 1984. Early in his pro career
he returned to do summer stock at Western Carolina.
   With his muscular build and dark looks, Biasucci seemingly would
be a natural for lucrative commercials. Instead, he is pursuing
roles in low-profile local productions.
   He made his professional debut last season in the Indiana
Repertory Theatre's production of Luigi Pirandello's ``Six
Characters in Search of an Author'' and drew favorable notices for
his portrayal of the angry son. This time, critics praised him for
his handling of Antony's funeral oration, but criticized his
monotone voice.
   ``At first my plan was to be in the NFL for four years and then
I could act. Now I want to play longer and I want to still pursue a
career as an actor,'' said Biasucci, who is looking for an agent.
   His goal is simple: ``To be a well-respected actor where you
have steady work and you call the shots; that's probably all any
actor wants.''
   But for now, he must sandwich his love for acting around his
meaty football career. He's been with the Colts since 1985.
   Biasucci's summer acting stint ends Thursday when he's due in
training camp. His current contract is up for renegotiation. On the
off-chance he doesn't reach agreement, Biasucci could return to the
footlights earlier than he planned.
   ``It's a disadvantage to doing one show a year because you're
just getting the rust off for the first two weeks. When my football
career is over, that will change,'' he said.
   Despite his success on the field, Biasucci prefers the nightly
polite applause of a small theater audience to the once-a-week
roars of 60,000 fans at Colts games.
   ``If I could only do one, I think I would act. As an actor, you
have a script. You're using your imagination to create their voices
and their actions. You have to have a creative mind.''
   But he still battles the stereotype of a dumb jock who knows his
sport and little else.
   ``They say, `He's not going to be that good.' They say, `He's
another one of those football players trying to act,' and I'm
fighting it all the way,'' Biasucci said.
   He has plenty of company in his suffering.
   Brian Bosworth, whose career as a Seattle Seahawks linebacker
has been cut short by shoulder injuries, currently is shooting a
$10 million movie in Florida called ``The Brotherhood.'' He plays
an FBI agent seeking to stop a political assassination by a
motorcycle gang.
   ``I see in him Marlon Brando, James Dean and Gary Cooper, all
rolled in one package. He's got the same appeal of a Stallone or
Schwarzenegger,'' director Bruce Malmuth enthuses.
   Former Los Angeles defensive end Fred Dryer recently completed
his seventh season in the television cop series ``Hunter.''
   ``You have to kill that football guy off because he can't help
you,'' Dryer has said in a published interview. ``The mistake a lot
of athletes have made is they don't get rid of that guy. They march
that ego, their fame, their name right in there and they expect to
be given work because they are famous football players.''
   Biasucci shudders at such shoot 'em up examples: ``I don't want
to do anything stupid.''
   He is the exception rather than the rule among his acting peers.
NFL kickers earned an average salary of $240,000 in 1989, which
explains why Biasucci squirmed slightly as other members of the
``Julius Caesar'' cast worried aloud about their next job. He
performed for free.
   Lipton began his career 42 years ago on Broadway, and says he
thinks he understands the lure of an acting career to an athlete.
   ``Since their careers are so tenuous, they miss a lot of that
hoopla. They miss the commercials and going on the road. They're
like big kids,'' Lipton said.
   Biasucci says the challenge of translating a script into
riveting dialogue equals the thrill of successfully executing a
move from the Colts' playbook.
   ``You can act until you're 75 and never stop learning. You're
always finding new things even in one particular show,'' he said.
   ``I've got a long way to go. I started late, but I don't think
that's going to hurt me too much.''

<HEAD>Jackson Seeks New Political Role as `Shadow' Senator</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   WASHINGTON (AP _ When Jesse Jackson describes his career plans,
he says he is running for U.S. senator from the District of
Columbia. There's no such office, but he thinks there should be.
   Jackson actually is running for shadow senator _ an unpaid
lobbyist post for D.C. statehood. The crusade has been a magnet for
scorn and skepticism.
   He's been labeled ``His Shadowship'' by one acerbic commentator
and deemed increasingly irrelevant by another. Futile play-acting,
some say. A phony job when he could have had a real one. Outdated
protest politics outside the mainstream. The kiss of death for a
third presidential bid.
   ``There's a certain contempt factor in high places,'' Jackson
allows. It doesn't discourage him or dim his customary eloquence.
   ``Why D.C. statehood? Why not mayor?'' he asked last week at a
gathering of Democratic women. ``Because my life commitment is to
expand democracy. My quest is not employment. It's empowerment.''
   Later, he says no one expected Lech Walesa or Nelson Mandela to
settle for jobs within the oppressive systems they were trying to
change.
   The district is an occupied zone with its single non-voting
House delegate and limited authority over its own affairs, he says.
It's humiliating to have to grab senators in hallways and plead for
help, he says bitterly _ ``running around as if we had on waiters'
outfits, waiting to get what was left over from the dinner.''
   There's no question that Jackson feels strongly about D.C.
statehood, makes the case well and will win one of the district's
two shadow senator slots in November.
   Yet his choice _ so soon after the electoral triumphs of
Virginia Gov. Douglas Wilder and New York Mayor David Dinkins, so
soon after shunning the D.C. mayoral race _ has puzzled many.
   ``The ultimate political irony of 1990 could be the election of
Jackson to that artificial position at the same time that former
Charlotte Mayor Harvey Gantt is being elected to a real seat in the
U.S. Senate,'' columnist Mark Shields wrote recently.
   ``The mayor's job is a real job. To avoid that and run for a
phony lobbyist's job ... shows you're interested in playing protest
politics and not mainstream real politics,'' said Al From,
executive director of the conservative-leaning Democratic
Leadership Council.
   Jackson says his support for D.C. statehood, part of the
Democratic platform, is ``mainstream Democratic Party politics.''
   Challenge his relevance and he mentions the 7 million votes he
got in his 1988 presidential bid. He cites a recent poll that shows
him the front-running Democrat for 1992. He talks of the hundreds
who come to hear him speak, the unmet needs of the poor and
downtrodden.
   ``Public servants are relevant as long as people need public
service,'' he says.
   Yet some observers see Jackson's influence waning with the rise
of black politicians like Wilder, North Carolina's Gantt and
Georgia gubernatorial candidate Andrew Young.
   ``They seem to be eclipsing him as spokesmen for a broader
political movement. They're not just black politicians and
increasingly it seems to me that he is,'' said Stuart Rothenberg,
editor and publisher of The Political Report.
   Jackson argues it is racist to compare him to other black
politicians and resists the suggestion he is the candidate of only
one group.
   He still talks of rainbow coalitions, including one for D.C.
statehood. He sees this mission as a logical extension of his other
efforts to ``expand democracy'' _ registering voters, organizing
workers, protesting apartheid, pushing for new domestic priorities
like urban reinvestment.
   Many agree the shadow senator job is compatible with Jackson's
work, aims and personality. He can keep traveling, promoting his
causes, earning his living, moving ahead with a syndicated
television show scheduled to debut in September.
   And while analysts don't think statehood will expand his base,
most don't see him losing support over the issue, either.
   But can he get any respect? Will he be taken seriously?
   ``It's unlikely that anyone's going to call him Senator
Jackson,'' said Linda Williams, a black politics specialist at
Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government. ``It's going to be
extremely difficult for him to be seen as an elected official ...
much less a senator. He's really got a hard sale.''
   But Ann Lewis, an adviser to Jackson's 1988 campaign, said
Jackson has always made the most of his opportunities and ``if
anybody can make the job work, he can do it.''
   At least six states _ Tennessee, Michigan, California,
Minnesota, Oregon and Alaska _ sent shadow senators to Washington
before they became states, according to the Senate historian's
office. The first and last to be granted access to the floor of the
Senate were the Tennesseans, in 1796.
   ``That's precedent,'' said Jackson, who is seeking the same
privileges for the two D.C. shadows. Counters From: ``It's a
terrible precedent to let a lobbyist pretend he's a senator.''
   When it became clear that D.C. Mayor Marion Barry was going to
be preoccupied with his drug and perjury trial, many looked to
Jackson to run for mayor. He could heal the city, they said. He
could gain experience in an elective office.
   Had Jackson gone that route, Democrats would not now be
wondering how to handle this formidable ``shadow.'' And to the
relief of party moderates and conservatives, he would have been
otherwise engaged during the 1992 presidential race.
   But Jackson has never bowed to or become part of the party or
any other institution. And so he is still at large, seemingly
everywhere _ marching with strikers in Las Vegas, organizing
textile and chicken workers in the South, protesting the savings
and loan bailout in Chicago, welcoming Mandela in Washington,
exhorting Democrats in Iowa and Indiana.
   What he'll be doing in 1992, he won't say.

<DATELINE>VIENTIANE, Laos (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While other Asian nations work around the
clock in quest of prosperity, residents of Vientiane still take
midday siestas and jealously guard their weekends.
   Vientiane, never the briskest of capitals, virtually came to a
halt after the Communists took over in 1975.
   Although people who live here say things have picked up in
recent years, children play in the dry fountain of a central plaza
and tethered goats munch the tall grass. Nearby, chickens and
turkeys peck in the muddy compounds of government ministries.
   Japanese vehicles are replacing old Soviet and French models,
but traffic remains sparse. Offices close for lunch from 11.30 a.m.
until 2 p.m. and weekends are reserved for family and friends.
   Since 1986, the government has pursued Western-style reforms in
one of the world's poorest economies, relaxing rigid policies that
caused businessmen and tens of thousands of other Laotians to flee
the country.
   Political reform is nowhere in sight, however, and diplomats
note that relations between Laos and China, its huge, hard-line
northern neighbor, have become especially cordial.
   The Chinese merchant class is re-emerging in Vientiane and new
small enterprises have sprouted, but there is none of the urgency
seen in such other Southeast Asian countries as booming Thailand,
just across the Mekong River.
   ``Asia's full of dynamism, but that's not Laos,'' a Western
development expert said, speaking anonymously. ``I think that, in
the long term, it will remain a unique case, more like an African
country than an Asian one.''
   Officials acknowledge much needs to be done to develop the
country, but their watchwords are ``step by step.''
   No significant manufacturing base has been created, despite 15
years of aid from Moscow and Eastern Europe, and help more recently
from Japan, Sweden, Australia and other Western countries. The
annual per capita income is less than $170.
   Officials blame the malaise on the incentive-numbing central
planning of the past and on inefficient use of aid from communist
allies.
   One program sent 50 Laotians to the Soviet Union to become
railroad engineers, a Western diplomat said. Laos has no railroad.
   Trade is hampered by lack of direct access to the sea and by
derelict road and telephone systems. The nation's 4 million people
are spread over an area the size of Britain and most educated
Laotions have fled.
   Infant mortality is among the world's highest, 200 per 1,000
births in some areas. Vannaret Rajaprop, vice minister of health,
said it ``is a very important problem for us. We need the labor and
manpower for development.''
   Among the country's assets are rich supplies of timber and
minerals.
   Analysts say the unspoiled countryside and tropical climate
provide great potential for tourism, but the government shows no
enthusiasm for foreigners. It eliminated the drug culture and
prostitution that attracted Western ``hippies'' before 1975, and
now limits the number of visitors.
   Vientiane has few hotels. In Phone Savane, a town on the
legendary Plain of Jars, the only hotel is made of moldering
plywood.
   When an aging Soviet Antonov aircraft crashed on landing late in
1989, Laos was left with only five domestic passenger planes.
Officials say they haven't enough money to replace the Antonov.
   In hopes of obtaining foreign cash to fill some of the gaps, the
National Assembly recently passed laws intended to increase
investor confidence. The first Laotian constitution is to be
adopted by December.
   An estimated $80 million has been pledged from abroad for future
projects, but diplomats say most is from small companies in
Thailand. Some predict there will be no major investment without
political change.
   ``There have been a lot of new words, but people see the same
old faces responsible for past conservative policies,'' a Western
development worker said. ``Some refreshing at high levels might
convince people there are some real changes going on.''
   Kaysone Phomvihane, 69, has led the Communist Party since 1955
and has been premier since it gained power.
   Somphavan Inthawong, a member of the National Assembly and the
senior economic planner, said the government's priority was to
raise living standards, not reform the political structure.
   ``We should not think about building a rocket to go to the moon
when we are one of the world's 10 least developed countries,'' he
said. ``Questions that are relevant in other countries might not be
relevant in our society at the moment.''
   Diplomats said some intellectuals privately favor a multiparty
system and some journalists want relaxation of the rigid press
controls, but no organized political opposition is evident.

<DATELINE>HO CHI MINH TRAIL, Laos (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Just off a red clay track beside
the sparkling Tchepone River is the reborn hamlet of Ban Dong Nai,
which American bombers pounded into oblivion a generation ago.
   Today, the villagers smile and welcome foreign visitors, but the
older ones still wonder what they did to deserve the terror that
rained from the skies between 1964 and 1973.
   American planes attacked Ban Dong Nai during the Indochina war
because the clay track was part of the Ho Chi Minh Trail, the
network of jungle paths through eastern Laos and Cambodia used by
communist North Vietnam to move men and supplies into U.S.-backed
South Vietnam.
   Not far across the Vietnamese frontier is the former U.S. base
at Khe San, which Gen. William Westmoreland called the key to
stopping full-scale infiltration from the trail. U.S. Marines held
it during a 1968 siege that cost the lives of about 500 Americans
and 10,000 Vietnamese.
   The Ho Chi Minh Trail was the main target of America's ``secret
war'' in Laos, which involved 242,000 bombing sorties in 1969
alone. More than 2 million tons of bombs were dropped on Laos
altogether, surpassing the U.S. total in World War II.
   Lahoun Maprayvong, a former guerrilla and now an administrator
in Tchepone town, recalled the first day of bombing, during a
Buddhist festival in late 1964.
   ``We were warned, but we just didn't know what to expect,'' he
said, and the bombardment grew steadily worse. The planes came
every day for nine years, sometimes four or five times, then also
at night.
   Lahoun said villagers were most afraid of the huge B-52 bombers
the United States began using extensively in 1967.
   ``They flew so high you couldn't see them, so there was no
warning,'' he said. ``They dropped bombs in line _ Bam! Bam! Bam!
Bam! _ like that. If you were next in line, then that was it.''
   Each B-52 dropped 30 tons of bombs in ``boxes'' half a mile wide
and two miles long, gouging out permanent craters.
   ``When they bombed like that, people ran away to the mountains
to live in caves,'' Lahoun said. ``Some years, we had to change
places five times. When we came back, there was nothing left.''
   Ban Dong Nai and Tchepone were destroyed by 1973.
   Noi, who was a young girl in the 1960s, said her father was
killed in one attack. ``I just don't understand why the Americans
did what they did. You couldn't escape the bombs,'' she said.
   Khamlai was in her 20s in 1968 when she and her younger brother,
walking to a rice field, stepped on American mines.
   She looked down at the ugly metal and rubber left leg she has
worn for 22 years and said: ``Can you tell me how to make it more
beautiful?''
   Her brother lost both legs.
   People along the trail recalled day after day of napalm attacks.
Lahoun said some still suffer from injuries caused by napalm and
phosphorous bombs. Many hillsides stripped by chemical defoliants
remain bare.
   After South Vietnam's unsuccessful attack on the trail in 1971,
all the trees and bushes were burned away and the road was jammed
with the wreckage of tanks, helicopters and guns, said Phou
Wattana, a district official and former guerrilla.
   Villagers pointed out the hulk of an American-made tank and
chopped away long grass to uncover an artillery piece. Children
played near piles of rusty shells and bombs.
   ``They're only dangerous if you put them in the fire,'' a
policeman said with a shrug.
   Xoun, an old man who stays home from the rice paddies to watch
the children of Ban Dong Nai, used a machete to uncover unexploded
250- and 500-pound bombs.
   Many bomb craters remain in and around the village and Xoun said
thousands of small, unexploded anti-personnel bombs still kill and
maim farmers.
   ``When the planes came, we had to go and live in the forest for
many years,'' he said.
   ``As you can see, we are used to living peacefully around here.
There used to be lots of fruit trees _ jack fruit, coconut, banana
_ but after the Americans came, there was nothing left. We had to
rebuild everything, but the fruit trees won't grow anymore.''
   Lahoun said the United States should help.
   ``We hadn't done anything to hurt the Americans and they came to
drop bombs on us,'' he said. ``We ask the U.S. government to do
something to cure the damage they have done.''

<TEXT>
   Children found two metal spheres the
size of tennis balls and were playing with them when the toys
exploded, killing a 7-year-old boy and seriously wounding another
child.
   That was in April, in Ban Na Dee village. Nearly two decades
after the air war ended, small anti-personnel bombs dropped on Laos
by American planes kill and maim dozens of people a year.
   The Plain of Jars, a remote region of central Laos named for the
hundreds of ancient burial urns spread over its undulating hills,
was one of the most heavily bombed areas of Indochina between 1964
and 1973.
   American planes rained ``bombies,'' as the Laotians call the
anti-personnel bomblets, and thousands of tons of conventional
bombs on areas under the control of Laotian communist guerrillas.
   The small, round bombs, designed to kill or disable people,
explode and spew ball bearings, tiny darts or slivers of metal or
plastic. Many that did not go off lie hidden in rice paddies and
long grass throughout the Plain of Jars.
   Xieng Khouang province officials said 19 people had been killed
and 39 wounded by the bomblets so far in 1990. Boua Van, a
provincial administrator, said more than 1,000 people had been
killed in Xieng Khouang since the bombing ended in 1973, two-thirds
of them children.
   Western aid workers say villagers are afraid to farm in many
parts of the province.
   ``The villagers are subsistence farmers who have to go out and
dig for their living,'' a Laotian official said, on condition of
anonymity.
   ``When they go out to plow their fields or dig latrines, they
risk uncovering a bombie. In some cases the decision where to dig
an irrigation ditch depends on whether there are bombies around.''
   Some of the war's leftovers have been welcome. Scrap merchants
say they will be in business for years with the debris littering
the Plain of Jars.
   Kham Meuang said he sells tons of bomb scraps and aluminum from
downed U.S. aircraft to buyers in Thailand and Vietnam.
   Ball bearings from ``bombies'' can be used to repair bicycles,
he said, and aircraft aluminum brings a profit of $1 a kilogram
(2.2 pounds) when sold to Thai buyers.
   ``It's best quality, better than the stuff they can get over
there,'' the merchant said.
   Aluminum scrap of lesser quality is made into the spoons found
in noodle stalls. Livestock wear bells crafted from bomb parts.
   Under-wing fuel tanks from jet fighters have become elegant
canoes in Savannakhet province.
   Hmong hill people make traditional-style jewelry from aircraft
aluminum, which they say is lighter, more plentiful and cheaper
than silver.
   Villagers say large unexploded bombs are relatively easy to
avoid or defuse, but that some of the bomblets have no external
fuse mechanisms and may explode without warning.
   ``When they are on the surface, it is not so bad, but when they
are buried deep in a field it is difficult to avoid casualties,''
said Boua Van, the provincial administrator.
   In the Savannakhet provincial hospital, a farmer lay in agony
from head, chest and foot wounds suffered when he struck a bomblet
with a stick while planting rice a few weeks earlier. An X-ray
showed ball bearings inside him.
   The explosions usually kill the people who cause them, said Dr.
Vath Vongsouthi, who has treated dozens of victims.
   Boua Van said most casualties occur during the planting season,
and ``of course people are afraid, but when they are working they
have no other choice except to try to avoid them. The children,
especially, don't know how dangerous they are.''
   He said he had defused at least 500 of the bomblets, but that
other people without his knowledge and luck had been killed trying
it.
   Local officials and Western aid workers say the U.S. government
should help solve the problem.
   U.S. diplomats in Vientiane said Washington had proposed sending
experts to train bomb disposal teams, but the government had
declined the offer for reasons that were unclear.

<HEAD>Conference Committee Considers Host of Clean Air Disputes</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: CORRECTS 24th graf, The House ... new equipment., to show
that environmentalists and industry both favor the House version on
risk assessment of toxic releases by industry.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congressional negotiators must resolve a host
of disputes over how far government and industry should go to clean
the air, from placing emission restrictions on small factories to
helping workers laid off because of tougher pollution controls.
   The sheer size of the 148-member House-Senate conference
committee, more than a quarter of the Congress, points to the high
stakes in the political battle. The legislation is expected to cost
more than $21 billion a year in new pollution controls.
   ``There will be clean air legislation this year. I don't think
anyone disputes that,'' asserts Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., chairman
of the conference.
   Baucus said in an interview that he considers separate clean air
bills passed by the House and Senate ``by and large very similar''
with identical goals of significantly cutting urban smog, reducing
acid rain and curtailing the industrial release of toxic chemicals
by the end of the decade.
   But there remains much dispute over details of tergy and Commerce
Committee.
   The Senate negotiators, on the other hand, number only nine.
Four of them _ Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine,
Baucus, Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., and Sen. David Durenberger,
R-Minn. _ led the Senate battle for clean air legislation. Seven of
the nine are members of the Senate Environment Committee and they
are expected to balk at any proposals that would significantly
weaken the legislation.
   The separate bills that breezed through both the House and
Senate last spring would impose stiff new requirements on industry
to control toxic chemicals, on factories to reduce smog-causing
pollution, and on electric power plants to curb sulfur dioxide,
which causes acid rain. They also would direct automakers to build
cleaner cars and oil companies to provide cleaner fuels to reduce
urban smog.
   But the House and Senate versions often differ on how far
companies should go to control toxic releases, what polluters
should be covered, or in some cases what measures should be taken
to comply.
   The final negotiations on these details will determine ``whether
you have a good clean air bill or a bill that's not very good at
all,'' said Richard Ayres, chairman of the National Clean Air
Coalition, an environmental umbrella group.
   Industry, meanwhile, makes no secret that it will push the
congressional negotiators to scuttle some of the strongest
requirements in either bill.
   ``We know the goals of the two bills are about the same. We're
trying to make it the most affordable to the American business
community and to the consumer,'' said William Fay, executive
director of the Clean Air Working Group, the industry's lobbying
coalition.
   Fay calls the government's estimated $21.5 billion price tag for
the clean air bill unrealistic and maintains the cost will be much
higher if some of the provisions found in either the Senate or
House bills survive.
   According to lawmakers, congressional aides and lobbyists, here
are a number of the most contentious issues that will have to be
resolved by the House and Senate negotiators:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>REQUIREMENTS ON NEW AUTOMOBILES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Both the House and Senate bills would require tougher tailpipe
emission controls. But the Senate bill would trigger a second round
of even tighter requirements automatically if air quality did not
meet federal health standards in a dozen pollution-plagued cities
by the end of the decade.
   The automakers argue they cannot meet the second phase of
controls with current technology and hope the House version will
prevail. They have a strong ally in Dingell.
   At the same time, however, the automakers plan to fight another
House provision _ not in the Senate bill _ that would require them
to build and market at least some alternative fuel cars.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>CONTROLS ON INDUSTRIAL POLLUTION
   Both bills would require large polluters emitting more than 100
tons a year to install new equipment to reduce smog-causing
emissions. But the House would include factories that pollute much
less _ as little as 10 or 25 tons a year _ in cities with the
dirtiest air.
   Industry and the Bush administration have argued that the more
sweeping controls in the House bill would force businesses to
close, put people out of work and jeopardize economic growth.</HEAD>
<HEAD>CLEAN FUELS
   Both bills call for cleaner motor fuels to be used in cities
with serious smog problems, but the language is under attack from
the oil industry, which says the government is trying write its own
recipe for gasoline. The oil companies and their congressional
allies have vowed to get the provisions changed, arguing the
requirement is aimed to boost the sale use of ethanol, which is
made from grain.</HEAD>
<HEAD>TOXIC INDUSTRIAL RELEASES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Both bills would require that industry adopt new technology to
curb industrial releases of toxic chemicals into the air. But the
Senate bill would go another step by establishing minimum cancer
risk levels that would be allowed after the new equipment was
installed. If those risks could not be achieved a plant could be
ordered shut down.
   The House version, considered by industry to be less onerous
than the Senate requirements, would leave it to the Environmental
Protection Agency to establish ``an ample margin of safety'' beyond
installation of the new equipment. Many environmentalists also
favor the House version, fearing the plant-by-plant assessment of
risk included in the Senate bill would be less effective.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>JOBS PROTECTION</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The House bill calls for a three-year, $250 million program to
help workers who lose their jobs because of tougher pollution
controls. The Senate bill would provide no assistance.
   While Senate leaders have expressed support for the House
measure, the White House has threatened to veto legislation
containing assistance for workers, saying it would be difficult to
control the cost. While it is doubtful to many in Congress that
Bush would sacrifice clean air legislation because of the labor
assistance, the administration is expected to argue vigorously
against the provision.

<HEAD>New Nike Ad Offers Fanciful Explanation of How Bo Does It All</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When the baseball and football seasons collide
later this summer, Bo Jackson may wish life was more like his new
Nike commercial.
   In the ad, the pro football and baseball star is beside himself
_ he plays 15 roles at once.
   Nike's commercial makers came up with the approach while trying
to figure out a sequel to last year's ``Bo Knows ... '' ad in which
athletes such as runner Joan Benoit Samuelson and basketball's
Michael Jordan attested to Jackson's ability in their specialities.
   There were dissenters in last year's ad _ hockey's Wayne Gretzky
and guitar man Bo Diddley to name two _ but a revised version of
the commercial six months later indicated Bo made Diddley a
believer as well.
   The ad catapulted Jackson to the top of the list of the year's
most persuasive sports figures in a commercial, according to an
annual survey of 22,000 people questioned by the research firm
Video Storyboard Tests Inc.
   And it was the main reason consumers cited in making Nike the
sixth most memorable admaker during the first quarter of 1990,
another Video Storyboard Tests survey said earlier this year.
   But last year's success created a problem for Jim Riswold,
associate creative director at Nike's ad agency Wieden &amp; Kennedy in
Portland, Ore.
   ``It was a hard act to follow,'' said Riswold, copywriter on
both campaigns.
   ``We kept coming back to the question: How does Bo do all these
things? And we decided, well, Bo is more than one person. We
decided to use the dumbest joke in the history of advertising,''
Riswold said.
   For the new ad, Nike's admakers decided to have Jackson don gear
used in a dozen different sports _ not only his Kansas City Royals
baseball uniform and his Los Angeles Raiders football suit but
tennis, cycling, surfing, soccer, cricket, golf, cricket and
cross-training gear.
   Each of the Bo's were shot separately; skillful editing made it
appear they were gathering one by one in a locker room.
   Bo Football tries to guess Bo Baseball's name. Bo Cyclist
screeches to a halt and asks, ``Where's that Tour de France Thing?''
   Bo Hockey sports ``Le Bo'' stitched across his jersey. Bo Golfer
has a Bo Caddy to carry his clubs and search for his
Jackson-autograph golf ball.
   Jackson put on a jockey's outfit to lead a horse across the set,
and he got behind the wheel of an Indy-style racing car that was
pulled across the set.
   Cher's onetime beau Sonny Bono wandered into the act. ``I
thought this was another Bo Knows commercial,'' he said.
   By the time Bo Director joins the scene and calls ``cut'' at the
end of the ad, the TV screen is full of Bo's.
   There is some method to all this madness. The ad showed off an
array of Nike apparel as well as its shoes. Nike makes clothes for
each of the sports Jackson demonstrated except horse and auto
racing, hockey and cricket, according to Nike ad manager Bill Zeitz.
   He said Nike plans to spend about $10 million on buying
television time for the new ad. He declined to say how much Jackson
is being paid.

   A new satellite-transmitted information
system is beaming the names of buyers and sellers to farmers with
too many green peppers or too little sweet corn.
   The pilot program by the Illinois Farm Bureau is seen as one
possible solution to the eternal problem of balancing supply and
demand in perishable produce, as well as possibly boosting profits.
   ``Sometimes we have too much and sometimes we don't have
enough,'' said Ron Friend, who raises cantaloupe and watermelon
near Havana in west-central Illinois, along the Illinois River. ``I
remember one day in 1973 it came out exactly right.''
   Fruit and vegetable growers scramble to find wholesale buyers
when they harvest more fresh commodities than they can sell at
their roadside markets or to regular customers. And they search for
other farmers with extra produce when their own harvests are short.
   ``The growers seem to be very excited about the system,'' said
Don Naylor, a specialist in fruit and vegetable marketing who
manages the new project for the Farm Bureau. ``We're trying to
bring farmers together who might be separated by hundreds of
miles.''
   The Farm Bureau already had the foundation of the new service _
its FarmDayta system for delivering weather, market information and
agricultural news to about 5,000 Illinois grain producers.
   Farms receive the data via satellite dish and read it on a
computer screen. Twenty-five fruit and vegetable growers were added
to the system this summer to see if it could help them buy and sell
produce.
   Those farmers call a toll-free number to list their names,
locations, telephone numbers and crops they wish to buy or sell.
They then must contact buyers or sellers and agree on terms.
   ``We don't raise our own fruit, and at times there are local
shortages,'' said Don Zeldenrust, who grows vegetables and sells
produce at his Chicago Heights roadside market.
   ``We might have to go to Michigan, Missouri or Arkansas when
there are guys in Southern Illinois who have what we need,'' said
Zeldenrust. ``It doesn't make sense to ship the fruit a long way.
It's better for them and better for us.''
   The buyer-seller information, along with prices being paid at
Chicago's South Water Street wholesale produce market, is
transmitted to subscribers who pay $100 for six months' service
during the pilot stage of the project.
   ``I'm using it to keep up-to-date on the market,'' said Carl
Weissert, who grows vegetables near Fairview Heights, in the
metropolitan area east of St. Louis.
   He said when the system is fully operational, the speed at which
the information is available should be a big plus to farmers.
   ``You won't find out next week what WAS available,'' said
Weissert.
   Growers say a limited amount of information now is on the
system. But they hope more farmers will sign up and that it will
help all of them increase their profits.
   ``Right now, you just can't find sweet corn anywhere,'' said
Dennis Harms, who raises and sells fruits and vegetables in McHenry
County, northwest of the metropolitan Chicago area.
   ``If this system works, we can help each other, cut out the
middleman, lower our prices and compete with the big chain stores _
they're killing us.''

<HEAD>`Fast Eddie' Edwin T. McBirney Pleads Innocent To Bank Fraud
Charges</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Sept. 4 trial date has been set for former
thrift executive Edwin T. McBirney III, but his attorney says
publicity surrounding the case may make it difficult to get a fair
trial in Dallas.
   ``To schedule two press conferences (to announce the
indictment), we think that exacerbates an already bad situation,''
attorney Paul Coggins said Thursday. Earlier in the day, his
client, the former chairman of Sunbelt Savings Association of
Texas, was arraigned on charges of bank fraud, misapplication of
funds, false entries and making false statements.
   Coggins has until July 30 to ask U.S. District Judge Robert
Maloney to move the trial.
   McBirney, who entered an innocent plea, is one of several former
thrift executives targeted for prosecution in investigations
looking for fraud in the multibillion-dollar collapse of the
savings and loan industry.
   He was indicted last week by one of three federal grand juries
in Dallas hearing bank fraud cases. The charges were announced in
simultaneous news conferences in Dallas and Washington, where U.S.
Attorney General Dick Thornburgh conducted the briefing.
   McBirney, 37, faces up to 85 years in jail and a fine of $4.5
million if convicted. He remains free on his own recognizance.
   Dallas-based Sunbelt, nicknamed ``Gunbelt Savings'' for its
freewheeling deals, grew 5,000 fold from 1982, when McBirney and
five associates bought the thrift, until 1986, when government
regulators forced him out.
   Sunbelt failed two years later in a bailout regulators estimate
will cost taxpayers $2 billion.
   The 17-count indictment accuses McBirney of promising another
thrift a $6 million profit on one transaction in return for help in
financing a $700 million real estate deal in California.
   Investigators say the deal was one of the reasons Sunbelt failed.
   According to the indictment, McBirney guaranteed Western Savings
Association, also of Dallas, a $6 million profit on any property it
wished to sell. In return, Western was to provide $30 million to
help finance the $700 million deal by Sun Cal, a Sunbelt subsidiary.
   McBirney directed Sunbelt officials to loan $22.6 million to an
unidentified purchaser to buy a 708-acre tract north of Dallas
valued at $13 million, the indictment says.
   The indictment claims McBirney made additional loans to keep the
original loan out of default, and then altered records to hide the
deals from Sunbelt and government auditors.
   Thirteen former Sunbelt executives, borrowers or McBirney
associates have been convicted as a result of the 2{-yearlong
Sunbelt investigation.
   Sunbelt, Western and six other thrifts were declared insolvent
in 1988, and packaged into a new institution, Sunbelt Savings,
Federal Savings Bank, owned by depositors.

<HEAD>Three Bidders For Ford Aerospace</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co. has received three bids for its
aerospace subsidiary and may choose one within a week, a spokesman
said.
   Company spokesman Tom Rhoades said Thursday that one of the bids
involves a subsidiary of archrival General Motors Corp. He declined
to say how much money was offered in any of the proposals.
   ``We would narrow it down to a single bidder sometime next
week,'' he said. ``It could be earlier.''
   Ford Aerospace, which has contracts with the Defense Department
and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, was put up
for sale Jan. 12.
   Chrysler Corp. and Ford put their prime defense contracting
subsidiaries on the block as speculation grew that the government
would drastically cut back its purchasing because of reduced
tensions with the Soviet Union.
   The automakers said they wanted to focus on their core
businesses of making, financing and selling cars and trucks.
Chrysler sold its Gulfstream Aerospace Corp. subsidiary in February
for $825 million.
   GM has said it does not plan to sell its main defense
subsidiary, GM-Hughes Electronic Corp., which includes Hughes
Aircraft Co. and Delco Electronics Corp.
   Rhoades said one of the three bids came as a joint effort
between GM-Hughes and Alcatel Co. of France.
   The others are from Loral Corp., a New York defense electronics
company, and a consortium of Westinghouse Electric Corp., the
investment firm Carlyle Group, and Aerospatiale of France, which is
connected with the Airbus aircraft.
   Loral spokeswoman Elizabeth Allen confirmed the company had
submitted a bid, but declined to disclose details or say when she
expected a decision from Ford.
   Ford Aerospace's operations and products include the Sidewinder
air-to-air missile, space vehicles including the INTELSAT
communications satellite and computer programs. The company
received an estimated $1.8 billion in contracts last year.
   The wholly owned subsidiary, based in Newport Beach, Calif.,
employs about 17,000 people.

<HEAD>Dollar Higher Against Yen, Nikkei Down</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar was higher against the yen in light
trading today, while share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange fell
sharply following the arrest of the leader of a speculator group.
   The dollar closed at 148.35 yen, up 0.75 yen from Thursday's
finish of 147.60 yen. It opened at 148.15 yen and fluctuated
between 147.90 yen and 148.40 yen.
   Meanwhile, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues lost
634.10 points, or 1.92 percent, and closed at 32.421.52. The
benchmark index had gained 7.51 points on Thursday.
   It was the sharpest single-day decline since April 16, when the
Nikkei index shed 750.74 points and fell to 28,463.18.
   Volume on the first section was estimated at 500 million shares,
compared with Thursday's 600 million.
   In bond dealings, the No. 119 10-year Japanese government bond
stood at 86.14 points as of 5:00 p.m., down from Thursday's close
of 86.54 points. The yield was 7.385 percent, up from 7.295 percent.
   Currency dealers said the dollar moved in a narrow range and
dealing was slow. ``It's because there are no fresh incentives to
make major movements in the last trading day of the week,'' said
Minori Takeuchi of Chemical Bank.
   On the stock market, declining first-section issues outpaced
advancing issues 738 to 224, while 159 others remained unchanged.
   Traders attributed the drop to Thursday's arrest of the leader
of the speculator group Koshin.
   The leader and a former construction company executive were
arrested on charges of engaging in stock price manipulation
involving Fujita Tourist Enterprise Co.
   Arbitrage selling and a softened bond market also contributed to
the lower share prices, said Yoshiro Inoue of Nomura Securities.
   ``Since the yen-dollar rates are stable, share prices might
bounce back early next week despite the lower bond prices,'' Inoue
said.

<TEXT>
   House Democrats plan quick committee approval
of a major civil rights bill for workers while remaining open to a
compromise aimed at heading off a presidential veto over hiring
quotas.
   ``We will listen respectfully'' to any administration proposals,
Rep. Don Edwards, D-Calif., said Thursday as lawmakers laid the
groundwork for action on the bill in the Judiciary Committee next
week.
   He suggested, though, that changes designed to ease
administration concerns could be fairly modest. ``We're going to be
discussing one or two items that could make them feel a little
better,'' he said.
   The measure, which tops the civil rights movement's legislative
agenda, won Senate approval, 65-34, Wednesday night. The margin of
approval was two votes short of the two-thirds needed to overturn a
presidential veto.
   Despite the plan for quick committee action, House Speaker
Thomas Foley, D-Wash., said the measure probably would not reach
the floor until September. He said the reason was a logjam of bills
awaiting action.
   Provisions of the bill, which would effectively reverse five
Supreme Court decisions last year, range from a ban on racial
harassment in the workplace to punitive damages for discrimination
victims in extreme cases.
   The sharpest clashes have come over a provision designed to
overcome a Supreme Court ruling that favors companies in certain
discrimination suits.
   In these suits, companies are charged with discrimination
because their percentage of minority employees is smaller than the
percentage of qualified minority workers in the local labor force.
   Until last year, companies could win if they proved that the
employment practices leading to the disparity were required by
``business necessity.'' The new ruling made it easier for
employers, placing on those filing suit the burden of proving the
practices in question were not business necessities.
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., the chief Senate sponsor, said
he and White House officials bargained for weeks over the
definition of business necessity but could never fully cement an
agreement.
   Kennedy said that in the final hours before the vote, they spoke
of including two definitions but could not agree on which one would
cover issues such as hiring, firing and promotions.
   The administration maintains that in its current form, the
definition would force employers to hire by quota as a way of
making certain that they comply with the law.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said today the administration
was ``regrouping'' and was prepared to continue negotiations with
the bill's supporters to reach a compromise.
   The president wants ``to rule out quotas and rule in maximum
employment opportunities for Americans,'' Thornburgh said on CBS
``This Morning.'' He added, however, ``The president will not sign
a quota bill. That's not in the American tradition.''
   President Bush has said repeatedly that he wants a bill to fight
job discrimination but not one that would lead to quotas.
   ``I'm still hopeful that eventually we'll get something worked
out _ I think it's important for the country,'' Kennedy told
reporters.
   Republicans suggested that Democrats have to be concerned about
the possibility that they could not override the presidential veto
that has been threatened if the bill reaches Bush in its current
form.
   ``It's obvious that 34 (Senate) votes are enough to sustain a
veto,'' said Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis.
   Rep. Jack Brooks, D-Texas, chairman of the Judiciary Committee,
said he expected the panel to approve the bill without any changes
Tuesday but added there could be compromise eventually.
   ``They haven't worked out any compromise with me or Mr.
Edwards,'' he said. ``I want it written down. I want to take a look
at their suggestions.''

<HEAD>Chemical Company Agrees to Pay $80 Million for Chromium Cleanup</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERSEY CITY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A chemical maker has agreed to pay New
Jersey $80 million to clean up homes and businesses contaminated
with chromium waste.
   PPG Industries Inc. of Pittsburgh also consented Thursday to pay
a $2.5 million fine and $900,000 for administrative costs.
   ``The state is satisfied with this agreement,'' said John
Hagerty, a spokesman for the New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection. ``Certainly it will go a long way toward revitalizing
Jersey City.''
   The state blamed the company and two other companies for the
chromium contamination of homes and businesses in Jersey City,
Kearny and Secaucus.
   Exposure to chromium can damage lungs, livers and kidneys, cause
skin lesions and, in some cases, cause lung cancer.
   Chromium is a byproduct created in the extraction of chrome for
bumpers, chemicals and electrical components.
   The three companies are successors to companies that ran
chromium processing plants in the area from 1905 to 1971. They sold
or gave away chromium-tainted slag for landfill.
   Occidental Chemical Corp. of Dallas agreed in May to pay the
state $51.5 million for cleanup and a $2.5 million fine.
   The state was still negotiating with the third company,
Allied-Signal Inc. of Morris Township.
   State officials estimate as much as 3 million tons of chromium
is buried under houses and businesses in Hudson County.

   Stock prices advanced Friday with dealers
reporting strong underlying investor support despite an explosion
at the Stock Exchange building.
   The blast failed to interrupt trading in regular shares, which
is conducted on a computer screen-based system. However, the
explosion did close the floor-based London Traded Options Market.
   As a result, equity market makers were unable to use traded
options as an aid to market direction, traders said.
   One dealer said that in the absence of options trading, market
makers were moving prices more than usual to seek out buying and
selling sentiment and gauge the market better.
   But traders also detected strong investor buying interest.
   ``It's probably the first time'' in several months that genuine
buying interest has surfaced, a dealer said.
   At midday, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index
was up 11 points, or 0.5 percent, at 2,398.3.
   Calculations of volume were unavailable while the Stock Exchange
building was evacuated. However, traders described volume as light.
   By midday Thursday, 233.3 million shares were traded.

<TEXT>
   Kuwait has canceled a state of alert it
declared in an oil dispute with Iraq, a Kuwaiti source said.
   The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, claimed Thursday
that the crisis appeared to have passed like ``a summer cloud.''
   However, officials in Baghdad reported that thousands of
Kuwaitis visiting Iraq were heading home. And Iraqi dailies
continued to accuse Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates of
``usurping Iraq's rights.''
   The alert followed Iraqi charges that Kuwait had stolen Iraqi
oil worth $2.4 billion, and Iraqi threats of retaliation. Kuwait
had appealed to other Arab states for support in the dispute with
its much more powerful neighbor.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein on Thursday tightened his grip on
power, winning support from his rubber-stamp parliament for a
presidency for life.
   The developments underscored simmering tensions in the Persian
Gulf. The region includes about two-thirds of the world's proven
oil reserves, so instability can pose a threat to the world's oil
supply.
   Baghdad in recent days had denounced Kuwait and the United Arab
Emirates for exceeding production quotas set by the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC.
   Iraq says falling oil prices brought on by the oil glut have
robbed it of $14 billion in revenues the past year, and Saddam this
week accused quota violators of stabbing Iraq in the back ``with a
poisoned dagger.''
   In seeking to defuse the crisis, Kuwait on Thursday solicited
Arab League help in settling its longstanding border dispute with
Iraq. The small sultanate enlisted the help of influential Saudi
Arabia in easing tensions, and its diplomats fanned out across the
Middle East.
   A major factor in the Kuwaiti and Saudi responses has been fears
that the quarrel could disrupt an OPEC conference, set to begin
next Thursday in Geneva, on production and pricing policy.
   Both Kuwait and the U.A.E. have promised to cut oil production
in line with the quotas decreed by the 13-member cartel. Also, oil
prices _ which had dipped to $14 a barrel recently _ have recovered
to around OPEC's benchmark level of $18 a barrel.
   Some Kuwaiti officials and diplomats suggested that Saddam's
accusations are aimed at winning a writeoff of a debt of $30
billion to Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. The two poured the money into
Iraq during the 1980-88 war against Iran to prop up its economy and
pay for weapons.
   Kuwait's appeal for help in settling the border dispute was made
in a memorandum sent to the Arab League headquarters in Tunis. The
Kuwait News Agency quoted the memo as suggesting that a committee
be formed to resolve the question ``on the basis of treaties and
existing documents.''
   Iraq this week accused Kuwait of border incursions including the
pumping of $2.4 billion worth of oil in the past decade from an
Iraqi oil field near the boundary.
   Kuwait's foreign minister, Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmed, said Kuwait
was producing oil from fields ``well within its territory.''
   Meanwhile, the official Iraqi News Agency reported that the
Iraqi Parliament had expressed support for Saddam becoming
president for life.
   The Iraqi News Agency said the 250-member legislature, dominated
by Saddam's party, called for changes in a new draft constitution
that would have provided for presidential elections. Iraq has held
no such balloting since becoming a republic in 1958.
   The constitution is subject to public vote expected later this
year.
   Saddam, who has been in power since July 1979, exercises
near-total rule over Iraq's 17 million people through his vast
security apparatus.
   He has turned his reign into a personality cult that has reached
the realms of near-mythology. Photos and posters of him are seen
everywhere in Iraq, and it is a capital offense to insult him
publicly.

   The explosion of a bomb in the building housing
London's Stock Exchange did not disrupt stock trading today because
share dealing takes place away from the exchange floor.
   There were no injuries in the blast, although it caused
extensive damage.
   Share prices actually rose during the incident. By about 12:15
p.m. (7:15 a.m. EDT), the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share
index was up 11 points, or 0.5 percent, at 2,398.3.
   Options trading was disrupted, however.
   The exchange building's largely deserted, ground-level trading
floor houses the London Traded Options Market. Options are the
right to buy or sell shares at a fixed price before a specific date.
   Since Britain's huge ``Big Bang'' deregulation nearly four years
ago, British and foreign shares have been traded by telephones and
computers away from the Stock Exchange's modern tower in the heart
of the City of London, the financial district.
   The explosion, in a restroom near the exchange's floor viewing
gallery, came at 8:49 a.m. (3:49 a.m. EDT), 40 minutes after a
telephone warning of an Irish Republican Army bomb, police said.
The building on Broad Street was evacuated before the bomb exploded.
   Under the British stock trading system, ``market makers'' at
scattered, designated investment firms track markets in different
stocks.
   The exchange requires them to quote prices continuously through
the official trading day, which runs from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.
Trading also is allowed to take place outside official hours.
   The market makers' prices appear on the exchange's computerized
price quotations system, SEAQ International.
   The London market is Europe's biggest and forms part of the
so-called ``Golden Triangle'' with Tokyo and New York. On the New
York and Tokyo stock exchange, specialists in stocks conduct buying
and selling on the floor.
   The London exchange has been studying what it should do with its
deserted floor. The options market plans to move out.
   Visitors still flock to the exchange's viewing gallery over the
floor, where the familiar hexagonal stations, but not the bustling
activity, remain.
   The visitors' entrance is separate from the exchange's main
entrance. A security guard inspects' visitors' bags.

   President Bush's savings and loan bailout fund
will be nearly out of money if officials reach their goal of
closing or selling 77 institutions by Sept. 30, a federal agency
says.
   Figures provided Thursday by the Resolution Trust Corp.
Oversight Board indicate that, unless Congress authorizes more
borrowing, regulators could have as little as $7.3 billion in
borrowing authority left when the new federal fiscal year begins
Oct. 1.
   ``The bottom line ... (is) it would cause us to very
significantly reduce the pace of resolutions,'' said Peter Monroe,
president of the oversight board.
   Congress last year allocated $50 billion to cover S&amp;L losses and
the oversight board estimates that after the 77 resolutions are
finished, $37 billion of that will have been used. However, the
agency will hit a cash crunch before the $50 billion is exhausted
because of legal caps on its short-term borrowing.
   In addition to the $7.3 billion, the agency could spend any
money it can get by selling repossessed real estate and sour loans
inherited from previous S&amp;L bailouts, he said.
   If Congress doesn't provide more money before adjourning for the
November elections, the government will be forced to slow the pace
of the bailout or dramatically increase the pace of asset sales,
Monroe said.
   His comments, combined with the new figures, are the clearest
indication yet from the administration about the urgency of
providing additional bailout funds.
   In appearances before congressional panels in May and June,
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady roughly doubled the
administration's August 1989 estimate of the bailout cost from $50
billion to between $90 billion and $130 billion. He had said
additional money would be needed by the end of December or early
next year.
   Monroe's figures indicate that, at the current pace, the bailout
will run out of money soon after Sept. 30.
   So far, the trust corporation has ``resolved'' the cases of 210
S&amp;Ls, leaving roughly 250 insolvent thrifts open and under
government control. At least an additional 250 institutions still
under private ownership are expected to fail.
   ``We're two-sevenths of the way through,'' Monroe said.
   Because money is scarce, officials will concentrate this quarter
on closing the S&amp;Ls that are losing money the fastest, he said.
   In any case, officials will ``never go back'' to the type of
deals done in 1988 by the now-dismantled Federal Home Loan Bank
Board, Monroe said. Because the bank board lacked cash to pay off
depositors, it attracted S&amp;L acquirers through guarantees and other
subsidies extending up to 10 years.
   The 1988 transactions are coming under increasing criticism in
Congress because they virtually ensured lucrative returns to S&amp;L
buyers who made only a small investment.
   The oversight board authorized the trust corporation to borrow
up to $34 billion through the Treasury for the 77 resolutions in
the July-September period. This ``working capital'' borrowing would
be repaid as the government sells S&amp;L assets.
   In other developments Thursday:
   _ Angry Northeastern and Midwestern House members said they were
introducing a bill to force states with a disproportionate share of
troubled thrifts, such as Texas and California, to pay a bigger
portion of bailout costs. If a state declines to pay, its
state-chartered thrifts no longer would be eligible for federal
deposit insurance.
   Other legislation, sponsored by Rep. Joe Kennedy, D-Mass., would
force wealthy Americans to pay more of the cost. His bill would
raise $100 billion over five years by imposing new income taxes on
individuals earning more than $100,000 a year and corporations
earning more than $75,000 a year. It also would eliminate a
provision that forgives inheritance taxes on capital gains at death.
   _The Justice Department said it had uncovered ``certain S&amp;L
cases'' where thrift institutions had swapped bad loans with each
other to avoid regulatory scrutiny. But spokesman Doug Tillett said
``the department has no evidence at this time that suggests the
existence of a large-scale conspiracy'' among thrifts to trade bad
loans.
   _In Dallas, former Sunbelt Savings Association Chairman Edwin T.
McBirney III, known as ``Fast Eddie,'' pleaded innocent to bank
fraud charges. Sunbelt failed in 1988 at an estimated cost to the
government of $2 billion.

   The stock market edged upward today, pushing the
Dow Jones industrial average back to the threshold of the 3,000
level.
   Dow Jones's average of 30 blue chips rose 3.96 to 2,997.77 in
the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 7 to 6 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 497 up, 425 down and
523 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 22 million shares as of 10 a.m.
on Wall Street.
   Last Friday and again on Monday and Tuesday the Dow Jones
industrials crossed 3,000, only to turn back each time.
   But the pullback that followed proved to be shallow, and brokers
said bullish traders weren't discouraged for long.
   In recent sessions, analysts noted, the market has continued to
absorb the jolts of disappointing earnings results from a variety
of companies.
   Its resilence in the face of those developments apparently
convinced investors that demand for stocks remained strong.
   Browning-Ferris Industries dropped 1 to 42|. The company
reported slightly higher quarterly earnings on Thursday, but the
gain was a shade smaller than had been expected.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.37 to 199.75. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .08 at 361.92.
   On Thursday the Dow Jones industrial average posted a 12.13 gain
to 2,993.81.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 4 to 3 on the
NYSE, with 612 up, 853 down and 526 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 161.99 million shares, against 168.76
million in the previous session.

   National contract negotiations between the United
Auto Workers and the nation's Big Three automakers got into full
swing as talks began today between the union and Chrysler Corp.
   UAW President Owen Bieber and Chrysler Motors President Robert
Lutz reached across a large table to shake hands and both sides
then got down to business.
   The UAW started negotiations for new three-year labor agreements
on Wednesday with General Motors Corp. and Thursday with Ford Motor
Co. All three current contracts expire Sept. 14.
   At Chrysler, the union will be dealing with the automaker in the
worst financial shape of the Big Three.
   Since Oct. 1, Chrysler has been involved in a $1.5 billion
cost-cutting program designed to boost profits. But car and truck
sales for the automaker were running 13 percent behind 1989's pace
at midyear, while Ford's sales were off 7.8 percent and GM's were
down 3.5 percent.
   In May, the automaker reported it earned $71 million in the
first quarter of this year, down 80 percent from the same time last
year. In the second quarter, analysts expect Chrysler to make a
little more than half of the $341 million it earned during the
second three months of last year.
   In 1989, Chrysler made $359 million, far less than the $3.8
billion Ford made and the $4.2 billion GM earned. Chrysler's
earnings were too small to kick in profit-sharing provisions for
its hourly workers and, consequently, bonuses for salaried
employees.
   Nonetheless, the union's initial demands are expected to be the
same at Chrysler as at GM and Ford _ enhanced job security, wage
and pension improvements and protection of health-care benefits.
   The reaction from Chrysler's management, however, is likely to
be far different from responses at GM and Ford.
   Chrysler Vice President Anthony St. John, who heads the
company's negotiating team, has said if current contract provisions
simply are rolled over for another three years, it would boost the
automaker's labor costs by 16 percent.
   St. John said Chrysler can't afford that.
   His statements have given rise to theories that the death of
pattern bargaining in the auto industry may be at hand. If
tradition holds, sometime around Labor Day, the UAW will choose one
company and focus negotiating efforts there.
   After an agreement is reached, that contract would be used as a
model for talks at the other companies. But St. John's gloomy
outlook for the talks may indicate the No. 3 U.S. automaker doesn't
think it will be able to match contract provisions negotiated
between the union and Ford and GM.
   There were no such dire economic predictions from GM or Ford
management after hearing UAW statements earlier this week.
   As expected, the union said it was outraged at GM's closures of
four assembly plants during the past three years, and it criticized
Ford for its extensive use of overtime.
   The companies said they were looking for more flexibility in
work rules, schedules and the way plants' work forces are
structured.
   The contracts between the union and the Big Three cover more
than 450,000 workers and nearly as many retirees. It's the first
time since 1979 that all of the contracts have expired at the same
time.

<HEAD>Third Sprint Executive This Month Quits</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The architect of US Sprint's successful
bid for a share of a $25 billion federal contract has resigned, the
company said.
   Sprint confirmed Thursday the resignation of David C. Gergacz,
chief operating officer of its government network systems division,
but provided no other details. Gergacz, 41, could not be reached
for comment.
   He is the third key executive to leave Sprint this month.
   Clifford R. Hall, who was credited with solving serious billing
problems at Sprint, resigned two weeks ago. Jerry W. Cosley, vice
president of communications at Sprint and United Telecommunications
Inc., also announced his resignation. United Telecom is Sprint's
majority owner.
   Earlier this week, Sprint reported a $42 million net operating
loss in the second quarter. But Sprint spokesman Syd Courson said
Gergacz's resignation was unrelatedto the earnings problems.
   ``Basically, he just resigned to look for other opportunities,''
Courson said.
   Gary Forsee, 40, has been appointed Gergacz's successor, Courson
said. Forsee joined Sprint in December from American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph Co., where he was responsible for AT&amp;T's part of the $25
billion FTS 2000 contract to upgrade the federal government's phone
system.
   In late 1988 Sprint was selected to provide 40 percent of the
service, with AT&amp;T providing the remainder.

<HEAD>Caterpillar Announces Earnings Slumped in 2nd Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PEORIA, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Caterpillar Inc. reported today its earnings
fell 67 percent in the second quarter, a confirmation of the
company's earlier projection of a sharp decline in profits.
   The construction equipment manufacturer said it earned $46
million, or 46 cents per share, down from $141 million, or $1.39
per share, in the same period of 1989.
   Revenue for the quarter totaled $2.95 billion, a 3 percent drop
from the same period last year when Caterpillar recorded $3 billion
in revenue.
   The company attributed the decline to an 8 percent drop in sales
volume, which was offset in part by higher prices and a $19 million
improvement in revenue from Caterpillar's financial subsidiaries.
   In a statement, the company blamed its sagging profits on a
lower demand for machines among many industrial nations.
   On June 25, Caterpillar announced that new economic policies in
Brazil were having a disastrous impact on the company's profits.
   The company projected a dramatic decline in second quarter
earnings, which were less than half the $99 million earned in the
first quarter. It also revised its economic outlook for the year,
saying its profits for the entire year would be stagnant when
compared to 1989.
   Sales inside the United States were $1.3 billion for the
quarter, a drop of $59 million from last year. Sales outside the
United States were $1.5 billion, a decline of $54 million from the
second quarter 1989.
   For the first six months of the year, Caterpillar's profits
stood at $145 million, or $1.43 per share, down from $282 million,
or $2.78 per share, in the first half of 1989.
   Revenue for the first half totaled $5.8 billion, up from $5.72
billion a year earlier.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>

   Grain and soybean futures prices were mostly
lower in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trades as
beneficial showers in the Midwestern croplands dampened buying
interest.
   ``It's very hard to support the market in July when it's
raining,'' said Steve Freed, grains analyst with Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
   Showers began in the region Wednesday night and were expected to
continue at least through Saturday.
   Further selling in the soybean market reflected a weaker
European market for soybean meal after several days of active
trading that had been supporting the U.S. soybean complex.
   Wheat futures were mixed to higher in a slight rebound from
Thursday's moderate decline.
   Contracts for all July deliveries of grains and soybeans expire

   In early trading, wheat futures were { cent lower to } cent

   An explosion in a restroom caused extensive damage
at the Stock Exchange today, 40 minutes after a telephone warning
of an Irish Republican Army bomb, police said. No injuries were
reported.
   City of London Police said the building in the heart of London's
financial district was evacuated before the blast at 8:49 a.m.
   The explosion tore a hole about 20 feet high and seven feet wide
in the modern concrete building, about 10 feet above ground level
facing Old Broad Street. Glass and hunks of concrete littered the
street.
   Hugh Moore, commander of City of London Police, said warnings
were telephoned to his department, the exchange and to the Reuters
news agency. George Churchill-Coleman, commander of Scotland Yard's
anti-terrorist unit, said there were eight warning calls in all.
   The bomb, which contained 5 to 10 pounds of high explosives, was
in a men's restroom near the visitors' gallery, said
Churchill-Coleman. Asked whether the IRA was responsible, he told
reporters, ``That's a reasonable assumption.''
   Churchill-Coleman said the visitors' gallery had not open at the
time of the explosion. He said it was not known when the device was
planted.
   ``People would have been killed if they had been in the building
at the time,'' Moore said.
   A uniformed guard normally searches bags and parcels carried by
visitors before they enter the gallery, which accommodates up to
100 people.
   The National Westminster bank, near the exchange, was cordoned
off and searched following another bomb warning, police said. The
Royal Bank of Scotland building across from the exchange was also
evacuated.
   Press Association, Britain's domestic news agency, reported that
one caller who telephoned a warning said: ``This is the IRA. The
bomb is due to go off in half an hour at the Stock Exchange.''
   The caller then gave a code word recognized by police and said,
``Clear the building,'' the news agency reported.
   The IRA is fighting to end British rule of Northern Ireland.
   ``I am horrified that any group would take the risk of so many
people's lives in a public building,'' said Andrew Hugh Smith,
chairman of the Stock Exchange. ``The timing of the bomb and the
warning _ they all could have gone very wrong.''
   The exchange's computerized stock trading system was not
interrupted, but options trading was suspended. Smith said options
trading would resume Monday. He said about 600 people normally work
on the options floor.
   Share prices rose marginally following the explosion.
   Sharon Reilly, who was among those evacuated from the exchange,
said: ``There wasn't panic. People were in high spirits, curious.
They just thought it was a fire.''
   Police initially reported that the explosion started a fire
inside the structure, but a spokesman for the London Fire Brigade
said: ``We believe there is no fire situation in the building.''
   Joe Phillips, a 21-year-old options trader, said a recorded
warning was broadcast inside the exchange. ``Normally they say this
was a test, but a proper voice came on the tannoy (address system)
saying, `This is not a test. Get out of the building,''' he said.
   There had been 30 to 40 people on the trading floor, standing
around reading The Financial Times, looking at their screens and
waiting for trading to start, Phillips said.
   A large proportion of the Stock Exchange's staff of almost 2,600
work in the building. There has been no stock trading there since
the exchange was computerized in 1986, but options are traded in
the building.
   On June 25, an IRA bomb injured more than 20 people, two of them
seriously, at the Carlton Club, a gathering place for the ruling
Conservative Party.
   On June 20, two British army sergeants were injured when a bomb
ripped through a military van in Leicester in central England.
   The IRA wants the mainly Protestant province of Northern Ireland
to unite it with the Irish Republic, which is predominantly Roman
Catholic.

Bill</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Supporters of government management of grain
supplies fought off an effort in the Senate today to change the
1990 farm bill so farmers can plant more acres.
   The Senate voted 50-37 against a proposal by Sen. Rudy
Boschwitz, R-Minn., to amend the acreage-reduction program in the
bill.
   Boschwitz said the program would hurt U.S. ability to compete on
the world grain market by requiring farmers to idle some of the
most fertile land in the country.
   ``We have forgone production and in the process given the
markets to the Europeans,'' said Boschwitz.
   But supporters of the bill's provision said it was needed to
keep prices for grain stable by controlling the size of surpluses.
   Stability is the object of the farm bill, said Sen. Robert
Kerrey, D-Neb.,
   The Boschwitz amendment was the second major attack on the
Senate Agriculture Committee's bill to set farm policy for the next
five years.
   The first came Thursday when Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., tried
unsuccessfully to eliminate subsidies to farmers with gross sales
over $500,000 a year.
   ``The American taxpayer shells out $1.2 billion each year to
millionaires who own farms,'' Reid said. ``Why are we concerned
about protecting these farmer fat cats?''
   He said his amendment would affect only one-half of 1 percent of
the farmers in the country.
   But the idea was opposed by Senate Agriculture Committee members
who said it would inevitably hurt family farms.
   Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., said farmers who gross $500,000 don't
necessarily net any more than a factory worker once expenses are
paid.
   Sen. Richard Lugar of Indiana, the ranking Republican on the
committee, added, ``It is not hard to see how farmers could
subdivide their businesses to evade this amendment if they were so
inclined.''
   He said the amendment's requirement that farmers submit their
tax returns to county agents as proof of gross earnings would be an
invasion of privacy.
   ``It would also lead to an auditing problem that is very
substantial if what was once a farm of $500,000 now becomes 10
farms of $50,000 and 10 returns where various relatives are
involved,'' Lugar said.
   The amendment was defeated 66-30.
   The Senate did, however, reduce the overall cost of the bill to
bring it into line with tight budget demands.
   An amendment offered by Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick
Leahy, D-Vt., and passed on voice vote, reduced proposed commodity
supports in the Senate bill to a five-year cost of $54 billion.
That's $8 million below the amount approved for agriculture in the
Senate budget resolution last month.
   It's unlikely, however, that the cut will satisfy the Bush
administration, which has threatened a veto unless ``substantial,
multi-year savings'' are made.
   The administration doesn't want Congress to finish its bill
until negotiations with White House over the budget are complete.
Agriculture and defense are two key areas expected to be cut
significantly.
   ``The administration expects the budget summit to achieve
substantial, multi-year savings,'' said a statement from the Office
of Management and Budget. ``It would be a mistake for Congress to
complete action on a bill that gives producers the wrong impression
by sending them inaccurate signals about likely program
parameters.''
   Leahy said he couldn't predict what would be included in a
summit agreement.
   ``But this much is certain,'' he said. ``The senator from
Indiana (Lugar) and I are committed to making necessary budget
savings.''
   Among major provisions, the bill would:
   _Freeze current target prices and loan rates.
   _Create mandatory marketing loans on wheat and feed grains.
   _Moderately increase planting flexibility.
   _Establish a new program for oilseed production.
   _Improve the quality of grain.
   _Ban the export of pesticides that are outlawed for use in the
United States.
   _Give better protection to fragile wetlands.
   _Give farmers incentives to prevent contamination of groundwater.
   _Encourage reduced use of pesticides.
   _Establish a labeling system for organically grown products.
   _Change the foreign food aid program to make giveaways to needy
countries easier.
   _Revise forestry laws.

<HEAD>MCA Quarterly Net Up 7 Percent, Says It's Buying a Stake in Harvey
Comics</HEAD>
<DATELINE>UNIVERSAL CITY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   MCA Inc. reported its
second-quarter earnings rose 7 percent and that it had agreed to
buy a minority stake in Harvey Comics, creator of Casper the
Friendly Ghost, Richie Rich and Baby Huey.
   The entertainment conglomerate earned $44.8 million, up from
$41.9 million during the same period in 1989.
   Per-share earnings fell from 58 cents to 54 cents because of
MCA's purchase of Geffen Records in April. MCA bought the company
by issuing David Geffen 1 million shares of preferred stock,
convertible to 10 million shares of common stock. That diluted the
earning power of shares issued earlier.
   MCA's revenue reached record levels, jumping 15 percent from
$828 million to $950 million. Heavy contributors were theatrical
film revenue, which rose from $93 million to $143 million due to
the successful ``Back to the Future III'' and ``Bird on a Wire,''
and music entertainment, up from $197 million to $250 million.
   MCA includes domestic home video fees in the latter category.
   Revenue from MCA's Universal Studios Tour in Universal City fell
from $38.2 million to $35.9 million last year, when the popular
``Earthquake'' attraction opened.
   Notably absent were results from a $630 million studio theme
park that MCA opened six weeks ago in Orlando, Fla. Some
attractions, including the King Kong and earthquake rides, have
been knocked out by software problems.
   MCA said it did not report results because the park was not
fully operational.
   Its rival, Walt Disney Co., has run a separate studio theme park
not far away for a little over a year, and MCA's attraction had
been seen as possibly taking away visitors there. But Disney said
Tuesday that attendance at its park was up 20 percent in May and
June compared with the year before.
   For the first six months of the year, MCA's net income rose 10
percent to $76.4 million, or 96 cents per share, from $69.3
million, or 95 cents per share.
   Revenue rose 22 percent to $1.86 billion from $1.53 billion.
   MCA's agreement in principle to buy an interest in Harvey Comics
Entertainment is a clear if minor example of how crucial well-known
characters are to entertainment giants like MCA or Disney.
   Characters such as Casper, Richie Rich and Baby Huey can be
exploited around the world in movies, TV, home video, theme parks
and books, separately or in combination with characters to which
MCA already owns rights, said Thomas P. Pollock, the chairman of
MCA's motion picture group.
   In a telephone interview, Pollock said MCA was impressed with
Jeffrey A. Montgomery, who was just 25 when he raised money to buy
the dormant, family-owned Harvey last year.
   Pollock said MCA was supplying funds, marketing and distribution
and some manufacturing as part of the deal. Exact terms weren't
announced, but Montgomery reportedly paid $6 million for Harvey
last summer.
   ``We're helping them to help themselves,'' Pollock said. ``We're
a minority partner in the deal, making an equity investment. He
owns the characters and he's running it.''

<HEAD>Second-Quarter Profit Up at Media General, Off at McClatchy,
Multimedia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Media General Inc. said Friday its second-quarter profit more
than doubled from a year ago, largely because of a gain on the sale
of its West Coast weekly newspapers and its receipt of overdue
newsprint royalties.
   But earnings for the quarter fell 22 percent at McClatchy
Newspapers Inc. and were down 12.5 percent at Multimedia Inc.
   McClatchy, based in Sacramento, Calif., cited startup losses
from a newsprint mill partnership and costs associated with its
purchase of six newspapers in South Carolina earlier this year for
its profit decline.
   Multimedia, based in Greenville, S.C., pointed to a sluggish
environment for retail and automotive advertising as well as a
onetime debt refinancing loss. McClatchy and Multimedia reported
their results Thursday.

   The Richmond, Va.-based Media General said it earned $12.5
million, or 48 cents a share, in the three months ended June 30
compared with $6.1 million, or 23 cents a share, a year earlier.
   Second-quarter revenue rose 5.4 percent to $158.0 million from
$149.9 million a year earlier.
   The latest results included an after-tax contribution of $6.4
million, or 24 cents a share, from the sale of its Golden
West-Highlander weekly newspapers and receipt of past-due royalty
payments from its Mexican newsprint affiliate.
   The sluggish economic climate depressed both retail and
classified advertising at the company's newspapers in Richmond,
Tampa, Fla., and Winston-Salem, N.C., the company said.
   But strong growth in the company's cable operation in Fairfax,
Va., helped lift the company's revenue and earnings from its
broadcast division. The ad slump left ad revenues below
expectations at the company's three TV stations.
   ``While it appears that the advertising environment will be
troublesome through the rest of the year, we remain convinced that
the restructured Media General is well positioned to benefit when
the economic climate for advertising improves,'' said J. Stewart
Bryan III, chairman and chief executive.
   For the first half, Media General earned $15.1 million, or 58
cents a share, down from $17.9 million, or 69 cents a share, a year
earlier.
   First-half revenue rose 1.7 percent to $151 million from $148.4
million a year earlier.
   The first-half results for 1989 included a $5.7 million gain
after taxes on the sale of a newsprint mill in California.

   McClatchy said it earned $7.8 million, or 27 cents per share, in

cents a share, a year earlier.
   Without the newsprint mill startup costs and newspaper
purchases, the company said it would have earned 34 cents a share
in the quarter.
   Second-quarter revenue rose 10.6 percent to $107.6 million from
$97.3 million a year earlier.
   Operating income was up 4.3 percent to $17.1 million from $16.4
million a year earlier.
   For the first half, the company said it earned $10.2 million, or

a share.
   First-half revenue rose 10.3 percent to $202.7 million from

   Multimedia said it earned $9.6 million, or 77 cents a share, in

cents a share, a year earlier.
   Revenue for the quarter rose 2.4 percent to $123.9 million from
$121.0 million a year earlier.
   The latest results reflected an extraordinary loss of $3.1
million from refinancing its longterm debt of $718 million on June
29.
   Newspaper and broadcasting ad revenues lagged last year's
results because of a sluggish retail and automotive advertising
environment, the company said.
   For the first half, Multimedia earned $15.7 million, or $1.26 a
share, up from $15.4 million, or $1.24 a share, a year earlier.
   First-half revenue rose to $233.7 million from $227.3 million.
   Multimedia publishes 13 daily and 49 non-daily newspapers, owns

<HEAD>American Brands to Buy Moen Group</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JANET L. CAPPIELLO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GREENWICH, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Brands Inc., moving to take
advantage of the lucrative home remodeling market, said Friday it
would buy The Moen Group, a plumbing fixture manufacturer, for $975
million in cash.
   ``Repair and remodeling is what's become hot today,'' said
Robert Rukeyser, spokesman for American Brands. ``People are
staying in their homes longer and they are keeping them operating
properly. ... The focus of improvement is in kitchen and bath.''
   Repair and remodeling represents 70 percent of Moen's business,
Rukheyser said.
   American Brands is a conglomerate of liquor, office products,
tobacco and life insurance businesses. Its MasterBrand Industries
Inc. subsidiary reached the tentative agreement to buy Moen from
its owner, Forstmann Little &amp; Co., late Thursday night, Rukeyser
said.
   MasterBrand Industries includes Master Lock, makers of doorsets;
Aristokraft, a manufacturer of kitchen cabinets and bathroom
vanities; and Twentieth Century, a plumbing supply company.
   Moen, based in Elyria, Ohio, had earnings of $97 million last
year before depreciation and amortization, interest and taxes.
   American Brands also announced it intends to sell its Waterloo
Industries hardware business, which makes toolboxes, because it
doesn't fit with MasterBrand's focus.
   American Brands on Friday reported its second-quarter earnings
rose 31.8 percent, $158.4 million or $1.62 per common share from
$120.2 million or $1.25 per common share a year earlier.
   Revenue in the quarter ending June 30 rose to $2.95 billion from
$2.72 billion.
   For the first six months of 1990, American Brands said it earned
$353.8 million, or $3.62 per share, up 21 percent from $292.4
million, or $3.05 per share, a year earlier.
   Revenue increased to $6.16 billion from $5.97 billion in the
first half of 1989.
   Rukeyeser said the Moen purchase, which is subject to government
approvals, gives American Brands a foothold in what it had defined
three years ago as a core business.
   ``We've been making acquisitions now for just about 25 years,
and I don't think that we'll ever be settled because the markets
are changing and new opportunities are always arising,'' he said.
``But it's a very important step for us.''
   American Brands' office products businesses have made it the
largest manufacturer of office supplies in the world, Rukeyser
said. Its divisions include Swingline and Day-Timers, he said.
   ``That's the kind of scale that we're trying to achieve in most
of the businesses,'' he said.
   The company's cigarette brands include Carlton, Lucky Strike,
Pall Mall, Tareyton and Malibu.
   In the liquor industry, American Brands owns Jim Beam bourbon,
DeKuype liqueurs and Gilbey's gin and vodka.

   Although a bomb extensively damaged London's Stock
Exchange Friday, it would take a large-scale computer failure to
interfere with stock trading in London.
   Because stock trading no longer takes place on the exchange's
floor but is now done via telephones and computers, the morning
explosion in a restroom near the exchange-floor viewing gallery
didn't disrupt business at the Stock Exchange's modern tower in the
heart of the City of London.
   ``If the purpose of this callous act was to bring the City
(financial district) to a halt, they have failed singularly,'' said
Andrew Hugh Smith, chairman of the Stock Exchange. ``Our systems
and services have functioned perfectly, and trading has continued
as normal.''
   Like other recent bombing incidents in Britain, this blast was
linked to the Irish Republican Army's campaign against British rule
in Northern Ireland.
   Earlier attacks have been largely directed at police, army and
government targets. The IRA, however, espouses a socialist future
for a united Ireland, and stock exchanges are considered an obvious
target for foes of capitalism.
   Exchanges employ entrance guards, bouncers and metal detactors
to protect themselves from attack.
   Despite the explosion, prices rose. The Financial Times-Stock
Exchange 100-share index was up 12.8 points, or 0.5 percent, at
2,400.1 at the close. Trading was active.
   Options trading was disrupted for the day, however. Although the
exchange building is now largely deserted, the ground-level trading
floor still houses the London Traded Options Market. Options are
the right to buy or sell shares at a fixed price before a specific
date.
   Since Britain's huge deregulation nearly four years ago _ known
as the Big Bang _ traders no longer physically congregate in one
place. Rather, designated investment firms make markets in
different stocks and bonds via an electronic market run with
computers.
   The exchange requires the 25 equities market makers to quote
prices continuously through the official trading day, which runs
from 8:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. London time. Trading also is allowed to
take place outside official hours.
   The market makers' prices appear on the exchange's computerized
price quotations system, SEAQ International, which buyers and
sellers can view on video display terminals.
   On the New York and Tokyo stock exchanges, trading physically
takes place on the floor, conducted by market makers known as
specialists.
   The London market is Europe's biggest and forms part of the
so-called ``Golden Triangle'' with New York and Tokyo.
   There are more than 2,500 British and overseas companies listed
on London's Stock Exchange. Average daily trading in domestic
stocks is worth about $1.5 billion.
   Formally called the International Stock Exchange of the United
Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland Ltd., it employs nearly 2,600
people who develop trading rules, list companies, record
transactions and operate information systems.
   The tower, one of 14 buildings the exchange occupies, opened in
1973. Located in Broad Street, it is next to the Bank of England
and across from the grand, columned Royal Exchange, which houses
the London International Financial Futures Exchange.
   The London exchange has been studying what it should do with all
its empty floor space. The options market plans to move out.

<TEXT>
   Financier Alan Bond has been making
money on borrowed money since completing his first land deal in
1960 at age 22. It appears the bill finally has come due.
   Thirty years after he took out a loan on five acres of land at
Perth in the first step toward building a multinational empire, the
businessman and yachtsman has offered to quit as chairman of his
flagship Bond Corp. Holdings Ltd. to appease the company's anxious
creditors, who are owed $6 billion.
   The agreement under which Bond will step down and relinquish
control of his vast empire was reached Thursday. Although final
details must still be worked out, the deal could clear the way for
refinancing arrangements that could ultimately save many of Bond's
businesses.
   It has been a long fall for Bond, known for brash and flamboyant
dealings in business and elsewhere. He financed the Australian
sailing team's stunning triumph over the United States in the 1983
America's Cup race.
   Only three years ago, he bought Vincent Van Gogh's ``Irises''
from Sotheby's for what was a then-record $53.9 million, a sale
that the auction house helped him finance. In March, he sold the
painting for an undisclosed amount amid reports he had taken a loss.
   Bond has never been lacking in confidence. After emigrating from
Britain with his father to Perth, in Western Australia state, he
quit school at age 14 and took a job with a sign-painting company,
convincing the owner to take him on even though he did poorly on a
spelling test.
   When things didn't work out, he and his father started a
competitor, Nu-Signs, that provided the cash for some of his later
deals.
   According to the biography released this week by journalist Paul
Barry, ``The Rise and Fall of Alan Bond,'' the financier developed
a strategy of keeping creditors at bay while buying and selling
land in rapidly developing Perth.
   He reportedly was close to bankruptcy in 1962 after stringing
along Nu-Signs' creditors too long, but managed to work out an
arrangement at the last minute. The next day, he made a large
purchase at a land auction.
   Barry wrote that with rising land prices, Bond often would agree
to buy a plot, promising a small deposit, then have it immediately
revalued at a higher price so he could borrow more money than had
to be paid to the vendor.
   With a flair for picking the best development sites and
promoting them well, he had been successful enough to make his
first $1 million by 1969 at age 29.
   He took advantage of eager bankers peddling expensive credit,
particularly after Australia's financial deregulation in 1983, and
a stock market full of hungry investors.
   At its peak, Bond Corp. Holdings included interests in brewing,
media, natural resources and property. He rode out the 1987 stock
market crash on the cash-generating strength of his beer businesses.
   That actually may have led to his downfall, however, as Bond
Corp. Holdings picked up steam and eventually ran up debts now
estimated at about $6 billion.
   Rising interest rates and bad business decisions alienated
Bond's bankers and creditors, put his Australian brewing interests
into receivership and has forced him to sell assets ranging from a
Hong Kong office development to a coal mine.
   There is speculation that the final straw for Bond may have come
when he tangled with London-based financier R.W. ``Tiny'' Rowland.
He bought 20.4 percent of Rowland's Lonrho PLC in 1988 in a move
that appeared to presage a takeover attempt.
   He was forced to sell a year later, telling Australian
television that he ``underestimated the venom on Tiny Rowland,''
who waged a campaign focusing on Bond's debt.
   Rowland is quoted in Barry's book as saying he decided to
destroy Bond after the Australian tried to take his yacht's parking
place on the French Riviera.

   Chrysler Corp. proposed a
multi-employer health-care system Friday as it joined the rest of
the Big Three automakers in contract negotiations with the United
Auto Workers union.
   But the proposal drew a cool reception from General Motors
Corp., which opened negotiations with the UAW on Wednesday, and
Ford Motor Co., which began contract talks Thursday. The UAW
offered no reaction Friday.
   Chrysler Vice President Anthony St. John said at a news
conference following a ceremonial handshake to open talks that he
proposes forming a trust to administer health-care programs for
employees of several companies, including auto suppliers.
   Negotiators from each of the Big Three say containing
health-care costs is a high priority in the current round of talks.
In 1989, GM said it spent about $3 billion in health care costs,
Ford spent about $813 million and Chrysler paid $684 million.
   St. John said under a multi-employer program, the size of the
group covered by the plan could be huge, keeping costs down. He
said participating companies could also avoid anticipated higher
costs in 1993 when new Financial Accounting Standards Board
regulations may take effect.
   The new regulations would require companies to set aside money
for anticipated health costs. Chrysler figures that would be about
$7 per hour per employee or just under $200 million a year.
   Chrysler says it currently pays for heath care and pension costs
on a pay-as-you-go basis.
   Chrysler, in the worst financial shape of the Big Three, is
expected to report by the end of the month that its second-quarter
earnings were about half of the $341 million it made during the
period last year.
   Wall Street analysts have speculated that Chrysler will lose
money in the third quarter because its two minivan plants will be
shut down for a month each to retool for 1991 models. The minivan
is Chrysler's most profitable vehicle.
   Chrysler has acknowledged it expects a ``substantial''
third-quarter loss.
   GM, Ford and union negotiators so far have declined to talk
about proposals which may have been advanced in the earliest stages
of the talks. UAW contracts with each of the Big Three expire Sept.
14.
   In addition to the health-care proposal, St. John said he
proposed an employee ownership plan, which he declined to detail,
and something he called gain sharing, which would reward workers on
a plant-by-plant basis based on the financial performance of that
factory.
   In a separate news conference, UAW President Owen Bieber said
the union issued the same broad proposals Friday as it had at GM
and Ford the two days before. Those involved the need for more job
security, wage and pension improvements and more time off.
   If negotiations proceed as they have in the past, the UAW will
bargain with all three companies until sometime around Labor Day,
and then select a strike target. Talks at the other two companies
would be suspended.
   A contract reached at the target then would be taken to the
other two companies in what is called ``pattern bargaining.''
   There has been speculation Chrysler may break the pattern
because of its financial problems. St. John has said simply rolling
over the current contract would add 16 percent to the company's
labor costs.
   Bieber said Friday the union had no intention of giving up its
pattern bargaining strategy.
   ``Abandoning the pattern concept will not solve problems,'' he
said. ``It will create even more. Chrysler would gain nothing, but
lose a great deal of morale.''

<HEAD>Analysts Say Restructuring of Parent Won't Solve Heileman's
Financial Woes</HEAD>

   G. Heileman Brewing Co., Australian
entrepreneur Alan Bond's best-known U.S. business, has serious
financial problems that a reorganization of its parent won't help,
analysts say.
   Bond agreed to resign as chairman of his Bond Corp. Holdings
Ltd. to appease creditors, under an agreement announced Thursday.
   The resignation was part of a plan for refinancing arrangements,
company director Peter Lucas said in disclosing the pact after a
bondholders meeting in London.
   Heileman officials said Bond's financial problems do not affect
Heileman directly because the brewer has its own loan arrangements,
currently being renegotiated with creditors.
   Bond Corp. Holdings' Australian brewery assets will be sold for
about $1.4 billion to Bell Resources, an independently managed
affiliate of Bond Corp. Holdings. Heileman would not be included in
the sale, Lucas said.
   ``Bell Resources has felt that the maximum capacity in the
brewing industry that it could undertake ought to be restricted to
the Australian assets at this time,'' he said. ``It (Heileman) is
going to remain with Bond Corporation.''
   New leadership at Bond Holdings won't help Heileman with its own
debt problems, said George Thompson, an analyst with
Prudential-Bache.
   ``There's nothing I can think of that is going to solve the
problem at G. Heileman,'' Thompson said. ``No matter who it was,
they're confronted with an extraordinarily difficult task and a
change of management is not going to make a difference.''
   The La Crosse, Wis.-based company has been strapped by debt
created when Bond bought the company in 1987 for $1.3 billion.
   Analysts have said he paid too much for the brewer and cannot
service the $850 million debt with Heileman earnings.
   The brewer has closed or sold several of its breweries over the
past few months to pay its bills.
   Heileman _ which produces Old Style, Lone Star, Rainier, Henry
Weinhard, Colt 45 and Special Export Light _ is the No. 5 U.S.
brewer. The company also produces Kingsbury, a nonalcoholic brew,
and La Croix sparkling water, the No. 2 domestic bottled water.
   Robert S. Weinberg, a St. Louis marketing consultant, said
Bond's resignation and his company's restructuring may have an
indirect impact on Heileman.
   ``If it has any impact, the Bond Company's reorganization would
spur a reorganization of Heileman's assets,'' he said.

<HEAD>Subject of Federal Probe Into Defense Contractors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAT MILTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BETHPAGE, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   John O'Brien, who resigned suddenly as
head of the Grumman Corp., is under investigation by a federal
grand jury for possibly accepting loans from a Grumman defense
subcontractor, a source said Friday.
   A grand jury at U.S. District Court in Uniondale has been
hearing testimony for about a year, the source told The Associated
Press. The case stems from a broader investigation by the U.S.
Justice Department into wrongdoing in defense contracting.
   Records seized at the offices of the late James Kane, a Grumman
defense subcontractor, indicated that O'Brien and family members
accepted more than $450,000 in loans and loan guarantees from Kane,
the source said.
   It would be a violation of federal anti-kickback laws for a
defense contractor to accept loans from a subcontractor.
   The source, who is close to the investigation and spoke on
condition of anonymity, called O'Brien a ``subject'' rather than a
``target'' of the grand jury investigation, and said no indictment
was imminent.
   ``Being a subject doesn't mean that he won't ultimately be
charged,'' the source said. ``But right now the net is very broad.''
   Newsday, which reported the nature of the investigation Friday,
noted that O'Brien denied wrongdoing in May when the newspaper
asked him whether he or people closely associated with him had
taken loans from Kane.
   ``Because this is a pending investigation, it is not prudent for
me to discuss the facts,'' he said then. ``However, I want to
assure you that I have every reason to believe that when all the
facts are known it will be clear that there has been no wrongdoing
on my part.''
   O'Brien could not be located Friday to comment. Grumman
spokesman Robert Harwood said he did not know where O'Brien was. A
call to the offices of Brendan Sullivan, reported to be O'Brien's
lawyer, was not returned.
   Harwood said he could neither confirm nor deny the existence of
an investigation. He declined to comment on the reasons for
O'Brien's departure from the aerospace giant, beyond the company
statement.
   Kane, who died of cancer in February, was thought to be a
central figure in a scheme to bribe Pentagon officials for defense
contracts. Kane and O'Brien were friends, and Kane founded and
operated the Long Island Aerospace Political Action Committee, a
lobby group for Grumman.
   O'Brien, Grumman's chairman and chief executive officer for the
past two years, was under pressure to quit from the Grumman board,
the source said. That pressure increased as the investigation
intensified in the last few months.
   ``They felt if charges were eventually brought against O'Brien
it would do more damage to the company to have him in place than
out,'' the source said.
   Newsday quoted a former Grumman board member, Orville L.
Freeman, as saying that he was told the board wanted O'Brien out.
   O'Brien, 60, cited ``personal reasons'' in resigning Thursday at
the board's regular meeting. He was replaced immediately by Renso
Caporali, 57, a Grumman vice chairman.
   The source said the grand jury has subpoenaed ``many records''
from Grumman over the last few months. O'Brien has not been called
to testify before the panel.
   ``Generally, the activity has been increasing,'' the source said.
   Mary Jo White, spokeswoman for Andrew Maloney, the U.S. Attorney
for the Eastern District of New York, declined to comment.

<HEAD>Kerkorian Pockets $180 Million Toward Pathe Purchase of MGM-UA</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By E. SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CULVER CITY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kirk Kerkorian pocketed $180 million
in deposit money Friday as part of his deal to sell MGM-UA
Communications Co. to Italian financier Giancarlo Parretti.
   Kerkorian, a Beverly Hills billionaire who became rich buying
and selling planes and casinos, received $4 per share for his
MGM-UA stock, as did other MGM-UA shareholders.
   He owns about 35 million of MGM-UA's 51 million shares of common
stock, and 10 million shares of preferred stock. He established a
foundation last year to which he gave another 5 million shares of
the common.
   Parretti's Pathe Communications Corp. has agreed to buy MGM-UA
for $21.50 per share, or $1.3 billion.
   He had been making non-refundable down payments since March, for
a total of $253 million. That money was sent to shareholders and
holders of options to buy shares Friday, with the lion's share to
Kerkorian. The remaining $17.50 per share is due in October.
   ``The money's good, and we're in the process of making the
distribution,'' said Scott Tagliarino, MGM-UA's spokesman.
   MGM-UA's common stock was unchanged Friday at $18.25 per share
on the New York Stock Exchange.
   MGM-UA has been on the auction block for two years. Australia's
Qintex Group bid $1.5 billion for it last year, $100 million more
than media magnate Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. But Qintex missed a
$50 million down payment and the deal fell apart.
   Parretti desperately needs financing help for his purchase. Time
Warner Inc. agreed April 9 to lend him $650 million in return for a
lien on the valuable United Artists library and extensive movie
distribution rights.
   But that agreement also collapsed, and Time Warner and Pathe
have filed countersuits seeking hundreds of millions of dollars
each for alleged breach of contract.
   Despite his $253 million in down payments, there is considerable
skepticism that Parretti can come up with the rest of the money.
   ``He's waited four months and now we're into the fifth month and
we're not any closer to the conclusion of the transaction than we
were at the start,'' said Jeffrey Logsdon, an analyst with Siedler
Amdec Securities Inc. in Los Angeles.
   Pathe had offered $20 per share, about $1.2 billion, for MGM-UA
but was unable to raise the money in time for the closing date a
month ago. In return for a four-month extension on the deal,
Parretti raised his offer to $21.50 per share and to the
$4-per-share distribution.
   Under the latest agreement, Parretti must make another $50
million deposit on Aug. 21, $50 million on Sept. 20, and come up
with the balance by Oct. 23.
   The $100 million in additional down payments is to be put into
escrow. Along with it goes 11.9 million new, unregistered shares of
MGM-UA common stock in Pathe's name, 2.3 million after the August
payment is made, another 9.6 million after the September payment.
   That money and stock would be the subject of litigation if the
latest deal between Parretti and Kerkorian falls apart.

<HEAD>Caterpillar Announces Earnings Slumped in Second Quarter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BILL VOGRIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PEORIA, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Caterpillar Inc. on Friday reported a 67
percent drop in second-quarter earnings, but said no layoffs or pay
cuts are planned to offset the company's plunging profits.
   Caterpillar, the world's largest manufacturer of construction
equipment, reported earnings of $46 million or 46 cents per share,
down from $141 million or $1.39 per share in the same period of
1989.
   Profits slumped despite revenue levels that are the second
highest for any quarter in the company's 75-year history.
   Revenue for the quarter totaled $2.95 billion, a 3 percent drop
from the same period last year when Caterpillar had a record $3.04
billion in revenue.
   The company had projected plunging profits in June, but that
made the results no easier to stomach.
   ``The quarter turned out about exactly the way we had said it
would in the revised outlook,'' said Caterpillar spokesman Gil
Nolde.
   ``Results are not satisfactory, no question about that.
Forty-six million dollars profit on sales of $2.95 billion is not
good.''
   It was the fifth consecutive quarter in which Caterpillar
profits have fallen below performance in the same period of the
previous year.
   Nolde disputed rumors circulating the company about possible pay
cuts or layoffs as cost-saving measures, labeling the employees'
concerns ``absolutely unfounded.''
   ``There are no such plans, I can say that categorically,'' Nolde
said.
   On June 25, Caterpillar announced that new economic policies in
Brazil, where Caterpillar employs 5,100 workers at two plants, were
having a disastrous impact on company finances.
   The Brazil operations provided a reported 20 percent of
Caterpillar's 1989 profits.
   Because of the Brazilian government's efforts to slow inflation
and increase competition, Caterpillar said its second-quarter
earnings would be less than half the $99 million earned in the
first quarter.
   Nolde said Friday the Brazil turmoil accounted for about 25
percent of the company's reduced profits.
   The company said about half of its decline in profit was caused
by an 8 percent drop in sales volume, which Nolde attributed to
reduced demand for construction equipment in industrialized nations.
   Caterpillar's remaining troubles have resulted from a weaker
Japanese yen and higher operating costs.
   One bright spot was a $19 million improvement in revenue from
Caterpillar's financial subsidiaries.
   For the first six months of the year, Caterpillar's profits
stood at $145 million, a decline of $137 million from last year.
Profit per share was $1.43, compared to $2.78 for the first six
months of 1989.
   Revenue for the first half totaled $5.8 billion, an improvement
of $163 million, or 3 percent, from last year.
   Caterpillar also disclosed that a class-action lawsuit was filed
in federal court on Wednesday by New York stockholder Dorothy Kas.
   The lawsuit accused the company of misleading investors by
withholding pertinent information and lying about its financial
condition in the first two quarters of this year to attract
investors.
   ``Our lawyers have advised that we not discuss second-quarter
results other than what's in the news release,'' Nolde said. ``We
believe the suit is without merit, but we can't discuss it further
at this time.''

   New disappointments in high-technology profits
helped send stock prices into a sharp decline Friday after the Dow
Jones industrial average made another short-lived run past the
3,000 level.
   Dow Jones's average of 30 blue chips fell 32.67 to 2,961.14,
finishing the week with a net loss of 19.06 points.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 5 to 3 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
585 up, 912 down and 513 unchanged.
   Late last week, Monday and Tuesday, and again at midsession
Friday, the Dow Jones industrials crossed 3,000, only to turn back
quickly.
   The earlier pullbacks proved to be shallow, and brokers said
bullish traders weren't discouraged for long. But they seemed to
run short on patience Friday afternoon as resistance at 3,000
remained stubborn.
   The late drop gathered momentum when Texas Instruments reported
second-quarter earnings of 2 cents a share, down from $1.14 in the
like period last year, marking another in a recent series of profit
disappointments at technology companies.
   TI, citing sluggish conditions in the market for semiconductors,
also said it faced the possibility of posting a loss in the third
quarter.
   Texas Instruments shares fell 5} to 33&lsqb;.
   Advanced Micro Devices, which posted a 10-cents-a-share loss for
the second quarter, tumbled 1} to 7\.
   Storage Technology led the active list with an even bigger drop,
down 8} at 25} after the company made a downbeat appraisal of its
earnings prospects for the year.
   Among other prominent computer and technology stocks,
International Business Machines fell 2&rsqb; to 117|; Digital Equipment
1} to 81&lsqb;; Compaq Computer 3\ to 60\, and Hewlett-Packard 1~ to 45&rsqb;.
   Elsewhere in the blue-chip sector, Boeing dropped 1 to 58;
General Electric 1 to 74; Exxon 1&rsqb; to 48|; American Express } to
30{, and Ford Motor ~ to 43\.
   Browning-Ferris Industries, also among the volume leaders,
dropped 1{ to 42&lsqb;. The company reported slightly higher quarterly
earnings on Thursday, but the gain was a shade smaller than had
been expected.
   An exception to the general trend was Suave Shoe, up 1&lsqb; at 10&lsqb;
on sharply higher quarterly profits.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 177.81 million
shares, against 161.99 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 213.39 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $29.53 billion, or 0.85
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped 1.73 to 197.65.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 4.51 to 428.69, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was down 3.71 at 361.61.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
slumped 2.90 to 455.27. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 360.45, down 1.39.

   People in the heart of the Cornbelt believe
farmers produce healthy food but don't think the farmers do a good
job helping protect the environment, according to a survey released
Friday.
   The survey found that 65 percent of the people surveyed think
the dangers of pesticides outweigh their benefits and that 15
percent want all farm chemicals banned.
   The Illinois Farm Bureau commissioned the April telephone survey
of 400 Champaign County residents.
   ``Farmers are interested in people's attitudes ... on using the
technology that's been put into their hands,'' said Dennis Vercler,
spokesman for the Farm Bureau.
   Vercler said farmers are concerned about food safety and the
environment, and many have changed their farming practices to
reflect that attitude. Yet, many people are unaware of such changes
because farmers have not told them, he said.
   ``They should acknowledge that people's concerns are real, even
if they don't feel they are justified by the actual risks
involved,'' said Vercler. ``Farmers need to communicate better with
consumers and deal with their perceptions.''
   Vercler was joined at a news conference at the edge of a corn
field by Champaign County farmers who are working to protect the
environment. A display board showed photographs of their new
practices.
   The Farm Bureau survey found that 51 percent of the people
surveyed strongly agree that farmers produce healthy food but that
just 16 percent strongly think farmers are protecting the
environment.
   Farmers, though, have the most to lose if they are careless with
pesticides or allow chemicals to pollute water and contaminate
food, said Tom Wolf, who raises grain.
   ``I live here with my family, and I'm concerned about our
safety,'' said Wolf. ``And I don't want the next generation to have
any problems farming the land.''
   The Champaign County survey was similar to a national poll
conducted by the American Farm Bureau Federation and released
earlier this week.
   Other findings in the Champaign County survey:
   _Sixty percent of the people said they were very concerned about
pesticides in drinking water.
   _Forty-nine percent of the respondents said farmers use too
large a volume of chemicals and 14 percent said they use far too
much.
   _Twenty-nine percent said farmers are too easily persuaded by
chemical companies to use more pesticides, and 26 percent said
farmers favor economics over safety.
   _Thirty-seven percent said they think the trend among farmers is
to use more chemicals.
   Actually, from 1978 to 1988, farmers cut their use of herbicides
by 21 percent and insecticides by 60 percent in response to both
environmental and economic concerns, the Farm Bureau said.

   The dollar turned in a mixed performance Friday,
ending slightly lower in domestic trading against every major
currency but the Japanese yen and Canadian dollar.
   Gold prices were mixed in New York after falling overseas.
   Republic National Bank quoted a bid for gold of $360.75 a troy
ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, up 35 cents from Thursday's after-hours
bid. Earlier, gold for current delivery lost 10 cents to $361.30 an
ounce on the Commodity Exchange.
   Karen Gibbs, senior financial futures analyst at Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc. in Chicago, said currency trading was light and
choppy largely because of uncertainty about the direction of the
U.S. economy.
   The dollar turned in its strongest performance against the
Japanese yen.
   Dealers said traders sold the yen for dollars and West German
marks after Japanese money supply figures dashed hopes among some
traders that Japanese authorities would move soon to lower the
discount rate.
   Masayuki Takaura, senior foreign exchange manager at Sanwa Bank
Ltd. in London, said the yen was due for a modest correction after
recent gains. However, he said the dollar's move through 148.50 yen
in early European dealings helped spark a flurry of stop-loss
dollar buying.
   Dean Witter's Gibbs said she feels ``the path of least
resistance is still down for the dollar.''
   She said that the Federal Reserve's relaxation of credit
conditions a week ago made U.S. interest rates ``unattractive
globally'' and that Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan's expressed
willingness to lower rates further if a budget compromise is
reached and the economy remains weak keeps downward pressure on the
dollar.
   She said Greenspan's remarks showed ``they are not going to
tighten and that would be the only thing making the dollar more
attractive.''
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose to 148.35 Japanese yen from 147.60 yen
Thursday. The dollar was quoted later in London at 148.90 yen. In
New York, the dollar rose to 148.65 yen from 148.09 yen late
Thursday.
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.8140 from $1.8155 late
Thursday. In New York, the pound rose to $1.8185 from $1.8165.
   Late dollar rates in New York, compared with late rates
Thursday, included: 1.6385 West German marks, down from 1.6408;
1.4043 Swiss francs, down from 1.4060; 5.4965 French francs, down
from 5.5045; 1,200.00 Italian lire, down from 1,201.75; and 1.15495
Canadian dollars, up from 1.15235.
   Selected late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates
Thursday, included: 1.6410 West German marks, down from 1.6430;
1.4070 Swiss francs, down from 1.4090; 5.5045 French francs, down

Italian lire, down from 1,203.00, and 1.1565 Canadian dollars, up
from 1.1535.
   Gold fell in London to $361.25 a troy ounce, down from $362.75
late Thursday. In Zurich, gold fell to $361.50 an ounce from
$362.20 late Thursday.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold fell 66 cents to $361.63 per ounce.
   Silver for current delivery fell 0.003 cent to $4.848 a troy
ounce on the Commodity Exchange in New York. Silver fell to $4.87 a
troy ounce in London, down from $4.88 late Thursday.

   Crude oil futures prices were mostly higher
Friday due largely to technical factors.
   The August contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude, rose 62 cents to $19.61 a 42-gallon barrel on
the New York Mercantile Exchange, after rising 44 cents a barrel
Thursday.
   But contract prices for later months were up by far less or down
slightly. Frank P. Knuettel, an energy analyst at Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc., said this shows the trading was dominated by
technical factors involving the August contract.
   Traders said rumors circulated that the 13-member Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries had agreed to limit production
until crude prices reach $20 a barrel. The rumors may have helped
boost prices.
   The OPEC ministers are to meet next Thursday to discuss
production cuts.
   Also Friday, the United Arab Emirates rejected accusations by
Iraq that it was exceeding its OPEC quotas. The two OPEC members
have been involved in a dispute over Iraqi claims that the UAE is
pumping oil from Iraqi territory.
   News that the flow of crude through the Alaska pipeline resumed
at normal levels had a moderating influence on prices, but it soon
was surpassed by concern about OPEC reaching an agreement on
output, traders said.
   On Thursday, operators of the pipeline took steps to shut it
down over an air quality dispute. But operations were restored to
normal Thursday night after the operators and state regulators
agreed to negotiate and after a federal judge temporarily blocked
enforcement of a pollution-related ban on operating the pipeline.
   Prices for refined products traded on the mercantile exchange
ended the day lower.
   Unleaded regular gasoline for August delivery fell 0.11 cent to
62.96 cents a gallon, while later contract months were even lower.
   The August contract for home heating oil fell 0.59 cent to close
at 55.79 cents a gallon, with subsequent months down by lesser
amounts.
   In natural gas trading, the August contract closed at $1.426 per
1,000 cubic feet, down from $1.445 Thursday.

<HEAD>Regulators Approve Northeast Takeover of Public Service</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CONCORD, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State regulators on Friday approved a $2.3
billion takeover plan and a new rate structure for Public Service
Company of New Hampshire, paving the way for the utility to emerge
from bankruptcy.
   The Public Utilities Commission's 200-page report, following 21
days of hearings ended in late May, found Connecticut-based
Northeast Utilities' acquisition ``consistent with the public
good.''
   The reorganization plan's rate agreement projects seven annual
rate increases of 5.5 percent beginning in 1990. Testimony during
commission hearings that rates actually could go as high as 8.5
percent prompted a public criticism of the deal, which was approved
by the state Legislature.
   Special Commissioner John Nassikas, appointed to oversee the
hearings, said the commission was confident assumptions behind the
5.5 percent figures are realistic.
   ``I would hasten to add that there's no guarantee that this
would be a 5.5 percent increase over the seven-year life,''
Nassikas said. ``It would be irrational to say ... that their
projections are invulnerable and that you're not going to have an
increase over 5.5 percent.''
   Leading Democrats and the Campaign For Ratepayers' Rights said
that's just what they were worried about.
   ``I think we will clearly see in the future rate hikes far in
excess of the 5.5 percent,'' said state House Minority Leader Mary
Chambers, D-Etna.
   She said commissioners ``clearly were going to rubber-stamp what
has already been agreed to by the governor, Northeast and the
Republican leadership in the Legislature.''
   The Campaign for Ratepayers' Rights is considering appealing the
decision to the state Supreme Court, said interim director Robert
Cushing.
   Gov. Judd Gregg in a statement called the rate agreement ``a
major victory for New Hampshire ratepayers that will save hundreds
of millions of dollars.'' He said, with the Seabrook nuclear power
plant now running, rates would have been significantly higher if
there were no rate agreement.
   Commission approval was needed to allow Public Service to emerge
from bankruptcy and pay back its creditors. Shortly after
Northeast's plan was approved in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in April,
the management of Public Service was taken over by a
Northeast-appointed board.
   ``Clearly, we're going to spend a lot of hours combing the
report, but our first indication is that it's a very positive
development for ending this 2{ year bankruptcy,'' said Northeast
spokesman Jeffrey Kotkin. ``It's a long, involved decision _ which
is right because it was a long, involved _ and at times torturous _
process.''
   The bankruptcy court approval is under appeal and the commission
allows 20 days for appeals to be filed on its decision. Once both
decisions are final, Public Service officially will be out of
bankruptcy.
   The actual merger of Northeast with Public Service won't be
complete until it gains necessary federal approvals, including that
of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission expected by next spring.

<HEAD>Bankruptcy Case Turned Over To Judge Critical of Asbestos Trust</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge highly critical of the Manville
trust fund was granted broad powers Friday that could ensure his
ability to overhaul the system for paying asbestos victims.
   In an order by the chief judge of federal courts in southern New
York, U.S. District Judge Jack B. Weinstein received the power to
rule on any bankruptcy court appeal involving Manville Corp.'s 1988
reorganization or the trust.
   The future of the $3 billion trust, created as part of
Manville's court reorganization, has been up in the air since it
disclosed it had run out of money to pay 130,000 pending and any
new claims. Asbestos lawsuits represent the largest product
liability litigation in U.S. history.
   ``It's essential to get some case management going in these
problems,'' Chief Judge Charles L. Brieant said in a telephone
interview from his office in suburban White Plains. ``These cases
have been pending a long time.''
   Brieant said the bankruptcy case remained before U.S. Bankruptcy
Judge Burton R. Lifland but that Weinstein now was supervising with
power to transfer any appeal to his own courtroom.
   Weinstein last week ordered a plan to be drawn up by Aug. 6 to
refinance and restructure the trust. He also froze all payments by
the trust until the plan was ready.
   Separately, Thomas D. Lambros, chief judge for U.S. District
Court in Cleveland, this week consolidated more than 100,000
pending lawsuits nationwide against the Manville trust and about 40
companies that made and distributed asbestos.
   Lambros on Friday clarified his interim order, saying it
preserved current court jurisdictions pending discussions on ``the
possibility of achieving a universal resolution through a national
class action.''
   Lambros scheduled a Nov. 1 hearing. He said judges, plaintiffs
and defense lawyers, and claimants would meet before then to try
and reach a solution.
   The order giving Weinstein expanded power over the Manville
bankruptcy case and the reorganization of the trust rebuffs
plaintiffs lawyers who don't want the trust's payment mechanism
altered. Weinstein and Lambros both have criticized the amount of
trust money that has gone to lawyers.
   One attorney, Eugene Locks of Philadelphia, filed a motion
challenging Weinstein's authority Friday with the 2nd Circuit Court
of Appeals in Manhattan.
   Another challenge was filed earlier this week in district court
on behalf of 1,100 Virginia shipyard workers who already have
settled with the trust and don't want $60 million in payments
delayed. That motion also seeks to bar restructuring of the trust.
   ``Hasn't this Manville bankruptcy been consummated? If so, even
the bankruptcy judge has no authority to restructure or refinance
the (trust),'' said Richard Glasser, a Norfolk, Va., attorney
representing the workers.
   Weinstein has called for replacing the trust's current scheme
processing claims on a first-come, first-served basis with one that
takes into account the severity of disease and the financial need
of victims.
   Asbestos was widely used for decades in shipbuilding,
construction and other industries for its natural insulation and
heat-resistant properties. Workers who breathed asbestos fibers
have contracted lung cancer and other severe and often-fatal
diseases.
   Manville, once the nation's largest asbestos maker, sought
bankruptcy court protection in 1982 because of thousands of
lawsuits seeking compensation. Under its reorganization, Manville
is separate from the trust but must contribute regular payments
starting in 1991.
   The trust has paid $974 million to settle more than 22,300 cases
so far at an average of $43,000 per claim but is out of cash to pay
new claims.
   Manville spokesman Don Ferguson said the company would cooperate
with the courts on all issues.

<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices fell sharply Friday on the
Chicago Board of Trade amid forecasts for a weekend of beneficial
rain in the Midwest, where crop weather has been nearly perfect for
most of the summer.
   Corn and wheat futures closed lower; oats were narrowly mixed.
   On other commodity markets, petroleum futures were mixed;
livestock and meat futures were mixed; copper futures rose; and
precious metals slipped.
   Soybean futures settled 13{ cents to 19 cents lower with the
contract for delivery in August at $5.91 a bushel, its lowest
settlement since June 15.
   Wheat futures finished { cent to 4 cents lower with September at
$3.00 a bushel; corn was 1 cent to 2{ cents lower with September at
$2.59\ a bushel; oats were \ cent lower to { cent higher with
September at $1.21} a bushel.
   All contracts for July deliveries of grains and soybeans expired
at 1 p.m. EDT on the Board of Trade.
   Crop prices have been falling since late June, largely due to a
pattern of mild temperatures and frequent precipitation in the
nation's midsection that has facilitated corn and soybean
development.
   This week, showers began watering Midwestern croplands Wednesday
night, continued into Friday and were expected to spread during the
weekend into the Mississippi Delta region, a soybean production
area that has been fairly dry.
   After the close, the National Weather Service issued a new
six-to-10-day forecast predicting normal to above-normal
temperatures and normal rainfall in the Midwest during the five
days beginning next Thursday.
   The recent weather also been friendly to the corn crop, which is
nearing the halfway point of its pollination phase,
   Gerald Zusel, manager of Balfour Maclaine Corp.'s floor
operations at the exchange, said corn fields have received enough
precipitation to get the crop through the critical period without
harm.
   ``The corn crop is basically made,'' he said. ``The only thing
that could hurt the crop now is an early frost.''
   Near-term crude oil futures advanced on the New York Mercantile
Exchange on expectations that OPEC members will agree next week on
actions to shore up crude prices.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 9 cents lower to 62
cents higher with the August contract, which expired Friday, at
$19.61 a barrel; heating oil was .36 cent to .59 cent lower with
August at 55.79 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .03 cent to
.40 cent lower with August at 62.96 cents a gallon.
   Frozen pork belly futures rebounded from a steep opening drop to
close moderately lower on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Bellies had fallen sharply in the two previous sessions due to
slack demand for bacon, which is made from pork bellies.
   After the close, the Agriculture Department released a monthly
cold storage report that was expected to prompt renewed selling of
belly futures Monday.
   The report showed 88.1 million pounds of frozen pork bellies on
hand as of June 30, about 1.8 million pounds more than the market
had expected. The amount compares with 105.5 million pounds a month
earlier and 126.7 million pounds a year ago.
   Cattle and hog futures ended mostly higher ahead of the USDA's
monthly and quarterly cattle-on-feed reports.
   Both reports showed 1 percent more cattle on feed as of July 1
than on the same date a year ago, confirming industry expectations.
The report was expected to have little impact on futures prices.
   Live cattle settled .13 cent to .35 cent higher with August
76.42 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent lower to .45 cent
higher with August at 87.75 cents a pound; live hogs were .10 cent
to .65 cent higher with July, which expired Friday, at 63.90 cents
a pound; frozen pork bellies were .07 cent to 1.22 cents lower with
July at 45.87 cents a pound.
   Copper futures rallied on New York's Commodity Exchange after
the market refused to break on bearish news that representatives of
striking miners at an Asarco Inc. mine in Arizona had reached a
tentative labor pact to be voted on Saturday. The miners have been
on strike since July 1.
   Copper futures settled 1.7 cents to 1.9 cents higher with July
at $1.215 a pound.
   Precious metals edged lower on the Commodity Exchange. Gold
settled 10 cents to 20 cents lower with August at $362 a troy
ounce; silver was 0.3 cent to 0.9 cent lower with July at $4.848 a
troy ounce.

<HEAD>Boeing Talking with Aeritalia, Aerospatiale About Selling de
Havilland</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE TIBBITS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Boeing Co., which has never been content with
its de Havilland commuter aircraft division, said Friday it is
discussing selling the Canadian operation to Aeritalia of Italy and
Aerospatiale of France.
   Boeing Canada's de Havilland Division, based in Downsview,
Ontario, builds the Dash 8-series turboprop commuter plane. Boeing
bought de Havilland from the Canadian government in 1986, and
company executives have since made no secret of their
disappointment in the subsidiary's performance.
   Boeing corporate spokesman Paul Binder declined to give revenue
or earnings figures for de Havilland, which employs 5,400. But
industry analysts say it has been a money-loser.
   In a news release, Boeing said any sale would involve an orderly
transfer of responsibility to the buyers with continuing Boeing
support. A sale would be subject to approval of the Canadian
government, it said.
   Binder declined to elaborate beyond the company's two-paragraph
news release.
   ``At any time we get anything more firm, we will make an
announcement,'' he said.
   Representatives of Aerospatiale and Aeritalia, both
government-owned, could not be reached for comment.
   Aeritalia has long worked with Boeing to produce parts for
Boeing's 767 jetliners. Aerospatiale is one of the companies in the
European consortium Airbus Industrie, one of Boeing's prime
competitors for commercial jets.
   Aeritalia and Aerospatiale are partners in Avions de Transport
Regional, a company that produces the ATR 42 and ATR 72 turboprop
commuter planes.
   Boeing bought de Havilland for 90 million Canadian dollars, a
price critics said was too cheap.
   But Boeing has since invested more than 400 million Canadian
dollars in new plant facilities, equipment and research and
development, said de Havilland President Ron Woodward. Boeing also
brought millions of dollars of new business to de Havilland and
other Canadian divisions, meeting a provision of the purchase
agreement.
   Boeing officials believed de Havilland would be a good match,
despite the Canadian company's longstanding economic and labor
troubles. Boeing executives said de Havilland's commuter planes
would complement the Seattle plane builder's broad line of jet
aircraft.
   Boeing was able to boost de Havilland's production, but poor
profitability, continuing labor problems _ including an 11-week
strike in 1987 _ and needed improvements to the plant near Toronto
soured some company executives on the acquisition. Dean Thornton,
president of Boeing Commercial Airplane Group, has said he
personally regretted the purchase.
   Wolfgang Demisch, an aerospace analyst at Union Bank of
Switzerland in New York, estimated de Havilland's 1989 revenues at
$750 million, while Bill Whitlow of Dain Bosworth in Seattle pegged
it at $700 million. Both said Boeing has been losing money on the
division.
   ``I would guess that Boeing has come to the conclusion they're
not going to be able to turn it around as they'd like to,'' Whitlow
said.
   The commuter aircraft market ``has been ruthlessly
competitive,'' Demisch said, and Boeing hasn't been able to get the
prices it would like.
   Unlike large commercial jets, where only Boeing, Airbus and
McDonnell Douglas dominate, the market has 16 or more players.
Demisch and Whitlow said many of those companies are owned or
heavily subsidized by their governments, making it difficult for
private companies to compete.
   De Havilland builds the 36-40 passenger Dash 8-100 and the 50-56
passenger Dash 8-300. It plans to launch the 70-seat Dash 8-400
this December.
   It had a backlog of 125 aircraft as of June 30 and planned to
deliver 73 planes this year.
   Its planes compete directly with ATR's aircraft, Demisch said.
But he said Aeritalia and Aerospatiale may be seeking to broaden
their product mix in addition to absorbing a competitor.
   In February, Boeing settled a lawsuit against the Canadian
government over the de Havilland acquisition. The agreement,
Canadian Industry Minister Harvie Andre said, called for Boeing to
receive up to 161 million Canadian dollars in cash and incentives.
It also settled Boeing's claim that it had to spend more than 110
million Canadian dollars to improve health and safety at the
Downsview plant.
   Boeing had 1989 profits of $973 million on sales of $20.3
billion in 1989.

   Bond prices rose slightly Friday in light
trading as traders held ground because of uncertainty over the
federal budget.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond rose 3-16 point, or $1.88
per $1,000 face amount. Its yield, which falls when prices rise,
slipped to 8.53 percent from 8.55 percent late Thursday.
   The modest rally follows three consecutive declines in long-term
bond prices that lifted 30-year bond yields from 8.45 percent
earlier this week.
   Elizabeth Capo, a futures analyst with Stone &amp; McCarthy Research
Associates Inc. in Princeton, N.J., said prices moved up on
speculation that chances may be improving for a compromise on
reducing the federal budget deficit.
   But she also said traders were reluctant to stake out new
positions because of uncertainty on whether a compromise could be
reached before Congress recesses next month.
   Kathleen Camilli, chief economist for Ramirez Capital
Consultants Inc., said a report by the Federal Reserve Bank in
Philadelphia indicated regional economic conditions had softened
considerably.
   That led to speculation that the purchasing managers survey due
for release on Aug. 1 would point to economic deterioration.
   A declining economy makes it more likely that the Federal
Reserve will push interest rates lower, a development that would
boost bond prices.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
governments rose 1-32 point to \ point, intermediate maturities
rose 5-16 point and long-term issues added as much as 3-16 point,
according to Telerate Inc., a financial information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, gained 1.43 to 1,160.61.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 7.77 percent as the
discount dropped 1 basis point to 7.53 percent. Yields on six-month
bills rose to 7.84 percent as the discount gained 1 basis point to
7.45 percent. Yields on one-year bills were unchanged at 7.84
percent as the discount held at 7.33 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each
other on overnight loans, was quoted at 8 percent, unchanged from
late Thursday.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds up 3-32 point. The average yield to maturity
fell to 7.41 percent from 7.42 percent late Thursday.

<TEXT>
   Texas Instruments Inc., the second largest U.S.
semiconductor manufacturer, Friday reported sharply lower
second-quarter earnings and raised the possibility of a loss in the
third quarter.
   The Dallas-based company said net income in the period ended
June 30 fell from $106 million last year to $11 million this year.
Provisions for preferred stockholders further sliced income to $1
million, or 2 cents per common share, from $96 million, or $1.14.
Revenues dropped from $1.63 billion to $1.59 billion.
   The company blamed the results on ``sharply lower prices for
semiconductor memories and substantially higher start-up costs for
new products and capacity.''
   The news sent TI's stock tumbling on the New York Stock
Exchange, where shares closed at $33.12{, down $5.75.
   The second-quarter decline follows an 84.7 percent drop in
first-quarter earnings, when profit plummeted from $85 million to
$13 million as revenue went from $1.6 billion to $1.54 billion. TI
said it avoided a loss then only because of the sale of its
interest in another company.
   Chairman Jerry R. Junkins had warned stockholders in April
results would be unlikely to improve in the second quarter, and in
a letter Friday, he said the problems will continue.
   ``For TI, third-quarter results will be affected by continuing
research and development and start-up costs for new products with
minimal revenue ... and costs related to our Baguio plant,'' he
said. The semiconductor plant in the Philippines suffered minor
damage in this week's earthquake, but production was disrupted,
Junkins said.
   ``These factors will create additional pressure on TI's
financial performance in the near term and could cause a loss for
TI in the third quarter,'' he said.
   Junkins said the company is deferring some expenses to lessen
the impact, and will spend only $950 million in capital
expenditures this year instead of the projected $1 billion.
   The company also has been hit by decreases in defense spending,
and last month announced it would lay off 1,000 workers at its
Defense Systems &amp; Electronics Group, which employs about 22,000
people primarily in the United States.
   Junkins told stockholders Friday the defense market will
continue to drop in the first half of the 1990s, but the layoffs
should lessen the impact on company profits.
   For the first six months, TI reported earnings of $24 million
compared to $191 million last year. After preferred stock
dividends, income was $6 million, or 7 cents per share, down from
$171 million, or $2.04 last year.
   Revenue in the first six months dropped from $3.23 billion to
$3.13 billion.

   Federal regulators accused four West Germans

   The seven were identified in court papers filed in New York, one
week after the original charges were brought against ``individuals
or entities whose identities are as yet unknown.''
   The identities of some defendants remained unknown, said the
Securities and Exchange Commission in Washington.
   Last week the SEC said the suspects stood to make more than $1
million in alleged illegal profits on investments of $205,125.
   The SEC identified the individuals accused of trading on inside
information as: Ortwin Heider of Hofheim, West Germany; Hans-Jurgen
Klisch and Hannelore Mirbach-Krahn, both of Meerbusch and Bodo
Pawlik, of Ratingen, all in West Germany.
   They were accused of buying call options in Contel stock
one-to-two days before Contel and GTE announced their merger plan.
   A call option is the right to buy 100 shares of a stock or stock
index at a set price before a certain date.
   Call options are a way for an investor who thinks a stock's
price will rise sharply to profit on a smaller investment than it
would take to buy the stock itself.
   The merger was announced on Friday, July 13. The SEC alleged
that the defendants accounted for over 2,800 of 6,546 Contel call
options purchased on July 11 and 12. The total trading volume in
Contel call option contracts for the three preceding trading days
was 329 contracts, said the SEC.
   The call options were purchased through the New York offices of
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in the name of a Dusseldorf bank,
Simonbank, AG.
   Neither Dean Witter not Simonbank was accused of any wrongdoing.
   The new SEC complaint also identified three entities accused of
violating insider trading laws: Union Investment, a Dusseldorf
mutual fund; and two companies with offices in Switzerland, Nalasag
Corp. in Geneva, and Sigesse, S.A. in Lausanne.

   A savings and loan executive convicted
of looting a failed thrift of more than $15 million and using the
money to support a Rolls-Royce lifestyle was sentenced Friday to 20
years in prison.
   Janet Faye McKinzie, 41, of Newport Beach also was ordered by
U.S. District Court Judge Alicemarie Stotler to make restitution of
nearly $14 million taken from North America Savings &amp; Loan of Santa
Ana.
   ``It was a very, very appropriate sentence,'' said U.S. Attorney
Paul Seave. ``Fair in a sense that it works as a deterrent in other
S&amp;L crimes and white-collar crime in general.''
   Richard ``Racehorse'' Haynes, McKinzie's attorney, pleaded for
leniency.
   ``You want to see a grown man cry?'' he told the judge. ``Janet
McKinzie is paying the price for the S&amp;L bailout.''
   Haynes had portrayed his client as a ``washed-out zombie,''
hooked on prescription drugs given her by North America's chairman,
dentist Duayne Christensen, and duped into following Christensen's
orders.
   McKinzie had been the business manager for Christensen, who died
in a car crash just hours after federal regulators took over the
thrift in January 1987, declaring it insolvent.
   Christensen was named as an unindicted co-conspirator in
McKinzie's case.
   McKinzie, the first person to be convicted under the Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act in connection with a West
Coast savings and loan failure, appeared composed as her sentence
was read.
   She wept in March when she was convicted of 22 counts of
racketeering, conspiracy, bank fraud, wire fraud and interstate
transportation of stolen property. She had faced a maximum 175-year
prison term, but prosecutors asked for the term given.
   McKinzie, who held the title of consultant at North America, was
denied bail pending an appeal. She will be eligible for parole in
about seven years, Seave said.
   The North America case was considered among the top in the
widespread S&amp;L crisis ``in terms of how egregious the fraud was,''
William Davis, chief deputy of the California Department of Savings
and Loan, has said.
   The S&amp;L's collapse eventually cost taxpayers more than $120
million.
   Federal prosecutors had painted McKinzie and Christensen as a
modern-day Bonnie and Clyde, stealing millions from North America
to support their extravagant tastes.
   Each had a Rolls-Royce automobile, and they treated themselves
to such baubles as a $125,000 gold eagle statue, an $18,500 letter
opener and a $500 gold paper clip.
   McKinzie's 37th birthday was celebrated with a party at the
Newport Beach Marriott, where hundreds of guests were entertained
by Sammy Davis Jr. singing songs including ``Happy Birthday.''
   Following criminal investigations into North America's
operation, McKinzie was sued in February 1987 for acting with
Christensen to defraud the institution and causing its collapse.
   In March 1987, federal regulators operating the thrift estimated
the amount missing at $40 million. In June 1988, it was announced
North America would be closed and liquidated.
   Federal prosecutors employed the RICO statute so the government
could try to claim the proceeds from Christensen's $10 million life
insurance policy, which named McKinzie as sole beneficiary.
   Three of McKinzie's associates have pleaded guilty to criminal
charges in connection with alleged fraud at North America.

   Growing international sales of
ready-to-eat cereal helped Kellogg Co. post a 4.2 percent increase
in second-quarter profits, the world's largest cereal maker said
Friday.
   Kellogg, which makes cereal in 16 countries and sells it in more
than 130, said gains in those sales made up for sagging U.S.
results.
   Kellogg reported net income of $135.7 million, or $1.13 a share,
in the three months ending June 30, up from $129.7 million, or
$1.06 a share, in the second quarter of 1989.
   Net sales edged up to $1.26 billion from $1.23 billion in the
1989 period, the company said.
   ``The performance of our U.S. ready-to-eat cereal business was
down during the quarter,'' said William E. LaMothe, chairman and
chief executive officer. ``Growth of the category has slowed and
competition remains intense.''
   Competitors with popular oat-bran products narrowed Kellogg's
U.S. cereal market lead in 1989. LaMothe said the company expects
new products to widen the lead again.
   Kellogg introduced two health-oriented oriented cereals,
Heartwise and Oatbake, last fall, launched Kenmei Rice Bran in
January, and introduced Bigg Mixx multigrain cereal, marketed
mainly to children, in May.
   For the first six months of the year, Kellogg said it had net
earnings of $232 million, or $1.92 a share, on net sales of $2.47
billion, compared with $289.2 million, or $2.36 a share, on net
sales of $2.37 billion in the first half of 1989.

<TEXT>
   McDonald's Corp. reported Friday a 10
percent increase in second-quarter net income, due in part to an
increase in the number of overseas restaurants.
   Net income was $215.8 million, up from $196 million for the same
quarter last year. Earnings per share rose 11 percent to 59 cents
from 53 cents.
   Company officials also reported an increase in revenues in the
second quarter, from $1.5 billion in the 1989 period to $1.7
billion this year.
   McDonald's said this was the 101st consecutive quarter that the
company has reported record increases in operating results.
   ``Our growth strategy continues to focus on adding restaurants,
building sales at existing restaurants and improving international
profitability,'' said McDonald's chairman and chief executive
officer, Michael R. Quinlan.
   Quinlan said sales in restaurants inside the United States did
not increase as much as expected.
   ``Although U.S. sales are softer than expected, we continue to
see strong growth outside of the U.S.,'' he said.
   For the first six months of the year, McDonald's reported net
income of $373.9 million or $1.02 per share, up from $337.7 or 90
cents a share in the first six months of 1989. Revenues were $3.2
billion, up from $2.9 billion in the previous year.

   Six class-action lawsuits have been
filed against United Telecommunications Inc. accusing the company
of failing to keep market analysts and investors informed of
financial problems at the parent of US Sprint, a company spokesman
said Friday.
   On Tuesday, United Telecom reported its earnings fell 55 percent
in the second quarter, due largely to problems at Sprint, the
long-distance phone company of which it is majority owner. The
earnings report sent United Telecom's share price tumbling.
   Five of the suits were filed in U.S. District Court in Kansas
City, Kan., while the sixth was filed in federal court in Kansas
City, Mo., said Syd Courson, a Sprint spokesman. United Telecom had
no comment on the suits, he said.
