   Government supporters used clubs and
machetes Friday to chase away about 150 Sandinista peasants who
seized a Cabinet minister's ranch, a union leader said. Four people
were reported hurt.
   The seizure of the ranch had represented the latest challenge to
the U.S.-backed government by the leftist Sandinista opposition.
The peasants were retaliating for takeovers in recent weeks of
Sandinista cooperative farms.
   Leopoldo Siles Blanco, regional secretary of the pro-Sandinista
Farm Workers Association, told reporters late Friday that about 315
anti-Sandinista peasants retook the ranch belonging to Agriculture
Minister Roberto Rondon.
   Rondon's ranch near Juigalpa, 120 miles southeast of Managua,
was seized by members of the Sandinista-controlled association on
Wednesday.
   Siles Blanco said four of his people were injured. He gave no
details.
   Police had no immediate comment.
   ``This action is not going to frighten members of the
association, and in the next few hours they might take over other
ranches in the area,'' Siles Blanco said.
   In a second takeover Thursday night, about 60 Sandinistas seized
a private ranch also in the Juigalpa area.
   The government of President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro also
faced other threats Friday from the Sandinista opposition.
   In an effort to stave off a general strike, the government late
Friday increased salaries for about 65,000 government employees.
   Labor Minister Francisco Rosales announced at a news conference
a 60 percent increase for employees making $35 to $71 a month and a
flat $36 for those making more than $71.
   Rosales said the increases were part of an agreement reached
with the Sandinistas to raise government salaries in August to
compensate for inflation. Six people were killed and about 100
injured in clashes between Sandinista supporters and opponents in
the last Sandinista-led strike in July. The strikers erected
barricades, paralyzing Managua and disrupting the rest of the
nation.
   On Thursday, the 150,000-member National Workers Front
threatened its third labor action since the United National
Opposition coalition of Mrs. Chamorro took office on April 25. They
defeated the Sandinistas in February elections.
   Lucio Jimenez, leader of the National Workers Front, said
Thursday that his federation plans a walkout of all Sandinista
unions because more than 1,000 government employees were fired,
despite promises nobody would be laid off.
   Jimenez said currency devaluations over the last three months
have cut the purchasing power of the 150,000 government workers by
90 percent, despite pay raises.
   Inflation and low farm production are the two biggest problems
Mrs. Chamorro inherited from the anti-U.S. Sandinistas who governed
Nicaragua for a decade and battled U.S.-backed Contra rebels.
   Mrs. Chamorro has been trying to return Nicaragua to a free
market economy, but strikes and strike threats have undermined her
efforts.
   Her government managed to eliminate government subsidies and
price controls. But this sent prices for staples skyrocketing.

<DATELINE>USHIKU, Japan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Well over 1 million Japanese, perhaps many
more, live with a burden inherited from feudal times that affects
their entire lives. They are called burakumin.
   To the outsider, Japan looks remarkably homogeneous. The
archipelago's 123 million people share language, physical
appearance and customs. Legally, all are equal.
   But for the burakumin, the invisible minority, the homogeneity
of this society is a tantalizing myth.
   They are descended from people who were designated as hereditary
outcasts in the 17th century and were officially liberated by the
Meiji government in 1871, just eight years after Lincoln's
Emancipation Proclamation freed the slaves in the United States.
   More than a century later, most burakumin still live in and take
their name from the ``buraku,'' hamlets or neighborhoods where the
outcasts were settled.
   They still face discrimination in employment, marriage and
virtually all aspects of their treatment by Japanese lucky enough
to be born elsewhere, said Sue Sumii, 88, who has spent 70 years
fighting discrimination against the burakumin.
   A translation of ``The River with No Bridge,'' the first novel
in the author's six-volume series, was issued by Charles E. Tuttle
Co. this spring in Japan, the United States, Britain and Australia.
It was first published in Japanese 31 years ago.
   The book opens in 1908, and Ms. Sumii says the sentiments
revealed in it have hardly changed.
   ``There are about five families living in a buraku at the edge
of this town, and no one lets their kids go play there,'' she said
in an interview.
   ``Those families weren't welcome in the neighborhood
association. People living in the buraku were left out of the
postwar land reform, so many are still tenant farmers. Things
haven't changed much at all.''
   According to government statistics, 1.17 million burakumin live
in 4,603 buraku areas. The Buraku Liberation League, the largest
advocacy group, says there are about 3 million living in 6,000
buraku neighborhoods and many others try to hide their background.
   Ms. Sumii grew up in western Japan, where many buraku live. She
said she learned from childhood friends how it felt to live on the
wrong side of the ``bridgeless'' river dividing burakumin from
other Japanese.
   Her story's hero is a bright 8-year-old named Koji who wonders
why all the people in his village are called ``eta,'' a now-taboo
word that means ``great filth.''
   Koji wonders why the people are poor, although they work hard,
and why other Japanese say they stink.
   ``How did we get to be `eta'?'' he asks. ``We aren't `eta'
because we want to be. We don't even know what it means.''
   Japan's worship of its imperial family is at the root of
discrimination, Ms. Sumii said. Many historians say they don't know
how some people came to be outcasts, but Ms. Sumii believes the
custom originated in the 7th century, when the land came under
imperial control.
   ``When they distributed the land, it went only to `law-abiding
citizens','' she said. ```Bad citizens' were people opposed to the
emperor.''
   In the 17th century, the Tokugawa shogunate divided society into
four castes. At the top were the samurai, or warriors, followed by
farmers, artisans and merchants. Outside the caste system were two
groups: the Eta and the Hinin (non-humans).
   Birth as an ``outcaste'' has traditionally evoked little
sympathy. Buddhists believed it was a sign of retribution for
wrongs committed in a past life, Ms. Sumii said.
   Because they were physically identical to other Japanese, in
many places the burakumin were forced to wear inferior clothes or
shoes.
   They were forced into communities on marginal land, where most
modern buraku still live. Buraku areas often were left blank on old
maps.
   Burakumin were relegated to jobs linked with death, such as
butchering, leather tanning, shoemaking, gravedigging and
cremation. Those activities were considered impure by Buddhism,
which condemns the killing of any creature, and by Japan's
indigenous Shinto religion, which shuns contact with the dead.
   When the Meiji government ``liberated'' the burakumin in 1871,
it also began a system of family registers that include background
and birthplaces.
   Family registers can be used to identify people from the buraku,
and private companies have been found to use illegally published
lists of buraku communities to discriminate in hiring.
   Families often hire detectives to investigate the family
backgrounds of marriage prospects. Discovery that a person is from
a buraku can lead to a broken engagement or divorce.
   ``Even today, the situation has not basically changed,''
Etsuhiro Honbe, a buraku resident, wrote in the Buraku Liberation
News. ``Although there are fewer cases of blatant discrimination,
it has changed into something more cunning, spread like a trap
ready to catch you.''
   In December, a court ordered the brother and sister-in-law of a
man married to a woman from a buraku to pay the woman 7 million yen
(about $47,000) for ``destroying'' the marriage after they
discovered the wife's background.
   Taboos about burakumin are so ingrained that the subject rarely
enters polite conversation. Only in August 1989 did a ose who do not have
a proven track record in the
industry.''

   Flames destroyed the front of the upper story of the Peter A.
Beachy house, which Wright rebuilt in 1906 in this Chicago suburb.
   Firefighters from five villages fought the blaze, reported at

roofing work may have started the fire.
   One firefighter suffered minor burns, McEneany said.

<TEXT>
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein seemed
determined to solve his financial problems and fulfill territorial
ambitions by dethroning the government of neighboring Kuwait.
   The invasion, unprecedented in modern Arab history, reflected
the brutality Saddam has used to crush all opposition at home since
coming to power in 1979.
   The sentence for criticizing Saddam is death, and the president
considered Kuwait's oil overproduction and the subsequent fall in
the price of oil a personal affront to Iraq.
   ``Iraqis will not forget the saying that cutting necks is better
than cutting means of living. Oh God Almighty, be witness that we
have warned them,'' he said last month after prices tumbled below
$14 per barrel.
   He accused Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates of costing Iraq
$14 billion in lost oil revenue by ignoring their quotas assigned
by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
   He also accused Kuwait of stealing $2.4 billion by pumping oil
from a disputed field that straddled their border, and demanded
that Kuwait write off an estimated $15 billion it loaned Iraq
during the Persian Gulf war.
   Saddam was reported to be incensed that Kuwait was demanding
repayment for the wartime loans. Saddam said he fought the war to
protect the Arabs from the fundamentalist revolution fomented by
the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in Persian, mainly Shiite
Moslem Iran.
   Never mind that Iraq started the war in 1980 by invading Iran
after a series of border skirmishes along the Shatt-al-Arab
waterway, Iraq's only outlet to the Gulf.
   Despite claims that the war was an unprecedented victory, the
long conflict stalled Iraq's development, dragging on for eight
years. It has still not formally ended.
   The war bills kept the government from delivering material
benefits promised to the Iraqi people directly after the war. The
1990 budget slashed funds for imports and Iraqis were told to brace
for another year of austerity. Private investment has failed to
take hold.
   Iraq ended the war an estimated $70 billion in debt. Its main
gulf port of Basra is still blocked and its oil infrastructure
damaged. Tens of thousands of Iraqi prisoners of war languish in
Iranian prisons and an estimated 500,000 Iraqis were killed or
wounded.
   Despite its puny size, Kuwait's oil reserves almost match Iraq's
100 billion barrels.
   By controlling Kuwait, Saddam could help solve the financial
hangover from the Persian Gulf war and fulfill Iraq's longstanding
wish for more gulf coastline.
   Iraq's 100,000 troops massed at the border in the past few weeks
were believed part of a pressure campaign to make Kuwait capitulate
to Iraq's demands.
   But Kuwait's pledge two weeks ago to obey new OPEC quotas and
Saddam's promise to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak that he would
not invade lulled the Arab world into the sense the crisis was over.
   Homage to the cause of Arab unity has been paramount in Middle
East politics since postwar independence from colonial powers.
   Although a civil war in Yemen in the 1960s brought Egyptian and
Saudi Arabian intervention on opposing sides, no Arab state has
ever directly deposed the government of a fellow Arab League member.
   Despite Iraqi claims that it is helping internal opposition
liberate Kuwait, it has long coveted the tiny emirate.
   The Iraqi government refused to recognize its independence in
1961 and threatened to attack then, but backed down when Britain
landed troops in Kuwait.
   The invasion shook Kuwait's neighbors along the Gulf. It proved
the decade-old Gulf Cooperation Council that groups Saudi Arabia,
Bahrain, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Oman and Kuwait was
toothless. The GCC did not issue a statement, much less implement
its mutual defense treaty.
   While Iraq was unlikely to invade Saudi Arabia, it could use the
precedent of Kuwait to browbeat its neighbors on local policy
issues. Bombing an oil field would be a sufficient reminder of what
happened to Kuwait when it balked at Iraqi demands.
   Also in a region entirely ruled by absolute monarchs, the fall
of one makes the rest feel extremely vulnerable.
   In a series of bellicose statements in recent months, Saddam has
sought to focus domestic attention outside Iraq.
   In March he threatened to burn half of Israel with Iraq's
chemical weapons _ banned under international law _ if Iraq was
attacked. It was a popular stance among Arabs frustrated with the
lack of progress toward peace and a Palestinian nation in the
Arab-Israeli conflict.
   Then Britain arrested several people on charges they were
smuggling nuclear triggers into Baghdad. Weeks later, police in
Europe impounded what they said was parts to a supergun capable of
firing chemical or nuclear shells into Israel.
   Saddam cried foul, claiming the West was trying to wreck the
scientific progress of the Arabs.
   Saddam has sought to inherit the mantle of the late Egyptian
President Gamal Abdel Nassar as the leader of the Arab world.
   His relentless personality cult has dubbed him ``The Knight of
the Arabs.'' For Kuwait on Thursday, he was a dark knight.
   Asked the reason for the invasion, Kuwait's ambassador to
Washington Sheik Saud Nasir Al-Sabah said at a news conference:
``Ambition. Hegemony. Control of the whole area. There is not any
reason for it.''

   It was billed as a march for freedom by
dozens of computer wizards, but perhaps all they were saying was
give PCs a chance.
   The demonstrators, led by one of America's renowned computer
programmers, marched through Cambridge on Thursday to protest
restrictive use of copyright and patent laws to protect computer
programs or software.
   ``I'm not an activist. I'm not one of those people,'' said Nick
Papadakis, who helps manage the computer science laboratory at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ``I'm by trade a programmer,
and that's why I'm here.''
   About 200 people marched from the MIT campus to the headquarters
of Lotus Development Corp., carrying signs bearing such slogans as
``Innovation Not Litigation.''
   The demonstrators were led by Richard Stallman, a preeminent
programmer who was awarded a $240,000 ``genius'' grant from the
MacArthur Foundation last month.
   Stallman heads a group called the League for Programming
Freedom, whose mission is to limit the use of copyright and patent
laws on software to specific programs.
   The protesters chose Lotus as their target because the company
recently won a federal lawsuit to protect the copyright on its
popular 1-2-3 spreadsheet program.
   Lotus argued that competitors were trying to copy the program's
``look and feel'' _ the actual keyboard commands and images used in
the program. Lotus said if these elements were not protected,
inventive people might be discouraged from developing new software
for fear that someone else might steal the idea.
   A federal judge in Boston sided with Lotus' arguments.
   The protesters claimed Thursday that these laws aren't a form of
protection, but restriction. They said lawsuits such as those
brought by Lotus threaten the careers of computer programmers as
well as the future of America's computer industry.
   ``If the auto industry worked the same way, Henry Ford would
have been suing everyone who made a car with four wheels,'' said
Kevin McBride, a programmer who came down from New Hampshire to
join the demonstrators.
   Many of the protesters voiced similar complaints: copyright
lawsuits such as those brought by Lotus stifle innovation and force
other companies to create entirely new systems that must be learned
from scratch.
   ``If this country wants a computer-literate work force, we have
to make computers easy to use,'' said Stan Kugell, president of
Fairfield Computer Corp., a software firm in Newton. ``New ideas
are built on top of old ideas.''
   Tom Lemberg, general counsel for Lotus, suggested the protesters
should also picket stores that sell books and records since they,
like software, represent the expression of an idea.
   ``The underlying question is why do we have copyrights,''
Lemberg said. ``We have copyrights to protect creators, to provide
incentives to innovate.''
   But Stallman insisted the real goal of Lotus is to create
``captive customers.''
   Stallman said his group still hopes a court will limit the
extent of copyright laws, but he said the main purpose of the
demonstration was to heighten public awareness and ultimately draw
attention from Congress.
   ``This makes me think about the Minutemen,'' Stallman said.
``Let this be the shot heard 'round the world.''

   Posters of him mark the entrance to every
Iraqi village. Radio and television broadcasts call him
``Father-Leader.'' Even children's nursery rhymes sing his praises.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein is the center of a powerful
personality cult that hails him as a stern father, an Arab leader,
a warrior. The last of those was in the forefront Thursday with
Saddam's rapid invasion of Iraq's small Persian Gulf neighbor,
Kuwait.
   The effective ruler of Iraq since 1968, Saddam established a
ruthless dictatorship. His rule has brought the longest period of
stability to Iraq, a coup-plagued country created after World War I
with a diverse population of Shiite and Sunni Moslems, Christians
and Kurds.
   Saddam sees his carefully cultivated image as crucial to Iraqi
unity. In a 1983 interview with Kuwaiti journalists _ at a low
point in Iraq's bloody eight-year war with Iran _ he said he ``must
be a symbol of all Iraqis.''
   Iraqi poems incessantly praise Saddam. Pictures of a smiling
Saddam are on posters everywhere, and photos of him adorn the front
page of every newspaper. Radio and television broadcasts call him
``Father-Leader'' or ``Knight of the Arab Nation.''
   An Iraqi-government advertisement in The New York Times compared
Saddam to Hammurabi, the great king of Babylon on the Euphrates
River who first codified laws nearly 4,000 years ago.
   The personality cult is backed up by a pervasive apparatus of
oppression that included four police forces, four intelligence
services and _ according to human rights organizations _ the use of
torture, summary execution and imprisonment without legal process.
   With frequent purges, Saddam took firm control of the army one
former ruler had called ``a factory of coups.'' It became a capital
offense for an officer to be involved in any political activity
other than functions of the ruling Baath Party.
   After Saddam came to power as strongman behind Gen. Ahmed Hasan
al-Bakr in 1968, about 50 high military and civilian officials were
executed.
   In 1982, amid widespread disappointment as Iran drove the Iraqis
out of captured Iranian territory, there were two attempts to
assassinate Saddam. Another purge followed.
   After the Iran-Iraq war, Saddam brutally subdued rebellious
Kurdish guerrillas. Using chemical weapons against some Kurdish
settlements, he created a depopulated strip along the borders with
Turkey and Iran that cut Kurdish fighters off from outside supplies.
   Intelligence reports indicate he has spent billions of dollars _
some estimates say $50 billion _ on arms, chemical weaponry and
testing of sophisticated artillery capable of lobbing
nuclear-tipped artillery shells at enemies hundreds of miles away.
   Saddam and most of his ruling entourage are Sunni Moslems,
several from his hometown of Tikrit. He uses carrot-and-stick
tactics to control the Shiite Moslems, who form the majority of
Iraq's 17 million population. The Iranians are overwhelmingly
Shiite.
   He spent lavish amounts of money to restore Shiite shrines at
Najaf and Karbala. But when an Iranian-backed Shiite organization,
Dawa, or The Call, was formed to disrupt his rule, he responded
harshly. In 1984 an estimated 600 members of Dawa were executed.
   In May 1983, he arrested 90 members of the prominent Shiite
family, al-Hakim, because one of them was making anti-Iraqi
broadcasts from Iran. When the broadcasts continued, he executed
six members of the family in front of the others.
   The war with Iraq, which Iraq started in 1980, became part of
Saddam's personality cult though it gained no territory or other
advantage for Iraq and stalled vigorous, oil-fueled economic
development for eight years.
   In the war's last battles, Iraqi forces drove Iranians out of
captured Iraqi territory leading to the 1988 cease-fire. The media
refers to the struggle as ``Saddam's Qadissiya,'' a reference to a
7th-century victory of Arabs over Persians.
   Saddam was born April 28, 1937, in Tikrit, 75 miles north of
Baghdad on the Tigris River, the son of a poor peasant. At 20 he
joined the then-underground Baath Party.
   His tough ambition, and leadership qualities won him appointment
to a Baath team assigned to assassinate Iraq's then-ruler,
Abdulkarim Qassem. In 1959 the squad sprayed Qassem's car with
machine gun fire but he escaped. Saddam, wounded in the leg, also
escaped.
   His fearlessness _ having his wound operated on in a Baghdad
hideout, his flight across desert to Syria and then Egypt _ are
glorified in Iraqi books and films.
   He worked underground until the Baath's seizure of power in
1968. In 1979 he took full control from al-Bakr.
   From that year Saddam has been president, chairman of the
council of ministers, commander-in-chief, chairman of the
revolutionary command council, and leader of the Iraqi wing of the
Baath Party.
   Even before the Kuwait invasion, he flexed his muscles.
   Earlier this year, Saddam threatened to destroy half of Israel
with internationally outlawed chemical weapons if Israel tried to
attack any Iraqi military facilities.
   Obsessed about security, he ordered the March 15 execution of
Iranian-born, London-based journalist Farzad Bazoft, who had tried
to gather information about a massive explosion at a
military-industrial complex outside Baghdad.

   Here is a brief look at the history of Iraq and Kuwait:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>IRAQ</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Iraq, part of the Ottoman Empire from the 16th century, was
captured by British forces in 1916. In 1921 it became a kingdom
under a League of Nations mandate, administered by Britain. Iraq
became independent on July 14, 1958, in a coup that established a
military-led Council of Sovereignty headed by Gen. Qassim.
   Qassim was overthrown in 1963 and Gen. Abdul Salam Aref became
president, succeeded by his brother, Abdul Rahman Aref, in 1966.
   In 1968, a successful coup brought by the Baath Party placed
Gen. Ahmed Al Bakr in power. Saddam Hussein, Bakr's vice president
since 1969, became president in 1979 in a peaceful transfer of
power.
   In 1980, Iraq invaded Iran in a territorial dispute over the
Shatt-al-Arab waterway that evolved into a nearly eight-year war. A
U.N. cease-fire halted the fighting on Aug. 20, 1988.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>KUWAIT</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Kuwait became part of the Ottoman Empire in the 16th century.
During the later years of Ottoman rule, Kuwait became a
semi-autonomous Arab monarchy, with local administration controlled
by a Sheikh of the Sabah family, which continues to be the ruling
dynasty.
   In 1899, fearing an extension of Turkish control, the ruler of
Kuwait made a treaty with the United Kingdom accepting British
protection while surrendering control over external relations. The
sheikhdom remained a self-governing British protectorate until it
gained independence in 1961.
   Of all the Gulf states, Kuwait has been most vullnerable to
regional disruption. Immediately after independence, British troops
were called on to support the country against territorial claims by
Iraq. The force remained until 1963, and relations between the
countries were stable until 1973 when Iraq occupied a Kuwaiti
outpost on their common border. Substantial donations to Iraq
subsequently ensured Kuwait's territorial security.
   Continued financial aid to Iraq during its war with Iran, and
the protection of the United States for its oil tankers in the
Persian Gulf, kept Kuwait relatively safe during the gulf war.

   July 17 _ Iraqi President Saddam Hussein accuses Kuwait and the

down, and that the move cost Iraq $14 billion in lost oil revenue.
He further charges that Arab states in the Persian Gulf are
conspiring with the United States and Israel to weaken Iraq's
economy and undermine its military buildup.
   July 18 _ Iraq accuses Kuwait of stealing $2.4 billion worth of
oil from wells along the disputed border with Iraq and of seeking
to wreck Iraq's economy by overproducing oil and thus pushing down
prices.
   July 20 _ Kuwaiti officials suggest Iraq's sudden outburst of
belligerence is aimed at getting its creditors _ including Kuwait _
to write off billions of dollars in debts from the 1980-88
Iran-Iraq war.
   July 24 _ The U.S. Defense Department announces that U.S. Navy
warships and aircraft are holding a ``short-notice exercise'' in
the Persian Gulf with the United Arab Emirates, about 600 miles
southeast of the Kuwait-Iraqi border. Kuwait reinstates a state of
alert it declared July 16 and canceled after three days of tension
between the two oil-producing countries.
   July 25 _ The Iraqi government in Baghdad says that it will not
be intimidated by U.S. pressure in its oil dispute with neighboring
Kuwait, and Saddams summons the U.S. ambassador for talks.
President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt says Iraq and Kuwait plan to meet
in Saudi Arabia in an effort to resolve their dispute.
   July 26 _ OPEC ministers in Geneva agree to halt overproduction
in hopes of pushing up the price of crude oil. Kuwait and the
United Arab Emirates pledge to abide by the agreement. Analysts say
Saddam clearly influenced the outcome of the meetings.
   July 31 _ Kuwaiti and Iraqi delegations meet in Jiddah, Saudi
Arabia, to negotiate the oil and border dispute. Diplomats say Iraq
has massed 100,000 troops on Kuwait's border, more than triple the
number originally estimated. That number dwarfs the Kuwaiti army,
which has a total of about 20,000 troops.
   Aug. 1 _ Iraq pulls out of talks on the 2-week-old border, oil
and money dispute with Kuwait shortly before it sends its forces to
invade the oil-rich sheikdom.
   Aug. 2 _ Iraq's powerful army overruns Kuwait before dawn with
tank-led troops quickly seized the ruler's palace and other
government buildings.

   Thousands _ maybe hundreds of thousands _
of motorcyclists are converging on this small, unassuming town from
all points of the compass. And they're finding the welcome mat out.
   Every year since 1940, the town of 7,000 on the edge of western
South Dakota's Black Hills has played host to motorcyclists out to
enjoy races, tours and general communal good times.
   The weeklong 50th Black Hills Motor Classic starting Monday is
expected to draw anywhere from 140,000 to 400,000 to a town that,
on a normal day, you can drive through in less than five minutes.
Most of the visitors own Harley-Davidsons.
   ``It's an extremely small-town-type atmosphere when the rally's
not here,'' said Marcy Myhre, executive director of the Black Hills
Motor Classic Board and nine-year Sturgis resident.
   ``This year it's going to be exceptionally big,'' said Randy
Billings of Phoenix, who is here with his wife, Karen. ``Every
Harley rider I know says he's coming up.''
   Last year's rally attracted only an estimated 60,000 people, at
least partly because of this year's anniversary, said Ron Paull of
Spokane, Wash. He and his wife, Jean, are running a T-shirt stand
for Spokane's Latus Motors Harley-Davidson for the fourth year.
   ``Everyone we talked to said, `Oh, my buddy didn't show up
because he's waiting for next year,''' Paull said.
   During the rally, Main Street and two other thoroughfares are
taken over by vendors like the Paulls selling every kind of biker
paraphernalia imaginable, from T-shirts to knife cases.
   By Wednesday, Main Street was a study in blue jeans, black
T-shirts and leather.
   While Hell's Angels from Ohio roared down Main Street, the
Paulls talked about how they first came to the rally as part of a
Christian bike group. They said that in the five years they've
attended, they've met people from France, Austria, Australia, South
Africa and West Germany, ``lots of West Germans.''
   The rally's reputation has hit the mainstream public
consciousness only recently.
   It was mentioned in an episode of the ABC series ``Roseanne''
last season. Roseanne Barr and her TV husband were visited by biker
friends, and one was asked if he would go to this year's rally.
   The response: ``Everybody and their dog are going to be there.''
   In 1986, a crew from the British Broadcasting Corp. filmed a
documentary on the rally. In 1988, actor Mickey Rourke rode his
Harley in from California.
   Last year, millionaire Harley lover Malcolm Forbes showed up
with his green and gold motorcycle, saying Sturgis is a ``mecca for
anyone who loves Harleys.'' Forbes died Feb. 25.
   Some rally-goers belong to established groups, such as Hell's
Angels, Banditos and Sons of Silence.
   A man was shot during one rally, but that's beyond the norm,
said Police Chief Jim Bush.
   ``It goes pretty well usually,'' said Bush, a 12-year veteran of
the 10-member force who's in his first year as chief. ``We've never
had a whole lot of great big problems.''
   However, with the predictions of huge crowds, a state task force
has been working with local officials since October to make sure
there's enough support for law enforcement, traffic control,
sanitation and firefighting.
   A few businesses have complained that not enough is done to
protect them during rally time.
   Despite that, ``I think overall, businesses feel good about the
rally,'' Myhre said.
   ``Most people, I think, accept it,'' Bush said. ``There's money
to be made, and they like the idea of the community being known
throughout the world.''

   Federal agents in night-vision
goggles prowled feathery marijuana patches in a federal invasion
that has brought a Panama-trained Army unit _ and claims of civil
rights violations _ to the mountains of northern California.
   The National Guard and Bureau of Land Management took reporters
on a helicopter tour Thursday of the region 180 miles northeast of
San Francisco where government is conducting its largest drug raid
ever on public lands.
   It is also the first time the Army has been used for a marijuana
raid in the continental United States.
   The Army contingent includes seven helicopters and 58 aviators
and maintenance personnel from the 7th Infantry Division, the Fort
Ord-based unit that saw action in the Panama invasion last December.
   Officials wouldn't say if the pilots were the same who flew
missions against deposed Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega, who
surrendered to U.S. troops in January and is on trial for drug
charges in Miami.
   ``Operation Green Sweep'' began Sunday and will continue through
next week in the King Mountain Range, at the edge of the ``Emerald
Triangle,'' so dubbed because much emerald-colored marijuana is
grown in the region.
   ``The King Range is basically one big garden,'' said Craig
MacGill, a BLM agent in charge of ground operations. Officials
offered no estimate at the value of the marijuana grown here, but
say it may be in the billions.
   More than 200 troops and agents swept in by ground and air at
the start of the surprise operation. They sealed off a 640-acre
area near the city of Garberville, and civilian air traffic below
5,000 feet was barred in a surrounding 1,200-square-mile area.
   MacGill said 16 raids have turned up 14 gardens containing 682
plants worth more than $2 million. No growers have been arrested.
   About 200 protesters blocked the gate to the operation's base
camp Thursday and one of the protesters was arrested.
   Local law enforcement officials privately have said the
involvement of the military was unnecessary. Humboldt Sheriff Dave
Renner has disassociated himself from the operation, calling it
ill-advised and counterproductive.
   BLM Director Delos Jamison, the senior official present, said
the raid sends a message to marijuana growers and international
allies in the drug war that the United States is serious.
   Some reports have said the Bush administration, which is
pressuring Bolivia, Peru and Colombia to halt cultivation of coca
plants in the Andes, is embarassed by the lush marijuana growth on
its own public lands.
   On Thursday, visitors were shown a plot containing about 20
plants in a steep ravine, where BLM agents in full battle dress and
camouflage paint stood guard with loaded assault weapons. Each of
the plants had a street value of up to $3,000, officials said.
   Maj. Gen. Robert Thrasher, the state National Guard commander,
said federal agents and guard troops began hiding overnight
Wednesday around undisturbed gardens and used night-vision goggles
in hopes of spotting the growers.
   Jamison discounted residents' claims of being held at gunpoint
by soldiers bearing M-16 assault rifles and being buzzed at low
altitudes by helicopters.
   He questioned whether some of the protesters were actually pot
growers.
   ``I think the locals here that are really protesting, maybe
we're pulling up some of their plants, I don't know,'' Jamison said.
   As part of the operation, officials have removed trip wires
intended as booby-traps to protect illegal gardens.
   Authorities said they plan to restore the forest to its pristine
state, removing the sophisticated drip- and gravity-flow irrigation
systems _ some of them on battery-operated timers _ set up by pot
growers.

<HEAD>Former Civic Leader Sentenced for Role in Drug Smuggling Ring</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal judge sentenced a former president
of the Indianapolis League of Women Voters to nine years in prison
Thursday for her role in a drug-smuggling ring allegedly operated
by her sons.
   Linda L. Leary, 59, pleaded guilty in February to helping her
sons operate a $50 million marijuana smuggling ring in the late
1970s and early 1980s.
   U.S. District Judge Larry J. McKinney sentenced Leary to nine
years for conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute
marijuana. He sentenced her to a concurrent five-year term for
racketeering.
   The racketeering charge stemmed from Leary's control of a trust
account in the Cayman Islands used to launder marijuana profits.
   McKinney gave Leary credit for more than a year of prison time
already served, and ordered her to forfeit about $200,000 in assets
obtained through drug money.
   The judge said he would recommend to the federal Bureau of
Prisons that Leary serve the remainder of her sentence at the
Federal Correctional Institute in Lexington, Ky., where she has
been since February.
   McKinney told Leary he had received several letters from people
who depicted her as a caring woman who'd been involved in
child-care centers, inner-city school immunization programs and
similar projects in poverty-stricken areas.
   He said it was ``incredibly ironic'' that she simultaneously was
part of a conspiracy that brought marijuana into those
neighborhoods.
   ``It's hard for me to look at this record and make some
conclusion as to what in the world is going on in your mind,'' the
judge said.
   Defense Attorney Bernard L. Pylitt had argued for leniency,
saying Leary was a devoted mother and grandmother ``who closed her
eyes to right and wrong'' because she loved her sons.
   ``I'm here to consider more than just one mother,'' McKinney
said later. ``I'm here to represent a lot of mothers, and fathers,
and kids.''
   A tearful Leary asked the judge to provide her with a chance to
``try to build a life with value.''
   Under the plea agreement, Leary could be required to testify
against her sons Paul B. Heilbrunn, 35, and Richard S. Heilbrunn,
38. The Heilbrunns are scheduled to go on trial Feb. 13.
   Leary is a former president of the League of Women Voters and of
the Indianapolis chapter of the National Council of Jewish Women.
   She and her sons fled to Austria in 1985 after learning a
federal grand jury was looking into allegations the Heilbrunns were
directing a multistate smuggling operation.
   In 1987, the grand jury returned indictments against Leary, her
sons and more than 30 other people.
   Leary and her sons were arrested in May 1989 in Austria. They
were extradited to the United States last December.

<HEAD>'S Tough to Slink and Slither, Snake Scientists Say</HEAD>

   It's harder work being a snake than scientists
once believed.
   Three University of California, Irvine, scientists studying the
energy cost of locomotion report that it takes as much energy for a
snake to undulate along the ground as does for an animal with legs
to walk.
   This, says Bruce Jayne, a coauthor of a study published today in
Science, is contrary to what scientists have long believed.
   ``Our findings do not support the widely held notion that the
energetic cost of terrestrial locomotion by limbless animals is
less than that of limbed animals,'' he said.
   In plain language, it is as hard to wiggle along as it is to
walk along. Or it takes as much energy to slither as it does to
stroll.
   To find out how hard a snake has to work to get from one place
to another, Jayne and his colleagues got a group of black racer
snakes and figured out a way to put them through an aerobic workout.
   First, the three-foot-long snakes were fitted with little clear
plastic masks. Leading from each mask was a hose that would collect
the exhaled reptilian breath.
   Then the snakes, one by one, were put on a treadmill _ or,
perhaps, it was a slithermill.
   Anyway, once placed on the device a snake crawled like crazy to
keep up with the surface moving under it. As it worked, the snake's
exhaled breath was drawn through the hose and into a machine that
measured the oxygen content.
   How much oxygen was depleted from the breath, said Jayne, was a
measure of the amount of energy the snake needed to slither along.
   The scientists then compared the results with similar studies of
limbed animals, such as lizards, of the same mass, or weight. The
energy used by both the footed and the fanged was about the same,
they discovered.
   Jayne said the study casts doubt on a long-held notion about the
evolution of limbless land animals, such as snakes and some legless
lizards.
   ``One explanation for the evolutionary loss of limbs has been
that it was energetically less expensive,'' he said. Scientists,
said Jayne, have suggested that being legless gave some animals an
advantage because it was thought to require less energy to move
like a snake than to walk on legs.
   Now, he said, that theory no longer seems valid.
   Jayne said the undulating motion of a snake on a flat surface is
only one of several ways the reptile can move.
   Another method is used when a snake crawls through a tunnel
wider than its body, but not wide enough to slither.
   For such a place, snakes use what is called a concertina motion.
   This movement involves bunching up the lower body and then
extending the head forward. Then the upper body is bunched up and
the tail pulled forward.
   To test the energy need for this motion, Jayne and his team
built a tunnel treadmill and the snakes worked out as before with
their exhaled breath measured.
   ``Concertina locomotion is very expensive (in energy use),''
said Jayne. He said it was ``far and away more expensive than
virtually all other kinds of locomotion.''
   Jayne said the black racers used in the experiments lived up to
their names. In a short bursts, he said, the snakes were able to
slither at more than four miles an hour. Typically, though, they
worked at a speed of half a mile an hour, or less. For the
concertina locomotion, the typical speed dropped to less than 200
feet an hour.
   The scientists got their test subjects from an animals supply
house, but black racers are common snakes in the southeastern
United States. They eat small rodents, birds and lizards and
typically keep away from humans. They are not poisonous, but, as
Jayne learned, they can bite.
   ``Sometimes when I would get them out of their cages, they would
nip me,'' he said.
   How do you get a snake to start a treadmill workout?
   ``You could just touch their tail or wave your hand and off
they'd go,'' said the scientist.
   Jayne's coauthors in the study were Albert Bennett and Michael
Walton. Science, which published the study, is the journal of the
American Association for the Advancement of Science.

<HEAD>Texas Family Waits For Word of Oil Worker Father in Kuwait</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-US-Oil Workers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROSEWOOD, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The family of a 56-year-old Texan who was
one of eight oil field workers rounded up by Iraqi soldiers
invading Kuwait waited anxiously Thursday for news of him.
   ``We are holding out for whatever information we can get,''
David Amos, son of Charles Amos, said at his home in rural
northeast Texas.
   State Department officials told members of Charles Amos' family
that he'd been moved by soldiers who invaded Kuwait on Thursday
morning, members of the Gilmer man's family told Tyler television
station KLTV-TV and the Longview News-Journal.
   ``We were set to have a family reunion this weekend, and dad was
going to fly out of Kuwait'' early Thursday morning, said his
daughter, Karen Amos. ``But we got the call from the State
Department about 2 p.m. ...''
   ``We are not sure if it is better that he was taken by the
Iraqis and is away from the fighting, or if it would be better if
he were free in Kuwait,'' David Amos said. ``We are just hoping
beyond hope that he is OK.''
   The whereabouts of the eight were unknown, the State Department
said in a statement.
   Amos is an employee of Santa Fe Drilling Co. in California, the
television station said.
   Larry Neal, a spokesman for U.S. Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said
State Department sources indicated most of the oil field workers
were employed by Santa Fe Drilling.
   State Department officials told the Amos family that the other
oil field workers moved by the Iraqi troops included five
Americans, two Canadians and one Briton, KLTV said.
   Charles Amos has been traveling overseas for more than 20 years,
his son said. Gilmer is a small city in northeast Texas. Rosewood
is about 15 miles west of Gilmer.

<HEAD>Officials Worry Iraq May Aim Next at Saudi Arabia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq has far more troops in and near Kuwait
than are necessary to occupy the country, which has U.S. officials
worried about President Saddam Hussein's intentions toward
neighboring Saudi Arabia.
   ``It's very dangerous for everybody,'' said Rep. Bob Livingston,
R-La., a member of the House Intelligence Committee.
   Members of Congress who attended classified briefings late
Thursday said they believed the United States is seeking not only
to enlist support among allies for a global trade embargo aimed at
Baghdad, but also is asking which allies would be prepared to
commit military force to defend Saudi Arabia should Saddam decide
to invade.
   The 120,000 troops massed along Iraq's southern border for the
invasion of Kuwait could easily be aimed next at Saudi Arabia, and
U.S. intelligence has reported the re-mobilization of Iraqi militia
and security units, said lawmakers who attended the briefings.
   Meanwhile, Congress welcomed Bush's moves Thursday to divorce
the United States economically from Iraq and to freeze assets of
Iraq and Kuwait. The House voted 416-0 to write those sanctions
into law, and the Senate approved 97-0 a resolution praising Bush's
move and calling for a global boycott of Iraqi oil.
   Saudi Arabia is the source of 15 percent of the U.S. oil supply,
making it the largest single overseas supplier. ``I think it would
be a direct threat to the security of this country'' if Saudi
Arabia were invaded, said Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman
David Boren, D-Okla. ``There's great nervousness in the whole
region.''
   But while intelligence reports clearly indicated the possibility
of an invasion, the analysis presented to lawmakers said the
military overkill could be simply an attempt by Saddam to
intimidate Saudi Arabia into adhering to oil-production policies
dictated from Baghdad, and to deter would-be liberators of Kuwait.
   One intelligence source said while U.S. collection of
information through satellites and intercepts was good, there was
little direct ``human intelligence'' of the sort that could shed
light on Saddam's intentions.
   ``He is as inscrutable as the Sphinx, but far more dangerous,''
said Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y. ``We have to prepare for
worst-case eventualities. The use of force should be a last resort,
but it may be a necessary resort.''
   Sen. Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, an Intelligence Committee member
who has met with Saddam, said of the 53-year-old leader: ``There is
no doubt in my mind that he will go for the brass ring.''
   Boren said U.S. intelligence has produced a vivid portrait of
Saddam: an emotional but pragmatic man, deeply nationalistic and
with a powerful drive to be the dominant figure among oil-producing
Arab states. He also had a deep desire to punish Kuwait, which had
provided aid to Iraq during its eight-year war with Iran but had
cut off that aid.
   Without help from outside, Saudi Arabia and its neighbors could
offer little resistance to an advance by Saddam, said Rep. Matthew
McHugh, D-N.Y., a member of the House Intelligence Committee. ``The
forces arrayed against him are not much of a deterrent,'' he said.
   President Bush sent the aircraft carrier Independence steaming
toward the Persian Gulf, but it was several days away. U.S.
military options for any immediate response to a further invasion
were limited. It would be difficult to get ground forces into the
region in large enough numbers to counter the potent Iraqi force,
said Pentagon analysts.
   The United States would be forced to rely more on long-range air
attacks with conventional bombs, said Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga.,
chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee.
   The resolution passed by the Senate expressed support for
multilateral military action if the economic pressure does not
force Iraq out of its neighbor's territory.
   Lawmakers said they believed the American public would support a
total cutoff of U.S. economic ties with Iraq even if it meant a
short-term increase in fuel prices, because of fears that a
ruthless ruler could gain a long-term stranglehold on Persian Gulf
oil supplies.
   ``You're talking about something that could totally unravel the
whole Middle East,'' said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt. ``Talk about
the analogy of the fuse being lit, it's being lit in Kuwait.''
   Some Democrats welcomed Bush's tough embargo but questioned why
he had not acted sooner. They said a policy of ``appeasement'' by
Bush and President Reagan, his predecessor, might have emboldened
Saddam to invade Kuwait.
   ``The administration, finally ... as a result of the invasion,
has a good policy,'' said Rep. Howard Berman, D-Calif.

<TEXT>
   Nearly one in four American infants is born to an
unmarried mother, six times as many as four decades ago, federal
health officials say.
   Among black infants, the rate is more than six in 10, the
national Centers for Disease Control reported Thursday.
   Infant mortality rates are higher among children born to single
mothers, who often provide less financial security than some
married parents, the CDC said.
   Twenty-four percent of U.S. infants were born to unmarried women
in 1987, the latest year for which statistics are available, the
CDC said. In 1950, the figure was 4 percent.
   The percentage of black infants born to unmarried mothers was 62
percent, compared with 17 percent of white infants. Both are up
from 1983, when 59 percent of black births were to single mothers,
compared with 13 percent of white births, the CDC said.
   ``These figures are alarming,'' said Evelyn Lowery, president of
SCLC Women, a branch of the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference. ``The problems are not getting better; they're getting
worse.''
   In its weekly report, the Atlanta-based CDC said single
motherhood is a signal, but not a direct cause, of possible health
problems for the child.
   ``Marital status confers neither risk nor protection to the
infant,'' the CDC said. ``Rather, the principal benefits of
marriage to infant survival are economic and social support.''
   ``Our effort at teen pregnancy education has got to continue,''
said Mrs. Lowery, the wife of SCLC president Joseph Lowery. ``Many
of these young people are from single parent homes.''
   U.S. infant mortality rates are higher for infants born to
unmarried mothers than for children of marriage, for both whites
and blacks, the CDC said, citing new analysis of 1983 statistics.
For whites, the infant mortality rate was 13.1 per 1,000 children
of unmarried mothers, compared to 7.8 for children of married
mothers. For blacks, the non-marriage infant mortality rate was
19.6, compared to 14.6.
   But when talking about children of teen-age mothers, the
``benefits of marriage'' cited by the CDC may not be there.
Mortality rates for infants of married mothers under 18 tend to be
even worse than for unmarried mothers under 18, probably because of
a ``severe lack of economic and social support'' in struggling teen
marriages, the CDC said.
   ``Married teen-agers are ... more likely to establish
independent households, thereby estranging themselves from
financial and child-care support from relatives,'' the agency said.
   In general, unmarried mothers often are poor, and ``adverse
pregnancy outcomes are correlated with poverty conditions,'' the
CDC said.
   The Census Bureau has reported that 36 percent of black families
with a child under 18 are classified as living in poverty, compared
with 12 percent of similar white families.

<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of people marched to
mark the 10th anniversary of a train station bombing that killed 85
people and to demand that the guilty be brought to justice.
   ``Bologna doesn't forget,'' read placards carried Thursday by
the marchers, estimated by the state-run RAI-TV to number more than
30,000. They and the Parliament in Rome observed a minute of
silence.
   The attack Aug. 2, 1980 at the height of the vacation season was
one of the worst acts of European terrorism.
   Speakers at the rally outside the rebuilt station expressed
bitterness over an appeals court verdict two weeks ago throwing out
the convictions of four people sentenced to life in prison for the
bombing.
   The bombing was blamed on right-wing terrorists working in
concert with the secret Propaganda Due (P-2) lodge, a group accused
of seeking to install a right-wing dictatorship.

   Members of the imperial court have buried rice,
salt, linen and silk in a ground-breaking ceremony preparing a site
for Emperor Akihito's coronation next fall.
   Twelve court ritualists dressed in ancient-style court costumes
were accompanied Thursday by palace musicians.
   The ceremony marked the beginning of the construction of
buildings to be used in the ``Daijosai,'' or the Great Rice-Tasting
Festival held soon after Akihito is formally enthroned Nov. 12.
   During Thursday's ceremony, rice, salt, rice wine and pieces of
linen and silk were buried at five locations in a rite aimed at
purifying the land.
   Akihito, 56, became emperor in January 1989 upon the death of
his father, Emperor Hirohito. The coronation was delayed by a
yearlong mourning period.
   The ceremony is opposed by several Christian, Buddhist and
leftist groups, which believe state funding for it is a violation
of the postwar constitution, which separates religion and state.
   The government has earmarked more than $54.4 million for the
coronation.

   The cocaine possession and conspiracy charges are misdemeanors,
each carrying a maximum penalty of one year in jail and a $100,000
fine. The perjury charges are felonies, each carrying a maximum
penalty of three years in prison and a $250,000 fine.

   With the Census Bureau engaged in mop-up
counting operations, a private research firm says the final totals
could be a big boost for states like Florida while hurting New
York, Connecticut and Minnesota.
   While preliminary population estimates had shown Florida gaining
three seats in the House of Representatives, the Sunshine State
could add as many as five seats, the Population Reference Bureau
said Thursday.
   Meanwhile, New York, which had been expected to lose three
seats, could drop four, according to the calculations by population
specialists William P. O'Hare and Carl Haub.
   Connecticut and Minnesota, which had been expected to retain
their current number of seats, could each lose one, they added.
   The official report on how many seats each state gets will be
announced on Dec. 31, when the Census Bureau reports its official
results to President Bush.
   Meanwhile, however, many groups have done preliminary
calculations based on census estimates of the population.
   Haub and O'Hare did that, but they went one step further, adding
in figures for U.S. servicemen and women stationed overseas and
including estimates for potential errors in the census estimates.
   The calculations of service personnel are based on Pentagon
estimates of the number of people from each state overseas.
   To estimate error in the preliminary population estimates,
O'Hare and Haub looked back at the 1980 census and compared the
final totals that year with the preliminary estimates. The
difference is known as the ``error of closure.''
   They calculated that error for each state in 1980, and then
applied the same percentage to the 1990 state population estimates.
   While counting methods and success vary from census to census,
the new totals do provide an estimate of shifts in House seats if
the error is the same this time as a decade ago.
   The distribution of the 435 House seats is the prime
constitutional purpose of the census, a national count taken in
years that end in zero.
   Because the number of seats does not change, when one state
becomes eligible for an added seat, another state has to lose one.
The actual distribution is calculated through a complex formula
known as the Method of Equal Proportions.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Will Soviets and Americans Agree on All But
Cuba?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There is hardly a region in the world that has
not been affected by the ``new thinking'' that Mikhail S. Gorbachev
has brought to Soviet foreign policy. Well, what about Cuba?
   If there's one country that seems frozen in time, it's Cuba.
President Fidel Castro's devotion to socialism continues to be
unswerving. The Soviets continue to assist his government
generously and U.S. hostility toward the island has, if anything,
accelerated.
   While most everybody proclaims an end to the Cold War, Castro
frets about the possibility of an imminent U.S. invasion. The
Soviets continue to carry out large-scale spy operations from Cuba
directed at the United States.
   Soviet military and intelligence personnel on the island still
number in the thousands. The United States, meanwhile, tries to
make life as difficult as possible for Cuba. Castro says President
Bush has a ``sick obsession'' with ending communism on the island.
   Cuba may be the last place on earth the Soviets and Americans
will argue over.
   Some compare Soviet support for Cuba to America's support for
Israel. Cuba is an ideological ally of sorts for the Soviets and is
confronted by a large and implacably hostile enemy force.
   It is, perhaps, no less difficult for the Soviets to turn their
back on Cuba than it is for the United States to abandon Israel, an
ideological ally virtually surrounded by an enemy force no less
hostile than the one Cuba faces to the north.
   If Cuba is a domestic political issue in the United States, it
has the same status in the Soviet Union. One faction in the Soviet
hierarchy sees Cuba as a dead weight, a $5 billion annual drain on
Soviet resources that can no longer be justified while the U.S.S.R.
is undergoing economic decline.
   Another faction argues that the Soviets cannot abandon Cuba at a
time when the island is under U.S. threat. Such a step, it is said,
would be inappropriate in the case of a country that has been
unbending in its support of the Kremlin for decades.
   Thousands of Cuban soldiers have died over the years while
fighting in support of Soviet strategic objectives.
   But now doubts have arisen about the durability of Soviet-Cuban
ties. One source of concern for Cuba is the stated Soviet intention
of carrying out all international transactions in hard currency as
of Jan. 1, 1991.
   Whether an exception will be made for Cuba has not been
disclosed. Castro is taking no chances, warning Cubans to prepare
for the worst. If Soviet oil supplies are ended, virtually all
construction relating to social services will be cut off, as will
production of clothing for adults and most of Havana's bus service.
   With hard currency in extremely short supply, the government is
pushing ahead with ambitious plans to increase its dollar holdings,
particularly in tourism. But it would take years to offset an
abrupt cut in Soviet assistance, and many now wonder how much time
Castro has before his people turn on his system. Many Cubans
contend that food has never been more scarce than it is now.
   If Castro is in political trouble at home, there was little
evidence of it last week when 500,000 Cubans gathered in Havana to
hear Castro speak. There was not a hint of trouble.
   He acknowledged that some deliveries from the Soviet Union have
been slowed but was careful not to blame Gorbachev. Indeed, he has
been generous lately in his comments on Gorbachev, who is perhaps
the only international figure who can boast being friendly with
both Fidel Castro and George Bush.

<HEAD>Agent Orange Compensation Back in Federal Court</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dispute over compensating Vietnam veterans
for a host of cancers and other ailments believed to be linked to
Agent Orange exposure is back in federal court.
   In a lawsuit filed here Thursday, two veterans groups asked that
federal scientists be forced to complete a study on the health
effects of Agent Orange on Vietnam veterans and their children.
   The suit said the Reagan administration ordered the study
canceled in 1987, four years after it began, because of concerns
that civilian claims against government and industry would follow a
decision to compensate veterans.
   The suit was filed in U.S. District Court by the American
Legion, Vietnam Veterans of America, five individual veterans and
four surviving spouses.
   It said that without the study, mandated by Congress in 1979, it
is impossible to persuade the Veterans Affairs Department to award
disability and death payments to thousands of veterans who were
exposed to the dioxin-contaminated defoliant.
   The herbicide, used to destroy ground cover and crops, has been
blamed by veterans groups for 19 cancers and a variety of other
health problems, including birth defects.
   The VA this year decided to award compensation for two rare
cancers: soft-tissue sarcoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
   The soft-tissue sarcoma decision was based on the
recommendations of an advisory panel acting under a court order to
reconsider the scientific evidence. The lymphoma decision was based
on a Centers for Disease Control study of Vietnam veterans that
only indirectly looked at Agent Orange exposure.
   Veterans Secretary Edward J. Derwinski said the lawsuit will set
back his effort to resolve the Agent Orange dispute. He began that
effort shortly after he took office by deciding not to appeal a May
1989 federal court ruling that VA standards on Agent Orange
disability claims were too strict.
   The ruling in San Francisco came as a result of a lawsuit filed
by the Vietnam Veterans of America.
   ``Now, these organizations have acted to return to the courtroom
with litigation aimed at forcing the scientific conclusions they
want,'' Derwinski said. ``Their suit impugns the integrity of
respected scientists at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control whose
work thus far has added much to what we know about the health of
Vietnam veterans.''
   The CDC, in canceling the study, said there was no
scientifically valid way to document who was exposed. The American
Legion and independent scientists say records of troop movements
can be matched with spraying records to find the likely exposed
veterans.

<TEXT>
   Afghan refugees are increasingly
blaming Moslem guerrillas they once hailed as heroes for the
12-year-old civil war that keeps them from going home.
   ``There is no peace because these people are not united,'' said
a refugee named Feramoz, referring to the seven guerrilla groups
that received support from the United States, Saudi Arabia and
other sympathetic Arab states.
   While the superpowers seek a compromise in the Afghan war,
resentment is growing among refugees over the lethal infighting
among the guerrilla groups and the opulent lifestyles of their
leaders in Peshawar, near the Afghan border.
   A two-day summit between U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker
III and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze _ whose
government continues to back Afghan President Najibullah after the
Soviet pullout in February last year _ ended Thursday with little
indication of progress on Afghanistan.
   That lowered expectations of a quick settlement that could allow
the repatriation of an estimated 3.8 million Afghans who live in
dried-mud huts and weather-worn tents in refugee camps across
Pakistan's rugged Northwest Frontier Province.
   ``We're forced to live like this. What can we do?'' asked
Feramoz, who uses only one name.
   Guerrilla leaders are rumored to have made fortunes during the
long war, siphoning off weapons, money and supplies earmarked for
the war effort and using the proceeds to build colonial-style homes
and buy four-wheel- drive vehicles.
   The United Nations last week launched a cash-and-food program
for refugees who agree to return to Afghanistan but few have
accepted.
   Refugees say Islamic clerics have been issuing threats from
mosques and condemning those who return to Afghanistan as infidels.
There have also been reports of guerrilla leaders forcing returning
refugees back to the camps.
   ``Those who wanted to go back are being stopped at the border by
mujahedeen (Islamic holy warriors),'' said Sadar Gul, an Islamic
cleric who preaches in the Nasir Baugh camp dominated by Gulbuddin
Hekmatyar's Hezb-e-Islami, or Party of Islam.
   The mujahedeen leaders, once lionized, are now seen by many as
bickering warlords who have lost the faith of their backers and the
support of most of the refugees.
   ``We have been cheated of our victory,'' said Aga Shah, a young
Afghan who longed for the days when Soviet soldiers were fighting
alongside Kabul's communist-style government _ because the presence
of a foreign force brought unity to the armed opposition.
   ``When the Russians were there we were happy because all Moslems
were united,'' he said. ``Now they are all fighting for power.''
   Moscow withdrew its combat troops in February 1989 after nine
years of direct military involvement.
   ``Now it's just Afghans killing Afghans,'' said Hamed Gailani,
whose father heads a pro-royalist National Islamic Front of
Afghanistan guerrilla group.
   The guerrillas' government-in-exile, once seen as a replacement
to President Najibullah, has tested Washington's patience _ some
say to the breaking point.
   A U.S. Senate intelligence committee has voted to slash $100
million from its military allotment to the guerrilla fighters who
last year reportedly received $300 million.
   Washington has agreed that Najibullah, the Soviet-installed
leader, can remain president providing he cedes power over his
military, secret police and state media.
   Gailani said the only solution to peace is the return of
Afghanistan's former monarch Zahir Shah, who was overthrown by his
cousin Mohammad Daoud in 1973. Zahir Shah has been living in exile
in Rome.
   But Islamic radicals within the rebel leadership condemn the
former king, saying he opened Afghanistan's door to communism and
then remained silent throughout the war.

<HEAD>Foreign Suppliers Rushed Into Iraqi Markets Before U.S. Embargo</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign competitors are moving in quickly to
sell to Iraq grain and other commodities following President Bush's
order banning trade with the oil-rich Middle East country, an
Agriculture Department analyst says.
   John B. Parker of the department's Economic Research Service
said Bush's embargo order Thursday probably was not a complete
surprise to Iraqi traders.
   ``They had already been shifting heavily to competitors (of the
United States) in anticipation of something like this,'' Parker
said in a telephone interview. ``They bought a lot of rice from
Thailand and Vietnam, a lot of wheat from Australia and Canada, and
had started probing Argentina and the European Community.''
   Parker said this shifting of Iraq to other agricultural
suppliers occurred over the last three or four months.
   Iraq, he said, bought about $808 million worth of U.S.
agricultural commodities in 1988, but sales dropped last year to
$749 million. USDA projections showed exports were expected to drop
to around $700 million this year.
   Meanwhile, the department announced late Thursday it has
suspended all programs involving business with Iraq, including
credit arrangements and export subsidy benefits.
   R.E. Anderson Jr., administrator of USDA's Foreign Agricultural
Service, said the suspension of programs used by Iraq will be in
effect ``until further notice.''
   Additionally, he said, the department will not approve
applications and issue credit guarantees for any sale of
agricultural commodities for Iraq that were not exported before
Thursday.
   The Bush trade embargo raised memories among farm groups of the
one imposed by President Carter in 1980 to punish the Soviet Union
for its invasion of Afghanistan.
   But that embargo was directed mostly at sales of agricultural
products to the Soviets. The trade ban imposed by Bush applies
across the board, except for humanitarian aid.
   Paul Drazek of the American Farm Bureau Federation said his
organization ``probably will not oppose'' the Iraqi trade ban since
agriculture was not singled out.

   A bug hunter from the Soviet Union is winding
up a five-week U.S tour in search of insects that destroy ragweed,
the notorious plant that triggers hay fever in millions of people.
   The Agriculture Department says entomologist Oleg Kovalev of the
Zoological Institute of the Soviet Union's Academy of Sciences has
found a few likely candidates to unleash on ragweed back home.
   Kovalev has visited 10 states in his search and will conclude
Aug. 7 at the USDA's main research center in Beltsville, Md.
   The department's Agricultural Research Service said Thursday
that Kovalev's search for anti-ragweed bugs has taken him to
Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Maryland, Missouri,
Nebraska, Pennsylvania and Virginia.
   R. Dean Plowman, head of the research agency, said Kovalev's
tour is part of a reciprocal, cooperative agreement with Moscow.
   ``American and Soviet scientists can now expand joint studies
and explorations of natural pest controls,'' Plowman said. ``This
will give both countries a wider choice of workable alternatives to
chemical controls for plant diseases, weeds and insects.''
   Ragweed entered the Soviet Union in the early part of this
century and gained a larger foothold in World War II when so much
of the land was churned up by battles.
   Kovalev and USDA entomologist Stephen D. Hight collected a
number of insects that attack ragweeds, including a chrysomelid
beetle, a relative of the destructive Colorado potato beetle.
   Further testing will be required to ensure the chrysomelid
doesn't attack crops.

<HEAD>Groups Says AT&amp;T Price Cut Not as Big as Expected</HEAD>

   Consumer and business groups want to know why
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. apparently pocketed as much as
$200 million of a government-ordered $500 million price reduction
last month, but a regulator says the utility acted properly.
   The groups on Thursday petitioned the Federal Communications
Commission to consider rule changes that would require AT&amp;T to
reveal how it figured that, in response to an FCC order, it had to
cut prices only about $300 million rather than about $500 million.
   FCC Chairman Alfred Sikes told a House subcommittee that AT&amp;T
``has fully flowed through its share of access price decreases to
its price caps.''
   He said AT&amp;T had dropped prices so much voluntarily before July
1 that it needed only to reduce prices an additional $300 million.
   An AT&amp;T corporate vice president, Tom Norris, labeled any
allegations of impropriety as ``preposterous'' and said the company
would fight any move to force it to disclose more information about
its rate filings.
   The petition was filed on the same day that Democratic members
of the House telecommunications subcommittee urged the FCC not to
make ``a multibillion-dollar mistake'' by too aggressively
deregulating the long-distance marketplace.
   At the subcommittee hearing, Sikes was asked to defend
commission proposals to loosen further federal oversight of AT&amp;T
and impose a new price-based regulatory system on the interstate
long-distance earnings of the nation's local telephone companies.
   Lawmakers said they feared the FCC had not sufficiently studied
recent changes in the long-distance business and the impact that a
major deregulatory change on AT&amp;T last year has had on the
marketplace.
   Sikes declined to delay action on the proposed regulatory
changes, both of which could happen before 1991, but he said he
would make a report to Congress on the current state of the
marketplace.
   The petition to the FCC dealt with the commission's order that
local phone companies on July 1 of this year reduce by $1.1 billion
the charges they levied on long-distance carriers to connect with
local telephone networks.
   Under the rate-of-return regulation that the FCC abandoned in
1989, AT&amp;T was required to pass on most, if not all, of its share
of these savings to customers. Such actions have been the primary
reason long-distance prices have declined more than 40 percent
since 1984.
   The ``price cap'' regulatory scheme that the FCC adopted in July
1989 restricts AT&amp;T's prices instead of its earnings to give it an
incentive to hold down costs and prices.
   AT&amp;T doesn't necessarily have to pass through all of the
``access charge'' reductions to customers. In fact, AT&amp;T boosted
some small business prices on July 27.
   AT&amp;T's share of the $1.1 billion access charge reduction was
about $520 million, according to the July 30 issue of Business Week
magazine. But the company's July 1 prices cuts were just $300
million.
   The petition by the Consumer Federation of America, the
International Communications Association and the National
Association of State Utility Consumer Advocates asked the FCC to
look into the ``apparent discrepancy of at least $140 million _ and
perhaps as much as $200 million.''
   The groups, noting that the FCC had estimated consumers would
save $900 million over four years under price caps, said AT&amp;T
should be required to file data supporting the rate cuts ``to
ensure that ratepayers are realizing all of the savings the
commission promised.''

<HEAD>Judge: Former Striking Pilots Can Bump Trainees</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Union pilots who struck Eastern Airlines are
entitled to replace trainees hired to help the carrier rebuild, a
federal judge said.
   Thursday's ruling by U.S. District Judge Edward Davis apparently
affects only those who were in training when time the pilots ended
their walkout, said E.J. Breen, spokesman for the Air Line Pilots
Association.
   Still, Breen said, ``It's clearly a major victory.''
   All but 200 of the 3,600 union pilots walked off the job in
sympathy with Machinists who struck the Miami-based airline in
March 1989. Pilots ended their sympathy walkout in November, but
fewer than 50 have been called back to Eastern, pilots association
officials say. The Machinists are still striking.
   At least 404 pilots were in training when the pilots returned to
work, the pilots association says. The airline estimates only 180
jobs are affected by the ruling, Eastern spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak
said. Further hearings likely will be determine the exact number of
affected jobs, Breen said.
   Eastern said in a statement it would appeal the decision. The
airline predicted the ruling wouldn't immediately affect current
employees or operations.
   Many pilots took jobs with other airlines after the strike began
March 4, 1989, but about 1,400 former Eastern pilots may still be
interested in returning, pilots' association spokesman Lou Baldwin
said.
   Davis' ruling stems from the association's challenge of
Eastern's claim that the formerly striking pilots were not needed.
   Davis agreed that the federal Railway Labor Act guarantees
returning strikers job rights ahead of newly hired trainees.
   Davis said Eastern violated the Railway Labor Act by hiring
pilot trainees not already qualified to fly regular flights. The
act was devised to provide ``uninterrupted transportation
service,'' the ruling said.
   Eastern sought bankruptcy protection five days after the strike
began. It presently operates about 800 flights, down from its
pre-strike service of 1,040.
   Ms. Ceremsak said she does not believe Davis' ruling must
receive bankruptcy court approval.
   If the ruling is upheld on appeal, all returning pilots would
need to go through several weeks of recertification training under
the Federal Aviation Administration, Eastern officials said.
   Eastern currently has about 1,900 pilots, including those
trained before the strike was settled, pilots hired from other
airlines and union pilots who later crossed picket lines.
   Baldwin said the Eastern pilots trainees' annual pay is about
$27,000. The average pre-strike pay at Eastern for fully accredited
pilots was about $65,000, he said.

   Shelling was reported at Kuwait's main military
barracks Friday, a day after Iraqi troops overran the oil-rich
Persian Gulf sheikdom and caused a storm of criticism worldwide.
   Iraqi soldiers also were reported surging through the southern
oilfields near the Saudi Arabian border.
   Iraq, which said it set up a provisional Kuwaiti government,
warned foreign governments it would turn the rich sultanate into a
``graveyard'' if they came to Kuwait's aid.
   A U.S. aircraft carrier was steaming toward the gulf to join a
flotilla of other U.S. warships.
   Residents, speaking by telephone on condition of anonymity, said
they heard shelling throughout the night in the northern area of
Shuwaikh where the barracks are located. The report indicated that
resistance was stiffer than the first day of the invasion.
   Residents in the capital woke up to what one described as ``as
very active gunshots and louder explosions than at any time'' since
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein launched the invasion early Thursday.
   Artillery shelling also occurred on the gulf coast, 16 miles
from Shuwaikh, with two military vehicles on fire, the residents
said. It was not immediately clear what was going on in that area.
   There was no word on casualties in the latest fighting.
Diplomats said at least 200 Kuwaitis were killed or wounded the day
before.
   Kuwait's emir, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, fled to
neighboring Saudi Arabia. His government pledged in a radio
broadcast early Friday to win back the country, but with the huge
imbalance of armed forces that seemed impossible. Iraq has 1
million soldiers. Kuwait has 20,300.
   Iraqis occupied all government buildings in Kuwait City and
strengthened their hold on the capital Friday as they moved south
to the oil installations at Mina al-Ahmadi, officials said. Iraqi
soldiers swept through the oilfields early Friday, according to
residents and Lloyds' insurance service in London.
   Saudi Arabia issued a statement through the official Saudi Press
Agency, saying it was following the situation with extreme concern.
   Iraq said its troops entered at the request of revolutionaries
it said had staged a coup. Kuwaiti and other diplomats called the
coup report a charade.
   The move by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein brought worldwide
condemnation and sanctions.
   The Soviet Union, Iraq's biggest arms supplier, said it was
suspending weapons shipments to Iraq. President Bush called the
invasion ``naked aggression.'' He froze control of Iraqi assets in
the United States and blocked most Iraqi imports, including its
most important revenue source _ oil. Fellow Arab states, though,
failed to take action.
   Iraq responded by freezing repayment of Iraqi debts to the
United States, the official Iraqi News Agency reported. The total
size of the debt is unclear. Last year, Washington provided $1
billion in agricultural credits to Iraq.
   Iraqi soldiers rounded up and moved ``a few'' American oil field
workers from their work places near the border of Kuwait and their
whereabouts are unknown, a State Department official said in
Washington. The official, like many other sources, spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   The Pentagon earlier Thursday ordered an aircraft carrier into
the region. Bush said military intervention was not under
discussion, but later noted that if Americans in Kuwait ``are
threatened or harmed ... I have certain responsibilities.''
   About 3,000 Americans are in Kuwait. A White House spokesman
said no reports surfaced of American casualties.
   Kuwait, through its U.S. ambassador, appealed for U.S. military
intervention.
   The Soviet news agency Tass reported out of Kuwait City that ``a
figh near the Soviet Embassy ... was short and fierce. ... A column
of Iraqi tanks surrounded the palace of Crown Prince Prime Minister
Saad al-Abdullah (al-Sabah) and shelled it for about half an hour
from guns and machine guns.
   ``After Iraqis made sure there would be no more retaliatory
firing from the palace, they drew up in a march formation and a
column of tanks moved along the bank toward Salmiya, where several
yacht clubs are situated.''
   Sheik Fahd al-Ahmed al-Sabah, a brother of the emir, was killed
trying to defend the royal palace in Dasman, diplomats in the
Persian Gulf confirmed.
   The emir's radio station called it a ``barbaric invasion.''
   ``Under the leadership of the emir, we shall by God deter the
invaders, purify our beloved country from their treachery and send
them fleeing back,'' Crown Prince Saad said in a later broadcast
from an undisclosed site.
   In other developments:
   _The U.N. Security Council voted 14-0 to condemn the invasion
and demanded immediate withdrawal of Iraqi troops. The vote carries
no enforcement powers.
   _The State Department said Secretary of State James A. Baker III
would fly to Moscow on Friday to issue a rare joint statement about
the crisis with his Soviet counterpart, Eduard A. Shevardnadze.
   _The invasion created turmoil in world financial markets, with
the price of oil, gold and the dollar rising steeply.
   In Baghdad, the Revolutionary Command Council led by Saddam
issued a statement saying Iraq intervened in support of ``The
Provisional Government of Free Kuwait.'' It said the government was
made up of ``revolutionary youths.''
   The provisional government announced through Baghdad's INA that
it was dissolving parliament and would hold ``free and honest
elections'' at a future date.
   Iraq also warned foreign governments against coming to Kuwait's
aid.
   ``Our armed forces will close in an iron rank against those who
try to challenge us and will make Iraq and Kuwait a graveyard for
those who launch any aggression,'' a statement on official Baghdad
radio said.
   Iraq began threatening Kuwait two weeks ago after accusing it of
stealing oil from a border region claimed by both nations. It also
accused Kuwait of depriving it of oil revenues by cheating on OPEC
production quotas, thus driving down oil prices with plentiful
supplies.
   Talks to resolve the dispute broke down Wednesday, and diplomats
said Iraq had moved 100,000-120,000 soldiers to the Kuwait border.
   Early Thursday, about 350 Iraqi tanks wheeled into the capital
after crossing the border 40 miles away, diplomats said. Within two
hours, they had taken the emir's palace. Residents of the area said
about 50 tanks surrounded the palace and the neighboring American
Embassy.
   Persian Gulf-based Western diplomats said the invasion was too
swift to arrange for evacuation of nationals.
   The Iraqi armed forces were led by the elite Republican Guard,
which did the brunt of the fighting in the 1980-88 war with Iran.
   Thousands of residents attempted to flee in their cars. Iraqi
troops set up roadblocks and shot at cars that did not stop.
   Kuwait is a former British protectorate that gained independence
in 1961. Its 1.9 million residents are among the world's wealthiest
because of vast oil reserves. Iraq, with 17 million residents, has
long coveted its territory.
   Kuwait sided with Iraq in the Iraq-Iran war.

<HEAD>President Wants Fewer Troops But More Weaponry</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush envisions needing 500,000 fewer
troops by 1995 in a restructured, fast-response U.S. military, but
he wants to move full speed ahead on major weapons programs,
including the B-2 stealth bomber and Trident submarine.
   Bush, in a major speech on defense policy in Aspen, Colo., on
Thursday, said Iraq's ``brutal aggression'' against Kuwait
demonstrates that ``the world remains a dangerous place.''
   ``Even in a world where democracy and freedom have made great
gains, threats remain,'' Bush told an Aspen Institute symposium.
``Terrorism. Hostage taking. Renegade regimes and unpredictable
rulers ... all require a strong and engaged America.''
   On a trip cut short by the Iraqi invasion, the president
announced his support for a 25 percent reduction in America's 2.1
million active duty military personnel over the next five years.
That would be the lowest level since 1950.
   Bush said the threat of a sudden Soviet invasion of Western
Europe was ``more remote'' than ever in the postwar period, and
``the Cold War is now drawing to a close.''
   ``With the emergence of democracy in Eastern Europe, the Warsaw
Pact has lost its military meaning,'' he said.
   An administration official said 200,000 of the 1 million
civilian jobs in the Defense Department would be cut by the
mid-1990s in addition to the 500,000 uniformed positions.
   The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, also
predicted that military bases at home and overseas ``will be
reduced and restructured dramatically'' as part of the troop
reduction.
   The possibility of a 25 percent military cut has been raised
previously by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Gen. Colin Powell,
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Some members of Congress
favor even deeper retrenchment.
   ``What we need are not merely reductions, but restructuring,''
said Bush, outlining his vision of a military that would continue
strategic modernization. This would include building all 75
radar-evading B-2 bombers and 18 Trident missile submarines in his
defense plan, pressing ahead with the mobile Midgetman missile and
putting the silo-based MX missile on rails.
   Bush said a restructured military must be tailored to respond
rapidly to crises anywhere in the world.
   ``A new emphasis on flexibility and versatility must guide our
efforts,'' he said. ``These threats can, as we've seen just in the
last 24 hours, arise suddenly, unpredictably and from unexpected
quarters.''
   ``The events of the past day underscore also the vital need for
a defense structure which not only preserves our security but
provides the resources for supporting the legitimate self-defense
needs of our friends and allies,'' the president said.
   The House Armed Services Committee voted Tuesday to trim the 2.1
million active duty personnel by 129,500 by the fall of 1991, more
than triple Bush's proposal for a cut of 40,000.
   The committee, proposing to slash Bush's $307 billion military
budget proposal by $24 billion, also recommended ending the B-2
bomber program at the 15 planes already authorized, making deep
cuts in the Star Wars antimissile program and halting plans for the
mobile nuclear missiles.
   Working on its $289 billion version of the 1991 defense bill
Thursday, the Senate rejected a proposal to end the B-2 program at
15 planes but imposed restrictions on it until critical tests on
the plane have been conducted.
   Cheney has said a 25 percent troop reduction could save $8.6
billion over five years as the Pentagon retired six Army divisions,
111 Navy ships and 11 Air Force tactical fighter wings, and removed
442,000 personnel from active duty.
   Cheney may announce new proposed military base closings as early
as next week.
   Before his Aspen speech, Bush conferred with British Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher, also attending the Aspen Institute
symposium. Her defense minister, Tom King, last week announced
plans to reduce the size of the British army by 25 percent over
five to seven years.

   The House Banking Committee wants New York
real estate developer Donald Trump to explain how he persuaded
major banks to loan him $2 billion that he is now struggling to
repay.
   Committee Chairman Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas has twice invited
Trump to an Aug. 9 committee session. So far, Trump hasn't replied.
   At a time when soured real estate loans are cutting into many

banks' handling of the Trump organization loans,'' Gonzalez said in
a letter to Trump.
   Gonzalez, in a notice to committee members Thursday, said the

<HEAD>Peace Corps Will Return to Philippines When Safety Is Assured</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Peace Corps volunteers will return to the
Philippines when their safety can be assured, the corps director
said after the release of a worker detained for 50 days by Filipino
communist guerrillas.
   Timothy Swanson, a 26-year-old volunteer from Cheyenne, Wyo.,
was released Thursday by New People's Army insurgents and he
appeared to be physically unharmed, corps director Paul Coverdell
said.
   The program's suspension June 27 was not intended to be
permanent, and ``I think there are valid reasons for us to begin
discussions to find a way volunteers can return to that country in
safety,'' Coverdell said.
   However, he said, ``Until we can verify that safety, they cannot
return.'' He did not list specific conditions.
   U.S. officials suspended the Philippines program after learning
that the New People's Army had targeted volunteers for attack.
Manila headquarters did not learn Swanson had been abducted from
his home in Negros province on June 13 until it summoned
participants to return to America two weeks later.
   The reason for the kidnapping remains unknown, Coverdell said.
   The Peace Corps began Philippine operations 30 years ago. Until
it abducted Swanson, the New People's Army left all foreign
volunteers alone, Coverdell said.
   Their release of Swanson and of Fumio Mizuno, a detained member
of a Japanese service organization, may suggest that they have
reverted to the earlier hands-off policy, he said, but ``it is too
early to know as yet.''

<HEAD>House Approves Airport User Fees for Passengers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House approved passenger user fees at
airports as a way of financing new gates, runways and other
construction designed to cut increasing congestion and delays.
   Fees would be limited to $3 per passenger at each airport, with
a ceiling of $12 per passenger for one round-trip.
   ``This bill will bring our air transport system into the 21st
century,'' said Rep. Lawrence Coughlin, R-Pa., as the House voted
252-171 Thursday to defeat an effort to drop the user fees from the
legislation.
   The House then approved the bill 405-15.
   The measure would authorize $17 billion over two years for
airport operations and development. It calls for spending more than
$6 billion in the Aviation Trust Fund over the next five years to
upgrade airports.
   The Senate has taken no action on the plan.
   House members clashed over the provision authorizing local
airports to impose fees on passengers. Whether to impose such fees
would be a decision made by local officials, subject to regulation
by the federal Department of Transportation.
   Improvements are needed to ease crowding and delays caused by an
increase in airline passengers from 266 million in 1978 to 480
million last year. Authorities are forecasting an increase to 750
million within 10 years.
   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., and other Chicagoans said that a
third major airport to service the city could not be built without
the passenger charge. The new airport is estimated to cost $4.9
billion.
   But critics said the fees would benefit only a few cities with
major construction projects on the drawing board _ especially
Chicago _ and that most travelers would reap no benefits from the
airport improvements.
   ``Aviation passengers are being taken for a ride by the White
House and Congress,'' said Rep. Norman Mineta, D-Calif.
   A study by airport associations has suggested that $10 billion a
year would be needed for the next five years to overcome congestion
at many of the nation's major airports. The Transportation
Department has generally accepted the estimate.
   Rep. William F. Clinger Jr., R-Pa., said the critics had
provided no alternative way to meet the costs.
   ``They can hope the tooth fairy will, under cover of night,
extend the runway or build the new terminal,'' Clinger said.

   Two quirky series with cult
followings were among television series showered with Emmy award
nominations.
   But once again, heavyweight housewife Roseanne Barr failed to
impress the Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences.
   ABC's offbeat ``Twin Peaks,'' the critically acclaimed but
poorly rated saga of sex, murder and cherry pie in a fictional
Pacific Northwest logging town, snared an industry-leading 14 Emmy
nominations Thursday.
   ``The Simpsons,'' Fox Broadcasting Co.'s cartoon chronicle of a
grumbling American family, collected five nominations _ three for
primetime series and two for a Christmas special.
   ``Twin Peaks'' was nominated as outstanding drama series. The
show's executive producers, David Lynch and Mark Frost, shared a
nomination for best writing. Lynch, the auteur filmmaker, also was
nominated for best drama directing.
   ``We're just delighted to be in the position we have suddenly
found ourselves in,'' said Frost. ``Frankly, the whole thing has
sort of been out of left field and this is the icing on the cake.''
   The Emmy nominations also could bring added respectability to
``The Simpsons,'' featuring wisecracking 10-year-old Bart Simpson,
who vaulted to national prominence with a rebellious attitude and
resurrected American slang phrases like ``Don't have a cow, man.''
The show has been criticized for its often cynical portrayal of the
American family.
   ``Simpsons'' executive producer James L. Brooks said he was ``in
a sleepy, sweaty puddle'' when awakened with news of the Academy of
Television Arts &amp; Sciences nominations announced during a pre-dawn
ceremony by actor Louis Gosset Jr. and ``China Beach'' star Dana
Delany.
   ABC's top-rated ``Roseanne'' received two selections, one for
co-star John Goodman as best supporting actor. But Barr was snubbed
by academy voters, who also ignored the controversial comic in last
year's nominations.
   ``It always takes the industry a few years to catch up with
anything ground-breaking,'' said Barr's husband, Tom Arnold.
   Barr wouldn't comment. Earlier this week she told talk show host
Sally Jessy Raphael that last year's snub ``really my hurt
feelings,'' but she expected the same this year.
   ABC's highly rated ``America's Funniest Home Videos'' also was
ignored by the academy, proving that top Nielsen figures don't
automatically translate into Emmy nominations.
   NBC's legal eagles on ``L.A. Law'' received 13 nominations. The
network's long-running comedy ``Cheers'' and CBS's hit ``Murphy
Brown'' both amassed 12 nominations each.
   ``The Simpsons'' was nominated in the category of ``outstanding
animated program for programming one hour or less,'' where
competition included Garfield and Charlie Brown specials.
   ABC won 95 nominations overall, tying it for first with NBC. ABC
finished last in the 1989 nominations, a position held this year by
CBS, with 73 selections.
   Upstart Fox earned 26, more than double its 12 nominations last
year. Another notable Fox nominee was ``In Living Color'' _ a
highly praised sketch comedy show featuring mostly black performers.
   Kyle MacLachlan, the cherry pie-loving FBI agent on ``Twin
Peaks,'' was nominated for best actor in a drama series. Piper
Laurie earned a lead drama actress nomination.
   Other nominees for best drama series were ABC's ``China Beach''
and ``thirtysomething,'' and NBC's ``L.A. Law'' and ``Quantum
Leap.''
   Six programs honored Thursday won't be on television next
season: Fox's ``The Tracey Ullman Show,'' which earned 13
nominations, CBS' ``Newhart,'' ``Beauty and the Beast,'' ``The
Famous Teddy Z,'' ``The Equalizer'' and ``Mancuso FBI.''
   One nomination went to the late Muppets creator Jim Henson, who
was named for directing a variety or music program.
   Other nominees for best dramatic actor were Peter Falk of ABC's
``Columbo,'' Edward Woodward from CBS' ``The Equalizer,'' Robert
Loggia in NBC's ``Mancuso FBI,'' and Scott Bakula of ``Quantum
Leap.''
   Dramatic actress choices included last year's winner, Dana
Delany, of ``China Beach,'' Jill Eikenberry from ``L.A. Law,''
Angela Lansbury for CBS' ``Murder, She Wrote'' and Patricia Wettig
in ``thirtysomething.''
   Winners will be announced Sept. 16 at a ceremony in Pasadena
scheduled for broadcast on Fox.

<HEAD>Eight Killed in Car Bomb in Southern Lebanon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TYRE, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A car bomb has exploded near an office of
the Syrian-backed Amal militia in this southern port city, killing
eight people and wounding 75 others, police said today.
   They said the car, rigged with 43 pounds of explosives,
detonated in the city's Hay al-Raml district at 11 p.m. Thursday.
   A police spokesman in Tyre, 80 miles south of Beirut, said the
casualties occurred when people rushed to check damage caused by a
small bomb that blew up minutes before the car bomb exploded.
   The spokesman, who cannot be named in line with regulations,
said one Amal militiaman was among the dead and 10 others among the
wounded.
   The car bomb, the sixth in Lebanon this year, came a few hours
after a booby-trapped car exploded in Nabatiyeh, killing one person
and wounding four others.
   No one claimed responsibility for either attack.
   Reporters based in Tyre said Amal militiamen toured the city in
cars today, urging the population through loudspeakers to observe a
general strike today to protest what they called an ``Iranian
massacre.''
   The daylong strike was called for in Amal-controlled Tyre and
Nabatiyeh, 18 miles farther south.
   Amal has been locked in a 3-year-old intermittent war with the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, for control of Lebanon's
1.2 million Shiite Moslems, who make up the country's largest sect.
   By police count, more than 1,000 people have been killed and
4,000 wounded in the power struggle.

<HEAD>Communist Party Loses 765,000 Members So Far This Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Communist Party has lost 765,000 members so
far this year, leaving it with about 18 million members, the
party's personnel chief says.
   Boris Pugo says 370,000 members have joined Russian President
Boris Yeltsin and other reformers in quitting the party, about
three times the number of membership cards turned in during all of
1989.
   In addition, 125,000 members were expelled, 120,000 died and
150,000 stopped paying their membership dues or participating in
party activities, he told Tass on Wednesday.
   In the first six months of this year, 125,000 new members have
signed up, for a net loss of 765,000 members, said Pugo, chairman
of the party's Central Control Committee.
   Pugo said many people had joined the party to promote their
careers. Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has moved to
separate the government from party jobs and affairs since taking
office in 1985.
   As a result, the Communist Party has lost much prestigious along
with its constitutionally guaranteed leading role in society.
   ``The figures are not large enough to speak about a catastrophe
or an extraordinary situation in the party,'' Pugo told Tass. ``It
is not large enough to cause great concern.''
   Pugo could not say how many people have quit since the party's
28th congress ended July 13. Yeltsin stunned the meeting by
announcing he was quitting the party to concentrating on governing
the largest of the 15 Soviet republics.
   Other leading reformers, including the mayors of both Moscow and
Leningrad, have also quit.
   Party officials said between 120,000 and 130,000 people resigned
from the party last year.

   An Army commando recaptured after escaping
police custody en route to court to face two rape charges has
linked himself to nine more rapes in three other states, state
police said.
   Master Sgt. Marshall L. Brown, 37, was captured unarmed by
police early Thursday in a stolen car in an East Providence parking
lot. Police found Brown through a tip from a confidential source.
   The former Green Beret and Ranger escaped Monday after freeing
himself from handcuffs while being taken from a jail to the
courthouse for a hearing on two charges he raped two Cranston,
R.I., women. He faces life in prison if convicted on those charges.
   He also had been charged with two rapes in North Carolina, where
he was a member of the Army Special Forces stationed at Fort Bragg.
   After he was recaptured, Brown gave state police information
linking him to five rapes in North Carolina and four others in
Texas and Arizona, Lt. Brian Andrews said. Brown was cooperative,
Andrews said, but he stopped short of calling Brown's remarks a
confession.
   It was not clear whether the five North Carolina rapes included
the two for which Brown already had been charged.
   Brown, of Spring Lake, N.C., was attending a nine-week course at
the Naval Education and Training Center in Newport when Cranston
police arrested him on June 11, 1989.
   The alleged rapes outside Rhode Island occurred between November
1988 and May 1989, said Attorney General James E. O'Neil. He
declined to be more specific.
   O'Neil said additional charges of escape and theft were expected
to be filed as early as today.
   Brown most recently was a member of the Delta Force, the secret
anti-terrorist group and took part in the failed raid to free U.S.
hostages from Iran in 1980.

<HEAD>Grand Jury Indicts New York Congressman on Fraud, Tax Evasion
Charges</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD PYLE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Rep. Floyd Flake and his wife face federal
charges they embezzled more than $140,000 from a
government-subsidized housing project for the elderly and the
church where Flake is pastor.
   The indictment, unsealed Thursday after a two-year
investigation, prompted denials of any wrongdoing and at least one
allegation that some black elected officials appear to be targets
of selective prosecution.
   U.S. Attorney Andrew Maloney replied, ``We go wherever the
evidence takes us.''
   Flake, 45, was indicted on 17 counts of conspiracy, fraud and
tax evasion, and his wife Margarett, 42, was indicted on nine
counts, Maloney said.
   The Democrat who represents New York's predominantly black 6th
District in Queens was charged with diverting $141,700 from church
and housing funds for personal use and failing to report it as
taxable income.
   Flake said he had cooperated with the investigation and accused
the prosecutor of ``attempting to substitute his judgment on how a
church should manage its affairs and how a pastor should fulfill
his special duties.''
   Flake's lawyer, Gustave H. Newman, said the money was used for
``church-related activities'' and that the case would not affect
the congressman's plans to seek re-election to a third House term
in November.
   Mrs. Flake's attorney, Theodore V. Wells Jr., said his client
was added to the indictment simply because she signed joint tax
returns.
   The indictment will ``give further credence to the perception
that minority politicians don't get even-handed treatment,'' Wells
said. Similar accusations have surfaced recently regarding
Washington Mayor Marion Barry and Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley.
   Flake is pastor of the Allen African Methodist Church, which was
founded in the 1830s and has a 6,000-member congregation. It built
the 300-unit Allen Senior Citizens Apartments in 1981 with a $10
million federal loan.
   The church operates the complex with a $100,000 monthly subsidy
from the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The
indictment charged that between 1983 and 1987, the Flakes embezzled
$75,000 from the complex.
   Maloney said the money was siphoned from money set aside to
transport the elderly residents to local stores, banks and
restaurants.
   The indictment alleged that Flake took another $66,700 from a
special church ``ministerial expense fund'' account for his own use
between 1983 and 1988.
   If convicted on all 17 counts, Flake could be sentenced to a
maximum of 87 years in prison and fined up to $3.95 million. His
wife could face penalties of 55 years in prison and fines of up to
$2.1 million.
   The investigation began based on information from sources
including ``an alleged paramour'' of Flake, Maloney said, refusing
to disclose further details.

   A teen-ager arguing over a moped was shot and
killed by another teen who allegedly wanted to make a name for
himself as a tough, the latest slaying in a rash of street violence
in New York City.
   Hours later, a girl was critically wounded when a gunman opened
fire on a group of people standing on a corner.
   Since July 22 in New York, four children from 9 months to 9
years old have been killed by stray gunfire, a young advertising
executive was shot to death while using a pay telephone on a
street, and a couple was clubbed in Central Park by a deranged
attacker.
   Gunmen also have killed two more cab drivers _ Nos. 18 and 19
this year in the city _ in the past two weeks.
   Late Wednesday night, 14-year-old Shamel Knight was fatally shot
in the mouth in the borough of Queens after he told another
teen-ager to stop riding a moped that belonged to friend, police
said.
   The boy was killed by a 19-year-old who had boasted he wanted to
be a famous criminal, witnesses told The New York Times. The
suspect fled and remained loose today.
   Early Thursday in the Bronx, a gunman opened fire on a group of
people standing on a street corner, hitting Yanira Correra, 15, in
the chest. She was in critical condition at Lincoln Hospital,
police said.
   Police arrested a 20-year-old man nearby on weapons charges, but
did not know if he was involved in Correra's shooting.

<HEAD>Nikkei Plunges, Dollar Gains Against Yen</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Wraps up, adds details; no pickup.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange plummeted as the
dollar strengthened against the Japanese yen today because of
uncertainties over the Iraq-Kuwait conflict, traders said.
   The dollar finished trading at 149.35 yen, up 0.45 yen from
Thursday's close of 148.90 yen. After opening at 149.77 yen, the
U.S. currency ranged between 148.90 yen and 150.35 yen.
   On the stock market, 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 729.42
points, or 2.41 percent, ending the day at 29,515.76. It lost
592.81 points Thursday.
   ``The drop is because of nothing else but concern over the
Iraq-Kuwait situation,'' said Kenji Maeshiro, an analyst with
Yamaichi Securities Co.
   The index dropped more than 600 points early in the morning and
then narrowed the loss to 291.71 at the end of the morning session.
It fell back again in the afternoon on a rumor that Iraqi troops
were heading for the border of Saudi Arabia, Maeshiro said.
   He said large-scale arbitrage selling to take profits from price
differences between the spot and the future markets also fueled the
plunge in the last 30 minutes of the afternoon session. As a result
of the last-minute massive selling, the index ended at the day's
low.
   ``Because rumors come out one after another, market players just
could not figure out what was really happening over there, and
growing uncertainties and fears prompted selling,'' Maeshiro said.
   Iraq invaded Kuwait and took control of its capital Thursday.
   Japanese participants are sensitive to Middle East conditions
because Japan could be hurt more than any other major
industrialized nation by disruptions in oil supplies.
   Maeshiro said already-rising oil prices also discouraged buying
because of predictions that higher oil prices would lead to
inflation and delay possible U.S. action to lower interest rates to
revitalize its economy.
   North Sea Brent crude oil prices moved sharply higher today as
the market continued to react to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   By 3 p.m., Brent crude oil for September delivery was at $23.00
to 23.30 a barrel, or higher than the $22.00 late Thursday in New
York. Earlier Thursday in Tokyo, September Brent was valued at
$22.60 a barrel.
   Stock trading was thin with first section volume destimated at
430 million shares, up from Thursday's 400 million.
   In currency dealings, dollar-yen trading continued to fluctuate
nervously as market players were influenced by rumors about the
Middle East, said Toru Kanai, a foreign exchange analyst with New
Japan Securities Co.
   Following its overnight strength against the yen in New York,
the dollar opened higher and continued to rise as market players
saw little movement toward a peaceful settlement of the conflict
between Iraq and Kuwait.
   ``Participants tended to buy the dollar because they think the
dollar is a safe investment,'' Kanai said. The dollar had been
falling recently because of gloomy predictions for U.S. economic
growth.
   ``It's difficult to find any factor now to buy the yen,'' said
Yuichi Tsuchiko, a dealer with Fuji Bank.
   With uncertain prospects in the Middle East, coupled with rising
oil prices and a slump in the Tokyo stock market, Tsuchiko said
many market players adopted a wait-and-see position. Japan depends
on imports for nearly all its oil needs.
   The yield of benchmark No. 119 10-year Japanese government bonds
closed at 7.705 percent, up from Thursday's 7.615 percent finish.
Their price ended at 84.72 points, down from Thursday's 85.11
points.

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tropical Storm Cesar steadily moved across the
mid-Atlantic today from the coastal African waters where it was
born.
   Cesar was just south of the Tropic of Cancer, about 920 miles
west of the Cape Verde islands, forecaster said. They said it was
moving west-northwest near 16 mph with maximum sustained winds of
near 50 mph.
   The storm was expected to maintain that motion through Saturday,
with little change in strength, said forecaster Miles Lawrence.
   ``It's not bothering anybody right now, except maybe ships,''
said specialist Robert Molleda of the National Hurricane Center in
suburban Coral Gables.
   At 6 a.m. EDT today, Cesar was located near 19.1 north latitude
and 39.8 longitude, the center said.
   Cesar, the fourth tropical depression of the Atlantic hurricane
season, grew from a tropical wave that formed Wednesday afternoon.
On Thursday, Hurricane Bertha dissipated after striking the coast
of Newfoundland.
   Tropical depressions become storms when their top sustained
winds reach 39 mph. The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1
through Nov. 30.

<HEAD>Captive Peace Corps Worker in Philippines Endured Marxist
Propaganda</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JULIA PRODIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHEYENNE, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Peace Corps worker freed by communist
guerrillas in the Philippines wasn't harmed during 50 days of
captivity, but he had to endure droning Marxist propaganda and
tales of jungle ambush, his parents said.
   Timothy Swanson, 26, was freed Thursday by the New People's
Army. In a telephone call with parents Larry and Lynne Swanson, he
said he became fed up with guerrillas' rebel yells and communist
indoctrination.
   ``He was questioned rather heavily at first and then later I
think they tried to influence him a bit,'' his mother said. ``He
said he got so sick of revolutionary music and stories of ambush he
started to complain ... so they stopped.''
   Mrs. Swanson said her son sounded a little tired, but otherwise
was in good spirits.
   ``When he went into the Peace Corps he wanted a little
adventure. Well, he got it,'' she said, ``It's just so sad that the
world is not a place where people can help each other and not be
suspect.''
   President Bush, who met briefly with the Swansons when he
visited Cheyenne on July 20, called to congratulate the family
after the release.
   ``We thought it was very nice of him to call,'' Larry Swanson
said.
   Mrs. Swanson said her son was expected to return to the United
States on Sunday or Monday. He was scheduled for a medical
examination today and debriefing by Philippine authorities.
   Swanson was abducted him in the middle of the night June 13 on
Negros, a Philippine island. Led by three armed rebels, he hiked
for several days into the back country before reaching camp, she
said.
   ``He said he was treated well. He had no restraints. He said he
was treated pretty much as one of them,'' she said. ``Apparently,
they wanted him to see what their life was like. They may have been
trying to indoctrinate him.''
   Toward the end of Swanson's captivity, the situation became
tiresome, his mother said.
   ``His basic feeling at least during the latter part of his
captivity was mainly boredom,'' she said. ``He was sick to death of
the thing.''
   Swanson was released by the rebels shortly after a Japanese aid
worker who had been held since May 29 was freed.
   The United States suspended all Peace Corps operations in the
Philippines on June 27 and sent volunteers home because of alleged
reports that the rebels planned to target them.
   U.S. officials said they were unaware of Swanson's kidnapping
when the order was issued and learned of it June 30 when they tried
to contact him.
   The captives mother was proud of her son for joining the Peace
Corps.
   ``I'm not sorry he did what he did,'' she said. ``I believe he
was doing the right thing. I'm so proud of that kid _ I guess I
should call him a man.''

<HEAD>Thunderstorms in Florida, Skies Mostly Clear Elsewhere</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Thunderstorms broke out in Florida early today while skies were
mostly clear over the rest of the nation.
   Most of flood-plagued Texas was looking forward to a break from
rainy weather as the forecast called for a mixture of clouds and
sun. Some thunderstorm activity was expected along the Gulf Coast,
as well as in Arkansas, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia and Florida.
   A high pressure system remained over the Northeast with
continued sunny skies and low humidity expected. A band of
thunderstorms was forming over the northern central states, with
rain forecast for Minnesota, Wisconsin, South Dakota and Nebraska.
   High pressure was also expected to bring sunny skies to the
West, except for some thunderstorms in Arizona and New Mexico, with
temperatures mostly in the 90s and 100s.
   Temperatures were expected to reach the 80s in the Northeast and
Midwest, and the 90s in the South.
   The high for the nation Thursday was 109 degrees at Bullhead
City, Ariz.

   Shelling and gunfire today shook portions of
Kuwait's capital, where invading Iraqi troops sought to consolidate
their hold on the Persian Gulf nation. World reaction toughened
against Iraq.
   The U.S. aircraft carrier Independence headed to the region, and
President Bush refused to rule out direct U.S. military
intervention, calling Iraq's lightning attack Thursday on its
smaller southern neighbor ``naked aggression.''
   France said it planned to send a second warship to the gulf.
   World oil prices jumped sharply Thursday and U.S. lawmakers
demanded a worldwide boycott of Iraqi oil.
   The invasion followed weeks of threats by Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein in a dispute with Kuwait over oil, land and money. Iraq
threatened to turn the rich sheikdom into a ``graveyard'' if anyone
tried to intervene and said it installed a government to replace
the emir, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, who fled the country.
   The 21-member Arab League scheduled a closed meeting today while
Arab leaders held urgent consultations on how to respond to the
crisis.
   There was no further word on casualties. Diplomats said at least
200 Kuwaitis were killed or wounded the day before, most of them
from the government Emiri Guard.
   Shelling in Kuwait city occurred at the country's main military
barracks in the northern area of Shuwaikh and was heard throughout
the night, indicating resistance was stiffer than the first day of
the invasion.
   There was also artillery shelling on the gulf coast, 16 miles
from Shuwaikh, and two military vehicles were on fire, the
residents said, speaking by phone on condition of anonymity.
   A British Embassy official, quoted by the British news agency
Press Association, today reported explosions and gunfire along the
seafront in Kuwait City and around key installations, including the
emir's palace.
   A curfew was in force, all ports were sealed, the airport
remained closed and the three main land crossings into Kuwait were
impassable, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   By this afternoon, gulf-based diplomats speaking on condition of
anonymity said the fighting had abated.
   Telephone operators in the gulf nation of Bahrain who previously
had been able to reach Kuwait said this afternoon that lines
appeared to have been cut off.
   The sheik's government vowed to fight to win back the country, a
seemingly impossible task since Iraq has 1 million soldiers in its
army and Kuwait has 20,000.
   His radio station, beaming from an unknown location, reported
that the emir was taking charge of directing the resistance from a
``safe place.''
   Meanwhile, a spokesman at the U.S. Embassy said three Americans
had been seized by the Iraqis from the Shuaiba oil refinery.
   He indicated that the Iraqis had taken them to help run the
refinery and ``not as any particular threat'' to the Americans
within Kuwait.
   The spokesman, who could not be named under embassy rules, said
the Iraqis were not hostile to Americans. Soldiers escorted
Americans they met on the streets to their homes and were
``treating them very well,'' he said.
   Nearly 4,000 Americans are among the large expatriate community
in Kuwait, where more than 60 percent of the 1.9 million residents
are foreigners. Iraq has 17 million residents.
   Iraq recently accused Kuwait of stealing oil. It claimed its
troops entered Kuwait at the request of revolutionaries who it said
had staged a coup. Kuwaiti and other diplomats said the coup report
was a farce.
   Iraqi troops backed by 350 tanks and air cover swept into Kuwait
before dawn Thursday, meeting brave but ultimately ineffective
resistance from the vastly outnumbered Kuwaitis, said the
diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Iraqi soldiers were making sweeps today through the southern
oilfields near Saudi Arabia, according to residents and Lloyds'
insurance service in London.
   Izzat Ibrahim, deputy chairman of Iraq's ruling Revolutionary
Command Council, flew to Saudi Arabia today on an official visit,
the Iraq News Agency reported. The two oil giants have a
non-aggression pact.
   In the United States, members of Congress, after briefings by
intelligence officials, expressed fears that Iraq's next target
could be Saudi Arabia.
   However, a well-informed diplomatic source in the gulf reported
no movement of Iraqi troops into Saudi Arabia or directly across
the Iraq-Saudi Arabian border.
   The invasion of Kuwait brought universal condemnation and
sanctions.
   The U.N. Security Council on Thursday denounced the occupation
and demanded that Iraq withdraw its troops immediately.
   More countries joined the United States in denouncing the
invasion, including South Korea, New Zealand, Malaysia, Thailand,
Indonesia, China, Singapore.
   The Soviet Union, Iraq's biggest arms supplier, announced a
suspension of shipments to Iraq. The United States froze Iraqi
assets and blocked most Iraqi imports, including its most important
revenue source _ oil.
   The United States, Britain and France froze Kuwaiti assets
Thursday to protect the holdings from Iraqi occupiers. Japan and
West Germany were among other nations that followed suit today,
officials said.
   Iraq responded to the American moves by freezing repayment of
Iraqi debts to the United States, the official Iraqi News Agency
reported. The total size of the debt is unclear. Last year, the
United States provided $1 billion in agricultural credits to Iraq.
   Iraq began threatening Kuwait two weeks ago after accusing it of
stealing oil from a border region claimed by both nations. It also
accused Kuwait of depriving it of oil revenues by cheating on OPEC
oil cartel production quotas, thus driving down oil prices.
   Talks to resolve the dispute broke down Wednesday, and diplomats
said Iraq had moved about 100,000 soldiers to the Kuwait border.
   It was unclear whether the takeover would slow or halt Kuwait's
oil production, but it seemed to signal an important shift in the
balance of world oil power.
   Private analysts said Thursday in the United States countries
dependent on imported oil now face new economic risks. The United
States gets half its oil from abroad, 10 percent of which comes
from Iraq and Kuwait.
   By grabbing control of Kuwait, Saddam added about 94 billion
barrels of oil reserves to his country's own 100 billion barrels,
second only to Saudi Arabia, according to the American Petroleum
Institute, an industry trade group.
   Iraq, larger than California, has coveted New Jersey-sized
Kuwait for decades. Their common border was left undemarcated upon
Kuwait's independence from Britain in 1961.

   France will station a second warship in the Persian
Gulf because of Iraq's invasion of neighboring Kuwait, acting
Premier Pierre Beregovoy said today.
   Beregovoy said a second gunboat, or corvette, will be sent to
the region, but he did not say when it would be dispatched.
   France had planned to replace one ship with the other, Beregovoy
said in a radio interview. He is finance minister but acting head
of government while Prime Minister Michel Rocard is on vacation.
   The government decided to leave the first gunboat in place ``and
the one that was supposed to replace it will join it'' in the gulf,
Beregovoy told Radio-Television Luxembourg in an interview
broadcast in France. He did not say when the second ship would
arrive.
   Iraqi troops and tanks swarmed across the border into oil-rich
Kuwait early Thursday, shelling parts of Kuwait city and sending
the country's leaders fleeing to Saudi Arabia. The U.N. Security
Council denounced the invasion.
   ``We must now examine under what conditions the decisions of the
United Nations can be respected, that is, the immediate withdrawal
of Iraqi forces from Kuwait,'' Beregovoy said.
   He noted that France acted along with other Western nations in
freezing assets of Iraq and Kuwait, the latter mainly to protect
them from seizure by Iraq, and by halting arms sales to Iraq.

   The dollar gained against the Japanese yen but
retreated against other key currencies today. The dollar was well
down from its peaks a day earlier in a flurry of reaction to Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait.
   Gold prices were lower.
   In Tokyo, the dollar finished trading at 149.35 yen, up 0.45 yen
from Thursday's close of 148.90 yen. Later in London, the dollar
was quoted at 149.37.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday:
   _ 1.5925 West German marks, down from 1.5970
   _ 1.3515 Swiss francs, down from 1.3570
   _ 5.3375 French francs, down from 5.3510
   _ 1.7950 Dutch guilders, down from 1.7985
   _ 1,165.00 Italian lire, down from 1,168.50
   _ 1.1518 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1519
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.8583 from $1.8495 late
Thursday.
   Dollar-yen trading continued to fluctuate nervously as market
players were influenced by rumors about the Middle East, said Toru
Kanai, a foreign exchange analyst with New Japan Securities Co.
   Following its overnight strength against the yen in New York,
the dollar opened higher and continued to rise as market players
saw little movement toward a peaceful settlement of the conflict
between Iraq and Kuwait.
   ``Participants tended to buy the dollar because they think the
dollar is a safe investment,'' Kanai said. The dollar had been
falling recently because of gloomy predictions for U.S. economic
growth.
   ``It's difficult to find any factor now to buy the yen,'' said
Yuichi Tsuchiko, a dealer with Fuji Bank in Tokyo.
   Gold in London was quoted at $375.80 a troy ounce at the morning
fixing, down from $378.75 bid late Thursday.
   In Zurich, gold was quoted at $375.75 from $379.00 bid late
Thursday.
   Silver bullion in London was quoted at a bid price of $4.85 a
troy ounce from $.87 bid late Thursday.

<HEAD>Swiss Blast Away at World's Biggest Target Shoot</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Swiss have lived up to their
trigger-happy reputation at the ``symphony of shots,'' expending
4,450,000 bullets in a barrage of gunfire at the Federal Shooting
Fest.
   The biggest recreational shooting contest of its kind worldwide
has ended in the industrial city of Winterthur, 220 miles northeast
of Geneva, and organizers called it a blazing success.
   For 17 days through last Sunday, more than 80,000 men and women
took turns blasting away at 463 targets on 16 shooting ranges from
7:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m. ``Winterthur has demonstrated that the
interest in our sport is unbroken,'' said Hans Zuercher, central
secretary of the Federal Shooters' Association.
   It was a ``refreshing contrast from the gloom and doom that has
been spreading in the past few years,'' said Willy Loretan, a Swiss
parliamentary deputy.
   ``It's high time for us Swiss to show more joy and optimism. We
do not want to be viewed any longer as European champions of
humorlessness,'' he said.
   The Tages-Anzeiger newspaper of Zurich described it as a
``symphony of shots.''
   Target shooting is highly popular in Switzerland, although a
national referendum last November showed an ebbing of popular
support for the citizens' army, the main promoter of marksmanship.
   Shooting has been a hallowed tradition among the Swiss ever
since _ as legend has it _ William Tell sent an arrow through an
apple on his son's head about 700 years ago.
   The 580,000 organized shooters in a nation of 6.7 million have
plenty of opportunity to practice their marksmanship.
   Even the tiniest village has easy access to one of the 3,000
ranges scattered throughout the country. On almost every weekend
from April to September, firing echoes through Alpine valleys.
   Part of the practice is obligatory. Every soldier of the Swiss
militia army between the ages of 20 and 42 annually is required to
achieve a certain minimum score in shooting at targets during
off-duty practice.
   This system means 423,000 automatic rifles are kept in Swiss
homes. Every militia man discharged at age 50 can keep his weapon
as private property, allowing him to continue practice unless he
decides to sell the rifle on the second-hand market.
   It makes for a lot of guns in a nation pledged to permanent
neutrality, which last saw fighting 143 years ago in a one-month
civil war that claimed 138 dead. Yet military weapons are rarely
used to commit crimes in this largely violence-free country.
   Participants at Wintherthur ranged in age from 16 to 95-year-old
Sepp Walker, who scored above average with his carbine.
   Overall best marksman was Malcolm Cooper, Britain's double
Olympic gold medalist in shooting.
   His foreign passport barred him from becoming a ``King,'' the
title bestowed on the top finishers in the various categories of
the competition.
   Attention focused on the debut of the 22-inch Model 90 automatic
rifle, with which the army is replacing its current 33-year-old
version.
   Tests suggest that what Swiss newspapers described as a ``wonder
weapon'' is of very high precision.
   Demand for the private, non-automatic version, which sells for
$,680, has outstripped supply. Delivery time is more than a month.
So far more than 22,000 have been sold, compared with 30,000
delivered to the army.
   ``It's lighter and handier than the '57 model,'' said Zuercher.
``That is one reason why there is increasing interest in
marksmanship among women and girls. There is a definite trend.''
   One of the 3,400 female participants, 18-year-old Corinne Haas,
turned in a better performance with the new rifle than two Swiss
army generals.

Explosives</HEAD>

   The government struggled to
restore order and prepared to search the Parliament building for
bombs following the surrender of Moslem radicals who held
government officials hostage.
   Security forces on Thursday fired warning shots at looters still
plaguing the capital. A state of emergency imposed during the
six-day hostage standoff that ended Wednesday remained in effect.
   Government spokesman Gregory Shaw said a regional security force
of 300 led by a Jamaican colonel was to arrive today ``to guard
installations, thereby freeing local forces to patrol.'' He did not
specify which countries were involved.
   Soldiers said they would send demolition experts into the
Parliament Building, which they have stayed out of because they
feared time-delayed explosives. During the standoff, the radicals
threatened to blow up their hostages.
   The government says at least 30 people died before the hostages
were freed Wednesday, and authorities expect to find more bodies in
the legislative building and the burned-out police headquarters.
   A government Cabinet minister held by Moslem radicals said
Thursday she repeatedly believed ``I was going to die.''
   ``They decided that all of us were expendable,'' she said.
   Jennifer Johnson, Minister of Sports and Culture, went on state
television to discuss her hostage ordeal.
   The Moslem rebels launched their revolt last Friday by storming
Parliament and broadcast buildings in the capital, and rebel leader
Abu Bakr declared his forces to be in control of the Caribbean
island off northeast Venezuela.
   However, the uprising never attracted popular support, and
government forces surrounded the rebels and their captives. The
standoff ended Wednesday with the release of the hostages and the
surrender of 112 rebels.
   Prime Minister Arthur N.R. Robinson, still recovering in a
hospital from several ailments including a gunshot to the leg, was
freed Tuesday.
   Bakr and his followers were being held at the Chaguaramas
military headquarters, about 10 miles from the capital.
   Shaw said the government was studying what charges to bring
against them. He indicated they could be accused of murder,
kidnapping or treason, which carries the death penalty.
   Bakr is a former policeman who converted to Islam and considers
himself a champion of the downtrodden. He had accused Robinson of
corruption and blamed him for widespread poverty in this once
oil-rich nation of 1.3 million people.

<HEAD>Newsrooms Should Hire More Black Journalists, Group Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Newspapers should hire more black and other
minority journalists to accurately reflect the country's racial
composition, says the vice president of the National Association of
Black Journalists.
   ``America is browner and tanner and is going to continue to be
in the future and the industry must reflect that perspective and
diverse view of the world through the people it hires,'' Denise
Johnson said Thursday.
   Johnson made her comments at the association's annual
convention, which some 2,000 people are attending.
   Hiring rates for minorities in journalism have increased little
in recent years, according to a report by the American Society of
Newspaper Editors released at the convention's start on Wednesday.
   The report found that 4 percent of newsroom employees, including
reporters, editors, artists and photographers, were minorities in
1978, compared to 7.86 percent this year. Blacks now account for 4
percent of the newsroom population, the highest percentage among
all minority groups.
   ``If you look at the percentages and how slowly the industry has
moved to respond to a very rapidly changing population, the
progress isn't nearly as impressive,'' said Johnson, an editorial
writer and columnist for the Saint Paul (Minn.) Pioneer Press.
   The report also said that 4 percent of newspapers across the
United States employ no minorities.
   ``Most institutions in this country are still pretty much
dominated by white middle-age males and I think the tendency on
their part is to look out over the staff of people they direct and
take under their wing a person who reminds them of themselves,''
Johnson said.
   Editors surveyed by the ASNE said the most frequent reasons for
not hiring more minorities include the lack of qualified journalism
graduates, poor starting salaries and a lack of commitment to
affirmative-action hiring.
   The study queried more than 300 newspaper editors, said
Cornelius Foote Jr., minority affairs director of the ASNE.

<HEAD>Sandinista Peasants Seize Agriculture Minister's Ranch</HEAD>
<HEAD>By FILADELFO ALEMAN</HEAD>
<HEAD>Associated Press Writer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Peasants loyal to the former leftist
Sandinista government have seized a ranch belonging to the minister
of agriculture, protesting the takeover of Sandinista cooperatives
by backers of the new government.
   The pro-Sandinista newspaper Barricada published a picture
Thursday of the peasants hoisting machetes at the ranch's main gate.
   The hacienda owned by Agriculture Minister Roberto Rondon, a
member of the new conservative government, was seized Wednesday
about 10 miles northeast of Juigalpa in Chontales province, about
100 miles southeast of Managua.
   ``We will stay at the hacienda until the government returns
various haciendas that (government) sympathizers have invaded here
and in other regions,'' vowed Carlos Espinoza, a member of the
Association of Field Workers.
   Espinoza also said Thursday that government sympathizers and
former Contra rebels have threatened to take over another
Sandinista cooperative.
   The seizures follow complaints that the new government of
Violeta Barrios de Chamorro that assumed power from the Sandinistas
in April is not responding quickly enough to demands for land
distribution.
   When the government took power, it said lands confiscated by the
Sandinistas would be returned to their previous owners.
   The decree angered the Sandinistas and provoked a strike in July
that grew into full-scale riots, killing at least seven people and
injuring 100.
   As part of the settlement, the government agreed to suspend the
decree.
   Gustavo Tablada, director of the Institute for Agrarian Reform,
said a resolution to the dispute is being sought ``through dialogue
and not coercion.''
   The seizures began July 19 when peasants sympathetic to the
National Opposition Union, which carried Mrs. Chamorro to the
presidency in free elections, took over two haciendas in La
Concepcion, 25 miles east of Managua.
   Pro-government peasants invaded the haciendas the day Sandinista
cooperative workers traveled to Managua to commemorate the 11th
anniversary of the revolution that brought the Sandinistas to power.
   When they returned, they found the pro-government sympathizers
armed with machetes and rifles taking cover in trenches.
   A fight followed in which an opposition union sympathizer was
shot to death, witnesses said.
   On July 27, pro-government peasants and recently demobilized
Contra rebels took over another hacienda about 60 miles southeast
of Juigalpa.

   Jurors split over whether a man
convicted of killing his stepson during potty training by
repeatedly plunging him headfirst into a toilet should be sentenced
to death in the electric chair.
   The tie vote Thursday is interpreted by the court as a
recommendation for a life sentence for 23-year-old Thomas Coe. A
simple majority of the 12 jurors was necessary to recommend the
death penalty.
   Circuit Judge Randall McDonald set sentencing for Aug. 17. The
judge can overrule the panel.
   Coe was convicted Monday of first-degree murder and aggravated
child abuse in the July 28, 1989, death of Bradley McGee.
   ``That man deserves to die for murdering Bradley McGee,''
prosecutor John Aguero told jurors Thursday.
   Aguero said the 2-year-old was repeatedly slammed headfirst into
the toilet, pulled out of the bowl and plunged into a cold bath,
then forced into the living room and beaten unconscious.
   Defense attorneys appealed for compassion and understanding,
urging the panel to spare Coe's life. He was a loner with suicidal
tendencies who was an outcast among peers because of illnesses, and
was subjected to abuse from his parents, they said.
   The final witness Thursday in the trial's penalty phase was
psychologist Harry Krop, who testified the killer had been a
severely abused child.
   He came from a home where his mother was critical and
judgmental, his father hit him with a switch to teach him to defend
himself, Krop said.
   Coe was born with painful kidney and hip defects, wore a
catheter until he was 5, was hospitalized more than 30 times and
walked with a limp, the panel was told.
   ``He even failed at suicide ... twice ... once with a gun and
once with a rope,'' Krop said.
   Coe's 21-year-old wife, Sheryl McGee Coe, pleaded no contest to
second-degree murder and aggravated child abuse in her son's death
and testified against her husband. She is serving a 30-year prison
term.
   Bradley had been under state care from the age of 4 months, when
his mother abandoned him. The social worker who recommended Bradley
be returned to his mother and Coe _ two months before his death _
was convicted earlier this year of child abuse.

<TEXT>
   Unusually hot weather in Europe
has killed five people in Spain and caused Greece's worst drought
in 100 years.
   Between late June and late July, temperatures of up to 109
degrees were recorded twice in the southern region of Andalusia,
where three people died because of the heat. Two more deaths
occurred in the northwestern city of Vigo.
   Those have been the only fatalities reported so far, and
temperatures in most southern European nations remain well below
record levels.
   Dutch forecasters insisted Thursday that the nation was not
facing what could be officially termed a heat wave.
   But temperatures of well over 86 degrees have hit France,
Britain and the Netherlands, whose residents normally use the
holiday season to flee their rain-prone climes for sunnier weather
in southern Europe.
   The hot weather has been news on front pages in France and the
Netherlands, where it was the lead story in several Thursday
morning newspapers.
   ``Heat Becomes Nuisance,'' said a headline in the Rotterdam
newspaper Algemeen Dagblad. Amsterdam's De Telegraaf said, ``Dutch
Learning To Cope With Heat.''
   A third newspaper, Trouw, used up almost half of its front page
quoting what it called an ``interior environmental physicist.''
   The expert, J. Vorenkamp, explained his ``window discipline''
theory _ opening windows at night and keeping them closed at day to
make the most of a building's natural insulation.
   In England, authorities blamed the heat for stopping the famous
Big Ben bell in London's Houses of Parliament for more than three
hours Wednesday.
   At Colchester Zoo in England visitors were asked to bring leaves
to feed its two baby elephants, Tania and Zola, because normal feed
supplies of willow, sweet chestnut, poplar and oak leaves had been
destroyed in the drought.
   More serious, however, is the drought that has been afflicting
much of the continent since the spring.
   In Greece, authorities described the drought situation as the
worst in 100 years and set up a plan to ship water to Athens by
supertanker if the need should arise.
   Although water rates in the Greek capital have been tripled in
an effort to cut consumption, reservoirs are expected to run dry by
November, when the rainy season usually starts.
   In Italy, rainfall from Jan. 1 to July 20 this year was nearly
40 percent below the average of the last 30 years, according to a
Weather Bureau spokesman, Lt. Col. Paolo Ernani.
   The national weather service reported that temperatures in Italy
during late July and early August were 7.2 degrees higher than
average.
   Forest fires fanned by the drought raged in Portugal and Spain,
where many were believed to have been set by arsonists.
   Portuguese National Fire Service chief Cristiano Santos said his
men were exhausted after fighting fires that have destroyed more
than 61,750 acres of forest, bush and farm land since mid-June.
   Santos told Portugal's Lusa news agency there were 27 percent
more fires between June 15 and July 23 than during the same period
last year.
   Drought conditions in Belgium prompted authorities to ban
watering gardens, washing cars and filling up private swimming
pools in two of the nation's nine provinces.

<DATELINE>KALAPANA, Hawaii (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lava from Kilauea Volcano crept along
the Black Sand Beach, closing one of the island's most popular
beaches to tourists and forcing some residents from their homes.
   A lava flow about 500 yards wide engulfed about half of Kaimu
Bay and the beach on the southeast coast of the island of Hawaii,
Glenn Sodayasu of the Hawaii County civil defense agency said
Thursday night.
   The inland part of the flow was some 350 yards away from the
closest of nine houses that have been evacuated, he said. Residents
of 40 other homes nearby were told to prepare to leave.
   ``It's a stressful time for these people, who have to move out
of their homes,'' civil defense spokesman Wendell Hatada said.
``They've lived there most of their lives, mostly, and a lot of
them have lived there for generations.''
   Visitors were prohibited from the area so residents could move
their belongings without throngs of tourists clogging the narrow
two-lane road.
   The area is one of the island's best surfing spots, with the
exotic beach a favorite of residents, tourists and photographers.
It is used often as a backdrop for commercials.
   Lava began flowing from the Kupaianaha vent 15 miles east of
Kilauea crater Wednesday night after a two-day pause.
   Trade winds helped blow ``laze'' out to sea, Civil Defense
spokesman John Katsky said. Laze, a mixture of lava and ocean water
that forms hydrochloric acid, poses health hazards, especially to
people with respiratory problems.
   Lava from Kilauea Volcano has destroyed 169 homes, parks,
several businesses, a church and other historical sites since its
current eruption began Jan. 3, 1983.
   Damage is estimated at more than $61 million, and the Kalapana
area was declared a federal disaster area.

<HEAD>Magistrate Gives Banks Two Weeks to Provide Noriega Records</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILL LESTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A lawyer for Manuel Noriega says a magistrate's
decision to order three European banks to provide records of his
accounts should help find millions of dollars needed for the ousted
Panamanian leader's defense.
   U.S. Magistrate William Turnoff on Thursday gave the three banks
14 days to provide detailed records. Noriega's lead attorney, Frank
Rubino, subpoenaed the documents late last month.
   ``We're thrilled because this now gives us the ability to find
out which accounts had the funds in them,'' Rubino said. ``We have
the right to say which accounts are unfrozen. We don't want
accounts unfrozen that have three dollars in them.''
   The U.S. government agreed in June to help the defense unfreeze
between $4 million and $6 million from various European accounts so
Noriega could pay his lawyers.
   Rubino said it was the first time a federal court has backed a
private litigant's effort to examine foreign bank records.
   ``It's the first time a private person has broken the banking
secrecy law,'' Rubino said after the magistrate's hearing.
   Noriega, who surrendered to U.S. troops on Jan. 4 following the
invasion of Panama, is being held in a jail outside Miami on
charges he took $4.6 million in bribes to protect the Colombian
cocaine trade.
   Turnoff heard more than two ho7.2. The index fell 34.5
points on Thursday.
   Volume came to 290.3 million shares at midday, compared with
339.2 million shares at the same time Thursday.
   Analysts said the price rise reflected some bargain-hunting and
demand for oil stocks, dealers said.
   But one dealer said that some oil stocks have run their course
and are meeting resistance as investors take profits.

   A drunken burglar who passed out while
robbing a couple's home was sentenced to a year in jail after
pleading guilty to felony charges.
   William Spencer Castro, 21, an undocumented alien from El
Salvador, was also sentenced Wednesday to one year of house arrest,
placed on five years' probation and ordered to attend Alcoholics
Anonymous meetings.
   Castro admitted he had about 20 beers before he broke into the
home in suburban Van Nuys in March, authorities said.
   Carrying a 7-inch kitchen knife, Castro filled his pockets with
jewelry, money and other items. He then passed out next to the
couple's bed, authorities said.
   Betty Bernds, 83, discovered Castro on the floor about 2 a.m.
March 26 when she accidentally stepped on him as she got out of bed
to help her husband, Edward, 84. Castro was still unconscious when
police arrived.

   Iraq's conquest of Kuwait increases the chances
of another Arab-Israeli conflict and heightens Jordan's importance
as a buffer state, Israeli analysts say.
   Amatzia Baram, an Iraq specialist at Haifa University, said
today that the Israelis had warned U.S. Defense Secretary Richard
Cheney last month that an Iraqi military strike against Kuwait was
likely. Baram said the Americans apparently discounted the warnings
as self-serving.
   But Defense Ministry spokesman Dan Naveh denied the report,
saying Defense Minister Moshe Arens raised the subject of possible
Iraqi aggression but did not specifically mention Kuwait when he
met with Cheney in Washington.
   Naveh, however, said Israel never ruled out the possibility of
an invasion.
   The Hadashot daily quoted a senior military intelligence
officer, Brig. Gen. Dani Rothschild, as saying Israel expected an
attack after Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein moved thousands of troops
to the Kuwaiti border last month.
   ``You don't consolidate forces like that in order to do
nothing,'' Rothschild was quoted as telling a parliamentary
committee Thursday, the day of the invasion. But Rothschild and
other intelligence officials reportedly said that the timing and
scale of the invasion were unexpected.
   Experts said Thursday that the crisis could bring Israel
together with moderate Arab countries and the United States in a
tacit alliance to limit Iraq's future reach.
   Iraq, one of the Jewish state's fiercest foes, had escalated its
anti-Israeli rhetoric before taking on neighboring Kuwait in a
dispute over oil, borders and money.
   Israel is concerned that Jordan, which shares a 225-mile border
with Israel, may be the next target for Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein in his quest for expanded influence in the region.
   ``Jordan has taken on tremendous importance as a buffer state
now for Israel,'' said Joseph Alpher of Tel Aviv University's
Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies.
   Dore Gold, also of the Jaffee Center, said Iraq ``has
demonstrated what happens to countries that try to oppose it.''
   ``If Jordan sees the other Arab states and the United States are
not supporting it against Iraq, it will not stand up to Iraq,'' he
said. ``Jordan will then do anything Saddam Hussein requests.''
   An Iraqi force backed by 350 tanks and warplanes invaded its
oil-rich neighbor early Thursday morning. The invading army quickly
assumed control of the small emirate and set up a provisional
government.
   Politicians seemed to have hope Thursday that the United States
and other Western leaders would take Israeli fears of Iraq more
seriously than in the past.
   ``The character of Saddam Hussein has been revealed to the West
and the democratic countries that had illusions about the man,''
said Arens, speaking on Israel radio.
   Iraq has threatened it would attack Israel with chemical weapons
if Israel attacked any Arab nation.
   The invasion may also lead to greater ``strategic cooperation''
between Israel and the United States, said Eliyahu Ben-Elissar,
chairman of the Parliament's Defense and Foreign Affairs Committee
and a prominent member of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's
right-wing Likud bloc.
   Other analysts said the conflict would reduce U.S. pressure on
Israel to make painful concessions in order to move the stalled
peace process with the Palestinians forward.
   ``This is the biggest present Iraq could give Israel,'' said
reserve Brig. Gen. Aharon Levran, a strategic analyst. ``Saddam has
created a new focus of conflict and worry in the region.''

<HEAD>Former Civic Leader Sentenced for Role in Drug Smuggling Ring</HEAD>

   A former Indianapolis civic leader received
a nine-year prison sentence after a federal judge told her he
couldn't understand how she could participate in sending marijuana
to the same kinds of poor neighborhoods she helped.
   ``It's hard for me to look at this record and make some
conclusion as to what in the world is going on in your mind,'' U.S.
District Judge Larry J. McKinney told Linda Leary on Thursday.
   Leary, 59, pleaded guilty in February to being involved in a $50
million marijuana smuggling ring in the late 1970s and early 1980s.
   Her sons, Paul B. Heilbrunn, 35, and Richard S. Heilbrunn, 38,
are accused of running the operation and are scheduled for a Feb.
13 trial.
   McKinney said he had received several letters from people who
depicted Leary as a caring woman involved in child-care centers,
inner-city school immunization programs and similar projects in
poverty-stricken areas.
   He said it is ``incredibly ironic'' that at the same time she
also was part of a conspiracy that brought marijuana into poor
neighborhoods.
   A tearful Leary asked the judge to give her a chance to ``try to
build a life with value.''
   She added that she has to live with the problems she's caused
her family.
   ``They have been so hurt and so troubled by all of this, and I
can't undo that,'' said Leary, former president of the Indianapolis
League of Women Voters and of the Indianapolis chapter of the
National Council of Jewish Women.
   Her lawyer, Bernard L. Pylitt, had argued for leniency, saying
Leary was a devoted mother and grandmother ``who closed her eyes to
right and wrong'' because she loved her sons.
   ``I'm here to consider more than just one mother,'' McKinney
responded later. ``I'm here to represent a lot of mothers, and
fathers, and kids.''
   McKinney sentenced Leary to nine years for conspiracy to possess
with intent to distribute marijuana and to a concurrent five-year
term on a racketeering charge. The second charge stemmed from her
control over a trust account in the Cayman Islands that was used to
launder marijuana profits.
   McKinney also gave Leary credit for more than one year of prison
time she already has served and ordered her to forfeit about
$200,000 in assets obtained through drug money.
   The judge said he would recommend to the Bureau of Prisons that
Leary serve the rest of her sentence at the Federal Correctional
Institute in Lexington, Ky., where she has been held since February.
   Under the plea agreement, Leary could be required to testify
against her sons.
   Thursday's sentencing modified a temporary 20-year sentence
McKinney ordered for Leary in February so that she could go to the
Kentucky prison for medical evaluation.
   Leary and her sons fled to Austria in 1985 after learning that a
federal grand jury was probing allegations the Heilbrunns were
directing a multistate smuggling operation. Leary, her sons and
more than 30 other people were indicted Nov. 20, 1987.
   She and the Heilbrunns were arrested in May 1989 in Austria.
They were extradited to the United States last December.

   Harrison Ford worked as a carpenter before he
struck gold as an actor, and finding a month to do nothing but make
furniture is now one of his unfulfilled fantasies.
   Ford took up carpentry to pay the bills before landing a role in
``Star Wars'' in 1977, he tells US magazine in its Aug. 20 issue.
   His most recent foray into carpentry was about a year ago when
he built a bed for his 3-year-old son, Malcolm.
   ``He watched me make it. But I'm sure he thinks that everybody's
dad makes their bed,'' Ford said.
   Today, after an Oscar nomination for ``Witness'' and with the
``Indiana Jones'' series on his resume, he earns about $10 million
per film.
   His latest is ``Presumed Innocent,'' in which he plays a
big-city prosecutor accused of murdering a colleague-lover.
   Ford, 48, says carpentry is something he'd like more time for.
   ``I'd like to actually have a month and actually not do anything
else but work on some furniture, work on honing those skills which
I haven't practiced for so long,'' he said.

   Two accused cocaine traffickers were
extradited from Colombia today to be prosecuted by the Justice
Department, the U.S. Marshals Service announced.
   K. Michael Moore, director of the service, said Colombian
authorities turned over David Posada and Martin Alonso Gil in
Bogota. The two arrived in Miami about 5 a.m., the announcement
said.
   Posada, a 44-year-old Colombian also known as Humberto Vega, was
arrested by Colombian police in February. An indictment returned in
September charged that he and two other men knowingly possessed
cocaine with intent to distribute it in Miami in 1985 and 1986.
   A separate indictment charged the 24-year-old Gil, a native of
Colombia, and his brother, Jose Fernando Gil, with conspiracy to
possess cocaine and possession of cocaine with intent to distribute
it in the Miami area in 1989.
   At the time of the indictment, the brothers were living in
Hialeah, Fla. They were arrested by Colombian authorities in
Medellin in January. Jose Fernando Gil was extradited last month.
   Marshal Daniel J. Horgan of the Southern District of Florida
said the defendants were being held pending arraignment.
   Twenty-two people have been extradited since Colombia began an
anti-drug drive last August.

<TEXT>
   An ``intimate relationship'' with a woman lay
minister who claims another priest fathered her child led to the
resignation of Atlanta Archbishop Eugene A. Marino, the nation's
highest-ranking black Roman Catholic.
   Marino resigned June 1 after the church began investigating his
relationship with Vicki R. Long, said Bishop James P. Lyke,
appointed acting administrator of the Atlanta Archdiocese.
   Lyke declined to say Thursday whether Marino would have been
asked to quit, or whether the relationship was a sexual one.
   ``I assume that as the result of a two-year relationship, X-Y-Z
would have happened,'' he said at a news conference.
   The relationship, first reported Wednesday, came to the
attention of church officials in the spring with an anonymous tip,
Lyke said. An investigation began May 3, and Marino agreed to
relinquish administration of the archdiocese until the
investigation was complete, he said.
   At the time, it was announced that Marino had relinquished his
duties because of stress and a near heart attack.
   Church officials later said Marino resigned on July 10, but Lyke
said Thursday he actually submitted his resignation to Vatican
officials June 1.
   Lyke said church officials were not lying when they announced
that Marino had resigned for ``personal reasons'' and to seek
``appropriate spiritual, medical and psychological therapy.''
   ``That was true,'' Lyke said. ``What was not announced was that
the personal reasons involved an intimate relationship with a
woman, entered into shortly after his arrival in Atlanta in May
1988 and sustained during the next two years.''
   Lyke would not reveal details, but said Ms. Long, a Catholic
from suburban Riverdale, has made a monetary claim against the
archdiocese. He would not disclose the amount she has sought.
   The archdiocese granted Ms. Long ``charity payments'' earlier
this year for medical bills, but Lyke would not say how much, when
or why.
   Ms. Long had been receiving $1,500 monthly payments apparently
from Marino, and Lyke emphasized that those payments were not
church money. He refused to speculate on how the archbishop could
have afforded such an amount.
   Church officials have declined to say where Marino is; he was
last said to be recuperating in New York.
   Ms. Long refused to comment Wednesday when asked about the
allegations. She could not be reached Thursday because her
telephone number is unlisted. Members of St. John the Evangelist
Church, where she is a member, declined to reveal her whereabouts.
   In 1987, Ms. Long filed a $2.3 million lawsuit charging that a
Catholic priest from Columbus fathered her child. Blood tests
concluded that the priest, the Rev. Donal Keohane, with whom she
had a four-year relationship, did not father the child born in May
1986, but the church is paying child support.
   ``Certainly priests are tremendously vulnerable from the inside
because of their own sexual drives and from the outside because
they become very attractive sexual targets,'' said A.W. Richard
Sipe, a former Benedictine monk now practicing psychotherapy in
Baltimore.
   Sipe conducted a 25-year study of priests, to be published next
month, that concluded that half of all priests break celibacy vows.
   ``The unusual thing with this is it's being discussed,'' he
said, noting that church officials usually don't comment on church
scandals.
   The revelations have triggered anew the continuing debate over
whether celibacy, a discipline required of Roman Catholic priests
since the Middle Ages, is appropriate in the 20th century.
   Celibacy has not always been enforced _ three times in the 10th
century popes were elected who were the sons of priests or former
popes.
   The Rev. Thomas Reese at Georgetown University said the most
recent bishop to leave the church and marry was James Shannon, an
auxiliary bishop of St. Paul, Minn., in the late 1960s.
   In 1971, the National Federation of Priests Councils voted in
favor of making celibacy optional. And support groups for women and
priests who have had sexual relationships are starting _ one in
Pennsylvania has about 1,200 members, three-fourths of whom are
priests.

   The jury in Marion Barry's drug and perjury
trial began its first full day of deliberations today after a
six-week trial at which the mayor's defense team admitted that he
occasionally used cocaine.
   ``No one can suffer any more pain or shame or hurt than me,''
Barry said outside the U.S. District Court building Thursday. In
closing arguments, the government accused him of having ``lived
above the law.''
   Barry engaged in ``occasional'' cocaine use, but the government
failed to prove the drug possession, conspiracy and perjury charges
against him, defense lawyer R. Kenneth Mundy told the jury in
closing arguments.
   The jury of two whites and 10 blacks spent about an hour
deliberating Thursday after being instructed not to consider
``politics or race'' when deciding the 14 criminal charges.
   The nine-woman, three-man jury's first decision Thursday was
selecting a foreman, Edward Eagles, one of the two whites.
   The mayor said he is ``rather anxious, obviously, with the fate
of Marion Barry in the hands of 12 people.''
   Barry's public anti-drug stance ``was someone trying, in his own
frailty, to say, `This is wrong,''' said Mundy, adding that the
mayor's accusers are ``facile liars'' and ``little Lucifers.''
   Charles Lewis, a convicted cocaine dealer, is ``the eternal
salesperson selling himself to the jury,'' the defense attorney
said.
   Restaurateur Hassan Mohammadi _ who testified he and Barry used
cocaine together _ is a frequent government witness who played the
``notes to the tune that the government wrote for him,'' Mundy said.
   Mundy asserted the mayor was a victim of entrapment by the FBI,
which had an undercover agent supply the crack cocaine that Barry
smoked in a videotaped sting operation that culminated in his
arrest Jan. 18.
   The exhaustive federal investigation of Barry's drug use
amounted to ``using a sledgehammer to kill a fly,'' the defense
lawyer said.
   ``If Mr. Barry's drug use were so rampant, he could have been
discovered in a more traditional way,'' Mundy said. ``The cure is
many-fold worse than the ailment.''
   Assistant U.S. attorney Richard Roberts responded by saying that
``Marion Barry lived above the law.
   ``He lived one step ahead of anyone who was looking at him,''
Roberts added.
   The mayor ``lied to the public. ... The sad fact is, Marion
Barry was out to get himself,'' said the prosecutor, who urged the
jury to return a guilty verdict on all counts.
   Roberts, who is black, scoffed at suggestions that the mayor was
the victim of a political or racial vendetta.
   Roberts urged the jurors to remember the 10 government witnesses
who testified about Barry's alleged cocaine use and not join his
``conspiracy of silence and deceit.''
   ``Mr. Barry is asking you to shut your eyes, cover your ears, to
close your mind,'' Roberts said. ``Really, he's asking you to
insult your intelligence by forgetting the facts.''

<TEXT>
   A federal judge has started to examine
redistricting plans that could radically shift the power balance in
the nation's most populous county.
   U.S. District Judge David Kenyon began reviewing alternative
district maps Thursday after he tossed out a county plan as
illogical and insensitive to minorities.
   The judge examined plans submitted by the American Civil
Liberties Union, the Justice Department and the Mexican American
Legal Defense and Educational Fund _ all plaintiffs in the federal
lawsuit against Los Angeles County.
   Those plans seek to create a Hispanic majority district but
without an incumbent. They could overturn the conservative majority
and possibly lead to profound changes in financing in such areas as
health and social services programs.
   Civil rights lawyers today planned to discuss how the plans
would be implemented.
   The county Board of Supervisors was ordered to redraw the
districts after Kenyon found supervisors violated the federal
Voting Rights Act by conspiring in 1981 to draw district lines that
diluted Hispanic voting strength.
   But the remapping effort approved by the five-member board's
conservative majority was not in good faith, Kenyon ruled Wednesday.
   Though Hispanics make up about 35 percent of the county's 8.7
million residents, the five-member board has not had an elected
Hispanic member in 115 years.

   Iraq's capture of Kuwaiti oil fields is
awakening the United States to a shift in the balance of global oil
power and the prospect of higher prices, analysts say.
   U.S. dependence on oil from the volatile Persian Gulf has grown
rapidly in recent years as American production has fallen. That
leaves the United States increasingly vulnerable to supply
disruptions and gives the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries more influence over prices.
   In 1985 the United States relied on the gulf countries for about
10 percent of imports; this year the gulf share of the American
market is about 25 percent.
   One-half of all U.S. oil supplies are imported. While Britain
and other non-OPEC oil exporters had snatched part of the American
market from the Middle East producers in the early 1980s, some of
that non-OPEC supply is drying up.
   ``I don't think the average American has understood how rapidly
our dependence has increased,'' Sen. David Boren, D-Okla., chairman
of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Thursday. ``We've really
been asleep at the switch in terms of the national security
implications'' of relying heavily on Middle East oil exporters.
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, called today for new incentives for
domestic oil production, including tax breaks for those who squeeze
oil from formations now considered unrecoverable.
   ``This week's news makes our vulnerability more evident and our
response more urgent,'' said Bentsen, chairman of the tax-writing
Senate Finance Committee. ``By failing to learn from this history,
we are condemning ourselves to repeat it.''
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's quick strike into Kuwait
highlighted U.S. vulnerability to oil market pressures and to the
possibility that OPEC _ with Iraq in a leading role _ may regain
its price-fixing clout, analysts said.
   ``In a night's work, Hussein has irrevocably altered not only
the balance of power in the Middle East, but the supply and demand
balance in the world oil market,'' said Christopher Flavin, vice
president for research at the Worldwatch Institute in Washington.
   Iraq immediately doubled its share of world oil reserves by
taking control of Kuwait, which estimates its reserves at 94
billion barrels. Iraq now ranks second in the world to Saudi
Arabia, which has estimated reserves of 255 billion barrels. The
United States holds 26 billion barrels.
   Flavin said the Bush administration has little prospect for
stopping Iraq from further military conquests in the gulf, despite
the importance of oil to the U.S. economy.
   ``Ironically, any effort by the United States to directly
prevent Iraqi military action would itself provoke the kind of
conflict almost certain to disrupt oil supplies, and quite possibly
throw the world into a severe recession,'' Flavin said.
   With Iraq now playing the role of enforcer, OPEC may be in a
position to tighten world oil supplies over the coming decade,
possibly enabling the cartel to raise its prices and make them
stick, analysts said.
   Perhaps most troubling for the United States and other large
oil-consuming nations: oil market clout is becoming increasingly
concentrated in the gulf, where no nation has enough military might
or political leverage to challenge Iraqi ambitions.
   ``All of the OPEC countries, at least all of those in the Middle
East, will be intimidated by Iraq,'' said Sen. J. Bennett Johnston,
D-La., chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources
Committee. ``Iraq will be able to set such prices it wants.''
   Throughout the eight years of the Iran-Iraq war, which ended in
1988, both countries were neutralized on the oil scene, leaving
Saudi Arabia and Kuwait to dominate in OPEC and ensuring that the
West would again become hooked on the cartel's oil.
   After emerging victorious over Iran, Iraq began seeking to
convert its regional military predominance into added oil clout.
The invasion of Kuwait was the first dramatic proof to analysts
that Baghdad is intent on supplanting Saudi Arabia as the main
power in OPEC and leading a drive toward higher oil prices.

   A biplane went into a 400-foot nose dive
during an air show and crashed, killing the pilot, on the final day
of the Experimental Aircraft Association's annual convention.
   Witnesses said the Stearman biplane was making barrel rolls
Thursday afternoon when it crashed near a runway at Wittman
Regional Airport.
   The show was interrupted, then resumed about a half-hour later,
using other runways.
   ``It got quiet _ everyone stood up and it got very, very
quiet,'' said Marge Kaepplinger of Chicago.
   Witnesses said the pilot was about halfway through his 15-minute
show when the plane crashed. No other planes were involved.
   Winnebago County Coroner Michael Stelter identified the victim
today as John Lewkowitz of Walled Lake, Mich. He was pronounced
dead at Mercy Medical Center.
   Five people died in two crashes July 25 while en route to the
convention, which opened July 27.
   Three died when a plane from the state of Washington crashed in
Wyoming and two were killed when a plane from Alabama crashed into
Lake Winnebago less than 1{ miles from the convention site.

   More nations today joined the chorus of
condemnations of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, and Japan considered
joining the United States and other countries in imposing sanctions
on the Baghdad government.
   The invasion Thursday brought rival nations together in calls
for Iraq to immediately withdraw its forces from the oil-rich
Persian Gulf sheikdom.
   Japan, West Germany, Italy, Belgium and Luxembourg announced
they would move to freeze Kuwaiti assets to protect them from Iraq.
Officials in the Netherlands said they were likely to impose an
asset freeze as well.
   On Thursday, France froze Kuwaiti and Iraqi assets, while
Britain put a hold on Kuwaiti assets. The Soviet Union, Iraq's
largest arms supplier, suspended shipments, called for Iraq to
withdraw its troops, and said it would issue a joint statement with
the United States on the invasion.
   Italy also suspended arms shipments, and called a meeting of
European Community foreign ministry officials in Rome on Saturday
to discuss the invasion. Italy holds the 12-nation community's
rotating presidency.
   ``We will let Europe's weight be felt,'' said Italian Foreign
Minister Gianni De Michelis.
   The insurance company Lloyd's of London introduced war risk
premiums for shipping in the gulf for the first time since the
Iran-Iraq war ended in 1988.
   President Bush, who froze Iraqi and Kuwaiti assets, denounced
the invasion and said he had not ruled out any responses, including
military. A U.S. aircraft carrier was on its way to the Persian
Gulf to join other American warships, and France said it planned to
send another warship to the waterway.
   At least two Arab nations cautioned against outside intervention
in response to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's takeover. Most Arab
states appeared reluctant to speak against Iraq. Iran, a Persian
state, condemned the invasion and said it threatened regional
security.
   Jordan's King Hussein flew to Baghdad today to meet with Saddam,
a longtime friend. State newspapers in Jordan supported Iraq's
invasion.
   Today South Korea, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia and China urged
a peaceful solution to the conflict. Singapore, an island nation,
issued an especially strongly worded condemnation of the invasion,
saying it was ``a threat to the security of small states
everywhere.''
   South Korea _ which imports all its oil, nearly 12 percent of it
from Kuwait and Iraq _ was setting up an emergency task force to
deal with possible disruptions in the oil supply.
   President Corazon Aquino of the Philippines said her government,
too, would ``pursue all possible ways'' to deal with any supply
disruption. But the Philippine government's immediate concern was
the safety of the 40,000 to 50,000 Filipinos working in Kuwait.
   New Zealand Prime Minister Geoffrey Palmer today called the
invasion ``an outrage.'' He said his country would ``join in
fully'' if the U.N. Security Council calls for economic sanctions.
   Taizo Watanabe, a spokesman for Japan's Foreign Ministry, said
the government had asked banks and other financial institutions to
freeze Kuwaiti assets. Although the government does not have the
legal authority to order the freeze, the institutions were likely
to follow the instructions.
   Watanabe said Japan would consider taking further measures after
deliberations by the Security Council later today.
   Japan, which was taking 260,000 barrels a day from Iraq during
the first quarter of the year, or 6.2 percent of its oil needs, may
boycott Iraqi crude, Kyodo News Service reported. Japan also may
block loans to Baghdad, it said.
   Bush said Thursday Washington would freeze all Iraqi and Kuwaiti
assets and impose a trade embargo including a halt to imports of
Iraqi oil.
   The United States was importing an average of 600,000 barrels of
Iraqi oil a day in the first five months of this year.
   But the United States, which relies on Iraq and Kuwait for about
5 percent of its total oil needs, holds about 26 billion barrels of
oil reserves.
   Switzerland ordered its banks to increase vigilance over Kuwaiti
assets to prevent their seizure.
   France, Iraq's second-largest supplier, had already suspended
arms deliveries because Baghdad failed to pay about $4.5 billion in
debts, Foreign Minister Roland Dumas said.
   On Thursday, the United Nations demanded Iraq's immediate and
unconditional withdrawal. China, Iran, Australia and Algeria were
among nations echoing the call.
   Israel said it was ready to meet any military threat posed by
Iraq but would not act unless attacked.
   Other statements of condemnation were issued Thursday by the
12-nation European Community, by Austria, Singapore, Romania,
Poland, Czechoslovakia, Algeria, Venezuela, Mexico, Turkey, Norway,
Morocco and Niger.
   The Arab League Council met in emergency session in Cairo on
Thursday to consider a Kuwaiti demand to send a joint Arab force
``to defend Kuwait against the Iraqi invasion,'' Egypt's state-run
Middle East News Agency reported.
   But the council adjourned without condemning the overthrow, the
first by one Arab nation against another in modern history. Another
council meeting was scheduled today.
   Hamed el-Ghabid, secretary-general of the 45-national
Organization of Islamic Conference, issued a statement in Cairo
asking Iraq to withdraw.
   Libya said any foreign intervention would be considered ``an
aggressive act.'' Jordan's official news agency said King Hussein
was also concerned about avoiding foreign intervention.

   Tom Rath, a lawyer in Concord, N.H., and close
friend of Supreme Court nominee David Souter, is likely to be named
to the board of directors of the Legal Services Corp., a Legal
Services source said today.
   The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Rath would
succeed John Erlenborn on the 11-member board if nominated by
President Bush and confirmed by the Senate. The source said Legal
Services had been told the nomination would probably be announced
next week.
   In Concord, Rath said he had applied for the job but had not
been told whether he would be nominated. ``I haven't caused anyone
to gag yet, and from what I've heard, they are favorably
inclined,'' he said.
   Congressional Quarterly reported this week that Rath has already
been selected.
   Erlenborn resigned in June after the American Farm Bureau
Federation said he was working against the interests of his law
firm's agricultural clients.
   The board oversees funding of local legal aid programs that
handle civil lawsuits for the poor.
   Souter, whose Senate confirmation hearings begin in September,
was Rath's predecessor as state attorney general in New Hampshire.

   Florida agricultural officials today declared an
end to a 3{-month Medfly infestation with a slap at California for
taking so long to get rid of its pests.
   Helicopters sprayed up to 20 square miles of suburban Miami with
malathion in eight aerial treatments to kill Mediterranean fruit
flies, considered the most destructive farm pest because it can
attack 250 fruits and vegetables.
   California's year-old infestation has spread to more than 900
square miles with limited aerial pesticide spraying at a cost of
more than $38 million, said Florida Agriculture Commissioner Doyle
Conner.
   ``It is absolutely vital to move quickly and aggressively, which
is exactly what we did,'' he said.
   Florida's $1.6 million eradication effort began after a fly was
trapped near Miami International Airport on April 16. By May 21, 23
Medflies were found at 21 locations.
   ``The bottom line is that we've turned back a serious threat to
our food supply in an environmentally sound program involving a
limited geographic area,'' Conner said.
   Unlike California, where malathion spraying produced a public
outcry, the spraying in Virginia Gardens, Miami Springs and parts
of Hialeah went on with little fuss.

<HEAD>Lawmakers Skirmish Over Abortion Amendment to Defense Bill</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 9 grafs to UPDATE with debate over abortion at
military hospitals. Picks up 4th graf pvs, `In the...'</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Senators clashed today over a contentious
amendment to allow abortions in military hospitals, as one
Republican lawmaker charged the measure would facilitate ``a
procedure many Americans find repugnant.''
   Two members of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Sens. Tim
Wirth, D-Colo., and John Glenn, D-Ohio, tried to add the provision
to the $289 billion defense bill for the fiscal year that begins
Oct. 1.
   The Senate is rushing to finish the legislation before it breaks
for its August recess. On Thursday, lawmakers left intact President
Bush's budget request for the B-2 bomber but imposed restrictions
on the $4.6 billion.
   During debate on the Senate floor today, Wirth told of a Navy
petty officer and his wife, who while pregnant with her first child
learned that the fetus was severely deformed.
   Despite recommendations from U.S. and Japanese physicians that
they have an abortion, the woman was unable to obtain one at U.S.
facilities in Japan, where the Midway was stationed.
   Instead, they used all their savings, $2,400, to have an
abortion performed by a Japanese doctor.
   ``This is not a complex issue. It does not get into public
funding for abortion,'' Wirth said.
   The amendment would reverse a 2-year-old regulation that bans
abortions in military hospitals, except when the life of the mother
is endangered. Under the provision, abortions for military
personnel and their dependents would have to be paid for by the
individual.
   ``This unsettles a long-settled policy with regard to government
involvement in abortions,'' said Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., who
complained that the provision would make it easier for an
individual to have a ``procedure that many Americans find
repugnant.''
   On Thursday, the Senate met the challenge from Bush to save the
B-2 bomber as Republicans argued that Iraq's invasion of Kuwait is
a sobering reminder against wholesale cuts in military spending.
   In the House, meantime, Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., was
trying to force a pre-recess vote today on campaign spending
limits, but was meeting stiff opposition from colleagues who object
to having only 90 minutes of debate.
   The House also faced votes on final passage of a bill to
strengthen oil spill liability laws and on a major civil rights
bill.
   The Senate on Thursday endorsed Bush's B-2 budget request for
fiscal 1991, beginning Oct. 1, by a 53-45 margin. But it also
voted, 97-2, to restrict use of the $4.6 billion earmarked for the
radar-evading plane until critical tests have been met.
   Earlier this week, the House Armed Services Committee dealt a
serious blow to the embattled plane, as it approved a $283 billion
defense bill that would halt production of the bat-winged planes at
the 15 in development. The president wants a 75-plane fleet.
   Opponents of the aircraft argued that with the demise of the
Warsaw Pact as a military alliance and the budget deficit
increasing, spending billions on the strategic bomber was
questionable.
   Republican Sen. William Cohen of Maine proposed stalling the B-2
program at the 15 planes until the Air Force could certify that the
aircraft had met certain tests.
   ``Let's fund what we have on line right now but no more B-2s
until you prove them,'' Cohen argued.
   The senator cited the increasing cost of the plane, which could
skyrocket to more than $1 billion apiece, and the Justice
Department's recommendation that the government prohibit the
plane's manufacturer, Northrop Corp., from future defense contracts
amid charges of fraud and mismanagement.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Armed Services Committee,
conceded that the aircraft could cause sticker shock but argued
that the changes in the Soviet threat is no reason to abandon the
B-2.
   ``These changes do not mean the millennium has arrived,'' he
   Republicans used Iraq's invasion and control of Kuwait to drive
home their point that the end of the Cold War in Eastern Europe did
not justify deep cuts in the nation's defenses.
   ``We need a wake-up call. We need to be alerted that we're not
going to be able to control the events in the world,'' said Senate
Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas.
   Across the Capitol, House Speaker Foley said he wanted to bring
a pair of competing Democratic campaign finance proposals along
with a Republican substitute to the floor for quick votes today.
   But Rep. Anthony Beilenson, D-Calif., and others called the plan
for only 90 minutes of debate ``ridiculous'' and unfair.
   The Senate, by a largely party-line 59-40 vote Wednesday night,
approved a Democratic bill that would cap Senate candidates'
campaign spending at $2 million to $10 million, based on their
states' population.
   The House also moved toward a vote today on a major cvil rights
bill that Bush has threatened to veto because the administration
believes it could lead to hiring quotas.
   The bill advanced Thursday night with approval of a cap on
damages courts can award female victims of job discrimination.
   The oil spill legislation before the House increases federal
liability limits but still allows states to enact tougher laws. The
bill had languished for years but was given new life after the
March 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska, considered the worst
in U.S. history.

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parliament today elected Arpad Goencz,
a prominant writer and former political prisoner, as president in a
move that completed the country's break with its Communist past.
   Goencz had been sentenced to life in prison for his role in the
1956 anti-Communist uprising that was crushed by Soviet troops.
   ``All my life ... I have served and will serve the nation's
independence, free thought, free speech, free ideas and social
justice,'' Goencz told lawmakers after his election. ``I serve
Hungarian democracy.''
   Goencz, 68, had been appointed interim president May 2 by the
newly elected, democratic Parliament.
   Today's parliamentary vote came less than a week after the
failure of a referendum that would have mandated a popular vote for
the post of president.
   Goencz is the first president of the Republic of Hungary, which
was declared last year after the Communists agreed to relinquish
power and compete in multiparty elections.
   Of 310 deputies present and voting, 295 voted for Goencz, the
only candidate for the post, in a secret ballot. There are 386
deputies in the unicameral legislature.
   His election was expected after the failure of the referendum on
holding a popular vote. Participation by more than 50 percent of
the electorate was required for approval, but fewer than 14 percent
went to the polls.
   Goencz referred indirectly to the failed referendum, saying the
parties who supported him in Parliament represented the majority of
the Hungarian people.
   ``Thus I can consider myself someone chosen not only by
Parliament, but the whole of the people,'' he said in his
acceptance speech.
   The referendum was sponsored by the Socialist Party, heir to the
now disbanded Communist Party, which has only a small minority in
Parliament.
   A referendum victory would have meant a chance for the party to
regain some of its lost political prestige. Former Premier Miklos
Nemeth, who ran as an independent in the March parliamentary
elections, still enjoys considerable popularity, and observers said
he would have had a good chance of becoming president in a direct
election.
   In a similar referendum in November, Hungarians voted
overwhelmingly in favor of postponing the election of the president
until after the parliamentary elections. That meant the president
would be elected by Parliament. The parliamentary elections were
held March 25, and a runoff on April 8.
   Goencz, who headed the Hungarian Writers' Union before his
election as interim president in May, spent six years in jail after
Soviet troops crushed the 1956 revolt against Stalinism and rule
from Moscow. He won a reprieve on his life sentence under a 1963
amnesty.
   He worked translating Britsh and American novels into Hungarian,
and eventually published several novels and short stories.
   Goencz is the third intellectual and former dissident to assume
an Eastern European presidency.
   Czechoslovak President Vaclav Havel, a prominent playwright, was
jailed and harassed for years before his election. In Bulgaria on
Wednesday, Zhelyu Zhelev, a respected leader of the opposition and
a man of letters, was elected the country's first non-Communist
president.
   Goencz was one of the founding members of the reformist League
of Free Democrats. With 94 seats in Parliament, the Free Democrats
are the second largest party in Parliament after the Hungarian
Democratic Forum, the senior party in the coalition government.
   In a brief acceptance speech after his election, Goencz
suggested his varied past would enable him as president to
understand a broad strata of Hungarian society.
   ``I have been lucky to live as a worker, as a peasant and as a
free intellectual. Thus I am not suitable to serve class
interests,'' he said.

   Speaker Thomas S. Foley wants to force a
pre-vacation vote on limiting House members' campaign spending but
is meeting stiff opposition from his fellow Democrats as well as
Republicans.
   Rep. Anthony Beilenson, D-Calif., called ``ridiculous'' and
unfair his party leader's plan to allow only 90 minutes of debate
and then a vote today before the House begins a month-long recess.
   Foley, D-Wash., said Thursday he wanted to bring a pair of
competing Democratic campaign finance proposals along with a
Republican substitute to the floor for quick votes today.
   The Senate, by a largely party-line, 59-40 vote Wednesday night,
approved a Democratic bill that would cap Senate candidates'
campaign spending at $2 million to $10 million, based on their
states' population.
   The Senate bill also would end the practice by which senators
can annually pocket $27,000 in speaking fees from special interest
groups, prohibit incumbents from mailing newsletters to voters at
government expense in election years and ban corporate, labor and
trade association political action committees.
   House Democratic leaders want to cap spending on House races at
$550,000 but have been reluctant to curb PACs, which provided 52
percent of the money raised by Democratic incumbents in their last
campaigns in 1988.
   One Democratic proposal would limit PAC donations to $275,000 or
50 percent of the spending ceiling. The other would cut them to 40
percent, or $220,000.
   Although any changes in the law would not take effect until
after this year's election, several Democrats don't like what they
portend. At a party caucus earlier this week, some cited how they
had already spent $300,000 in fending off opponents in primaries
and, under the proposed ceilings, would have only $250,000 left to
run their general election campaigns in the fall.
   ``I don't know of a single person in the House who is not for
campaign finance reform,'' said Rep. Al Swift, D-Wash., author of
one of his party's two proposals. ``And I also know there are 435
plans to achieve that end.''
   Citizen action groups such as Common Cause and Public Citizen,
while generally praising the Senate's bill, have vehemently
criticized House Democrats' reluctance to give up PACs.
   Because of that opposition, Democratic leaders just want to get
the vote over with, said House GOP Whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia.
   ``They know all the reform groups are going to be enraged at
them,'' he said. ``So they want to take their beating and go home.''

<HEAD>Student Leader of 53-Day Protest Freed From Detention</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTINA PIRVULESCU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A student who led a 53-day
anti-government rally has been freed after six weeks' detention and
today denied charges that he incited protesters to violence.
   Marian Munteanu, whose beating and detention drew domestic and
international protest, was released Thursday night. In an interview
in his apartment today, he called his time in jail ``a nightmare''
and pledged to continue working with the student movement.
   ``These six weeks of detention have aged me many years. I am
physically weak. I feel 80 years old,'' he said.
   Munteanu, 28, the president of the Bucharest student union, was
a leader of an anti-government rally that police violently
dispersed June 13 after 53 days.
   The authorities' decision to use force against the peaceful
protesters led to angry riots. More violence broke out when miners
loyal to President Ion Iliescu came to the capital to help restore
order. Six people were killed and scores injured in three days of
unrest in the capital.
   Munteanu was hospitalized after being badly beaten by miners and
then arrested days later.
   His release came shortly after the prosecutor-general issued a
statement saying the circumstances that led to Munteanu's
``preventive detention'' had changed and his release would no
longer represent a threat to public order.
   Demonstrations demanding Munteanu's release were held in
Bucharest and in the central town of Sibiu earlier this week.
   Last month, prosecutors said Munteanu and some 80 others would
be tried for ``inciting violence.'' But Munteanu said he had not
been informed that the decision to try him was final.
   He maintained that on June 13, the day demonstrators attacked
police headquarters with firebombs, he ``asked the people not to go
(to police headquarters), but unfortunately they allowed themselves
to be maneuvered... I don't know by whom.''
   He said he hoped the parliamentary commission appointed to
investigate the events would ``uncover the truth.''
   Munteanu said he did not contest the right of Iliescu _ who won
a massive victory in the May 20 elections _ to rule Romania.
   One of the demands of the protesters was the exclusion of all
former Communists from power. Iliescu was a Communist functionary
for a time under Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu. He
eventually fell into disfavor with Ceausescu, who was driven from
power and executed in the December revolution.
   Iliescu has repeatedly stated his rejection of Communist ideals
and his commitment to democracy.
   ``But the government's not doing enough to remove the residue of
Communism in Romania or to reveal the truth about what has been
happening since the revolution,'' Munteanu said.
   He said he would continue to be associated with the student
movement ``to ensure they (students and intellectuals) are
understood and tolerated.''
   Munteanu said he still suffers headaches from his clubbing that
doctors said could last two to three years.

<TEXT>
   Just when surfers and swimmers thought it
may have been as safe as usual to go in the water this weekend, a
judge rejected an attempt to stop a shark-fishing tournament.
   A group known as Safe Harbors and Recreational Choices filed a
lawsuit Wednesday to stop the Columbia River-Pacific Ocean Shark
Tournament, scheduled for today and Saturday off the northern
Oregon coast.
   Clatsop County Circuit Judge Pat Dooley refused to issue a
temporary restraining order Thursday because the suit was filed so
close to the start of the tournament.
   ``It would be a complete misuse of my discretion to issue an
order on this short notice,'' Dooley said.
   Competitors plan to chum, or toss ground fish and blood into the
water, to attract sharks. Tournament opponents said the event could
draw sharks close to shore, increasing the danger that swimmers or
surfers might be attacked.
   ``It would increase the risk potential, however small it may
be,'' said California biologist Mark Marks, a graduate student at
Humboldt State University who specializes in shark studies.
``Undoubtedly, this kind of behavior is not conducive to safe
swimming.''
   Ron Miller, a charter boat owner and vice president of the
tournament, said in a telephone interview after the hearing that
the entire episode had been blown out of proportion.
   ``The whole thing has gotten the media into a feeding frenzy,''
he said. ``It's just a handful of guys going out fishing.''
   Organizers said when they announced the tournament that they
hoped for 200 boats. They said prizes would run to $80,000 with a
$35,000 top prize.
   But Miller said Thursday that only about a dozen boats were
expected.
   Prizes will be much lower, based on a percentage of the $600 per
boat entry fee. He said individuals were being allowed to enter for
$10 each and could make their own arrangements to go out on a boat.
   Most of the boats planned to go 60 to 100 miles offshore and
some will combine an albacore tuna fishing trip with the shark
hunt, Miller said.

<HEAD>Khmer Rouge Agree to Talks on Supreme National Council</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cambodia's Khmer Rouge guerrillas
agreed today to discuss speedy formation of a council that would
help govern Cambodia until elections could be held in the
Vietnam-controlled country.
   The Cambodian factions agreed to form the council during talks
two months ago in Tokyo, but the Khmer Rouge complained it was not
being treated as an equal and boycotted the agreement.
   Khmer Rouge leader Khieu Samphan agreed to new discussions in a
broadcast over his group's radio, monitored in Bangkok.
   However, Premier Hun Sen of the Vietnamese-installed government
has said the formation of the council already has been decided and
has refused resistance calls for new talks on it.
   Khieu Samphan said the group will follow the urging of Southeast
Asian foreign ministers and participate ``in the meeting of all
Cambodian parties ... to discuss the composition of the Supreme
National Council in a reconciliation spirit to most speedily set up
this council.''
   In a July 23 joint statement, the ministers of the Association
of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN, called for the urgent
formation of the council.
   They noted that some proposals have called for the council to
work with the United Nations in governing Cambodia in the period
before elections.
   The council would comprise representatives of the three-party
guerrilla coalition and the government Vietnam installed in
Cambodia after a late 1978 invasion.
   After the Tokyo talks, representatives were named by the
Vietnamese-installed government and the Khmer Rouge's two guerrilla
allies _ the forces of Prince Norodom Sihanouk and of Son Sann's
Khmer People's National Liberation Front. But the Khmer Rouge
refused to name any representatives.
   In today's broadcast, Khieu Samphan called the council ``the
only legitimate organ of Cambodia and the sole authority in the
transition period.'' He said it would cooperate with the United
Nations in the interim administration.
   However, the government wants interim authority and a largely
symbolic council.
   Khieu Samphan said his group agreed that ``no one Cambodian
party would be allowed to seize or maintain power through the force
of arms, no one Cambodian party could dominate other Cambodian
parties, and that no party is to be discarded.''
   He apparently was reacting to the international isolation of the
Khmer Rouge, and to fears by various Western countries that it
would try to retake power militarily. The Khmer Rouge killed
hundreds of thousands of people in fanatical communist policies in
Cambodia before Vietnam's invasion ended its nearly four-year reign.
   The group's isolation grew after the United States announced
last month it was withdrawing recognition of the guerrilla
coalition's U.N. seat.

   Nearly two weeks after his great escape,
Aardu the wallaby was back home at the Stone Zoo today.
   Zoo keepers found Aardu Thursday night, according to Kim
O'Keefe, a secretary at the zoo.
   ``He's fine,'' said O'Keefe. ``He should be back in his cage
today.''
   It was not immediately clear where or how Aardu had been found.
   Aardu, a male Australian wallaby, leaped to freedom from the
Stone Zoo in suburban Boston on July 23. A wallaby is a cousin of
the kangaroo.
   Within hours of his escape, Aardu escaped to the nearby
Middlesex Fells Reservation, 3,000 wooded acres. Zoo officials said
Aardu, a hardy vegetarian, could have survived for months.
   There had been a number of sightings of the 35-pound marsupial
by zoo personnel, police and citizens looking to help. But Aardu,
reaching speeds up to 30 mph, had been able to elude his would-be
captors.
   Aardu shared his home at the zoo with three female wallabies,
and zoo officials hope he will eventually father wallaby offspring.

   Fish might be contaminated, shipping has
been halted and a 12-mile slick remains on Galveston Bay from a
500,000-gallon oil spill, but Gov. Bill Clements says things aren't
so bad.
   ``We're fortunate,'' Clements, a former oil man, said after
viewing the spill Thursday. ``It's not near as serious a problem as
was first anticipated.''
   Clements declaration that spill's effects were ``greatly
exaggerated'' angered fishermen and local officials less willing to
downplay potential economic and environmental damage.
   The spill occurred Saturday when the Greek tanker Shinoussa
collided with two barges in the Houston Shipping Channel. One of
the barges nearly sank.
   Last night, salvage crews moved the barge a short distance to
put it out of the channel and onto a ledge in shallower waters in
the bay, Coast Guard Chief Warrant Officer Rick Meidt said today.
   ``It was not very far. They just had to get it to a slightly
more stable location,'' he said.
   The ship channel was reopened this morning to allow one
deep-draft ship out of the area to determine if its wake would
cause further damage to the barge, he said.
   But the ship passed without incident and the Coast Guard planned
to allow another vessel to pass later.
   ``We're taking it slow and easy,'' Meidt said.
   The spill occurred in one of the barge's three cargo tanks.
Since then, salvage crews have pumped out a tank that had 20,000
gallons of oil. About 200,000 gallons is believed to still be in
another tank. A third tank is believed to be empty. Workers planned
to inspect both tanks today.
   Meidt also reported that additional oil has washed ashore at
Houston Point, a marshland north of the slick.
   A hearing into the cause of the crash resumed today in Houston.
The bay pilot assigned to the Greek freighter was scheduled to
testify.
   Coast Guard officials were worried about a crack in the barge
that occurred during the accident.
   ``We're still concerned about the structural integrity of the
barge,'' Coast Guard Petty Officer Mark Sedwick said. ``It could
break apart.''
   Ship owners were losing at least $1.5 million per day while the
channel was closed, officials said earlier in the week. The Coast
Guard took over cleanup efforts Thursday because Apex Towing Co.,
owner of the two barges damaged in the collision, was nearing its
insurance liability limit.
   Cleanup crews used skimmers and vacuum trucks to suck up oil off
the water's surface and workers also dumped oil-eating microbes on
an oil-soiled marsh.
   The state Health Department imposed a fishing ban Thursday
because of fears that fish, shrimp and other marine life could be
contaminated by the spill. It idled multimillion-dollar commercial
and sport industries as worried shrimpers await the Aug. 15 opening
of the fall season.
   Clements said the ban could be lifted soon. Critics were
skeptical.
   ``I hope he's right, but realistically, I think he's full of
baloney,'' said C.L. Standley, past president of Professional
Involvement of Seafood Concerned Enterprises.
   ``I think it could possibly be weeks, and if it is, that's going
to be devastating,'' he said.
   The spill, once 17 miles long, thinned to about 12 miles by
afternoon. Clements said he had trouble finding any oil during a
flyover by helicopter, saying that much of the oil evaporated
before reaching sensitive marshlands.
   At least one official disputed Clements' contention.
   ``Obviously, much of the oil has sunk to the bottom of the bay,
endangering all the marine and bird life and devastating a
productive commercial and recreational fishery,'' said Texas
General Land Commissioner Garry Mauro.
   Coast Guard officials, however, said samples taken from the bay
bottom by the Army Corps of Engineers had not yet revealed signs of
oil, except in one small sample.
   Wayne Johnson, a Galveston County commissioner, also criticized
Clements.
   ``I'm outraged. He came out here and declared victory and went
back to Austin,'' Johnson said.
   ``I don't like this idea of declaring victory and calling off
the troops, said state Sen. Chet Brooks. ``This war is far from
over.''
   In 1947, Clements founded SEDCO Inc., an oil supply firm that
specialized in offshore drilling. It made the Gulf of Mexico oil
rig that exploded in 1979 and spilled about 100 million gallons of
oil. The company settled lawsuits by fishermen and businesses
seeking $350 million for $2.1 million.

<HEAD>CNN Cancels Viewer Choice Segment Due to Breaking Kuwait Story</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cable News Network, which began experimenting
with a viewer choice segment on its ``Newsnight'' program just last
week, said today it will cancel the segment when necessary because
of breaking news.
   The interactive news format, which allows viewers to choose two
secondary or feature stories using a special 900 telephone line,
was suspended for the first time Thursday night because of the
breaking story on Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   ``The interactive segment is still very much alive. However, we
will cancel it on nights where there is a big breaking story,''
said CNN spokesman Steve Haworth.
   CNN said it received some calls from viewers Wednesday night
complaining that the network didn't show enough on the Iraqi
invasion while it did use the viewer choice segment on
``Newsnight,'' which airs for an hour beginning at midnight Eastern
time.
   ``We had the Kuwait story at 10:18 p.m. when it broke, and on
our midnight show had it at 12:25 p.m.,'' said Haworth.
   The interactive news experiment began July 23. Viewers see a
summary of six feature stories at the beginning of the show and are
invited to dial a 900 number to vote on which of the stories they
would like to see. The two with the most votes are shown during the
program.
   ``We were wall-to-wall with Iraqi stories Thursday night, which
was the first time the viewers choice segment was not shown. No
decision has been made yet on tonight's show. It will depend on the
breaking news,'' Haworth said.

<HEAD>Arts Council Votes Against Anti-Obscenity Pledge</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The advisory council to the National Endowment
for the Arts broke with its chairman today, voting overwhelmingly
to drop an anti-obscenity pledge for artists that it likened to
McCarthy era loyalty oaths.
   The council vote is not binding on the endowment. NEA Chairman
John E. Frohnmayer said, ``I'm going to consider it and take my
action in due course.''
   The 19 members of the National Council on the 
one member said that requiring artists who get grants to pledge
that their works will not be obscene amounts to ``a loyalty oath
reminiscentArts voted after of the McCarthy era.''
   Only two dissenting votes were recorded.
   Frohnmayer, responding to a controversy over federal grants that
go towards controversial art, had inserted congressional language
barring obscenity into the conditions that grant recipients must
promise to obey before they can receive federal funds.
   Congress imposed the obscenity ban on the endowment last October
after conservative lawmakers led by Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C.,
complained that an exhibition of sexually explicit works by
photographer Robert Mapplethorpe contained obscenity and should not
be financed by taxpayers' money.
   he ban prohibits use of NEA grant money for works that the
endowment chairman deems obscene, including dease of 15 failed Texas
thrifts.

<HEAD>Investigation of Ritter Found Sexual Misconduct</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 12 grafs to UPDATE with Covenant House statement,

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investigators have concluded that the Rev. Bruce
Ritter engaged in sexual misconduct with young men at the shelter
for young runaways that he founded, Covenant House announced today.
   The four-month inquiry, ordered by the Covenant House board of
directors, discovered ``cumulative evidence ... supporting the
allegations of sexual misconduct on the part of Father Ritter,''
Covenant House said.
   If Ritter had not resigned as Covenant House president in
February, the statement added, ``the termination of his
relationship would have been required.''
   The four-month investigation was conducted by Robert J. McGuire,
a former city police commissioner. Covenant House officials said
his full report would be issued later in the day.
   The findings first were reported by The New York Times today.
Some Covenant House residents told investigators they spurned
sexual overtures the priest made toward them, while others
described sexual activities they engaged in with Ritter, the Times
said, quoting people who had read the report.
   Ritter, 63, who founded the shelter that annually serves 28,000
youths, has vehemently denied the allegations of sexual
impropriety. He is believed to be living in New Jersey and is
considering leaving the Franciscan order.
   A statement today from Ritter's lawyer, Stanley Arkin, said the
report ``gives emphasis to an alleged few sporadic incidents,
washing away more than 20 years of uncompromising and unstinting
accomplishment.''
   Noting that Ritter has resigned from Covenant House, Arkin
added: ``revisiting these allegations now is wholly unnecessary,
either for Covenant House or for the public.''
   The investigation found no evidence Ritter misappropriated funds
at Covenant House, which runs shelters in 15 U.S. cities, Canada
and Central America.
   The Manhattan district attorney found ``some questionable
financial transactions,'' but no charges were brought against
Ritter. The state attorney general's office is still investigating
the organization's finances.
   But the Covenant House statement said the board should have been
made aware of loans by Ritter to two senior staff members, of
contracts between Covenant House and Ritter's niece and of a secret
personal fund where Ritter deposited most of his $98,000 salary.
   The fund, called the Franciscan Charitable Trust, had
accumulated nearly $1 million. Plans now call for it to be
liquidated with the assets going to Covenant House, as Ritter says
he intended all along.
   In December, a 26-year-old drifter from Texas, Kevin Lee Kite,
accused Ritter of luring him into a sexual relationship. That
public accusation was followed by similar allegations by two
others, including Darryl Bassile, 31, who McGuire concluded was the
most credible of Ritter's accusers.
   More than half of the organization's 17 board members have
resigned since the allegations surfaced. Donations have fallen, the
$86 million budget was cut back $14 million and a fourth of the
420-person staff was laid off.
   Sister Mary Rose McGeady, a social services worker and associate
director of Catholic Charities in the Roman Catholic Diocese of
Brooklyn, was named to replace Ritter on Sept. 1.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It's not the heat but a faulty bearing that has
stopped the clock of Big Ben three times this week, the government
said Friday.
   The hands of the famous clock on the tower of the Houses of
Parliament stopped at 5:11 a.m. Friday, which is about where they
snagged on Wednesday and Thursday nights.
   ``We believe, as a result of investigations carried out this
morning, that the problem is to do with a bearing in the eastern
face of the clock, and that once that bearing has been replaced or
lubricated, that the problem will go away,'' said Toby Sargent,
spokesman for the Department of Environment.
   Big Ben is the name of the bell that tolls the hours, but the
name is informally applied to the clock as well.
   Sargent said it apparently was just a coincidence that the clock
broke down during the hottest days of the London summer. On
Thursday, the temperature reached 97 degrees.

   A strong earthquake jolted parts of
the main Indonesian island of Java but no damage or casualties were
reported, the Meteorology and Geophysics Agency said Friday.
   The quake, measuring 6 on the Richter scale, struck Thursday
night in West Java, the agency said. The epicenter was placed at
about 120 miles west of Jakarta, the capital, and was 19 miles
below the surface in the Malacca Straits.
   Tremors were felt in Jakarta.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude. An earthquake measuring 6 on the Richter scale can
cause severe damage in populated areas.

   A third U.S. aircraft carrier was being
readied today to head toward the troubled Mideast to bolster U.S.
forces already scattered outside the Persian Gulf region, the
Pentagon said.
   The move comes a day after Iraq invaded Kuwait. However,
Pentagon officials said the USS Saratoga had been scheduled to
relieve the USS Eisenhower, which was deployed in the Mideast in
March.
   The aircraft carrier Independence already is headed from the
Indian Ocean toward the Persian Gulf to strengthen the eight-ship
U.S. Navy presence already there.
   The Saratoga, based in Mayport, Fla., earlier had been scheduled
to relieve the USS Eisenhower and will leave Tuesday. In addition,
a Marine amphibious readiness group aboard the assault ship USS
Inchon was scheduled to sail to the region Monday, for a total
deployment of 15,000 sailors and Marines.
   ``This has been planned for months,'' said Defense Department
spokesman Pete Williams.
   He declined to tie Saratoga's movement to the Mideast crisis,
but said it was possible that the Saratoga and Eisenhower might
overlap for a time and remain in the Mediterranean.
   In Brussels today, a source said the United States told its NATO
allies that it has prepared contingency plans in case Iraqi troops
push beyond Kuwait.
   The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said American
officials did not explain what actions were under consideration.
   President Bush has said no options _ military or otherwise _
have been ruled in or out. But if the 3,000 Americans in Kuwait
came into harm's way, the president said it would affect the United
States ``in a very dramatic way.''
   ``If they are threatened or harmed ... I have certain
responsibilities,'' Bush said after conferring Thursday with
British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher in Aspen, Colo.
   The State Department said today that invading Iraqi troops
rounded up at least eight American oil field workers near the
border of Kuwait.
   Adm. William J. Crowe Jr., the former chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, told NBC today that the United States could
``dominate the gulf from a naval standpoint.''
   ``We can keep the Iraqis off the water, we can dominate them in
the air,'' he said, but added that putting U.S. troops on the
ground ``would be a major problem.''
   Top Pentagon military officers and intelligence analysts
insisted they were not caught off guard by Iraq's sudden sweep into
its southern Arab neighbor, but the Independence was thousands of
miles away from the tense region.
   Military sources said the Independence was ``several days'' from
reaching a staging area outside gulf waters. But it will serve as a
potent symbol of U.S. military strength with its squadrons of FA-18
jet fighters, F-4 attack aircraft and A-6E bombers.
   Meanwhile, members of Congress and others worried that Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein could aim next at an invasion of Saudi
Arabia. The 120,000 Iraqi troops massed along Iraq's southern
border for the invasion of Kuwait could easily be sent there next,
said lawmakers who attended classified briefings late Thursday.
   U.S. forces in the gulf had come to Kuwait's aid during the
eight-year Iran-Iraq war when it reflagged the oil-rich nation's
tankers in 1988 and protected them from attack from Iran.
   But it would be difficult for the United States to parry Iraq's
drive with a major assault of troops, Pentagon military sources say.
   Even though Marine and Army forces stand ready for use in
Western Europe and at bases in the Indian Ocean and the Pacific, it
would take massive numbers of flights, access to air bases and
numerous ships to supply such an endeavor.
   ``Our forces are very far away. It would take weeks for them to
get there,'' one high-ranking military officer said.
   A massive landing force would be needed to counter Iraq's
war-tested soldiers and their thousands of tanks and sophisticated
weaponry.
   ``Iraq is a Third World nation with First World weapons,'' one
senior intelligence analyst said. ``They are the Prussians of the
Middle East. They have mechanized armament you wouldn't believe _
they kicked the stuffing out of the Iranians with it.''
   Flying U.S. ground combat forces into the Persian Gulf from
European bases would be extremely difficult in view of Libyan air
defenses and problems posed by getting permission to fly over Egypt
and other nations in the region, another source said.
   Inside the gulf, the U.S. military presence is represented by
eight warships of the Joint Task Force Middle East, led by the
command ship USS LaSalle. Those vessels include a cruiser,
destroyer and frigates that lack the punch of the carrier group's
attack and bomber aircraft.
   U.S. carriers stay out of the Persian Gulf, not only because of
their size but to increase their security against attack.

<HEAD>Man Receives $475,000 for Racial Attack</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A black man attacked by a white man yelling
racial slurs has been awarded $475,000 in damages under a rarely
used state law that forbids racial intimidation.
   A Cook County Circuit Court jury on Thursday made the award to
Mack Green, 55, one of the first beneficiaries of the Illinois
Ethnic Intimidation Act, according to his lawyers.
   The law, adopted in 1982 but rarely used, allows victims of
racial, religious or ethnic hostility to file civil lawsuits
against their assailants, independent of criminal prosecution.
   During a one-day trial, Green testified that he was attacked by
Stephen Windy, 30, on Jan. 22, 1988, after his tow truck broke down
in a predominantly white neighborhood on Chicago's South Side.
   According to the lawsuit, Windy tried to set the truck on fire,
grabbed a piece of lumber from the back of the truck, shattered
windows and tossed a gas can at Green.
   Windy pleaded guilty to criminal charges of attempted arson,
damage to property and ethnic intimidation in 1988.
   He was given a year's probation, ordered to pay for truck
repairs, and required to perform 60 hours of community service.
   Windy, representing himself in the civil trial, argued he had
been punished already by the criminal case and that Green was not
physically injured during the attack.
   He could not immediately be reached for comment after the
verdict.
   Green's attorney, Frederick Sperling, said the civil suit
``sends a clear message that anyone engaging in racial or religious
violence will have a steep price to pay.''

<HEAD>Senate Sidesteps Abortion Issue in Rush to Finish Defense Bill</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: ADDS 6 grafs to include passage of aviation bills.</NOTE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate, rushing to adjourn for the summer,
today sidestepped a potentially volatile fight over abortion as it
laid aside a measure that would have allowed abortions in military
hospitals.
   Sen. Tim Wirth, D-Colo., chief sponsor of the provision,
withdrew his amendment after the Senate fell two votes short of
curtailing debate, clearing the way for the Senate to move ahead on
a $289 billion defense bill for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1.
   ``This is not a complex issue. It does not get into public
funding for abortion,'' Wirth said.
   The amendment would have reversed a 2-year-old regulation that
bans abortions in military hospitals, except when the life of the
mother is endangered. Under the provision, abortions for military
personnel and their dependents would have to be paid by the
individual.
   ``This unsettles a long-settled policy with regard to government
involvement in abortions,'' said Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., who
complained that the provision would make it easier for an
individual to have a ``procedure that many Americans find
repugnant.''
   Senate GOP Leader Bob Dole of Kansas said that if the measure
was included in the defense bill, President Bush would veto the
legislation.
   On Thursday, the Senate met the challenge from Bush to save the
B-2 bomber as Republicans argued that Iraq's invasion of Kuwait is
a sobering reminder against wholesale cuts in military spending.
   In the House, meantime, Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., was
trying to force a pre-recess vote today on campaign spending
limits, but was meeting stiff opposition from colleagues who object
to having only 90 minutes of debate.
   The House also faced votes on final passage of a bill to
strengthen oil spill liability laws and on a major civil rights
bill.
   The Senate on Thursday endorsed Bush's B-2 budget request for
fiscal 1991 Oct. 1, by a 53-45 margin. But it also voted, 97-2, to
restrict use of the $4.6 billion earmarked for the radar-evading
plane until critical tests have been met.
   Earlier this week, the House Armed Services Committee dealt a
serious blow o the embattled plane, as it approved a $283 billion
defense bill that would halt production of the bat-winged planes at
the 15 in development. The president wants a 75-plane fleet.
   Opponents of the aircraft argued that with the demise of the
Warsaw Pact as a military alliance and the budget deficit
increasing, spending billions on the strategic bomber was
questionable.
   Republican Sen. William Cohen of Maine proposed stalling the B-2
program at the 15 planes until the Air Force could certify that the
aircraft had met certain tests.
   ``Let's fund what we have on line right now but no more B-2s
until you prove them,'' Cohen argued.
   The senator cited the increasing cost of the plane, which could
skyrocket to more than $1 billion apiece, and the Justice
Department's recommendation that the government prohibit the
plane's manufacturer, Northrop Corp., from future defense contracts
amid charges of fraud and mismanagement.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Armed Services Committee,
conceded that the aircraft could cause sticker shock but argued
that the changes in the Soviet threat is no reason to abandon the
B-2.
   ``These changes do not mean the millennium has arrived,'' he
   Republicans used Iraq's invasion and control of Kuwait to drive
home their point that the end of the Cold War in Eastern Europe did
not justify deep cuts in the nation's defenses.
   ``We need a wake-up call. We need to be alerted that we're not
going to be able to control the events in the world,'' said Senate
Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas.
   Across the Capitol, House Speaker Foley said he wanted to bring
a pair of competing Democratic campaign finance proposals along
with a Republican substitute to the floor for quick votes today.
   But Rep. Anthony Beilenson, D-Calif., and others called the plan
for only 90 minutes of debate ``ridiculous'' and unfair.
   The Senate, by a largely party-line 59-40 vote Wednesday night,
approved a Democratic bill that would cap Senate candidates'
campaign spending at $2 million to $10 million, based on their
states' population.
   The House also moved toward a vote today on a major civil rights
bill that Bush has threatened to veto because the administration
believes it could lead to hiring quotas.
   The bill advanced Thursday night with approval of a cap on
damages courts can award female victims of job discrimination.
   The oil spill legislation before the House increases federal
liability limits but still allows states to enact tougher laws. The
bill had languished for years but was given new life after the
March 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska, considered the worst
in U.S. history.
   Legislation to require infants and toddlers to use child safety
seats on airline flights cleared the Senate on a voice vote late
Thursday. The bill goes to the House.
   The measure, sponsored by Sen. Christopher Bond, R-Mo., would
direct the Federal Aviation Administration to require the seats on
domestic airline flights. It would be left to the FAA to determine
a height and weight limit for children needing the seats.
   Currently, infants under 2 can fly free by traveling on the laps
of a parent or guardian.
   The airline industry and consumer safety groups support
mandatory child restraints.
   On another aviation issue, the House approved a bill that would
tax airline travelers with a passenger facilities charge at each
airport where they embark. The fees would raise $1 billion a year
for airport improvement.
   The measure, which now goes to the Senate, was part of a $18.5
billion bill, two-year funding of FAA operations and airport
development.

<TEXT>
   Egypt and a council representing Saudi
Arabia and five other smaller Arab nations today condemned Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait and called on Baghdad to immediately withdraw
its troops.
   In its denunciation, Egypt warned that the invasion could have
dangerous consequences throughout the Middle East.
   The statement by the Gulf Cooperation Council _ which includes
Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Oman and
Kuwait _ contained the first condemnation by Saudi Arabia, which
borders Kuwait.
   Egypt, in a statement issued by its Foreign Ministry, spoke of
its surprise at Iraq's lightning invasion of its small Persian Gulf
neighbor.
   Thursday's invasion came only days after Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak stepped in to try to mediate the Iraq-Kuwait dispute.
Iraq allowed him to believe his efforts were succeeding.
   The Egyptian condemnation came as an emergency Arab League
Council was preparing to reconvene in Cairo to discuss the crisis.
The council, at Kuwait's request, met Thursday for six hours but
issued no statement and adjourned its meeting for 24 hours.
   On the day of the invasion, the Arab world was conspicuously
silent except to warn against foreign intervention in Kuwait.
   Egyptian government sources, speaking on condition of anonymity,
have said Mubarak and other Arab leaders were initially reluctant
to condemn Iraq because they hoped the situation could be resolved
without the use of more force.
   But their silence made it appear to the rest of the world that
they feared the wrath of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein if they
speak against him.
   Meanwhile, King Hussein of Jordan held talks today in Baghdad
with Saddam and said upon his return that an Arab summit would be
held in Saudi Arabia on Sunday to discuss the invasion. Speaking on
state-run radio and television, he did not say which leaders would
attend.
   Later, Egypt's Middle East News Agency quoted the Kuwaiti
minister for cabinet affairs, Abdel-Rahman el-Awadi, as releasing a
list of leaders who would attend. Saddam's name was not among them.
   Jordan has not taken a stand on the invasion, but state
newspapers supported Iraq and said the United States should not
intervene militarily ``in our Arab region.''
   The Egyptian sources said neither Mubarak nor King Fahd of Saudi
Arabia, who are leading a diplomatic campaign to try to end the
crisis, believed Iraq's claim that it invaded at the request of
Kuwaiti revolutionaries who had already overthrown the government.
   Other nations strongly condemned the invasion. The United States
and the Soviet Union imposed sanctions on Iraq, and the United
Nations demanded Iraq's immediate and unconditional withdrawal from
Kuwait, a call heard from many nations including China, Iran,
Australia and Algeria.
   Some Palestinian leaders in the Israeli-occupied lands expressed
support today for the invasion, but others expressed fears it would
divert attention from the Palestinian struggle against Israel.
   Libya warned that any foreign intervention would be considered
``an aggressive act.''
   King Hussein on Thursday met Mubarak for five hours in the
Mediterranean port of Alexandria in Egypt. The two conferred by
phone with King Fahd, Saddam and other Arab leaders, and with
President Bush. No details of the discussion were divulged and no
statement was issued afterward.
   In Saudi Arabia, a statement by the official Saudi Press Agency
said Fahd was following the situation with extreme concern and that
he was in intensive contacts ``seeking to calm the situation and
restore matters to normalcy.''
   Only Salim Hoss, prime minister of war-torn and ineffectual
Lebanon, has condemned the invasion.
   The Iraqi-Kuwaiti conflict erupted July 17 when Saddam accused
his small gulf neighbor of pumping $14 billion worth of oil from
Iraqi territories. He also accused Kuwait and the United Arab
Emirates of overproduction, which had created a glut in the world
oil market, and threatened to take military action.
   Mubarak, who has just recently cemented Egypt's return to the
Arab fold, immediately flew to Iraq, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. On
July 25, he proudly announced that his mediation efforts had
succeeded and that the two parties would meet in Saudi Arabia to
discuss their conflict.
   A meeting did take place on Tuesday, but the talks collapsed.
Less than 48 hours later, thousands of Iraqi troops crossed the
border and overran Kuwait.
   Egypt's role as political leader in the Arab world was frozen
following the late President Anwar Sadat's 1977 trip to Jerusalem,
which led to the U.S.-brokered Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty in
1979.
   Since becoming president in 1981, Mubarak has worked hard to
restore his country's status in the Arab world. Jordan was the
first of the Arab nations to resume diplomatic ties with Cairo in
1984, and today Egypt boasts close relations with all countries,
including hard-liners Syria and Libya.

   The United States today alerted its
NATO allies that it has prepared contingency plans in case Iraqi
troops push beyond Kuwaiti territory, an alliance source said.
   ``The United States informed the allies that it was aware that
Iraq may have designs beyond Kuwait and informed the allies that it
has drawn up contingency plans of action to respond to that
eventuality,'' said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   He said American officials did not explain what actions were
under consideration.
   They made their remarks during a special meeting of the
political committee of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization,
which is made up of top officials from each of the alliance's 16
member nations.
   During the meeting, he said the allies expressed ``very strongly
broad support for moving toward some coordinated action'' through
the United Nations. There was a sense, he said, that the allies
were prepared to move quickly.
   NATO's political committee, which meets regularly, held a
special meeting on Thursday to discuss the Iraqi invasion and was
expected to do so again on Monday.
   At the Thursday meeting, the United States urged the allies to
begin a commerical embargo, including arms shipments, and to freeze
Iraqi assets and take measures to prevent Baghdad from taking
Kuwaiti assets, sources said.
   On Friday, the allies reviewed what action their governments had
taken to protest Iraq's aggression against its Persian Gulf
neighbor, said the NATO source. Some had moved to freeze Kuwaiti
assets but ``most were not yet prepared to join in a broader trade
embargo,'' said the source.
   Those nations which are members of the European Community were
waiting to see what joint action might be recommended by the
trading bloc.
   Eleven of the community's 12 members belong to NATO. Only
neutral Ireland remains outside.

   Swift action to freeze Kuwaiti assets
overseas after Iraq's invasion of its oil-rich neighbor will
prevent strongman Saddam Hussein from reaping immediate economic
benefits.
   If Western nations also take additional moves to cut Iraq's oil
lifeline, Baghdad's already strapped economy will be dealt a harsh
blow.
   The United States took the lead by freezing billions of dollars
of Kuwaiti and Iraqi assets, banning imports of Iraqi oil and
imposing other trade sanctions. Oil accounts for 97 percent of
Iraq's exports to the United States.
   Kuwait had about $4.2 billion invested in the United States at
the end of 1989 and Iraq had almost nothing invested, according to
the U.S. Department of Commerce.
   Britain and France froze Kuwaiti assets to keep the country's
new Iraqi-installed government from seizing them. Japan, West
Germany, Italy, Belgium and Luxembourg have announced plans to do
so.
   The Netherlands was considering an assets freeze, but there were
no immediate indications whether the Dutch were prepared to bar
Iraqi oil from the major European port of Rotterdam _ a potentially
crippling blow.
   Senior officials from the 12 European Community nations were to
meet in Rome on Saturday to discuss economic and other sanctions
against Iraq, an EC source said Friday.
   But so far only the U.S. and French governments have blocked
Iraq's assets in their countries, and the United States has been
the only country to move firmly against Iraq's oil.
   Analysts stress that speed was essential in any successful move
to prevent Kuwait's $100 billion of assets overseas from getting
into the hands of the new Kuwaiti government.
   ``The priority today is to freeze Kuwaiti assets,'' said Andrew
Cunningham, associate editor at the Nicosia-based Middle East
Economic Survey.
   ``If you don't do it now, they'll get the assets,'' he said.
   In contrast, the United States and its allies have slightly more
time at their disposal to shape a collective policy to isolate
Iraq's own economy.
   ``Iraq is in an extremely vulnerable position,'' Cunningham
said, adding that Baghdad relies significantly on Western credits
but ``oil is the main thing.''
   Iraq uses three export routes for its oil: pipelines across
Saudi Arabia and Turkey, and the Persian Gulf sea outlet. The
pipelines were built during the eight-year Iran-Iraq war, when
Baghdad's traditional oil route through the gulf was repeatedly
attacked by Iran.
   After the war, Saddam hoped to found an ambitious reconstruction
program on oil income, but sagging oil prices undermined recovery
efforts.
   The uncertainties after Saddam's invasion of Kuwait are pushing
up oil prices, but with a big question mark over his ability to
sell it this may not be a benefit.
   It was unclear whether the invasion would slow or halt Kuwait's
oil production. Iraqi control of Kuwait's 94 billion barrels of
crude oil reserves, added to Baghdad's own 100 billion, will be of
little use to the Iraqis if they cannot market their oil.
   The war with Iran left Saddam a foreign debt from $60 billion to
$70 billion, including about $30 billion to Kuwait, Saudi Arabia
and other oil-rich Arab countries that helped finance his war.
   A desire to erase part of the debt burden was one reason behind
Saddam's sudden invasion.
   Iraq is saddled with overcentralized state industries and an
annual inflation rate conservatively estimated at 15 percent.
   Despite Saddam's attempts to revitalize the economy by selling
off $2.2 billion worth of public companies to private individuals
and removing some price controls, the recovery has been anemic.
   Using fear as a weapon to push for efficiency, Saddam has fired
state officials for inefficiency or corruption, but the hoped-for
economic boom did not materialize.
   Iraq also announced plans to slash public expenditure, and it
discharged more than 200,000 soldiers from the army, although with
the remobilization in the wake of the invasion, this saving will be
eliminated.
   Iraq relies significantly on financial credits from the West.
   Baghdad responded to the U.S. sanctions by freezing repayment of
$2.4 billion in Iraqi debts to the United States, a move it is
certain to duplicate against any other countries that block Iraqi
credits.
   Suspending repayments helps Iraq in the short term, but in the
long run Cunningham said ``they have been a net receiver of funds,
not a net payer,'' so the cutoff is sure to hurt.
   In addition, key Western technicians and consultants are likely
to be ordered out of Iraq, further crippling the economy.

   Iraq will suffer little from President Bush's
order freezing its U.S. assets, but the freeze on Kuwait's U.S.
investments should prevent Iraq from looting them, government
officials and private analysts say.
   Bush's response to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait also included a
trade embargo against Iraq. That shuts off the source of more than
7 percent of U.S. oil imports while blocking exports _ primarily
food _ to a $1 billion-a-year trading partner.
   The embargo prompted the Customs Service to seize more than 13
million gallons of Iraqi crude oil after it was unloaded from a
tanker in international waters off Texas, Customs spokeswoman
Sharon Goodson.
   The asset freeze announced Thursday will be implemented by the
Treasury Department, which spent much of the day trying to identify
Kuwaiti and Iraqi assets in the United States or under U.S. control
abroad. Department officials said they received hundreds of calls
from financial and business concerns likely to be affected by the
asset freeze and trade embargo.
   The latest government figures supported speculation by private
analysts that Kuwait's U.S. holdings are extensive, Iraq's slim.
   Commerce Department figures show $4.2 billion in Kuwaiti direct
investment in the United States at the end of last year. The
comparable figure for Iraq was essentially nothing.
   Direct investment includes real property and stock holdings of
more than 10 percent of a corporation's shares, but excludes
smaller stock holdings, bank deposits and holdings of government
bonds.
   In March, U.S. banks reported $12.5 billion in holdings,
including U.S. government bonds, of eight oil-producing Middle
Eastern countries lumped together in government statistics.
   ``This is not going to be anything more than a minor financial
burden on the Iraqis,'' said Stephen D. Cohen, an international
economist who lectures at the American University School of
International Service.
   Once Kuwait's U.S. assets are frozen, Iraq will be unable to
draw cash from or sell them even if it gains control of Kuwait's
central bank and other financial institutions, administration
officials said.
   A handful of analysts contacted Thursday said it was unlikely
Iraq would attempt to dip into Kuwaiti assets.
   ``I don't think the Iraqis are trying to kidnap the Kuwaiti
treasury,'' said Cohen.
   While it appears to have few holdings in the United States, Iraq
owes the U.S. government $2.24 billion, according to Treasury
Department figures. Iraq responded to the U.S. announcement by
freezing repayment of that debt to the United States, the official
Iraqi News Agency reported.
   Private analysts said any successful effort to pressure Iraq
with economic sanctions would depend on cooperation from allies in
Europe, where the oil-producing nations of the Middle East make
most of their foreign investments.
   Ralph C. Bryant, a former Federal Reserve official now with the
Brookings Institution, said any extended attempt to impose an asset
freeze might bring legal cases because of murky laws on whether the
United States can prevent overseas branches of U.S. banks from
releasing deposits to their owners.
   Bush's decision to impose a trade embargo put Iraq in the
company of South Africa, Libya, Cuba, Vietnam, North Korea and
Cambodia among nations under some form of U.S. trade sanctions.
   U.S. imports from Iraq totaled $2.4 billion in 1989, $2.3
billion of that in crude oil at 450,000 barrels a day. In the first
five months of 1990, the total was more than 600,000 barrels a day.
   U.S. exports to Iraq totaled $1.1 billion in 1989, mostly wheat,
rice and other agricultural products.

<TEXT>
   The Virginia woman who received obscene phone
calls from former American University President Richard Berendzen
said Friday she is seeking $11 million in damages for emotional
stress on her and her family.
   Susan Allen of Fairfax, Va., demanded $4 million from Berendzen
and $7 million from the university in a suit filed Thursday in
District of Columbia Superior Court.
   Allen said Friday that the calls had inflicted ``a life-altering
amount of stress and damage'' on her and her family, and had caused
her to be hospitalized.
   ``Ever since the day after the first phone call, I've been on
heart medication and other medication to sleep,'' Allen said. ``My
life has definitely taken a very negative turn. My smallest child
is terrified of any man she sees.''
   Berendzen's calls to Allen began in March in response to an
advertisement for home child care that she had placed in The
Washington Post.
   Allen said he asked her if she would include her son in her
sexual relations with her husband and said he had a female sex
slave in his basement.
   Berendzen, who remains a tenured professor at American, resigned
the presidency and entered the sexual disorders clinic at Johns
Hopkins University in Baltimore when an investigation revealed his
office was the source of the calls.
   He later pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor counts and was placed
on probation.
   Allen's lawsuit alleges American University did not act quickly
enough once the calls were traced to Berendzen's office on the
Washington campus.
   John Clifford, her attorney, said the school first confronted
Berendzen with its findings, and he then called Allen and ``said
she had destroyed his life.''
   Clifford said university officials did not pass their
information to investigators until two days after they had
discussed the matter with Berendzen.
   Anita Gottlieb, American University's assistant vice president,
said Friday that the school had not received a copy of the court
papers and had no immediate comment on the matter.
   Gerard Trainor, Berendzen's attorney, also was not available for
comment on the suit.

   A powerful earthquake jolted Iran's
oil-rich province of Khuzestan today, a little more than a month
after a devastating earthquake in the north killed 40,000 people.
   The Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in Nicosia, said the
tremor struck in mid-afternoon and measured 5.5 on the open-ended
Richter scale.
   The dispatch said reports of possible damage or loss of life
were not immediately available.
   Khuzestan is located on the oil-producing belt in southern Iran.
   IRNA said a series of strong jolts had also shaken the town of
Ardebil and surrounding areas in the northwestern province of East
Azerbaijan over the past three days.
   It said the strongest jolt, measuring 4.5 on the Richter scale,
occured Thursday night.
   The jolts caused considerable panic after the June 21 quake,
which registered 7.3 on the Richter scale, killed 40,000 people,
left 60,000 injured, and rendered half a million homeless in
northern Gilan and Zanjan provinces.

<TEXT>
   The American Bar Association has nothing to gain
by its abortion-rights position, the group's president-elect said
today in supporting the governing board's push for a neutral stance.
   ``We have lost 1,500 members'' since the nation's largest group
of lawyers adopted its position in February, president-elect John
Curtin of Boston said today in a telephone interview.
   On Thursday, the group's board of governors voted 21-9 to
recommend that the ABA House of Delegates, its policy-making group,
reconsider the abortion issue and take a neutral stance at its
meeting in Chicago next week.
   Officials said more than $300,000 in annual fees have been lost
as a result of member resignations from the 365,000-member group
since it adopted the position favoring abortion rights.
   Curtin said the stance would have negligible affect on the
abortion issue as a whole.
   ``There couldn't be a more debated issue in the whole history of
the country,'' Curtin said. ``The fact that the ABA has a position
on it will have no effect.''
   Curtin said he could not predict how the group's House of
Delegates would respond to the push for neutrality, but said he
believed there was a chance its stance would be overturned.
   Some groups said the neutrality stance would be a backwards step.
   ``Neutral is a cloak for retreating from pro-choice,'' said
Patricia Dougherty, executive director of the National Abortion
Rights Action League of Illinois.

<HEAD>PGA To Prohibit Tournaments at Clubs Where Bias `Raises a
Question'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PONTE VEDRA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Professional Golfers Association
Tour, reacting to threats of protest and sponsor pullouts at the
PGA Championship, said today it will prohibit tournaments at clubs
where membership even ``raises a question'' of discrimination.
   The policy would affect tournaments on the PGA Tour, the Senior
PGA Tour and Ben Hogan tour events.
   The statement comes after more than a week of controversy
concerning the national championship, which starts Thursday, and
its site, the previously all-white Shoal Creek country club in
Birmingham, Ala.
   Bowing to pressure from civil rights groups and planned
demonstrations, Shoal Creek awarded honorary membership to a black
businessman this week and said it was considering another black for
admission.
   ``In the event a golf club indicates its membership practices
and policies are non-discriminatory, but there is information that
raises a question as to such practices and policies ... the staff
is authorized to require on a case by case basis that as a
condition of hosting an event, the applicable golf club take
appropriate action to encourage minority membership,'' the PGA
statement said.
   The statement also said that no contracts for a tournament will
be extended ``unless the PGA Tour is satisfied that its
non-discriminatory policies are being enforced.''
   Although the Shoal Creek racial controversy has centered on the
PGA Championship, the Tour does not have jurisdiction over that
tournament.

<HEAD>North Korea Hints at Boycott of Prime Ministers' Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   North Korea, upset by rival South
Korea's moves to improve ties with the Soviet Union, indicated
Friday it might boycott historic talks between the two Koreas'
prime ministers.
   A South Korean government delegation is in Moscow discussing
issues that Seoul officials say include economic cooperation and
establishing diplomatic ties.
   North Korea's official Communist Party newspaper Rodong Sinmun
hinted at the possibility of a boycott of the prime ministers'
talks in a commentary carried by the Korean Central News Agency and
monitored in Tokyo.
   The newspaper denounced the South Korean delegation's visit to
Moscow as a divisive act ``going against the desire for
reunification.''
   It said if Seoul and Moscow open formal relations, it would
perpetuate the division of the Korean peninsula, bitterly divided
since 1945.
   The Soviet Union is a close ally and arms provider for North
Korea.
   In an unprecedented move last month, the rival Korean states
signed an accord setting up the first talks between their prime
ministers.
   The first meeting is to be held in Seoul beginning Sept. 4 and
the second is scheduled beginning Oct. 16 in North Korea's capital
of Pyongyang.
   Before signing the agreement, North Korea's chief delegate, Paik
Nam Jun, issued a veiled warning that any attempt by Seoul to
improve ties with Moscow would hurt the prime ministers' talks.
   The Seoul government believes expanded ties with Communist
nations will help open North Korea's closed society and thus ease
tension on the peninsula.
   South Korea has made great strides in improving ties with
socialist countries since the 1988 Olympics in Seoul. It has opened
formal relations with all East European nations except Albania and
East Germany.
   North Korea also charged that the Seoul government is trying to
disrupt a unification rally to be held with South Korean dissidents
at the border village of Panmunjom on Aug. 15.
   In Seoul, about 1,500 radical students and dissidents held a
demonstration pledging support for the Aug. 15 rally. They called
for an end to the U.S. military presence in South Korea and the
signing of a peace treaty to replace an armistice agreement that
ended the 1950-53 Korean War.
   The protesters said the stationing of 43,000 U.S. troops in
South Korea under a mutual defense treaty hurts efforts to unify
the peninsula.
   They also demanded efforts by the two Korean governments to open
their border and allow free travel for the 62 million people on the
two sides.
   South Korea has proposed a trial five-day border opening in
mid-August for unrestricted free travel. North Korea has in effect
rejected the suggestion.

   Two candidates in a down-to-the wire GOP
primary for the right to challenge incumbent Democrat Sen. Albert
Gore Jr. must wait after this weekend to find out the outcome of
the election.
   About 3,000 votes in Madison County will not be tabulated until
Monday, said Madison County Registrar Spence Dupree.
   ``We're going to count it as soon as we can, but we've got every
county position except for tax assessor to count first,'' Dupree
said.
   He said the county races would be tabulated first.
   As late returns came in today, only 11 votes separated the two
leading GOP contenders; so the Madison County votes could determine
the winner.
   With 2,293 of 2,415 precincts counted, or 95 percent, bankrupt
businessman Ralph Brown led conservative political economist
William Hawkins. Brown had 50,189 votes, and Hawkins 50,178 votes,
or 39 percent for both.
   In other races, the state's only black congressman crushed two
Democratic challengers in his second re-election campaign conducted
under the cloud of a federal bank-fraud indictment.
   Gore, 42, ran unopposed for the Democratic berth and was
expected to handle easily whichever Republican he faces in the Nov.
6 general election. He garnered 424,747 votes with 100 percent of
the precincts in.
   The 73-year-old Brown, who was forced to declare bankruptcy a
year ago, didn't wait up for the results of his campaign, on which
he spend less than $100. He turned in about midnight, said his wife
of 50 years, Marie.
   ``He was very excited. But it got late. You don't know who won,
do you?'' she asked a late-night caller.
   Gov. Ned McWherter received 376,123 Democratic votes and will
face Dwight Henry, a Republican freshman state lawmaker who
suspended his campaign in June and resumed it less than a week
before the election at the request of legislative colleagues.
   Henry said: ``I don't think there's any question about who the
David is in David vs. Goliath.''
   U.S. Rep. Harold Ford defeated state Rep. Pam Gaia and Memphis
businessman Mark Flanagan for the Democratic nomination. With 116
of 187 precincts counted, Ford had 28,380 votes, or 78 percent, to
6,946 votes, or 19 percent, for Gaia. Flanagan had 1,201 votes, or
3 percent.
   Ford, 45, will face Republican Aaron C. Davis, a 79-year-old
political newcomer, in the general election.
   He was indicted by a federal grand jury in 1987 on bank and mail
fraud charges. Jurors deadlocked in April after an 11-week trial.
Prosecutors say a second trial will be held, but no date has been
scheduled.
   The eight-term congressman's backers have remained loyal. He
contends the U.S. Justice Department targeted him for prosecution
because he is a prominent black leader.
   All nine of the state's congressional representatives are up for
re-election, but only one beside Ford faced primary opponents.
   U.S. Rep. Marilyn Lloyd, the state's only female member of
Congress, defeated David Ray Stacy, a pipe fitter. Like Ford, she
has been in Congress since 1975.
   A three-way Republican primary in the Sixth Congressional
District, which surrounds the Nashville area, included Jack Nugent,
a white supremacist from Columbia who has gathered little support.
   The seat is held by U.S. Rep. Bart Gordon, a Murfreesboro
Democrat.

<HEAD>German Leaders Urge Earlier Unity Vote; Berlin To Be New Capital</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto BER2</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH G. SEWARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WEST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Leaders of both Germanys on Friday urged
joint elections two months earlier than planned, and the countries
agreed to make Berlin their united capital.
   The early election plan ran into immediate objections from the
leftist Social Democrats, who form part of the East German
coalition government but are the opposition in West Germany.
   The Soviets said it could disrupt international talks on German
unification.
   East Germany's prime minister, Lothar de Maiziere, made the
proposal to advance all-German elections from Dec. 2 to Oct. 14.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl welcomed it, saying the
earlier vote ``corresponds with the wishes of the people in East
Germany and also in West Germany.'' Kohl's comments came in a
statement released by his office in Bonn. He was on vacation in
Austria.
   Under pressure for early unification, De Maiziere said he sought
``unity that was as quick as possible, but as good as needed'' and
hoped early elections would improve the climate for investment.
   He said the all-German elections should create ``political
clarity and with that also economic security.''
   The Dec. 2 date was informally approved by political groups in
both Germanys, and it may take complicated parliamentary
maneuvering to move up the vote.
   Social Democrats in both Germanys immediately criticized the
proposal. Oskar Lafontaine, the Social Democrats' challenger to
Kohl in the upcoming election, called the latest proposal a
``transparent manipulation attempt'' for Kohl and de Maiziere to
quickly capitalize on their popularity.
   He said the proposal for earlier elections breached an agreement
that was reached with the Social Democrats on a Dec. 2 election
date.
   The East German Social Democrats, de Maiziere's coalition
partners, accused the prime minister of ``election fraud'' and
trying to improve the chances of the Christian Democrats, both de
Maiziere's and Kohl's party.
   In Moscow, Soviet Foreign Ministry spokesman Yuri Gremitsky said
the call for early elections was an ``unexpected turn'' that could
disrupt international talks on German unity. The Soviet Union has
been East Germany's largest military and trading partner.
   The decision on making Berlin the new capital came as
negotiators for the two Germanys ironed out remaining points of
joining the two countries.
   The announcement in East Berlin left open the question of
whether all government offices would move there.
   ``The capital of Germany is Berlin. The question of the seat of
government will be settled after unification,'' the statement said.
   The terse declaration, which is expected to win easy approval in
both countries' parliaments, is unlikely to calm the storm
surrounding the capital.
   East Germans, joined by the West Berlin goverment, are demanding
the entire government return to the historic capital of Germany and
Prussia.
   Others object, with some saying that Berlin's shameful, 12-year
tenure as the seat of Nazi tyranny tainted the city in the world's
eyes.
   Currently, East Berlin is the capital of East Germany and Bonn
is West Germany's capital.
   In another development, West Germany's defense minister said
West German officers will run what is now the East German military
after unification.
   Defense Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said West German officers
would take charge of East German units in a unified army. He also
said the future army will be made up of 320,000 of the current West
German armed forces with 50,000 from the East German military.
   Kohl had said the combined German armed forces would be at
370,000. He made the comment during a meeting with Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev in southern Russia last month.
   De Maiziere's appeal came just one day after the two Germanys
signed a treaty for the first elections in a unified Germany in
nearly 60 years.
   Pressure for quicker unification has been building as East
Germany makes the difficult transition from communism to capitalism.
   The shift from a centrally planned economy to the free market
has already put more than 250,000 East Germans out of work. Experts
say 3 million could be left jobless as companies and factories are
unable to compete in the new market now that they are losing state
subsidies.
   De Maiziere said the all-German vote should coincide with East
German elections that will create five state governments to mirror
West Germany's federal system. According to law, those states can
then immediately seek unity with West Germany.
   The all-German vote will be the first ballot in a united Germany
since March 1933, when Adolf Hitler's National Socialists won a
plurality of seats in the Reichstag.

<HEAD>Jury: Film May Be Pornographic, But Not Obscene</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CLEARWATER, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   After watching a sexually explicit movie
in court, a jury agreed that the X-rated ``Spermbusters'' may be
pornographic, but it's not obscene.
   Walter M. Epler, a clerk at Pussy Cat Adult Bookstore in Largo,
was acquitted Thursday on a misdemeanor charge of distributing
obscene material. He was charged after renting a ``Spermbusters''
videotape to an undercover sheriff's detective.
   ``It's wasting tax dollars to be trying to persecute this type
of movie,'' said Stephen Bennett, a computer consultant who served
as foreman of the six-member Pinellas County Court jury.
   Epler was one of 15 people arrested last month in Pinellas
County Sheriff Everett Rice's crackdown on X-rated videos, during
which deputies also seized 39 videotapes from several adult
bookstores.
   He was the first to be tried.
   Epler did not dispute renting the film to the detective, so the
case centered on whether ``Spermbusters'' was obscene.
   Defense attorney Frank de la Grana called it an ``average,
all-American, X-rated film.''
   ``You are a barometer for this community,'' de la Grana told the
jury of three men and three women. The panel included a banker, an
electrician, an assembly worker, a factory foreman and an analyst.
   The jurors, who ranged in age from 29 to 50, all said they had
seen X-rated films before.
   The movie was billed as a parody of the hit ``Ghostbusters,''
although the connection was obscure. Many scenes featured sexual
intercourse and male and female genitalia.
   ``I realized why we had to view it, but it's not something that
you expect when you come in to do jury duty,'' said Bennett.
   Prosecutors argued that ``Spermbusters'' fit the U.S. Supreme
Court's three-part test for obscene material by appealing to
prurient interests, depicting sex in a patently offensive way and
lacking any serious literary, artistic, political or scientific
value.
   ``Art? Come on, ladies and gentlemen,'' said Assistant State
Attorney Joe Mueller. ``Was there even a plot?''
   But de la Grana said the availability and demand for such movies
in the western Florida county was one way of measuring contemporary
community standards. The Supreme Court has held that such standards
should apply in judging offensiveness.
   Bennett said jurors did not consider the film art and were
divided over whether it appealed to purient interests, defined as a
``shameful or morbid interest in sex.''
   But they agreed the movie was not patently offensive. He said
such a description fits depictions of child pornography, bestiality
or sado-masochism.
   ``I do agree there is some limit,'' he said. ``But I don't think
this film went beyond that limit.''

<HEAD>Dow Jones Tumbles More Than 100 Points At Mid-Afternoon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stock prices plummeted in afternoon trading
today amid continued tension over Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, with
the Dow Jones industrial average skidding down more than 100 points.
   ``The Middle East remains a tinderbox,'' said Alan Ackerman, a
market strategist with Gruntal &amp; Co. ``It's unstable and
unpredictable.''
   The key Dow Jones average of 30 big industrial stocks was down
about 118 points in sustained selling shortly before 2 p.m. on Wall
Street.
   In the broader market, traders said over-the-counter stocks were
swamped with sell orders.
   The stock market was battered by fears that higher energy prices
worldwide resulting from the Iraqi invasion would trigger inflation
and further destabilize the U.S. economy.
   Already in a downslide because of recent reports of underlying
economic weakness, the market was hit with more bad economic news
this morning as the government reported higher unemployment in July.
   The Labor Department said non-farm payroll employment fell by
219,000 in July, surprising analysts who had been looking for a
modest increase. The civilian unemployment rate jumped three-tenths
of a percentage point, to 5.5 percent.
   But market participants had their eye on Iraq, concerned that
while Kuwait's oil reserves may not be critical to world supplies,
further moves by Iraq could threaten oil from Saudi Arabia and
other nations.
   ``The real concern is how far will Iraq go in the Middle East,''
Ackerman said. ``There's an absence of superpower intervention.
Obviously there's a lot of nervousness worldwide.''
   The Dow industrials fell 34.66 points Thursday on fears that a
possible disruption of oil supplies could spark inflation and
recession in the United States.

<HEAD>Government Says Korean Sweaters Sold Too Cheap</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sweaters made of man-made fibers in South
Korea are being sold in the United States at less than fair market
value, the Commerce Department said Friday.
   The finding clears the way for the International Trade
Commission to consider whether to impose import duties that would
bring prices for the cut-rate sweaters into line with American-made
garments.
   The National Knitwear &amp; Sportswear Association in New York had
filed complaints last September against sweater manufacturers in
South Korea, Hong Kong and Taiwan.
   The department ruled on July 21 that sweaters from Hong Kong
were being dumped in the United States. It is scheduled to rule
Aug. 17 on the imports from Taiwan.
   If the ITC finds the South Korean products are harming U.S.
industry, the government can impose duties on the imports to make
their prices comparable with those of U.S. companies.
   The department said imports represent 72 percent of the $1.3
billion U.S. sweater market and the three countries represent 55
percent of the imports. It said the value of the sweaters imported
from South Korea in 1989 was $476.1 million; from Hong Kong, $208.8
million, and Taiwan, $485.5 million.
   The department said the imports are made predominantly of
acrylic fiber. Sweaters containing at least 23 percent wool are
excluded.

   The manned spacecraft Soyuz TM-10 docked with the
orbiting Mir space station on Friday, two days after it was
launched, the Soviet news agency Tass reported.
   The docking was ``made neatly and precisely on time,'' Tass said.
   Flight commander Lt. Col. Gennady Manakov and engineer Gennady
Strekalov will spend one week working with the old crew which has
been on board since Feb. 11.
   They replace cosmonauts Anatoly Solovyev and Alexander Balandin,
who are scheduled to return to Earth on Aug. 9, following a mission
plagued by problems with the spacecraft's thermal insulation and a
broken hatch.
   Watching from mission control center were two employees of the
Tokyo Broadcasting system who are vying to fly into space in
December: television camerawoman Ryoko Kikuchi and former
Washington bureau chief Toyohiro Akiyama.
   Manakov and Strekalov will spend 132 days in the Mir and will
conduct 250 experiments, including the growing of pure crystals to
be used as semiconductors and computer chips. They will make at
least two space walks, Tass said.
   Their craft was launched Wednesday from the Baikonur Space
Center in Soviet Central Asia.

<HEAD>House Rebuffs Bush and Approves Landmark Civil Rights Bill</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: COMBINES pvs</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House approved a landmark civil rights
bill today, brushing off a last-minute veto threat by President
Bush, who contends the minority-hiring provisions in the
legislation would lead to quotas.
   ``Stand up for what you know is right, stand up for America's
values,'' Rep. Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., urged as the House approved
the bill, 272-154.
   The measure goes to a House-Senate conference committee, where
prospects for compromise appear good. The Senate two weeks ago
approved a version similar in all but a few features.
   Approval came minutes after release of a letter from Bush,
threatening a veto and offering to sign an alternative version that
he called a ``sound, practical compromise.''
   He said that without changes the bill ``will have the effect of
forcing businesses to adopt quotas in hiring and promotion.''
   ``It will also foster divisiveness and litigation rather than
conciliation and do more to promote legal fees than civil rights,''
Bush said.
   The alternative was rejected, however, as the House pressed
ahead with the measure that would effectively overturn five Supreme
Court decisions last year and that tops the civil rights
community's congressional list.
   Major provisions range from a ban on racial harassment in the
workplace to barriers to reopening court-approved fair-hiring
agreements.
   The alternative version proposed by Rep. John LaFalce, D-N.Y.,
and praised by Bush would have tempered language designed to make
it easier to win job bias suits against employers based on
statistics.
   It also would have capped at $100,000 punitive damages for
intentional discrimination that courts could award to women,
religious minorities and the disabled. The bill places no limit on
such damages.
   The LaFalce plan represented the major effort of critics to
change the bill. It was rejected, 238-188.
   Lawmakers spoke of fierce last-minute lobbying on the plan.
   ``The pressures have been enormous, the intimidation has belied
the vision and hope of civil rights, but in the end it is my face
in that mirror,'' said Rep. Nancy Johnson, R-Conn., a supporter of
LaFalce.
   Democrats were harshly critical of the amendment.
   ``It rips the heart out,'' said Judiciary Chairman Jack Brooks,
D-Texas. ``We need some truth in labeling around here. You can't
just slap on the label civil rights.''
   The bill's chief House sponsor said Thursday night it was
strengthened against the alternative version after supporters
adopted their own version of cap on damages for women, religious
minorities and the disabled.
   ``The southern Democrats voted with us on this cap and most of
them will now be with us, so I think we'll have a whopping good
vote,'' said Rep. Augustus Hawkins, D-Calif., chairman of the
Education and Labor Committee.
   The cap, approved 289-134, would limit punitive damages for
women who are victims of intentional job discrimination to $150,000
or the amount of compensatory damages, whichever is larger.
   Women's rights groups say there should be no cap, because
unlimited punitive damages are allowed in cases of racial
discrimination.
   Sponsors supported a similar cap when the Senate passed the
measure but were outmaneuvered. Doing the job in the House was
regarded as crucial to the long-run efforts of sponsors to send the
bill to Bush.
   In the short run, Hawkins said, the buttressing of southern
Democratic support cleared the way for defeat of the LaFalce
amendment.
   The LaFalce plan was similar to a proposal sponsored in the
Senate by Sen. Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan., but which never was brought
to a vote.

   The Soviet Union and the United States today
demanded that all countries cut off arms supplies to Iraq because
of its invasion of Kuwait, and the Soviet foreign minister
predicted Iraq would soon withdraw from Kuwait.
   The minister, Eduard Shevardnadze, and Secretary of State James
A. Baker III read a joint statement demanding the arms cutoff to
reporters after a hastily scheduled, one-hour meeting at a Moscow
airport.
   The U.S.-Soviet statement, a rare case of superpower cooperation
in pursuit of peace, noted that the Soviet Union had cut off arms
supplies to Iraq on Thursday and that United States had frozen
Iraqi assets. The two superpowers also demanded in the statement
that Iraq withdraw its troops from Kuwait.
   Shevardnadze also told reporters, ``We have been assured that
very soon the Iraqis will pull out their troops.'' He said the
Soviets, until this week Iraq's largest arms supplier, learned this
through contacts in Baghdad.
   After Iraq overran Kuwait Thursday, ostensibly because a dispute
over oil and a border region, it said its forces could withdraw
within a week or two. But fighting continued today in Kuwait,
especially in oil fields near the border with Saudi Arabia,
prompting fears that Iraq would expand its invasion.
   Shevardnadze said the Soviet leadership had sent a message to
Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein on Thursday, but he did not reveal the
contents.
   The U.S.-Soviet statement demanded that other countries stop
sending arms to Iraq, but it did not mention by name the Middle
East nation's other major weapons suppliers.
   Shevardnadze opened the news conference by saying the Kremlin's
decision to cut off its arms supplies to Iraq was difficult. ``It
wasn't so easy for us to make the kind of statement we made
yesterday,'' because Soviet relations with Iraq had been good for
decades, he said.
   Shevardnadze said the invasion ``contradicts the principles of
new political thinking and the principles of civilized relations
between nations.''
   A report on Soviet TV news said: ``The statement contains an
appeal to the international public to come out together in
condemnation of the act of aggression.'' Washington and Moscow have
condemned the invasion on their own.
   Baker's plane arrived in Moscow from Mongolia today more than an
hour late because a tire blew when it landed for refueling in the
Siberian city of Irkutsk. Baker cut short his state visit to
Mongolia for the Moscow talks.
   Before leaving the Mongolian capital of Ulan Bator, Baker told
reporters: ``I just hope that the United States and Soviet Union
could join in a joint statement regarding this matter. The fact, I
think, of our doing that would be quite unique and rather
significant.''
   In Mongolia, Baker said the United States is offering that
Communist country $1.1 million and special trade status to help
transform the economy into a democratic free-market system.
   Baker completed the official portion of his trip, a sign of the
United States' interest in promoting ties with the longtime Soviet
satellite, before leaving ahead of schedule to stop in Moscow. He
had planned to spend the weekend hunting and fishing in Mongolia's
Gobi Desert.
   Baker's visit to Mongolia was the first by a top U.S. official
since Vice President Henry Wallace came in 1944.

   Government troops and rebels loyal to
Prince Johnson fired rockets and shells Friday in block-by-block
fighting for the ravaged Liberian capital.
   The bodies of several pedestrians killed by the cross-fire were
left lying on the sidewalk.
   Branches were blown off trees. Damaged downtown shop fronts were
blasted anew by the indiscriminate firing.
   The clashes followed a one-day lull in the 7-month-old civil
war, when Johnson's men had apparently pulled back to face a
possible threat from forces loyal to rival rebel leader Charles
Taylor.
   There was no sign that Taylor's men had progressed from the
suburb of Paynesville, six miles east of the city, where they have
been blocked by President Samuel Doe's troops for more than a month.
   Artillery shells started a fire several blocks away from a huge
exibition building that was razed Thursday. No firefighters were
seen, and the blaze raged unchecked.
   Rockets and shells were fired at the city center by both sides
as the front line repeatedly shifted from street to street.
   Reporters cruising by car through the deserted streets briefly
came under fire, but the source of the shooting could not be
determined.
   On Bushrod Island, several thousand hungry people stood in line
in hope of buying a ticket that would get them a bag of rice. One
woman said she had been waiting for three days.
   Most of Monrovia's 500,000 inhabitants have been without food,
running water or electricity since last month.
   About 5,000 people, mostly civilians, have died since rebels
invaded from neighboring Ivory Coast in December. The rebels accuse
Doe, who took power in a 1980 coup, of corruption and human rights
abuses.
   The insurgents have since split into two factions _ those led by
Johnson and those of Taylor, who led the original invasion.
Johnson's army has emerged as the stronger force, according to
foreign diplomats.
   A peace feeler was put out by one of Doe's ministers, who asked
that his name not be used. He said he was eager to talk to Johnson
about possible ways to end the fighting, ``which is killing untold
numbers of people.''
   The minister stressed the offer would include Doe's
unconditional resignation, but would require the nomination of a
provisional government.
   ``He can't resign without having someone replace him,'' the
minister said. But he said he was acting on his own initiative, and
had not advised Doe of his move.
   Johnson, informed of the proposal at his headquarters in a
roadside cafe on bushrod island, scorned the minister's offer and
said he was interested only in getting Doe, ``not in his maneuvers
to save himself.''
   ``When I get him, he will be put on trial for killing
Liberians,' he said. ``But if he is convicted, we will imprison him
for life. We will not kill him.''
   On Monday, up to 600 civilian refugees were killed in a Lutheran
church compound. Witnesses said the slayings were committed by
government troops. Doe said rebels dressed as government soldiers
were to blame.
   The victims were members of the Gio and Mano tribes, from which
the rebels get most of their support. Soldiers accused of the
massacre were said by witnesses to belong to Doe's Krahn tribe or
the Mandingo tribe.

   Shelling and gunfire today shook portions of
Kuwait's capital, indicating a last-ditch attempt by Kuwaiti forces
to hold out against the more powerful Iraqi army. World reaction
toughened against Iraq's invasion.
   President Bush met with advisers amid concerns Iraq would try to
push into Saudi Arabia. A NATO source said the United States had
alerted allies it had ``contingency plans'' if the Iraqis pushed
beyond Kuwaiti territory.
   The Soviet Union said it had been told through contacts in the
Iraqi capital, Baghdad, that Iraqi troops would soon withdraw from
Kuwait.
   In Washington, the State Department said Iraqi troops were
within 5 to 10 miles of the Saudi border. The department also said
14 Americans are now known to be missing in Kuwait and Washington
believed they were in Iraqi hands.
   The USS Independence, backed by six U.S. warships, headed to the
Persian Gulf to back up eight warships already there. France also
announced it was sending a second warship to the gulf.
   The United States and the Soviet Union, in a rare joint
statement issued in Moscow, demanded an international cutoff of
arms supplies to Iraq and pressed for an early Iraqi withdrawal
from Kuwait.
   Major nations, including some heavily dependent on Iraqi oil,
today followed the superpowers in announcing measures aimed at
pressuring Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait. Egypt joined in the
condemnation.
   In other developments:
   _A missile landed on Saudi territory near the convergence of the
Saudi, Iraqi, and Kuwaiti borders, diplomats in Saudi Arabia said.
No injuries or damage were reported.
   _Fourteen American oil workers were missing in the wake of the
invasion. State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said the U.S.
Embassy in Baghdad has pressed the foreign ministry to account for
them ``on an immediate basis,'' but so far Iraq had not responded.
   _Jordan's King Hussein said an Arab summit would be held in
Saudi Arabia on Sunday to discuss the crisis.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, in an unprecedented display of
superpower cooperation, issued a joint statement in Moscow calling
for all nations to stop shipping arms to Iraq and pressing for a
pullout of Iraqi troops. At the Moscow news conference,
Shevardnadze predicted that withdrawal would occur soon.
   Iraqi troops backed by 350 tanks and air cover swept into Kuwait
before dawn Thursday and penetrated as far as Kuwait's southern oil
fields near the border with Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest
producer of oil.
   A well-informed diplomatic source said there had been no
movement of Iraqi troops across the Saudi frontier today. But some
members of Congress expressed fears Thursday that Saudi Arabia
could be the next target of Iraq's president, Saddam Hussein.
   The State Department said today Iraqi troops were within five to
10 miles of the Saudi border. ``Their presence there clearly raises
significant concern,'' said Boucher.
   The NATO source, speaking in Brussels on condition of anonymity,
said the United States informed allies during a special meeting
``that it was aware that Iraq may have designs beyond Kuwait and
informed the allies that it has drawn up contingency plans of
action to respond to that eventuality.'' He said American officials
did not explain what actions were under consideration.
   Details of the situation in Kuwait, an oil-rich sheikdom on the
Persian Gulf, were hard to come by. Telephone operators in Bahrain
said it appeared phone lines were cut this afternoon.
   A curfew was in force, all ports were sealed, the airport
remained closed and the three main land crossings into Kuwait were
impassable, said a British Embassy official, reached by telephone
in the morning.
   Diplomats said shelling was heard through the night at the
country's main military barracks in Shuwaikh, in the northern part
of Kuwait city.
   Residents woke to what one described as ``as very active
gunshots and louder explosions than at any time'' since the
invasion. There was also shelling on the coast, 16 miles from
Shuwaikh, and two military vehicles were on fire, said residents
reached by telephone.
   The British Embassy official, quoted by the British news agency
Press Association, reported explosions and gunfire along the
seafront and around key installations, including the emir's palace.
   The reports indicated stiffer resistance than on the first day
of the invasion, when Iraqi quickly soldiers seized all government
buildings in Kuwait city.
   However, Kuwait's entire military has about 20,300 soldiers,
most of whom have never seen combat. Iraq's armed forces number 1
million and are battled-hardened after eight years of war with Iran.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait after two weeks of
threats stemming from a dispute over oil and land. Saddam accused
Kuwait of stealing oil from a field that includes land both sides
claim. He also blamed Kuwait for a drop in world oil prices, saying
it cheated on OPEC production levels. Oil is Iraq's main revenue
source, and the invasion could double Iraq's oil supplies.
   Within hours of the assault, Kuwait's ruler, Sheik Jaber
al-Ahmed al-Sabah, had fled his palace, reportedly for Saudi Arabia.
   Despite seemingly impossible odds, the sheik's government vowed
to fight to win back the country. His radio station, beaming from
an unknown location, appealed for help from the Arab world.
   In a break with its major Arab neighbors, who remained
conspicuously silent, Egypt today strongly condemned the invasion
and called for the immediate withdrawal of Iraqi troops.
   The official Iraq News Agency today said ``massive
demonstrations'' were held in Baghdad and other Iraqi cities to
support the invasion.
   There was no further word on casualties. Diplomats said at least
200 Kuwaitis were killed or wounded the day before, most of them
from the government's Emiri Guard.
   Officials in Washington said the number of missing Americans was
unclear. On Thursday, State Department officials said eight
American workers were seized. Today, White House spokesman Douglas
Davidson said an oil company reported eight people missing, six of
them Americans.
   An embassy official in Baghdad was dispatched to Iraq's Foreign
Ministry to inquire about the Americans. Word of the detentions
came from a U.S. oil company for whom the Americans worked. U.S.
officials refused to identify the company.
   There are about 3,000 Americans living in Kuwait, where an
estimated 60 percent of the 1.9 million people are foreigners. Most
of the Americans work in the oil business.
   The invasion occurred a day after talks intended to resolve the
Iraqi-Kuwaiti dispute collapsed. It drew immediate worldwide
condemnation and harsh sanctions.
   The Soviet Union, Iraq's main arms supplier, announced a halt to
weapons sales to Baghdad. Bush froze Iraqi assets and blocked most
Iraqi imports, including the all-important oil. He also froze
Kuwaiti assets to protect them from Iraq.
   France froze Iraqi and Kuwaiti assets, while Britain put a hold
on Kuwait assets only. Japan, West Germany, Italy, Belgium and
Luxembourg were among the nations announcing similar moves today.
   Japanese officials met to decide how far to go in matching the
U.S. economic sanctions.
   South Korea _ which imports all its oil, nearly 12 percent of it
from Kuwait and Iraq _ was setting up an emergency task force to
deal with possible disruptions in the oil supply.

   The White House today pressed Iraq for
information about Americans missing in Kuwait and said Iraq's
``ruthlessness and disregard for international law'' raised serious
concerns that its conquering troops might move next into Saudi
Arabia.
   ``We are extremely concerned about the possibility of Iraq
broadening its invasions plans to any other country. ... They are
close enough to the Saudi border to indicate cause for concern. But
we don't know what their intentions or motives are,'' White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said.
   On Capitol Hill, Rep. Les Aspin, chairman of the Hous Armed
Services Committee said that since Thursday's invasion Iraq has
moved two additional military units from their positions along the
Iranian border to the staging area near the junction of Kuwait,
Iraq and Saudi Arabia.
   ``I think it means war'' if Iraqi forces cross into Saudi
Arabia, Aspin said. ``I say that not as a threat but as a
prediction. The world cannot sit back and watch a person like
Saddam Hussein take over half of the oil reserves in the world.''
   The United States informed Western allies today that it did not
rule out military action should Iraqi troops push beyond Kuwaiti
territory, Fitzwater told reporters.
   President Bush spent 75 minutes this morning with top advisers
reviewing intelligence on the tense situation in the Middle East
and the progress in implementing U.S. economic sanctions against
Iraq, including a trade embargo that already had led to the seizure
of Iraqi crude oil, Fitzwater said.
   Also discussed was the potential impact of the sanctions on U.S.
oil supplies and prices, with a consensus emerging that the harm
would be ``moderate or slight,'' Fitzwater said.
   The immediate efforts were aimed at a diplomatic solution to the
crisis, but Fitzwater said there was no indication Iraq planned to
heed international demands that it withdraw from Kuwait.
   ``At this point we have received only scorn from Iraq and no
indication that they intend to comply,'' Fitzwater said.
   The State Department today said 14 Americans were missing in
Kuwait and believed to be held by Iraqi troops.
   Spokesman Richard Boucher said some Iraqi forces were positioned
5 miles to 10 miles from the Saudi border. Saudi diplomats also
reported a missile landing in the border area but reported no
injuries.
   As tensions rose in the troubled region, the State Department
advised the 3,000 Americans in Kuwait and the 500 in Iraq to leave
as quickly as possible. In Kuwait, however, airports and ports are
closed.
   Fitzwater said the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Thomas
Pickering, was pushing for U.N. sanctions against Iraq that include
``the full range of action by air, sea or land forces that may be
necessary to maintain or restore international peace or security,
including blockade.''
   Fitzwater said the administration had demanded from the Iraqi
ambassador to the United States a full and immediate accounting of
American citizens missing in Kuwait.
   In Moscow, where the United States and the Soviet Union issued a
rare joint statement condemning the invasion, Soviet officials
predicted Iraq would soon withdraw its troops.
   Fitzwater was not as optimistic.
   ``Clearly the actions of Iraq at this point indicate a
ruthlessness and disregard for international law that must make us
concerned about all the other countries in the region and their
security,'' the White House spokesman said.
   As Bush mulled his options, an irate Congress pressed for a
worldwide embargo on Iraqi oil and some members worried aloud about
the potential for Iraqi leader Hussein to strike against other
oil-producing nations.
   ``If there's an intention of Iraq to overrun Saudi Arabia, then
I think this would call for a direct military response by the
United States, Western Europe, maybe even the Soviet Union,'' House
Speaker Thomas S. Foley said today on NBC. ``This would be an
action that could not be ignored.''
   Bush's immediate military options are considered limited because
U.S. forces in the area lack sufficient attack power to mount a
formidable challenge to the battle-tested Iraqis.
   One aircraft carrier, the USS Independence, was ordered Thursday
to head to the Persian Gulf to add firepower to the U.S. presence
but was said to be several days away. The Pentagon today said
another carrier, the USS Saratoga, and the assault ship USS Inchon
were to head for the Mediterranean within the next few days for
deployments the Defense Department said had been planned for months.
   The administration also dispatched an embassy official in
Baghdad to Iraq's foreign ministry to ask about the Americans
missing since Wednesday. The State Department said the official
would ``remind them of their commitment to safeguard American
lives.''
   The president warned Thursday that any harm to American citizens
would drastically change the U.S. posture toward Iraq, which
continued today to consolidated its control over the oil-rich
Kuwait emirate.
   Iraq's invasion was a dash of cold water to international
diplomats still basking in the end of the Cold War. No superpower
appeared to be influencing Iraq today; Secretary of State James A.
Baker III was in Moscow for the unusual joint U.S.-Soviet
declaration against the invasion.
   Bush said he hoped an international effort could persuade Saddam
to restore Kuwait's autonomy.
   ``We're not ruling any options in, but we're not ruling any
options out,'' the president said Thursday when asked whether he
was ready to use military might to force a withdrawal of the Iraqi
invasion that sent worldwide oil prices upward.
   Bush spoke by telephone with Saudi Arabia's King Fahd, and
Fitzwater said ``they agreed that the attack on Kuwait was
absolutely unacceptable.''
   Pentagon officials said it would take at least several weeks to
deploy a signifcant counterforce.
   The aircraft carrier Independence _ with jet fighters, attack
aircraft and bombers aboard _ and six escort ships were dispatched
to the Persian Gulf from the Indian Ocean, a journey of several
thousand miles. The Navy already has eight warships in the gulf,
but they lack attack and bomber aircraft and pose no significant
threat to the Iraqi force.
   The Saratoga, based in Florida, was to head for the
Mediterranean on Tuesday; the Inchon, now at Norfolk, Va., carries
a Marine amphibious assault group and is due to leave for the
Mediterranean on Monday, the Pentagon said. Although said to be
routine, those deployments would significantly add to the U.S.
forces in the area.
   Bush returned after midnight from a visit to Colorado, where he
met with British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Both leaders
pressed for worldwide sanctions against Iraq. Bush dropped plans
for a weekend at Camp David, returning instead to the White House.
   The Congress moved quickly to support Bush's economic sanctions,
even as some members doubted they would deter Hussein.
   The Senate, in a 97-0 vote endorsing sanctions, urged Bush to
help organize an international economic boycott. The House voted
416-0 to cut off Iraq's $200 million a year in Export-Import Bank
credits and tighten restrictions on U.S. exports with possible
military applications.
   The president's order froze all Iraqi assets and banned nearly
all commerce _ including the 588,000 barrels of Iraqi oil purchased
daily by the United States. The impact was felt immediately as the
Customs Service seized more than 13 million gallons of Iraqi crude
off the coast of Texas.
   Iraq swiftly retaliated, saying it would suspend payments on its
$2.4 billion debt to the United States.
   The United States gets half of its oil from abroad, and 10
percent from Iraq and Kuwait. America imported about $2.4 billion
in oil and other goods last year from Iraq; U.S. exports to Iraq,
chiefly agricultural commodities, totaled $1.17 billion in 1989.

   The Iraqi invasion of Kuwait created new
worries Friday for the families of Americans held hostage in
Lebanon because of a complicated link between the captives and a
group of Kuwaiti prisoners.
   ``What has always frustrated the families is that anything that
happens in the Middle East has a ripple effect,'' said Peggy Say,
the sister of Terry Anderson, the longest held of the six U.S.
hostages in Lebanon.
   Say and others said they are concerned because the fate of 15
prisoners in Kuwait _ the so-called Dawa prisoners _ are connected
to American hostages in Lebanon.
   Experts say that Imad Mugniyeh, a Moslem Shiite accused of
masterminding American kidnappings in Lebanon, is the
brother-in-law of Mustafa Yousef Badreddin, one of the prisoners in
Kuwait.
   Badreddin and 14 others are serving life sentences in Kuwait for
the 1983 bombings of the U.S. and French embassies in Kuwait.
   Mugniyeh, who operates under cover of the shadowy Islamic Jihad
movement, has insisted the American hostages in Lebanon will not be
freed until the Kuwaiti prisoners are released.
   The status of the Kuwaiti prisoners was unclear after Iraqi
troops overran the oil-rich emirate. But one report said the
prisoners had been taken to Baghdad, the capital of Iraq, according
to Shireen Hunter, a Middle East expert at the Center for Strategic
and International Studies.
   The State Department said it could not confirm the report.
   ``We don't want to speculate'' on where the prisoners are, said
Joe Reap, a department spokesman. ``We have no idea what effect
this might have on the hostages (in Lebanon),'' he said.
   ``It's a crap-shoot,'' said Bill Foley, who works with the
Journalists Committee To Free Terry Anderson, a group formed to
seek freedom for Anderson and the others. Anderson, who was seized
in March 1985, is a correspondent for The Associated Press.
   But Hunter said moving the prisoners to Baghdad would
``complicate the situation even more'' because the prisoners are no
friends of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
   If any harm came to the Kuwaiti prisoners, the fear is that
Islamic Jihad might retaliate against the Americans. On the other
hand, Hunter said, removing the Kuwaiti prisoners from Kuwait might
actually bode well for the hosages.
   The prisoners are thought to be pro-Iranian, even though 12 of
them are Iraqis who belong to the fundamentalist Shiite Dawa
Islamiya movement. The other three, including Badreddin, are
Lebanese.
   The volatile nature of politics in the Middle East is upsetting
to families of the U.S. hostages because it keeps them on emotional
tenterhooks, Say said. The Iraqi invasion is just another example,
she said.

<HEAD>Arizona Man Survives Three Days in Desert</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WITTMANN, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 65-year-old epileptic man stranded in
the Arizona desert survived for nearly three days by eating cactus
and crawling in search of shade, his daughter-in-law said.
   Manuel Cantu of Wittmann became so desperate that he tried to
blow up his disabled car with a gunshot to the gas tank in hopes
someone would see the fire, said Diane Cantu.
   Cantu, who was reported missing Monday, was rescued Thursday
after a rancher heard his call for help on a citizens band radio, a
spokesman for the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office said.
   He was treated for dehydration and sunburn at Phoenix General
Hospital and Medical Center but was in good condition Friday,
family members said.
   ``He's a real cowboy in the truest sense,'' said Diane Cantu.
``He's spent a lot of time in the desert, and he knows survival
skills.''
   Cantu left home Monday morning to go target shooting in the
surrounding desert, said his daughter-in-law. His car got stuck in
sand in a deserted area about 30 miles northwest of Phoenix, where
temperatures soared well above 100 degrees this week.
   Cantu has epilepsy and was not carrying medicine, but did not
have a seizure during the ordeal, she said.
   When his small container of water ran out, Cantu ripped apart
cactus and chewed the inside for moisture.
   During the day, he crawed under palo verde trees, which provide
little shade, she said.
   Diane Cantu said her father-in-law tried to set a signal fire by
shooting his car's gasoline tank but ``the thing wouldn't blow up.''
   A rescue plane spotted Cantu's car Thursday morning, after he
reached a rancher via his CB radio and the rancher called
authorities, said sheriff's spokesman Duane Brady.

<TEXT>
   A strong earthquake jolted the oil-rich
Iranian province of Khuzestan on Friday, a little more than a month
after a devastating earthquake in the north killed 40,000 people.
   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitored in
Nicosia, said the temblor struck at mid-afternoon and measured 5.5
on the open-ended Richter scale.
   Reports on damages or casualties were not immediately available,
the dispatch said. Khuzestan is located on the oil-producing belt
in southern Iran.
   IRNA said a series of strong jolts had also shaken the town of
Ardebil and surrounding areas in the northwestern province of East
Azerbaijan over the past three days.
   The recent temblors caused considerable panic in the wake of the
June 21 earthquake that registered 7.3 on the Richter scale. That
quake killed 40,000 people, injured 60,000 and left half a million
people homeless in northern Gilan and Zanjan provinces.

<HEAD>Woman Sets Record for Solo Transatlantic Crossing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BREST, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 33-year-old Frenchwoman on Friday set a
record for a solo sailboat crossing of the Atlantic Ocean, French
media reported.
   The woman, Florence Arthaud, beat the old best time, set by a
Frenchman, by nearly two days, according to the reports.
   Ms. Arthaud arrived at Lizard Point in southwestern Britain in
the pre-dawn hours after a voyage of nine days, 21 hours and 42
minutes, said Louis Bodin, a friend of Arthaud's who helped guide
her across the Atlantic.
   The previous record of 11 days, 11 hours and 47 minutes _ about
40 hours slower than Ms. Arthaud's time _ was set by Bruno Peyron
of France aboard a catamaran in 1987.
   ``I'm happy I've arrived. It's the first time I'm really happy
it's over because it was really tough,'' she said in a French radio
interview.
   ``It's really trying on the nerves to make a crossing like
that,'' she said. ``I don't get seasick, but during the whole trip
my stomach was tied in knots.''
   Ms. Arthaud set out from New York City on July 24 aboard the
60-foot trimaran Pierre Premier.
   She averaged a speed of 12.1 knots, or 12.5 miles per hour, over
the 2,800-mile route, Bodin said. The crossing would have taken
less time except there was little wind during the last 80 miles, he
said.
   ``For me, the record is no more and no less than a regular
sailing trip,'' Ms. Arthaud said in a radio interview. ``It wasn't
routine but it's part of my daily life. It's my life, always trying
to go faster.''

<HEAD>Mysterious Illness Confirmed in 54 Cases</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TEMPLE, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Since March, physicians throughout Texas
have reported 149 cases of a mysterious new illness called
Palestine Syndrome. The malady mostly strikes children and is
characterized by high fever and temporary arthritis.
   Dr. Jeffrey W. Jundt, a physician at Scott and White Memorial
Hospital who first identified the illness, said Thursday that
experts still know little of its origins and are uncertain of how,
or if, it can be prevented or cured.
   It has not been fatal and victims recover completely, Jundt
said, but some patients have been hospitalized as long as six
months.
   ``We have no idea whether it's increasing, but we're not being
swamped with cases,'' said Jeffrey Taylor with the Texas Department
of Health. ``There are some new ones that have onset in July, and
we are following up on those.''
   The illness was named after a town about midway between Dallas
and Houston where it was first encountered last March.
   Although the ailment is named for Palestine, so far only four
confirmed cases have come from there. Taylor said cases have been
identified in 34 Texas counties, most in the north central and
eastern sections of the state.
   Scott and White hospital spokeswoman Charlene Lee said the
hospital has received inquiries about Palestine Syndrome from other
sections of the country. The federal Centers for Disease Control
are investigating, but there is no nationwide accounting of how
many people have the illness.
   Jundt prefers to call Palestine fever the STAR complex, an
acronym for its major symptoms: sore throat, temperature greater
than 100 degrees for seven days, arthritis in three different
joints and a hivelike rash.
   Symptoms have been reported in 149 people, including three
adults. Of those, 54 cases have been confirmed and 25 of them have
been recommended for aggressive blood sample studies by the state
health department and the CDC.
   Most of the confirmed cases have been in children under age 15.
But some have been in women in their 20s and 30s. So far no cases
have been confirmed in adult males.
   The illness does not appear to be contagious.
   Doctors are testing bodily secretions, including saliva, urine
and nasal secretions taken from the 25 patients in hopes of
isolating viral particles that could help identify other viruses
that might be associated with the syndrome.
   Five of the 25 patients in the survey group tested positive for
the rubella virus and two were positive for parvo virus, which is
commonly associated with puppies but causes arthritis, Jundt said.
   Like the progression of the syndrome itself, the recovery period
is variable, he said. Once the virus runs its course, recurrent
episodes are considered unlikely, although there have been
exceptions.

<HEAD>Cease-Fire Allows Red Cross to Remove Bodies In Battle Zone</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A cease-fire took hold Friday between
rival Shiite Moslem militiamen, and Red Cross workers collected 60
corpses from a south Lebanon battle zone.
   Also Friday, the Amal militia held a mass funeral in the
southern port city of Tyre for eight Shiites killed in a car bomb
explosion Thursday. No one claimed responsibility for the blast.
   Convoys of the International Committee of the Red Cross moved
into the villages of Jarjou, Ein Qana and Kfar Milki in Iqlim
al-Tuffah, or the Apple Province, at midafternoon to collect
corpses left after fierce fighting.
   A Red Cross statement said that during the operation no shots
were fired by militiamen of the fundamentalist Hezbollah, or Party
of God, and the more secular Amal, which is Arabic for hope.
   Police said the 60 dead already had been included in the overall
casualty toll, which stood at 189 killed and 570 wounded since the
current round of fighting between the two factions broke out July
16.
   Amal, which is allied with Syria, and the Iranian-backed
Hezbollah have been fighting on and off for three years for control
of Lebanon's 1.2 million Shiites, the country's largest sect.
   At least 1,049 people have been killed and nearly 3,150 wounded
in the power struggle.
   The Red Cross did not say whether any new operations would be
mounted in the Apple Province, which covers 50 square miles of
rocky highlands near Israel's security enclave in south Lebanon.

   Former President Reagan sent his regards Friday
to a 12-year-old Brooklyn boy who was set on fire by a bully
earlier this year.
   ``Please know that you're still in our thoughts and prayers,''
Reagan said in a taped message to David Opont that was broadcast on
``CBS This Morning.''
   ``Thank you _ a lot,'' Opont replied emphatically.
   The appearance marked Opont's first interview since he was
released June 8 from Jamaica Hospital in Queens.
   He was given a 50-50 chance of survival after he was attacked on
his way to school March 7. During his hospitalization, which
included six skin grafts and intensive physical therapy, he
received cards, letters, gifts and good wishes from around the
nation.
   Reagan was among his hospital room visitors. Opont was asked
what Reagan's visit had meant to him. ``Everything,'' he replied.
   Although Opont still undergoes therapy, ``He's coming along
quite nicely,'' said Dr. Craig Rosenberg, director of
rehabilitation medicine at Jamaica. ``He's an extremely courageous
person.''

   Screenwriter Bruce Joel Rubin remembers
dreaming that he would be able to stay in Indiana and still have a
successful Hollywood film career.
   Those hometown hopes are gone now, but Rubin is thrilled with
the success of his critically acclaimed film, Paramount Pictures'
``Ghost,'' and the direction of his career.
   ``I would have loved to have made films in Bloomington,'' he
reflected from his Southern California office this week. ``When I
first went out there I had some hopes I could write material from
Indiana and ship it off to Hollywood and people would send me
checks.''
   Rubin came to Bloomington in 1974 to be part of the Ashram
spiritual center. It was there that he wrote his first screenplay,
which later became ``Brainstorm,'' Natalie Wood's last film.
   ``When `Brainstorm' premiered out here I had lunch one day with
(director) Brian DePalma. He told me, `If you want to make it out
here, you have to come here.'''
   Rubin followed the advice.
   ``Happiness is a relative thing,'' he mused. ``It's just too bad
there's no perfect, ideal arrangement for everybody. You just have
to trust something deep inside and have the courage to follow it
where it leads.''

   When chef David Bouley got the word that his
restaurant had been awarded four stars by The New York Times, he
celebrated with an after-midnight, five-course meal for his staff
of 60.
   There was lots of champagne and singing, Bouley said Friday. For
desert, the pastry chef, Peter Sioti, turned out a delectable
chocolate souffle, fittingly topped with four candles.
   Bouley, whose restaurant in the trendy Tribeca neighborhood
bears his name, learned of the award late Thursday from early
editions of Friday's newspaper. He called it ``a dream come true.''
   Times restaurant critic Bryan Miller elevated Bouley from two to
four-star status. David Bouley's ``potential for greatness has been
realized,'' he wrote in his review.
   The chef describes his food as French-inspired but heavily
influenced by American tastes and regional products. ``I don't use
cream or butter in sauces,'' explained Bouley, 37, whose French
parents raised him in Storrs, Conn.
   A five-course fixed-price lunch is $32; the fixed-price dinner
is $65.
   New York City now has six restaurants that have been awarded the
coveted four stars by the Times: Bouley, The Quilted Giraffe,
Lafayette, Le Cirque, Le Bernardin and Lutece.

   Retired businessman Edward Piszek,
who spends most of his time promoting Polish causes, has been
playing host to the 17-year-old son of Poland's Lech Walesa.
   Included was a fishing trip to Alaska's Kenai River last week.
   Slawek Walesa caught his first American fish, a 45-pound king
salmon, and said it was ``the most exciting time of his life.'' He
posed for a photograph with his catch like any other happy
teen-ager.
   No one else in the party caught anything, Piszek reported.
   ``I was just lucky,'' said young Walesa, now winding up his U.S.
visit at Piszek's home in Miami Shores, Fla., where he is enjoying
the beach prior to returning to Poland next week.
   Piszek, whose primary residence is Fort Washington, is the
former owner of Mrs. Paul's Kitchens, which produce fish products.
Besides his strong ties to Poland, he also is a friend of Pope John
Paul II.

   The United States on Friday demanded that Iraq
provide immediate information about the fate of 14 American oil
workers missing from Kuwait and believed to have been rounded up by
Iraqi troops.
   U.S. officials were also trying to confirm rumors that other
Americans might have been picked up by Iraqi troops who invaded
Kuwait in the pre-dawn hours Thursday, said one official.
   A U.S. diplomat in Baghdad went to the foreign ministry and
presented a list of the 14, the companies they worked for, and the
three sites from which they were taken on Thursday when Iraqi
troops invaded Kuwait, said a U.S. official.
   The diplomat asked that Iraq account for the 14 ``as soon as
possible on an immediate basis,'' said State Department spokesman
Richard Boucher.
   The U.S. diplomat in Baghdad reminded the Iraqis ``of their
commitment to safeguard the safety of Americans,'' said Boucher.
The commitment was given to U.S. diplomats in Baghdad during the
early hours of the invasion, Boucher said.
   In Washington, Assistant Secretary of State John Kelly summoned
Iraq's ambassador to demand an accounting of the missing Americans,
said an official who asked not to be named.
   As he left the short meeting, Ambassador Mohamed Sadiq al-Mashat
denied his country was holding any Americans. Pressed about reports
of Americans being seized, al-Mashat answered, ``This is again one
of your rumors which has no basis whatsoever.''
   However, Boucher said that ``we can't confirm they're in Iraqi
control but we believe they are.''
   The U.S. Embassy in Kuwait has been in touch with many of the
3,000 Americans estimated to be in the country, and the U.S.
Embassy in Baghdad has contacted the 500 Americans believed to be
in Iraq, Boucher said. Americans in both countries were being
advised to leave as soon as they could, he said.
   For some, it was unclear when that might be. The airport in
Kuwait was rendered inoperational by Iraqi bombing and Iraqi troops
had closed off roads leading from the country, said another
official.
   Neighboring Saudi Arabia has promised to allow free entry to any
Americans able to flee Kuwait, the official said.
   The administration, citing privacy laws, has refused to provide
the names of the missing or the companies for which they work.
   But John Mika, vice president of the Santa Fe International
Corp. in Alhambra, Calif., said the company had been informed that
eight of its employees were ``detained by Iraqi troops. Of the
eight employees, six are Americans, one British and one is
Canadian.'' He declined to elaborate.
   Doris Whatley of Shreveport, La., said she received a call from
Santa Fe telling her that her husband, Donald, was missing. He had
been working as a drilling supervisor in Kuwait, she said.
   ``They took him from his rig this morning and they took him
across the border (to Iraq),'' she said Thursday.
   In Gilmer, Texas, the family of Charles Amos, 56, said he was
among those rounded up by Iraqi soldiers. Amos also works for Santa
Fe, the family said.
   ``We were set to have a family reunion this weekend, and Dad was
going to fly out of Kuwait'' early Thursday morning, said his
daughter, Karen Amos.
   An American woman who fled Kuwait to Saudi Arabia confirmed that
Whatley and Amos were among six Americans taken by Iraqi troops
from the Ahmadi oil town where her husband worked.
   The woman, Elizabeth Thames of Glenrock, Pa., identified the
others as Rainard L. Walterscheid of Dallas, Texas; Gary Carr and
Bobby G. Parker, hometowns unknown; and B.J. Tinch, originally from
Nashville, Tenn. and now living in Britain.
   Thames quoted oil field superintendent Ibrahim Mustah as telling
her that before the six were taken, Iraqi jets shelled their
facility.
   ``They were terrified and the camp where the workers were was
ransacked by tank-borne troops who took food, blankets, water,
anything they could find,'' she quoted him as telling her.
   ``The six were grabbed and taken to Iraq as far as he knew, but
the Iraqis left the rest of the group, who were Arabs, completely
alone,'' she said.
   Thames spoke by telephone to The Associated Press after reaching
Saudi Arabia with her husband and son.

   Buffalo's financially strapped symphony
orchestra is getting some help from musicians who don't play Mozart
or Bach.
   Fat Brat, Only Humen and Wile E. Rokks are among the six local
rock groups playing at ``Rock for the Symphony II'' Monday night to
raise money for the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra, which has a
$2.2 million deficit.
   A similar event in February raised about $1,000 for the
orchestra, said spokesman Steve Paschang. ``Not a significant
amount, but in our condition, we'll take anything.''
   The orchestra has missed its payroll several times and canceled
the last eight concerts of the season to save money.
   Its musicians have been asked to take pay cuts until a $20
million fund-raising drive is complete.

   Police arrested the rap duo ``Kid 'n Play''
for ``simulating sex'' during a performance.
   Christopher L.``Play'' Martin, 28, and Christopher P.``Kid''
Reid, 26, were freed after each paid a $550 fine.
   Reid called the offending motions Thursday night ``a little
extra gyration stuff _ nothing offensive, we thought.''
   They were arrested after performing at the Augusta-Richmond
County Civic Center, police said.
   ``Kid 'n Play'' was one of the openers for a concert featuring
the rap group ``Public Enemy.''
   No other rappers on the bill were arrested and no fans were
involved in the ``simulated sex,'' police said.

<HEAD>Soviet, Norwegian Border Guards Have First Soccer Match</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OSLO, Norway (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Norwegian troops watched Soviet soldiers
march across the heavily-guarded frontier into this NATO-country
Friday, but the only shots fired by either side were at a soccer
goal.
   In the spirit of glasnost, the Norwegians invited the Soviets to
cross the border, closed to them for 46 years, for a friendly
soccer game in the arctic border village of Kirkenes, Norway. Not a
goal was scored in the match.
   ``We wanted to ease the tension a little bit,'' said Norwegian
border commissioner Hugo Overgaard.
   The opposing soldiers, mainly young conscripts, usually scowl
and grab for weapons upon sighting each other anywhere along the
120-mile fenced frontier in the far north.
   This summer was marked by border incidents, including Soviet
troops chasing and shooting at fishermen in Norwegian territory.
   The tensions seemed to fade when the uniformed soldiers met on
the border, slapped each other's backs and exchanged smiles and
addresses, reported the Norwegian news agency NTB.
   ``This is the high point of my military service,'' said border
guard Igor Gerasimov, one of 11 Soviet players. ``I hope the border
can be even more open in the future,'' he told NTB.
   The Norwegian and Soviet troops marched into Kirkenes, a 15
minute walk from the border, to look around before the game.
   ``It's small but interesting,'' said Gerasimov. ``There are so
many products for sale.'' The 19-year-old soldier returned to base
with the other Soviets after the game.
   ``Everything went great. To be honest, the thing I worried most
about was the game's final score. Something like 9-0 would have
been terrible,'' the border commissioner said. The game ended in a
perfect zero-zero tie, he said.
   The game won't change much on the border, however, he said.
   ``The soldiers still won't be allowed to talk or wave at each
other,'' Overgaard said. ``But they can smile.''

<TEXT>
   Aardu the wallaby, on the lam for 11
days, was back in his cage at the Stone Zoo on Friday after
zookeepers lured him home with a hint of female companionship.
   Zoo officials found Aardu at about 7:30 a.m., trapped in a cage
in a nearby wooded area that they had baited with straw carrying
the scent of female wallabies. Back at the zoo, the small cousin of
the kangaroo was sound asleep when about 20 reporters appeared at
his cage for a news conference.
   ``I think he had a lot of food but he certainly wasn't happy
being alone, especially without females,'' said Mark Goldstein,
executive director of Metro Parks Zoos, which operates the zoo in
this northern suburb of Boston.
   Aardu bounded out of his cage July 23 and headed for the
Middlesex Fells, a 3,000-acre wooded preserve nearby. Zoo officials
said the 18-month-old Aardu, a hardy vegetarian, could have
survived for months in the woods if necessary.
   Whether he will survive state budget cuts is another matter. The
zoo is due to close in April 1991. Ilyas Bhatti, commissioner of
the Metropolitan District Commission, said it was unclear whether
Aardu could be transferred to another zoo.
   State Rep. Paul Casey said he was worried Aardu might be put to
death.
   ``If that's the case I'd rather Aardu had remained free,'' Casey
said. ``At least he has a fighting chance out in the fells.''
   Goldstein said officials were exploring the possibility of
keeping the zoo operating by making it a non-profit organization.

<HEAD>Iraqi Troops to Begin Withdrawing From Kuwait Sunday</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq said today its troops will begin
withdrawing from Kuwait in two days, Baghdad Radio announced.
   An Iraqi government spokesman said all Iraqi troops in Kuwait
will be withdrawn according to a timetable, beginning Sunday, said
the radio broadcast monitored in Cyprus.
   In Amman, Jordan, a senior Iraqi diplomat said: ``We believe
that the national government in Kuwait can take over all the
responsibilities now and they are capable of defending their
national security.''
   The broadcast, which was also carried by a station calling
itself the Provisional Government of Kuwait Radio, said the
Al-Sabah royal family that ruled Kuwait for almost 250 years will
never return to power.
   ``The bygone regime is finished forever and will never come
back,'' the spokesman said.
   Iraq said it sent its troops into Kuwait Thursday to provide
security for the provisional government and would withdraw when the
situation stabilized.
   The international diplomatic community scorned the claim. The
British ambassador to the United Nations accused Baghdad of setting
up a puppet regime in Kuwait.
   Earlier today, an Iraqi missile slammed into Saudi Arabia and
thousands of Iraqi troops pushed to within a few miles of the Saudi
border, heightening world concerns that their invasion would not
stop in Kuwait.
   Iraq's invasion followed two weeks of threats and accusations
against its small Persian Gulf neighbor. On July 17 Saddam accused
Kuwait of stealing oil from a field that includes land both sides
claim.
   Saddam also blamed Kuwait for a fall in oil prices, saying it
contributed to the oil glut by cheating on its OPEC production
quotas.
   Details from Kuwait today were sketchy. Public communication was
severed and a radio station opposed to the invasion was knocked off
the air. Its last message was a desperate appeal from Kuwait for
fellow Arabs to ``rush, rush to their help.''

<HEAD>Cult Member Pleads Guilty In Slaying Of Five</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PAINESVILLE, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A religious cult member who sat in on
meetings where the ritual murder of a five-member family was
discussed pleaded guilty Friday to conspiracy to commit aggravated
murder.
   Susan Luff, 31, told Common Pleas Court Judge James Jackson that
she should have told authorities about cult leader Jeffrey
Lundgren's plan to kill Dennis and Cheryl Avery and their three
daughters.
   ``It was morally and legally wrong'' not to do so, she said.
   At the pre-trial hearing, Ms. Luff said she was present at
scripture meetings where Lundgren discussed killing the Avery
family.
   Mrs. Luff was among 13 members arrested in January for the 1989
murders. The bodies of the victims were buried under a barn at a
farm in Kirtland, about 30 miles from Cleveland, where the cult
members lived commune-style. All five had been bound with duct
tape, gagged and shot.
   The Averys were considered less steadfast in their support of
Lundgren's beliefs, prosecutors say, and may have been killed as a
sacrifice before the cult members left the Kirtland area in April
1989 for a wilderness trek in West Virginia.
   Jeffrey Lundgren, 40, who prosecutors allege shot the Averys,
could get the death penalty if convicted at his trial, set for Aug.
13.
   Prosecutors said they would drop five counts of complicity to
commit aggravated murder and five counts of kidnapping once Ms.
Luff has cooperated in other cases. No sentencing date was set on
the five counts against Ms. Luff, who could face life in prison.
   Her 30-year-old husband, Ronald Luff, is charged with aggravated
murder and kidnapping.
   Alice Lundgren, 39, the cult leader's wife, was convicted
Wednesday on five counts each of complicity and conspiracy to
commit aggravated murder and five counts of kidnapping. She faces
life in prison.
   Four other cult members have entered guilty pleas on various
charges.
   Lundgren, a defrocked lay minister from the Reorganized Church
of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, formed his own group in 1988.

adjustment, the fifth consecutive decline and a reflection of
continued weakness in the housing market. Construction jobs are
more than 100,000 below the level of last fall, the government said.
   The nation's manufacturing slump also continued in July, as
factory payrolls fell by 7,000 jobs. It was the 15th time in 16
months that manufacturing jobs declined. Since reaching a
post-recession peak in March 1989, nearly 350,000 factory jobs have
been lost.
   Health services, which had added an average of 50,000 jobs each
month in the first half of this year, expanded by only half that
amount in July, adding 25,000 new jobs.
   Labor costs continued to increase. Average hourly earnings
posted a 0.6 percent rise in July to $10.09, up from the $10.03 the
average worker earned per hour in June.
   Overall, total civilian employment was about 118 million in
July, down from the 118.4 million employed in June. The jobless
numbered 6.8 million, up from 6.4 million employed in June.
   Last month's big jump in unemployment was a major departure from
the steady nature of the jobless rate over the past two years.
Before July, the jobless rate had fluctuated within a tenth of a
percentage point of 5.3 percent since September 1988. The only
exception was March of last year, when it hit a 15-year low of 5
percent.

the yuppie ensemble show ``thirtysomething,'' has settled a dispute
with the makers of the ABC series and will return to work, the
studio said Friday.
   The announcement by David Gerber, chairman of the MGM-UA
Television Production Group, came two days after his company sued
Busfield in Los Angeles Superior Court. The suit alleged breach of
contract and said that the actor, who wanted a raise, had
threatened to boycott the show.
   The suit said Busfield wanted $36,375 an episode, while MGM-UA
had offered him $28,750 per episode. The acclaimed ABC series
chronicles the lives of a group of young urban professionals as
they marry, separate, have children of their own and deal with
death and disease.
   ``There will be no further comment,'' said MGM-UA spokeswoman
Lori Gerson when asked if the company's lawsuit was dropped.
Production of the series' fourth season began Friday in Los Angeles.
   Busfield was nominated Thursday for an Emmy award for his
portrayal of the advertising executive whose wife's battle with
ovarian cancer is expected to be a key part of the show's coming
season.
   He recently wrapped up a co-starring role in Broadway's ``A Few
Good Men.''

<HEAD>Drug Warehouse Discovered; Linked to Drug-Smuggling Tunnel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NOGALES, Mexico (AP) </DATELINE>

   An underground warehouse raided by
Mexican police may have been used to store drugs later smuggled
into Arizona through an elaborate tunnel, authorities said.
   Like the tunnel, the warehouse was concealed beneath rooms that
could be raised by sophisticated hydraulic lifts, Mexican federal
police said. Police seized 5{ tons of marijuana in the raid Sunday,
but men guarding the cache escaped.
   The tunnel, which linked Agua Prieta, Mexico, and Douglas,
Ariz., was discovered in May. Authorities said it was used to
smuggle cocaine and marijuana.
   Nogales, a border town, is about 80 miles west of Agua Prieta.
   About 15 agents were met with gunfire during the raid, but no
one was wounded, Mario Alberto Torrijos, head of the Nogales office
of the Federal Judicial Police, said Thursday.
   The tunnel and warehouses _ including a similar one found
recently in Guadalajara _ are probably linked, Mexican police said.
Drugs may have been stored in the Nogales warehouse before being
smuggled through the tunnel, they said.
   The hydraulic system in Nogales, the first one discovered here,
was more sophisticated than in the tunnel, Torrijos said.
   ``We were at the Agua Prieta tunnel, and when the covers were
down, you could still smell the drugs,'' he said. ``When we close
this chamber, it is so hermetically sealed you can't smell the
marijuana.''
   A small office, which could be lifted about six feet, sat atop
two underground rooms, one 22 feet by 22 feet and the other 22 feet
by 36 feet, police said.
   The movable office was next to a 10,000-square-foot paper plant,
with the whole complex surrounded by a concrete block wall. The
large warehouse contained several hundred rolls of toilet paper,
but no drugs, said Torrijos.
   Agents found 5{ tons of marijuana wrapped in 601 plastic
packages in one of the underground rooms, said Mario Torrijos
Rascon, police group chief in Nogales.
   Police also seized three shotguns, four automatic weapons, two
silencers, two rifles and a radio transmitter, he said.
   In Mexico City, the attorney general said in a statement that
two Agua Prieta men were arrested in the case and an American and
another Mexican were being sought. It was unclear, however, whether
they were the escaped guards.
   The underground cache sat on the four-acre Rios Paper
Distributing Co. site in Nogales' Casas Palenque neighborhood, a
residential and industrial area.
   Torrijos said investigators were trying to determine who owned
the property.
   An informant's tip led police to the stash, he said.

<HEAD>Coast Guard Officials Say More Oil Missing From Barge</HEAD>

   Coast Guard officials said Friday a barge
that collided with a tanker in the Houston Ship Channel may have
spilled 700,000 gallons, or nearly all of its cargo, into Galveston
Bay.
   The Coast Guard had said earlier that 500,000 gallons of oil
spewed into the bay after the accident. But officials considered
adjusting that estimate after salvage crews found nothing in a
once-submerged cargo tank they expected to contain about 200,000
gallons of oil.
   ``It looks like a lot of the oil may have escaped from it,''
Coast Guard Capt. Thomas Greene said.
   Greene said officials were rechecking ship manifests to
determine exactly how much oil was aboard the vessel.
   ``It could be close to 700,000 gallons (spilled), but I'm not
willing to say that yet. The total capacity of that barge was
750,000 gallons. They're telling us they had 716,000 gallons
actually on board,'' Greene said at a press conference at Eagle
Point, a real estate development where oil has washed ashore.
   The state health department, meanwhile, announced that a ban on
fishing in the bay, begun Thursday, would be partially lifted
Saturday in several areas apparently unaffected by the oil.
   The accident occurred a week ago when the Greek tanker Shinoussa
collided with two barges in the Houston Ship Channel, causing one
barge to nearly sink. Oil from both barges bubbled into the
seafood-rich bay, threatening sensitive marshes, birds and other
wildlife.
   The oil has washed ashore on several beaches. The latest was
Houston Point, a marshy area north of the leading edge of the
12-mile oil slick, where oil was reported Friday morning.
   Coast Guard officials say they are perplexed by what appeared to
be relatively small amounts of oil spotted on flyovers this week.
   While part of the oil may have evaporated, Greene said another
possibility is that some sank just below the surface. Tests have
shown no evidence that the oil has reached the bottom, he said.
   Cleanup crews continued scooping oil off the surface Friday,
while salvage team worked on the damaged barge.
   Oil-eating microbes were poured into a small marshy area near
Pelican Island, adjacent to Galveston Island, on Thursday
afternoon. There was no word Friday on whether the microbes were
gobbling up the oil as intended.
   The spill has halted traffic in the Houston Ship Channel for
most of the week. Limited traffic was allowed Friday morning after
the damaged barge was lifted out of the channel into shallower
waters in the bay.
   ``It was not very far. They just had to get it to a slightly
more stable location,'' said Chief Warrant Officer Rick Meidt.
   One deep-draft ship was allowed out of the channel Friday
morning, in part to find out if a large ship's wake would further
damage the barge, Meidt said.
   The ship passed without incident and at least one other ship was
permitted to pass through the area.
   ``We're taking it slow and easy,'' Meidt said.
   Greene said that for the first time, officials were able to see
the damage on the ruptured barge and it is ``extensive.'' After the
Shinoussa struck the barge it appears to have plowed into the
center of it, he said.
   ``It's completely bashed in for probably 100 feet,'' Greene said.
   An investigative hearing into the accident resumed Friday
morning in Houston. The second mate of the Shinoussa testified the
tanker's pilot was ``racing'' before the accident, and then tried
to cover up how fast the ship was traveling. Later, he softened the
accusation, saying he had never been told to lie about the tanker's
speed.
   The pilot, Raymond Fincher, has denied speeding through the
channel.

   Jurors in Mayor Marion Barry's drug and
perjury trial spent their first full day of deliberations Friday in
the relative calm of the U.S. Courthouse after a wild drug sting at
their hotel the night before.
   Like a scene from a movie, there were helicopters, search dogs
and an escape car ramming police cruisers.
   The presiding judge in the Barry case said he was assured by
U.S. marshals that ``our jurors were oblivious'' to the sting, but
the mayor's lawyer still said he might ask for a mistrial in
connection with it.
   The Barry jury has been secretly staying at the hotel in
suburban Maryland for the past 6{ weeks. But reporters covering the
drug sting story and its aftermath discovered that the jury was
there, raising the possibility it would have to be moved.
   The jurors, meanwhile, said they would deliberate Saturday in an
effort to move toward a verdict as quickly as possible. They began
deliberation late Thursday.
   Barry is charged with 10 misdemeanor cocaine possession counts,
including one in connection with a hotel sting in which the FBI
videotaped him smoking from a crack cocaine pipe. He also faces
three perjury charges and a misdemeanor conspiracy charge.
   The mayor shrugged off questions about the trial Friday, saying
only, ``I feel fantastic.''
   He spoke to about 200 teen-agers at a youth forum, then returned
to his District Building office for a meeting with top staff
members and cabinet officials. It was the first time Barry visited
city hall without having to rush back to the federal courthouse
since jury selection in his trial began June 4.
   Thursday night's unconnected drug sting was aimed at Brian
Tribble, a former friend of the late University of Maryland
basketball star Len Bias who died in June 1986 of cocaine
poisoning, authorities said.
   Peter Gruden, special agent in charge of the federal Drug
Enforcement Administration's Washington field office, said he was
``pretty sure that it was not known'' by the DEA that the Barry
jury was sequestered at the hotel.
   Tribble was lured to the hotel to purchase cocaine but as
authorities moved in he fled, officials said. An associate was
taken into custody and faced arraignment on drug possession charges.
   Tribble drove off, rammed two police vehicles blocking his
escape, drove back to the hotel and fled into a wooded area, said
Prince George's County police, who were called in.
   Police brought in search dogs and helicopters equipped with
infrared lights to search the area but Tribble was still free
Friday.
   The District of Columbia Police Department also took part in the
sting operation, said Lt. Reginald Smith, who added that
information on where the jury was staying ``was only available on a
need to know basis.''
   The FBI also assisted in the operation.
   During a brief court session Friday, Barry lawyer R. Kenneth
Mundy said he wanted ``a representation on the record'' that the
jurors weren't made aware of the sting operation of the night
before.
   Jackson said he was assured they weren't aware of it.
   Mundy said someone would have had to ask them a question about
the sting in order to make the determination that they hadn't been
aware of it.
   ``They may have been aware there was a commotion,'' said Jackson.
   Mundy was asked later, outside court, whether he might ask for a
mistrial because of the incident. ``Yes,'' he said, without
elaboration.
   During the day Friday, the jury asked for complete sets of the
32-page instruction booklet read to them Thursday by U.S. District
Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson. Jurors also asked to see a
huge magnetic calendar in the courtroom on which the prosecution
listed the times Barry was accused of using drugs.
   Jackson also said he would allow the jury to return piecemeal
portions of the verdict, rather than waiting until it reached a
conclusion on all 14 charges.

<TEXT>
   Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall was
hospitalized for observation Friday after a fall the day before in
Chicago, a court spokeswoman said.
   Marshall, 82, was admitted to the National Naval Medical Center
in Bethesda, Md., where he was listed in stable condition, said
Toni House.
   She said Marshall, who was in Chicago to speak at the annual
convention of the American Bar Association, stumbled in the lobby
of his hotel Thursday evening.
   He flew back to Washington Friday ``because he prefers
consulting with physicians he knows,'' said House, adding it did
not appear he had broken any bones in the fall.
   She said Marshall does not plan to return to Chicago, where he
was scheduled to address a dinner of the ABA's Judicial
Administration Division Monday night.
   Marshall, a staunch liberal on the court, has had several health
problems in recent years. He had a heart attack in 1976 and has
suffered bouts of pneumonia and bronchitis.
   He was treated at the National Naval Medical Center in 1987 for
a blood clot in his right foot.

   Showers and thunderstorms produced heavy rains in parts of the
nation's midsection, raising river levels and bringing the threat
of flooding.
   A flood warning was posted Friday along Johnson Creek and the
north fork of the Guadalupe River above Kerrville, Texas. More than
four inches of rain fell overnight and several highways were closed
by flooding.
   There was also locally heavy rain during the night across parts
of Kansas. No flooding was reported but precautions were advised
because of rapidly rising rivers and streams.
   Rainshowers and thunderstorms continued during the afternoon
Friday, reaching from southeast Nebraska across eastern Kansas,
northern Oklahoma, parts of Arkansas, Missouri, southern and
central Iowa, and western Illinois.
   Showers and thunderstorms extended from eastern Wisconsin into
Michigan, over northern Mississippi, Louisiana, parts of Texas and
Florida.
   There were scattered showers over south-central New Mexico,
central Colorado, north-central Nebraska, north-central South
Dakota, eastern North Dakota and northern Minnesota.
   Rainshowers and thunderstorms also were scattered along the
South Carolina coast and from northwestern South Carolina into
east-central Georgia.
   The low temperature for the Lower 48 states Friday morning was
33 degrees at Gunnison, Colo.
   Portland, Maine set a new record of 90 degrees for the date.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 55 at
Arcata and Crescent City, Calif. to 100 at Needles, Calif.

<HEAD>Bad Testing And Faked Records Cloud Some Communities' Drinking
Water</HEAD>

   Drinking water in many small communities
violates federal health requirements and in some cases violations
are being hidden by improper tests or falsified records, a
congressional study concluded Friday.
   The General Accounting Office said an investigation of
compliance to drinking water standards at 75 community water
systems in six states showed many local authorities are not
complying with the federal requirements.
   The study also said that efforts by the Environmental Protection
Agency to uncover violations and take enforcement actions against
the local water officials frequently are ineffective.
   ``We found that many water systems, particularly smaller
systems, are violating requirements for monitoring water quality
and meeting drinking water standards,'' Richard Hembra, the GAO's
director for environmental issues, told a House Government
Operations subcommittee.
   The Environmental Protection Agency acknowledged problems with
getting small community water systems to comply with federal clean
water requirements.
   ``The small communities is where the biggest compliance problems
lie'' because of a shortage of money and technical people to
operate water systems, testified Lajuana Wilcher, the EPA's
assistant administrator for water issues.
   She also acknowledged that some violations of federal drinking
water standards go unreported because of erroneous information from
local officials or inadequate monitoring by states.
   Nevertheless, Ms. Wilcher maintained that said the most serious
violations have been resolved and in that available reports showed
that 73 percent of the community water systems, serving 183 million
people, were complying with federal health standards for drinking
water in 1989.
   According to the GAO report, however, those statistics may
overstate compliance nationwide.
   The GAO study said investigators found that local water
officials frequently test water samples incorrectly because
employees are not adequately trained to deal with increasingly
technical federal regulations.
   At other times, the GAO report said, samples are deliberately
falsified.
   ``While the extent of this problem is unknown, we found that
falsifying data and manipulating test results are relatively easy
to accomplish, and ample evidence exists that the practices are
occurring,'' Hembra told the House subcommittee on environment,
energy and natural resources.
   The GAO report cited examples where local water officials were
told to eliminate bacteria by boiling or microwaving water samples
before conducting tests. In other cases employees were told to
specifically search for samples that would pass a test, while in
yet other cases employees admitted they simply put false
information on reports.
   ``How much credence can you give these (compliance) figures
giving the GAO findings?'' Rep. Mike Synar, D-Okla., chairman of
the subcommittee, asked the EPA officials.
   ``Certainly not 100 percent,'' responded Ms. Wilcher.
   The GAO report examined water systems in Massachusetts, Vermont,
Oklahoma, Texas, Oregon and Washington. It did not identify the
individual communities.

   A 73-year-old political newcomer said he
was thinking of conceding the Republican Senate primary until he
learned Friday that the race was closer than he thought.
   ``I don't have too many fingernails left. I guess I'll have to
start chewing my toenails,'' candidate Ralph Brown said.
   It will be Monday at the earliest before Tennesseans learn who
won Thursday's GOP contest between Brown and conservative political
economist William Hawkins, who was leading by only 158 votes.
   Scattered precincts remain uncounted around the state, and in
one county _ Madison _ election officials said they wouldn't begin
counting statewide races until next week.
   Madison County officials said their ballot was extremely long,
and county races took priority over the Senate race.
   ``We're going to count it as soon as we can, but we've got every
county position except for tax assessor to count first,'' county
Registrar Spence Dupree said.
   With 96 percent of the state's precincts reporting, Hawkins had
50,979 votes to Brown's 50,821. Businessman Patrick Hales trailed
with 29,743 votes.
   The winner will face the Democratic incumbent, Sen. Albert Gore
Jr.
   State Election Coordinator Will Burns said the delays underline
the need for a statewide computerized election system.
   In other races, U.S. Rep. Harold Ford, the state's only black
congressman, defeated state Rep. Pam Gaia in a Democratic primary
despite the cloud of federal bank fraud charges hanging over his
head.
   Ford, 45, will face Republican Aaron C. Davis, a 79-year-old
political newcomer, in the general election.
   Dwight Henry, a freshman state legislator from Cookeville, beat
five opponents in the Republican gubernatorial primary after
returning to the race during the last week of the campaign.
   He will face the incumbent governor, Ned McWherter, who like
Gore received a large complimentary vote in an uncontested
Democratic primary.
   Brown, who estimated he had spent about $250 on his Senate
primary campaign, said he was told by a television station that
Hawkins had won Thursday's election.
   He said he was considering conceding when he learned at least 33
of 95 uncounted precincts would probably not be tabulated until
Monday.
   Hawkins, a 41-year-old former college professor, said he hadn't
expected the race to be so close and thought that some voters who
had not paid much attention voted for Brown because he came first
on the ballot.
   ``I wouldn't deny that,'' Brown said.

   An emergency Arab League Council Friday
issued a strongly worded statement, condeming Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait and demanding the immediate withdrawal of Iraqi troops.
   But a statement issued at the end of the two-day meeting said
the Arab League rejected foreign intervention in the crisis.
   Foreign Minister Esmat Abdel-Meguid said 14 of the League's 21
members voted for the condemnation, while one member abstained.
Sudan, Palestine, Jordan and Yemen voted against it, he said.
Libya's representative was not present and Iraq did not have the
right to vote, he said.
   In Iraq, Jordan's King Hussein met with President Sadaam
Hussein. The Jordanian leader announced there would be an emergency
Arab mini-summit in Saudi Arabia on Sunday to discuss the crisis.
   Although the United States, the Soviet Union and other Western
countries swiftly condemned Iraq and imposed sanctions on that
nation, most Arab countries said little or nothing about the
invasion until Friday.
   In its statement, the Arab League denounced the invasion and
said it ``rejects and does not recognize anything resulting from
it.''
   The statement, handed out to reporters at the end of a two-day
emergency meeting in Cairo, apparently meant that the League
continues to recognize Kuwait's Emir Sheik Jaber al-Ahmad al-Sabah
as the country's ruler.
   ``We condemn the bloodshed and the destruction of buildings and
we call on Iraq to immediately and unconditionally withdraw its
troops,'' the statement said.
   It also said the League ``rejects any foreign intervention or
attempted intervention in Arab affairs.''
   Egypt was the first major Arab country to condemn Thursday's
invasion.
   Egyptian government officials said neither President Hosni
Mubarak nor other Arab leaders believed Iraq's claim that it
intervened to help Kuwaiti revolutionaries. But they said the Arab
leaders initially held back criticism in hopes of containing the
crisis and preserving Arab unity.
   ``First, we demand that Iraq withdraw its forces from Kuwaiti
territories. Second, Iraq must stop trying to change the government
in Kuwait by force and leave such internal issues to Kuwaiti people
to decide by their own free will,'' said the Egyptian Foreign
Ministry statement on Friday.
   Egypt also called for the two countries to negotiate their
differences.
   The statement said the invasion could have ``dangerous
repercussions'' in the region but did not elaborate.
   Another group of Arab nations that includes Saudi Arabia later
issued a similar condemnation. The group, the Gulf Cooperation
Council, also includes Qatar, Oman, Bahrain, the United Arab
Emirates and Kuwait.
   ``We strongly condemn and are very sorry for this attack that
one Arab state took against another Arab state,'' the group's
statement said after its representatives met in Cairo.
   Several hundred Kuwaitis, stranded in Cairo by the invasion,
gathered in the lobby of the downtown Semiramis hotel where the
Arab League Council met.
   The Kuwaitis urged the Arab representatives to help their
country and carried pictures of the emir. He is believed to have
fled to Saudi Arabia.
   Palestine Liberation Organization chairman Yasser Arafat and
Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi met in Libya to discuss the crisis,
the Libyan News Agency reported.
   The agency said they decided Arafat would fly to Iraq in an
effort to settle the dispute.
   Also in Cairo, the Middle East News Agency quoted Iran's chief
delegate to the Organization of Islamic Conference, Hojatoleslam
Mohammad Ali Taskhiri, as condemning the Iraqi attack. He
reportedly said his country still recognizes the emir's government.
   Iran and Iraq fought an 8-year war that ended in a cease-fire in
1988, but they have not yet negotiated a long-term settlement.

<HEAD>Florida Man Comes Out Of Retirement To Earn Yale Degree At 85</HEAD>

   The time off that Daniel Wynkoop took
after his junior year at Yale stretched to nearly 65 years.
   But finally, at age 85, he's no longer a college dropout.
   At the start of Wynkoop's senior year, he was forced to leave
the school because he had gotten married over the summer _ the
summer of 1925.
   He could have returned the next year as a married student, but
ended up waiting more than 60 years to complete the seven credits
he needed for a Yale degree.
   ``I finally had the time and the money. I asked my brother (a
1928 Yale graduate) what I ought to do with it, and he said, `Why
don't you finish school.' So I did,'' said Wynkoop, a retired
encyclopedia salesman who lives in St. Petersburg, Fla.
   His three years at Yale qualified him as an alumnus, and he
attended reunions over the years with other Old Blues from the
Class of 1926. But Wynkoop wanted a degree.
   So he signed up for Yale summer school, completing five courses
over three summers, and was credited for a Spanish class he took at
St. Petersburg (Fla.) Junior College.
   A widower who was married three times, Wynkoop plans to
participate in graduation ceremonies next May with the Class of
1991. He has nine children and 25 grandchildren.
   Wynkoop, who checked out Friday from his dormitory at Calhoun
College, one of Yale's residential colleges, said he kept his nose
in the books during his second life at Yale.
   ``I had a nice couple of guys who said, `Do you want to go get a
couple of beers. I said, `No, I've been on the wagon since I came
here and I'll stay that way.''
   He broke the rule once, when a Yale administrator invited him to
lunch at Mory's, the storied Yale dining club.
   Most of the more than 1,000 students enrolled in Yale's Summer
and Special Programs are in the teens and early 20s. Wynkoop also
had to adjust to women students, who were first admitted in 1969.
   ``You know, those girls are not bad looking,'' he said, adding
that they would have distracted him his first time around.
   Wynkoop, who majored in English, took courses this summer on
detective stories and on radicalism since the 1960s, which was
difficult because ``that's a subject with which I have very little
sympathy.''
   An earlier philosophy course was his favorite.
   ``I had a peculiar position in the class,'' he said. ``Because
of my age, I had a different point of view on moral questions.''
   Wynkoop said he feels sorry for people who ask him why he
bothered going back to school.
   ``If they don't know, you can't tell them,'' he said. ``It's
because I want to drink deeper of the cup of life.''

   A mother and daughter died and
another child was hurled into the water when lightning apparently
struck a pond and traveled up their fishing lines, authorities said.
   The surviving child, the woman's 11-year-old niece, was found
wandering unharmed Wednesday along a street near Palm Beach
International Airport. The small pond is near the airport.
   ``The child doesn't remember anything, except crawling out of
the water,'' said Larry Easton, a county sheriff's detective.
   Barbara Buchanan, 31, of West Palm Beach, and her daughter,
Michelle, were found dead Wednesday night, he said.
   There were no burn marks on the victims' bodies, leading
deputies to believe lightning struck the water, traveled to shore
and electrocuted them, said sheriff's Lt. Marvin Lewis.
   Deputies cannot explain why the niece survived. Her name was not
released.
   A heavy thunderstorm struck the area Wednesday evening. Deputies
said the victims may have sought refuge under pine trees by the
pond. One fishing line still dangled in the water when firefighters
arrived.

<TEXT>
   Sen. Claiborne Pell, a 30-year Senate
veteran, and his election opponent faced off in their first
televised forum, with the incumbent Democrat suffering what he
later described as a self-inflicted wound.
   Appearing Wednesday on WJAR-TV with Rep. Claudine Schneider,
R-R.I., Pell hesitated when asked to identify the last legislation
he personally pushed that directly benefited Rhode Islanders.
   ``I couldn't give you a specific answer,'' he said. ``My
memory's not as good as it should be.''
   The station later reported that Pell explained he had been
trying to think of a bill that would affect only Rhode Island.
   Miss Schneider was asked to name the last bill that ``you've
sponsored and were the prime mover on that directly benefits Rhode
Island in some way.''
   The 10-year congresswoman had a quick answer: a bill regulating
and eventually banning garbage dumping at sea.
   ``My bill later became the committee bill,'' she said.
   But she acknowledged she was not the ``prime mover'' of the
bill. And the version she first sponsored was changed, in ways she
opposed, before it emerged from her ocean-related committee.
   ``In the House of Representatives, working with 434 other
people, there are no bills that have my name on them, because
that's just the way the system works,'' she said.

<HEAD>Report: Shiite Prisoners In Kuwait, Linked to Hostages, Are Free</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ABC News reported Friday that all of the 17
Shiite Moslems imprisoned for terrorism in Kuwait are now free
following the Iraqi invasion.
   Islamic Jihad, a Moslem group holding Western hostages in
Lebanon, has set the release of the 17 as a condition for freeing
its hostages. Two of the 17 had already been released after serving
five-year terms.
   In a report on ABC's World News Tonight, anchor Peter Jennings
said ``ABC's Pierre Salinger reports that as of tonight they are
all free.''
   ``Does this affect the fate of the American hostages? We don't
even know who freed the Kuwait prisoners,'' Jennings said.
   The report did not elaborate.
   Iraqi troops moved into Kuwait on Thursday. They are believed to
control almost all of Kuwait, and it was not clear from the ABC
report whether the imprisoned Moslems were now free of any
restrictions the Iraqis might impose.
   Kuwait had identified the prisoners as members of the
pro-Iranian Dawa party, an Iraqi group seeking to overthrow the
government of President Saddam Hussein. They were jailed for the
bombings of the U.S. and French embassies in Kuwait on Dec. 12,
1983, which killed five people and wounded 86.
   In Washington, John Dixon, a spokesman for the State Department
task force on the Iraq-Kuwait conflict, said the department was
aware of the ABC report but didn't know if the prisoners were free.
   Islamic Jihad, or Islamic Holy War, says it holds Terry A.
Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press,
kidnapped March 16, 1985, and Thomas Sutherland, acting dean of
agriculture at the American University of Beirut, abducted June 9
of that year. Anderson has been held the longest of all Western
hostages.
   Of the 15 prisoners believed held by Kuwait before the invasion,
three were under sentence of death. The others were serving
sentences ranging from 10 years to life in prison.
   Kuwait had refused to free any of of the prisoners.

   The Treasury Department said Friday night the
U.S. ban of Iraqi oil imports also covers Kuwaiti oil, now
controlled by Iraq.
   A Treasury statement said oil from both Iraq and Kuwait loaded
before President Bush's trade embargo against Iraq took effect may
be delivered in the United States.
   Also, Kuwaiti firms may use their blocked bank accounts,
Treasury said.
   Without elaborating on the inclusion of Kuwait, a Treasury
statement said ``importation of Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil will be
permitted'' where:
   _The cargoes were loaded before 5:01 a.m. EDT Thursday (12:01
p.m. Kuwait time), the effective time of Bush's import ban.
   _Are landed before 11:59 p.m. EDT Oct. 1.
   _The bill of lading was issued before Thursday's cutoff hour.
   _Remaining payments are reported to Treasury and made into a
bank account frozen by Bush's order.
   At least two cargoes of Iraqi oil could be affected by
Treasury's announcement.
   In Corpus Christi, Texas, the Customs Service impounded a
479,000-barrel cargo that arrived Thursday for a Coastal Corp.
refinery. Another tanker was in international waters off Port
Arthur, Texas, unable to complete its journey to a Fina Corp.
refinery.
   A similar exemption was made for cargoes in transit when a trade
embargo was imposed against Iran in 1979.
   Treasury spokesmen did not immediately answer their office
telephones. White House spokesman Doug Davidson said Bush had not
amended his executive order to cover Kuwait but had left
implementation of it and decisions on what is covered to Treasury.
   ``I would defer to Treasury on this,'' he said.
   U.S. banks will be permitted to pay checks and accept deposits
in blocked accounts controlled by Kuwaiti firms ``provided that no
benefit to the government of Iraq arises from transactions in the
blocked accounts,'' the statement said.
   Those firms will be required to register with Treasury's Office
of Foreign Assets Control, and the banks will be required to verify
the registration.
   On similar conditions, banks and investment companies managing
Kuwaiti-owned securities will be permitted to buy and sell and
re-invest the proceeds ``in assets subject to the jurisdiction in
(of) the United States,'' and foreign exchange deals for the
government of Kuwait begun before the cutoff hour may be completed.

   Soviet rescuers on Friday brought ashore
21 survivors of the wreck of a cargo ship, and the saved sailors
said they felt ``very lucky'' to have lived through Hurricane
Bertha.
   The Corazon broke into pieces Tuesday in the Atlantic Ocean
about 400 miles east of New York. Six of its crew died, and three
of the bodies were left at sea, said Elizabeth Brannan, a Coast
Guard spokeswoman from Boston.
   The Soviet captain said his crew fought 30-foot waves and heavy
winds to save the stricken sailors.
   ``What made the whole operation complicated was the wind and the
height of the waves, as well as the rainstorms, very little
visibility,'' said Vladimir Pushnoy, captain of the of the M-V
Leonid Leonidov.
   Crew members from the Corazon wore yellow vests that were hard
to see in the foamy water, Pushnoy said at a news conference Friday.
   After the rusty Soviet fishing boat docked in Portland Harbor
Friday afternoon, the Corazon's survivors, many of them from Greece
and the Philippines, stood on the deck and told their story to
reporters.
   ``We are very lucky,'' said Pantelis Potiris, of Greece, the
Corazon's cook. ``It was very bad, very rough.''
   One survivor gave a thumbs up sign and said ``the Russians are
good.''
   An apprentice officer, Rolando Arellano, of Manila, Philippines,
said he spent four to six hours floating in the water after his
life raft capsized. One of his countrymen died trying to get off
the Corazon, he said.
   ``When I jumped in the life raft, I found one Filipino
floating,'' Arellano said. ``He hit the ship's hull.''
   The dead included a first officer, a second officer, an
assistant officer and a radio man aboard the ship.
   ``I hope only to stay alive,'' Arellano said. ``I always pray to
God. We are thinking of our family and to save ourselves.''
   Arellano said he would return to the sea because it is the only
life he knows.
   After the Corazon sent out a distress signal Tuesday afternoon,
the U.S. and Canadian coast guards helped Leonid Leonidov and other
ships find the survivors.
   Two other ships in the area got close to Corazon crew members,
but couldn't get them aboard.
   Pushnoy said his fishing support ship was able to pull off the
rescue because his 46-member crew is used to working in open sea
and tying up with other vessels. The last man rescued had been in
the water 10 hours, he said.
   The Leonid Leonidov had been headed for the Gulf of Maine to
pick up fish being processed by another Soviet vessel, the Riga,
which is spending the summer off the Maine coast.
   The Corazon, a 593-foot freighter that was registered in Malta,
had been carrying tons of cement from Greece to New York.

   British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher, touring a Star Wars test site during an outbreak of war
in the Persian Gulf, said Friday the project had helped force
sweeping changes in the Soviet Union.
   Despite the thaw in superpower relations that some claim has
rendered the multibillion dollar Strategic Defense Initiative
irrelevant, Mrs. Thatcher said Iraq's invasion of Kuwait proved the
importance of a strong military.
   ``There will always be evil in human nature, and we never know
where it will come from,'' she said. ``We must always keep our
technology sharp.''
   Thatcher said SDI had forced Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev
to realize his army could not keep up with the United States
without draining the country's resources, she said.
   ``I believe it convinced the Soviet Union they can never achieve
their aim by military might because they knew they could never
succeed,'' she said.
   The SDI site, known as the National Test Bed, is developing
military space-based technology in the United States. Projects
under way would use lasers to shoot down enemy missiles in space
and incoming nuclear warheads.
   Thatcher told about 1,000 SDI workers she was amazed how far the
project had come since its inception in 1984 during the Reagan
administration.
   Among British contributions to the SDI program are filters that
can block Soviet attempts to jam military satellites with laser
beams and a neutron generator that can determine the payloads of
military missiles.
   Thatcher watched a display the ``Brilliant Pebbles'' project,
one of the most successful developments in the Star Wars arsenal.
The device fires rockets at incoming warheads.
   Star Wars, criticized from the start by some who say it is
unworkable, is under increasing scrutiny because of U.S. budget
constraints and warming superpower relations.
   Thatcher later toured Cheyenne Mountain, headquarters for NORAD,
which tracks Soviet Missiles, airplanes and submarines world wide.
   She also visited the National Center for Atmospheric Research in
Boulder, where scientists are studying global warming, an issue
that has been of special concern to Thatcher, who was trained as a
chemist.

   Iraq jammed short-wave radio broadcasts from
Voice of America on Friday, the agency's director said.
   Two of the six frequencies carrying Arabic-language broadcasts
to the Middle East were jammed at 5 p.m. EDT (Midnight in Kuwait),
said Richard Carlson, director of the U.S. government's overseas
radio broadcasting.
   The jamming signal, which sounds like someone blowing bubbles,
has electronic characteristics indicating it is Iraqi, Carlson said.
   The two jammed frequencies are broadcast from West Germany and
the island of Rhodes off the southwestern coast of Turkey and are
the most powerful frequencies beamed to the area, he said.
   Weaker Arabic signals and English-language broadcasts were not
affected, he said.
   However, ``The BBC has had indications they're being interfered
with as well,'' he said.
   Carlson said Iraqi President Saddam Hussein was ``trying to keep
his neighbors and his own people from knowing what is going on.''
   He said he did not know how much of the signal was getting
through to neighboring countries in the region.
   Iraq has not jammed VOA signals before, Carlson said.
   The only other country now jamming VOA is China, he said.

   President Bush's cutoff of Iraqi oil imports
is costing Iraq its No. 1 customer, but the sanction is unlikely to
take a lasting toll on Baghdad unless Japan and other major oil
importing countries join the embargo.
   Anything short of a concerted buyer boycott by the oil importing
nations would be little more than a temporary inconvenience for
Iraq.
   A solo American boycott would leave Iraq free to sell U.S.-bound
oil to Japan or another customer, although it might be forced to
take a slightly lower price in order to move the oil quickly in a
glutted world market.
   But the inconvenience could be felt as much by American oil
companies as by the Iraqi government. The embargo announced by Bush
Thursday following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait bars the import of
Iraqi oil, but it apparently does not stop American oil companies
from continuing to buy Iraqi oil and ship it to their non-American
affiliates, or simply swapping it on the world market.
   Among the major U.S. oil companies that buy Iraqi oil, Exxon
Corp., for example, could divert its Iraqi purchases to its Western
European affiliates for refining.
   The United States, among the dozens of countries which condemned
Iraq's takeover of Kuwait, on Friday was the only nation to have
barred imports of Iraqi oil, although European governments were
reported to be considering boycotts.
   Japan's Kyodo News Service reported Tokyo also was contemplating
a ban.
   Bush acknowledged the difficulty of making his sanctions work.
   ``I don't say they would work but we are putting them on
there,'' he told reporters before leaving the White House for a
weekend at his Camp David, Md. retreat.
   A Bush administration source said officials were considering
expanding the American action to include Kuwaiti oil, since it now
is under Iraqi control. The source, involved in round-the-clock
monitoring of the Persian Gulf crisis, discussed the
administration's thinking on condition he not be identified.
   Later, though, the Tresury Department issued a statement
exempting oil in transit from both Kuwait and Iran from the
president's embargo, thus including Kuwait. A White House spokesman
said the president had not amended his order, and was leaving it up
to Treasury as to precisely what was covered
   Of Kuwait's 1.8 million barrels a day of oil exports, about
120,000 barrels a day are bought by the United States. The rest
goes to Western Europe and the Far East.
   Kuwaiti oil expors ground to a halt shortly after the invasion,
although the Bush administration source said it appeared all
Kuwaiti oil facilities had escaped war damage.
   The U.S. market is more important to Iraq than is Iraqi oil to
America. The United States buys about 25 percent of Iraq's oil
exports, making it Baghdad's No. 1 customer.
   U.S. purchases from Iraq have soared in recent years, jumping
from about 100,000 barrels a day in 1987 to about 600,000 a day
last month. Even so, the Iraqi oil represents only about 3.5
percent of total American oil consumption and about 7.6 percent of
U.S. imports, according to the American Petroleum Institute.
   Although an international boycott of Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil would
seriously damage Baghdad's economy and set back its efforts to
rebuild following its costly 1980-88 war with Iran, the sanctions
may also carry a price for the rest of the world.
   The approximately 4.5 million barrels a day of combined Iraqi
and Kuwaiti oil exports, if removed from the world market, would
leave at least a temporary shortfall in global supplies that almost
certainly would drive up consumer prices.
   Henson Moore, the deputy secretary of energy, told reporters
Thursday evening that the administration was not worried about a
potential price rise resulting from a global boycott against Iraq.
   ``Should the oil from Iraq and Kuwait go off the market _ not be
sold to anybody _ there is enough excess (oil production) capacity
in the world to offset that loss,'' Moore said.
   It seems unlikely, however, that the countries with the most
unused production capacity _ mostly gulf Arab nations, including
Saudi Arabia _ would risk antagonizing Iraq by helping shield the
United States from a price increase.

   Customs agents seized 479,000
barrels of Iraqi crude oil from one tanker and blocked another
offshore, but both cargos apparently will be released since they
were bought before an embargo was announced.
   The Treasury Department said Friday that oil loaded before
President Bush announced a trade embargo Thursday against Iraq and
Kuwait may be delivered.
   Treasury spokesmen were not available to comment on specifics,
but the exception appeared to cover both the cargoes seized in
Texas.
   The Customs Service, along with the U.S. Coast Guard, seized the
oil at the Port of Corpus Christi on Thursday afternoon, hours
after President Bush's embargo went into effect at 5 a.m.
   The oil was being unloaded from the Hellespont Dignity, sailing
under a Swedish flag, at a Coastal Corp. refinery facility, said
Patricia McCauley, district Customs director in Houston.The cargo
had been unloaded at sea from a Norwegian mother ship, the Berge
Banker.
   That ship remained in the Gulf of Mexico outside U.S.
territorial waters, Ms. McCauley said.
   Another tanker, destined for a Fina Oil and Chemical Co.
refinery in Port Arthur, was halted offshore. A Customs spokeswoman
was unable to provide the name of that ship, its owners or its
registry.
   Fina was trying to persuade the government to let the company
take delivery, spokesman Rick Hagar said from the company's Dallas
headquarters Friday. Past embargoes affected only new shipments
made after the prohibitions took effect, he said.
   ``Crude oil that was on the water, already paid for, already
bought, was permitted into the United States. That's what we're
asking for in this case,'' he said.
   The Treasury announcement appeared to be an answer to Fina's
request. The Treasury statement said importation of Iraqi and
Kuwaiti oil would be permitted if the cargoes were loaded before
Thursday and landed by Oct. 1.
   Fina has refineries in Big Spring and Port Arthur and a terminal
in Corpus Christi.
   President Bush issued the embargo after Iraq invaded Kuwait
Thursday. The embargo covers Iraqi vessels and goods as well as
ships flying Iraqi or Kuwaiti flags. The order also prohibits
dealings between U.S. and Iraqi companies.
   In the past three months there have been 50 shipments of Iraqi
oil arriving in Houston, Ms. McCauley said.
   Some Iraqi goods in the Port of Houston also have been detained,
Ms. McCauley said. she did not elaborate. But very little ship
traffic is moving in or out of Houston because of an oil spill
cleanup in Galveston Bay.

   The United States asked the U.N. Security
Council on Friday to impose sweeping military, trade and economic
sanctions on Iraq for its invasion of Kuwait.
   U.S. Ambassador Thomas Pickering said the members of the
15-nation council expressed strong interest in applying
comprehensive mandatory sanctions.
   If approved, it would be the first time since 1967 that the
Security Council imposed such wide-ranging sanctions _ from arms to
trade _ upon a state.
   It was not known if the entire council was ready to approve such
penalties.
   ``I detect strong interest in sanctions ... and we will be
moving rapidly to discussion of a text ... A resolution could be
passed in 24 hours,'' Pickering said after council consultations.
   ``We want to put teeth into the Security Council's demand
Thursday that Iraq withdraw its troops from Kuwait,'' Pickering
said.
   The Council on Thursday condemned the invasion, demanded Iraq's
immediate and unconditional withdrawal, and called for urgent
negotiations between Iraq and Kuwait to resolve their differences.
   A U.S. government official, who later briefed reporters on
condition of anonymity, said the White House would press for
sanctions despite Iraq's announcement late Friday its soldiers
would begin leaving Kuwait on Sunday.
   He expressed skepticism about Iraq's announcement that it would
start a troop pullout.
   Consultations continued with the Security Council and other
nations in an effort to reach consensus on a resolution imposing
sanctions. The measures would be designed to punish Iraq and to
force it to withdraw completely and without conditions.
   The official said Washington may call for an emergency council
meeting this weekend, but said differences existed.
   Pickering told reporters that sanction efforts were not
incompatible with Arab League peace moves and that sanctions would
reinforce other settlement efforts.
   He said the United States proposed far-reaching, detailed
economic, financial and military sanctions _ ``anything you can
think of'' _ including an embargo on sales of arms, military
equipment, supplies and training.
   The U.S. official told the briefing that proposed sanctions
probably would cover pipeline exports of Iraqi oil by Saudi Arabia
and Turkey; removal of advisers and technicians from Iraq, and
severing of commercial airline links. He said a U.S. draft does not
mention freezing Iraqi or Kuwaiti assets abroad.
   Asked about Iraq's statement that Kuwait's royal family should
not return, the official said Iraq should leave Kuwait ``whole,
free, sovereign, intact and its government returned.''
   He said sanctions would be lifted if Iraq withdraws and the
status quo is restored.
   Pickering told reporters, ``Our (U.S.) view is that we should
move rapidly to sanctions if Iraq doesn't show _ and it hasn't _
signs of compliance.'' .
   The U.S. envoy said one or two members, not identified, had
reservations.
   Diplomats said China and Yemen, an Arab state, were not
supportive. China, as a permanent member, could veto the measure.
   The Security Council rarely imposes sanctions, but improved
U.S.-Soviet relations make them a possibility.
   The five permanent members with veto power are the United
States, Britain, China, France and the Soviet Union. Ambassadors of
the five have been consulting informally on strategy to end the
crisis.
   The Soviet Union was expected to concur, since Foreign Minister
Eduard A. Shevardnadze and Secretary of State James A. Baker III on
Friday issued a joint demand in Moscow for an arms embargo against
Iraq.
   Security Council resolutions are considered legally binding upon
its members, although they often are flouted.
   The U.N. Charter provides that the Security Council may call
upon members to impose sanctions, including economic sanctions and
interruption of travel and communications and severing diplomatic
relations.
   In extreme cases, the council may employ blockades and military
operations by the air, sea or land forces of U.N. members.
   It was believed only the fifth time in the council's 45 years
that it has issued such a threat of sanctions.
   The most recent case was the council action demanding a
cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war in 1987. Earlier times led to arms
embargos against formerly white-run Rhodesia in 1967 and South
Africa in 1977. There was also a warning about sanctions in the
first Arab-Israeli war in 1948.
   The last U.N. embargo came in 1967 on Rhodesia. It was lifted in
1979, as the former British colony prepared for independence and
majority rule as Zimbabwe.

<HEAD>Virginia Governor Says Scrutiny of Blacks Not Racism</HEAD>

   Virginia Gov. L. Douglas Wilder said Friday
that negative media focus on the private lives of black politicians
does not mean there is a white conspiracy against leading blacks.
   Recent stories, including those on the drug trial of Washington,
D.C., Mayor Marion Barry, only leave that impression, Wilder said.
   Wilder himself has been the focus of stories saying he has used
a state helicopter to spend weekends with socialite Patricia Kluge.
   ``If I thought that there was a conspiracy, I couldn't exist,''
Wilder said. ``I couldn't have existed in the courtroom where being
an African-American lawyer I was asking for justice from a jury
that was all white and judges who were all white, but I found
justice.''
   During his first six months in office, the nation's first black
elected governor has come under criticism for his busy travel
schedule and recently for his friendship with Mrs. Kluge, estranged
wife of America's richest man, John Kluge.
   The governor last winter appointed Mrs. Kluge, a former nude
model and high school dropout, to the board of visitors of the
University of Virginia.
   Wilder made his remarks at a news conference following a speech
to about 2,000 black journalists. The National Association of Black
Journalists is holding its annual convention at the Century Plaza
Hotel through Sunday.
   Wilder called for journalists to go beyond problems of the black
community and focus on problems that blacks and whites have in
common.
   ``We do the public a disservice _ we limit our perspective _ if
we think of ourselves as `black' officials or as `black'
journalists,'' he said.
   Problems like the savings and loan bailout, that will cost an
estimated $1.4 trillion, affect everyone, he said.
   ``Think of the inner city schools that could have been helped
with that money. Think of the prenatal health care, the resources
for the fight against drugs ... all lost forever,'' he said.
   Wilder called for blacks to unite and not to be pitted against
one another.
   He urged the journalists to bring good news of the black
community to the rest of the world.
   ``You and I know that there is a great deal of good in our
communities which goes unnoticed and unappreciated, simply because
the public is not made aware of it,'' he said.
   A study released at the beginning of the convention implies that
black journalists' influence is limited by their numbers.
   The study released at the conference by the American Society of
Newspaper Editors found that only 4 percent of reporters, editors,
artists and photographers in 1990 are minorities, said Denise
Johnson, vice president of the black journalists' association.
   The report also said that 4 percent of newspapers across the
United States employ only whites.
   Blacks make up about 12.3 percent of the population.
   ``America is browner and tanner and is going to continue to be
in the future and the industry must reflect that perspective and
diverse view of the world through the people it hires,'' Johnson
said.
   ``Most institutions in this country are still pretty much
dominated by white middle-age males and I think the tendency on
their part is to look out over the staff of people they direct and
take under their wing a person who reminds them of themselves,''
Johnson said.

   Witnesses and military
officials branded as a hoax on Friday reports that gunmen dragged
11 peasants from two families from their homes and killed them in
northeastern Morazan province.
   Reporters arriving in the Morazan town of Cacoapera talked with
several of the people supposedly killed, or with their relatives.
   ``There were no such assassinations,'' said Col. Oscar Leon
Linares at military headquarters in the provincial capital of San
Francisco Gotera.
   He said a woman traveled 10 miles from Cacoapera and told
authorities that six people were killed, then told a radio station
11 had died.
   At least one newspaper and several radio stations carried the
report Friday.
   The military also began an investigation based on the report of
the woman.
   Residents later described the woman as mentally disturbed.
   Morazan province is hotly contested between government forces
and guerrillas of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front. A
10-year-old civil war has killed about 72,000 people, most of them
civilians.

   President Bush warned Iraq on Friday not to
tamper with U.S. ``vital interests'' by trying to add oil-rich
Saudi Arabia to its conquest of Kuwait. He said the United States
was willing ``to help in any way we possibly can'' to stop Iraqi
aggression.
   The White House said all options, including military force, were
under consideration.
   The State Department said Iraqi troops, hardened by eight years
of war with Iran, were positioned 5 miles to 10 miles from the
Saudi border, and spokesman Richard Boucher said, ``Their presence
there clearly raises significant concern.''
   The United States buys 1.2 million barrels of oil a day from
Saudi Arabia, or about one-sixth of all American oil imports. Bush
said there is a short-term surplus of crude oil but that ``long-run
economic effects on the free world could be devastating'' if
supplies are curtailed.
   ``When you look at vital interests of the United States, the
relationship with Saudi Arabia and its independence and its freedom
come under the heading of very, very important,'' Bush said.
   ``If they ask for specific help, it depends on what it is, but
I'd be inclined to help in any way we possibly can,'' the president
told reporters as he left the White House for a weekend at Camp
David.
   At the United Nations, the U.S. delegate to the Security Council
proposed a sweeping program of international sanctions, described
by one official as ``anything you can think of.''
   An Iraqi government spokesman was reported by Baghdad Radio as
saying his nation's troops would begin withdrawing from Kuwait on
Sunday. But the broadcast also said the Al-Sabah royal family that
has ruled Kuwait for almost 250 years would never return to power.
   The White House appeared skeptical. ``We need to wait and see.
There are many questions associated with it,'' said presidential
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater. ``We asked for immediate and
unconditional withdrawal. If there are strings, we need to see what
they are.''
   Iraq said it sent its troops into Kuwait Thursday merely to
provide security for a provisional government _ a contention
dismissed in Washington and other Western capitals.
   A senior U.S. official aboard the plane of Secretary of State
James A. Baker III, speaking to reporters on condition that his
name not be used on the return from Moscow, said the invasion came
despite warnings from the United States against it. ``There was a
general warning ... at several different levels, including very
high levels,'' the official said.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley said an Iraqi invasion of Saudi
Arabia ``would call for a direct military response by the United
States, Western Europe, maybe even the Soviet Union. This would be
an action that could not be ignored.''
   House Armed Service Committee Chairman Les Aspin, D-Wis., said
bluntly, ``I think it means war'' if Iraq expands its invasion. ``I
say that not as a threat but as a prediction. The world cannot sit
back and watch a person like (Iraqi President) Saddam Hussein take
over half of the oil reserves in the world.''
   Bush said he viewed Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and the threat to
other Persian Gulf countries ``as a matter of grave concern to this
country and internationally as well. What Iraq has done violates
every norm of international law.''
   Asked what the United States would do if Iraq invades Saudi
Arabia, the president said, ``I'm not discussing options but I
would simply say the status quo is unacceptable and further
expansion would be even more unacceptable.''
   The Pentagon said a third U.S. aircraft carrier was being
readied to head to the Mideast to bolster U.S. forces already
scattered outside the Persian Gulf region. Officials said the USS
Saratoga would relieve the USS Eisenhower, which was deployed in
the Mideast in March.
   The aircraft carrier Independence already is headed from the
Indian Ocean toward the Persian Gulf to strengthen the eight-ship
U.S. Navy presence already there.
   Military sources said the Independence was ``several days'' from
reaching a staging area outside gulf waters. Pentagon sources said
it would be difficult for the United States to parry Iraq's drive
with a major assault of troops.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney met with Bush at the White House,
and the president was given ``a spectrum of options'' for military
action including offering war-fighting hardware to Kuwait's
neighbors as well as more aggressive moves such as a naval blockade
or tactical air strikes on Iraq, Pentagon sources said.
   With tensions rising, the State Department advised the 3,000
Americans in Kuwait and the 500 in Iraq to leave as quickly as
possible. In Kuwait, however, airports and ports were closed.
   Iraq also began jamming short-wave radio broadcasts from the
Voice of America on Friday, the agency said.
   The administration said 14 Americans were known missing and
believed to be in Iraqi hands. The United States demanded that they
be accounted for and freed, Fitzwater said.
   The Americans are oil workers who were taken from three
different oil fields near the Iraqi-Kuwait border, Boucher said.
   Fitzwater said the United States could not confirm reports that
Americans were being rounded up or held in various places.
   He said Iraqi troops have been stationed around the U.S. Embassy
in Kuwait ``but they have not gone inside. There is no indication
they intend to do that.''
   In the early hours of the invasion, which began before dawn
Thursday, Iraqi officials promised U.S. Embassy officials in
Baghdad that Americans would not be harmed, Boucher said. ``We
reminded them of their commitment to safeguard the safety of
Americans,'' he said.
   In an unprecedented step, the United States and Soviet Union
jointly demanded that all countries cut off arms supplies to Iraq.
The statement was issued in Moscow by Secretary of State James A.
Baker III and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze after a
hastily scheduled meeting.
   Shevardnadze, whose country has been Iraq's biggest arms
supplier, predicted that Baghdad soon would withdraw from Kuwait.
   Fitzwater said ``the actions of Iraq at this point indicate a
ruthlessness and disregard for international law that must make us
concerned about all the other countries in the region and their
security.''
   NATO sources in Brussels said the United States alerted Western
allies that it was prepared to respond should Iraqi troops push
beyond Kuwaiti territory.
   ``We have told them that we don't rule out any military option
and that everything is under consideration,'' Fitzwater said. ``We
are considering all options.''
   Bush spent 75 minutes with top advisers reviewing intelligence
on the Middle East and the progress in implementing economic
sanctions against Iraq, Fitzwater said.
   Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the United States, Prince Bandar,
met at the White House with Brent Scowcroft, the president's
national security adviser.
   Bush said he talked by telephone with Turkish President Turgut
Ozal, whose country is a conduit for much of the oil flowing out of
Iraq.
   Bush said that he and Ozal ``look at this matter with the same
sense or urgency and concern.'' Bush declined to say whether Ozal
had made a commitment to shut down the Iraqi pipeline but did say,
``That will be an option, I'm certain.''

   The Senate rebuffed an attempt Friday to cut
nearly four times as many U.S. troops from the U.S. military as
President Bush proposed to cut in his 1991 military budget.
   Despite arguments that the Cold War has ended and the United
States faces severe money problems, the Senate rejected an
amendment to cut 130,000 troops, including 80,000 in Europe. The
vote was 59-40.
   In proposing a $307 billion defense bill for the fiscal year
beginning Oct. 1, Bush called for about 40,000 troops to be cut
overall. The Senate Armed Services Committee adopted a $289 billion
military budget last month that would cut troop strength by
100,000, including 50,000 in Europe.
   The chairman of the Senate Armed Services panel, Sen. Sam Nunn,
D-Ga., warned that a deeper cut in the nation's 2.1 million
military personnel than the total adopted by his committee would
force the Pentagon to ``send out the pink slips.''
   In a speech on Thursday, Bush called for a 25 percent reduction
in troop strength over five years _ about 500,000 through 1995 _
but cautioned against drastic reductions in the nation's mlitary.
   Late Friday, the Senate agreed to consider five amendments on
the Strategic Defense Initiative on Saturday in hopes of completing
the legislation and adjourning for the summer recess.
   On other issues on the defense agenda, the Senate:
   _The Senate rejected, 54-43, an amendment imposing a one-year
moratorium on closing or realigning military bases on the list
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney proposed in January unless Congress
decides otherwise.
   Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark., angrily cited statistics from a
Democratic study showing that 99 percent of the 44,000 civilian
jobs that would be lost from Cheney's January list of potential
base closings were in Democratic congressional districts.
   ``You don't have to be a rocket scientist to know this didn't
happen by coincidence,'' Bumpers said of what he perceived as a
partisan list from Republican Cheney.
   But Sen. John Warner of Virginia, ranking GOP member on the
Armed Services panel, argued that Cheney has tried to ``defend his
action in cutting back military personnel and now we're about to
handcuff'' him.
   _Rejected an amendment to increase the pay raise for military
personnel included in the 1991 defense bill from 3.5 percent to 4.1
percent. The measure failed, 67-32.
   _Approved by voice vote a measure providing $5 million to
Washington, Oregon and Idaho for the creation of a registry to
monitor and notify individuals of the potential adverse effects of
radiation released from the Hanford Nuclear Reservation in Hanford,
Wash., from 1944 to 1972.
   Approval of the measure came in the midst of a flurry of
activity on the Senate floor in which 17 amendments were briefly
described and adopted by voice vote in a mere 21 minutes.
   _Rejected, 52-45, an amendment to freeze funds for the Army's
kinetic energy anti-satellite rocket program at this year's $74
million. In the new budget, Bush proposed a 181 percent increase to
$208 million for the program.
   _Turned down an attempt to mothball three of the Navy's four
battleships, one more than Bush has proposed in his fiscal 1991
budget and the total adopted by the House Armed Services Committee
in its $283 billion defense bill. The vote was 55-44.
   Lawmakers have questioned the necessity of maintaining the
1940-vintage vessels, especially since the gun turret explosion
last year aboard the USS Iowa that killed 47 sailors.
   Cheney has proposed retiring the USS Iowa and the USS New
Jersey. Bumpers proposed adding either the USS Missouri or the USS
Wisconsin to the list.
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., a former Navy pilot, said he doesn't
have to ``make the case for the battleship. Saddam Hussein has made
the case for the battleship,'' referring to the Iraqi leader who
engineered the invasion of Kuwait.
   Bumpers responded, ``Where are the four battleships we have? Are
they steaming to the Persian Gulf?''
   Nunn complained that the Navy had promised a ``new and
innovative'' use for the battleships when they were taken out of
mothballs several years ago.
   ``We've wasted an enormous amount of money with four and now
we're left with two and no innovative way to use them,'' Nunn said.
``The best solution is to cut one battleship.''
   In rushing to complete work on the defense bill before the
summer recess, the Senate also sidestepped a potentially volatile
fight by setting aside an amendment to allow abortions in military
hospitals for personnel and their dependents willing to pay for the
procedure.
   Sen. Timothy Wirth, D-Colo., chief sponsor of the provision,
withdrew his amendment after the Senate fell two votes short of
limiting debate.

   South Korean and Soviet officials held their first
formal talks Thursday aimed at normalizing relations, Foreign
Ministry spokesman Yuri Gremitskikh said.
   He told a regular news briefing the 20-member delegation from
Seoul was to discuss investment, joint business ventures and better
economic and technical cooperation.
   The Korean envoys will spend up to three days talking to
ministries and visiting Soviet businesses, cultural centers and
scientific establishments.
   South Korea and the Soviet Union agreed to limited consular
relations in December. Moscow has been a close ally of Communist
North Korea.
   Officials in Seoul have said the two countries may be able to
establish diplomatic relations and exchange ambassadors by the end

<HEAD>Study: Breast Feeding Enhances Immune System</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Breast-fed babies have more active immune systems
after one year than babies who have been fed formula, Canadian
researchers reported in the medical journal The Lancet.
   Researchers at the University of Alberta Department of
Pediatrics compared the immune response systems of 57 infants who
were breast-fed with those of 24 bottle-fed infants.
   The children were found through the Edmonton Board of Public
Health Clinics by Drs. Henry Pabst and Donald Spady. They were
given a vaccine for meningitis and severe pneumonia at two, four
and six months, according to the article in the current issue of
Lancet.
   The report said there were no significant differences in
measured antibody levels between the two groups before the age of
seven months.
   But after seven months, the antibody levels were significantly
higher in the breast-fed infants than the formula-fed babies, the
report said.
   ``These findings are strong evidence that breast-feeding
enhances the active immune response in the first year of life, and
therefore the feeding method must be taken into account in the
evaluation of vaccine studies in infants,'' the report said.
   Spady said Thursday that it is well known that breast-fed babies
are more healthy than formula-fed babies, but this is the first
study to show that their immune systems are stronger and more
efficient after several months.
   ``It demonstrates that the baby who is breast-fed is able to
mount a more effective immune response,'' Spady said in a telephone
interview.
   ``There is something in the milk that seems to stimulate their
immune systems to work more effectively,'' he said, adding that
further research will focus on what component of milk stimulates
the improved response.
   The report said breast-fed infants were changed to formula
feeding at an average age of 4 to 5 months, but Spady said some of
the breast-fed infants were weaned as early as one month.

   A couple who allegedly stole more than 100
prints by Audobon, Goya and other artists while working as
volunteers in the state art museum were arrested in Vermont, police
said Thursday.
   Michael Richard Moskaluk, 43, and Romona E. Arnold, 33, were
arrested Wednesday and held by the U.S. marshall in Burlington, Vt.
Louisiana authorities were seeking their extradition to face at
least 60 counts of felony theft.
   Moskaluk was arrested after allegedly trying to sell a dealer a
print by the John James Audubon, the 19th century artist and
naturalist. Although the print was not one of the stolen works, the
art dealer reported Moskaluk's offer to the FBI, and the tip led to
the arrest, said Sgt. G. Hamilton Mixon III.
   Moskaluk and Arnold worked as volunteers at the Presbytere
branch of the museum, in New Orleans' French Quarter. They
disappeared about two weeks ago as police were preparing to arrest
them.
   A search of Moskaluk's house revealed shipping receipts linking
him to the stolen art, police said.
   Moskaluk has five previous felony convictions, including ones
for art theft, police said.
   Police have recovered all 60 stolen Audubon prints but cannot
return them to the museum immediately because they're needed as
evidence, said Mixon.
   Forty-eight prints and illustrations by other artists also are
missing. They included two Goya prints; five lithographs by George
Catlin, a 19th century illustrator of Western Indians; and 19
scenes of Mexico or the Mexican War by Carlos Nebel. Some of those
works have yet to be traced.
   ``The sooner we send out the word that these things are back the
happier I'll be,'' said director James Sefcik. ``Whether we get
something back this week or not remains to be seen. I sure hope
so.''
   State police said much of the museum's art was sold through art
dealers in France, Canada, Chicago, Philadelphia and New York.
Officials said the prints brought as much as $2 million.
   The art dealers who purchased the works claimed not to know they
were stolen, and will not be charged, police said.
   The thefts were discovered about two months ago after an exhibit
of Audubon's drawings of Louisiana birds.
   The stolen Audubon prints were part of a complete set of 425
acquired by the museum 150 years ago, shortly after Audubon
finished the so-called elephant folio of prints 2 feet by 3 feet.

   Pennsylvania's abortion law is
constitutionally sound and should be upheld, a state attorney said
Thursday in closing arguments on a court challenge to the toughest
such statute in any state.
   An attorney representing a group of abortion clinics and doctors
opposed to the law countered that its restrictions would strip
women of dignity, potentially endanger their health and have a
chilling effect on doctors who perform abortions.
   ``There can be no doubt the challenged provisions burden women's
rights to abortion,'' said Thomas Zemaitis, a lawyer for the
clinics.
   The conflicting assessments came in closing arguments before
Senior U.S. District Judge Daniel H. Huyett III, who has been asked
to overturn key sections of the law on constitutional grounds.
   Pennsylvania's law is the most stringent on the books of any
state. Only Guam, a U.S. territory in the Pacific, has adopted more
stringent controls.
   The case has generated national interest because it might
eventually provide a way to challenge Roe vs. Wade, the landmark
1973 decision that established abortion as a constitutional right.
   Lawyers expect a ruling in about a month. Huyett has blocked
disputed sections of the law until he rules.
   Among the disputed provisions are requirements that women notify
their husbands if they want an abortion and wait 24 hours before
getting an abortion, and for minors to obtain the consent of at
least one parent, or a court order, before receiving an abortion.
   Some of the contested sections of the law are redrafted from a
1982 statute, much of which was struck down by the U.S. Supreme
Court in 1986.
   Senior Deputy Attorney General Kate L. Mershimer argued that
there had been important abortion rulings since the Roe case,
including a July 1989 Supreme Court decision in Webster vs.
Reproductive Health Sercives Inc., a Missouri case that gave states
greater leeway to restrict abortion.
   Ms. Mershimer made a point-by-point review of each disputed
section, prefacing her remarks by saying, ``We believe our law ...
remains constitutional.''
   Zemaitis said testimony had shown how the law would place undue
restrictions, controls that are far out of step with the Roe ruling.
   He said the provisions ``hardly promote an interest in women's
health; they harm women's health.''
   Zemaitis said the state was ``demeaning'' women by forcing them
to wait 24 hours for abortions, and suggested that the section was
written simply to discourage abortions.
   ``That's what this provision is all about: If we keep women tied
up 24 hours they'll change their minds,'' he said.
   Both Mershimer and Zemaitis have expressed confidence their side
would win.
   Most of the witnesses in the trial have been doctors or
psychologists. The trial has been largely devoid of the
emotionalism and protests that have typified the national debate
over abortion. The courtroom, with seating for about 15, was only
occasionally filled to capacity.

   The Avianca jet given emergency clearance to
land here this week was not dangerously low on fuel, preliminary
reports indicate.
   Air traffic controllers, mindful of January's fatal crash of a
fuel-starved Avianca jet approaching Kennedy Airport, declared a
fuel emergency on an Avianca jet Tuesday night although the plane's
crew said it was unnecessary.
   The crew aboard Avianca Flight 20 from Bogota, Colombia, told
air traffic controllers the plane had 15 minutes of fuel left when
it was about 30 miles south of Kennedy.
   The controllers put numerous other planes in a holding pattern
to give the Avianca jet a straight-in approach, and the Boeing 767
landed safely at 9:24 p.m., about 12 minutes after its crew radioed
the tower.
   Preliminary reports show the plane had at least 13,700 pounds of
fuel in its tanks when it landed, which would have kept it in the
air for about two hours, said Federal Aviation Administration
spokeswoman Diane Spitaliere.
   When the pilot told the control tower he had only 15 minutes of
fuel left, he was probably referring to the amount left before the
plane would have to start using its reserve fuel, said Spitaliere.
   International flights are required to carry enough reserve fuel
to reach an alternate airport plus 45 minutes for possible delays.
   The FAA was waiting for a report on exactly how much fuel the
plane had, she said.
   An Avianca Boeing 707 crashed Jan. 25 in a wooded area of Cove
Neck, on the approach to the airport, after the crew failed to
properly alert air traffic controllers that the plane was out of
fuel. The crash killed 73 people and injured 85.

   Reports of illness from shigella bacteria, which
causes acute diarrhea, nearly doubled in a two-year span, federal
health officials reported Thursday.
   Health officials isolated 10.1 cases of shigella per 100,000
people in the United States in 1988, up from 5.4 per 100,000 in
1986, the Centers for Disease Control said; 22,796 cases were
reported nationwide, the highest number since record-keeping began
in 1965.
   Major shigellosis outbreaks in recent years included 513
confirmed cases in Peoria County, Ill., in 1987, and 191 in
Kankakee County, Ill., in 1986-87.
   Shigella infection can cause severe diarrhea and other symptoms.
Poor hygiene can be a factor in transmission.

   Like clockwork, Big Ben's famous hands stopped for
the second day running Thursday at 5:20 p.m.
   This time, engineers were prepared. They quickly restarted the
hands manually on the four clock faces atop the 20-story tower
overlooking the Houses of Parliament.
   But engineers were still trying to figure out the reason for Big
Ben's fitful timekeeping.
   London's weather, a favorite complaint for natives, has been
unsually hot. Some residents suspect that to be the cause.
   On Wednesday, the clock stopped for about three hours before
workers brought it back to life.
   Big Ben is a 13{-ton bell that chimes out the hours from behind
the clock faces. Stoppages are rare for the 131-year-old clock
tower, which has survived pollution, bad weather and war.
   A plan to renovate the clock's hammer arm and chimes is expected
to be completed this month.

<TEXT>
   The state Supreme Court on Thursday upheld
a ruling that damage lawsuits against Boeing Co. from the 1985
crash of a Boeing 747 owned by Japan Air Lines should be heard by
Japanese courts.
   The JAL 747-SR slammed into a mountainside on a flight from
Tokyo to Osaka on Aug. 12, 1985, killing 520 of the 524 people
aboard.
   In 1987, King County Superior Court Judge Gary Little dismissed
the claims on condition that Boeing submit to jurisdiction in
Japan, waive any statute-of-limitations defenses, admit liability
for compensatory damages and accept the judgment on liability in
Japan.
   Little granted plaintiffs in the case the right to return to
Superior Court for trial on damages if ``the actions cannot be
handled expeditiously in Japan.''
   The lawsuits were filed against Boeing and JAL on behalf of the
estates of 78 victims, including 71 Japanese citizens.
   Before dismissing the damage claims, the trial court found that
Boeing had admitted botching part of its 1978 repairs on the aft
pressure bulkhead of the aircraft, which separates the pressurized
section of the plane from tail section. Boeing admitted its bungled
repair caused the crash.
   Attorneys for the plaintiffs appealed on technical grounds, and
argued that dismissal of the damage claims was fundamentally unfair.
   The high court confirmed the trial court's finding that the
plaintiffs would get an adequate hearing in Japan.
   ``Plaintiffs have not challenged this finding and, indeed,
concede that Japanese law provides full compensation,'' Justice
Barbara Durham wrote for the court.
   Durham said the trial court had found that virtually all of the
witnesses, documents and other evidence pertaining to the issue of
damages are in Japan, favoring trial there.
   Japanese courts tend to provide smaller rewards in damage
lawsuits.

   A judge on Thursday declined to stop a
shark hunt that opponents claimed would draw the carnivorous fish
toward shore, where they would threaten swimmers and surfers.
   A group filed a lawsuit Wednesday to obtain a temporary
restraining order against the Columbia River-Pacific Ocean Shark
Tournament scheduled for Friday and Saturday off the northern
Oregon coast.
   Clatsop County Circuit Judge Pat Dooley said he couldn't stop
the tournament on such short notice.
   Tournament opponents were troubled by plans to toss blood and
fish parts into the ocean to attract the sharks. Biologist Mark
Marks testified before Dooley that the practice could increase the
chance of an attack.
   ``It would increase the risk potential, however small it may
be,'' said Marks, a graduate student who studies shark behavior at
Humboldt State University in northern California. ``Undoubtedly,
this kind of behavior is not conducive to safe swimming.''
   Ron Miller of Long Beach, Wash., a charter boat operator who
helped organie the tournament, said, ``The whole thing has gotten
the media into a feeding frenzy. It's just a handful of guys going
out fishing.''
   Miller said about a dozen boats were expected to take part in
the hunt, and most of the fishing would be 60 to 100 miles offshore.
   The total purse for the competition is $80,000, including
$35,000 for the largest shark caught.
   Plans for the tournament drew opposition from area surfers,
windsurfers and jet skiers, the city council of Seaside about 20
miles south of the mouth of the Columbia River and surrounding
Clatsop County's Board of Commissioners.
   The anti-tournament calls itself Safe Harbors and Recreational
Choices, or SHARC.

   Environmentalists who planned a three-day

   U.S. Forest Service biologists had opposed the concert, saying a
crowd of 700 to 1,000 people might upset the nesting owls. The
federal government listed the spotted owl as a threatened species
in June.
   Concert organizers had complained they were being harassed by
the Forest Service since the Aug. 24-26 concert will feature
acoustic folk music.
   The concert is sponsored by environmentalists who have beeng
trying to stop logging of old growth forests where the bird lives.
   The Forest Service said Wednesday the environmentalists had
agreed to move the event a mile from the spot where concerts had
been held the last four years.
   The concert site is in the Willamette National Forest, about 10
miles northeast of Detroit in the Cascade Range of northwest Oregon.

<TEXT>
   A judge Thursday approved settlement of a
lawsuit on behalf of mental patients who claimed they were pumped
with drugs and left in seclusion for long periods at the state's
largest mental hospital.
   The class-action lawsuit was filed by four advocacy groups in
Feburary 1989. It also claimed patients at the Augusta Mental
Health Institute were denied adequate medical care, and that the
state did not provide enough community treatment for the mentally
ill.
   The settlement signed by state Judge Bruce W. Chandler was
brought on behalf of an estimated 2,000 to 3,000 people who have
been patients at the complex, which serves the entire state, since
January 1988.
   It calls for a three-year program, which state officials
estimated would cost $7 million, to reduce the population at the
institute and expand community programs for former patients.
   ``Today is a historic day for the consumers'' of mental-health
care in Maine, said Richard M. Goldman, an Augusta attorney
representing the Maine Civil Liberties Union.
   Assistant Attorney General Linda Crawford pledged that Mental
Health Commissioner Robert W. Glover, Human Services Commissioner
Rollin Ives and hospital Superintendent Linda Breslin _ the
defendants in the suit _ were prepared to implement the plans in
the 131-page agreement.
   Lawyers in the case said they expected Chandler to appoint a
special master to oversee the plan by mid-September.
   The agreement calls for the number of patients at the hospital
to be gradually reduced to 70 by Aug. 1, 1995, including no more
than 20 who require skilled nursing or intermediate care. The
number does not include a separate forensic unit.
   On Thursday, the hospital had 280 non-forensic patients,
including 97 in its nursing home unit, according to Tammy Woodard,
secretary to Ric Hanley, the hospital's chief operating officer.
   By Jan. 1, 1991, the state must design a comprehensive mental
health system that provides patients means to continue living in
their communities unless they require hospitalization.
   The state must finance housing assistance, residential support
programs and crisis-intervention services for patients, hiring
additional staff to carry out the programs.

<HEAD>Brazil Says Invasion Will Not Affect Its Relations With Iraq</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Brazil, a key arms supplier to Iraq,
said it is ``extremely concerned'' over that country's invasion of
Kuwait but insisted its relations with Iraq will not be affected.
   ``Today, Brazil condemns the invasion but this won't affect
relations in the long term,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Lucio
Pimentel said at an afternoon briefing.
   ``There is no reason for a change,'' he added. ``Brazil has
important interests with Iraq and these will be maintained.''
   This South American country has become an important exporter of
arms, cars and services to Iraq in exchange for petroleum.
   Last year, Brazil purchased $1.46 billion of crude oil from
Iraq, or 26 percent of total daily oil imports, he said.
   However, Pimentel said Brazil has not exported arms to Iraq
since 1988 because of unpaid debts on previous arms deals.
   Trade relations between the countries improved steadily after
Brazil opened a credit line for weapons sales to Iraq in 1974. Iraq
become Brazil's second-biggest weapons customer and top oil
supplier, said Pimentel.
   During its 8-year war against Iran, Iraq bought large numbers of
Brazilian-made ``Urutu'' armored personnel carriers and
``Cascaval'' reconnaisance and anti-aircraft combat vehicules, an
official in a major Brazilian weapons manufacturer said.
   The official, who requested anonymity, said Brazil also sold
Iraq sophisticated computer and radar-controlled rockets and a
small quantity of ``Tucano'' planes, highly mobile training
aircraft costing $2 million apiece.
   Iraq invaded Kuwait on Thursday, seizing control of the oil-rich
state after heavy fighting and setting up a provisional government
after a 2-week-old dispute over oil production and borders.

   Mayor Marion Barry says he is suffering pain
and shame after a six-week trial in which his defense admitted he
used cocaine occasionally and the government accused him of having
``lived above the law.''
   The jury of two whites and 10 blacks was instructed Thursday not
to consider ``politics or race'' as the panel began deliberating
the mayor's fate on 14 criminal charges.
   The nine-woman, three-man jury's first decision was selecting a
foreman, Edward Eagles, one of the two whites.
   Barry engaged in ``occasional'' cocaine use, but the government
failed to prove the drug possession, conspiracy and perjury charges
against him, defense attorney R. Kenneth Mundy told the jury

   The administration also called on the Democratic Party to

   Stark said Sullivan, who is black, ``is being used by the

a speech Sullivan delivered in late July opposing proposals for
federally sponsored national health insurance. Stark is sponsoring

American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. apparently pocketed as much as

last month, but a regulator says the utility acted properly.
   The groups on Thursday petitioned the Federal Communications
Commission to consider rule changes that would require AT&amp;T to

cut prices only about $300 million rather than about $500 million.
   FCC Chairman Alfred Sikes told a House subcommittee that AT&amp;T

its price caps.''
   He said AT&amp;T had dropped prices so much voluntarily before July
1 that it needed only to reduce prices an additional $300 million.

   ``If we can show that the Earth is young ... in the range of

<HEAD>Military Spending Increases in Southeast Asia</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The end of the Cold War may produce a
peace dividend in Europe and the United States, but the nations of
Southeast Asia are going the other way.
   Defense officials reject the term ``arms race,'' but all members
of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations except the
Philippines are strengthening their military forces.
   Most blame uncertain conditions in the region. Translation: The
likely reduction of U.S. forces compels the six ASEAN members to
consider providing their own defense.
   It has dawned on ASEAN that, whatever happens to American bases
in the Philippines, reductions in Washington's defense budget will
mean a smaller U.S. military presence in Asia.
   A buildup of strategic weapons like missiles and advanced
fighters is occurring because military commanders are looking to
control borders and sea lanes.
   ``The relatively stable regional environment which we have long
taken for granted is now being reshaped,'' Abu Hassan Omar, the
Malaysian foreign minister, said in a policy statement.
   ``This could pose new challenges for all of us in the region,
especially since a stable security environment has been an
important underpinning of the region's rapid economic growth.''
   No reductions in defense spending are contemplated by Brunei,
Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, the Philippines or Thailand, the
six ASEAN members.
   Most are revising their military structures and weapons
procurement programs to meet what they see as a shifting security
environment that remains complex and potentially troublesome.
   ``If the United States significantly cuts back its military
forces in the region, this will not be a signal for Singapore also
to reduce our forces,'' said Lee Hsien Loong, deputy defense
minister of Singapore.
   ``It will be reason for concern over a potentially destabilizing
change in the regional balance of power.''
   Lee, 37, is the eldest son of Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew. He
also serves as trade minister and many expect him to become prime
minister eventually.
   Singapore openly supports a continued U.S. military presence in
the region, and a senior U.S. State Department official said in
late July that Brunei had joined Singapore in offering access to
the U.S. armed forces.
   An arrangement is being negotiated for increased use of
Singapore's facilities by American planes and warships. Details of
the arrangement with Brunei, which the U.S. official described as
``an enhanced security relationship,'' have not been disclosed.
   Officials in several other capitals agree privately with such
support, but are noncommittal in public.
   Abu Hassan put it this way: ``Malaysia appreciates the U.S. role
in the region and it is our sincere hope that the U.S. And the
Philippines will find an amicable solution.
   ``What is more important, however, is that the close and
extensive bilateral relations between the U.S. and the ASEAN
countries, which have served our mutual interests, be maintained.''
   Malaysia's military budget has grown with the economy, by 20
percent in the last two years. A memo of understanding signed with
Britain in 1988 covers the purchase of Tornado fighters,
anti-aircraft missiles and navy corvettes.
   Brunei, with money no object because of its oil riches, is
buying patrol boats and the the sultanate's first combat planes, 16
British-built Hawks.
   Tight military budgets have been the rule in Indonesia while the
country worked its way out of recession, but it followed Singapore
in buying U.S.-built F-16 jet fighters. Planes of both countries
use a new firing range in Sumatra.
   Defense spending in Singapore is about 6 percent of its gross
domestic product, the sum of all goods and services sold in a
nation. That amounts to the equivalent of $1.9 billion this year
for a nation of 2.7 million people.
   Diplomats said Thailand's military budget increased 16 percent
over last year, to $2.1 billion. The Thai air force also has F-16s
and plans to buy flight simulators jointly with Indonesia and
Singapore for pilot training.
   Bilateral land, sea and air exercises between forces of ASEAN
members have become common, although it is not a military alliance.
   Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus of the Philippines thinks it is
time for ASEAN to discuss regional security.
   ``If after sitting down, we should decide not to do anything and
to consider this matter as a purely bilateral matter between us and
each of the superpowers ... let that be, but at least we will know
what we are thinking about,'' he told foreign correspondents last
month in Manila.
   Some officials worry about what will happen in the region as
U.S. and Soviet forces are reduced.
   ``Without a persuasive U.S. presence, there will be a power
vacuum, which other powers would scramble to fill,'' Lee Hsien
Loong of Singapore said in March.
   He gave India as an example and said the Japanese, too, were
modernizing their forces. ``As an economic superpower, it has an
understandable interest in the state of the region,'' Lee said of
Japan.
   Diplomats say other ASEAN members consider China a greater
regional threat than India.
   The Spratleys are a possible powder key. China, Malaysia, the
Philippines and Vietnam have conflicting claims to the tiny islands
in the South China Sea, which are being explored for oil. China and
Vietnam came to blows over them in 1988.

<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There have been shows about the hunt for
elephants, submarines, bad guys, lost tykes and even the elusive
butterfly of love. And now, for something completely different:
``The Beer Hunter.''
   It's a six-part serenade to suds, written and hosted by Michael
Jackson, a British writer and beer expert. A man of firm views, he
believes beer is far more than a belch propellant.
   ``It is as varied as wine, it is as noble as wine, it is as
complex as wine,'' says Jackson, whose seven books on the subject
include ``The New World Guide to Beer.''
   His series, premiering Aug. 23 on cable's Discovery Channel,
studies beer varieties in Holland, Germany, Belgium, Great Britain,
Canada and the United States. His American visit reports on San
Francisco's famed Anchor Steam beer.
   Jackson, who lives in London, said he's been writing about beer
for 16 years. He began in journalism 14 years earlier. He noted in
passing that ``in those days, newspaper journalists drank a lot of
beer.''
   There are rumors that some still do, he was told.
   ``Not so many now,'' he said, a bit wistfully. ``It worries me
sometimes when I see these non-drinking journalists. I don't see
how they can function.''
   Jackson took up the cause of beer when he noticed how people
partook of and talked about beer. Yet they only wrote about wine,
no doubt considering beer one of the lesser grogs, suitable only
for drinking.
   ``I felt right from square one that beer didn't get the respect
it deserved,'' said the writer.
   He dedicated himself to raising beer criticism and reportage to
the high, indeed mystical level devoted to the world of Grappa
Stompa, which is Italian for Grapes That Have Been Stomped On.
   There are a variety of wines, such as chardonnay, cabernet,
sauterne and port, he noted. But beer is equally diverse. There are
Belgian brews with winey tartness; fruity-tasting ales; soft, spicy
dark lagers, and so on.
   Jackson's crusade to make this known and enlighten minds and
palates has not been without controversy in England, where there is
an organization called The Campaign for Real Ale.
   There is debate within that group, he said, ``whether some of
the writers _ i.e., me _ are making beer too elitist.''
   Sometimes no help is needed. In New York and Los Angeles, for
example, some citizens _ they are called yuppies _ try to be beer
elitists. They invariably cause snickers because, no matter where
they are, they always ask barkeeps:
   ``Ehhhh, what kinds of beer do you have?''
   But New York and Los Angeles ``are very unsophisticated cities
in terms of beer,'' Jackson contends. ``If you want to see people
who know about beer, you have to go to Seattle or Portland or San
Francisco.''
   In those cities, he said, ``there's been a renaissance of
serious interest in beer'' that started in the mid-'70s with the
opening of several small breweries in Northern California and then
spread to the Pacific Northwest.
   Jackson may well be envied by many journalists, particularly
those who after work like to knock back a round or two of Old
Frothingslosh.
   A few who take aboard more have been known to propose marriage,
confide dark secrets, weep, fall off a bar stool or even sing,
``The Beer That Made Milwaukee Famous Has Made a Loser Out of Me.''
   But for Jackson, moderation is all. His tippling is purely
professional. He does admit that getting sloshed ``is a hazard. But
I don't think I've ever fallen prey to it when I've been tasting.''
   He did have a small problem when filming the German part of
``The Beer Hunter'' at a beer festival, he said. His director said
things like, ``Can we do that again? Where you swallow that pint of
beer, can we just do it again?''
   By 9 p.m., Jackson still was being asked for another take. The
script called for him to conclude things with a cosmic statement on
beer. But he noticed he was approaching a condition known as
Unclear.
   ``I said, `Hey, John, I'm just too drunk to do this.' And he
said, `You don't seem drunk to me.' I said, `That's because you're
drunk.'''
   Jackson gave it a try, though. He succeeded this time.
   ``I saw it on the rushes and thought I looked terrible,'' he
said. ``But nobody's commented on it.''

   NBC AND UNION TO MEET: NBC and officials of the network's major
union, the National Association of Broadcast Employees and
Technicians, are scheduled to meet here Tuesday for what NABET
negotiator Tom Kennedy calls exploratory talks. On July 27, a
majority of the union's members rejected a four-year NBC contract
offer for the second time this year. But no strike vote has yet
been taken by NABET, whose members struck the network for 17 weeks
in 1987. The union's previous contract expired on March 31.

   Good military and business strategy dictates
avoidance of any action that places one in a position where others
can call the moves.
   U.S. economic policy seems never to learn the lesson.
   Billions of dollars in loans to less developed countries someday
may be witten off as uncollectible. Because of this threat,
American borrowers already pay an interest premium beyond what
rates otherwise might be.
   Political leaders have failed to deal effectively with decades
of budget deficits. Much of the money, corporate and governmental,
is borrowed abroad. Should foreigners withdraw it suddenly, the
U.S. economy would suffer.
   These are just two instances of how vulnerable the United States
economy is to actions over which is has relatively little control.
The latest, of course, is the Mideast uproar, which threatens
higher domestic oil prices.
   Higher domestic prices could:
   _Be the difference between an economy growing weakly, as now,
and an economy tipped into recession.
   _Fuel inflation. Moreover, an inflation that domestic policy
could do little to contain. Demand-pull inflation, in which an
excess of demand pulls prices higher, can be dealt with internally.
Imported inflation may not.
   The type of inflation produced by high imported oil prices is
cost-push. Increased costs to importers are passed to refiners, to
distributors, to the companies that buy it, to the customers of
those companies...
   While such inflation would mean distressingly higher heating oil
and gasoline prices, it could be devastating to industries, some of
which already are operating on low margins because of global
competition.
   Conceivably, the higher costs of fuel could mean less air travel
at a time when airlines are seeking more passengers. It could mean
considerably less driving, which in turn could become translated
into fewer automobile sales.
   Should higher oil prices stick, it would be a serious blow to a
resolution of the U.S. imbalance of payments. That problem, perhaps
overly simplified, is that the United States buys more abroad than
it sells there.
   One reason for this imbalance is the growth of oil imports,
which now account for nearly 50 percent of U.S. supplies, a record
high volume that is still growing. Now it will be growing at even
higher prices.
   The one aspect of higher oil prices, a very tentative one at
this point, is that conceivably it could spur domestic exploration
and development, which has been eroding at a pace faster than usage
is growing.
   June domestic crude oil production was just 7.1 million barrels
a day. A little more than four years ago the country was producing
9.1 million barrels a day. The shortfall has been made up by
increased imports.
   Because of its dependency on oil imports, U.S. options in the
Iraq-Kuwait dispute are limited. Consider the extent of the
involvement: domestic interest rates, the inflation rate, balance
of payments, budget deficit...
   The situation didn't develop without warning. Few people who
lived through the 1970s oil-import problems will ever forget them.
In fact, they and their leaders vowed not to forget _ and then did.
   When the price of imported oil soared back then, it pitched the
American economy into chaos, and some economists trace to it our
current problems with inflation, high interest rates, and chronic
imbalance of payments.
   The warning flag has been flying high and flapping loudly since
the 1970s, but somehow it has been ignored.
   Ironically, some of those other problems, the ones that have so
consumed the interest of policymakers and diverted their attention
from oil, might have had their origins in the very thing they've
ignored.
   That is, in America's dependence on imported oil.

<HEAD>It's Like Old Times for Oil-Service Stocks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thanks to rising oil prices and the flareup of
trouble in the Middle East, some old stars of the stock market are
back for a much-delayed encore.
   Even before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Thursday, the skimpy
list of New York Stock Exchange issues making new 52-week highs
gave prominent places to names like Schlumberger and Halliburton
from the oil service industry.
   And as the hostilities set off an explosive reaction in markets
around the world, oil-service issues racked up further gains.
   Until about a year ago, it had been a long dry spell for
investors in oil service companies, which specialize in providing
equipment and services such as construction and testing for oil and
gas producers.
   The collapse in oil prices of the mid-1980s, while helping the
rest of the economy and the overall stock market to prosper, drove
the oil-service industry into the red in 1986 and 1987. A
subsequent recovery was slow and tortuous.
   Oil-service stocks lagged through most of the 1980s while the
Dow Jones average of 30 industrials kept soaring to new heights.
   Schlumberger, for example, had become a glamour name in the
portfolios of investing institutions by the time it hit a record
high of $87.25 a share, adjusted for splits, in late 1980.
   Then it lapsed into a long decline that drove it as low as
$27.37 in 1986 and $26 in the October 1987 crash. From its ticker
symbol SLB, some Wall Street traders took to calling it ``Slob.''
   Since early 1989, however, the shares have more than doubled,
from $32 to the neighborhood of $67.
   Similarly, Halliburton, after falling from $87 in 1980 to $17.50
in 1986, has rallied back above $55.
   Baker Hughes, the product of a 1987 merger between the
oil-service companies Baker International and Hughes Tool Co., has
since jumped from $11.12 to around $33.
   Some of that dramatic revival has stemmed from an improvement in
conditions that has already shown up on the industry's bottom line.
Few analysts dispute that further profit recovery is in store.
   ``With worldwide oil and gas exploration activity on the upswing
as a result of rising crude prices, companies that provide
equipment and services to the international oil industry are likely
to prosper in coming years,'' says Standard &amp; Poor's weekly
publication The Outlook in a current report on the group.
   At the same time, however, some analysts question whether the
real-live fundamentals are strong enough to justify the degree of
enthusiasm traders have shown lately for the stocks.
   The oil-service group has become a favorite of speculators, they
note, as a means of trying to profit from swings in the price of
oil.
   Furthermore, they note, the experience of the '80s has shown
that unpredictable shifts in Middle East politics can be volatile
downward as well as upward for oil-service investors.
   The Value Line Investment Survey, in its latest quarterly review
of the industry, cautions, ``we haven't made a case for the kind of
boom apparently anticipated in the prices of some of this sector's
stocks.''
   In an analysis published recently as Iraq was beginning to
menace Kuwait, Edward Yardeni, economist at Prudential-Bache
Securities, concluded:
   ``This development does raise the risk of another oil crisis,
especially since the United States is so dependent on foreign oil
once again.
   ``But let's not get hysterical. Instead, let's keep a close
watch on events in the Persian Gulf.''

<HEAD>Some Republicans Feel Betrayed by GOP Budget Plan</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the political poker game over a
deficit-cutting deal, President Bush has shown most of his hand,
and the Democrats have yet to turn over a card.
   That frustrates the White House, irks Republican negotiators,
makes some GOP congressional candidates downright angry. And not
just at Democrats.
   Bush moved from never to maybe to OK on a tax increase _ three
abrupt steps in 12 weeks _ without notice to the Republican
candidates who feel at risk.
   GOP campaigners who had gone to the voters with their own
versions of the no-new-taxes position that served Bush in 1988
suddenly came up short one major issue. Even when they'd disagreed
with him about the acceptability of a tax increase, they felt the
issue had been blurred.
   That internal strain was worse for the fact that the White House
made no effort to create a Republican consensus for the president's
changing position. When he called the budget summit and said he
would negotiate without preconditions, dropping the no tax barrier
without actually saying so, the word went to congressional leaders,
both parties.
   When he made it explicit, saying tax revenue increases would
have to be part of a deficit-cutting deal, it was by written
statement, no immediate explanation.
   And when the administration got specific 10 days ago, outlining
a $54-billion deficit reduction plan replete with taxes _ one a
ceiling on deductions for state and local income taxes _ it went to
GOP summit negotiators, no notice to the rank and file.
   In a way, the major advantage of the party in the White House
has become a liability. The Democrats, the congressional party,
don't speak with one voice; they have to fashion bargaining
positions with a consensus among House, Senate and committee
leaders. They talked privately about a Democratic budget plan to
put on the negotiating table, but couldn't come to terms and didn't
push it.
   At the same time, the administration put together a $54-billion
package of spending cuts and tax increases, and budget director
Richard G. Darman presented it to the Republican bargaining team
late in July. They agreed, or at least acquiesced. But their
consent built no consensus behind the White House plan.
   And that problem quickly got worse.
   According to the White House, the Republican plan was prepared
to be presented simultaneously with a Democratic package.
   There wasn't any.
   Besides, Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., went public with the
administration plan, saying that a provision to limit the federal
deductibility of state income taxes ought to satisfy the Democrats
who wanted to increase taxes on the rich. That, and a proposal for
steep tax increases on beer and wine, stirred an immediate
backlash, especially among governors, who saw it as a threat to
state revenue sources.
   The question of who'd go first on unpleasant tax and spending
steps, and thus take the political onus, has been a sticking point
all along. And the Democrats insisted they had not signed off on
any deal to deliver simultaneous budget-cutting plans.
   Rep. Richard A. Gephardt, D-Mo., the majority leader, said
``there may have been some miscommunication about what was going to
happen.''
   So it seems.
   ``We have been dealing with the Democrats in good faith,'' Bush
told restive congressional Republicans on Wednesday. ``We have a
plan we are prepared to share with them when they present theirs.''
   But it already had been shared, with the Democrats and everybody
else, although not formally presented to the budget summit.
   And Bush's message to the Republicans varied depending on who
was describing it. He said he would veto appropriations bills
exceeding his original budget, although he doesn't have any to veto
just now. And that he said he would enforce sharp, automatic cuts
in federal spending _ potentially about $100 billion worth _ unless
there is a settlement before Oct. 1, when the new budget year
begins.
   But his own aides differed on how tough a campaign stance he'll
take with the Democrats on spending and the deficits, with
intensified budget negotiations due after Labor Day. It may not
make a lot of difference; Republican candidates have drawn their
own lines on the issue. That's one reason House Republicans voted
in a July 18 caucus against any new taxes or higher rates on old
ones, rejecting a position Bush had just accepted.
   They're the ones with re-election bids on the line this year,
and some of them suspect their political interests are being risked
in the administration quest for a five-year, $500-billion deficit
reduction agreement _ a deal that would last past the next
presidential campaign.

<HEAD>Africans Fear Eastern Europe Will Monopolize Western Aid</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserGraphic planned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY SMITH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Africa needed something to cheer about after the world recession
of the 1970s and its own debt crisis in the 1980s.
   The end of the Cold War might have been just the thing, but the
hoped-for peace dividend has not materialized and political
pluralism is bad news to many African leaders.
   According to World Bank figures, a 10 percent cut in military
spending would allow the industrialized world to double its
official aid programs.
   That could mean better water supplies for Guinea, more bread in
Mozambique and new schools and hospitals in the Congo.
   Instead of the money African leaders might have expected,
however, they are increasingly worried about stiff competition from
Eastern Europe's new democracies for Western interest, aid and
investment.
   They fear Eastern Europe's constant tugging at Western heart and
purse strings will divert badly needed capital and condemn the
world's poorest continent to further decades of misery.
   What squaring up to the competition means in many cases is shock
therapy for state-dominated economies that are lumbering and often
corrupt.
   Economic reform aims to attract more Western capital to Africa,
but also may force political reform on governments with little or
no popular support.
   ``African leaders are worried ... firstly about official aid
flows and secondly about private investment,'' said Roy Laishley,
managing editor of Africa Recovery, a U.N. quarterly publication.
   Although Western officials are quick to reassure Africa it will
not be forgotten, not all the signs are good. Analysts estimate aid
must grow by 4 percent annually to produce a 1 percent increase in
living standards for ordinary people of the Third World.
   Africa is the only continent where the struggle against poverty
is a total failure, according to the World Bank's 1990 development
report.
   By the year 2000, sub-Saharan Africa will account for more than
30 percent of the developing world's poor, compared with 16 percent
in 1985, even if aid continues to grow at current rates, the report
said.
   The bank, the largest source of aid to developing countries,
said last month its lending had decreased in the past year for the
first time since 1985.
   Moeen A. Qureshi, senior vice president for operations, said the
decline from $21.3 billion for the year ending in June 1988 to
$20.7 billion 12 months later was partly due to a reduction in
loans to China.
   World Bank loans to Africa rose slightly to $3.93 billion from
$3.92 billion, but Qureshi said the bank would be playing a much
greater role in financing Eastern European countries such as
Poland, Hungary, Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia.
   World Bank lending is expected to rise again over the next year.
   Western nations cut development aid for poor nations to $46.5
billion last year from $48.1 billion in 1988, according to the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
   An OECD statement traced the decline to ``special factors in the
timing of payments to multilateral institutions, mainly the World
Bank.''
   Joseph Wheeler, chairman of the organization's Development
Assistance Committee, said Third World aid remained a high priority
and the decrease did not involve shift of funds to Eastern Europe.
   Officials of the European Community point out that the $625
million of aid set aside this year for Poland, Hungary, Yugoslavia,
Czechosolvakia, Bulgaria and East Germany is only 5 percent of the
$15 billion, five-year Lome IV agreement channeling assistance to
African, Caribbean and Pacific nations.
   The latest of the Lome packages, named for the capital of Togo,
represents a 46 percent nominal increase and a 20 percent rise in
real terms, said Xavier Prats, an EC spokesman for development.
   Third World populations expanding rapidly, however, and Lome IV
still means only about $2 in new aid per person per year for
1990-1995, analysts say. That compares with an annual $20 per
person for a three-year EC program in Poland and Hungary.
   European Community aid to those countries and Bulgaria,
Czechoslovakia, East Germany and Yugoslavia is expected to reach
$1.25 billion a year by 1992, and the EC will be a major backer of
a new European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
   ``In addition to aid, there's a need for additional investment''
in Africa, ``and that's certainly being undermined by the eagerness
of the business community to look east and compete for future
positions in Eastern Europe,'' said Jos Lemmers, director of the
Council of Europe's Center for Global Interdependence and
Solidarity.
   Barber B. Conable, president of the World Bank, said on a recent
visit to West Germany the developing nations ``must work harder to
attract investments; otherwise money will go to Eastern Europe.''
   Private capital ``goes where the most attractive opportunities
are,'' he said.
   That now appears to be Africa's main problem.
   Because of easier opportunities in Eastern Europe, fewer Western
investors are willing to brave the unpredictable, often
anti-capitalist African business climate unless political leaders
offer sweeping economic reforms, analysts say.
   President Kenneth Kaunda decided recently to double the price of
flour and other basic commodities to shore up Zambia's flagging
economy. Zambians protested violently and security forces arrested
an army officer for plotting a coup.
   ``I would say some of the reforms African nations are using to
attract foreign investment are dangerous,'' a U.N. Africa
specialist said, on condition of anonymity.
   ``It's a high political risk to take, to implement austerity
measures at a time when very poor people already have next to no
money in their pockets.''
   Pro-democracy protests have taken place in several African
nations this year.
   Many Western aid experts are critical of demands by some donors
that continued aid be linked to political reform.
   ``What is essential is to have greater respect of human
rights,'' an EC official said, also on condition of anonymity.
``that doesn't mean just transplanting Western-style democracies to
Africa. They are not always practical and often not possible.''
   Lemmers' center at the Council of Europe is sponsoring a series
of East-West-South conferences scheduled to begin in Budapest,
Hungary, this year.
   He said Africa could benefit from the end of the Cold War,
citing new market potential in Eastern Europe for Third World
agricultural products.
   Instead of laying the blame for Africa's economic ills solely at
the door of the former European colonial powers, African leaders
now seem more willing to shoulder some of the responsibility.
   President Quett Masire of Botswana described the new attitude as
a turning point for the continent.
   ``We are willing to go to the doctor and ask for the right
medication,'' he said recently after a 70-nation conference on
Africa in the Netherlands. Masire and Robert McNamara, former
president of the World Bank, were co-chairmen.

   The European Community's effort to
revive the economies of Eastern Europe causes anxiety among
Southeast Asian nations that seek aid and investment.
   While welcoming the emergence of democracy in the former Soviet
bloc, some members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
worry that resources will be diverted to that region at their
expense.
   Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, Brunei and the
Philippines make up the assocition, a loose grouping formed in 1967
to foster regional economic and cultural development.
   All six are apprehensive that removal of most trade barriers
among the 12 European Community nations in 1992 will hurt their
export-driven economies, and seek assurances that Eastern Europe's
restoration will not be at their expense.
   ``ASEAN's fear is that the community's assistance to these
countries would result in the diversion of its assistance from
other developing countries, especially ASEAN,'' said Foreign
Minister Abu Hassan Omar of Malaysia.
   ``The community's investment in ASEAN has been lagging behind
those of Japan and the United States,'' he said at a news
conference.
   ``With the opening of Eastern and Central Europe,lion.
   Investment by EC countries in ASEAN member nations is far behind
that of Japan and the United States, and has grown at a slower
rate. ASEAN officials say Europeans favor investments within the EC
or in North America, and fear the pattern will reinforced by the
unified market.
   Some in ASEAN feel the region risks becoming Japan's ``economic
backyard'' if European trade and investment goes elsewhere. Prime
Minister Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore expressed that view on a recent
trip to Europe.
   He said returns on investments in Eastern Europe might not equal
those on money put into nations of the Pacific rim, many of which
are booming.
   ``To make East European work forces highly productive and
competitive, that cannot be done overnight,'' Lee declared.
   Officials of ASEAN said rechanneled aid and investment would be
direct losses, and Eastern Europe also might become a low-cost
trading competitor,
   Indonesia appears most vulnerable to such a diversion. It
remains heavily dependent on help from abroad and expects more than
one-quarter of revenue for the 1990-91 fiscal year to come from
foreign aid.
   More than $4.5 billion will reach it this year from the
Intergovernmental Group on Indonesia, an organization of 13 donor
countries, the World Bank and similar agencies.

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hundreds of Colombians have died and the
United States has spent millions of dollars in a year-long effort
to destroy the Medellin cartel, but the war goes on and the cocaine
still flows north.
   A presidential candidate was shot down at a rally the night of
Aug. 18, 1989, and the government, shocked and outraged, declared
war on drug gangs that had become so powerful they threatened to
take over the country.
   Luis Carlos Galan, who spoke out against the cocaine barons, was
standing on a wooden platform acknowledging the cheers and applause
of thousands of people when hired killers opened fire with machine
guns.
   His death began a chain of events that terrorized Colombia and
revealed the horror a voracious U.S. appetite for cocaine could
create.
   A year later, the war rages on. Increasingly, it appears
unwinnable, but the government has scored some victories.
   National police have seized a record 40 tons of cocaine so far
this year in raids on jungle laboratories, more than the 33 tons
captured in all of 1989.
   Cocaine delivered in Miami costs $35,000 a kilogram, or 2.2
pounds. Before last August, the price had been as low as $10,000.
   Officials say the higher prices indicate success in reducing the
supply, but the flow has not been stopped.
   Galan's murder awakened Colombians from a slumber that had
permitted drug traffickers free rein. President Virgilio Barco
issued his declaration of war and the world's attention focused on
this South American country.
   At the rally, the initial reaction to the shots was like the
response to an earthquake, when people know something is terribly
wrong but do not realize immediately that the ground is heaving
beneath them.
   Because of the noisy scene, the rapid gunfire made popping
sounds, like small firecrackers. Not even Galan's bodyguards
understood immediately. Panic and screams began when Galan fell,
mortally wounded.
   Two more presidential candidates were murdered soon afterward
and the drug gangs bombed a packed airliner, killing all 107 people
aboard. In several cities, car bombs exploded at restaurants,
supermarkets, schools and in the streets.
   Some bombs in Bogota, the capital, were so powerful they left
huge clouds hanging over the city of 6 million people.
   Colombians had viewed terrorism in places like Lebanon or Israel
as distant wars among fanatics.
   Now they had their own terrorists, not religious or political
fanatics with age-old grievances, but drug traffickers who killed
other people coldly, to protect their business.
   The Medellin cartel, largest of the cocaine gangs, was taking in
billions of dollars a year by 1989 and warning public officials to
get out of the way. Those who couldn't be intimidated were murdered.
   ``We now know that the cartel is like a monstrous octopus in the
ocean, with only the top of its head visible,'' a source involved
in planning the anti-drug war told The Associated Press. ``The
tentacles extend to the United States and around the world,'' he
said, referring to bank deposits, bribes and murder.
   Like virtually every other person involved in fighting the
Medellin cartel, the source would speak only on condition of
anonymity.
   With Galan's death and the government crackdown that followed,
the world opened its eyes to the danger of the drug gangs.
   President Bush sent $65 million worth of military aid to
Colombia from a special fund available to him.
   In February, he met with the presidents of Colombia, Bolivia and
Peru, which provide most of the world's cocaine, in the Colombian
port city of Cartagena. Bush agreed to increase economic aid to the
impoverished Andean nations to help them and their farmers find
alternate sources of income.
   At another summit in Britain, Western European nations
recognized the high price Colombia was paying in the drug war and
agreed to help.
   Justice Minister Roberto Salazar noted that other countries were
realizing the drug trade was international, not a Colombian problem.
   ``The world began to recognize that Colombia is providing 90
percent of leadership in fighting the drug scourge,'' he said in an
interview.
   Because of police raids, drug traffickers have moved many
cocaine processing operations to neighboring Brazil and Ecuador,
Salazar said, and the labs being destroyed are so rudimentary they
can be replaced in a few days.
   Another problem is the billions of dollars available for bribes.
   ``If a cop in New York or Miami making $30,000 a year can be
bribed by drug traffickers there, then imagine how easy it is to
bribe one here who makes only about $2,000,'' an agent of the U.S.
Drug Enforcement Administration told the AP.
   Most of the war on traffickers falls to the 80,000-man national
police force led by Gen. Miguel Gomez, 52, who has a university
degree in education.
   ``Fortunately, we've got an honest cop at the top,'' a U.S.
diplomat said.
   Gomez has dismissed half a dozen colonels, several dozen other
officers and hundreds of ordinary policemen in an effort to clean
up the force.
   A source close to the search for bribe takers said a police
colonel can make $15,000 a month in payoffs.
   Gomez said he had only 22 helicopters for raiding labs and
fighting the cocaine gangs, and needed 20 more.
   Salazar, the justice minister, said the struggle involves much
more than police or military action.
   Some countries allow the shipment of cocaine-processing
chemicals to Colombia, he said, and the drug lords can buy all the
weapons they want on the international arms market.
   Huge arms shipments destined for Colombia's drug traffickers
have been seized in the past year, but many others obviously get
through. Raids on cartel hideouts over the years have turned up
hundreds of thousands of weapons.
   Foreign governments appear either unable or unwilling to stop
the laundering of drug money, Salazar said in the interview.
   Industrialized countries must strengthen regulation of banks, he
said, and praised U.S. requirements that banks report all accounts
worth more than $5,000.
   ``When they can pick up cellular phones and transfer millions of
dollars, they can own half the world,'' Salazar said of the cocaine
barons.
   He said the success of Colombia's war on the cartels depends in
large part on how much of their assets are seized elsewhere.
   President Barco's government negotiated an agreement with the
United States that allows Colombia to share in the hundreds of
millions of dollars of traffickers' assets seized in the United
States.
   Cesar Gaviria, the new president, pledged before his
inauguration Aug. 7 to press the anti-drug war, but has said
Colombia will not fight it alone.
   Gaviria has not indicated whether he will continue Barco's
policy of extraditing trafficking suspects. Twenty have been sent
to the United States for trial in the past year, but none are
believed to be major figures.
   Salazar said Colombia must consider reforming its justice system
so the suspects can be tried at home. In the past, judges have been
bribed or coerced into letting drug traffickers go.
   Drug-trafficking cases should be handled by special judges who
live and work in protected areas, the justice minister said.

   Pablo Escobar, a former car thief who
became a billionaire cocaine trafficker, remains at large in the
Colombian Andes, where the fear and loyalty of peasants protect him.
   There may never have been a manhunt like the one for Escobar,
who runs the drug gang that smuggles most of the cocaine sold in
the United States.
   Speculation that security forces didn't really want to catch
Escobar and other members of the Medellin cartel ended Dec. 15,
when the army tracked down and killed Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, the
cartel's No. 2 man.
   Police killed all five of Rodriguez's bodyguards and his
17-year-old son, Freddy, who was carrying weapons.
   Rodriguez ran into a banana plantation, firing at a helicopter
gunship pursuing him, and the helicopter riddled the cocaine
trafficker with bullets.
   Some observers say police do not intend to take Escobar alive
because his men could might kidnap government officials and hold
them hostage until their boss was freed.
   The search appears relentless.
   Police set up roadblocks and soldiers raid suspected hideouts.
Using sophisticated U.S. radio monitoring and tracking devices,
they try to trace transmissions believed to come from Escobar's
bodyguards.
   Colombia's 80,000 national police have mounted several major
operations based on tips about where Escobar could be found.
   Security forces seem to have come close three times in the last
year.
   Several weeks ago, the army thought it had Escobar surrounded.
When soldiers broke into a shack, they found it empty, but a coffee
pot was steaming and there was evidence Escobar had been hiding out
there.
   A wanted poster with Escobar's photograph has appeared regularly
on television.
   Although the government has offered $500,000 for his capture, it
is doubtful many Colombians are eager to cash in. Escobar and his
cohorts have killed at least hundreds of people, perhaps thousands.
   Also, many poor Colombians hold Escobar in high regard. He
approaches sainthool in a neighborhood of Medellin, the cartel's
headquarters, where he replaced slum shacks with houses of brick
and cinder block.
   Gen. Miguel Gomez, chief of the national police, said Escobar
was moving from hideout to hideout in the northwestern state of
Antioquia.
   Escobar's genorosity to peasants makes information on the drug
lord's whereabouts hard to come by.
   ``He owns every pair of eyes in Antioquia,'' a foreign diplomat
said.
   Asked about Escobar's ability to elude the dragnet, Gen. Gomez
said: ``We have our own methods, and we will succeed.''

   Iraq's invasion of Kuwait shook financial
markets around the world, sending oil prices, the dollar and
interest rates soaring and stock prices reeling.
   Crude oil rose $1.57 a barrel in New York futures trading
Thursday and nearly $2 in London, unleashing fears of a resurgence
of inflation and a possible recession in the United States that
affected other markets
   Oil prices were boosted by the possibility the invasion
eventually could affect output from the two nations or other

<HEAD>Recession: A Matter of Definition</HEAD>
<HEAD>Also moved in advance</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For practical, everyday purposes, the debate
about whether the economy is in recession or just this side of it
is all but meaningless.
   Recession is a technical, statistical, arbitrary definition. It
isn't a line that when crossed rearranges the perspective, any more
than the autumnal equinox brings a sudden change to fall weather.
   For many people, it is a rather academic event, occurring when
the economy suffers two consecutive quarters of shrinking gross
national product, and that means you are at least six months into
it before you know it.
   In fact, there have been recessions that weren't demonstrated
until they were over and recessions so mild they might have
represented better times than during some officially designated
growth periods.
   Some recessions sneak up gradually, as some economists believe
is happening now, and others explode, as in 1973, when President
Ford was campaigning to ``Whip Inflation Now,'' not realizing that
a deep recession had begun.
   There have been recessions that skipped some geographical and
occupational areas, and a recession in the mid-1980s that
encompassed most of the nation but never qualified as one because
good times in a few states skewed the averages.
   At one extreme, there have been recessions so deep unemployment
rose to 25 percent, and so long they ruined most of a decade, as in
the late, unlamented 1930s. And at the other extreme, recessions
that came and departed silently.
   Far more important than the technical definitions are: 1. the
strength or weakness of the economy; and 2. whether it is gaining
strength or losing it. Right now the economy is weak, and it is
losing strength.
   Real gross national product rose at an annual rate of just 1.2
percent during the second quarter of the year, the fifth straight
quarter of less than 2 percent growth rates. A healthy economy
would grow twice as fast.
   For probably the only time since the recession of the early
1980s, the major private sectors of the economy _ consumer
spending, business fixed investment, housing construction and net
exports _ declined simultaneously.
   In the same quarter, real disposable personal income rose at an
anemic annual rate of less than 1 percent. Consumer confidence is
unsteady. Big ticket sales are off. Some housing values are down.
Homebuilding is depressed.
   Some, perhaps most, of this is a consequence of what is called
the Federal Reserve's tight money policy. Restrict the flow of
money to the economy and the price of it _ interest rates _ goes up
or remains high.
   Tight money means tougher borrowing conditions, the intent of
which is to suppress activity. In real estate, for example, easy
money policies of the mid-1980s had led to bad loans, an excess of
construction and bankruptcies.
   Tight money, however, is a blunt instrument, hurting bad risks
and good together. It is the weapon now being used by the Fed to
bring down what are seen as inflationary pressures. But it could
create new ones.
   Small business, for example, is complaining that it is bearing
the brunt of the slowdown effort, and a survey by the U.S. Chamber
of Commerce tends to confirm that claim.
   The survey found that 20 percent of all businesses seeking
credit in the past six months had trouble borrowing, but that for
smaller commpanies _ those with sales of less than $1 million _ the
percentage rose to 27.4.
   Small companies are generally the innovators and job creators.
They are the price cutters. They are risk-takers, capable of
failing, to be sure, but also of growing swiftly. They are the
future competition for giant companies.
   For them, the source of future economic growth, the recession
has already begun, no matter that the official declaration of
recession has not been made.

<HEAD>Restless Checchi Structuring a Bigger, Friendlier Northwest</HEAD>
<HEAD>With BC-NWA-Glance.</HEAD>
<HEAD>Also in AMs report.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY KENNEDY</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Alfred Checchi is trying to make Northwest
Airlines bigger and friendlier, but he has been battling a sluggish
industry and some isolated turbulence in his first year as chairman.
   On the Aug. 3 anniversary of the day Checchi's group finalized a
$3.65 billion buyout of the nation's fourth-largest carrier,
Northwest is eyeing growth despite an industry-wide slump.
   With eyes on Eastern Airline's Atlanta hub and possibly other
Eastern jewels, Checchi has discussed the idea of buying the
carrier's assets out of bankruptcy court proceedings.
   ``They barely had the Northwest deal done before they started
looking at the landscape (for acquisitions),'' said Duane Woerth,
head of the union representing Northwest's 5,600 pilots. ``He's
changed the focus from top to bottom.''
   In the past 18 months, Northwest has gone from being a
conservatively managed takeover target with a fat balance sheet to
a highly leveraged aggressor headed by industry novices.
   Racked with labor strife and performance problems under former
chairman Steven Rothmeier, Northwest under Checchi is at peace with
its unions and winning back customers who had come to know it as
``Northworst.''
   But along the way there have been distractions.
   Three Northwest pilots were arrested March 8 and accused of
flying a passenger jet while under the influence of alcohol.
Northwest also has said it is one of many airlines being
investigated by the Justice Department for possible industry price
fixing.
   Checchi and other top executives at the airline have been
declining interviews for weeks. But he repeatedly has said he
intends to double the carrier's size in five years and make it
America's most preferred airline.
   ``They've improved the morale and the spirit of the people, but
I don't think they've made any money,'' said Mort Beyer, an
aviation consultant in Arlington, Va. ``My impression is that their
costs will be increasing faster than their revenues. I continue to
watch it with concern.''
   Since the takeover, Checchi has filled eight of the top 10 posts
at Northwest and has lost a lead fleet manager to United Airlines.
Former chief financial officer William Trubeck also has resigned,
but will act indefinitely as a consultant. Five new executives had
no airline management experience: Checchi, director Gary L. Wilson,
chief executive officer Fred Rentschler, president Frederic Malek,
and chief financial officer John Dasburg.
   Rentschler had been chief executive at Beatrice Cos. and
Dasburg, Malek, Wilson and Checchi had worked together at Marriott
Corp., where Wilson was Checchi's boss.
   ``They are primarily deal makers,'' Cliff Ehrlich, senior vice
president of human resources at Marriott, said of Checchi and
Wilson. ``I think they wake up in the morning thinking about deals
and go to bed thinking about deals.''
   Checchi has said the airline is healthy despite a $7.2 million
operating loss in the final quarter of last year and a $90 million
operating loss in the first quarter of this year. Nevertheless, the
$3.35 billion takeover debt has been slashed to about $2 billion,
putting the airline three years ahead of its seven-year repayment
schedule, spokesman Doug Miller said.
   But most of the payments have been made from cash reserves, by
selling and leasing back some planes and restructuring real estate,
Beyer said.
   ``That can't go on forever,'' he said. ``They need better cash
flows and the outlook for the year is down. The industry has had
$2.5 billion in operating losses in the past nine months, but
nobody pays attention to that.''
   Mike Hamilton, an analyst for The Leuthhold Group of
Minneapolis, said Northwest could afford an acquisition, but only
at the right price.
   ``I don't think he'll get them (Eastern's assets) at bargain
prices,'' Hamilton said, ``but there is nothing lost in trying.''
   Eastern assets would fit Northwest by adding passenger loads,
expanding maintenance space and feeding Northwest's Pacific Rim
routes. But labor trouble could break out if Checchi hires from the
non-union ranks at Eastern, said Guy Cook, president of
International Association of Machinists District Lodge 143.
   ``We will war with them if they come up with stupid ideas,''
Cook said. ``But at this point I have no reason to war with them.''
   Checchi hasn't been tested by contract talks, but Woerth and
Cook say relations are vastly improved. For 40 years, Northwest
workers considered themselves pawns of draconian managers, Cook
said. Now they sense some cooperation.
   In the old days, for example, a collision of ground vehicles
triggered automatic three-day suspensions, Cook said. A new
disciplinary program instead emphasizes good performances, he said.
   ``What I notice is the people throughout the company are more
proud of the airline,'' Woerth said.
   Meanwhile, travelers have observed a more punctual and reliable
airline. Northwest recently completed six months of on-time
performance, even with or ahead of comparable carriers, according
to U.S. Transportation Department reports. In addition, fewer bags
have been lost.
   The improvements dovetail with a five-year plan to invest $422
million to improve food service, seat space, cabin decor and speed
of maintenance.
   ``When it was Northwest Orient it was a class airline,'' said
Jim Maggio, whose New York firm is a travel agent for General
Motors Acceptance Corp. ``They're getting back to that.''
   Hamilton said the pilots' arrests and other incidents could have
left bigger stains on the company. But Checchi's management team
moved swiftly, including firing the pilots. Trial of the pilots
began this week in federal court.
   ``The one thing they have is a lot of common sense,'' Hamilton
said. ``They'll make a mistake, but they don't make the same
mistake twice.''

<HEAD>Experts Say Iraqi Invasion Likely To Boost Consumer Energy Prices</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIVIAN MARINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq's invasion of neighboring Kuwait will
likely mean higher energy costs for much of the nation, but the
federal government says the long-term effect won't be significant.
   Oil experts say it's difficult to predict exactly how much
prices will rise but that higher costs on the wholesale side will
trickle down to consumers.
   Concern that oil production and shipments might be disrupted in
the Middle East _ the source of about a quarter of U.S. oil imports
_ already has caused wholesale energy prices to soar.
   In futures trading, crude oil jumped more than $1.50 a 42-gallon
barrel, while unleaded gasoline and heating oil gained more than 3
cents a gallon.
   Trilby Lundberg, manager of a biweekly survey of gasoline prices
that bears her name, said spot checks show that some wholsale
gasoline distributors have raised their prices around a dime a
gallon from Wednesday due to the recent increases in prices from
their suppliers.
   Iraq invaded and seized control of its much smaller neighbor at
the northern tip of the Persian Gulf early Thursday. The attack
followed weeks of tension between the two countries over Iraqi
accusations that Kuwait stole oil from its territory and was
costing it billions of dollars in revenue by overproducing and
helping depress the price of oil.
   In response to the invasion, President Bush embargoed Iraq's
588,000 barrels a day of oil imports to this country, a cutoff that
analysts said could be made up from other countries.
   Henson Moore, the deputy secretary of energy, told reporters in
Washington that American consumers had little reason to worry,
mainly because an excess world supply of oil would cushion the loss
of Iraqi and Kuwaiti imports for an indefinite period.
   ``We do not see ... any imminent threat to the United States''
as a result of the loss of Iraqi oil, Moore told a news conference
at department headquarters. ``Nor do we see any long-term
significant increase in prices.''
   John Easton, the assistant energy secretary for international
affairs and energy emergencies, told the news conference that the
International Energy Agency, the 21-nation organization of oil
consuming countries, had tentatively scheduled a meeting of its
board of governors next week in Paris to consider the Iraqi
situation.
   Wholesale prices already had been rising in recent days in
reaction to an agreement by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries, of which Kuwait and Iraq are members, to restrain crude
production in order to raise the price of its oil to a target of
$21 a barrel.
   On Thursday, the September contract for West Texas Intermediate,
the benchmark grade of U.S. crude, jumped $1.57 to settle at $23.11
a 42-gallon barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The
near-month contract for the crude had traded in the low $16 range
earlier this summer.
   Among refined petroleum products, unleaded gasoline for
September delivery settled up 3.8 cents to 68.07 cents a gallon.
Heating oil settled up 3.5 cents to 64.69 cents a gallon.
   The general rule of thumb, according to industry experts, is
every dollar rise in the barrel of crude oil means a rise of two
cents to a nickel at the pumps.
   Peter Beutel, a trader and vice president for Merrill Lynch
Energy Futures, predicted home heating oil prices would rise at
least a nickel a gallon by the fall due to the impact of the
invasion. He said prices at the gas pumps could rise between 5 and
10 cents a gallon by Labor Day, one of the heaviest driving times
of the year for Americans.
   The average national price of a gallon of gas, including taxes,
was around $1.18 cents by late July, according to the biweekly
Lundberg Survey of nearly 13,000 service stations.
   Edward Ryan, an oil trader with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., said
consumers should be spared an immediate increase in energy prices
because of the current world glut of crude, partly due to high
production of the OPEC.
   In the United States alone, supplies of unleaded gasoline are up
about 10 percent from a year ago to 167.2 million barrels from
156.3 million, according to figures from the commodities brokerage
Refco Inc. Crude stocks are up to 338.7 million barrels from 330.6
million.
   ``You may not see the impact on the consumer level for at least
four to eight weeks,'' Ryan said. ``The current supplies on hand
are adequate and I just don't see retail prices reacting in the
same way as on the wholesale level.''
   John H. O'Connell, an energy analyst at Refco, said the oil
companies could absorb some of the increase.
   ``I think the oil companies will be cautious about passing it
(price hike) on to the consumers for fear it might hurt
consumption,'' he said.

   Workers at Pratt &amp; Whitney's East
Hartford plant say they're not surprised at the company's plan to
trim its work force to make up for a drop in defense business.
   ``People would have had to have had their heads in the sand not
to expect this,'' said John Makowiec, of East Longmeadow, Mass., a
work leader who has been employed by Pratt for 30 years.
   Tom Leduc, of Enfield, a millwright who has been with the
company 25 years, said there is always talk about reducing the work
force so there is no point in worrying.
   ``People now just wait until their time comes,'' he said.
   The aerospace giant announced Thursday it will eliminate 4,000
jobs by the end of 1993, mostly through attrition, because of an
expected drop-off in its military engine business.
   The action will reduce the size of the jet engine-maker's U.S.
work force by about 11 percent, with Pratt &amp; Whitney's Florida
operations suffering the greatest impact.
   Although it has a $20 billion backlog of orders for commercial
engines, the company said that would not offset the projected
decline in defense contracts.
   Pratt &amp; Whitney said half of the job reductions will take place
at its Connecticut, Maine and Georgia operations, which employ
28,300 people, with Connecticut bearing the brunt of the cutbacks.
   The company makes all of its commercial and military engines in
Connecticut, where it has a work force of 25,400 at plants in East
Hartford, Southington, North Haven and Middletown. It is the
state's largest private employer.
   The other 2,000 jobs will be eliminated from Pratt &amp; Whitney's
West Palm Beach operations, where 8,400 are employed, mostly in
military engineering and testing.
   ``We think that this shrinkage reflects where we see the Defense
Department going,'' said Curtis Linke, a spokesman for Pratt &amp;
Whitney, a division of United Technologies Corp.
   With easing world tensions, the budget ax is expected to come
down on Pratt-powered Air Force planes, such as the F-16 jet
fighter, the advanced tactical fighter and the C-17 transport.
   ``The military business is still very viable for us, it is just
getting smaller,'' Linke said.
   Orders for commercial engines continue to be strong, but
deliveries are spread out over the next decade, the company said.
   In 1989, Pratt &amp; Whitney earned $2.5 billion from its defense
sales, or about 36 percent of its business. Commercial engine sales
accounted for $3.4 billion in revenues, or 49 percent. Revenues
from engines built for general aviation totalled $1 billion.
   Pratt &amp; Whitney normally loses about 6 percent of its work force
through attrition each year. But some layoffs will also be
necessary because ``attrition never takes places in exactly the
right places,'' Linke said.
   The company said up to 300 workers could be laid off in Florida
this fall, and O'Connor said an undetermined number of layoffs are
also likely in Connecticut.
   The cutbacks will be the second big work force reduction in two
years. The company eliminated 2,650 salaried jobs in 1988 and 1989,
citing intense competition.
   The machinists union, which represents workers at all four
Connecticut plants, said company officials had agreed to meet with
union leaders in two weeks to discuss ways of avoiding layoffs.
   Romegialli said the union will push a number of proposals,
including an expansion of the company's early retirement program
and the transfer of affected workers to other divisions of United
Technologies.

<HEAD>West German Company to Purchase Fireman's Fund For $3.3 Billion</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Insurance industry analysts say a move
by Europe's largest insurance company to buy Fireman's Fund
Insurance Co. would give the firm a strong position in the U.S.
market.
   Allianz AG and Fireman's parent company, Fund America Companies
announced agreement on the $3.3 billion cash deal Thursday.
   ``Allianz, true to their statement, is interested in a bigger
presence in the largest insurance market in the world,'' said James
Ramenda, an insurance analyst with Northington Partners in Avon,
Conn.
   ``Clearly, the U.S. market is more than half of the world
market, and you can't in this day and age be isolated from that,''
said Bob Branche, managing director of Branche Research Group near
Philadelphia.
   Fireman's Fund, a nationwide property and casualty insurance
company, is the principal subsidiary of Fund American, and had
gross premiums in 1989 totaling $3.2 billion.
   Allianz, based in Munich, West Germany, had a worldwide premium
value of $20 billion in 1989, and has 223 subsidiaries in 45
countries. Allianz already operates in 20 states, company officials
said.
   Analysts agreed that the purchase would help Allianz prepare for
Europe's economic changes scheduled for 1992, when the common
market countries plan to ease trade barriers.
   With 1992 and its promise of increased competition looming,
``diversification makes a lot of sense,'' Ramenda said.
   The $3.3 billion price tag, which is almost three times
Fireman's Fund's book value, was the price Allianz had to pay for a
larger share of the U.S. market, Ramenda said.
   Foreign buyers need to find ``friendly deals'' in the U.S.
market because hostile deals can be blocked easily at the state
regulatory level, he said.
   The price ``simply testifies to Fireman's Fund's negotiating
ability,'' Ramenda said.
   Under the agreement, Allianz will acquire 100 percent of
Fireman's Fund Insurance stock. Fund American will buy back
Fireman's Fund's common stock portfolio and other long-term
investments for $2.2 billion in cash.
   When the transaction is closed, Fund American will repurchase
all 300,000 shares of convertible preferred stock of Fund American
now owned by IFINT SA, a Luxembourg corporation, for $434 million
in cash plus unpaid dividends.
   Fund American also plans to offer shareholders $800 million in
assets, either through dividends or a tender offer, the company
said.
   The sale will convert Fund American from an insurance company to
an investment company, said Thomas Sargent, an insurance analyst
with Conning &amp; Co. of Hartford.
   Fireman's Fund, headquartered in Novato, Calif., was founded in
1863. In 1968, it was acquired by The American Express Co., and in
1985 became an independent company during what was then the largest
initial public offering in the history of the New York Stock
Exchange.
   The company's revenues increased from $3.3 billion in 1985 to
$4.3 billion in 1987, but slipped to $3.29 billion last year. Net
income also peaked at $404 million in 1987; last year's profits
fell to $116 million from $279 million in 1988.
   Joyce Culbert, an insurance analyst with S.G. Warburg and Co. in
New York, said she couldn't understand Fireman's Fund's appeal to
Allianz, since the U.S. company has been fighting rising claims
costs and flat premium prices.
   ``The question is, what do you do to make it better, and do the
Germans know something that (Fireman's Fund Chairman) Jack Byrne
doesn't know?'' Culbert said.
   But Ramenda said Allianz would simply ride out Fireman's
problems until the U.S. insurance market begins to improve,
probably in 1992.
   ``The U.S. market's highly competitive,'' he said, ``so it's
unlikely that any one player could buck the cycle.''
   Wolfgang Muller, a member of the board of management of Allianz,
said in a statement that his company ``can add value to (Fireman's
Fund Insurance) through our international capabilities, but any
advances would come carefully and slowly.''
   The transaction, which is subject to approval by insurance and
other regulatory authorities and Fund American stockholders, is
expected to be completed early next year.

<BYLINE>Chrysler Boosting Prices; De-emphasizing Incentives
^By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HIGHLAND PARK, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. plans to try to back
away from focusing on incentives, allowing the company to keep its
1991 price increase average to less than 1 percent, a company
executive says.
   Thursday's announcement of a tentative price increase follows an
announcement last week that Ford Motor Co. would boost prices on
its 1991 cars by an average of 3.2 percent and truck prices would
rise 3.6 percent.
   General Motors Corp. has not announced tentative 1991 prices.
   Generally, the prices announced in midsummer are for dealers
placing large orders, especially for rental-car company fleets.
There is a chance that prices will change before the vehicles are
offered for retail sale.
   Chrysler Motors Chairman Bennett Bidwell said Thursday that part
of the company's pricing strategy includes reducing the
significance of cash rebates and low-interest financing in buying
and selling a car.
   ``We would hope to de-escalate the use of incentives,'' Bidwell
said, adding, however, ``No one, certainly not Chrysler, is going
to turn this parade around.''
   Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca blamed incentive costs, which have
been averaging more than $1,000 for every car and truck it sells,
for causing a drop in second-quarter earnings to $180 million, down
47.2 percent from the same time last year.
   GM, which reported a 40 percent profit decline, and Ford, whose
profits fell by 45 percent, said they also were hurt by the cost of
incentives, as well as by economic problems in Brazil.
   GM won't say precisely how much it spent on incentives during
the quarter. Ford put its average cost at $1,050 per vehicle.
   Chrysler will lower by $1,100 the sticker price on the Dodge
Monaco LE. The Dodge Dynasty will cost $560 more than this year.
   All the comparisons involve comparably equipped vehicles.
Popular optional equipment on one model year's vehicles often is
included as standard equipment on later models. That boosts the
price and makes year-to-year comparisons difficult.
   Also muddying year-to-year comparisons is padding the automaker
builds into prices for incentives.
   ``We've allowed allowances for rebates and incentives in the '91
prices,'' Bidwell said.

<TEXT>
   A federal judge has appointed an attorney to
oversee the operation of Stotler Funds Inc., a company controlled
by Karsten Mahlmann before his resignation as chairman of the
Chicago Board of Trade.
   Attorney Kenneth M. Rosenzweig was named special master on
Thursday by U.S. District Judge Milton Shadur.
   Rosenzweig has broad powers to monitor the affairs of Stotler
Funds. A special master was appointed at the request of the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
   CFTC attorneys had charged in an emergency lawsuit filed
Wednesday that two of Stotler Funds' investment pools had defrauded
customers by making $5.6 million in unauthorized loans and
investments to its parent company, Stotler Group Inc.
   At one point in a hearing Thursday, CFTC attorney Judith Goodie
expressed concern about whether the funds were protected from
further alleged misappropriation.
   ``Were there to be a continuation of the same kind of
practice,'' said Shadur, ``this case would be a strong candidate
for referral to the U.S. attorney's office.''

<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Procter &amp; Gamble Co. says it plans to more
than double the size of its bar soap operation at the plant where
it has made Ivory soap since 1886.
   The project will cost about $200 million and will include a
65,000 square foot expansion to the Ivorydale plant in the suburb
of St. Bernard, the company said Thursday. Construction is to begin
in October and should finish by next summer.
   ``This project will ensure that we have a state-of-the-art soap
operation that is ready to meet business and competitive challenges
well into our second century,'' said Ken McWhorter, the site
manager.
   The Ivorydale plant now employs about 750 people. The expansion
will create about 50 new jobs, P&amp;G said.
   Procter &amp; Gamble makes a large variety of food, personal care
and consumer products. It reported sales of $21.4 billion last
fiscal year.
   Along with Ivory soap, the Ivorydale complex makes powdered
laundry detergent, household cleaning products, food and industrial
chemicals.

   The stock market sold off sharply for the second
straight session today as a new report on employment intensified
recession worries.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials tumbled 53.71 points to
2,810.89 in the first half hour of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by nearly 4 to 1 among New York Stock
Exchange-listed issues, with 222 up, 862 down and 362 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 40.68 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   The Labor Department reported this morning that nonfarm payroll
employment fell by 219,000 in July, surprising analysts who had
been looking for a modest increase.
   The civilian unemployment rate jumped three-tenths of a
percentage point, to 5.5 percent.
   Those figures reinforced concern in the financial world that
economic activity was weakening more than had been thought just a
few weeks ago.
   Many observers fear that the problem could be compounded by a
jump in oil prices arising from Iraq's invasion of Kuwait this week.
   At its early low the Dow Jones industrial average was down about
60 points. Then ``bargain-hunting'' traders began to appear to
provide a bit of support to the market.
   Among actively traded blue chips, International Business
Machines dropped | to 109&lsqb;; Philip Morris { to 46&lsqb;; Johnson &amp;
Johnson ~ to 67~, and Wal-Mart Stores \ to 29|.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
3.37 to 188.99. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down 2.23 at 349.82.
   On Thursday the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 34.66
points to 2,864.60.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by more than 5 to 2 on the
NYSE, with 458 up, 1,207 down and 351 unchanged.
   Big Board volume came to 253.09 million shares, up from 176.81
million in the previous session and the heaviest total since a
416.29 million-share daay last Oct. 16.

<TEXT>
   The makers of late-night television's
``infomercials'' are forming their industry's first trade
association.
   ``It's a watershed,'' infomercial marketer Greg Renker said
Thursday in announcing the formation of the National Infomercial
Marketing Association to ``work with Congress and the staff of the
Federal Trade Commission in developing advertising standards'' for
the industry.
   ``It gives us legitimacy in the eyes of Capitol Hill and
consumers, and it establishes us as a long-term industry,'' said
Renker, whose Palm Desert, Calif.-based Guthy-Renker Corp. markets
self-help and motivational courses.
   Infomercials, or program-length commercials, have had a
checkered history since they were introduced in the mid-'80s, often
masking as talk shows or ``Investigative'' news specials that
actually hawked a product.
   Thousands of complaints over the years prompted U.S. Rep. Norman
Sisisky, D-Va., to hold hearings on the industry before the House
Small Business subcommittee that he chairs. Leaders of the
infomercial industry met with Sisisky last week as they worked to
form the association.
   ``If this is a sincere effort to address the problem of
infomercial advertising abuses, it is a welcome development and a
victory for consumers,'' Sisisky said Thursday.
   The infomercial marketers also met separately with Barry Cutler,
director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection, which has
filed six ``law enforcement actions'' against infomercial makers in
the past few months.
   ``We want to encourage the FTC to nail infomercial producers who
make false and misleading claims or are deceptive,'' Renker said.
``We want to discourage them from lumping us all into the same
category and creating laws and regulations that hurt our sales
effectiveness in the long term.''
   The biggest players in the industry attended the Washington
meetings and are joining the association, which plans to hold its
first meeting on Sept. 13 in Washington, D.C.
   In addition to Guthy-Renker, they included New York City-based
Synchronal Corp., and the Phildelphia-area based companies American
Telecast, Quantum Marketing International Inc. and Media Arts
International Inc.
   ``One of the frustrating elements of our new association is that
the television stations are the gatekeepers,'' Renker said. ``They
must take responsibility for the programming time that they sell,
and it is incumbent on them to recognize association members and to
scrutinize those who do not have a proven track record in the
industry.''

   The nation's unemployment rate jumped to 5.5
percent in July _ the highest jobless rate in two years, the
government said today in a report providing mounting evidence of a
weak economy.
   The Labor Department said that July's 0.3 percentage point rise,
up from the June jobless rate of 5.2 percent, put the American
unemployment rate at its highest level since it hit 5.6 percent in
August 1988.
   The sharp increase in unemployment was due largely to the
economy's loss of 219,000 jobs, the government said. Though about
160,000 of those Americans who lost jobs were temporary census
workers laid off by the government, private industry payrolls also
lost 45,000 jobs.
   The report shows that the ``economy appears to be caving in to a
full-fledged recession,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist at the
Boston Co.
   Other analysts said the unemployment data showed an economy
skirting the edge of a recession.
   ``The economy is just hung up on a rock on the middle of the
road. It's still an economy thats inching ahead, but at a glacial
pace ... We're close to the edge. It wouldn't take much of a breeze
to push us over,'' said Robert Dederick, chief economist at the
Northern Trust Co. of Chicago.
   Janet Norwood, commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics,
noted that weak job growth had spread to the nation's service
sector.
   That sector had been ``the major engine of job growth during the
current economic expansion. But that engine seems to have sputtered
in July,'' Mrs. Norwood said.
   On Wall Street today, the stock market sold off sharply. In
early trading, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials tumbled
53.71 points to 2,810.89.
   Job losses in the private sector were largely due to the
continuing deterioration in the nation's construction and
manufacturing sectors, the government said.
   Many analysts were bracing for even worse unemployment news in
the months ahead as the impact of a prolonged period of economic
sluggishness begins to force the jobless rate higher.
   Today's report provides the first indication of whether the
economy fared any better so far in the third quarter than earlier
in the year. Analysts were disturbed by government data last week
that showed the economy grew at an annual rate of just 1.2 percent
from April through June.
   The unemployment rate is derived from a household survey by the
Labor Department, while job growth numbers are figured from a
separate survey of business establishments. The job growth survey
is often considered a more reliable indicator of economic activity.
   Construction payrolls fell by 50,000 jobs, after seasonal
adjustment, posting the fifth consecutive decline to reflect
continued weakness in the housing market, the government said. The
number of jobs in the construction industry is more than 100,000
below the level of last fall, the government said.
   The nation's manufacturing slump continued in July, but factory
job losses were not as great as they have been in the past. Last
month, factory payrolls fell by 7,000 jobs, marking the 15th time
in 16 months that manufacturing jobs declined.
   Since reaching a post-recession peak in March 1989, nearly
350,000 factory jobs have been lost.
   Meanwhile, the service sector, which has been carrying the
economy in past months, began to show weakness as well, the
government said. Service sector jobs fell by 160,000, but that
number included temporary census workers.
   Still, several industries within the service sector lost small
numbers of jobs, including wholesale trade, finance, insurance and
real estate and business services. Retail trade added 20,000 jobs.
   Health services, which had added an average of 50,000 jobs each
month in the first half of this year, expanded by only half that
amount in July by adding 25,000 new jobs.
   Labor costs, which have been rising and are being blamed for
worsening the nation's inflation problems, continued to speed up.
   Average hourly earnings posted a 0.6 percent rise in July to
$10.09, up from the $10.03 the average worker earned per hour in
June.
   The Labor Department's household survey showed that overall,
total civilian employment was about 118 million in July, down from
the 118.4 million employed in June.
   The jobless numbered 6.8 million, up from 6.4 million employed
in June.
   The average manufacturing work week was down slightly in July,
falling from 41 hours to 40.9 hours. Manufacturing overtime was 3.7
hours in July, a slight decline from June's average of 3.8 overtime
hours.
   Last month's 5.5 percent unemployment rate pushed it beyond the
level it has held for more than a year. Since September 1988, the
jobless rate, before last month, had fluctuated within a tenth of a
percentage point of 5.3 percent, except for March 1989, when it hit
a 15-year low of 5 percent.

<HEAD>Japan's Current Account Surplus Up 12.2 Percent in June</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The surplus in the broadest measure of Japan's
trade rose 12.2 percent in June from a year earlier, snapping two
consecutive months of decline, the Finance Ministry said Friday.
   The surplus in the current account, the widest measure of a
nation's trade in goods and services, widened to $4.78 billion from
$4.26 billion in June 1989, according to the ministry.
   The June increase followed a 57.5 percent decline in the current
account in May on a year-on-year basis. In May, the surplus stood
at $1.46 billion.
   Finance Ministry officials attributed the rise in the current
account surplus to higher exports and a decline in oil prices. But
they added that it was too early to determine whether the downward
trend had fully reversed.
   The merchandise trade surplus for June rose 8.0 percent from a
year earlier to $7.05 billion on an unadjusted basis.
   Exports rose for the first time in nine months, increasing 3.3
percent to $23.10 billion. Imports rose to $16.05 billion, up 1.4
percent from a year earlier.
   Exports and imports in the current account are measured when
contracts are settled and are different from the customs-clearance
trade figures which are announced separately by the ministry each
month. The current account does not include breakdowns of trade
figures by country or region.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In an unusual move, Montgomery Ward &amp; Co. and
Sears, Roebuck and Co. have announced that they discussed and
rejected ``certain joint business opportunities.''
   In a statement Thursday, the two giant retailers declined to
indicate what the discussions entailed, and would not say whether
they entertained the possibility of a merger.
   The Chicago Tribune today cited unnamed sources at one of the
companies as saying the discussions began several months ago at the
suggestion of a Ward executive.
   The talks were preliminary and in the ``what if?'' realm, the
sources said.
   Spokesmen for both companies refused to comment on whether the
retailers had considered merging.
   ``Certain joint opportunities doesn't mean a merger,'' said
Charles H. Thorne, a spokesman for Montgomery Ward.
   ``We're standing on the statement as it has been provided,''
said Jerry Buldak, Sears' director of external communication.
   The companies released the announcements in Chicago, where they
are headquartered, and in New York.
   The announcement was in response to media inquiries, the
statements said.
   Sears is headed by Edward Brennan. His younger brother, Bernard,
is chief executive officer at Ward.
   Bernard Brennan has been credited with cutting Ward's debt by
closing its catalog division and selling the company's credit
operations.
   The chain was losing $385 million a year when Bernard Brennan
joined it in 1985. Last year, it reported net income of $150
million on sales of more than $5 billion.
   Sears is undergoing a massive corporate restructuring. It
reported net income of $1.51 billion in 1989, up from $1.45 billion
in 1988. Its earnings have been lower in the first two quarters of
1990, however.

   Grain and soybean futures prices were mixed in
early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade, amid worries
about the Persian Gulf situation.
   The crop markets opened lower, then turned mixed in a recovery
led by the soybean complex.
   Victor Lespinasse, an assistant vice president in the grain
trading division of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., said some of the
strength stemmed from continuing anxiety over the Persian Gulf
conflict, including fears that Iraq, having conquered Kuwait, may
invade Saudi Arabia.
   ``War is always bullish for commodities,'' he said.
   Analysts also said the soybean market was oversold and due for a
correction after a decline that began about six weeks ago.
   In early trading, wheat futures were 1 cent to 2 cents higher
with the contract for delivery in September at $2.84{ a bushel;
corn was unchanged to 2} cents higher with September at $2.52} a
bushel; oats were unchanged to 2{ cents lower with September at
$1.18} a bushel; soybeans were 5 cents to 6} cents higher with
August at $5.87 a bushel.
   Cattle futures were mostly lower in early trading on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange; pork futures were mostly higher.
   Live cattle futures were .15 cent lower to .05 cent higher with
August at 77.57 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent to .50
cent lower with August at 88.70 cents a pound; live hogs were .50
cent lower to .15 cent higher with August at 58.05 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .75 cent to 1.6 cents higher with August
at 47.75 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled sharply lower Thursday.

<HEAD>Phone Companies Ringing In The '90s With New Services</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The boss needs you to contact a client in
another part of the country right away, but you don't have the
phone number at your finger tips. Relax. Directory assistance can
dial it for you.
   And if you're expecting an important call at home? You can tell
whether a call is for you instead of your spouse by obtaining a
personalized telephone ring.
   These are just some of the newer services the nation's six
regional telephone companies are offering or plan to offer their
customers. Many more are on the way due to changing lifestyles and
the so-called Baby Bells' hunt for more revenue amid heightened
competition in the deregulated phone markets.
   ``It is a major new source of revenue,'' said Marianne Bye, an
industry analyst with Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. ``It's also a
high margin area for the company, meaning that it costs them very
little to provide.''
   Bell Atlantic Corp. in Philadelphia has been a leader in
providing these services, including the controversial ``Caller ID''
feature, industry analysts say. But similar services can be found
anywhere since the Baby Bells use basically the same technology and
get the computer software from the same vendors, they say.
   Clayton Brown, an analyst with A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons, said
telephone companies are only limited by the sophistication of their
network.
   ``Little by little, as they improve their network, they can
offer more and more services, which will enhance their revenue a
bit more,'' Brown said.
   For St. Louis-based Southwestern Bell Telephone Co. _ which
serves 9.5 million homes and businesses in Missouri, Kansas,
Arkansas, Oklahoma and Texas _ add-on services make up about 13
percent of billed revenue. More than half of its customers choose
to have at least one of the custom features, according to the
company.
   ``It's a significant revenue stream,'' said David Martin, a
Southwestern Bell spokesman. ``They cover their costs many times
over,''
   BellSouth Corp., based in Atlanta, anticipates about $65 million
in revenue this year from its add-on services. Spokesman Terry
Johnson said the company expects that amount to more than triple in
two years and increase sixfold by 1994 as technology improves and
regulatory matters are resolved.
   Other companies weren't able to provide a revenue breakdown.
   The most popular feature, the Baby Bells say, is ``Call
Waiting,'' which tells customers using a phone that there's another
incoming call and allows them to answer it. This feature is
available throughout most of the country. ``Call Forwarding,''
``Three-way Calling,'' and ``Speed Calling'' also are gaining in
popularilty and availability, experts say. At Southwestern Bell,
for instance, they're available in about 90 percent of the
company's territory.
   Costs usually range from $2 to $10 a month, according to the
companies.
   The most controversial feature is ``Caller ID,'' which displays
incoming numbers on a small video device as a way to thwart
unwanted callers. Promoted by Bell Atlantic, the feature costs
around $6.50 a month, plus another $60 to $80 for a small viewing
device that flashes an incoming number before the phone is answered.
   Businesses love this service, but it has come under fire from
privacy advocates and some states. A Pennsylvania court, for
instance, has outlawed it as a violation of wiretap laws.
   So far, six areas of the country have this service, and as many
as 22 states are debating whether to allow it.
   Some of the more unusual services in the early stages of
availability include:
   _A personalized telephone ring. Distinctive rings allow three
phone numbers to be combined on one phone line and let everyone
know who the phone is for when it ``ring RIIINNNGG rings'' for Dad
or ``ring ring RIIINNNGGGs'' for his oldest daughter. The feature
already is available on some office phone systems.
   _The ``lazy person's phone book.'' When a customer calls
directory assistance, a recorded voice provides the phone number
and, for a fee of around 30 cents, offers to dial the number.
   _The distinctive phone book listing. If your name is John Smith
and you want to stand out in a sea of John Smiths in the telephone
book, you can have your listing appear in ``sophisticated script''
or ``bold contemporary.'' The cost is around $6 initially, plus $3
a month.
   Jolene Meyer, Southwestern Bell's district manager of new
product development, said the most popular of the so-called second
phase of features is ``Call Return.''
   It allows customers to automatically call back the last incoming
call, whether or not they answered it. If the other line is busy,
they can hang up and Call Return will automatically keep dialing
the number and notify them with a special ring when the line is
free.
   ``Call Return is the most popular of the group I think because
it's comparable to Call Waiting,'' Meyer said. ``The customer
doesn't have to do anything. It's kind of passive _ when we're out
in the back yard and we hear the phone ring, we're reminded that we
have that service and we have the option of answering it now or
later.''
   A similar feature is ``Call Cue,'' which redials the last number
you attempted to call, and, if the other line is busy, will
continue redialing for you.
   Other features include ``Call Blocker,'' ``Call Trace,'' and
``Priority Call,'' which provides customers with a distinctive ring
for each of three pre-selected incoming phone numbers.
   Phone companies say that because of the technology involved in
linking central offices, a number of these services won't be
available to all their customers for five to 10 years.
   But they say the demand is definitely there.
   ``Our lifestyles are demanding more control,'' said Southwestern
Bell's Meyer. ``People are kind of tired of having their chains
pulled every time the phone rings.
   ``They have very busy, hectic lives. They put up with traffic
jams, stress at the office and when they get home they want to have
some control over who they talk to and when.''

   Middle East oil worries and heightened recession
fears sent waves of selling through the stock market today, driving
the Dow Jones industrial average nearly 100 points.
   Dow Jones's aaverage of 30 blue chips, down 34.66 on Thursday,
plunged 93.56 points to 2,771.04 by 1:30 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by more than 5 to 1 among New York
Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 241 up, 1,253 down and 338
unchanged.
   Selling also battered the over-the-counter market, where
technology stocks showed steep losses.
   The Labor Department reported this morning that nonfarm payroll
employment fell by 219,000 in July, surprising analysts who had
been looking for a modest increase.
   The civilian unemployment rate jumped three-tenths of a
percentage point, to 5.5 percent.
   Those figures reinforced concern in the financial world that
economic activity was weakening more than had been thought just a
few weeks ago.
   Many observers fear that the problem could be compounded by a
jump in oil prices arising from Iraq's invasion of Kuwait this week.
   Among actively traded blue chips, International Business
Machines dropped 1&lsqb; to 108|; Philip Morris 1{ to 45&lsqb;; Boeing 1} to
51}; General Electric 1| to 69, and General Electric 1| to 69.
   In the energy sector, by contrast, Exxon gained 1&rsqb; to 54|;
Texaco 1&lsqb; to 67 and Mobil 1{ to 68} as oil prices kept climbing.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
4.77 to 187.59 by 1 p.m. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down 5.41 at 346.74.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 169.46 million shares with three
hours to go.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. dollar fell today against most major
currencies in hectic European trading marked by rumors about
turmoil in the Middle East and a report that suggested weakness in
the U.S. economy.
   Gold prices were mixed.
   Dealers said the dollar took a nosedive early in the trading day
after U.S. unemployment figures for July were released.
   The government said the U.S. unemployment rate jumped to 5.5
percent in July from 5.2 percent in June, a larger increase than
had been expected. Traders moved quickly to sell the U.S. currency.
   The dollar's drop was cut short by continued fears of a further
escalation of hostilities in the Middle East, dealers said.
   ``The market is pessimistic about the U.S. economy, but that
isn't enough right now,'' said a dealer with a U.S. commercial bank
in London. ``The (Persian) Gulf news overrode it.''
   Market players said the dollar moved back and forth on rumors
that Iraqi troops, which invaded Kuwait early Thursday, had now set
their sights on Saudi Arabia.
   ``The market was very thin and chaotic and mostly affected by
rumors concerning the Middle East,'' said a trader at a large
Frankfurt bank.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose to close at 149.35 Japanese yen from
148.90 yen at Thursday's close. Later, in London, it rose to 149.85
yen. At midday in New York, the dollar was quoted at 150.35 yen.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.8570 from $1.8495 late
Thursday. In New York, the pound was quoted at $1.8537 at midday.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates
Thursday, included: 1.5920 West German marks, down from 1.5970;
1.3505 Swiss francs, down from 1.3570; 5.3345 French francs, down
from 5.3510; 1.7945 Dutch guilders, down from 1.7985; 1,164.90
Italian lire, down from 1,168.50, and 1.1510 Canadian dollars, down
from 1.1519.
   Selected midday dollar prices in New York included: 1.5930 West
German marks, 1.3560 Swiss francs, 1,165.75 Italian lire and
1.15125 Canadian dollars.
   Bullion dealers said the market was hectic with gold seesawing
in a broad range that illustrated the market's nervousness.
   ``The market wasn't based on logic today,'' said a Zurich
dealer. ``The market is reacting to every news item about the
Middle East crisis.''
   Gold rose in London to a late bid of $379.25 a troy ounce from
$378.75 late Thursday. In Zurich, the metal fell to a closing bid
of $378.00 an ounce from $379.00 late Thursday.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold rose to close at $375.75 an ounce,
down from $379.39 on Thursday.
   Silver bullion was unchanged in London from late Thursday's bid,
closing at $4.87 a troy ounce.

<HEAD>Dow Jones Tumbles More Than 100 Points At Mid-Afternoon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Stock prices plummeted in afternoon trading
today amid continued tension over Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, with
the Dow Jones industrial average skidding down more than 100 points.
   ``The Middle East remains a tinderbox,'' said Alan Ackerman, a
market strategist with Gruntal &amp; Co. ``It's unstable and
unpredictable.''
   The key Dow Jones average of 30 big industrial stocks was down
about 118 points in sustained selling shortly before 2 p.m. on Wall
Street.
   In the broader market, traders said over-the-counter stocks were
swamped with sell orders.
   The stock market was battered by fears that higher energy prices
worldwide resulting from the Iraqi invasion would trigger inflation
and further destabilize the U.S. economy.
   Already in a downslide because of recent reports of underlying
economic weakness, the market was hit with more bad economic news
this morning as the government reported higher unemployment in July.
   The Labor Department said nonfarm payroll employment fell by
219,000 in July, surprising analysts who had been looking for a
modest increase. The civilian unemployment rate jumped three-tenths
of a percentage point, to 5.5 percent.
   But market participants had their eye on Iraq, concerned that
while Kuwait's oil reserves may not be critical to world supplies,
further moves by Iraq could threaten oil from Saudi Arabia and
other nations.
   ``The real concern is how far will Iraq go in the Middle East,''
Ackerman said. ``There's an absence of superpower intervention.
Obviously there's a lot of nervousness worldwide.''
   The Dow industrials fell 34.66 points Thursday on fears that a
possible disruption of oil supplies could spark inflation and
recession in the United States.

<HEAD>Market Plunge Trips Circuit Breakers For Index Futures</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A plunge in stock-index futures prices today on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange tripped two ``circuit breakers''
intended to prevent a runaway stock-market collapse.
   The drop in index futures coincided with a plunge in the stock
market in response to disappointing economic news and fears of
escalating conflict in the Middle East.
   All Standard &amp; Poor's 500 stock-index futures contracts fell the
permitted opening limit of 5 points within the first 10 minutes of
trading, forcing exchange officials to declare a halt to trading
from 9:40 a.m. EDT to 9:42 a.m. EDT, according to Andrew Yemma, an
exchange spokesman.
   A second circuit breaker was triggered shortly after noon when
the near-month contract, for delivery in September, tumbled to
341.9, 12 points below Thursday's settlement. Under Merc rules,
selling below that level was prohibited for 30 minutes.
   S&amp;P 500 index futures are valued at $500 per point.
   The plunge in index futures coincided with a drop of more than
90 points in the Dow Jones industrial average after the Labor
Department reported the nation's unemployment rate jumped to 5.5
percent in July, the highest jobless rate in two years.
   The report was perceived as evidence of a weakening economy at a
time when the markets already were extremely jittery over the
possibly inflationary impact of skyrocketing crude oil prices
linked to Iraq's conquest of Kuwait.
   Stock-index futures are contracts for future deliveries of
baskets of stocks, such as the 500 stocks tracked by the S&amp;P 500
index. Investors buy and sell the contracts to hedge against losses
in the stock market or to speculate on stock-market moves.
   The Merc and the Chicago Board of Trade implemented the circuit
breakers after the stock-market crash of October 1987, which some
critics contended was exacerbated by trading strategies that employ
computers to trade huge blocks of stocks and index futures.

   At least 14 Americans are missing from Kuwait
oil fields and U.S. officials believe they are in Iraqi hands, a
State Department spokesman said today.
   There are no reports of injuries to Americans in the Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait, but the State Department was advising the
estimated 3,000 Americans in Kuwait and 500 in Iran to leave as
soon as they can, said spokesman Richard Boucher.
   He said, however, immediate departures would not be possible
from Kuwait because of the fighting and because all airport and
ports are closed.
   The U.S. Embassy in Baghdad contacted officials of the Iraqi
foreign ministry today to ask about the whereabouts of 14 missing
Americans and to remind the Iraqis ``of their commitment to
safeguard the safety of Americans,'' said spokesman Richard Boucher.
   In the early hours of the Iraqi invasion, which began before
dawn Thursday, Iraqi officials promised U.S. authorities in Baghdad
that Americans would not be harmed, Boucher said.
   He said privacy laws do not allow public disclosure of the
companies the missing Americans worked for or their names, but
another official said the Iraqis had been given those details and
information about the circumstances of the disappearances to help
in gaining their return.
   Iraq has provided no information about those missing, Boucher
said.
   The 14 were taken from three different oil fields near the
Iraqi-Kuwaiti border, Boucher said.
   ``We can't confirm they're in Iraqi control but we believe they
are,'' he said.
   Although the government gave no details about the missing,
family members of employees of Santa Fe Drilling Co. of California
said the company had contacted them about missing relatives.
   Larry Neal, a spokesman for Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, said State
Department officials indicated to him that most of the oil field
workers were employed by Santa Fe Drilling.
   A Shreveport, La., woman said she received a call from Santa Fe
Drilling that her husband, Donald G. Whatley, was missing. Whatley
has been working as a drilling supervisor for Santa Fe in Kuwait,
said Doris Whatley.
   She said Whatley had just returned to the oil operation after
vacationing in Shreveport.
   ``They took him from his rig this morning and they took him
across the border (to Iraq),'' she said Thursday. ``He just barely
had arrived there in time for them to take him off his rig.''
   Mrs. Whatley said she had not heard from State Department
officials about her husband, but officials of Santa Fe Drilling
called her to say he was missing.
   ``I don't want him to be forgotten like the rest of the hostages
in the Middle East have been,'' she said.
   In Gilmer, Texas, the family of Charles Amos, 56, said he was
among those rounded up by Iraqi soldiers. Amos also works for Santa
Fe, the family said.
   ``We are holding out for whatever information we can get,'' said
son David Amos.
   State Department officials told the Amos family that he'd been
moved by soldiers who invaded Kuwait on Thursday morning, the
younger Amos told KLTV and the Longview News-Journal.
   ``We were set to have a family reunion this weekend, and dad was
going to fly out of Kuwait'' early Thursday morning, said his
daughter, Karen Amos. ``But we got the call from the State
Department about 2 p.m.''
   Amos has been traveling and working overseas for more than 20
years, his son said.
   A short time before a State Department official disclosed the
suspected roundup of some Americans, President Bush was asked about
reports that American workers in Kuwait had been taken into custody.
   ``I don't have anything on that right now,'' he said.
``Secondly, it would affect us in a very dramatic way because I
view a fundamental responsibility of my presidency is protecting
American citizens. If they're put into harm's way I have certain
responsibilities.''

   Middle East oil worries and mounting recession
fears sent waves of selling through the stock market today, driving
the Dow Jones industrial average more than 100 points.
   Dow Jones's average of 30 blue chips plunged 123.51 points to
2,741.09 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street. The last time the average took a
bigger drop came in the ``mini-crash'' of last Oct. 13, when it
fell 190.58 points.
   Losers swamped gainers by about 7 to 1 among New York Stock
Exchange-listed issues, with 219 up, 1,417 down and 311 unchanged.
   Selling also battered the over-the-counter market, where
technology stocks showed steep losses.
   The Labor Department reported this morning that nonfarm payroll
employment fell by 219,000 in July, surprising analysts who had
been looking for a modest increase.
   The civilian unemployment rate jumped three-tenths of a
percentage point, o 5.5 percent.
   Those figures reinforced concern in the financial world that
economic activity was weakening more than had been thought just a
few weeks ago.
   Many observers fear the economy's problems could be compounded
by a jump in oil prices arising from Iraq's invasion of Kuwait this
week.
   Selling intensified today as reports reached Wall Street that
Iraqi forces were near the border of Saudi Arabia.
   Among actively traded blue chips, International Business

   Iraq's invasion of Kuwait continued to shake
financial markets today, but stock and bond prices got another jolt
from a disappointing report on unemployment that worsened fears
about inflation and a recession in the United States.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks tumbled more than
100 points at one time during the session on the double dose of bad
news before recouping slightly.
   Oil prices, which shot up Thursday after the Iraqi attack,
continued to climb today. Prices were boosted by the possibility
the invasion eventually could affect output from the two nations or
other members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
   The September contract for West Texas Intermediate, the
benchmark grade of U.S. crude, was up $1.94 to $25.05 a barrel by
mid-afternoon on the New York Mercantile Exchange after jumping
$1.57 on Thursday.
   In London, the spot price of North Sea Brent Blend, the most
widely traded international crude, was quoted at $23.25 a barrel
today, up 86 cents from Thursday, when the price rose $2 a barrel.
   The surge in oil prices came as a blow to other financial
markets already concerned about the weakening U.S. economy.
   With oil and other energy sources crucial for every segment of
the economy, rising crude prices can reinvigorate inflation. That
would make the Federal Reserve _ which considers fighting inflation
one of its top priorities _ less likely to move interest rates
lower as a means of stimulating the economy.
   ``The Fed is caught between a rock and a hard place,'' said Jack
Barbanel, president of First Global Asset Management Inc. ``They're
trying to support a weakening economy and at the same time keep
interest rates at a level to support foreign capital and keep
inflation under control.''
   The outlook worsened today as the Labor Department announced the
unemployment rate rose a sharp 0.3 percent to 5.5 percent in July.
The jump indicated a continuing slowing of the economy as private
companies lost 45,000 jobs from their payrolls.
   The report also carried bad inflation news: Average hourly
earnings posted a 0.6 percent rise to $10.09, up from the $10.03
the average worker earned per hour in June.
   The double blow of rising oil prices and a negative economic
outlook sent stock prices sharply lower.
   On Wall Street, the Dow industrial average skidded more than 100
points before rebounding slightly at mid-afternoon. The indicator
was down about 81 points at 2:30 p.m. EDT, at 2,783.42.
   The Dow Jones average, which tracks the movement of 30 blue chip
stocks, skidded 34.66 points on Thursday as traders grew uneasy
about the effect oil prices would have on corporate profits.
   Stock prices also tumbled overseas in response to the Iraqi
invasion.
   In Tokyo, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues shed
729.42 points, ending the day at 29,515.76. The index lost nearly
593 points on Thursday.
   Japan is especially vulnerable to the possibility of a
disruption of energy sources because it imports 99 percent of its
oil. Traders there are concerned that the oil price rise will take
a heavy toll on Japanese business.
   Bond prices were also hit hard by the unemployment report and
the prospect of higher inflation from rising oil prices.
   At midday today, the Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond was down
about $3.43 per $1,000 in face value after plunging more than $12
on Thursday. The bond's yield, considered a benchmark for interest
rates throughout the economy, rose to 8.48 percent from 8.46
percent late Thursday.
   Bond traders are concerned that inflation will erode the value
of their fixed-income holdings. They're also worried that interest
rates won't be dropping soon, as bond prices rise when rates
decline, so higher rates depress prices.
   The dollar first soared Thursday in response to the Iraqi
invasion and then gave up ground amid concern about the U.S.
economy.
   Today the dollar was little changed against most foreign
currencies, but made its biggest moves against the Japanese yen. In
early New York trading, the dollar was worth 149.965 yen, up from
149.30 late Thursday.

   The stock market took a sharp drop today in a
convulsive reaction to Middle East oil worries and mounting
recession fears.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down more than 120
points at its midsession low, showed a 69.55-point loss at 2,795.05
by 3 p.m. on Wall Street.
   The last time the average took a bigger drop within a single

   Soybean futures ended higher and grain futures
closed lower Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade in a see-saw
session influenced mainly by developments in the Persian Gulf.
   Traders closely followed news reports for indications of whether
Iraq was more likely to withdraw its invading troops from Kuwait or
push on into Saudi Arabia.
   ``War is always bullish for commodities,'' said Victor
Lespinasse, an assistant vice president in the grain-trading
division of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in Chicago.
   News that Iraqi troops were within six miles of the Saudi border
gave the markets a strong boost at midday. But as the close
approached, the grain markets were calmed by a report that Iraq had
indicated to the Soviet Union it planned to withdraw troops from
Kuwait.
   Soybeans remained higher on ideas that the market was due for a
rebound after falling for nearly six weeks.
   By the close, ``there was nothing too spectacular as far as
price movement, but there was a lot of stomach churning while
trading,'' said John Frazier, director of agriculture trading for
Gerald Inc. in Chicago.
   At the close, wheat futures were 2 cents to 4} cents lower with

<TEXT>
   National Intergroup Inc. on Friday reported a
net loss of $281.7 million in its first fiscal quarter of 1991 due
to reserves set aside to cover restructuring costs.
   The holding company, which has interests in metals and
pharmaceuticals, said it lost $13.01 per share in the three months
ended June 30, compared with a gain of nearly $13 million, or 53
cents a share, a year earlier.
   The company said it set aside $239.5 million in the most recent
quarter to cover anticipated losses on the sale of its Ben Franklin
stores and Permian Corp. subsidiaries.
   The company is selling most of its metals and other assets and
plans to move its headquarters to Dallas, where its remaining
asset, FoxMeyer Drug Co., is based.
   The company recorded a $26.7 million charge in the fiscal 1991
quarter associated with the closing of its Pittsburgh office and a
$14.8 million non-recurring charge reflecting the market value of
the preferred stock and expenses related to the sale of 20 percent
ownership of National Steel Corp. to NKK Corp. of Japan.
   Those losses were offset partially by a $12 million gain on the
sale of the company's information services subsidiary, Genix
Enterprises Inc., to MCN Corp., a holding company for Michigan
Consolidated Gas Co.
   ``Though the loss is significant, it clears the decks and allows
us to move forward with our plan to focus our attention and
resources on the drug distribution business,'' said Howard M. Love,
chairman and chief executive officer.
   FoxMeyer reported operating income increased 39 percent to $10
million in the first fiscal quarter from $7.2 million in the
year-ago period. Sales increased 15 percent to $666.8 million from
$577.2 million.
   The company's equity investment in National Steel Corp. resulted
in a net loss of $11.7 million in the first fiscal quarter,
compared with income of $16.2 million in the year-ago period.
   The decrease was due mostly to the change in the company's
ownership interest in National Steel, NII said.
   Centaur Partners of New York, the company's largest stockholder
with 16.5 percent of outstanding shares, has been vying for seats
on NII's board of directors.
   Centaur principals and Love said June 25 that the investor group
won enough votes at the company's annual election to fill three
seats on the 10-member board, keeping NII's candidates out.
   Centaur wants NII to sell FoxMeyer, the nation's third-largest
drug distributor, and give the proceeds to shareholders.

<HEAD>Accountants Must Say if They're Unlicensed, California Court Rules</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB EGELKO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Accountants without a license can practice
in California but have to call themselves ``unlicensed
accountants,'' according to a state appeals court ruling released
Thursday.
   In a 3-0 decision, the 1st District Court of Appeal upheld the
State Board of Accountancy's authority to allow only California's
55,000 certified public accountants to use the terms ``accountant''
or ``accounting,'' without other modification, in connection with
their business.
   But the court noted that state law does not require a license to
prepare financial reports or do most other accounting work.
Certified public accountants, who must meet state standards for
education and experience and pass a national examination, can
certify their audits and financial statements to lenders,
government agencies, stockholders and the public.
   People without licenses can call themselves accountants, the
court said, as long as they also state that they are unlicensed or
provide some other disclaimer saying their services do not require
a license.
   Because the Constitution provides some protection to free speech
in advertising, ``we must permit the use of those terms (such as
`accountant') if they are qualified by a warning or disclaimer that
avoids their misleading impact,'' said the opinion by Presiding
Justice Clinton White.
   The ruling is a partial victory but is far from satisfactory,
said Ralph Alldredge, a lawyer for the California Association of
Independent Accountants, a group of about 700 unlicensed
accountants. He said no decision has been made yet on an appeal.
   ``To call yourself an unlicensed accountant is a derogatory
term, almost,'' he said. ``It's a very negative way to have to
present yourself to the public.''
   Alldredge said no one knows how many unlicensed accountants work
in California. Because of state restrictions, he said, some list
themselves in telephone directories under bookkeeping or tax
services or business consulting, none of which accurately describes
their work.
   The association he represents joined Bonnie Moore, an unlicensed
San Francisco accountant with a college degree in accounting, in a
1986 suit challenging the state Board of Accountancy's regulations.
The board had ordered Moore and her firm to stop using the terms
``accounting'' and ``accountant'' in their business. San Francisco
Superior Court Judge Thomas Dandurand ruled in the board's favor.
   White noted that the U.S. Supreme Court has recognized
advertisers' right to free expression in truthful claims. Those
rulings indicate that practitioners such as Moore must be allowed
to tell the public they are accountants, as long as they specify
that they do not have or need a license for their work, White said.

<HEAD>Posts $33.3 Million Loss for Second Quarter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JONATHAN YENKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bank of New England Corp., which has shrunk under
the weight of troubled real estate loans, announced Friday it lost
more than $30 million in the second quarter.
   The financial report is the latest gloomy financial news for the
banking company, continuing a tumble that began late last year. The
company lost more than $1 billion in 1989, and $46.6 million in the
first quarter that ended March 31.
   In the second quarter, which ended June 30, the banking company
lost $33.3 million, or 49 cents per share, compared with earnings
of $36.5 million, or 52 cents per share, in the same period a year
earlier.
   Bank Chairman Lawrence Fish said in a statement that the company
has made ``slow but steady progress'' in trying to recover.
   But he said the loss was not unexpected ``because of the
continued sluggishness in the region's economy, the softness in the
real estate market, and lower net income.''
   The losses, in part, reflected how the bank has had to divert
money into reserves to cover bad loans.
   The bank's total non-performing assets, which include troubled
loans, totaled $2.78 billion, compared with $2.67 billion in the
first quarter.
   Gerard Cassidy, a bank analyst with Tucker Anthony Inc., said
the bank's assets were not deteriorating at the same rate as in the
past.
   ``But when you're at these levels, you need to see reduction in
non-performing assets, not smaller increases,'' he said. ``Overall,
the numbers are a continuation of a negative trend.''
   Bank of New England has been operating under federal orders
since early this year. The bank came under heightened government
scrutiny when a downturn in the economy and the real estate market
exposed mountains of bad loans.
   Part of the bank's strategy has been to sell off assets and
slash its work force to cut costs and raise money.
   The bank has reduced its workforce by 4,000 through a
combination of layoffs, attrition and the sale of assets. Since the
beginning of the year, the bank has sold more than $5 billion in
assets, said spokesman James Dorsey.
   The company has decided not to sell it subsidiary bank in Maine,
but is continuing discussions with possible buyers for its Rhode
Island subsidiary.
   The bank had been borrowing money from the Federal Reserve Bank
of Boston to meet immediate cash needs but stopped in mid-June.
Bank of New England officials said, however, ``this could change
from time to time.''
   The bank said it has been able to stabilize its deposits through
a campaign to attract certificates of deposit and by offering other
retail products.
   Through the first half of the year, the bank lost $79.9 million,
or $1.17 a share. That was slightly larger than the deficit of
$78.8 million, or $1.12 a share, in 1989's first half.
   Assets totaled $23.07 billion at the end of the first half, down
from $31.98 billion a year earlier.

<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co. on Thursday completed the
presentation of its first set of contract proposals to the United
Auto Workers union, leaving a UAW negotiator pleasantly surprised.
   ``What we got today indicated more than in '87 they heard our
demands and they're moving on them,'' said William Don Hammonds,
rank-and-file chairperson of the UAW negotiating team at Ford.
   Hammonds, plant chairperson of UAW Local 737 in Nashville,
Tenn., was a member of the 1987 union team that negotiated the
current contract with Ford.
   While the initial two weeks of negotiations have been cordial,
said Hammonds and UAW Vice President Ernest Lofton, lots of work
remains to reach a contract before the Sept. 14 deadline.
   ``Job security is still one of the things we have a great
difference on,'' Lofton said.
   The union has tapped job security as its top priority for
negotiations at General Motors Corp., Ford and Chrysler Corp. All
three contracts expire at the same time.
   Negotiations at Chrysler got off to a rocky start, UAW Vice
President Stan Marshall said last week. He said Chrysler made a
``mockery'' of the opening of talks by floating contract concepts
to the media before bringing them to the union.
   Since then, negotiators have been meeting at the main bargaining
table and taking turns making presentations. Few specific contract
proposals have changed hands.
   There has been little official word from the talks at GM.
Company and union negotiators have been meeting in subcommittees
focused on various sections of the contract, such as health and
safety, time off and scheduling.
   No specific economic proposals have been offered by either side
in all three sets of negotiations.
   Lofton said he didn't expect the union to make specific economic
offers until around Labor Day, when the UAW chooses one of the Big
Three as its negotiating ``target.''
   There's been a tradition in auto industry bargaining that the
UAW chooses one company, suspends negotiations at the other two
and, eventually, reaches an agreement with the first.
   That contract then is more or less imposed on the other
automakers with little change.
   There has been speculation this year that the pattern may be
broken by Chrysler. Chrysler's chief negotiator, Anthony St. John,
has said simply continuing the current contract would increase
labor costs by about 16 percent, an increase Chrysler can't afford.
   At news conferences following the opening of negotiations at
each of the Big Three, UAW President Owen Bieber said the union had
no intention of breaking the tradition.
   He said the union had worked too hard to bring the three
contracts back in line with common expiration dates. It's the first
time in 11 years that the contracts expire at once.

  The dollar climbed against most major currencies
Friday in volatile trading as dealers divided their attention
between news on the Persian Gulf crisis and evidence the U.S.
economy may be on the verge of recession.
   Gold prices posted minor gains and losses in worldwide trading.
   Investors unloaded dollars early in the U.S. trading day,
reacting to the latest economic statistics from Washington. A Labor
Department report showing the nation's unemployment rate shot up to
5.5 percent in July from 5.2 percent in June sparked the selloff.
   Analysts said the report, which furnished one of the first
insights into the economy's performance last month, flashed
recession warning signals. The July jobless rate was the highest
since it hit 5.6 percent in August 1988.
   But the turmoil in the Middle East in the wake of Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait kept dealers on guard against selling dollars
aggressively.
   The jump in oil prices since Iraq invaded neighboring Kuwait
early Thursday has been a key reason for the dollar's advance. Oil
transactions are conducted in dollars.
   ``There still was a great deal of buying interest,'' said Kevin
Lawrie, treasury manager at the Bank of Boston's office in New
York. ``No one's comfortable going home short of dollars over the
weekend when anything can happen out there.''
   Rumors that Iraqi troops had begun an assault on Saudi Arabia
signalled an escalation in the Persian Gulf conflict and
temporarily gave investors an extra incentive to buy dollars as a
safe haven currency.
   When word came later in the session that Iraq planned to
withdraw its troops from Kuwait over the weekend, the dollar buying
subsided somewhat.
   By the time trading was done in New York, the dollar stood at
149.925 Japanese yen, up from 149.30 yen Thursday. In Tokyo, the
dollar rose to close at 149.35 Japanese yen from 148.90 yen at
Thursday's close. Later, in London, it rose to 149.85 yen.
   Sterling's value against the dollar dipped in the United States.
One British pound fetched $1.85375 late in New York, compared to
$1.8545 late Thursday. In London, the pound rose to $1.8570 from
$1.8495 late Thursday.
   Selected late dollar rates in New York, compared with Thursday's
late quotes, included: 1.5935 German marks, up from 1.5910; 1.3505
Swiss francs, down from 1.3530; 5.3415 French francs, up from
5.3320; 1,166.00 Italian lire, up from 1,164.50; and 1.15125
Canadian dollars, unchanged.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with Thursday's late
levels were: 1.5920 West German marks, down from 1.5970; 1.3505
Swiss francs, down from 1.3570; 5.3345 French francs, down from
5.3510; 1.7945 Dutch guilders, down from 1.7985; 1,164.90 Italian
lire, down from 1,168.50, and 1.1510 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1519.
   Bullion dealers overseas said the precious metals markets were
hectic with gold seesawing in a broad range. Domestic dealings were
more subdued.
   Gold for current delivery settled at $377.40 a troy ounce, up 60
cents on on New York's Commodity Exchange. Republic National Bank
later quoted a troy ounce of gold at $377.25, 35 cents higher than
Thursday's late bid.
   In London, gold rose to a late bid of $379.25 a troy ounce from
$378.75 late Thursday. In Zurich, the metal fell to a closing bid
of $378 an ounce from $379 late Thursday. Earlier in Hong Kong,
gold closed at $375.75 an ounce, down from $379.39 on Thursday.
   Silver prices changed little. On New York's Comex, silver for
current delivery settled at $4.842 a troy ounce, up from $4.835
Thursday. Silver bullion was unchanged in London from late
Thursday's bid, closing at $4.87 an ounce.

<HEAD>Macy Sells 1 Percent Stake; Says Agreement With Lenders Amended</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   R.H. Macy &amp; Co. Inc. on Thursday said its senior
bank lenders have agreed to modify an agreement, making it slightly
more lenient, which will give the retailer greater financial
flexibility as it enters the important fall season.
   The New York-based retailer also said it has agreed to sell a 1
percent equity interest to the real estate development group
Corporate Property Investors for $15 million in cash. Four other
property developers already hold investments in Macy's.
   The decision to sell the stake to Corporate Property Investors
recognizes ``our long-standing, ongoing relationship and
prospective future real estate activities,'' Macy's said.
   Proceeds from the sale will be used to buy back its debt from
time to time in the open market, Macy's said in a letter to its
investors.
   The retailer periodically releases such letters to update
investors on its financial condition. A copy was distributed to
news media.
   The letter said Macy's conservative inventory management and
expense plan for the spring appear to have paid off.
   Macy's had more cash available in late spring than it expected
to have, possibly indicating that the department store operator is
weathering the current poor retail environment better than private
analysts anticipated.
   ``Our cash availability was almost $65 million higher for the
25th week this spring, when our needs peaked, than the $113 million
projected in February to our banks and the factors,'' Macy's said.
   ``We are confident that this conservative approach will ensure a
continuation of our liquid position in spite of a continuing soft
retail environment,'' it said.
   The modification in the loan agreement reduced the amount of
cash Macy's must have in relation to its debt.
   Macy's said the bank agreement didn't need to be modified until
the end of October. But the company's lead bank lenders suggested
that the amendment be made now ``so there would be no question
about Macy's financial flexibility and liquidity as we enter the
important fall season.''
   The letter, signed by three executives including chairman Edward
S. Finkelstein, said Macy's is reviewing a number of ways to reduce
its interest costs. It didn't give specifics and said investors
would be advised of Macy's debt cost-reduction plans as they
develop.

<HEAD>Stocks Plummet, Bonds Tumble on Economic, Gulf War Speculation</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rising unemployment and fears of spreading
Middle East conflict blasted the financial markets Friday. Stocks
plummeted and interest rates jumped on speculation the battered
U.S. economy could get worse.
   Feeding the turmoil was the government's report that
unemployment rose 0.3 points to 5.5 percent in July, another sign
the economy might be slipping into recession.
   Adding to the mix was the second straight day of sharply rising
oil prices, a possible harbinger of higher inflation that could
squeeze business and consumers alike.
   Weakened by the two-pronged fear, stock prices began tumbling
early.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 blue chip industrial stocks fell
more than 118 points by mid-afternoon. The sell-off was so swift
that temporary ``circuit breaker'' halts in trading of Standard &amp;
Poor's 500-stock index futures were triggered twice on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange.
   Nevertheless, the market rallied in later trading. The Dow
finished down 54.95 at 2,809.65, extending its 34.66-point drop of
Thursday.
   Helping grease the stock drop was a surge by interest rates in
the long-term bonds, as traders reacted to the growing signs of
higher inflation. The yield on the bellwether 30-year Treasury bond
finished at 8.56 percent, up from 8.45 percent late Thursday and
8.35 percent on Wednesday.
   Both markets reacted to the rise in oil prices, which have shot
higher since immediately after Iraq invaded Kuwait on Thursday
morning.
   Oil prices rose on speculation that supplies could be affected
if the invasion escalated into an attack on neighboring Saudi
Arabia, the world's biggest crude exporter.
   Such rumors periodically sent long-term bond prices lower, but
Iraq announced late in the day it planned to begin withdrawing its
troops from Kuwait on Sunday.
   The September contract for West Texas Intermediate, the
benchmark grade of U.S. crude, traded up more than $2.50 a barrel
at one point before settling at $24.49, up $1.38 from Thursday's
close on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract rose $1.57
on Thursday.
   The surge in oil prices has been a blow to markets already
concerned about the health of the U.S. economy. A sustained rise in
crude prices is seen as boosting inflation, which reduces the
chance the Federal Reserve will push interest rates lower to
stimulate the economy.
   In foreign exchange, the dollar climbed against most major
currencies in volatile trading as dealers divided their attention
between the economic and Middle East news.
   The dollar rose to 149.925 Japanese yen in New York from 149.30
yen Thursday. Against the West German mark, the dollar rose to
1.5935 from 1.5910.
   Stock prices also tumbled overseas Friday in response to the
Iraqi invasion.
   In Tokyo, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues shed
729.42 points, ending the day at 29,515.76. The index lost nearly
593 points on Thursday.
   Japan is especially vulnerable to the possibility of a
disruption of energy sources because it imports 99 percent of its
oil. Traders there are concerned that the oil price rise will take
a heavy toll on Japanese business.
   In London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index
fell 19.9 points, or 0.9 percent, to 2,284.6.

<TEXT>
   Long-term bond prices plunged again Friday as
high unemployment and Middle East tensions battered the
rumor-riddled credit markets.
   But short-term interest rates were hammered down after the Labor
Department reported that the nation's unemployment rate shot up to
5.5 percent in July from 5.2 percent in June.
   The report was another sign that the nation's faltering economy
may be heading into a recession, which could herald lower interest
rates. In the short end of the market, it temporarily overshadowed
another day of inflation worries triggered by rising oil prices
after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond tumbled 1&lsqb; points, or
$11.25 per $1,000 in face value, on top of losses Thursday of more
than $12. The bond's yield, which rises when the bond's price
falls, climbed to 8.56 percent from 8.45 percent late Thursday.
   Economists said the unemployment report combined with a wave of
other negative economic data in recent days normally would give the
Federal Reserve enough reason to lower interest rates, which would
boost bond prices.
   That sentiment was reflected among shorter maturity bills and
bonds. But the longer end of the market was gripped by the belief
that the spike in oil prices would fuel inflation worldwide.
   Inflation, which the Fed seeks to control through monetary
policy, erodes the value of fixed-income securities such as bonds.
   ``The data was weak enough under normal circumstances to make
people think the Fed would certainly ease,'' said James Capra,
senior vice president with Shearson Lehman Government Securities
Inc. ``But now the issue is will the oil prices move cause the Fed
to pause or wait.''
   Economists are concerned that a Fed lower interest during a time
of price concerns, fanning inflation.
   Last month's jobless rate was the highest since it hit 5.6
percent in August 1988.
   The sharp increase largely reflected the economy's loss of
219,000 jobs. Though about 160,000 of those Americans who lost jobs
were temporary census workers laid off by the government, private
industry payrolls also lost 45,000 jobs, the government said.
   ``The market is trading in wide swings,'' Capra said. ``It's
made it difficult for anyone but those with the strongest of
views.''
   The long end of the market was wracked by speculation about
events in the Middle East, including unconfirmed rumors that Iraq
was poised to possibly invade Saudi Arabia following its seizure of
Kuwait.
   A serious escalation of hostilities in the region could push oil
prices even higher, worsening the inflation and economic outlook.
However, late in the day, Iraq said it planned to begin removing
its troops from Kuwait on Sunday.
   Prices of short-term governments rose &lsqb; point, intermediate
maturities ranged from unchanged to down 13-32 point and long-term
issuestumbled 21-32 point to 31-32 point, according to Telerate
Inc., a financial information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, fell 2.66 to 1,164.71.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills tumbled to 7.55 percent as
the discount dropped 10 basis points to 7.32 percent. Yields on
six-month bills fell to 7.57 percent as the discount dropped 9
basis points to 7.21 percent. Yields on one-year bills plunged to
7.55 percent as the discount lost 12 basis points to 7.06 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each
other on overnight loans, was quoted at 7} percent, down from 8
percent late Thursday.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds closed at 92}, down &rsqb;. The average yield to
maturity rose to 7.34 percent from 7.31 percent late Thursday.

<HEAD>Persian Gulf Developments, Recession Fears Roil Commodity Markets</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Repeating to delete second display</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Recession fears, inflation worries and conflicting reports from
the Persian Gulf ricocheted through U.S. commodity markets Friday,
resulting in price moves with little relation to supply and demand
factors.
   ``It seemed like a lot of attention was focused on what the
latest rumors were,'' observed Tim Evans, a copper trader with Deak
International Inc., a New York-based dealer of metals and
currencies.
   Oil futures ended sharply higher despite active selling late in
the session; precious metals were higher; copper futures fell;
livestock and meat were mixed; and grains and soybeans were mixed.
   Commodity traders kept close watch on stock and crude-oil
markets, where changing news reports about the Iraq-Kuwait
situation caused wild price swings that rippled out to other
markets.
   ``War is always bearish for stocks and bullish for
commodities,'' said Victor Lespinasse, an assistant vice president
in the grain-trading division of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. in
Chicago.
   The Persian Gulf situation seemed very bullish for commodities
early in the day when rumors circulated that Iraqi troops had
invaded Saudi Arabia from Kuwait, which probably would result in
further disruptions of crude oil shipments to the United States.
   Those rumors were discounted but news reports then surfaced that
Iraqi troops were just six miles from the Saudi border, causing
another plunge in stock prices and sharp gains in many commodities.
   Newswires then reported Iraq had told the Soviet Union it
planned to withdraw from Kuwait, prompting a strong rally on the
stock market and selling in the commodity markets, particularly in
crude oil.
   After most market had closed, reports came out that the Iraqi
government would begin withdrawing troops from Kuwait on Sunday.
   To further complicate matters, the Labor Department reported
Friday that nonfarm payroll employment fell by 219,000 in July and
unemployment jumped three-tenths of a percentage point to 5.5
percent.
   The figures reinforced concern in the financial world that
economic activity was weakening more than had been thought just a
few weeks ago.
   The recession fears weighed heavily on the copper market, which
is especially sensitive to signs of economic weakness, and on the
stock market. The Dow Jones industrial average fell more than 120
points early in the afternoon, but recovered to finish with a loss
of about 55 points.
   A similar plunge in stock-index futures prices tripped two
``circuit-breakers'' in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index futures
trading pit at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The circuit
breakers are a series of trading halts and price limits intended to
stop a runaway stock-market collapse.
   The contract for September delivery of the 500 stocks tracked by
the index settled 6.62 points lower at 344.86. The contract is
valued at $500 a point.
   Copper futures settled 2.4 cents to 3.4 cents lower on New
York's Commodity Exchange with the contract for delivery in August
at $1.261 a pound.
   Skyrocketing oil futures contributed to inflation fears, which
prompted buying in the precious metal and soybean markets.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate
crude oil settled 68 cents to $1.38 higher with September at $24.49
a barrel; wholesale heating oil was .20 cent to 2.06 cent higher
with September at 66.58 cents a gallon; wholesale unleaded gasoline
was .70 cent to 4.11 cents higher with September at 72.18 cents a
gallon.
   Gold futures ended 20 cents to 60 cents higher on the Commodity
Exchange with August at $377.90 a troy ounce; silver was 0.5 cent
to 0.7 cent higher with August at $4.842 a troy ounce.
   On the Chicago Board of Trade, wheat futures settled 2 cents to
4{ cents lower with September at $2.80{ a bushel; corn was 1\ cents
to 3\ cents lower with September at $2.49{ a bushel; oats were 4}
cents to 7 cents lower with September at $1.14 a bushel; soybeans
were 1 cent lower to 6\ cents higher with August at $5.86{ a bushel.
   On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, live cattle were .03 cent to
.53 cent lower with August at 77.17 cents a pound; feeder cattle
were .10 cent to .45 cent lower with August at 88.47 cents a pound;
live hogs were .65 cent lower to .35 cent higher with August at
57.90 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were 1.1 cents to 1.75
cents higher with August at 48.55 cents a gallon.

<HEAD>Court Approves Takeover Agreement, Company Announces Loss</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Allegheny International Inc. said Friday
federal bankruptcy court had approved of an agreement giving a New
York investment group control of the maker of Sunbeam and Oster
appliances.
   The company also announced $32.1 million in losses in its fiscal
1990 third quarter as consumer-products divisions posted decreased
operating earnings.
   The U.S. Bankruptcy Court approval will allow the investors,
Japonica Partners, to take control of Allegheny on Aug. 15. The
deal, announced Thursday by committees representing company
creditors and shareholders, is contingent on Japonica's ability to
raise enough money.
   Allegheny's senior managers and board members would be ousted on
that date by Japonica's handpicked managers and a board comprising
nominees from Allegheny, bank creditors and unsecured creditors.
   The executive committee of Allegheny International's board of
directors, which had opposed Japonica's assuming a position of
power, unanimously approved the settlement Thursday. The full board
ratified the deal Friday.
   Allegheny International filed for protection from creditors
under Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy laws in February 1988.
   The company, to be renamed Sunbeam-Oster Companies Inc.,
initially will remain a publicly traded company. But Japonica is
expected to own 90 percent of the stock, creditors' lawyers said at
a bankruptcy court hearing.
   Japonica has said it intends to keep company headquarters in
Pittsburgh, where Allegheny International employs about 60 people.
   The agreement would distribute stock and warrants to creditors
and shareholders as specified in management's reorganization plan,
but would require Japonica to buy the securities from anyone who
wants to sell.
   The price would be $7 per share or $1.53 per warrant, except for
bank creditors, who have agreed to accept $6.60 per share.
Creditors would have the option of keeping their stock.
   Japonica would combine about $270 million in cash Allegheny
International has on hand with $97 million in equity it has
received from its primary investors to repay the company's bank
lenders and trade creditors of the company's operating units.
   Japonica also would have to provide $100 million in working
capital for the company's operations and a $10 million letter of
credit to fund administrative expenses incurred after Aug. 15.
   The group also would have to honor severance agreements for
Allegheny International's senior managers, which would cost $5.3
million.
   Japonica already has invested about $125 million to buy claims
against Allegheny International, entitling it to receive about half
of the reorganized company's stock.
   Japonica has said it intends to appoint William Webber, who ran
the Sunbeam unit in the early 1980s, president of the reorganized
company.
   In its earnings statement for the three months ended July 1,
Allegheny International reported a loss of $3.51 per share,
compared with a net loss of $15.3 million, or $2.10 a share, in the
year-ago period.
   Sales increased 1 percent to $237.3 million from $234.9 million.
   For the fiscal 1990 nine-month period, the company reported a
net loss of $42.6 million, or $5.89 a share, compared with a loss
of $18.2 million, or $3.75 a share, in the year-ago period.
   Sales in the nine-month period fell 3 percent to $704.8 million
from $730.2 million.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Upholds Agency's Right To Sue for Racketeering</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB EGELKO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court ruled Friday that
an agency created by Congress to protect securities investors can
sue fraudulent brokers for racketeering and seek triple damages.
   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the Securities
Investor Protection Corp., can use the powerful Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act in civil suits against
brokers.
   SIPC reimburses customers of failed brokers and can appoint a
receiver to sell or liquidate an insolvent broker who has violated
the law. If the broker's assets are not enough to pay claims, SIPC
uses its own funds, collected from member institutions.
   The agency moved in 1981 to liquidate two brokerages, First
State Securities Corp. and Joseph Sebag Inc., and said it had to
spend nearly $13 million of its own funds to pay customer claims.
   SIPC then sued in federal court in Los Angeles against six
companies and numerous individuals, claiming they had used the two
brokers as vehicles to manipulate the companies' stock in the
over-the-counter market.
   The lawsuit sought triple damages under RICO, claiming that the
stock fraud had been a ``pattern of racketeering activity.''
   A federal district judge dismissed the racketeering claim,
saying SIPC had neither bought nor sold the securities in question,
as required for a stock fraud suit. But the appeals court said RICO
suits are not limited to buyers or sellers of stock.
   Noting that the RICO law expressly covers ``any person injured
in his business or property by reason of a violation,'' the court
said the law made no reference to a requirement that a plaintiff be
a buyer or seller of securities.
   ``It is not appropriate for this court to impose such a
limitation,'' Judge David Thompson said in the 3-0 ruling
reinstating the RICO claim.
   Lawyers for both sides in the case said the ruling appeared
broad enough to apply to some defrauded private investors as well.
   ``People who weren't buyers or sellers of stock which was the
subject of manipulation could come in under RICO'' if they had
suffered losses, said Stephen Taylor, a lawyer for SIPC.
   ``I think it is a broadening of the law and would have wide
implications beyond SIPC,'' said Jack Mamet, a lawyer for defendant
Robert G. Holmes Jr., the founder and president of Aero Systems
Inc., one of the six companies whose stock was allegedly
manipulated.
   Mamet said a Supreme Court appeal would be considered.
   Depending on the ruling's interpretation, Mamet said, an
investor in a future case who held stock affected by fraud but who
had not been induced to buy or sell the stock because of the fraud
could be able to sue under RICO.
   SIPC is a nonprofit corporation whose membership consists of
most registered brokers and dealers. It was established in 1970
after the collapse of several brokerage houses.

<HEAD>Dollar Opens Higher, Share Prices Plunge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar opened higher against the Japanese yen
Friday morning, while share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange fell
following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   The dollar opened at 149.77 yen, up 0.87 yen from Thursday's
148.90-yen close.
   On the stock market, the 225-share Nikkei Stock Average quickly
dropped 609.89 points, or 2.02 percent, falling to 29,635.29 within
the first 30 minutes of morning trading.
   Following its strength against the yen in New York, the dollar
opened higher and continued to rise as market players kept an eye
on developments in the Iraq-Kuwait conflict, dealers said.
   Iraq invaded Kuwait and took control of its capital Thursday.
The United States announced it will impose economic sanctions
against Iraq, while the Soviet Union also decided to stop exporting
military weapons to the Middle Eastern nation.
   ``Market players are still buying the dollar as a safe
investment because of uncertainties in the Middle East situation,''
said Kimihiro Hashimoto, a trader with Chemical Bank in Tokyo.
   In New York, dealers unloaded yen due to concern that Japan
would be hurt more than any other major industrialized country by
disruptions in Mideast oil supplies. Japan depends on imports for
nearly all its oil needs.
   Hashimoto said the dollar's surge quickly reversed a recent
decline in the currency, but it might not lead to a long-term
upward trend.
   ``Dollar trading will be affected for a while by pessimistic
prospects for the U.S. economy and the Middle Eastern situation,''
Hashimoto said.
   Gloomy prospects for the U.S. economy makes the dollar less
attractive, while concern over the Middle East crisis encourages
buying the currency because the dollar is considered a safe haven
in times of uncertainty.
   On the stock market, traders said share prices were lower across
the board as the Iraq-Kuwait conflict continued to discourage
market players, prompting large-scale selling.
   But Yoshiro Inoue, an analyst with Nomura Securities Co., said
the general market sentiment reflected participants waiting for
Friday's release of the U.S. jobless rate for July.
   ``Because of the persistent pessimistic prospects of U.S.
economic growth, the dollar is not soaring that much today despite
the Middle East situation. This will help stock investors calm down
and support the market,'' he said.
   Other positive news for the market was a less-than-expected rise
in oil prices in Tokyo, he said.
   The October Brent oil contract was quoted at 22.90 dollars, up
nearly three dollars from Thursday.
   In bond dealings, the yield of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds rose to 7.660 percent from Thursday's
close at 7.615 percent. Their price fell to 84.91 points from 85.16
points.

   Ford Motor Co. said Friday it agreed to sell its
Ford Aerospace Corp. subsidiary to the defense electronics company
Loral Corp. for $715 million in cash.
   In addition, Loral will assume Ford Aerospace's liabilities and
assets. Loral Chairman Bernard Schwartz said the debt was small _
perhaps less than $10 million. Ford officials declined to say what
the liabilities were.
   Loral will more than double its size. The company now has about
13,000 employees and reported revenues of $1.3 billion and profits
of more than $75 million for the fiscal year ended March 31.
   Schwartz said the corporation wasn't worried about cuts in
Defense Department spending since his company is heavily involved
in sophisticated surveillance systems.
   ``We're not the metal-benders,'' he said. ``We're in the
high-tech portion of the business.''
   The sale, which is subject to government approval, moves Ford
closer to its goal of ridding itself of its non-automotive
businesses.
   On Tuesday, Ford said it would form a joint venture with the
Italian industrial giant Fiat Group, involving Ford's agricultural
implement maker Ford New Holland. Fiat will hold 80 percent of the
joint venture and Ford will own the rest.
   In February, Chrysler Corp. sold its Gulfstream Aerospace Corp.
for $825 million.
   GM-Hughes Electronics Corp. is General Motors Corp.'s aerospace
subsidiary. GM has no intention of selling all or part of
GM-Hughes. In fact, GM-Hughes was part of a consortium of companies
which submitted a bid for Ford Aerospace that ultimately was
rejected.
   A joint Ford-Loral news release said the Ford Aerospace sale is
not subject to financing conditions.
   Last week, when Ford and Loral entered final negotiations, Loral
said it would form a new corporation with the merchant banking
operations of Shearson Lehman Hutton of New York for the
acquisition.
   There has been no mention during any of the wrangling that led
to the purchase that Loral would break up Ford Aerospace, a Newport
Beach, Calif.-based company with about 17,000 employees worldwide.
   In a brief statement Friday, Loral said it had no plans to spin
off any of Ford Aerospace's business or for major changes in the
company's operations.
   Ford Aerospace received about $1.8 billion in contract awards
last year and had a backlog of about $2 billion in contracts at the
end of last year.

   Stock prices sold off sharply in a convulsive
session Friday as the market reacted to Middle East oil worries and
mounting recession fears.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down more than 120
points at its midsession low, closed with a 54.95-point loss at
2,809.65.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by more than 5 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
264 up, 1,457 down and 305 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board reached a 1990 high of
292.36 million shares, against 253.09 million in the previous
session.
   Selling also pounded the over-the-counter market, where
technology stocks showed steep losses.
   The Labor Department reported Friday morning that nonfarm
payroll employment fell by 219,000 in July, surprising analysts who
had been looking for a modest increase.
   The civilian unemployment rate jumped three-tenths of a
percentage point, to 5.5 percent.
   Those figures reinforced concern in the financial world that
economic activity was weakening more than had been thought just a
few weeks ago.
   Many observers fear the economy's problems could be compounded
by a jump in oil prices arising from Iraq's invasion of Kuwait this
week.
   Selling intensified as reports reached Wall Street that Iraqi
forces were near the border of Saudi Arabia. It subsequently let up
a bit when a Soviet official said Iraq was expected to withdraw
from Kuwait in the near future.
   After the close in New York, Iraq confirmed that it planned to
begin pulling back forces from Kuwait on Sunday.
   The session marked the second time in the last two weeks that
the Dow fell more than 100 points intraday before recovering some
of its loss. On July 23 the average plummeted in the first hour,
then finished with a net deficit of 56.44 points.
   Among the blue chips, International Business Machines dropped 1|
to 108&lsqb;; Procter &amp; Gamble 2\ to 80; General Motors { to 43&rsqb;;
General Electric ~ to 69}, and American Express \ to 27}.
   In the energy sector, by contrast, prominent oil issues climbed
in early trading and then turned back. Exxon dropped &lsqb; to 53&lsqb;;
Texaco 1\ to 64|, and Mobil &rsqb; to 66~ even as oil prices kept
climbing.
   In the over-the-counter market, Apple Computer fell 2\ to 41\;
MCI Communications 1 to 35}, and Intel 1 to 39\.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 345.20 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $66.55 billion, or 1.99
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped 3.54 to 188.82.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 8.23 to 407.06, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was down 6.62 at 344.86.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
tumbled 11.43 to 417.46. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 346.63, down 5.52.

<HEAD>More Manufacturers Selling Their Own Stuff, So Who Needs
Department Stores?</HEAD>
<HEAD>Graphic in AP Access under FACOUTLETS</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARYBETH NIBLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Vacationers bound for summer getaways will notice something has
happened to out-of-the-way tourist spots. Many have become
miniature shopping meccas catering to devoted bargain seekers.
   Clusters of shops carrying discounted designer duds have
sprouted up all over the country. More manufacturers whose wares
are normally peddled by mainstream retailers are striking out on
their own.
   Outlet complexes are thriving in areas frequented by tourists,
who have the time to browse for good buys. Busloads of pricewise
shoppers regularly pour in. Elsewhere, outlets grouped near major
thoroughfares are catching the attention of passers-by.
   The trend has ominous implications for traditional retailing. It
won't run all regular stores out of business. But it does mean more
competition in a saturated industry already fraught with fierce
battling for market share.
   Sales at outlets are growing faster than general retail
revenues, although they still account for a small portion of
retailing.
   Outlets generated nearly $6 billion in sales last year,
according to Value Retail News, a Clearwater, Fla.-based
publication that tracks the industry. By contrast, a single
retailer, industry biggie Sears, Roebuck and Co., alone had 1989
sales of over $30 billion.
   ``People like the excitement of shopping in a factory outlet.
They like the prices,'' says Lynn Ellsworth, president of Company
Stores Development Corp., a Brentwood, Tenn.-based builder of
outlet malls and a pioneer in the field.
   Manufacturers have several incentives to sell directly to
consumers. It allows them to control the process of getting rid of
leftovers rather than risk problems that can crop up when they
unload merchandise on liquidators.
   Close-out chains and off-price merchants _ which absorb excess
apparel and sell it at discount _ often compete for customers with
nearby department stores and other regular retailers.
   Manufacturers usually make sure their own outlets are far away
from major shopping hubs so they don't jeopardize sales of their
labels selling at full-price stores or upset relations with
retailers, their primary customers.
   ``We purposely stay away from traditional retailers,'' notes
Benard Holtzman, president of apparel designer Harve Benard Ltd.
   Clothing companies, accessory makers and others that go into
retailing must tred carefully. The last thing they want is for
outlet customers to return home gloating to their local retailer
about the great deal they got.
   Women's apparel powerhouse Liz Claiborne Inc. has located its 22
outlet stores 45 minutes to an hour away from regular retailers
selling its label.
   Ritzy Ralph Lauren's lines are sold at discount outlets
deliberately situated 90 miles to 120 miles away from places where
the Polo collection is sold in full-price, company-owned boutiques
and department stores.
   Nevertheless, the issue is so touchy that manufacturers don't
exactly go out of their way to publicize their involvement in the
outlet business. Some even disguise their name, meaning customers
can't tell who owns an outlet. Pricy Izod-Lacoste sportswear is
sold at outlets called Fashion Flair, for instance.
   Irked by the trend, the National Shoe Retailers Association
recently adopted a resolution expressing disapproval of the
proliferation of company-owned factory outlets. Independent shoe
retailers are up in arms because, they say, manufacturers are
bypassing them in channeling merchandise to outlets.
   Association President Bill Boettge said the group believes
independent shoe sellers are being treated unfairly. He said the
group isn't trying to start a national boycott but some association
members are refusing to carry merchandise of manufacturers that
operate their own outlets.
   From a manufacturer's point of view, it makes good business
sense to look for new channels of distribution. Upheaval in the
retail industry, intensifed by the bankruptcy filings of big name
chains, including the parent companies of Bloomingdale's, The Bon
Marche, Lazarus and others, has made manufacturers nervous about
depending on department stores to market merchandise.
   No longer mere havens for fashion has-beens, manufacturers
increasingly use their factory outlets to showcase merchandise.
   Phillips-Van Heusen Corp. reportedly does half its business in
its own outlets, marketing Van Heusen Shirts and shoes from its
G.H. Bass &amp; Co. division.
   Commercial developers say projects involving outlets tend to get
financial backing more easily in these tight money days than
construction of traditional retail centers.
   Although lenders have tightened up their practices after the
savings and loan debacle, they're still willing to support sound
deals. Conventional retailers may be on the ropes but factory
outlets look like they're on stable ground, according to Richard
Echikson, chairman of Millburn, N.J.-based Retail Consultants Inc.,
which helps clients assess potential retail investments.
   ``There is an increasing interest in the financial community and
development community in true factory outlet malls,'' says Echikson.
   With financial backing, an increasing number of outlets has gone
upscale, offering entertainment and other amenities. The Woodbury
Common in Central Valley, N.Y., for instance, recreates a village
setting.
   Malls are growing bigger, too. Benderson Development Co., out of
Buffalo, N.Y., plans to open what it claims will be the world's
largest manufacturers' outlet mall late next year in downtown
Niagara Falls.
   Not all outlets are in the middle of nowhere or even near prime
tourist attractions. Many outlets have been moving closer to
metropolitan areas as more manufacturers get into the act.
   According to Value Retail News, the number of outlet chains has
mushroomed, and last year more were opened than ever before in a
single year. By the middle of this year, there were about 350
chains in operation, up from 264 at the start of 1989.
   The popularity is expected to continue as consumers save more of
their incomes than they did during the free-spending '80s. Aging
baby boomers are keen on bargains now that they are tucking away
spare dollars for their tots' educations.
   Charles Bloom, chairman of the Chelsea Group, a New Jersey-based
developer, owner and operator of factory outlet shopping centers,
says the concept complements traditional retailing and will never
supplant it.
   ``Without retail, there is no wholesale,'' he notes. ``You
couldn't buy a bargain if it wasn't selling for a higher price
somewhere else.''
