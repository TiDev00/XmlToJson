   Social Democratic Prime Minister Anibal
Cavaco Silva reshuffled his government further Thursday following
his party's stinging defeat in local elections last month.
   He said Fernando Real, rector of the northern University of
Tras-as-Montes, will take over the newly created Environment and
Natural Resources Ministry.
   Government officials said Thursday that Secretary of State for
Culture Teresa Gouveia will be replaced by Pedro Santana Lopes, a
leading figure in the Lisbon section of the center-right governing
party.
   Later Thursday, three more secretaries of state _ for tourism,
the budget and the treasury _ announced they would leave the
government.
   On Tuesday, five leading ministers were replaced, including
Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister Eurico de Melo.
   Opposition sources said the shake-up showed deep divisions in
the Social Democrats after the Socialist Party defeated them in
local elections Dec. 17.
   It was the first major government shuffle since the Social
Democrats won general elections in 1987.
   A period of political stability followed, unprecedented since
the 1974 revolution. The past three years also saw a consumer boom
and sustained economic growth. However, the government was accused
of having a high-handed style, inability to control inflation and
not coping with continuing serious social problems.
   It also faced allegations of high-level corruption.

<HEAD>Banks, Exchange Houses Reopen; Austral Stabilizes</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Argentina's national currency
regained some of its lost value against the U.S. dollar Thursday
when banks and exchange houses reopened for the first time since
last week.
   The austral traded at about 1,400 per dollar, sharply higher
than the 1,950-1 rate last Thursday, the final business day of the
year and before the government ordered two national holidays and
two bank holidays to try to stabilize the battered Argentine
economy.
   Nevertheless, it appears premature to say whether the austral's
recovery was signaling success for the fourth stabilization plan by
the economic team of President Carlos Menem, who took office last
July under a mandate to cut the foreign debt, lower inflation and
sell of money-losing state industries.
   The heart of the plan, announced Monday and prompted by last
week's abrupt devaluation, calls for restricting the printing of
further currency so that fewer new bills would flood the market,
thus bidding up the value of the austral.
   The effect has been immediate. Stores report fewer customers.
Bus and taxi drivers have little change, and ranchers and farmers
delivered only small quantities of beef and grain to distributors
this week.
   People who bought dollars last week for 2,200 australs apiece
sold them Thursday for much less, or waited in lines under a hot
sun in this Southern Hemisphere summer to withdraw bank funds from
savings accounts.
   The stabilization plan has been defended by government
officials, but criticized heavily by its political opponents.
   Restricting the circulation of australs may bring on recession,
the Social Democratic Party said in a communique, ``aggravating the
suffering ... of the population.''

<TEXT>
   Combat troops flew home from battle-torn
Panama on Wednesday to a welcome made more joyous by news that
their mission's last objective had been accomplished with Manuel
Antonio Noriega's arrest.
   ``I'm a young guy who's never been in anything like that,'' said
Sgt. George Newsome, 27, of Jackson, Miss., who was with his wife,
Sharon, and their three children. ``I was worrying and hoping I'd
come back home.''
   The Newsomes joined some 30 fatigue-clad soldiers who met
reporters Wednesday outside the Champlain Family Life Center at
Ford Ord. The soldiers were among 141 troops belonging to two
artillery batteries from Fort Ord who were pulled out Monday, the
first troops returning home since the Panama invasion began Dec. 20.
   More troops returned Wednesday evening when an airplane carrying
about 75 Army Rangers landed at Hunter Army Airfield in Savannah,
Ga. They were the first of about 500 Savannah-based Rangers
scheduled to return Wednesday and early Thursday.
   One of the Rangers, Sgt. Donnie Jones, said the first night in
Panama was the worst and said he would remember the experience the
rest of his life.
   ``We were shot at the first night, '' he said, adding that the
Panamanians were extremely glad to see the U.S. soldiers in the
country.
   ``There were real nice toward us,'' he said. ``During Christmas
they were very hospitable, bringing us plates of food. It was very
worthwhile going down there for them.''
   Later Wednesday in Washington, President Bush announced that
Noriega, Panama's former dictator, had turned himself in after nine
days inside the Vatican embassy in Panama City and was arrested by
Drug Enforcement Administration agents.
   The president said Noriega's arrest on drug trafficking charges
meant the United States had achieved all of its objectives in the
military invasion he ordered two weeks ago.
   That news was greeted thankfully by families of the 23 U.S.
servicemen who were killed in action in Panama.
   ``It doesn't lessen the pain, but at least nobody else will be
killed, hopefully,'' said Sharon Roth, the 17-year-old sister of
Army Pfc. Scott Lee Roth, said from her home in Milan, Ill.
   ``That's the most reassuring thing that can come out of all of
this ... He's (Noriega's) going to pay for what he did.''
   In Fort Ord, gunman specialist Mackson Hedgemond, 26, of New
York City, who was stationed on the outskirts of Panama City, said
the operation was warranted by Noriega's alleged involvement in
drug trade.
   ``I think it was something that needed to be done,'' Hedgemond
said. ``I'm against drugs and I think that's bigger than anything
else right now.''
   Sgt. Newsome said he spent most of his Panama tour in secure
areas but still faced constant sniper fire.
   ``I've never been shot at a day in my life ... seeing dead
bodies all around, I've never seen anything like that,'' he
recalled.
   Sharon Newsome told their children that their father was at work
and that he ``had a job to do.''
   ``It was kind of rough but I at least knew he was down there and
he was safe,'' she said.
   Gunnery Sgt. Scott Bell, 24, of Los Angeles spent 14 days in
Panama and said he was surprised to learn he would return Tuesday
night, because his unit had just been told to expect to stay in
Panama another 3{ months.
   Bell said that when his unit _ which mostly provided
fire-support for infantry troops _ arrived at Trios Airport in
Panama at the beginning of the operation, they found ``the whole
airport was just torn up, bullet-ridden.''
   He said that after two days, his unit was flown out to the city
of Rio Hodo, where he spent Christmas, which he described as
``raining, hot, miserable, rather depressing.''
   Bell, who has a wife and a daughter, said most Panamanians
seemed glad to see U.S. troops and waved and cheered at them.
   Asked if the invasion was a success, he said, ``I don't know. To
be perfectly honest, I like to think of using military force as a
last resort. Bullets don't discriminate. ... I've got a family like
everybody else.''

   Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega won acceptance of
surrender terms through Vatican officials before deciding to give
himself up, administration officials said Wednesday night.
   These officials, who spoke on condition that their names not be
used, said the United States agreed to three conditions set by
Noriega, that:
   _He be allowed to make a few phone calls.
   _His decision be kept secret until the actual time of his arrest.
   _He be permitted to wear his uniform.
   The administration earlier had given assurances to Noriega that
we would receive a fair trial in the United States and that he
wouldn't be tried on a federal drug kingpin statute that carries
the death penalty, the sources said.
   These assurances were relayed to Noriega through Vatican
officials. The United States did not directly deal with the deposed
dictator, the sources said.
   ``It seems that the Vatican officials basically stressed to
Noriega that his only viable strategy was to give himself up,''
said one official.

   More than 1,000 firefighters battled
bush fires that raged across three states Thursday, destroying vast
tracts of the Australian Outback.
   At least 20 towns in the states of New South Wales, Victoria and
South Australia were threatened by the flames that were fanned by
100-degree-plus temperatures Wednesday.
   There was no immediate estimate of damage. At least seven people
and three firefighters were injured but there were no reports of
deaths.
   Thousands of people were forced to flee their homes and hundreds
of head of livestock perished as a state of emergency was declared
across six districts of New South Wales, on Australia's eastern
seaboard.
   Officials said thousands of miles of bushland was destroyed as
fires threatened to engulf townships.
   Firefighters, supported by army personnel, water-bombed forests
and bush to doush the fires.

   The launch team prepared today to
start the countdown for sending space shuttle Columbia into space
Monday on a mission to release one satellite and rescue another.
   Shuttle managers cleared Columbia for flight Wednesday following
a six-hour meeting during which they reviewed the readiness of the
shuttle, the launch crew, ground support equipment and other
aspects.
   They directed the countdown to begin at 4 p.m. today, aiming for
a liftoff at 8:10 a.m. Monday.
   ``There are no issues, no concerns,'' NASA spokeswoman Lisa
Malone reported after the meeting.
   During 10 days in orbit, the five-astronaut crew is to deploy a
Navy communications satellite and track down and retrieve a science
satellite before it falls to Earth in March. The satellite has been
orbiting for nearly six years.
   Columbia's launch had been scheduled for December, but was
delayed to allow more time to correct problems on a renovated
launch pad and to let workers go home for Christmas and New Year's.

<HEAD>Football Reigns In Ratings For Holiday Week</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY BUCK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Entertainment shows took a holiday during
Christmas week as football ran up the score in the Nielsen ratings.
   Television's two highest-rated program's for the week ended Dec.
31 were network telecasts of National Football League games.
   Most of the entertainment shows, led by NBC's ``The Cosby Show''
in third place, were reruns. ABC's ``20-20'' was the only original
show other than football in the Top 20.
   First place went to NBC's prime-time spillover of Sunday's
American Football Conference wild-card playoff game between the
Pittsburgh Steelers and the Houston Oilers. The NBC game ran 61
minutes into prime time after 7 p.m. Sunday. It was first on the
NBC and CBS lists but not ABC's.
   ABC's ``Monday Night Football'' game between the Cincinnati
Bengals and the Minnesota Vikings was second. ABC in its
interpretation of the ratings listed its own game coverage as first.
   ABC excludes spillover shows in its ratings, and Nielsen's own
release didn't include the game.
   ``My philosophy is that everything on the air after 7 p.m.
Sunday and after 8 p.m. the rest of the week should be counted,''
said Arnold Becker, CBS vice president for television research.
``Once you begin to leave things out different people come up with
different answers.''
   NBC again topped the weekly A.C. Nielsen Co. survey with an
average of 13.4. After two weeks in second place, CBS fell to third
with 10.3, compared with ABC's 11.4. The ratings represent the
percentage of the nation's 92.1 million households tuned to a show.
   It was the 11th consecutive victory for NBC, which leads for the
season with 14.7, followed by ABC's 13.0 and CBS' 12.1.
   Here's the Top 10 according to Nielsen's release: ABC's football
game between Cincinnati and Minnesota, NBC's ``The Cosby Show,''
NBC's ``The Golden Girls'' and ``Cheers'' tied, NBC's ``Unsolved
Mysteries,'' ABC's ``Roseanne,'' and NBC's ``Empty Nest,'' ``A
Different World,'' ``Dear John'' and ``Matlock.''
   CBS did not have a show in the Top 20. Its highest show _ ``60
Minutes'' _ tied for 22nd place.
   ABC's ``World News Tonight'' won among the evening news shows
with a rating of 11.4. NBC moved into second place with 10.3,
compared with CBS' 10.2
   ABC was first every week of 1989's fourth quarter, including two
ties with CBS. The year's final months saw some of the biggest
stories, including the end of the Berlin Wall, the invasion of
Panama, the revolution in Romania, and the San Francisco Bay area
earthquake.
   The ABC show was also the highest-rated news program for 1989.

<HEAD>Police Detail Gunbattle That Led To Key Drug Trafficker's Death</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly three weeks after they shot and
killed a leader of the Medellin cocaine cartel, police are finally
describing in detail the government's greatest triumph yet in its
war with drug barons.
   The first report of the events Dec. 15 said simply that the
trafficker, Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, his son, Fredy, and five
bodyguards were shot and killed in a gunbattle with police near
Covenas on Colombia's northern coast.
   On Wednesday, a police spokesman gave the first official
detailed account. Fearing retaliation from traffickers, he spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Fredy Rodriguez, 17, was arrested in September on a charge of
carrying an illegal weapon and imprisoned in Bogota. With all the
publicity generated by the arrest, Rodriguez Gacha found that not
even his power and wealth, estimated at $1 billion, could gain the
boy's release.
   On Nov. 23, the youth was released from jail by a judge using
his discretionary powers to free juvenile offenders.
   The spokesman at the national police headquarters in Bogota
denied persistent reports that police had freed Fredy in order to
follow him to his father's hideout on the Caribbean coast.
   He insisted police were tipped off by an informant in Rodriguez
Gacha's gang. The police are not saying if the informant collected
a $580,000 reward.
   The police spokesman gave this account of what followed:
   The evening of Dec. 14, Rodriguez Gacha, his son and five
bodyguards boarded a speedboat in Cartagena and traveled to a ranch
75 miles south of the resort city. The next afternoon, two
helicopters flew over the hideout and the police ordered Rodriguez
Gacha to surrender.
   Rodriguez Gacha, his son and their bodyguards jumped into a
pickup truck and drove toward Covenas, one of Colombia's main sea
ports. Near the port, Fredy and four bodyguards jumped out of the
truck and opened fire on the helicopters.
   Commandos who had landed from one of the helicopters fired back,
killing Fredy and the bodyguards.
   Rodriguez Gacha and the remaining bodyguard abandoned the pickup
and ran into a banana plantation.
   The trafficker fired at the helicopters with his R-15 rifle, and
having run out of ammunition, started thowing hand grenades he had
with him.
   The police in the helicopter opened fire, first hitting him in a
foot and then in the head.

   Three major suspects in the
shooting death of Francisco ``Chico'' Mendes, the Amazon
environmental activist and union leader, broke out of prison but
were captured an hour later, police say.
   Cattle rancher Darli Alves da Silva and his sons Darcy Pereira
da Silva and Oloci Alves da Silva escaped from prison in the Amazon
city of Rio Branco on Saturday, officer Manuel de Brito Ramos said.
   News of the escape from Francisco de Oliveira Conde Penitentiary
was made public only Wednesday, he said.
   Ramos said two guards were sent to da Silva's cell after
authorities learned the three men had obtained revolvers and
planned a breakout.
   The da Silvas overpowered the guards, dashed about 125 feet
across a courtyard and scaled the 11-foot prison wall, Ramos said
by telephone from Rio Branco, 2,650 miles northwest of Rio de
Janeiro.
   With just two wall sentries on duty during the New Year's
holiday weekend, the alarm was not sounded.
   However, Darli Alves da Silva injured himself in jumping off the
wall into thick brush. The da Silvas fled into the wilderness but
police quickly mounted a search and captured them about an hour
later, he said.
   ``Darli's older and very thin and couldn't take the fall,'' said
Ramos. ``Otherwise, they might have made it.''
   Da Silva, indicted in August on a charge of ordering Mendes'
death, and his sons have been held at the 150-inmate penetentiary
for a year awaiting trial.
   Darcy Pereira, 21, was indicted for carrying out the shooting.
Police said he confessed. Oloci Alves, 22, was arrested as an
accomplice.
   Mendes, 44, was shot on Dec. 22, 1988, at his house in the
backwoods Amazon town of Xapuri, 105 miles northwest of Rio Branco
near the Bolivian border.
   Mendes was head of a local rubber tappers union that blocked
ranchers' efforts to clear the rain forest for grazing. He had led
protests in which family and community members stood in front of
bulldozers.
   In 1987, Mendes received the United Nations Global 500 award for
his work to protect the Amazon. He was an environmental watchdog
for the World Bank and other international lending institutions in
England and West Germany.
   Mendes successfully campaigned in May 1988 to stop da Silva from
cutting down a stand of virgin rain forest on his property. Mendes
often said the rancher threatened to kill him. Da Silva denied it.
   The issue of developing the Amazon jungle has often erupted into
bloody clashes between large landowners on one side and ecologists
and peasant farmers on the other.
   The government estimates that more than 800 people have died in
land conflicts since 1980. Many rural leaders and the church
activists who advise them were victims.

   Water conservation projects have displaced more
than 10 million people in China over the past three decades, and up
to 40 percent of those resettled are living in poverty, an official
daily reported today.
   The uprooting of communities for the projects has caused
``unstable social problems'' the China Daily said, quoting Zhao
Renxiang of the Water Resources Ministry.
   Zhao said 30 percent to 40 percent of displaced people lack
adequate food and clothing.
   China has completed 86,000 dams and other waterworks since the
late 1950s, but the legacy of resettlement has hurt plans for
further projects, Zhao said.
   Last year, the government decided to delay for at least five
years a decision on whether to proceed with the nation's biggest
dam project, the Three Gorges Hydroelectric Project on the Yangtze
River.
   The dam would generate 17,000 megawatts of electricity for
energy-starved central China. It has long been controversial
because it would cost tens of billions of dollars to build, cause
serious environmental damage and require the displacement of about
1 million people.
   Zhao said the government plans to issue new regulations to
improve resettlement programs by extending state aid for rebuilding
villages and allowing farmers to find non-agricultural work.

<TEXT>
   Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, who
defied two U.S. presidents until he was toppled by a Dec. 20
invasion, walked out of his Vatican Embassy sanctuary Wednesday
night and surrendered to U.S. troops.
   Word of the former dictator's departure triggered spontaneous
celebrations across the capital. People banged pots and pans and
kissed U.S. soldiers. Fireworks lighted the sky around the Vatican
mission. Groups of youngsters raced up and down the streets waving
Panamanian and U.S. flags.
   ``It's over! It's over!'' shouted residents of the country ruled
for six years by Noriega.
   In Washington, President Bush said Noriega, who had taken refuge
in the embassy on Christmas Eve, turned himself over to American
authorities voluntarily and ``with the full knowlege'' of the
Panamanian government.
   In a nationwide address, Bush said Noriega would be flown on a
C-130 transport plane from Howard Air Force Base in Panama to
Homestead Air Force Base in south Florida to face arraignment at
the U.S. District Court in Miami, where he is wanted on federal
drug trafficking charges.
   If convicted, Noriega faces up to 145 years in prison and up to
$1.1 million in fines. He faces similar federal charges in a Tampa
court.
   ``It seems that the Vatican officials basically stressed to
Noriega that his only viable strategy was to give himself up,''
said a U.S. official in Washington. He spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The United States agreed to three conditions set by Noriega:
that he be allowed to make a few phone calls, that his decision be
kept secret until the actual time of his arrest, and that he be
permitted to wear his uniform, administration officials said.
   The administration earlier had given assurances to Noriega that
we would receive a fair trial and that he wouldn't be tried on a
federal drug kingpin statute that carries the death penalty, they
said.
   The assurances were relayed to Noriega through Vatican
officials. The United States did not directly deal with Noriega,
the sources said.
   ``We are relieved to be rid of this criminal,'' said President
Guillermo Endara in a statement broadcast on national television.
``The people feel a sense of peace knowing that the monster is
leaving our land.''
   ``Thank God, Panama can now feel like a free country,'' said
Moises Rios, 20, who was outside the nunciature minutes after
Noriega left.
   Hundreds of cars jammed 50th Street near the center of what was
once a thriving international financial center. People stopped
reporters and asked, ``Is it official? Is he really gone?''
   ``I feel a very deep emotion,'' said Reyna Luz Sandoval, 21.
``The criminal is finally gone.''
   Gen. Maxwell Thurman, head of U.S. Southern Command, told
reporters in Panama City that ``no deals'' had been made with the
Vatican.
   He thanked a delegation led by Deputy Secretary of State
Lawrence Eagleburger for helping settle the 10-day impasse, but did
not elaborate.
   Thurman said Noriega ``looked vigorous, looked confident. He
looked fine.'' He said the former dictator was due to arrive in
Florida at 3:46 a.m. EST Thursday after a six-hour flight.
   Thurman said Noriega's surrender ``completes the fourth of our
four objectives'' in invading Panama. The other three, he said,
were to protect American lives, safeguard the integrity of the
Panama Canal treaties and restore democracy to Panama.
   According to authorities, about 290 Panamanian soldiers, 300
civilians, 23 U.S. troops and three American civilians died in the
invasion.
   ``I want to express the special thanks of our nation to those
servicemen who were wounded and to the families of those who gave
their lives. Their sacrifice has been a noble cause that will never
be forgotten. A free and prosperous Panama will be an enduring
tribute,'' Bush said in conclusion.
   ``It doesn't lessen the pain, but at least nobody else will be
killed, hopefully,'' said Sharon Roth, the 17-year-old sister of
Army Pfc. Scott Lee Roth, from her home in Milan, Ill.
   Scott Lee Roth, 19, was killed on the first day of the invasion.
He had been in Panama since August.
   Noriega left the compound at 8:50 p.m. accompanied by papal
nuncio Monsignor Sebastian Laboa. He was wearing his general's
uniform.
   Archbishop Marcos McGrath, asked why Noriega suddenly gave up,
told ABC-TV that the former chief of the Defense Forces was
``undoubtedly a lonely man, a broken man.''
   Noriega was taken to a waiting U.S. Army Blackhawk helicopter
and flown to Howard, the U.S. air Base just west of the capital,
Thurman said.

<TEXT>
   Ousted Panamanian strongman Manuel Antonio Noriega
will finally be tried here in a drug trafficking case that has
provoked thorny legal questions and could raise new precedents,
experts said Wednesday.
   Whatever the legal headaches, the challenge was welcomed by
prosecutors who helped build the complex case against Noriega and
15 others.
   ``Christmas came nine days late to America,'' said Robert
Merkle, a former U.S. attorney who brought an indictment in Tampa
against Noriega. ``I did my job. I think it's great what's
happening here.''
   Merkle predicted that the quick movement of Noriega to Miami
would not pose legal problems.
   ``There is no formal extradition involved here and the case law
is that the court will not look to the circumstances by which the
person was brought to the United States,'' he said.
   Noriega was taken into custody by U.S. authorities in Panama
late Wednesday and put on a plane for Homestead Air Force Base
south of Miami, where he was expected to arrive at 3:46 a.m. EST,
said Gen. Maxwell Thurman, head of the U.S. Southern Command in
Panama.
   His arraignment was tentatively scheduled for Thursday afternoon
in the federal courthouse in downtown Miami, about 24 miles north
of the base, said Diane Cossin, a spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney
Dexter Lehtinen in Miami.
   ``There's going to be a plea entered tomorrow of not guilty,''
said Noriega defense attorney Steven Kollin. ``We're going to
request certain pretrial discovery requests including certain
sensitive documents, and these sensitive documents will get to the
truth of the matter. I believe he will be found not guilty if we
can find a jury of 12 people after this unparalleled pretrial
publicity.''
   A roadblock to prosecuting Noriega is his right to demand
classified information stemming from his past cooperation with the
Central Intelligence Agency, legal experts have said.
   Noriega stands accused of drug trafficking in indictments handed
down in Miami and Tampa in February 1988. They marked the first
time federal charges were filed against a foreign leader who was
not in the United States.
   ``In my opinion, Gen. Noriega is entitled under the law to `head
of state immunity,' '' said Neal Sonnett, who withdrew only last
week as one of Noriega's attorneys. ``That was one of the main
arguments advanced in my motion for dismissal of the indictment
against him.''
   The dismissal motion was denied by the trial judge in the
federal case last January, but Sonnett said the legality of his
extradition was sure to be a factor at Noriega's trial.
   ``I would think that any good lawyer representing Gen. Noriega
would raise that issue again, particulary in light of the fact that
Gen. Noriega was elected chief of state by the Panamian congress
shortly before the invasion.''
   But Ms. Cossin said a ``head of state immunity'' claim would
have little effect on their case.
   ``We anticipate numerous allegations and claims in Gen.
Noriega's defense,'' Cossin said. ``However, we have a great deal
of confidence in our prosecution team and the laws of the United
States.''
   Noriega reportedly worked closely with the CIA and the Pentagon
while he served as the head of Panama's military intelligence
service and after he became commander in chief in 1983.
   The Justice Department acknowledged last week that it was in
such a rush to indict Noriega on drug charges that it may not have
followed its own rules for making sure state secrets would not be
disclosed in court.
   But department spokesman David Runkel said, ``We believe there
is a strong case against General Noriega and that case can be
successfully brought to trial.''
   At a press briefing last week, Runkel said the department may
not have followed its usual policies of reviewing, while drawing up
an indictment, any classified documents that might be used in a
trial.
   He said the department's decision to review the national
security issues was an outgrowth of a Dec. 14 meeting of
prosecutors in the case with representatives of the Drug
Enforcement Administration, Federal Bureau of Investigation and
CIA, in which it was decided that the Miami case would have
priority.
   In Atlanta, a former White House counsel said Wednesday night
that attorneys handling Noriega's case should be able to select an
unbiased jury to hear the deposed dictator's trial.
   ``It's more of a problem than the routine case, but it's not an
insurmountable problem,'' said Robert Lipshutz, former counsel to
the president during the administration of Jimmy Carter.
   ``There are thousands of people in every community who really
don't follow these things with great attention and, therefore,
would be qualified for jury duty,'' Lipshutz said ni a telephone
interview.

   At Howard, he was arrested by Drug Enforcement Administration
agents and left on a flight to Florida. Thurman said the flight
left at 9.31 p.m., 41 minutes after Noriega left the embassy.
   Thurman said U.S. officials had only a few minutes warning that
Noriega would leave the embassy. He said Maj. Gen. Marc Cisneros,
commander of U.S. Army South, received a telephone call at his
command post in the school across the street asking him to ``report
to the gate.''
   Thurman declined to say who received Noriega but emphasized that
he left on his own free will.
   He said no Panamanian officials were present but that the
Panamanian government was aware of what was going on.
   Noriega ruled this West Virginia-sized nation of 2.2 million
people since 1983.
   In his remarks, Bush thanked the Vatican and the papal nuncio in
Panama for its help and promised Noriega would receive a fair trial.
   Nevertheless, he said, ``His apprehension and return to the
United States will send a clear signal that the United States is
serious in its determination that those charged with promoting the
distribution of drugs cannot escape the scrutiny of justice.''
   The trial is expected to be complicated. U.S. legal authorities
have been studying secret documents this past month concerning
Noriega's long tenure as a CIA and DEA informant. They expect he
might try to derail his prosecution by seeking disclosure of
information that would be embarrassing to Bush _ a former CIA
director _ and the United States.
   The impasse ended hours after 20,000 people shouting ``No
More!'' and ``Assassin!'' marched to the Vatican Embassy to demand
Noriega's surrender.
   Noriega was said to be in ``strict isolation'' after Laboa told
his staff not to speak to the ousted dictator. An embassy spokesman
said the television set in the room was broken.
   Panamanian sources said the U.S. Southern Command had tried to
convince Noriega's longtime mistress to try to lure Noriega out the
embassy.
   But the sources, who asked not to be further identified, said
Vicky Amado talked to Noriega for 10 minutes after her release from
a U.S. military facility and told him, ``The decision is in your
hands.''
   There was no immediate word on the whereabouts of Ms. Amado or
Noriega's wife and three children. His family had been holed up in
the Cuban Embassy.
   Throughout the standoff at the Vatican mission, the Vatican has
said it would not deliver Noriega directly to the United States and
would deal with Panama.
   Panama's foreign minister, Julio Linares, said Panama's
Constitution did not permit the general's extradition to the United
States.
   Former President Reagan, the first of two presidents that
Noriega defied during his reign in power, said he was ``pleased
that Gen. Noriega will be brought to justice.'' Reagan made the
comments in Los Angeles through his spokesman, Mark Weinberg.
   Noriega reveled in thumbing his nose at the United States, which
he called ``the colossus of the north.''
   Washington imposed sanctions against Panama in its effort to
dislodge the general from power, but Noriega wouldn't budge.
   When elections apparently were going against him in May 1989, he
abruptly had them annulled. For a time he had his own handpicked
man as provisional president.
   Later his controlled legislature gave Noriega himself full
civilian powers to go with the military clout he had long
possessed, and which made him the most powerful man in Panama.
   On Dec. 20, shortly after incidents in which a U.S. Marine
lieutenant was killed and in which, according to President Bush, a
U.S. Navy couple was abused, U.S. troops invaded Panama and Noriega
fled into hiding.

<HEAD>Rare Dinosaur's Bones Found in Northern Colorado</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOULDER, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The fossil remains of a rare, meat-eating
dinosaur that predated the more famous Tyrannosaurus Rex but
rivaled it in size and ferocity have been discovered in Colorado, a
scientist said Wednesday.
   The dinosaur, named Epanterias amplexus, weighed about four tons
and measured about 50 feet long, and had a long, powerful tail that
probably allowed it to bounce along like a kangaroo, said
University of Colorado paleontologist Robert Bakker.
   The Epanterias could eat about 40 tons of meat a year and its
``claws seem to be the longest and the strongest of any meat-eating
dinosaur that ever lived,'' he said.
   ``Because of its jaw structure, Epanterias could have swallowed
a 1,400-pound Hereford cow with no trouble,'' Bakker said.
   The first bones of the latest Epanterias site were found west of
Fort Collins in northern Colorado by a team headed by Bakker.
   Epanterias walked on its hind legs like Tyrannosaurus Rex, but
was built lower, or ``slinkier'' to the ground, Bakker said, adding
that T. Rex came along some 66 million years after Epanterias.
   So far the dig has recovered a jawbone, neck and tail vertebrae
and chest bones, he said.
   ``There's more still in the ground but it's the hardest dig I've
ever made, like digging porcelain imbedded in concrete,'' he said.
   The site is mountainous and a transitional zone between sage and
pine. When Epantarias roamed the region 135 million years ago at
the end of the Jurassic period, it was a vast flat floodplain
stretching east and west from Nevada to South Dakota and north and
south from Alberta, Candad, to New Mexico, Bakker said.
   The only other two known Epantarias sites were discovered in
1877 near Canon City, Colo., and in 1934 in the Oklahoma panhandle.
   Bakker hopes that by assembling bones from all three sites, a
nearly complete composite Epanterias can be assembled.
   ``Since these discoveries only seem to come along about every 50
years, we still have a lot to learn about Epanterias. Even though
this animal was as long as Tyrannosaurus Rex and heavier than the
average circus elephant, it's rarely mentioned in standard dinosaur
textbooks,'' Bakker said.

   General Motors Corp. Chairman Roger Smith
doesn't see much humor in a documentary named after him _ ``Roger &amp;
Me,'' which chronicles life in Flint, Mich., where GM closed 11
plants.
   Smith, at a news conference Wednesday to discuss GM's new
electric-powered Impact car, said he hadn't seen the movie, didn't
plan to, and didn't want to talk much about it.
   ``I'm not muchfor sick humor and I don't like things that take
advantage of poor people,'' he said when reporters brought up the
film. He then changed the subject.
   The movie contains interviews with people who said they lost
their homes. One woman said she had to kill rabbits for food after
Smith shut down the GM plants. The closures eliminated 30,000 jobs
in the city of 150,000.
   Filmmaker Michael Moore said he had made arrangements with
Warner Bros. to reserve a seat for Smith at every showing of the
movie across the United States.

   Donna Rice, a household name after reporters
found she spent a weekend with Gary Hart, has become a born-again
Christian who spends much of her time doing charitable work,
according to a published report.
   A friend of Miss Rice's, Andy Messing, told The Washington Times
in a story Wednesday that she ``went back to her roots and because
she did, she wound up coming out of a tailspin that would have
killed other people.''
   Miss Rice, 32, who declined to be interviewed for the story,
became an instant celebrity in 1987 when her relationship with Hart
was publicized. Hart dropped out of the race for the Democratic
presidential nomination, and later made an unsuccessful re-entry
into the contest.
   Miss Rice now lives with a female friend in northern Virginia.
The newspaper said she doesn't have a full-time paying job, and
quoted friends as saying she has become quietly involved in
charitable work.
   The newspaper also said she has a boyfriend, and attends some of
Washington's high-profile dinners and events.
   ``Donna ... has not gone through that much of a change,'' said
Tricia Erickson, head of a McLean, Va., modeling agency and Miss
Rice's designated crisis manager in 1987. ``I don't think that she
`went to God,' so to speak. Donna's always been like that. It isn't
some miraculous thing.''

   World chess champion Garry Kasparov has an entire
country indignant over his latest move.
   Kasparov, 26, proposed in an interview in Playboy magazine's
November issue that the Soviet Union sell Mongolia, an independent
country and loyal ally of the Soviets, to China.
   Soviet government spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said Wednesday
that protest letters and petitions signed by thousands of
Mongolians have arrived at the Soviet Embassy in Ulan Bator,
capital of Mongolia, and four Soviet consulates.
   He said two-hour strikes were held Dec. 30 at Mongolian plants
that make goods for the Soviet market.
   In the interview, Kasparov said: ``I just had the thought the
other day: Why don't we sell the Kuril Islands to the Japanese?
Frankly speaking, I'm not sure the islands belong to us, and the
Japanese, who claim them, would give us billions and billions for
them!
   ``That would keep us going for maybe five or 10 years. Then we
could sell Mongolia to China and get a few more years that way.''

   CBS has denied a published report that the
network will cancel the low-rated late-night ``Pat Sajak Show'' as
soon as it finds a replacement.
   ``CBS has no response,'' said a CBS official who declined to be
identified. ``This is an ongoing rumor and has no validity.''
   The trade publication Daily Variety said Wednesday that CBS was
delaying cancellation of the show until a replacement series was
found.
   Rumors of the show's cancellation have been circulating for
several months. Ratings for the show, introduced Jan. 9, have
trailed NBC's ``The Tonight Show'' starring Johnny Carson, the
syndicated ``Arsenio Hall Show'' and ABC's ``Nightline.''

   This year's Grammy Awards ceremonies will
include lifetime achievement honors to Dick Clark, Paul McCartney,
Miles Davis and the late Vladimir Horowitz and Nat King Cole.
   The five will be honored at the Feb. 21 event, said Michael
Greene, president of the National Academy of Recording Artists.
   McCartney's impact on music as a songwriter and member of the
Beatles, as well as his continuing growth as a solo performer were
cited as reasons for his achievement award.
   Jazz legend Davis played a crucial role in the development of
jazz since the 1940s, the academy said.
   Horowitz was included because many consider him the 20th
century's greatest classical pianist, and Cole was cited as a
leading singer of the 1940s and 1950s.
   The inclusion of Clark was a surprise because he produces the
American Music Awards, which competes with the Grammys.
   ``We don't view these shows as competitive and when you look at
the big contribution Clark has made to the recording industry,
especially in exposing new talent, there is no question he is
deserving,'' Greene said.

   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh is remodeling
the government's vaunted organized crime strike forces along the
lines of its oft-criticized drug task forces.
   Thornburgh has expended large chunks of his political capital on
a merger that has mystified Democrats and Republicans on Capitol
Hill. He implemented the plan Monday during a congressional recess,
spurning a last-minute appeal for delay from Senate Judiciary
Committee Chairman Joseph R. Biden.
   Since Thornburgh announced the plan last February, 33 strike
force lawyers _ nearly a fourth of the government's top organized
crime prosecutors _ have quit. More plan to follow.
   ``This is the first time I can remember where government
officials seem determined to reform a program that everyone agrees
has been a tremendous success,'' said Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., when
the attorney general appeared before Senate committees to promote
his plan.
   Thornburgh responded that his motive was simply to assure that
``the best management model is in place.''
   The strike forces based in 25 cities followed crime families and
alliances across state lines. They worked directly for the
Organized Crime and Racketeering Section of the Criminal Division
in Washington that formulated a national strategy.
   In the last decade, they have imprisoned the leadership of
organized crime families in Boston, Brooklyn, Chicago, Cleveland,
Denver, Kansas City, Los Angeles, New Haven, New Orleans,
Philadelphia and Rochester.
   Thornburgh, however, has never been enamored of their
independence. He is merging them this week into the existing U.S.
attorneys' offices in 23 cities.
   Thornburgh says his new model for fighting organized crime is
the ``highly productive effort'' by 13 drug task forces, each
headed by a U.S. attorney who coordinates federal, state and local
agencies.
   Not everyone, even in Thornburgh's own party or department,
agrees that would be an improvement.
   One Senate Republican source, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said flatly that ``the (drug) task forces don't work.''
   Evidence of problems with the drug task forces comes from the
administration itself. Charles Blau, the deputy associate attorney
general who watched over them from their startup in 1983 until last
year, described them as weak and decentralized. He said he spent 50
to 60 percent of his time trying to referee turf battles between
U.S. attorneys.
   Thornburgh, however, contends that modeling organized crime
efforts after the drug task forces actually will decrease turf
battles. He also says the change will prod the strike forces to
look more closely at newer forms of organized crime such as
international drug cartels, street gangs and Asian and Jamaican
criminal organizations.
   In a November report to Congress, drug czar William Bennett
backed Thornburgh's merger plan, and he also praised the drug task
forces. But he added that the drug task forces have ``two important
deficiencies'' _ lack of direction from Washington to resolve
disputes and to ensure that resources are not wasted on less
important cases.
   Bennett said the government needs to take decisive action to
overcome ``the `single district' focus of some U.S. attorneys.''
   One source close to Bennett who spoke on condition of anonymity
said the drug control director caved in on the organized crime
question because he was more concerned with ``other fights we have
with Thornburgh,'' like getting the U.S. attorneys to work together
on major drug cases.
   Thornburgh has advocated making the strike forces subordinate to
U.S. attorneys since 1974, when he was a U.S. attorney in
Pittsburgh who clashed with the strike force chief there.
   Veterans of the strike forces are certain the move will
ultimately allow U.S. attorneys to divert the lawyers to short-term
cases that might provide quicker publicity and political gain.
   Jeremiah O'Sullivan, who headed the Boston strike force for 10
years until early 1989, said that prospect is driving his former
colleagues out.
   ``They don't want to work in an office where the person they
work for knows little or nothing about the subject matter, and
where turnover is so rapid that there's nobody there long enough to
work the long-range cases. They don't want to work bank robberies
and short-range, modest drug cases,'' O'Sullivan said.
   Although the attorney general cannot fire U.S. attorneys _ they
are presidential appointees _ Thornburgh spokesman Dave Runkel said
this attorney general can prevent the U.S. attorneys from
cannibalizing their new organized crime units.
   ``They know him and respect him and appreciate what he has
done,'' Runkel said, noting that Thornburgh is one of only two
attorneys general to have worked previously as U.S. attorneys.
   Runkel also said Thornburgh plans to pursue a unified organized
crime strategy developed by a council of federal agency heads.
   Convinced that isn't happening with the drug task forces, Biden
and other Democrats have proposed combining Justice's organized
crime and narcotics operations into a separate division with its
own field offices reporting to one manager in Washington.
   On Dec. 6, Biden wrote Thornburgh asking him to delay the strike
force merger until Congress considered that proposal in February.
   Thornburgh's response was to implement the merger this week
while Congress was away. In addition, The Associated Press has
learned, he mailed Biden's letter to U.S. attorneys, telling them
he ``may be calling upon you for assistance with your home state
senators'' to defeat Biden's proposal.
   One Democratic Senate source said, ``Everyone is flabbergasted.
No one can understand why he's burning up so many political bridges
on this one.''
   An equally surprised Republican source said Thornburgh ``put a
lot of time and prestige into this.''
   ``There was more vigorous lobbying on this than anything else
they did this year,'' the GOP source said. ``They had squads of
people going up to line up votes.''

<HEAD>Banks and Thrifts Fell in Big Numbers During 1980s</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most of the 1980s were boom years for the
economy as a whole, but they were a bust for banks and savings
institutions which failed in numbers not seen in half a century.
   Capping a decade of failure for financial institutions, savings
and loans in 1989 collapsed at the highest rate ever and bank
closings fell only slightly short of a post-Depression high,
regulators said Wednesday.
   Government seizure of thrifts in Texas and New Mexico on Dec. 21
boosted the tally of failed S&amp;Ls to 328, far above the previous
high of 277 in 1938.
   The Resolution Trust Corp., the agency created Aug. 9 to carry
out President Bush's S&amp;L bailout, took control of 318 failed
thrifts, disposing of 37 of them by year's end. The old Federal
Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. dealt with 10 S&amp;Ls.
   Meanwhile, a commercial bank failure in California and another
in New York on Dec. 20 pushed the total to 207 for the year, down
from a post-Depression record of 221 in 1988, according to the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
   The decline, although small, was the first since 1977 when six
banks failed, a drop from 17 the previous year.
   Academic experts and analysts point to a number of factors
behind the soaring failure rate in the 1980s, some of which are
still present as the financial system begins a new decade.
   ``I don't see 1989 as being the end of this,'' said Catherine
England, a scholar at the Cato Institute, a conservative research
group in Washington. ``I think failures are going to continue to
increase into the 1990s.''
   Rapidly advancing technology is making it more difficult for
financial institutions to compete. Companies that once borrowed
from banks are now able to issue junk bonds or commercial paper.
Consumers can bank by telephone or computer, bypassing local banks
and S&amp;Ls in favor of better deals offered by big institutions and
money market mutual funds.
   ``That means we just don't need as many banks and S&amp;Ls as we
once did. ... And this overcapacity is one of the reasons we're
seeing these failures,'' she said.
   Also, the expansion of federal deposit insurance in 1980 from
$40,000 per account to $100,000 encouraged bank and S&amp;L owners to
take more risks, knowing the government would pick up the tab if
their investments soured.
   A farm crisis as the decade began, followed by an oil crisis in
the mid-1980s, helped guarantee that many risky investments would
go bad.
   High interest rates used in the early 1980s by the Federal
Reserve System to fight inflation depressed commodity prices and
drove the value of the dollar sky high, squelching farm export
sales. Farming's crisis became rural banks' crisis.
   Then, with the 1986 collapse of oil prices, concern shifted to
Texas and other oil-producing states whose go-go economies were
fueled by the expectation of endlessly increasing oil prices. The
fallout of the oil bust was still being felt as late as 1989 when
134 bank failures and 90 S&amp;L insolvencies occurred in Texas.
   Now, shaky real estate markets in Arizona and in some states of
the Northeast are prompting concerns that as Texas recovers,
institutions in other states will start to topple.
   Savings institutions suffered from some of the same regional
problems, but added at least three other causes: weak regulation,
the effect of volatile interest rates on home mortgage portfolios
and the inability of the government to close bankrupt institutions
because the S&amp;L deposit insurance fund had run out of money.
   A few private analysts fear the true analogy for the 1980s is
not the 1930s, but the 1920s, when hundreds of banks failed each
year despite general prosperity. That was followed by even more
collapses and general economic ruin in the 1930s.
   FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman agrees the historically high
failure rate won't disappear overnight, but he is predicting that
1990 will bring another drop in the bank closing total.
   Last year's failures brought the decade total to 1,894
institutions: 1,059 banks and 835 S&amp;Ls.

   Vice President Dan Quayle gets the highest
marks and Secretary of Transportation Samuel D. Skinner the lowest
in a conservative critique of the Bush administration's first year.
   President Bush averages a ``C plus'' in the view of five
conservative leaders asked by the magazine Policy Review to grade
the performance of the president and his Cabinet.
   The magazine is published by the conservative Heritage
Foundation.
   Quayle gets an average grade between ``A minus'' and ``A,'' with
religious broadcaster Pat Robertson describing him as ``a superb
vice president.''
   Skinner averages a ``D minus.'' Edward H. Crane, president of
the Cato Institute, gives him an ``F'' and says Bush's Democratic
opponent, Michael Dukakis, ``would have rejected Skinner as
hopelessly liberal.''
   Crane gives Bush a ``D,'' saying he is ``inexcusably weak'' on
domestic issues and ``avoids an `F' by his measured response to
developments in Eastern Europe.''
   Budget director Richard Darman rates just behind Quayle, falling
between a ``B plus'' and an ``A minus.'' Burton Pines, senior vice
president and director of research at the Heritage Foundation,
hails him as ``a hero'' for his resistance to tax increases.
   Next comes White House Chief of Staff John Sununu, with a solid
``B plus.'' Paul M. Weyrich, director of the Free Congress
Foundation, calls him ``the best chief of staff I have seen'' in 23
years in Washington.
   Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney comes out with an average of
better than a ``B.''
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III averages a ``C minus,'' as
do Secretary of the Interior Manuel Lujan, Secretary of Health and
Human Services Louis Sullivan and Secretary of Energy James D.
Watkins.
   Secretary of the Treasury Nicholas F. Brady has the second
lowest average grade, a ``D.'' Amy Moritz, executive director of
the National Center for Public Policy Research, says Brady's
``lackluster handling'' failed to give the needed boost to Bush's
plan for a capital gains tax cut.

<HEAD>Report Finds Fraud and Embezzlement in Some Foreign Aid Programs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYNA BRENNAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Theft and fraud in some foreign aid programs
results in federal funds intended for food and health care being
used instead to buy things like mink coats and a tennis court, a
federal audit says.
   The report by the U.S. Agency for International Development's
inspector general said that from April through September 1989, it
recovered $182,946 in misused funds and saved AID $2.4 million in
unnecessary expenses.
   The AID watchdog monitors more than 2,000 projects in 70
countries with a budget of about $7.2 billion. Most of the programs
provide American money for health, education, rural development and
agriculture in Third World nations.
   The inspector general's report said it received 133 complaints
during the six-month reporting period. Of that total, 102 concerned
allegations of fraud, bribery, embezzlement, false claims or
conflicts of interest; 25 were linked to allegations of criminal
violations and six involved administrative irregularities.
   According to the report, an AID bookkeeper pleaded guilty to the
theft of $340,228 and ``used the stolen funds to maintain a lavish
lifestyle.'' Without identifying the woman, it said she gave
$111,000 to friends, purchased several mink coats, toy dolls with
mink coats, eight original paintings and a sculpture.
   In Rwanda, investigators found that a director from a volunteer
agency sold donated food to pay the labor costs for the
construction of his new home and a tennis court. Several of his
employees also sold food provided by AID ``and, in one instance,
built a restaurant.''
   In Chad, a local AID employee was found selling customs duty
exemptions to local merchants. In Indonesia, an AID worker was
jailed for forging stolen checks.
   The inspector general's office questioned the viability of a
multimillion-dollar irrigation program in the Bakel region of
Senegal, saying ``there was no evidence from the projects that
irrigated farming was commercially viable.''
   The report said the project should be terminated if an
evaluation ``does not result in a positive assessment.''
   The investigation also said AID continued to have problems with
cash advances, with an audit showing $1.1 million in outstanding
advances. ``Attempts to correct the problems had been restricted to
a case-by-case basis without addressing the underlying systemic
causes,'' it said.
   The inspector general's office found several cases of countries
failing to meet established guidelines for dealing with programs.
In the Food for Peace programs, for example, host nations are to
use the money received from the sale of the food for approved AID
projects.
   Problems were found in El Salvador, Uruguay and Liberia.
   AID's contraceptive program also ran into problems because of
lack of controls. The agency provides more than 80 percent of the
world's donated contraceptives, which cost about $244 million from
1982 to 1988.
   A lack of effective controls has ``made it more difficult for
AID to efficiently deliver contraceptives,'' and some products
deteriorated due to poor storage, the report said.
   The inspector general's report concluded, ``AID managers must
deal with many countries that lack adequate systems of financial
accountability and program management.''
   It said investigations showed inadequate controls and
accountability over local currencies, insufficient financial
contributions by host governments, weak AID accounting systems, and
failure to put into place systems to identify and correct problems
found in projects.

   A key member of Congress praises the Bush
administration's emphasis on speedily selling real estate from
failed savings institutions, but others worry about the effect on
shaky real estate markets.
   The administration's strategic plan for conducting the savings
and loan bailout, released Wednesday, instructs regulators to begin
selling real estate and other assets from insolvent S&amp;Ls even
before the government officially closes the institutions.
   Rep. Bruce Vento, D-Minn., chairman of a House task force which
is monitoring the S&amp;L bailout, praised the approach.
   ``Procrastinating is much more of a risk because you have to pay
to manage it (the real estate). The stuff doesn't get better with
age. It's not like red wine,'' Vento said.
   Kenneth A. Guenther, executive vice president of the Independent
Bankers' Association of America, cautioned the policy ``could wind
up being a major political problem on the front door of the
president ... by putting downward pressure on real estate prices.''
   He noted, however, the administration faces problems no matter
which approach it emphasized: speed or caution.
   ``There's a real question of whether the market can stabilize if
they don't get rid of the overhang'' of unsold properties, he said.
   The plan was written by an oversight board chaired by Treasury
Secretary Nicholas F. Brady. The board sets policy for the
Resolution Trust Corp., which is run by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp., an independent regulatory agency.
   The RTC was created Aug. 9 by S&amp;L bailout legislation. So far,
it's taken over 318 S&amp;Ls, disposing of 37 of them. The 281 S&amp;Ls
remaining in its control have assets of $104 billion. It expects to
take over an addition 200 institutions with assets of about $150
billion. Roughly half of the total assets are real estate.
   Oversight board President Daniel P. Kearney, in an attempt to
quiet fears the real estate will be dumped, noted much of it is
entangled in legal problems and said it could take several years
for the RTC to get clear title required to sell.
   The plan released Wednesday was little changed from a draft
obtained by The Associated Press three weeks ago. One difference
was that the oversight board originally gave the RTC a June 30
deadline for reviewing bailout deals put together by its
predecessor, the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. The final
plan extended the deadline to Aug. 31.
   The plan leaves an important financing issue unresolved. The
bailout bill passed by Congress provides $50 billion to close
insolvent S&amp;Ls. But administration officials estimate they need to
borrow another $50 billion to $100 billion in ``working capital''
to finance S&amp;L deals, repaying it as assets from the institutions
are sold.
   The administration emphasizes that borrowing working capital
does not mean the taxpayer cost of the bailout will go up, but
Vento said Congress is reluctant to permit the administration to
borrow that much.
   Bert Ely, a thrift analyst in Alexandria, Va., said he estimates
the administration needs at least $72 billion in working capital.
   ``That's an enormous amount of money and the question is how are
they going to come up with it,'' Ely said. ``One of the things we
may be seeing here is the beginning stage of a big punt that would
leave hundreds of (failed) S&amp;Ls sitting out there corrupting the
marketplace.''

<HEAD>Global Warming Could Alter Forests Early in Next Century</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RAEBURN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Editor</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A study showing that global warming could speed
the destruction of forests by fire and windstorms suggests
noticeable change could occur in the Earth's forests by early in
the next century, a researcher said.
   ``The rate of change will be faster than we thought before,''
said Jonathan Overpeck, the study's principal author.
   The change will be marked by the appearance of fast-growing
species of trees in areas where mature trees have been destroyed,
said Overpeck, a staff scientist at the Lamont-Doherty Geological
Observatory in Palisades.
   Previous computer projections have shown that changes in
temperature and rainfall could affect the growth of forests. This
is the first to show that physical destruction of trees will play a
significant role in changing forests as the Earth warms, Overpeck
said.
   George Woodwell, an ecologist and the director of the Woods Hole
Research Center in Massachusetts, said Overpeck's findings agree
with decades of research by ecologists showing that similar forest
disturbance has occurred when climate changed in the past.
   Margaret Davis, an ecologist at the University of Minnesota,
said: ``This is important because the effects of disturbance are
much quicker than the effects of climate change. ... It gives us
less time to respond to the change.''
   Overpeck's collaborators were David Rind of the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration's Goddard Institute for Space
Studies and Richard Goldberg of the Institute for Global
Habitability at Columbia University.
   Their study appears today in Nature, a British scientific
journal.
   Global warming is occuring as so-called greenhouse effect gases
build up in the atmosphere. The gases include carbon dioxide and
the chlorofluorocarbons used in refrigerators and air conditioners.
   The Earth is expected to warm gradually during the next century
as the gases enable the atmosphere to trap more and more of the
sun's heat, mimicking the action of a greenhouse.
   Experts disagree over how much the Earth will warm and when the
effects will begin to be felt. But few disagree with the premise
that the Earth will warm.
   Overpeck cautioned that his findings should not be taken as a
prediction. He cannot say precisely how soon changes in forests
will begin to be noticed or how great the change will be.
   But the research demonstrates that computer forecasts should
take into account the physical destruction of forests as well as
the effects of changing temperature and rainfall, he said.
   Overpeck and his colleagues used a computer climate program
developed by NASA to show that thunderstorms, hurricanes and
tornadoes will occur more frequently as the climate warms.
   They then used a second computer program to assess the effect of
these changes on forests. Lightning associated with the
increasingly frequent thunderstorms will increase the likelihood of
forest fires, they said, and the windstorms will uproot trees.

   For the second time in four years, a
coin toss decided a deadlocked election for a trustee seat.
   The coin toss Tuesday at the Mahoning County Board of Elections
was a repeat of the election four years ago involving the same men.
The results were the same both times for Robert Spencer, who lost
to Bruce Behner when he picked tails in a coin flip that came up
heads.
   Behner will serve another four-year term as a trustee of rural
Goshen Township in northeastern Ohio.
   ``This is unbelievable ... twice in four years,'' said Spencer,
40, a bus salesman at Myers Equipment Corp. ``Son of a gun, what
can I say?''
   The coin toss was needed after Behner, 53, a hog farmer, paid
$50 for a recount after close balloting in November. He was a
write-in candidate for one of two trustee seats open after he
failed to correctly file petitions for re-election.
   The recount showed Behner had 261 votes to Spencer's 271. John
Heffner was the top vote-getter with 307 votes.
   There were 10 disputed ballots where Behner's name was written
in but the oval next to it was not blackened, as required by law. A
ruling by Ohio Secretary of State Sherrod Brown gave the ballots to
Behner, ending the election in a tie.
   Behner said he was glad to keep the job, which pays a maximum of
$5,600 per year.

   Here is the text of President Bush's statement
announcing that deposed Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega had
surrendered to U.S. authorities:
   On Wednesday, Dec. 20, I ordered U.S. troops to Panama with four
objectives: Safeguard the lives of American citizens, help restore
democracy, protect the integrity of the Panama Canal treaties and
bring Gen. Manuel Noriega to justice.
   All of these objectives have now been achieved.
   At about 8:50 this evening Gen. Noriega turned himself in to
U.S. authorities in Panama with the full knowledge of the
Panamanian government. He was taken to Howard Air Force Base in
Panama where he was arrested by DEA.
   A U.S. Air Force C-130 is now transporting Gen. Noriega to
Homestead Air Force Base, Florida. He will be arraigned in the U.S.
District Court in Miami on charges stemming from his previous
indictment for drug trafficking. I want to thank the Vatican and
the papal nuncio in Panama for their evenhanded statesmanlike
assistance in recent days.
   The United States is committed to providing Gen. Noriega a fair
trial. Nevertheless, his apprehension and return to the United
States will send a clear signal that the United States is serious
in its determination that those charged with promoting the
distribution of drugs cannot escape the scrutiny of justice.
   The return of Gen. Noriega marks a significant milestone in
Operation Just Cause. The U.S. used its resources in a manner
consistent with political, diplomatic and moral principles.
   The first U.S. combat troops have already been withdrawn from
Panama. Others will follow as quickly as the local situation will
permit. We are now engaged in the final stages of a process that
includes the economic and political revitalization of this
important friend and neighbor, Panama.
   An economic team under the direction of Deputy Secretary of
State Eagleburger and Deputy Secretary of Treasury Robson is just
returning from Panama. A team of experts has remained on hand there
to assess the full range of needs.
   We will continue to extend to the Panamanian people our support
and assistance in the days ahead. Panamanians and Americans both
have sacrificed much to restore democracy to Panama. The armed
forces of the United States have performed their mission
courageously and effectively. And I again want to express my
gratitude and appreciation to all of them.
   And I want to express the special thanks of our nation to those
servicemen who were wounded and to the families of those who gave
their lives. Their sacrifice has been a noble cause that will never
be forgotten. A free and prosperous Panama will be an enduring
tribute. Thank you all very very much.

   This affluent Boston suburb is getting
particular about who takes the garbage out.
   If the maid or butler isn't the live-in kind and turns up at the
community's state-of-the-art Recycling and Disposal Facility with
their employers' refuse, they will be turned away at the gate,
Department of Public Works Director Pat Berdan said.
   ``If the maid lives in the house, she can (bring in rubbish).
But if it's a hired worker that comes there, no, she can't,''
Berdan said.
   Though well-off, the city still counts its pennies. The Public
Works Department is cracking down on commercial dumpers who try to
evade the $80 per ton dumping fee.
   How does one determine which trash is truly Wellesleyan?
   ``We hold it up to the light and if it has alligators on it, we
know it's from Wellesley,'' Berdan joked.
   In fact, he said, experienced workers will note how often
someone disposes of garbage. Based on an assumption that an
individual produces a daily garbage output of 3 to 5 pounds, the
average family is expected to visit the dump once a week.

great it takes two countries to hold it,'' said Joseph Fratesi,
mayor of Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, a steel mill city of about
83,000 residents.
   Across the St. Marys River and the border is Sault Ste. Marie ,
Mich., a town of about 14,500 and home to Soo Locks, a commercial
shipping passage.
   Lumped together, the twin cities make what locals call the Two
Soos. This fall, they produced a brochure that advertises the towns
as one.
   Tourism has new importance for the Ontario town, which is
dominated by the smokestacks of Algoma Steel Corp. Employment at
the mill has dropped from a peak of 12,500 to current averages of
7,500 workers, Fratesi said.
   ``You can't totally rely on the smoke of our steel mill to build
our economy,'' he said. ``There's no question you'll see less smoke
and more effort to entice people from the United States into
Canada.''

   The last time Dick Thornburgh was in the
federal government he mounted an attack on the Justice Department's
organized crime strike forces with mixed success.
   The outcome of that effort has provided ammunition for both
sides of the argument over his current decision to put the strike
forces under the control of local U.S. attorneys.
   In 1976, Thornburgh was assistant attorney general in charge of
the Criminal Division and was given responsibility for reviewing
the effectiveness of the strike forces on a case-by-case basis.
   The review was an outgrowth of Thornburgh's own 1974
recommendation, as U.S. attorney in Pittsburgh and chairman of a
committee of U.S. attorneys, that the strike forces, which worked
for the organized crime section in Washington, be merged into the
U.S. attorneys' offices.
   Thornburgh closed the New Orleans and St. Louis offices and
merged the strike forces in Pittsburgh and the Southern District of
New York (Manhattan) with U.S. attorneys' offices there.
   There still is no St. Louis strike force, but a local outcry led
by the New Orleans Metropolitan Crime Commission, which also
opposes the current move, persuaded the Justice Department to
reopen the New Orleans strike force two years later. It went on to
convict New Orleans mob boss Carlos Marcello.
   Thornburgh himself regularly points to the successes achieved by
the Southern District in New York during the 1980s as proof that
his plan will provide continued strong pursuit of organized crime.
   Several cases culminated in the 1985 indictment under the
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act of the bosses of
the Genovese, Gambino, Luchese, Bonnano and Colombo families who
made up the mob's governing commission. Four were convicted; one
was murdered.
   Thornburgh told senators this fall that four separate U.S.
attorneys served in Manhattan during the time that case was
investigated.
   Thornburgh's opponents, however, said those successes were
primarily the product of an unusual U.S. attorney, Rudolph
Giuliani, who came to the post in 1983 from the No. 3 job at the
Justice Department.
   ``Giuliani's predecessors also had outstanding records of
achievement, but not in the area of organized crime,'' said Edward
A. McDonald, who quit this summer after seven years as Brooklyn
strike force chief. He told Congress that Giuliani assigned more
than 20 assistants to work on organized crime.
   But after the mob governing commission case, McDonald said,
``Giuliani shifted his focus to public corruption'' and insider
trading and reduced the office's organized crime unit ``by more
than half.''
   McDonald and others argued that the strike forces provided
sustained, long-term enforcement but that the New York experience
showed that even the best U.S. attorneys are easily distracted by
the latest high-profile cases.
   Jeremiah O'Sullivan, who headed the Boston strike force for 10
years, also said that the RICO statute, used by the strike forces
to bring down whole crime hierarchies, had never been used by a
U.S. attorney in Pittsburgh against the organized crime family
there.
   Asked about organized crime in Pittsburgh, Thornburgh's
spokesman, Dave Runkel, paused, then joked, ``My first answer would
be that Thornburgh wiped it out.''
   Although promising to check for a further explanation of the
lack of RICO prosecutions, Runkel provided none.

<HEAD>CDC: AIDS Epidemic Growing More Slowly Than Expected</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's AIDS epidemic may be growing more
slowly than expected, according to an unofficial assessment that
found an apparent drop-off in the number of cases among homosexual
and bisexual men.
   Official estimates of the potential number of AIDS cases,
ranging from 1 million to 1.5 million people, may be too high, said
statisticians attending a closed meeting sponsored by the
Atlanta-based federal Centers for Disease Control.
   Officials said the number of infected people, or eventual AIDS
cases, actually ranges from 700,000 to 1.3 million _ a number that
could lower direct health costs of the epidemic by as much as $12
billion, according to an article published in Thursday's editions
of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
   The new estimates are the outgrowth of a November meeting of
public health officials and mathematicians in Atlanta, called to
find new ways of assessing the impact of the AIDS epidemic on the
health care system.
   The meeting, summarized in the journal Science, also examined
estimates of the total numbers of infections, the number of people
receiving therapy at different stages of the disease and the
implications for the provision of health services, the newspaper
said.
   If the projections are correct, the United States could have
between 5,000 and 12,000 fewer AIDS cases this year than predicted
in 1986 by the U.S. Public Health Service. Next year's toll could
be 20,000 lower.
   ``We're figuring out what the size of the problem is,'' said Dr.
Timothy Dondero, head of the agency's AIDS surveillance program.
   Blood tests of military applicants, trauma patients, blood
donors, childbearing women, Job Corps entrants and federal
prisoners continue to suggest that between 800,000 and 1.3 million
people are now infected with the virus. That estimate is very close
to the new projections derived at the CDC meeting.
   But the unofficial projections are based on mathematical models
that attempt to gauge the extent of the epidemic in the general
population, rather than unrepresentative groups who have been
tested for the virus.
   In 1988, a former CDC expert, Dr. Alex Langmuir, predicted there
would be fewer than 200,000 cases of AIDS in the United States by
1991. Others suggested the number could be as high as 3 million.
   Researchers said the slowdown could be a result of increased
caution among homosexuals, who in 1983 began using more condoms,
limiting the numbers of sexual partners and avoiding high-risk
sexual activity in bathhouses and group settings.
   Others believe that drugs such as AZT and aerosol pentamidine,
available for use beginning in 1986 and 1987, may have slowed the
onset of AIDS in people who began taking it before they developed
symptoms of the disease.

   A bomb threat Wednesday night prompted
Northwest Airlines officials to delay a flight about to depart for
Newark, N.J., but no bomb was found and the plane took off two
hours late.
   Northwest Flight 1192 had been scheduled to leave Detroit
Metropolitan Airport at 9:55 p.m. EST Wednesday, said Northwest
spokesman Bob Gibbons in Minnesota, where the airline is based.
   ``Just before departure we got a threatening phone call,'' he
said. ``We searched the plane. Nothing was found.''
   The flight took off at 11:55 p.m. and was expected to land in
Newark at 1:11 a.m. Thursday, the airline said. Gibbons said it was
to carry 45 passengers and six crew members.
   Gibbons withheld details about Wednesday night's threat.
   Northwest last week revealed that it had received a bomb threat
for a flight last Saturday from Paris to Detroit and offered
passengers the option of changing or canceling their reservations
with no penalty.
   Gibbons said Wednesday night's threat was the first Northwest
had received since then.

<HEAD>Labor Federation Wants to Visit Soviet Miners</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KAREN BALL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The AFL-CIO, which is hosting a visit by nine
Soviet miners trying to form independent unions, is still pressing
the Soviet government to let U.S. labor leaders visit there, the
federation's president says.
   The Soviet government refused about a month ago to let an
AFL-CIO delegation visit workers in the Soviet Union interested in
setting up independent trade unions.
   The nine Soviet miners met Wednesday with AFL-CIO President Lane
Kirkland and United Mine Workers President Richard Trumka as part
of their month-long study of U.S. labor unions and mining and
safety practices.
   Kirkland, referring to the tentative settlement reached this
week to end a bitter nine-month UMW strike against The Pittston
Co., told the Soviet miners that workers trying to ``gain a better
life for their families must face and deal with powerful and
entrenched forces in every society.''
   ``That is certainly true here,'' he said.
   Also Wednesday, the AFL-CIO called on the Soviet government to
reverse last week's decision to revoke the passport and exit visa
of a miner who had been scheduled to make the tour, Sergei
Masalovich.
   The AFL-CIO says the Soviet government inaccurately claimed the
strike leader was relieved of his duties by the Vorkuta Strike
Committee.
   The miners are the guests of the AFL-CIO but the trip is being
paid for through a U.S. Information Agency exchange program.
   The Soviets are scheduled to visit mines in Virginia or West
Virginia, the Colorado School of Mines, meet labor leaders in
Pittsburgh and Atlanta and attend a Texas state AFL-CIO convention
on political activity.
   When Kirkland announced the Soviets' visit last month, he
compared their struggle to that of Solidarity organizers in Poland
in the early 1980s and pledged to offer the federation's support
even if it meant defying the Soviet government.
   The AFL-CIO's support of Solidarity included the smuggling of
printing and other communications equipment into Poland when
Solidarity was outlawed. In all, the federation gave about $5
million worth of equipment and other assistance to Solidarity.

<HEAD>Bush Ponders Fee to Promote Recycling</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush is considering a proposal that
would bolster environmental protection by taxing industries that
don't use recycled materials.
   The unspecified fee on raw materials, which would be imposed on
substances such as glass, paper and aluminum, is likely to be
included in Bush's fiscal 1991 budget when it is submitted to
Congress Jan. 29, said officials who spoke on the condition of
anonymity.
   The proposal might appear to violate Bush's commitment against
higher taxes. But administration officials suggested the levy would
be classified more as a ``user fee,'' and thus escape the
no-new-taxes edict.
   Meanwhile, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Wednesday
that the administration has dropped a budget proposal for a new tax
on recreational vehicles to pay for conservation measures.
   The administration ``decided there probably was a better way to
do that,'' Fitzwater said. The RV ``fee'' was included in an early
draft budget.
   Details were still sketchy because administration officials
would not discuss details of the emerging 1991 budget. But the
raw-materials proposal is designed to provide an economic incentive
for industries to use recycled goods rather than virgin materials.
   The tax would not be applied to recycled substances.
   ``We want to encourage recycling, for obvious reasons,'' said
deputy White House press secretary Stephen Hart on Wednesday. He
said promotion of recycling is part of the major emphasis Bush
intends to put on environmental issues this year.
   Bush on Wednesday signed a proclamation designating next April
22 as the 20th annual Earth Day. He said the day will be a chance
``to reflect on the progress made over the past 20 years and set
the environmental agenda for the next decade.''
   Earth Day ``should inspire us to save the land we love, to
realize that global problems do have local solutions, and to make
preservation of the planet a personal commitment.''
   The president also called on Congress to work ``quickly,
carefully and responsibly'' to approve strengthening amendments to
the Clean Air Act. Congress recessed for the year without
completing work on a legislative package to rework air quality
standards.
   Fitzwater asserted anew that Bush's new budget, for the fiscal
year that begins Oct. 1, will contain no new taxes. But he said it
would feature ``some very interesting programs.''
   Administration officials frequently seek to draw a distinction
between a widely applied tax and a more narrowly targeted ``user
fee,'' even though the distinction may be lost on those who pay the
levy.

<HEAD>First Lady Takes Radiation Treatment Swimmingly</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Barbara Bush will get nine more radiation
treatments for a troublesome eye ailment after sailing through her
first one and then jumping in the White House pool for a mile swim.
   Mrs. Bush, who aides said felt fine after the Wednesday
treatment, is undergoing the radiation to try and cure double
vision and tearing eyes that drugs have failed to correct. The eye
ailment results from Graves disease, an immune system ailment that
earlier attacked her thyroid.
   The thyroid condition has been remedied through drugs and
radioactive treatment that rendered her thyroid inactive. But the
eye symptoms have persisted despite treatment with prednisone, a
powerful steroid.
   If the 10 doses of radiation don't work, she may have to
consider surgery to relieve pressure in the eye socket or to
reattach malfunctioning muscles, experts say.
   Mrs. Bush was at Walter Reed Army Medical Center for more than
three hours on Wednesday for the 10-minute radiation treatment plus
examinations, said her press secretary, Anna Perez.
   ``She said it was like a trip to the dentist, only better,''
Perez said. ``She went swimming right after she came back,'' doing
her customary mile of laps in the heated outdoor pool at the White
House. She later was seen walking about the White House grounds in
a sweatsuit.
   The low-level radiation treatment is intended to halt swelling
in the small muscles that control movements of the eyes.
   Medical experts not associated with the case said such treatment
is routine for Graves' disease eye patients who have not responded
to other therapy. The radiation treatment is not considered
dangerous.
   ``The published studies report 60 to 90 percent of patients have
a favorable response to this treatment,'' said Dr. Joshua Cohen, an
endocrinology specialist at George Washington University Medical
Center.
   The treatment does not cause side effects, said the experts.

<HEAD>Task Force Envisions Some Drilling at Offshore Sites, Say Sources</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal task force is recommending a wide
array of options for oil development at three controversial
offshore sites near Florida and California and none of the choices
would ban drilling altogether, according to administration sources.
   The task force report was to go to the White House today,
according to Interior Department officials who said it would not be
made public.
   Sources familiar with the recommendations said Wednesday the
options for the leases off the California coast would envision oil
and gas development, but in some cases include specific conditions,
restrictions and various timetables.
   The task force adopted more restrictive options for the lease
off the Florida coast, according to one source, including one that
could delay development for several years because of environmental
concerns.
   The possible damage to sensitive coral reefs was cited by the
task force in the Florida lease, according to one source.
   The sources spoke only on the condition that they not be
identified further.
   As only scant information about the task force findings could be
obtained, several congressmen called for the report to be released
by the Bush administration.
   ``I see no reason for keeping this report a secret,'' said Rep.
Dante Fascell, D-Fla. ``Failure to release this latest study can
only add to the suspicion, mistrust and confusion that has
surrounded the entire (oil lease) program.''
   Rep. Frank Pallone, D-N.J., said the secrecy ``creates the
perception that the administration does not want to allow this
report to be circulated ... that the public is being shut out of
this decision-making process.''
   The task force was headed by Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan and
included representatives of the Energy Department, Environmental
Protection Agency, Commerce Department and Office of Management and
Budget.
   Interior spokesman Steve Goldstein said Wednesday the report
outlines nine options _ three for each of the three leases _ and
covers ``the gamut'' of approaches President Bush could take in
deciding whether to proceed with the sale of the three leases.
   The recommendations ``are designed to give the president the
greatest amount of latitude in decision making,'' said Goldstein.
He declined to provide further details, only characterizing the
options as ``not black and white, but shades of gray.''
   The task force completed late editing changes in the report this
week. It's not known when Bush would make a decision on whether to
proceed with any of the lease sales, which he had put on hold a
year ago pending the task force review.
   Environmentalists have strongly opposed oil and gas drilling at
the three lease sites. The leases involved potential oil and gas
drilling on 1.1 million acres of ocean off Southern California, 6.7
million acres off Northern California and 14 million acres off the
Florida Everglades in the Gulf of Mexico.
   Two months ago, a panel of the National Academy of Sciences
questioned whether enough information was available to make a
prudent decision on drilling at the sites. That study said
technical and scientific data was ``insufficient'' to warrant
leases being issued at this time.
   At the time, Robert Kallman, task force director, said the
scientific panel's findings clarified some of the issues involved
and would be taken into account, but did not necessarily rule out
an option that leases be issued.

   The indictment of Atlantic City Mayor James
L. Usry for influence peddling was grim but hardly unprecedented
news for the seaside gaming resort, which also saw three of its
previous six mayors face charges.
   ``I'd say that the people of Atlantic City are numb already,''
City Councilman Seth Grossman said after the indictments were
announced Wednesday, five months after Usry was arrested. ``All we
want is a resolution to find out what exactly happened.''
   ``Atlantic City is deteriorating a little more every day and
these indictments have shed some light on why this deterioration is
taking place,'' said state Assemblywoman Dolores Cooper, a
Republican who is the only declared candidate in the city's race
for mayor this year.
   A state grand jury in Trenton handed up indictments of Usry and
three others as part of a wide-ranging probe of influence peddling
among government officials of the seaside resort.
   Usry, president of the National Conference of Black Mayors, was
charged in two separate indictments with conspiracy, official
misconduct, bribery, gifts to public servants and violating the
state campaign contribution law.
   If convicted of all charges, he faces up to 36 years in prison
and $315,000 in fines. His predecessor is serving a 15-year
sentence for extortion.
   Also indicted were businessmen Ernest English and Clarence
Gillard, and Robert Harrison, a former official with the New Jersey
Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency.
   An aide said the 67-year-old Republican mayor, who has not
announced whether he will seek re-election, will not resign. ``The
mayor has no intention of resigning,'' said Rosalind Norrell-Nance.
   English said he believes the state's case is weak. Gillard and
Harrison could not be reached for comment. Home listings could not
be obtained.
   The indictment charges that Usry solicited bribes from English
and businessman Ronald Bizzell in exchange for supporting their
proposed motorized cart business on the boardwalk. Usry allegedly
accepted $6,000 from an informant in exchange for supporting the
cart business.
   Authorities said $6,000 in cash was found in Usry's home when he
was arrested July 27, but the mayor's attorney said the money was a
contribution for a children's charity from a local businessman
relayed through Usry.
   The indictment charges English and Gillard with allegedly
agreeing to pay Usry $300,000 to support the ordinance change.
   According to the indictment, Usry told English, a former boxer,
``You have to pay. Boxers pay to fight in other people's towns.''
   English, 32, and Gillard, age unknown, both face a maximum of 35
years and $307,500 in fines if convicted on all counts of
conspiracy, bribery, gifts to public servants and attempted theft.
   Harrison, the former human resources and minority affairs
manager at the state housing agency, was charged with using his
state office and directing members of his staff to plan a
testimonial dinner to Usry during working hours.
   Harrison, 41, also is charged with tampering with evidence and
refusing to cooperate with the probe. He faces up to 38 years in
prison and $237,500 in fines if convicted on all charges.
   No arraignment date was set for the four men, said Christopher
Florentz, spokesman for the state attorney general's office.
   On Dec. 19, the grand jury indicted four top Atlantic City
officials, including the City Council president, and seven others
on corruption charges. Those defendants are expected to be
arraigned Monday, Florentz said.
   Usry was elected in 1984 after a recall election for Michael
Matthews, who defeated Usry in 1982. Matthews is serving a 15-year
prison sentence for extortion.

<DATELINE>FORT CLAYTON, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The women warriors who helped invade
Panama have shattered myths about gender in combat and made
mincemeat of a congressional ban.
   ``It blew everyone's theories,'' said 2nd Lt. Kimberly Thompson,
23. ``Now they are regrouping.''
   Despite the ban on women in combat, female soldiers vindicated
themselves so well that the White House is leaping to their defense
and a leading senator said the exclusion should be re-examined.
   Thompson, a platoon leader in the 988th Military Police Company
from Fort Benning, Ga., knows the myths well. She is
third-generation military and the wife of an airborne Ranger, a
private who stayed home while she went to war.
   ``He's proud of me,'' she said of her husband, Steve Thompson.
``He wishes he could have been here too.''
   Myth No. 1: Women can't handle combat.
   Capt. Linda Bray led the 988th into battle, storming the gates
of a Panamanian Defense Forces kennel in an armored jeep.
   ``It was an important military operation. A woman led it and she
did an outstanding job,'' White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
said Wednesday.
   Bray's troops took the area after a 30-minute firefight in which
three of the defenders were killed. There were no U.S. casualties.
   ``She knew exactly what to do and when to do it,'' said one of
her platoon leaders, Sgt. Rick McGowan. ``Her voice didn't quaver
when she gave an order.''
   Myth No. 2: Men would spend their time protecting the women
instead of fighting the enemy.
   ``Sex doesn't come into play. You don't really think about it,''
McGowan said. ``I wasn't going to put a female squad leader over in
a corner. It wouldn't have been fair.''
   When the top sergeant called for a machine gunner to advance, no
one was thinking about Pvt. Christina Cabido's gender. They were
thinking about firepower.
   ``I felt like we fought side by side. I felt equality,'' she
said. ``You don't always feel that in the Army.''
   Cabido, a 20-year-old from Strawberry, Ariz., recalled how she
felt as her platoon went into battle.
   ``We were all scared. But we really pulled together as a team,''
she said. ``I thought: Congress doesn't let females in combat. But
I was going. I was going.'''
   Sen. John Warner, R-Va., ranking minority member of Senate Armed
Service Committee, said Wednesday in Panama that it is time to take
another look at the ban.
   The women warriors in Panama ```discharged themselves in a very
credible military, professional manner,'' he told a news conference.
   He said what happened in Panama ``will require the Congress once
again to re-examine the present laws surrounding the training and
the use of women in situations such as this.''
   Both law and military policy bar women from being assigned to
units, like the infantry, whose main job is to fight the enemy. But
women, who make up 11 percent of the military, serve in the
military police and in support roles ranging from intelligence to
infantry.
   In this case, the MP unit got what turned out to be a combat
assignment.
   Another woman, U.S. Army special agent Julie Torres, was on a
three-person team assigned to Gen. Marc Cisneros, commander of U.S.
Army troops in Panama. At one point, when bullets started flying,
she threw herself on him and shoved his head behind an armored
truck, according the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.
   ``That's our mission. You take the round. Not him,'' she said.
   The Pentagon says that 600 of the 26,000 U.S. troops who took
part in the invasion were women; none were among the 23 killed.
   The 988th has about 120 soldiers, at least a dozen of them
women. About half of them will win combat patches for the kennel
attack and other firefights around town, something few soldiers in
today's peacetime Army can boast.
   Army spokeswoman Paige Eversole said that battle lines blur in
modern warfare.
   ``Even people in support units, where many women are, are going
to be vulnerable to modern weapons where they are aimed at troops
beyond the front line,'' she said in Washington.
   Thompson and Cabido are proud they have proved themselves under
fire and think the ban on women in combat should be lifted.
   ``If they do it, it's going to be a long, hard battle,'' Cabido
said. ``There's a lot of men in the Army who won't like it.''

   Crime fighters in this city's tougher
neighborhoods, who have pledged to win their war in the 1990s, can
claim a victory as the decade dawns.
   They beat back gang hats.
   When word went out Wednesday that Northside Family Sports had
started selling baseball-style caps inscribed with the names of two
local gangs, community activists moved in swiftly.
   Within hours, the shop's owner promised to stop selling them.
   ``If we let this store go then the one on the next block is
going to start selling the same kind of stuff,'' said Georgette
Watson, a recent target of gang threats.
   ``We've got to stop this kind of thing before it turns around
everything we've been working for,'' added Watson, who has been
under 24-hour police protection since a gang allegedly placed a
$5,000 bounty on her last month.
   Watson, founder of the Drop-A-Dime anti-drug tip hot line, was
among a contingent of community leaders who went to Jack Malone's
sporting goods store to let him know what they thought of his new
merchandise.
   Malone said he was unaware the hats, which were ordered at the
request of customers, bore gang-related insignias and assured the
activists no more special orders would be taken. The caps, selling
for $12.99 each, were inscribed with the gang names, ``Castlegate''
and ``IVP Intervale.''
   ``I'd rather nip this thing in the bud,'' Malone said. ``The
last thing I want to see is gangs being promoted.''
   His decision was probably made easier by the appearance at his
doorstep of the mayor, police commissioner, district police
superintendent and about a dozen community leaders from the
Roxbury, Dorchester and Mattapan neighborhoods.
   Mayor Raymond L. Flynn, Police Commissioner Francis Roache and
Police Deputy Superintendent William Celester met with Watson and
other community leaders Wednesday at a doughnut shop adjacent to
the sporting goods store.
   ``It's a free country, but that doesn't mean you have to do this
kind of thing in this community,'' Celester said. ``These leaders
know what to do.''
   The activists stressed they didn't want to come on like
vigilantes.
   ``We didn't come here to close anybody down,'' said Joan Almeida
of the Neighborhood Justice Network. ``We came to talk.''
   Still, some merchants and residents said the activists had gone
too far.
   ``Are we going to stop selling gang members food to eat or
clothes to wear?'' asked one police officer who did not want to be
identified. ``It sounds like Hitler's Germany to me.''
   Yvonne Waith and her daughter, who work next door at a beauty
parlor, said the activists' efforts were misplaced.
   ``What about the guns? Never mind the hats,'' Mrs. Waith said.
``There are much more important battles than this.''
   The inner-city battle against gang- and drug-related crime has
been fierce. Residents say they want to reclaim the turf lost to
gun-toting adolescents _ not cater to them by producing ``status''
merchandise.
   Grass-roots organizer Ben Haith said the community reacted to
the logo-inscribed caps ``strongly and with outrage'' because they
go against so much of what parents, kids and local merchants have
been working for.
   ``There are a lot of people in the community that have
businesses and who feel the pains of the violence here,'' he said.

   A would-be robber dressed as a woman detonated
two bombs at a bank before fleeing on foot and littering the street
with money as he tried to escape, the FBI said.
   Police bomb experts said it was a miracle no one was injured in
the Wednesday morning blast.
   Lloyd Walter Dickerson, 36, was arrested several blocks away by
a police officer, who said the man smelled of smoke and had powder
burns on his hands.
   He was charged with bank robbery and was being held pending a
court appearance today before a federal magistrate, said Jim
Dearborn, an FBI spokesman. The federal bank robbery charge carries
a maximum penalty of 25 years in prison, Dearborn said.
   Police said Dickerson demanded money from a teller, and set off
a smoke bomb after the bank employee apparently hesitated. After
the smoke bomb went off, bank officials gave an undisclosed amount
of money to Dickerson, who then detonated a fragmentation bomb made
of match heads stuffed inside a small fire extinguisher, police
said.
   The second bomb sent pieces of metal flying for a half-block and
broke windows, damaged an automatic teller machine and a parked car
at the Maryland National Bank branch.
   The robber was chased for several blocks by two men. Dickerson
littered the street with $10 and $20 bills and dropped a bag
containing four more bombs while fleeing, police said.
   ``I heard an explosion and a man came running down the street.
Somebody said he robbed the bank so I chased him through the
alleyway,'' said Jim Phillips. ``He stopped in front of a car and
took off some of his clothes and a wig and sunglasses he had on.''
   The two eventually lost sight of the robber. A police officer
several blocks away spotted Dickerson, who matched a description of
the robber.

<BYLINE>Actor Fights Mother's Claim He's Incompetent
^By LINDA DEUTSCH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge said she wants more information
before deciding whether to hear a petition from the mother of Gary
Coleman claiming that the diminutive actor is incompetent to handle
his financial affairs.
   Edmonia Sue Coleman, of Zion, Ill., filed a conservatorship
petition in Superior Court on Dec. 4 contending that her
21-year-old son's deteriorating physical and mental condition puts
him at ``significant risk of financial exploitation.''
   Coleman's lawyer, Charles Wake, denied the allegations
Wednesday, filing papers saying that the actor is in good health
and mentally competent to handle his own business affairs. He
alleged that Mrs. Coleman is merely trying to wrest control of her
son's fortune.
   Superior Court Judge Martha Goldin appointed attorney Arne
Lindgren to represent Coleman temporarily and determine whether his
own lawyers have a conflict of interest. She also told Lindgren to
interview Coleman and his doctors and submit a report on the
actor's health.
   Coleman was born with an atrophied right kidney and has
undergone two transplants during a childhood requiring frequent
dialysis treatments and use of various prescribed drugs, the court
documents said.
   The 4-foot-5-inch actor, who gained fame in the TV series
``Diff'rent Strokes,'' appeared cheerful and alert in court and
told reporters he hoped for a resolution of the case soon.
   Mrs. Coleman, absent from the hearing, has asked that a
conservator be appointed for her son and that her bank, U.S. Trust
Co. of California, be placed in control of assets that include $46
million in property and an annual income of $750,000.
   ``It appears that the prolonged use of (prescribed) drugs, fluid
exchanges, machine dependency and failure to follow the medically
recommended diet and regimen has had a cumulative, debilitating
effect on Gary,'' her petition said.
   She claimed her son was puffy-faced and disoriented ``and unable
to understand or respond to simple questions.''
   In response, Wake said the actor follows a regular dialysis
program and ``is in good health, is competent and is able to manage
his personal, professional and business affairs.''
   ``Edmonia Sue Coleman's petition is no more than an attempt by
Mrs. Coleman to wrest control of Gary Coleman's personal and
financial affairs away from him as a defense tactic in connection
with a civil lawsuit'' by Coleman against his parents, Wake
maintained.
   In that lawsuit, Coleman alleges that his parents and a former
business adviser, Anita De Thomas, mismanaged his funds and
misappropriated assets for their own benefit.
   The judge postponed proceedings to Jan. 31 over objections by
Wake, who said Coleman's career is suffering from publicity about
his mother's allegations.

<TEXT>
   Redoubt Volcano slipped into slumber
after gushing ash and steam eight miles high, but air traffic
remained disrupted because of concerns about engine-clogging
fallout.
   ``Seismically, the volcano is fairly quiet right now,''
geologist Robert McGimsey of the Alaska Volcano Observatory said
Wednesday afternoon. ``We have no reports of eruptions.''
   Scientists said it was too early to predict what the reduced
seismic activity might mean. They said they would not be surprised
if seismic energy rebuilds again at the mountain 115 miles
southwest of Anchorage.
   The Alaska Volcano Observatory recorded the last explosive
eruption at 2:44 a.m. Wednesday. The volcano's first violent
eruption in days came at 5:48 p.m. Tuesday. It was the largest
since Redoubt thundered awake in mid-December after a 25-year sleep.
   Pilots on Tuesday reported a plume of ash and steam to 40,000
feet and what appeared to be lava flowing down the volcano's
northwest flank, observatory scientists said.
   The Federal Aviation Administration said there were no pilots'
reports of ash on Wednesday, and the Alaska Division of Emergency
Services reported no significant ash accumulations on the ground.
   Nevertheless, Delta and United airlines canceled flights until
at least today and international airlines, some of which use
Anchorage as a refueling stop, diverted planes to other airports.
   Alaska Airlines said it offered all but two of its scheduled
flights. MarkAir, an intrastate carrier, resumed daylight flying
Wednesday after a three-hour delay.
   The failure of all four engines on a KLM Royal Dutch Airlines
passenger jet last month was blamed on ash from Redoubt. The plane
made a safe emergency landing in Anchorage after the engines were
restarted.
   Scientists tried to check on the reported lava flow Wednesday,
but clouds frustrated an attempted aerial observation.
   ``They didn't get any kind of visual on the volcano at all,''
McGimsey said. ``It was a real disappointing flight.''
   The observers found at least one large mudflow was generated by
the eruption Tuesday. Mud filled the 1\-mile-wide flood plain of
the Drift River and extended about 20 miles, the Volcano
Observatory said in a news release. Boulders up to about 13 feet in
diameter were observed.
   Some flooding was evident at the Drift River oil storage
facility 20 miles from the volcano, the observatory said. Water
flowed around a levee but did not penetrate dikes protecting
individual tanks. Flood waters also crossed an airstrip.
   Cook Inlet Pipe Line Co., operator of the Drift River facility,
on Tuesday evacuated the 11 people who were there. The company said
weather and ash on Wednesday prevented it from determining when
operations might resume. Power at the facility was interrupted, the
company said.
   After a quarter century of silence, the peak erupted Dec. 13 and
spewed ash 33,000 feet into the air the next day. Varying levels of
seismic activity continued through the month.

   So the ordinary, everyday, ear-splitting boom
box has been made into a weapon of war, and there's no knowing
where that may lead.
   Those radio-cassette players with stereo speakers are menace
enough in peacetime, clearing streets and public parks as platoons
of youthful rock fanciers blare their music at migraine volume.
   And that was before Panama, where the United States decided to
go after Manuel Antonio Noriega, no decibels barred. He could run
to the Vatican embassy, but he couldn't hide; not when U.S.
soldiers brought in the stereo speakers, set them up in a parking
lot across the street, turned up the volume and tuned in armed
forces radio rock.
   There went the neighborhood.
   Troops and everybody else in the area had to converse in shouts
as numbers like ``You're No Good,'' ``Voodoo Chile,'' ``Welcome to
the Jungle,'' and ``Nowhere to Run, Nowhere to Hide'' boomed day
and night from olive drab, government-issue speakers.
   Noriega, who surrendered Wednesday night and was put on a plane
to the United States, fancies opera, making a high decibel diet of
rock plus country and western numbers seem a sort of musical
torture. But the noise spared no one, and the Roman Catholic
diplomats stationed at the embassy presumably were more comfortable
with plainsong than disco music.
   ``Baby, You're No Good,'' the speakers blared. And ``I Fought
the Law and the Law Won.''
   After a day and a half, a Vatican spokesman said the musical
assault was unacceptable. Another day of it and word came from the
mission that the din was keeping diplomats and clerics awake while
Noriega slept and the Vatican was contemplating unspecified
``further steps'' if it continued. The rock barrage was turned down
last Friday.
   ``I think it aggravated the people inside,'' President Bush said
Saturday. ``It has stopped. It would have aggravated me, I'll tell
you. I'm not into rock. Country music, maybe that's different.''
   Not at that volume.
   The military didn't explain the rock tactic; Bush's spokesman
said it was a communications technique.
   ``There was an attempt to disrupt communications so that we
could have some guarantees of the security of our conversations,''
said press secretary Marlin Fitzwater. ``Fairly standard practice.''
   He said music was played to disrupt microwaves and interfere
with electronic eavesdropping when White House staff members
conferred at the U.S. Embassy in Moscow during President Reagan's
1988 summit meeting with Mikhail S. Gorbachev. Not around the
clock, though.
   Who was eavesdropping in Panama City?
   ``I'd let your imagination deal with that one,'' Fitzwater said,
sidestepping the question of whether the racket was supposed to
prevent reporters with electronic gear from tuning in on military
conversations and street corner talks with the papal envoy.
   When the Pope's man in Panama City can come under rock music
assault, nobody's safe.
   Arms negotiations stalled? Let them hear about it. Turn up ``Big
Planet, Scary Planet.'' In a while, if there's still no deal,
escalate to ``Armageddon It.''
   Bush has been telling people to read his lips for so long that
it's become trite; next time Congress talks about raising taxes he
can break out the boom box and let it shout. ``Can U Read My
Lips?'' and ``I Won't Back Down.''
   Vice presidential problems? Get Dan Quayle a stereo and let him
advertise: ``Giving You the Best That I've Got.'' Bush has already
assured his No. 2 man of renomination. Now, when necessary, he can
play ``It's You Again,'' loudly enough to drown out the doubters.
   ``My Prerogative,'' the presidential boom box can blare.

Newborns</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Health officials hope to reduce the state's high
rate of underweight newborns with a program that extends prenatal
care to expectant mothers outside the health care mainstream.
   The program, Better Beginnings, will furnish medical care,
financial assistance, nutrition counseling, follow-up counselors to
encourage pregnant women to see doctors regularly, and a
combination outreach-education effort to increase public awareness,
officials said.
   It will ``give these babies ... at least a fighting chance at
starting out healthy,'' John Fairman, the head of the Denver
Department of Health and Hospitals, said Wednesday.
   A recent study showed only the District of Columbia and six
southern states had higher rates of newborn babies weighing less
than 5{ pounds than Colorado. The program will be coordinated
through Denver General Hospital, where the rate of low birth-weight
babies, 12.3 percent, is nearly twice the national average of 6.8
percent, officials said.
   The problem is most severe among newborn babies whose mothers
either received no prenatal care, or who first saw a doctor late in
their pregnancies. Denver General officials said 22 percent of the
deliveries at the hospital are to women in those categories.
   Such babies are at much higher risk of incurring serious health
problems requiring extended hospitalization at birth, have a higher
chance for lifelong physical handicaps, and have a higher death
rate.
   ``We still have many pregnant women whose first contact with a
physician is on the day they show up at a delivery room,'' said
Terri Bailey, director of the Perinatal Project at Denver General.
``A lack of prenatal care correlates strongly with babies who are
born too early, or born weighing less than 5.5 pounds. Such babies
are 40 times more likely to die during their first year, or to
experience serious long-term physician and developmental problems.''
   In 1988, Denver General delivered 183 babies to women who had
not been seen by a doctor during their pregnancies.
   Better Beginnings will attempt to contact expectant mothers who
normally would not seek out prenatal care and put them in touch
with doctors at Denver-area clinics. Brochures printed in Spanish
and English will be circulated. Counselors also will provide health
advice to the mothers.
   Fairman said a large part of the problem is just getting the
word out about routine prenatal care.
   ``This problem is not unlike the issue of seat belts. We know
seat belts save lives,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   A Czech who has spent the past decade in exile
is launching a conservative party to contest Czechoslovakia's first
post-communist election on a platform of scrapping military ties
with Moscow in favor of neutrality or alliance with the West.
   ``The Warsaw Pact ... has no place in our future. We feel that
the question of active neutrality or adherence to Western
collective security must be decided by a nationwide referendum
after the free elections'' promised for June, said Dr. Jiri Kotas.
   The economic program of his Party of Constitutional Democracy
will be all-out conservative, stressing ``gradual but vigorous''
privatization of the state-managed economy and ``the most favorable
conditions for Western capital investment,'' Kotas, 37, said in
remarks prepared for appearances Thursday in Washington.
   A critic of the communist regime who fled Czechoslovakia in
1979, Kotas has been living in Ottawa, Canada. He said he plans to
return to Prague Jan. 13 to organize the new party, bringing
together conservatives in the homeland with those in exile.
   An early move will be to propose that the Federal Assembly order
redistribution among all parties of part of the money amassed by
the Communist Party in ``decades of misrule,'' Kotas said.
   Campaign financing will be crucial to fair elections, he said,
along with equal radio and television time.
   Election observers from ``classically democratic countries''
should be invited, Kotas said. Their presence might be a technical
infringement of sovereignty but it is justified ``after 40 years of
dictatorship,'' Kotas said.
   Czechoslovakia managed to break free of communist rule
peacefully in late November because at the crucial moment the
Kremlin messaged the faltering leadership that it would not help
them, Kotas said, triggering resignation of the entire politburo.
   He termed the current coalition transition government, led by
anti-communist ex-dissident President Vaclav Havel and Communist
Prime Minister Marian Calfa, his homeland's best government since
the 1948 communist takeover and ``the best possible at the moment.''
   Kotas said he opted for all-out conservativism feeling that the
best antidote to communist misrule ``was to completely embrace its
absolute opposite _ to adopt the Western concept of freedom, both
political and economic.'' He credited the Heritage Foundation and
similar conservative groups as playing a major role ``in my
intellectual and political maturing.''
   Some Czechoslovak experts question how far the country will
abandon socialist economics. Pre-communist Presidents Tomas G.
Masaryk and Eduard Benes were Social Democrats, they recalled.
   Ohio State University history and journalism professor Jiri
Hochman said in his opinion the Czechoslovaks ``want democracy but
at the same time don't want to give up social security or job
security.''
   Hochman noted that Havel has upheld full employment, social
security and national health service in terms similar to those used
by the communist reformer, Assembly Chairman Alexander Dubcek.

   This city, where the last ship bringing
slaves landed 131 years ago, will have its first black police chief.
   The City Council on Wednesday hired Harold L. Johnson Jr.,
police chief of Ecorse, Mich., and a 25-year veteran of the Detroit
Police Department. Johnson, 48, will take over as chief Feb. 1.
   The City Council also named Charleston, S.C., Chief Reuben
Greenberg, who is black, as public safety director, also starting
Feb. 1.
   They face opposition in the department, which is 13 percent
black.
   ``We don't know what to expect,'' said Lt. Sam Cochran, vice
president of the Mobile County Law Enforcement Association.
   Cochran, who is white, said some officers were opposed to the
high salaries for Johnson and Greenberg. He said race was not a
factor in opposing the hirings.
   Johnson's salary is expected to be $65,000 or more. Greenberg
received a six-month, $50,000 contract as public safety director
and said he would return to Charleston afterward.
   Cochran said the opposition could be overcome with improved pay
and benefits for the 357 uniformed officers. Beginning salary is
about $14,000, with annual raises of 5 percent, but Cochran said
some officers have been denied raises for the last few years
because of budget problems.
   The seven-member council, which includes three blacks,
unanimously approved hiring Greenberg. One councilman abstained on
the Johnson vote, which was otherwise unanimously approved.
   Mobile's population of 200,000 is about 37 percent black.
   Arlene Williams, a spokeswoman for the National Organization of
Black Law Enforcement Executives in Washington, D.C., said there
are about 130 black chiefs in the country.

   A community activist's house was
sprayed with gunfire in the neighborhood where she has battled drug
dealers for years.
   C.W. Roddy, 60, suffered a flesh wound in the stomach early
Monday from the attack and was treated and released from the
hospital.
   ``All of a sudden I heard the whole front open up with gunfire.
It went through my walls, it went through my bedsprings, it went
through my kitchen, it went through my furniture,'' said Roddy, who
was watching television in her bedroom when the assault occurred.
   ``It makes me angry. It makes me so angry. I am so full of rage,
I could kill.''
   Residents of the drug-plagued neighborhood say the shooting is
at least the third such attack on anti-drug neighbors.
   No arrests have been made and the motive for the New Year's Day
shooting was unknown, East Palo Alto Police Cmdr. Frank Churchill
said Wednesday. He called it ``only speculation'' that the attack
was intended as a scare tactic against the anti-drug activist.
   But residents in the Westminster neighborhood, where the
shooting occurred, believe retaliation is the motive behind the
shooting.
   Roddy has spent years denouncing dealers who set up shop outside
her home and has appeared at City Council meetings to demand action
for an end to the drug traffic plaguing her neighborhood.
   She said she has been the target of dealers, particularly since
last year, when they began to ``work in shifts, 24 hours a day,
seven days a week'' along her block.
   Last fall, when she asked one dealer to move his truck away from
her house, he punched her in the face, Roddy said. Several days
before Christmas, her house was raked by gunfire, she said.
   In March 1988, after residents of the block next to Roddy's
organized an anti-drug campaign, the window of one of their homes
was hit by a single bullet during a meeting. A year later,
residents said, a couple had bricks thrown through the window of
their home on the next street.
   Churchill said police are unaware of any pattern of harassment
against drug activists.
   ``On New Year's Eve,there were bullets sprayed into other homes
and residences,'' Churchill said.

<HEAD>Dollar Up In Tokyo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar finished the first trading day of the
year stronger against the Japanese yen, and its rise Thursday sent
share prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange moderately lower.
   After opening higher at 145.55 yen, the dollar closed the day of
trading at 145.20 yen, 1.80 yen above its previous close of 143.40
yen on Friday. Financial markets were closed Monday through
Wednesday for the holidays.
   The official Bank of Japan sold hundreds of millions of dollars
in an attempt to drive down the value of the U.S. currency.
   Despite the initial intervention, the dollar rose to the day's
high of 145.72 yen during the morning session. Repeated infusions
of dollars by the central bank turned the currency around to a low
of 144.90 yen shortly before the morning close.
   In the afternoon, the dollar recrossed the 145-yen line and then
traded in a fairly narrow range.
   Mitsuhiko Kinugasa, a dealer at Daiwa Bank, said the central
bank sold about $500 million during the morning session, and an
equal amount in currency markets overseas during the previous two
days.
   Kinugasa termed the intervention successful. ``The dollar was
not as strong as it might have been.''
   The central bank does not comment on its monetary policies.
   In a half-day session of trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange,
share prices fell on news of the dollar's strength. The leading
market barometer finished the session down 202.99 points to
38,712.88, a drop of 0.52 percent on a first section volume of 400
million shares.
   The stock market's decline reversed four days of gains in the
last few trading sessions of 1989, and stood in contrast to other
major exchanges.
   Masahiro Umemori, of Nomura Securities' investment research
division, said the market was discouraged by the dollar's rise.
   Umemori said, ``The Tokyo market went against the global current
today, falling despite rises on the major markets overseas.''
   A weak bond market also contributed to the slide, he said.

   A federal judge has ruled an injured
political protester was not legally responsible for traumatizing
those who injured him.
   Crewmen of a Navy weapons train that ran over and maimed S.
Brian Willson in 1987 cannot sue the activist and his fellow
demonstrators for causing them emotional distress, U.S. District
Judge Robert Peckham said in a pretrial ruling released Wednesday.
   ``I'm sure it's a great relief to Brian Willson and his wife to
no longer be facing claims that they're required to compensate the
crew for emotional distress caused by running over them,'' said
their chief lawyer, Thomas Steel.
   Peckham also threw out Willson's suit against the commander of
the Concord Naval Weapons Station, saying the commander did not
cause the incident. But the judge ruled evidence that the train was
intended to scare demonstrators off the tracks may be enough to
show a violation of their constitutional rights.
   Trial is scheduled April 24 in a suit by Willson, his wife,
Holley Rauen, and three others against the government, the train
crewmen and two supervisors at the naval station east of San
Francisco.
   Willson lost his legs as a result of the incident.
   The crewmen's lawyer, William Kolin, did not return a telephone
call Wednesday.
   Willson and others opposing U.S. arms shipments to Central
America held a demonstration Sept. 1, 1987, at the Concord Naval
Weapons Station, where they said the weapons shipments were
originating. A train from the station hit him as he sat on the
tracks, severing both legs at the knee. Others on the tracks were
able to jump away, though one man had to leap onto the locomotive.
   The suit contends the Navy and individual supervisors were given
ample warning of the plan to stay on the tracks, and that the crew
had plenty of time to stop.
   The three civilian crewmen _ engineer David Humiston, conductor
Ralph Dawson and brakeman Robert Mayfield _ denied wrongdoing and
said in their countersuit that the demonstrators had acted,
deliberately or recklessly, to cause the crew emotional distress.
   Peckham ruled that the demonstrators did not violate the
crewmen's rights _ even if, as the crew argued, Willson and his
colleagues were prepared to risk being run over by the train to
advance their political views.
   ``The munitions train could have stopped short of the protesters
and the ensuing mutilation of Mr. Willson and emotional distress of
the crew members (would have been) avoided,'' Peckham said.
   He said a reasonable jury could not conclude that the
protesters' acts made it ``inevitable that the train would run them
over.''

   Manuel Antonio Noriega,
the former Panamanian strongman who defied two U.S. presidents
until he was toppled by a Dec. 20 invasion, reportedly arrived in
the United States Thursday morning to face drug charges.
   The ousted dictator surrendered to U.S. troops outside his
Vatican Embassy sanctuary Thursday night and was flown to Homestead
Air Force Base, about 25 miles south of Miami early Thursday.
   Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla., told WTVJ-TV in Miami that the plane

<HEAD>Jump in Wages Subject to Tax is Higher Than First Expected</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some employers are confused about how much
Social Security tax they are supposed to withhold this year because
of a late change made by Congress.
   The Social Security Administration announced in October that,
consistent with the law at that time, earnings up to $50,400 would
be subject to the payroll tax in 1990.
   In November, however, Congress increased the figure to $51,300
as part of a deficit-reduction bill.
   Steve Pyrek, a spokesman for the Internal Revenue Service, said
the annual tax guide sent to employers late last year said the
``wage base'' would be $50,400. A notice that the figure has been
increased to $51,300 will go out in a mailing later this month
listing tax law changes, he said.
   Earnings above the wage base are exempt from Social Security
taxes.
   ``There's been confusion because people are getting publications
... and various IRS documents that have what was correct
information that's now incorrect,'' Pyrek said.
   Social Security Administration spokesman Frank Battistelli said
his agency plans a special mailing this month to 400 business and
trade groups publicizing the change in the 1990 figure.
   The wage base has gone up every year since 1971, with the latest
increase affecting about 10.4 million workers and self-employed
individuals who have annual earnings over last year's maximum of
$48,000.

   Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., sent 16.6
million pieces of mail during a six-month period last at a cost of
$2.66 million, according to a recent report by the secretary of the
Senate.
   That was more than any other senator.
   However, an earlier report shows D'Amato sent only 3,000 pieces
in the six previous months.
   The flurry between April 1 and Sept. 30 came as questions were
raised about D'Amato's influence at the Department of Housing and
Urban Development, and as Congress was debating limits on
constituent mail.
   The House ethics committee has announced a preliminary
investigation of D'Amato's housing-related actions.
   Frank Coleman, a spokesman for D'Amato, said Wednesday that the
senator historically has done the majority of his constituent
mailing at the end of the legislative session.

   More than a million decorative Christmas light
sets that may be a shock or electrocution hazard are being recalled.
   The Consumer Product Safety Commission said Wednesday that the
miniature ``string-to-string'' Christmas lights, manufactured by
Taiwan-based Toyo Industrial, were sold nationwide in sets of 35,
50, 70 and 100 lights at several retail stores including Big Lot,
Eckerd, K mart, Odd Lot, Revco and Walmart.
   The lights are imprinted ``TOYO'' or ``TP-6'' on the end of the
female connector that has internal metal contacts that can be
pushed or pulled out when plugging or unplugging the light strings,
the commission said.
   ``Any exposed contact in the connector could present a shock or
electrocution hazard to consumers,'' the agency said in a written
statement. The commission warned consumers to unplug all Christmas
light sets from the wall before they are removed from trees or
other areas to prevent possible shock hazards.
   Consumers who want to return the lights should call Toyo at
800-545-8330 from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. PST.

<TEXT>
   President Bush, declaring a complete victory
in Panama now that Manuel Antonio Noriega has surrendered to face
U.S. drug charges, now confronts a legal and political thicket.
   Noriega, formerly associated with the CIA, might seek to use
classified government materials in his defense against
drug-trafficking charges in Florida.
   That seemed far from the president's mind as he hastened into
the White House press briefing room Wednesday night to declare
victory and tell reporters that the deposed Panamanian dictator was
finally in U.S. custody.
   Bush, admittedly frustrated over months of inability to remove
Noriega from Panama, called the surrender ``a significant
milestone'' showing the success of the U.S. military invasion that
put Noriega on the run and forced him into the sanctuary arms of
the Roman Catholic Church.
   Now looms Noriega's trial on drug-trafficking charges and the
possibility that his defense will seek to introduce classified
documents from his years of working with U.S. intelligence
officials.
   Such material could be particularly sensitive regarding the
period in 1976 when Bush was director of the CIA and Noriega was
cooperating with the agency as an informant. In addition, Bush was
vice president during the early 1980s while Noriega was still in
the good graces of the U.S. government.
   A defense bid to use classified material the administration may
want kept secret could mirror the strategy used by Oliver North and
others in the Iran-Contra affair. Some Iran-Contra charges were
dropped, but Justice Department officials have said they do not
expect any secrecy problems to scuttle the charges that Noriega
received $10 million for protecting drug-trafficking operations.
   Bush said last week he did not fear Noriega might disclose any
CIA information that could embarrass him or the government.
   ``I think that's history, and I think that ... the main thing is
that he should be tried and brought to justice. And we are pursuing
that course with no fear of that,'' the president said.
   Prosecutors anticipate that Noriega will claim that his alleged
drug activities were sanctioned by the U.S. government because he
was a CIA informant. But the government is expected to argue that
having been an informant does not make Noriega immune from
prosecution.
   Bush and his aides insist Noriega will get a fair trial.
   In fact, one of the conditions under which Noriega agreed to
surrender, White House officials said, was a fair trial that would
not lead to the death penalty, which is allowed for some drug
kingpins.
   Noriega's surrender came at the end of a day when Bush kept a
low profile, making few public appearances as rumors of a possible
surrender flew and tension mounted around the White House.
   It wasn't until he returned from playing racquetball at 6:30
p.m. EST that Bush learned his nemesis had agreed to leave the
Vatican's Panama City embassy and surrender, aides said. Word came
from Defense Secretary Dick Cheney at about 9 p.m. that Noriega was
in U.S. military custody.
   Bush drafted a statement and rushed to the briefing room to
deliver the news less than an hour later.
   It was a moment he has long wanted to savor.
   Bush inherited the Noriega problem from President Reagan, whose
administration turned against Noriega following years of nurturing
the U.S. relationship with him because of his value as an
intelligence source.
   Bush continued Reagan's economic sanctions against Panama and
urged the Panamanian people to rise up and throw him out.
   Yet when a group of Panamanian Defense Forces officers mounted a
coup attempt against Noriega in October, the United States did not
provide backup help that might have helped them succeed _ a lapse
for which Bush was widely criticized.
   Perhaps still smarting from that missed opportunity, he sent in
the military on Dec. 20, driving Noriega into hiding and eventually
to the Vatican Embassy in Panama City.
   The Bush penchant for secrecy came into play in negotiations to
get Noriega out of the Vatican sanctuary. His aides denied that a
team led by Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger to
Panama on Tuesday was involved in negotiations for Noriega's
release. Instead, they said the group was focusing on economic
relief for the invasion-ravaged nation.
   However, at day's end, Gen. Maxwell Thurman, commander of the
U.S. Southern Command, said in Panama City that the Eagleburger
team was instrumental in arranging Noriega's surrender.

<HEAD>Casino Backers Begin Six-City Promotional Tour</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MITCH WEISS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TOLEDO, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Backers of a proposal to allow casino
gambling in Ohio have begun a six-city promotional tour intended to
muster public support for the creation of special gambling resort
districts.
   The tour kicked off Wednesday in Lorain, where promoter Alan
Spitzer wants to build a $400 million casino, a pilot project he
says could create 3,500 to 4,000 jobs at the resort, and 5,000 to
6,000 spin-off jobs related to the complex in northeast Ohio.
   In Toledo Wednesday afternoon, the promoters said the proposed
resort districts could create thousands of new jobs and attract
tourists from all over the Midwest.
   ``There has been a tremendous amount of support across the
state,'' Spitzer said at a news conference in Toledo.
   Toledo Mayor John McHugh said Wednesday that while he opposes
gambling, some people have suggested that a casino complex could
revitalize the city's ailing riverfront district.
   ``I want to look at the proposal, how it's going to be set up,''
the mayor said. ``You always hear when you have gambling or a
casino that there's always crime and corruption and the Mafia.
Certainly, I don't want to see that in Toledo.''
   Spitzer, a prime backer of the Lorain proposal, said his group
known as LUV Ohio Committee _ LUV stands for Let Us Vote _ has
enough signatures on petitions to give voters the chance to vote on
the issue.
   The tour was geared toward cities that also would be allowed to
conduct local option votes on casinos if voters support the
referendum, which would amend a section of the state constitution
that prohibits casino gambling.
   Spitzer also planned stops in Cincinnati and Dayton today, and
Steubenville and Youngstown on Friday.
   The group plans to travel to Columbus next Tuesday to submit
petitions to the secretary of state, who will determine whether
there are enough valid signatures to allow a referendum on the
casino issue. The committee needs 306,661 signatures of registered
voters; Spitzer says it has more than 500,000.
   The amendment would establish a pilot casino project in Lorain
that would run for five years, said Anthony Giardini, a lawyer and
secretary of the committee.
   After three years, the Legislature could review the Lorain
project and authorize similar resort projects in seven areas of
Ohio.
   In a resort district, only one hotel would be allowed, and
developers would have to bid for the project, Giardini said. No
state or federal money could be used to help a developer build a
casino, and no tax abatments would be given.
   In addition, 10 percent of a casino's gross revenues would be
taxed. Of that, 2 percent would help rebuild inner-city
neighborhoods.

   Sixteen radio stations simultaneously broadcast
an anti-drug program, but some listeners were more concerned
afterward with football playoff tickets.
   Station officials said it's too soon to tell whether the
broadcast during the morning drive time Wednesday will do any good
in the city's drug war.
   At WERE, a news-talk show format station, dozens of callers
phoned in shortly after the three-hour program Wednesday to discuss
its message, said David Slutzky, executive producer at the station.
   ``We're not going to solve the whole (drug) problem with one
radio broadcast,'' Slutzky said. ``At the same time, it instills
awareness.''
   But at WWWE, which also has a news-talk show format, concern
focused on whether enough tickets would be sold in time to lift a
local television blackout of the Cleveland Browns football playoff
game against the Buffalo Bills Saturday.
   ``We actually got more calls about the Browns ticket sales,''
said Kevin Kenney, a reporter at the station.
   The Radio for a Drug Free Cleveland effort had 16 of the city's
19 major radio stations broadcasting from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. a
program produced earlier that featured interviews with law
enforcement officials, medical professionals, performers and
athletes on drug-related topics.
   Among those who taped their descriptions of their own past drug
problems were singers Larry Gatlin of the Gatlin Brothers and
Stevie Ray Vaughn.
   The show also featured an audio tape of a Cleveland drug bust,
and interviews with a jailed drug dealer and a woman who worked as
a prostitute to support her drug habit.
   The host of the show was John Walsh, who also is host of the
``America's Most Wanted'' television show.
   Police records for 1989 show 46 of the city's 152 homicides were
drug-related.

   Panamanian exiles in south Florida greeted the
surrender of Manuel Antonio Noriega to U.S. authorities with
jubilation.
   ``It's like a big relief off our shoulders to know that Noriega
will come to justice,'' said Beverly Oztolaza, president of the
Panamanian Club of Tampa Bay. ``I tell you, it's something that
we've all been praying for.''
   Panamanian natives also expressed hope late Wednesday that their
country's move toward a democracy will be helped by the former
dictator's decision to voluntarily leave his sanctuary at the
Vatican Embassy in Panama City to face federal drug trafficking
charges in Miami and Tampa.
   ``There's no word to say how happy I am,'' said Irma Endara,
whose husband Luis is a cousin of Panama's new president, Guillermo
Endara. ``It means that we're going to be free and there's going to
be democracy in Panama _ and we're going to have Panama back
again.''
   Aurelio Barria, a leader of the opposition to Noriega who was
preparing to end his exile in Miami and return home, said friends
in Panama City told him of of the effect Noriega's surrender had on
his country:
   ``My friends today told me `What a feeling!' to walk out, to
feel free, to speak out. That's what it's all about. This is
democracy. This is freedom. This is justice.''
   Julio Dominguez, 47, left his native Panama 18 years ago after
twice being arrested by agents of Noriega, who then served as head
of the country's military intelligence. Dominguez echoed his
compatriots' excitement.
   ``Everybody's happy to have the cancer removed from our
country,'' said Dominguez, whose brother Roberto was recently
renamed Panama's consul in Miami.
   There also was a note of victory in the words of Adela Giroldi,
widow of the leader of a failed Panamanian coup attempt against
Noriega last October. Her husband, Col. Moises Giroldi, was killed
_ reportedly by Noriega _ in the attempt.
   ``His death was not in vain,'' Mrs. Giroldi said, ``and the
effort that President Bush made with the invasion of Panama was
also not in vain.''

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Much of the Midwest, where temperatures warmed to above
freezing, was drenched in a cold rain early today, while the
northern Plains registered temperatures in the teens.
   Rain fell in Chattanooga, Cincinnati, Detroit, Chicago,
Indianapolis, Kansas City and Nashville. Des Moines had snow.
   Western sections of the nation were seasonably cold early today.
Reno, Nev., and Las Vegas had temperatures below freezing, and
temperatures were in the 30s and 40s along the Pacific Coast from
San Francisco to Seattle.
   Late Wednesday, snow fell in parts of eastern Colorado and
western Kansas, and rain fell in parts of Oklahoma, Kansas and
Missouri.
   Snowfall totals in Colorado late Wednesday included 5 inches at
Rye and Beulah.
   Thunderstorms produced large hail in north-central Oklahoma on
Wednesday night. Quarter-size hail was reported in Nash, and
dime-size hail fell south of Manchester.
   Also Wednesday, rain extended across much of Kansas, Missouri,
the lower Mississippi Valley, eastern Texas, Alabama, northwest
Florida and western Washington state. Snow fell over some of the
higher elevations in eastern Washington.
   Temperatures warmed into the 30s and lower 40s in the Great
Lakes region. The afternoon high of 39 degrees at Marquette, Mich.,
broke their previous record high for the date of 37 degrees
established in 1964 and tied in 1984.
   The nation's high on Wednesday was 84 degrees at Kingsville,
Texas.

<HEAD>Computer Chip Fails on Venus-Bound Magellan Spacecraft</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Magellan spacecraft, speeding toward
cloud-shrouded Venus on a $550 million mapping expedition, will
need frequent commands from Earth until NASA fixes a computer
problem.
   Despite the failure of a computer chip on the spaceship,
``there's no threat to the mission,'' said Edwin Sherry, a
technical assistant at the space agency's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   Until engineers locate the faulty chip, they must send Magellan
new commands every other day to make sure it is pointing in the
proper direction, Sherry said Wednesday.
   He said a similar computer chip failure happened before Magellan
was launched and that such a failure is expected about once
annually.
   ``You'd hope for zero faults like this,'' Sherry said. ``But
they're typical of working with state-of-the-art equipment. It's
remarkable we have so few.''
   Magellan was launched from space shuttle Atlantis on May 4. It
will go into a polar orbit around Venus on Aug. 10.
   About 18 days later, it will start using its radar to peer
through the planet's thick clouds, spending at least 243 days
making maps that will reveal the landscape of at least 70 percent
of the planet.
   Magellan was nearly 112 million miles from Earth and 107 million
miles from Venus on Wednesday. Since its launch, it has traveled a
curving path of 424 million miles, and still has 369 million miles
to go before reaching the second planet from the sun, Sherry said.
   The problem developed Sunday as the spacecraft got ready to take
a fix on two distant stars to make sure it was pointing the right
way. An error was detected in a tiny part of Magellan's computer
memory.
   The error prompted Magellan to shift to a backup computer and
point its solar panels toward the sun to increase the power supply.
   The failure was apparently the result of electrical corrosion at
a junction between two types of material on a single memory chip,
leaving the chip unable to remember anything, Sherry said.
   He said, however, engineers haven't yet ruled out the
possibility that the chip was damaged by an electrically charged
particle spewed out by the sun, which is near the peak of its
11-year cycle of activity.
   Magellan uses gyroscopes to sense when pressure from solar wind
makes the spacecraft drift slightly, or point in the wrong
direction. The gyroscopes normally issue automatic commands to
three spinning wheels, which correct the spacecraft's alignment.
   Magellan's main computer is programmed to take a fix on the two
stars each day to determine the spacecraft's actual alignment. If
this ``star calibration'' shows the gyroscopes failed to align
Magellan correctly, they again command the wheels to adjust the
craft's position.
   Magellan continued to operate on its backup computer. Once the
faulty chip is located _ scientists hope within a few days _ a new
computer program will be sent to the spacecraft so the main
computer can be used while the faulty chip is bypassed, Sherry said.
   Engineers working on the problem are at Jet Propulsion
Laboratory in Pasadena and Martin Marietta in Denver. The company
built Magellan and is responsible for its daily operations under
National Aeronautics and Space Administration supervision.

<HEAD>Dollar Up Sharply Against Yen</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar rose sharply against the yen despite
central bank intervention today, the first day of 1990 trading in
Tokyo, and the stock market's main index declined moderately from
its latest record high.
   The dollar closed at 145.20 yen, up 1.80 yen from its finish of
143.40 on Friday, the last trading day before Japan's New Year
holiday. The dollar had climbed 1.25 yen on Friday.
   It opened today at 145.55 yen and ranged between 144.90 yen and
145.72 yen.
   Mitsuhiko Kinugasa, a dealer at Daiwa Bank, said the central
bank sold about $500 million in the morning session, after selling
an equal amount in currency markets overseas on the previous two
days, to check the dollar's rise.
   Because of the Bank of Japan intervention, ``the dollar was not
as strong as it might have been,'' he said.
   Another dealer, speaking on condition of anonymity, estimated
the central bank's total dollar sales today at $600 million to $700
million.
   This was ``not as much as expected,'' he said, but added that
concentrated selling in the morning had the intended effect.
   The central bank does not comment on its money market activities.
   Masafumi Koyama, chief customer dealer at the Bank of Tokyo,
said New York dealers sold dollars on the Tokyo market in the
morning to ``square their positions,'' helping to push the dollar
down from its opening level.
   Koyama said, however, ``It's getting harder and harder to break
(below) the 145-yen line.''
   In a half-day session of trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange,
share prices fell on news of the dollar's strength. The 225-share
Nikkei Stock Average, the market's key index, closed at 32,712.88
points, down 202.99 points, or 0.52 percent.
   The market had wound up 1989 trading with four consecutive days
of record-high Nikkei closings.
   Masahiro Umemori of Nomura Securities' investment research
division said the market was discouraged by the dollar's rise.
   ``The Tokyo market went against the global current today,
falling despite rises on the major markets overseas,'' he said.
   A weak bond market contributed to the slide, Umemori said.
   Trading volume on the first section totaled 400 million shares.

<TEXT>
   Scores of Panamanian
exiles and others converged outside this base in a spontaneous
party early today with hopes of seeing fallen dictator Manuel
Antonio Noriega in custody.
   While dozens of reporters, photographers and camera operators
stood by waiting for Noriega to arrive from Panama City, the crowd
banged pots and pans, waved Panamanian flags and chanted ``Down
With Noriega'' and ``Pineapple Face.''
   A C-130 carrying Noriega landed at the base at 2:45 a.m., and he
was whisked away. None of the celebrants apparently saw him.
   Bernardo Matos, 27, was one of a group of people waving a
Panamanian flag outside the gates of the base, about 25 miles south
of Miami. He said he quickly made his way to Homestead once he
heard late Wednesday that Noriega had surrendered to U.S. officials
in Panama, ending a stay at the Vatican Embassy.
   ``I want to see Noriega in handcuffs,'' said Matos. ``That's the
way he treated the people of Panama.''
   U.S. Sen. Connie Mack also turned up to wait for Noriega's
arrival.
   The Florida Republican was an observer at Panama's general
elections last May 7. Those elections were later nullified by
Noriega.
   ``My heart really goes out to the Panamanian people,'' Mack
said. ``To have been there and to have seen the hope for a free and
fair election stolen from them was a tragedy. The Panamanians are
the real winners here.''
   Anti-Castro Cuban-Americans also turned up, one holding a sign
reading: ``Noriega today, Castro tomorrow?''
   Damaris Dominguez, 25, left her native Panama three years ago.
   ``It means freedom. I just want to see,'' she said. ``I want to
make sure (Noriega) gets a trial.''
   She said Panamanians had expected last month's U.S. invasion to
remove Noriega from power, but hadn't expected it to come so soon.
   ``We are celebrating,'' she said, adding the wait was no
inconvenience. ``We are having kind of a party, so we don't mind.''
   Vilma San Miguel, 40, who left Panama 1{ years ago to settle in
Miami, was holding a spoon and pan, chanting.
   ``This is like a symbol of the opposition,'' she said. ``I hope
(Noriega) hears me.''

<HEAD>Studies Show Cancer Treatment Can Cause Leukemia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chemotherapy drugs that were used to treat ovarian
cancer may have sharply increased the risk of leukemia, a study has
found.
   Researchers found that among women treated between 1960 and
1985, the risk of leukemia was 12 times higher in those who
received chemotherapy rather than surgery alone, according to the
study published in today's New England Journal of Medicine.
   Although the study did not measure the benefits of treatment,
chemotherapy drugs given during that time frequently failed to stop
ovarian cancer. But doctors say that newer drugs now in use against
this form of cancer are more effective, and their benefits probably
outweigh their risks.
   The research, directed by Dr. John M. Kaldor of the
International Agency for Research on Cancer in Lyon, France, was
based on 114 women with leukemia who were among 99,113 survivors of
ovarian cancer in seven European countries and Canada.
   Doctors have long known that the powerful medicines used to
attack cancer may also cause the disease. The latest research
demonstrates the magnitude of this risk.
   In a second study, the same researchers found that the risk of
leukemia is also substantially increased in people given
chemotherapy for Hodgkin's disease, another form of cancer. But
since Hodgkin's disease is often curable with drugs, the benefits
of treatment clearly outweigh the risks.
   In this work, the doctors reviewed 163 cases of leukemia among
29,552 Hodgkin's disease patients. They found that the risk of
leukemia was nine times higher among those who got chemotherapy
instead of radiation treatment.
   ``The risk in Hodgkin's disease is well worth it, because the
treatment does extend life. In ovarian cancer, it's not necessarily
worth it,'' commented Dr. Charles A. Coltman Jr. of the University
of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio.
   Several of the cancer drugs taken by the European women for
ovarian cancer are no longer used.
   ``Management of ovarian cancer is moving ahead very rapidly,''
said Coltman. ``Some of the more recent studies suggest an impact
on survival'' that outweighs the increased risk of leukemia.

<TEXT>
   Families of the victims of Pan Am Flight 103,
which was blown up over Scotland a year ago, have no right to sue
for millions of dollars in punitive damages, a judge has ruled.
   U.S. District Thomas C. Platt ruled Wednesday that the Warsaw
Convention governing international flights bars such claims
``whether or not willful misconduct exists.''
   More than 150 lawsuits, each seeking $5 million to $25 million
in compensatory damages and $5 million to $25 million in punitive
damages, have been filed in the crash.
   ``We're disappointed with the result, but this is not going to
be the last word on the matter,'' said Steven Pounian, a lawyer for
the victims.
   He said he would likely file an immediate appeal of the ruling
by Platt.
   Under the terms of the Warsaw Convention, compensatory damages
due survivors is generally limited to $75,000.
   In his ruling, Platt criticized the treaty's monetary limits,
saying the limit ``adds insult to injury.''
   James M. Shaughnessy, a lawyer for Pan American World Airways,
said Platt was ``eminently correct with his ruling and we are very
pleased with it.''
   Lawyers for the victims' families had argued that even if
punitive claims are generally barred, a provision of the treaty,
Article 24, provides that when ``willful misconduct exists, the
liability limits of the Warsaw Convention are inapplicable and thus
... punitive damage claims should be determined by referring to
local law,'' according to court papers.
   In his 16-page ruling, Platt agreed with Pan Am lawyers'
interpretation that ``Article 24 actually seems to be persuasive
evidence that the Warsaw Convention intended to bar punitive damage
claims.''
   The Pan Am flight originated in Frankfurt, West Germany, and
changed in London to a larger Boeing 747. The jetliner was en route
from London to New York when it exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland,
on Dec. 21, 1988, killing 259 passengers and crew members and 11
people on the ground.
   The lawsuits allege that Pan Am and its security service, Alert
Management Systems Inc., did not adequately protect Flight 103 and
its passengers from a terrorist bomb attack and were negligent in
not alerting passengers to telephone threats against the airline.
   Investigators in Europe have found evidence linking a radical
Palestinian faction to the bombing, government officials have said.
   According to news reports, investigators believe a bomb was
hidden in a bag checked on a flight that originated in Malta and
connected with the Pan Am jetliner in Frankfurt.
   The luggage was reportedly allowed on the plane even though it
was apparently not checked in by any passenger aboard the plane.

<HEAD>Dollar, Gold Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar fell against major foreign currencies
in moderate European trading today, pushed lower by central bank
intervention to stem the dollar's rise. Gold prices were slightly
lower.
   The West German central bank, the Bundesbank, and the Swiss
National Bank confirmed that they had sold dollars, buying up their
own currencies.
   London dealers said the Bank of England was selling dollars for
Japanese yen on behalf of the Bank of Japan. The Bank of England
refused to comment.
   The dollar soared in trading earlier in Asia and dealers said
the currency would have gone higher if the Japanese central bank
had not intervened.
   Despite the rally, European traders said the dollar's downward
trend would continue.
   ``There could be a slightly upward trend because U.S. interest
rates aren't falling any further, but there is certainly no trend
reversal,'' said a dealer at a major West German bank in Frankfurt.
   ``I would be surprised if the dollar had another upward push,''
said John Chapman, chief dealer at Standard Chartered Bank PLC in
London.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose 1.80 yen to a closing 145.20 yen.
Later, in London, it was quoted at a lower rate of 144.65 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Wednesday:
   _1.7165 West German marks, down from 1.7203
   _1.5660 Swiss francs, down from 1.5722
   _5.8605 French francs, down from 5.8745
   _1.9532 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9370
   _1,285.50 Italian lire, down from 1,286.00
   _1.1627 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1602
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.6170 to buy one pound, compared with $1.6080 late Wednesday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $395.60 a troy ounce,
unchanged from late Wednesday. At midmorning, the city's five major
bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $394.95.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $394.80, down from $395.25 bid late
Wednesday.
   Gold in Hong Kong fell $1.40 to close at a bid $394.89.
   Silver rose in London to a bid price of $5.19 a troy ounce, up
from Wednesday's $5.16.

<HEAD>Experimental Electric Car Goes 120 Miles on Charge, GM Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By E. SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. unveiled a prototype
electric car it says outpaces some gas-burning sports cars and runs
twice as far between charges than previous electric models.
   The two-seater Impact, which tapers at the rear like a Citroen,
can travel 120 miles at 55 mph before recharging and zooms from 0
to 60 mph in eight seconds, GM Chairman Roger Smith said at a news
conference Wednesday.
   ``The public perceives electric vehicles as golf carts,'' Smith
said. ``The Impact absolutely shatters that perception.''
   GM showed a film in which the Impact outpaced a Mazda Miata and
a Nissan 300 ZX on a level-ground acceleration test.
   John Zwerner, GM's executive director of advanced product
engineering, said the prototype has never been crash-tested or
passed other government tests and would go into production only if
extensive tests find a market for it.
   Boasting a top speed of 75 mph, the Impact can be charged
halfway in as little as half an hour and almost fully recharged in
six hours, GM said. Most electric vehicles need up to 12 hours for
a full recharging.
   Electric cars are virtually non-polluting and are under close
scrutiny in Los Angeles by environmental officials who are enacting
stringent air quality rules.
   He declined to reveal how much GM had spent developing the
vehicle or to estimate a price, although he said it would have to
be competitive in price with existing, internal combustion-powered
cars.
   A person driving a gas-powered car in Los Angeles 10,000 miles a
year might now spend about $30 a month on fuel and another $10 on
maintenance, Smith said.
   The Impact would use a maximum of $12 per month in electricity
under the same conditions, but would still cost about twice as much
to operate because the batteries must be replaced every 20,000
miles, adding another $70 a month to operating costs, Smith said.
   Zwerner said that within three years, improvements in batteries
may make it possible for the Impact to double its battery life to
40,000 miles, which would make operating costs nearly equal to
those of gas-powered cars.
   The 120-mile range is not expected to be improved much,
officials said.
   ``You've got to keep in mind that this is not a car for driving
to New York,'' he said. ``But as a second car, running around L.A.,
I think it's great.''
   Smith said GM might need to produce as many as 100,000 of the
vehicles a year for them to compete with cars powered by
internal-combustion engines.
   Each of the Big Three automakers has aggressive programs to
research cars powered by fuels other than gasoline, but Smith said
the Impact was far more advanced than any other electric car.

   A 12-year-old girl was raped and tortured by
three teen-age boys who dangled her from the roof of a building
during the four-hour assault, police said.
   The girl told detectives she went to visit a girlfriend in her
class Tuesday evening when her friend's brother and two other boys
dragged her into the apartment.
   Police arrested the brother, 16-year-old Masa McGrier, and were
seeking two other teen-agers. McGrier was charged with rape,
sodomy, assault, criminal possession of a weapon and menacing,
police said.
   ``They tied my arms, my legs, too,'' the girl told New York
Newsday. ``They got me down in the kitchen and started beating me.
   ``I told them to stop. ... One guy put a gun to my head. They
burnt a knife on the stove and started to cut my breasts.
   ``They took an ice pick and did like this,'' she said, stabbing
angrily at the bandage on her thigh. ``They raped me.''
   Then they dangled her from the roof of the five-story Manhattan
building, and demanded money, she said in today's editions of
Newsday.
   One of the teens accused the girl of having stolen $45 in cash
from the apartment during a prior visit, Manhattan Chief of
Detectives Ronald Fenrich said.
   The teen-agers took their victim to her grandmother's house and
the grandmother called police, Vreeland said. The girl was taken to
St. Luke's Hospital, where she was treated and released.

<HEAD>Amnesty Means Huge Personnel Losses for Industries</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Production is threatened in some
key industries because they are losing thousands of
prisoner-workers to President Vaclav Havel's broad amnesty,
officials say.
   State television said 35 enterprises have petitioned the Labor
and Social Affairs Ministry for help in filling about 5,000
vacancies caused by the amnesty.
   Thousands of inmates had been working in industries as part of
or in lieu of prison terms.
   Under the amnesty, announced Monday, about two-thirds of the
country's 31,000 prisoners will go free before Jan. 21.
   The Skoda auto factory in Mlada Boleslav, 50 miles northeast of
Prague, is down more than 1,500 workers _ or 15 percent of its
workforce _ because of the decree, the state news agency CTK
reported Wednesday.
   Frantisek Brodsky, spokesman for Skoda, said he expected
production to drop by about a third at the factory, one of
Czechoslovakia's main exporters.
   Brodsky said the jobs could be filled by bringing in foreign
workers from Poland, Vietnam or elsewhere, CTK reported.
   Havel, Czechoslovakia's first non-Communist President in 41
years, declared the amnesty and sentence reductions three days
after he was sworn in. The decree applies to all prisoners except
those charged with abuse of power, murder, terrorism and sex crimes.

<HEAD>Unprecedented Strike Shuts Down Major Port Complex in Mozambique</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government today rejected what it
called immoral demands by more than 4,000 railworkers who have shut
down the nation's largest port in the first major strike during 15
years of independence.
   The strike at the main railway and port complex in Maputo, the
capital, began Tuesday, when employees of Mozambique Railways
stopped work to demand a year-end bonus and payment of wage arrears
dating back to 1987.
   The national news agency, AIM, said 4,000 of the 6,500 railway
employees at the complex joined the strike Tuesday, and the entire
workforce there _ including dockworkers _ stopped work Wednesday
amid reports of coercion.
   AIM said some dockworkers began returning to their jobs today,
but the railway workers remained on strike.
   The Transport Ministry announced today that wage arrears would
be paid to three of seven categories of workers and promised full
implementation of wages scales approved in 1987. But the ministry
rejected demands for a bonus, saying a money-losing company like
the railroad could not afford such a step.
   ``In the extremely serious economic situation facing Mozambique
Railways, the demand for an end-of-year bonus has no rationale and
is immoral,'' a ministry statement said.
   The ministry noted that Mozambique's railways have been a prime
target of anti-government rebels during a 13-year-old insurgency.
   Major rail lines linking Maputo to Zimbabwe and South Africa
have been shut down frequently by sabotage during the war, causing
hundreds of millions of dollars in losses for the railway.
   The minium wage for industrial workers in Mozambique is 22,500
meticais a month, equivalent to only $27 because of recent
devaluations. No information was available as to the average wage
of the railway workers.
   AIM said the strike was the first of major significance since
Mozambique became independent of Portugal in 1975. The leftist
government, which last year dropped Marxism as its official
ideology, has allowed trade union activities but up until now has
not faced serious confrontations.
   The Transport Ministry accused strikers of trying to coerce
other workers at the port complex into joining the strike, saying
such actions were ``extremely incorrect and dangerous.''
   It said the strikers ``resorted to physical threats against
their colleagues and blocked the entrance to their workplace.''
   The ministry urged the railway management to take immediate
disciplinary steps against ``elements who contine to seriously
disturb the normal activity of the company.''

   Deposed Panamanian dictator Manuel Antonio Noriega
is the sixth of 16 defendants charged with drug trafficking in a
February 1988 federal indictment here to be brought to Florida to
face trial.
   Hours before Noriega was handed over to U.S. drug agents in
Panama Wednesday night, two of his fellow defendants had hearings
in Miami and a federal official said a third was being flown to
Homestead Air Force Base, where Noriega arrived early today.
   Noriega was scheduled to appear this afternoon at U.S. District
Court in Miami.
   Despite extraordinary security precautions planned by U.S.
Marshals, U.S. District Judge William M. Hoeveler said Noriega
would be treated like any other defendant.
   ``If General Noriega is apprehended and brought here for trial,
he would be given the same treatment as any other person accused of
a crime _ no more, no less. All his rights will be protected,''
Hoeveler said.
   Noriega is accused of accepting millions of dollars in bribes
from Colombia's Medellin cartel in exchange for allowing Panama to
be used as a conduit for cocaine shipments into the United States.
If convicted on all charges, Noriega faces up to 145 years in
prison and $1.1 million in fines.
   Five people accused of aiding Noriega in his alleged
drug-trafficking schemes have been arrested and brought to Florida
to face trial.
   Lt. Col. Luis del Cid, 46, accused of acting as a liaison and
money courier between drug traffickers and Noriega, pleaded
innocent, and is being held pending a Jan. 16 hearing. Del Cid, who
was arrested in Panama on Christmas Day, faces 70 years in prison
and $550,000 in fines if convicted on all counts.
   Daniel Miranda, 36, accused of flying $800,000 in drug profits
from Fort Lauderdale to Panama in 1983, was arrested Sunday in
Panama and was scheduled for a court hearing Friday. Miranda on
Tuesday challenged the legitimacy of his extradition by refusing to
answer charges against him. An innocent plea was entered for
Miranda by U.S. Magistrate Peter Palermo.
   Federal court officials in Miami who spoke on condition of
anonymity said this morning that another co-defendant, pilot
Eduardo Pardo, had been arrested in Panama City by U.S. Drug
Enforcement Administration agents. He was flown to South Florida
immediately afterward, separately from Noriega, and was being held
at an undisclosed location.
   He was to be arraigned this afternoon at the same time as
Noriega.
   Pardo allegedly flew the plane with Miranda, according to the
indictment. He faces five years in prison and $10,000 in fines if
convicted.
   Earlier Wednesday, two other co-defendants, William Saldarriaga,
45, and Brian Davidow, 28, asked for separate trials. Hoeveler said
he would rule on their requests later this month.
   Saldarriaga, a reputed Colombian drug trafficker, is being held
without bond. He faces 40 years in prison and $500,000 in fines if
convicted. Davidow, an alleged cocaine dealer in Miami, remains
free on bond.
   Both men have pleaded innocent, and neither attended Wednesday's
court session.
   Noriega's ten other co-defendants include five alleged members
of the Medellin cartel, two Panamanian pilots who allegedly flew
cocaine shipments, two Panamanian businessmen accused of arranging
flights of cocaine into the United States, and another Panamanian
who allegedly arranged for the protection of cocaine shipments
through Panama. All are still at large.

<TEXT>
   The government today officially
legalized public rallies following the creation of an executive
committee that will have final say on how the country is run until
free elections promised for April.
   Rompres, the official news agency, reported that interim
President Ion Iliescu had signed a decree that says ``public
gatherings ... are means of exercising freedom of opinion and
speech, of organizing the citizens' participation in the country's
public life.''
   Organizers of rallies and demonstrations will ``be obliged to
take all the necessary measures so that they should proceed
peacefully and they also must notify police 48 hours in advance,''
Rompres said.
   Under ousted dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, demonstrations were
banned unless they were staged in support of his leadership.
   Ceausescu and his wife, Elena, the country's second-in-command,
were toppled in a popular revolution and tried and executed
Christmas Day on charges of genocide and other grave crimes during
24 years of despotic rule.
   Families whose homes were destroyed in fierce fighting in
Bucharest during the revolution will move into spacious apartments
Ceausescu built for his security forces in the city, media said
today.
   The 110 apartments were intended for security police who were to
work in the Palace of the Republic, one of Ceausescu's pet projects
that was not completed, and have been vacant for four years.
Thousands of old homes and landmarks were razed to make way for the
palace.
   On Wednesday, the military chief of staff denied foreign news
reports that the revolution was planned several months in advance,
but he acknowledged that tensions had been rising.
   ``The revolution was spontaneous, but the discontent had been
piling up for years,'' Col. Gen. Vasile Ionel told reporters.
   ``Civilians and the military alike had felt the hardships. The
army was dissatisfied by the way it was treated as a labor force on
huge projects without any use for Romania,'' he said.
   He said at least 196 officers and non-commissioned officers were
killed during the uprising in fierce street fighting with Ceausescu
loyalists. He did not give a figure for enlisted men or civilians
who also took up arms.
   Army troops joined pro-democracy demonstrators in ousting
Ceausescu on Dec. 22, battling the despot's dreaded Securitate
security police in the capital and other cities.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze will visit
Bucharest on Saturday, Soviet Embassy sources said. It will be the
first visit by a top Kremlin official to the new leadership.
   Rompres said Wednesday the National Salvation Front, which has
been running the country since Ceausescu's ouster and promises to
usher in democracy, had created an 11-member executive committee
that has ultimate governing authority. It said President Iliescu
would serve as chairman and that Dumitru Mazilu, a leading critic
of Ceausescu, was named first deputy.
   Mazilu blasted the old regime in a report smuggled out of
Romania this fall and delivered to the United Nations' Human Rights
Commission in Geneva, where he had worked until being placed under
house arrest by Ceausescu in 1987.
   Romania also has a Cabinet, led by Premier Petre Roman. But the
Salvation Front has legislative powers and chose the premier. Roman
was excluded from the executive committee, as announced by Rompres.
   Rompres said a new justice minister, Teofil Pop, and supreme
court president, Teodor Vasiliu, were named on Wednesday. It did
not provide any details of their backgrounds.
   The news agency said initial estimates of those killed in the
first days of the revolution were exaggerated. It said ``rigorous
inquiries are being made to establish the exact number of the dead
and wounded.''
   Initial reports put the death toll as high as 70,000, but later
reports have varied widely and Western diplomats say the actual
figure could be about 10,000.
   Ionel, the army chief of staff, said ``there is a high number of
dead all over the country ... Just how many died in the revolution
will be found out later on.''
   He said: ``Many who belonged to the security units have been
arrested. They are all being interrogated and will be punished
according to their deeds.''
   He reiterated that the army had refused orders to fire on
protesters in the western city of Timisoara, where the revolution
began when security forces massacred anti-government protesters on
Dec. 17.
   ``But some elements of the security troops had infiltrated into
the army and fired upon the people. The dead there are not victims
of bullets fired by soldiers of the Romanian army,'' Ionel said.
   At least six political parties have been formed to compete in
the April elections.
   A spokesman for one of them, Nicolae Costel of the Romanian
Democratic Party, said Wednesday that he believed the elections
should be delayed.
   The Christian Democratic National Peasants' Party also has urged
postponement, contending that early elections will give candidates
of the interim government an unfair advantage.

<HEAD>Blood Shortages Reported in Some Parts of Nation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TED DUNCOMBE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American Red Cross has issued emergency
appeals for blood donations in several parts of the nation, but
other regions have enough to ensure an adequate supply in case of
disaster.
   Critical shortages were reported in parts of Arizona, Florida,
Georgia, Michigan, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Virginia, while
most of the nation was simply experiencing a normal post-holiday
tightening of supplies.
   But the blood supply was at its strongest level in 11 years in
Los Angeles and Orange counties in California, Red Cross
spokeswoman Cheryle Babbit said.
   The Penn-Jersey Region of American Red Cross Blood Services said
its shortage was threatening patient care at hospitals in
southeastern Pennsylvania and southern New Jersey.
   The region, which provides 94 percent of the blood used in 93
hospitals, needs about 1,750 donors a day and was down to about
1,000 donors daily.
   ``Supplies are so low that over New Year's weekend we curtailed
distribution of red cells and platelets sharply and worked with
physicians and hospitals on a case-by-case basis,'' regional
director Dr. William C. Sherwood said.
   A heart bypass operation was postponed for two hours Tuesday at
Albert Einstein Medical Center in Philadelphia because of the
shortage, said Dr. Ierachmiel Daskal, chairman of the hospital's
Department of Pathology.
   ``If you have a limited amount of product, you must use it the
best way you can,'' Daskal said. ``We have not had to cancel
surgery yet, but we have had to postpone and reshuffle the
schedule.''
   The Red Cross collects about 6.2 million units of blood per
year, or more than half the nation's blood supply. A unit is 450
milliliters, or slightly less than a pint.
   Blood and blood products are used to replace blood lost by
patients, to stop bleeding by forming blood clots, to fight severe
infection and to increase the oxygen-carrying ability of the blood
during surgery.
   Severe cold weather and flu outbreaks combined with the usual
drop in donations at holiday time to create the scattered
shortages, Red Cross officials said.
   ``I'm not having any indication that we're having a general
shortage across the country,'' said Pat Davis, a national Red Cross
spokeswoman in Washington. If a major emergency occurred, blood
supplies from around the country could be released to areas in
need, she said.
   In Atlanta, daily donations had dropped to half the 900 units
collected normally and an emergency appeal was issued for type O
blood. ``We need 800 donors over the next few days to get supplies
back to a safe level,'' said Ann Wilcox, spokeswoman for the Red
Cross blood bank serving more than 100 hospitals in 82 Georgia
counties.
   Similar emergency appeals were under way in the south Florida,
Great Lakes, southern Arizona and Tidewater, Va., blood regions,
Ms. Davis said.
   Blood supplies generally tighten every year during the holiday
season and during the summer because donors are busy with other
activities. In Arizona, a flu outbreak contributed to the drop in
donations, while two severe ice storms kept donors home in
Virginia, Red Cross officials said.
   ``Our shelves are bare,'' said Red Cross spokeswoman Chris
Chidley in Miami, where the organization usually has at least a
three-day supply of blood, about 1,500 pints. Tuesday's inventory
was down to 300 pints for 66 hospitals from Key West to Palm Beach.
   Janet Connor, administrator for the Central Illinois Community
Blood Bank in Springfield, Ill., said the seasonal shortage there
was being met by aggressive phone calls to potential donors. ``We
don't end our day unless we get enough,'' she said.
   Mary Joe Smith, manager of the Parkland Blood Donor Center in
Dallas, said an increased number of accidents over the holiday
season helped create a shortage there. It wasn't critical enough to
curtail elective surgery, but a liver transplant was delayed by a
short supply of one blood type.

<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Exultant Panamanians danced in the
streets and embraced American soldiers when they heard that Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega, who intimidated them for years, had left
the Vatican Embassy and surrendered to U.S. troops.
   ``The people feel a sense of peace knowing that the monster is
leaving our land,'' said President Guillermo Endara, who was a
frequent target of Noriega's thugs.
   The ousted strongman decided to give up Wednesday night after
realizing that he was cornered _ that even his long-time supporters
had turned against him, the archbishop of Panama, Marcos McGrath,
said today.
   ``Once the Vatican had made it quite clear that he was not a
diplomatic nor political refugee _ but rather a refugee with
criminal charges against him _ it was quite clear he could not go
to a third country. Therefore, his choice was simply Panama or the
States,'' McGrath told ABC's ``Good Morning America.''
   After hundreds of angry Panamanians staged an anti-Noriega
protest outside the Vatican Embassy on Wednesday afternoon, Noriega
``began to realize how much feeling there is against him in Panama
_ that it's much safer going to the States,'' McGrath said.
   Jubilation gripped the capital of 1 million residents seconds
after radio and television announced that Noriega, who ruled Panama
six years with no popular mandate, had given up after evading
American troops sent in to capture him Dec. 20.
   ``It's over! It's over!'' people shouted as, leaning out of
their cars and blaring their horns. Some people screamed themselves
hoarse.
   People ran up to the U.S. military roadblocks and hugged and
kissed U.S. soldiers. They banged pots and pans, and fireworks
exploded in the sky around the Vatican mission.
   Youngsters raced around waving Panamanian and U.S. flags.
   ``Thank God, Panama can now feel like a free country,'' said
Moises Rios, 20, one of hundreds outside the Vatican Embassy
minutes after Noriega left.
   A Vatican Embassy spokesman said Noriega left ``of his own
will'' in his general's uniform shortly before 9 p.m. Wednesday.
   As soon as he walked out, he was arrested by U.S. soldiers who
had surrounded the building since he sought refuge there Christmas
Eve.
   Noriega was whisked by helicopter to Howard Air Base west of the
capital and flown by military transport to Florida, where he faces
drug trafficking charges.
   The surrender took place just hours after about 20,000 people
shouting ``No More!'' and ``Assassin!'' marched to the Vatican
Embassy to demand Noriega's surrender.
   Noriega was said to have been under ``strict isolation'' at the
mission on orders of the papal nuncio, or ambassador.
   McGrath said he saw little of Noriega in the embassy, but ``from
what I hear while he was there, he kept pretty much to himself and
was downcast and a bit moody.''
   The television in the room Noriega used was broken, but Noriega
must have heard the protesters and knew from radio reports
broadcast by U.S. loudspeakers that his supporters had abandoned
him.
   Less than an hour after Noriega surrendered, President Bush
announced victory in Washington: ``His apprehension and return to
the United States should send a clear signal that the United States
is serious in its determination that those charged with promoting
the distribution of drugs cannot escape the scrutiny of justice.''
   Bush also paid tribute to servicemen who were killed and wounded
in the invasion, saying ``Their sacrifice has been a noble cause.''
   By official count, 23 American soldiers and three American
civilians were killed in the fighting. More than 300 American
troops were wounded. At least 290 Panamanian soldiers and about 300
civilians were killed.
   Gen. Maxwell Thurman of the U.S. Southern Command said American
forces had only a few minutes' notice before Noriega surrendered.
   Noriega's surrender ended days of bargaining. In the end he got
three concessions: to be allowed to make a few phone calls and wear
his uniform, and that his decision to give himself up be kept
secret until his arrest.
   Sources in Washington also said Vatican officials relayed to
Noriega assurances he wouldn't be tried on a federal drug kingpin
statute that carries the death penalty.
   The surrender came after a visit by Deputy Secretary of State
Lawrence Eagleburger and Vatican diplomat Monsignor Giacinto
Berloco, and Thurman thanked Eagleburger for his efforts.
   Administration sources said the United States did not deal
directly with Noriega at any time and that all negotiations were
through church officials.
   The Vatican Embassy said in a statement after Noriega's
departure that he ``considered the situation serious and took the
responsible decision to leave of his own will the residence of the
pope's representative.''
   Noriega made no public statements during his stay in the Vatican
compound.
   Thurman said Noriega didn't say anything when he was spirited
out but added that the former strongman ``looked vigorous, looked
confident. He looked fine.''
   Vice President Guillermo Ford, familiar to U.S. television
viewers as the bloody-shirted victim of a beating by Noriega
loyalists in May, said Noriega would be returned to Panama for
trial on a long list of charges after his trial in the United
States.
   ``No revenge. Due process,'' he said on ABC's ``Nightline.''
   Officials of Panama's new government have said they plan to
charge Noriega with murder in the deaths of officers who led a
failed Oct. 3 coup and were allegedly slain after their capture.

   The Vatican declared today that Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega voluntarily left its embassy in Panama and was
given no special guarantees before turning himself over to U.S.
authorities.
   In giving the Vatican's first official comment on Noriega's
leaving the embassy, spokesman Joaquin Navarro insisted that the
Holy See did not give in to U.S. demands that church officials hand
over the deposed dictator.
   ``It did not consist of a handover but a free decision'' by
Noriega to leave the embassy, where he sought refuge on Dec. 24,
four days after U.S. troops invaded Panama, Navarro told reporters
at an early-afternoon briefing.
   Navarro said he did not know what prompted Noriega's decision to
surrender Wednesday night to U.S. forces who had been surrounding
the Vatican mission. Noriega was flown to Florida, where he faces
federal drug-trafficking charges.
   Noriega gave the papal nuncio, or representative, a letter for
Pope John Paul II, Navarro said, adding he did not know its
contents. He said the nuncio, Monsignor Jose Sebastian Laboa,
accompanied Noriega out of the embassy into a Catholic school
across the street where the general was seized by U.S. troops.
   In Panama City, Marcos McGrath, the archbishop of Panama, said
today that Noriega gave up after realizing that he was cornered _
that even his long-time supporters had turned against him.
   ``Once the Vatican had made it quite clear that he was not a
diplomatic nor political refugee _ but rather a refugee with
criminal charges against him _ it was quite clear he could not go
to a third country. Therefore, his choice was simply Panama or the
States,'' McGrath told ABC's ``Good Morning America.''
   Navarro said of Noriega's surrender: ``International law has
been respected. This is a solution that was taken voluntarily by
Noriega himself.''
   Throughout the negotiations between U.S. and Vatican officials
to try to end the stalemate, the Holy See had stressed that its
nunciature, like any other accredited embassy, was empowered to
deal directly only with the host country and thus it would have
been impossible, under international law, to hand over Noriega
directly to U.S. authorities.
   Navarro said that while Noriega's surrender to U.S. authorities
might appear as if the Vatican had given in to U.S. demands, from
the ``point of view of international law'' the situation was
``completely different.''
   He said the Vatican had provided Noriega with no guarantees but
that the nuncio had explained how the U.S. justice system works,
with its provisions for fair trials.
   Asked if the United States got want it wanted, Navarro replied:
``If this is all viewed like a game of soccer, it's ridiculous. I
said from the beginning of the negotiations that this is not a
matter of who wins, who loses.''
   Navarro said he did not know exactly what element prompted
Noriega to leave his refuge at the nunciature but that the general
probably had ``reflected'' on such issues as the future of Panama
and his responsibilities to the nation.
   While officials of the Roman Catholic Church and the U.S.
administration debated Noriega's fate, he was described as being
kept isolated in a small room with a broken television, unable to
receive visitors or phone calls.
   Navarro, the pope's chief spokesman, said he had not spoken to
the pontiff about the resolution of the case but added, ``I suspose
the Holy Father has been pleased'' with the outcome.
   He said that before leaving the nunciature, Noriega asked for a
memento of his stay but didn't know what the souvenir was.
   Four colleagues of Noriega remained in the Vatican embassy,
Navarro said: a captain, a colonel, the former Panamanian director
of immigration and the wife of one of them. Navarro said he did not
immediately have their identification.
   Negotiations were expected to continue over their fate.
   Throughout the negotiations, the Vatican stressed that Noriega
was being sheltered but that no granting of political asylum had
been made.
   It also stressed that the papal nuncio agreed to let Noreiga
into the mission only after he pledged to use his influence to get
his supporters to quit resisting the United States forces, and the
Vatican portrayed the whole affair as a means to stop bloodshed.
   Before Noriega showed up at the embassy, the pope had decried
the loss of life caused by the U.S. invasion of the strategic
Central American nation.

<TEXT>
   Tough-talking and heavy-handed while
in power, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega spent his last days in Panama
as a refugee in the Vatican Embassy, mostly keeping to himself in a
state of nervous isolation.
   While little information has been released on his 10-day stay,
details gleaned through telephone calls to the papal mission
indicate the toppled ruler found himself with little to do.
   In the end, Vatican Embassy workers shunned Noriega, who was
confined largely to a simple room with a crucifix and a broken
television set.
   Outside, people howled for his expulsion from the Vatican
mission and trial in Panama or in the United States.
   The Defense Forces that had kept him in power for six years were
crushed quickly by invading U.S. troops on Dec. 20 and reduced to a
handful of holdouts who surrendered or were captured.
   Noriega sought refuge at the Vatican Embassy on Christmas Eve.
Officials there urged him to leave and although it was said they
would not throw him out, it was no secret he was hardly welcome.
   Panama's top churchman, Archbishop Marcos McGrath, said publicly
that Noriega would stand a better chance of a fair trial and decent
treatment in the United States than in Panama.
   Panama said it had no jail to hold him and third countries that
might have been acceptable destinations to people calling the shots
weren't interested in granting the ousted strongman asylum.
   The man who was cheered by thousands weeks earlier was wanted
only by the United States, and there only for his hide.
   ``He saw himself as something of an emperor in this part of the
world, and I think that dream has been shattered,'' McGrath said on
ABC's ``Nightline'' Wednesday night.
   His detractors, who called him ``pineapple face'' because of his
acne-scarred countenance, hung pineapples over the streets and used
sticks to smash them to yellow sticky pulp.
   Thousands of people wore ``Noriega-buster'' T-shirts depicting
pineapples with a red circle and slash.
   How much of this Noriega knew is uncertain, but radio reports of
his bank accounts being frozen, his military support wilting and
his cronies being captured were blared over loudspeakers by
American troops around the Vatican Embassy.
   Hours before he gave up, tens of thousands of Panamanians
gathered near the compound demanding he leave.
   No doubt much of this came as a shock to the stocky,
up-from-the-slums city kid whose early military career, by most
accounts, was brilliant and promising.
   ``He was cornered,'' McGrath said today of Noriega's decision to
give up. ``He had come to the Vatican Embassy ... looking for
refuge because he was cornered physically, militarily ... and as
the days went by it became more obvious he would not be able to get
to a third country,'' the archbishop told NBC's ``Today'' show.
   The protest outside the embassy Wednesday night further
convinced Noriega there was no way out, McGrath said.
   ``I have often wondered if he really knew what people thought
about him,'' Luis Martinz, an aide to President Guillermo Endara,
said earlier this week.
   ``I have known him for a long time and I have to admit that at
one time I liked him. He was sort of shy and self-effacing. He knew
I was in the opposition but he never tried to change my mind.
   ``But he wasn't like that at all in the more recent years.''
   Martinz was jailed by Noriega for two months earlier this year
for his activities with the opposition.
   As the heir to Omar Torrijos, the strongman who signed the 1977
treaties by which the United States cedes control of the Panama
Canal, Noriega did have support among the poor and the black and
Chinese minorities.
   Even when the United States attacked in overwhelming force,
there were Panamanians willing to die for Noriega.
   But in the end there was no massive pool of support or faith of
the kind that allowed Hungarian Cardinal Josef Mindszenty to
survive 15 years in the U.S. Embassy in Budapest.
   The only time Noriega is known to have socialized at the Vatican
Embassy was on New Year's Eve, when the papal envoy, Sebastian
Laboa, served a pasta dinner for all those at the mission.
   Noriega reportedly spoke little except to recall that his cook
also made excellent pasta.

<HEAD>East German Opposition Groups Form Coalition for May Elections</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six pro-democracy groups banded together
today to challenge the Communist Party in national elections set
for May, creating a force likely to pose a serious threat to the
once omnipotent Communists.
   Steffen Reiche, a leader of the Social Democratic Party of East
Germany, announced that his group was entering a coalition with New
Forum, the largest of the pro-democracy forces with 200,000 members
nationwide, as well as with Democracy Now, Democratic Awakening,
the Initiative for Peace and Human Rights, and the United Left.
   The coalition is calling itself Election Alliance 90, Reiche
said.
   He accused the Communists of trying to stir up public fears of a
resurgence of ultra-rightist activity and use it against opposition
groups.
   Communist Party leaders marched Wednesday night in the
southeastern neighborhood of Treptow to protest vandalism committed
by neo-Nazis over the past two weeks.
   The official ADN news agency said the march drew 250,000 people,
but witnesses said that figure was inflated.
   ``This country was born from anti-fascists,'' Communist Party
leader Gregor Gysi told the gathering at the site where rightist
vandals last week defaced a Soviet war memorial. ``Don't let it
become the homeland for neo-fascists.''
   Gysi said the rightists cannot be allowed to ``ruin the chances
for a democratic socialism in East Germany.''
   Leaders of the opposition groups fear the Communists are using
the neo-Nazi issue as a springboard to gain support for the May
elections, while at the same time discouraging calls in East
Germany for reunification of the two German states.
   Despite losing their constitutional mandate to rule during the
fall pro-democracy movement, the Communists remain the strongest
single political force in the country, according to recent public
opinion surveys.
   But the new coalition pools the resources and voter support of
the largest reform groups into a force likely to pose a serious
challenge to the Communists.
   The May 6 elections will be the first free, secret and
competitive balloting in East Germany's 40-year history. They will
choose a new 500-member Parliament, which will then select a new
Cabinet.
   Communist Premier Hans Modrow is viewed as an interim government
leader by the opposition forces, who have pressed him to take the
views of the rival political factions into consideration during
weekly talks.
   Opposition leaders contend Modrow's Cabinet has limited powers
to govern because it was named by a Parliament under the control of
unelected Communist Party figures.
   Modrow enjoys relatively broad support as a transitional figure,
but there have been increasing opposition complaints that control
of the government apparatus gives the Communists an unfair
advantage in elections.

<HEAD>Three Reported Killed in Fighting Between Shiite Militias</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rival Shiite Moslem militias armed with
artillery and machine guns clashed in south Lebanon today despite
the intervention of a Palestinian guerrilla peacekeeping force.
Three people were reported killed.
   In Beirut, Gen. Michel Aoun, the Christian leader, was entangled
in a growing financial scandal caused by foreign news reports that
he had $15 million stashed away in French banks.
   The Iranian-backed fundamentalist Hezbollah, of Party of God,
and the secular, Syrian-backed Amal militia have been battling for
13 days in the latest campaign of their 2-year-old war for control
of Lebanon's 1.2 million Shiites, the country's largest sect.
   Including today's toll of three killed and 11 wounded, police
say 73 people have been killed and 263 wounded since fighting broke
out Dec. 23.
   Police said 300 guerrillas from the Fatah movement headed by
Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat deployed
Wednesday across the strategic Hamade hill that Hezbollah captured
Tuesday after a fierce battle.
   Hezbollah needs to hold the hill to protect the supply lines to
its southern bases from the Bekaa Valley in east Lebanon, a Shiite
stronghold where an estimated 2,000 Iranian Revolutionary Guards
are based.
   Zeid Wehbi, Fatah's political chief in the southern port city of
Sidon, said the Palestinian deployment was aimed at ending the
fighting. He said the guerrillas also sought to keep the fighting
away from the Palestinian refugee camps of Ein el-Hilweh and Mieh
Mmieh, a few miles to the north.
   Palestinian sources said Arafat fears that Hezbollah, which has
gained the upper hand and captured five villages, would provide
support for dissident PLO factions in the camps.
   Amal chief Nabih Berri appealed again today to Iran to stop
sending military supplies to Hezbollah, saying Syria had
discontinued the supply of arms and ammunititons to Amal after
fighting erupted in the southern province.
   In Moslem west Beirut, newspapers gave prominent coverage to
reports that Aoun has bank accounts in Paris.
   On Wednesday, the satirical Paris weekly Le Canard Enchaine
published a bank statement showing two accounts in Aoun's name at
the Banque Nationale de Paris, one with a balance of $500,00, the
other with $14.7 million.
   Moslem-controlled radio stations said the reports have created a
corruption scandal that could seriously damage Aoun's standing in
the Christian community.
   The reports came amid efforts by the Syrian-backed government to
force Aoun to end his defiance of President Elias Hrawi, who
dismissed Aoun as army commander and interim prime minister in
November. Aoun refuses to stand down, or accept a peace treaty
approved by the Lebanese parliament.
   Aoun acknowledged having millions of dollars in foreign bank
accounts.
   ``It's not a secret for anyone. It's an open secret,'' Aoun said
in an interview Wednesady on France's state-run radio station
France-Inter. He said he had accounts in other French banks, as
well as in the United States and Lebanon. The general said the
funds in the accounts came from donations and were not for his
private use.
   ``If necessary, I can withdraw the money needed to resolve
financial crises,'' he said. ``For the last year and three months,
I have received no money from the central bank as concerns the
army.''

<HEAD>Policy Chief Sees Progress in Drug War</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's drug policy coordinator,
William Bennett, said today that the surrender of Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega to U.S. authorities in Panama proves that the war
against drugs is ``moving toward dawn.''
   However, he said, ``We still have a long way to go,'' in
fighting the scourge.
   ``The message is getting through,'' Bennett told The Associated
Press in a telephone interview. ``The message is that the price of
doing drug business is going up. The night of the drug lord is past
midnight. We're starting to move toward dawn.''
   Drug dealers should learn that, ``If you want to share in his
trade, you may share his fate,'' Bennett said of Noriega, who was
to Florida overnight to face federal drug-trafficking charges.
   Bennett expresed optimism that the charges can be prosecuted
successfully.
   ``The largest part of justice has been done,'' he said. ``A
tyrant has lost power. A tyrant has lost lucre. He's a man without
a country. Now he goes to trial.''
   Bennett also took a poke at critics of Bush's decision to send
in a military invasion force of more than 11,000 to drive Noriega
from power. The people of Panama, he said, ``understand, unlike
some critics here in the United States ... that the United States
was a liberating force.''

   Rescue teams resumed their search today
for 11 Americans and three Mexicans missing since their yacht sank,
but officials held out little hope of finding them in the cold Gulf
of California waters.
   ``Unfortunately, we are not expecting very much,'' said Port
Capt. Joaquin Dorantes. ``A lot of time has gone by and the water
is cold.''
   The chartered yacht sank New Year's Day, and the captain said
few people could survive for more than 40 hours in water as cold as
61 degrees.
   The boat was carrying 16 people, 12 American scuba divers and
four Mexican crew members. Two people were rescued. The U.S. Coast
Guard said a 17th person, an American crew man, also may have been
aboard, but it provided no details.
   No bodies from the Santa Barbara, a 68-foot refitted shrimp
boat, had been found by nightfall Wednesday. Eight of the missing
Americans were from Arizona and three from California, according to
a spokesman for Silent Experience Scubacenter, a Tucson, Ariz.
company that helped arrange the charter.
   The two survivors _ Opha Watson, 62, of Tucson, and Mexican
crewman Vicente Gonzalez Mancilla, were picked up separately
Tuesday afternoon and brought to San Carlos, the Mexican Navy and
the U.S. Coast Guard said.
   Watson said that shortly after the yacht sank, probably after
being struck by a large wave, four people clung to a door of the
boat, then disappeared.
   He told The Arizona Daily Star that two of those four people
wore flotation devices and that rescue workers may find them.
``They should be in the same drift pattern that I was in,'' which
would carry them toward Guaymas, he said.
   All four disappeared in the night, apparently losing their grip
on the door, before Watson was rescued around 5 p.m. Tuesday, 38
hours after boat sank. Watson identified them only as Nora, Jenny,
Joe, and Jerry.
   Guaymas is 270 miles south of Tucson and 875 miles northwest of
Mexico City. The boat sank about 40 miles west of Guaymas.
   ``Judging from what the captain said, we hit heavy seas,''
Watson said. ``Then, she keeled over,'' Watson said.
   He managed to put on a wet suit after he found his dive bag
floating.
   He told Coast Guard officials he thought about seven people went
down with the boat. He said he saw small groups of people clinging
to debris.
   The Santa Barbara was being sold by Guaymas businessman Amado
Navarro to Lane and Wanda Larson of Silent Experience Scubacenter,
The Arizona Daily Star said. A woman who identified herself as
Wanda Larson's mother said the yacht had been ``fully inspected
less than a month ago.''
   Dorantes said eight Mexican navy boats and two private planes
searched a 40-mile strip between San Carlos, on the coast northwest
of Guaymas, and Isla Tortugas, where the group had been diving on
Sunday. They had sailed from the island about two hours before the
boat sank.
   The Coast Guard sent two planes from California to help with the
search.

   The international community today generally
welcomed the decision by Gen. Manuel Noriega to accept U.S. justice
and expressed hope that it would lead to peace in Panama.
   In scattered initial reaction, countries across the globe also
expressed relief that the standoff over Noriega had ended.
   That was not the case in the Soviet Union, however.
   Gennady I. Gerasimov, spokesman for the Soviet Foreign Ministry,
questioned whether the United States has the right to put Noriega
on trial and said that even a conviction on drug trafficking
charges would not justify the U.S. invasion of Panama. ``No state
has the right to take the law into its own hands,'' he told
reporters in Moscow. ``That's basically lynch law.''
   News that Noriega had left his sanctuary in the Vatican embassy
in Panama City and surrendered to U.S. troops led radio and
television news bulletins and captured headlines of late newspaper
editions in Europe. He was flown to Miami to face federal drug
charges.
   Bahrain's Information Minister Tariq al-Moayyed said ``that is
the best possible end'' to the situation in Panama.
   The British Foreign Office said: ``We are glad that this problem
between the U.S. and the Vatican has been resolved,''
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was one of the only world
leaders to give full backing to President Bush when the United
States invaded Panama on Dec. 20.
   ``Noriega faces criminal charges and we are naturally pleased
that he should be brought to justice,'' said a Foreign Office
spokesman, who spoke anonymously in accordance with British
practice.
   Foreign Minister Francisco Fernandez Ordonez of Spain told
Spanish National Radio: ``Noriega accepted the only option he had
left since his remaining in the Vatican mission was not in the
least easy while surrounded by U.S. military troops and under
growing pressure by demonstrators outside.
   ``This appears to be a voluntary decision by Noriega and that's
how I suppose the Vatican will underscore it,'' he said.
   Spain was the sole member of the 12-nation European Economic
Community to vote along with Latin American nations to condemn the
U.S. invasion in the U.N. General Assembly.
   ``We want Panama to recover its moral conscience, which has been
left enormously perturbed as a result of all these events,''
Ordonez said.
   ``We also want it to recover its hope for the future, rebuild
its economy, and that the government can advance in the paths of
peace, freedom and prosperity. That's what's most important,'' he
said.
   Thailand's government spokesman Suvit Yodmani said: ``We think
it is important that a person who has been accused and indicted for
a crime _ especially a crime such as narcotics, which is damaging
internationally _ will be brought to fair trial.
   ``It is none of our business. However, as drug trafficking
affects countries internationally, we are happy that the accused
will be tried fairly in U.S. court.
   ``I think this will lead to more permanent peace in Panama,''
Yodmani said.
   The Japanese Foreign Ministry said it had no comment because the
matter is strictly among the three nations, the United States,
Panama and the Vatican.
   Japan has not yet officially recognized Panama's new government,
``although Japan has an impression that the new government has made
a remarkable improvement,'' in the country, said a Foreign Ministry
official, speaking on condition of anonymity.

   Government, opposition and church
representatives attended a Mass for an American nun slain in an
attack the government blamed on U.S.-backed Contra rebels. A Contra
leader denied responsibility.
   Following the Mass on Wednesday, the body of Sister Maureen
Courtney, 45, left Nicargua today on a Honduran SAHSA flight to
Miami, where it will be transferred to a plane bound for her
hometown of Milwaukee.
   She and Sister Teresa Rosales, 24, a Nicaraguan, were killed and
two other church workers were wounded Monday while riding in a
pickup truck in Ojo de Agua, between the mining towns of Siuna and
Rosita in northeastern Nicaragua.
   ``We do not have words to express our deep sorrow over such an
act of violence,'' said a communique read Wednesday at the Mass by
Bishop Salvador Schlaefer of Bluefields, in the Atlantic coast
region where Sister Courtney worked with Miskito Indians.
   Commander Jose Gonzalez, the Interior Ministry's delegate in the
Atlantic coast town of Puerto Cabezas, represented the government
at the Mass. Sandinista President Daniel Ortega and Interior
Minister Tomas Borge sent flowers.
   Attending for opposition presidential candidate Violeta Barrios
de Chamorro was her mother-in-law, Margarita Cardenal de Chamorro.
The candidate, who is in Houston for knee surgery, published a
newspaper advertisement Wednesday condemning the killings and
demanding an investigation.
   Aristides Sanchez, a spokesman for the Nicaraguan Resistance _
an umbrella group for the Contras _ said on Costa Rican radio the
Sandinista government blamed the rebels for the attack to rob them
of U.S. congressional support.
   U.S. non-lethal aid for the Contras runs out after Nicaraguan
presidential elections are held Feb. 25.
   ``We protect the civilian population, we are Catholic and we
support the episcopal work of the Catholic Church,'' Sanchez said
on Radio Impacto.
   He said the Resistance regretted the deaths but that the rebels
``are incapable of taking such an action.''
   Barricada, the newspaper of the ruling Sandinistas, said the
attack was ``a premeditated ambush'' by the Contras, who have a
strong presence in the remote region of Zelaya province where the
attack occurred. The region is 250 miles northeast of Managua.
   Sister Francisca Colomer, 24, suffered face and body wounds and
Auxiliary Bishop Pablo Schmitz, 48, a Capuchin priest from Fond du
Lac, Wis., was wounded in the left arm in the attack. All three
nuns belonged to the Order of St. Agnes.
   Sister Colomer and Schmitz were being treated in a Managua
military hospital and were expected to recover.
   In Fond du Lac, Sister Jean Steffes, mother superior for the
Sisters of St. Agnes, said: ``Both sisters were killed instantly as
result of gunfire. The white pickup truck in which the group was
traveling was clearly marked with yellow crosses. When those still
alive in the truck shouted they were religious, the firing ceased,
but by then two were dead.''
   Sister Colette Hartman of Fond du Lac, who knew Courtney about
18 years and spent 27 years in Nicaragua, said nuns in Nicaragua
told her by telephone that a group of about 60 Contras known as the
Jorge Salazar group were involved. She said she was told the rebels
used a rocket and a hand grenade in the ambush.
   Schmitz told reporters in Puerto Cabezas that the attack came
after dark and he could not identify the assailants.
   ``I only know that a mine went off or a grenade and there was
heavy shooting afterward,'' Schmitz said. ``We identified
ourselves, but nobody came to the pickup.''
   Jaime Arauz, one of two peasants detained by the army in the
area of the attack, said they were kidnapped by a Contra group and
were told the rebels were waiting to ambush an army convoy. Arauz
spoke to The Associated Press and other news media in Puerto
Cabezas on Tuesday.
   Sister Courtney, a Nicaraguan missionary for 15 years, is
believed to be the first American killed in the 9-year-old
Nicaraguan civil war since Contras killed Benjamin Linder in April
1987.
   Linder was a 27-year-old engineer from Portland, Ore.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev met today with
Lithuanian Communists in hopes of persuading them to reverse a
decision to break with the federal Communist Party, but the talks
reportedly ended in a deadlock.
   Meanwhile, party leaders in Estonia were meeting to consider a
draft policy statement that favors independence for the republic
and its Communist Party.
   A local journalist, Tarmu Tammerk, said the statement was
expected to win approval during the Central Committee meeting today
in Estonia's capital, Tallinn.
   The Lithuanian party voted 855-160 two weeks ago to split from
the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, leading Gorbachev to
summon party leaders for a meeting in Moscow.
   Lithuanian journalist Eduardas Potashinskas said a party member
who was at the meeting described the mood as respectful but said
the talks broke up after 5{ hours without a compromise.
   Gorbachev strongly opposes the Lithuanian decision to split from
the national party, but he also has ruled out the use of force
against the Baltic republic.
   In a speech on Christmas Day, Gorbachev noted that extraordinary
measures, such as deployment of troops and tanks, have been used
against ``hooligans'' in rioting in the republic of Uzbekistan and
the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh.
   ``But in these conditions, when we have the participation of
wide strata of the population, we have tried and are trying to use
political means,'' he said, referring to the wide public support
for Lithuania's independence movement.
   After that speech, the national party's Central Committee
directed Gorbachev to visit Lithuania to try to heal the break. He
is expected to go next week.
   Vida Laumenskaite, a secretary of Lithuania's pro-independent
Sajudis group, said there were rumors Gorbachev would ask
Lithuanians to suspend their action until a national Communist
Party congress can be held in October.
   The congress is expected to redefine the party's role in Soviet
society, to fall in line with Gorbachev's calls for the party to
get out of day-to-day affairs and play more of an ideological role.
   Faced with the Lithuanian break, some dissenting Communists in
the republic formed an alternate Central Committee that proclaims
loyalty to Moscow and the Soviet Communist Party that Gorbachev
heads.

<HEAD>Drug Chief Reportedly Kidnaps Son of Presidential Adviser</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STAN YARBRO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A newspaper said today that Pablo
Escobar, a reputed leader of the Medellin cocaine cartel, has
kidnapped the son of President Virgilio Barco's closest adviser.
   El Tiempo said it was the latest in a series of abductions aimed
at pressuring the government to ends its crackdown on drug lords
and raising money from ransom payments to make up for losses caused
by the crackdown.
   A group of men contracted by Escobar abducted Alvaro Diego
Montoya, the president of a financial services firm, as he left his
office in Bogota on Dec. 20, El Tiempo reported.
   El Tiempo, Colombia's largest newspaper, said it obtained the
information from sources at the presidential palace and at
Montoya's company, Probolsa.
   A presidential press spokesman, reached by telephone today, said
he had no information about the report.
   Montoya is the son of German Montoya, Barco's secretary general
and considered the president's right-hand man. Last year, Montoya
carried several messages to Barco from a lawyer representing the
drug chiefs.
   In the messages, Escobar and other cartel leaders promised to
abandon their multibillion-dollar business in exchange for a
government amnesty, Montoya has said. The Barco administration said
the offers were rejected.
   Montoya's son is one of 18 people, many of them belonging to
Colombia's richest families, abducted by the cartel in the past
three weeks, according to El Tiempo. A source quoted by the paper
said the government had information tying the cartel to the
kidnappings. The source said the abductions were in retaliation for
Barco's war against drug traffickers.
   As part of the anti-drug campaign, police shot and killed
Escobar's close associate, Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, in a Dec. 15
gunfight on Colombia's northern coast. A special police force is
said to be hounding Escobar and has come close to catching him at
least once.
   Authorities occupy several of the drug suspect's properties,
which were raided shortly after the government began its crackdown
Aug. 18. The crackdown began after traffickers assassinated a
leading presidential candidate.
   Traffickers have responded to the government offensive with a
terror campaign that has killed scores of people.
   The source quoted by El Tiempo said the Medellin cartel is using
the kidnappings not only to pressure the government to call off its
campaign but also to earn money. The newspaper did not say how much
money the cartel had demanded in exchange for release of kidnap
victims.
   The source reportedly said the cartel needs ransom money to
solve a cash-flow problem caused by police raids on its facilities.
   ``Although it may seem hard to believe, the cartel is
confronting a liquidity problem,'' the source was quoted as saying.

   A packed passenger train was switched
onto the wrong track and plowed into a standing freight train early
today, killing 210 people in the worst rail disaster in Pakistan's
history, officials said.
   Many of the estimated 700 injured were trapped in mangled and
derailed coaches of the 16-car passenger train. Army troops rushed
to the scene in southern Pakistan and helped extricate victims from
the wreckage.
   Railway officials said rescuers recovered 188 dead by this
afternoon, but officials at the scene said there were 210 known
dead. The death toll was likely to rise as troops with metal
torches searched through the wreckage.
   Pakistan radio broadcast appeals for blood donations.
   The passenger train was packed beyond its 1,408-seat capacity
when, traveling at more than 35 mph, it hit the empty freight
train, said Muktar Ahmad Abassi, the regional traffic officer for
Pakistan Railways.
   He said the engineer had no chance to brake.
   ``It was apparently a lineman's (switchman's) fault, who put the
passenger train on the same track,'' said Abassi.
   The accident occurred 225 miles north of the port city of
Karachi at Sukkur. The city's deputy administrative commissioner,
Hazul Baksh, said its seven hospitals were overflowing with injured
an that some of the injured were being moved to other cities.
Sukkur's hospitals have about 300 beds in all.
   Baksh said hundreds of people had responded to the appeal for
blood.
   Abassi said three cars of the passenger train, each seating 88
people, were destroyed and two were badly damaged.
   The passenger train was traveling south on a 500-mile trip from
Multan to Karachi and approaching the village of Sangi shortly
after midnight when an improperly set switch shunted it off onto a
siding and into the parked 67-car freight train, he said.
   ``It's a disaster, and the worst rail accident in Pakistan's
history,'' said Abassi. The country won independence from India in
1947.
   Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto ``expressed her deep sense of
shock and grief over the tragic railway accident,'' according to
the official news agency, Associated Press of Pakistan.
   It said she told her railway minister and other authorities to
expedite rescue and medical aid, and start an immediate
investigation.
   Ms. Bhutto had been scheduled to fly to Karachi today and was
expected to add a stop at Sukkur.
   Pakistan's previous worst rail disaster was in 1958 when at
least 150 people were killed as two trains collided near Gamber, in
Punjab province.
   In April 1983, two passenger trains collided in China, killing
600 people and injuring more than 2,000.
   On Jan. 14, 1985, 428 people were killed in Ethiopia when a
train derailed into a ravine.

<HEAD>Investigators Gather in Mail Bomb Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities from three states investigating a
series of mail bombs have been shown the high-tech tools the
federal government is using in the case.
   A special computer network reserved for major cases and
sophisticated laboratory tests, including procedures for DNA
identification, were demonstrated Wednesday during a meeting of
authorities from Atlanta, Savannah, Birmingham, Ala. and
Jacksonville, Fla., said FBI spokesman Diader Rosario.
   It was the first meeting involving federal, state and local law
enforcement representatives from all four cities in which mail
bombs were received during a series of attacks in December that
killed a federal judge and a civil rights lawyer.
   Those attending the meeting also were briefed on evidence gained
from a public hotline set up to receive tips in the case, Rosario
said.
   Rosario said today there will be further such meetings, but no
date has been set for the next one. He said the FBI, which is
coordinating the investigation, does not want to have the meetings
too often.
   ``Every time you meet you pull people out of the field, where
they can do more good,'' he said.
   Rosario said the investigation has not narrowed to any
particular area, and still is in full swing in Georgia, Alabama and
Florida.
   Robert Vance, a judge on the Atlanta-based 11th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals, was killed Dec. 16 when a mail bomb exploded at
his home near Birmingham, Ala. Two days later, Savannah Alderman
Robert Robinson, an attorney who did work with the NAACP, was
killed by a similar bomb. Authorities intercepted bombs sent to the
11th Circuit courthouse in Atlanta and an NAACP office in
Jacksonville before they could explode.
   A letter to Atlanta television station WAGA-TV last week claimed
a group calling itself Americans for a Competent Federal Judicial
System was responsible for the bombs and threatened more violence.
   The letter writer expressed anger over crimes committed by
blacks against whites and also made an apparent reference to a
school desegregation case in DeKalb County.
   FBI agents searched DeKalb County schools during the Christmas
holidays, looking for clues to the bomber and for bombs, according
to news reports. The FBI and the school system have refused to
comment on the reports.
   Georgia Gov. Joe Frank Harris said at a news conference
Wednesday that he would be willing to post a reward for information
in the case, if police ask him to do so. He said he has received no
such requests.

   Here is an edited transcript of the 10-minute
conversation the night of Oct. 23 between state police dispatcher
Gary McLaughlin and Charles Stuart, who allegedly had been abducted
and shot along with his wife after leaving a birthing class at
Brigham and Women's Hospital.
   Stuart was communicating on his automobile telephone as he and
his wife lay wounded in the front seat of their car. Stuart's wife
Carol and baby son Christopher, delivered by Caesarean section,
both died.

   ``Chuck, can you hear me, buddy? ... I need a little better
location to find you right away. Come on, Chuck. Damn! Chuck? Hello
Chuck, can you hear me?''
   (long pause)
   (In the background other police officers can be heard discussing
whether sirens can be heard. After more pleas for Chuck to respond
the officers can be heard in the background ordering patrol cars to
individually flick on their sirens so it can be determined which
car is nearest the open phone line.)
   ``Chuck Stuart, stay with me buddy, I can still hear you moving.
Can you pick up the phone, Chuck? Chuck Stuart, come on Chuck, can
you pick up the phone? Chuck Stuart, are you there? Chuck? Hello,
Chuck.''
   (Long pause. Stuart is implored again to pick up the phone.
Finally, he does.)
   ``I hear the police.''
   ``Chuck!''
   ``I hear the police.''
   ``Chuck! Where are you, Chuck?''
   ``Help, help. Get in touch with the state police, my wife and
I've been shot.''
   ``Chuck!''
   ``Right here there's Boston police.''
   ``Put the Boston police officer on the phone, Chuck.''
   ``Boston, hello Boston. Hello?''
   (Background voice calls ''We've located him!'')
   ``I don't want to terminate until someone can hear me. Want me
to terminate, Sarge?''
   (The tape becomes a jumble of voices and activity. Then Stuart
can be heard.)
   ``Get my wife out.''

year.
   ``We need very quickly to train 10,000 English teachers,'' said
Paul Coverdell, director of the Peace Corps. He said the request
for trained teachers of English as a foreign language originated
with Poland's new regime and that a formal agreement is expected to
be signed in February.
   The Peace Corps recently began recruiting English teachers to

a degree in teaching English as a foreign language, a year's
experience, U.S. citizenship and a willingness to serve abroad for
two years.

   Protesters in the republic of Azerbaijan began
retreating from the Soviet-Iran border today after four days of
violent attempts to reunite with with their Iranian brethren, a
protest organizer said.
   ``The situation is stabilizing. People are gradually going
home,'' said Yusif Samedoglu, a writer and leader of the
Azerbaijani People's Front, which organized the protest. He spoke
by telephone from Baku, the capital of Azerbaijan.
   The Azerbaijanis, who are largely Shiite Moslems, began
demonstrating Sunday for unification with a region peopled by their
ethnic kin in Iran. The protesters demanded an open border and the
freedom to trade and cross the frontier, practices that were
suspended by dictator Josef Stalin.
   Savili A. Perets, deputy director of the official news agency
Azerinform, said in a telephone interview from Baku that the border
area was calming down. He said Azerbaijan party chief Abdul-Rakhman
Vezirov and other officials traveled to the protest area today to
investigate.
   The KGB rushed border troop reinforcements to the area Wednesday
to stop protesters from demolishing guard towers and security
alarms.
   The disturbances along Azerbaijan's nearly 500-mile-long border
with Iran were the latest flare-up in two years of ethnic unrest
among Azerbaijanis, Armenians, Georgians, Abkhazians and other
ethnic groups in the Soviet Caucasus region. More than 300 people
have died nationwide in ethnic unrest in the past two years.
   Lt. Gen. Nikolai Britvin, head of the political department of
the KGB's special border guard units, told the official Tass news
agency Wednesday that one person was killed in a clash on the
Soviet-Iran frontier, but he did not say when. He also did not say
whether others were injured.
   Britvin said one Soviet citizen crossed the border into Iran and
``there were probably other crossings,'' but that there was no
large-scale flight.
   The government daily Izvestia said some protesters were armed
with pistols and hunting rifles, and it estimated damage from the
rioting at more than $8.2 million.
   Tass said about 7,500 protesters destroyed guard observation
towers, electronic alarm equipment and communications lines along
the border when rioting broke out on Sunday.
   Izvestia said the turmoil stretched from the Azerbaijani enclave
of Nakhichevan, sandwiched between Armenia and Iran, to the regions
of Zangelansk and Pushkinsk and the Caspian Sea port of Lenkoran in
Azerbaijan itself. It said unrest continued through Wednesday.
   Britvin told Tass, however, that the incidents lasted only
through Tuesday and that the situation was ``gradually returning to
normal.''
   Nonetheless, he said border guard reinforcements were sent in
with armored personnel carriers. Neither he nor Izvestia said how
many guards were normally stationed along the frontier or how many
reinforcements were dispatched.
   A KGB spokesman refused to comment today on the latest
developments.
   The border disturbances threatened to complicate Soviet-Iranian
relations, the Workers' Tribune newspaper said, noting the Iranians
had lodged a protest of the unrest. But Soviet Foreign Ministry
spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said today, ``It's not a big
international issue.''
   The unrest began Dec. 4 when a crowd of Soviet Azerbaijanis
gathered at the border with loudspeakers and called on their
Iranian neighbors, both members of the same ethnic group and
predominantly Shiite Moslems, to unify their regions, Izvestia
reported.
   About 4 million ethnic Azerbaijanis live in the adjoining
Iranian province of Azerbaijan, where Stalin briefly set up a
puppet state during World War II before being forced by Western
powers to withdraw in 1946.
   The Azerbaijanis are the only Soviet ethnic group who, like
Iranians, are largely Shiite Moslems. Since the 1979 Islamic
revolution in Iran, Soviet officials have expressed concern about
Islamic fundamentalism creeping across the border.

   Morocco's coastline is no longer in danger
of being spoiled by a huge oil spill, and nearly all the 19 million
gallons of oil that gushed into the sea have dissolved, pollution
experts said today.
   The Iranian tanker Khark 5, which began leaking oil after an
explosion Dec. 19, had been towed 300 miles off the Moroccan coast
by Wednesday night, said the Dutch salvage firm Smit Tak.
   The edge of the slick held its position today 20 miles off the
oyster-farming community of Oualidyia, the official Maghreb Arab
Presse agency said.
   Sailors laid floating barriers Wednesday, while helicopters
sprayed chemicals on the greenish, 100-square-mile oil slick.
   ``The real danger to the Moroccan coast is over,'' Jean-Claude
Sainnos, director of Mediterranean Marine Anti-Pollution Center in
Valletta, Malta, said today. ``If the vessel had come ashore, that
would have been a major catastrophe.''
   Sainnos said more than 90 percent of the spill had dissolved in
the relatively warm 60 degree water, had been broken up by waves,
or dissolved by chemicals.
   Darko Domovic, a technical expert at the Anti-Pollution Center,
said there was practically no danger of massive spoiling of
Morocco's coast, although bits of oil could wash ashore over the
next couple of months.
   ``There is very, very little oil left on the sea surface,'' said
Domovic. ``What's left is an extremely thin sheen with patches of
emulsified oil.''
   Morocco threatened to sue Iran's national oil company and
accused Smit Tak of reacting too slowly to the explosion that tore
through the Khark 5's hull.
   Smit Tak, however, said its salvage operation was hampered
because Morocco and Spain refused to let the tanker be towed near
their coasts for emergency repairs. Instead, three tugboats were
towing the 283,632-ton ship toward calmer waters near the Cape
Verde islands, a 1,100-mile journey expected to take eight days.
   Iranian Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh said today that reports
of environmental damage caused by the spill were exaggerated, and
he said the ship met all safety specifications.
   The vessel, built in 1975, was damaged at least three times in
Iraqi air strikes in the Persian Gulf during the Iran-Iraq war. The
normal lifepsan of a supertanker is 15-20 years.
   Speaking on Tehran radio, Aqazadeh said a storm ripped a hole in
one of the tanker's storage tanks, causing the explosion that
started the leak. He said some oil from the damaged storage tank
burned in the fire, while a ``limited amount'' leaked out.
   The Khark 5 was loaded with 72 million gallons of light Iranian
crude when the explosion occurred 400 miles north of Las Palmas in
the Canary Islands.
   As the oil crept toward the coast, the Moroccan government said
it endangered fisheries, tourist beaches, a migratory bird reserve
and in important breeding ground of pink flamingoes.
   Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Glenn Wiltshire, head of an oil spill
strike force in Mobile, Ala., left Wednesday for Rabat to see what
the United States could do to help, said Cmdr. John McElwain, a
Coast Guard spokesman.
   Wiltshire will look into equipment needs, response tactics and
possible cleanup operations, McElwain said in Washington. He said
strike force teams in Alabama and San Francisco could be used in
helping to deal with the spill.
   Dutch Television said authorities in the Netherlands had seized
five Iranian-owned tankers over the past 14 months and prevented
them from leaving Rotterdam until they underwent repairs.
   They included three sister ships of the Khark 5, according to
the report, but none of the vessels was identified. The report said
the vessels failed to meet international safety and environmental
standards; it did not elaborate.

   Subway shooter Bernhard Goetz says he'll agree
to give a deposition in a $50 million lawsuit against him only if
he can interview the plaintiff, one of the four young men he shot
in 1984.
   The suit was filed on behalf of Darrell Cabey, who was paralyzed
from the waist down by the shooting in a subway car. Cabey's
lawyers say he also suffered brain damage and is mentally
incompetent.
   ``I think all this mental vegetable business is to prevent
Darrell Cabey from having any legal exposure,'' Goetz said. ``I'll
be deposed after Cabey meets his legal obligations.''
   One of Cabey's lawyers, William Kunstler, said Goetz is
obligated under state law to give his deposition first since he is
the defendant.
   In a legal notice filed Wednesday, Goetz said he wanted to
interview Cabey Jan. 18.
   Kunstler said a hearing is scheduled Jan. 12 to determine if
Goetz should be declared the loser in the lawsuit for failing to
show up for his own deposition last month.
   Goetz has said in court papers that he has been unable to appear
in court because he had major cancer surgery last month and was
undergoing radiation treatments. He would not specify what type of
cancer he has.
   Cabey and three companions, all teen-agers at the time, were
shot by Goetz when they approached him in a subway car on Dec. 22,
1984. Goetz said they intended to rob him; they said they were
panhandling. Goetz, 42, was acquitted of attempted murder but
convicted of violating weapons laws, for which he served eight
months in prison.
   Goetz told The Associated Press he will not be deposed until he
is allowed to interview Cabey.
   ``I'm taking the position that I have some rights under this
legal system,'' Goetz said.
   Kunstler dismissed Goetz' action as ``a last-ditch attempt at
avoiding coming to the Bronx to be interrogated by hostile
lawyers.''
   Goetz is aware that Cabey is mentally incompetent, Kunstler said.
   ``He should know. He paralyzed him,'' Kunstler said. ``He brain
damaged him.''

<HEAD>Washington County Passes Unusual Health Law To Fight Crack Houses</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Operators of crack houses in King County must run
their businesses in accordance with public health rules or face
huge fines, in an unusual legal move that officials hope will close
down the drug dens.
   The ruling, approved Wednesday by the King County Board of
Health, requires crack house operators ``to submit a plan of
operation for reducing health and safety hazards'' or face a
$10,000-a-day fine.
   The hazards listed in the ruling include drug use and associated
health effects, exposure to toxic chemical fumes, the spread of
sexually transmitted diseases through prostitution, violence and
neighborhood blight.
   ``It is just another tool we can use to get at crack houses,''
said Ron Sims, King County councilman and a Board of Health member.
   Under the ruling, police would identify a crack house and inform
the Seattle-King County Health Department. The department would
then notify the owner or operator by registered mail that a plan to
reduce health risks must be submitted within 10 days and be
accompanied by a $100 fee. The board must approve of the plan or
the penalty applies.
   King County police and the county prosecutor's office supported
the ruling, although they had urged delaying passage so it could be
studied for flaws. Robert Stier, senior deputy King County
prosecutor in the civil division, said he had never seen similar
legislation.
   Although King County encompasses Seattle, the regulation does
not apply in Seattle city limits because the city council, not the
county council, acts as the governing body for the Seattle portion
of the health department.

<HEAD>Overcrowding Forces New York City Hospitals To Cancel Elective
Admissions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   City hospitals have become so crowded that they
have suspended elective admissions and the state has provided them
with lists of where the few available beds are.
   ``This is the first time we've used the system to effect a
transfer of patients from an overcrowded hospital to one with open
beds,'' Frances Tarlton, a Health Department spokeswoman, said
Wednesday.
   The state acted after a computer analysis showed that more than
900 patients could not be placed in city hospitals Wednesday
because of lack of beds, she said.
   ``We have identified 230 open beds and sent that information to
hospitals,'' Tarlton said.
   The city's Health and Hospitals Corp. reacted to the influx by
canceling elective admissions, said HHC spokeswoman Suzanne Halpin.
   Early January is traditionally a crowded time in hospitals
because it is flu season and because many people put off elective
surgery until after the holidays, Tarlton said.
   The problem is particularly acute in the boroughs of Queens and
the Bronx, she said. Lincoln Hospital in the Bronx, for example,
had 50 people waiting for admission.
   Tarlton emphasized that the state has not ordered the transfer
of any patients.
   Monitoring of available hospital beds and patients waiting in
the emergency room began last year. Wednesday ``was the first time
since the system was put into effect it became actually necessary
to identify hospitals able to accept transfers,'' she said today.
   ``We're going to continue to monitor the system and continue to
try to help the hospitals redistribute the patient load as long as
its necessary,'' Tarlton said.
   Dr. Donald C. Meyer, executive director of the Doctors Council,
praised the action by state Health Commissioner Dr. David Axelrod
but called it long overdue.
   ``We've had a crisis for quite some time. But like anything else
in New York, we have a crisis for a while and we get used to it,''
Meyer said.
   On any given day, there are about 600 people awaiting admission
to New York City hospitals. But on Wednesday, the number was closer
to 900, said Tarlton.
   Meyer said private hospitals are being asked to take some of the
patients, but he acknowledged that some of those hospitals are also
overcrowded. Many of the patients being transferred are poor or
have no health insurance, making it less likely that a private
hospital would accept the patients, Meyer said.
   Transferring patients is only a short-term solution, Meyer said.
``One of our major problems is that we have the beds available but
we can't get enough nurses,'' he said.

<HEAD>Hastened Delivery of Decade's First Baby For TV Show Prompts Probe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   State regulators are said to be
investigating a doctor who speeded up delivery of a baby, plopped
the infant into a Christmas stocking and dashed to a TV studio next
door to display her as the county's first newborn of the '90s.
   The Board of Medical Quality Assurance opened a formal
investigation Wednesday, the Los Angeles Times reported Thursday,
citing unidentified sources.
   Myra Kristine Palmer was officially delivered 15 seconds after
midnight by Dr. Charles Wesley Turner Jr. and presented a short
time later on a nationally televised religious service led by the
Rev. Ralph Wilkerson.
   Turner, 64, insisted neither the mother, Brigitte Palmer, nor
her 6-pound, 12-ounce baby girl was harmed by his hastening of the
delivery at Turner's Covenant Birthing Center in Orange County. The
doctor said the mother went into labor naturally.
   Turner said Wilkerson, pastor of the next-door Melodyland
Christian Center, had asked months ago if he could provide a
newborn for the New Year's Eve service.
   ``We had the mother push at 11:59,'' Turner said. ``I put the
forceps on and pulled the infant out. We had her at 15 seconds
after midnight. ... I used the forceps because I wanted to have the
first baby in the New Year.
   ``I was highly jubilant,'' he said. ``The congregation yelled
and screamed and applauded. And everybody wanted to see the baby.''
   Mrs. Palmer, 25, said she ``felt felt a little funny because he
took her and ran off with her. But he wanted to have her on TV. It
was a special feeling for everyone to see the baby.''
   Dr. Roger Schlesinger, president of the Orange County Obstetrics
and Gynecological Society, said he believes Turner took a risk in
taking the newborn outside.
   ``I don't think I'd take my newborn out of a hospital,''
Schlesinger said. ``Any newborn baby requires some degree of
observation. Some have low blood sugars. Some convulse.''
   ``Babies are pretty hardy,'' he said. ``Most do well. But some
don't. So I guess he was playing the odds a bit.''
   Turner, who said he has delivered more than 18,000 babies in his
40-year career, said: ``I don't think there's anything wrong with
having the first baby of the New Year. And the baby was delivered
safely. And I see nothing wrong with taking the baby and showing it
to the 4,000'' people at Melodyland.
   In 1984, the state medical board accused Turner of illegally
prescribing dangerous drugs and placed his license on five years'
probation. Turner pleaded no contest to a related misdemeanor and
was placed on three years' criminal probation and fined $15,000.
   In 1988, he was named in a 1988 wrongful death lawsuit after a
child he delivered at Santa Ana Hospital Medical Center died
immediately after birth, the Times reported. The suit alleges
Turner caused the death by failing to perform a timely Caesarean
section.
   Turner denied any wrongdoing in the case Wednesday. He remains
on the staff at Santa Ana but lost the privilege to practice
obstetrics there, the Times said.

   The emerging political parties may be
split on platforms and ideologies, but they are united on one
point: the proposed April 17 election date is too soon for a nation
awakening from decades of despotic Communist rule.
   The task of reviving democratic traditions stifled since 1947 is
complicated by the fact that none of the half-dozen parties
planning to contest the elections has the basic tools for a
successful campaign.
   Until three weeks ago, typewriters had to be registered so that
any dissenting texts could be traced back to their authors, who in
turn could be punished by dictator Nicolae Ceausescu's feared
security police. The machines are a rarity.
   The few telephones available are always busy.
   Westerners asking about the availability of photocopiers,
computers and teletypes draw laughter.
   The Christian Peasants' Party, one of Romania's most dominant
political forces before being forced to disband after the 1947
Communist takeover, is typical of how the emerging democratic
parties stand a little more than three months before the planned
polls.
   ``We're lucky, we have four typewriters,'' said Anca Dobrota, a
volunteer secretary at the party's headquarters. ``Unfortunately,
only three are working.''
   Ms. Dobrota said that her party, which set up operations
Wednesday at what was a district Communist Party building, had two
telephones, ``and they are busy all the time.''
   She had to shout to make herself heard above the voices
emanating from hundreds of people crowding rooms, halls and
stairways of the three-story building and discussing politics with
the explosive vehemence born of 41 years of repression.
   ``The Social Democrats are as bad as the Communists!'' shouted
one octogenarian.
   His aged friend nodded. ``There's no point in all of this!'' he
shouted back. ``The National Salvation Front is going to win
anyway.''
   Others agreed that the Front _ the interim body running the
country since Ceausescu's overthrow Dec. 22 and his execution three
days later _ likely would win early elections because of its high
profile and control of the mass media.
   ``We don't have access to television or to the newspapers, and
so, we do not have contact with the people,'' said Niculaie Costel,
a spokesman for the Democratic Party of Romania. ``In this way, the
front can control the opposition, and a large part of the communist
hierarchy will be re-elected, and that will be a catastrophe.''
   Others disagree that the Front poses a Communist threat,
pointing to the de facto dissolution of the Communist Party in the
wake of Ceausescu's downfall.
   But members and officials of several different parties all
agreed the Front has unfair advantage and that its high profile,
coupled with the lack of resources available to other parties,
threatens the concept of free and fair elections.
   ``If the Front truly wants to promote democracy, they have to
understand that April is too soon,'' for elections, said Ion Puiu,
the 72-year-old vice president of the Peasants' Party. Some of his
aged counselors nodded in agreement.
   Party official Vicente Zagun shared that view outside Puiu's
office, referring to the poor communications in a country where
road and rail travel are near impossible in winter.
   ``It is very difficult to organize by April,'' Zagun said. ``We
have no way of communicating with our sister organizations across
the country, and have little access to newspapers, radio and
television.''
   ``As a matter of fact, the Front's National Council is sure to
win, unless the elections are postponed, at least until August,''
said Zagun, 73, seated near a table crowded with people _ nearly
all of them in their 70s or 80s _ filling out membership forms.
   Zagun acknowledged concerns that many supporters of his party
are elderly people who were members before 1947, and he suggested
that also could hurt its chances at the polls.
   ``We want to be a party for the young, but the young people
don't know what democracy means because they grew up in a
dictatorship,'' he said, alluding to the 24-year Ceausescu era, and
the 17 years under his Communist predecessor, Gheorghe
Gheorghiu-Dej.
   Youths disagree that they know little of democracy, noting that
university students were a main force behind the December
revolution that toppled Ceausescu.
   But political movements representing almost exclusively young
people also appear ill-prepared for April elections.
   At a Bucharest night school Thursday, several dozen people were
crammed into a room that is the temporary headquarters of the
Romanian Ecological Movement, discussing whether or not to field
candidates. Outside, workers replaced glass doors shattered by
fighting just 12 days ago.
   ``It is so stupid to be wasting time on this debate!'' shouted
organizer Dorina Enescu. ``We don't even have time to organize, we
have no funds, we have no telephone. `We have nothing.''

   A new traffic headache is in store for
Southern Californians _ a Giblock. That's what happens when state
transportation officials close a freeway so a film crew can shoot a
Mel Gibson movie.
   This weekend, four miles of the Terminal Island Freeway will be
closed for filming of ``Air America,'' an action movie in which
Gibson and Robert Downey Jr. play pilots for the CIA's secret
airline.
   Motorists won't get a glimpse of the star of the ``Mad Max'' and
``Lethal Weapon'' films in exchange for the inconvenience.
   ``He's not even going to be there,'' said California Department

   The mystery writer has joked that his former home ``looked like
Godzilla took a walk all through that place.''
   Spillane and his wife, Jane, watched the start of work Wednesday

   ``We're going way up on stilts. It's going to be a bigger house
but with more of a country flavor and facing the water,'' Mrs.
Spillane said.
   The author has said he waited 19 years to write his latest book,

need the money.''
   ``After (Hurricane Hugo), I needed the money very badly,'' he
said.

   Michael J. Fox says his infant son will have a

   ``He'll have a fairly stable future,'' the 28-year-old actor

   Fox said that when he became a star with television's ``Family

casually felt free to ask him if he would lend them $50,000.
   ``But my mother stuttered and stammered over whether I'd
autograph a `Family Ties' mug for the Ladies Auxiliary tea. I've
always been really impressed by that. They taught me to have
respect for people,'' he said.

   A producer is suing Ron Kovic, the Vietnam
veteran whose autobiography was made into the film ``Born on the
Fourth of July,'' contending the author sold him the movie rights
and then failed to help make the film.
   Mel Goldberg, in a lawsuit filed Wednesday in Superior Court,
alleges Kovic sold him the film rights to the book in 1985 and
agreed to put Goldberg in touch with Hollywood figures such as
actors and potential financiers.
   Goldberg contends Kovic breached the contract by never setting
up meetings and failing to allow renewal of the movie option. He is
seeking $1 million in general damages and unspecified punitive
damages.
   Telephone calls to Kovic were not immediately returned.
   ``Born of the Fourth of July,'' starring Tom Cruise as the young
soldier who returns from Vietnam as a paraplegic, was released last

   Chucky Mullins, a University of
Mississippi football player paralyzed by a broken neck suffered in
a game this past season, has undergone surgery to remove pressure
from a nerve that controls breathing.
   Doctors as Baptist Memorial Hospital in Memphis said the
surgery, performed Tuesday, could help Mullins' breathing but is
unlikely to help him regain any movement.
   Mullins, who has been paralyzed from the shoulders down since
the Oct. 28 game, was reported doing well after the surgery.
   ``I'm not real optimistic that it's going to change a whole lot,
but if we didn't do it then we'd never know,'' said Dr. Clarence
Watridge.
   Watridge said the surgery removed pieces of two vertebrae and
some bone fragments from his spinal cord.
   Doctors said the surgery could help Mullins get off the
ventilator that has helped him breathe.

<HEAD>Former West German Foreign Minister Dies at Age 79</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gerhard Schroeder, former foreign
minister and a co-founder of the country's conservative Christian
Democratic Union, has died at the age of 79.
   Schroeder died of heart and kidney complications Jan. 1 at his
home in the town of Kampen on the island of Sylt off the northern
coast of West Germany, said his wife, Brigitte.
   Born Sept. 11, 1910 in the southwestern German city of
Saarbruecken, Schroeder studied law, philosophy and history in
Berlin and Bonn before receiving his law degree in 1932.
   In 1939, he began practice as an attorney before being drafted
into the German army, where he reached the rank of sergeant.
   Schroeder was captured by the British during World War II, and
was freed after the war in 1945.
   He was among the founders of the conservative Christian
Democratic Union party in Hamburg and a leading member of the party
council.
   In 1949, Schroeder was voted into the first West German
parliament as a deputy from the Duesseldorf district of Mettmann.
He remained a member of parliament until he retired from politics
in 1980.
   From 1953 to 1961, Schroeder served as interior minister under
West Germany's first chancellor, Konrad Adenauer.
   Schroeder, a strong supporter of close ties with the United
States, was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of
Maryland in 1959.
   In 1961, he became foreign minister under Adenauer, a post he
kept when Ludwig Erhard took over as chancellor in 1963.
   When the ``great coalition'' of Christian Democrats and the
leftist Social Democratic Party formed a new government in 1966,
Schroeder was appointed defense minister.
   Three years later, when a coalition of the Social Democrats and
the business-minded Free Democrats under then Chancellor Willy
Brandt took over the government, Schroeder's career as a cabinet
minister ended. However, he remained a member of parliament until
his retirement in 1980.
   An active member of the Luthern Church, Schroeder served as
president of its working council. He also was president of the West
German Society of Photography from 1954 to 1978.
   Besides his wife, Schroeder is survived by two daughters and a
son.

   An alderman's one-woman campaign for a
gender-neutral political label has been defeated for the third
time, forcing her to rethink her title fight.
   ``It didn't have a chance,'' said Evelyn G. Chesky. ``I think
the board (name) has to be labeled sexist even though that's
strong. It's a definite gender.''
   Chesky's measure to change the name of government to City
Council instead of the Board of Aldermen was defeated 9-6 Tuesday.
Two years ago the proposal lost 12-3, and a year ago it failed 9-5.
   After four years on the 15-member board, Chesky said her cause
has drawn ``mostly ridicule in a nice way. It's like they get a
kick out of putting me on for something like this.''
   Alderman Francis E. Rogers said he doesn't see any reason to
switch names.
   ``There's no gender gap per se in the fact that it's by charter
`aldermen' and so be it,'' he said. He said female members can be
called ``alderwoman'' if they want, but the board should keep the
name it has had since 1873.
   Three women serve on the board. One voted against the name
change, which needed 10 votes to pass, saying she wanted to keep
the traditional name.
   But Chesky said the old name hampers the image of the board,
which saw its first female member in 1926.
   Chesky said she had hoped the issue would pass this time. ``I
even went for the symbolism of the last decade and going in the
next century and all that,'' she said.
   On Thursday, Chesky said she does not know whether she'll pursue
her title fight for a fourth time.

<HEAD>Independent Medical Team to Decide If Honecker Can be Jailed</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-East Germany</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An independent medical team has been asked to
determine if ousted Communist leader Erich Honecker is fit to be
jailed while he awaits possible charges of corruption in office, it
was reported Thursday.
   Honecker, 77, underwent gall bladder surgery in August, and he
has been described as incapacitated by the illness.
   A decision is expected soon as to whether he could sustain
imprisonment, the official ADN news agency said.
   It also disclosed that the security cordon imposed around the
opulent Wandlitz residential compound where Honecker lives was
removed several weeks ago because ``no legal grounds were
established'' on which to detain him.
   An earlier and very brief report from ADN had said simply that
the house arrest of Honecker had been lifted but did not specify
when.
   The Wandlitz complex is being converted to a care center for
handicapped adults, and Honecker will have to be moved to some
other location before the facility opens in February, government
spokesman Wolfgang Meyer has said.
   A parliamentary commission overseeing the corruption
investigation of Honecker and other top officials of his disgraced
regime named a group of independent doctors to determine his
physical condition, ADN said.
   He has been living in seclusion since being forced to step down
from the Communist Party leadership Oct. 18 under pressure from
massive pro-democracy demonstrations and an exodus of skilled young
workers to the West.
   East German officials announced in December that because of his
illness, Honecker had been placed under house arrest amid
allegations of massive corruption in the former government.
   The house arrest came at the same time seven former Communist
Party Politburo members were jailed pending corruption
investigations against them. The investigations are continuing.
   Opposition groups have accused the former leaders of
extravagance while the economy declined and East Germans were
forced to make do with bare essentials.
   On Wednesday, a West German newspaper reported that Lutheran and
Catholic church leaders had offered to house Honecker in church
facilities for the elderly or at a monastery to protect him from
enraged citizens.

   President Bush dispatched the nation's top
military officer to Panama today to plan further U.S. troop
withdrawals and called Pope John Paul II to thank the Vatican for
its help in persuading Manuel Antonio Noriega to surrender to
American authorities.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said Bush was
``gratified this operation was completed in such a successful
fashion.''
   Fitzwater said Bush had called the pope ``to thank him for the
distinguished efforts of the Vatican and the papal nuncio in
Panama.''
   ``The pope expressed his humanitarian concerns for the people of
Panama. Bush assured the pope that General Noriega will be treated
to all the protections of U.S. law and would receive a fair
trial,'' the spokesman said.
   Noriega turned himself in to U.S. authorities Wednesday night
after leaving the protection of the Vatican embassy, where he had
holed up for 10 days. He was flown to Homestead Air Force Base near
Miami and held for arraignment late today on drug-trafficking
charges.
   Fitzwater said Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs
of Staff, was heading for Panama to work with Gen. Maxwell Thurman,
commander of U.S. troops in Panama, to help speed up further
withdrawal of forces.
   The spokesman said that some 2,000 troops have now been brought
home of the 26,000 that were in Panama on Dec. 20, the day of the
invasion that toppled Noriega's government. About half already were
stationed there.
   However, Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said the total number
of troops in Panama was little changed because military police and
civil affairs specialists have replaced some combat units.
   Fitzwater said Noriega was handcuffed briefly after he was taken
into custody, read his constitutional rights in Spanish and
examined by two U.S. military doctors on the C-130 cargo plane that
took him to Florida.
   The doctors found ``no discernible abnormalities'' and reported
that Noriega appeared to be in good health, Fitzwater said.
   The spokesman said that four Panamanians remain sheltered in the
Vatican embassy in Panama City. He said U.S. troops will continue
to maintain a vigil outside the building while they remain inside.
   ``We would expect to question them and ascertain their situation
just as we have others who have left the nunciatura (embassy) in
the past,'' Fitzwater said.
   He said Bush's discussion with the pope was brief. The president
also called Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney to discuss the
Noreiga apprehension and to thank Canada for supporting the United
States at the United Nations, which voted 75-20 last week to
condemn the U.S. invasion.
   Fitzwater said Bush, who announced Noriega's arrest on
nationwide television Wednesday night, ``feels very pleased ...
he's fairly upbeat about the entire situation.''
   But the president was staying out of the public eye today, and
Fitzwater said Bush and other White House officials would be
careful about what they say lest they prejudice Noriega's trial.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, appearing earlier on CBS, said
the United States did not strike a deal with Noriega. He explained
Noriega's surrender this way: ``I think he saw the handwriting on
the wall.''
   He said Noriega's decision to leave the Vatican embassy clears
up a host of legal questions that could have complicated his
prosecution.
   ``We have a good case,'' Thornburgh said on NBC. ``If we can
make it better, we won't hesitate to do so.''
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, also appearing on CBS, said Gens.
Powell and Thurman would work to ``develop a plan for withdrawing
those troops (sent to Panama) over the next several weeks.''
   Cheney called Noriega's surrender ``the icing on the cake'' for
Operation Just Cause, the military invasion the United States
mountedon Dec. 20 to drive Noriega from power. Bush said Wednesday
night that all his objectives in ordering the troops to Panama
``have now been acheived.''
   Bush said the remaining U.S. troops in Panama will be withdrawn
``as quickly as the local situation will permit.''
   Although Thurman stressed Wednesday night that no deals had been
made, administration officials said the United States promised
Noriega that he would receive a fair trial and would not be
prosecuted under a new federal law allowing the death penalty for
``drug kingpins.''
   The United States also agreed to meet three last-minute
conditions by Noriega, the officials said: that he be allowed to
make a few phone calls; that his decision be held secret until his
arrest; and that he be allowed to wear his uniform.
   Bush said in a nationally televised announcement that the United
States ``is committed'' to provide Noriega a fair trial.
   ``Nevertheless,'' Bush added, ``his apprehension and return to
the United States should send a clear signal that the United States
is serious in its determination that those charged with promoting
the distribution of drugs cannot escape the scrutiny of justice.''
   Bush said he had four objectives in ordering the invasion:
safeguarding the lives of Americans, helping to restore democracy,
protecting the integrity of the Panama Canal and bringing Noriega
to justice.
   ``All of these objectives have now been achieved,'' He declared.
He left the briefing room without answering questions.
   Noriega's return to the United States ended a two-year effort by
the United States to bring him to justice and eliminated the source
of what Bush called the major frustration of his first 11 months in
office. But it opened the book on a whole new set of legal problems.
   U.S. legal authorities have been studying secret documents this
past month on Noriega's long tenure as a CIA and Drug Enforcement
Administration informant. They expect he might try to derail his
prosecution by seeking disclosure of information that would be
embarrassing to Bush _ a former CIA director _ and the United
States.
   Bush several days ago said he was concerned that Noriega might
try to ``blindside'' the legal process with such demands; but he
said he wanted him brought to justice in a U.S. court anyway.
   If convicted on all charges, Noriega could face up to 145 years
in prison and more than $1.1 million in fines.
   Bush praised Vatican officials for ``their evenhanded,
statesmanlike assistance in recent days.''
   Administration sources said the United States did not deal
directly with Noriega at any time, and that all negotiations were
conducted between the former military leader and church officials.
   Presidential spokesman Fitzwater said Bush was notified at about
6 p.m. EST by national security adviser Brent Scowcroft that
Noriega was ``willing to give himself up.''
   Even then, Fitzwater said, ``we could not be sure it would
actually occur.'' He said Bush was notified by Defense Secretary
Cheney at about 9 p.m. that Noriega had strolled out of the Vatican
embassy and was in custody.
   At 9:30 p.m., the plane carrying Noriega back to the United
States took off.
   Bush paid a special tribute to ``those servicemen who were
wounded and to the families of those who gave their lives. Their
sacrifice has been a noble cause and will never be forgotten.''
Twenty-three U.S. servicemen were killed and more than 300 injured
in the invasion.

   ``Barnum,'' the musical about the life of P.T.
Barnum, has closed after 11 performances and losses of $2.4
million, the producers said Thursday.
   The show, a revival of the original 1981, suffered scathing
reviews, dwindling audiences and technical difficulties.
   The production, staged under a big top tent in west London with
a 25-member cast and 22-piece orchestra, was due to tour 20 British
towns in the summer after its London run.
   ``Barnum'' starred Peter Duncan, who trained for months to
perform tightrope walking, stilt dancing and juggling.
   ``It is very sad but the ax dropped,'' Duncan said. ``The
receivers were there, these men in suits came in saying `You can't
take anything away.' It was the final insult.''
   Michael Fontaine of LMC Entertainments, the show's producers,
confirmed the company had been placed in receivership.

<HEAD>Rights Group Says Administration Disregards Human Rights</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRYNA BRENNAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A human rights group Thursday accused the Bush
administration of ``widespread disregard for human rights,'' saying
it was soft in its response to the crackdown on pro-democracy
demonstrators in China and an apologist for military abuses in El
Salvador, Guatemala and the Philippines.
   The two-volume report by Human Rights Watch did say there were
``bright spots'' in President Bush's rights policies toward Eastern
Europe, South Africa and Burma, but criticizied the
administration's dealings in most of the 50 nations covered.
   ``Unfortunately, our review of the public positions taken by the
Bush administration during its first year reveals a widespread
disregard for human rights,'' the report said.
   ``Its insistance on seeing the world in geopolitical terms, and
other priorties, gave rise to a striking silence on abuses in many
countries, and a frequent refusal to adjust U.S. policy in light of
those abuses.''
   However, the report said it would be premature to make a final
judgment on the administration's policy because it's so early in
the president's term.
   The State Department said it had no immediate comment.
   The administration ``imposed the minimum sanctions'' on China
after hundreds of people were killed to crush a pro-democracy
movement, the report said. It criticized a secret meeting between
Chinese officials and National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft and
Lawrence Eagleburger, deputy secretary of state.
   ``The administration thus made clear that the killing and
imprisonment of pro-democracy demonstrators would have no material
impact on its dealings with the Chinese leadership,'' the report
said.
   Human Rights Watch said the U.S. policy toward El Salvador also
showed a disregard for human rights.
   ``Despite reduced fears that leftist advances in Central America
would provide a beachhead for Soviet expansionism, the
administration persisted in acting as apologist for abuses
committed by the Salvadoran military in its war with leftist
rebels,'' the report said.
   U.S. officials, the report said, badgered a witness who
implicated the Salvadoran military in the November killing of six
Jesuit priests and two of their employees. The administration
earlier denied similar allegations.
   The United States provides El Salvador with millions of dollars
in economic and military aid in its 10-year-old war with leftist
rebels.
   Human Rights Watch said the administration strengthened ties to
the Guatemalan military ``although political killings increased
dramatically'' and ``refrained from criticizing widespread
killings'' in the Philippines.
   In addition, the group said, the administration has ``all but
stopped public comment'' on human rights issues in the Soviet Union.
   The ``silence seems to be based in large part on new political
considerations _ the fear that pressing for human rights might
weaken (Mikhail) Gorbachev,'' it said.
   In what the group called ``bright spots,'' it said the Bush
administration ``has begun a welcome break from the policies of its
predecessor'' regarding South Africa by calling for an end to the
state of emergency, the freeing of political prisoners and the
abolition of ``various legislative pillars of apartheid.''
   In Burma, the administration was credited with playing a
constructive role after the 1988 crackdown on a pro-democracy
movement.
   The rights group said it was a ``positive development'' that the
administration did not seek to renew military aid for the Contra
rebels fighting the leftist Nicaragua government.
   However, it said, ``the administration continued past policy of
refusing to condemn Contra abuses.''
   The administration also was criticized for ``largely ignoring
abuses'' in areas that don't attract much U.S. public attention
such as executions by government forces in Sudan, mass expulsions
in Mauritania and the purge of government opponents in Malawi.
   Human Rights Watch is a New York-based group that monitors and
promotes human rights world-wide.

   An 18-foot statue of Paul Bunyan, that
giant lumberjack of lore, and his blue ox, Babe, has become the
center of a controversy of an appropriately grand scale.
   The 8-ton concrete-and-steel work, which has graced the Lake
Bemidji waterfront for more than a half-century, was called
``tacky'' by an art critic in a Dec. 13 column in The Daily
Pioneer. Since then the paper has been deluged with letters for and
against the figures.
   Paul and Babe were built in 1937 by the local Rotary Club with
$200 worth of materials. The labor, at 60 cents an hour, cost
$442.20.
   In the newspaper column, sculptor Kent Nerburn, who holds a
doctorate in theology and art, called the artwork ``the
well-meaning gropings of a group of fine civic-minded men with
plaster, chicken wire and trowels, creating objects for a simpler
time with a simpler vision.''
   ``By featuring the happy trowelings of bygone Rotarians as the
centerpiece of our community, we are building a monument to
ourselves as naive rustics,'' Nerburn wrote.
   ``There's probably been a letter a day ... ever since he wrote
the thing. Some of them are indignant, some are humorous, some are
off-the-wall,'' said Pioneer Managing Editor John Ainley, who
joined the fray by writing a column he described as ``pro-Paul,
pro-Babe.''
   One Nerburn dissenter, Cliff Miller of Lake George, is a logger
who came down the Schoolcraft River with the last log drive into
Bemidji. He said he likes having the statue of Paul and Babe
looking over the lands they might have logged.
   Stuart Desjarlait of Red Lake wrote that Paul and Babe have
overstayed their welcome and called them ``a symbol of destruction
of our forest and wildlife.''
   Nerburn, who directs an oral history project at Red Lake, said
he is surprised by the outpouring of opinion.
   ``I'm hard-pressed to take Paul and Babe seriously as symbols,''
he said. ``I can take them seriously as sculptures because they are
so unbelievably abominable.''

   At last, newspaper consumers who
won't complain about the ink rubbing off on them.
   Officials demonstrated a new use for old newspaper Wednesday by
showing it off as barnyard bedding for animals in the state's
prison agriculture program.
   Cheaper than straw and hay, shredded newsprint is less dusty and
far more absorbent than traditional barnyard materials, Department
of Corrections officials said during a demonstration at Jones Farm.
When mixed with manure, newspapers decompose quickly.
   Surplus newspaper is available at little or no cost and
eliminates the need for the state prison farm system to grow its
own straw and hay, the land for other crops, the officials said.
   The officials also plan to use newspaper shredders at Skillman
Fram and Bayside farm.
   In all, the state farms about 10,000 acres through its prison
agriculture program. The change will mean the three farms can
reduce their waste by about 1.5 tons a day.

<TEXT>
   A Northwest Airlines jetliner dropped one of
its three engines while in flight over northern Florida before
landing safely today, officials said.
   There were no injuries reported aboard the Boeing 727, said
Northwest spokesman Bob Gibbons at the airline's headquarters in
Eagan, Minn.
   ``The plane turned around, landed at Tampa without any problem
at all, 139 customers, and we're working now to book them on other
airlines to move them along,'' Gibbons said.
   Flight 5 took off from Miami shortly after 8 a.m. EST bound
nonstop for Minneapolis-St. Paul, Gibbons said. The plane lost its
No. 3 engine at about 9:35 a.m., said Arlene Salac of the Federal
Aviation Administration's regional office in Atlanta.
   Gibbons said the engine on the right side of the fuselage
dropped off over the Cross City, Fla., area, a sparsely populated
section that includes forests and marshlands west of Gainesville
and southeast of Tallahassee.
   National Transportation Safety Board officials said they asked
the crew for information that could help pinpoint where the engine
landed.
   Boeing officials in Seattle said they would send someone from
their Miami office to assist with the investigation if Northwest
asks for help.
   Tom Cole, spokesman for Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said 727s
are designed so an engine will break away if necessary.
   ``They are designed to fall off in cases of extreme vibration in
order to protect the airplane, so the plane won't be damaged if the
engine breaks apart or so engine won't shake the airplane so hard
it causes a loss of control.''
   All three engines are mounted in the rear of the plane, one in
the tail section and the other two on either side of the fuselage,
Gibbons said.
   The engine separation caused no other structural damage to the
plane, Gibbons said.
   ``There were no problems with control, pressurization or
anything,'' he said. ``It was a routine, two-engine landing, the
kind of thing pilots are trained for all the time.''
   The plane landed at the nearest airport, in Tampa, at 9:58 a.m.
EST, officials said.
   Passengers said they felt something, but didn't know an engine
was missing until after they got on the ground.
   ``There was a little rock and roll but not that much,'' said
Alfred Cortina of Miami, as he awaited another flight at Tampa.
``It was extremely smooth. I was surprised when I got off the plane
and saw that we didn't have a engine.''
   ``I felt a lurch and then a big bump,'' added Sandy Altner of
Winnipeg, Canada. ``It was almost like we ran into something in a
car. The pilot came on about 10 minutes later and said we had lost
the right engine _ he didn't say it fell off.''
   Gibbons said the plane is 14 years old. He said he did not know
when it had last been inspected, but said he was not aware of any
problems with it.
   NTSB investigator Jorge Prellezo said in Miami that the agency
has not yet considered offering a reward for the return of engine
parts, as it did after last year's crash of a jetliner in Sioux
City, Iowa. ``We hope we can find it for free right now,'' he said.
   ``We have to look at what happened and the value of the engine
to our investigation. It doesn't appear this was due to any
catastrophic engine failure,'' he said.
   Boeing delivered the plane to Northwest in December 1975. The
727 model, designed as a short-run carrier but which airlines have
used more for medium-range flights, was put into service in 1964
and discontinued in 1984 after 1,831 had been delivered, Cole said.
   In April 1985 an American Airlines flight from Dallas to San
Diego lost its right-side engine but landed normally and without
any injuries in San Diego.
   A Boeing 737 flown by Piedmont lost an engine on takeoff from
Chicago in January 1989 but turned around and made an uneventful
landing, Cole said.

<HEAD>Some Airlines Adding Fuel Surcharges While Discounting Fares</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 3rd graf to UPDATE with American and Pan Am matching
fare cuts. A longer version moved on financial wire.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   The good news for travelers is that airlines are
cutting fares to lure passengers. But there's bad news: For the
first time since the 1970s oil crisis, some are imposing a
surcharge to cover a jump in fuel prices.
   Trans World Airlines said Wednesday it is adding a surcharge
ranging from $5 to $20 per ticket. TWA spokesman Don Morrison in
St. Louis said the charge represents about 4 percent of an average
ticket price.
   Meanwhile, TWA, Pan Am, American Airlines, United Airlines,
Midway Airlines and USAir said they were matching steep fare cuts
announced Tuesday by Eastern Airlines, but were keeping the usual
cancellation penalties that Eastern eliminated.
   The prospect of weak passenger traffic this year and a slowing
economy may mean more fare discounting. But in many cases, the
savings are reduced by fuel surcharges, which also were announced
by Northwest Airlines.
   For flights of at least 500 miles, the new TWA fuel surcharge
will cost $10 on a one-way ticket and $20 round trip. For less than
500 miles, passengers will pay an extra $5 one way and $10 round
trip.
   Pan Am said it is raising most domestic fares 4 percent to cover
fuel costs. Its Northeast shuttle service, which hiked fares last
week, is excluded. United, the nation's second-largest airline,
also said it is boosting domestic fares 4 percent because of the
fuel price rise.
   Other big carriers, including Eastern, said they were
considering fuel-related increases.
   On Tuesday, Eastern's sister carrier, Continental Airlines, led
the move by raising fares 4 percent to cover fuel costs; Northwest
quickly followed with a one-way surcharge of $6. The changes are
effective Jan. 10.
   Some industry analysts suggested the highly visible fuel
surcharges could be a way of bringing public pressure on the oil
industry to lower prices.
   ``It may be a way of putting some of the heat on (oil)
refiners,'' said Louis Marckesano, an airline analyst at the
Philadelphia brokerage Janney Montgomery Scott Inc.
   Oil prices have surged in recent weeks amid the cold wave and
refinery problems in Texas and Louisiana. Jet fuel, which
represents around 35 percent of an airline's operating budget, has
jumped to nearly $1 a gallon from 64 cents at the end of October.
   The fuel surcharges do not require government approval for
domestic flights, and most of the airlines imposing them said they
have sought permission from foreign governments to apply them to
international flights.
   ``What's happened here, it's a matter of supply and demand,''
said Earl Ross, a spokesman for the American Petroleum Institute,
an industry association in Washington. He would not comment on the
recent demand by several Northeast governors and members of
Congress that federal authorities investigate the possibility of
price fixing.
   Eastern spokesman Robin Matell, in a statement Friday on the
possibility of a fuel surcharge, cited a ``precipitous and
unprecedented increase in fuel prices _ considering there hasn't
been a disruption in supplies.''
   Eastern's fare cuts are designed to lure passengers as the
airline attempts to rebuild after a hobbling strike and bankruptcy
proceeding. But they also show concern shared by all the airlines
about the economy this year, said Raymond Neidl, an analyst at
Dillon, Read &amp; Co. Inc.
   ``Bookings are soft; that's why you're seeing discounts,'' he
said.
   Neidl and other analysts estimate that the airline industry's
total seat capacity will increase 6 percent this year as new jets
are put into service, while passenger traffic will rise only 2
percent to 3 percent.

<HEAD>Publisher Enrico Vallecchi Dies at 87</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FLORENCE, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Book and magazine publisher Enrico
Vallecchi died Thursday in his castle on the outskirts of Florence
at age 87.
   Vallecchi took charge of the family publishing company after
World War II from his father, Attilio, who had founded it.
   The firm published some of the most prominent Italian writers of
the 1930s and 1940s, such as Curzio Malaparte, Aldo Palazzeschi and
Vasco Pratolini. In the postwar years, however, it faced increased
economic difficulties due to growing competition and the lack of a
sales network.
   Vallecchi was forced to sell the company in the early 1960s, and
went on to found a new one and successfully publish magazines on
hunting, fishing, horseback riding and other outdoor activities,
which he loved.
   He never lost interest in his father's venture, and in 1983,
bought back a controlling interest in Vallecchi, becoming chairman
of its board of directors.
   The company has made a slow but steady recovery and still prints
novels and non-fiction.
   Vallecchi is survived by his wife and three children.

   U.S. marshals are throwing mattresses on
the floor for federal prisoners and driving hundreds of miles a day
in a hunt for empty jail beds as authorities grapple with the
Northeast's inmate glut.
   The overcrowding problems were being discussed today at a
``Northeast jail crisis meeting'' that was to continue Friday at
the U.S. Marshals Service headquarters in Alexandria, Va., said
Fran Wermuth, a marshal's service spokeswoman.
   ``This problem is not just in the Northeast area. This group is
meeting, but this problem with jail crowding is fairly typical
across the nation,'' she said.
   The federal prison population has ``not just expanded, it has
exploded,'' said U.S. Marshal Pasquale A. Mangini of Connecticut.
   The Bureau of Prisons said Wednesday a projected doubling of
population in federal prisons during the next five years won't
provide relief.
   Flip Lorenzoni, chief deputy marshal of New York's southern
district, said the two pretrial detention centers near New York
City are full. Women prisoners sometimes have to be driven 500
miles to Alderson, W.Va.
   ``We make that trip about weekly,'' he said.
   Greg Bogdan of the Bureau of Prisons in Washington estimated the
federal prison population nationwide at 54,000 _ a 66 percent
overcrowding rate _ and said that figure was expected to grow to
about 90,000 by 1995.
   He said the problem is especially acute in the East, but a
growing concern elsewhere.
   ``The East and West Coasts, and the Southeast portion of the
country are the areas where we anticipate the biggest growth,''
Bogdan said.
   Chronic overcrowding in Rhode Island's only prison forced the
state Department of Corrections to cancel a contract with federal
officials to keep suspects there. Rhode Island and Massachusetts
have no federal detention center.
   U.S. Marshal Donald Wyatt said Rhode Island marshals at minimum
take a two-hour trip to the federal detention center in Hartford,
Conn. The nearest federal prison is a 3{-hour drive to Danbury,
Conn., a prison with a 514-inmate capacity that has 868 prisoners,
he said.
   Sometimes, deputies are driving to Otisville, N.Y., from
Philadelphia, Rhode Island, Vermont, Maine and Massachusetts.
   ``The ultimate solution is to build federal detention centers
close to courthouses,'' said Wyatt, adding that his office has
spent about $175,000 in overtime and hiring new guards.
   The Defense Department, meanwhile, is reviewing a list of 18
military bases in the Northeast proposed for housing temporary
cells.
   The pretrial population has ballooned because new laws lock up
more prisoners until trial, and other laws eliminate parole and
lengthen sentences for chronic, armed and drug offenders.
   Providence attorney John F. Cicilline, who represents many
federal defendants, said the distances that defense lawyers must
drive to see their clients creates ``a serious constitutional
violation.''
   Rhode Island U.S. Attorney Lincoln C. Almond said the problem of
where to put the prisoners is so acute that occasionally arrests
and indictments have been delayed.
   In Boston last month, six or seven prisoners, including three
reputed Mafia capos, had to sleep on the floor in a holding cell,
which usually houses prisoners only during the day.
   ``If you have a multiple defendant arrest, it's a mind-boggling
experience to find a place to put them,'' Mangini said.
   Bogdan said 10 prison construction projects are in various
stages across the country, and plans to build four more detention
centers and expand some existing facilities were on the drawing
board.
   Nixon said there were a ``multitude of solutions'' to the
overcrowding problem, including building more local jails, building
a federal facility in Massachusetts, or erecting metropolitan
correctional centers, he said.
   Such jailhouses, already in use in New York and Florida, are
easy-to-build temporary housing for prisoners, located close to the
courts.

   A man who told police his pregnant wife was
fatally wounded by a robber as they left a hospital childbirth
class killed himself this morning hours after becoming a suspect in
the slaying, police said.
   The body of Charles Stuart of suburban Reading was pulled from
the harbor shortly before 1 p.m. and positively identified, said
Trooper Barbara Bennett, a State Police spokeswoman.
   Stuart's wife, Carol, was fatally wounded Oct. 23 and their son,
Christopher, delivered prematurely by Caesarean section as his
mother lay dying, survived just 17 days after the widely publicized
shootings.
   ``Basically, it's fair to say, he could not handle the
allegations or statements made about him,'' Suffolk County
Prosecutor Newman Flanagan said, describing a handwritten suicide
note found in Stuart's car.
   Stuart, who spent more than a month in the hospital after being
wounded in the shootings, died after he jumped off Tobin Bridge
into Boston Harbor. It took police divers several hours to find the
body after it was originally spotted in the water by a police
officer and a worker.
   Flanagan said Stuart became a suspect Wednesday after Boston
police and investigators from his office interrogated several
people late into the night. The prosecutor said the dramatic story
Stuart initially told about being attacked by an unknown robber
while leaving the hospital ``is not true.'' He would not elaborate,
or say whether Stuart was one of those who was interrogated.
   Stuart, the 29-year-old manager of a fur store, had told police
that he and his wife, 30, a laywer, were leaving Brigham and
Women's Hospital in Boston after attending a birthing class when an
assailant commandeered their car and forced them to drive into an
adjacent neighborhood, where he robbed and shot them. Mrs. Stuart,
seven months pregnant, was shot in the head, Stuart in the abdomen.
   Though critically wounded, Stuart summoned help on the car
telephone. His frantic 10-minute call to police and the
dispatcher's efforts to determine where the car was were broadcast
nationally and prompted an outpouring of sympathy for Stuart.
   No arrest warrant had been issued prior to Stuart's
disappearance, but Flanagan said, ``I would assume he could very
well have been aware of'' having become a suspect.
   Flanagan would not comment on a report by WNEV-TV that Stuart
became the prime suspect after his brother Matthew went to police
and offered information.
   A man who answered the telephone at Matthew Stuart's suburban
home this morning said the brother was not there and no one in the
family would comment.
   After the news of Stuart's death came out, Mrs. Stuart's father,
Giusto DiMaiti, was rushed to Massachusetts General Hospital with
an undisclosed ailment. The hospital would not discuss his
condition.
   Edward Marchand, chief of police in Charles Stuart's hometown of
Reading, said Stuart's house had been watched by police overnight
after Boston police informed the suburban police that Stuart was a
suspect. But Stuart never returned home.
   Marchand said he believed Stuart was aware his house was being
watched.
   The shootings shocked the city and caused some racial tension;
Stuart had described the attacker as a black man.
   In a note read at Mrs. Stuart's funeral that Stuart had written
in his hospital bed, he said: ``My life will be empty without you.
Now you're taken away from me. I will never know the feeling of
your hand in mine.'' Among the mourners were Gov. Michael Dukakis
and Mayor Raymond Flynn.
   Marchand would not say why Stuart had become a suspect, but he
said ``there's a lot more to the story.''
   Steve Aitkins of the Coast Guard said a wallet and a note were
found in Stuart's car, which was discovered parked on a lower level
of the 300-foot-high, double-decked bridge over Boston Harbor.
   Shortly before Christmas, Stuart viewed a lineup containing an
alleged suspect, but officials and lawyers refused to say whether
an identification was made.
   Asked if a man named in news reports as the alleged suspect,
William Bennett, could still be suspected of being involved in the
shootings, Flanagan said he was no longer a suspect.

<HEAD>Lawyers Argue Over the Fine Line Between Illinois and Kentucky</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FLIPPEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Life on the river and the law of the land
were at odds Thursday as lawyers for Illinois and Kentucky argued
about the border between their two states and control of the Ohio
River.
   Illinois' lawyer told retired New York Court of Appeals Judge
Matthew J. Jasen, appointed a special maser in the case, that an
unbroken line of U.S. Supreme Court precedents supports his state's
claim to a strip of the Ohio River about 100 feet wide.
   But a Kentucky assistant attorney general said Illinois, by
refusing to police the river or exercise any control over it, has
tacitly acknowledged for years that Kentucky owns the entire river,
up to the Illinois shore.
   Illinois fishermen complain that Kentucky authorities have
demanded they buy Kentucky licenses to fish from the Illinois shore.
   After attempts to resolve the fishermen's complaints failed,
Illinois Attorney General Neil Hartigan took the case to the U.S.
Supreme Court in 1986. The high court appointed Jasen, who retired
that year after 18 years on New York State's highest court, to hear
evidence and make a recommendation.
   When Kentucky was admitted to the Union in 1792, its border was
declared to be the low-water mark on the northern shore of the Ohio
River.
   That was fine until 1909, when dams raised the water level.
   Kentucky claimed it should control the river up to the new
low-water mark, while Illinois, Indiana and Ohio said the 1792
boundary should still hold even though the shoreline had moved
beyond it
   John J. Brunsman, an Illinois assistant attorney general, said
the U.S. Supreme Court had settled that argument in favor of Ohio
and Indiana and should do the same for Illinois.
   Rickie L. Pearson, Brunsman's counterpart from Kentucky,
conceded that the precedents were against him but said the high
court, in the Ohio and Indiana cases, had not considered the facts
of life on the river.
   ``Kentucky has patrolled the river. ... There have been no law
enforcement officers from Illinois on the river to do anything,''
Pearson said.
   He cited three incidents that he said bolster his case:
   _Illinois State Police once said they doubted they had
crowd-control jurisdiction over a strike at a waterfront business
in Joppa, Ill., because its pier extended into the river.
   _Firefighters in Golconda, Ill., refused to put out a fire on a
boat grounded 5 to 10 feet from shore because ``the boat was in
Kentucky and it was their problem.''
   _Illinois State Police told a man whose boat had been moored on
the Illinois side of the river to call Kentucky to report it stolen.
   Brunsman responded with examples of his own, including 73
building permits issued by the Illinois Department of
Transportation for structures extending into the river.
   Pearson said the fact that Illinois coroners call their Kentucky
counterparts before issuing death certificates for drowning victims
showed the Illinois coroners knew the river was in Kentucky.
Brunsman said the Kentucky coroners acknowledged Illinois'
jurisdiction by releasing the bodies to that state.
   Jasen asked both lawyers for more detail, ordered a status
report by March 1. He said the high court wants a report in time
for its October session.

<HEAD>Angola Says Pope to Visit In 1991</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LISBON, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II will visit the African
nation of Angola next year, the Angolan state news agency reported
Thursday.
   The report, monitored in Lisbon from the Angolan capital of
Luanda, cited a statement from the Roman Catholic Auxiliary Bishop
of Luanda Pedro Luis saying the Pope had accepted an invitation
from President Jose Eduardo dos Santos.
   There was no immediate confirmation of the visit from the
Vatican.
   Dates for the papal visit have yet to be fixed.
   Relations between the Roman Catholic Church and dos Santos'
Marxist regime had been improving recently, but a statement issued
by the country's Catholic bishops in November angered the
government by calling for negotiations with rebels on free
elections.
   The National Union for the Total Independence of Angola _ the
rebel group _ has been fighting a civil war to share power with the
Luanda government since the country gained independence from
Portugal in 1975.
   An estimated 40 percent of Angola's 9.1 million population are
Roman Catholics.

   Navigation resumed along the entire
Monongahela River on Thursday, three days after at least 61 barges
broke free and crashed downstream, one of them spilling 10,000
gallons of gasoline.
   The Coast Guard reopened the river near the Maxwell Locks and
Dam after searching 11 hours with sonar equipment for sunken
barges. The 20-mile section south of Pittsburgh had been closed to
traffic since the New Year's Day accident, and all but five miles
was reopened Wednesday.
   Six vessels were waiting to clear the Maxwell locks near
Brownsville, 61 miles upstream from Pittsburgh, when clearance came
before dawn. The Coast Guard gave the OK after the sonar failed to
turn up any barges it didn't know about.
   ``We're about normal,'' lockmaster Todd Rankin said at midday.
``There was a little bit of a mad dash when we first opened. Some
boats had been waiting in the landing for us to open up. As soon as
we opened up, they cleared out pretty quickly.''
   The Coast Guard warned operators Dec. 26 that a thaw was
expected by weekend and advised them to make certain their barges
were tied strongly to shore so rushing chunks of ice and high water
would not knock the vessels free. Offenders could be fined up to
$1,000 for each runaway craft.
   The barge that spilled 10,000 gallons of gasoline had been
moored at at Speers, 44 miles upstream from Pittsburgh. The vessel
went over the locks and dam at Charleroi, then hit the Monongahela
Bridge.
   State officials said environmental damage was slight.
   One of the sunken barges remained jammed Thursday beneath one of
the gates at the Maxwell Dam. The vessel was among 37 that were
ripped from their moorings there. Thirty of them sank and piled up
against the dam.
   The Army Corps of Engineers said it would try removing the barge
from the gate this weekend, then try to salvage the other vessels.

   One of Manuel Antonio Noriega's bodyguards
overheard U.S. servicemen discussing the invasion of Panama hours
before it occurred, a Pentagon spokesman said Thursday, but it was
unclear whether the incident enabled the ousted Panamanian leader
to evade the Americans.
   ``There is some evidence that some officials may have had some
advance thought that this operation was about to happen. But there
isn't a lot of evidence that actions were taken as a result of
that,'' Defense Department spokesman Pete Williams told reporters.
   ``A bodyguard, during a debriefing interview, said that two U.S.
soldiers had been overheard discussing their positions for H-hour.
And that supposedly happened at 10 p.m., three hours before the
attack was to begin,'' said Williams. ``I have no other details.''
   Noriega is believed to have escaped from one of his residences
minutes before a U.S. commando unit arrived just after midnight
Dec. 20, and fled from house to house in Panama City in the days
thereafter, according to military officals. Noriega found refuge in
the Vatican Embassy on Dec. 24, and turned himself over to U.S.
officials Wednesday.
   Fighting has all but ceased in Panama, said Williams, and
Pentagon officials were withdrawing some troops and sending new
ones in their place.
   The number of U.S. servicemen in Panama stood at about 25,000,
the same as it was shortly after the invasion, as combat troops
were withdrawn and replaced by military police and civil affairs
specialists, said Williams.
   The spokesman was unable to give a breakdown of the remaining
troops by unit and function, or to say whether or when the number
of troops in Panama would be reduced to the pre-invasion level of
about 12,000.
   The troops are stationed there to guard the Panama Canal under
the terms of bilateral treaty under which the United States is to
turn the waterway over to Panama in the year 2000.
   Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, flew
to Panama today to assess the withdrawal schedule.
   Williams said that four Noriega associates remain inside the
Vatican embassy despite Noriega's decision to surrender.
   He identified the four as: Lt. Col. Nivaldo Madrinan, director
of the Panamanian equivalent of the FBI and CIA; Capt. Asuncion
Gaitan, an escort to Noriega; Carlos Castillo, leader of a
pro-Noreiga political party, and Castillo's wife, Belgica Castillo,
director of immigration.
   In other developments, two U.S. servicemen had been killed and
three others injured in non-combat incidents, said Williams, but he
did not have details.
   The number of American troops killed in action stood at 23, and
the nunmber wounded at 323. All of the combat casualties were men,
he said. Three U.S. civilians were killed and one was injured.
   Among Noreiga's Panama Defense Forces, said Williams, 314 were
killed and 124 were wounded in the fighting.
   Williams also said that U.S. forces had collected 76,553 weapons
in Panama, including 7,743 under a cash-for-guns program that has
cost the U.S. government $691,000.
   Additionally, said Williams, U.S. forces had captured 39 armored
vehicles, 36 aircraft and seven vessels. He was unable to specify
what would become of the armaments.

<HEAD>Keating Relative Says Lawyers Advised Appraisals Not Needed</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A son-in-law in charge of buying and selling
land in Phoenix millionaire Charles H. Keating's now-collapsed real
estate and savings and loan empire said Thursday he was advised by
attorneys he did not need appraisals on the deals.
   Testifying in Keating's suit to overturn a federal takeover last
April of Lincoln Savings and Loan Association, Robert M.
Wurzelbacher Jr. also said he did not investigate the ability of
some buyers of the land to repay loans from the thrift financing
the deals.
   But, he added, ``as far as I know'' the thrift complied with all
state and federal regulations in using Lincoln and its federally
insured deposits to carry out an estimated $1 billion in land,
stock and other transactions between 1984 and 1988.
   Keating and his son, Charles H. Keating III, were scheduled to
testify later Thursday in U.S. District Court here as subpoenaed
government witnesses.
   Citing Fifth Amendment protections against self-incrimination,
the elder Keating refused to answer questions the last time he was
subpoenaed _ a November appearance before the House Banking
Committee.
   As a large political benefactor, Keating is now the centerpiece
of a congressional ethics scandal involving $1.3 million he gave to
five senators who interceded with the regulators on Lincoln's
behalf in 1987.
   In seizing the Irvine, Calif., based Lincoln S&amp;L, federal
regulators have contended that Keating was operating it in an
``unsafe and unsound manner,'' citing as examples the lack of
appraisals and inadequate reviews of borrowers' financial status.
   The regulators now claim that Lincoln's losses of depositors'
federally insured savings in what they call ``sham'' land deals
eventually could cost taxpayers up to $2 billion, making it the
most expensive of nearly 600 S&amp;L failures in the past two years.
   Wurzelbacher, the chief executive officer of Lincoln's real
estate subsidiary and a vice president of its holding company,
American Continental Corp., is married to one of Keating's
daughters.
   He acknowledged in testimony that Keating purchased Lincoln in
1984 to provide a source of cash for large, planned residential
developments that he wanted to build in the Phoenix area.
   ``The bank provided a source of funds to acquire and develop the
properties,'' he said. ``We were able to capitalize subsidiaries
with funds from Lincoln.''
   Wurzelbacher said Lincoln did not review the ability of
borrowers to repay the loans because the thrift would get the land
back through foreclosures if the payments were not made.
   He said he was told in 1985 or 1986 by the thrift's 15-lawyer
legal department that the appraisals were not needed.
   ``We were delighted,'' Wurzelbacher said. ``I knew that it would
elimninate a usually lengthy and cumbersome step in selling real
estate.''
   Government attorneys on Wednesday revealed documents showing
that a real estate attorney hired by Lincoln to review its loan
portfolio in 1987 labeled as ``ridiculous'' a $50 million loan to a
business associate's partnership that listed only $110 in assets,
documents show.
   The attorney, Lois Gordon, called the loan to Phoenix developer
Ernest C. Garcia a ``suspicious transaction'' and warned Lincoln's
executives in a letter in early 1988 that its linkage to other
deals with Garcia ``may cause investigators to seek to uncover
other linked transactions.''
   Miss Gordon testified Wednesday that she was hired by Lincoln
and its owners to review its loan portfolio for weaknesses that
might be objectionable to state and federal regulators.
   She said she found fault with several Lincoln loans she
reviewed, including the absence of property appraisals, financial
statements from borrowers and other normal underwriting
requirements.
   ``A more important concern,'' she said in a Feb. 4, 1988,
confidential letter to American Continental's chief counsel, ``is
the number of loans that may, if reviewed, be found to be unsafe
and unsound and-or inappropriate for a savings and loan
institution.''

pounds) of sugar and it was sold out within an hour,'' she said,
gesturing toward the empty shelves. ``Same with eggs. Ten crates
were sold out in an hour.''
   Similar scenes have been reported in state-run grocery and meat
stores around the nation Thursday as customers stock up before
prices are raised again. Some stores closed because they had
nothing more to sell.
   Prices have been freed as part of a radical economic plan
designed by the Solidarity-led government to end central economic
control and subsidies and, after an initial spurt in prices, halt
the inflation that has plagued the moribund economy.
   Electricity went up 600 percent and the price of gasoline
doubled this week alone.
   Food prices are supposed to rise more gradually _ from 25 to 50
percent a month _ to cushion the shock. Prices increased this week
in stores that received deliveries based on new prices for January,
but others still were selling goods at last year's prices.
   Private and cooperative groceries, which charge higher prices
than state stores, also were crowded.
   ``We're still operating on old prices so people are buying
everything they can get their hands on,'' said Jadwiga Dzierecka,
director of Agricoop No. 1 in Warsaw.
   The Agricoop chain is a cooperative soon to be become a stock
company under economic legislation passed by Parliament last week.
Its stores sell an array of cheeses, fresh produce and imported
foods, including canned shrimp and Italian pasta and olive oil.
   ``Our products are so attractive that people still buy,'' Ms.
Dzierzecka told a reporter between telephone conversations with
suppliers.
   Halina Samsel, co-owner of a vegetable stand in Warsaw's busy
Hala Mirowska market, said she had raised prices but was confident
people would continue to buy.
   She was charging $1.90 a kilo (2.2 pounds) for tomatoes, 17
cents a head for lettuce and 84 cents a kilo for fresh mushrooms.
Average monthly pay in Poland is about $37, or 350,000 zlotys.
   Ms. Samsel said with a smile: ``The prices are shocking.
Customers get upset. They are not used to them, but they buy. There
is no other way out.''
   Jan Kubajek, sales director of a wholesale supply house run by
the state, said Thursday: ``This unrestrained way of introducing
new prices is unacceptable. Retail firms don't have enough money,
so they are delaying payment and we'll have to limit deliveries.''
   Kubajek said his warehouse supplies sugar and flour to more than
half the city. He said enough stocks are on hand for current needs,
but he expects problems later.
   ``Prices for many social groups will be unacceptable,'' he said,
which means sales will decline and many stores may have to close.
   Agriculture Minister Czeslaw Janicki told the newspaper Zycie
Warszawy in an interview published Thursday there would be no
interruption of food supplies.
   ``There are no rational reasons to fear this,'' he said. ``There
are no disturbances in food production.''
   Janicki acknowledged, however, that Poland had to import 300,000
tons of grain in January and that meat reserves had fallen to
65,000 tons, half the nation's monthly consumption.
   Farmers have complained about the rising costs of fuel and
electricity.
   ``The avalanche of price hikes has already started and this is
only the beginning,'' Tadeusz Zablocki, a farmer from the Baltic
coast, told the newspaper Dziennik Ludowy. ``Production costs in
agriculture will increase enormously.''
   Butcher shops often are empty by early afternoon.
   ``There is a real problem with meat,'' Ms. Sasin said. ``It was
the worst holiday season I can remember in years as far as meat and
sausage go.''
   Janicki said he hoped farmers would begin selling their reserves
soon. Many farmers have held products off the market, waiting for
price increases.

<HEAD>Bush Extends Sanctions Against Libya</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush on Thursday extended sanctions
against Libya under national emergency procedures, saying the North
African nation ``continues to use and support international
terrorism.''
   Bush, in a letter to House Speaker Thomas S. Foley and Senate
Majority Leader George Mitchell, said he was continuing the
economic sanctions imposed Jan. 7, 1986, by President Reagan. The
sanctions would have expired Jan. 7 without the executive order to
extend them.
   Bush said the government was utilizing the National Emergencies
Act ``to deal with the unusual and extraordinary threat to the
national security and foreign policy of the United States ... by
the actions and policies of the government of Libya.''
   The sanctions include freezing of Libyan assets in U.S. banks; a
ban on sales of weapons to Libya; a ban on trade; curtailment of
travel by Americans there; a ban on credits or loans to the Libyan
government by U.S. interests; and suspension of contracts relating
to activities in Libya.
   ``The government of Libya continues to use and support
international terrorism, in violation of international law and
minimum standards of human behavior,'' Bush said in his letter to
Foley and Mitchell.
   ``I have determined that it is necessary to maintain in force
the broad authorities necessary to apply economic pressure to the
government of Libya to reduce its ability to support international
terrorism.''
   Relations between the United States and Libya have deteriorated,
especially since December 1985 attacks at the Rome and Vienna
airports that killed 19 people.
   U.S. officials accused Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi of aiding
the terrorists who carried out those attacks.

<HEAD>Finance Minister Says Comecon `Has No Reason to Exist'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ONDREJ HEJMA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The new finance minister said
Thursday there is no reason for the continued existence of Comecon,
the East bloc economic alliance, and he said Czechoslovakia would
quit the organization unless it is overhauled.
   Finance Minister Vaclav Klaus, an outspoken advocate of
free-market reforms, also announced the devaluation of the
Czechoslovak crown by 18.6 percent against Western currencies.
   A Polish newspaper quoted Klaus as saying Czechoslovakia would
propose the dissolution of Comecon when the alliance meets in Sofia
on Tuesday.
   Asked at a news conference whether Czechoslovakia would propose
the alliance be disbanded, Klaus replied: ``Comecon cannot
function, the way it is now and there is no reason for its
existence anymore.''
   ``I don't have to call it dissolution, but if all our proposals
are accepted, it will not be the same organization,'' he said.
   Klaus, 49, who was appointed Finance Minister in
Czechoslovakia's reformist government last month, is a non-party
economist who was forced to serve as a lowly bank clerk for his
beliefs through the 1970s.
   Czechoslovakia will propose the abolition of a whole range of
agreements concluded earlier between Comecon members, Klaus said.
   Those agreements ``are so far binding our hands,'' he said,
adding that if the Czechoslovak proposals are not accepted, ``we
are ready to get out of such commitments unilaterally.''
   Andrej Barcak, the foreign trade minister, said Czechosolvakia
was not able to function within the organization ``on the economic
rules which exist.''
   ``It is quite obvious that from a multilateral point of view we
are not able to form any, kind of fundamentally deep integration
and not many countries are going to even attempt that,'' Klaus said.
   He said most of the bloc's activities would be transformed into
bilateral relations between countries.
   Comecon, which stands for the Council of Mutual Economic
Assistance, was formed under the guidance of the Soviet Union in
1949 and has since controlled trade among Soviet-allied countries.
The member nations are the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, Cuba,
Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Hungary, Mongolia, Poland, Romania,
and Vietnam.
   Dramatic political changes recently in Eastern Europe have
radically decreased the power of Communist rulers and many Comecon
members have begun moving away from centrally planned economies.
   East bloc countries say Comecon's payments framework doesn't
work because it is based on barter, fixed prices and a
non-convertible currency, the Soviet ruble.
   More reform-oriented countries like Czechoslovakia say they need
hard currency to breathe new life into stagnating economies.
   The devaluation of the crown against major currencies means
that, as of Jan. 8, one dollar will buy 17 Czechoslovak crowns,
compared to the current rate of just over 14.
   A new tourist rate will be introduced on Jan. 8 giving the
tourist 38 crowns, up from 9 crowns, for one U.S. dollar, in a bid
to match the current black market rate in hard currencies.
   At the same time, Klaus said the crown would be revalued by 10
percent against the transfer ruble, to encourage exports to Western
countries.
   Referring to the new crown rate for tourists, Klaus said: ``We
know this is not going to destroy the black market completely, but
it should be a serious obstacle.''
   Klaus also said that a currency and rate committee of the
Comecon is to meet in Prague on Jan 16.-18. ``All the things we
cannot settle in Sofia we can take care of then,'' he said.

<HEAD>Opposition Groups Unite Against Communists in Election Drive</HEAD>
<BYLINE>With AM-Romania, Bjt
^By CAROL J. WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Associated Press Writer&equals;
   EAST BERLIN (AP) _ Six fledgling opposition groups put aside
their political differences Thursday and joined forces to compete
in national elections against the dominant Communist Party.
   ``It's certainly clear that if we don't work together we will
fail together,'' said Detlef Poge of New Forum, the largest of the
opposition groups. New Forum has about 200,000 members.
   The coalition, to be called Election Alliance 90, joins New
Forum with the Social Democratic Party, Democratic Awakening,
Democracy Now, the Initiative for Peace and Human Rights, and the
United Left.
   The groups have espoused varying policies since they were formed
after the fall pro-democracy movement, which ended the Communist
Party's monopoly on power and led to the scheduling of elections
May 6.
   The Communist Party has been portraying itself as the defender
of democracy against greedy capitalists and a resurgence of
neo-fascism. Polls show it would attract more voter support than
any single party if elections were held today.
   An anti-fascist rally sponsored by the Communists on Wednesday
drew up to 250,000 people, according to some estimates.
   Steffen Reiche of the Social Democrats said leaflets distributed
at the rally seemed to suggest his party sympathized with the aims
of right-wing radicals.
   Reiche rejected any association of his party with the right and
said the opposition groups have grown to realize their only chance
of overcoming the Communists is as a bloc.
   ``In order to ensure a democratic restructuring of East Germany,
we need an alliance of the opposition,'' he said on West Berlin
television.
   Reunification of East and West Germany is one area where the
opposition parties have differed.
   Leaders of Democracy Now have advocated a gradual reunification
with West Germany, while New Forum and the Social Democrats contend
East German sovereignty must be protected.
   The degree that Western investment should be encouraged to ease
East Germany's economic crisis has also been a matter of dispute
among the opposition forces, as have environmental policies such as
whether nuclear energy should replace brown coal, a heavy pollutant
that fires much of the nation's industry.
   In a late December survey of 800 East German voters conducted by
the Academy of Social Sciences and confirmed by West German
researchers, 34 percent said they would vote for the Communists if
elections were held now.
   The newly independent Christian Democratic Union drew the
second-strongest support with a distant 7.9 percent. The Christian
Democrats had for decades been aligned with and dominated by the
Communists, but they broke away and reorganized last month.
   Five of the six groups in Election Alliance 90 polled support in
the latest survey, but together they got only 14.3 percent support.
   Reformist Premier Hans Modrow is a Communist Party member and
enjoys more public trust than any other figure on the national
scene. The opposition forces contend his government is transitional
and has limited authority to decide how the nation should proceed
with reforms.
   Lech Walesa, leader of Poland's Solidarity movement, met with
some East German opposition leaders Thursday and told them they
need to use more common sense to achieve their goals.
   ``I don't have to remind you that we are taking part in a great
game that only just started. I would not like you to be too
euphoric. ... This is a serious game,'' Walesa said during the
meeting in Gdansk.
   The East Germans at the meeting included Barbel Bohley and Jens
Reich of New Forum, Michael Bartoszek of Dmocracy Now and Wolfgang
Templin of Peace and Human Rights.
   Meanwhile, East Germany said the compulsory term for military
service has been cut from 18 months to 12 months.
   About 25,000 of the army's 170,000 soldiers who have already
served a year or more will be released, National People's Army
spokesman Uwe Hempel told reporters.
   The age range for compulsory service has also been shortened,
from 18 to 23 instead of 18 to 26.

   An organization of black journalists canceled its
national board meeting here because of the suspension of a state
holiday in memory of the late Martin Luther King.
   Directors of the National Association of Black Journalists had
scheduled their quarterly meeting for Jan. 12-14 in Phoenix. The
King holiday was to have been celebrated Jan. 15.
   ``At a considerable cost to NABJ, we have canceled ... because
we cannot in good conscience spend our money and do business in a
state which ... will not commemorate the values of truth, freedom
and justice that the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. so
courageously embodied,'' NABJ President Thomas Morgan said in a
statement.
   Carl Morris, executive director of the organization, said about
40 people had been expected at the meeting. The organization of
print and broadcast journalists has about 1,800 members.
   David Radcliffe, executive director of the Phoenix and Valley of
the Sun Convention and Visitors Bureau, said he had not heard of
other groups canceling visits to Phoenix.
   The holiday, approved by the 1989 Legislature, was suspended
because opponents filed nearly 80,000 signatures calling for a
referendum on repeal.
   Secretary of State Jim Shumway put the observance on hold until
it is determined there are insufficient signatures or until the
election. To force the election in November, 43,350 signatures are
needed.
   The meeting has been rescheduled for Jan. 26-28 at an
undetermined site.

<TEXT>
   Federal marshals guarding the biggest catch of
their careers, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, secured a courthouse
Thursday with two-way radios, metal detectors, binoculars and
weapons.
   Officers were stationed throughout the 10-story federal
courthouse, at all doors and in the streets outside while the
ousted Panamanian leader occupied a basement cell before his
arraignment in a 1988 drug indictment.
   ``Obviously they've increased security,'' said a receptionist
who worked for Daniel Horgan, chief U.S. marshal in Miami. ``But he
won't make any comment.'' The receptionist would not give her name.
   Jose Cepero, a Cuban-American who was picketing outside court
with a sign saying ``U.S. Hands Off Panama,'' was attacked by a
member of a Panamanian exile group.
   His sign was torn to pieces, and he was hit on the head and
shoulders before police and marshals moved in. Cepero, who was led
away for his own protection, was shaken up but had no visible
injuries.
   About 20 marshals, about double the usual number, guarded
barricades at the prisoner entrance to the courthouse, and
pedestrians were forced to walk on the other side of the street.
   Plainclothes marshals equipped with binoculars scanned the
surrounding neighborhood from the roof throughout the day, instead
of the normal twice-daily practice when prisoners are being moved
in and out of the building.
   Hours before Noriega was to reach a ninth-floor courtroom, two
airplanes flew overhead with banners saying ``Bye Bye, Tony'' and
``Rent This Ad When Fidel Falls,'' showing Cuban-American
solidarity with Panamanians.
   Private security officers supplemented the radio-equipped
marshals in the courthouse, and a half-dozen Miami police officers
kept an eye on a growing array of news crews with satellite dishes
and towers sprouting from their vans.
   Two Miami officers patrolled the front courthouse plaza where a
few Panamanian exiles expressed support for the prosecution of
Noriega. One woman wore a T-shirt with the words ``Noriega Enemy
No. 1 of Panama,'' and a man's shirt read ``Democracy for Panama''
in Spanish.
   The U.S. Marshals Service has a self-contained system for moving
defendants in the courthouse outside the public eye. Holding cells
in the basement lead to a private elevator that connects by rear
hallways to courtrooms.
   Each courtroom has an adjoining holding cell so prisoners can
make a court appearance without having any contact with the public.
   The courtroom reserved for the hearing before U.S. District
Judge William Hoeveler has 40 seats, and 30 were reserved for news
media.
   Visitors must pass through a metal detector to enter the
courthouse and submit to a search of bags. No cameras or tape
recorders are allowed in the building _ routine in federal courts.
   Marshals routinely carry sidearms outside the courthouse but
store them before coming in contact with prisoners. Court security
officers carry handguns in courtrooms. The Marshals Service has a
small arsenal of automatic weapons, rifles and shotguns in the
courthouse in case of emergency.
   There was no indication from federal officials where Noriega
would be placed after his court appearance.
   Federal prisoners awaiting trial in Miami are routinely held at
the federal Metropolitan Correctional Center south of Miami, but
some high-profile drug defendants facing trial in Florida, notably
Colombian cocaine kingpin Carlos Lehder Rivas, were transported out
of state for detention.
   Lehder's attorneys became frustrated with federal marshals for
moving their client at irregular intervals without notice from one
maximum-security prison to another, but federal judges did not
restrain the transfers until shortly before trial.

<TEXT>
   Defense Minister Florian Siwicki,
attempting to reform the armed services and cut costs, announced
Thursday that the length of compulsory military service will be
reduced beginning next fall from 24 to 18 months.
   Siwicki, one of four communists serving in the new
Solidarity-led government, said in a television interview that the
armed forces had been reduced by 33,000 soldiers in 1989.
   According to the latest figures from the London-based Institute
for Strategic Studies, the size of the Polish army last year was
394,000.
   Military officials say cost-cutting is one of the reasons for
reducing the armed forces.
   Siwicki, who said the cost of maintaining the army last year was
16 percent lower than in 1988, told viewers Poland was seeking a
smaller, more efficient armed forces and that 50 more army units
would be dissolved shortly.
   The defense ministry said the length of service reductions will
begin with the autumn 1990 class of new conscripts.

<TEXT>
   The discovery of the fossilized bones of a giant
meat-eating dinosaur predating the fearsome tyrannosaurus rex
strengthens the theory that dinosaurs evolved rapidly before
becoming extinct, a scientist said Thursday.
   The bones of an Epanterias were found at the top of the Morrison
Formation deposit, an ancient saline lakebed near Fort Collins, by
a paleontology team from the University of Colorado Museum in
Boulder.
   The discovery a year and a half ago was only the third of an
Epanterias, according to Robert Bakker, a research associate at the
museum, who announced the find Wednesday.
   Bakker identified the giant member of the allosaur family from a
jawbone and parts of the neck and tail vertebrate.
   Bakker said the discover strengthens the theory that dinosaurs
entombed in the Morrison Formation, which dates to 130 million
years ago, and elsewhere in North America evolved rapidly.
   ``On average, the rule is that big animals tend to get bigger
until they go extinct. The incredible size of Epanterias indicates
there was some sort of an evolutionary arms race going on,'' Bakker
said in a telephone interview from Boulder.
   The Epanterias, which weighed about four tons and was 50 feet
long, could have eaten about 40 tons of meat annually, and its
ability to expand its enormous jaws _ much like modern-day snakes _
would have allowed Epanterias to gulp huge bites of prey easily.
   The Morrison Formation, about 50 miles north of Denver, contains
up to six distinct dinosaur fauna from successive time periods,
Bakker said.
   The formation is only about 300 feet deep, he said, ``but every
50 feet or so you have a different species. This one was only in
the last 20 feet and the earlier ones also were short-lived. Things
were really moving at that time.''
   The other two discoveries of Epanterias fossils were in 1877
near Canon City, 80 miles south of Denver, and in 1934 in the
Oklahoma panhandle.
   Epanterias apparently was the last and largest species in the
evolutionary line of allosaurs, carnivorous dinosaurs that walked
on their hind legs, Bakker said.
   Epanterias' great size confused early paleontologists, he said.
The bones of the Canon City specimen were so large they were
initially misidentified as brontosaur bones.
   Bakker speculated the size increase of many dinosaur species
over time may have been due to sexual selection, predation success
or disease resistance.
   He subscribes to the theory that dinosaurs were warm-blooded
like modern birds and that dinosaur mass extinctions about 66
million years ago may have been brought on by extensive migrations
and outbreaks of disease.
   Bakker said he and other researchers will study all three
Epanterias specimens and they hope to assemble a complete model
pieced together from portions of each dinosaur.

<TEXT>
   President Bush was presented Thursday with
recommendations for establishing a privately financed national
volunteerism program.
   ``We're recommending setting up a private-public foundation,''
said New Jersey Gov. Thomas H. Kean, the chairman of the
five-member President's Advisory Committee on The Points of Light
Initiative.
   Although Bush has discussed a $50 million annual budget to get
the initiative moving _ $25 million from the private sector and
another $25 million in public money _ Kean said the foundation
should begin immediately without tax dollars.
   ``Let's get it up first as a private foundation so we can get it
going right away,'' he said.
   The Points of Light Initiative Foundation, which would be
composed of 19 to 25 board members, would seek to instill a desire
for community service in the 50 percent of all Americans who never
have volunteered, Kean said.
   ``I don't think there's a problem out there that can't be helped
by volunteers,'' Kean said. ``That's not to replace what government
should be doing. No matter what government does, it can never be
enough.''
   The program takes its name from the president's inaugural speech
in January 1989, in which he referred to a national volunteer
spirit shining like a thousand points of light.

   Civil rights activists suspended a classroom
boycott by black students Thursday and announced plans to sue the
majority white board that ousted the city's first black school
superintendent.
   One picket was arrested Thursday, the second day of the boycott,
and the number of students taking part in the protest dropped.
   The 6,000-student system's absentee rate dropped to 15 percent
from 25 percent Wednesday, but protest leader Hank Sanders called
the demonstration ``very successful.'' District enrollment is about
70 percent black.
   Sanders, a state senator, said the boycott was being suspended
until Jan. 16, because final exams begin Monday.
   He dismissed critics' charges that keeping students out of
school was only hurting them, saying, ``The boycott is for the
future. We sometimes have to make a sacrifice in the present for
gains in the future.''
   Sanders said he would file suit challenging the 1977 act
creating Selma's majority-white school board, contending it did not
meet the requirements of federal voting rights law.
   Last month, the board refused to renew Superintendent Norward
Roussell's contract, which expires June 30.
   The vote followed an evaluation by board members that accused
the superintendent, who has held the post since 1987, of being
dictatorial and intimidating teachers.
   Roussell has described the evaluation as unfair but opposes the
boycott, saying it had less to do with him or the schools than with
Selma's history of racial unrest, including the violence used on
civil rights marchers in 1965.
   A protester was arrested Thursday after Roussell signed a
warrant for his arrest.
   Ernest J. Swift was arrested while picketing outside an
elementary school attended by his two children. He was charged with
disorderly conduct and harassment and released on $1,000 bail.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Reportedly Accepts Lithuanian Party's Decision to Split</HEAD>

   Lithuanian Communist leaders met Thursday with
Mikhail S. Gorbachev and said the Kremlin leader failed to sway
them from their decision to split from the Soviet Communist Party
and pursue local independence.
   The No. 2 party official in the Baltic republic reported that
Gorbachev vowed not to interfere.
   ``We determined our positions, from which we will not be
moved,'' Romualdas Ozolas, a member of the Lithuanian party's
19-member ruling bureau, told state-run TV in Vilnius, Lithuania's
capital, after he and the rest of the delegation flew home from
Moscow.
   There was no immediate report from the Tass news agency or other
Moscow-based official media on the closed-door talks, which the
Lithuanians said lasted more than five hours.
   Gorbachev has vigorously opposed the Lithuanians' decision two
weeks ago to create an independent party, and the national party's
policy-making Central Committee has directed him to travel to the
republic soon to try to mend the schism.
   The Dec. 21 vote by a congress of Lithuanian Communists to break
with Moscow ran counter to more than seven decades of recognized
local party subservience to the Kremlin. In an atmosphere of
growing restiveness among the Soviet Union's patchwork of ethnic
groups, it could trigger a stampede from central party control
elsewhere in the country.
   After the talks with Gorbachev, party Second Secretary Vladimir
Beriozov told radio and TV in his republic that ``no attempt will
be made to try to stop the process (in Lithuania). Communists want
independence. I think we were understood.''
   Beriozov's comments, like those of Ozolas, were reported to The
Associated Press by TV journalist Eduardas Potashinskas in Vilnius.
   However, Beriozov also noted that the opinion of Gorbachev ``is
not the opinion of the Central Committee.''
   The Soviet party's 250-member Central Committee, which sets
policy and can change the party's leader, reportedly includes
members who advocated taking strong measures against the
separatists.
   The Central Committee held a two-day emergency meeting on the
split. On Dec. 26, it instructed Gorbachev to go to Lithuania to
try to heal the break. Beriozov said Gorbachev will meet with a
variety of people during the visit, which he said was scheduled
Jan. 10-12.
   As Gorbachev and the Lithuanian leaders conferred, the Estonian
party's Central Committee convened to consider following the
example set by their Baltic neighbors by adopting a draft policy
statement favoring independence for Estonia and its Communist
Party, said local journalist Tarmu Tammerk.
   The draft, reportedly opposed by ethnic Russians, is somewhat
vague on whether the party would separate or try to be
``independent'' within the Soviet party, Tammerk said. He said
Estonian media announced a statement had been adopted Thursday
night but gave no details, so it was not clear whether the draft
had been approved as written.
   In remarks reported by Tass, however, Estonian party leader
Vaino Vyalyas pointedly told his Central Committee that the
``Lithuanian Communist Party's path to autonomy cannot serve as a
direct example for reforming the Estonian Communist Party.''
   The Estonians scheduled a special party conference Feb. 9 and a
more formal congress March 23, where a vote could be taken on
creating a separate party, said Tammerk, speaking from Tallinn,
Estonia's capital.
   Gorbachev had summoned the entire bureau of the Lithuanian party
to a meeting in Moscow apparently in hopes of winning a reversal of
the decision to break away. Potashinskas said they were received by
three of the 12 members of the ruling Soviet Politburo: Gorbachev,
party ideology secretary Vadim A. Medvedev and international
affairs specialist Alexander N. Yakovlev. Medvedev and Yakovlev are
regarded as key Gorbachev advisers.
   The Politburo's strongest conservatives, such as Yegor K.
Ligachev, were absent, Potashinskas said.
   Previously, Gorbachev opposed the Lithuanian decision to split
from the national party. But he and other officials have also
indicated the Kremlin would not use force to keep the secessionist
Baltic republics in line.
   ``We are not talking about using force, but we are talking about
clearing the matter up,'' Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I.
Gerasimov said Sunday. On Tuesday, he told the BBC the Kremlin has
``only one tool'' for preventing a breakup of the union: ``It is
dialogue, dialogue and dialogue. The only way is political means.
We have no other choice.''
   In a speech to the party's Central Committee on Dec. 25,
Gorbachev noted that extraordinary measures, such as troops and
tanks, have been used against ``hooligans'' in rioting in
Uzbekistan and the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh in
Azerbaijan.
   ``But in these conditions, when we have the participation of
wide strata of the population, we have tried and are trying to use
political means,'' he said.
   The movement in Lithuania for the independence of both the local
party and the republic is supported by hundreds of thousands of
people.
   Gorbachev went on to denounce party members calling for
traditional ``strong-arm'' methods. Terror, he said, ``is an
ineffective and hopeless means of regulating social life, and in
the final account, a measure of weakness.''
   Some dissenting Communists in Lithuania have formed an alternate
Central Committee that proclaims continuing fealty to Moscow and
the Soviet Communist Party that Gorbachev heads.

   Members of Congress, hailing the surrender of
Manuel Antonio Noriega, said Thursday that the United States must
quickly reduce its military presence in Panama and provide
large-scale economic aid.
   ``The U.S. should now devote its energies to assisting President
Endara and the Panamanian people in establishing an effective, new
democratic government,'' said Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell, D-Maine.
   Mitchell also said American troops should ``return home as soon
as possible.''
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Forces
Committee who spent 36 hours in Panama on an inspection tour,
agreed.
   ``We need the U.S. military presence not only to become less
visible but less present,'' Nunn said Thursday on his return to
Washington, adding that ``hundreds of millions of dollars'' in
international aid will be needed to speed Panama's economic
recovery.
   Early Thursday, a 32-member congressional delegation led by
House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., left on a previously
planned two-day trip to Panama.
   Gephardt said issues to be addressed include how long the
military occupation will last, how much public and private aid is
needed to rebuild the economy, how democratic and social
institutions can be strengthened, and the status of the Panama
Canal.
   Noriega, who surrendered to U.S. officials in Panama City on
Wednesday night after taking refuge in the Vatican Embassy, faces
drug trafficking charges in the United States.
   If convicted of charges cited in the major of two federal
indictments, Noriega could be sentenced to 145 years in prison and
fined more than $1.1 million.
   ``I predict Noriega is going to spend the rest of his life
behind bars,'' said Sen. Alphonse D'Amato, R-N.Y.
   ``Noriega will receive justice in this country, which is more
than he gave the Panamanian people,'' said Senate Minority Leader
Bob Dole, R-Kan.
   Noriega, said Rep. Ike Skelton, D-Mo., is an ``international
snake (that) has finally been put in his cage.''
   Several House and Senate members said the Panamanian army, used
by Noriega as an instrument of dictatorial control, should either
be eliminated or sharply scaled back.
   Nunn said he was told by Panama Canal Co. officials that
Noriega's forces had increased harassment of Panamanaian workers,
causing key employees to leave. He said he was told that the
continued operation of the canal would have been jeopardized had
the harassment continued.
   Nunn said that while a new Panamanian army will be needed to
help defend the canal, it should not be allowed to become an
all-pervasive instrument of control as it was under Noriega.
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations subcommittee on Latin America, said the Panamanian
Defense Force should be abolished and that elections be called as
soon as possible to legitimize the Endara government.
   The Foreign Relations Committee will begin extensive hearings
soon on a substantial aid authorization for Panama to repair war
damage, rejuvenate the economy and build democratic institutions,
he said.
   Many members of Congress said Noriega's arrest represented a
major victory in the war on drugs and the elimination of Panama as
a money-laundering center.
   ``All Americans rejoice that the United States armed forces have
brought this indicted drug-running thug to justice,'' said Sen.
Carl Levin, D-Mich.
   Sen. John F. Kerry, D-Mass., who has conducted a series of
hearings on international drug traffic, said the action against
Noriega ``has very significant impact,'' but warned that Noriega's
arrest ``could wind up being mere fluff in the drug war'' unless
there is emphasis on reducing U.S. demand for drugs.
   A spokesman for former President Reagan said Reagan believes
that the arrest of the former U.S. ally ``will send a clear message
to drug dealers around the world that their behavior will not be
tolerated.''

   NASA began the countdown Thursday
for Monday's launch of space shuttle Columbia on a 10-day satellite
rescue mission.
   The clock began ticking at 4 p.m. when NASA test director Jim
McKnight issued the traditional call to stations at the launch pad
and in the control center. Liftoff is scheduled at 8:10 a.m. Monday
for the first of a record 10 shuttle flights planned in 1990.
   During 10 days in space, the crew of five is to deploy a Navy
communications satellite and track down and retrieve a 21,400-pound
science laboratory the size of a small bus before it falls back to
Earth on Feb. 28.
   The laboratory, which has been orbiting for nearly six years,
will be returned to Earth for a study of its 57 experiments and to
determine what has happened to it during long exposure to space.
   Liftoff had been scheduled to take place before Christmas, but
problems with the launch pad, which recently underwent a $50
million overhaul, forced a postponment. Fourteen hours of ``hold
time'' were added to the countdown to allow NASA to stop and deal
with any problems with launch pad 39A, which has not been used in
four years.
   The astronauts will fly to Cape Canaveral on Friday from their
training base in Houston to prepare for the flight.
   The commander is astronaut Dan Brandenstein. The other crew
members are pilot Jim Wetherbee and mission specialists Bonnie
Dunbar, Marsha Ivins and David Low. Brandenstein and Dunbar have
made shuttle flights, while the others will be on their first trip.

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Heavy snow fell around the Great Lakes on Thursday from a storm
that blew out of the Southwest and across the Plains, and heavy
rain fell across the South.
   The storm carried snow to the central Plains and the upper
Mississippi Valley late Wednesday and early Thursday, with heavy
snow in Nebraska and Iowa.
   A narrow band of heavy snow, with amounts of 5 to 9 inches, fell
across southern Iowa, and southeastern Nebraska got 3 to 8 inches
of snow. Extreme northwestern Missouri got up to 5 inches late
Wednesday in Atchison County.
   The snow then spread across southwestern and east-central
Wisconsin during the morning Thursday, with up to 6 inches in Grant
County. By early afternoon Thursday, snow fell across northern
Lower Michigan.
   Rain and snow developed elsewhere over the Great Lakes.
   Showers and thunderstorms developing ahead of a cold front
produced heavy rain in the lower Mississippi Valley late Wednesday
and during the night.
   Heavier rainfall totals for the 24-hour period up to 7 a.m. EST
included 1.76 inches at Port Arthur, Texas; 1.71 inches at Jackson,
Miss.; 1.52 inches at Fort Polk, La., and 1.46 inches at El Dorado,
Ark.
   During the morning Thursday, showers and thunderstorms produced
heavy rain in the central Gulf Coast region. Heavier totals for the
six hours up to 1 p.m. EST included 1.90 inches at Baton Rouge,
La., and 1.03 inches at McComb, Miss.
   Showers extended northeastward from the central Gulf Coast
region to the middle Atlantic Coast.
   Another cold front produced wet weather in the Pacific Northwest
with heavy rain along the coast of Washington. Quillayute, Wash.,
got 1.93 inches of rain during the 24-hour period up to 7 a.m. EST.
   Showers were scattered from the northern Pacific Coast to the
northern Rockies on Thursday, with snow at some higher elevations.
   Elsewhere, light showers were scattered over the Northeast.
   A new cold front ushered cold air into the north-central part of
the nation and afternoon temperatures were only in the single
digits across northern North Dakota and northwestern Minnesota.
   Overnight temperatures dipped into the 30s in Southern
California and southern Arizona, with freezing temperatures
reported in some agricultural areas of Southern California.
   Thursday's low for the Lower 48 states was 12 degrees below zero
at Craig, Colo.

<TEXT>
   Former President Alberto Lleras Camargo,
whose career as a political leader, journalist and diplomat spanned
50 years, died Thursday of lung cancer. He was 83.
   Lleras Camargo, a member of the ruling Liberal Party, began his
career in the 1930s as a reporter for Bogota's El Liberal and as a
correspondent for the Buenos Aires daily La Prensa.
   He gained influence with Liberal Party leaders, was named
interior minister by President Alfonso Lopez Pumarejo, then
succeeded Lopez when he resigned in a political crisis in 1945.
   Lleras Camargo served one year as president before new elections
brought the opposition Conservative Party to power in 1946.
   In 1947, he was chosen as director of the Panamerican Union,
which became the Organization of American States one year later.
Lleras Camargo became the first secretary-general of the OAS.
   In 1958, he was elected to Colombia's presidency in a landslide
victory and served until 1962. Afterward, he returned to writing
and editing but continued to wield power in the Liberal Party.
   He also founded the Colombian weekly magazine Semana.
   Lleras Camargo is survived by his wife, Berta Puga de Lleras,
and four children.
   He was buried at a Bogota cemetary Thursday in an austere,
private ceremony, attended by his family and President Virgilio
Barco. The government declared three days of national mourning.

   The 12-year-old who picked Gen. Manuel
Noriega to be her pen pal says she stands by the fallen dictator no
matter what.
   ``I don't think he will get a fair trial,'' Sarah York said
Thursday. ``In the first place, everyone believes everything that
was said against him, and then on the news today I heard that they
weren't even going to listen to what he had to say about secrets,
about George Bush and the CIA.''
   Noriega surrendered to U.S. authorities and was brought Thursday
to Miami to face drug trafficking charges.
   Sarah, daughter of a prison guard, began writing to Noriega
following his 1988 indictment in the United States. She visited him
twice _ as his guest in October 1988 and on her own with her father
a year later. On the last trip, Noriega lauded her as a
``meritorious daughter'' of Panama.
   She said she sent Noriega an embroidered bookmark for Christmas.
   Her parents, Pauline and Mitchell York, have been criticized for
encouraging their daughter's friendship with a man the United
States was trying so hard to oust.
   Sarah has steadfastly described Noriega as nice and trustworthy.
   York is writing a book about her friendship with Noriega, with a
title President Bush might recognize. ``It's about me and General
Noriega,'' York said. ``It's going to be called, `The General I
Know: A Kinder, Gentler Noriega.'''

<HEAD>Report Says Government to Open New Holding House for Boat People</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new holding center for Vietnamese boat people
is being built in a restricted area, newspapers reported Thursday,
and they suggested the new site was selected in part to prevent
eyewitness accounts of further forced repatriations.
   The newspapers identified the new holding center as San Uk Ling,
which is in an area of the rural New Territories that requires
special permission to enter.
   On Dec. 12, 51 Vietnamese were forcibly repatriated from the
British colony by security forces who entered the Phoenix House
detention center before dawn.
   Reporters outside Phoenix House could hear Vietnamese scream for
help and could see a handwritten sign that read: ``Where is your
humanity?''
   Photographs of the Vietnamese pleading for help through the
barred windows of the detention center were printed in newspapers
around the world, embarrassing the Hong Kong government.
   A government spokesman refused to comment directly on the news
reports about the new holding center, which appeared in The Hong
Kong Standard and the South China Morning Post, but referred
reporters to an official statement Wednesday that said: ``The
government continues to look for additional sites which could be
used for Vietnamese boat people. San Uk Ling is being considered
for this purpose and minor works are being carried out there.''
   About 44,000 Vietnamese who sailed into this British colony
after mid-June 1988 are in squalid detention centers and face
repatriation unless they can prove they face persecution in their
Communist homeland.
   The government considers the vast majority of the boat people to
be illegal immigrants who fled to Hong Kong to seek a better
economic life.
   Hong Kong media have speculated that the next forced
repatriation will take place later this month.

   A former Politburo member and
Prague Communist Party chief was hospitalized in a psychiatric
clinic Thursday after being found shot in the head beside a burning
barn, the state news agency CTK reported.
   Antonin Kapek, who supported the Soviet intervention in
Czechoslovakia during the 1968 Prague Spring movement, was found
outside a country house at Hlohovice, a Bohemian town west of
Prague, CTK said.
   The agency said investigators recovered a 9mm pistol and one
spent cartridge near Kapek.
   CTK said there was no indication anyone else had been involved
in the shooting.
   Kapek, dismissed from the Politburo and as Prague party boss in
1988, was reported out of danger but was expected to remain in the
Plzen psychiatric clinic for several days' evaluation, the agency
reported.
   Several former Communist leaders who opposed the reforms of
Alexander Dubcek in the 1968 reform movement, including former
President Gustav Husak, have been publicly disgraced since
pro-democracy demonstrators this fall forced the Communists to give
up their monopoly on power and form a coalition government. Dubcek
now heads the new Parliament.
   Kapek's successor as Prague party chief, Miroslav Stepan, is
under arrest and faces charges of abusing power in police
crackdowns on demonstrators in Prague during 1988 and 1989.

   Park rangers Thursday
searched for a coyote that mauled a cross-country skier in the
worst such attack in at least a decade.
   Brian Dean, 27, of Oak Lawn, Ill., was listed in good condition
at Bozeman Deaconess Hospital in Montana, where he treated for cuts
and puncture wounds to his head, neck and arms. Doctors were
deciding whether to treat him for rabies.
   The attack was the boldest in a series of aggressive acts by
coyotes in recent weeks, said Yellowstone spokeswoman Joan Anzelmo.
   ``We have not had anything this severe in a very long time. ...
There have been no severe attacks during the 1980s,'' Anzelmo said.
   ``Each year we have `beggar coyotes' that have been fed and
approach people occasionally, and attack them, to a lesser degree
than this attack.''
   Dean, who works for a park concessionaire, was skiing Wednesday
when he saw the coyote lying on the trail in front of him, the
spokeswoman said. Anzelmo said the animal attacked Dean before he
had a chance to stop or go around it.
   Dean beat the animal with a ski and was able to ski to a nearby
road, where a snowmobiler gave him a ride to the Old Faithful
geyser complex.
   ``If it is found it will be destroyed and taken to the Fish and
Wildlife lab in Bozeman for analysis and tests,'' said Anzelmo.
   Late Wednesday night rangers came across two coyotes near Old
Faithful that had been seen repeatedly approaching people for food.
Because the animals had lost their fear of man, the rangers shot
and killed them, said Anzelmo.

   A federal judge entered an innocent plea for Manuel
Noriega after the fallen dictator refused at his arraignment on
drug trafficking charges to acknowledge the United States has a
right to try him.
   ``General Noriega refuses to submit to the jurisdiction of this
court ... because he is a political prisoner brought to this
country illegally,'' Noriega attorney Frank Rubino told U.S.
District Judge William Hoeveler. The judge then entered the plea.
   Noriega, who defied two U.S. presidents until he was toppled by
the Dec. 20 American invasion, was flown to Homestead Air Force
Base, 25 miles south of Miami, after surrendering to U.S. troops
outside his Vatican Embassy refuge in Panama City.
   Rubino had indicated the defense might begin with the theory
argued earlier that Noriega is immune from prosecution in the
United States as a former head of state.
   Noriega's attorney Steven Kollin earlier had discussed plans for
an innocent plea and the initial stages of a defense.
   ``We're going to request certain pretrial discovery requests
including certain sensitive documents, and these sensitive
documents will get to the truth of the matter,'' Kollin said. ``I
believe he will be found not guilty if we can find a jury of 12
people after this unparalleled pretrial publicity.''
   The archbishop of Panama, Marcos McGrath, said today that
Noriega decided to give up after realizing that even his long-time
supporters had turned against him and he was cornered.
   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, in television interviews from
Washington, explained the surrender by saying on CBS: ``I think he
saw the handwriting on the wall.'' He said prosecutors have a
strong case against Noriega, adding on NBC, ``If we can make it
better, we won't hesitate to do so.''
   Security officials speaking on condition of anonymity told The
Associated Press that Noriega had been detained at the courthouse.
   Noriega, who left Panama in his general's uniform, was wearing a
khaki open-neck shirt and dark trousers as he awaited the
proceedings, a federal worker said.
   The U.S. Marshals Service has holding cells in the courthouse
basement and a private elevator. Each courtroom in the 10-story
building has an adjoining holding cell so prisoners can make a
court appearance without being seen or having any contact with the
public en route.
   Noriega was greeted at the Florida base by Panamanian exiles,
Cuban-Americans and others cheering his downfall. Some of the
celebrants moved their party before dawn to the courthouse where
authorities briefly sealed off adjacent streets.
   Streets were reopened as the demonstration broke up, but about
150 to 200 people, many from the news media, remained outside this
morning.
   Panamanians celebrated in the streets as he left the country he
has dominated since 1983 as military leader, and Panamanian exiles
cheered in the cool night air outside the air base where a C-130
carrying him landed at 2:45 a.m.
   ``I wanted my children to see the reason people in Panama have
been suffering,'' said 33-year-old Manuel Arana, who brought his
two young daughters to Homestead. ``To me, this is as important as
the Berlin Wall coming down.''
   Maj. Bob Barca of the Air Force said Noriega departed the base
at 2:51 a.m., but he would not disclose where Noriega was taken.
   Word of Noriega's departure from Panama late Wednesday triggered
celebrations across Panama City. People banged pots and pans and
kissed U.S. soldiers. Fireworks lighted the sky around the Vatican
mission. Youngsters raced up and down streets waving Panamanian and
U.S. flags.
   ``We are relieved to be rid of this criminal,'' Panamanian
President Guillermo Endara said in a statement broadcast on
national television. ``The people feel a sense of peace knowing
that the monster is leaving our land.''
   In Washington, President Bush said Noriega, who had taken refuge
in the embassy on Christmas Eve, turned himself over to U.S.
authorities voluntarily and ``with the full knowledge'' of the
Panamanian government.
   ``It seems that the Vatican officials basically stressed to
Noriega that his only viable strategy was to give himself up,''
said a U.S. official in Washington, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
   Bush said in his nationwide address that he is committed to
giving Noriega a fair trial.
   The United States agreed to three conditions set by Noriega:
that he be allowed to make some phone calls, that his decision be
kept secret until the actual time of his arrest, and that he be
permitted to wear his uniform, administration officials said.
   Although Gen. Maxwell Thurman, the commanding general of U.S.
forces in Panama, said there were ``no deals here,'' administration
officials said the United States had also promised Noriega he would
not be prosecuted under a new federal law allowing the death
penalty for ``drug kingpins.''
   The assurances were relayed to Noriega through Vatican
officials. The United States did not directly deal with Noriega,
the sources said.
   Thurman said Noriega ``looked vigorous, looked confident'' as he
walked out of the compound with the papal nuncio, Monsignor
Sebastian Laboa.
   Thurman said Noriega's surrender ``completes the fourth of our
four objectives'' in invading Panama. The others, he said, were to
protect American lives, safeguard the integrity of the Panama Canal
treaties and restore democracy to Panama.
   According to authorities, about 290 Panamanian soldiers, 300
civilians, 23 U.S. troops and three American civilians died in the
invasion.
   If convicted, Noriega faces up to 145 years in prison and fined
$1.1 million. He faces similar federal charges in Tampa.
   A roadblock to prosecuting Noriega is his right to demand
classified information stemming from his past cooperation with the
Central Intelligence Agency, legal experts have said.
   Noriega reportedly worked closely with the CIA and the Pentagon
while he served as the head of Panama's military intelligence
service and after he became commander in chief.
   But the fact he was on U.S. soil brought hope to Panamanians who
had lived under Noriega's regime.
   Among those waiting outside Homestead's main gates early today
was Adela Giroldi, whose husband, Moises, was executed after
leading a failed coup against Noriega last October.
   ``This is a great day,'' said Mrs. Giroldi. ``I never thought
I'd see Noriega being brought to justice in this way. ... This is a
day all Panamanians celebrate.''

   The Soviet Union has promised Romania
extensive aid, a senior leader said Thursday, including fuel to
provide the winter warmth Nicolae Ceausescu allowed only himself
and his acolytes.
   Foreign policy official Silviu Brucan said Romania expects much
from talks with Eduard A. Shevardnadze, the Soviet foreign
minister, who arrives Saturday on the first visit by a ranking
Kremlin official since Ceausescu was overthrown Dec. 22 and
executed three days later.
   Eastern Europe's democratic tide has pulled other former
satellites away from the Soviet Union, but the Romanian revolt
appears to have improved relations with Moscow. Ceausescu often
went his own way on trade and foreign policy, and had resisted the
reform promoted by Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Brucan told a news conference the Communist Party had collapsed
and that the National Salvation Front now running the country hopes
to publish a new law in late January providing for free elections.
   He denied reports of an advance plan to oust Ceausescu and said
the front's current leaders ``first met'' on Dec. 22 after an
uprising of students and workers, supported by the army, had forced
Ceausescu out.
   The Front will enter candidates in the elections, expected in
April, and ``take part with all its might,'' said Brucan, a
73-year-old former diplomat dismissed by Ceausescu in 1966.
   A half-dozen independent parties formed since the downfall of
Ceausescu, who ruled Romania for 24 years, argue for a delay in
elections. They say holding them so soon will give candidates of
the Front an unfair advantage.
   Brucan said the Front originally wanted elections in July or
August, but chose April at the request of students who led the
uprising against Ceausescu.
   ``From the Soviet Union, we expect massive assistance,'' said
Brucan, who told British television Wednesday he had received
reluctant backing for a revolt against Ceausescu when he discussed
the possibility with Soviet policymakers on a visit to Moscow in
late 1988.
   ``We have been promised from the top in Moscow that we will
receive aid in oil and natural gas to help us overcome this
difficult winter,'' he said.
   The Soviet Union traditionally been a major energy supplier to
Romania. In recent years, Ceausescu paid for the fuel with food and
used it for industrial projects while ordering severe energy
rationing in frigid, dark homes and offices.
   His restrictions on heat and light have been lifted, enabling
Romanians to enjoy those basic comforts for the first time in eight
winters. The new leaders also have said all Romanians will be able
to travel freely.
   Brucan said the Communist Party, which had nearly 4 million
members in a nation of 23 million, would not be a contender in the
elections.
   ``The Communist Party is finished, terminated, because it never
dissocated itself from Ceausescu,'' said the former ambassador to
the United States and United Nations. He had spoken out against
Ceausescu the past two years and now oversees foreign policy for
the National Salvation Front.
   ``Moscow is interested in knowing what is going on in Romania
because the revolution here was unique and because the Communist
Party vanished from the scene,'' Brucan said.
   He did not say whether Shevardnadze's visit would include
discussion of Soviet Moldavia, which consists largely of territory
annexed by the Soviets from Romania in 1940 under a secret protocol
to the Hitler-Stalin Pact. Soviet Embassy sources said the issue
probably would be raised.
   Moldavians speak the same language as Romanians and want more
independence from the Kremlin, which has caused speculation they
may seek eventual reunification with Romania.
   Gorbachev telephoned Romania's interim president, Ion Iliesci,
an acquaintance of many years, to express good wishes. The call was
prominently reported in Romania's new ``free'' press, which is
controlled by the National Salvation Front.
   Public rallies were legalized Thursday and the leadership said
the schools would drop compulsory social and political sciences
intended to inculcate admiration of Ceausescu, replacing them with
lessons in democracy.
   Only rallies in support of Ceausescu were allowed while he ran
the country. The new decree, signed by Iliescu, requires 48 hours
notice of a demonstration.

   The Medellin cocaine cartel kidnapped
the son of President Virgilio Barco's closest adviser in
retaliation for the government crackdown on drug lords, a police
spokeswoman said Thursday.
   An official of the secret police, Maj. Alberto Gomez, said a
group of men abducted Alvaro Diego Montoya as he was leaving the
northern Bogota offices of his financial company on Dec. 20.
   Montoya is the son of German Montoya, Barco's secretary-general
and his closest adviser.
   ``Evidence indicates the Medellin cartel is behind the
kidnapping,'' Gomez said in an interview. He refused to give
details of the case.
   The Bogota newspaper El Tiempo, citing sources at the
presidential palace, said Medellin cartel leader Pablo Escobar
ordered the abduction in retaliation for the government's antidrug
offensive, which began after traffickers assassinated a leading
presidential candidate on Aug. 18.
   A spokeswoman for the investigative unit of the national police
said by telephone that Escobar ordered the kidnapping. She gave no
details and spoke on condition she not be identified.
   Neither the woman nor Gomez could confirm a report in El Tiempo
that the Medellin group has kidnapped 18 people the last three
weeks, many of them members of Colombia's richest families.
   El Tiempo did not say how authorities established that
traffickers, instead of leftist guerrillas, were responsible for
the kidnappings.
   Leftist rebels have abducted scores of political leaders,
wealthy farmers and other Colombians in recent years. The
guerrillas often either exchange the victims for hefty ransoms or
use the victims to carry messages to the government.
   Another Bogota paper, La Prensa, also citing presidential palace
versions, said as Montoya was leaving the offices of his financial
services company, Probolsa, an undetermined number of men forced
him into a car and drove away.
   Montoya's family kept the kidnapping secret in an effort to gain
his release, La Prensa said.
   The newspaper said traffickers were apparently holding Montoya
in an effort to force the government to negotiate with them.
   The Extraditables, a shadowy terrorist group linked to the
Medellin cartel, has repeatedly demanded negotiations. The group
has said traffickers are willing to lay down their arms and abandon
the cocaine business in exchange for a government amnesty for past
crimes.
   Barco has rejected such proposals.
   Since August, the government has seized millions of dollars in
property allegedly belonging to Escobar and other drug chiefs, and
it has extradited 11 drug suspects to the United States to face
charges.
   Authorities blame the drug barons for 261 terrorist attacks that
have killed 209 people since the crackdown began.
   El Tiempo said Escobar may have ordered Montoya's kidnapping
with the intention of demanding a huge ransom. It quoted a
presidential source as saying the crackdown has disrupted Escobar's
cocaine business and hurt his cash flow.
   ``Although it is hard to believe, the cartel is confronting a
liquidity problem,'' El Tiempo quoted the unidentified source as
saying.
   Police have concentrated on finding Escobar since his close
associate, Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, was slain in a gunbattle with
police on Dec. 15.

   Turner Broadcasting System said Thursday it
had won its battle with the Bush administration over providing
Cable News Network and a satellite receiving station to Vietnam.
   The Atlanta-based Turner said the Commerce and Treasury
departments, which had refused Turner's request on grounds the deal
would violate a strict U.S. trade embargo against Vietnam, finally
agreed Thursday to allow the company to deliver its 24-hour cable
TV news channel to Vietnamese Television.
   In return, Turner will drop a lawsuit it filed last week in U.S.
District Court against the Treasury, Commerce and State departments
seeking an injunction to overturn the government's refusal, said
Bert Carp, Turner's vice president for government relations.
   Turner had said it would provide the earth receiving station at
no charge and the CNN signal for the price of 50 Vietnamese dong a
year, which is less than one U.S. penny.
   But the administration, in agreeing to the deal, said Turner
will not be allowed to collect any payment, according to an
administration official who spoke only on the condition of
anonymity.
   The administration official said that in making its decision,
the government considered ``the importance of having U.S. news
programs in Vietnam.'' At the same time, the administration stuck
to its guns over ``strictly prohibiting'' any money changing hands,
the official said.
   Treasury Department spokesman Larry Batdorf said he would have
no immediate comment.
   Congress had amended the trade embargo in 1988 to exempt
information materials from trade sanctions. The administration had
interpreted that to mean physical materials such as books and
videocassettes could be exchanged with Vietnam, but not
``immaterial'' commodities, including TV signals.
   Vietnam already provides videocassettes to Turner for ``CNN
World Report,'' Carp said.
   Carp, in a prepared statement, said the company was ``pleased
the departments of Treasury and Commerce today approved our
requests for licenses to provide CNN, along with a satellite dish,
to Vietnamese Television.''
   He said Vietnam will become the 86th country to receive CNN
International.

   The government of Communist Premier Hans
Modrow said Thursday it wants to reconstitute an intelligence
service to combat a reported rise in ultrarightist activity.
   The pro-reform movement has insisted that no state security
force be authorized until a new government is seated after May 6
elections.
   Government spokesman Wolfgang Meyer told a news conference the
Cabinet reviewed recent incidents of vandalism and violence and
determined that a dangerous situation was taking shape.
   Meyer said failure to move swiftly ``to investigate the rightist
tendencies would cause an irrecoverable delay.'' He said Modrow
plans to provide ``a very important clarification'' to Parliament
next week on the need for a state security service.
   On Wednesday, a mass march was held in East Berlin's Treptow
district to protest recent vandalism by neo-Nazis, including
desecration of a Treptow monument to Soviet soldiers. The official
ADN news agency said the march drew 250,000 people. Witnesses
called that figure inflated.
   ADN reported numerous instances in the past two weeks of
vandalism and confrontations involving right-wing extremists.
   Opposition groups say the Communists are playing up the neo-Nazi
issue to gain support for the party prior to elections.
   The gravoid charges from
congressional Democrats that President Bush was violating his
no-new-taxes pledge, the official said.
   The proposal would have imposed new taxes on paper, glass,
plastic and metals that were not recycled. The Environmental
Protection Agency, which favored the tax concept as a way of
encouraging greater use of recycled materials by U.S. industry,
wants to reduce the nation's output of waste by 25 percent by 1992.
   Bush, as part of his 1988 presidential campaign, promised to
``make a national commitment to reduce waste by recycling and
developing technology that produces less waste.''
   By making products made from virgin materials more expensive,
supporters of the tax had argued it would encourage businesses to
use more recycled materials.
   Another revenue raiser rejected by the administration in recent
days would have imposed a sales tax on off-road vehicles, camping
equipment, motor homes and pleasure boats.
   Supporters of that rejected proposal wanted to have the new
revenue earmarked for specific recreation and conservation programs
on federal lands, but it, too, fell victim to Darman's concern that
critics would charge the president with violating his pledge
against new taxes.
   The various decisions on spending and taxes are being made as
the administration puts the finishing touches on a proposed $1.23
trillion budget for the fiscal year beginning next October. The
budget will be sent to Congress on Jan. 29.

   The arrival of U.S.-ousted Panamanian leader Gen.
Manuel Antonio Noriega to face federal drug charges was the
crowning achievement of stepped-up U.S. efforts to bring key Latin
drug figures to this country.
   Removing drug suspects from their homelands by force has drawn
criticism in the foreign countries, threats of retribution by
traffickers, and concern from some American defense attorneys.
   However, prosecutors and President Bush have hailed the
cooperation of other nations.
   Noriega's apprehension ``should send a clear signal that the
United States is serious in its determination that those charged
with promoting the distribution of drugs cannot escape the scrutiny
of justice,'' Bush told the nation Wednesday night.
   The arrests of leading figures have had little effect on the
flow of drugs, said Broward County Sheriff Nick Navarro, but they
make life more difficult for traffickers and hearten U.S. drug
fighters.
   ``I think it is important for all of us engaged in this effort
to see that some of the people who have been getting away with so
much for so long are being neutralized,'' said Navarro, leader of a
statewide anti-drug task force and of a department known for
cocaine sting operations.
   Since the Colombian government began a new crackdown on drug
dealers last August, 11 fugitives have been brought to the United
States to face charges. They include Eduardo Martinez Romero,
reputed financial wizard for the Medellin cocaine cartel, being
held at the federal penitentiary in Atlanta. No trial date has been
set.
   Last month, the Bolivian government arrested former Interior
Minister Luis Arce Gomez, dubbed the ``minister of cocaine,'' and
turned him over to U.S. authorities on 1983 drug-trafficking
indictments. Arce Gomez is being held without bond south of here.
   Some Bolivian opposition politicians criticized the extradition
of Arce Gomez from the country. Colombian traffickers, blamed for
some 200 deaths and hundreds of woundings in the past year in
Colombia, have vowed revenge for extraditions and security has been
increased for U.S. officials from President Bush to Miami Mayor
Xavier Suarez because of alleged assassination plots.
   A Miami attorney who's a veteran of drug cases said Thursday
that Noriega's overthrow highlights a trend toward questionable
actions abroad in the war on drugs.
   ``I am troubled as a criminal defense lawyer about sending
troops in a high-fashioned posse to secure someone who's alleged to
be a fugitive,'' said Joel Hirschhorn.
   ``It's scary. It's as if the rule of law has been abandoned in
quest of solving a major problem. Even though it's our government
that's doing it and it's for a very lofty reason, that doesn't make
it right,'' he said.
   ``When we look back in the year 2000, I'm afraid we're going to
have a wasteland of constitutional rights,'' Hirschhorn said.
   However, he and other attorneys said that while Noriega's
attorneys may challenge the way he got here, similar cases have
stood up in the courts before.
   ``There is no formal extradition involved here and the case law
is that the court will not look to the circumstances by which the
person was brought to the United States, unless those circumstances
shock the conscience,'' said Robert W. Merkle, who was U.S.
Attorney in Tampa when Noriega was indicted there in 1988.
   Merkle, who is in a private law practice, successfully
prosecuted Colombian cocaine kingpin Carlos Lehder Rivas, taken to
the United States on Feb. 4, 1987, after a shootout at a jungle
hideout near Medellin, Colombia.
   Lehder, 40, was convicted of conspiracy, cocaine importation,
operating a continuing criminal enterprise and eight counts of
possession of cocaine with intent to distribute. He was sentenced
in July 1988 to life in prison without the possibility of parole,
plus 135 years, and is being held in federal prison in Marion, Ill.
   Lehder Rivas was considered a leader of the Medellin Cartel, as
was Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, killed last month by Colombian police
in a shootout at a ranch owned by Pablo Escobar, a reputed kingpin
still being pursued by Colombian authorities.

   Harold ``Doc'' Edgerton, a pioneer in
strobe and underwater photography and a professor emeritus at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, died of a heart attack
Thursday. He was 86.
   Edgerton died at Massachusetts General Hospital after suffering
a heart attack at the MIT faculty club, where he was having lunch,
MIT said.
   The achievements of Edgerton, a much loved professor, spanned
history.
   Edgerton's revolutionary work in the use of strobe lights
captured images long hidden to the naked eye. His famous
photographs of a drop of milk splashing on a tabletop and of a
bullet shooting through an apple showed the world what time looks
like when it stands still.
   Edgerton's strobe lamps enabled the Allies to track enemy
movements at night during World War II. His strobes were used to
photograph the first atomic tests. His work in sonar helped locate
underwater wrecks and was used by undersea explorer Jacques
Cousteau.
   ``If it comes, it comes,'' Edgerton once said of his ideas and
inventions. ``It'll come by inspiration and God almighty and hit
you right in the middle of the night.''
   Edgerton, a native of Nebraska, had been at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology since 1926, when he started as a student in
electrical engineering. Officially retired from MIT in 1968, he
lived in an apartment next to the campus and still came into his
office five days a week.
   ``I got stuck,'' he said. ``But it's given me a very nice place
to work.''
   Most weekdays, Edgerton could be found in his laboratory at MIT,
just off MIT's ``Strobe Alley,'' where his work is displayed.
   In addition to his inventions, Edgerton and two former students
started a company called EG&amp;G in 1947 specializing in electronic
technology. Now a multi-million dollar engineering concern, the
company was under contract to the military and designed and
operated systems that timed and fired U.S. nuclear bomb tests.
   At a recent meeting of the Archaeological Society of America,
Edgerton offered words of advice to a group gathered to honor his
life's achievements.
   ``Work like hell, tell everyone everything you know, close a
deal with a handshake, and have fun,'' Edgerton told the society's
members.
   He was awarded a national medal of technology by President
Reagan in 1988. Undersea explorer Jacques Cousteau, who used some
of Edgerton's sonar equipment and the two collaborated in locating
the British Army ship, the HMS Britannia which was sunk by a mine
off the Greek coast during World War I. Cousteau nicknamed Edgerton
``Papa Flash.''
   Edgerton's influence even penetrated to the depths of the
Titanic. His Edgerton-Benthos underwater camera was used to
photograph the shipwreck when it was discovered in 1986.
   He is survived by his wife of 62 years, Esther, a daughter and a
son.

   The estranged husband of President
Bush's daughter was found guilty Thursday of drunken driving, fined
$1,285, and prohibited from driving in Massachusetts for one year,
a court clerk said.
   At a pre-trial conference in Framingham District Court, William
H. LeBlond changed his plea from innocent to guilty to a charge of
operating under the influence of alcohol, said court clerk Anthony
Colonna.
   A charge of possession of marijuana was continued without a

   LeBlond, 32, of Cape Elizabeth, Maine, was stopped by police
Nov. 10, 1989, when a pick-up he was driving in Maynard was
reported weaving, court records showed.
   LeBlond, a contractor, is separated from his wife, Dorothy Bush
LeBlond. They have two children.

   Soldiers with acetylene torches cut
into crushed railroad cars searching for victims of Pakistan's
worst train wreck, which officials said killed at least 210 people
Thursday and injured 700.
   Television showed rows of bodies wrapped in blankets near the
wreckage of an overcrowded 16-car passenger train that was switched
onto the wrong track early Thursday and struck a freight standing
in a village station.
   The locomotive was overturned and several cars were crushed or
ripped open. Bodies, baggage and debris were strewn near the
wreckage.
   Officials at the scene said 210 people were known dead and
Pakistan Railways said rescuers had recovered 165 bodies. The
engineer of the passenger train survived.
   The passenger train Zakaria Bahauddin, named for a Moslem saint,
was on a 500-mile overnight run south from Multan to Karachi with
many more passengers than its 1,408-seat capacity, said Muktar
Ahmad Abassi, regional traffic officer for Pakistan Railways at
Sukkur, 225 miles north of Karachi.
   When it approached Sangi village in Sindh province, which it was
supposed to bypass, an improperly set switch threw it onto a siding
where an empty 67-car freight train was standing, he said.
   Abassi said the passenger train was traveling at least 35 mph
when it hit the freight, and the result was ``the worst rail
accident in Pakistan's history.''
   The first three cars, built to hold 88 passengers each, were
devastated and the next two were badly damaged, Abassi said. The
remaining cars stayed on the track and later were hauled to Karachi.
   Most of the dead were in the first three cars and many
passengers in the next two were seriously injured, officials said.
   Medical workers said hundreds of people went to Sangi and Sukkur
to donate blood in response to an appeal on Pakistan radio.
   Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto expressed ``her deep sense of
shock and grief,'' said a statement reported by the official
Associated Press of Pakistan.
   ``The prime minister offered her heartfelt sympathies to the
bereaved families,'' it said. ``She prayed to almighty Allah to

   Ms. Bhutto dispatched her railway minister and other authorities
to the scene to start an investigation, the agency reported.
   Hazul Baksh, a municipal official in Sukkur, said some of the
injured were taken by helicopter to Karachi and other cities
because of overcrowding in the city's seven hospitals, which have a
total of 300 beds.
   Pakistan's worst previous railway accident occurred in 1958 and
took 150-200 lives. Far fewer people were injured than in the crash

   Other Roman Catholic nuns said
Thursday they believed Contra rebels were responsible for an ambush
in which two nuns were killed and two other members of the clergy
were wounded.
   ``We know the area is full of Contras,'' said Mother Superior
Paquita Alcacer, head of the Immaculate Conception School in
Managua. ``By logic, if they (Contras) are capable of killing
peasants, defenseless women and children, then there is no doubt''
they attacked the pickup truck on New Year's Day.
   She said that ``is what I think, which doesn't necessarily mean
it's the truth, but I think so.''
   Mother Superior Raymond Grieble of the Order of St. Agnes, the
Fond du Lac, Wis., order to which the nuns belonged, said her
religious workers always travel in clearly marked vehicles.
   Mother Raymond, regional head of the order in Managua, said she
did not know whether the pickup carried the customary
white-and-yellow Roman Catholic flag, but added: ``We did have red
crosses on the front window and the back window.''
   Such identification may have been meaningless because the attack
occurred after nightfall, when only headlights would be visible.
   The leftist Sandinista government and U.S.-backed Contras have
accused each other of ambushing the vehicle in a remote part of
northeastern Nicaragua.
   Sister Francisca Colomer, a Nicaraguan Miskito Indian wounded by
grenade shrapnel was flown Milwaukee Thursday morning on a plane
that carried the body of Sister Maureen Courtney home for burial.
   The other dead nun, Sister Teresa Rosales, a Miskito Indian, was
buried Wednesday in Puerto Cabezas, about an hour's drive from her
hometown of Santa Teresa in northeastern Nicaragua.
   Auxiliary Bishop Pablo Schmitz of the Capuchin order was wounded
in the left arm. Sister Mirna Alvarado of the Order of St. Agnes
said he underwent surgery Wednesday and was in good condition at a
military hospital in Managua.
   Barricada, the Sandinista party newspaper, said in an editorial
Thursday the attack proved the need for disarming the Contras.
While the rebels are armed, it said, ``each day that passes there
will be a greater number of defenseless citizens assassinated.''
   Contra leaders have denied responsibility for the attack and
accused the Sandinistas of carrying it out n an attempt to
discredit the rebels with the U.S. Congress.
   Current U.S. aid to the Contras runs out at the end of February
and Congress is expected to discuss continued non-lethal
assistance. The Bush administration has indicated it wants the
Contras to remain in existence until after Nicaragua's general
elections Feb. 25.

<HEAD>Official Says China Indicating It Will Change Human Rights Record</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A senior administration official said Thursday
that China has given indications it will improve its grim human
rights record in the wake of talks with two high-ranking Bush
administration officials.
   The official, speaking to White House reporters on condition of
anonymity, would not disclose those indications but answered
affirmatively when asked if there were any signs Beijing would
conduct itself differently on human rights.
   President Bush was widely criticized for sending National
Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft and Deputy Secretary of State
Lawrence Eagleburger to Beijing in the months after the president
barred high-level exchanges to protest China's violent crackdown on
pro-democracy protesters in Tiananmen Square in June.
   The second trip, a clandestine mission announced only after the
two arrived in Beijing last month, was billed as an opportunity for
the officials to brief the Chinese on Bush's recent summit meeting
with Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, as well as open the door
to possibly normalizing U.S.-China relations.
   ``We were given some indications of the Chinese attitude which,
in addition to the president's interest in a strategic sense in
informing the Chinese of the discussions at Malta, seemed to make
it important'' that the two make that trip, the official said.
   Vice President Dan Quayle has predicted that China will take
actions within six months that will make it clear that Bush made
the right decision in resuming contact with Beijing. While dropping
such hints, officials have refused to say what China is expected to
do.
   Bush said he was cutting off high level contacts and imposing
economic sanctions after Beijing sent tanks to mow down the
demonstrators, leaving a massacre of hundreds.
   It was only after the December trip was announced that it was
revealed Scowcroft and Eagleburger had also visited China in July,
the month after the bloody repression at Tiananmen Square.
   ``I don't think simply sitting on the sideline and condemning is
really the way to deal with the situation that prevailed in
China,'' the official told reporters.
   Scowcroft and Eagleburger ``forcefully represented'' what the
United States expects of China, the official said.
   Meanwhile, Bush notified Congress that the International
Development Association, a World Bank subsidiary that makes
low-cost loans to poor nations, had not made any new loans to China
since June's crackdown.
   Bush filed the report to comply with legislation enacted in
November that puts restrictions on U.S. payments to the fund.

   A legislator of the center-left Labor Party
accused Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir on Thursday of helping incite
death threats against liberal legislators who supported a peace
demonstration in Jerusalem.
   Police Commissioner David Krauss ordered an investigation of
police behavior during the demonstration, which took place Saturday
in Arab east Jerusalem.
   Police fired rubber bullets, tear gas and water cannons, and
beat demonstrators with clubs when about 15,000 peace activists
tried to form a human chain around the walled Old City.
   Shamir said Parliament members who supported the demonstration
were ``traitors.'' Labor Party legislator Avraham Burg said
Thursday Shamir's comments were partly to blame for death threats
Burg and other liberal legislators received.
   In another development Thursday, Shamir said Secretary of State
James A. Baker III and the foreign ministers of Israel and Egypt
would meet next month in an attempt to revive Middle East peace
efforts. The meeting had been expected in January, but never was
scheduled.
   ``As a result of the events in the world and the crisis that we
had in the government and the fact that the Egyptians are not
prepared, it seems as though the meeting will be in February,''
Shamir's office said in a statement.
   Baker proposed the meeting as a way of breaking a deadlock
caused by Israel's refusal of any contacts with the Palestine
Liberation Organization.
   The death threats against liberal legislators came from the
Sicarites, a shadowy group that has claimed responsibility for
several attacks on Arabs and liberal Israelis.
   ``There is an exact, direct and full connection between verbal
violence and physical violence,'' Burg said on army radio. ``When
the prime minister is the prosecutor, the Sicarites are his
henchmen.''
   Peace activists demanded an independent inquiry to examine what
they called ``excessive use of force'' by police during the
demonstration.
   Officials said police charged after demonstrators hurled stones
and raised outlawed Palestinian flags, but most reporters said they
saw no flags or stone-throwing before the police charged.
   Krauss asked for film and tapes from television crews to be
examined by a special police unit that will investigate the
incident. The unit includes a state attorney.
   About 1,000 Israelis plan to make another appeal for peace by
holding what would be an unprecedented meeting with PLO chief
Yasser Arafat, organizers said.
   Adopting the theme ``Reach Out for Peace,'' the activists hope
to urge Palestinian-Israel negotiations and dramatize opposition to
a law that bans contacts with the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   The daily Hadashot newspaper said the planned meeting in Egypt
may be attended by European Parliament members and several dovish
Israeli legislators.
   Sarah Osashki of the collective farm of Kibbutz Ramot Menashe
said the meeting was expected in late January or early February.
Neva Garbars, another activist involved in the organizing, said
Egypt had not formally consented to act as host.
   In the occupied territories, the army said Muhammad Shehta Abu
Shaar, 20, died Thursday of a rubber bullet wound to the head
suffered during a clash with soldiers last week in Gaza.
   Shaar is the 642nd Palestinian to be killed by Israeli soldiers
or civilians in the 2-year-old uprising against Israeli occupation.
Forty-three Israelis have been killed in the violence, and 166
Palestinians have been slain by fellow Arabs who accused them of
collaborating with Israeli officials.

<TEXT>
   Families whose homes were destroyed in
fierce fighting in Bucharest after Nicolae Ceausescu was overthrown
will move into spacious apartments built for the late dictator's
associates, media said Thursday.
   The daily Adevarul (Truth), which replaced the Communist Party
daily after the Dec. 22 revolution that ousted Ceausescu, said 110
of the apartments built along the Boulevard of the Victory of
Socialism, the dictator's pet project, would be turned over to
homeless families.
   The homes were destroyed in fierce fighting last month around
the state-run television, one of the centers of the revolution, and
other points in Bucharest, Adevarul said.
   It said the 110 apartments concerned had been vacant for four
years, pending completion of the Palace of the Republic that tops
what Adevarul referred to as ``the Pharaonic artery'' of the
``former Boulevard of the Victory of Socialism.''
   Families are being allotted some of the new apartments. But
officials at the site said actual turnover might be delayed because
only the facades of many apartment buildings are complete.
   Ceausescu and his wife, Elena, poured money and labor into their
pet project to put their stamp on central Bucharest, and workers
hurriedly put up the elegant facades.
   But the interiors are still largely incomplete, apart from a few
apartments clsoe to the vast Palace itself, officials told The
Associated Press.
   The 10-story, elegantly designed apartment blocks were
originally built for members of the Securitate, the Communist Party
and government elite who were to work in the Palace, Adevarul said.
   Six years ago, Ceausescu ordered thousands of old homes and
dozens of churches and other historic landmarks destroyed in the
center of Bucharest to make way for the 500-foot wide,
three-mile-long boulevard and the gigantic, still unfinished Palace
at its head.
   Ceausescu and his wife were tried by a military tribunal and
executed on Christmas Day.

   Prosecutors facing a minefield of legal
challenges to their drug cases against Manuel Antonio Noriega
combed CIA files Thursday for secrets that defense lawyers might be
able to expose at his trial.
   What's more, there is the potential problem of finding a jury
for a man publicly branded as a thug by President Bush.
   Earlier this week, Dexter W. Lehtinen, the U.S. attorney in
Miami and the prosecutor overseeing the case against Noriega, came
to Washington to join in the review of CIA documents that might
pertain to the case, said Justice Department spokesman David Runkel.
   ``It would be our intention to review material which may be
relevant,'' Runkel said of the review, which began this week.
   In the meantime, Runkel suggested that financial documents and
other material seized from Noriega's headquarters in Panama might
be used to bring a superseding indictment against the fallen
dictator.
   Those documents have already helped investigators trace
drug-trafficking profits Noriega allegedly stashed in European
banks, Runkel said.
   The review of files at CIA headquarters was being conducted by
Justice Department lawyers and prosecutors from Miami and Tampa,
where Noriega faces a second set of drug charges, Runkel said.
   The review, which would normally occur before an indictment is
returned, is being conducted to determine if there are intelligence
documents that Noriega could obtain for his defense because of the
extensive dealings he once had with the CIA as an informant.
   The deposed Panamanian ruler is expected to try to force the
dismissal of the drug-trafficking charges against him by
threatening to disclose sensitive information about his
longstanding relationship with the CIA.
   But Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, in an appearance on
ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America'' Thursday, indicated the review
had not turned up anything so far that would hobble the case.
   ``Obviously, we can't anticipate what General Noriega may raise
by way of defense at trial, but suffice it to say at the moment
that there's nothing that's come to our attention that would
indicate that this trial can't go forward,'' the attorney general
said.
   Runkel stressed that Noriega would have to show that any secrets
he thinks are in the CIA's possession are relevant to the charges
that he provided a haven for Colombian drug lords and shared in
their profits.
   ``This is a drug case and I would assume that any documents
which anyone would seek to introduce have to meet the test of
relevancy,'' Runkel said.
   To show relevancy, Noriega would have to demonstrate that the
CIA was a partner in drug operations and such evidence ``is just
not there,'' said one Justice Department official, speaking on the
condition of anonymity.
   Besides CIA secrets, prosecutors face a number of potentially
serious legal issues that are expected to be raised by Noriega's
defense lawyers.
   One is the issue of pre-trial publicity that will most certainly
be raised in light of statements since the U.S. invasion of Panama
made by Bush and others in the administration.
   Before Noriega gave himself up, Bush said that the general
should be ``brought to justice for poisoning the children of
America'' with illegal drugs and that the Vatican, in whose embassy
Noriega took refuge, had a history ``of giving asylum to people who
are fleeing _ even thugs like Noriega.''
   After Noriega's arrest, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater
told reporters, ``You can expect the president and all of us to be
very careful in the days ahead not to offer any comments on the
case that might prejudice it in any way.''
   The Justice Department's Runkel, who himself once called the
ex-ruler an ``international thug,'' has now taken to describing him
as ``a defendant of allegations of criminal conduct.''
   Thornburgh, noting that pre-trial publicity did not prevent
trials of Watergate defendants, expressed confidence that
statements about Noriega wouldn't jeopardize the courts' ability to
pick impartial juries.
   ``We've had numerous cases within the past decade or so of
persons who have recived a great deal of public attention who have,
in fact, been the subject of extended congressional hearings that
set forth all kinds of charges against them,'' Thornburgh said,
recalling trials arising from the Watergate and Iran-Contra affairs.
   Louis Michael Seidman, a criminal law professor at the
Georgetown University Law Center, noted that then-President Nixon's
comments labeling Charles Manson as a criminal didn't derail the
cult killer's murder trial in Los Angeles.
   ``The Supreme Court has never said that adverse pre-trial
publicity is such that it would make a trial impossible in a
notorious case,'' Seidman said. The justices ``have always said it
is the obligation of the judge to do the things necessary to
minimize the effect of the publicity.''
   Careful questioning of prospective jurors would accomplish that
goal, Seidman said.
   If the Justice Deparment tries to use as evidence material
seized during the U.S. invasion, defense lawyers are expected to
claim that the warrantless search violated Noriega's Fourth
Amendment rights.
   The Justice Department says that items found include cocaine and
financial documents that have allowed investigators to trace as
much as $10 million Noriega allegedly kept in foreign banks. The
assets are being frozen in five European countries.
   Runkel said prosecutors may use evidence seized in Panama to
bolster the existing case and he wouldn't rule out the option of
using it to seek a superseding indictment against Noriega.
   Later in the day, Runkel said:
   ``We're on the early end of reviewing documents and no decisions
have been made in this area. It's premature to talk about what
action might or might not be taken in the future.''
   Seidman said he doubted a Fourth Amendment challenge to the use
of the evidence would result in the evidence being excluded from
the case.
   ``In an emergency situation, in a fast-moving situation or in
situations where the primary aim is not law enforcement, you don't
need a warrant and you don't need probable cause'' to search a
location, Seidman said.
   ``I would not be surprised if a court would hold that the
exclusionary rule does not apply to the armed forces when
conducting military operations,'' Seidman said.

   The Vatican Embassy told Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega it would lift its diplomatic immunity and invite
Panamanian security forces inside to arrest him if he didn't
voluntarily leave, a spokesman said Thursday.
   Rev. Javier Villanueva, assistant to the papal nuncio, Monsignor
Sebastian Laboa, said Noriega was not given a specific deadline.
   ``But if he would not have given himself up, the Panamanian
government, not the U.S. government, would have been invited to
send in forces to take him out. We would have lifted the diplomatic
immunity,'' Villanueva said in a telephone interview.
   He said that position was made explicitly clear to Noriega, who
surrendered Wednesday night to U.S. troops after a 10-day stay at
the embassy that began Christmas Eve.
   Meanwhile, Maj. Gen. Marc Cisneros, the commander of U.S. Army
South, confirmed that Noriega kept a submachine gun under his bed
during his entire stay at the nunciature. That would have made it
difficult for unarmed embassy staffers to remove him against his
will.
   Vatican and U.S. officials have insisted Noriega walked out of
the embassy Wednesday night because he came to the conclusion that
``he had no other option'' or that it was in his own best interests.
   ``This (lifting diplomatic immunity) would never be done with
anyone taking sanctuary for political reasons. But this man is a
highly dangerous criminal,'' said Villanueva.
   Capturing Noriega might have been a mixed blessing for the
Panamanians. President Guillermo Endara said that the new
government had no facilities or judicial system adequate to the
task of prosecuting and imprisoning the fallen dictator and that
Noriega should go to the United States, where he has been charged
with drug trafficking.
   But several top Panamanian officials said there was no provision
in Panamanian law for Noriega to be extradited, so if he had come
into Panamanian hands they might have been legally stuck with him.
   Vice President Ricardo Arias Calderon had suggested early this
week that if Noriega did not voluntarily give himself up, the
Vatican could move its embassy, leaving Noriega behind.
   According to that scenario, the Vatican would have taken down
its flag from the pole in front of its compound, removed its
personnel and established a temporary or permanent mission in
another building.
   But Villanueva, a parish priest at one of Panama's most
important churches who was helping Laboa, said that course was not
seriously considered. He said the lifting of immunity so Noriega
could be removed was ``a hypothesis that became logical.''

   President Daniel Ortega said Thusday
the United States should withdraw its troops from Panama at once
because they had achieved their goal of capturing Gen. Manuel
Antonio Noriega.
   ``Noriega is already in the power of the Yankees ... so there
isn't a single reason for the Yankees to remain in Panama, not one
more moment,'' Ortega said.
   U.S. withdrawal, he added, would provide ``some tranquility to
the Central Americans and the Latin Americans.''
   Noriega turned himself in to U.S. authorities Wednesday night in
Panama City after spending 10 days in the Vatican Embassy. He was
flown to Miami and arraigned Thursday on drug trafficking charges.
   ``The people and government of Nicaragua, as well as the peoples
and governments of Latin America ... demand that the North American
government withdraw immediately from Panama,'' Ortega said in La
Libertad, his hometown in central Chontales province, 110 miles
east of Managua.
   His remarks were broadcast on the official government radio
station La Voz de Nicaragua. The president is campaigning for the
Feb. 25 general elections.
   Ortega put the armed forces on maximum alert when U.S. troops
invaded Panama on Dec. 20. The leftist Sandinista government often
has predicted a U.S. invasion of Nicaragua.

   General Mills Inc. says it will drop
its Benefit breakfast cereal because of poor sales in the wake of a
federal inquiry provoked by the company's claim that the cereal
could help lower cholesterol.
   ``We envisioned that, with all the interest in cholesterol, a
product like Benefit would appeal to a broad range of consumers,''
company spokesman R. Craig Shulstad said Wednesday. ``What we found
was that it appealed to a much narrower range than we had
expected.''
   The cereal contains about 8 percent by weight of psyllium, a
soluble fiber that General Mills said had been scientifically shown
to reduce cholesterol.
   The company said it was removing Benefit from grocery store
shelves after eight months of disappointing sales in test markets.
   ``It was strictly a business decision based on disappointing
product performance,'' Shulstad said.
   General Mills' marketing strategy and psyllium, which separated
Benefit from other cereals promoted for their health benefits, led
to a controversy in the food industry over whether the cereal was a
drug or a food.
   The Food and Drug Administration expressed concern about the
amount of psyllium people should consume and called for supporting
scientific data.

   DEC. 19 _ President Bush orders U.S. troops into combat in
Panama City on a mission to seize Panamanian dictator Manuel
Antonio Noriega to face federal drug charges in United States.
Noriega, aware of increased U.S. military activity, goes to Colon,
50 miles north of Panama City, to inspect a new military facility.
Seven hours before the invasion he visits a Panamanian Defense
Forces officers' club on the military side of the international
airport.
   DEC. 20 _ American forces attack and announce within hours they
have smashed Noriega's forces. Noriega flees the club when the
airport is attacked and eludes American troops by driving around
Panama City in circles. He avoids contact with PDF forces, fearing
a trap, and does not take charge of his troops in the fighting. In
a radio broadcast recorded in advance, he tells Panamanians: ``We
are in trench warfare now and we will maintain the resistance. ...
Our slogan is to win or die _ not one step back.''
   DEC. 21 _ Bush says U.S. forces will scour Panama for ``as long
as it takes'' to capture Noriega. An ``agitated'' Noriega spends
several days at different locations but most of the time is at the
home of a relative of Marcella Tason, his personal secretary. While
in hiding he considers but rules out fleeing to the mountains. He
also was believed to have contemplated going to Cuba's embassy, but
backed off because that compound was surrounded by U.S. troops.
   DEC. 24 _ Noriega ends up in the house of the mother of his
mistress, Vicky Amado. Reports say her teen-age daughter called the
information number set up to take tips on finding Noriega and that
the 82nd Airborne Delta Force sent a five-man team to seize him but
missed him by 30 minutes. Noriega contacts the Vatican Embassy and
within a few hours a rendezvous is arranged and a representative of
the Embassy picks Noriega up at a Panama City Dairy Queen and
drives him to the nunciature. Other reports said Noriega drove to
the Vatican after learning of the surrender of one of his closest
commanders, Luis del Cid. The Bush administration demands he be
turned over to face drug charges and intense negotiations involving
the Vatican, U.S. government and new Panamanian government ensue.
   DEC. 25-JAN. 2 _ Noriega stays in Vatican Embassy with minimal
hospitality, living in a small room on the second floor with no
telephone, a broken TV set and a Bible.
   JAN. 3 _ After being assured he would not face the death penalty
in the United States, Noriega decides to surrender. He asks only
that he be permitted a few phone calls, including one to his wife
in the Cuban Embassy, that he be permitted to wear his uniform, and
that his surrender be kept secret until it was done. He leaves the
Vatican Embassy and surrenders to U.S. authorities.
   JAN. 4 _ Plane carrying Noriega arrives at Homestead Air Force
Base in Florida. Noriega is arraigned on drug-trafficking charges
and remanded to the custody of the U.S. marshals.

   Manuel Antonio Noriega surrendered to U.S.
authorities only after the Vatican Embassy in Panama City told him
his safe haven there ``would expire'' as of noon Thursday, a senior
Bush administration official said Thursday.
   The official, briefing reporters at the White House on the
condition of anonymity, said the ultimatum may well have prompted
Noriega to turn himself over to U.S. troops rather than be left to
deal with a hostile crowd surrounding the embassy.
   ``The papal nuncio had said that his asylum or what have you
would expire by noon today, meaning he (Noriega) would no longer be
a welcome guest,'' the official said.
   He speculated that Noriega might have noted the crowd and
wondered what would have happened to him ``if the troops stepped
aside.''
   ``As far as I know, we had absolutely no role to play in
organizing that demonstration,'' the official said.
   In Panama, Rev. Javier Villanueva, assistant to the papal
nuncio, said it was made clear to Noriega that if he had not given
himself up, ``the Panamanian government, not the U.S. government,
would have been invited to send in forces to take him out.''
   In Miami, at Noriega's arraignment on drug charges, attorney
Frank Rubino said that the general had been told Wednesday
protection would be withdrawn from the embassy and that he
surrendered to avoid further bloodshed.
   Rubin told the judge at the arraignment that Noriega is a
political prisoner, and he refused to enter a plea to the charges.
The judge then entered an innocent plea.
   Meanwhile, Noriega's removal from Panama was hailed by U.S.
officials, who said it would hasten withdrawal of U.S. troops. The
officials vowed to avoid harsh comments that might sabotage his
trial on drug charges.
   But there was no doubt the administration was enjoying Noriega's
surrender and subsequent trip in custody to Florida to stand trial.
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney called it the ``icing on the cake''
for the U.S. military action that began Dec. 20.
   The senior administration official, asked about reports that
Vatican staff members were considering evacuating the mission and
leaving Noriega alone at noon, said: ``I have no further
understanding of what would happen at noon today if Noriega didn't
leave.''
   The official said that members of Noriega's family now sheltered
in the Cuban Embassy in Panama City are expected to be given safe
passage to the Dominican Republic.
   With Noriega facing arraignment in Miami and his countrymen
rejoicing at his departure back in Panama City, Bush dispatched
Colin Powell, the nation's top general, to Panama to work on troop
withdrawals.
   Cheney said on CBS-TV that Powell, who is chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, would work with the head of the Southern Command
to ``develop a plan for withdrawing those troops over the next
several weeks.''
   Several Democratic members of Congress also called for quick
withdrawal of the forces that ousted Noriega from power.
   ``We need the U.S. military presence not only to become less
visible but less present,'' said one of them, Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga.,
chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee.
   At the White House, Bush's spokesman was choosing his words
carefully in speaking of the deposed ruler previously dismissed as
a ``thug'' in comments by the president as recently as last weekend.
   ``You can expect the president and all of us to be very careful
in the days ahead not to offer any comments on the case that might
prejudice it in any way,'' said press secretary Marlin Fitzwater.
   Some 2,000 of the 14,000 extra troops sent in for the invasion
have come home. However, Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said the
total number of troops in Panama _ about 26,000 _ has changed
little because military police and civil affairs specialists have
replaced some combat units
   A day after he triumphantly announced Noriega's surrender on
nationwide television, the president kept out of the public eye.
   He was said to have telephoned Pope John Paul II to thank him
for any efforts in persuading Noriega to leave the Vatican Embassy
in Panama City and surrender.
   ``The pope expressed his humanitarian concerns for the people of
Panama. President Bush assured the pope that Gen. Noriega will be
treated to all the protections of U.S. law and would receive a fair
trial,'' Fitzwater said.
   In other developments:
   _A U.S. drug enforcement official said Noriega might eventually
be returned to Panama for trial on other charges, including murder.
``Returning him to Panama remains a possibility for the future''
after his U.S. trial, said David Westrate, assistant administrator
of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.
   _Pentagon spokesman Williams said a Noriega bodyguard overheard
two U.S. servicemen discussing the invasion of Panama hours before
it occurred. It was unclear, however, whether the guard relayed
that information to Noriega, Williams said.
   U.S. prosecutors combed CIA files for sensitive materials in
advance of an expected request by Noriega _ in connection with his
trial _ for classified documents dealing with his long relationship
with the agency.
   In recounting Noriega's surrender and arrest, U.S. officials
said the ousted military leader was handcuffed, read his
constitutional rights in Spanish and examined by U.S. military
doctors aboard the C-130 military transport plane that flew him to
Homestead Air Force Base, near Miami.
   The doctors found Noriega in good health, Fitzwater said.
   He faces trial on two-year-old drug-trafficking charges that
accuse him of accepting a $4.6 billion bribe from Colombian drug
lords, among other offenses. Noriega could face up to 145 years in
prison and $1.1 million in fines if convicted on all counts.
   Administration officials said that Noriega's surrender left four
Panamanians still sheltered in the Vatican Embassy in Panama City,
all Noriega loyalists.
   Fitzwater said that U.S. troops will stay outside the building
while the four remain.
   Bush also called Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney in
Canada Thursday to discuss the Noriega surrender and to thank
Canada for supporting the United States at the United Nations,
which voted 75-20 last week to condemn the U.S. invasion.

<HEAD>Toyota Exec: Won't Be Able to Tell Import From Domestic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Distinctions between domestic and imported cars
will disappear in this decade, a Toyota Motor Corp. executive said
Thursday, and Ford Motor Co. introduced what it said ushered in the
age of the ``world car.''
   During the 1990s, engineering, design and manufacturing centers
will move freely around the world, focusing in Europe, Asia and
North America, said Robert McCurry, executive vice president of
Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A. Inc., the American marketing arm for
Japan's largest automaker.
   ``Protectionist sentiments will be out of step as trade deficits
begin to balance out,'' McCurry said during the second day of a
three-day media preview of the North American International Auto
Show in Detroit.
   A few hours before he spoke, Ford officials described their
``centers of excellence'' approach that led to the development of
the 1991 Ford Escort. The car was developed in association with
Mazda Motor Corp. of Japan, which provides some of the drivetrain
and other components for the successor to one of the best-selling
cars in the 1980s.
   ``It's a new way of doing business at Ford,'' said company
executive vice president Alex Trotman.
   The ``world car,'' along with its sister vehicle Mercury Tracer,
will be built in Wayne, Mich., and Hermosillo, Mexico, and Ford
expects to sell about 500,000 of them in North America and 950,000
worldwide annually.
   Sales of Escorts have been slipping lately. In 1987 and 1988, it
was the best-selling car in the United States. In 1989, it slipped
to third place, behind the Honda Accord and the Ford Taurus. But
Escort assembly plants were down for part of the year to change
over for new models.
   One of the reasons Ford executives hope the car will catch on is
the impact that it will have on the company's corporate average
fuel economy ratings, or CAFE.
   The federal government mandates that automakers must maintain a
fleet fuel economy average of 27.5 miles per gallon during the 1990
model year or face fines. There has been speculation the minimum
will rise in coming years.
   That gives automakers an impetus to sell small, more
fuel-efficient cars. But there's a gamble involved since small cars
don't provide automakers with as much profit on a per-car basis as
larger cars. And incentives, which have become a part of buying
cars these days, can cut further into the profit margin for each
car sold.
   ``These products don't provide the normal level of profit
because of the volumes we have to maintain for CAFE,'' said Kenneth
Dabrowski, program manager for international and small car programs.
   Ford Chairman Donald Petersen said the new Escort ``couldn't be
more crucial'' to Ford's CAFE rating.
   ``It's the foundation upon which the whole Ford Motor Company
CAFE is built,'' said Ford Division General Manager Tom Wagner.
   In addition to helping the company with its average fuel economy
ratings, auto analysts said Thursday it keeps Ford in the
lower-priced, entry-level market, a market segment that Chrysler
Corp. largely is leaving when it stops production of its Dodge Omni
and Plymouth Horizon cars next month. General Motors Corp. is in
the segment with its Geo line of small cars.
   The Escort-Tracer program involves a $2-billion Ford investment.
The level of Mazda's isn't known, but analysts speculated that it
must be in the neighborhood of $1 billion. Mazda builds its 323
Hatchback off the platform used in the Ford and Mercury vehicles.

<HEAD>Harvard Team Details, Denounces Activists' Torture in Haiti</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL NORTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ A team of health and human rights
experts from Harvard University on Thursday denounced what they
called the torture of four jailed activists charged with plotting
to assassinate Haiti's military ruler.
   ``The inability of the prisoners to get adequate and independent
medical treatment amounts to a continuation of the original
torture,'' said Matthew Dumont of Harvard's International Health
And Human Rights Group.
   Dumont, a physician at Massachusetts General Hospital, said the
nine-member delegation on Tuesday visited Jean-Auguste Mesyeux,
Evans Paul, Marino Etienne and Frantz Patrick Beauchard in the
national penitentiary.
   Delegation co-leader Kari Nadeau, a Harvard medical student,
said that following a medical examination of the prisoners
delegates found Paul had a crushed hip, extremely high blood
pressure and his chest ``had been beaten in.''
   Ms. Nadeau said Mesyeux had kidney damage and hearing problems
as a result of beating. Beauchard's right eardrum was scarred, and
his hearing and vision were impaired. Etienne, who cannot stand up
alone, had kidney problems, anemia and a broken finger as a result
of mistreatment, she said.
   Ms. Nadeau said the men were receiving no medical treatment, and
``all are still in pain.'' She said the penitentiary was
disease-ridden and guards carried whips and beat inmates.
   Mesyeux, Paul, and Etienne were arrested Nov. 1 and accused of
plotting to assassinate military leader Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril.
Beauchard was arrested Dec. 13.
   The first three, who along with Beauchard have denied the
charges, were arrested the day after signing a communique calling
for demonstrations to denounce the government's human rights abuses.
   The sight of their battered faces on state television Nov. 2
triggered general strikes that paralyzed Haiti for three days.
   The Roman Catholic Church denounced what it called the torture
of the four at police hands.
   Avril repeatedly has promised to respect human rights, but
rights and civic groups have often denounced his government for
such violations.

   Here is a brief summary of developments Thursday concerning
Panamanian Gen. Manuel Noriega:
   _ Noriega refused to enter a plea to drug-trafficking charges in
Miami, saying he was a political prisoner. The judge entered an
innocent plea for him. He was held without bond. If convicted, he
faces 145 years in prison and $1.1 million in fines.
   _ Noriega's lawyer said Noriega decided to surrender to avoid
further bloodshed after being told protection would be withdrawn as
crowds surrounded the Vatican Embassy.
   _ A senior Bush administration official said the Vatican Embassy
had been planning to order Noriega to leave at noon on Thursday had
he not surrendered.
   _ The Vatican had said Noriega freely decided to leave the
embassy. But a Vatican Embassy spokesman later said the embassy had
told Noriega it would lift its diplomatic immunity and invite
Panamanian security forces inside to arrest him if he didn't leave.
The spokesman said no specific deadline was set.
   _ Lt. Col. Nivaldo Madrinan, a top Noriega adviser and head of
his secret police, walked out of the Vatican Embassy and
surrendered to U.S. troops.
   _ A Drug Enforcement Administration official said Noriega could
be returned to Panama for trial on a long list of charges after his
U.S. trial.
   _ President Bush sent Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff, to Panama plan the withdrawal of U.S. combat
troops. Some 25,000 remain in Panama.
   _ Members of Congress said the United States must quickly reduce
its military presence in Panama and provide large-scale economic
aid.

   The videotape pictures, taken at night, were
grainy. But you could make out the beetle shape of a U.S. Army
Blackhawk helicopter. You also could vaguely see human forms.
   Special night lenses on network cameras helped record Panamanian
Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega's surrender Wednesday night to U.S.
officials who took him aboard the helicopter and eventually to the
United States to face drug trafficking charges.
   It was not-so-new technology, though. The lenses, which NBC News
executive David Miller says cost about $30,000 each, amplify
existing light and are similar in principle to night-vision devices
used in Vietnam.
   They have been routinely used for years, network executives say.
   ``We have several of them. Most of the bureaus have them. ...
It's a standard piece of equipment,'' said Robert Murphy, ABC News
vice president for news coverage.
   The lenses were used last year in Eastern Europe to cover
demonstrations, he said.
   After it was learned that Noriega fled to the Vatican Embassy in
Panama City on Christmas Eve, all the networks set up observation
posts at a Holiday Inn overlooking the embassy, and began a
day-and-night stakeout.
   All but CNN had a camera with a night lens.
   When Noriega began to leave the embassy at 8:50 p.m. EDT
Wednesday, CBS, first to report he would surrender, and NBC had
crews up and ready at the Holiday Inn. They got their night-lens
shots.
   So did ABC's crew, but from an office building, ``from a
perpendicular angle. I think we had the better shot,'' Murphy said.
   ABC, whose taped pictures were broadcast first, at 9:31 p.m.
EDT, showed a figure wearing white _ ABC's corrrespondent John
Martin said the man was believed to be Noriega _ walking from the
gate of the Vatican Embassy.
   ``That was our shot _ stolen by several other organizations,''
said Murphy, who declined to identify the offenders.

<HEAD>Suit Challeges Name, Mission of Mississippi University for Women</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLUMBUS, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A lawsuit has been filed in federal court
asking that the name, mission and recruiting practices of
Mississippi University for Women be changed so more men will enroll.
   The lawsuit filed by attorney Wil Colom on behalf of himself,
Keith Washington and Edward Pleasant follows their previous lawsuit
which was thrown out by a federal judge in November.
   The lawsuit claims Washington did not apply to MUW in 1985
because of its single-sex mission, name and recruiting practices
and is now at Alcorn State University.
   Pleasant is a senior at the state's School for Math and Science,
a high school on the MUW campus in Columbus. His mother, Phyllis,
said in the court papers filed Tuesday that her son is attracted to
MUW for economic reasons, because he would be able to live at home,
but will not apply for admission because of the school's name and
mission.
   Following a U.S. Supreme Court decision, MUW first admitted men
in 1982, when 131 enrolled. Male enrollment then rose for five
years, to 460 in 1987. It fell to 417 in 1988 and to 390 in the
fall of 1989. The school's total enrollment this year is 2,109.
   The latest lawsuit names MUW President Clyda Rent, the State
College Board and Gov. Ray Mabus. There was no comment from them
Thursday: the school is on holiday break and Rent's home phone was
answered by an answering machine; the board's director was in a
meeting; the governor's office referred questions to the attorney
general's office, where Assistant Attorney General Gail Lowery said
there was no comment because they had not seen the lawsuit.
   Colom said he believes the federal court can order the
Legislature to create a gender-neutral name and mission for the
Columbus school, now in its 105th year.
   ``That change would be required if the court finds the present
mission and name to be unconstitutional. That's what we seek in
this suit,'' he said.
   The lawsuit was filed as a class action on behalf of all males
who failed to apply to or attend the school because of its
philosophy and admissions requirements.
   The lawsuit asks the court to stop the defendants from carrying
out the single-sex mission, to order them to adopt a gender-neutral
name for the school, and to order MUW to recruit male students on
the same basis it uses in recruiting females.

<HEAD>Thousands Demonstrate Against Liberal Ethnic Policies</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS throughout with demonstration, details. No pickup</NOTE>
<DATELINE>SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of people marched past
Parliament on Thursday to protest liberal new ethnic policies,
while the ruling Communist Party and democratic opposition met
inside to plan Bulgaria's future.
   BTA, the official news agency, said detailed ``round-table''
talks between the party and opposition would be held Jan. 16-24.
   The protesters, most from the southern cities of Kardalji and
Haskovo, threatened strikes in several cities for Friday unless the
government reversed its decision to restore minority rights to
ethnic Turks.
   They waved banners reading ``Bulgaria for Bulgarians,'' and
chanted slogans against a decision announced Dec. 29 that ended
such discriminatory practices as requiring ethnic Turks to take
Bulgarian names.
   Leaders of the protest delivered a petition to Parliament
demanding a referendum on ethnic questions.
   BTA quoted spokesmen for both the Communists and opposition as
rejecting the demand on grounds that ``the validity of human rights
in Bulgaria cannot be submitted to any referendum.''
   In Ankara, Foreign Ministry spokesman Murat Sungar said the
demonstrations were intended to damage Turkish-Bulgarian relations.
   Ivan Angelov, a prominent economist speaking for the Communists,
said high-ranking officials he did not identify met Thursday to
discuss ethnic issues, the agency reported. It gave no details.
   Angelov and opposition spokesman Georgi Spassov spoke after the
Communists, the opposition and other groups reached agreement on
future negotiations after two days of negotiations.
   The discussions later this month will cover ``problems of
national agreement and reconciliation,'' restructuring of the
political, economic and legal systems and drafting a new law for
free elections, according to the report.
   An umbrella organization of opposition groups, the Union of
Democratic Forces, demanded the right to publish its own daily
newspaper, time on state television and radio and the use of a
building as headquarters, the agency said. It said a decision would
be made before the talks began.
   Parliament is expected to pave the way for a pluralistic
political system Jan. 15 when it votes on removing Communist
Party's guarantee of a power monopoly from the constitution.
   The Dec. 29 decision on ethnic rights also gave Turkish
Bulgarians the right to choose their own religion and schools.
   About 300 ethnic Turks fled to Turkey last year after the
restrictions were imposed by Todor Zhivkov, the Communist Party
chief whose Stalinist regime was deposed in November after 35 years
in power.

   A top Drug Enforcement Administration official
indicated Thursday that ousted Panamanian dictator Manuel Antonio
Noriega, now in Miami to face drug-trafficking charges, may be
returned to Panama for trial afterward.
   ``We feel it's important to bring people to trial wherever the
best case exists,'' David Westrate, assistant DEA administrator for
operations, said in an interview. ``Returning him to Panama remains
a possibility for the future.''
   Richard Arias Calderon, a vice president of Panama, said it
would be imposible for Panamanian officials to provide Noriega with
either security or a fair trial now.
   ``He left us without a judicial system,'' Calderon said. ``We
couldn't have guaranteed, under the circumstances, due process,''
he said on the ``MacNeil-Lehrer Newshour'' program on public
television.
   But Calderon said Panamanian officials would definitely seek to
prosecute Noriega in Panama if ``by some impossible occurrance, he
were to go scot free'' in the United States.
   Earlier, Guillermo Ford, another vice president installed in
office following the Dec. 20 invasion of Panama by U.S. troops,
said Noriega would be returned to Panama for trial on a long list
of charges after his U.S. trial ends.
   ``No revenge. Due process,'' he said on ABC's ``Nightline,''
Wednesday night several hours after Noriega emerged from the
Vatican Embassy in Panama City _ where he had been holed up since
Christmas Eve _ and gave himself up to U.S. forces.
   Officials of Panama's new government have said they plan to
charge Noriega with murder in the deaths of officers who led a
failed Oct. 3 coup and were allegedly slain after their capture.
   DEA officials formally arrested Noriega at Howard Air Base west
of Panama City and accompanied him to Miami along with U.S.
marshals and U.S. military.
   In his interview, Westrate discussed the impact Noriega's
incarceration on the drug trade.
   ``The functioning of Panama as a safe haven and a point of
facilitation to the (drug) trafficking organizations has been
important and is now eliminated,'' Westrate said. ``In fact, I
think Panama will emerge as a strong ally in the anti-drug fight in
the weeks ahead.''
   ``You have to take this in context with a lot of other things
going on right now,'' he said.
   Other recent events include the Dec. 15 shoot-out in Colombia in
which alleged Medellin cocaine cartel kingpin Gonzalo Rodriguez
Gacha was killed by security forces, the Dec. 10 extradition from
Bolivia of Luis Arce Gomez, dubbed Bolivia's ``Minister of
Cocaine,'' to the United States for trial in Florida on charges of
conspiracy to import and distribute cocaine, and Colombia's
extradition to the United States of 11 people wanted on drug
charges here.
   The capture of Noriega has had a major impact on those fighting
the drug war, he said.
   ``This is an important confidence builder, the type of thing
that renews everybody's commitment _ agents, prosecutors, people
working in the prevention areas. We know we can get this job done.''
   He acknowledged that U.S. law enforcement officials, including
DEA Administrator John C. Lawn, had praised Noriega as recently as
a few years ago for his help in anti-drug efforts.
   ``We've done a lot of positive business there with the
Panamanian Defense Forces over the years in individual cases,''
Westrate said. ``But in recent years, it's quite clear that Panama
has been utilized by these trafficking organizations to their
benefit.
   ``Now, in addition to good work in the past, we will be able to
do even more with the officials in that country,'' specifically in
curtailing money-laundering and eliminating Panama as a stopping
off point for traffickers, he said.
   The DEA, which closed its Panama office when the U.S. Embassy
was shut down last May, expects to re-establish a presence there
soon with a few agents, he said.

   All 22 people aboard a Panamanian-registered ship
were rescued Thursday night after the 7,402-ton bulk carrier caught
fire in the mouth of the English Channel, the British defense
ministry reported.
   The ministry said in a statement that the ship, the Pioneer Sea,
sent out a distress call when its engine room caught fire 25 miles
west of the island of Ouessant, or Ushant as it is also known in
Britain, off northwestern France.
   Two British Royal Navy helicopters, a British reconnaissance
Nimrod plane, a French helicopter and an East German cargo ship,
the 2,543-ton Themar, took part in the rescue operation.
   The ministry statement said 20 of the 22 people aboard the
Pioneer Sea were taken aboard a lifeboat launched by the Themar.
   It said the two others were rescued from the blazing Pioneer Sea
by one of the British helicopters.
   The second British helicopter later flew the captain of the
Pioneer Sea, who was suffering from smoke inhalation, from the
Themar to a hospital at the nearby French military air base at
Lanveoc.
   The French radio station at Le Conquet broadcast a navigation
warning to shipping to steer clear of the Pioneer Sea as it drifted
out of control.

<HEAD>Row Flares in Czechoslovakia Over German Issue</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Communist Party chairman
assailed on Thursday remarks by new President Vaclav Havel that
indicated Czechoslovakia might apologize for expelling its 3
million German minority after World War II.
   ``I declare with the utmost resolution that the Communist Party
of Czechoslovakia and I personally do not agree with apologies to
Sudeten Germans for their resettlement from Czechoslovakia,''
chairman Ladislav Adamec said in a front-page article in his
party's Rude Pravo daily.
   It marked the first public rift between Havel and Adamec since a
peaceful revolution in November stripped the Communists of their
monopoly on power and forced creation of a coalition with former
dissidents until free elections this year.
   Sources in the Civic Forum, the opposition group that backed
Havel for president, acknowledged that popular reaction to Havel's
suggestion was ``unequivocally negative.''
   Czechoslovaks traditionally have been wary of German
expansionism, and retain strong memories of Nazi atrocities and
occupation during World War II.
   Havel himself underlined the importance of the German question
here by making East and West Germany his first state visit.
   That visit was meant to stress the need for a new era in
relations with both Germanys.
   But when Civic Forum spokesman Martin Palous was asked Thursday
about the prospect of an apology to the Germans he replied:
   ``As far as we are informed, the Czechoslovak government is not
contemplating anything of the sort.''
   Rude Pravo quoted Havel as saying on television before Christmas
and his Dec. 29 election that ``it is our duty to apologize to
Germans who were resettled after World War II.''
   It further quoted from what it said was a letter Havel wrote to
President Richard von Weizsaecker of West Germany that referred to
the expulsion as ``an immoral act of the utmost depth,'' damaging
both Germans and Czechs.
   Lubos Dobrovsky, another Civic Forum spokesman, commented, ``It
is not in agreement with the spirit of European politics to
resettle an entire minority. The way the Third Reich acted against
Czechoslovakia and other nations is even less in agreement with
such policy.
   ``The point is to realize our duty, to make sure that such evil
is not repeated.''

   Delta Air Lines said Thursday it is stepping up
security and giving passengers the option of canceling their
reservations after receiving a ``general threat'' against its
trans-Atlantic flights.
   Delta spokesman Jim Lundy said the threat did not name a
particular flight, city or day. He would not say when the threat
was received or give other details.
   Lundy said passengers were being notified of the threat upon
check-in and were given the option of canceling or delaying their
trips. Delta's trans-Atlantic operations include flights to and
from Germany, Ireland, England and France.
   ``At this point, we have no information that it is anything but
a hoax,'' Lundy said. ``We've got to take it seriously. We do take
it seriously.''
   Lundy said federal authorities had been notified, but a
spokeswoman for the Federal Aviation Administration, Arlene Salac,
said the agency was not involved.
   The intensified security will remain in effect until officials
are sure the threat has ended or have confirmed it as a hoax, Lundy
said.
   Delta officials said early Thursday evening that only 20 to 30
of about 700 ticket holders on its four international flights
scheduled out of Atlanta during the night had switched airlines.
   Patrick Walsh and his wife of Belfast, Northern Ireland, said
they switched from Delta to Swissair after hearing about the
threat. The switch means they will arrive in Dublin six hours later
than planned.
   ``You have two options about it, so you take the one you're more
comfortable with,'' Mrs. Walsh said. ``If we'd known about it
sooner, we'd have stayed in Miami a little longer.''
   Birgit Sekulin of Munich, West Germany, said her family of four
switched to Lufthansa German Airlines, but the move made her feel
only slightly better.
   ``First of all, we are a family. We don't like to fly all four
of us on the same plane if there are things like this,'' she said.
   Roger White of Chicago, however, said he was not changing his
flight plans. The bomb threat ``didn't mean a thing about choosing
an airline,'' he said.
   Last week, a Northwest Airlines flight from Paris to Detroit
received a bomb threat. After passengers were told they could
cancel, the DC-10, which holds 284 passengers, made a safe flight
Saturday carrying 22 passengers and 14 crew members.

   A man was sentenced to three months in
jail Thursday in connection with the hit-and-run accident that
killed childhood kidnap victim Steven Stayner last September.
   Antonio Loera, 28, had pleaded no contest to a charge of felony
hit-and-run driving for leaving the scene of the accident. He was
also placed on probation for a year by Merced County Superior Court
Judge George C. Barrett.
   A vehicular manslaughter charge against Loera was dropped after
an investigation showed a defective carburetor and loose throttle
caused his car to stall when he pulled out of a driveway.
   Stayner, 24, was killed when he hit the car with his motorcycle.
   Loera, a packing house worker, told reporters through a
Spanish-speaking interpreter that he regrets fleeing after the
accident and hoped others would learn from his experience. He
voluntarily returned to Merced and surrendered.
   Stayner's widow, Jody, was in the courtroom during sentencing
but declined to comment to reporters.
   Stayner returned to his family at age 14, seven years after he
was kidnapped by a drifter as he walked home from school in Merced.
He eventually married and had two children, now 3 and 2.

   U.S. troops arrested a Cuban diplomat
and held him for two hours Thursday after he was apprehended while
walking out of the ambassador's residence, another diplomat's wife
said.
   ``He was forced out of the car, separated from the others and
taken,'' said Sandra Faxas, wife of Luis Delfin Peres, the
second-ranking diplomat in the Cuban Embassy.
   She said Victor Fernandez Gonzalez was walking out of the
embassy with six other diplomats who were to drive to the airport
to board the first commercial flight to Cuba since the Dec. 20 U.S.
invasion toppled Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   ``The Americans arrested Fernandez because his name is the
same'' as that of a member of Noriega's disbanded Defense Forces,
she said.
   U.S. Embassy spokeswoman Jan Edmonson said she did not know
anything about the incident.
   U.S. troops have surrounded the Cuban, Nicaraguan and Libyan
embassies since the invasion to prevent Noriega's henchmen from
coming or going.
   The plane had been scheduled to carry more than 60 Cubans, among
them the 10-year-old son of ambassador Lazaro Mora, said Mrs. Faxas.
   She said Fernandez was released after two hours but the troops
remained outside the embassy ``in a really provoking way.''

   Salmonella poisoning, on the rise in the late
1980s, struck more than 1,600 people and killed 13 last year,
federal health officials reported Thursday.
   A total of 1,628 cases of salmonella enteritidis _ including 13
fatalities _ were reported through October, in 49 separate
outbreaks, the national Centers for Disease Control said. That's up
significantly from 19 outbreaks, 608 cases and one death reported
in 1985, the CDC said.
   Contaminated food was implicated in 64 percent of the 1989
outbreaks, and 73 percent of those involved eggs.
   The CDC noted that salmonella reporting has increased
dramatically in New England and the mid-Atlantic states since 1979.
   ``In regions where egg-associated salmonellosis has been
identified, the public should be advised not to eat raw or
undercooked eggs,'' the Atlanta-based CDC said in its weekly report.
   The agency said a single contaminated egg can cause outbreaks of
severe illness, with symptoms including fever, cramps and diarrhea.
Thorough cooking kills salmonella bacteria.

   Fallen Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega told a
federal judge Thursday that he is a political prisoner and refused
to enter a plea to charges he took $4.6 million to turn his nation
into a way station for the cocaine trade.
   ``General Noriega refuses to submit to the jurisdiction of this
court ... because he is a political prisoner brought to this
country illegally,'' Noriega attorney Frank Rubino told U.S.
District Judge William Hoeveler.
   The judge then entered an innocent plea for Noriega.
   Rubino said during the half-hour hearing that the general had
been told Wednesday that protection would be withdrawn as crowds
surrounded the Vatican Embassy in Panama City. He said Noriega
surrendered to avoid further bloodshed. However, the archbishop of
Panama said the surrender followed Noriega's realization he had
lost all support.
   In Washington, a senior Bush administration official said the
Vatican Embassy had been planning to order Noriega to leave at noon
on Thursday had he not surrendered to U.S. authorities. That
previously undisclosed ultimatum may have been the final straw that
prompted the surrender, the official said.
   Noriega was dressed in olive-green trousers and a khaki uniform
shirt with a general's four stars on the epaulets. He walked into
the courtroom without handcuffs or shackles. When questioned by the
judge, he stood with a military bearing, hands clasped tightly
behind him.
   He answered softly in Spanish and stared at the judge, showing
no emotion. Noriega listened to a translation of the judge's
questions through head phones, which he removed when he answered.
   U.S. marshals stood against the doors of the courtroom, which
was filled with reporters.
   The defense said the case could take nine months to prepare and
six months to try. U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen said he thought
the trial would take only two months.
   Noriega is accused of accepting $4.6 million in bribes from
Colombian drug cartels to aid and protect their smuggling and
processing _ charges that carry 145 years in prison and $1.1
million in fines.
   A bond hearing was waived until it is requested by the defense.
Noriega, who gave his age as 51 although some records indicate he
may be older, will be held without bond. He also faces drug charges
in Tampa.
   Rubino said U.S. marshals have assured that Noreiga can be made
available to defense counsel within a half-hour to an hour. Noriega
will first held at an undisclosed location in the Miami area, said
Rubino.
   Administration sources said Noriega was assured he would not be
tried under a statute that carries the death penalty for
drug-related killings. The law was passed in 1988, after his
indictment, and he has not been charged under it.
   Noriega surrendered Wednesday night to U.S. troops outside
Panama City's Vatican Embassy 10 days after he took refuge there,
and was flown into Homestead Air Force Base south of Miami under
cover of night Thursday.
   U.S. marshals with binoculars scanned the downtown area
continuously from atop the federal courthouse and patrolled halls
in plain clothes, but otherwise were inconspicuous in what Hoeveler
said was an effort to treat Noriega like any other defendant.
   Exactly a year ago, Hoeveler ruled the United States has
jurisdiction, rejecting defense claims of immunity for a head of
state. The judge said the State Department never recognized
Noriega's political legitimacy.
   Several experts in international law said Noriega has little
basis for the claims. It is not clear if such immunity exists, they
said, but if it did, Noriega probably wouldn't qualify because the
crimes he allegedly committed were not part of his official duties.
   ``As far as I know, the things Noriega is accused of doing have
nothing to do with his being a head of state,'' said Alfred Rubin,
a professor of international law at the Fletcher School of Law and
Diplomacy at Tufts University.
   Noriega co-counsel Steven Kollin has noted other potential legal
pitfalls in the case, including extreme pretrial publicity and
Noriega's links with U.S. intelligence agencies, but U.S. Attorney
General Dick Thornburgh said he was confident the case was solid.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said President Bush and
other White House officials would be careful about what they say
lest they prejudice the trial.
   Justice Department spokesman David Runkel said that Noriega was
not formally placed under arrest until the C-130 he was aboard was
taking off from Panama. Runkel said U.S. officials decided to make
the arrest in American territory.
   Noriega's surrender was met with joyous celebrations in the
streets of Panama City and Miami that continued Thursday.
   The general _ who had ruled for six years, thumbed his nose at
two U.S. presidents and annulled an election he apparently was
losing _ gave up, still wearing his military uniform, after
realizing even his supporters had turned against him, the
archbishop of Panama, Marcos McGrath, said Thursday.
   ``The people feel a sense of peace knowing that the monster is
leaving our land,'' said Panamanian President Guillermo Endara,
frequently a target of Noriega's thugs.
   The indictment against Noriega names 15 other people, including
the reputed head of the Medellin cocaine cartel, Pablo Escobar
Gaviria, who is being hunted by Colombian authorities.
   One of Noriega's right-hand men, Lt. Col. Luis del Cid,
surrendered to U.S. troops after the Dec. 20 invasion of Panama and
has pleaded innocent. Prosecutors have refused to say if he will
testify against his former boss.
   U.S. troops who seized Noriega's military headquarters in Panama
City reportedly found documents and files supporting the
prosecution case.
   That, along with the arrests of del Cid and others, has made the
case stronger, said Richard Gregorie, who headed the investigation
until he left the U.S. attorney's office a year ago.
   President Bush on Thursday sent Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to plan the withdrawal of U.S. combat
troops. Some 25,000 remain in Panama.
   Panamanian exiles here celebrated Noriega's fall, illustrated by
a plane flying above the courthouse towing a banner that said ``Bye
Bye, Tony.''
   ``For all Panamanians, this is one of the final chapters,'' said
Aurelio Barria, head of the Noriega opposition until he was forced
into exile in 1988. ``But he still has to answer for what he did in
Panama.''
   Gen. Maxwell Thurman, commanding general of U.S. forces in
Panama, said Noriega's surrender ``completes the fourth of our four
objectives'' in invading Panama in Operation Just Cause. The
others, he said, were to protect American lives, safeguard the
Panama Canal treaties and restore democracy to Panama.
   According to authorities, about 290 Panamanian soldiers, 300
civilians, 23 U.S. troops and three American civilians died in the
invasion.
   Fitzwater said Bush was ``gratified this operation was completed
in such a successful fashion.''
   Bush had called Pope John Paul II ``to thank him for the
distinguished efforts of the Vatican and the papal nuncio in
Panama'' in getting Noriega to surrender.

   Vladimir Ussachevsky, a composer and teacher who
collaborated in the first electronic musical works performed in the
United States, died Thursday of a brain tumor.
   Ussachevsky, who was 78, died in Calvary Hospital in the Bronx,
according to a statement from Columbia University.
   Ussachevsky, who taught at Columbia from 1947 until his
retirement in 1980, started experimenting with electronic, or
synthesized, music in 1951.
   On May 9, 1954, a work he composed for tape recorder was
performed in the first demonstration of electronic music in the
country.
   His work and that of Columbia professor Otto Luening attracted
attention on Oct. 28 of that year when introduced by conductor
Leopold Stokowski in a concert of music for tape recorder at the
Museum of Modern Art.
   In 1959, Ussachevsky helped establish the Columbia University
Electronic Music Center, the first music organization devoted
entirely to composition and research of electronic music.
   Ussachevsky was born Nov. 3, 1911, to Russian parents in
Manchuria. He came to the United States in 1930 and earned an
undergraduate degree at Pomona College in California in 1935. He
earned his Masters degree and Ph.D. at the Eastman School of Music.
   Ussachevsky was married to Elizabeth Denison Kray, who died in
1987. He is survived by a niece, Alla Stewart Du Vall of Chico,
Calif.

   That, and the constant calls he made for the lower class to
rally against the U.S.-oriented oligarchy, were enough to create
stiff resistance that flashed into the fear, if for a few days,
that the United States had stepped into a guerrilla war.
   But in the end he was alone, separated from his lover and from
his wife and three of his daughters, who sought refuge inside the
Cuban Embassy. Many of his cronies and friends were scattered in
embassies throughout the capital.
   There was no reservoir of faith or affection, the kind that
allowed Cardinal Josef Mindszenty of Hungary to resist Communist
rule and stomach 15 years in a U.S. Embassy. He could feel none of
the loyalty that Chinese dissident Fang Lizhi commands in the U.S.
Embassy in Beijing, an exile that has lasted seven months so far.
   The last day of Noriega's stay inside the mission was perhaps
the loneliest, as 20,000 people filled the streets and shouted
``Assassin!'' ``No more!'' and ``Out of the nunciature!''
   They hanged his effigy. Clad in military garb, Noriega's face
was made out of a pineapple, a reminder of the acne scars that gave
him the nickname ``pineapple face.'' Often during his 10 days in
the embassy, angry Panamanians smashed pineapples to yellow pulp in
the street.
   If he had any supporters, they were silent.
   ``He saw himself as something of an emperor in this part of the
world, and I think that dream has been shattered,'' said Archbishop
Marcos McGrath on ABC's ``Nightline.''
   Shrouded by palm trees, the gates of the Vatican embassy opened
and closed Wednesday. The papal nuncio, in his long white robe, a
crucifix dangling from his neck, came in and out, talking to U.S.
Army officials.
   Panamanian sources said one of Noriega's last conversations was
with his longtime mistress Vickie Amado. The U.S. Southern Command
had tried to convince her to lure Noriega out.
   But she didn't. The sources said that during a 10-minute
conversation, she told him, ``The decision is in your hands.''
   Gen. Maxwell Thurman, head of the Southern Command, agreed:
``People have to make up their own minds.''
   The man who survived two coup attempts and humiliated the United
States eventually made his decision, under pressure.
   Villanueva said the Vatican told Noriega it was preparing to
lift its own diplomatic immunity to allow Panamanian security
forces to enter the embassy and capture ``a highly dangerous
criminal.''
   Despite the submachine gun he had brought into the embassy, and
despite his image as a man who would rather die than surrender,
Noriega decided not to go down shooting.
   He made few demands: phone calls, that his surrender be kept
secret until it was time, to wear his uniform one last time.
   Thurman said Noriega's coffee-colored uniform was brought to him
because he didn't have it with him.
   He reportedly talked to his wife, Felicidad, who was in the
Cuban Embassy. Sources in the Dominican Republic said she and the
couple's three daughters would join a fourth daughter married to a
military officer in Santo Domingo.
   In Washington, officials said Noriega was assured he would not
face the death penalty.
   Just before he left, he got a hug from Lt. Col. Nivaldo
Madrinan, who was himself to surrender Thursday. Noriega bid
farewell to the former head of his secret police just inside the
mission's big wooden door.
   ``Madrinan came to attention and saluted militarily,'' said
Villanueva. ``Then they embraced.''

   With the dictator gone and the wild
celebrations over, Panamanians on Thursday tried to start
rebuilding their country, battered by more than $2 billion in
damage from the U.S. invasion and burdened by six years of despotic
rule.
   Still, the joy here seemed boundless.
   ``We are too happy,'' said Reynaldo de Gracia, a night watchman
who witnessed the revelry in the capital Wednesday night after word
spread that Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega had surrendered to U.S.
troops.
   Noriega's transfer to Florida to face federal drug trafficking
charges ended a brutal reign that had intimidated this nation of
2.2. million people since 1983.
   ``Down to the small kids, everybody knew he is a criminal,''
said truck driver Crispiniano Avila. ``We don't want to see him
ever again. Not even in a painting.''
   Avila was part of the wild singing, drinking, chanting, kissing,
horn-blowing and pot-banging that took over the streets until the
wee hours Thursday. The scene recalled nothing so much as the
Munchkins' ecstasy at the death of the wicked witch in ``The Wizard
of Oz.''
   ``The guy was a danger and a burden to the country. He had the
whole nation knotted up, wasting away,'' said de Gracia.
   Panamanians are still trying to figure out just how much harm
Noriega caused.
   The economy, hobbled by American sanctions designed to get rid
of Noriega, suffered another blow from the widespread looting and
vandalism during the American Dec. 20 invasion.
   Economiss are trying to total the damage, but estimates run to
more than $2 billion in an economy that shrank by 18 percent last
year.
   In recent years, millions of dollars were sent out of the
country for safe-keeping as Panama's banking system began to crack.
Panamanian funds were frozen in the United States and government
income such as Panama Canal fees have been held in escrow.
   Guillermo Ford, who is planning minister as well as second vice
president, said his agency hopes to quantify damage to the economy
in the next few days.
   If Noriega was unaware of his unpopularity, the misconception
could not have survived Wednesday afternoon. The deposed leader sat
isolated in a small room at the Vatican mission where he was holed
up for 10 days, fleeing thousands of U.S. troops who invaded the
country Dec. 20.
   The walls of his room could muffle but not block out the
thunderous chant of 20,000 people outside clamoring for his head.
   Cruzada Civilista, the coalition that ran opposition candidates
during Noriega's time _ including Guillermo Endara, Panama's new
president _ called the demonstration and then tried to cancel it
because of ``security concerns.'' But the people showed up anyway,
to let Noriega know how their felt about him.
   ``He was cornered,'' said Roman Catholic Archbishop Marcos
McGrath.
   He also was unwelcome.
   The Vatican Embassy had told Noriega it would lift its
diplomatic immunity and ask Panamanian security forces to come into
the mission to arrest him if he did not leave voluntarily, a
spokesman said Thursday.
   Rev. Javier Villanueva, assistant to Papal Nuncio Monsignor
Sebastian Laboa, said Noriega was not given a deadline, but the
position was made clear to him.
   He said the Vatican would not have lifted diplomatic immunity on
anyone taking sanctuary for political resasons.
   ``But this man is a highly dangerous criminal,'' he said.
   Maj. Gen. Marc Cisneros, commander of the U.S. Army South,
confirmed that Noriega kept a submachine gun under his bed during
his stay at the nunciature, which would have made it difficult for
the unarmed staff at the Vatican mission to evict him.
   Gen. Maxwell Thurman, head of the U.S. Southern Command, said
Thursday that the demonstration was a key factor in Noriega's
decision to turn himself in.
   Also Thursday, Lt. Col. Nivaldo Madrinan, a top Noriega adviser
and head of his secret police, walked out of the embassy and
surrendered to U.S. troops.
   In Managua, Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega said Thusday the
U.S. troops should leave Panama at once because they achieved their
goal of capturing Noriega _ ``so there isn't a single reason for
the Yankees to remain in Panama, not one more moment.''
   In the meantime, the cleanup continues.
   U.S. Army engineers are bulldozing blocks of the the poor El
Chorrillo district, which was heavily damaged and in some cases
leveled.
   Thousands of people displaced by the fighting went to a camp in
a baseball stadium, but most have relocated with relatives.
   Many of the slums destroyed were barracks built to house Panama
Canal laborers at the turn of the century, and were never meant to
last more than a dozen years.
   American delegations are arriving here to examine, among other
things, what the United States can or should do to help but nobody
is discussing specific numbers yet.
   Money is dribbling back in. About $70 million in frozen funds
has been thawed, but about $300 million more remains blocked in
accounts frozen by economic sanctions imposed nearly two years ago.
   Millions of dollars of Noriega's money also has been taken over
and given to the government.
   But insurance companies said they will not honor claims for
losses because of a war clause in the policies.
   Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger said in Panama
Wednesday the United States feels no responsibility to businesses
that were looted, and therefore is not obligated to make good on
the losses.

   Elie Wiesel remembered fellow Nobel Peace
laureate Andrei Sakharov on Thursday as the ``godfather'' of
perestroika and glasnost at a memorial service for the Soviet
dissident.
   ``It is possible for one person to say no to evil, and in doing
so, render it vulnerable,'' said Wiesel. ``He taught his
contemporaries that every human being is unique.''
   Wiesel, the American writer and death camp survivor who won the
1986 Nobel for his human rights campaign emphasizing the Nazi
Holocaust, was among the speakers Thursday at the New York Public
Library service.
   Sakharov, a human rights activist and a physicist who created
the Soviet hydrogen bomb, died Dec. 14 at age 68.
   He won the Nobel in 1975, but the Soviet leadership at the time
refused to let him go to Norway to accept it. He was banished in
1980 to what Wiesel termed ``prolonged, horrifying, ugly'' internal
exile after calling for the withdrawal of Soviet troops from
Afghanistan. President Mikhail S. Gorbachev allowed him freedom of
movement in December 1986.
   Robert L. Bernstein, chairman of the U.S. Helsinki Watch who
published much of Sakharov's writings, said he was sad that
Sakharov did not live to see the publication of his latest book,
which is scheduled for next spring.
   ``His was the strongest voice in the world for individual
rights,'' said Bernstein.
   ``In a short time, he was really able to change things around,''
said Alexey Semyonov, son of Elena Bonner, the dissident's wife.
   In 1981, Bonner and Sakharov's wife went on a hunger strike to
convince Soviet authorities to allow Semyonov's wife to emigrate to
the United States.
   ``He has changed, it seems, the way people in the Soviet Union
look at things ... what is important and how it can be achieved,''
Semyonov said.
   The service was organized by the International League for Human
Rights, a private group that works to end torture, disappearances,
religious intolerance, censorship and other human rights abuses.
Sakharov became honorary president of the group's Moscow affiliate
in 1970.

<HEAD>General: USSR's Military Doctrine Has Changed to Defensive Posture</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union has shifted its military
doctrine from an offensive posture to a strictly defensive one, a
high-ranking Soviet military planner said Thursday.
   The definition of Soviet military doctrine now includes
prevention of war and civil defense, Lt. Gen. Herman Starodubov
said Thursday at the opening session of a two-day arms control
symposium sponsored by Texas A&amp;M University's Mosher Institute for
Defense Studies.
   The conference, ``Arms Control Problems and Prospects 1990,''
has brought together negotiators and policy-makers involved in top
arms control negotiations.
   ``We are consciously putting ourselves at a disadvantage by
being defensive and turning over the military initiative to any
adversary,'' said Starodubov, deputy operations director for the
Soviet general staff.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has previously heralded a
shift to a defensive posture by proposing deep cuts in conventional
and nuclear arms. In May 1987, the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact announced
a new military doctrine of ``reasonable sufficiency,'' which
stipulates that a country needs only enough military might to repel
an assailant.
   American and Western European officials, however, questioned
whether any army could be used strictly as a defensive tool.
Nuclear weapons in Europe may be needed to ensure coexistence, they
said.
   Gen. Edward Meyer, former U.S. Army Chief of Staff and moderator
of the conference, said the challenge before the military on both
sides is to define doctrines and strategy.
   ``The opportunity is now on the military's side to make a
difference. There will be great political and economic pressure to
make those changes,'' he said.
   While Starodubov called for a ``nuclear-free, democratic''
world, Jean Felix-Paganon, the diplomatic adviser to the French
minister of defense, stressed French security would continue to
depend on nuclear weapons.
   ``Nuclear weapons are not weapons of war,'' Felix-Paganon said.

<HEAD>Boeing Will Deliver Air Force One in September, 2 Years Late</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new Air Force One jet will be delivered to
President Bush Sept. 30, almost two years late largely because of
efforts to make it resistant to a nuclear explosion, Boeing said
Thursday.
   Boeing, which has been building two modified 747 jumbo jets for
the president's use, originally promised a new Air Force One would
be ready in November 1988, or in time to take former President
Reagan home to California when his term ended.
   Boeing Military Airplanes spokeswoman Carolyn Russell in
Wichita, Kan., said the original delivery was revised to November
1989 as design modifications slowed the production schedule.
   A second, backup Air Force One plane is expected to be delivered
from the Wichita plant by early 1991, Boeing said.
   Progress on the planes was burdened by Boeing efforts to equip
the plane with wiring that could withstand a nuclear blast, the
company said.
   When about 70 percent of the planes' wiring was complete, Boeing
engineers foresaw that the rest of the wiring wouldn't fit and
about 20 percent had to be removed and replaced, Russell said.
   The Air Force told Congress in 1988 that the planes' cost had
soared to $385 million over budget. Russell would not confirm that
estimate or comment on the planes' final cost.
   Boeing signed a fixed-cost contract with the U.S. Air Force to
deliver both planes for $250 million. That price was later revised
to about $266 million, the News Tribune of Tacoma, Wash., reported.

<HEAD>Mrs. Bush Gets Second Dose of Radiation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   First lady Barbara Bush on Thursday underwent
the second of 10 radiation treatments for eye irritation caused by
her immune system disease.
   The 64-year-old first lady received the 10-minute radiation dose
early in the morning at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. She
suffered no after-effects and returned to the White House for her
normal daily activities, said her press secretary, Anna Perez.
   That included an afternoon tea for people involved with a
Washington home for the infirm with which Mrs. Bush has long been
associated.
   She is undergoing 10 consecutive days of radiation treatments in
hopes of eliminating swelling behind her eyes that has caused her
double vision and tearing for months.
   The eye problem results from Graves disease, a condition in
which the thyroid gland becomes overactive. An earlier radioactive
treatment and drugs rendered the thyroid inactive.
   Treatment with a powerful steroid, prednisone, has failed to
correct the eye disorder, however, so doctors are using
low-intensity radiation, aimed at swelling in the small muscles
that control the eyes, as the next therapy.
   Aides say the first lady is otherwise perky and has not had to
curtail her activities because of the disease, which was initially
diagnosed last winter.

<HEAD>Zurich Attorney's Office Agrees in Principle to Unfreeze Funds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Zurich district attorney's office
has agreed to transfer to the Philippines about $260 million
reportedly stashed in banks here by Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos, an
official said Thursday.
   But district attorney Peter Cosandey said the funds would remain
frozen in Zurich pending Manila's completion of criminal procedings
against the Marcos clan, and so are unlikely to be returned to the
Philippines in the ``foreseeable future.''
   Cosandey said the district attorney's office in three recent
rulings had agreed to an April 1986 request from Manila to hand
over documents relating to the Marcos funds.
   The documents are held by Lichtenstein-based foundations
administered by the late dictator or his wife, he said.
   Marcos lawyers already have lodged an appeal against a December
ruling and are expected to appeal two more recent ones, Cosandey
said.
   In an interview on the German-language news program, Tageschau,
Cosandey said the appeal procedure in Swiss courts was likely to
last at least a year.
   He said release of the funds depends on judicial procedings in
the Philippines. So far, Manila has not filed criminal charges
against the Marcos clan.
   President Corazon Aquino's government has claimed that Marcos
plundered up to $10 billion in government funds during his 20-year
reign. Manila authorities allege hundreds of millions of dollars in
ill-gotten wealth are stashed in Swiss banks.
   The Swiss government froze assets held by Marcos and his
associates in March 1986, shortly after he was ousted, pending
complex procedings in Zurich and two other cantons, Geneva and
Fribourg.
   About $45 million of alleged Marcos funds are frozen in Fribourg
banks and a further $6 million in Geneva.
   Authorities slapped a similar ``precautionary'' freeze Dec. 24
on any Swiss assets of the deposed Romanian leader Nicolae
Ceausescu, who was executed Christmas Day.

<TEXT>
   A man whose cries for help over his car phone led
police to where he and his pregnant wife had been shot threw
himself to his death off a Boston Harbor bridge Thursday after he
became a suspect in her slaying.
   ``Basically, it's fair to say, he could not handle the
allegations or statements made about him,'' Suffolk County
Prosecutor Newman Flanagan said, describing a suicide note found in
Charles Stuart's car at the bridge.
   Stuart was implicated by his brother, who went to police
Wednesday because Stuart apparently was identifying an innocent man
as his assailant, the brother's attorney said Thursday.
   Flanagan said he ordered police to arrest Stuart in his wife's
killing. But police could not find him and no arrest warrant had
been issued.
   Stuart, 29, had told police that he and his wife, Carol, who was
seven months pregnant, were shot by a robber who commandeered their
car after they left a childbirth class at a hospital Oct. 23. Their
son was delivered by Caesarean section but died 17 days later.
   Flanagan said Stuart's account ``is not true.'' He said the case
was still active and other people were being questioned, but he
gave no details.
   Officials said Stuart apparently knew he was a suspect. Police
in his hometown of Reading, a Boston suburb, had watched his home
overnight, but he did not go there, and police didn't find him
before he jumped off the 300-foot Tobin Bridge over the Boston
Harbor. His death was ruled a drowning.
   At a news conference Thursday, Flanagan confirmed that his
office was contacted Wednesday by a lawyer for one of Stuart's two
brothers. Police spoke with the brother and then obtained
statements from other relatives and friends.
   Flanagan said the new evidence included Mrs. Stuart's engagement
ring.
   ``After careful review of this new evidence, I instructed Boston
police homicide detectives to arrest Charles Stuart for the
murder,'' he said.
   Attorney John Perenyi said Stuart's brother, Matthew, 23, came
to him early in December with his suspicions.
   According to Perenyi, Matthew Stuart said that on the night of
the shooting, his brother asked him to meet him near the hospital
and that he would pass a bag to him through the car window. Matthew
Stuart said he took the bag, which contained a snub-nosed revolver.
   Asked if Matthew Stuart saw Mrs. Stuart, Perenyi said: ``That's
a very difficult question, because Matthew did not expect to see
her and did not see her. But he thought he saw something in the
front seat of his brother's car.''
   Perenyi said, ``It would seem to have been inevitable that Chuck
had to have been shot at that time.''
   A search of the Pines River in Stuart's parents' hometown of
Revere on Thursday turned up the bag which included a Gucci bag,
wallet, makeup and other of Mrs. Stuart's personal belongings. The
gun, which Matthew Stuart said was disposed of separately, is
missing.
   Matthew Stuart ``was really at a loss to give me a motive,''
Perenyi said in a telephone interview. ``He didn't think his
brother was into gambling, drinking or other women.''
   In recent weeks, police had several times discounted rumors that
Stuart could have been involved.
   ``I would say the whole town is shocked. They were portrayed as
a model couple,'' said Wally Arsenault, a restaurant manager in
Reading.
   John Vajdic, who lives across the street from the Stuarts'
slate-blue home, said: ``At this point, I still don't know what to
believe. I still wonder what is the truth.''
   The shootings of the prosperous suburban couple _ he a fur store
manager and salesman, she a 30-year-old lawyer _ in an inner-city
neighborhood drew cries of outrage about city violence from around
the country, as well as charges from blacks and others that the
outrage was spurred in part by racism.
   Stuart's dramatic call to police on a car phone after the
shootings was widely broadcast. It took police about 10 minutes to
figure out where he was, from clues such as the sound of sirens
over Stuart's car telephone.
   Stuart had been shot in the abdomen, his wife in the head.
   At one point, dispatcher Gary McLaughlin said, ``OK, Chuck,
help's going to be on the way, bear with me! Is your wife
breathing?''
   ``She's still gurgling,'' Stuart cried. ``There's a busy street
up ahead. Ahh, man, I can't see where I am!''
   McLaughlin patiently tried to coax Stuart into identifying some
building or street near his car, and at another point said: ``You
can't blank out on me, I need you, man. Chuck? Chuck?''
   ``Oh man, it hurts and my wife has stopped gurgling, she's
stopped breathing!'' Stuart replied.
   Stuart wrote a statement for his wife's funeral in which he
said, ``For us to truly believe, we must know that (God's) will was
done and that there was some right in this meanest of acts. In our
souls, we must forgive this sinner because he would too.'' The
couple had been married four years.
   Among those at the funeral were Gov. Michael Dukakis and Mayor
Raymond Flynn.
   Shortly before Christmas, Stuart viewed a lineup. While
officials refused to say whether an identification was made, news
reports said Stuart had indicated that William Bennett, a man with
a long police record, could be the assailant.
   On Thursday, prosecutors publicly cleared Bennett.
   Perenyi said Matthew Stuart came to him after the lineup.
   ``What he told me, when the brother identified Mr. Bennett as
the assailant, that sort of pushed Matthew over the brink,''
Perenyi said.
   A man answering the telephone at the suburban home of Michael
Stuart, Stuart's other brother, said the family had no comment.
   Mrs. Stuart's father, Giusto DiMaiti, was taken to a hospital
Thursday morning with an undisclosed ailment but was released after
an examination.
   In the hours after the first news reports of Thursday's
developments, some still refused to believe Stuart could have had
anything to do with the shootings.
   One neighbor wailed that, if Stuart had indeed killed himself,
he ``just wanted to be with'' his dead wife and child.

   The selection of former President Ronald
Reagan for the NCAA's highest honor has spurred several female
delegates to organize a protest at next week's convention in Dallas.
   University of Texas women's athletic director Donna Lopiano says
she and others who will be at the convention believe Reagan set
back the women's athletic movement during his eight years in the
White House.
   ``As far as opportunities for women, as far as minority
opportunities during Reagan's administration, they weren't very
good. In fact, they were awful,'' Lopiano told the Austin
American-Statesman.
   ``There will be a very low-key protest, but a very well
warranted one,'' she said.
   The National Collegiate Athletic Association plans to meet in
Dallas Sunday through Tuesday to discuss new legislation and to
honor Reagan with the Teddy Award, named for former President
Theodore Roosevelt.
   The award, presented since 1967, is given to a ``distinguished
citizen of national reputation and outstanding accomplishment,''
according to NCAA spokesman Jim Marchiony.
   Carol Mann, a member of the Ladies Professional Golfers
Association Hall of Fame, resigned from the awards committee
because Reagan was selected. Other members have said they won't
attend Monday's banquet, where Reagan is to be honored.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Far Eastern manufacturers have been dumping
certain machine tools, small business telephone systems and door
locks in U.S. markets, the Commerce Department said Thursday.
   ``Dumping'' is the sale of products at less than what the
department determines is ``fair value.'' It can lead to imposition
of duties to offset the ``dumping margin,'' the amount by which the
price of the product fails to meet the ``fair value'' test, if the
International Trade Commission finds that the affected U.S.
industry is being hurt by the practice.
   The commission now has 45 days to decide that issue.
   The determinations Thursday were for:
   _Automatic metal-forming machine tools with multiple die
stations, known as mechanical transfer presses, from Japan. Some
$109 million were sold in the United States in 1988. The department
said dumping margins ranged from 7.49 percent to 15.16 percent.
   The ruling was in response to a petition filed in behalf of the
U.S. industry by the Verson Division of Allied Products Corp., the
United Auto Workers and the United Steel Workers of America.
   _Small business telephone systems and subassemblies from South
Korea, of which $227 million worth were imported in 1988. Dumping
margins ranged from 13.4 percent to 15.85 percent.
   The ruling was sought by two competing U.S. manufacturers,
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. and Comdial Corp.
   _House door locks and parts from Taiwan, of which the United
States imported $49.5 million worth from Taiwan in 1988. The
department said dumping margins were 1.27 percent to 17.75 percent.
   The ruling was sought by the U.S. Ad Hoc Committee of Door Lock
Manufacturers.

   Twelve sailors and a Marine were honored
Thursday for their bravery in fighting a fire that raged aboard the
battleship USS Iowa following an explosion that killed 47 sailors
last year.
   The men were the last of 43 servicemen to be honored for their
actions in the April 1989 disaster.
   Capt. Fred P. Moosally, commander of the battleship, presented
the awards aboard the ship with the 16-inch guns of ill-fated
turret No. 2 looming in the background.
   ``I have said before hundreds of heroes were born on the morning
of April 19 ... the actions of this crew made it possible for us to
recover from this tragedy. All did the jobs they were trained to do
despite the darkness, the heavy smoke and heat, and saved our
ship,'' he said.
   The explosion inside turret No. 2 killed 47 sailors manning the
three 16-inch guns and those in the decks below handling
projectiles and powder. The explosion occurred as the turret was
preparing to fire its guns.
   On the starboard bridge wing was Marine Capt. John A. Brush, 27,
of Columbus, Ohio. Brush, then a lieutenant, was relaying the
firing orders for the turret when the blast shook the ship.
   Brush rushed down the gangways to the turret. Rescuers were
unable to get to the main hatch because of the turret's position.
Instead, a smaller, nearly inaccessible hatch was forced open.
   The Marine immediately began hoisting firefighters up into the
turret.
   ``There was a lot of smoke and heat coming out. The turret was
still blazing. We were just trying to get people into the turret,''
he said.
   For his actions, Brush was awarded the Navy and Marine Corps
Medal.
   Nine sailors also received the Navy and Marine Corps Medal,
including Gunner's Mate John M. Mullahy Jr. of Randolph, Mass.
Mullahy was one of 11 sailors stationed in the turret's magazine
who survived the explosion.
   According to his citation, Mullahy went into the lowest section
of the turret to activate the turret's sprinkler system to prevent
a secondary explosion. Mullahy then carried one of his shipmates to
safety before returning to the turret to remove burning powder bags
from the dark and water-filled space.
   Two others received the Navy Commendation Medal.
   The 13th man, Chief Warrant Officer Samuel McGovern, 40, of
Beaumont, Texas, received the Meritorious Service Medal for
directing the firefighters and leading the damage control
operations for 32 continuous hours. It was the highest of the 43
awards given to Iowa servicemen.
   A Navy investigation of the explosion said it was ``most
likely'' was caused by sabatoge by a disgruntled gunner's mate who
died in the explosion.
   Families of some of the Iowa victims and members of Congress
have challenged the validity of the Navy's report.
   Moosally also unveiled a bronze plaque dedicated to the men who
died in the explosion. The plaque will be mounted on the side of
turret No. 2.

<TEXT>
   A Soviet spokesman on Thursday likened to ``lynch
law'' the expected U.S. trial of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega and
said that even a conviction would not justify the U.S. invasion of
Panama.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said the trial
will involve ``a violation of the rights of the government of
Panama, a violation of the principles of non-intervention of the
charter of the United Nations.''
   ``No state has the right to take the law into its own hands,''
he told reporters. ``That's basically lynch law.''
   Panamanian dictator Noriega surrendered to U.S. authorities in
Panama City on Wednesday and was flown to Miami, where he faces
drug-trafficking charges.
   Gerasimov questioned whether an American court had the right to
try Noriega and said the United States violated international law
by invading Panama last month and now removing Noriega for trial.
   ``From the outside,'' Gerasimov said, Noriega's capture looked
like government vengeance against a former CIA agent who got away.
   He said it appeared that the real issue at stake in the American
intervention was trying to hold onto the Panama Canal, which is due
to revert to Panamanian control in the year 2000.
   He added that even if Noriega is found guilty of drug
trafficking, armed intervention is still ``not how things should be
done. That's not how the struggle with drug business should be
waged.''

   Ethiopian rebels kept up an offensive that
has seen their greatest gains in a 14-year insurgency and claimed
on Thursday that they ``put out of action'' 1,536 soldiers in
recent fighting.
   The rebels also said they shot down a MiG-23 fighter jet and
damaged a helicopter during a government air raid that inflicted
heavy casualties on Debre Tabor, a garrison town in Gonder province
recently captured by the Tigre People's Liberation Army.
   The rebels, fighting in conjunction with the much smaller
Ethiopian People's Democratic Movement, said the government
suffered the losses Saturday in a three-pronged guerrilla attack to
the southwest, west and northwest of Debre Tabor.
   In a clandestine radio broadcast monitored in Nairobi, the Tigre
rebels reported 1,465 troopers killed or wounded and 71 captured.
They also claimed to have captured weapons and destroyed two tanks
and seven vehicles.
   The broadcast did not mention rebel or civilian casualties.
   Reporters are denied access to the region and it is impossible
to verify the reports independently.
   The rebels said earlier that they killed, captured or wounded
more than 8,000 soldiers in capturing Debre Tabor and three other
towns, including one 70 miles from the capital, Addis Ababa.
   The rebels since August have made their greatest gains since
taking up arms in 1975 in an uprising seeking the ouster of Marxist
President Mengistu Haile Mariam and greater autonomy for their
province.
   They now control Tigre and have made significant advances into
Wollo, Gonder and Shoa provinces to the south and the west.
   The government faces an even older insurgency in the
northernmost province of Eritrea where rebels have been fighting a
secessionist war for 28 years.

   A federal task force is recommending a wide

offshore sites near Florida and California and none of the choices
would ban drilling altogether, according to administration sources.
   The task force report was to go to the White House today,
according to Interior Department officials who said it would not be

   Sources familiar with the recommendations said Wednesday the
options for the leases off the California coast would envision oil
and gas development, but in some cases include specific conditions,
restrictions and various timetables.
   The task force adopted more restrictive options for the lease
off the Florida coast, according to one source, including one that
could delay development for several years because of environmental

   A study showing that global warming could speed
the destruction of forests by fire and windstorms suggests
noticeable change could occur in the Earth's forests by early in
the next century, a researcher said.
   ``The rate of change will be faster than we thought before,''
said Jonathan Overpeck, the study's principal author.
   The change will be marked by the appearance of fast-growing
species of trees in areas where mature trees have been destroyed,
said Overpeck, a staff scientist at the Lamont-Doherty Geological
Observatory in Palisades.
   Previous computer projections have shown that changes in
temperature and rainfall could affect the growth of forests. This
is the first to show that physical destruction of trees will play a
significant role in changing forests as the Earth warms, Overpeck
said.

<HEAD>Samaritans Caught Between Israelis and Palestinians</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELLEN SCHECHET</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOUNT GERIZIM, Occupied West Bank (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Samaritans, known
mainly for Jesus' parable of the Good Samaritan, use a Hebrew
saying to describe their lives in the midst of the Palestinian
uprising against Israeli rule.
   They say it's like being caught ``between a hammer and an
anvil.'' Americans would call it trapped between a rock and a hard
place.
   In any language, it means uncomfortable.
   About 275 Samaritans, whose day-to-day language is Arabic, live
on Mount Gerizim or in nearby Nablus, a Moslem Arab town of 120,000
which has been a focal point of anti-Israeli unrest in the uprising.
   An equal number of Samaritans speak Hebrew and live in Holon, a
Jewish city of 144,000 just south of Tel Aviv.
   ``In Nablus, there are those who understand what the Samaritans
are, and say we always have lived with them. And there are those
who say we are Jewish,'' said Itamar Cohen, seated behind the
counter of his small grocery, the only shop on the mountain.
   ``But with all this, we are not Jews, and we are not Moslems. We
have our own religion,'' said Cohen, 52, who also works for the
Israeli government as a guide to the historical sites here.
   The Samaritan religion is an offshoot of Judaism. The Samaritans
claim to be descendants of three of the 12 tribes of ancient Israel
and believe that Mount Gerizim, not Jerusalem, is the place chosen
by God for the true temple.
   Although Smaritans base their faith on the Old Testament,
they're best known for an account in the New Testament (Luke
10:30-37) of the tale told by Jesus to fellow Jews about the Good
Samaritan.
   At that time, Jews resented Samaritans as distorting the faith.
Jesus' story was about a Samaritan who helped an injured Jew
ignored by passing Jewish priests _ the Samaritan thus proving
himself a good neighbor.
   Samaritan Scripture, a mixture of ancient Hebrew and Aramaic,
consists of their version of the first five books of Moses. The
Samaritans consider Moses to be the sole prophet of God. While they
celebrate most of the same holidays as the Jews, many of their
rituals are profoundly different, including the slaughter of
sacrificial lambs on Mount Gerizim during Passover.
   ``Our goal is to continue our lives until the end of the world.
We believe in the resurrection of the dead,'' Cohen said.
   But the Samaritans say _ quietly, cautiously, nervously _ that
they are increasingly having trouble assuring their survival as a
result of the nearly two-year-old Palestinian uprising.
   Several Samaritan homes in Nablus were burned last fall during
the Jewish and Samaritan holiday of Sukkot, which commemorates the
desert wandering of the Israelites during the Exodus. Nablus
leaders have condemned the attacks and promised compensation, the
Samaritans say.
   Most Nablus Samaritans are employed by the West Bank military
government.
   Zevolon Altif, 60, a retired high school English teacher, said
about 10 in the transportation and tax offices received telephone
threats from Palestinians ordering them to quit. Two army cars now
take them to and from work.
   ``It is not good for them to go in an army car in front of the
surrounding population. At the same time, we don't know how to get
out of this problem. They want to leave their work, but they can't
earn their living any other way,'' Altif said.
   Until the uprising began, Altif and most Samaritans from Nablus
lived on Mount Gerizim for only two months in the summer and during
the three major religious holidays.
   Now, as a result of the increasing violence and army-imposed
curfews, they are staying on the mountain as much as possible.
   Because of the uprising, few Holon Samaritans join relatives on
Mount Gerizim except for holidays or celebrations, although all
have homes there, said Israel Sedaka, 57, of Holon, who works for
Israel's state commemorative coin office in Jerusalem.
   ``Since the intefadeh (uprising), we only go when there's no
choice,'' Sedaka said. ``There's a road that you can drive without
going through the city and placing yourself in danger.''
   Although the Samaritans do not consider themselves Jews and are
not considered to be Jews by the Israeli rabbinate, the Samaritans
of Holon go to Jewish schools and serve in the Israeli army.
   The Samaritans of Nablus study in Arab schools and do not serve
in the military. Some learned Hebrew after the 1967 Six-Day War,
and many now choose between a Hebrew or an Arabic first name,
depending on the listener.
   ``We were two parts of the same nation. Because of that, some
people are suspicious,'' Altif said.

   The United Church of Christ, based in New York
City since the denomination was formed by merger in 1957, opened
its new headquarters here Jan. 2.
   Three top officers and skeleton crews of several national
agencies have shifted work here. Three floors of the headquarters
building at 700 Prospect Ave. are being renovated to provide
working space for about 90 employes.
   Further renovations start in March. Altogether, national offices
of the 1.6 million-member denomination have about 350 employes,
most of them based in New York City.
   The two largest agencies are remaining there through 1990, the
board for homeland ministries and board for world ministries, but
will began shifting some personnel to Cleveland in 1991.
   The move from New York City to Cleveland was voted in July by
the church's legislative general synod.
   Among officers who have already shifted to the new site is the
denomination's president, the Rev. Paul Sherry.

   Nearly five years ago, drug thugs in Mexico
kidnapped Drug Enforcement Administration agent Enrique ``Kiki''
Camarena in daylight near the U.S. Consulate in Guadalajara. They
tortured him, then beat him to death.
   On Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, NBC's ``Drug Wars: The Camarena
Story'' is telling his story and that of his DEA colleagues who
fought the good fight despite cover-ups by Mexican officials and
Washington foot-dragging.
   With Cuban-born Steven Bauer as Camarena and Craig T. Nelson as
his drawling, emotional local-level boss, ``Drug Wars'' is a superb
piece of work, filled with excellent ensemble acting. It's richly
textured and well-directed.
   It has flaws, the most serious of them the use of clips from
``NBC Nightly News'' _ specifically anchor Tom Brokaw's prefaces to
news reports on the drug war in Mexico, Camarena's slaying and the
return of the agent's body for burial in Calexico, Calif.
   That's in a show that also has actors playing TV reporters and
cameramen covering various parts of the drug war story, including
the moment in which Nelson screams at a corrupt federale officer at
the rancho where Camarena'dvertisements featuring Trump's endorsement will
begin appearing in business magazines this spring.
   Silver said Trump's lawyers usually pounce on any attempt to use
the Trump name, and ``we haven't lost a case.'' Trump said in his
letter to Zito that he decided to join forces with PCL instead of
fighting it because he examined the photo business cards and liked
them.
   Silver said Trump has some of the cards with his photo on them
but wasn't sure if he was using them regularly.
   ``I can't tell you if he hands them out to everyone,'' Silver
said. ``He's never had a business card before, so I imagine that's
his business card.''

<HEAD>And Now: Lebanon's Civil War Becomes Board Game</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Now Lebanese can become ``militia
leaders,'' and with the roll of the dice, kidnap foreigners,
misappropriate public funds, bribe army generals, shell city
centers during rush hour and run lucrative rackets.
   Lebanon's civil war has become a board game, thanks to bookstore
owner Naji Tueini.
   Tueini, a 32-year-old Christian, said he got the idea for the
game he calls ``Civil War'' and costs $23 while he was stuck in his
bomb shelter during the six-month artillery war between Christian
and Syrian forces last year.
   ``I created it to make the Lebanese laugh at their tragedy,''
Tueini said.
   Most Lebanese, who've seen just about everything, have mixed
feelings about the game.
   ``It's fun,'' said Rima Halaby, a college student in Moslem west
Beirut.
   But some complain that a game based on a war in which more than
150,000 people are reported to have been killed since 1975 is
offensive.
   ``I won't allow it in my home,'' snapped housewife Majwa Shami.
``I think it's sick and will corrupt my children.''
   Tueini maintains there's nothing immoral about his game.
   ``It's just very realistic,'' he said. ``If I'd included drugs
and stolen cars as sources of income in the game then it would have
been immoral.
   ``But people don't need to be taught how to be immoral.
Everybody knows what happens here.
   ``The game's not just about Lebanon,'' Tueini added. ``It can be
applied to all Third World conflicts like the ones in Cambodia, El
Salvador and Nicaragua.''
   ``I used the ingredients from Lebanon because we've had 15
years' experience.''
   The game is set in ``Mabil ... a country torn by civil war'' and
has become ``a mixture of savage and unscrupulous
mini-dictatorships.''
   But unlike Lebanon's army, fractured like the country itself
between feuding Christians and Moslems, Mabil's military is strong
and united.
   The object of the game, with two to four players, is to collect
40 military units, five more than those run by the army to take
``the reins of government.''
   The instructions read: ``The best man will be the most
unscrupulous.
   ``Civil war ... has its own rules which have nothing to do with
the international conventions, with military rules of conduct or
with what is commonly called human rights.''
   The instructions note: ``In fact, the rules of civil war are
nothing but the absence of rules.
   ``Racketeering, taking hostages ... terrorism, blind shelling,
blockades, seizure of ports, corrupt practices and so on. All these
are an integral part of the civil war.''
   Players throw dice to move their markers around the yellow
board, which is divided into squares, orange for events, green for
battles and blue for revenue.
   ``The elementary rule of any civil war is to make money to buy
weapons,'' Tueini said. ``To make money you need revenue.''
   The squares denoting revenue sources include liquor, tobacco,
restaurants, casinos, electricity and water _ and hostages, ``the
most lucrative.''
   If a player lands on a battle square he can declare war on any
``militia leader'' provided the aggressor has 15 military units.
   Players landing on an events square pick up cards outlining a
situation that will determine whether they win or lose money.
   Tueini said all the events described have actually taken place
in Lebanon.
   ``I picked the funniest and most unscrupulous scandals without
naming names,'' he said.
   One events card reads: ``The regional power protecting you and
the country where your hostages come from come to an agreement.
Your `protector' asks you to release the hostages. In return you
receive the equivalent of your throw of dice multiplied by 30
Mabilian pounds.''
   Tueini noted: ``I've even printed a multiplication table for
younger players who may not know how to multiply.''
   Another events card reads: ``You have just received an
international donation of flour that you have sold without scruples
on the local market. You win 100 Mabilian pounds.''
   Tueini has made 2,000 copies of the game in French and English
and hopes to market it abroad. He said it's selling ``quite well.''

<HEAD>Bush OK But No Quayle, Conservatives Say</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A panel of conservatives, grading the
administration's first year, says President Bush is OK _ but he's
no Dan Quayle.
   A conservative think tank issued that report card, giving Bush a
gentleman's C.
   The vice president got an A.
   That spells success in one of Quayle's tasks _ covering the
conservative political flank for the administration. It has been
handled with differences in tone and emphasis that leave both
Quayle and Bush room to insist there is no disagreement on policy.
There can't be _ it is a fact of vice presidential life that the
No. 2 man doesn't have any policy options of his own.
   Quayle has said there is no good guy-bad guy strategy at work.
But on such topics as East-West relations, he tends to emphasize
the negative while Bush deals with the positive. That reassures the
right, still suspicious of Soviet intent, internal reforms
notwithstanding.
   The White House describes that as a difference in perspective,
not in substance. Quayle underscores his loyalty to the president
and his policies at every opportunity, and dismisses suggestions
that they're not always in tune. ``It's the age-old game that is
played in trying to find some distinction between the president and
vice president,'' Quayle said in a New Year interview with The
Associated Press.
   Still, there are distinctions, and they register clearly with
conservatives. That shows in the report card.
   The Heritage Foundation published the freshman year appraisal
this month, in its quarterly magazine, Policy Review. Grading was
done by five conservatives who were willing to put their names
behind their marking system.
   Given the magazine deadline, Bush's decision to intervene in
Panama on Dec. 20 didn't come within their grading period.
Conservatives generally applauded him for it.
   And they unanimously applauded Quayle for his year's work.
   ``Quayle has proved to be a very effective advocate of
conservative positions within the administration and as a liaison
with conservatives on Capitol Hill,'' said Paul Weyrich, president
of the Free Congress Foundation.
   Weyrich rated Quayle at A-minus, suggesting he ought to be more
independent of the administration to add to his own stature and
build ``a viable national political base for himself.''
   That may sound good to conservative Republicans, but
independence, in policy or politics, is not part of the job
description that goes with the vice presidency.
   Bush got a B from Weyrich. Ditto on the card of Pat Robertson,
the television evangelist who challenged him for the 1988
presidential nomination. Robertson, chief executive of the
Christian Broadcasting Network, called Bush ``steady, competent,
unimaginative'' and cautious.
   ``He has not told the American people where he wants to go,''
Robertson said. ``He has not outlined a cogent policy agenda for
them to support.''
   Robertson said Quayle merits an A as ``a superb vice president.''
   ``Whether he can rehabilitate himself politically after the
vicious beating he took from the media last fall remains to be
seen,'' Robertson said. ``I hope he can.''
   Amy Moritz, executive director of the National Center for Public
Policy Research, agreed on the A and on the complaint about Quayle
coverage. ``Quayle has done a tremendous job under this pressure
and it's time the American people told the bullies in the media to
lay off,'' she said.
   She saw Bush as no better than a C-minus, saying he has
delivered neither victories nor vision. ``George Bush is not sure
why he wants to be president,'' she said, so he reacts to events
and compromises between opposing viewpoints.
   Harsher still was Edward H. Crane, president of the Cato
Institute, who gave Bush a D. ``Bush is a creature of government
who does not object to a single federal program or department,''
Crane contended. ``... His continued popularity among conservatives
is a sad commentary on what's left of the Reagan revolution.''

to chief justice, Rehnquist has emerged as the collegial
orchestrator of a major rightward shift in the court's direction.
   ``The Rehnquist Court came of age'' in 1989, said A.E. Dick
Howard, a law professor at the University of Virginia.
   ``I think he's been an enormously effective chief justice,''
added Professor Dennis Hutchinson of the University of Chicago.
``The court appears to operate more efficiently and harmoniously
than it has in decades, and he's able to utilize the court
membership in ways he thinks are advantageous.''
   Rehnquist, who declined to be interviewed for this article,
turned 65 in October. He has said privately he might have retired
had he not become chief justice and if he found himself
consistently in the minority on key issues.
   But his promotion and then-President Reagan's appointment of
three conservative justices shelved all talk of retirement.
   Today, even those on the opposite end of the political spectrum
applaud Rehnquist for his affability and brilliance.
   Justice William J. Brennan, the court's liberal anchor, has
called him a ``splendid'' chief justice. Seasoned court observers
say they are not surprised that an easy informality has been
injected into the justices' private conferences and personal
relations.
   ``I think Rehnquist has removed any internecine bitterness in
the court,'' said Bruce Fein, a Washington lawyer and longtime
court watcher.
   Rehnquist's predecessor as chief justice, Warren E. Burger,
sometimes ruffled the feathers of his colleagues. But flashes of
self-deprecating humor and a low-key style are more the Rehnquist
hallmarks.
   The chief justice has been known to lead judges and lawyers in
song in after-hours sessions at judicial meetings, wear a softball
T-shirt to the justices' private conferences and tell a joke at his
own expense. He has a well-earned reputation as a practical joker.
   But the public face Rehnquist shows is not always so convivial.
   A lawyer arguing before the court last month in support of a
constitutional ``right to die'' had his concluding remarks
brusquely cut off in mid-sentence by the chief justice. The
allotted 60 minutes for arguments had expired.
   Rehnquist's at-times caustic interrogation of lawyers is
defended by some scholars, who say his own high intellectual
standards make him impatient with sloppy work.
   ``The more cerebral members of the court get upset at
ineptitude,'' said Fein. ``The chief justice has to take the lead
there and make sure arguments are productive.''
   Rehnquist sometimes can appear ill at ease in public, as he did
at the rancorous public hearings the Senate Judiciary Committee
held before the full Senate confirmed him as chief justice by a
65-33 vote.
   Opponents challenged Rehnquist's integrity, honesty and
commitment to equal rights.
   Five witnesses swore under oath that Rehnquist had harassed and
had intimidated black and Hispanic voters as a Republican Party
official in Phoenix in the early 1960s.
   The charges were nothing new. They were raised in 1971, when
then-President Nixon nominated Rehnquist, a 47-year-old Justice
Department lawyer, to the high court.
   On both occasions, Rehnquist swore he could not remember taking
part in any harassment.
   Rehnquist's early years on the court were most notable for
frequent, and often solitary, dissents that many feel laid the
intellectual groundwork for the court's rightward turn of later
years.
   In the mid-1970s, Rehnquist's law clerks gave him a Lone Ranger
doll to symbolize his status.
   Rehnquist may have moderated some views since, but the more
likely explanation is that the change in the court's composition
has placed him closer to its ideological center.
   In his first court term as chief justice, Rehnquist seemed
outmaneuvered by Brennan as court liberals prevailed in key cases.
When voting in the minority, the chief justice must turn over to
the senior justice on the other side the job of writing or
assigning the court's majority opinion.
   When Justice Anthony M. Kennedy joined the court in 1988, a
more-seasoned Rehnquist began to place his imprint on the court's
work.
   The chief justice seems to have absorbed a lesson from a 1976
article he wrote about some of his predecessors:
   ``It may well be that the office of chief justice of the United
States calls for skills and abilities more readily honed in the
give-and-take of political life than in the practice and teaching
of the law,'' Rehnquist wrote.
   There is little question of Rehnquist's intellectual capacity to
lead. He graduated first in his class from Stanford University's
law school in 1952. As a thinker and a writer, many place him in
the first rank of the 16 men to have served the nation as chief
justice.
   Rehnquist's plans may be uncertain. He has hinted privately that
after several more years he might retire to spend more time with
his four grandchildren and his hobbies, which include playing
tennis and poker, studying history and painting landscapes in
acrylic.

<TEXT>
   After 10 years of focusing on shuttles,
NASA plans 64 space exploration missions this decade, creating a
data deluge that could swamp an agency already drowning in
information that's never been studied.
   ``We will acquire in the next three years what it's taken 25
years to get,'' said James Green, director of the National Space
Science Data Center at Goddard Space Flight Center. The volume will
double every two years after that, with a virtual information
explosion in 1996 from the Earth Observing System.
   EOS is expected to transmit more data in 30 hours than is
already stored from 25 years of space travel. Before EOS, the next
three years should see the launch of the Cosmic Background
Explorer, the Galileo mission to Jupiter, the Hubble Space
Telescope, Gamma Ray Observer, Ulysses mission to the sun, the Mars
Observer and the TOPEX Poseidon ocean-sensing satellite.
   Scientists hope EOS will yield data to such solve threats to the
Earth's survival as global warming and the thinning of the
protective ozone layer.
   The critical question is whether it will be in a form they can
use.
   Industry hasn't developed hardware or software to serve the
demands of disciplines as diverse as anthropology, zoology and
atmospheric physics, so it has been up to government scientists to
pioneer solutions that have put NASA at the cutting edge, but still
short of making computerized data easily usable.
   Observers say part of the problem lies with NASA itself. The
agency traditionally has been most willing to cut funds for
archiving data if it ran short of money when launching a space
mission. It is undergoing a change in focus, too, moving from an
era of general space exploration to one of information gathering _
and funding for that lags.
   In the fiscal 1990 budget, the data center received $4.7 million
for managing, archiving and distributing data, up from the 1989
budget allocation of $3.2 million. By comparison, NASA's entire
1990 budget was $12.5 billion.
   Green likens the data analysis and management after a space
launch to the ``the last puppy that comes to supper _ if there's
too many puppies, there's not much left.'' But while he agreed his
area frequently gets short shrift, he said funding increases show
the agency is moving in the right direction.
   ``The thing is you don't put the space probes up there for no
reason,'' said David Dickerson, an aide to Rep. Bill Nelson,
D-Fla., chairman of the House space science subcommittee. ``The
distance they travel is not what's important. It's the information
they send back. They're going to have to put increasing amount of
thought and resources to that.''
   Alan Robock, a University of Maryland meteorologist who is
testing NASA techniques for improving accessibility to data, said
the fault isn't just with the space agency. ``Computers and data
analysis are not nearly as sexy ... they're harder to sell to
Congress.''
   William Campbell, a NASA artificial intelligence expert, is
developing techniques to build intelligence into the data
gathering. Increasingly fast and sensitive instruments can gather
data faster than anyone can analyze or catalog it, Campbell said.
``It's not just the volume, it's the complexity.''
   He and other NASA scientists believe they are on the brink of
developing systems that would put the data in usable form almost
from the time instruments capture it in space by analyzing it with
the users' needs in mind.
   ``The idea is to build intelligence into the whole system from
the back end to the user,'' he said. ``This is a whole new way of
thinking about the problem. I contend it is the only hope.''
   In the five years since Green took over, the Space Science Data
Center has gone from a ``tape landfill'' to concentrating on data
accessibility. But as it struggles toward answers to the pending
data deluge, it is burdened with catching up from years of neglect.
   Of approximately 80,000 magnetic tapes dating to the early 1960s
that are in a climate-controlled federal warehouse in Suitland,
about half need to be restored, said Robert McGuire, who heads the
project. About 9,000 have been restored since the effort began in
July 1988.
   Another 30,000 to 40,000 tapes are at the Space Science Data
Center.
   Under Green, the center's goals shifted from storage to
accessibility and he said it now handles 6,000 requests a year _ up
from 2,000 five years ago _ using new computer networks to
universities and research centers, electronic mail, and the postal
service. Data in demand on climate, atmosphere and other subjects
are online in the computer in 15 systems. That information is
stored on magnetic diskettes or high-density optical disks that
hold as much as 40 of the sequential magnetic tapes and let the
user go right to the needed data.
   If the technology doesn't exist to manage data beamed back from
EOS, the instruments should be monitored only some of the time _ or
not launched, Green said. ``It doesn't do anybody any good if we
can't manage the data.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some of Alvin Burkett's co-workers thought he
was kidding when he told them the diagnosis. Even some nurses
didn't believe him.
   Burkett, a 51-year-old computer specialist from Bellevue, Neb.,
had breast cancer. And in June he had a mastectomy.
   As a man, ``you've got to be careful when you tell people you've
had a mastectomy,'' he said recently. ``They think `vasectomy.'''
   Only about 900 men a year are diagnosed with breast cancer and
some 300 die of it annually, compared to about 142,000 diagnoses
and 43,000 deaths in women.
   Experts say it is too rare in men to justify widespread
screening, as is urged for women, and that few doctors check for it
while doing physicals.
   Burkett, now 52, had never heard of breast cancer in men when he
noticed a lump near his right nipple, beneath the surrounding
areola. An internist sent him to a surgeon for a biopsy, in which a
piece of tissue is removed for microscopic inspection.
   Even before the diagnosis, Burkett had started checking around
for information about male breast cancer, and found little
available. By the time the lab reported the lump was cancerous, he
said, ``I sort of suspected it.''
   He spent two days in the hospital after a modified mastectomy.
Tests at the time and since have shown no evidence of any remaining
disease.
   ``My doctor says I'm a very lucky fella,'' Burkett said.
   In fact, the prognosis for men as a group is worse than for
women, experts say. One reason is that men tend to be diagnosed in
later stages, because few men or medical personnel are watching for
it in earlier stages.
   In addition, because men have so much less breast tissue than
women, it is easier for cancer to spread to adjacent tissue, said
Robert Crichlow, professor and chairman of surgery at
Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Hanover, N.H.
   Why is breast cancer so rare in men?
   It doesn't appear to be simply that men have so much less breast
tissue, as the risk is not related to breast size in women, said
Arthur Holleb, a retired American Cancer Society official who has
studied breast cancer in men.
   Instead, the key seems to be that a man's breast is not the
target for hormones that a woman's breast is; the changes hormones
induce in a woman's breast may make cancer more likely than in a
man's, he said.
   Any lump in a man's breast is reason to consult a doctor,
especially if it is under the nipple, said William Donegan,
professor of surgery at the Medical College of Wisconsin in
Milwaukee. Most breast cancer diagnoses in men are made around ages
60 to 65, but men in their 20s can develop the disease as well.
   Donegan noted that many teen-age boys get harmless breast lumps
that tend to disappear in a year or two. Breast cancer is very rare
in teen-age boys.
   Doctors treat breast cancer in men just as they do in women,
with surgery and sometimes follow-up chemotherapy or radiation
treatment. A mastectomy removes the nipple and leaves a scar,
Donegan said.
   Burkett has written to columnist Ann Landers and offered himself
for an interview with a local television station about his
experience.
   His goal, he said, is to spread the word that men can get breast
cancer too. If that makes men examine their breasts and consult a
doctor early about suspicious lumps, he said, maybe it will save
some lives.

<HEAD>Pope Promoting Church Moral Doctrine in Scientific Sphere</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<HEAD>By STEPHEN R. WILSON</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   From AIDS to organ transplants, Pope John
Paul II is keeping closing track of scientific issues to ensure the
Roman Catholic Church's moral agenda is promoted in the push for
progress.
   The relationship between science and religion is long and
stormy, but things have come a long way since the church tried the
17th century astronomer Galileo Galilei for teaching that the earth
orbits the sun.
   The process of reconciliation has accelerated under John Paul,
who often addresses scientific issues and solicits research by
Vatican-appointed scientists on developments of interest to the
church.
   ``While it is not the church's specific role to advance
knowledge of a strictly scientific nature, she cannot ignore or
neglect issues which are closely related to her mission,'' he said
Dec. 14 to a group of scientists meeting at the Vatican. ``This is
particularly true when it is a question of defining the rules which
should regulate human conduct.''
   These are often issues that raise moral or ethical problems,
such as artificial procreation, genetic engineering and nuclear
war. But the Vatican has also promoted research into less
controversial matters, including tropical disease, leprosy, and
alternative energy.
   The pope frequently reminds scientists not to lose sight of the
moral and ethical implications of their work, warning of potential
risks and abuses.
   ``In its undisputable task of research and service, science has
an intrinsic morality it must respect,'' he said Sept. 24 at the
University of Pisa. Without imposing ``repressive limits'' on
research, scientists should ``respect the supreme laws of nature
and life,'' he said.
   That also was the message of a 1987 Vatican document condemning
test-tube births, surrogate motherhood and experiments on living
embryos. Church doctrine on sexual and moral issues also took
center stage at an international meeting on AIDS in mid-November.
While the meeting attracted hundreds of scientists, church
officials set the agenda at the Vatican-sponsored conference.
   Issues with moral implications are also being taken up by the
Pontifical Academy of Sciences. The academy, which dates to 1603
but took its present form in 1936, has become recognized as one of
the world's most prestigious research institutes. It has 80 members
from around the world, including 26 Nobel Prize winners. Many are
non-Catholics or non-believers.
   In the early 1980s the pope sent envoys to world capitals to
present the academy's dark conclusions on the possible consequences
of nuclear war, and he embraced the scientists' opposition to
deployment of weapons in space.
   In interviews, several academy scientists acknowledged that
dealing with delicate issues can pose difficulties.
   ``It's hard to draw the dividing line between scientific issues
and moral and religious issues,'' said Stanley K. Runcorn, who now
teaches physics at the University of Alaska. ``But the academy has
to maintain its view that it has something to say strictly on the
scientific aspects of a lot of these problems. It has to try and
avoid getting itself into political and religious controversies.''
   Hermann Bruck, 84, an astronomer and retired professor at the
University of Edinburgh in Scotland, noted not all scientists agree
on such issues as when life begins and ends. But at the academy, he
said, ``the fundamental belief is that if you get down to things
properly in an unbiased way, you find there is never a real
opposition between faith and science, because both things are
concerned with truth about the world.''
   William W. Morgan, a retired astronomy professor at the
University of Chicago who has been an academy member for more than
25 years, said the institute's work has never been dictated by
religious priorities.
   But he said he has noticed the academy is increasingly examining
issues with ethical implications and he would not participate in
meetings he considered too closely linked with morality.
   ``I'm not damning them, but this is not in the realm of what I
would call science,'' said Morgan, 83, who now works at the Yerkes
Observatory in Williams Bay, Wis. ``I am not qualified in such
matters.''
   The pope stresses that science and morality are intertwined:
``Scientific research and moral reflection must proceed side by
side in a spirit of mutual help. We must never lose sight of the
supreme dignity of the human person whose well-being research and
reflection are called to serve.''

<HEAD>Blue Laser Could Mean Big Gains in Data Storage</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A zinc selenide laser that produces a
blue beam and can be focused more tightly than other lasers could
eventually triple the amount of information stored on optical
computer disks, its developer says.
   Japanese researchers in March developed a zinc selenide laser,
but it had to be cooled to 135 degrees below zero Fahrenheit,
according to the University of Florida, which announced a more
practical, room-temperature laser.
   Zinc selenide produces a blue beam that can focus on a spot
one-third the size of that produced by current materials, packing
information more densely on optical disks, increasing capacity.
Optical storage has been slow to be adopted in computers because it
is not as economical as magnetic storage.
   But optical disks have some marked advantages, primarily in
volume. The NeXT computer developed by Apple founder Steven Jobs is
the first desktop model to use an optical disk as a primary storage
device.
   Peter Zory, a University of Florida electrical engineer who led
the development of the zinc selenide laser, said that before it
makes its way into use for information storage, it will be
necessary to develop a blue laser diode of the same material.
Diodes allow lasers to be powered by electricity. Without them,
semiconductor lasers must be powered by other lasers or electron
beams.
   Zory, who has worked on lasers for IBM and General Electric,
said IBM is trying another technique called second harmonic
generation. ``It's expensive but they're doing it anyway, because
they want that blue light. If we come in soon with the blue diode,
it will blow that technology out of the water.''
   Glenn Sincerbox, a former colleague of Zory's who manages
optical recording for IBM in San Jose, Calif., said, ``Blue lasers
are very important. We consider them strategic.''

<HEAD>Planning Begins for Model Solar Village in Arizona</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>

   Construction could begin by the end of this
year on the first solar houses in the proposed $500 million Tucson
Solar Village, which is envisioned as a guide for energy-efficient
housing in the coming century.
   ``We're getting interest from all over the globe because of the
uniqueness of this project,'' said John Beimfohr of the state Solar
Energy Office.
   ``The overall effort will be to provide an affordable, mixed-use
community using less energy and resources than traditional
developments and complying with more stringent environmental
performance codes,'' said Wilson Orr, project manager for the
800-acre village to be built on state-owned land.
   Workshops, review meetings and surveys will allow the public to
offer opinions on transportation, density, jobs, energy costs,
water use, solid waste management, open spaces, wildlife,
recreation and affordability, Orr said.
   ``Basically, our drawing board is blank right now,'' he said.
``In the coming months, we'll be relying on the public to help us
define this community and the performance standards for the
community.''
   Beimfohr said the village will incorporate such ``passive''
solar techniques as narrower, tree-lined streets to reduce the
``urban heat island effect,'' landscaping and house designs and
orientation, as well as ``active'' techniques such as solar
collectors to heat water or provide energy.
   Initial funding for the project will come from an $850,000 oil
overcharge restitution fund administered by the state. Another
$69,000 in the first year will come from the Urban Consortium,
which administers energy-related funds for the U.S. Department of
Energy, Orr said.
   Under a ``best-case scenario,'' officials said, construction on
the first model homes could begin late this year, with land
auctions by 1992.

<HEAD>Biologist Develops `Last Meal' for Insect Pests</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Insect pests could be quickly and safely
killed by enticing them to eat a gelatinous meal containing
parasites, a biologist says.
   Such ``biogel'' pesticides can't harm plants, animals or the
environment, but kill beetles, termites, cockroaches, boll weevils,
corn rootworms, tobacco worms and other insects within days, said
Frank Chang, a Temple University biology professor who developed it
with graduate student Michael Gehret.
   ``Biogel'' is a soft material that contains an insect
attractant, a feeding stimulant, food and nematodes _ insects'
natural enemies, Chang said. Nematodes live naturally in the soil
and farmers, to control pests, spray them in large quantities in
fields, a process Chang said is generally inefficient.
   ``The nematodes can be rendered harmless by lack of moisture,
ultraviolet light, and heat. It is most likely that many nematodes
die before killing any insects. At the same time, insects are able
somehow to detect the meatodes, and the pests will often avoid
these supersaturated areas.''
   By contrast, ``biogel'' placed in small containers attracts
insects while preventing detection of the nematodes. ``Biogel
reduces the use of nematodes by 99 percent,'' Chang said. ``In
other words, instead of spraying 10 million nematodes per 225
square feet of soil, you only need 100,000.
   ``As the nematodes produce offspring in the remains of each
insect, the progeny return to the soil to repeat the infectious
cycle.''
   He estimated that corn farmers who spend an estimated $10 an
acre for chemicals to control rootworms could halve their costs.
   Ray McAllister, director of regulatory affairs for the
Washington-based National Agricultural Chemicals Association, said
Chang's work ``makes dramatic promises. As with all new products,
it must prove itself in the marketplace against some stiff
competition. ...
   ``It has potential, but it is not the cure-all and it is
certainly not the replacement for pesticides.''
   Attempts at biological control predate chemical pest control
strategies and often have had good results, he said, but they tend
to be specific to one pest rather than the variety that attack
crops.

chief executive as the food products company moved to squash
speculation it will be sold.
   Johnson is the first outsider selected to head the company in
its 120-year history. He replaces R.Gordon McGovern, who announced
his early retirement in November after serving as president and
chief executive since 1980.

<HEAD>Economic Activity Up in Biggest Cities in 3rd Quarter, Study Shows</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Economic activity rebounded in most of the
nation's largest commercial centers during the third quarter as
construction and employment levels improved, according to a study.
   The accounting firm Grant Thornton said Wednesday its index of
seven economic vital signs for two dozen U.S. metropolitan areas
rose from July through September after falling in the second
quarter.
   The index showed the average growth rate of the 24 cities rose
by 0.82 in the third quarter to 108.4. In the second quarter, the
index fell 0.77.
   Activity picked up in 22 of the 24 centers in the third quarter,
Grant Thornton said.
   In making its assessment, Grant Thornton evaulated factory
hours, non-farm employment, construction permits, retail sales,
business starts, business failures and money supply.
   Cincinnati, which had gains in employment, retail sales and
construction permits in the third quarter, saw the largest increase
in economic growth, followed by San Francisco, Atlanta, Seattle and
Houston.
   San Francisco benefited from strong retail sales and employment
growth, while Atlanta had the biggest gains in construction permits
of any city. Seattle had the largest improvement in retail sales,
and also had a pickup in construction permits and employment, and
Houston posted large gains in construction permits and factory
hours.
   Boston was the only city studied by Grant Thornton to show a
drop in activity. Declines in employment, retail sales and factory
hours and an increase in business failures were blamed for the
area's poor showing.
   Growth remained flat in the New York metropolitan area, where
weakness in employment and retail sales was offset by a moderate
improvement in factory hours.
   During the 12 months ended September 1989, activity rose in all
but seven metropolitan areas: Boston, Chicago, Dallas, Kansas City,
New York, Philadelphia and Phoenix.
   Grant Thornton, founded in 1924, provides accounting, audit, tax
and management consulting services in more than 50 countries.

<HEAD>Consumer Confidence Slightly Lower In December, Report Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumer confidence in the economy slipped in
December compared with the previous month but the outlook for the
next six months improved modestly, the Conference Board said.
   The Conference Board's monthly consumer confidence index, which
is based on a nationwide survey of 5,000 households, registered
113.1 in December. That was down from a revised 115.1 the previous
month and the lowest level since November 1988, the board said
Wednesday.
   The survey said 17 percent believed ongoing business conditions
were ``bad,'' up about two percentage points from November, while
those who classified jobs as ``plentiful'' dropped to 27.5 percent
from 29.6 percent, the survey said.
   The number of people who said jobs were ``hard to get'' remained
unchanged at 20 percent, it said.
   At the same time, slightly more people, 18.1 percent vs. 17.6
percent in November, expected business conditions to improve, the
survey said. Fewer people, 7.8 percent vs. 8.3 percent, said they
would worsen.
   Buying plans were virtually unchanged from November to December.
About the same percentage of people said they planned to purchase a
new car or a home in the next six months, the survey said.
   The Conference Board is a non-profit business organization that
conducts economic research and provides forums for businesses to
exchange information.

<TEXT>
   The nearly dead U.S. consumer electronics
industry could rebound in the 1990s through a major effort
involving both industry and the federal government, a private
research group says.
   A report issued Wednesday by the Economic Policy Institute
called for relaxation of antitrust laws to allow manufacturers to
share production facilities and for increased support by the
government for research and development.
   ``Without an ambitious new effort, we are bound to fall farther
behind those nations which take the new international manufacturing
competition seriously,'' said Susan Walsh Sanderson, a professor at
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute and the author of the report.
   The report noted that in the past two decades the United States
has gone from being the world's leading producer of electronics
goods to a major importer of these products.
   Beginning in the 1970s, American companies gave up making radios
and black and white televisions, and in the 1980s lost out in the
competition to manufacture more sophisticated products such as
video cassette recorders and compact disk players.
   Though Americans invented videotape, no VCRs are manufactured in
the United States. Only one U.S. television company remains, Zenith
Electronics Corp., though several foreign firms make TVs
domestically.
   ``In one branch of electronics after another, U.S. firms have
failed to achieve commercial advantage from technical innovation,
while the Japanese and the newly industrialized countries of Asia
have caught up with and in many instances surpassed their U.S.
rivals,'' the report said.
   ``This pattern is repeated in cases where the technology is
stable _ toasters, radios and irons _ and where the technology is
changing rapidly _ televisions, video cassette recorders,
semiconductors and computers.''
   Lost markets for high-technology products are particularly
threatening since this is where most experts believe the United
States must make gains if it ever hopes to close its yawning trade
deficits.
   The report hailed a recent decision by seven leading computer
and semiconductor firms to invest up to $500 million in U.S.
Memories Inc., a joint venture which will produce key computer
components. It said such joint efforts were an example of the
innovations necessary for the United States to compete in world
trade.
   The study, entitled, ``The Consumer Electronics Industry and the
Future of American Manufacturing,'' made these other points:
   _U.S. firms have been able to find government support in weapons
manufacturing. The defense share of total federal spending on
research and development rose from 51.4 percent in 1964 to 68.4
percent in 1987. But these funds are likely to shrink dramatically
with the expected cuts in defense spending from a relaxation of
East-West tensions.
   _As defense support for research and development declines,
Congress must channel part of the ``peace dividend'' into increased
civilian research, including the public financing of demonstration
projects aimed at improving manufacturing processes.
   _The government also needs to adopt policies that will reduce
the cost of capital to U.S. businesses and encourage more corporate
investment in research into new products and development of new
manufacturing processes.
   ``For decades military and space spending has been our country's
only program for assisting competitiveness of electronics
manufacturing,'' Sanderson said. ``With a major shift of these
resources we could help to assure a strong underpinning for our
national commercial security.''
   The Economic Policy Institute is a non-profit research
organization founded in 1986, with several prominent liberal
economists among its founders. It is backed by grants from
foundations, labor unions, corporations and individuals. It often
advocates government intervention in trade matters.

   The nation's thrift institutions lost $5.6
billion in deposits in October, the 16th outflow in 17 months but
an improvement over the previous month, the government said.
   The Office of Thrift Supervision said Wednesday the October
outflow at 2,895 thrifts followed $8.7 billion in net withdrawals
in September and brought the total for the year to date to $59.2
billion, leaving the industry with a total deposit base of $949.3
billion.
   The industry has recorded net withdrawals in every month
starting in June 1988, except for July 1989, when net deposits
totaled $66 million.
   Withdrawals earlier in the year, which hit a monthly record of
$10.8 billion in January, were attributed to depositor uncertainty
about President Bush's bailout plan and to rising interest rates,
which made other investments such as money market mutual funds more
attractive.
   Since the enactment of the Bush plan Aug. 9, however, continuing
outflows have been attributed to a deliberate strategy by
institutions to shrink their operations to meet new capital
standards that took effect Dec. 7.
   As part of that, thrifts have been selling their assets, which
declined a record $15.2 billion in September and a slight $6
million more in October.
   The thrift office, in a statement, said the industry's
adjustment to new financial standards appeared to be continuing in
October, but at a slower pace.
   ``This is just a momentary slowing in the shrinkage of the
industry, but it's not over by any means,'' said Bert Ely, a
private industry analyst in Alexandria, Va.
   ``One month does not make a trend. Basically the only way most
thrift institutions can meet the new capital requirements is by
shrinking and there's more to be done,'' he said.

<HEAD>Campeau's Troubles Put Apparel Makers in Delicate Spot</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARYBETH NIBLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Clothing makers worried that they might not get
paid by cash-strapped Campeau Corp. still are reluctant to let
relations unravel with stores that have been good customers.
   But the financial crisis facing the Canadian retail and property
company remains unresolved.
   Most of the garment manufacturers that traditionally supply
merchandise to stock Campeau's U.S. department stores are holding
back shipments until the situation becomes clearer.
   Some of them said Wednesday they are meeting small orders to
satisfy shoppers at Campeau-owned stores, such as the well-known
Bloomingdale's chain, which has been put up for sale to help ease
Campeau's cash shortage.
   Bud Konheim, president of apparel maker Nicole Miller Inc., said
his company has assured Bloomingdale's buyers that it won't
withhold goods that customers want.
   ``I'm taking care of Bloomingdale's on special orders,'' he
said. ``I am not cutting off any of these stores, rudely, crudely
or abruptly. We still have to treat them as very good customers.''
   But it isn't exactly business as usual by a long shot, for
Konheim's company or its competitors. Several big factors _
companies that provide credit support to manufacturers _ started
telling clients weeks ago that they wouldn't accept the risk of
doing business with Toronto-based Campeau any longer.
   Over the past few months some mainstream suppliers have disposed
of merchandise through discounters and off-price outlets instead of
shipping to stores operated by Campeau's Allied Stores Corp. and
Federated Department Stores Inc. divisions, based in Cincinnati.
   They were willing to take less for their goods rather than risk
not being paid at all by Campeau.
   Manufacturers are waiting to see whether they receive payment
for goods shipped to the Allied and Federated retailers between
Nov. 20 and the week before Christmas. The deadline for those
payments is Jan. 10.
   If the bills aren't paid, manufacturers likely will continue to
balk. That raises the spectre of sparsely stocked shelves at such
Campeau-owned retailers as Burdines, The Bon Marche, Lazarus and
Rich's.
   Currently, there is a between-season lull in shipments from
manufacturers to retailers. Most stores are in the midst of
post-Christmas sales with enough winter merchandise to tide them
over until late January or early February, when spring goods
usually start showing up, retail analysts say.
   There has been speculation within the retail trade that heavily
indebted Campeau might delay paying bills as long as possible so
that it can accumulate cash before seeking refuge for its retailers
in bankruptcy court.
   Allied and Federated had warned last month that they might be
forced to file for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of
the bankruptcy code unless bondholders agree to reschdule certain
debts.
   Campeau has debts in high-interest junk bonds that were sold to
finance its $6.7 billion takeover of Federated, parent of
Bloomingdale's, in 1988.
   Geoffrey Lurie, president of GDL Management Inc., which
specializes in advising companies in turnaround situations, said he
is ``convinced'' that a Chapter 11 petition will be filed by
Campeau on behalf of its retailers.
   Such an action actually would reduce the turmoil in the apparel
trade, he contended. Manufacturers could resume shipments to Allied
and Federated after a filing knowing that they would be among the
first in line to get paid. Claims that crop up after a filing have
priority over unsecured creditors who had payments due them before
a company files for Chapter 11 protection.
   Meanwhile, an announcement Tuesday that Allied and Federated won
a temporary reprieve from a threat by bank lenders to declare the
retailers in technical default on a $2.34 billion loan didn't
provide much comfort for suppliers.
   The banking syndicate led by Citicorp's Citibank agreed not to
press the point before Jan. 15, giving Campeau more time to show it
is making progress in sorting out its financial problems. The
bankers previously said they might ask for full repayment of the
loan, a demand that presumably could have forced Campeau to file a
Chapter 11 petition immediately.
   ``There's no measure of comfort now,'' said Konheim of the
Nicole Miller apparel company. He said in order for the garment
trade to alter its stance toward Campeau it would like to see
Campeau get backing for its restructuring plans from Citibank or
another financially sound supporter.
   Bernard Chaus, who heads a women's clothing manufacturing
company that bears his name, was more optimistic. ``The news
certainly is encouraging,'' he said. ``We are quite confident that
these stores will be in business for many years to come.''

<TEXT>
   Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. says it will sell its
Canadian retail brokerage operations to Wood Gundy Inc., a
Toronto-based securities firm.
   The deal, announced Wednesday, is part of a piecemeal
restructuring the largest U.S. brokerage launched in November to
reduce costs and improve profits in a slumping Wall Street business
environment.
   The sale of Merrill Lynch Canada Inc.'s retail arm includes the
transfer of 20 offices, professional and support staffs, and access
to the firm's U.S. research capabilities. Terms of the deal with
Wood Gundy were not disclosed.
   Merrill Lynch's retail sales operation in Canada employs 685
people, including 264 registered representatives. After the sale,
Merrill still will employ about 300 people in Canada in
institutional sales, trading and research, investment banking,
mergers and acquisitions, and cross-border financing.
   Dumping the retail operation will reduce Merrill Lynch's total
work force to about 39,800 from a peak of more than 46,000 before
the October 1987 stock market crash.
   Merrill officials said the firm decided to sell the retail
division because it appeared unlikely Merrill Lynch would receive a
banking license in Canada.
   ``We believe that the strategic future of the retail business is
directly linked with access to the Canadian banking system,''
Jerome P. Kenney, president and chief executive of Merrill Lynch
Capital Markets, said in a statement.
   Kenney also said Merrill is studying its other businesses around
the world as part of its streamlining effort.
   Since November, Merrill has abandoned the European commercial
paper business and one equity division at its New York
headquarters. A subsidiary, Broadcort Capital Corp., recently sold
some retail-oriented clearing counts to a division of Donaldson,
Lufkin &amp; Jenrette Securities Corp.
   Merrill Lynch entered Canadian finance in 1969 when it acquired
Royal Securities.
   After the deal with Merrill, Wood Gundy will employ more than
2,500 people in Canada and elsewhere. Wood Gundy, which is 62
percent owned by Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, has 39 offices
in Canada.

<TEXT>
   Coniston Partners is dismissing as irrelevant a
decision by UAL Corp. to accelerate the schedule for its talks with
non-union workers over a possible employee buyout of the airline
company.
   The talks will begin two days after a Monday deadline for a
buyout plan imposed by the investor group, a major UAL shareholder
pressuring the parent of United Airlines to enhance its stock value
with a buyout or other measures.
   The announcement of the speed-up implied that UAL would not meet
Coniston's deadline. But Coniston principal Augustus Oliver
shrugged off the development.
   ``I don't view the scheduled meetings with non-contract
employees as necessarily relevant to our Jan. 8 deadline,'' Oliver
said in a telephone interview from New York.
   Oliver said the success of any employee buyout plan hinged less
on the participation of UAL's 23,000 salaried and management
employees than on the involvement of the unionized pilots, flight
attendants and Machinists who together represent about 46,000 UAL
workers.
   Those three groups, along with management, ``are the key to
getting something off the ground,'' Oliver said.
   ``It then becomes important to find the proper role and place
with non-contract employees,'' he said. ``We obviously think the
non-contract employees are an important element in the company as a
whole but I think the key focus in the company is the unionized
employees.''
   UAL's management already has met with leaders of United's pilot
and flight attendant unions over an employee buyout plan.
   UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf, in an internal memo Wednesday, said
the talks with salaried and management employees were being moved
up to Jan. 10 and 11 from Jan. 16 and 17 ``to provide meaningful
input on employee ownership issues prior to any significant
developments'' that could affect the structuring of any new
employee ownership proposal.
   ``One way to look at it,'' Oliver said, ``is that maybe Steve
(Wolf) is scheduling these meetings to explain a proposal that
they're going to announce prior to that.''
   UAL fell $7.75 a share to close at $162.75 Wednesday on the New
York Stock Exchange.
   A $6.75 billion buyout proposal led by UAL management and the
pilots union collapsed in October when the group was unable to
raise financing for the $300-a-share deal.
   The Machinists' opposition to the plan helped kill it. UAL
management reportedly is considering a deal that would not include
the company's 25,000 Machinist union members.
   Coniston, which owns 11.8 percent of UAL's common stock, has
said it would press for a recapitalization of the company if there
was no acceptable employee buyout plan by Monday.
   A recapitalization could involve a cash dividend to
shareholders, although some analysts believe such a plan would be
worth less than $200 a share. That compares with the $240-a-share
buyout proposal that UAL management reportedly has discussed in
meetings with its pilots and flight attendants.
   Airline industry analysts were divided on the significance of
the accelerated meetings.
   ``It certainly isn't what Coniston wanted,'' said an analyst who
spoke on condition of anonymity. ``Coniston set a deadline but the
company is saying it will move at its own pace. We're not bullish
on the stock.''
   But Samuel Buttrick, of the investment firm Kidder Peabody &amp;
Co., saw room for give and take between Coniston and UAL.
   ``My interpretation is that the date needn't be set in stone as
long as some progress is being made,'' Buttrick said.

<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. Chairman Roger Smith
urged the United Auto Workers to acknowledge the car industry is
mired in a slump and declined to rule out more plant closures in
the first quarter.
   Smith, at a news conference Wednesday to discuss GM's prototype
electric-powered Impact car, said future closures would depend on
demand for GM cars and that it was too early to predict demand this
quarter.
   Forty-two assembly plants will be down for at least one week in
January. The Big Three operate 53 assembly plants in the United
States.
   Among the plants targeted for temporary slowdown are several in
Ohio, including GM plants in Columbus and Dayton which will idle
more than 4,700 workers, the company announced Wednesday.
   As automakers grapple with high inventories and low demand,
total shutdowns will affect more than 127,000 auto workers.
   Smith declined to directly answer a question on what effect the
plant closures would have on contract talks with the United Auto
Workers, which begin in September.
   He suggested, though, that workers should realize the auto
industry has hit hard times.
   The UAW ``has got good economists too, so they should know,''
Smith said.
   About this time last year, Smith accurately predicted record
earnings for GM. But he refused to make such a prediction on
Wednesday, saying that Securities and Exchange Commission rules
precluded him from doing so.
   Reminded that he had done so last year before fourth-quarter
earnings were released, he said, ``It was easier to read last year
because of the first nine months,'' which he said were so good that
it was clear a record would be set.
   Smith was peppered with questions about the documentary ``Roger
&amp; Me,'' which contains interviews with people who said they lost
their homes after GM plant closures in Flint, Mich.
   One woman said she had to start killing rabbits for food after
Smith shut down the plants, eliminating 30,000 jobs in the city of
150,000.
   ``I haven't seen it,'' Smith said. ``I'm not much for sick humor
and I don't like things that take advantage of poor people.''
   Filmmaker Michael Moore said he arranged with Warner Bros. to
reserve a seat for Smith at every showing of the movie across the
United States.

<HEAD>New Chip: Smaller Than A Credit Card, Powerful as Room-Size
Computer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By E. SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A computer chip built smaller than a credit
card and packed with the power of a room-sized supercomputer has
been unveiled by TRW Inc. and Motorola Corp.
   The new chip first will be used in the military as the brain in
spacecraft, missiles and jet fighters, and the makers hope it
eventually will help free United States from relyiance on Japanese
chip makers.
   The chip, called CPUAX for Central Processing Unit _ Arithmetic
Extended, is expected to enter the commercial electronics market as
other technologies catch up.
   TRW and Motorola issued a statement Wednesday saying their chip
can perform 200 million operations per second by placing several
times more transistors on a chip than ever before.
   ``Two hundred million operations per second mean the (chip) is
the computational equivalent of some supercomputers that fill an
entire room, require elaborate refrigeration systems and weigh
several tons,'' said Thomas A. Zimmerman, a research director at
TRW, the Cleveland-based aerospace and defense company.
   The chip is packaged at 2.1 inches by 2.1 inches and weighs 1.5
ounces. It has 4 million transistors, each smaller than a light
wave, according to TRW and Motorola, the Schaumburg, Ill.-based
electronics company.
   ``Commercial successors of the superchip could find use in a
wide variety of applications where high speed, small size and great
computing power and reliability are needed,'' Zimmerman said.
``Among these are computer-aided design, medical diagnosis, plant
process control and complex imaging.''
   William S. Richardson, executive vice of Ncube, a Beaverton,
Ore.-based computer company that builds such parallel processing
supercomputers, said the TRW-Motorola chip ``is a pretty impressive
system.''
   ``When you put 4 million transistors on a single computer chip
... that in effect means far higher performance,'' he said. ``It's
probably three or four times the number of transistors of anything
before.''
   The chip is able to ``repair'' glitches in its operations when
used in conjunction with a ``satellite'' chip, essentially by
disconnecting the faulty parts of the superchip, the companies said.
   The chip was produced by a TRW-Motorola contractor team working
on the Defense Department's very high-speed integrated circuits
program. The team has worked for 10 years on three phases of the
program, the companies said.
   The self-repair function is probably necessary because the
transistors are so tiny and the chip so complex that inevitable
glitches otherwise would render it useless, said Richardson.
   He said that previously the smallest transistor in a computer
chip was about 0.8 to 1.0 microns _ twice the size of those in the
TRW-Motorola superchip.
   Recent top of the line chips have handled up to 50 million
instructions per second, with industry leader Intel claiming 100
million to 150 million instructions per second for its newest and
hottest microprocessor, compared with the new superchip's 200 MIPS.

<HEAD>Apple Board Approves Repurchase of 2.5 Million Shares Of Common
Stock</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CUPERTINO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Apple Computer Inc. said today its
board of directors has approved the repurchase of up to 2.5 million
additional shares of common stock.
   The ongoing open-market purchases are part of an ongoing program
announced last August, when Apple's board first authorized purchase
of 2.5 million shares.
   John Sculley, Apple's chairman and chief executive, said the
purchase ``represents good long-term value to our shareholers.''
   Last month, Apple projected a decline in earnings in the first
quarter of fiscal 1990 and said sales would grow more slowly than
previously predicted.
   The announcement surprised industry watchers, coming just two
weeks after a top executive of the personal computer maker told
security analysts in New York that it expected worldwide sales
growth of more than 20 percent.
   Before August, Apple had completed two share repurchase programs
in 1986 and 1987, which together involved 15 million shares of
stock.

   The stock market declined slightly today,
continuing the indecisive trend that set in on Wednesday.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 4.91 to 2,804.82
in the first half hour of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 7 to 6 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 442 up, 520 down and
520 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 24.98 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Analysts said traders were confining most of their buying, for
the second straight day, to stocks of industrial companies
considered highly sensitive to the ups and downs of the business
cycle.
   Many of those stocks languished in the waning months of 1989
amid spreading talk of an approaching recession.
   In December, analysts said, the cyclicals were further depressed
by yearend tax selling.
   With the arrival of the new year, buyers began to move into this
sector of the market, acting on the theory that recession worries
had gone to unwarranted extremes.
   Among today's actively traded industrial issues, Chrysler rose |

   Oldsmobile's highly touted ``This is not your
father's Oldsmobile'' ad campaign has run its course and will be
phased out, a company executive says.
   ``We will not be using it too much,'' Mike Losh, general manager
of the Oldsmobile Division of General Motors Corp., said Wednesday.
   ``We're going to be doing more talking about the `new generation
of Olds,''' he said. ``It's time to move on and change and evolve.''
   The ``father'' advertisement was an ill-conceived project from
the start, said analyst Thomas O'Grady of Integrated Automotive
Resources Inc. of Wayne, Pa.
   ``It made a lot of statements that lacked the ability to sell
the cars,'' he said. ``It was an ad campaign that had to go.''
   O'Grady said the campaign made the mistake of targeting car
buyers around 40 years old, who usually don't consider buying
Oldsmobiles, while alienating the traditional, older Oldsmobile
buyers by saying the car is not for them.
   Oldsmobile sales suffered in 1989. Through Dec. 20, the
division's sales were running 15.4 percent behind last year's pace.
   Oldsmobile officials declined to say how much was spent on the
campaign, but observers speculated it probably was an expensive
one. Celebrities and their offspring are used in the ads.
   In one, ex-Beatle Ringo Starr is chased by a group of
middle-aged women, slides down a banquet table, out a window and
into the passenger seat of an Oldsmobile driven by his daughter,
Lee.
   Part of Oldsmobile's new image actually is a throwback to a
previous focus _ trucks.
   Losh on Wednesday showed off the Oldsmobile Bravada, a four-door
sport-utility vehicle scheduled for production in late summer for
the 1991 model year.
   Oldsmobile, which had stopped producing trucks in 1934, returned
to the truck market last year with the Silhouette minivan.
   ``It will get us back market that we've lost,'' Losh said. Car
buyers have been changing to truck buyers with the relatively
recent popularity of minivans and sport-utility vehicles like Jeeps.
   ``We don't see ourselves doing a pickup truck, for instance,''
he said.
   Losh's comments came during the first day of the three-day media
preview for the North American International Auto Show in Detroit.
   Also at the preview, Chrysler Motors President Robert Lutz said
Chrysler was conducting two studies to develop a successor for its
Plymouth Horizon and Dodge Omni subcompact cars. Those vehicles go
out of production early next month when Chrysler shuts down its
Jefferson Avenue plant in Detroit.
   Lutz said one of the studies involves a possible link with an
Asian automaker, probably Mitsubishi Motors Corp.
   ``This study is focused primarily on Mitsubishi for the obvious
reason that they are our primary Asian partner,'' Lutz said. ``But
the study is not exclusively focused on Mitsubishi.''
   Chrysler and Mitsubishi currently are involved in a number of
manufacturing and marketing associations.
   Lutz said the second study was focused on whether the car could
be developed exclusively by Chrysler.
   Whichever plan is selected, he said, the Omni-Horizon successor
wouldn't hit showroom floors until the mid-1990s, after Chrysler
begins car production from its LH program.
   At one time, Chrysler commanded a large chunk of the small-car
market with its Omni and Horizon, partly with its America series of
subcompacts. But since then, sales have eroded amid criticism that
the subcompacts' styling had become stale.
   Combined Omni-Horizon sales through Dec. 20 this year had fallen
to 78,461, that's 33.4 percent behind last year's sales pace.

<HEAD>Soybean, Corn Exports Boost Crop Futures</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean and corn futures were mostly higher in
early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade, boosted by the
Agriculture Department's confirmation of new export sales of those
commodities.
   Wheat futures were slightly lower.
   The soybean market rose amid buying linked to a USDA
announcement late Wednesday that 150,000 metric tons of soybeans
were sold to the Soviet Union, with another 150,000 tons shipped to
unknown destinations.
   The agency said Pakistan bought 26,000 metric tons of soybean
oil, which further supported the soybean futures market.
   A sale of 100,000 metric tons of U.S. corn to China underpinned
slight gains in the corn market.
   Today's early advance was also partly due to followthrough
buying from yesterday's strong close, analysts said.
   In early trading, wheat futures were { cent to 1 cent lower with
the contract for delivery in March at $4.09{ a bushel; corn was
unchanged to \ cent higher with March at $2.38} a bushel; oats were
1 cent to 2 cents higher with March at $1.55 a bushel; soybeans
were \ cent to 1} cents higher with January at $5.69 a bushel.
   Hog and pork belly futures soared their respective daily limits
of 1.5 cents and 2 cents a pound on the Chicago Mercantile Exhange
in response to Wednesday's quarterly USDA hogs and pigs inventory,
which showed a much smaller U.S. herd than traders had expected.
   Some analysts have predicted several days of limit gains as the
market digests the report.
   Live hog futures were 1.5 cents higher across the board with
February at 50.5 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were 2 cents
higher across the board with February at 51.47 cents a pound; live
cattle were .17 cent to 1 cent higher with February at 77.32 cents
a pound; feeder cattle were .30 cent to .58 cent higher with
January at 84.90 cents a pound.
   Cattle futures settled lower on Wednesday while hog futures rose
and pork bellies fell.

   Exxon officials say a heating oil leak is 20
to 100 times larger than first estimated, and that up to 500,000
gallons of fuel spilled into a waterway separating New Jersey and
New York's Staten Island.
   The officials are investigating whether a leak detector in an
underwater pipeline may have malfunctioned. The Coast Guard closed
much of the Arthur Kill channel to boat traffic Wednesday.
   Coast Guard Chief Gene Hoff said today the waterway was likely
to be closed an additional 24 to 48 hours.
   In Pennsylvania, officials reopened a stretch of the Monongahela
River today that had been closed since New Year's Day, after some
five dozen barges broke loose from moorings during a thaw. One
wayward vessel spilled 10,000 gallons of gasoline into the water.
   Exxon said from 100,000 to 500,000 gallons were spilled into the
Arthur Kill after the Coast Guard questioned its initial estimate
of 5,000 gallons and the company conducted an inventory, officials
said.
   Hoff said today the actual spill of refined No. 2 oil probably
was closer to 400,000 gallons and that 100,000 to 200,000 remained
on the waterway.
   Coast Guard Capt. Robert North on Wednesday had estimated the
spill at 200,000 gallons and said about half already had
evaporated. Of the remainder, about half had been contained by
booms within the kill, he said.
   The spill, first discovered early Tuesday, left an 11-mile slick
from Shooter's Island at the mouth of Newark Bay in the north, to
Tottenville, at the southern tip of Staten Island.
   It was traced to an underwater rupture in a 6.7-mile, 12-inch
pipe connecting the Exxon plant in Bayonne to its Bayway refinery
and chemical plant in Linden.
   The Arthur Kill, which is in a heavily industrialized area lined
with oil companies and storage tanks, was closed Wednesday
afternoon to general traffic for the cleanup, North said. Vessels
were being allowed through by special request.
   Dozens of vessels use the Arthur Kill each day, North said,
adding that there was some backup because of the closing.
   The cleanup, which Exxon is handling, could take several weeks,
North said.
   Ben Marvin, spokesman for the New York State Department of
Environmental Conservation in Albany, said workers had recovered 10
oil-soaked waterfowl. Nearly two dozen ducks have been found dead,
most on Prall's Island, a protected state wildlife sanctuary in the
Arthur Kill.
   There was no evidence of damage to fish life, North said.
   Exxon initially said the pipeline's leak detector system
automatically shut the pipeline. But Exxon Plant Manager Katherine
Cochrane said Wednesday officials were not sure.
   She said it would have taken about three hours for the pipe to
discharge 500,000 gallons at its full capacity of 168,000 gallons
an hour.
   It is also possible that workers may have ignored the device's
leak advisory because it has given faulty leak reports in the past,
Ms. Cochrane said.
   Exxon spokesman Louis Jung said divers had determined there was
a 4-foot by half-inch gash in the pipe. The company is trying to
determine what hit the line, he said.
   About 50 workers were setting up booms to trap the oil or
removing it from the water's surface with skimmers and vacuums,
said Exxon cleanup coordinator Joe Czarnecki. He said priority is
being given to environmentally sensitive areas such as Prall's
Island and Saw Mill Creek.
   Pennsylvania officials said environmental damage was slight from
the gasoline spill on the Monongahela.
   The Coast Guard had warned barge operators Dec. 26 that a thaw
was expected by weekend and advised them to secure barges tightly
so that rushing chunks of ice and high water would not knock the
vessels free. But at least 61 barges were torn from their moorings,
37 of them at the Maxwell Dam 60 miles upstream from Pittsburgh.
   The Coast Guard began searching for sunken barges Wednesday over
20 miles of river with sonar equipment. The procedure was completed
early today and the Coast Guard reopened the entire river to
traffic.

<HEAD>Prime Minister Says Romania Cannot Move Quickly To Free Market</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Romania's economy is so centralized it would be
impossible to move quickly to a free-market system, Prime Minister
Petre Roman was quoted as saying Thursday.
   ``We are going to try to establish an appropriate relationship
between planning and the market,'' he was quoted as saying by the
independent French daily Le Monde. ``To say we will, starting now,
create a market economy would not correspond to the situation in
which we find ourselves.''
   Petre said the new government, put in place by the National
Salvation Front until free elections planned in April, would try to
decentralize control over state-owned enterprises, but said the
idea of privatization had not been raised, the newspaper reported.
   ``We favor the abolition of the state's monopoly on foreign
trade but for now, our economy is a planned economy,'' he was
quoted as saying. ``We can't say to the enterprises, `From now on
do what you want.' That would destablize the whole economy.''
   Petre, a French-trained scientist, said he had been a Marxist,
but never a Communist, Le Monde reported.
   ``In any case, we are no longer the slaves of any ideology; that
cost us too much,'' he said.
   Petre said two of the revolution's key figures, Ion Iliescu who
is now president and Gen. Nicolae Militaru, now defense minister,
had met several months ago to discuss ``bringing people together
for the salvation of the nation,'' the newspaper said.
   ``But there was nothing organized, just a few contacts in a
park, which besides were recorded by the security police,'' Petre
was quoted as saying.

<HEAD>Will Bush Be A Giant Of A Leader?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   History demonstrates that rarely do two powerful
leaders follow each other, but that relatively ineffectual leaders
often do.
   That concept is the heart of what Eugene Jennings calls the
L-(for leadership) principle, and it suggests intriguing
possibilities for the future of the United States, the Soviet Union
and much of Europe.
   What type of person, for example, is likely to follow Soviet
leader Mikhail Gorbachev? Will the leadership of Eastern European
nations be strong or weak? Can George Bush be a powerful leader so
soon after Ronald Reagan?
   Jennings, professor emeritus at Michigan State University, is
author of the landmark volume ``Anatomy of Leaderhip,'' written in
1961, which traces leadership back to the Egyptian pharoahs, and
``Princes, Heroes &amp; Supermen.''
   In addition, he has advised corporate chairmen and sometimes
political candidates on how to conduct their affairs, the better to
demonstrate their leadership.
   As he interprets the L-principle, powerful leaders come forth to
fill voids, rising in response to circumstances and needs of
people. But when they are through they often leave another void
behind them.
   Into this void step what Jennings calls representative
officials, or people who represent the popular thinking of their
constituency. Unlike the powerful giants, these folks and their
ideas aren't above or ahead of the people.
   In Jennings' view, Dwight Eisenhower was a representative leader
rather than a giant. He was followed in the presidency by John
Kennedy, who Jennings feels was emerging as a giant, and then
Lyndon Johnson became one.
   ``Johnson came forth and filled the void,'' says Jennings. ``For
better or worse, he changed the direction and character of what the
country had been under Eisenhower.''
   Under Jimmy Carter, says Jennings, the country lost confidence
to do anything right, making conditions ripe for Ronald Reagan to
come galloping in on a white horse.
   Does that mean George Bush and the nation are in for a dull time?
   Not necessarily, says Jennings, appearing to bend the
L-principle just a bit. In his first term Reagan was a giant, he
says, an example of the wedding of the individual and the needs of
the people. ``In his second, he wasn't.''
   After Reagan, says Jennings, ``we should be in a void, defined
as the absence of a need or condition for strong-willed chiefs.''
But as he interprets the principle, Reagan actually created his own
void in his final four years, leaving room for Bush to achieve the
status of giant, should events conspire.
   It would be, he concedes, a rare but not unprecedented situation.
   More common is the succession of two or more representative
officials, such as Harding, Coolidge and Hoover sandwiched between
Woodrow Wilson and Franklin Roosevelt. But wouldn't that have made
Harry Truman representative?
   That's another example of bending. Roosevelt, says Jennings, was
a giant of a leader in his early years, changing the direction and
character of the country, but he was worn and torn by the time he
died in office.
   With the world turning over, as he puts it, and democracy
sweeping old regimes from power, Jennings believes conditions are
now ripe for a strong president to exert his will. Bush, he
believes, could become a giant.
   In Jenning's interpretation, Winston Churchill was a giant, but
Anthony Eden was not. Stalin was a giant, but he was followed by a
series of less powerful officials. Gorbachev filled the void they
created and, ``depending on how irreversible his initiatives are,''
he will be a giant.
   That brings up the future. The L-principle suggests that
Gorbachev will leave a void, to be filled by the so-called
representative or transitional types. First, however, Gorbachev
must nail down his reforms.
   Jennings also feels that like them or not, the former leaders of
the East bloc were powerful enough to leave a void that will be
filled by transitional or representative types. That leaves the
question of who will follow them.
   If the future remains unstable, he says, it could mean a giant
of a leader, perhaps anti-democratic, could follow. The possibility
of future dictators still exists, he says.

<HEAD>Murdoch Magazines Plans Launch of Japanese Edition of Premiere</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   News Corp.'s Murdoch Magazines said Thursday it
had arranged for a Japanese publishing company to launch a monthly
Japanese-language edition of its Premiere, The Movie Magazine.
   John B. Evans, president of Murdoch Magazines, said the new
publication will be the first Japanese edition of a Murdoch
magazine.
   Premiere, which features stories on the movie industry, was
launched in 1978 as a joint venture of News Corp., the
Australia-based multinational media company headed by Rupert
Murdoch, and France's Hachette Publications Inc. News Corp. bought
out Hachette's interest in February 1989.
   The magazine has a U.S. circulation rate base of 425,000.
   Kadokawa Shoten Publishing Co. Ltd., a leading publisher of
books and magazines in Japan, has been licensed to produce the
Japanese edition of Premiere and plans an initial circulation of
150,000.
   The Japanese edition will include about 50 pages of editorial
features and art from the U.S. version of Premiere supplemented by
20 pages of Japanese-generated material. It also will contain
advertising pages from the U.S. version of the magazine.
   Murdoch said the first issue of the new publication was released
in November 1989 and that monthly publication would begin in March.
   The launch of the Japanese edition comes as major Japanese
companies have demonstrated a growing interest in the U.S.
entertainment business. Last year, consumer electronics giant Sony
Corp. of Japan paid $3.4 billion for Columbia Pictures
Entertainment Inc. Sony bought CBS Records for $2 billion in 1988.
   ``Having known Japanese whose knowledge of American films and
music rivals that of most Americans, I am confident our joint
efforts will be nothing less than a smashing success,'' Evans said
in a statement.
   Murdoch Magazines publishes 11 magazines in the United States,
including TV Guide, Mirabella, New Woman, New York, Seventeen and
Soap Opera Digest. It also publishes 12 magazines in the United
Kingdom and Australia and has interests in four others.

   They have combined annual sales of about $170 million and employ
about 2,200 people at locations in the United States and Europe.
   ``We believe that the interconnection products divisions will
benefit from association with a company where they will fit
better,'' said Alton J. Brann, Litton senior vice president and
head of the company's components and industrial products business.
   Robert S. Knapp, a spokesman for the Beverly Hills-based
company, said the operations are growing and profitable, but are
being sold as part of Litton's strategy of concentrating on its
three core businesses. Those are advanced electronic and defense
systems, resource exploration services and industrial automation
systems.
   Brann said he hoped the divisions would be purchased as a unit
since they have complementary products.
   Litton said it has hired First Boston Corp. to handle the sale.

   Soybean futures prices closed moderately lower
Thursday and sharply below the day's highs as early excitement
about new export business gave way to bearish technical signals.
   Most grain futures finished narrowly mixed.
   The soybean market opened with a burst of buying linked partly
to new export sales of the commodity and partly to lingering
bullishness from the previous session.
   But traders grew discouraged and selling materialized after the
March contract failed to reach $5.85 a bushel, a point at which new
buyers were known to be waiting.
   ``When that failure occurred, I think the bears gained a little
more confidence and they began to press the market,'' said Pat
O'Connell, a grain-market analyst with Refco Inc. in Chicago.
   The selling snowballed as prices fell through successive support
levels and closed at or near the day's lows.
   At the close, soybean futures were } cent to 5{ cents lower with
the contract for delivery in January at $5.63 a bushel; wheat
futures were { cent lower to { cent higher with March at $4.09{ a

<HEAD>Edgar Announces Securities-Fraud Settlement with New York
Brokerage Firm</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Stands for AM-Fraud Fine item listed on AM-Business News
Digest.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. on Thursday paid a
$1.3 million fine to the state of Illinois for securities fraud, an
administrative penalty stemming from a highly publicized Wall
Street corruption case.
   The negotiated settlement is the biggest such penalty for
securities law violations in the state's history, far exceeding the
previous record fine of $156,000, said Secretary of State Jim Edgar.
   The settlement also exceeds by nearly $1 million the highest
penalty collected by any of the 36 other states with which the New
York-based brokerage firm has reached agreements as a result of its
pleading guilty last September to federal mail and securities fraud
in U.S. District Court in Manhattan, Edgar said.
   In addition to the fine, Drexel agreed to pay for a
first-in-the-nation search for Illinois investors who may be
entitled to civil damages as a result of its fraudulent activities
from early 1984 to late 1986, Edgar told a news conference in
Chicago.
   Drexel also agreed to contribute $100,000 to an independent
foundation that will educate the public about securities markets
and safeguards to prevent fraud, Edgar said.
   ``This record settlement makes clear Illinois' firm commitment
to enforce the law and combat fraud,'' he said.
   ``Security fraud and stock price manipulation will not be
tolerated,'' Edgar said. ``The law is the law, whether you are a
nationwide, multimillion-dollar operator or a one-person storefront
shop.''
   Steven Anreder, a Drexel spokesman in New York, said the firm
was ``very pleased that we've been able to work to put this behind
us.''
   ``We're hopeful that we will resolve it with all the
jurisdictions ... and be able to move on,'' Anreder said.
   Drexel has yet to settle securities-fraud charges with 13
states, including New York and California, the only two states in
which the brokerage did more business than in Illinois.
   Edgar said the Illinois settlement stipulates that if Drexel
negotiates significantly higher settlements with California or New
York, the brokerage must increase the fine paid to Illinois to 53
percent of the California settlement and 66 percent of the New York
fine.
   ``We wanted to make sure our settlement was in the proper
perspective to those other settlements,'' Edgar said.
   The settlement allows Drexel to keep its brokerage license in
Illinois, although the company sold its retail brokerage business
last summer.
   Edgar said he rejected an initial Drexel settlement offer of
$400,000.
   Drexel pleaded guilty to six felony counts and paid $650 million
in fines and restitution to settle charges of insider trading and
other offenses brought during the government's three-year crackdown
on Wall Street crime.
   Edgar, whose office handles securities violations, driver and
vehicle licensing, and other functions, is seeking the GOP
nomination for governor in the March primary.

<HEAD>Quaker State Backs Up Oil With Engine Warranty</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OIL CITY, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Quaker State Corp. is offering a free
warranty on the lubricated engine parts of new cars for 10 years or
250,000 miles, extending warranties offered by automakers, said
President Jack W. Corn.
   New car owners must meet strict rules to qualify, including an
oil and filter change every four months or 4,000 miles by a lube
shop or auto dealer. The Quaker State warranty does not cover
claims already covered by auto manufacturers' warranties, but it
will pay for deductibles not covered by automaker extended service
contracts.
   ``We are providing every car owner who uses Quaker State
additional protection for a quarter of a million miles or 10
years,'' Corn said Wednesday in a news release.
   The Oil City-based refiner previously offered a similar but more
limited warranty available at fewer than 1,000 auto dealers
nationwide, the company said.
   But the new warranty ``goes beyond that,'' said spokesman Benton
H. Faulkner. ``Potentially, thousands of lube shops and auto
dealers will offer it,'' he said.
   In recent years, General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co., Chrysler
Corp. and other automakers have extended warranties on engines and
transmissions. Chrysler extended its coverage to five years or
50,000 miles and GM and Ford followed with six-year or 60,000-mile
coverage.
   Faulkner declined to reveal the cost of the warranty program. He
said only, ``Our estimate is that we can manage it.''
   He said Quaker State expects the warranty to increase sales of
motor oil.
   ``This reflects our conviction that more people are concerned
about caring for their vehicle properly,'' he said.
   The four-month, 4,000-mile oil and filter change requirement is
more strict than that recommended by auto manufacturers, Faulkner
said. But Quaker State has claimed for some time that motor oil
should be changed more often than those recommendations, he said.
   ``This puts us on the record as saying what people should do,''
he said.
   The warranty is being offered through auto dealers, service
stations and quick lube shops, Quaker State said.
   To enroll in the warranty program, car owners must sign up at
participating shops that sell Quaker State motor oil. New car
owners have six months from the date of purchase, or before the car
has 6,000 miles, to sign up.
   Quaker State said it will replace or repair lubricated engine
parts that fail or wear abnormally due to failure of its motor oil.
   To qualify for reimbursement, the company said, a new car owner
must keep records of oil changes, which must be submitted at the
time of a claim. Quaker State will pay for reasonable costs
associated with parts and labor.

<HEAD>Report Says Drilling Hit 10-Year Low in 1989</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of oil and gas wells drilled in the
United States last year was probably the lowest for any year in the
decade, according to an annual survey by Petroleum Information.
   ``It was the worst year because of fewer wells drilled, less oil
produced and the decline in gas production after it had been going
up,'' Jack Ekstrom, director of industry affairs for the energy
services reporting company owned by Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corp, said
Wednesday. ``What this means for the 1990s is that production will
decline even faster than it has been.''
   Petroleum Information expects well completions to total about
28,100 for 1989, Ekstrom said. The 1989 projection is 16 percent
below the 33,500 wells drilled in 1988, the previous low for the
decade.
   The worst year recorded by Petroleum Information was 1971, when
27,682 wells were drilled.
   The number of successful natural gas wells drilled last year
totaled 6,401 through year-end, up 8.8 percent from 5,882 a year
earlier. Meanwhile, the number of producing oil well completions
totaled 8,009, down a precipitous 26.6 percent from the 10,916
counted at the end of 1988.
   Texas led the nation with 7,116 completions of exploratory wells
through year-end. This figure exceeds Oklahoma with 2,070, Kansas
with 1,989 and California with 1,467. And Texas bucked the trend
with a higher success rate for wildcats, 23.6 percent compared with
21 percent in 1988.

<HEAD>Acres of Gadgetry at Disneyland for Adults</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT MACY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Acres of glitz and gadgetry go on display
Saturday as the 1990 Winter Consumer Electronics Show _ a
Disneyland for adults _ opens here.
   The four-day show is designed to showcase what's hot for the
consumer as the electronics industry enters its eighth decade.
   ``We're going to see all kinds of better mousetraps,'' Cynthia
Upson, director of communications for the show, said Thursday.
   Some 70,000 manufacturers, dealers and journalists from the U.S.
and 80 foreign countries are expected to view thousands of products
showcased over 800,000 square feet of display space. Some 1,400
exhibitors are displaying 95 product lines at the city's convention
center and four major hotels.
   The show is closed to the public.
   One of the highlights of the show will be the merger of audio
and video products to create a total `home theater' environment.
CES will showcase state-of-the-art home theater _ customized audio
and video products _ in the grand ballroom of the new Mirage Hotel.
   ``We're really excited about this new exhibit area because it's
the first time we have consolidated products which bring high
fidelity audio and premium video technology into the home,'' said
CES vice president Dennis Corcoran. ``It appears that the `90s will
bring consumers more enjoyment in home entertainment than ever
before.''
   Ms. Upson calls the home theater concept ``one of the most
exciting areas of technology we're seeing emerge in the 1990s.''
   Also spotlighted this year will be the growing trend of creating
offices in the home. Recent statistics show that nearly 25 million
Americans currently work at home, and approximately 25 percent of
those households contain two home-based professionals, Corcoran
said.
   ``You are going to see a lot of personal electronics at the
show, items that can be used in the home office such as
translators, computers, and hand held items you can take on the
go,'' Ms. Upson said. ``Now you can take a fax machine and cellular
phone with you, and can fax something back to your office.''
   Another major feature will be home automation.
   ``This system enables all the different appliances and consumer
electronics products to talk to each other,'' Ms. Upson said. ``You
can use your telephone to lock doors while you're away, turn on
alarm systems, turn on the dishwasher, program the VCR, set heating
or air conditioning.
   ``Last year home automation was still on the drawing boards, the
engineers were still trying to iron out standards for
manufacturers,'' she said. ``Now the standard has been developed
and we're ready to go with the product.
   ``This year we will reach the point where the consumer can buy
the product and add it to their home,'' Ms. Upson said.
   Other exhibits will range from telephone products and
accessories to adult video software.
   The shows are held twice annually _ in Las Vegas in January and
in Chicago in the summertime.
   The shows have been held since 1967, and are sponsored by the
Electronic Industries Association, a Washington, D.C.-based trade
association representing most manufacturers of audio, video and
home information products in the U.S.
   The industry produced a record $33 billion in products last year.

   A group of European central banks launched a
surprise attack on the dollar Thursday that sent the U.S. currency
tumbling around the world.
   Gold prices were mixed. On the Commodity Exchange in New York,
gold bullion for current delivery settled at $398.60 a troy ounce,
up $4.60 from Wednesday. Republic National Bank in New York quoted
a late bid for gold at $398.75 an ounce, up $4.40.
   West Germany's Bundesbank, accompanied by the Bank of England
and the Swiss national bank, caught dealers by surprise when they
began selling dollars during European trading hours.
   The moves ``scared a lot of people,'' said Pat Magill, chief
corporate dealer at Daiwa Bank Ltd. in London.
   The dollar's biggest drop came against the West German mark. The
U.S. currency touched levels against the mark not seen in about 19
months. When trading concluded in New York, the currency had lost
about 4 pfennigs, falling to 1.6800 marks, its lowest level since
May 11, 1988, when it finished at 1.6773 marks.
   ``The dollar got hammered, really destroyed,'' said Scott
Horwitz, a vice president at the Bank of Boston's New York office.
``People got really nervous, and it compounded itself in the
afternoon with more sell orders.''
   Traders were shocked by the speed with which the dollar
declined. The dollar had been gaining strength since last week, but
``it was not that huge of a rally ... the dollar was not all that
high. People weren't really looking'' for any intervention to push
it lower, said Jim Chorek, an analyst with Money Market Services
International in Chicago.
   Volume was heavy. Chorek said rumors that the Federal Reserve
was monitoring dollar rates ``really nailed (the dollar) again.''
Traders could not determine whether the Fed actually had entered
the market to sell dollars.
   The dollar declined sharply against all major currencies except
the Canadian dollar. Chorek said breaking the 1.6750-mark level
during the day was ``a real bad sign'' and predicted the dollar
could fall as low as 1.5600 marks.
   Traders speculated the Bundesbank intervened because it was
disappointed with the mark's recent, relative weakness.
   The tumultuous activity stole attention from any anticipation of
Friday's release of unemployment data for December. ``People are
just squaring whatever damage is done and calling it a day,''
Horwitz said.
   In New York, the dollar closed at 143.65 yen, down sharply from
145.25 yen on Wednesday. The dollar fell in London to 143.30 yen.
   Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar rose to a closing 145.20 Japanese
yen, from 143.40 yen at Friday's finish. A prolonged New Year's
holiday closed Japanese markets earlier in the week.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.6290, from $1.6080 late
Wednesday. In New York, it cost $1.6350 to buy one pound, more
expensive than Wednesday's $1.6115.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late rates
Wednesday, included: 1.6800 West German marks, down from 1.7208;
1.5395 Swiss francs, down from 1.5785; 5.7450 French francs, down
from 5.8765; 1,263.00 Italian lire, down from 1,289.00, and 1.1607
Canadian dollars, up from 1.1599.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Wednesday
included: 1.6825 West German marks, down from 1.7203; 1.5410 Swiss
francs, down from 1.5722; 5.7500 French francs, down from 5.8745;
1.9275 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9370; 1,265.25 Italian lire,
down from 1,286.00, and 1.1610 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1602.
   Gold fell in London to a late bid of $395.00 a troy ounce from
$395.60 late Wednesday. In Zurich, the metal rose to a closing bid
of $395.70, from $395.25 bid late Wednesday. Earlier in Hong Kong,
gold fell $1.40 to close at a bid $394.89.
   Silver prices rose. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for
current deliver finished at $5.268 an ounce, from $5.151 on
Wednesday. In London the metal rose to a late bid price of $5.22 a
troy ounce, from $5.16 bid late Wednesday.

   Stock prices lost ground Thursday amid
increasing doubts about the staying power of the rally that greeted
the start of 1990.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 56.95 points Tuesday
but down 0.42 on Wednesday, dropped 13.65 to 2,796.08.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 7 to 5 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
645 up, 924 down and 418 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 177 million shares,
against 192.33 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 239.28 million shares.
   Analysts said the market appeared to be suffering, a bit
paradoxically, from signs that the economy was maintaining
stronger-than-expected momentum as the new year began.
   That dampened hopes for any further easing soon in the Federal
Reserve's credit policy, and raised new questions about the outlook
for interest rates.
   Losers among the blue chips included Philip Morris, down 1{ at

<HEAD>Zenith Protest of Unisys Contract Settled</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BLUE BELL, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Zenith Data Systems Corp. has agreed to
drop its protest against a $706 million Air Force contract to rival
Unisys Corp. for desktop computer equipment, both companies said
Thursday.
   Lawyers for the companies, an intervenor and the Air Force
reached a settlement Wednesday evening that asks the General
Services Administration's Board of Contract Appeals to dismiss the
protest.
   GSA spokesman Steve Guiheen said the dismissal would probably be
issued in one or two days.
   The Desktop III contract calls for Unisys, a computer
manufacturer based in Blue Bell, to make equipment that combines
two of the most widely used desktop operating systems _ UNIX and
MS-DOS.
   The equipment would give the government wide flexibility in the
types of programs it can run and the types of machines with which
it can communicate.
   Zenith Data Systems, based in Mount Prospect, Ill., held the
Defense Department's two previous desktop computer contracts and
had vigorously sought the Desktop III contract.
   ``We maintained from the beginning that the protest was without
merit,'' James McGuirk, Unisys vice president and general manager
of aerospace operations, said in a statement.
   Unisys hopes ``to gain significant market share in the desktop
arena'' as a result of the project, McGuirk said.
   Zenith Data Systems and the intervenor, Government Technical
Services Inc., will be allowed to buy or license up to two units of
any Unisys product offered under the contract at a 30 percent
discount, according to the three-page settlement.
   The Air Force agreed to start its functional test demonstration
by Jan. 24 at Gunter Air Force Base near Montgomery, Ala.
   Zenith Data Systems, which was sold last week by Zenith
Electronics Corp. to Groupe Bull of France, had alleged violation
of the Trade Agreements Act, improper evaluation of proposals and
failure by Unisys to meet minimum requirements of the contract
specifications.
   ``We are disappointed by the award of the contract to a
competitor, but through discovery and the settlement, all of our
concerns about the fairness of the competition and the adequacy of
the contract are alleviated,'' Tom Buchsbaum, Zenith Data Systems'
vice president for federal systems, said from Vienna, Va.

   Westinghouse Broadcasting Co. said Thursday it
had paid $18.7 million for a 15 percent stake in Castle Rock
Entertainment, a television and motion picture production company.
   Group W Productions, a subsidiary of New York-based Westinghouse
Broadcasting, and Los Angeles-based Castle Rock will establish a
division to produce television programming for first-run
syndication, Westinghouse Broadcasting said in a written statement.
   Management of the unit will be the responsibility of Castle

   ``This move is consistent with our strategy to expand our
interests in the programming-production arena,'' said Derk
Zimmerman, president of Group W.
   Castle Rock, founded in 1987, produces ``Ann Jillian'' for NBC
and is working on two other network television comedies to be
launched later this year. It also produced ``When Harry Met Sally

<HEAD>Money Supply Rises</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The three leading measures of the nation's money
supply rose in the week ended Dec. 25, the Federal Reserve Board
reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose
to a seasonally adjusted $802.4 billion from $795.5 billion the
previous week.
   The measure known as M2 rose to a seasonally adjusted $3,227.1
billion from $3,215.7 billion.
   An even broader measure, M3, rose to a seasonally adjusted
$4,043.1 billion from $4,036.6 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   The annual growth rate in M2 so far this year is 4.5 percent,
which is within the Fed's target range of 3 percent to 7 percent.
The annual growth rate in M3 is 3.3 percent, which is below the
Fed's target range of 3.5 percent to 7.5 percent. The Fed has not
set a target for M1 growth since early 1987.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3,191.2 billion, a 7.6
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous
13 weeks. M3 averaged $4,022.2 billion, up 2.5 percent, while M1
rose 6.5 percent to an average of $790.6 billion.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window, excluding extended credit,
averaged $503 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, up from
$496 million the previous week.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $293.7 billion in the two-week period ended
Dec. 27, down from $295.7 billion two weeks earlier.

<HEAD>Pork Futures Score Limit Gains On USDA Report</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Hog and pork belly futures prices shot up their permitted daily
limits Thursday after the Agriculture Department issued a quarterly
hogs and pigs tally that showed far fewer animals than traders had
expected.
   On other commodity markets, energy and orange juice futures
turned lower; precious metals advanced strongly; and grains and
soybeans were mixed.
   Hog futures settled 1.5 cents higher across the board on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange with the contract for delivery in
February at 50.5 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were 2 cents
higher across the board with February at 51.47 cents a pound.
   Live cattle futures settled .20 cent lower to .40 cent higher
with February at 76.95 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged
to .35 cent higher with January at 84.55 cents a pound.
   Market analysts had predicted limit gains in the pork complex
following Wednesday's USDA hogs and pigs inventory report, which
showed a 3 percent drop in the national herd size from the end of
1988 to the end of 1989.
   The report also indicated that springtime farrowing intentions _
a measure of expected herd expansion _ were down 6 percent from a
year ago.
   The report surprised most analysts, whose observations of
slaughter rates relative to the September report had led them to
expect little change in the December tally.
   One reason for the decline in herd size was the USDA's sharp
downward revision in the September inventory. Some analysts found
the revision especially disturbing because the USDA in September
had revised sharply upward the June inventory number.
   ``It's really casting a little bit of doubt on the credibility
of the hog numbers being released by the USDA,'' said analyst Dale
Durchholz of AgriVisor Services Inc. in Bloomington, Ill. ``It
makes you wonder what the actual benchmark is.''
   Charles Levitt, senior livestock analyst with Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc., was more blunt.
   ``The numbers just don't make sense,'' he said. ``We are being
kicked around back and forth from one report to the next simply to
make the inventory figure fit the subsequent slaughter.''
   Orange juice and energy futures turned lower, ending steep
runups in those markets linked to the December cold spell, which
damaged the Florida orange crop, sharply boosted heating-oil
demand, froze some oil refineries and taxed others to the breaking
point.
   ``I think it was just a lot of liquidation,'' said energy
analyst Andrew Lebow of E.D.&amp; F. Man International Futures Inc.
``The crude-oil market had gone up about $2 iin three days. That's
a huge move and the market was a little tired.''
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled .27 cent to .57 cent
lower on the New York Mercantile Exchange with February at $23.41 a
barrel; heating oil was 1.45 cents to 5.01 cents lower with
February at 73.19 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 1.25 cents
to 1.94 cents lower with February at 65.29 cents a gallon.
   Brazilian authorities announced a resumption of orange juice
exports to the United States after a week's suspension, which
contributed to the drop in orange juice futures prices.
   Orange juice futures finished 1.05 cents to 3 cents lower on the
New York Cotton Exchange with January at $1.71 a pound.
   Precious metals futures rebounded after two days of deep losses.
Platinum led the rally as Japanese buyers returned to the market
after a five-day New Year's break.
   On the New York Merc, platinum futures soared $16.30 to $18.90
with January settling at $488.70 a troy ounce.
   On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold futures settled $4.40 to
$5.30 higher with February at $400.80 a troy ounce; silver was 11.5
cents to 12.5 cents higher with March at $5.335 a troy ounce.
   Soybean futures prices finished moderately lower and sharply
below the day's highs on the Chicago Board of Trade as early
excitement about new export business gave way to bearish technical
signals.
   Soybean futures settled } cent to 5 cents lower with January at
$5.63\ a bushel; wheat futures were } cent lower to { cent higher
with March at $4.09\ a bushel; corn was \ cent lower to 1{ cents
higher with March at $2.38\ a bushel; oats were 1\ cents to 3 cents

<HEAD>Bridgestone-Firestone Recalls Certain Truck Tires</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AKRON, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bridgestone-Firestone Inc. announced a recall
Thursday of 86,000 radial truck tires, warning of potential
cracking in the inner lining of a certain tire model.
   Most of the recall tires were sold by independent Firestone
dealers. The tires were sold across the nation, said Firestone
spokesman Bob Troyer.
   He said replacement tires have an average selling price of $250
each. Firestone brand dealers and stores were being notified
Thursday.
   The defect could result in sidewall failure, but there has been
no report of any accident or injury resulting from the condition,
the company said in a statement.
   The recall involved over-the-road, drive-axle truck tires with
the model designation T546 PSD Radial, in sizes 10R22.5, 11R22.5,
11R24.5, 295-75R22.5 and 285-75R24.5.
   The tires were produced the past two years at a company plant in
Bilbao, Spain.
   The potential defect was noticed when some of the tires in
question were checked after road damage of during retreading.
   ``We want to be certain that our customers obtain the maximum
potential from Firestone radial truck tires both during the
original tread life and in the retread stage,'' said Thomas R.
Mertz, director of sales and marketing for Firestone brand tires.
   ``Therefore, on a voluntary basis, we are initiating this recall
today to replace these tires,'' he said. Only the tubeless tires
are involved, he added.
   Troyer also on Thursday confirmed an Akron Beacon Journal report
that the company has targeted some 80 of its MasterCare stores for
sale or closing. MasterCare is a 1,600-store chain.
   Troyer said the closings or sale of stores are in the normal
course of business and do not reflect a financial problem.
   ``We review our stores continuously on profits, marginability
and that sort of thing,'' Troyer said. ``In the normal course of
doing business, we review the operations of our network of stores.
Over the years, we have closed stores which were not profitable or
were marginal.
   ``We are currently reviewing about 80 to determine whether or
not they will be closed or perhaps sold to an independent tire
dealer. At the same time, we are reviewing sites to add stores in
an aggressive program to add MasterCare outlets.''
   The Chicago-based Bridgestone-Firestone is presently relocating
its corproate headquaters to Akron, which had long been
headquarters of the former Firestone Tire &amp; Rubber Co.

   Energy prices fell sharply Thursday as traders
decided to sell after two days of strong gains.
   The contract for February delivery of West Texas Intermediate,
the benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil, fell 27 cents to $23.41 per
42-gallon barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, following a
79-cent rise on Wednesday and a jump of $1.07 on Tuesday.
   Prices of wholesale unleaded gasoline and home heating oil also
fell sharply.
   The February contract for gasoline, which surged 5.48 cents over
Tuesday and Wednesday, gave back some of those gains Thursday,
falling 1.94 cents to 65.29 cents a gallon.
   Heating oil skidded 5.01 cents to 73.19 cents a gallon, wiping
out the 3.95 cent gain it ran up the previous two sessions.
   Analysts attributed the rally earlier this week to strong
fundamental demand combined with speculative buying.
   Andrew Lebow, an energy market analyst at E.D.&amp;F. Man
International Futures Inc., said many traders, having watched the
market move steadily upward in recent weeks, decided to liquidate
some of their large positions on Thursday.
   An American Petroleum Institute report on Wednesday indicated
heating oil stocks were at their lowest levels in years, but the
markets appeared to be looking beyond those figures, Lebow said.
   Milder weather following the recent prolonged cold wave and
anticipation of new oil imports coming into the United States may
have been factors in Thursday's trading, he said.

<TEXT>
   William R. McLucas, new head of the Securities
and Exchange Commission's enforcement division, has been described
by some associates a low-key, down-to-earth guy. Others say he's an
intense lawman, savvy in stuff they don't teach in law school.
   But most agree that when SEC Chairman Richard C. Breeden tapped
McLucas, a 12-year SEC veteran, for what is widely perceived as the
second most important job in the agency, it was a vote of
confidence in the SEC staff.
   ``The world sort of saw this as an in-house race between McLucas
and several other senior staffers at the SEC,'' said John Coffee, a
professor of securities law at Columbia University. Picking an
outsider ``would have had a demoralizing effect on the staff,''
said Coffee.
   ``It's commendable that people are promoted within the ranks
when they deserve it and from what I've heard about him _ he
deserves it,'' said Paul Curran, a prominent New York defense
attorney.
   Breeden, only on the job since October himself, announced his
selection of McLucas, 39, on the day after Christmas _ ending
months of speculation about who would succeed Gary Lynch as Wall
Street's top cop.
   Lynch, who headed the enforcement division for four years before
leaving public service last summer, led the SEC's campaign against
insider trading and other abuses by Ivan Boesky and other prominent
Wall Street professionals.
   The choice of McLucas seemed to please almost everyone, from
federal prosecutors to securities industry lawyers _ who are
themselves mostly former government lawyers.
   ``He's a really smart and extremely personable guy,'' said Alan
Cohen, head of the securities fraud unit of the U.S. attorney's
office in Manhattan.
   Cohen's boss, U.S. Attorney Otto G. Obermaier, said he hadn't
been in contact with McLucas since taking over as top federal
prosecutor in Manhattan, ``but in my former life (as a prominent
white collar criminal defense attorney), I dealt with him almost
all the time. We didn't always agree on issues but I always found
him fair, accessible, ready to reconsider a point of law.''
   ``We see appointing someone from the staff as a continuation of
their policies,'' said Susan E. Bryant, administrator of the
Oklahoma Department of Securities, a state-level version of the SEC.
   ``We were glad to see Chairman Breeden appoint someone from the
staff who is familiar with the issues,'' said Ms. Bryant, who is
also president of a national organization of state-level securities
regulators, the North American Securities Administrators
Association.
   ``I do not think you could have had a more impressive choice,''
said Harvey Pitt, a prominent Washington lawyer who represented
Boesky when the takeover stock speculator was nabbed in the insider
trading scandals.
   Pitt, a former SEC lawyer himself who has known McLucas for
years, said the new SEC enforcement chief is personable but ``he
can be very tough, very forceful and energetic.''
   Even Arthur Mathews, a Washington securities lawyer who had been
touting a member of his firm, Robert McCaw, for the enforcement
post, said McLucas was a good choice.
   ``I don't think anybody inside the SEC would've compared to
McCaw, but once the chairman chose to go inside rather than
outside, I think McLucas was the best choice,'' said Mathews.
   ``McLucas is very well liked and well respected by the bar, by
the internal staff and by the investment community,'' said Mathews.
   Asked if it was wise to have an enforcement chief that everybody
liked, Mathews said ``by like, I mean respect.''
   When people describe McLucas, they use words like ``quiet,''
``confident'' and ``compassionate.''
   But Lynch, McLucas's predecessor, said he knows that such
descriptions of incoming office holders can get excessive.
   ``I was described in so many newspaper stories as `soft-spoken'
I thought I should start screaming,'' said Lynch, now in private
practice in New York.
   ``I wouldn't describe Bill as low-key at all. I think he's a
very intense person as a matter of fact. He certainly has a lot of
common sense.''
   If McLucas is down-to-earth, said Lynch it's because he has
``the knowledge you don't get in law school.''
   McLucas, who is said to smoke a pipe occasionally and follow the
football fortunes of his alma mater, declined to be interviewed,
stating it was too soon for him to be talking to reporters.
   ``My preference is to get my sleeves rolled up and get the cases
going and then give interviews,'' he said during one of the few
intervals when he wasn't in a meeting or on the telephone last week.
   A native of western Pennsylvania, McLucas graduated Pennsylvania
State University in 1972 with honors in political science and a Phi
Beta Kappa key.
   He attended Temple University's School of Law in Philadelphia
where he got his degree in 1975.
   After a two years as an attorney with the Federal Home Loan Bank
Board, McLucas joined the SEC's Enforcement Division in 1977 and
rose from staff attorney in the enforcement division to branch
chief, assistant director and finally one of three associate
directors under Lynch.
   While one of his in-house competitors, associate director John
Sturc, made a reputation handling the SEC's cases against invesment
banking house Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and Boesky, McLucas led
the agency's cases against former Singer Corp. chairman Paul
Bilzerian, California brokerage founder Boyd Jefferies and Rooney
Pace, a defunct brokerage.
   ``He's had his fingers in the bread and butter cases that don't
get the headlines like insider trading and parking,'' said Mathews,
who represented Bilzerian.

   Thousands of individuals and families who
thought they didn't qualify for a home mortgage might be pleasantly
surprised by relatively recent developments in an old law.
   Those developments enable some would-be buyers to qualify for
loans with minimum downpayments and less than the usual income
requirements, and to benefit from lower than normal closing costs.
   The Community Reinvestment Act was passed in 1977, but
implementation on a large scale remained rather dormant until the
past few years. Now it has been given a big push by Congress and by
private-sector institutions.
   The latter, however, needed prodding themselves before they were
convinced of the viability of the act's central theme, which is to
compel lenders to provide mortgage financing equitably in all areas
of their communities.
   Implementation was delayed also by confusion among lenders, by a
failure of regulatory agencies to enforce compliance and simply by
the effort needed to convince lenders that poor people could be
good credit risks.
   That educational effort was pushed largely by the National
Training &amp; Information Center, a nonprofit, Chicago-based agency
that trains community action groups in dealing with various social
challenges.
   A big breakthrough occurred in September, when General Electric
Capital Corp. developed a packaged program enabling laggard lenders
to minimize risk in making loans to those who otherwise wouldn't
qualify.
   GE Capital has signed up lenders throughout the country to offer
the package, which involves a buyer education program, more
flexible qualification criteria and mortgage insurance.
   Such loans then would qualify for sale by the lender to the
Federal National Mortgage Association, or Fannie Mae, and the
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., or Freddie Mac.
   The package benefits borrowers in a various others ways, among
them:
   _They can designate a higher portion of their income (33
percent) to monthly housing expenses than the ratio (28 percent)
accepted for traditional financing.
   _The traditional cash reserve requirement of two monthly
mortgage payments is waived.
   _If the borrower hasn't develped a credit history, his or her
payment record for expenses such as rent and utilities is
acceptable in establishing credit worthiness.
   _In some instances, subsidized second mortgages may be employed
to reduce housing costs.
   Education is at the foundation of GE's Community Home Buyer's
Program. It involves four sessions of two hours each, plus two
follow-up sessions, taught locally by the lender's personnel.
   The course explains the roles of participants in the application
and approval process, the savings and income needed, household
budgeting, credit reports, home selection, pre-sale inspections and
tax and equity advantages.
   Forty-six institutions, covering the entire country, have signed
up for the package, said Jeannette Bernay of GE capital in Raleigh,
N.C.
   She said about 10,000 borrowers will be accommodated in the
initial phase of the program, but that already there are hopes of
expanding. ``We think we can make money in this,'' she said.
   Convincing lenders and regulatory officials that loans to the
poor could be good business was a slow process, however. In some
instances, said Tom Schraw of the National Training &amp; Information
Center, community leaders got action only by raising the threat of
charter revocation.
   Good experience in Chicago and St. Louis helped. Lenders there
cooperated and helped establish a record. In a five-year period,
said Schraw, Chicago institutions lent $150 million with a default
rate of less than 1 percent.
   GE Capital's entrance into the picture, encouraged by such
experiences, now has given the effort a huge thrust, since it
provides lenders throughout the country with a turnkey program for
compliance with the law.
   Mortgage Guaranty Insurance Co. is testing a somewhat similar
program in Milwaukee, Des Moines and Knoxville, although that
company's major effort is in customized work for individual lenders.
   Those interested in obtaining local lenders affiliated with the
GE Capital program may call the company's Action Center at
1-800-444-5664.

<TEXT>
   Financially strapped Braniff Inc. on
Thursday announced David Murchison has been named the airline's new
chief executive officer.
   The appointment of Murchison, 41, was approved earlier in the
day by the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Orlando, according to a
statement released by Braniff.
   The appointment, requested by Braniff, was backed by the
airline's creditors in a bid to restore confidence in the company's
efforts to reorganize, according to the statement.
   Orlando-based Braniff said the appointment would bring new
direction to management at the cash-poor airline.
   On Sept. 28, Braniff filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection
from creditors, laid off all but a skeleton staff and halted all
regularly scheduled flights. That move followed an earlier fall
cutback in the number of scheduled flights and a round of layoffs.
   Murchison served as vice president, general counsel and
secretary of Braniff from September 1988 through Nov. 17, 1989.
   Prior to joining the carrier, he worked at Piedmont Aviation,
where he served as vice president and assistant general counsel
from 1985 to September 1988.
   Previously, Murchison was assistant general counsel and
secretary of the Air Transport Association for six years, after
serving two years as legal assistant to the vice chairman of the
Civil Aeronautics Board.

   Phoenix millionaire Charles H. Keating Jr.
testified Thursday he doesn't know who in his real estate and
thrift empire made the decision on a stock deal that stripped his
Lincoln Savings and Loan Association of up to $12 million in
potential profits.
   Testifying on his suit challenging the government's takeover
last April of his Irvine, Calif., thrift, Keating said he
personally had approved the Oct. 21, 1987 repurchase of Memorex
stock at twice the price Lincoln had sold it for four months
earlier.
   Federal regulators have focused on the Memorex deal and several
related transactions with Phoenix developer and stockbroker Ernest
C. Garcia as a centerpiece of their contention that Keating was
operating Lincoln in an ``unsafe and unsound manner.''
   A central figure in the savings and loan crisis and a related
congressional ethics scandal, Keating spent more than a hour
Thursday testifying about his use of Lincoln to finance massive
planned community projects in the Phoenix area.
   In its takeover and a related $1.1 billion fraud and
racketeering suit against Keating, the government contends his use
of federally insured deposits in Lincoln to finance his dreams may
eventually cost taxpayers up to $2 billion, making it the biggest
of nearly 600 S&amp;L failures since 1986.
   ``By losing the S&amp;L we lost the ability to complete this
program,'' Keating testified Thursday. ``The saddest thing in my
life is that we were brought to this pass.''
   Just two months ago, Keating had claimed a Fifth Amendment
protection against self-incrimination in refusing to answer
questions by the House Banking Committee, saying through attorneys
that he wanted a more objective forum for laying out his case.
   The Memorex deal was part of a series of interwoven transactions
with Garcia involving what the government says were ``sham'' land
deals to book phony profits.
   Those profits enabled American Continental to collect deferred
taxes from Lincoln on the deals. The source of those tax dollars
totaling $94 million between 1985 and 1988, regulators contend, was
actually federally insured deposits in Lincoln. No money was
actually ever paid to the government as taxes.
   Justifying their takeover of Lincoln, the regulators contend
that American Continental ``usurped a corporate right and
opportunity'' of the thrift to reap a $12 million profit in two
purchases and two sales of the same Memorex stock.
   The Memorex deals date back to December 1986 when Lincoln
acquired 79,275 shares for $1 each as a sweetener to a purchase of
$40 million of junk bonds as part of British financier Sir James
Goldsmith's attempt to take over the company.
   Lincoln, which eventually made a $1.5 million profit on the junk
bonds, sold the stock in June 1987 to Garcia for $1 million, with
an option to buy it back for a maximum price of $4.25 million
during the next 18 months.
   However, when the stock market crashed in October 1987, Garcia
was in desperate need for cash, Keating testified, and American
Continental purchased the Memorex stock from him for $2 million.
   Six months later, American Continental sold the stock for $13.2
million, reaping a $12 million profit that the government says
should have gone to Lincoln.
   Keating testified that he was in Europe when Garcia wanted to
sell the stock and that he approved having either American
Continental or Lincoln buy it back.
   ``I don't believe that I made the decision where to put it,'' he
said. ``I don't know who made the decision on waiving the
(Lincoln's buyback) option.''
   Another reason that Lincoln did not repurchase the stock,
Keating said, is that the thrift ``at the time was under tremendous
pressure from the regulators not to be in the equity business.''
   His son, Charles H. Keating III, then chairman of a Lincoln
subsidiary that held the option, testified earlier that he signed
the waiver but had no detailed knowledge of the repurchase option
and was not otherwise involved in the deal.
   ``It was a large company and there were a lot of deals going
on,'' the younger Keating said. ``We have to rely on experts ... I
would sign my name on something they did. I had a lot of faith in
these people ... I would stake my life on what they did.''
   The elder Keating said he bought Lincoln in 1984 after both the
federal government and California deregulated the S&amp;L industry so
that thrifts could make direct investments in real estate.
Previously, the great bulk of an S&amp;L's investments had to be in
home mortgages.
   ``I saw the S&amp;L as a place to do land development and housing,''
he said. ``Ninety percent of what we do is housing. You could do
precisely what we did with Lincoln at the time we bought it.''

   The U.S. dollar plunged against the Japanese yen at
the start of the trading session Friday, while the key index on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange rebounded slightly.
   The dollar opened in Tokyo at 143.40 yen, down 1.80 yen from
Thursday's 145.20-yen finish here after attacks on the U.S.
currency overnight by a group of European central banks, including
those in West Germany, Britain and Switzerland.
   The dollar, which tumbled against almost all major currencies
around the world, ended at 143.58 yen in New York overnight.
   ``The dollar declined sharply after the surprise interventions
in Europe to support the (West German) mark, as well as
dollar-selling by the Bank of Japan to save the yen,'' said
Masafumi Koyama, a trader with the Bank of Tokyo.
   ``After such wild fluctuations in one day, most market players
have to make position adjustments,'' he said. ``Currency rates will
move narrowly as participants won't make major moves while awaiting
the releases of the U.S. economic indicators later today.''
   The dollar is likely to remain between 143 yen and 144 yen,
Koyama added.
   The United States will announce the nation's jobless rate for
December and factory orders later Friday in Washington.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues recouped 49.72 points, or 0.13 percent, to move to 38,762.60
within the first 15 minutes of trading. The index shed 202.99
points Thursday, largely due to discouragement over the yen's
weakness.
   Kazuhiro Nomura, a dealer with New Japan Securities Co., said
the index rose as the yen's quick recovery reassured stock
investors.
   ``The index fell more than it should yesterday, and market
players are making adjustments by buying back issues,'' he said.

<HEAD>Fired Keating Hotel Workers File $42 Million Lawsuit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY LOPEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Twenty-one former employees of Charles H. Keating
Jr.'s Phoenix hotels filed a $42 million lawsuit Thursday against a
federal official who fired them last fall in what their lawyer
called ``an early-morning, Gestapo-like raid.''
   The lawsuit, filed in Maricopa County Superior Court, claims the
workers were fired improperly, treated ``like common criminals''
and refused severance pay or references in many instances.
   Named as defendants were Herbert Chin, a senior investigations
specialist with the federal Resolution Trust Corp.'s regional
office in Denver, and three former Keating companies that are now
controlled by the RTC.
   Chin, in a telephone interview, said he had not seen the lawsuit
but believed his actions were proper.
   The suit does not name the federal government itself, but could
be amended later to include the government, according to Kraig
Marton, the lawyer who filed it.
   The hotels, the Phoenician and the Crescent, are owned by
companies that are 55 percent owned by Lincoln Savings and Loan
Association and 45 percent by a group of Saudi Arabian investors.
   Keating controlled Lincoln until federal banking regulators
seized control last year, saying the thrift was in danger of
collapse.
   Keating remained in control of the two hotels as long as the
Saudis sided with him, however, and it was not until Nov. 16 that
the federal regulators won agreement from the Saudis and seized
control of the hotels.
   They moved in at 2 a.m., posting termination notices at the
homes of the employees and allowing them to collect their
belongings from the hotels under guard and while being videotaped
by guards and news organizations.
   Chin said that the regulators picked 2 a.m. as the time to fire
the workers in order to minimize disruption and that extra security
and videotapes were meant to ensure that no one later claimed to be
missing property.
   But Marton alleges in his lawsuit that the way the firings were
handled caused great emotional distress.
   The government made it look like the fired workers were ``so
dishonest as to require a large body of guards, many armed and in
uniform, to be present'' and treated them ``like common criminals''
as the media recorded the events, Marton said.
   Marton also said in his suit that Chin and the companies under
RTC control fired the workers without sufficient cause, refused to
give many of them severance pay and refused to provide job
references.
   Chin said he did not believe most of the workers had contracts
specifying what was needed in order to justify a firing. He also
said he believed all the fired clerical workers had been given
severance pay and that the workers should seek job references from
the Keating group rather than the government.

<HEAD>11,000 Positions to be Eliminated at Pacific Telesis Division</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 11,000 jobs at Pacific Bell will be
eliminated during the next five years, largely through attrition
and an early retirement plan, officials of the Pacific Telesis unit
announced Thursday.
   ``Staffing requirements change over time in this dynamic
industry,'' PacBell President Phil Quigley said in a statement.
``What was appropriate in 1989 clearly will not be in 1994.''
   About 7,600 non-salaried jobs and 3,400 management positions
will be cut. They represent about 16 percent of the phone company's
work force.
   Since the 1984 breakup of American Telegraph &amp; Telephone Co.,
PacBell has reduced its work force by 17,000 to about 64,000
employees.
   PacBell serves more than 11 million customers throughout
California.
   Pacific Bell and Nevada Bell Telephone Co. are two subsidiaries
of San Francisco-based Pacific Telesis, one of the seven ``Baby
Bells'' created by the breakup of AT&amp;T.
   Other regional phone companies have recently announced similar
labor cutbacks.
   Most employees will be offered an early retirement plan, PacBell
said. Some managers who are not eligible will be offered
retraining. Other jobs are expected to be eliminated through
attrition.

<HEAD>Japan, U.S. Disagree Over Trade Policies at Florida Meeting</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   HOWEY-IN-THE-HILLS, Fla. (AP) _ U.S. Agriculture Secretary
Clayton Yeutter bluntly told his counterpart from Japan on Thursday
that Japan would have to cooperate with the rest of the world in
removing protectionist barriers to trade, according to Yeutter and
others at the conference.
   Yeutter's comments at the gathering of agricultural leaders from
five of the world's top food-producing areas were in response to
the Japanese position that rice and other farm products vital to
that nation should be exempt from the more liberal trade policies
sought by other nations.
   The Japanese have for years closed off or severely restricted
certain imports, particularly agricultural products, because of
their professed need to be self-sufficient.
   Michihiko Kano, Japan's minister of agriculture, forestry and
fisheries, led a 1{ hour discussion on the subject at an informal,
closed-door gathering of agricultural leaders from Japan, the U.S.,
the European Community, Canada and Australia.
   ``We have to have a lot of debate with Japan over that,''
Yeutter told reporters afterwards.
   The informal sessions at central Florida hotel are being held in
the final year of the so-called Uruguay Round of negotiations for
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the international
organization based in Geneva. Ninety-six member nations of GATT
have presented position papers on a wide range of issues, and
negotiations are at a crucial stage.
   After the agreements are hammered out at the end of this year,
member countries will pass enabling legislation to enact the new
GATT policies.
   Also a major issue in the first session of the two-day gathering
_ described as the first of a series of casual get-togethers _ was
food safety.
   The ministers agreed to draft a crisis-management plan on
food-safety issues once Canada and other participants develop more
information and details on it.
   ``There were no real fireworks, but there were lively
discussions,'' said a member of the Canadian delegation. Kano's
presentation provoked the most comment.
   ``The Japanese want 100 percent self-sufficiency on rice and
perhaps on other products,'' Yeutter said, meaning that Japan wants
to continue shutting the door on imports of those products.
   ``We could make the same argument on industrial products'' such
as automobiles and television sets and limit exports of those to
this country, he said.
   ``This is not a one-way street: Japan cannot make protectionist
arguments on agriculture and expect liberalization arguments to
prevail in the industrial sector _ or vice-versa.''
   Yeutter said there has to be a common understanding in some
areas, ``and what that means is that Japan will have to find a way
to be accommodating on rice ... just as we'll have to find a way to
be accommodating in product areas where Japan and other countries
wish to expand exports to the United States.''
   Ray MacSharry, representing the 12-member European Community,
said he was philosophically in agreement with the Japanese over the
self-sufficiency issue.
   ``We do see food security as an important issue along the lines
the Japanese propose,'' MacSharry said. ``The U.S. seems to be very
strong on access (to the Japanese market) for rice.''
   Officials said there was general agreement to a presentation by
Canadian Agriculture Minister Donald F. Mazankowski that there was
a great need for a coordinated crisis management plan on food
safety.
   The problems created by the cyanide scare on Chilean grapes and
the emotional debate over the use of the chemical Alar on apples
make it mandatory that the countries involved in farm production
communicate better with each other and with consumers, Mazankowski
was quoted as saying.
   Another example cited by Yeutter of a problem that such a
crisis-management plan could prevent, or quickly solve, was the
Korean claim last summer that Florida growers were using Alar on
citrus.
   The Koreans halted imports of thousands of tons of Florida
grapefruit, causing heavy losses to producers until the industry
could persuade the Koreans that Alar was never used on citrus.
