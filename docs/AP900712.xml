   Two men were charged late Thursday with
murder in connection with the slaying of a Wesleyan University
student activist who police said had joined with them in a drug
distribution ring.
   Carl Lightner, 20, and Kumar Viswanathan, 21, were charged with
murder and conspiracy to commit murder in connection with the death
of Nicholas B. Haddad, who was found fatally shot in a car carrying
a cache of semiautomatic weapons.
   Lightner has been in custody since he was arrested July 7 on an
unrelated drug charge. He was to be arrested and arraigned on the
murder charges Friday. Bond on those charges was set at $550,000.
   Viswanathan was still at large late Thursday, police said. But a
Hartford Superior Court judge set his bond at $750,000. Authorities
said they believe Viswanathan has fled Hartford.
   Police said Haddad and the two suspects had set up a drug
distribution center in Hartford. Haddad supplied the cash and the
other men bought and sold the drugs, police said.
   Haddad was to receive a share of profits from sales made by the
other two. The two suspects reportedly lost or misspent a large sum
of Haddad's money and, fearing reprisal, plotted to kill him,
police said.
   Haddad was lured to Keney Park in Hartford on July 6 and shot to
death, police said.
   His participation in protests against the treatment of
minorities at Wesleyan and his recent purchases of semiautomatic
weapons had led authorities to wonder if the slaying was connected
to two firebombings at Wesleyan in April. But authorities no longer
think that is the case.
   Hartford State's Attorney John M. Bailey said police found
``absolutely no connection'' between the murder and activities on
the Wesleyan campus. Bailey also said there was no sign that the
slaying was racially motivated.
   Haddad, 21, a Lebanese-American who had spent about 17 years in
Lebanon, identified with the black community at Wesleyan. During
the spring, black students complained that police had unfairly
singled out Haddad and several other minority group members as
suspects in the firebombings.
   Police denied having any suspects, although a Hartford Courant
reporter visiting the Middletown police station reported seeing
memorandums posted identifying three students as principal suspects.
   Family members said they were just as puzzled as police over
what happened.
   In a eulogy at a funeral Mass on Wednesday, Haddad's cousin,
also named Nicholas Haddad, said his slain cousin had ``wanted to
embrace the person he had become, not the person we wanted him to
be.''
   ``We all worried about him in the end,'' said the cousin. He did
not elaborate.
   When Haddad's body was found, police said they recovered an
undisclosed number of semiautomatic weapons from the car, including
an Israeli-made Uzi he bought for $1,000.
   All were legally purchased last month from a gun shop three
miles from the campus of Wesleyan, an elite private university with
an enrollment of 2,700.
   Police said his interest in firearms had become an ``obsession''
in the past month.
   Reggie Cann, a Wesleyan graduate student, said he and Haddad
were both members of a support group for black students.
   ``He considered himself African,'' Cann said.
   ``He liked to live a mysterious life and it was hard to tell
when he was telling the truth,'' said one former Wesleyan student
who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Haddad, who listed Red Hook, N.Y., as his home address, was
co-editor of a new student publication called The Afrikan Nation
and had helped organize several rallies this spring protesting the
treatment of minorities at Wesleyan and around the world.
   The cover of the publication's first edition said: ``In creative
struggle, the embrace of love and war will give birth to the new
Afrikan nation.''
   Haddad and nine other students went on a nine-day hunger strike
in May following the discovery of racist graffiti in the basement
of a black student dormitory.
   The activists said the graffiti was the product of a climate of
racial intolerance at Wesleyan.
   Haddad had been notified in June that because of academic
deficiencies he would have to take at least two semesters off
before being considered for readmission, the university said. He
had, however, remained in the area after the end of the school year.
   University officials had only last semester named Haddad a
Mellon fellow, a fellowship intended to encourage top minority
students to pursue careers as professors.

<HEAD>AP and Technical Employees Set Non-Binding Arbitration</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Associated Press and its technical employees
have agreed to submit three areas of dispute in their contract
talks _ wages, pensions and health benefits _ to non-binding
arbitration.
   A representative of the AP and a representative of the
Communications Workers of America were to discuss those issues in a
non-binding arbitration process starting today, it was announced
Wednesday.
   That process was to last 48 hours under the terms of the expired
contract between the union and the news service. At the end of that
period the two sides could select an outside arbitrator if there
were unresolved issues.
   On July 3 the CWA said a proposed two-year contract had been
voted down overwhelmingly. No vote totals were announced.
   The 300 technical employees affected have been working under
contract extensions since early June.
   The AP has urged the adoption of a ``managed care'' approach to
control the cost of the medical plan and offered weekly pay
increases of $23.50 for top-scale technical employees in the first
year and $24 in the second year, bringing weekly top-scale salaries
to $612 in 1991.
   The union wants a larger raise and wants the company to pay a
larger portion of health care costs.
   The union also has proposed pension increases which the company
has declined to offer.

   The government has decided that hundreds of
Soviet Jews seeking asylum in East Germany can stay, although they
entered the country with tourist visas rather than the required
residency permits.
   The decision Wednesday ends weeks of uncertainty for nearly 400
Soviet Jews who have settled in East Germany since April.
   Interior Ministry spokesman Achim Hildebrandt said, however,
that the thousands of Romanians who have been flooding into East
Germany will be considered for asylum only on a case-by-case basis.
   East Germany, now on the threshold of uniting with wealthy West
Germany, has turned into a magnet for asylum-seekers from other
Eastern European nations facing a bleaker economic future.

   Republican National Committee Chairman Lee
Atwater was admitted to George Washington University Hospital on
Wednesday for tests in connection with a brain tumor discovered
earlier this year.
   Atwater has been treated on an outpatient basis since undergoing
surgery and radiation therapy at the hospital to shrink the tumor.
   Atwater's press secretary, Leslie Goodman, said he would remain
in the hospital overnight for ``routine testing.''
   She said doctors are performing blood tests and plan to scan
Atwater's left leg.
   ``This is nothing out of the ordinary. Everything is great,''
said Goodman in a telephone interview late Wednesday. ``There is a
consensus among his doctors that the tumor is not growing.''
   Two weeks ago, the GOP chairman visited the party headquarters
in Washington for the first time since he collapsed during a
political speech in March.
   Atwater re-entered the hospital as the Republican Party prepared
to convene in Chicago on Thursday for its mid-year meeting.

   The sun sets in the east in hospital
room No. 25 at Stanford University Medical Center, where heart
transplant patients are more used to medical miracles than natural
wonders.
   The reversed sunset actually is the work of photographer Joey
Fischer, who installed three fake windows in the hospital's cardiac
unit to comply with a state law that requires all rooms to have
windows.
   Dr. Patricia Chase, who approved the deal for the state, said
she did so to save scarce hospital space for cardiac patients. She
called the fake window an ``innovative approach,'' although she
agreed it wasn't a window by strict definition.
   Without windows, the hospital stood to lose the $5,000-a-day
rent from the three double rooms that used to have windows before
they were remodeled to accommodate construction of an operating
room.

   President Bush, testily rebutting criticism that
he lacks environmental commitment, said he wasn't looking for a
``brownie point'' when he and his economic summit partners issued
an environmental statement which left conservation groups
disappointed.
   ``We cannot govern by listening to the loudest voice on the
extreme of an environmental movement,'' Bush told a news conference
after being accused of inaction on global warming and a weak
overall environmental declaration.
   Environmental groups were ready with critical statements
Wednesday when the seven leaders of industrialized Economic Summit
nations released their communique.
   The Sierra Club accused the leaders of hiding inaction on global
warming behind ``a figleaf on rain forests'' even though the summit
pledged to work for a major international program to fight
deforestation.
   The ``Envirosummit'' coalition of prominent environmental
organizations blasted the leaders' ``disunity and inaction,'' and
Wilderness Society President George Frampton said Bush had lulled
the other leaders ``into an environmental sleep that abandons their
commitment to advance solutions to the world's most pressing
ecological problems.''
   Asked for a response, Bush told a news conference, ``Look, I'm
not going to respond to those groups that have been attacking us
every time we turn around. ...On the environmental extreme, they
don't want this country to grow. They don't want to take the look
down the road at the human consequence of men and women thrown out
of work and families put into a whole new state of anxiety.''
   In an uncharacteristic attack on environmental groups, Bush
continued, ``And I did not rely heavily on them for support in
getting elected president of the United States. And I'm not going
to be persuaded that I can get some brownie point by appealing to
one of these groups or other.''
   Bush, during his presidential campaign repeatedly asserted ``I
am an environmentalist.''
   As president, he has invited environmental activists to present
their points of view at the White House, but the environmental
groups have grown disenchanted with the access, complaining that he
has dragged his feet on environmental action and policies.
   Bush appointed a respected environmental leader, William Reilly,
as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, but Reilly
was not among the high-ranking officials who accompanied the
president to the Economic Summit.
   The summit declaration sidestepped divisive global warming
issues, and instead emphasized forestry protection.
   The seven leaders pledged to negotiate an international
agreement on ways to curb deforestation as expeditiously as
possible, and promised to complete the plan by 1992.
   The global warming language was general and called for an
international convention on the subject also to be completed by
1992. The United Nations is already working on the issue.
   The Bush administration quashed European efforts to impose
specific reduction goals on carbon dioxide emissions, seen as a
major cause of global warming.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said Germany had wanted
tougher language on greenhouse gas emissions, but added, ``We can
live with'' the communique.
   Bush told his news conference that, ``We came out with a
reasoned position, not a radical position that's going to throw a
lot of American men and women out of jobs.''

   Hollywood executives weren't commenting
Wednesday on allegations that the entertainment industry is run by
Jews who discriminate against blacks. One insider said responding
could only hurt.
   Studio executives at 20th Century Fox, Paramount Pictures,
Columbia Pictures, Universal Pictures and the Walt Disney Co.
declined to comment on the charges leveled Tuesday at the annual
convention of the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People.
   One studio executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
responding would be a ``no-win'' situation.
   Marla Gibbs, a producer and star of the NBC sitcom ``227,'' said
Tuesday during a workshop at the convention: ``I think we're all
talking about film distribution and marketing based on how the
Jewish people and the other people set it up. It was not set up for
us. So we have a problem. We have to use what we have.''
   NBC spokeswoman Susan Binford would not respond to the
allegations made at the NAACP gathering, but said, ``NBC is
constantly striving to produce a balance of views and people and
issues.''
   A number of NAACP delegates said they agreed blacks have been
discriminated against in the entertainment industry and elsewhere.
   But none interviewed Wednesday singled out the Jewish community
for criticism.
   ``I think we as minorities need to pull together,'' said Wanda
Woods, a delegate from Texas. ``I think we should fight to wipe out
racism, no matter where it is occurring. Until we wipe out racism,
none of us will be free.''
   NAACP convention delegate LeGrand Clegg, a lawyer for the city
of Compton, said Tuesday that black leaders should ``call a summit
meeting with the Hollywood Jewish community in the same spirit that
Jews have called for summits'' on statements by Nation of Islam
leader Louis Farrakhan.
   ``If Jewish leaders can complain of black anti-Semitism, our
leaders should certainly raise the issue of the century-old problem
of Jewish racism in Hollywood,'' said Clegg.
   Some suggested blacks should press for equal opportunity at the
box office.
   ``As long as blacks keep buying tickets, the industry should not
be let off the hook,'' said Sandra Evers-Manly, president of the
NAACP's Beverly Hills-Hollywood branch.

   First came the complimentary Bart Simpson
watches. Then smoke and colored lights.
   The buffet luncheon featured poached salmon. Dinner was on the
20th Century Fox lot and included 300 lobsters, steak, free booze,
a fortune teller, pool tables and pinball machines.
   This is the curious phenomenon known as the annual summer press
tour. Every year about this time, the major broadcast and cable
networks pull out all the stops and unabashedly wine and dine the
nation's TV critics.
   For two weeks, TV writers from around the country converge on
the Century Plaza hotel for a nonstop hype, food and drink fest.
Compliments of ABC, NBC, CBS, Home Box Office, Ted Turner, PBS,
ESPN ... name a television programmer and they're probably there.
   The purpose of this exercise is to give television writers from
say, Peoria, a chance to see network stars and business types up
close. Besides gorging the critics with food, booze and gifts, the
reporters also are stuffed with quotes, interviews, pilot
screenings, press releases, photographs and fall schedules.
   Fox Broadcasting Co. started this summer's tour on Tuesday. At 9
a.m., 200-plus critics, notebooks and Bart watches in hand, sat
down for eight hours of talk.
   First there was the smoke and swirling, colored lights. That was
followed by the announcement of Fox's long-awaited children's
network and its 5{ hours of kiddie programming _ thanks to a
recently acquired waiver from the Federal Communications
Commission. It allows Fox to increase its programming hours for one
year without complying with regulations that bar the big three
networks from lucrative domestic syndication markets.
   Fox Entertainment Group president Peter Chernin talked about the
network's heady success with ``The Simpsons'' and ``Married ...
With Children,'' both of which shot into Nielsen's top five list
this summer for the first time in Fox's young history.
   Said Fox President Jamie Kellner, ``We've had a year that can
only be described as breathtaking.''
   If we do say so ourselves.
   The wisdom of moving ``The Simpsons'' to Thursday nights this
fall was a much-discussed topic. Beginning in October, the
animated, smart-aleck Simpsons will go head-to-head with the
unanimated, genteel Huxtables of NBC's ``The Cosby Show.''
   ``Sooner or later the Cosby show is going to have to come
down,'' Chernin said. ``Clearly there's a risk involved, but taking
risks is what this network's about.''
   Indeed. Almost every speech by Chernin contains the word
``guerrilla,'' which he likes to use to describe Fox's approach to
taking on NBC, CBS and ABC.
   Fox also likes to use the word ``counterprogramming.''
   ``We're not interested in taking on the big guys in what they do
best,'' Chernin said.
   Despite Fox's unprecedented success, some of its
``counterprograms'' just didn't work, no matter how much publicity
they received.
   ``Alien Nation'' and ``21 Jump Street,'' for example. Both got
the ax for the fall.
   ``Alien Nation,'' a sci-fi serial about non-threatening space
aliens with funny looking heads, had a man giving birth last
season. ``We had viewers sampling it,'' Chernin said, ``but the
audience just wasn't there.''
   As for ``21 Jump Street,'' which made a heartthrob star out of
Johnny Depp, Chernin said the cast was getting too old to support
the program's plot line of high school undercover cops.
   Fox also spent much time promoting its new, expanded fall
schedule that jumps to five nights of prime-time programs (again,
thanks to the FCC waiver).
   A lot of the ballyhoo centered on ``Babes,'' a raucous depiction
of three overweight sisters that will follow ``The Simpsons'' on
Thursday nights at 8:30.
   Although Fox is pushing it as one of its most promising new
shows, the pilot is being reworked. Originally scheduled for a
later time period, some of the jokes are considered ``slightly
risque'' for 8:30 p.m., Chernin said.
   Some reporters wondered later whether this original script line
will remain: An office clerk, looking up to find the heavyweight
trio surrounding her desk, deadpans, ``What is this, Fantasia?''
   Being risque is what Fox does best. Or ``pushing the envelope,''
as they like to call it. Nothing risque about their press tour,
however.
   Although it's probably a safe bet that CBS' press tour, which
starts this weekend, won't have a fortune teller.
   __
   Elsewhere in Television ... At MTV's press tour on Wednesday,
the music network announced that its HA! comedy channel will launch
10 new, original shows this fall to complement its slate of
stand-up comics and comedy reruns such as ``Rhoda'' and ``The Best
of Groucho.'' Among the original programs is ``Comedians on
Comedy,'' with film director Paul Mazursky as host. He will
interview famous and not-so-famous funny people about what makes
people laugh.

<HEAD>Boys With `The Right Stuff' Will be Boisterous</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For nearly 30 years of space flight, NASA
looked the other way when its high-spirited astronauts tested the
rules of behavior that governed their lives.
   After all, boys with the right stuff will be boisterous.
   This week, the space agency departed from tradition and
suspended two veteran and highly regarded shuttle commanders for
stepping over the line. For Navy Cmdr. Robert L. Gibson and Navy
Capt. David M. Walker, both in their mid-40s, the suspensions might
be the end of their NASA careers.
   ``There was a violation of policy,'' Donald R. Puddy, the
astronauts' boss as director of flight operations, said in an
interview. ``I think it's clear across the board that we had
established a policy, written it down and communicated it to all
parties involved. I think they were all aware of what we were
trying to do.''
   Gibson's transgression was flying a stunt plane in a race at an
air show last Saturday in New Braunfels, Texas. His plane and
another collided, killing the second pilot.
   Walker was grounded for unspecified violation of flying rules.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration sought to make
clear that his near-collision with an airliner last year was only
one factor that led to the suspension.
   ``It was an incident that was considered, you might say it was
one of the more severe incidents,'' Puddy said. He declined to
elaborate, saying only that the space agency had become concerned
about ``some things in the manner which he was flying.''
   Walker, a Navy captain who had flown in space twice, was
replaced on a Defense Department mission set for March 1991 and
suspended for 60 days from flying NASA's T-38 jet trainers.
   At the same time, NASA announced a one-year suspension for
Gibson. Neither astronaut had any public comment.
   Puddy said he had ``no reason to believe that Dave (Walker) is
not going to stay with the program and no reason to believe he will
not eventually be put back on T-38 flying status.'' He said he had
not talked with Gibson.
   ``My personal feeling is that other members of the astronaut
corps understand that there was a violation of policy and they also
understand we had to take the action,'' said Puddy.
   Before the written guidelines, NASA tolerated some dangerous
outside activities.
   Gordon Cooper, one f the Mercury Seven astronauts, was fond of
fast cars and was about to make his professional driving debut when
NASA stopped him. Four-time space flyer James Lovell fractured his
arm and shoulder while skiing. Apollo 7 astronaut Walter Cunningham
fractured a vertebra on a trampoline.
   It is been just over a year since astronaut S. David Griggs was
killed while performing aerial stunts in his World War II-vintage
plane, practicing for a weekend air show.
   When it came to space flying, however, NASA had a no-nonsense
way of exerting discipline.
   Scott Carpenter, the fourth American in space, overshot his
landing mark by 250 miles and never got another flight. He started
a new career as an underwater researcher.
   The crew of Apollo 7 _ Wally Schirra, Donn Eisele and Walt
Cunningham _ were cranky with mission control throughout their
11-day flight. All three resigned soon afterward.
   Astronauts David Scott, Al Worden and Jim Irwin smuggled some
stamps aboard their Apollo 15, planning to sell them later. NASA
found out, reprimanded them and they left quickly.
   Puddy's order bars astronauts in training for flight from taking
part in ``risky recreational activities ... where there exists
exposure of major, or even fatal, injury.'' That includes: ``Auto,
boat, airplane or motorcycle racing; parachute jumping; and snow
skiing.''
   NASA's astronaut corps has 85 members, 62 of whom are in
training for 12 future shuttle flights.
   ``The rationale for our rules is to preserve the assigned
crews,'' said Puddy. ``We do not have enough people in the
astronaut office to provide backups for every single crew member
for all aspects of training.''
   Gibson, a three-flight veteran, was considered one of NASA's
star commanders.
   Walker has a reputation as a hellraiser. One space veteran said,
``He's in the old mode of the Mercury astronauts. He likes flying
fast and he likes to race people.''
   The National Transportation Safety Board has not completed its
investigation of the Walker incident, which occurred May 15, 1989,
as he was flying his T-38 to Dulles International Airport to take
part in a White House ceremony.
   Air Force Col. Fred Gregory, who has been assigned to take
Walker's place on the 1991 mission, said it's easy for astronauts
to stray from the rules.
   ``All of us are pilots and all of us are very aggressive
pilots,'' Gregory said. ``It's sometimes difficult for us to
separate our outside activities and our piloting skills and just
the thrill of flying. It's unfortunate in this particular case.''

   You're a legislator, facing tough decisions.
Bound to be controversial, sure to set barn fires no matter how you
decide.
   Then someone has a bright idea: let the people decide. Put the
issue on the ballot and put the question to the people. What could
be more democratic?
   Is that buck-passing?
   Or is it direct, participatory democracy?
   Yes it is and yes it is, said Patrick B. McGuigan, an Oklahoman
who has been keeping track of ballot propositions at the
conservative Free Congress Foundation for years.
   Yes, said McGuigan, when legislatures put issues on the ballot
``it becomes a way for legislators to avoid doing what we elect
them to do.''
   And, yes, said McGuigan, ``it is an expression of confidence in
ourselves.'' He said it makes citizens more involved in everyday
politics, more aware of the issues.
   ``Every meaningful criticism that can be made against the
initiative process has an exact corollary in every other aspect of
our democratic system,'' he said.
   In any event, ballot box lawmaking is a growing phenomena.
Twenty-six states and the District of Columbia allow referendums
(issues referred to the people by the legislatures) or initiatives
(issues on the ballot at the initiative of voters), but only about
a dozen states use these processes with much regularity.
   In 1988, voters decided on 229 statewide issues. They ranged
from repealing a gun control law in Maryland (no dice, said the
voters) to discouraging tobacco use by increasing cigarette taxes
25 cents in California (that passed despite a $15 million industry
campaign against it).
   This year, even more issues are likely to be voted upon,
including tax limitation issues, tax increases for specific
purposes and measures to limit the terms of legislators.
   You can argue for it: it is direct democracy.
   You can argue against it: Citizens are called to make decisions
without having heard the pros and cons. They don't have to consider
priorities (voting money for the homeless might take money from the
sick or the schools). They can be influenced by expensive
advertising campaigns mounted by special interests.
   Thomas Cronin, a Colorado College political scientist and author
of ``Direct Democracy: The Politics of the Initiative, Referendum
and Recall,'' is a middle-of-the-roader. Like McGuigan, he sees
both sides.
   If citizens don't know what they're voting on, legislators often
don't either, he said. They pass a lot of bills in a frantic final
burst; they spend about a third of each session amending or
otherwise repairing measures passed the previous session. And they
are influenced by political action committees, lobbyists and
special interests, too.
   On the other hand, Cronin's research found that 10 to 15 percent
of the voters who go to the polls (often only 50 percent of the
electorate) do not vote on ballot issues ``and another 10 percent
really don't know what they're voting on.''
   ``So the answer is that both of these processes ought to be of
concern,'' he said. ``Why do we have referendums? It's because our
system has become far less democratic in practice than in the
textbooks. In the ideal type of world, we would not have to resort
to initiative-referendum campaigns because we would have such
responsible, responsive legislatures they wouldn't be necessary.''
   Cronin finds that elected officeholders, scholars and
journalists tend to be opposed to direct democracy devices. They
think the issues are too complicated, that issues first should be
aired at hearings, that compromises _ the essence of democracy _
can't be molded by a citizen facing a yes-or-no choice.
   The argument comes down, Cronin said, to philosophy. It is a
case of the populists, who think the people always know best, vs.
``parentalists,'' who think papa knows best.
   He notes that voters sometimes use the ballot to strike back at
big government: Massachusetts voters vetoed both a mandatory seat
belt law and a salary increase for state legislators one year.
   McGuigan and Cronin share a concern about what happens when too
many issues crowd themselves onto the ballot. In 1988, so many
questions were on the California ballot that express lines were
created for voters who promised to spend only five minutes marking
their ballot.
   Cronin said the growth in ballot issues is a result, too, of the
way incumbents have become almost undefeatable.
   ``Regular elections in America are increasingly meaningless,''
he said. ``Ninety-five percent of incumbents at the state and
national level get reelected routinely. In Colorado, only once in
the 1980s did a state senator get defeated. That's not untypical.''
   ``If we have no turnover, no real competition, then the people
with a grievance have two choices _ form a PAC if they have lots of
money, or get their issue on the ballot if they don't.''

<DATELINE>GUBEN, East Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Only the swans that beg for bread on
the banks of the Neisse River seem oblivious to the fact that
Guben, like Berlin, is a city divided by war.
   For more than 700 years, Guben, East Germany, and Gubin, Poland,
were the same city. But aside from a bridge that spans the Neisse,
lttle else links these towns.
   Like Germany and its old capital, Guben was carved in half by
World War II. Few people, however, are calling for the
reunification of Guben.
   ``We won't see a united Guben,'' said Juergen Kunze, vice mayor
of the East German city. ``I hardly see any contacts on a
voluntary, individual basis.''
   Both cities today are drab, gray relics of the former Communist
regimes that ruled Poland and East Germany until democratic
revolutions spread through the East bloc last year.
   Each city stands now less as a symbol of the past than as a
reflection of the different paths East Germany and Poland are
pursuing.
   Both nations are experiencing high prices, labor unrest and
joblessness as the cost of dismantling their socialist systems and
moving to the free market.
   But East Germany is being aided by West Germany, and its chances
for achieving prosperity are expected to be far better than
Poland's.
   East Germany merged its economy with West Germany's on July 1
and the powerful West German mark became the currency of the former
Communist country.
   Now, better food and and higher quality household goods fill the
stores on the East German side.
   Ruth Hulke, 55, was born on the eastern side of the river and
was moved to the west after the war.
   Before East Germany's borders were opened last fall, she said it
was easier for Poles than East Germans to travel to West Germany.
Poles would buy coveted goods in the West, then resell them to East
Germans.
   Until recently, she said, she used to travel to the Polish side
to buy products that were not available in East Germany.
   ``Now we don't need to go there any more,'' she said.
   Marek Dutkiwicz, 25, a television repairman from the Polish
side, said goods are cheaper now in East Germany than in Poland.
   About 34,000 people live in Guben and 17,500 Poles live in the
city across the river. About 1,500 Poles work in the German town,
but few Germans work on the other side of the river.
   The original Guben was chartered in the 13th century and has
been part of Prussia, Saxony and Germany.
   After Germany's defeat in World War II, the Allies extended the
Polish border into German lands to make up for Polish territory
ceded to the Soviet Union. The border of the newly created East
Germany was drawn at the Oder and Neisse rivers.
   Guben, which straddled the Neisse, was cut in two.
   What was the central part of Guben became part of Poland and was
renamed Gubin. The smaller western section of town was left for
East Germany.
   Most of the pre-war buildings were destroyed during the war, so
there are few landmarks from the days when Guben was a single
German city.
   Many of the former residents fled to what is now West Germany to
escape the approaching Soviet army. Poles from the lands seized by
the Soviets were resettled in Gubin, so there are few residents who
remember the pre-war days.
   Barbara Remus, an editor at the Guben newspaper, the Lausitzer
Rundschau, said there has been friction between citizens of the two
cities.
   Before East Germany merged its economy with West Germany's,
Poles would buy up state-subsidized, inexpensive goods in the East
German town and sell them in West Germany at a profit.
   But when the Polish border was opened in February, she said many
Germans from Guben streamed to the Polish side to buy goods.
   Many Poles fear that a united Germany will seek to reclaim its
former lands, which comprise about one-third of present-day Poland.
   But Miss Remus said there are no such stirrings in the German
side of Guben.
   ``It used to all be one Guben, but it's accepted that Gubin is
Polish,'' she said. ``Nobody says they want it back.''

<HEAD>Private Bank Owner Fails to Return from Vacation Abroad</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of customers of a private
savings bank in Warsaw have something to worry about _ the bank's
owner has apparently disappeared.
   Lech Grobelny, the founder of the BKO savings bank and owner of
a chain of currency exchanges, has not returned from a holiday
abroad, the pro-Solidarity newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza reported
Wednesday.
   BKO, which in Polish stands for Safe Savings Bank, was founded
at the end of last year and offered interest rates of up to 180
percent, much higher than rates at the state-operated banks.
   Last year, Poland's inflation rate was 244 percent, but it has
dropped sharply this year as the Solidarity-led government's
economic shock therapy program took effect.
   As it moves toward a market-based economy, the new government
has deregulated the banking industry, allowing private banks to be
formed and compete with state-owned banks.
   But regulatory safeguards are apparently not yet in place.
   According to the report, Grobelny left Poland on June 6 for a
two-week holiday in an undisclosed location. Employees told the
newspaper they last heard from him in late June when he informed
them he would return home July 6.
   Rumors of the BKO owner's disappearance have been circulating
for several weeks in Warsaw and the bank's cash reserves have
shrunk due to increased withdrawals.
   About 10,000 customers have accounts with BKO with deposits
worth some 32 billion zlotys, or $3.3 million dollars, according to
the daily.
   BKO did not meet standards set by the National Bank of Poland
for private banks, and the government had several times warned the
public that their deposits with it might not be safe.
   On Monday, employees informed the prosecutor's office about
Grobelny's absence, explaining that no substitute had been
appointed before his departure to take care of the company.
   Warsaw Provincial Prosecutor Jacek Kryszczuk, interviewed by the
PAP news agency, said he saw no grounds for legal action until an
official complaint by a customer is filed.
   The BKO office was closed on Wednesday and a group of customers
who wanted to take their savings back could only read a note on the
door saying that they can ``vindicate their claims at a district
court,'' PAP said.

<TEXT>
   Here are excerpts from the final communique
issued by the leaders of the seven industrial nations at the
conclusion of their 16th economic summit:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Gorbachev and the Soviet Union:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _We discussed the situation in the Soviet Union, and exchanged
views regarding the message that Soviet President Gorbachev sent us
several days ago on his economic plans. We welcome the efforts
underway in the Soviet Union to liberalize and to create a more
open, democratic, and pluralistic Soviet society, and to move
toward a market-oriented economy. These measures deserve our
support. The success of perestroika depends upon the determined
pursuit and development of these reform efforts. In particular, we
welcome President Gorbachev's suggestion for a sustained economic
dialogue.
   We have all begun, individually and collectively, to assist
these reform efforts. We all believe that technical assistance
should be provided now to help the Soviet Union move to a
market-oriented economy and to mobilize its own resources. Some
countries are already in a position to extend large scale financial
credits. We also agreed that further Soviet decisions to introduce
more radical steps toward a market-oriented economy, to shift
resources substantially away from the military sector and to cut
support to nations promoting regional conflict will all improve the
prospect for meaningful and sustained economic assistance.
   We have agreed to ... undertake, in close consultation with the
Commission of the European Communities, a detailed study of the
Soviet economy, to make recommendations for its reform and to
establish the criteria under which Western economic assistance
could effectively support these reforms. This work should be
completed by year's end and be convened by the IMF (International
Monetary Fund).
</TEXT>
<HEAD>The Sweep of Democracy:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _We ... celebrate the renaissance of democracy throughout much
of the world. We welcome unreservedly the spread of multiparty
democracy, the practice of free elections, the freedom of
expression and assembly, the increased respect for human rights,
the rule of law, and the increasing recognition of the principles
of the open and competitive economy. These events proclaim loudly
man's inalienable rights: When people are free to choose, they
choose freedom.
   _The profound changes taking place in Europe, and progress
toward democracy elsewhere, give us great hope for a world in which
individuals have increasing opportunities to achieve their economic
and political aspirations, free of tyranny and oppression.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>The Restructuring of Europe:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _We welcome the political and economic reforms taking place in
Central and Eastern Europe. At the recent Conference on Security
and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE) in Bonn and by the agreement to
establish the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development
(EBRD), the participating countries of the region accepted the key
principles underpinning market economies. However, the degree of
implementation of economic and political reform varies widely by
country. Several countries have taken courageous and difficult
measures to stabilize their economies and shorten the transition to
a market economy. We and other countries should assist Central and
Eastern European nations that are firmly committed to economic and
political reform.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>German Reunification</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _We welcome the prospect of a unified, democratic Germany which
enjoys full sovereignty without discriminatory constraints. German
economic, monetary and social union will contribute to improved
non-inflationary global growth and to a reduction of external
imbalances. This process will promote positive economic
developments in Central and Eastern Europe.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Farm subsidies and Trade Issues:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _We confirm our strong support for the essential broad
objectives of the negotiations; reform of agricultural policies; a
substantial and balanced package of measures to improve market
access; strengthened multilateral rules and disciplines; the
incorporation of new issues of services, trade-related investment
measures, and intellectual property protection within the GATT
(General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade) framework.
   _As regards agriculture, achieving the long-term objective of
the reform of agricultural policies is critical to permit the
greater liberalization of trade in agricultural products. ...
   We therefore reaffirm our commitment to the long-term objective
of the reform, i.e., to allow market signals to influence
agriculture production and to establish a fair and market-oriented
agricultural trading system. ...
   The achievement of this objective requires each of us to make
substantial, progressive reductions in support and protection of
agriculture _ covering internal regimes, market access, and export
subsidies ...
</TEXT>
<HEAD>The Environment:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _One of our most important responsibilities is to pass on to
future generations an environment whose health, beauty, and
economic potential are not threatened. Environmental challenges
such as climate change, ozone depletion, deforestation, marine
pollution and loss of biological diversity require closer and more
effective international cooperation and concrete action. We as
industrialized countries have an obligation to be leaders in
meeting these challenges. We agree that, in the face of threats of
irreversible environmental damage, lack of full scientific
certainty is no excuse to postpone actions which are justified in
their own right. We recognize that strong, growing, market-oriented
economies provide the best means for successful environmental
protection.
   Climate change is of key importance. We are committed to
undertake common efforts to limit emissions of greenhouse gases,
such as carbon dioxide. We strongly support the work of the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and look forward
to the release of its full report in August.
   ... We reiterate our support for the negotiation of a framework
convention on climate change, under the auspices of the United
Nations Environment Program (UNEP) and the World Meteorological
Organization (WMO). The convention should be completed by 1992.
   We welcome the amendment of the Montreal Protocol to phase out
the use of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) by the year 2000 and to
extend coverage of the Protocol to other ozone depleting substances.
   To cope with energy-related environmental damage, priority must
be given to improvements in energy efficiency and to the
development of alternative energy sources. For the countries that
make such a choice, nuclear energy will continue to be an important
contributor to our energy supply and can play a significant role in
reducing the growth of greenhouse gas emissions. Countries should
continue efforts to ensure highest worldwide performance standards
for nuclear and other energy in order to protect health and the
environment, and ensure the highest safety.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>The Drug War:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _We urge all nations to accede to and complete ratification of
the U.N. Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and
Psychotropic Substances (the Vienna Convention), and to apply
provisionally terms of the Convention. We welcome the conclusion of
the U.N. Special Session on Drugs and urge the implementation of
the measures contained in the Program of Action it has adopted. We
support the declaration adopted at the ministerial meeting on drugs
convened by the United Kingdom that drug demand reduction should be
accorded the same importance in policy and action as the reduction
of illicit supply. Developed countries should adopt stronger
prevention efforts and assist demand reduction initiatives in other
countries.

   Here is a text of President Bush's remarks at the
conclusion of the economic summit:
   Well, I would say to my distinguished colleagues that we've had
a chance to review the declaration that was agreed this morning by
the eight of us, and I first want to thank all of you for the
spirit of full cooperation that I think we all agree existed here
in this summit.
   The eight of us, representing the people of France, the United
Kingdom, the Federal Republic of Germany, Canada, Italy, Japan, the
United States and the European Community, all met. And our
declaration reflects decisions taken during the past three days
here in Houston, to extend our long economic expansion, strengthen
the world trading system, reiterate our support for the strength
and debt strategy, ensure open investment, assist reform in Central
and Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, safeguard the environment,
help developing nations and reduce the scourge of drugs.
   And on behalf of my colleagues, I'd like to note several points
of particular importance to us, summarizing _ not reading in its
entirety _ but summarizing some key points out of this declaration.
   We are enormously heartened by the resurgence of democracy
throughout much of the world. And we welcome the spread of
multi-party democracy, the practice of free elections, the freedom
of expression and assembly, the growing respect for human rights
and the rule of law, and the increasing recognition of the strength
of open and competitive economies. These events proclaim loudly
man's inalienable rights. When people are free to choose, they
choose freedom.
   We, the G-7, are now in the eighth year of an economic expansion
which has created millions of jobs, accelerated the growth of world
trade, and provided tangible support for developing countries.
   The process of economic policy coordination, which we have
developed over the years, has contributed importantly to this
economic performance. However, we cannot rest on current
accomplishments. Each of us will continue efforts, individually and
together, to maintain and improve conditions for growth.
   Economic prosperity depends critically on an open world trading
system. And we will devote close personal attention in the months
ahead to achieving a successful outcome of the Uruguay round of
multilateral trade negotiations.
   We have given our trade negotiators clear instructions on our
commitment to conclude a comprehensive agreement which expands
trade worldwide while bringing the greatest number of participants
into a strengthened General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the
GATT. Each of us recognizes that reaching this goal will require
difficult steps by all participants. We will not hesitate to take
them. This is especially true for agriculture, where we are
committed, by this declaration, to provide the strong political
leadership necessary to ensure a successful and enduring result.
   We agreed on the significance of the steps under way in the
Soviet Union to liberalize and democratize its society, and to move
toward a market economy. We welcome President Gorbachev's message
to us, in particular his desire for a sustained economic dialogue
with the West. We want to support the reforms under way in the
Soviet Union, and all agree that technical assistance can help the
Soviets move toward a market-oriented economy. Some of us are
already prepared to extend large-scale credits to the Soviet Union.
   We all agree, however, all of us, that the Soviet Union could
greatly improve the prospects for sustained Western assistance if
it introduced further market reforms, cut its military spending and
ceased supporting governments which promote regional conflicts.
   We also took note of the importance to the government of Japan
of peaceful resolution of its dispute with the Soviet Union over
the Northern Territories. We see the need for a considered,
comprehensive Western response in support of Soviet reform efforts,
and we have asked the major international economic institutions to
provide us by year's end their recommendations for reform of the
Soviet economy and possible criteria for Western assistance.
   We are keenly aware of our responsibilities to pass on to the
future generations a world environment whose health, beauty and
economic potential are safeguarded. Environmental challenges such
as climate change, ozone depletion, deforestation, marine
pollution, and the loss of biological diversity require closer and
more effective international cooperation and action.
   We are united on the goals and measures to be taken now,
particularly in relation to climate change and the protection of
forests. And in this regard, we have agreed to complete by 1992 the
work of the IPCC on a framework convention on climate change; to
begin work immediately on developing a pilot project to address
tropical deforestation in Brazil; commence negotiations _ this is
the third point _ to commence negotiations on a global forest
convention or agreement to curb deforestation, promote
bio-diversity and encourage sound forestry practices and
reforestation.
   We recognize the difficult economic challenges facing many
developing countries, including reduced growth and severe debt
burdens. And we have been in the forefront of addressing these
problems and encouraged _ we are encouraged by the progress that
has been made under the international debt strategy over the past
year.
   We have agreed to review options for helping those countries
that are heavily indebted to our governments. Economic and
political reform are essential for economic prosperity and
political stability. For those countries undertaking these
difficult steps, we offer our experience, resources and good will.
   We leave Houston renewed by the strength of our common
commitments to healthy economic growth and prosperity and freedom
for peoples everywhere.
   And in conclusion, we have accepted Prime Minister Thatcher's
kind invitation to meet again next July in London.
   Again, my thanks to my colleagues.
   I think the plan is that we now go and have our own opportunity
to respond to questions from the press. But I want to thank my
colleagues for what I, at least, feel have been, has been a good
summit. And we're very pleased you were here. And I might I just
take one more opportunity to thank the people of Houston for their
hospitality. Thank you all very much.

   President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro
announced late Wednesday that she would negotiate with militant
pro-Sandinista leaders of a general strike that has threatened to
topple her 10-week-old government.
   At the same news conference, Gen. Humberto Ortega, head of the
army and a member of the leftist Sandinista's nine-man directorate
until March, said the army would quiet the capital within hours.
   ``I feel very sure I will serve out my term,'' said Mrs.
Chamorro, expressing confidence her government has survived its
most serious challenge since defeating the Sandinistas at the polls
in February.
   A wave of strikes began July 2 and turned violent when
protesters opposing the strikes took to the streets on Friday. Tens
of thousands of government workers have closed down public
services. Strike leaders say 90,000 workers have walked out since
the strike began.
   The unions that called the strikes, the army and police are all
loyal to the Sandinistas, who ruled the country for nine years and
are now the main opposition to Mrs. Chamorro's U.S.-backed
administration.
   Mrs. Chamorro's confidence she will serve until 1995 stemmed
from the promise of the Sandinista People's Army to obey her
command to restore order.
   Ortega said the army would never back a coup. At the same time,
he made it clear the military would stop short of all-out force
against the strikers.
   The armed forces, he said ``will never carry out a coup against
any government here, much less the government of Dona Violeta. But
neither will the army and police fire on the people.''
   At the news conference, which was attended by the U.S. and
Soviet ambassadors and other members of the diplomatic corps, Mrs.
Chamorro reversed her earlier insistence that the strike must end
before talks could begin.
   She said she was willing to negotiate once the streets were
cleared of barricades, basic public services were restored and
strikers cleared from government installations.
   Ortega claimed the army would have Managua back to near-normal
Thursday.
   He said four people had been killed and 15 to 20 wounded in
confrontations between Sandinista strikers and government
supporters. The Nicaraguan Human Rights Commission earlier
estimated 84 injured.
   Police and army loyalty have been a key issue since Mrs.
Chamorro defeated Ortega's brother, Daniel Ortega, in the Feb. 25
elections.
   Earlier Wednesday, an explosion knocked a pro-government radio
station off the air and its director blamed the Sandinistas.
   Presidential spokesman Danilo Lacayo said Mrs. Chamorro ``called
for public condemnation'' of the bombing. He said the president had
ordered a police investigation.
   Radio Corp.'s transmitter and antenna were blown up after
leftist Sandinista organizers told strikers to ease their grip on
Managua and demanded Mrs. Chamorro, who took office April 25, open
negotiations immediately.
   The station had been converted into a stronghold for armed
opponents of the strikes. The protesters abandoned their takeover
at the station at Tuesday midnight, saying they reached an
agreement with police.
   Daniel Ortega had charged the station was calling on the
government to request U.S. military intervention to end the strikes.
   No one claimed responsibility for the explosion, but radio
station director Castillo Osejo said in an interview he blamed
``the Sandinistas, because nobody else would be interested in doing
such a thing.''
   The strikers are demanding more participation in economic
planning and dispute proposals to cut back civil service workers
hired by the Sandinistas. The civil servants won 100 percent pay
raises in a May strike.
   Mrs. Chamorro's coalition _ the 14-party United National
Opposition _ offered the layoffs as part of a plan to restart the
Nicaraguan economy, which was ruined during the 9-year civil war
with the U.S.-backed Contra rebels and a trade embargo imposed
during the Reagan administration.
   Meanwhile, air traffic controllers went back to work Wednesday
and said the airport was open, although no flights were arriving or
departing.
   A few barricades came down in the capital and gunfire ended in
the morning. But strikers still occupied most government ministries
and some state-run industries.
   The government has declared the strikes illegal. It suspended
talks over the weekend.
   A statement issued by the Sandinista-run National Workers'
Front, which controls most of the striking unions, urged strikers
``to create conditions favoring the start of talks, allowing the
circulation of people and transport in areas where the Sandinista
police demand it.''
   The statement, read on pro-Sandinista Radio Ya, proposed that
negotiations begin Wednesday afternoon.
   The day before, Mrs. Chamorro issued a statement that Central
American presidents asked that violence end ``to create a climate
of calm to permit a negotiated solution.''
   The developments Wednesday did not seem to make a major
difference in daily life in Managua, although a few more people
were in the streets.
   Witnesses said soldiers helped build barricades despite orders
that they restore peace in the capital.
   Managua continued without public transportation. Most grocery
stores remained closed. Barricades and trenches dug across streets
stopped most traffic.
   Bomb blasts and gunfire were heard overnight but no reports of
casualties surfaced.
   State Radio Nicaragua claimed Wednesday that ``a minority of
some 3,000 armed Sandinistas control the city and are keeping more
than 1 million people hostage.''

   ``Chow,'' President Bush said at the end of the
economic summit of seven industrial nations, but he didn't mean
good-bye in Italian.
   After presenting the meeting's final communique, the president
strolled into the giant food hall of Houston's convention center
and greeted chefs, waiters and some of the reporters who were
eating lunch.
   Walking into the hall, Bush turned to his wife, Barbara, and
said, ``I heard they had all this fabulous food.'' He told a waiter
he came ``to see the chow.''
   The president didn't sit down for lunch, but he shook hands,
waved and joked with the crowd.
   Deivra Liberato of the Texas A&amp;M University newspaper Battalion
extended a piece of paper to Bush, hoping for his autograph. He
said, ``If I start this, I'll get in trouble,'' but grabbed it and
signed, ``G Bush.''

   French President Francois Mitterrand, an aloof figure, was asked
by reporters why he skipped the rodeo and country music bash hosted
by Bush on Sunday night. After all, he was the only leader without
an excuse.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl missed the festivities because his
country was in the finals of the World Cup soccer championships and
won, 1-0. Italian Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti, as host of the
tournament, had to be on hand to present the trophy.
   But why Mitterrand?
   ``Because I decided on three days in Houston and not four. That
is the explanation. It is as simple as that. The rodeo was a nice
occasion, but it wasn't part of the actual summit,'' he said.

   When Bush officially brought the summit to a close, Carla McGill
and her quick-change artists went to work.
   In 20 minutes flat, they transformed a stage set with a massive
gray dais and leather easy chairs into a familiar setting for a
presidential news conference.
   The red-white-and-blue summit insignia and the flags of the
seven nations stayed fixed to the blue curtains as a backdrop, but
the bulky furniture was hustled away and a presidential podium
installed.
   Military aides set to work with power tools, bolting together
sheets of armor plating that extended out from either side of the
podium. Blue bunting concealed the protective shield.
   Overseeing the quick change was Ms. McGill, who works for
Hargrove Inc., a Washington firm that specializes in putting on
conventions and other events. Hargrove designed the summit setting.
   The makeover was complete with 10 minutes to spare before Bush
returned to the hall for his post-summit news conference.
   Ms. McGill said practice made perfect. ``We went through this a
million times with the Secret Service,'' she said.

<HEAD>Government Energy Conservation Has Nearly Disappeared, Hearing
Told</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When it comes to gobbling up energy, there is
no equal to Uncle Sam.
   Witnesses told two House subcommittees Wednesday that since 1985
programs by some federal agencies to conserve energy have virtually
disappeared _ especially at the Defense Department which accounts
for 80 percent of the government's energy requirements.
   According to Energy Department estimates, the federal government
spent $3.5 billion last year to heat, light and cool more than
500,000 buildings, while spending only $44.5 million to make
buildings more energy-efficient. The government's total energy bill
came to more than $8 billion, including fuels for the military.
   After dramatic gains in energy efficiency in the late 1970s and
early '80s, energy use has once again been on the increase at
federal facilities, according to the government figures cited at
the congressional hearing. Federal agencies used about 1 percent
more energy per square foot of building space last year than five
years ago. Between 1975 and 1985 the government cut energy use by
17 percent.
   Two years ago energy conservation efforts by the government
``slowed to a crawl'' and continue to lag despite a law that
requires the government to cut energy costs by 10 percent by 1995,
said Rep. Philip Sharp, D-Ind., chairman of the House energy and
power subcommittee.
   ``Comparatively few federal installations have participated in
energy saving programs, even where such programs were substantially
financed by someone else,'' said Rep. Mike Synar, D-Okla., who is
chairman of the Government Operations subcommittee on environment,
energy and natural resources.
   In recent years, energy conservation has taken on renewed
interest because of environmental concern over emissions from the
burning of fossil fuels. Environmentalists have argued that the
nation must dramatically reduce its energy use if it is to deal
with global warming and other environmental problems.
   Government figures show that the Defense Department, which spent
more than $1 billion on energy conservation during 1975-85,
allocated only $1.5 million last year to make buildings more
energy-efficient.
   Jeffrey Jones, director of energy policy at the Defense
Department, said the Pentagon plans soon to establish new programs
aimed at improving energy efficiency. He expressed confidence the
10 percent energy reduction goal by 1995 can be met.
   ``The federal government has a large stake in energy
conservation. Yet the U.S. government lags far behind the private
sector in purchasing and installing energy conservation systems,''
Douglas Decker, manager of government markets for Johnson Controls
Inc., told the hearing.
   Johnson Controls Inc., of Milwaukee, Wis., is a major
manufacturer of energy management systems for commercial buildings.
Decker cited government figures that showed that while some federal
agencies have reduced energy consumption per square foot, others
have increased their demand significantly.
   Among the agencies that have cut energy use substantially since
1985 were the Commerce Department (23 percent), Justice Department
(21 percent), Environmental Protection Agency (19 percent) and
Transportation Department (14 percent).
   But energy use at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
jumped nearly 18 percent, while it rose by 11 percent at the
General Services Administration and nearly 29 percent at the Office
of Personnel Management. At the Defense Department, by far the
government's largest user, energy use per square foot increased 1.4
percent during the four years.
   Meanwhile, a report by the General Accounting Office, the
investigative arm of Congress, cited a variety of problems in
cutting government use of energy, including budgetary concerns.
   With serious deficit problems, budget planners are reluctant to
allocate money for energy efficiency improvements, although the
payback may be only a few years, said GAO investigator Nye Stevens.
   ``But the (energy) savings are not possible without spending
that additional money up front,'' he added.
   The GAO also said the government lacks central direction and
responsibility for energy conservation and that federal procurement
practices inhibit the use of various energy conservation programs
used by industry.

<TEXT>
   Two journalists stole a drawing by
Jean-Auguste Ingres from a museum in southern France in broad
daylight to test security a week after three thefts from museums in
Paris, the reporters' newspaper says.
   The Midi Libre, a regional daily, said Wednesday that reporter
Odile Cimitiere and photographer Pierre Carriere used a screwdriver
to remove the small tableau from a wall in the Fabre Museum.
   The pair hid the sketch in a plastic bag under one's clothing
and spirited it out the museum's entrance unchallenged Tuesday
morning before returning it to museum authorities, the paper said.
   On July 4, a painting by Renoir valued at a few hundred thousand
dollars, was cut from its frame at the Louvre in Paris. The same
day, thieves made off with an 1816 landscape by Paul Huet from the
Carnavalet Museum and an 1870 portrait by Ernest Hebert from a
third Paris museum.
   That same day, officials at the Louvre discovered that several
pieces of ancient Roman jewelry had disappeared from their display.
   French authorities have not said if they have determined the
thefts were linked. None of the artworks has been recovered.
   The Fabre Museum is guarded by 21 security personnel, the Midi
Libre said. The room from which the Ingres sketch was taken has two
guards and is equipped with an alarm system which is turned on only
at night, the paper said.
   Officials said a comprehensive security system is scheduled to
be installed in a few months.
   At least a dozen artworks have been stolen from French museums
over the past year. Several thefts have occurred in the past three
years at the Fabre and other museums in the city.

   Marvin Liebman, a father of the modern
conservative movement, is helping smash gay stereotypes by publicly
declaring his homosexuality, according to gay political leaders.
   ``I think it's important not only to have a founder of the
modern conservative movement speak out against bigotry, it's
important for American society as a whole for someone with a
distinguished career to say, `I am a gay American and I am not
ashamed,''' said Gregory King, communications director for the
Human Rights Campaign Fund, a gay political lobby.
   Urvashi Vaid, executive director of the National Gay &amp; Lesbian
Task Force, another lobbying group, said Liebman's statement is a
welcome one.
   ``For years we've said there's an enormous diversity in the gay
and lesbian movement,'' Vaid said Wednesday. ``There are gay
progressives and gay conservatives.''
   Liebman revealed his homosexuality this month in the pages of
William F. Buckley's conservative National Review and The Advocate,
a Los Angeles-based gay magazine.
   In an interview Wednesday, Liebman, 66, said he decided to
announce he's gay because he sees signs that the political right is
becoming dangerously bigoted.
   ``The primary impact I wanted to have in this whole coming out
was on the conservative community. Just to sort of alert them to
the dangers of homophobia and all that comes with it,'' he said.
   But Roger Stone, a conservative political consultant, said he
did not think Liebman's statement would affect the conservative
movement.
   ``I think it will be viewed as the actions of an individual,''
Stone said, adding that he did not believe bigotry was growing
among conservatives.
   Liebman first made his revelation in a letter to Buckley, whom
he describes as his best friend.
   ``I am both gay and conservative and I don't find that a
contradiction,'' Liebman wrote in the July 9 issue of the National
Review.
   Explaining why he chose to go public now, Liebman continued, ``I
fear that our cause might sink back into the ooze in which so much
of it rested in (pre-National Review) days. In that dark age the
American Right was heavily, perhaps dominantly, made up of bigots.''
   Buckley _ who once suggested that gay people with AIDS be
tattooed on the buttocks and called Gore Vidal a ``queer'' on
national television _ responded by asking if it's reasonable ``to
expect the larger community to cease to think of the activity of
homosexuals as unnatural, whatever its etiology?''
   However, Buckley also wrote that he understood Liebman's
``pain,'' and promised the National Review ``will not be scarred by
thoughtless gay-bashing.''
   Liebman said Wednesday he feels no rancor toward Buckley even
though they disagree on whether homosexuality is moral or normal.
   ``There is nothing that Bill Buckley could say that would offend
me or make me feel bad,'' Liebman said. ``This is just the way the
man thinks.''
   Born in Brooklyn, N.Y., Liebman was a Jew until age 55, when he
converted to Roman Catholicism. Buckley was his godfather.
   At 15, Liebman had joined the Young Communist League and for
years was active in other communist front groups. He served two
years in the Army Air Corps but was discharged in 1944 for being
homosexual _ a fact he kept secret until this month.
   After the war, Liebman joined Irgun, an underground Zionist
organization, and worked as an organizer and fund-raiser. Until the
early 1950s, Liebman worked for a variety of left-leaning groups.
   But his politics shifted, and he teamed with Buckley and others
to pioneer the modern conservative movement. He founded the Young
Americans for Freedom and was active in the Conservative Party of
New York and the presidential campaigns of Barry Goldwater and
Ronald Reagan.
   Liebman came to Washington after Reagan was elected in 1980,
working first as a consultant to the federal government. From 1982
to 1987, he was director of public affairs and special projects at
the National Endowment for the Arts. He is now director of special
projects at the Federal Trade Commission.

<HEAD>Administration Counters Democratic Aid Proposal for El Salvador</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration is offering Congress a
compromise proposal on military aid to El Salvador that could
result in a reduction of between 15 percent and 30 percent of the
$85 million being requested for next year.
   As a sweetener for Democrats, the proposal would terminate
military assistance altogether if the Salvadoran government refuses
to negotiate in good faith for a cease-fire and a permanent
settlement to its 10-year-old war with leftist rebels of the
Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, or FMLN.
   The administration's recommendations were outlined in a document
made available to The Associated Press.
   The proposal is designed to give both the Salvadoran government
and the rebels the incentive to reach a settlement.
   It also is aimed at heading off congressional approval of a
Democratic proposal that calls for a 50 percent cut in military
aid, which would be reinstated only if the FMLN launches a major
offensive or fails to meet other conditions. Administration
officials said that proposal, approved last May in a test vote,
leaves the FMLN little incentive to move toward peace.
   Assistant Secretary of State Bernard Aronson planned to hold
talks on Capitol Hill today on the administration's
recommendations. He was in El Salvador earlier this week,
exchanging views on the issue with military and government leaders.
   According to the document, the administration is willing to
withhold 15 percent of military assistance funds until April 1,
1991 _ six months after the start of the 1991 fiscal year.
   The withheld money would be made available to the Salvadoran
government only if several conditions are met, including
``significant progress'' toward bringing to trial those responsible
for the murder of eight people, including six Jesuit priests, in
San Salvador last November.
   In his talks in El Salvador, Aronson pressed authorities to
ensure that the guilty are brought to justice. A report by a House
Democratic task force in April said the investigation had come to a
virtual standstill and that the Salvadoran government had showed no
interest in determining whether senior military officers were
responsible.
   According to the administration's aid proposal, an additional 15
percent would be withheld provided the FMLN meets certain
conditions. These include complying with a cease-fire agreement,
showing a willingness to negotiate in good faith and refraining
from acts of terrorism or military actions that threaten the
government.
   The United States has provided more than $5 billion in military
and economic aid to El Salvador over the past decade. Officials
have said repeatedly in recent months that conditions have never
been better for an end to the conflict.
   One reason is the belief that the rebels will be more flexible
in negotiations because of declining international support for
their cause.
   The electoral defeat of the leftist Sandinista government in
Nicaragua last February left the FMLN more isolated internationally
than at any time in a decade. Despite that setback, Sandinista
remnants outside government control are continuing to send supplies
to the Salvadoran insurgents, the officials said.
   The government and the guerrillas have had several rounds of
discussions this year. The next meeting is set for July 20 in Costa
Rica.

<HEAD>Mitchell Bars Capital Gains Tax Cut Without Hitting Rich</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell is
serving notice that if President Bush wants his cherished cut in
capital gains taxes, he'll also have to swallow higher income taxes
on wealthy Americans.
   Mitchell, D-Maine, said Wednesday that a refusal by Bush to
accept a boost in the income tax rates paid by the richest
wage-earners would kill any budget deal that involves slashed
capital gains levies.
   ``There are certain points beyond which you can't go,'' Mitchell
said.
   The majority leader's comments to reporters came as
congressional leaders and White House officials continued talks on
how to slice next year's budget deficit, which is expected to
surpass $160 billion.
   The bargainers discussed ways to save at least $10 billion by
cutting benefit programs such as Medicare but reached no
agreements. The two sides planned to hold separate strategy
sessions today and to resume negotiations Friday.
   Many congressional Republicans have insisted that the president
will never accept an increase in income tax rates for the richest
Americans, despite his recent easing of the anti-tax stance he took
during his 1988 election campaign.
   But Mitchell said swapping one for the other was a matter of
equity.
   ``In the past decade, the federal tax system has become
increasingly regressive,'' he said. ``The middle class in our
society ... those are the people who are paying increasingly, who
are shouldering the burden of taxation in our society.
   ``I don't see how anyone in good conscience can further that
trend,'' he said.
   Under current law, income tax rates rise to 33 percent in the
upper-middle income bracket and then drop back to 28 percent for
the additional earnings of the most wealthy Americans. Capital
gains income _ earnings derived from the sale of assets such as
stocks and real estate _ is taxed at those same rates.
   Bush has been pushing to cut the capital gains rate to 15
percent, arguing it would spur investment and economic growth.
Mitchell and other Democrats oppose the change because the wealthy
would benefit disproportionately.
   A frequently discussed compromise is to simultaneously cut the
capital gains rate and eliminate the drop in the income tax rate
for the richest taxpayers. Mitchell's comments Wednesday reflected
his willingness to consider such a tradeoff.
   Mitchell said that at a minimum the top marginal tax rate should
be raised to 33 percent, and he personally favored 35 percent.
Anything less than 33 percent would be ``completely unacceptable,''
he said.

   Divisions among Democrats on the level of
defense spending widened as the Senate Budget Committee chairman
questioned why deep cuts can only be achieved by drastic reductions
in military personnel.
   ``I must disagree with your view that the defense spending level
in the Senate budget resolution cannot be reached without
unacceptable `disruption' to America's military establishment,''
Sen. James Sasser, D-Tenn., said Wednesday in a letter to Sen. Sam
Nunn, chairman of the Armed Services Committee.
   As his panel crafts a defense bill for the fiscal year beginning
Oct. 1, Nunn, D-Ga., has sought to illustrate the effects that
significant spending cuts would have on the nation's armed forces.
   His committee is weighing proposals to slash President Bush's
request for the anti-missile Strategic Defense Initiative by nearly
$1 billion, leave intact the White House proposal for the B-2
bomber and limit funds for land-based nuclear missiles to research
and development money.
   Bush sought $303 billion for the 1991 fiscal year.
   Pressed by some Democrats for larger cuts than he has proposed,
Nunn laid out an alternative Tuesday to meet the $286 billion total
approved by the Sasser's budget panel. The plan calls for reducing
the 2.1 million-member active-duty force by 285,000.
   However, to meet Nunn's defense figure of $289 billion, Sasser
indicated that a reduction in personnel would total 100,000.
   Sasser, in the three-page letter, said the differences between
the two plans is concentrated in two areas: manpower and personnel
and readiness and sustainability.
   A breakdown of the cuts Nunn required from the various areas of
defense shows that to meet his total $5 billion was cut from
readiness and $1.5 billion from manpower, said congressional
sources who requested anonymity.
   To achieve Sasser's defense spending level, $6 billion was taken
from readiness and $3.9 billion from manpower, the sources said.
   ``The budget resolution is made to look as if it requires
cutting military personnel by 285,000,'' Sasser said in his letter.
``That, of course, was not our intention, and it is not an outcome
necessitated by our approach.''
   Sasser cited the Congressional Budget Office and his own staff's
analysis in arguing that the reductions can be achieved with a
smaller personnel cut and changes in the procurement budgets.
   The armed services committee proposal for the SDI program, also
known as Star Wars, calls for $3.7 billion for the anti-missile
shield. That is about $980 million below the president's request.
   The committee also is considering Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney's revised request for the B-2 stealth bomber, which calls
for two of the radar-evading aircraft in fiscal 1991 and 75 planes
in total.
   ``The B-2 is in, the MX (land-based missile) is out,'' said Sen.
Timothy Wirth, D-Colo., a member of the armed services panel.
   Another proposal before the committee calls for limiting funds
for the program to move MX missiles from fixed silos to railroad
cars to the administration's request for $548 million in research
and development money. Some $1.6 billion in procurement and
construction funds would be eliminated.
   The panel also is considering slightly more than $200 million
for the Midgetman missile.
   Also before the committee is a proposal to eliminate about $750
million in research funds for Milstar, the Air Force's navigation
and communications satellite, and reduce money earmarked for the
Boost Surveillance and Tracking System, said sources who requested
anonymity.
   The latter program is related to the SDI program and would track
tactical ballistic missiles.
   Meanwhile Wednesday, Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the
House Armed Services Committee, met with House Speaker Thomas S.
Foley, D-Wash., on the schedule for considering the defense bill in
that chamber but reached no decision.
   Aspin's committee planned to take up the measure in September,
but other House panels have been pressing for action on the defense
authorization legislation before the August recess, congressional
sources said.

<HEAD>Senators Violated Ethics Standards, Common Cause Brief Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN FLESHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Watergate prosecutor Archibald Cox says
five senators appear to have violated ethics standards in their
involvement with the savings and loan crisis, an accusation one
lawmaker contends smacks of McCarthyism.
   The Senate Ethics Committee is investigating whether the five
broke Senate rules by meeting with regulators about Lincoln Savings
and Loan Association of Irvine, Calif., after accepting a combined
$1.3 million in political contributions from the failed thrift's
owner, Charles Keating Jr.
   The senators appear to have violated a provision in the Code of
Ethics for Government Service, Cox said in a brief filed with the
ethics panel Wednesday on behalf of the citizens' watchdog group
Common Cause, which he chairs.
   Congress has adopted the code for all government employees
including officeholders, he said.
   Cox acknowledged he did not have all the information before the
ethics panel and was relying on published accounts of the senators'
actions.
   If those accounts ``are substantially true, each of the five
violated the (ethics code) as well as the underlying principle
forbidding the use of public office in a way that appears to be
influenced by the receipt of financial benefit,'' Cox said.
   The senators are Alan Cranston, D-Calif.; John Glenn, D-Ohio;
Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz.; John McCain, R-Ariz.; and Donald Riegle,
D-Mich.
   Cox's argument ``is simply saying people should be judged guilty
by association. We tried to put an end to guilt by association when
Joe McCarthy was denounced,'' McCain said in a statement.
``McCarthyism has no place in the deliberations of the ethics
committee or how members of the Senate are judged.''
   Glenn said he had not read the brief but added: ``Common Cause,
like every citizen, has the right to put forward its views. I have
no way of knowing what, if any, influence this opinion will have
with the ethics committee.''
   The Washington Times, meanwhile, citing ``sources close to the
Senate Ethics Committee,'' reported in today's editions that the
committee's special counsel will recommend dropping further
inquires of Glenn and McCain.
   Spokesmen for Cranston, DeConcini and Riegle said they would
have no immediate comment on Common Cause's brief.
   The ethics code says a public servant should never discriminate
by performing special favors, said Cox, a former U.S. solicitor
general and special prosecutor during the Watergate investigation.
   All the senators except Riegle met with Edwin Gray,
then-chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, on April 2,
1987. They discussed the board's investigation of Lincoln S&amp;L,
although details of the conversation are in dispute.
   Riegle joined the four senators a week later at a meeting with
four bank board officials who were investigating Lincoln. He had
received $78,250 from Keating and associates but later returned the
money.
   The board eventually seized control of the insolvent thrift last
year. Bailing out Lincoln is expected to cost taxpayers $2 billion,
making it the most expensive bailout in the savings and loan crisis.
   Citing news reports, Common Cause said the senators pressed
regulators to treat Lincoln fairly and expedite the investigation.
   But even if the senators did not request favorable treatment for
Lincoln, the regulators ``could not fail to be impressed with the
amount of senatorial influence supporting Lincoln Savings and
Loan,'' Cox said.
   Intervention by senators raises ``highly delicate ethical
questions,'' Cox said.
   The Keating case, he said, ``involves such extraordinary use of
the office of senator as to violate the portion of the Code of
Ethics which mandates that a public servant should never
discriminate unfairly by the dispensing of special favors or
privileges to anyone, whether for remuneration or not.''

<TEXT>
   A festival atmosphere is building for the
first Top Dog World Championship Prairie Dog Shoot this weekend.
The sheriff is just hoping the combination of cowboys and
animal-rights activists doesn't get someone killed.
   In this isolated southwestern Colorado town, ravaged by drought
and the closing of most of the uranium mines that were the
economy's backbone, residents hope to have some fun and make a
little money off the competition.
   Stores are selling T-shirts, hats, pins, bandannas and whatever
else they can get a prairie dog logo on. All 52 rooms in the area's
only two motels, in tiny Naturita five miles away, have been booked
for the first time in two years.
   The event has drawn 106 shooters from as far away as Texas and
California. Some 50 protesters, many of whom plan to make a
nine-hour drive from Denver, are also expected to show up for the
two-day hunt starting Saturday.
   ``Those people over there carry guns, but if they don't like our
attitude, tough. We have a First Amendment right to protest,'' said
Robin Duxbury of the Rocky Mountain Humane Society. ``There's no
good reason to shoot prairie dogs.''
   It's shaping up as a clash of cultures _ urban, liberal
animal-rights advocates coming into a rural, conservative valley
where many residents moved to avoid city hassles. The combined
population of Nucla and Naturita is about 1,500.
   Gov. Roy Romer has refused protesters' demand that he protect
them with the National Guard, and local authorities are concerned
about the possibility for violence.
   Sheriff Tom Gilmore said he will have at least 25 officers on
hand, some from the state and the U.S. Bureau of Land Management.
   ``If we can just keep the protesters away from the locals and
the locals away from the protesters, we'll be OK,'' he said.
   Animal-rights activists are demanding that Romer issue an
executive order to stop the hunt. At a rally last week, cartoonist
Berke Breathed and author Cleveland Amory called the prairie dog a
``lovable, innocent, defenseless animal.''
   Many rural Westerners, however, regard prairie dogs as
disease-ridden rats, dangerous to livestock and children.
Teen-agers routinely spend summer mornings shooting the critters.
   ``The problem is, they're called prairie dogs, not rats or
mice,'' said rancher Bob Dyer. ``I got hassled in the Denver
airport last week, but they quieted right down when I told them I'd
ship as many prairie dogs to 'em as they wanted. For $50 a pair,
I'll even put them through sheep dip and get the fleas off.''
   Mike Mahew, the shoot's organizer, said the hunters competing
for more than $7,000 in prizes will have to follow strict rules.
They'll shoot from 7 a.m. to 1 p.m., with rangemasters along to
supervise scoring. No spectators or booze will be allowed.
   ``We'll wait and see,'' Mahew said. ``That's all anybody can
do.''

<HEAD>US to Seek Support for Chamorro</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GEDDA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration plans an ambitious
diplomatic campaign to rally support for Nicaraguan President
Violeta Chamorro in her effort to overcome widespread strikes by
pro-Sandinista workers, U.S. officials say.
   The campaign will be focused on Western Europe and Latin America
and will include personal letters from President Bush to some
foreign leaders, said the officials, who asked not to be identified.
   Several officials scoffed at the notion that the United States
may be planning to intervene militarily on Mrs. Chamorro's behalf.
   The State Department said Wednesday that Mrs. Chamorro has not
asked for U.S. assistance nor, has the United States offered any.
   Strike leaders say 90,000 workers have walked off their jobs
since the unrest began almost two weeks ago, but Nicaraguan
officials say that figure is highly exaggerated.
   Mrs. Chamorro and the State Department have both said the
strikes are a politically motivated effort by the leftist
Sandinistas to undercut the government's economic program.
   Five weeks ago, delegates from more than 20 countries assembled
in Rome to pledge financial backing for the Nicaraguan government,
based on Mrs. Chamorro's economic recovery program.
   The plan includes some painful adjustment measures, including an
end to government subsidies on some food items as part of bid to
bring down the country's high inflation rate.
   The message being sent by Bush and U.S. diplomats is that Mrs.
Chamorro deserves support at a time when she is under fire for
implementing a program which has won broad international backing,
the officials said.
   The pledges at the Rome conference came to about $300 million,
the officials added, roughly the same as the U.S. bilateral aid
program.
   ``She (Mrs. Chamorro) needs the kind of international support
that will encourage the Sandinistas to cease and desist,'' one
official said.
   Underscoring the apparent U.S. determination to limit American
involvement in the conflict, the State Department expressed full
confidence in Mrs. Chamorro's ability to manage the situation.
   At least four people have been killed and 84 injured in the
disturbances, but strike leaders issued a statement Wednesday
indicating interest in a negotiated settlement.
   The State Department, meanwhile, expressed support for Mrs.
Chamorro's call for a swift and peaceful resolution of the conflict.
   Deputy spokesman Richard Boucher said mismanagement by the
Sandinista government that Mrs. Chamorro succeeded this year left
the Nicaraguan economy in ``disastrous straits.''
   Now, he said, for political gain, ``they are seeking to blame
the government for taking reform measures necessary to clean up the
mess.''
   The department said Wednesday night it is urging U.S. citizens
not to travel to Nicaragua at present because of the unrest.
Americans in Nicaragua were urged to stay inside their hotels and
homes.

<HEAD>First Lady Says Other Summit Spouses Raved Over Houston</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Barbara Bush says President Bush ``spoke for
all the family'' when he made a spirited defense of son Neil Bush's
integrity in a savings and loan bankruptcy case.
   The first lady, gently resisting further questioning about the
case, told reporters, ``You don't want to see a grown woman cry, do
you?''
   She spoke on Air Force One on the way home Wednesday night from
the economic summit in Houston.
   Mrs. Bush attended the post-summit news conference where the
president confided the probe has been hard on the family.
   The president said he has had said he had to calm down other
sons who want to ``go to the barricades'' against what they regard
as unfair criticism of their brother's role as an outside director
of Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan Association of Denver, which
went under at a cost to taxpayers of $1 billion.
   ``The president spoke for all the family today,'' the first lady
said. ``I loved what he said.''
   Mrs. Bush, confessing to ``a little bit of chauvinism'' for her
hometown, says she heard nothing but raves from the other leaders'
wives for the job Houston did.
   Asked whether she was exhausted, the first lady made a tired
face and said, ``I ain't going to lie to you.'' She joked that
``what's-his-name feels fabulous.''
   Actually, the president plans to ``get a good rest at Camp
David'' this weekend, she said.
   Mrs. Bush, sporting a silver star and Lone Star earrings given
to all the leaders' wives received as mementos, said even the heat
was not ``as bad as I expected.''
   She said ``the real truth'' is that ``it was hotter every single
day in Washington, D.C. than it was in Houston, Texas.''
   She expressed amazement that 5,000 volunteers turned out
beforehand to clean up Houston's streets.
   ``They didn't just clean the streets we saw. They cleaned ...
all the neighborhoods. They were wonderful,'' she said.
   ``The wives raved _ truthfully _ over everything. They raved
over the attitude of the people,'' she said.
   ``I heard one wife say to another one, 'If you went home to your
country, do you think you could find 5,000 volunteers to put on a
program like this?' And she said, `No way. We don't even understand
the concept of volunteers,''' related Mrs. Bush, who refused to
identify her.
   She said ``I love'' Denis Thatcher, husband of Britain's prime
minister and denied he felt out of place as the only male spouse at
the summit.
   ``Oh, no. We had men at the party for him,'' she said, referring
to Monday's dinner for spouses.
   ``But I told him he could no longer kiss my hand because I am
not going to be teased back into kissing his,'' said Mrs. Bush, who
did just that in London last year.

   President Bush is brimming with pride over his
hometown's job in hosting the Houston summit, but he's not ready to
endorse it as his choice for the 1992 Republican National
Convention.
   ``I'm not sure how much say I want to have on that,'' Bush told
reporters on Air Force One Wednesday night on his way back from
Texas. ``It's like judging a beauty contest. One contestant is
happy and the others are mad.
   ``But they did a great job on this,'' he added.

   Wilson Scaling, chief of the Soil Conservation
Service for five years, has resigned his Agriculture Department job.
   Assistant Secretary James R. Mosely, who oversees USDA natural
resources and environment programs, said Wednesday he has named Roy
M. ``Mack'' Gray as acting chief of the agency. Gray, a career
employee, has been an assistant to Scaling.
   Spokeswoman Jane Ade Stevens said Scaling, a political
appointee, had been head of the agency for five years and that
Mosely felt it was time for a change. However, she said, Scaling
resigned as was not fired.
   Scaling was named chief of conservation agency in 1985 by then
Agriculture Secretary John R. Block. He is from Henrietta, Texas,

<HEAD>Consumer Group Urges Heart-Valve Maker Warn Patients of Defects</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A consumer group wants federal authorities to
force a heart-valve manufacturer to warn 56,000 people of defects
in the value.
   Public Citizen petitioned the government Wednesday to make the
Irvine, Calif.-based Shiley Inc., a subsidiary of Pfizer Inc., to
notify all those who have had the device implanted about the
symptoms and consequences of a failed valve. The group also wants
the company to advise patients of the risks and benefits of having
the valve removed.
   The company has reported to the FDA more than 250 deaths that
have resulted from fractures of the valve.
   Public Citizen asked the FDA to order the company to send a
notice to each person who has had a Shiley valve implanted
describing the signs and symptoms of imminent valve failure.
   The notice also would list each hospital in the United States
where open heart surgery is performed so patients would know where
to go for emergency valve replacement surgery.
   Public Citizen filed suit against the company in March to force
the company to notify patients directly, but the suit was dismissed
in Los Angeles County Superior Court.
   Public Citizen has filed an appeal.
   Robert J. Fauteux, a spokesman for Shiley, said the company has
followed the FDA's policy on the matter, which recommends that
companies communicate with patients through their physicians.
   Shiley has kept physicians of patients with Shiley valves
updated on the device's problems on a regular basis since 1980, he
said.
   The FDA is reviewing its recommendation on how to get
information to patients, and ``if the FDA were to reconsider its
policy, Shiley would reassess our policy,'' Fauteux said.
   FDA spokesman Jeff Nesbit said agency officials would review
Public Citizen's petition.

<HEAD>Mitchell Moves to End Trade Status for China</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell is
taking steps to end favored trade treatment for China, saying the
administration's hopes for improved human rights have proved futile.
   President Bush notified Congress on May 24 that he was renewing
most-favored-nation trading status and its preferential tariff
treatment for Chinese goods.
   The status took effect July 3 _ exactly 13 months after the
government's bloody crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators in and
around Beijing's Tiananmen Square.
   Mitchell, with 16 other Democratic and Republican senators,
introduced a bill that would roll back the preferred trading status
until the president certifies that political prisoners in China
have been freed, free emigration is granted, surveillance of
Chinese students abroad is halted and religious persecution is
stopped.
   The certification also would have to assert that press freedom
has been restored, pro-democracy leaders aren't being persecuted
and internationally recognized human rights are being honored.
   Mitchell, D-Maine, said he was introducing the bill ``to give
tangible expression'' to what he called Americans' overwhelming
support for the dormant Chinese pro-democracy forces.

   The dollar firmed against the Japanese yen in Tokyo
Thursday, and share prices closed higher on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange.
   The dollar closed at 148.90 yen, up 0.80 yen from Wednesday's
close of 148.10 yen. It opened at 148.78 yen and ranged between
148.40 yen and 149.25 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues gained 281.14
points, or 0.87 percent, to 32,575.32. The index had risen 141.18
points Wednesday.
   Foreign exchange dealers said the dollar was higher after the
economic summit in Houston failed to fulfill market expectations of
a call for a stronger yen.
   They also said the dollar firmed after Bank of Japan officials
denied Wednesday renewed speculation over an increase in Japan's
official discount rate.
   A dealer with Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank said the dollar's rebound
also was attributable to ``those who sold the currency too
excessively yesterday were buying back today.'' On Wednesday, the
dollar plunged to a 4{-month low against the yen in Tokyo.
   Dealers on the stock market said share prices were higher aided
by a steep overnight rebound on Wall Street and the absence of
heavy selling.
   In bond dealings, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds stood at 86.90 points, unchanged from
Wednesday's close. The yield was 7.215 percent, unchanged.

<HEAD>New Drug Shows Promise in Treating Osteoporosis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A prescription drug already on the market can
reverse the slow loss of spinal bone that causes the crushed
vertebrae and stooped posture of old age, a study published today
shows.
   Women who took the medicine in a two-year experiment conducted
at seven U.S. medical centers cut their risk of broken vertebrae in
half.
   ``We think it's extremely encouraging news,'' said Sandra
Raymond, executive director of the National Osteoporosis
Foundation. ``Our arsenal is very small. Hopefully now, based on
these studies, we may have another option.''
   The medicine, called etidronate, joins two other prescription
medicines available to treat osteoporosis, the brittle-bones
disease that afflicts an estimated 15 million to 20 million
Americans. Because of its apparent advantages, it could become the
medicine of choice for many elderly victims.
   ``This is really exciting,'' said Dr. Nelson B. Watts of Emory
University, principal author of the study. ``We can wait until
somebody is already in bad shape and make them better. They won't
stand straight or play basketball. But the deterioration will be
halted.''
   Crushed vertebrae are the most common consequence of
osteoporosis, a disorder that largely affects women after
menopause. There is no evidence so far that etidronate will prevent
hip fractures, which are a less common but more serious hazard of
the disease.
   The study was published in today's New England Journal of
Medicine. In May, the journal carried a smaller study by European
researchers that reached similar conclusions. Both studies were
financed by Procter &amp; Gamble's Norwich Eaton Pharmaceuticals, which
makes etidronate.
   In the latest work, 429 women with osteoporosis were randomly
assigned to take etidronate or dummy placebos for two years. When
it was over, the spinal bone density of those getting etidronate
had increased 5 percent, and they suffered half as many vertebral
fractures as the other women.
   During their younger years, people lose old bone and make new
bone at about the same rate. Later on, however, many lose bone
faster than they replace it.
   Etidronate works by slowing the body's resorption of old bone.
This allows the slow production of new bone to outpace the loss.
The medicine resulted in a two-thirds drop in fractures in women
with the weakest bones, the study showed.
   ``The impact of etidronate was greatest in individuals with the
lowest bone mass,'' noted Dr. William Peck of Washington University
in St. Louis. ``That means we are talking about reducing fractures
in people who are at the greatest risk. That's an exciting
possibility.''
   During the study, the women took the medicine for two weeks out
of every three months. The drug is already on the market for
treatment of Paget's disease, another bone ailment. However, it has
not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for
osteoporosis.
   Currently, the only prescription drugs approved for treatment of
osteoporosis are estrogen and calcitonin.
   Etidronate carries no known side effects, costs $200 to $300 per
year and is taken in pill form. Doctors say these are important
advantages. Calcitonin requires three injections a week and costs
10 times more.
   While estrogen is a highly effective treatment for protecting
bones during the first years after menopause, doctors are unsure
whether it helps older women. Estrogen, which is a sex hormone,
cannot be taken by women at high risk of breast cancer. It also can
cause resumption of menstrual bleeding.

<HEAD>Police Stake Out Killer They Suspect Could Strike Today</HEAD>

   Undercover police guided by the stars staked out
various points in the city in their quest for the Zodiac killer,
whose 21-day pattern of shootings led investigators to suspect he
would strike again today.
   Police consulted astrological charts, occult books, FBI
psychological profiles and letters scrawled by the gunman in
selecting their positions.
   The gunman has vowed in his letters to shoot 12 people, one for
each sign of the zodiac. He has struck four times in four months.
One victim died.
   Police, including a task force of 50, refused to divulge the
locations staked out. To match Zodiac's pattern of preying on easy
targets, they dressed as homeless or elderly people or others who
are vulnerable.
   The Guardian Angels, a red-bereted citizen crime-fighting force,
patrolled sections of the Brooklyn-Queens boundary, where three of
the attacks took place, and inside Central Park, where the fourth
occurred.
   The shootings have followed a 21-day pattern. The first occurred
March 8, the others on March 29, May 31 and June 21. The time
between the second and third shootings was 63 days, a multiple of
21. Each shooting occurred early on a Thursday.
   The Zodiac's victims, all men, have been a Scorpio, a Gemini, a
Taurus and a Cancer. In letters he sent to police and news
organizations, he scrawled the symbols for his victims'
astrological signs.
   One survivor said a stranger asked him his birth date two days
before he was shot. Police said the gunman may have obtained other
victims' birth dates where applications are filled out, such as
banks or government offices.
   Chief of Detectives Joseph Borrelli acknowledged on Wednesday
the best leads could come after the killer claims another victim.
   ``The more times an incident occurs, the better the chance of
finding the individual,'' he said.
   In his letters, the gunman has tried to convince police he is
the Zodiac who terrorized San Francisco during the late 1960s and
early 1970s.
   The original Zodiac is believed to have killed as many as 40
people. Police doubt the New York killer is the same person but
think he may be getting his ideas from a 1986 book about the San
Francisco attacks.
   While police searched and waited, some wary New Yorkers stayed
inside.
   Madeline Sanchez, 17, of Queens, said the Zodiac has affected
her social life.
   ``My mother's making me come home by 11. She doesn't want me to
be going out when Zodiac is around. But I told her he shoots old
men, not young girls,'' she said.
   In tracking the gunman, detectives studied a turn-of-the-century
book called ``The Law is For All,'' which contains a series of
revelations from a deity named Aiwass, news reports said. The 21st
revelation in the Aleister Crowley book reads, ``Nature's way is to
weed out the weak. This is the most merciful way.''
   Two of Zodiac's victims walked with canes. Another was shot
while drunk. The fourth was wounded while sleeping on a park bench.

<TEXT>
   An international conference to discuss the future
of Vietnamese boat people has been postponed in a continued
disagreement over repatriation of non-refugees.
   Raymond Hall, spokesman for the Office of the United Nations
High Commissioner for Refugees, said Wednesday that no new date has
been set for the conference, which had been scheduled for July
16-17.
   Hall called the delay ``very dangerous'' and said risks were
growing that countries near Vietnam would refuse to allow boat
people to land on their shores. He said about 112,000 boat people
are in Southeast Asian refugee camps.
   He said the delay could threaten the U.N. principle of first
asylum, under which refuge-seekers are granted temporary asylum
until they are resettled in other nations or repatriated to their
homeland.
   A U.N. meeting last year agreed on an international plan to cope
with the flood of Vietnamese boat people, including the
introduction of screening procedures to separate genuine refugees _
those escaping political persecution _ from migrants in search of a
better life.
   It also set up a program to repatriate people wishing to go back
to Vietnam. So far 3,400 have returned voluntarily, Hall said.
   However, disagreement continues over the fate of non-refugees
who are unwilling to be sent back.
   The Bush administration remains opposed to the forcible
repatriation of economic migrants. Diplomats in Geneva say U.S.
officials, privately, are showing some flexibility.
   Hanoi, also, is reluctant to accept involuntary returns.
   Britain, under pressure from its overcrowded Hong Kong colony,
and Southeast Asian nations have demanded the United States agree
to mandatory repatriation or set up its own camps to accommodate
non-refugees.
   At a meeting in Manila in May, Southeast Asian countries issued
an ultimatum that they would stop granting asylum if no settlement
was reached.
   Hall said the High Commissioner had agreed to postpone next
week's meeting because of lack of common ground among participants
_ the United States and other resettlement countries, first-asylum
countries and Vietnam.
   He said intense negotiations were taking place, but a further
meeting was unlikely to take place before August.
   Hall said by the end of May there were 112,000 boat people in
camps in the region, up from 83,000 in May 1989. About 55,000 are
in in Hong Kong.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If Madonna could trade places with someone,
living or dead, who would it be?
   Marilyn Monroe? Nah. ``She'd probably have an exercise video,''
the sultry singer-actress said.
   John F. Kennedy Jr.? Nope. But she'd like to be stranded with
him if they were the only two people left on the planet.
   Forget it. You'll never guess. Try Malcolm X.
   Actually, Madonna first chose Frida Kahlo to trade places with,
but remembered the painter, who died in 1954, spent much of her
life in pain after being crippled in a streetcar accident. So the
assassinated black Muslim leader was her next choice.
   Madonna answered these and other questions submitted by readers
of the teen magazine YM. Her answers are in the August issue, which
hit newsstands Wednesday.
   Other gems: The best present she ever received was ``a handful
of sweaty diamonds and emeralds.'' She didn't say from whom.
   If she had only two days to live she'd spend them ``eating
potato chips, watching `The Little Rascals.'''
   And if Madonna could change herself in any way, what would she
change?
   ``Just my hairdresser,'' she says.

<HEAD>October Earthquake Producing Tiny Temblors, a Hospital Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tiny aftershocks of the Bay Area earthquake
are being delivered this month, nine months after the earth moved,
says a hospital projecting up to a two-thirds increase in births.
   But other hospitals are not sure the fault for any baby boom
lies with the Oct. 17 quake that caused blackouts and trapped
people at home for days.
   Seton Medical Center in Daly City just south of San Francisco
projects the higher birth rate for July. ``We're calling them quake
babies,'' Kathy Kohrman, Seton's director of marketing, said
Wednesday.
   ``We had a blackout situation, but not a lot of devastation from
the quake in our area. And people had a lot of time on their
hands,'' she said.
   Lisa Gonzales, a nurse at Seton, was due July 15 but delivered
7-pound Alejandro prematurely this week.
   ``The telephones were down, the TV wasn't working,'' Mrs.
Gonzales said of the situation at her house. ``It was a very
emotional time.
   ``We didn't know whether we were going to see each other again
and so, you know.''
   Mrs. Gonzales was at home and her husband, Dr. Gilberto
Gonzales, was working when the quake struck. It measured 7.1 on the
Richter scale and killed 67 people.
   ``He took several days off work after that when he finally got
home,'' Mrs. Gonzales said. ``I was afraid to be home alone for a
while. We weren't really planning a baby, but we had been thinking
about it.''
   Seton expects to deliver 100 babies this month, compared with 60
to 80 during an average July.
   Newborns will get special ``quake baby'' certificates and
mothers and fathers will win a ``parent survival kit'' if their
infant weighs in at 7 pounds, 1 ounce, the hospital said. The kit
includes diapers and toys.
   Other San Francisco area hospitals say the wave of births hasn't
registered on any scale yet.
   ``We did have a fairly high rate of birth over the norm during
June, but I can't say it was quake-related,'' said Barbara Shingai,
spokeswoman for the community hospital in Watsonville, nearest the
epicenter of the temblor. ``It's really too early to tell if we'll
see a continued peak in July.''
   She said 136 babies were born at the Watsonville hospital in
June compared to an average 129 a month.
   Kaiser hospitals in Northern California and San Francisco
General Hospital also report no shakeups in their delivery
statistics this summer.
   ``There's a two-year trend in California and the U.S. of rising
birth rates, but I don't think you can speculate that the
earthquake is causing any of it,'' said Jennifer Cross of Kaiser.
``It's hard to tell what's behind birth rates.''

   Rain fell across the Midwest and South today, but the early
morning hours offered little relief from the sweltering heat in the
Southwest.
   Showers dampened parts of Louisiana and Indiana early today.
Rain fell over Ohio and Tennessee.
   Today's forecast called for thunderstorms to develop from
Arkansas to northern Virginia and over New Mexico, central Texas
and southern Nebraska. Rain was forecast from southern Missouri to
the Eastern Seaboard.
   Temperatures remained above 90 in parts of the Southwest early
today. It was 97 in Phoenix and 92 in Las Vegas at midnight
Wednesday.
   Temperatures soared above 100 degrees earlier Wednesday as far
north as Washington state. Pendleton, Ore., reported a record high
for the date of 105 degrees.
   Temperatures also rose above 100 in southern Oklahoma, northern
Texas, South Carolina and Georgia. Augusta, Ga., had a record high
of 103.
   The high for the nation on Wednesday was 123 degrees at Death
Valley, Calif.
   Also Wednesday, thunderstorms developed over Colorado, Arizona,
Oklahoma, Nebraska, Kansas, the Dakotas, Iowa, Minnesota and
western Wisconsin.
   A thunderstorm pelted metropolitan Denver with golf ball-sized
hail and heavy rain, injuring about 25 passengers on an amusement
park sky ride, and damaging hundreds of windows and parked cars.
   One stranded passenger said the hail pounded the ride's
machinery so hard that it made his ears ring. The injuries were
confined to cuts and bruises.
   Thunderstorms also rumbled over Virginia, Georgia and the
Carolinas.

<HEAD>Report: East Germany Allowed Libyan Attack On Discotheque</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL VERSCHUUR</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WEST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ousted East German leader Erich Honecker and
his secret police chief allowed Libyan terrorists to carry out the
1986 discotheque bombing that killed two American soldiers, a
leading newspaper reported today.
   The West Berlin bombing, which also killed a Turkish woman,
prompted the U.S. Air Force raid on the Libyan capital of Tripoli
10 days later.
   The report in the West Germany paper Die Welt was the latest in
a string of disclosures on relations between international
terrorists and Honecker's Communist regime.
   According to the report, secret police chief Erich Mielke knew
on March 20, 1986, that Libyan terrorists were about to attack a
U.S. target in West Berlin, but did nothing to stop it.
   Sixteen days later, a bomb at the La Belle discotheque killed
the soldiers and Turkish woman and injured more than 200 other
people.
   ``On March 24, the Ministry for State Security (secret police)
drafted a written report for Honecker. The response was not to do
anything but rather to let the Libyans do as they pleased,'' Die
Welt said.
   A colonel in the secret police, or Stasi, who tried to stop the
April 5 bombing was fired on the spot, the paper said.
   The terrorist incident provoked the April 15 U.S. bombing raid
on the Libyan cities of Benghazi and Tripoli, including an attack
on the heavily guarded compound of Libyan leader Col. Moammar
Gadhafi.
   Die Welt said Stasi archives gave a detailed account of
preparations for the La Belle bombing.
   The paper supplied gave the following account:
   On March 25, 1986, a man claiming to be a diplomatic courier for
the Libyan's People's Bureau, or embassy, in East Berlin, drove
into West Berlin in an embassy car carrying seven grenades, three
automatic pistols and two semi-automatic rifles.
   The driver, identified as Musbah al-Albani, carried a note with
the addresses of three discotheques, including La Belle. Stasi
records even contain the car's license number, CD 68-20.
   However, the attack was postponed because of inadequate planning.
   The driver traveled to West Berlin once more on March 30 but
returned on April 4, the eve of the La Belle bombing.
   On April 5, the Stasi monitored a telephone call to the home of
Yussef Salam, a Palestinian it knew under the code name of ``Nuri.''
   Immediately after the call, in which Salam was told ``It hasn't
worked out yet,'' he met with a Libyan embassy official and drove
to West Berlin.
   The La Belle bomb went off around 5 a.m. that morning.
   Die Welt identified several other Palestinians and Libyans who
allegedly played a role in the attack. Salam, who also uses the
name of Yasser Chraidi, is believed to be living in Algeria, it
said.
   Authorities of the non-Communist government that came to power
in East Germany after free elections in March also say the
Communist regime harbored West German terrorists of the Red Army
Faction, which launched fatal attacks in West Germany. Some
suspects have been captured.
   East German Interior Minister Peter-Michael Diestel has been
quoted as saying the Stasi sheltered the international terrorist
known as Carlos as well as the man believed responsible for the
1972 massacre of 17 Israeli athletes at the Olympic Games in Munich.
   The secret police force maintained at least informal contacts
with the Basque separatist group ETA and the Irish Republican Army,
which seeks to overthrow British rule in Northern Ireland, Diestel
has said.

   A band played ``Happy Days Are Here Again'' and
City Hall was adorned with flags from every state as officials
celebrated the news that the Big Apple will host the 1992
Democratic convention.
   Democratic National Chairman Ron Brown, Mayor David Dinkins and
Gov. Mario Cuomo used a desk Wednesday in City Hall that belonged
to George Washington to sign a contract making New York City the
convention site.
   ``We won't let you down,'' Dinkins told Brown, an old friend and
native New Yorker. ``New York is a great convention town.''
   The convention at Madison Square Garden is expected to pump $100
million into the New York economy and bring 35,000 delegates,
guests and journalists to town.
   ``Democrats will nominate the next president of the United
States two years from now this week in America's most dynamic city
and in one of the world's greatest cities _ New York, the Big
Apple,'' Dinkins said.
   The race for the Democratic presidential nominee is wide open.
   New York was chosen over New Orleans as the convention site.
   Brown said New Orleans' chances were hurt by the Louisiana
Legislature's passage of strong anti-abortion legislation, but that
was not the deciding factor.
   New York's early pledge to come up with the more than $20
million for the convention and a pledge by prominent Democratic
fund-raisers in the city to fill the party's coffers helped
persuade Brown.
   New York had the convention in 1976, when Jimmy Carter was
nominated and won the presidency, and in 1980, when Carter was
renominated and lost.

<TEXT>
   Gov. Bob Martinez has moved to shore up
his law-and-order image in a tough re-election campaign after an
apparent murder by an escaped convict stirred memories of the
Willie Horton affair.
   Earlier this week, Martinez, a Republican, ordered thousands of
prison inmates removed from work-release programs similar to one
that cost Democrat Michael Dukakis dearly in his failed 1988
presidential bid.
   Among the inmates affected by Martinez' order was 80-year-old
Roswell Gilbert, who is serving a life sentence for shooting his
wife in a widely publicized mercy-killing case.
   In the 1988 presidential race, then-candidate George Bush
painted Dukakis, the Massachusetts governor, as a liberal weak on
crime. GOP television ads featured Horton, a Massachusetts inmate
who raped a Maryland woman while on a furlough program.
   Public-opinion surveys indicate Martinez can ill afford to lose
ground on law enforcement, an issue that helped propel him to
victory in 1986.
   But the June 24 slaying of a woman at a shopping mall, allegedly
by a convicted killer who walked away from a prison work detail,
gave Democratic challengers an opening against the vulnerable
first-term governor.
   The front-runner in the Democratic race for governor, popular
former U.S. Sen. Lawton Chiles, immediately seized on the slaying
of 44-year-old Faye Lamb Vann as evidence that Martinez's tough
talk on crime was just that: talk.
   ``It's proof that there is no system, there is no strategy about
how we're going to fight crime in this state,'' said Chiles, who
served three terms in the Senate. ``I think it's obvious that this
has not been something the governor and his people have been paying
attention to.''
   Mrs. Vann's alleged killer, escapee Donald David Dillbeck, was
convicted of killing a sheriff's deputy in 1979. Dillbeck was
eligible for minimum-security work details despite his crime.
   Martinez denied he was trying to put out a political fire by
removing inmates from work-release programs.
   ``I don't think we can guarantee forever that someone can't get
away from one of our prison systems. We can guarantee there's less
likelihood now. The great regret is that the life can't be brought
back,'' Martinez said.
   The governor said the state's inmate review system wasn't
working and was antiquated when he ordered 3,400 inmates in
work-release programs to more secure prisons.
   Before the new controversy, Martinez had often touted the 28,000
new prison beds authorized during his administration. He made a
television ad boasting of the number of death warrants he has
signed that featured the smiling face of serial killer Ted Bundy,
put to death in January 1989.
   But recent polls have indicated Chiles would defeat both
Martinez and the other Democrat running in the Sept. 4 primary,
U.S. Rep. Bill Nelson. The surveys also show Nelson beating
Martinez.
   Nelson has stayed out of the Dillbeck case. He was burned
earlier in the campaign by attempting to attack Martinez over the
early prison release of a black man, Charles Street, who is
currently on trial in Miami for the subsequent slayings of two
Miami police officers.
   Nelson brought up the spectre of Horton, who is also black, then
was forced to apologize when civil rights activists labeled his
charges racist.
   Chiles hasn't mentioned Horton, but contends Mrs. Vann might be
alive if Martinez had been properly managing the prison system.
   ``If you can do it today, then obviously there was room to do it
all along,'' he said. ``He just elected not to do it or failed to
do it.''

<HEAD>Missouri Buys Houses to Prevent Move to Peoria, Ill.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PEORIA, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A historical society won't be allowed to
cart off three French colonial houses from Missouri in its efforts
to celebrate this western Illinois city's tricentennial next year.
   Missouri decided late last month to buy the houses in Ste.
Genevieve, Mo., to keep them there, Jane Beetem of the Missouri
Department of Natural Resources said Tuesday. The purchase price
was not disclosed.
   She said the state will try to resell the houses with
stipulations they remain in Ste. Genevieve, a town of 5,000 that
was once part of France's Louisiana Territory.
   ``We certainly would have hated to see them moved,'' Ms. Beetem
said Tuesday. `They are a very unique type of property.''
   The state of Missouri became interested in the houses after a
group called Peoria 1691 Foundation said it wanted to buy and move
them to Peoria in time for the Illinois River city's tricentennial
in September 1991.
   One proposal called for reconstructing on the banks of the
Illinois River a French colony like the settlement three centuries
ago that evolved into Peoria.
   The original village, located in what is now downtown Peoria,
was destroyed by fire in 1812, forcing civic leaders to look
elsewhere for authentic French colonial houses to restore.
   The prospect of Peoria buying and moving historic houses
outraged local residents of Ste. Genevieve who demanded Missouri
officials step in to prevent the transaction.
   The three houses targeted by Peoria included the
Bequette-Ribault House _ a restored log ``post-and-ground house''
built sometime between 1790 and 1808.
   It's considered valuable because there are only four known
structures of its kind in the United States and three of those are
in Ste. Genevieve, a town of 5,000 located 75 miles south of St.
Louis on the Mississippi River.
   The other historic structures are: the Durant House built in
1810; and the Rozier Cabin, built in 1841 and currently
disassembled and in storage. A fourth home had been considered but
the society expressed concern about moving it because it is built
of stone.

<NOTE>Eds: To UPDATE with comment from Wilson, SUB two grafs for 19th,
`Wilson, who ...' Picks up 20th pvs, `Commenting in ...'
^By MARCUS ELIASON</NOTE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The code that governs British treatment of royalty
is largely unwritten but always strict, and novelist A.N. Wilson
has violated one of the sternest rules of all.
   His sin has been to report a dinner-table chat with Her Majesty
Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother.
   That her remarks to Wilson were fairly innocuous, and that the
conversation took place nearly a decade ago, matters little. The
affair has provoked some sharp language from London society.
   ``Scoundrel!'' thundered Lord Wyatt of Weeford.
   ``An intolerable betrayal!'' echoed Nicholas Soames, member of
Parliament and scion of the Churchill family.
   Wilson, 39, is a gifted novelist and acute social commentator
who clearly knew he was courting trouble when he published ``The
Queen Mother's table-talk'' in the weekly Spectator magazine two
weeks ago.
   ``It is probably the grossest impropriety to embarrass her, or
her host, by repeating our conversation,'' he wrote.
   ``I do so, however, without very much compunction, since she
never gives `interviews,' and I can think of no better person than
Queen Elizabeth with whom to start off an occasional series of
conversations with men and women who have lived through most of the
years of this century ... and whose memories stretch back far.''
   In the conversation, reproduced in dialogue form, the mother of
Queen Elizabeth II and widow of King George VI was said to have
revealed a fondness for detective stories, and a problem with her
cash flow: ``Had such an awful afternoon today with my bank
manager, scolding me about my overdraft.''
   After a few remarks about politics came this gem of an account
of a poetry evening at Windsor Castle during World War II, at which
T.S. Eliot recited ``The Waste Land.''
   Elizabeth: ``We had this rather lugubrious man in a suit, and he
read a poem. ... I think it was called `The Desert.' And first the
girls got the giggles, and then I did and then even the King.''
   Wilson: ```The Desert,' ma'am? Are you sure it wasn't called
`The Waste Land?'''
   Elizabeth: ``That's it. I'm afraid we all giggled. Such a gloomy
man, looked as though he worked in a bank, and we didn't understand
a word.''
   Wilson: ``I believe he DID once work in a bank.''
   The article, published in the midst of national celebrations of
the queen mother's 90th birthday, was thoughtful and affectionate.
   But Lord Wyatt, himself a former journalist, was scandalized,
especially since it was he who was host of the dinner.
   ``Wilson is boastfully shameless in being a scoundrel,'' he
wrote in a letter to the Spectator published a week later. It was,
he charged, a ``deceitfully obtained and stolen `interview.'''
   Soames, in a letter to the magazine, called it ``an appalling
want of chivalry'' and ``an absolutely fundamental breach of
trust.''
   Buckingham Palace, which speaks for the queen mother, declined
to comment. But Wilson, who prefers initials to his first name,
Andrew, reacted in this week's Spectator to what he called an
``absurd taboo.''
   ``Why all the fuss?'' he asked. ``The Queen Mother is about to
be 90 years old. The newspapers are full of 16-page, full-color
supplements all, roughly speaking, conveying the message, `Gawd
bless yer, Ma'am.' None of the articles I have read have conveyed
what it is like to meet her, or what she says.''
   Commenting in The Independent on Sunday, columnist Francis Wheen
said Wyatt was cutting ``a comical figure.'' He noted that the
lord's own autobiography contained gossipy tidbits from his private
conversations with famous people.
   Wyatt warned that the affair would strengthen those who want to
impose stricter privacy laws on the media.
   Wheen wrote that Wyatt himself is a columnist, for the tabloid
News of the World, ``and although that newspaper has many
qualities, respect for privacy is not, I think, one of them.''
   Hugh Montgomery-Massingberd argued in The Daily Telegraph that
writers were always scribbling down conversations with the high and
mighty, hoping to publish them one day.
   ``This may be an ungentlemanly instinct,'' he wrote. But ``you
have to decide whether to be a gent or a scribbler and I, for one,
am prepared to defend A. N. Wilson for choosing the latter course.''

<TEXT>
   The troubled Covenant House for young runaways
has turned to a nun to restore cash and credibility that were
diminished in a scandal that forced the resignation of its founder.
   Covenant House said Wednesday it selected Sister Mary Rose
McGeady as president. She replaces the Rev. Bruce Ritter, a
Franciscan priest who resigned in February.
   Sister McGeady, 62, is an associate executive director of
Catholic Charities in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn. She
oversees 80 social service programs, a $40 million budget and a
staff of more than 800 people.
   The Covenant House Board of Directors named Sister McGeady on
Tuesday. She takes office Sept. 1.
   In a statement, Sister McGeady said she looks forward to the
challenge of ensuring Covenant House ``continues to shine as a
beacon for the thousands of kids who are still out there without a
family or home.''
   Covenant House shelters 25,000 youths annually in 17 dormitories
in the United States, Canada and Latin America.
   Ritter, who resigned Feb. 27, had been accused of having sexual
relations with shelter residents and lending Covenant House funds
to two former board members. He has denied wrongdoing.
   Covenant House officials have expressed concern that the
institution may have difficulty surviving without Ritter, whose
fund-raising appeals attracted hundreds of millions of dollars in
donations.
   Donations, which almost solely sustain Covenant House, have
fluctuated wildly since his departure. Anticipating serious losses,
the organization's board has laid off 111 of its 420 employees and
cut its budget from $86 million to $72 million in the new fiscal
year, which started July 1.
   ``We're hoping the donations will come back up,'' Sister McGeady
said in a telephone interview. ``If they don't it might be
necessary for us to do some more cutting.''

<HEAD>Animal-Rights Activist Challenges Pigeon Shoot Organizer to Fight</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An animal-rights activist has challenged
an organizer of a pigeon shoot to a no-rules fistfight to end the
fund-raising event that leaves thousands of birds dead each year.
   Steve Hindi, among 300 animal-rights activists who protested the
Labor Day shoot last year, challenged organizer Bob Tobash in a
letter.
   ``Shooting a pigeon down is punk sport,'' Hindi said in an
interview. ``We'll throw out the rules. We'll give them the pure
blood sport that they've become accustomed to. One man against one
man.''
   Tobash said he did not know Hindi and the challenge appeared to
be a publicity stunt.
   ``There's 200 people involved in this,'' Tobash said. ``Even if
I would have the duel with him, it doesn't mean the other people
would call off the shoot. He's attacking me and I take offense to
that.''
   The pigeon shoot has been a tradition for 57 years in Hegins
Township, a community of nearly 4,000 residents about 50 miles
northwest of Allentown.
   Between 5,000 and 8,000 pigeons are shot during the daylong
event, which is held to raise money for a 30-acre park in Hegins.
   Pigeons that survive the shoot are killed later when their necks
are snapped by youngsters recruited to do the task.
   ``They think it's sportsmanlike,'' said Hindi, from Plano, Ill.
``It's barbaric.''
   In his letter, which Tobash received Tuesday, Hindi proposed
that they each put up $10,000 and ``meet in a public place in the
Hegins area for a physical confrontation which would be without
time limit, rules, officiating or any protective gear whatsoever.''
   If Tobash were victorious, Hindi said his $10,000 would go
toward maintaining the Hegins Community Park. Should Hindi prevail,
he proposes that the shoot be canceled and Tobash's $10,000 be
forfeited to the park.
   The confrontation would end when either man submits or is unable
to continue, Hindi proposed.
   Animal-rights advocates have lobbied state legislators annually
to ban the pigeon shoot, but Schuylkill County lawmakers have
killed such efforts.
   Tobash said the shoot is the ``most effective'' way for the town
to raise money to maintain the park.
   ``We would like to have these groups leave us alone. It's a
sporting event,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   The government said today that Tamil
rebels fleeing army troops are resorting to a scorched earth
policy, blowing up bridges and buildings and destroying a
state-owned television station.
   Deputy Defense Minister Ranjan Wijeratne told reporters that
government forces were in full control of the east, a month after
new fighting broke out with the separatist Tamils.
   ``We are on top of the situation and have destroyed some of
their key strongholds in the east,'' Wijeratne said, though adding
that fighting in the north continues.
   In their retreat, the rebels are leaving little behind, he said:
``They are on the run and are resorting to a scorched earth policy,
destroying bridges, buildings, food stores.''
   Wijeratne said they had destroyed the TV station in Kokkavil in
the north and blew up a key bridge linking the Sri Lankan mainland
to Mannar island in the northwest.
   In other developments, the government denied charges that army
troops killed 50 Tamil civilians Tuesday in eastern Sri Lanka.
   The Tamil Eelam Liberation Organization on Wednesday accused the
army of killing 50 Tamil civilians in Kalmunai, an east coast town
where about 115 policemen were slain by Tamil rebels a month ago.
   ``I am categorically denying a report that troops had lined up
and shot 50 Tamil civilians in Kalmunai,'' said Gen. Cyril
Ranatunge, the defense secretary. ``We don't do that kind of
thing.''
   Wijeratne described the fighting in the rebel-dominated northern
Jaffna peninsula as a see-saw battle between the rebels and the
army: ``They throw a few rockets at us, and we throw a few at
them.''
   Jaffna has been cut off from the rest of the country since the
ethnic war resumed June 11. The peninsula has been the scene of
some of the worst fighting. The rebels control most of the area
except for an army camp in Jaffna town, a naval base and a military
airfield.
   The Tamil rebels broke a 13-month-old cease-fire last month,
renewing a 7-year-old war for independence for the predominantly
Tamil north and east from Sinhalese-dominated Sri Lanka.
   Tamils make up 18 percent of the island's 16 million people and
have long accused the Sinhalese majority of discrimination. The
Sinhalese, who account for about 74 percent of the people, control
the government and the military.
   The Tamil ethnic war has claimed more than 13,000 lives.

   Former tennis great Margaret Court says
Martina Navratilova is a poor role model for young players because
she is a lesbian.
   Court, who won 25 Grand Slam events, said Wednesday in newspaper
and radio interviews that Navratilova's homosexuality is a bad
example.
   ``She is a great player, but I'd like to see somebody at the top
to whom the younger players can look up to,'' said Court, 47, a
born-again Christian who lives in Perth. ``It is very sad for
children to be exposed to it.''
   Peter Johnson, a spokesman for Navratilova, said she had no
comment.
   Navratilova won her first Wimbledon singles title in 1978 and a
record ninth when she defeated Zina Garrison on Saturday.
   ``Winning Wimbledon a record nine times qualifies you as a role
model,'' said Karin Schwartz of the Gay and Lesbian Alliance
Against Defamation in New York. She called Court's comments
``totally ridiculous.''
   `Underlying her statements is a complete ignorance of
homosexuality,'' Schwartz said. ``You don't catch it.''

   The executive director of the abortion clinic
that lost a landmark U.S. Supreme Court decision last year has been
holding talks quietly with the lawyer who wrote the law that
restricted access to abortion.
   B.J. Isaacson-Jones of Reproductive Health Services and Andrew
Puzder, a longtime leader in Missouri's anti-abortion movement,
have discussed over the past eight months letting an anti-abortion
counselor work at the clinic.
   They met Wednesday with leaders from both sides of the abortion
debate to get reaction to the idea and determine what to do next.
   The meeting sought to explore and answer questions about the
counselor idea, such as who would pay the counselor, which patients
would be counseled and what kind of counseling would be provided.
   The two agreed to examine the need for better foster care and
for better help for handicapped and hard-to-place children, as well
as the idea of putting an anti-abortion counselor in the
Reproductive Health clinic.
   But they said the fact that they found some common ground
shouldn't be viewed as a victory for either side, Puzder said.
   ``If anything, our talks are a victory for women and children,''
he said.
   News of the meetings about the counselor idea was disclosed this
week. Before then, it was difficult to imagine the two talking to
one another.
   Puzder, a St. Louis lawyer, represented people who sat-in at
abortion clinics in the 1970s and '80s. He drafted the restrictive
abortion law at the center of last year's landmark Webster vs.
Reproductive Health Services Supreme Court decision, which gave
states more power to restrict a woman's right to abortion.
   Isaacson-Jones has long defended a woman's right to have an
abortion. Her clinic performs nearly half the 18,000 abortions each
year in Missouri and sees women from 10 states.
   ``This could be a very good idea or it could die tomorrow,''
Puzder said. ``What B.J. and I are doing can be killed very easily.
We are dealing with very delicate politics.''
   Both said it was surprisingly easy to get together and talk.
   ``I was very nervous when I called him, but after we talked I
was encouraged and excited,'' said Isaacson-Jones, who contacted
Puzder after a newspaper column he wrote about the need to help
women and children.
   Puzder said he was glad she called.
   ``The first thing we did was say, `I know that I'm not going to
convince you to become pro-life, and you know that you can't
convince me to become pro-choice,''' he said. ``We got that out of
the way and were able to talk.''

<TEXT>
   A mysterious, diamond-shaped insect
whose bite can kill within four hours has claimed the lives of at
least 30 people and attacked hundreds of others in the past month,
doctors and newspapers said today.
   Panick-stricken villagers are destroying the bushy, fast-growing
plants that harbor the insects, which have 30 tiny stingers.
   This could create more problems because the ipomoea crassicarlis
plant's roots help check soil erosion in frequently flooded
Bangladesh. The plant usually grows up to 10 feet but has no food
value.
   A government-owned newspaper, Dainik Bangla, said the insect
that feeds on the plant's leaves has killed at least 30 people
across the country. Many of the victims were children who played in
the bushes.
   Dozens of the bugs swarm into each plant.
   Doctors at Dhaka Medical College Hospital said they treated more
than two dozen people who said they had been bitten by the insect.
   ``A victim may die within four hours of the attack if not
properly treated,'' Dr. Mostafa Jalal Mohiuddin said.
   Survivors have responded to injections of oradixon, followed by
three days of antihistamine tablets, doctors at the hospital said.
   Scientists in the government's Agriculture Department are trying
to determine the insects' species and origin. Newspapers have
suggested it arrived from Africa via India.
   The Health Ministry has urged the people not to panic and report
to hospitals if they are bitten. The warnings are being broadcast
by state-owned radio and television.

   Soviet grandmaster Vassily Ivanchuk
defeated compatriot Alexander Khalifman today and took over sole
leadership of the Manila Interzonal chess tournament.
   Ivanchuk forced Khalifman to resign after 44 moves of a Pirc
Defense, giving him 8{ points and the lead after the 12th round.
The 13th and last round of the tourney will be played Saturday
after a rest day Friday.
   Boris Gelfand, the top favorite, agreed to a draw with fellow
Soviet Leonid Yudasin. He was tied with Indian chess sensation
Anand Viswanathan for second place with eight points. Viswanathan
forced Soviet grandmaster Mikhail Gurevich to resign in 38 moves of
a French Defense game.
   Viswanathan, playing the black pieces, managed to overcome
Gurevich's slight lead playing with the white by an early exchange
of queens.
   Gurevich, an 11th round co-leader with Ivanchuk and Gelfand,
quit after Anand threatened to promote a pawn to a queen in two
moves.

<TEXT>
   A major critic of President Daniel arap
Moi who took refuge in the U.S. Embassy during four days of violent
anti-government protests has left Kenya for London, the U.S.
ambassador said.
   Gibson Kamau Kuria, an Oxford-educated human rights lawyer, was
allowed to leave the country Wednesday night, U.S. Ambassador Smith
Hempston said.
   The sheltering of Kuria in the U.S. Embassy heightened tensions
between Washington and Nariobi, already bristling over U.S.
suggestions that the one-party state allow competing political
parties.
   Kenya has long been considered one of Africa's most stable and
successful nations. But since early this year, Moi has come under
increasing pressure to allow a multiparty system.
   Kenya, an East African nation of 23 million, was calm on
Wednesday.
   But four days of violent clashes between stone-throwing mobs and
heavily armed riot police left 28 people dead, according to the
English-language Daily Nation newspaper. The government says 20
died in the rioting, which began Saturday when the government tried
to stop a pro-democracy rally.
   Dozens of people were injured by gunfire and beatings and 1,040
were charged in courts with looting and rioting, the paper said.
   The U.S. State Department on Tuesday advised Americans against
all but essential travel to Kenya because of the unrest.
   It was not immediately clear what sort of negotiations took
place to secure the release of Kuria, who sought refuge at the
embassy on Saturday after a wave of government arrests in which
about 11 top opposition figures were detained.
   ``Kuria left the U.S. Embassy and Kenya at 7:45 p.m. Wednesday
night aboard a regularly scheduled airline. His immediate
destination was London. I am personally grateful to the government
of Kenya for permitting his departure and to the government of the
United Kingdom for admitting him to Britain. Any further
information regarding his departure will have to come from (the
government of) Kenya,'' Hempstone said.
   Kuria, 43, won the Robert F. Kennedy human rights award in 1988.
The award citation praised him as ``one of the few lawyers in Kenya
who defends political prisoners.'' It says those who do ``fear
government harassment, or worse.''
   Kenya condemned the U.S. decision to give Kuria asylum. Kenya
also accused Washington of fueling the pro-democracy movement.
   The Bush administration protested the charge in a meeting
between Herman Cohen, assistant secretary for African affairs, and
Kenya's ambassador in Washington, Denis Afande.
   Clashes between riot police and angry crowds began Saturday,
following the arrests of opposition leaders and police used tear
gas and guns to disperse demonstrators in Kenya's capital. By
Monday, rioting spread to outlying cities and rural areas. Moi
blamed the violence on ``hooligans and drug addicts.''

   Richard B. Bernstein, a professor of
chemistry at UCLA whose work in molecular chemistry earned him a
National Medical of Science award, has died. He was 66.
   Bernstein died in Helsinki, Finland, on Sunday after suffering a
heart attack. He was attending a conference of Soviet and American
scientists.
   Bernstein joined the faculty of the University of California,
Los Angeles, in 1983 and pioneered research of interactions between
molecules.
   His work in molecular beam scattering earned him the National
Medal of Science in 1989, and he received the prestigious Robert A.
Welch Award in Chemistry in 1988.
   With Ahmed H. Zewail of the California Institute of Technology,
Bernstein developed ``femto'' chemistry, which employs lasers to
observe the birth of molecules almost as they happen.
   A member of the National Academy of Sciences, Bernstein
initiated the academy's first study of the impact of
chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, on the Earth's ozone layer.
   Prior to joining UCLA, Bernstein was chairman of the chemistry
department at Columbia University in New York.
   As an undergraduate at Columbia, he became a member of the
Manhattan Project, the United States' secret effort to develop the
atomic bomb during World War II. He received his doctorate at
Columbia in 1948.
   Bernstein also taught at the University of Texas, the University
of Wisconsin and the University of Michigan, and served as a senior
vice president of Occidental Research Corp. in Irvine.
   Bernstein is survived by his wife, Norma; a son, three
daughters, a brother and four grandchildren.

<HEAD>Liberian Peace Talks Resume</HEAD>

<DATELINE>FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Delegations representing the
Liberian rebels and the government of President Samuel Doe sat down
with mediators today to discuss a possible peace agreement in the
country's civil war.
   But before the talks began, rebel delegate Thomas Woewiyu held
out little hope there was anything to negotiate.
   ``We have not come to discuss a cease-fire,'' he said after
disembarking from the trawler Treesie, which had made the 30-hour
voyage from the rebel-held port of Buchanan in neighboring Liberia.
   Woewiyu said the Economic Community of West African States,
which was mediating the peace talks, was ``a very powerful
institution and we have an obligation to come and hear what they
have to say and then we shall react.''
   The mediation group, which includes the region's military giant,
Nigeria, reportedly has proposed introducing a peacekeeping force
in Liberia, pending new elections. The rebels, who believe they are
close to capturing the Liberian capital of Monrovia, have
criticized the proposal.
   ``What we have in Monrovia is a man holding on to a city as
hostage and we are not here to negotiate for hostage holding,''
Woewiyu said. ``As long as Doe is in Monrovia, there can be no talk
about cease-fire.''
   Doe's delegation to the talks was led by Tambakai Dangaba, who
has been waiting in Freetown for Woewiyu to return since earlier
peace talks collapsed last month. Dangaba refused to talk to
reporters. Gambia, Nigeria, Ghana, Togo, Guinea and Sierra Leone
also were represented at the talks.
   The rebels, led by Charles Taylor, have been advancing on the
capital, Monrovia, since December. The insurgents accuse his
government of corruption, tribalism and suppression of opposition.
Taylor supports capitalism, but Washington and other governments
have questioned his commitment to democracy.
   On Wednesday, two captured coast guard vessels flying the
scarlet rebel flag fired on Monrovia's port before being driven off
by rocket and machine-gun fire. A cannon installed at Doe's
fortified cliff-top executive mansion about a mile from the port
fired two rounds at the rebels and missed.
   Doe's army has been flying men and equipment up to Grand Gedeh
County, his native region. Liberians close to Doe, speaking on
condition of anonymity, say if forced to leave Monrovia, Doe may
prefer to go there than leave the country.
   Heavy firing broke out in northern and eastern suburbs of
Monrovia Tuesday afternoon and evening, rattling house windows in
the center of town.
   The army fired about 10 rockets from a Soviet-designed BM-21
multiple rocket launcher at a large rebel force in the eastern
suburb of Paynesville on Tuesday, witnesses said.
   The atmosphere in the Liberian capital remained tense. Residents
are weary of food, water and electricity shortages, the curfew, and
the nightly gunfire.
   Of Liberia's 2 million people, about 400,000 live in the capital.
   Monrovians also were frightened by tribal reprisal killings by
the army. Decomposing bodies of victims were seen around Monrovia.
Another corpse washed up overnight on the beach below the Italian
Embassy.
   The rebels also reportedly have slain civilians in tribal
revenge killings.
   Doe took power in a 1980 coup that ousted elitist descendants of
American slaves who founded Liberia in 1847.

<HEAD>High Court Denies George Hamilton's Bid To Keep Marcos Testimony
Sealed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LOUINN LOTA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. Supreme Court justice has denied actor
George Hamilton's bid to keep his sworn testimony sealed in the
government's case against Imelda Marcos and her late husband,
Ferdinand.
   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who handles emergency appeals to
the high court from California, denied the request Wednesday. Her
action upheld a ruling Tuesday by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals in San Francisco.
   The appellate court ruled in favor of the Los Angeles Times,
which sought access to papers concerning Hamilton in U.S. District
Court in Los Angeles. The 2-1 appellate ruling says:
   ``The risk that harm or injury will befall Mr. Hamilton as a
result of the release of these documents is no greater than the
risk that all public figures are subject to daily by virtue of the
fact that their activities may become the subject of favorable or
unfavorable mention in the news media.
   ``That is a risk that Mr. Hamilton, as a sometime motion picture
and television actor as well as a noted man about town, is in any
event subject to at all times.''
   The ruling was written by Judges Dorothy W. Nelson and Stephen
Reinhardt, said federal Deputy Clerk Ernie Cruz in San Francisco.
   Hamilton was out of the country and unavailable for comment,
said a secretary for his publicist, Jeffrey Lane, who also was out
of his office.
   A message left with Hamilton's attorney after hours was not
returned.
   Hamilton was among 61 unindicted co-conspirators named in a
federal case bought against the Marcoses in New York. On July 2,
Imelda Marcos was acquitted of the fraud and racketeering charges,
which alleged she helped loot her country of $168 million.
Ferdinand Marcos, who was indicted with his wife in 1988, died in
exile in Hawaii last fall.
   An unindicted co-conspirator may have done something to advance
an alleged criminal conspiracy without necessarily knowing he or
she was doing it.
   In 1981, Hamilton bought a Beverly Hills estate once owned by
Charlie Chaplin for $1.2 million.
   He obtained a five year loan, based on the property's increased
value, in late 1983 from Calno Holdings N.V. in the Netherlands
Antilles, which reportedly was tied to the Marcoses.
   Mrs. Marcos met Hamilton at a Manila festival in 1982. He
entertained her at his Beverly Hills home, shopped with the
Philippines first lady and escorted her to parties.
   In 1986, after the Marcoses fled Manila, Hamilton said Mrs.
Marcos had no financial interest in his home.

<HEAD>Government Orders Extradition of Soviet Hijacker</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sweden today ordered the extradition of
a 17-year-old Soviet who hijacked a domestic flight from the Soviet
Union by threatening the pilot with what turned out to be a fake
hand grenade.
   Dimitry Semionov is believed to the first person ordered
extradited from Sweden to the Soviet Union since the end of World
War II.
   ``It's a signal to would-be hijackers,'' said acting Prime
Minister Lena Hjelm-Wallen.
   ``The government considered the boy's age and possible
extenuating circumstances. But since the crime is very serious we
decided that we can make no exceptions,'' she said.
   Semionov hijacked the aircraft on June 9 with 114 passengers and
seven crew aboard, saying he wanted to leave his home in
Byelorussia after a quarrel with his father.
   Semionov was the first of five Soviet youths to hijack Soviet
domestic airliners to Sweden or Finland since June 9. All of the
hijackers falsely claimed to be carrying explosives and all
surrendered peacefully.
   Swedish airline pilots and police have urged the quick approval
of Soviet requests for extraditions, saying delays would encourage
more hijackings.
   Semionov told Swedish news media Wednesday he would commit
suicide if he were sent home to face hijacking charges. He said he
faces five years in jail and 10 years of banishment from major
cities in the Soviet Union if convicted.
   Prisons official Lisbet Lindberg said extra guards were placed
on Semionov, who was being held in Kronoberg jail.
   Government spokesman Lars Danielsson said the youth would be
extradited as soon as Soviet authorities are prepared.
   Also today, Helsinki's flight control center said a hijacked
Soviet airliner approached Finnish air space but turned back to
Leningrad, apparently after a hijacking attempt was foiled. No
further details were available about the plane, which had been on a
domestic flight from Leningrad to the northern city of Murmansk. On
Tuesday, the flight control center said a hijacked Soviet plane
headed toward Finland but changed course and returned to Leningrad.

<HEAD>Soviet Coal Miners End One-Day Strike</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tens of thousands of coal miners returned to work
today following a one-day strike to press demands that the
Communist Party to get out of their lives and the Soviet government
resign.
   According to strike organizers, workers were back on the job in
the Ukraine's Don River coal basin, the Kuznets Basin of Western
Siberia and Vorkuta in the Far North.
   ``All of the miners are working,'' said Nikolai Volynko, a
strike organizer in Donetsk, the center of the Ukrainian mining
region.
   Miners' spokesmen in the other regions, contacted by telephone,
said that mining operations were back to normal.
   Miners staged the 24-hour walkout despite appeals from the
Soviet government and party.
   In Donetsk, a rally passed a resolution Wednesday demanding that
the government of Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov resign, that
party cells be removed from mines, economic enterprises, the KGB,
army and police, and that party property be nationalized.
   ``We should kick the party not only out of the Ukraine, but
everywhere,'' declared mine construction worker Viktor Kitenko,
speaking at the rally.
   No figures were available on the number of miners who actually
walked off their jobs. But judging from the number of mines on
strike in the Donetsk region, it appeared that about 100,000 miners
stayed away. Strike organizers claimed that about 300,000 miners
took part in western Siberia.
   Ryzhkov today told the Communist Party's 28th Congress meeting
in Moscow that 276 enterprises and 655 branches took part in the
strike.
   He said workers at 230 mines stayed off the job all day, and
elsewhere, the walkout lasted from two to 12 hours.
   ``In light of what happened yesterday, we must quickly work out
conclusions,'' he said.
   The job action was a repetition of a long and bitter strike coal
miners conducted last summer to press the Soviet government for
better supplies of basic consumer goods, better pay and working
conditions. The government acceded to their demands, but has been
unable to fulfill its promises.
   Mikhail Shchadov, minister of the coal mining industry, said in
a newspaper interview Wednesday that the government was trying to
give mines more independence, improve housing, vacations and
construction of schools.
   But he acknowledged shortages in the Soviet economy, and said
that a lack of timber to properly construct mine shafts had led to
some deaths underground.

<HEAD>Khmer Rouge Claims Cambodian Defense Minister Arrested in Vietnam</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Khmer Rouge guerrilla radio said today
that Cambodia's defense minister has been arrested and is under
guard in a Vietnamese hospital.
   The report, which was monitored in Bangkok, could not be
independently confirmed. Khmer Rouge radio reports cannot always be
considered reliable sources of information.
   Roland Eng, spokesman for the guerrilla faction loyal to Prince
Norodom Sihanouk, said Defense Minister Tie Banh had been arrested,
but details were sketchy. Sihanouk leads the three-faction rebel
coalition.
   Last month Asia Watch, a U.S. human rights group, said Cambodian
authorities in May arrested at least six senior government
officials and army officers for trying to form a rival political
party. Tie Banh's name was not mentioned in those reports.
   Cambodia's one-party Communist administration was installed
after a Vietnamese invasion of the country in late 1978. It
continues to fight the three guerrilla groups backed by China and
other countries.
   The Khmer Rouge radio report said Tie Banh had not been seen in
Phnom Penh, the Cambodian capital, for a month and reportedly was
flown to Vietnam under armed guard on the pretext he had a heart
disorder.
   Tie Banh was not arrested in Phnom Penh because it might
undermine Premier Hun Sen's government, the radio said. Instead, he
was flown to Vietnam from central Kompong Thom after he was ordered
there in mid-June.
   ``Tie Banh is being hospitalized in Ho Chi Minh City under the
heavy guard of Vietnamese soldiers,'' the radio said.
   The radio said the reason for the arrest was personal. It
mentioned family corruption and conflict between Tie Banh and the
Vietnamese over how to conduct the war in Cambodia.
   Commanders loyal to Sihanouk in Kompong Thom province said last
week they had intelligence reports of Tie Banh's arrest.
   Government forces have recently been involved in heavy fighting
with the three guerrilla factions and by many accounts have
suffered major setbacks.

   A hailstorm pelted the Denver area, shattering
windows, stripping leaves from trees and bruising about four dozen
amusement park patrons stranded on rides by a power failure.
   Aaron and Sarah Creer were riding a Ferris wheel at Elitch's
Gardens amusement park in northwest Denver when the hailstorm hit
Wednesday.
   ``I was just praying,'' said Aaron, 15. He said he wrapped his
arms around his sister, 9, to protect her head and her glasses from
the pounding ice.
   Patrons at the amusement park received mostly bumps, bruises,
welts and cuts. Forty-seven of those injured were taken to
hospitals but most were treated and released, said Tom Cribley,
Denver paramedic supervisor.
   The hail splintered auto and building windows and dented
vehicles. The hailstorms also flattened gardens and stripped trees
of leaves, turning residential streets into paths of green.
   The University of Denver reported about 750 windows broken,
mostly on the north sides of buildings, the direction from which
the storm came.
   The storm developed north of Denver, near Estes Park, and moved
south.
   In Arvada, where the strongest effects of the storm were felt,
police Sgt. Merle Westling said the hail even stripped the bark off
trees.
   It fell ``in solid sheets,'' Westling said. ``You couldn't see a
thing.''
   A 26-year-old woman was killed near Golden in a traffic accident
that was blamed on a wet, slippery road. Golden police spokesman
Dave Farley said the woman was a passenger in a car that spun out
of control and hit a tree.

   Fire inspectors today were investigating
the cause of a blaze that destroyed part of an abortion clinic.
   The fire erupted late Wednesday at the Feminist Women's Health
Center and gutted one end of the clinic building before it was
brought under control.
   Neighbors reported seeing someone near the clinic shortly before
the fire broke out, said police Sgt. Dave Mundy.
   No one was injured in the blaze. Authorities could not
immediately estimate the damages but said the medical offices where
abortions are performed were destroyed. The administrative offices
received smoke damage.
   A fire also damaged the clinic in September. Investigators found
no evidence of arson.
   Meanwhile, the trial of 19 Operation Rescue anti-abortion
activists opened Monday in a packed courtroom but was delayed when
the prosecutor became ill. The activists face charges of
trespassing at the clinic during an anti-abortion blockade three
months ago.
   The case is the second such prosecution involving protests at
the clinic in rugged Shasta County about 260 miles northeast of San
Francisco.

   From the surprise visitor at Republican Party
headquarters came a not-so-surprising message.
   Republicans ``always do better when we're on the offensive,''
party Chairman Lee Atwater told his audience. ``Get back on the
offensive.''
   It was simple but welcome advice from a man whose trusted
political instincts have been sorely missed by the party, which
convenes for its midyear meeting today in Chicago. Infighting over
taxes has exposed cracks in the GOP's fabled unity and Democrats
have gotten more aggressive about taking on the Republicans.
   For the past four months, however, Atwater has been missing from
the party's day-to-day operation, battling a life-threatening brain
tmor. Aides say his condition has improved, but Atwater was
readmitted to George Washington University Hospital on Wednesday
for testing.
   Atwater was hospitalized overnight for routine testing,
according to his press secretary, Leslie Goodman. ``This is nothing
out of the ordinary. Everything is great,'' she said. ``There is a
consensus among his doctors that the tumor is not growing.''
   When Atwater was elected GOP chairman 18 months ago, Bush said,
``He will be my political eyes and ears.'' With that, the president
effectively moved the White House political operation across town
to the Republican National Committee.
   Atwater stays in daily touch with his office and the White
House, and keeps tabs on major campaigns by tapping his extensive
network of GOP contacts across the country. He spent much of Monday
participating in conference calls with RNC members preparing for
the Chicago meeting.
   ``He's in the loop on all the big decisions and strategy
sessions but he's just not able to work full time,'' said GOP
consultant Charles Black, who has been helping top Atwater deputy
Mary Matalin run the RNC in Atwater's absence.
   But Atwater, 39, has been to the White House just once and to
his office only once since he collapsed at a political breakfast in
March. Known for his energy and zeal, Atwater now tires easily
because of his exhausting medical treatment.
   He gets most of his information over the phone, from meetings at
his house or during drives with aides and GOP political operatives.
   It was during a drive two weeks ago with Ed Rogers, a top White
House political aide, that Atwater decided to make a surprise visit
to his office. He whisked his wheelchair in for a 45-minute
strategy session with Matalin, Rogers and others.
   Frustrated with White House handling of Bush's decision to back
away from his ``no new taxes'' pledge and with Democratic attacks
on GOP involvement in the savings and loan crisis, Atwater told
those at the meeting that Republicans needed to be more aggressive.
   ``Get back on the offensive,'' one participant quoted Atwater as
saying. That also was the theme recently of one of his frequent
memos to White House Chief of Staff John Sununu.
   Few believe Atwater could have convinced Bush to hold firm on
taxes, but many within the party think he would have handled the
sensitive switch more deftly than did the White House. Bush was
kept away from reporters for two days after the tax announcement
took most Republicans by surprise and undermined GOP candidates
running on ``no new taxes'' planks.
   ``Lee would not have sent the president into a bunker for two
days,'' said an Atwater loyalist who asked not to be identified.
``It gave the impression they were trying to hide from the
decision.''
   Black said Atwater had put a 1990 plan in place that has allowed
others to run the party in his absence with little disruption.
Where Atwater is most missed, Black and others said, is in the
party's relations with the press and on the fund-raising circuit.
   ``Everyone had come to learn to look to Lee; he was the voice of
the party,'' said Matalin.
   Should his recovery allow it, the decision on whether to return
to work full time will be Atwater's, according to party officials.
   His doctors believe they have stopped the tumor's growth but it
could be months before they know whether aggressive radiation
treatment has killed the tumor.
   Atwater will have to decide by the party's January meeting
whether to seek a second two-year term.

   Leaders of the world's seven richest democracies
struck agreements to help the Soviet Union, reduce farm supports,
and stem the pollution which causes global warming. Or did they?
   Wednesday's final declaration of the three-day economic summit
contains all these promises, and more. But, as usual, the document
was heavy on the manana tactic long invoked by allies who have
sharp differences but want harmony in their parting anthems.
   Consider this:
   With three of the seven nations _ the United States, Britain and
Japan _ vehemently opposed to direct financial aid for the Soviets,
the leaders decided to send a team of experts to study the
Kremlin's economic needs and report by the end of the year.
   And what then?
   Asked whether the United States would help President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev if the study recommends giving him cash, Bush replied,
``Not necessarily. But ... maybe this will lead to support.''
   In deference to Bush and British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher, the summit set conditions for any coordinated direct aid
program _ reductions in military spending and support for client
states like Cuba.
   French President Francois Mitterrand, chafing along with Italy
and West Germany about the refusal to provide direct aid, said with
typical Gallic fatalism that the six-month deadline was ``the best
we could hope for.'' He also dismissed the pre-conditions as
``negligible.''
   Mitterrand also said the study was a good idea because it was
better to fully understand Soviet needs before the West does extend
cash assistance. That may be, but it hasn't stopped West Germany or
Canada, which have already promised the Soviets loans and credits
worth more than $5 million.
   Another agreement trumpeted by the leaders was compromise
language designed to resolve a fight between the United State and
the Europeans over farm subsidies.
   Bush had sought their elimination. The Europeans balked, willing
only to reduce some of the supports and warning that cutting off
the supports could cost up to 3 million farmers their livelihood.
   Each side got a little of what it wanted, but no one was fooled
into thinking the problem was solved. And the real test will only
begin when negotiators meet in Geneva at the end of the month to
try to translate the communique language into action before the
Dec. 31 deadline for completion of a global trade agreement.
   ``I'm not under any illusions that we'll be dealing with a new
era by Christmas or even by next spring,'' was the assessment by
Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney.
   The summit communique was particularly non-committal on the
question of how to deal with global warming. The leaders agreed it
was a pressing problem and that the emissions believed responsible
for the problem should be limited.
   But they declined to set limits _ basically because the Bush
administration opposed the Europeans' demand _ and deferred all
significant action until after a convention on climate change is
reached in 1992.
   Reporters' suggestions of procrastination on Soviet aid, farm
subsidies and the environment, drew irate reaction from the leaders
at their windup news conferences.
   ``It's not an effort to delay anything,'' said Bush in response
to a question about the study of Soviet economic needs.
   Margaret Thatcher suggested another interpretation.
   ``The greatest achievement of the summit has been to make it
easier for all of us to reject short-term soft options in favor of
longer-term solutions,'' she said.
   And what looks like procrastination to some, has some distinct
advantages for Bush.
   By leaving wiggle room on questions like aid to the Soviet Union
and China, Bush has space to maneuver with Congress _ and likely a
better chance to fulfill his own foreign policy objectives.
   Lawmakers have made clear they wouldn't support money for
Gorbachev, both for ideological reasons and because of a gaping
budget deficit. They have also lashed out at any hint that Bush is
trying to ease sanctions against China, imposed last year as
punishment for its repression of pro-democracy reforms.
   But Bush has said he doesn't want China isolated, and is
probably privately pleased with the policy evolving out of Japan
where Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu has decided to resume a $5.2
billion lending program to Beijing. Bush and the others said they
wouldn't stand in the way.
   And West Germany, whose pockets are full and constituents are
eager, is well positioned to help Gorbachev where Bush can't.

<HEAD>Apes Make Courtroom Appearance in Entertainer's Defamation Trial</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Monkey business was the order of the day, much
to the dismay of defense attorneys in a state judge's courtroom.
   Four orangutans used by entertainer Bobby Berosini in his
Stardust Hotel act were bought into the courtroom Wednesday and
shown to jurors as Berosini's lawsuit against People for the
Ethical Treatment of Animals opened in District Court.
   Berosini claims PETA defamed him by secretly filming him
allegedly beating the orangutans backstage at his show last year,
then releasing the tape to the media.
   Jurors smiled and others in the crowded courtroom laughed as
Berosini ran his charges through their motions, calling each
orangutan to a podium to lift their arms and display themselves to
the panel.
   But attorneys for the defendants were not as happy, claiming the
appearance biased jurors by portraying the orangutans and Berosini
as one big happy family.
   ``It was a complete zoo,'' defense attorney Daniel Foley
protested to Judge Myron Leavitt. ``This was nothing but a big show
for the jury.''
   ``It does show that they are powerful animals but I think the
jury has a right to see that too,'' Leavitt said. ``The jury has a
right to see what kind of animals they are.''
   A trio of defense attorneys took turns asking first for a
mistrial, then for Leavitt to disqualify himself as the two sides
opened what is expected to be a two-week trial.
   PETA attorney Phil Hirschkop claimed Leavitt was biased against
the organization and should disqualify himself because he is a
close friend of the operator of the Stardust Hotel, which is not a
plaintiff, and took a $25,000 campaign contribution from the resort.
   ``I know we can't get a fair trial,'' Hirschkop said. ``We have
no chance of winning in this courtroom.''
   Leavitt refused to disqualify himself.
   ``I have no personal bias or prejudice for or against any
parties in this case,'' the judge said.
   The appearance by the orangutans came after jurors were taken
backstage at the Stardust to view the area where the secret
videotape was made last summer.
   The videotape shows Berosini apparently striking some of the
orangutans with what PETA officials claimed was a metal rod.
   Berosini denied abusing the animals and claims PETA ruined his
career by releasing the videotape. He later was cleared by federal
officials of any wrongdoing involving the orangutans.
   Stardust officials later said they would close the show next
year after a more than three decade run, but denied it was because
of the controversy.

   Two ships were cruising toward Albania today to pick
up thousands of asylum-seekers who took refuge in foreign embassies
there.
   In order to prevent a mass exodus from the Communist nation,
officials gave few details about the operation.
   An Italian Foreign Ministry spokesman said Wednesday that the
Albanian authorities ``reserved for themselves the right to decide
at the last minute'' when they will allow the ships into port.
   Early release of details on the boatlift could cause other
Albanians to rush to get on board, and ``it would be a thing of
biblical proportions,'' the spokesman said on condition of
anonymity.
   An Italian-chartered ferry left Wednesday for Albania to carry
away many of the estimated 4,000 people who clambered over embassy
fences in the capital of Tirana to escape Europe's last hard-line
Communist nation.
   The Orient Star, a Maltese boat chartered by France, set sail
early today from the Greek port of Patras for Durres, Greek port
authority spokesman Frangiscos Vomviras said.
   A third ship was also expected to sail today from southern Italy.
   People began seeking refuge in the embassies June 28, some
braving police gunfire. Albania agreed to let them leave after
conditions worsened at the compounds. Supplies of food and medicine
are strained and hygienic conditions poor.
   The first group of 51 people to leave the country flew to
Czechoslovakia on Monday.
   Albania has resisted the democratic reforms that swept the rest
of Eastern Europe last year. Despite limited restructuring this
year by Communist leader Ramiz Alia, Albania remains Europe's most
backward and isolated nation.
   Trying to stem popular discontent, the government in the past
week has replaced high-ranking officials, including several
hard-liners associated with the late Communist ruler Enver Hoxha.
   On Wednesday, more reform was announced.
   The state news agency ATA said the government would allow some
privatization of handicrafts and small trade. But entrepreneurs
could not employ non-family members and had to register with the
authorities.
   As part of the boatlift, the Italian-chartered ship Appia left
Venice on Wednesday, carrying nine nurses and three doctors from
the Red Cross, said Lino De Rosa, a director of the company that
owns the ships.
   The French-chartered ship was carrying 44 French officials,
doctors and 3{ tons of medical supplies and food, said Vomviras. It
was to arrive off Durres later today then return with the refugees
to the French port of Marseille.
   Another vessel, the Espresso Grecia, was to leave from the
southern Italian city of Brindisi later today, De Rosa said.
   The ships were to wait in Durres harbor until the Albanians
decide to let them dock, late today or early Friday, Foreign
Ministry officials said.
   New arrivals at the embassies have dropped off dramatically
since police placed a cordon around the embassy quarter this week,
diplomats said.
   Many of the asylum-seekers in Tirana have said they eventually
want to emigrate to the United States, which does not have
diplomatic relations with Albania.
   In Washington, State Department deputy spokesman Richard Boucher
said the United States has no specific quota for Albanian refugees
but has a ceiling of 6,500 on refugees from Eastern Europe. So far
this year, 52 Albanian refugees have resettled in the United
States, Boucher said.

   The Communist Party's new No. 2 leader pledged
today to push society rapidly forward, but acknowledged that some
hasty moves in the past have hurt the party and the people.
   In his first meeting with reporters after being elected deputy
to Mikhail S. Gorbachev, Vladimir A. Ivashko showed himself to be a
loyal and emphatic supporter of the Soviet leader's policies.
   Endorsed by Gorbachev, the 58-year-old Ivashko soundly defeated
party traditionalist Yegor K. Ligachev on Wednesday for the newly
created post of deputy secretary general.
   He said he only learned Tuesday he was Gorbachev's choice for
deputy and has not yet had a chance to map out his exact
responsibilities with the Soviet leader. The deputy secretary
general is responsible for the day-to-day affairs of the party.
   ``I am for moving forward fast,'' Ivashko said at his first news
conference. ``I see no other option. There is no way back.''
   He said he would try to avoid a split in the party ranks by
trying to find room for people with widely varying points of view.
   But Ivashko also said the party had to avoid repeating the many
mistakes it made in the first years of Gorbachev's rule.
   ``I am against ill-conceived leaps _ forward, backwards,
sideways,'' he said. ``Perestroika proves that we have made many
erroneous decisions, quickly designed to solve all problems.''
Perestroika is Gorbachev's policy of economic and social
restructuring.
   He said the 1985 drive against alcoholism, Gorbachev's first
large-scale reform effort, caused ``huge moral and financial
damage, and damage to the health of the people.'' The national
treasury lost billions in alcohol sales and the campaign encouraged
moonshiners whose low-quality brew killed and injured many people.
   Ivashko, an economist and engineer, also said the Soviet
government should not have agreed to the demands of striking coal
miners last year that it knew it could not fulfill.
   The miners' anger has since become more political, and on
Wednesday hundreds of thousands of miners struck for one day to
demand the resignation of the government, the nationalization of
Communist Party property, and the removal of party organizations
from mines, offices, the KGB, the army and the police.
   In the Donetsk coal fields of the eastern Ukraine, striking
miners cheered Wednesday when they heard that Ivashko might be
heading to Moscow.
   ``Ligachev and Ivashko are from the same regime. There's no way
we can support him,'' Yuri Makarov, a Donetsk strike organizer,
told a news conference.
   On Wednesday, before his election to the party post, Ivashko
submitted his resignation as the Ukraine's president in a dispute
with the republic's parliament.
   Miners in the Ukraine's Donetsk Basin, the Soviet Union's
biggest coal-producing region, admit they don't know Ivashko well
because he had only been in the Ukrainian leadership since last
fall.
   Nevertheleass, they consider him part of the Communist Party and
government apparatus that has failed to improve their living and
working conditions.
   ``Have you been around to the stores?'' 34-year-old Anatoly
Berezhnikov, who has spent 13 years in the mines, asked a reporter
who sought his view of Ivashko. Without awaiting an answer, he
offered: ``They're empty.''
   A native of Poltava, Ivashko graduated from the Kharkov Mining
Institute and joined the Communist Party in 1960. He became a
candidate member of the party's Central Committee in 1986, shortly
after Gorbachev came to power.
   Ivashko was promoted to full, voting membership in April 1989,
when 110 mostly elderly conservatives were retired. Earlier that
year, top Communists picked Ivashko for one of the party's 100
guaranteed seats in the new Congress of People's Deputies.
   In December, Ivashko became a member of the Soviet Communist
Party's Politburo. He resigned the party leadership of the Ukraine
this spring after he was elected president of the republic.

<DATELINE>LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Arkansas attorney general has been
charged with billing more than $8,000 in personal entertainment
expenses to the state.
   Attorney General Steve Clark pleaded innocent to a charge of
theft by deception filed Wednesday. He withdrew as a Democratic
gubernatorial candidate in February after he was told his expense
reports were being investigated.
   ``My only statement is, I am innocent of the charge against me
and I do not to intend to resign,'' Clark said after a brief court
appearance.
   Clark, 43, was released on $2,500 bond. He is not seeking
re-election to the office he has held since 1979.
   Little Rock Municipal Judge Marion Humphrey ruled there was
probable cause to charge Clark. The ruling was based on a 55-page
affidavit submitted by Pulaski County Prosecutor Chris Piazza on
Tuesday.
   It included state police interviews with dozens of people listed
by Clark on his expense forms. Those people told police either they
didn't eat with Clark or didn't discuss state business.
   The charge against Clark carries a maximum penalty of five to 20
years in jail and a $15,000 fine.
   The affidavit listed 56 instances when Clark reportedly charged
the state for private meals. The state was billed at least
$8,448.27 for 86 inappropriate claims, according to the affidavit.
   Clark said in January the errors were made when he tried to
itemize his expenses months later. He blamed the discrepancies on
sloppy bookkeeping.
   The attorney general is not required by state law to itemize his
expense claims; Clark said he wanted to be more accountable.

   Armenian militants attacked a convoy of vehicles
in a disputed region of Azerbaijan, and three people were killed in
a gunfight between the militants and Soviet soldiers, the Tass news
agency reported today.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, informed of the attack while
presiding over the 28th Communist Party Congress in Moscow, told
delegates that ethnic bloodshed in the region must come to an end.
   Tass said the convoy of 16 trucks and a bus carrying Azerbaijani
passengers was attacked near the village of Charektar in
Nagorno-Karabakh, the mostly Christian Armenian enclave that is
located in and administered by Azerbaijan.
   It said heavily armed Armenian militants stopped the convoy,
guarded by five busloads of Interior Ministry troops, and fired
point-blank at the trucks and bus. The soldiers returned the fire,
Tass said.
   The news agency said two people died in the exchange of fire and
a woman passenger on the bus later died in a hospital of gunshot
wounds. The report did not say if the two people who died
immediatedly were militants or soldiers.
   The attackers fled, leaving behind six hand grenades, three
radio transmitters and explosives, Tass said.
   Gorbachev read out the report on the shootoout, then said that
Azerbaijani delegates to the congress were justified in their
demand that the Soviet leadership ``put a stop to the outrage of
unlawfulness and bloodshed.''
   He expressed condolences to the victims' families and called on
the leadership of Azerbaijan, which is mostly Moslem, and Armenia
to ``vigorously participate in the effort to normalize the
situation in the region.''
   However, Gorbachev rejected an Azerbaijani request to put the
issue of Nagorno-Karabakh up for debate by the Congress. ``There is
no need to debate it now,'' he said.
   At least 200 people have died in ethnic violence that has
wracked the two Caucasus Mountain republics of Armenia and
Azerbaijan for the past two years. The dispute is centered on
control of Nagorno-Karabakh.

government ``uppity'' and saying its economic policy was intended
to ``take over the whole of Europe.''
   In a magazine interview that provoked widespread demands for his
resignation, Trade and Industry Secretary Nicholas Ridley also
compared the European Community to Adolf Hitler.
   Mrs. Thatcher, speaking at a rowdy session in the House of
Commons this afternoon, said Ridley's remarks did not reflect
government policy nor her own views, but she rebuffed demands for
his dismissal.
   ``On reflection, I very much regret the remarks reported in The
Spectator and unreservedly withdraw them,'' Ridley said in a
one-sentence statement issued by his department in London.
   In Bonn, West Germany, Lutz Stavenhagen, a high-ranking aide to
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, said the attacks were ``scandalous.'' By
accusing Germany of seeking to dominate Europe, Lutz said, Ridley
``discredits the entire European Community.''
   Ridley was in Budapest today with a British trade mission.
   In the interview, Ridley condemned what he called the
``breath-taking arrogance'' of the European Community.
   ``I'm not against giving up sovereignty in principle, but not to
this lot. You might just as well give it to Adolf Hitler,
frankly,'' he told the Spectator magazine in an interview published
today.
   ``This rushed takeover by the Germans on the worst possible
basis, with the French behaving like poodles to the Germans, is
absolutely intolerable,'' Ridley was quoted as saying.
   The magazine's cover carried a cartoon of Ridley painting a
Hitler mustache on a portrait of West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
   Several members of the British and European parliaments demanded
this morning that Mrs. Thatcher remove Ridley from the Cabinet.
   ``I think the prime minister has no choice to but ask him to
resign,'' said Hugh Dykes, a Conservative Party member in the House
of Commons.
   ``Unless Mrs. Thatcher gets rid of him today, one can only take
it that she secretly endorses his attitude,'' said Gerald Kaufman,
the opposition Labor Party's spokesman on foreign affairs.
   In Strasbourg, France, leaders of the European Parliament's
180-strong Socialist group, the largest in the 518-seat body, sent
a letter to Thatcher demanding Ridley's resignation.
   In the interview, Ridley said the West German government's
support for European monetary union ``is all a German racket
designed to take over the whole of Europe. It has to be thwarted.
   Mrs. Thatcher and fellow Conservatives like Ridley have been
reluctant to go along with European Community moves toward full
political and economic integration, fearing a loss of control over
domestic policy.
   Following Ridley's remark about Hitler, Spectator editor Dominic
Lawson suggested Kohl was much less threatening. ``He's not going
to bomb us, after all,'' Lawson said.
   Ridley reportedly replied: ``I'm not sure I wouldn't rather have
... er ... the shelters and the chance to fight back, than simply
being taken over by ... economics. He'll soon be coming here and
trying to say that this is what we should do on the banking front
and this is what our taxes should be. I mean, he'll soon be trying
to take over everything.''
   Ridley was asked if his views were colored by the fact that, at
age 61, he could remember World War II.
   ``Jolly good thing too,'' Ridley was quoted as replying. ``About
time somebody said that. It was pretty nasty. Only two months ago I
was in Auschwitz, Poland. Next week I'm in Czechoslovakia. You ask
them what they think about the Second World War. It's useful to
remember.''
   Britain's historic role had been to play the balance of power in
Europe, Ridley said, ``and never has it been more necessary than
now, with Germany so uppity.''
   In his remarks Ridley criticized the 17 members of the European
Commission, which governs the European Community.
   ``Seventeen unelected reject politicians with no accountability
to anybody, who are not responsible for raising taxes, just
spending money, who are pandered to by a supine parliament which
also is not responsible for raising taxes, already behaving with an
arrogance I find breathtaking _ the idea that one says `OK, we'll
give this lot our sovereignty,' is unacceptable to me.''

<HEAD>Former Salvadoran Death Squad Member-Turned-Informer Arrested</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONG BEACH, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Immigration officials have arrested a
man seeking political asylum as an informer on the death squads
linked to the murders of six Jesuit priests in El Salvador.
   Cesar Vielman Joya Martinez was arrested by Immigration and
Naturalization Service agents on a felony warrant for failing to
appear in court on an immigration charge, INS spokesman Ron Rogers
said Wednesday.
   Joya, 28, is a former member of the Salvadoran First Infantry
Brigade's intelligence unit and a self-described ex-member of the
unit's death squad.
   Joya said a member of the intelligence unit was one of nine
soldiers charged with murdering six Jesuit priests, their
housekeeper and her daughter in San Salvador in November, the
London Observer reported last month.
   The slayings occurred during an offensive in the capital by
leftist guerrillas fighting the U.S.-supported government.
   Joya was deported after illegally entering the United States in
1983, said his lawyer, David Carliner, in Washington, D.C.
   Joya returned to the United States in July 1989. He has applied
for political asylum and has briefed members of Congress and human
rights activists on the Salvadoran brigade's alleged
assassinations, Carliner said.
   ``He said he was in danger of being killed by members of his own
death squad because he bungled a job that came to public
attention,'' the attorney said.
   Joya was arrested on Tuesday by INS agents and city police,
Rogers said.
   He was indicted last month on a felony charge of illegally
re-entering the country. The warrant for his arrest was issued
after he failed to heed an order to appear in court, Rogers said.
Carliner said that Joya never received the summons.
   Joya could face a jail term if convicted but cannot be deported
until his application for political asylum is resolved, Carliner
said. A decision is expected by July 20, and an appeal could allow
Joya to stay in the country for up to three years, the attorney
said.
   More than 70,000 people, most of them civilians, have been
killed in the 10-year Salvadoran civil war.

   A messenger with a criminal record and
psychiatric problems was charged today with three of 55
dart-blowing attacks that have unnerved women in midtown Manhattan,
police said.
   Jerome Wright, 33, of the Bronx was arrested after being
identified in a lineup by three women on Wednesday night, police
said. He was charged with three counts each of reckless
endangerment, criminal possession of a weapon and harassment.
   Chief Joseph DiMartino said Wright was suspected in the other
attacks, but was charged only in the cases in which women
identified him.
   Two plainclothes officers stopped Wright on a street corner
Tuesday because he fit the description of the man who has been
blowing homemade needle darts at the backsides of well-dressed
women.
   DiMartino, head of Manhattan detectives, said the officers took
Wright's name and address and passed it on to detectives who
persuaded Wright to come in for questioning Wednesday.
   DiMartino said Wright admitted to the three attacks he was
charged with, but didn't have a clear motive.
   ``Mr. Wright has made numerous statements to us, none of which
has given us real insight into why he is doing this,'' DiMartino
said at a news conference.
   The chief said Wright ``indicated to us he has been under
observation for psychiatric problems.'' He did not elaborate.
   Wright, who is on probation until 1992 for a drug conviction,
``works in the area as a messenger and mail room clerk, which puts
him on the streets during the day,'' DiMartino said.
   At least 55 women have reported feeling the sting of the
so-called Dartman's needle darts since June 26.
   A majority of the attacks took place in the Penn Station and
Times Square area, many at lunchtime. Eighteen darts were recovered
and tests showed none was tainted.
   None of the women suffered serious physical injury but the odd
attacks had women looking over their shoulders for several weeks.

   Marion Barry refused routine medical testing
when he was rushed to a hospital for shortness of breath after
using cocaine at a 1987 Super Bowl party, an advertising executive
who has been a friend of the mayor testified today.
   Jeffrey Mitchell, who said he loves Barry ``like a brother,''
also detailed seven instances in which he said he and Barry used
cocaine together. He also described other instances of drug use
with the mayor.
   At the Super Bowl party, Barry and Mitchell drank cognac and
champagne and smoked marijuana together before Barry and a female
visitor disappeared into a bedroom of the private home they were
staying in, Mitchell said.
   ``I next saw him in the living room, sitting in a chair with his
head back ... he was clearing his nose, sniffing,'' said Mitchell.
``I asked him if he was okay, because he had his head back and he
looked uncomfortable. ...He said he was having trouble breathing.''
   Mitchell said he led Barry outside for some fresh air, but the
mayor's breathing troubles continued and he was taken to a hospital.
   ``He said he felt like he was going to faint,'' Mitchell said.
   At the hospital, Barry felt better after being given oxygen in
the emergency room, Mitchell said.
   ``He didn't want any tests,'' Mitchell said. ``He felt better
and wanted to leave.''
   Mitchell then testified that he called Lloyd Moore, another
Barry friend, and told him what had happened.
   ``I kind of suggested that he (Barry) might have gotten ahold of
some bad stuff,'' Mitchell said he told Moore.
   Moore, who testified Wednesday, said he and Mitchell had worked
frantically to cover up Barry's cocaine use in Los Angeles.
   ``Jeff basically had taken charge,'' Moore said of the telephone
call he had with Mitchell. ``He told me how he got the mayor to the
hospital, what tests he allowed them to take. He would not let them
take a blood test.''
   Back in Washington, Barry's office said the mayor had received
treatment for the flareup of a hiatal hernia.
   Moore, who testified that he supplied cocaine to Barry on
several occasions, said Mitchell told him that Barry was afraid he
became ill after using cocaine ``laced with something.''
   Barry had been ``very sick. ... They thought he was going to
die,'' Moore said Mitchell reported to him.
   Mitchell, who heads his own BMY Inc. advertising agency, is the
subject of an FBI investigation into allegations that he bribed
Bahamian officials in 1987 with money from Barry and other
witnesses in the trial, The Washington Post and The Washington
Times reported today.
   The Post, quoting law enforcement sources, said authorities were
trying to determine whether Mitchell paid $40,000 to secure a
contract to manage advertising space at Nassau International
Airport.
   The Times, quoting Norman Beebe, a partner in Mitchell's
advertising company, said the bribe was paid to close friends of
Bahamian Prime Minister Lynden O. Pindling.
   Beebe also told the Times that Mitchell told him Barry
contributed $5,000 of the alleged bribe.
   One of the 14 charges against Barry accuses him of conspiring to
conceal his cocaine use.
   Moore testified that he and Barry used cocaine together at
Moore's home about a half-dozen times from May 1986 to March 1987
and that the mayor used cocaine by himself at Moore's home on three
or so other occasions. He said he gave Barry cocaine ``a couple of
times,'' each time in an amount worth about $50.
   ``Thirteen times you saw the defendant use or possess cocaine in
your home?'' Assistant U.S. Attorney Richard Roberts asked.
   ``That is correct,'' Moore replied.
   Moore, who practices law in Washington, was appointed by Barry
to the District of Columbia Boxing Commission and Commission on the
Arts and Humanities.

   A nuclear plant went back on line
Thursday, four days after it was ordered closed due to a valve leak
that filled the containment building with radioactive steam.
   Vandellos II, one of the newest of Spain's nine operating
nuclear plants, was connected to the national electrical grid at
4:13 a.m. after an eight-hour warm start, according to a spokesman
for the plant's owner.
   The Nuclear Security Commission authorized the start-up
Wednesday evening after completing a technical study of the
accident, which did not release any radiation into the air.
   A commission spokeswoman said the leak was caused by a faulty
joint in a flow-meter on a line where the temperature of steam in
one of the plant's main refrigeration units is measured.

<TEXT>
   Adolf Hitler and Hermann Goering
will lose their honorary citizenship of Potsdam if a City Hall
proposal is approved next month, the East German news agency ADN
reported Thursday.
   The Nazi dictator and his air force chief were awarded the honor
in 1933, but it was never revoked because of a 57-year
administrative mess and the ousted Communist leadership's fear of
causing a public scandal, ADN said.
   Records showed officials assumed shortly after World War II that
the issue had been settled under decrees issued by the Soviet
military administrators of what is now East Germany.
   However, those Red Army decrees on ``de-Nazification'' made no
specific mention of the honorary citizenships, the agency said.
   ``When the problem finally came to light in the city council in
1988, the matter was quietly relegated to the archives,'' ADN said.
   Hitler committed suicide during the April 1945 Red Army siege of
Berlin. Goering killed himself in 1946, shortly before his
scheduled execution in Nuremberg for war crimes.
   Erwin Motzkus, mayor of this city on Berlin's southwestern
outskirts, recommended that Potsdam councilors revoke the honorary
citizenships during their next session on Aug. 15, ADN said.
   Last week, the East German city of Rostock revoked the honorary
citizen title it had bestowed on Hitler, ADN reported.
   The action came after the new city council, elected in Rostock's
first democratic elections in May, appointed a committee to
investigate the city's list of honorary citizens.

   Police today shot and killed two armed

   Two other radicals were captured by police during the raid.
   A police statement said security officials discovered three

   Officials said the four people belonged to an outlawed

   Members of the group have been sought since March for their
suspected role in an Istanbul shootout that left one policeman dead
and two wounded.
   The semi-official Anatolia news agency said police acting on a
tip surrounded the house and ordered those inside to surrender.
   Police opened fire after they were fired upon.
   The news agency identified the dead as Alper Ersoy, a man, and
Gulay Arici, a woman. Two others, Ali Cinar and Veyis Deprem, both
men, were captured.
   A wave of terrorism in late 1970s claimed 5,000 lives in Turkey
and triggered a military takeover in 1980 that lasted three years.

   Jerusalem Mayor Teddy Kollek retroactively won
permission to take 103 works by painter Marc Chagall out of France,
the mayor's spokeswoman said Thursday.
   Kollek had carried the drawings, gouaches and an oil painting
out of France in four suitcases in April without getting the
necessary exit permits.
   When French authorities complained to Kollek, he returned the
works to the French Consulate in Jerusalem, Kollek spokeswoman
Bonnie Boxer said.
   ``The procedures that should have taken place before the works
left France took place in Jerusalem on French soil,'' Ms. Boxer
said. ``Once the legal proceedings were completed, the works were
returned to us.''
   She said Kollek had been unaware that he needed an exit permit
for the art works, which were a bequest to the Israel Museum by
Chagall's daughter Ida, a Paris resident.
   Chagall, who was born in Russia in 1887, settled in France in
1923 and died in 1985. Much of his work dealt with Jewish subjects.
   The drawings bequeathed to the Israel Museum include a sketch
for one of his wall tapestries, which hangs in Israel's Parliament,
and an image of King David playing the harp.

<TEXT>
   Negotiators for the government and
striking unions agreed early today to end a strike that tore up
city streets, brought commerce to a halt and left at least six
people dead.
   The accord was signed by negotiators for President Violeta
Barrios de Chamorro and the Sandinista-led National Workers' Front,
ending the biggest challenge so far to Mrs. Chamorro's 10-week-old
government.
   The strike took hold July 2 and spread through most government
ministries and many state businesses. Strike leaders claimed 90,000
took part.
   The Sandinistas, who left office April 25 after a February
defeat at the polls, remain the largest single political force in
Nicaragua.
   In its settlement, the government agreed to suspend a decree
permitting the return of confiscated lands to previous owners. It
also agreed to a 43 percent salary raise in July and another
increase of undetermined size for August.
   Under the pact, public sector workers fired since Mrs. Chamorro
took office April 25 will be paid and there will be no retribution
against the strikers.
   The Sandinistas had opposed the layoffs ordered by the
U.S.-backed government, which is trying to cut the budget deficit
and nurse back to health an economy ravaged by a decade of war and
U.S. trade sanctions.
   Opposition was also strong in the country of 3.7 million people
to government plans to sell many of the properties the Sandinistas
confiscated and nationalized after coming to power in a 1979
popular revolution.
   The strike closed the international airport, cut electricity and
water service, limited telephone and mail delivery, reduced
gasoline supplies and shut down factories and businesses.
   It was the second major strike, and the most violent, in Mrs.
Chamorro's administration. At least six people were reported killed
and 100 injured in fighting between strikers and government
supporters since Friday.
   On Wednesday, barricade-building and gun-fighting in the streets
of Managua that had occurred in recent days appeared to have
subsided. There were no large crowds out at night as earlier in the
week.
   A public sector strike in May resulted in 100 percent raises and
other important concessions. The raises helped offset high
inflation in Nicaragua, where the average worker's salary is only
about $100 a month.
   The minimum salary is about $20 a month, and inflation was
officially listed at 124.7 percent for the month of June.
   The latest strike was initially called to protest the firings of
government workers and to demand a voice in government economic
policy, which they say favors the wealthy under the new government.
   Those demands were met in part through the indemnification and
the land redistribution issue.
   The government had proclaimed the strike illegal, claiming it
was politically motivated.
   Workers were returning to their jobs today. The streets of many
neighborhoods remained torn up where Sandinista backers had used
the paving stones for barricades.
   The unions that called the strikes, the army and police are all
loyal to the leftist Sandinistas, who ruled the country for a
decade until their February loss at the polls. The U.S. economic
embargo that helped create shortages even in basic foodstuffs,
contributed to their defeat.
   Mrs. Chamorro won with the backing of a 14-party coalition that
ranged from far right to Communist, and had little more in common
than a distaste for the Sandinistas.
   The U.S. trade sanctions and a nine-war against the
U.S.-supported Contra rebels devastated the economy before Mrs.
Chamorro took office, and her reconstruction efforts have stirred
resentment and opposition.
   Talks got under way Wednesday night with Antonio Lacayo, a
son-in-law and close aide of Mrs. Chamorro, representing the
government and Sandinista Labor Center leader Lucio Jimenez heading
the union team.

   The nation's last known hand-crank
party line was disconnected today when residents of central Idaho's
rugged Salmon River canyon received private-line, touch-tone
service.
   ``It's sure nice,'' country store owner Garry Pedrow said in
answering the first incoming call. ``I'm not screaming anymore.''
   Public Utilities Commission President Joe Miller made the first
call out from Pedrow's store to Gary C. Byrne, administrator of the
Rural Electrification Administration, which financed the switch.
   The depression-era system had grown familiar, and residents
greeted the change with mixed emotions.
   ``I hate to see the historical value of it leave, but as far as
being in business it's hard to communicate on this line!'' Pedrow
yelled into the mouthpiece Wednesday.
   Pedrow's Shoup Country Store is near North Fork, about 200 miles
northeast of Boise. He and 17 year-round neighbors depended on the
magneto-operated system and switchboard operator Steve Freestone to
talk to each other and the outside world.
   At first, they resisted efforts to do away with the phones. But
eventually they agreed the convenience of modern private-line,
touch-tone service was more important.
   The new system, which required 40 miles of underground cable
laid over several months, made an immediate difference.
   ``It sounds great,'' said Joyce Rinehart at the Ramshead motel
and restaurant. ``Now that I know it's working, I'm going to call
my mother back in Iowa.''
   ``Everybody's got a list a mile long of people they want to
call,'' said David Hobson, a technician who worked on the
modernization project.
   The fate of the old system was cast a year ago when AT&amp;T
announced that computerization would force elimination of the
switchboard operator. Freestone operates the switchboard from his
Motel Deluxe in Salmon, about 20 miles from the canyon.
   The residents along 34 miles of the canyon used the system like
an intercom to talk among themselves without help, but Freestone
was their link beyond the wilderness.
   He placed outgoing calls and fielded incoming ones, directing
calls to the right customers through a system of coded rings.
Pedrow's store, for instance, was three longs.
   ``They're sad to see the last crank phone system being taken
out, but they're glad to get better service,'' Freestone said.
   ``That line's been so bad. It's a raggedy old thing. They've got
it nailed to trees and mountains. Most of the time you have to yell
pretty loud to talk to people down river.''
   The system originally was set up by the U.S. Forest Service in
1931 and was sold to a cooperative for $1 in 1952.
   In their heyday, such wall-mounted phones _ consisting of a
black metal mouthpiece on an arm and a receiver hung on a two-prong
hook _ represented the communications heart of as many as 1.2
million American farms and ranches.
   A crank on the right side rang bells along the line. An operator
could be reached with persistent cranking.
   Each customer was to answer just his own coded ring while
ignoring the rest. But party line chatter, with two or three people
talking and several more secretly listening, was a popular rural
recreation, long before electricity, television and even radio.
   A ``line call'' of continuous ringing was often used to alert
families of emergencies like approaching storms, tornadoes or
forest fires.
   The crank phones fit in well with the lifestyle in the isolated
canyon, where residents need generators for electricity and have
only seasonal running water.
   ``In the beginning some of the people said they didn't want to
lose the crank system,'' said Mike Martell of Rural Telephone Co.,
who coordinated cable-laying for the new system. ``There were a few
ideas and they weren't even feasible. ... But the people are real
happy now. They're ready to get off the old system.''
   Pedrow's wife, Peggy, agreed.
   ``Once it's gone, it's gone forever,'' she said. ``But at this
point right now, I guess I'm ready because I can't hear anything on
it.''

   Mohawk warriors dug trenches and reinforced
barricades with crushed police cars today, one day after fighting a
gun battle with police over a golf course addition the Indians say
encroaches on tribal land.
   A police officer was shot and killed Wednesday morning when the
4-month-old dispute between Mohawks and officials from this town
near Montreal escalated into a shootout.
   Both sides accused each other of opening fire first.
   About 100 police moved to dismantle a barricade of cement blocks
and barbed wire the Indians had built on an access road to the
disputed land.
   However, the police were driven back during an exchange of
gunfire with 200 armed Mohawks wearing war paint.
   Officials were unsure whether the slain police officer, Cpl.
Marcel Lemay, 31, was shot by a Mohawk or a fellow policeman.
   After the fight, the Indians dug defensive trenches with a
commandeered earth mover and brought in reinforcements from other
reservations. They patrolled the edge of the golf course in stolen
golf carts, preparing for another attack.
   Down the hill, dozens of police wearing flack jackets and
carrying shotguns patrolled their new sandbagged positions
reinforced with concrete blocks. During the night, police brought
in hundreds of additional officers.
   The Mohawks claim title to a small pine forest the leaders of
Oka, a picturesque town 18 miles west of Montreal, want to cut down
so the golf course can add nine holes. The police had intervened at
the request of Oka's mayor.
   The Mohawks said late Wednesday that Quebec Security Minister
Sam Elkas had promised them police would not attack during the
night or this morning unless they were fired on first.
   Several Mohawks confirmed late Wednesday that Mohawk warriors
from the Kahnawake reserve, south of Montreal, and the Akwesasne
reserve south of Cornwall, Ontario, had arrived as reinforcements.
   No figures were immediately available.
   ``I know that if they (police) come in we'll be ready for
them,'' said Harvey, a Mohawk who declined to give his last name.
   The Indians took advantage of the police retreat to seize four
police cars and two vans, then used the commandeered earth mover to
crush the vehicles, forming a barricade on a hill across the main
highway through the region.
   Their position overlooked a police roadblock at the bottom of
the hill.

   African National Congress leader Nelson
Mandela, who arrived with a slight case of pneumonia, was reported
in better condition and even received visitors Thursday, ANC and
government officials said.
   ``He is up and about and has received several guests today,''
said a Ministry of Foreign Affairs official, who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   He declined to name the visitors or say how many Mandela
received, saying only: ``Believe me. He is much better.''
   In other developments, the wives of seven prominent Kenyans,
four of whose husbands recently were detained without charge for
criticizing the government, pleaded with Mandela to intervene on
their behalf and urge President Daniel arap Moi to free the men.
   ``What is even more painful than the imprisonment of the black
man by the white man is the unjustified imprisonment of the black
man by the black man,'' the wives said in a one-page letter to
Mandela.
   Mandela, who is a guest at Moi's official residence, arrived
Wednesday following four days of violence in which at least 28
people were killed. The fighting was sparked by a weekend
pro-democracy rally dispersed by security forces with guns and tear
gas after demonstrators attacked a police officer.
   Mandela was scheduled to leave Saturday for Mozambique, the last
leg of a grueling six-week tour through North America, Europe and
Africa. He plans to return to South Africa in time for his 72nd
birthday July 18.
   Njuguna Mahugu, the foreign ministry's chief of protocol,
refused to comment on reports that Mandela had sought hospital
treatment Wednesday.
   Mandela, 71, arrived in Kenya from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, one
day earlier than planned, and ANC officials in South Africa said
the change was prompted by a slight case of pneumonia.
   ``All medical reports we have received indicate that comrade
Mandela is comfortable and is expected to be able to resume his
duties within a few days,'' said the ANC statement released in
Johannesburg.
   Concerns about Mandela's health have arisen previously, and he
has had to postpone or cancel several events due to fatigue. He
underwent surgery in June to have a benign cyst removed from his
bladder and doctors have expressed concern about his heart.
   Mandela was jailed for 27 years for opposing South Africa's
white-led government. In 1988, he was hospitalized for tuberculosis.

   A radio station today suspended a
talk-show host who banned black listeners from speaking on his show
because a station employee's car was broken into and her purse
stolen, allegedly by a black man.
   Berkley Fraser, manager of WERC-AM, went on the air with his
apology and said Tim Lennox was being suspended indefinitely after
this afternoon's show to give the station time to review the
situation.
   ``We encourage free expression with live programming, and
unfortunately mistakes do occur,'' said Fraser.
   Callers to ``The Tim Lennox Show'' Wednesday were asked their
race before being allowed to talk on the air, Lennox said. He said
he took the action after he described the theft to listeners and
reported that a black man was a suspect.
   Callers talked about their experiences as victims of crime and
how to avoid becoming a victim, but nearly half were critical of
Lennox for banning blacks, the Birmingham Post-Herald reported.
   The Rev. Abraham Woods, president of the Birmingham chapter of
the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, said he would demand
an apology from Lennox.
   ``That was uncalled-for action on his part,'' Woods said. ``It
really bordered on stupidity in this day and time.''
   Lennox said he could not explain his action.
   ``On the spur of the moment, I said, `Let's not take calls from
any blacks,''' he said.
   ``It was interesting, the reaction to it,'' said Lennox, who has
worked in radio for 15 years. ``I had my boss sticking his head in
the door. ... If nothing else, it says something about the racial
sensitivity.''

   Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu visited the
tomb of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and met briefly today with
the slain civil rights leader's widow.
   Kaifu and his wife, Sachiyo, stood together after he placed a
wreath of pink and red carnations, purple daisies and burgundy
chrysanthemums on King's grave.
   He made no public comments during the ceremony and reporters
were not allowed at a short meeting later between Kaifu and Coretta
Scott King.
   American civil rights advocates were outraged four years ago
when then-Prime Minister Nasuhiro Nakasone said blacks and
Hispanics lowered U.S. intelligence standards.
   Steve Klein, research associate at the Martin Luther King Jr.
Center for Nonviolent Social Change, said civil rights leaders
appreciated Kaifu's gesture.
   ``He's a new prime minister,'' Klein said. ``We can't hold him
responsible for what others have said.''
   Kaifu was to deliver a speech Thursday night outlining a broad
cultural exchange project and encouraging cooperation between Japan
and the United States, said Stephen Allen, public relations officer
for the Japanese Consulate in Atlanta.
   Kaifu has made few public remarks since he arrived in Georgia
Wednesday night but told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in a
written statement that ``the American Southeast has long had good
relations with Japan, and this region is today home to about 600
Japanese companies ... (that) contribute to the region's economic
development.
   ``I am hoping to have the chance to meet with some of these
corporate leaders, and I will take the opportunity to encourage
them to fit in with their local communities as good corporate
citizens,'' he said.
   Kaifu planned brief meetings today with local Japanese business
leaders as well as a private meeting with Georgia Gov. Joe Frank
Harris and Govs. James Martin of North Carolina and Bill Clinton of
Arkansas.
   He began his 37-hour visit to Georgia after attending the
economic summit in Houston.

<HEAD>Despite Cold War's End, French Keep Ambitious Military Goals</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Unswayed by visions of a ``peace dividend,'' France
has declared its intent to field Western Europe's strongest army
and retain an independent nuclear arsenal based on the deterrence
strategy of the Cold War.
   Defense Minister Jean-Pierre Chevenement, a Socialist admired by
conservatives, has rejected demands for spending cuts and says
France should never again retreat into the defensive, passive
strategies that led to its defeat in World War II.
   On Saturday, the pride of the French army _ 7,000 soldiers from
elite units, 340 armored vehicles and scores of warplanes and
combat helicopters _ are scheduled to march, roll and fly over the
Champs-Elysees in celebration of Bastille Day.
   There are no plans for counter-demonstrations _ France never
experienced the anti-nuclear protests that mushroomed throughout
Western Europe in the mid-1980s _ but there are signs of some
cracks in the longstanding consensus on military policy.
   The Finance Ministry and the governing Socialists' left wing are
asking for substantial military spending cuts to reflect the
collapse of Soviet-backed regimes in Eastern Europe and the reduced
threat from Moscow.
   Chevenement has also become a prime target for some elements of
the press.
   Le Canarde Enchaine, a satirical weekly, carried a front-page
cartoon this week showing French and Soviet generals each shouting:
``We don't want to disarm.'' The cartoon also featured Chevenement
devising a solution _ a ``Disneyland with real bullets'' in which
the two armies can blast away at each other to their hearts'
content.
   Francois Heisbourg, a Frenchman who is director of the
London-based International Institute of Strategic Studies, said
France, unlike its allies, ``has a basic unwillingness to consider
major choices in restructuring its forces.''
   France waged the wrong kind of war in 1940, Heisbourg said in a
telephone interview, ``and we may now being fighting the wrong kind
of peace.''
   An example, he said, was France's decision to press ahead with
the development of the short-range Hades nuclear missile even
though its range extends no farther than Germany.
   Chevenement has refused to join optimistic assessments that the
world is becoming a safer place. He foresees a dangerous strategic
vacuum developing in Europe over the next five years, with the
specter of instability, cross-border ethnic violence, and
potentially virulent nationalism.
   France, he said last weekend, ``must maintain all its
capabilities.''
   Foremost in the French military arsenal is the independent
nuclear force that has been preserved and improved by all French
leaders since the 1960s.
   France has insisted on maintaining total sovereignty over its
nuclear strategy and has refused to endorse the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization's recent declaration that it would use nuclear
weapons only as a last resort.
   Despite the crumbling of the Warsaw Pact, France is sticking by
its Cold War policy of nuclear deterrence. According to military
headquarters, this requires the ability to ``inflict damage on the
aggressor's population and industrial capacity damage at least
equal to that suffered by France.''
   The nuclear arsenal is tested and upgraded regularly, and
consumes an estimated one-third of all money spent on defense
equipment.
   The French army maintains a force of about 470,000 soldiers,
sailors and airmen.
   France produces most of its own armaments and is the world's No.
3 weapons exporter.
   France also aspires to a global military role. It guards
territories in the Caribbean, the Indian Ocean and the South
Pacific, deploys more than 6,000 soldiers in Africa under bilateral
treaties, has sent warships on relief missions to Lebanon, and
recently established a joint France-German brigade in West Germany.
   Although a strong advocate of European unity, President Francois
Mitterrand, president since 1981, has rejected suggestions that
France return to the integrated military structure of NATO.
   Chevenement has not been totally inflexible. Last weekend he
said 35,000 soldiers would be trimmed from the military by 1995 and
offered to consider reducing mandatory military service from 12
months to 10.
   But he balked at reconsidering major weapons programs or making
major cuts in the proposed 1991 defense budget of $36 billion _ 3.5
percent of the gross domestic product and about 16 percent of the
total national budget.
   Such an expense, Chevenement said, ``is a small price to pay for
freedom.''

   A 42-year-old man with AIDS wanted to leave
something behind when he died, so in April he planted 15 trees in a
city park. He recently discovered 11 were destroyed.
   Philip Risko said he found that city workers five weeks ago had
leveled or bent the 4- to-6-foot saplings while mowing to cut grass
and weeds.
   ``It was heartbreaking,'' he said.
   He said city workers told him they saw the trees but did not
have instructions to take the extra time to mow around them. He
complained to the city but was told he needed a permit to plant
anything in a city park.
   William Darnell, supervisor of forestry and landscape for the
Parks and Recreation Department, said it was likely the workers
would knock over the trees because they were not supposed to be
planted.
   ``All we can say is there's nothing we can say,'' Darnell said.
``Thank you, but that wasn't the way to do that.''

   A van loaded with children was crushed
when it drove into the path of a train, authorities said. Two
children and a 25-year-old woman were killed.
   Three adults and five children remained hospitalized today in
serious or critical condition. They were on a family outing to an
amusement park.
   The engineer of the 65-car Southern Pacific train tried to warn
the driver as she approached the crossing Wednesday evening, said
railroad company spokesman Jim Johnson.
   ``According to the engineer, he was blowing his horn and ringing
his bell when he saw the van approach...,'' Johnson said. ``She
never stopped.''
   The engineer threw on his emergency brakes, but the train hit
the van broadside, crushing it and flipping it, Johnson and rescue
workers said.
   ``A witness reported the van was eastbound on Stagecoach Road
and drove into the path of the northbound freight train,'' said
Sgt. Mike Middleton.
   Caddo Parish sheriff's deputies said the driver survived but
they have not been able to interview her because of her injuries.
Investigators said the victims were related.
   Eight passengers were thrown from the van, and three were pinned
in the wreckage, said Thurman Speaks, chief of Fire District 6.
   Killed were Sandra Stultz and her 18-month-old daughter, Hannah,
of Texarkana, Ark., and 8-year-old Amy Gray of Taylor, Ark.
   The railroad crossing south of this northwest Louisiana city was
equipped with a crossing warning sign and a stop sign.

   Michelle McKenna's new baby boy has great
timing _ John Patrick McKenna was born 12:34:56 7-8-90.
   Michelle and Brian McKenna's newborn son was delivered at 12:34
and 56 seconds on Sunday morning, July 8, '90 _ giving him the
perfect string of consecutive numbers.
   The McKennas of Marlboro aren't numerologists. But while Mrs.
McKenna was preparing for the delivery at Leonard Morse Hospital on
Saturday afternoon, her husband watched a television news program
that carried a piece on the unusual digital occasion.
   He told his wife and suggested she concentrate on 12:34:56 as a
goal.
   ``That's great; that'll be a great focal point,'' Mrs. McKenna
recalled.
   Mrs. McKenna said she lost track time around 11 p.m., because
``I was in too much discomfort really to be thinking about it.''
   But her husband, the delivering doctor, Frank Wilson, and nurse
Karen Johnson didn't forget.
   The trio reminded Mrs. McKenna of the goal around midnight. It
became easy to concentrate on the time because ``it just so
happened that a clock was staring me dead in the face.''
   Mrs. McKenna was urged to hold off her delivery until the
perfect moment.
   ``No, don't push yet, hold off a second,'' she recalled the
nurse saying.
   Wilson declared the boy officially born at exactly 56 seconds
past 12:34, when his feet appeared.
   The occurence is not officially recorded. Massachusetts birth
certificates only have space for the hour and minute.

<HEAD>State Appeals Court Upholds Cuomo's Shoreham Deal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A state appeals court today unanimously
upheld Gov. Mario Cuomo's agreement to have the state buy the
Shoreham nuclear power plant for $1 and dismantle it.
   The 5-0 decision from the Appellate Division of state Supreme
Court upheld two lower court rulings in Cuomo's favor.
   The Shoreham plant, built at a cost of more than $5.5 billion,
has never operated at anything above low-level test power. The
plant, located in Suffolk County on Long Island, was built by the
Long Island Lighting Company and brought the company to the brink
of bankruptcy.
   Cuomo argued that Shoreham was unsafe to operate because its
location on a heavily populated island made an emergency evacuation
impractical. Cuomo reached the agreement with LILCO to scrap the
plant in 1989.
   ``Our decision is not meant to be a judgment on any party's
position regarding nuclear-generated power generally or Shoreham
specifically,'' said the appeals court in an unsigned opinion. ``It
is simply an assessment of the authority granted by the Legislature
and how that authority has been exercised.''
   Martin Kaufman, a lawyer for the Atlantic Legal Foundation, said
he wasn't yet certain whether his group would attempt to appeal the
ruling to New York's highest court, the Court of Appeals.
   The foundation, a conservative-oriented organization, had been
joined in the lawsuit by the U.S. Justice Department and other
supporters of not abandoning Shoreham.
   ``Obviously, this loss is not helpful,'' said Kaufman.

   Some infants living near the Hanford
nuclear reservation in the 1940s may have received more radiation
than people living near Nevada nuclear weapons testing sites, a
scientist said today.
   John Till, chairman of a panel trying to estimate doses of
radiation to people living near the federal weapons production
reservation, said some infants may have received 2,900 rads of
radioactive iodine over three years.
   A rad is a measure of radiation exposure to human tissue and is
roughly equal to the radiation in 12 chest X-rays. The Nuclear
Regulatory Commission requires that facilities it licenses limit
yearly radiation exposure from airborne emissions to 15 thousandths
of a rad.
   Release of the study came one day after the Department of Energy
acknowledged for the first time that Hanford leaked radiation at
levels that endangered the health of nearby residents.
   ``Now that they've admitted what they've done, I think they
should make restitution and they should provide medical help for
the rest of our lives for anything the radiation has caused,'' said
Betty Perkes, whose family farms near Pasco, Wash. ``I feel like
they used us for guinea pigs, and I don't feel like they cared one
iota what happened to us either, or our families.''
   However, it would be very difficult to prove a long-term illness
was caused by exposure more than 40 years ago and the law prohibits
lawsuits against the government, said Jim Thomas of the Spokane,
Wash.-based Hanford Education Action League.
   The study was not intended to identify health risks from
radiation exposure. But Till said the numbers were high enough to
strongly justify a study of thyroid diseases among so-called
``downwinders'' who lived near Hanford during periods when it was
spewing radioactive particles into the atmosphere in large
quantities.
   The study of 270,000 people living in 10 counties of Washington
and Oregon near the reservation in south-central Washington
indicated that 13,500 people received cumulative doses greater than
33 rad in the years 1944-47.
   ``These numbers are significant because that is a lot of
folks,'' Till said at a news conference before the actual release
of the study. ``That dose level is significant enough to strongly
justify a thyroid dose study.''
   Radioactive iodine was released when spent reactor fuel rods
were chemically dissolved to separate weapons-grade plutonium and
uranium. When it concentrates in the thyroid gland, iodine-131 can
cause cancer and other diseases.
   Till said that by comparison, doses downwind from the Nevada
nuclear weapons testing site ranged from a few rad to 500 rad.
   The Hanford Environmental Dose Reconstruction Project uses
computer models to estimate how much radiation escaped when
plutonium was produced for nuclear weapons.
   ``I know of no other releases of this magnitude from any other
U.S. facility,'' Till said of the 1944-47 period, noting that
modern releases are extremely small.
   A small number of infants may have received as much as 2,900 rad
during that time, Till said. Infants were particularly vulnerable
to radioactive iodine because their thyroids were not as developed
as an adult's, and they likely drank more milk produced by cows
that grazed on grass contaminated by radioactive iodine.
   Of the 270,000 people studied, half received doses of less than
1.7 rad over the three years, and half received doses greater than
that. Of the upper half, 13,500 got doses greater than 33 rad, Till
said.
   Because of prevailing west-to-east winds, the affected area lies
roughly east of Hanford, with larger radiation doses affecting
those who lived closest to the reservation, Till said.
   The 10 counties covered in the study were Yakima, Kittitas,
Grant, Adams, Benton, Franklin, Walla Walla and Klickitat in
Washington state, and Morrow and Umatilla in Oregon. Some of the
counties are included entirely, others only partly.
   The panel also studied radiation doses to 70,000 people exposed
through water in the Columbia River, which borders part of the
reservation, and found that the average dose to the
gastrointestinal tract was 1.7 rad during a three-year period from
1964-66.
   The study is the first part of a five-year, $15 million project
that is the first major research into accidental and intentional
release of large amounts of radioactive materials that drifted from
Hanford.

<HEAD>Panel OKs Bill Putting China `On Notice'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House subcommittee approved a bill Thursday
that would allow China to keep favored-trade status this year but
require significant progress in human rights if the designation is
to be renewed.
   Rep. Donald Pease, D-Ohio, called his legislation an attempt to
``put China on notice that next year will be different if human
rights practices don't improve.''
   The action by the Ways and Means trade subcommittee, on a voice
vote, fell far short of the revocation of most-favored-nation trade
status called for by the most strident congressional opponents of
President Bush's China policy. Those opponents believe a stronger
response is needed in light of last year's crushing of China's
pro-democracy movement.
   But even the relatively mild move drew opposition from the
administration, which said it would harm U.S. competitiveness and
do more harm than good.
   The United States and China have about $18 billion annually in
bilateral trade.
   ``With increasing signs of moderate, pragmatic thinking in
Beijing, we fear explicit public linkage of (most-favored-nation
trade status) to human rights may harden China's posture and make
it more difficult to address our concerns,'' Deputy Secretary of
State Lawrence Eagleburger said in a letter to the subcommittee.
   Kent Wiedemann, director of the department's China desk, noted
Beijing's reported release of 881 political prisoners since the
beginning of the year. An estimated 435 political prisoners are
still detained, he said.
   The subcommittee, on a 5-3 vote, rejected an effort by Rep.
Thomas Downey, D-N.Y., to toughen the measure by requiring that the
president certify that all human rights conditions set out in the
bill have been fully met, rather than simply certifying
``significant progress'' toward those goals.
   On Wednesday, Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell of Maine
introduced a bill that would revoke China's favored-trade status _
and the lower tariffs it provides _ within 90 days.
   None of the moves is expected to win enough support on Capitol
Hill to overcome an almost certain presidential veto.

   A flamboyant former president of a failed Texas
thrift has been charged with bank fraud in a $700 million real
estate deal.
   Edwin T. McBirney III, who presided over tremendous growth of
Sunbelt Savings Association before its $2 billion failure, was to
surrender today to authorities.
   McBirney's attorney, Paul Coggins, said the indictment returned
Wednesday ``is a typical case of government overkill.'' He said his
client acted in Sunbelt's best interest.
   McBirney, 37, appeared before U.S. District Judge Barefoot
Sanders today to hear the charges against him and was released on
his own recognizance. Coggins said McBirney would plead innocent at
a July 19 arraignment. McBirney would make no comment to reporters
at the courthouse.
   He was indicted on 17 counts, including bank fraud,
misapplication of funds, false entries and making false statements
to regulators. He faces up to 85 years in prison and a $4.2 million
fine if convicted.
   The indictment accuses McBirney of hiding from regulators
agreements with Western Savings Association over partial financing
of $700 million worth of property in Southern California.
   FBI agent Pat Dorsey said the deal contributed to the collapse
of Sunbelt in 1988. Sunbelt Savings was taken over by federal
thrift regulators and merged with other insolvent thrifts.
   The indictment was returned by one of three grand juries in
Dallas investigating bank and thrift fraud. Thirteen other Sunbelt
officials, borrowers and accountants have been convicted as a
result of a 2{-year investigation.
   McBirney acquired the Dallas-based thrift in 1982 with five
associates. The thrift engaged in high-risk loans that were either
unsecured or inadequately secured by commercial real estate and
land, according to government documents.
   McBirney was known in the thrift industry for flying friends to
Hawaii for fishing and Las Vegas for gambling. He dressed as a king
for a 1984 Halloween party where guests dined on pheasant, antelope
and lion.
   U.S. Attorney Marvin Collins of Dallas has said complex bank
fraud cases are difficult to prove ``unless we are able to put some
money, a lot of money, in somebody's pocket.''
   The charges against McBirney do not show who might have profited
from the transactions. He is accused of ensuring Western Savings a
$6 million profit on the sale of a property in return for Western
providing $30 million in financing on California property being
bought by Sun Cal, a Sunbelt subsidiary.
   The indictment ``marks another milestone in our crackdown on
fraud in the thrift industry,'' Attorney General Richard Thornburgh
said in Washington.

<HEAD>New England Journal Editor Announces Retirement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dr. Arnold Relman said Thursday he will retire in
June after 14 years as editor of the New England Journal of
Medicine, the world's leading chronicle of medical research.
   Relman, 67, said he plans to write, teach and lecture after he
retires as editor in chief.
   ``I've been thinking about it for some time and finally
decided,'' Relman said. ``It's better to leave a little too soon
than a little too late.''
   During Relman's tenure, the journal's circulation grew by
one-third, and the weekly magazine established itself as a forum
for exploring social and economic issues in medicine as well as
being the leading showcase of research findings.
   Relman was frequently criticized for using the journal to
question, among other things, the growing role of business in
medical care.
   ``Relman has provided the strongest voice for professionalism
and against business taking over medicine,'' said Dr. George
Lundberg, editor of the Journal of the American Medical Association.
   ``He has sought controversy in a responsible way,'' he said.
``He was very early in those areas and did engender great
controversy and a lot of personal attacks. He stood his ground and
should have. We are all in his debt for doing so.''
   The New England Journal, founded in 1812, was already one of the
world's leading medical publications when Relman took over from Dr.
Franz Ingelfinger in 1977. Relman has continued to publish a large
share of the world's hottest medical research.
   ``If you look worldwide, the New England Journal is clearly the
leading journal of clinical medicine and has been for some time,''
said David Pendlebury, editor of Science Watch published by the
Institute for Scientific Information in Philadelphia.
   Many agree that Relman's chief accomplishment has been taking
the journal into the contentious area of medical finance and
ethics. The journal has explored and editorialized about such areas
as the growth of profit-making medicine and physicians' financial
conflict of interest.
   Relman said he plans to concentrate on these and related matters
after he leaves the journal.
   ``I want to spend the next few years as a more active
participant in what I think will be a growing national discussion
of health care,'' he said. ``I think the medical profession can
make a major contribution toward solving the health care problems
of this country if it will rouse itself. I want to help in that
process.''
   Dr. Barry M. Manuel, president of the Massachusetts Medical
Society, which owns the journal, said a search committee will be
established soon to name a new top editor.
   While Relman has been editor, the journal's circulation has
grown from 165,000 to 225,000, and it claims the largest paid
circulation of any medical journal in the world.
   Before joining the New England Journal, Relman taught at Boston
University and the University of Pennsylvania and edited the
Journal of Clinical Investigation.

   Mongolia has asked to join the International
Monetary Fund, the IMF announced Thursday.
   The central Asian country, officially the Mongolian People's
Republic, was formerly known as Outer Mongolia.
   Switzerland, Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria and Namibia also have
asked to become IMF members in recent months.
   When all applicants are accepted, the IMF will have 156 member
nations _ nearly all of the countries of the world except the
Soviet Union.
   The United States, the fund's most influential member, has
opposed letting the Soviets join. IMF membership is followed by
membership in the World Bank, the biggest source of aid to the
Third World.
   Leaders of the seven wealthiest IMF members _ the United States,
Great Britain, Canada, Japan, France, West Germany and Italy _ met
this week at an economic summit in Houston. The countries asked the
IMF to head a survey of what changes the Soviets need to make to
get more foreign aid.

<HEAD>Texas Officials Say Oil-eating Microbes Worked in Mega Borg Tests</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas officials said today that oil-eating
microbes dumped on part of an oil slick from the wrecked
supertanker Mega Borg appeared successful in eating the oil while
not harming the environment.
   ``If you believe your eyes, it was a great success,'' Texas Land
Commissioner Garry Mauro said at a news conference today. ``Test
results from the small application show no evidence that the
microbes produced any toxic byproducts, and no evidence of change
in the nutrient balance of the natural marine environment.
   ``Best of all, the tests show that the microbes ate the oil,''
Mauro said, adding that the surface oil in some samples was
``reduced to 30 percent of the original volume.''
   The process, called bioremediation, involves the use of
microorganisms that are dumped on oil.
   The naturally occurring bacteria reduce the oil to an emulsion
of fatty acids. This emulsion sinks and is consumed by marine life,
while the microbes die after the oil is gone.
   The microbes were dropped on part of the slick from the Mega
Borg, which was left crippled in the Gulf of Mexico after an
explosion June 8. An estimated 3.9 million gallons of Angolan crude
leaked from the vessel, although much of that was consumed by fire.
   The bioremediation tests on the spill cost the state $26,000.
   Mauro and B.J. ``Buck'' Wynne, chairman of the Texas Water
Commission, said they were pleased with the results and were ready
to push forward to have bioremediation included in companies' oil
spill contingency plans.

   Mouth cancer kills nearly 10,000 people a year in
the United States, and unlike other cancers, survival rates aren't
getting better, federal health officials said Thursday.
   The Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control said oral and
pharynx cancers killed 9,742 Americans in 1987, the latest year for
which statistics are available. That works out to 3.6 deaths per
100,000 people _ the same rate it was back in 1973, said CDC dental
health specialist Linda Crossett.
   And the survival rate hasn't changed in 16 years, the CDC said.
Only 52 percent of oral cancer patients survive five years or more.
That's in contrast to the survival rates for breast, colorectal and
prostate cancer, which are improving.
   Federal health officials have set a national goal of cutting
oral cancer deaths in middle-age Americans by 15 percent to 30
percent by the year 2000.
   ``We're not making a lot of progress,'' Crossett said. ``Looking
at new cases now, about 30,000 Americans are diagnosed with oral
cancers each year.''
   The survival rates are lower for blacks _ and getting worse.
Just 31 percent of black patients survived oral cancer, in 1981-86
statistics, compared with 35 percent in 1974-76.
   For whites, the survival rates have remained more constant: 53
percent in 1981-86, 55 percent in 1974-76.
   Major risk factors for oral cancer include tobacco use _ either
smoked or smokeless _ and drinking. And ``the combined risks from
tobacco and alcohol use appear to be substantially greater than
those from tobacco or alcohol alone,'' the CDC said in its weekly
report.
   ``The increased use of tobacco among women, adolescents and
children'' _ as compared to a decline in smoking overall _ ``is
likely to elevate death rates for these cancers in the next several
decades,'' the report said.
   In addition to continued use of tobacco, the other major reason
for oral cancer deaths ``is the fact that there has not been any
improvement in early detection,'' Crossett said. ``Most are only
detected ... after they've grown pretty large, so advanced that
it's obvious.''
   Traditionally, a dentist has been most likely to perform a
thorough oral exam on a patient. But the CDC noted a 1986 survey
showing that people at highest risk for oral cancer sought the
services of a standard physician four times more often than they
went to the dentist.
   ``And many people going to their physician may not get a
thorough oral, head and neck exam,'' Crossett said. ``That's the
big key _ early detection.''

<HEAD>East German Lawmakers Back Liberal Abortion Law</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK FRITZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East Germany's major political factions said
Thursday they will fight to retain East Germany's liberal abortion
law when the nation unites with West Germany.
   Also Thursday, the head of the West German central bank said
East German factories must make radical changes to survive the
increased competition that will come with reunification.
   During an intense debate, most of the political factions that
control East Germany's Parliament spoke out in favor of retaining
the abortion law in the territory of what is now East Germany.
   The German states are negotiating a final treaty that would
result in the creation of a single Germany by year's end and the
disparity in abortion laws is among the differences officials in
each nation will be negotiating in the coming weeks.
   Some East German lawmakers expressed fear that their nation
would become a lure for ``abortion tourists'' from West Germany who
head to the east for the operation.
   The arch-conservative German Social Union was the only party of
Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere's broad governing coalition that
objected to retaining the law.
   ``An abortion is always murder,'' said lawmaker Sabine Landgraf
of the German Social Union.
   Family Minister Christa Schmidt told lawmakers the ministry has
received more than 100,000 letters from citizens asking that the
abortion law be retained, and 25,317 demanding that it be revoked.
   East German allows a female over age 14 to receive an abortion
on demand during the first three months of pregnancy.
   West Germany allows abortions in the first three months only in
cases of rape or incest, if the mother's life is in danger, if the
fetus is expected to be severely handicapped, or if the woman's
financial situation would make it impossible for her to raise a
child.
   There were 75,297 abortions performed in West Germany last year,
a nation of 60 million people, and 73,000 abortions in East
Germany, which has 16 million people.
   Also Thursday, Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl told
reporters following a Central Bank Council meeting that was held in
the former headquarters of the Communist Party Central Committee
that West German taxpayers are unlikely to support unprofitable
East German factories for long.
   Following the July 1 economic merger the bank began controlling
the money supply of both German states.
   ``East German companies have to earn their marks,'' he said
after the bank's board held its first meeting in East Berlin.
   East German factories have recently cut payrolls and forming
joint ventures with Western firms in an effort to survive.
   But an East German official said many of the nation's factories
are firing foreign workers first as they slash employee payrolls to
compete with Western busineses.
   ``I am ashamed of that,'' said Horst Kinitz, head of the state
employment agency. He called such layoffs illegal because they are
discriminatory.
   An estimated 80,000 Mozambicans, Cubans and Vietnamese are
working in East German enterprises under contracts with those
countries made by the former Communist government.
   The government is trying to blunt the effects of unemployment by
encouraging enterprises to reduce worker hours to keep more people
on payrolls.
   About 222,000 employees in the nation of 8 million workers are
on such shortened hours now and another 240,000 will be added soon,
Kinitz said.
   An estimated 162,000 East Germans are unemployed.
   Poehl said East Germans have been frugal with their marks and
have withdrawn about half of the 25 billion marks made available to
them.
   ``There is no reason to fear that (monetary union) will lead to
unacceptably high inflation levels,'' Poehl said.

   Two reputed Red Army Faction terrorists were
handed over to West German authorities Thursday, prosecutors said,
after years of sanctuary that may have been provided by East
Germany's now-disbanded secret police.
   Inge Viett and Werner Lotze arrived in the West German city of
Karlsruhe, where they will appear before an investigating
magistrate, according to Rolf Hannich, a spokesman for the West
German prosecutor's office.
   They were among nine alleged Red Army Faction members arrested
in East Germany in a series of raids last month. One alleged
terrorist was released because the arrest warrant against her had
expired.
   The arrests caused an uproar in both Germanys after one of those
seized said she had been given sanctuary and a new identity by the
old East German secret police force, known as the Stasi.
   News reports in West Germany have also alleged that deposed
Communist Party chief Erich Honecker and Stasi boss Erich Mielke
were personally responsible for hiding the purported terrorists.
   In East Berlin, prosecution spokesman Dieter Plath said Ms.
Viett had been extradited ``against her will'' and in defiance of
an article in the East German Constitution that bans the
extradition of criminal suspects to a ``foreign power.''
   Plath said prosecutors had acted on the ``assumption'' that the
article no longer applied to West Germany after the two Germanys
unified in effect with the July 1 merger of their economies and
social welfare systems.
   An East Berlin court confirmed that reading of the law, Plath
added.
   Ms. Viett is suspected of the attempted murder of a Paris
policeman who stopped her during a routine check in 1981.
   Lotze has said he wanted to cooperate with West German
prosecutors in order to possibly qualify for a program that offers
lenient punishment for former terrorists willing to testify against
their organization.
   Lotze, who has said he made a ``deliberate decision'' to quit
the Red Army Faction and move to East Germany in 1979, is suspected
of involvement in the 1977 kidnapping and shooting death of
Hans-Martin Schleyer, chairman of West Germany's biggest employers'
group.
   West Germany has warrants out for the arrest of both suspects
for their alleged Red Army Faction membership.
   They are the second and third terrorist suspects to arrive in
West Germany. On July 5, Susanne Albrecht, another Red Army Faction
suspect, was handed to West German authorities after saying she
wanted to testify for the prosecution.
   Plath would not confirm recent reports that another of the
suspects, Silke Maier-Witt, had also asked to be sent to West
Germany.
   West German authorities have said they weren't planning to seek
formal extradition in any of the cases because West German law will
come into force in East Germany after the two nations formally
unite, most likely in December.
   The Red Army Faction waged a terrorist campaign against West
German capitalism and NATO in the 1970s and 1980s.

   Five passengers and three flight attendants
aboard a TWA flight from Columbus, Ohio, were taken to hospitals
Thursday after becoming ill, officials said.
   The eight were released after treatment.
   ``The first flight attendant started feeling a little nauseous
about 30 minutes outside of Columbus,'' spokesman Jim Faulkner said
from TWA's St. Louis headquarters.
   By the time the plane landed at La Guardia Airport, two other
attendants and five passengers on Flight 112 complained about
nausea and dizziness, said Emergency Medical Service spokesman
Charles DeGaetano.
   TWA officials do not know what caused the illness, Faulkner said.
   ``There were no fumes on the plane,'' he said. ``There was no
indication in the cockpit of anything being wrong, all systems were
running normally.''

   North Carolina could become the second
state to scrap the winner-take-all method of allocating electoral
votes in presidential elections.
   A bill that would divide the state's 13 electoral votes by
congressional districts was up for a state Senate vote today after
passage by the House last year. But the vote was delayed until
Friday or next week because a cost analysis hadn't been completed,
said Sen. Tom Taft, chairman of the Senate Election Laws Committee.
   The Democrat-controlled state Legislature is expected to redraw
congressional district lines in 1992. Republicans fear the new
system would leave Democrats with control of all 13 electoral votes.
   Currently, whichever candidate garners a majority in a state
wins all the state's electoral votes.
   Maine adopted the alternative method in 1969, but it has made no
difference in the way the state's electoral vote has been
allocated. A similar proposal passed the Connecticut House this
session but died in the Senate after the governor hinted he would
veto it.
   In North Carolina, where Republican Gov. Jim Martin has no veto
power, the Senate was on its way to approving the bill Wednesday
when Republican Lt. Gov. Jim Gardner ruled the measure must be
accompanied by a fiscal note showing how much its passage might
cost the state.
   Republicans acknowledged the move was a delay tactic.
   Under the bill, candidates would receive one electoral vote for
each of the 11 congressional districts they win. North Carolina's
two remaining electoral votes would go to the candidate who carried
the state.
   Jack Hawke, state GOP chairman, told reporters Republicans would
lose if the bill becomes law.
   ``Frankly, I believe we should be more interested in a fair
system than in one that can be rigged in favor of a particular
party that happens to control the redistricting process,'' Hawke
said.
   Taft denied partisan motivation behind the bill, calling it
``good government.''

   Redd Foxx's jewelry, including a diamond and
gold watch given to him by Elvis Presley, will be auctioned by the
Internal Revenue Service later this month.
   The comedian, who starred as a junk man in the 1970s TV series
``Sanford and Son,'' owes the government $2.9 million in taxes and
penalties, according to the IRS.
   Seventy-six pieces of jewelry will be sold at the auction,
scheduled for July 23 at IRS headquarters in Las Vegas, said
auctioneer Robert Deiro. Included in Foxx's collection is the watch
Foxx says was a gift from the late Presley.
   Deiro and IRS officials displayed the jewelry several months
ago, but the auction was delayed while attorneys for the comedian
argued that the bankruptcy court should have jurisdiction over the
items.
   The IRS auctioned eight of Foxx's cars in May, raising $49,555.
   The cars and jewelry were seized in an IRS raid last November,
along with Foxx's Las Vegas home. Attorneys later worked out a
payment plan with the agency that allowed Foxx to keep his home.
   Foxx has been performing at the Hacienda Hotel on the Las Vegas
Strip.

   Former pop singer Cat Stevens, now known as Yusuf
Islam, said Thursday that Israeli authorities expelled him without
explanation after holding him and his son at the airport and
searching his belongings.
   Islam said in a statement he endured a ``three-hour ordeal''
while his luggage was ``ripped apart and everything from my sandals
to my pocket copy of the Holy Koran was X-rayed and searched.''
   He said he arrived at Ben-Gurion Airport on July 1 with his
5-year-old son, Muhammad, to attend a Moslem folk festival.
   ``I was getting highly irritated with the endless stream of
uniformed officials all sneaking into the area and gawking
side-eyed at me and my son, whispering, `It's him ... it's Cat
Stevens,''' Islam said.
   He said he was finally ordered out with no explanation.
   The Israeli Embassy said its immigration authorities were not
required to explain their actions.
   The popular 1970s British pop singer changed his name and
abandoned pop music when he became a Moslem.

   Armand Hammer, chairman of Occidental
Petroleum Corp., is being sued for $700 million by the heir to the
estate of his wife, claiming at least a half interest in Hammer's
art collection.
   The lawsuit, filed Wednesday in state court, alleges fraud,
legal malpractice and financial misconduct. It contends Hammer and
a law firm representing the industrialist repeatedly deceived
Frances Hammer about her ownership rights to Hammer's assets.
   The lawsuit was filed by Robert Weiss of Los Angeles, husband of
Joan Weiss. Mrs. Weiss, a niece of Frances Hammer, is the sole heir
to Mrs. Hammer's estate. Mrs. Hammer died in December after 33
years of marriage to Armand Hammer and named Robert Weiss executor
of her will.
   The 92-year-old Hammer maintains that his wife signed documents
waiving her interest in his art collection, which has been
estimated to be worth $450 million.
   Richard C. Cleary, a lawyer for the Weisses, said those were
part of the pattern of fraud and deceit. The suit also says Mrs.
Hammer was fraudulently deprived an interest in thousands of shares
of Occidental stock and millions of dollars in cash paid to Armand
Hammer in salary and fringe benefits.
   Howard Collins, a spokesman for Hammer and Occidental, declined
to comment.
   Hammer began collecting art during the 1920s in the Soviet
Union. His collection, including Impressionist and Old Master
paintings and drawings by Leonardo da Vinci, had been promised to
the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.
   But he got into a dispute with that museum over how the art was
to be displayed, and decided to build his own museum.

   Singer-writer Mel Torme might be nearing
age 65 but that doesn't mean he has any plans of bowing out of show
business.
   In fact, ``1990 is the single biggest year in my life,'' Torme
says. ``I'd be crazy to even think about retiring.''
   Torme's date at the Flathead Festival on July 18 is sandwiched
between performances with the Los Angeles Philharmonic at the
Hollywood Bowl and the London Symphony in England.
   In between concerts, he keeps busy writing, Torme said by
telephone from his California home Wednesday.
   ``My main visibility is that of a singer, and I love to sing,''
said Torme, whose birthday is in September. ``But my greatest joy
is in writing, the creative activity.''
   Probably his single best-known writing achievement is ``The
Christmas Song'' (``Chestnuts roasting on an open fire...''), which
Torme composed in 1946. It has been recorded 500 times, most
notably by the late Nat King Cole.
   Torme is working on an entire album of Christmas music, to be
recorded with the BBC Symphony, and scheduled for release near
Christmas 1991, he said.

   A senior government minister has accused an
``uppity'' West Germany of trying to dominate Europe, the Common
Market of being worse than Hitler's Germany and the French of
``behaving like poodles to the Germans.''
   Nicholas Ridley withdrew the remarks hours after they were
published Thursday in The Spectator magazine. But political
observers say the trade and industry secretary articulated a deep
sense of unease felt by many British about the new face of Europe.
   ``I think a lot of people (in the Conservative Party) will agree
with him privately, including a number of those who wouldn't have
the guts to say so publicly,'' said John Burrow, deputy chairman of
Ridley's constituency association in Cirencester and Tewkesbury.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher told the House of Commons on
Thursday that Ridley's remarks did not reflect government policy,
or her own views, but she rejected demands for his dismissal.
   Opposition Labor Party leader Neil Kinnock said Mrs. Thatcher
should recognize the interview ``is not just deeply offensive to
our allies and partners, but deeply damaging to our country's
interests, and he must go.''
   But Channel 4 News reported that a straw poll of 52 of the 372
Conservatives in the House of Commons found that 22 shared Ridley's
fears of German domination of Europe.
   Conservative lawmaker James Hill said it was timely to warn West
Germany ``that we cannot stand by ... and aid them to take over
central Europe.''
   Ridley, 61, the chain-smoking younger son of Viscount Ridley,
has survived many previous controversies because of his close
relationship with Mrs. Thatcher.
   ``I'm a great Nick Ridley fan,'' the prime minister said last
year.
   In the Spectator interview, Ridley said the West German
government's support for European monetary union ``is all a German
racket designed to take over the whole of Europe. It has to be
thwarted.
   ``This rushed take-over by the Germans on the worst possible
basis, with the French behaving like poodles to the Germans, is
absolutely intolerable,'' Ridley said.
   He also condemned the ``breath-taking arrogance'' of the
12-nation European Community, which he said was run by ``17
unelected reject politicians.''
   ``I'm not against giving up sovereignty in principle, but not to
this lot. You might just as well give it to Adolf Hitler,
frankly,'' he said.
   Spectator editor Dominic Lawson, who conducted the interview,
suggested that West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl was ``not going
to bomb us, after all.''
   Ridley replied: ``I'm not sure I wouldn't rather have ... er ...
the shelters and the chance to fight back, than simply being taken
over by ... economics.''
   Britain must play its historic role as the balance of power in
Europe, Ridley said. ``Never has it been more necessary than now,
with Germany so uppity.''
   The Spectator's cover had a cartoon of Ridley painting a Hitler
mustache on Kohl's portrait.
   Mrs. Thatcher, who returned Thursday from a summit meeting with
Kohl and other leaders of major industrial nations, told the House
of Commons that Ridley's apology should be the end of the matter.
   In Bonn, Kohl's aide Lutz Stavenhagen condemned Ridley's attack
as ``scandalous.''
   Otto Graf Lambsdorff, chairman of the Free Democrats, Kohl's
coalition partners said: ``Either he was drunk ... or he had not
yet gotten over the soccer loss of the English team against the
Germans'' in the World Cup semifinals.
   Tim Helm, a member of the European Movement which promotes
continental harmony, said Ridley's remarks reflected ``a section of
opinion which is present across Europe, not just in this country.''
   Helm, who is of German-English parentage, said it was fitting
that the issue erupted while Ridley was on a visit to Hungary,
``because clearly a number of Eastern European countries are
frightened of what they see as a Fortress Europe with an
overpowerful Germany. But all those fears are based on lack of
knowledge.''
   Lawson said he thought Ridley ``was expressing the views of many
ordinary people in the way that politicians don't.''

<HEAD>Meese Awarded Legal Fees</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Attorney General Edwin Meese III was
awarded $460,509 Thursday for legal expenses he incurred during a
special prosecutor's criminal investigation.
   Independent counsel James McKay declined to prosecute Meese at
the conclusion of the investigation, which was expanded several
times to include a variety of conflict-of-interest allegations
against the attorney general.
   The independent counsel division of the U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals ruled that the government should pay $460,509 of the
$575,598 in legal fees and costs claimed by Meese's defense
lawyers, Nathan Lewin and James Rocap.
   Among the $115,000 worth of expenses the court disallowed was a
claim of $16,652 by Meese's lawyers for time spent talking to
reporters about the case.
   Under the independent counsel law, Meese is entitled to
government reimbursement for reasonable legal fees because he was
not indicted as a result of the 14-month investigation.
   Among other things, Meese was investigated for possible ethics
law violations for intervening to help Wedtech Corp. obtain a
lucrative defense contract at a time when his longtime friend E.
Bob Wallach was a consultant for the company.
   Wallach has been convicted of racketeering in connection with
his Wedtech dealings.
   McKay found that Meese, who was counselor to President Reagan
when Wedtech won the contract, did not personally benefit from the
deal and therefore did not violate conflict-of-interest laws.
   The independent counsel also investigated Meese's failure to
divest himself of $14,000 worth of stock in regional Bell System
operating companies when he was formulating Justice Department
policy about the breakup of American Telephone &amp; Telegraph.
   McKay's investigation found probable violations of
conflict-of-interest and tax laws but declined to prosecute, saying
there was no evidence Meese was motivated by personal gain or
self-interest.
   Meese left office about a month after McKay issued his July 5,
1988, report.
   The court also refused to reimburse Meese for $6,335 for legal
bills after the filing of a response to McKay's report of the
investigation and for $5,170 he was billed to prepare to testify at
the trial of former White House aide Lyn Nofziger.
   A federal appellate court last year overturned Nofziger's
ethics-law conviction for lobbying former Reagan administration
colleagues, including Meese, on behalf of Wedtech, a labor union
and another defense contractor.
   The court also disallowed $11,311 worth of staff overtime,
$10,000 for photocopying it found excessive and $51,167 for costs
it said were not adequately documented by the lawyers.

<TEXT>
   Tamil rebels overran a Sri Lankan army
camp and killed 58 soldiers, military officials said Thursday. It
was the first major victory for the insurgents since fighting
resumed last month.
   Only two soldiers were known to have survived the assault
Wednesday night on the Kokkavil army camp, 165 miles north of
Colombo, military officials said on condition of anonymity.
   It was the first reversal for the army since Tamil rebels ended
a 13-month cease-fire on June 11 by taking over several police
stations and attacking army camps.
   Rebel mortar fire ignited gasoline tanks at the Kokkavil camp.
The rebels then launched a ground attack shielded by armor-plated
bulldozers, the officers said. They also blew up the north's main
television relay station.
   The rebels began the attack on the Kokkavil television center
Tuesday, but were initially pushed back. At least 21 guerrillas and
three soldiers died in the earlier fighting, the officials said.
   Wednesday's deaths raise to 2,300 the number of combatants
killed in the monthlong fighting.
   Many civilians also have been killed. The government, however,
denied the latest Tamil allegations that soliders massacred
townspeople in eastern Kalmunai on Tuesday.
   ``I am categorically denying a report that troops lined up and
shot 50 civilians in Kalmunai,'' Defense Secretary Gen. Cyril
Ranatunge said. ``We don't go in for that sort of thing.''
   The Tamil Tiger rebels killed 115 policemen in Kalmunai last
month as they renewed hostilities in their seven-year war for an
independent Tamil homeland.
   Deputy Defense Minister Ranjan Wijeratne accused the Tigers of
destroying public property before retreating from army attacks.
   ``They are on the run and are resorting to a scorched-earth
policy, destroying bridges, buildings, food stores and now a
television station,'' he said.
   Since 1983, the war has claimed at least 13,200 lives.
   Tamil militants say their community, which comprises 18 percent
of Sri Lanka's 16 million people, is discriminated against in jobs,
education and language by the majority Sinhalese.
   The Sinhalese, who dominate the army and government, comprise 75
percent of the population.

   The discovery of a gene causing ``Elephant
Man's Disease'' is the latest in a series of such findings for
various illnesses.
   Scientists pursue these genes in the hopes of improving
treatment and, in some cases, aiding detection of people who can
unknowingly pass the faulty genes to their offspring.
   Last August, scientists from the United States and Canada
announced they had found the gene that causes cystic fibrosis, a
devastating killer of young people that affects some 30,000
Americans.
   In 1986, scientists found the gene that causes the most common
and serious kind of muscular dystrophy, the Duchenne form. In
follow-up analysis announced the following year, researchers
identified the protein produced by the normal version of the gene.
   That revealed that Duchenne is caused by the lack of this
protein, giving clues for developing a treatment.
   Other recent studies have found that cancers of the breast, lung
and colon can appear if particular cancer-suppressing genes are
absent or malfunctioning.

<HEAD>Two New Books by Salman Rushdie to be Published</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two new books by Salman Rushdie will soon be
published, the first since his ``The Satanic Verses'' brought death
threats from Iran's late leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini,
Rushdie's publisher announced Thursday.
   Granta Books, in association with Penguin Books, said it had
acquired world English-language rights to Rushdie's novel ``Haroun
and the Sea of Stories'' and ``Imaginary Homelands,'' a collection
of essays.
   ``Haroun and the Sea of Stories,'' written for Rushdie's
adolescent son, ``is the story of a story-teller who loses the gift
of the gab until the gift is restored by his son,'' said Bill
Buford of Granta books.
   The novel is ``as full of stories as `The Arabian Nights,' from
which the principal character Haroun takes his name,'' he said. It
will be published in Britain on Sept. 27 and in the United States
next year.
   ``Imaginary Homelands,'' with 72 essays on subjects ranging from
nationalism to Britain's general election and the American short
story, will be published in Britain next spring, Buford said.
   Rushdie, a British citizen born into a Moslem family in India,
has been in hiding under police protection since Feb. 14, 1989,
when Khomeini said he deserved to die for what he called
blaspheming Islam in ``The Satanic Verses.''
   Death threats against Rushdie have hampered a restoration of
diplomatic ties between Tehran and London which were effectively
severed in June 1987 after a series of expulsions of diplomats.
   Rushdie has published poetry and several essays and reviews
since the threats against him were first made.
   Granta magazine, one of the best-selling literary magazines in
English, was started in 1979. On its 10th anniversary it launched
Granta Books, a joint venture with Penguin, the publisher of ``The
Satanic Verses.''

<HEAD>FCC Reiterates Desire for Round-the-Clock Indecency Ban</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Children are in the radio and TV audience 24
hours a day, the Federal Communications Commission said Thursday in
reiterating that it wants a total ban on ``indecent'' broadcast
programming to protect youngsters under 18.
   The commission voted 5-0 to report its conclusions to the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, which is considering
a 24-hour ban the FCC imposed under orders from Congress in 1988.
   The court last year told the commission not to enforce the
24-hour ban pending further review but said the commission could
develop evidence supporting its position.
   The FCC report could play a major role in how the appeals court
_ and, inevitably, the Supreme Court _ decides the issue.
   In essence, the FCC is now enforcing the regulations that were
in effect before Congress told the commission two years ago to ban
indecent programming round-the-clock.
   The current regulations ban obscene material at all times and
indecent material from about 6 a.m. to 8 p.m. local time. The FCC
defines ``indecent'' as language or material ``that depicts or
describes, in terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary
community standards for the broadcast medium, sexual or excretory
activities or organs.''
   Neither the current regulation nor a 24-hour ban would affect
cable television programming.
   The FCC, in its report, said a 24-hour indecency ban would
promote a ``compelling'' government interest and would be
``narrowly tailored'' to serve that interest without infringing on
broadcasters' First Amendment rights.
   The FCC said it was guided in its conclusion by a 1989 Supreme
Court ruling that used the ``compelling interest-narrowly
tailored'' argument in deciding that the government had the right
to regulate indecent telephone transmissions.
   Broadcasters and free-speech advocates, who had asked the
appeals court to prevent the FCC from implementing the
round-the-clock ban, attacked the commission's new report.
   ``It's clear that Congress doesn't want broadcasters to be able
to operate within limits guaranteed by the First Amendment, and,
sadly, the FCC is enthusiastically cooperating,'' said Andrew J.
Schwartzman, an attorney for People for the American Way, one of
the groups challenging the 24-hour ban.
   ``What adults should be able to hear or see should not be
determined by what children's needs are,'' Schwartzman added.
   ``I think it's preposterous,'' said Peggy Charren of the
Boston-based Action for Children's Television, the main plaintiff
in the court challenge. ``Protecting children from indecency should
not be the role of the FCC. That should be the role of parents.''
   Edward O. Fritts, president of the National Association of
Broadcasters, said the NAB was ``disappointed'' with the FCC's
action. ``The courts have made it clear that a 24-hour ban on
constitutionally protected speech is contrary to the First
Amendment,'' Fritts said.
   Under new chairman Alfred Sikes, the FCC has put the nation's
radio stations on notice over the last year that it will not
tolerate the broadcast of indecent programs before 8 p.m. The
commission has fined several stations already for broadcasting
sexually explicit material.
   FCC officials Thursday said the commission had received 88,000
letters complaining of indecent programming, mostly on radio.
   ``We've received a huge amount of mail ... and it seems the
public strongly supports the action we're taking today,'' Sikes
said.
   At Thursday's meeting, commissioner Ervin S. Duggan read from a
letter from a mother who said it would take a ``superhuman'' effort
for parents to monitor what their children hear on see on radio and
TV at all times.
   FCC officials repeatedly refused to speculate on what types of
TV programs could be considered indecent.

<TEXT>
   Homeless advocate Mitch Snyder faced IRS
demands for about $90,000 at the time of his apparent suicide last
week but was looking forward to turning the issue into a forum on
national priorities, friends said Thursday.
   ``We had just gotten the bill a few weeks ago,'' Carol Fennelly,
Snyder's longtime companion said. ``They have been investigating us
for two years and we had been waiting for a decision.''
   The Internal Revenue Service sent the 46-year-old Snyder a
preliminary notice, dated June 17, demanding $50,000 in back taxes
plus $40,000 in penalties to cover $150,000 he received in 1985 and
1986 from television producers for the rights to his story,
Fennelly said.
   ``We refused to respond to their silliness,'' Fennelly said.
``Obviously he did not have that kind of money, and if he did he
wouldn't give it to them.''
   ``He saw it as an opportunity to have a forum to address
national priorities,'' Fennelly said. ``Mitch used everything as a
forum.''
   Snyder was found hanged last Thursday at a homeless shelter he
helped found in northwest Washington. Police said he apparently
committed suicide.
   Attorney Jerry Kafka, who was handling the case for Snyder,
described the IRS action as a ``run-of-the-mill audit'' in its
beginning stages. IRS officials have declined to comment.
   Fennelly said the federal inquiry came after she provided
financial documents relating to the management of the Community for
Creative Non-Violence, which runs Snyder's shelter.
   Snyder had maintained he contributed all his earnings to the
group, which operated on a budget of $570,000 last year.
   Fennelly said Snyder never handled checks for the organization.
   ``Mitch didn't even sign the check,'' Fennelly said. ``Someone
always signed them for him. It has always been a joke around here _
`Will the real Mitch Snyder signature please stand up.'''
   Fennelly said Snyder ``relished the thought'' of going to trial
against the IRS.
   Kafka said, ``If Mitch has any taxable estate, they (the IRS)
could pursue that (but) my understanding is that he has none.''

   The appropriations bill continues provisions from past years
prohibiting spending federal Medicaid money for abortions for poor
women except in cases where the life of the mother is in danger.
   Abortion-rights supporters succeeded in adding language to a
similar bill last year that expanded that exception to include
Medicaid abortions for victims of rape and incest. But Bush vetoed
the bill because of the broadened abortion provisions, and the
House failed to override his veto.
   Because of parliamentary roadblocks, abortion rights lawmakers
said they probably would not attempt to add abortion provisions
when the spending bill goes to the House floor, probably next
Thursday.
   However, they said they expected the Senate to add a similar
amendment when it debates the spending bill, triggering a repeat of
the 1989 fights when the bill returns to the House for concurrence.
   The bill provides $7.6 billion for the Department of Labor in
fiscal 1991. It authorizes $135.7 billion for the Department of
Health and Human Services, $26 billion for the Department of
Education, and $1 billion for related agencies.
   The total represents a $17.3 billion increase over 1990 spending
and a $4.2 billion increase over the amount requested by Bush in
his proposed 1991 budget.
   Rep. William Natcher, D-Ky., chairman of the appropriations
subcommittee that wrote the bill, said it included money set aside
for major child care and AIDS prevention bills that are nearing
passage.
   Nearly three-quarters of the bill's money goes to mandatory
entitlement programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, welfare and other
programs, in which spending is required by previously passed law.
   It includes $43.9 billion in discretionary programs, an increase
of $5.6 billion over comparable amounts in 1990 spending and $3.2
billion more than requested by Bush.

<TEXT>
   A violent Sandinista strike that
threatened to topple President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro ended
early Thursday with her government agreeing to more major
concessions as a price of survival.
   The strike accord dilutes Mrs. Chamorro's power to trim a
bloated public payroll and to reverse what her economic advisers
see as a crippling legacy of more than a decade of leftist
Sandinista rule.
   Public employees won an immediate 43 percent raise with another
unspecified raise to come next month.
   It was the second major wage concession for Nicaragua's 65,000
government employees, who got a 100 percent raise after a May
walkout. In addition to government workers, thousands of employees
of state-run industries also stayed off the job inthe latest strike.
   In addition, the government agreed not to carry out its threat
to fire those taking part in what it had declared an illegal
walkout and to pay compensation to 800 people fired since Mrs.
Chamorro's April 25 inauguration.
   The strikers also forced the conservative government to back
down on a key part of its plan to return Nicaragua to a free-market
economy: the return of lands confiscated in the 1979 revolution.
   But the price of survival was high, and the support the army and
police gave Mrs. Chamorro appeared limited. Both were party organs
under the Sandinistas.
   Mrs. Chamorro said late Wednesday she wouldn't negotiate until
the strikers met certain conditions. But secret talks began within
hours and the accord with the Sandinista-led National Workers Front
was announced early Thursday.
   The president had said a dialogue could begin only after the
streets were clear of the barricades that had paralyzed the capital
since Sunday, strikers vacated occupied government installations
and basic public services were restored.
   Although the violence that claimed at least six lives had ended,
the capital was still a maze of paving stone barricades or their
debris when talks began and many buildings were still in the hands
of strikers.
   Managua began returning to normal Thursday, although its pocked
and scarred streets were still a motorist's nightmare. Taxis were
circulating, businesses were reopening, and the union had told
strikers to go back to work, the only concession the strikers made.
   Both sides were declaring victory in a confrontation the United
States and President Chamorro had called an attempt to destablize
her government.
   Despite her concessions, Mrs. Chamorro portrayed her government
as a winner. It had not fallen, and she and her advisers called the
army's decision not to back the strikers a triumph.
   Army and police bulldozers had removed barricades, but most
blockades were rebuilt without interference, and there were no
arrests.
   In addition to putting the brakes on returning confiscated land
to pre-revolutionary owners, the agreement opens the door to
power-sharing with workers in key industries such as textiles,
construction and transportation.
   The Sandinistas had vowed to ``govern from below'' after Mrs.
Chamorro and her coalition won the Feb. 25 general elections.
   The Sandinista party newspaper, Barricada, said Thursday the
Sandinistas were making good on that promise.
   ``Victory for the Strikers,'' a banner headline proclaimed over
news of Mrs. Chamorro's promise to negotiate a nationwide ``social
accord'' with workers and businessmen on economic reforms.
   Other concessions include a promise to establish a new national
minimum wage in September, payable in a new currency that will
trade on a par with the dollar.
   The Nicaraguan cordoba has been devalued more than 20 times
since Mrs. Chamorro inherited a bankrupt government and now goes
for about 450,000 to the dollar on the black market.
   Francisco Mayorga, the head of the Central Bank and the
architect of the government's economic program, said he hoped the
strike had reaffirmed the possibility of cooperation.
   ``We could have arrived at the same outcome without a strike,
without a confrontation, without a crisis,'' he said on Radio
Catolica.

<HEAD>Senator Says Air Force Spent $73 Million for Outmoded Battle Fax</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of a Senate panel said Thursday
the Air Force had spent $73 million on 173 facsimile machines that
are made to withstand a nuclear blast but are technologically
outdated.
   Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., questioned that spending as well as
the service's decision to buy nearly $40 million worth of spare
parts for the machines, added equipment that should last 20 years.
   ``The Air Force fax machines are a textbook example of how the
system should not work,'' Levin, who chairs the Senate Governmental
Affairs subcommittee on oversight of government management, said in
a speech on the Senate floor.
   The Air Force had no immediate comment on his allegations.
   The Senate committee found that the Air Force developed
specifications for the fax machines in 1982 but, due to design and
production problems, did not make a final production decision until
April 1989, Levin said.
   ``By that time, commercial fax technology had evolved so much
that the original specification _ which may have been at the
cutting edge of technology in the early 1980s _ was outdated even
before the machines were built,'' the senator said.
   The Navy has decided to buy an off-the-shelf machine with a
higher resolution that the Air Force's fax and at a significantly
lower cost of about $50,000 each.
   The Army has purchased a commercial machine modified to meet its
specifications without Defense Department funds. The Army machine
costs about $16,000 each, Levin said.
   The Navy and Army originally had been involved with the Air
Force in the plan to buy special fax machines.
   Criticism of the Air Force fax machines arose in November 1989
after a published report said the equipment cost the service
$421,000 apiece, a figure derived by dividing the $73 million cost
by 173.
   An Air Force spokesman, Maj. Lou Figueroa, disputed the total,
saying the service was paying $76,000 for each unit.
   He said that the machines were being purchased from Litton
Industries under a contract for $33 million and that an additional
contract for some $40 million covers ``a very extensive list'' of
diagnostic equipment, laser assemblies and paper _ which costs $100
a roll.
   The machines are designed to withstand the rigors of the
battlefield and to be used under a variety of conditions that might
be encountered in wartime, Figueroa said.
   The machines must withstand a nuclear explosion, be able to
operate after being immersed in three feet of water and function in
temperatures ranging from -25 to 125 degrees Fahrenheit, Levin said.

<HEAD>Report Says IGs Had Successful Investigations</HEAD>

   Federal inspectors general initiated 5,639
successful prosecutions and recovered $726.9 million as a result of
investigations of fraud and abuse during fiscal year 1989, a
presidential panel said Thursday.
   The President's Council on Integrity and Efficiency, which
coordinates activities of the watchdogs assigned to government
agencies, said the prosecutions resulted from investigations of
contractors, program participants and government employees.
   Some of the investigations were conducted by the inspectors
general independently and some in cooperation with other federal
and non-federal agencies.
   The largest number of prosecutions, 1,444, involved the Defense
Department. The Department of Health and Human Services was next,
with 1,278.
   In the nine years since the council was established, there have
been 32,902 successful prosecutions, the report said.
   The report said the money was in the form of recoveries made
during an investigation, legally ordered fines and penalties,
restitutions and out-of-court settlements. The Defense Department
accounted for $472.9 million of the total.
   In addition, the report said that 2,851 disbarments, exclusions
and suspensions were taken during the fiscal year as a result of
fraudulent or abusive practices by individuals and companies doing
business with the federal government.
   It said 2,514 personnel actions ranging from firings to
reprimands and demotions were taken against federal employees.
   Administrative penalties for fraudulent claims or statements
totaled $115.6 million, the council said.
   It also estimated that recommendations by inspectors general
resulted in $48.7 million in savings and avoidance of unnecessary
expenditures.

   Boris N. Yeltsin once persuaded his entire
fifth-grade class to jump out the window. On Thursday, 50 years
later, he threw down a similar challenge to 18 million Soviet
Communists.
   ``I have to obey the will of the people...'' Yeltsin told nearly
4,700 Communists at a Kremlin congress as he began what could
become an exodus of radical reformers and angry workers from the
ruling party.
   In quitting, Yeltsin cited his duties as the newly elected
president of the Russian Federation, the largest Soviet republic,
which he has pledged to free of the ``diktat'' of central Communist
and government rule.
   The mostly hard-line delegates, who sat in stoney silence as
Yeltsin approached the podium to deliver his suprise announcement,
shouted ``Shame!'' and whistled in derision as he strode out of the
Kremlin Palace of Congresses.
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who holds the top jobs in the central
government and party, watched impassively as Yeltsin rose to
challenge him for control of the reform movement.
   Leaving the party does not mean leaving the Kremlin for Yeltsin,
who in May was elected chairman or president of the Russian Supreme
Soviet, the legislature that meets regularly in the Great Kremlin
Palace.
   Last month, Yeltsin persuaded the Russian legislature to pass a
resolution on sovereignty, declaring its intention to remain within
the Soviet Union but take over much of the decision-making power of
central authorities.
   Yeltsin gambled and lost before, at a closed Communist Party
meeting in late 1987, when he criticized the slow pace of reforms.
As a result, he lost his job as party leader in Moscow and was
bounced from his non-voting membership in the Communist Party
Politburo.
   The 59-year-old Siberian with a shock of silver hair and a
booming voice fought his way back to the top, winning election to
the national parliament last year, then gaining the newly created
Russian presidency six weeks ago.
   Yeltsin's spectacular departure from the party seemed likely to
transform the defections from the party from a trickle into a river.
   Coal miners throughout the nation staged a one-day strike on
Wednesday, urging workers to quit the party. And members of the
radical reformist Democratic Platform also announced their intent
to leave.
   It was not clear how many of the Communist Party's 18 million
members would exit, but a sizeable movement seemded likely to rally
around Yeltsin, who has described himself as a lifelong maverick.
   ``I was the ringleader, always devising some mischief,'' he
wrote in his recent autobiography, ``Against the Grain.''
   His aspirations to leadership are based on a long history of
persuading others to join in sometimes mischievous adventures.
   As a schoolboy in the Ural Mountains, where European Russia
turns into Siberia, Yeltsin persuaded his entire fifth-grade class
to jump out the window when their unpopular teacher left the room.
The room was on the first floor, Yeltsin persuaded the headmaster
to forgive the class, and all ended well.
   But Yeltsin's mischievous side has provided his opponents with
ample material to embarrass him, and deepened the conviction among
some Soviets that Yeltsin is not always in control of himself _ a
potentially dangerous quality in a national leader.
   Last year Pravda, a publication of the Soviet Communist Party,
ran a report accusing him of drinking heavily during a trip to the
United States, especially before a speech in Baltimore.
   Yeltsin claimed he was under the influence of jet lag, not
bourbon, but the mud stuck.
   In another widely publicized incident, he insinuated that
government agents pushed him off a bridge into a river near Moscow.
   Yeltsin acknowledges that he has undergone a transformation,
from an old-style party boss into a firebrand populist, a change he
says reflects the changes sweeping the country as a whole.
   Before Gorbachev rose to power in March 1985, Yeltsin was the
party leader in Sverdlovsk in the Urals, a virtual dictator over
one of the most important centers of the Soviet defense industry.
   In a speech Friday at the 28th Communist Party congress, Yeltsin
warned delegates that if they did not change their attitude, they
could go the way of dictators swept from power last fall in other
socialist countries.
   ``If you think there is a different possibility, look at the
fate of the Communist Parties of Eastern Europe,'' Yeltsin said.
Those parties, he said, ``separated themselves from the people,
didn't understand their role, and were left on the side of the
road.''
   Gorbachev had sought to avoid the split in the party by
accelerating the reforms. Under his guidance, the party last winter
relinquished its constitutionally guaranteed monopoly on power.
   So far, no nationwide political organization has emerged to
challenge the party, but that could change quickly.
   Leading members of the radical reformist Democratic Platform,
who balked at fulfilling their pledge to quit the party, announced
shortly after Yeltsin that they, too, were quitting the party.
   Yeltsin has said he will use his government post to divest the
Communists of their wealth.
   ``It is an illusion to think that after all dissenters, all who
do not wish to be drive belts and cogs of the apparatus, quit the
party, it will retain all the property of the Soviet Communist
Party and the associated authority,'' he said Friday. As president
of Russia, he is in a strong position to strip the party of much of
that wealth.

   The American Civil Liberties Union said
Thursday that it wants the Justice Department to drop a request for
information from a group lobbying to suspend military aid to El
Salvador.
   The Justice Department last month asked the National Agenda for
Peace in El Salvador to describe the nature of its ``activities for
or in the interests of'' the rebel FMLN and whether its activities
were financed or directed by a foreign organization.
   The federal law requiring registration of foreign agents does
not give the department the right to ask those questions, ACLU
official Morton Halperin said at a news conference.
   National Agenda was formed at the 1988 Democratic National
Convention by a group of delegates seeking to bring visibility to
the issue of U.S. military aid to El Salvador.
   Geoffrey Thale, head of the three-person National Agenda staff
based here, said the group did not receive money from anyone in El
Salvador.
   ``Our view clearly is that we're not foreign agents,'' Thale
said.
   The Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, known as the FMLN
after its initials in Spanish, is the principal opponent of the El
Salvador government in the decade-old civil war.
   The Justice Department said a May newspaper advertisement by the
group ``indicates that you are engaged in publicity activities on
behalf of'' the FMLN.
   The ad called on Congress to withdraw military aid to El
Salvador as a way to force a political solution to the war and to
force action against those responsible for the murders of six
Jesuit priests and their housekeeper and her daughter last year.
   Reps. Robert W. Kastenmeier, D-Wis., and Don Edwards, D-Calif.,
said in a letter to Attorney General Dick Thornburgh that there
were nothing in the ad ``to indicate that the group is engaged in
activities on behalf of any foreign principal.''
   The letter from Kastenmeier and Edwards, released by the ACLU,
asked Thornburgh for information about the inquiry.
   Doug Tillett, a spokesman for the Justice Department, described
the request as ``fairly routine'' and said he didn't believe the
department would withdraw it.
   ``It sounds to me like an over-reaction on their part,'' he said.

<HEAD>U.S. Scraps Tests for Chemical Weapons</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has canceled
plans to test chemical weapons as a result of the recent
U.S.-Soviet agreement to destroy the deadly armaments in the
future, a Pentagon spokesman said Thursday.
   ``All of these decisions are in keeping with our intent to get
ready for the bilateral destruction agreement with the Soviet
Union,'' spokesman Pete Williams said.
   The agreement, signed June 1 by President Bush and Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev, must still be ratified by the
legislatures of the two countries, expected next year.
   But Cheney is making decisions in preparation for the agreement,
Williams said. The defense chief has made cuts in the 1991 budget
being debated in Congress.
   Specifically, Williams said Cheney has:
   _Eliminated money for production of the Bigeye bomb and canceled
testing for the Navy's technically troubled program that has been
scheduled for this fall.
   _Decided not to ask for production money for the Army's
155-millimeter artillery shell.
   _Opted to end testing of the Army's multiple launch rocket
system after technical aspects are checked out.
   ``Once we get a good set of data on how that works, we will stop
the program, and there will be no production funds requested for
that _ simply research and development funds to finish that
analysis and testing program,'' said Williams.
   While plans are under way to scrap chemical weapons, Williams
said some will remain in the arsenal ``simply to maintain a small
part of our deterrent capability because we believe that is a
prudent thing to do insofar as chemical weapons are concerned,'' he
said.
   In money terms, Cheney is eliminating $66.7 million from the
Bigeye bomber; $74.3 million from the artillery shell program and
$27.8 million from the MLRS program.
   But Williams said money will be needed after when the chemical
weapons programs are killed because ``it takes some money to cancel
a contract. ... You can't just call up a contractor and say, `I'm
sorry, never mind.'''
   Williams said the Defense Department will continue to buy a
chemicals used in the binary weapons _ weapons that use two
harmless chemicals that are dangerous only when combined _ in order
to finish testing at a plant in Pine Bluff, Ark.
   Officials want to make sure they can produce binary weapons in
case the United States ``should need it, should something go wrong
with the treaty.''
   On a related matter, Williams said U.S. officials have
temporarily stopped verification tests at the Johnston Atoll
chemical agent disposal system, about 700 miles southwest of Hawaii.
   ``They want to take stock of what has happened so far,''
Williams said, adding there were ``some positive monitor'' readings
after a chemical weapons test.
   Officials want to make sure the monitors are working properly,
he said. Tests are expected to resume at the end of the week.

<HEAD>CNN Experiments With Interactive TV on Late-Night Newscast</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURAN NEERGAARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Viewers who grumble that the only news on TV is
bad news soon will be able to choose some of the stories they want
to see on Cable News Network.
   CNN announced Thursday the first experiment in ``interactive
news'' by a national network _ a program similar to ones by smaller
stations where viewers vote on whether to see ``Godzilla'' or
``Planet of the Apes'' as the late-night movie.
   The experiment begins July 23 on CNN's ``Newsnight,'' an
hour-long newscast at midnight. The choices will involve secondary
news or features.
   Viewers will see a summary of headlines at the beginning of the
show and, as anchors read the day's top news, dial a 900 telephone
number to vote on which of the stories they'd like to see. The
stories that get the most votes, which cost 95 cents per call, will
be shown.
   CNN officials emphasize that viewers won't be dictating news
value but will tell the network what areas, outside of breaking
news, most interest them.
   ``We're not going to let viewers decide the editorial policy of
CNN,'' said spokesman John Bianchi. ``A lot of stuff does not make
it on the air that we do in fact cover. This is a way to get more
of the stuff on the air that we might not have made the decision on
initially.''
   Bianchi said CNN, which had trouble filling all its newscasts
when it was started by media mogul Ted Turner in 1980, just doesn't
have enough time now to air all the stories it would like to. So
viewers _ in 54 million U.S. households and 90 countries _ are
being asked to let producers know their preferences.
   ``We can tell by the volume and quality of viewer phone calls
and letters we receive each day that CNN has very informed
viewers,'' said CNN Senior Executive Bob Furnad. ``This new
interactive segment will allow those viewers to tell us in a
relatively direct fashion the kinds of information they most want.''
   At least one of CNN's network competitors reacted with surprise
to the announcement. Asked if the concept would spread to the Big
Three networks, CBS spokesman Tom Goodman said, ``It doesn't sound
like something we'd get involved in.''
   The public relations departments at NBC and ABC offered no
immediate response.
   Interactive television, a concept of two-way communication
between viewers and programmers with TV remote controls, emerged in
the early 1980s.
   CNN's concept ``is not exactly the promise of interactivity
where you can really customize your TV viewing on what you want to
see,'' said media analyst Betsy Frank with Saatchi &amp; Saatchi in New
York. ``But using 900-line technology to a certain degree and
having people feel they have a decision-making posture in what gets
aired _ it's an interesting idea.''
   Ms. Frank said the phone-in concept is not new _ networks like
Fox have used it for viewers to vote on movie lineups.
   ``The trend of the last decade is viewers assuming more control
and taking it away from the three networks,'' she said, adding that
CNN could raise its ratings with the experiment. ``The more
involved the viewer, the more likely he is to hang around.''
   Warner Amex Cable Communications Inc. developed the first
interactive technology, called ``Qube,'' in Ohio in 1981. In one
experiment, cable subscribers electronically registered their
reactions to a speech by then-President Carter by responding to
questions on remote, book-sized consoles hooked to their
televisions.
   ACTV Domestic Corp. then developed technology, tested in a
eight-week experiment on Continental Cablevision in Massachusetts,
in which viewers of a golf tournament chose which player they
wanted to see. The camera followed that player through the course.

   A bit of Americana slipped into history
Thursday when the nation's last known operating hand-cranked,
party-line telephone system was disconnected _ replaced by
private-line, touch-tone technology.
   ``Now that I know it's working, I'm going to call my mother back
in Iowa,'' said Joyce Rinehart at the Ramshead motel and
restaurant. ``This is the first time I've talked on a phone like
this in a long time where I could hear and not have to shout.''
   ``I'm not screaming anymore,'' said Garry Pedrow as he answered
the first incoming call on the new system at his Shoup Country
Store near North Fork in central Idaho's rugged Salmon River
canyon. ``It's sure nice.''
   The depression-era, single-line, ring-down system, a fixture of
rural America in decades past, had been the link to the rest of the
world for the 18 year-round canyon residents.
   Parties on the line could crank the magneto to ring others along
the line or the central office for a connection to town numbers and
long-distance. Each customer had a coded ring and supposedly
answered just that ring while ignoring the rest.
   Operator Steve Freestone handled the last outgoing call from the
old system at the switchboard of his Motel Deluxe in Salmon 20
miles away and then announced the old line was dead.
   A half hour later, state Public Utilities Commission President
Joe Miller placed the first call on the new system to Gary Byrne,
head of the Rural Electrification Administration, which underwrote
the $350,000 modernization.
   ``We're moving into our second century,'' said Miller, referring
to Idaho's centennial on July 3. ``It's time for as much of our
state as possible to be connected to the rest of the world in a
meaningful way.''
   The demise of the battery and magneto system was set a year ago
when AT&amp;T said computerization would require the elimination of the
local operator.
   Freestone and the operators preceding him connected calls from
canyon customers to the proper numbers outside and routed incoming
calls to the right phone, using a series of coded rings. The Shoup
Country Store was three longs.
   AT&amp;T, US WEST and Century Telephone Co. in Salmon agreed to keep
the operator in place until installation of the new system.
   Residents along the wilderness river had mixed feelings about
losing a system they felt fit in well with a lifestyle that
includes only seasonal running water and requires private
generators for electricity.
   ``It's historic, ... but when you're in business you need a town
phone system,'' said Rinehart at the Ramshead motel and restaurant
about 30 miles down the canyon.
   The crank system was originally set up by the U.S. Forest
Service in 1931. It was bought by the resident cooperative called
the North Fork Telephone Corp. for a dollar in 1952 when the
government switched to radio communications. The years had taken
their toll.
   ``It's a raggedy old thing,'' Freestone said. ``They've got it
nailed to trees and mountains. Most of the time you have to yell
pretty loud to talk to people down river.''
   In their heyday, the wall-mounted units with a black metal
mouthpiece on an arm and a receiver hung on a two-prong hook on the
left side were the communications heart of as many as 1.25 million
American farms and ranches.
   Party line chatter, with two or three parties talking and
several more secretly listening, was a popular rural recreation,
long before electricity, television and even radio.
   Pedrow said the canyon residents are keeping a few of the hand
crank phones hooked together for the historic value, an idea
whole-heartedly endorsed by Rinehart.
   ``I'd just like to keep them around to show the younger
generation what we had to use,'' she said. ``On this old system
I've talked to the Marshall Islands. I've talked to Canada. I've
talked to Hawaii. So that old line did reach out.''

<HEAD>FCC Says Consumers Paying Too Much For International Calls</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. consumers are paying as much as $1
billion too much annually for international telephone calls, the
Federal Communications Commission said Thursday in proposing to
make it easier for U.S. carriers to negotiate lower rates with
overseas phone companies.
   The commission said U.S. phone companies in 1988 paid $2 billion
more to foreign _ usually government-operated _ phone companies
than they collected from foreign carriers for international calls.
   About half that amount represented an overpayment by U.S.
consumers to foreign carriers, the FCC said.
   Intense competition among U.S. phone companies since the 1984
breakup of the Bell system has pushed prices down for international
calls, but has resulted in foreign companies gaining a larger share
of the charges for such calls, FCC Chairman Alfred Sikes said
before the commission's 5-0 vote.
   ``Competition and technological progress in telecommunications
has revealed a cartel-like pricing and profit-sharing
arrangement,'' Sikes said. ``U.S. subscribers and those in a
handful of other countries are both the winners and losers.''
   Companies such as AT&amp;T negotiate ``accounting rates'' that
determine how AT&amp;T and a foreign company will divide the charges
consumers pay for international calls. Under present formulas,
about 75 cents of every dollar collected by U.S. carriers for
international calls goes to foreign carriers.
   AT&amp;T contends foreign governments are charging far above the
actual cost of service, and that because more calls flow from the
United States to other countries than in the reverse direction,
having accounting rates that exceed costs results in a significant
outflow of U.S. dollars to other nations.
   Some overseas phone carriers use the funds to finance local
service and say it is vital to their economies.
   AT&amp;T argues that what foreign entities will lose in lower
accounting rates, they will more than make up in the increased
volume of calling resulting from lower prices.
   The FCC proposed to allow U.S. companies to negotiate lower
accounting rates more quickly. The commission also proposed to
lower the accounting rates itself, if it finds that costs are too
high.
   AT&amp;T welcomed the commission's proposal.
   Company spokesman Herb Linnen said the proposal ``sets up the
possibility of lowering accounting rates for all of the U.S.
carriers, and that can translate into savings for consumers.''

   Here is the text of the Nicaraguan
strike settlement as translated from Spanish by The Associated
Press:
   1. Considering the need to reestablish social tranquility and a
climate of confidence that is needed to foster reactivation of the
economy, the government of Nicaragua, represented by the Employment
and Salary Commission, met with a delegation of the National
Workers' Front (FNT) July 11, 1990.
   After a presentation to the government by the labor leaders, the
government of Nicaragua communicates the following:
   First: It has made the following decisions to be effective
immediately:
   _ It will apply in the present month of July a general
adjustment of 43 percent to budgeted salaries.
   This adjustment will be paid July 25.
   At the same time it is established that in the month of August a
salary increase for the budgeted sector will be established
according to the economic capacity of the government. This
emphasizes the need to help the majority of the lowest-paid workers.
   _ An environment of confidence and labor stability will be
strengthened for public servants of the central government,
autonomous organizations and state-run businesses.
   All workers who return normally to their jobs will have the
right to continue in them.
   _ Meanwhile, the Civil Service Law is changed so that public
sector workers fired after April 26, 1990, will get an indemnity
equal to a month's salary for each year worked up to three months.
Cases in which special agreements or arrangements have been reached
are excepted.
   _ Transportation tokens to all workers and students who now get
them are guaranteed.
   _ (The government) will pay the debts the Transportation and
Construction Ministry owes to businesses.
   _ With relation to Law 90-10, the Ministry of Agriculture and
Livestock has reviewed all rental requests, which were made public
in separate lists and ended the application of said law. As the
rental contracts contemplate, (businesses) will push for stability
and more rights for workers on rented productive lands.
   _ Reclassification of job categories by the state to take effect
in September of this year will proceed.
   Second: The following points will be studied and analyzed:
   _ In problems existing in some branches of industry, especially
in textiles, construction, metals, public transport and other
branches of the economy (mining, timber, fishing, etc.) a program
will be put in practice requiring industrial reactivation and
rehabilitation, the immediate objective of which will be to
maintain jobs for the workers in these areas. To bring this about a
mixed commission will be organized among government representatives
and those of the FTN, which will be installed Monday, July 16,
giving priority to the textile industry.
   _ Within the framework of tripartism, a commission will be
formed made up of employers, unions and the government to prepare a
proposal for a minimum wage law that will be presented to the
National Assembly in September at the latest. The minimum wage will
be expressed in gold cordobas.
   Third: The government ratifies entirely its extension of an
agreement reached with the FNT May 16, 1990, which includes:
   _ The application of national agreements with their respective
additions and rules signed with the Education Ministry, the
National Association of Nicaraguan Educators and the Health
Ministry, the Federation of Health Workers and will not change them.
   _ The commitment on regulations for the Civil Service Law. Any
modification of this agreement will be discussed in advance and
approved by the parties.
   Fourth: Representatives of the FNT who sign the present
communique express:
   _ Taking into consideration resolutions that the government of
Nicaragua makes public in this communique, pledge that the workers
and employees will return normally to their work July 12 of this
year. They also pledge to respect the normality and public order in
the entire country.
   _ Their willingness to promote the resumption of productive work
in the agriculture and livestock sector and to reestablish the
climate of tranquility and labor stability that is required to
fulfill production goals.
   _ Their satisfaction over the government's statements that it
will take no reprisals against workers and employees who return to
their jobs normally beginning July 12.
   In concluding the conversations, which were held in a climate of
understanding, both parties pledge to maintain a fluid and
permanent communication on the economic problems for the purpose of
contributing to reactivation of production and national
reconstruction.
   In the city of Managua, the 11th day of the month of July of
1990.
   Signed: (for the government)
   Antonio Lacayo, minister of the presidency
   Francisco Rosales, minister of labor
   Silvio De Franco, minister of the economy
   Emilio Pereira, minister of finances
   Francisco Mayorga, minister-director of the Central Bank of
Nicaragua

<HEAD>Ag Department Says Wheat Farmers Harvesting Bumper Crop</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wheat farmers are harvesting a bumper crop
estimated at 2.7 billion bushels, up 33 percent from last year and
the biggest output in six years, the Agriculture Department said
Thursday.
   ``This would be the largest crop since 1982 and the third
largest on record,'' the department said in a report.
   And it will be a near-record production at that. Records show
the biggest U.S. wheat crops were back-to-back in 1981 with 2.79
billion bushels and 1982 with 2.77 billion.
   New production estimates for the first time this season included
durum and other spring-planted wheat, in addition to winter wheat
planted last fall.
   The department's Agricultural Statistics Board said the average
yield, based on indications as of July 1, was estimated at 38.6
bushels per acre, compared with 32.8 bushels last year.
   Farmers are expected to harvest about 70 million acres of wheat
this year, also the most since 1982. The 1989 crop was from 62.1
million harvested acres.
   The department's first official estimate of 1990 corn, soybeans
and some other major spring-planted crops will be issued Aug. 9,
along with an updated estimate of wheat production.
   Winter wheat production was estimated at 2.04 billion bushels,
down 3 percent from the June forecast but up 40 percent from the
1989 harvest. Winter wheat makes up about three-fourths of the U.S.
total.
   Yields in many of the winter wheat states are down from the June
forecast, especially in Illinois and Missouri, the report said. The
huge Kansas crop, at 460.2 million bushels, was unchanged from last
month.
   Durum wheat production was estimated at 114 million bushels, up
24 percent from last year, and other spring wheat was indicated at
549 million bushels, up 12 percent from 1989.
   North Dakota, the biggest durum producer, was estimated at 97.6
million bushels, compared with 66 million bushels last year. The
state's production of ``other'' spring wheat, also the largest, was
estimated at 254.4 million bushels, up from 174 million in 1989.
   Government crop watchers said earlier this week that the
nation's wheat harvest was 71 percent completed by July 8, slightly
ahead of the five-year average for this time.
   The July report also estimated barley production at 414 million
bushels, up 3 percent from last year. Yields were indicated at 53.4
bushels per acre, up 4.9 bushels from 1989.
   Oats production was estimated at 375 million bushels, virtually
the same as last year, with average yields at 60.2 bushels per
acre, compared with last season's 54.4 bushels.
   Flue-cured tobacco production was forecast at 856 million
pounds, up 6 percent from last year, reflecting a larger acreage.
   In a related supply-and-demand report, ``highly tentative''
projections of 1990 production of corn showed the fall harvest
might total 7.85 billion bushels.
   That would be down from the 8.1 billion bushels projected in
June, but still larger than the 1989 harvest of 7.53 billion
bushels.
   ``Among many contributing factors are late plantings in parts of
the Corn Belt, an extended period of hot, dry weather in the South
and slightly less planted area than indicated (by a survey) in
March,'' the report said.
   Soybean production also was projected down _ 1.86 billion
bushels against 1.93 billion projected in June. Last year's output
was about 1.93 billion bushels, about what had been projected in
June for 1990.
   The analysis showed wheat prices at the farm in 1990-91 may
average in the range of $2.80 to $3.20 per bushel, down 10 cents
from the June forecast. Last season, wheat prices averaged $3.72
per bushel.
   Corn prices, reflecting tighter supplies, were projected to
average $2.50 to $2.90 per bushel in the 1990-91 marketing year, up
15 cents from June. They are expected to be in the range of $2.35
to $2.40 in 1989-90.
   Soybean prices were projected at $5.50 to $6.75 per bushel, a
50-cent increase from the range last month. The 1989-90 price was
estimated at $5.70 per bushel.
   Cotton production was projected at 15 million bales, down 1
million bales from the June outlook, primarily because of
``extremely hot, dry conditions which have reduced prospective
harvested acreage and trimmed potential yields in Texas,'' the
report said.
   No price information was projected for 1990-91 cotton.

   The shifting sands of this beach resort
foiled an attempt to build the world's largest sand sculpture.
   When officials from the Guinness Book of World Records arrived
to measure the mammoth castle, they found the top had crumbled
slightly _ leaving it 2 inches short of the record of 56 feet, 2
inches.
   ``We built the mound up to 60 feet high, but we made it too
steep at the top,'' said Adam Showell, project coordinator for
Sandcastle Fest 90. ``You can't make sand stand straight up.''
   As a result, some sand fell during carving. Guinness only
allowed one chance last Friday, so the builders could not add 2
inches and have it remeasured, he said.
   Gerry Kirk and a team from San Diego-based Sand Sculptors
International, which also built the world record sand sculpture in
Kaseda, Japan, oversaw the Ocean City project.
   ``We were short of the world record, but it is still the tallest
sand sculpture ever built in the United States,'' Showell said.
   Thousands attended the sand castle festival, which will be held
again next year.

   Populist Boris N. Yeltsin quit the Communist Party
on Thursday in a move that could start the exodus of liberals that
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has warned could destroy his reform
movement.
   Yeltsin's dramatic announcement to the 28th Communist Party
congress capped a day in which his orthodox Marxist foe, Yegor K.
Ligachev, was vanquished in a bid for the party's No. 2 job.
   For more than two years, Gorbachev has balanced the party
between liberals, led by Yeltsin, and hard-liners led by Ligachev.
The departure of Gorbachev's two antagonists marked a triumph for
Gorbachev's centrist politics.
   But it could prove a hollow victory. Yeltsin took with him some
of the most reform-minded party members. Leaders of the Democratic
Platform reform movement announced they would follow Yeltsin out of
the party and form a rival group.
   Other delegates who favor Yeltsin's demands for faster and more
radical economic reforms were thought likely to follow. It would be
the first split in the Communist Party since 1921.
   Yeltsin, elected president of the Russian republic in May on the
strength of his populist program, became the first non-Communist
leader of that huge territory in 72 years of Soviet power.
   The burly, white-haired reformer strode down the center aisle to
the podium in the Kremlin Palace of Congresses and read without
emotion from a sheet of paper to a silent audience.
   He said that as newly elected president of Russia he could no
longer obey only the policies of the Communist Party.
   ``In connection with my election as the chairman (president) of
the Supreme Soviet of Russia and my great responsibility before the
people of Russia, taking into account the transition of society to
a multiparty system, I cannot fulfill only the decisions of the
Communist Party,'' he said.
   ``I have to obey the will of the people and their all-powerful
representatives,'' he said. ``Therefore in connection with my
obligations, I declare my exit from the party.''
   Yeltsin's announcement was greeted with some applause, whistles
of derision, and shouts of ``Shame!'' He left the podium and walked
out of the congress hall without further comment.
   Yeltsin said he had planned to make the announcement after the
congress, but was forced to do it earlier because he was nominated
for the party's Central Committee, which will be elected before the
congress adjourns.
   Gorbachev brought Yeltsin to Moscow in 1985 from the Ural
Mountain industrial center of Sverdlovsk, but fired him as Moscow
party boss two years later for criticizing the slow pace of reform.
   Yeltsin rebounded by launching a populist campaign against
Gorbachev, and tops the Soviet leader in popularity in some polls.
   Gorbachev said Yeltsin's resignation would not be discussed at
the congress, but otherwise showed no reaction.
   Outside the hall, however, one prominent military official
called Yeltsin's actions disgraceful.
   Marshal Nikolai Ogarkov said Yeltsin made a ``shameful speech.''
   The Communist Party helped Yeltsin ``and suddenly he throws it
up and leaves it,'' Ogarkov said.
   Yeltsin's resignation led the Soviet evening television news
program ``Vremya.'' The announcer declared the resignation a
``sensation.''
   Vyacheslav Shostakovsky, a leader of Democratic Platform, took
the floor and said he and other reform-minded delegates, including
Leningrad Mayor Anatoly Sobchak, Yuri Boldyrev of Leningrad and
Vladimir Lysenko of Moscow were leaving the party.
   He did not say exactly how many leaving the party, but said they
would form their own independent organization.
   Delegates began applauding in the middle of his statement in an
effort to cut him off.
   ``I am empowered to declare a division in the Communist Party,
and our intention to form an independent, democratic, parliamentary
party,'' Shostakovsky said.
   He urged delegates not to turn in their party cards, but to
register with the Democratic Platform, apparently in order to later
lay claim to Communist Party property.
   Vladimir Filin, a spokesman for Democratic Platform, estimated
that only about 15 percent of Democratic Platform members would
remain in the Communist Party.
   According to the organization's polls, about 40 percent of the
party's 18 million members support the Democratic Platform.
   Gorbachev said as he opened the congress that unity was
essential among reformers. ``If perestroika fails, it will be
because someone succeeds in splitting the pro-perestroika forces,''
he said.
   He and his advisers have preached unity throughout the congress'
10 days, and until Thursday it seemed to be working. The congress
was scheduled to continue Friday.
   Ligachev pledged to stand by the Communist Party, despite his
drubbing by Gorbachev's choice, Vladimir A. Ivashko, for the
party's new No. 2 job.
   Asked to comment on the speech by Yeltsin, his long-time foe,
Ligachev hinted that the party would be better off without him.
   ``There are people who, in leaving the party, could strengthen
it,'' he said. ``For me for example, if I left the party, it would
be political death.''
   Ligachev admitted he had no chance of remaining on the party's
ruling Politburo, where he has been Gorbachev's leading critic
among the hard-liners.
   ``There's no need for it,'' he said. His name also did not
appear on the list of 311 party members nominated by the 15
republics for the policy-making Central Committee. However, it was
not clear whether he was among 85 others nominated by Gorbachev and
the central leadership.

   Comedian Jon Lovitz, the saturnine ``Saturday
Night Live'' cast member who potrayed a pathological liar with the
catch phrase ``That's the ticket,'' is leaving the show.
   Lovitz joined the show in 1985 and had a five-year contract as a
member of the ``SNL'' company, NBC announced late Wednesday.
   His other, recurring comedic bits included an impression of
playwright Harvey Fierstein as an affection-starved talk show host,
and as himself, jovially urging viewers to ``Get to know me!''
   In May, when fellow cast member Nora Dunn boycotted the show
hosted by raunch comedian Andrew Dice Clay, Lovitz played Satan in
a parody of ``It's a Wonderful Life,'' showing that Dunn's boycott
saved her from a tragic death.
   ``He has an enormous gift, and his talent contributed greatly to
the success of the show,'' the program's executive producer, Lorne
Michaels, said. ``He was always punctual and worked well with
others. I would recommend him to any other producer without
hesitation.
   ``I am sad to see him move on, and I wish him all the best in
his work in the future. He will always be welcome here.''
   NBC said Lovitz could be reached only through his Los
Angeles-based manager, Brad Gray, who did not return phone calls
from The Associated Press.

<HEAD>Officials Say Oil-Eating Microbes Worked in Mega Borg Tests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURA TOLLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oil-eating microbes dumped on a slick from a
leaking tanker in the Gulf of Mexico apparently did their job:
gobbling up oil without hurting the environment, officials said
Thursday.
   State Land Commissioner Garry Mauro and Texas Water Commission
Chairman B.J. ``Buck'' Wynne said that while more testing is
needed, there is enough evidence to push for expanded use of the
process called bioremediation.
   ``We have strong evidence that bioremediation works,'' Mauro
told a news conference. ``The results show that we are close to
having a tool that actually cleans up oil spills.''
   The microbes were tested after the Norwegian tanker Mega Borg
exploded June 8 and burned 57 miles off Galveston. An estimated 3.9
million gallons of light crude leaked into the Gulf.
   Much of the oil burned, but some created a slick that appeared
headed toward the Texas coast.
   Skimmers and booms were deployed, but Mauro and Wynne pushed to
test the microbes. The test, done first on about 40 acres of the
spill and again on a smaller patch, was not a major part of the
cleanup.
   Mauro and Wynne said Thursday there is no evidence the microbes
caused any environmental damage.
   Both said the microbes should be used again on the next
significant oil spill, and should be tested on smaller spills near
the Texas coast.
   The test on the Mega Borg spill marked the first time the
microbes were used in open waters. Bioremediation had been used
before to clean up hazardous waste sites, extract oil from tight
geologic formations, and clean some rocks on shore after the Exxon
Valdez spill in Alaska last year.
   The naturally occurring bacteria reduce the oil to an emulsion
of fatty acids, which sinks and is eaten by fish. When the oil is
gone, the microbes die.
   ``We found surface oil was reduced after the application, and we
found no similar reduction in the control slick,'' Mauro said. The
surface oil in some samples was ``reduced to 30 percent of the
original volume,'' he said.
   Wynne and Mauro conceded that weather and currents may have
helped disperse the oil, but were confident the microbes did their
duty.
   ``The best that anything else in our oil spill response arsenal
can do is mitigate disaster,'' Mauro said.
   The next step, he said, is persuading companies to include
bioremediation in their oil spill contingency plans.

<HEAD>California Board Adopts Rules to Protect Owls, Reduce Timber
Harvesting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA CRUZ, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Loggers can't harvest parts of
privately owned forests where threatened spotted owls live, under
rules adopted by a state panel. The decision could make California
the first state to officially protect the species.
   Timber industry leaders immediately blasted Wednesday's decision
by the state Board of Forestry that could cut logging in Northern
California in half and could cost up to 1,900 jobs.
   ``I'm here representing the 25,000 people who are going to be
out of work because of your decision today,'' said Gil Murray, of
the Timber Association of California.
   Environmentalists supported the decision because it protects old
growth Redwood trees where spotted owls have been found, but they
said a harvesting moratorium is needed.
   ``We've got to become the first state to shut the door on this
destruction to preserve jobs, forests and a healthy planet,'' said
Mark Heitchue, a Santa Cruz member of the environmental group Earth
First!
   The regulations would take effect July 23 if they are approved
by the state's office of administrative law. The rules would be in
effect during the next three months until a more comprehensive
protection plan is approved.
   In June, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service put the spotted owl
on the threatened species list, setting up the battle between the
timber industry and environmentalists.
   The regulations, which apply to all counties north of Marin,
don't ban logging entirely within areas where the owl lives. But
landowners won't be allowed to cut timber within 1.5 miles of where
a spotted owl has been seen.
   Ross Johnson, chief of forest practice regulations for the
California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, estimated
timber yields will decrease from 35 percent to 50 percent under the
temporary rules.
   It could cost between 968 and 1,901 jobs in lumber and related
industries, depending on how the rules are enforced, he said.
   Biologists estimate that about 5,000 pairs of spotted owls have
survived recent years of clear-cutting of old growth forests in
Washington, Oregon and California.

<HEAD>Lawmakers Allege Some U.S. Subsidiaries Are Dodging Taxes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrats and Republicans took turns Thursday
decrying alleged tax dodging by U.S. subsidiaries of foreign
corporations, but the Treasury Department would not concede there
is wholesale cheating.
   ``I propose we're talking about billions _ in the range of $30
billion'' a year in tax avoidance, said Rep. J.J. Pickle, D-Texas,
chairman of the House Ways and Means oversight subcommittee.
   Other members of the panel, which has been investigating the
problem for nine months, put the figure at $50 billion.
   ``We really do not have a way of estimating'' the tax loss, said
Kenneth Gideon, assistant secretary of the Treasury for tax policy.
``I would find $50 billion very hard to accept'' because the U.S.
take from all corporations is only about twice that figure.
   Rep. Ronnie Flippo, D-Ala., asked if foreign-controlled
corporations were paying their share.
   ``That's a question I can't answer,'' Gideon replied.
   ``In many cases what we have is criminal conduct,'' said Rep.
Clay Shaw, R-Fla. ``The way these companies are operating ... I
find incredible.''
   ``These companies are paying less than the average citizen, the
average taxpayers of the United States,'' said Rep. Richard
Schulze, R-Pa. ``That's abominable.''
   Noting a movement to raise taxes to reduce the budget deficit,
Schulze shouted: ``I'll be damned if I'll do it while billions of
dollars are floating overseas.''
   That sentiment was echoed by lawmakers as diverse as House
Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., and Sen. Jesse Helms,
R-N.C.
   The Internal Revenue Service told the subcommittee earlier this
week that foreign subsidiaries operating in the United States had
revenues of $686 billion in 1987 and paid federal income tax of
$4.56 billion.
   That rate of 0.66 percent of revenues compares with 1.04 percent
paid that same year by U.S.-owned corporations.
   Subcommittee investigators examined 36 giant companies that
distribute foreign-made automobiles, motorcycles and consumer
electronic goods in this country and found that more than half paid
little or no tax over a 10-year period.
   The chief means of avoiding U.S. tax was through a practice
known as transfer pricing. A foreign company could charge its U.S.
subsidiary an artificially high price for television sets, for
example, thus lowering the amount of income subject to U.S. tax.
   Such price manipulation also can worsen the U.S. trade deficit
and make it more difficult for American companies to compete
abroad, witnesses told the subcommittee.
   Michael E. Granfield, vice chancellor of the University of
California, Los Angeles, who assisted the IRS in an earlier case
against Japanese automobile companies, said there is a serious
compliance problem.
   Granfield said the IRS is hampered by a lack of resources and
the inability to pay salaries high enough to retain personnel who
can match expertise with industry economists and lawyers. But the
agency has other problems of its own creation, including a penchant
for seeking settlements that are so high as to be
counterproductive, he said.
   ``It is transparent that the IRS is not doing an adequate job in
this area,'' Granfield said.
   Pickle expressed hope that the subcommittee's investigation not
be viewed as aimed solely as Japanese corporations. Although
government officials are barred by law from disclosing the names of
taxpayers being investigated by the IRS, most of the criticism of
subcommittee members has been aimed at Japanese companies _ though
not by name.
   Rep. Duncan Hunter of California, chairman of the House
Republican Research Committee, released a list of Japanese
companies that he said have been identified in public reports as
being under IRS investigation.
   The list included many of the Japanese companies best known to
Americans, including Hitachi, Toshiba, Sony, Nissan, Toyota, Yamaha
and Matsushita Electric (Panasonic).

   Congress would be better off forcing bank
owners to invest more capital in their institutions than scaling
back the $100,000 limit on deposit insurance, Federal Reserve Board
Chairman Alan Greenspan said Thursday.
   Greenspan told the Senate Banking Committee he did not flatly
oppose an insurance reduction, but he warned that lowering the
limit would involve ``significant transition costs.''
   He acknowledged the need for change in the wake of the savings
and loan crisis, but said deposit insurance has lent stability to
the financial system.
   Deposit insurance allowed thrift owners to gamble on
investments, knowing they may reap the profits if they succeeded
but taxpayers would pick up most of the loss if they failed.
   However, it also has ``been the major reason why the United
States has not suffered a financial panic or systemic bank run in
the last half-century,'' the chairman said.
   ``Reform is required. So is caution,'' he added.
   The most promising approach would be to force bank and S&amp;L
owners to risk more of their own capital, he said. That should be
coupled with improved supervision to make sure banks use sound
practices, are reined in when they weaken and closed promptly if
they fail.
   More capital is needed particularly if, as the board advocates,
banks are allowed to engage in activities traditionally forbidden
to them, such as securities underwriting, he said.
   Thursday's Banking Committee hearing was 10th in a series of 13
intended to lay the groundwork for next year's debate on an
overhaul of the financial and banking system.
   Greenspan's views generally carry great weight with members of
Congress. The Bush administration is expected to make its own
recommendations in a report late this year.
   The 1980 decision by Congress and the Carter administration to
boost deposit insurance from $40,000 per account to $100,000 is
often cited as one of the root causes of the savings and loan
crisis.
   Advocates of cutting the limit include conservatives who oppose
government intervention in the economy and populists who believe
the $100,000 deposit insurance limit protects rich people at the
expense of average taxpayers.
   ``If we were starting from scratch, the board believes it would
be difficult to make the case that deposit insurance coverage
should be as high as the current $100,000 level,'' Greenspan said.
   ``However,'' he said, ``it is one thing initially to offer and
then maintain a smaller degree of insurance coverage, and quite
another to reimpose on the existing system a lower level of
insurance, with its associated readjustment and unwinding costs.''
   The central bank chairman also said Congress should exercise
care in increasing risks to uninsured deposits over the $100,000
limit.
   ``Runs of uninsured deposits from banks under stress have become
commonplace. So far, the pressure transmitted from such episodes to
other banks whose strength may be in doubt has been minimal,'' he
said.

   Marion Barry used drugs and drank heavily
before collapsing at a 1987 Super Bowl party, a friend testified
Thursday at the mayor's cocaine and perjury trial.
   Jeffrey Mitchell said Barry was rushed to a hospital and given
oxygen but then ``said he didn't want any tests'' and walked out.
   The two men used cocaine on at least 10 occasions from 1985 to
1987, testified Mitchell, an advertising executive who has worked
on Barry's mayoral campaigns.
   In major areas, his testimony supported that of another Barry
friend who told the jury on Wednesday of a conversation with
Mitchell about the Super Bowl episode. But the two witnesses
disagreed on several points, including whose idea it was to steer
clear of tests at the hospital.
   Lawyer Lloyd Moore had testified that Mitchell told him he had
refused to allow blood tests on Barry. Mitchell testified Thursday
that he did not intervene.
   At a 1987 Super Bowl party in Los Angeles, Mitchell testified,
he found the mayor slumped in a chair with his head back and
pinching his nose.
   Earlier, they had smoked a marijuana cigarette and Barry drank
champagne, a fifth of cognac and wine, said Mitchell.
   Barry was sniffing heavily, trying to clear an air passage and
``he looked uncomfortable,'' Mitchell testified. ``He said he was
having trouble breathing.''
   Had there been other times when Barry made those sounds? asked
assistant U.S. attorney Judith Retchin.
   ``Yes ... often after we had done cocaine,'' said Mitchell.
   Mitchell said he helped Barry out of the chair and told him to
take deep breaths, but it didn't help.
   ``He felt like he was going to faint,'' Mitchell said of Barry.
   After Barry was taken to an emergency room in an ambulance, he
was given oxygen and ``seemed to feel a little stronger. He wanted
to leave. ... He said he didn't want any tests,'' said Mitchell.
Barry did leave the hospital, the witness said.
   The official explanation given at the time for Barry's collapse
was that he had suffered a hiatal hernia.
   Another witness Thursday, Darrell Sabbs, said that he and the
mayor snorted cocaine together on four occasions between 1986 and
last September.
   Sabbs traveled to Washington on Jan. 19 for Barry's planned
announcement that he was running for re-election, but Barry was
arrested the night of Jan. 18 in an FBI sting operation and charged
with cocaine possession.
   By the time Sabbs got in town, ``there had been this entrap,
sting or whatever,'' testified Sabbs, who was a reluctant
prosecution witness.
   The day after Barry's arrest, Sabbs spoke to the mayor by
telephone and ``told him that I loved him and to take care of
himself.''
   Barry's defense in the sting operation is that the FBI trapped
him into smoking crack cocaine. The mayor has announced he won't
seek re-election.
   Mitchell said he and Barry snorted cocaine on two fishing trips
on the Chesapeake Bay, at a Memorial Day cookout, on a trip to the
Bahamas and on a number of other occasions, usually at Mitchell's
home.
   They even used cocaine by blowing it into each other's mouths
off a card, he said.
   He said it was Barry who introduced him to cocaine, putting it
up Mitchell's nose with a matchbook cover or a business card during
a fishing trip.
   The ad executive said he and the mayor were close friends and he
tried to slow Barry's cocaine use by sometimes lying when asked if
he had any.
   ``If I knew that he was going somewhere ... in an official
capacity, I just said I didn't have'' the drug, said Mitchell.
   ``I love Marion Barry,'' he said.
   Mitchell disputed other portions of Moore's testimony about the
Super Bowl trip. Moore and Mitchell had a conversation about
Barry's collapse shortly after it occurred, and Moore testified
about that Wednesday.
   Moore said Mitchell indicated the mayor had been smoking
``cocaine laced with something.'' Mitchell said it was Moore who
``suggested'' that Barry ``might have gotten hold of some bad
stuff, speed.''
   Moore testified that the conversation with Mitchell occurred in
a telephone call. Mitchell testified the two talked face-to-face in
Washington.
   Moore was ``strictly speculating'' that cocaine caused the
collapse? Barry's lawyer, R. Kenneth Mundy, asked on
cross-examination.
   ``Yes,'' replied Mitchell.

<HEAD>Court Asked to Push Government for Federal Property for Homeless</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An advocacy group said in federal court
Thursday that the Bush administration is dragging its feet on a
judge's order that surplus government property be made available
for the homeless.
   The group filed a motion seeking to enforce a 1988 permanent
injunction requiring the federal government to correct violations
and speed up implementation of the surplus property program.
   The action was filed by the National Law Center on Homelessness
and Poverty in U.S. District Court in Washington.
   The center said only 28 surplus federal properties have been
made available to house the homeless despite a 1987 federal law and
the 1988 court injunction issued by U.S. District Judge Oliver
Gasch.
   ``Almost two years later, the federal agencies are still doing
everything possible to subvert this program,'' said Maria
Foscarinis, director of the center, a non-profit advocacy group.
``The federal government has barely lifted a finger to use its
enormous existing resources to help those most in need.''
   The center contends in documents filed with the court that the
Department of Housing and Urban Development has failed to
adequately review federal properties that may be suitable for the
homeless. They also charged the application process is too
burdensome and has discouraged non-profit organizations from
applying for surplus property to house homeless people.
   The surplus property program was begun as part of a 1987 Stewart
B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act, which was named for its
sponsor, the late Republican congressman from Connecticut.

<TEXT>
   A radio talk show host was suspended
Thursday for barring black listeners from calling his show. He and
the station apologized.
   Tim Lennox said he was upset because a black man had broken into
a station employee's car and stolen her purse. He told his
listeners about the theft during hi two-hour show Wednesday, then
stopped blacks from calling.
   ``I made an emotional spur of the moment decision to accept only
calls from white listeners,'' Lennox said at the start of his
Thursday program.
   ``I want to sincerely apologize to anyone who was offended by my
actions. Anybody who has listened to my show for 14 years is aware
of my liberal outlook,'' said the 40-year-old Lennox, who is white.
   Berkley Fraser, WERC-AM general manager, said he decided to let
Lennox go on the air Thursday ``because he said he wanted to
apologize to the Birmingham community. We let him have that
opportunity.''
   Fraser earlier apologized on behalf of the station and announced
that Lennox had been suspended indefinitely.
   The station, Fraser said, encourages free expression with its
live programming and ``unfortunately, mistakes do occur.''
   Fraser said three station employees in the parking lot saw the
thief knock out a window, grab the purse and run.
   Lennox said he had not planned to continue the ban throughout
Wednesday's two-hour show but did so even though some callers
disapproved.
   ``I've never had a show this intense before,'' he said. ``Even
my white callers had something to say about what I was doing, so I
decided to play it out.''
   Callers talked about their experiences as crime victims and how
to prevent becoming a victim, but nearly half were critical of
Lennox for banning blacks.
   Don Palmer, a black man, said he tried to call during the two
hours but was not allowed on the air.
   ``I think that as a citizen of Birmingham, I've got the same
right to express my opinions,'' Palmer said. ``In my opinion, the
whole show was biased and unfair.''
   During Thursday's show, Lennox said he was proud to have been
part of the first integrated talk show in Birmingham some years
back.
   ``None of that excuses yesterday's show,'' he said, ``but it
might provide some perspective for what happened.''
   President Abraham Woods of the Birmingham chapter of the
Southern Chistian Leadership Conference said he was surprised at
the decision by Lennox, especially in light of a controversy over
blacks not being accepted as members at the Shoal Creek Country
Club, the site of next month's Professional Golfers' Association
championship.
   ``That was uncalled-for action on his part,'' Woods said. ``It
really bordered on stupidity in this day and time.''
   Woods could not be reached for reaction to the apologies and
suspension.

   The presidents of Nigeria and
the Ivory Coast met Thursday to consider proposals to end the civil
war in Liberia, including the introduction of an African
peacekeeping force.
   Nigeria's Ibrahim Babangida said there had been talks on the
peacekeeping proposal, ``and I do hope as time goes by a lot of
things will come out of the discussions we had.''
   Ivorian President Felix Houphouet-Boigny, listening to
Babangida's remarks following three hours of talks, nodded in
agreement.
   Babangida said the two presidents were awaiting further word
from diplomats in Freetown, Sierra Leone, who were meeting with
rebel representatives Thursday.
   The two presidents have become key figures in regional efforts
to negotiate an end to the conflict, which has degenerated into a
tribal war that has claimed several thousand lives since it began
in late December.
   Houphouet-Boigny's government has been sympathetic to rebel
leader Charles Taylor, while Babangida reportedly has sent arms to
Liberian President Samuel Doe.
   If the two leaders back a proposal to send a peacekeeping force
to Liberia it would increase pressure on Taylor's rebels to accept
it. Taylor has bitterly opposed the plan, which the rebels see as
an effort to stop them from toppling Doe's government just as they
are at the gates of the capital.
   It seemed unlikely the rebels would want to offend
Houphouet-Boigny, from whose country they launched their invasion
of Liberia, or Babangida because Nigeria is West Africa's military
powerhouse.
   Said Babangida, ``Both of us are concerned about Liberia. There
has to be a solution. My visit will give us time to review possible
solutions.''
   Houphouet-Boigny, a Roman Catholic, also took Babangida on a
tour of the colossal basilica he built here, at a cost of more than
$150 million. Pope John Paul II will visit the church, which rivals
St. Peter's in size, for its official consecration Sept. 10.

   Movie stars Kathleen Turner and Kevin Kline
met with members of Congress Thursday and urged rejection of
proposals to place restrictions on federal grants for the arts.
   Kline, who starred in the movie ``The Big Chill,'' said the
controversy over the National Endowment for the Arts is ``a kind of
hysteria'' that is making artists become ``suddenly suspicious
characters.''
   ``The NEA is a wonderful program _ it should be protected and
perpetuated,'' Kline told reporters. ``We're heading toward, if
we're not careful, a sort of cultural illiteracy.''
   Turner, who starred in ``Body Heat,'' said the issue amounts to
``whether one has the right to tell another person, even supposedly
for their own good ... how they should do their job.''
   The two attended a private lunch with members of the
congressional arts caucus, a group of members interested in the
arts, and later spoke briefly with reporters.
   Bills to continue the NEA are pending in both the House and
Senate, and a fight is expected over several proposals to apply
provisions restricting federal subsidies from going to art that is
deemed obscene, sacrilegious or otherwise offensive.

<HEAD>More Stormy Weather In Eastern Half Of Nation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Wet, stormy weather was scattered across the eastern half of the
nation Thursday, with heavy rain causing street flooding in Iowa,
and the West Coast sizzled in hot air.
   Showers and thunderstorms developing along and ahead of a slowly
moving cold front were scattered from south-central Texas to the
southern and middle Atlantic Coast states. The storms were most
numerous from southeastern Texas through the Gulf Coast states to
the southern Ohio Valley.
   Showers poured heavy rain in much of Iowa, with up to 3 inches
of rain in central Iowa and unofficial reports as high as 5 inches.
   Some streets were closed in Des Moines and 35 miles to the
northeast in Nevada, Iowa, where police said basements also were
flooded. No injuries were reported.
   Showers prevailed from the upper Ohio Valley and the lower Great
Lakes region across southern and central New England, and in
southwestern Texas.
   Strong northerly wind ushered unseasonably cool air into the
central Plains and the middle Mississippi Valley, and afternoon
highs were only in the 60s in parts of the Northeast.
   But temperatures in the West soared into the upper 90s as far
north as Washington state and Idaho at midday, when readings were
already above 100 degrees at some locations in the desert Southwest
and in the valleys of northern California.
   Because of the heat and lightning, federal and state
firefighters were working on more than 100 new fires Thursday in
Oregon, said Doug Decker, a spokesman for the Oregon Forestry
Department. Monitoring equipment recorded more than 2,500 lightning
strikes between noon and midnight Wednesday in a strip through
central Oregon.
   Lightning also started a fire in Georgia's Okefenokee Swamp
which had burned 3,900 acres as of Thursday.
   Overnight temperatures cooled only into the 70s and 80s in the
Southwest deserts with a morning low of 89 at Yuma, Ariz.
   Afternoon temperatures also were generally in the upper 80s and
90s from southern Texas to the southern half of the Atlantic Coast.
   Thursday's low for the Lower 48 states was 40 at Estes Park,
Colo.
   Severe weather was widespread Wednesday, the National Weather
Service said.
   Thunderstorms spawned two tornadoes in Florida and one in
Georgia, and there were more than 40 reports of large hail and
damaging wind from Ohio and Virginia southward to the Gulf Coast
region. In Virginia, 5 to 10 inches of rain fell around Virginia
Beach, the weather service said.
   Hail as big as golf balls was reported near Warrenton, Ga., and
thunderstorm wind gusted to 65 mph at Columbia, S.C., 66 mph at
Newport News, Va.
   Thunderstorms also produced severe weather late Wednesday in
eastern Colorado, including two tornadoes and hail as big as
softballs in the Denver area, the weather service said.
   The hail caused millions of dollars in damage to windows,
vehicles, lights and gardens, and one traffic death was blamed on
slippery roads.
   Forty-seven visitors to the Elitch Gardens amusement park were
treated for cuts and bruises after the storm cut power to the area,
stranding many on rides with little or no shelter from the hail,
said Connie Schafer, the park's marketing director.
   Tornadoes also were reported Wednesday in northern Iowa and
southern Minnesota, the weather service said. Showers and
thunderstorms over northern Texas late Wednesday produced 2.26
inches of rain across southern Wichita Falls.

   The chairman of a House panel on Thursday
urged Defense Secretary Dick Cheney to halt any more purchases of
Apache helicopters because of problems with the all-weather
aircraft.
   ``I understand the contracts could be signed within the next few
days _ this should be stopped,'' Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich.,
chairman of a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee, said in a
letter to Cheney.
   The General Accounting Office recommended to the committee in
April that the Army not buy the final 132 aircraft at a cost of
$1.49 billion.
   The GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, found that six of
the best Apaches the Army handpicked for the invasion of Panama
last December were plagued by problems.
   One helicopter never took off because of a hydraulic failure.
The fuel cell failed in another and still another was forced to
return to the base when its target detection system didn't work,
the GAO said.
   Complicating matters were the helicopters' sensitive electronic
components that failed to work when rain and humidity caused
moisture to build up. Army officials were forced to dry the parts
in kitchen ovens, the GAO said.
   Army Secretary Michael P.W. Stone said the service did not
dispute the GAO findings, but is making progress in rectifying the
problems.
   The Apache is ``the finest attack helicopter in the world, an
aircraft that has given the United States a capability that is the
envy of the world,'' Stone told the subcommittee on oversight and
investigations.
   The Army plans to buy 807 Apaches from McDonnell Douglas at a
cost of $12 billion. It's committed to 675 and the last 132 would
cost $1.49 billion, which has already been appropriated for the
current fiscal year.
   Dingell, in his letter, said the current plan is ``not my idea
of rational decision-making. Apart from the illogic of a decision
to buy more Apaches, such a decision would limit your budgeting
options at a time when you most need them.''

<TEXT>
   The Republican Party opened its mid-year meeting
Thursday with an aggressive counterattack against Democrats seeking
to blame the savings and loan crisis on President Bush and the GOP.
   Edward Rollins, co-chairman of the GOP's congressional
committee, led the effort by accusing congressional Democrats of
causing the S&amp;L debacle and delivering a caustic assault on
Democratic values and priorities.
   ``They've become corrupt, complacent and cocky,'' Rollins said
in a speech to the Republican National Committee. ``Now it's time
for a comeuppance.''
   Democrats, including several potential 1992 presidential
contenders, have tried to gain a political edge by blaming the $300
billion-plus S&amp;L bailout on the Reagan and Bush administrations.
   But Rollins said blame for the crisis rested with the majority
Democrats in Congress. He singled out three fallen Democrats _
former House Speaker Jim Wright, former House Whip Tony Coelho and
former House Banking Committee Chairman Fernand St Germain. Wright
and Coelho resigned last year amid ethics questions, and St Germain
was defeated in 1988.
   They and other Democrats, Rollins said, took millions of dollars
from the S&amp;L industry in the 1980s and refused to act when
significant evidence of a looming crisis first surfaced.
   ``If money is the mother's milk of politics, the Democratic
fund-raisers who were getting rich by looting S&amp;Ls were the
milkmen,'' Rollins said. ``For a few million dollars in campaign
contributions, the Democrats sold out the taxpayers. For the sake
of their own re-elections they left us a bailout legacy that could
reach the cost of thousands for every taxpayer for generations.''
   Democratic party Chairman Ronald Brown returned Rollins' fire
and predicted that GOP efforts to claim the high ground on S&amp;Ls
would fail.
   ``We're not surprised that `casino economy' Republicans who
gambled us into this whole mess are whining and scapegoating every
step of the way,'' Brown said in a statement. ``None of it is going
to work.''
   When the Democrats latched on to the S&amp;L bailout as a partisan
issue, Republican officials said they did not think the pitch would
resonate with voters. But some GOP leaders give the Democrats
credit for trying to exploit the bailout as a political issue
because of growing taxpayer anger over the its cost.
   ``For once, a party without leadership has agreed on one
thing,'' said Mary Matalin, the RNC executive director. ``We're not
going to sit there and let them define the debate.''
   The effort by Rollins and other senior Republicans to blunt the
attack was a clear indication the GOP is concerned about the
Democratic salvos.
   ``We're fighting back,'' said GOP consultant Charles Black, who
has been helping run the RNC while party Chairman Lee Atwater
battles a brain tumor. ``Democrats not only aren't clean on this
issue but a lot of their leaders are the people who caused the
problem.''
   RNC member Haley Barbour of Mississippi, a party strategist in
the South, said ``Democrats are going to get their fingers burned
on this as often as they are going to have success.''
   It appears the GOP would be happy with a political draw on the
S&amp;L issue.
   Republicans, too, accepted millions from S&amp;L interests. And with
Bush's son, Neil, involved in a highly publicized S&amp;L case, the
Democrats have ample fodder for attacks on the GOP.
   Atwater, who was hospitalized in Washington for what aides said
were routine tests related to treatment of his tumor, has urged
Rollins and other party operatives to be more aggressive in
answering the Democratic attacks.
   Rollins' speech was rich with rhetoric sure to be repeated this
fall in the congressional races around the country. Although GOP
prospects for cutting into the Democratic majority appear bleak
this year, Rollins is betting heavily on making inroads in 1992.
   Rollins delivered personal attacks on a handful of Democratic
lawmakers and offered a sarcastic assessment of the party overall,
labeling it soft on crime, eager to raise taxes and reliant on a
divisive platform of class warfare for support.
   Answering the concerns of many Republican leaders gathered for
the two-day meeting, Rollins said Bush abandoned his ``no new
taxes'' pledge because it was the only way to get Democrats to
agree to spending cuts.
   He warned that Democrats may try to blame the Republicans should
cuts in Social Security and other entitlement programs emerge from
ongoing budget talks between Congress and the White House.
   Privately, many of the RNC members have expressed worries that
Bush's reversal on taxes will hurt GOP candidates this fall. But
there was no public effort to question the president, and party
officials made it clear the White House likely would oppose any
efforts to raise personal income taxes as part of a tax package.
   ``A good economy is good politics,'' Bush pollster Bob Teeter
told the RNC, saying Bush needed to give up his tax pledge to spur
a deficit-reduction package. ``There is no worse politics than a
recession.''

   Married men could become bishops of the Greek
Orthodox Church in the Western Hemisphere under a recommendation
approved Thursday by the church's 30th Biennial Clergy-Laity
Congress.
   Although the Congress is recognized as the supreme legislative
body of the church in the Western Hemisphere, members said it did
not have the right to make a new rule on the subject.
   By a voice vote, it recommended ``that the matter of inclusion
of married priests as candidates for elevation to the Episcopacy be
respectfully referred to the Holy Synod for consideration.''
   The synod consists of Archbishop Iakovos and the Episcopacy,
that is, the bishops under him.
   Orthodox churches permit married men to become priests, unlike
the Roman Catholic church, which has been separated from the
Orthodox churches for more than 900 years. Orthodox priests may not
marry after they are ordained, however, and married priests may not
become bishops.
   More than two million members adhere to the Greek Orthodox
church in the Western Hemisphere.

   Prospects are still good for a bumper grain
harvest in the Soviet Union this year, the Agriculture Department
said Thursday.
   Total grain production continues to be estimated at 215 million
metric tons, up from 211.1 million tons in 1989, the department
said in a report. That would be the largest since a record 237.4
million tons were harvested in 1978.
   Soviet grain imports for the 1990-91 year that began July 1 also
were unchanged from the previous forecast, 36 million tons compared
with 38 million tons in 1989-90.
   But officials said the Soviet Union would probably boost its
wheat imports to 17 million tons, up 1 million tons from the
previous forecast, and reduce imports of coarse grains by the same
amount.
   Analysts said the shift was due mostly to widening price spreads
between lower-quality wheat used for livestock feed and corn.

<TEXT>
   Ships from three nations sailed on
Thursday to a rendezvous off Albania in a sea lift of more than
4,500 Albanians seeking to escape their homeland, Europe's last
haven for hard-line Communists.
   Five ships were engaged by France, Italy and West Germany to
ferry the refugees 85 miles across the Adriatic from Durres,
Albania, to the southern Italian port of Brindisi, a voyage of five
to seven hours.
   The exodus was expected to ease a 2-week-old crisis created by
Albanians storming foreign embassies in Tirana seeking asylum. Some
braved police gunfire. Others crashed through embassy compound
walls in trucks, or scrambled over walls.
   The embassies have been struggling to feed and shelter the
Albanians, many of them young people.
   ``They will all arrive tomorrow (Friday),'' said Franco LoParco,
president of the Italian Red Cross in Brindisi.
   A Foreign Ministry spokesman said the ships would meet up off
Durres but further details would be withheld at the request of the
Albanian government.
   The Italian news agency ANSA, without citing its sources, said
Albania doesn't want the ships to dock and that the asylum-seekers
will be transferred from shore to the foreign vessels by Albanian
boats.
   Two Greek-owned ferries, chartered by the West German
government, arrived at Durres Thursday afternoon, a spokesman for
the shipowner said. Together the two vessels can carry 1,900
passengers.
   Two Italian ships were bound for Albania from Venice and
Brindisi and a French-chartered ship set sail for Albania from
Greece.
   The first ship is due shortly after dawn. Most of the arrivals
will be given coffee and croissants and then put on three trains
headed for West Germany.
   West German diplomats in Brindisi said 3,200 Albanians who took
refuge in their embassy in Tirana, Albania's capital, would make
the sea crossing. Earlier, Italian officials put that figure at
2,200.
   Figures on the total number of Albanian asylum-seekers also
varied. An earlier version put it at more than 5,000.
   Among those expected to arrive was a baby born Wednesday at the
West German Embassy, diplomats in Tirana said.
   The Germany-bound refugees will be given medical examinations
and a chance to shower in Brindisi before boarding trains for a
30-hour journey.
   Giuseppe Mazzitello, Brindisi's administrative chief, said the
port would be closed to tourist traffic Friday. Brindisi is in the
heel of Italy, about 330 miles southeast of Rome.
   Only 51 of the refugees had left Albania to now. The small group
in the Czechoslovak Embassy was flown to Prague early Monday.
   Albania agreed to let the refugees leave the embassy compounds
after supplies of food and medicine ran low and hygienic conditions
deteriorated.
   The approximately 800 Albanians who took refuge in the Italian
Embassy will be given temporary shelter in a military camp near
Brindisi. About 540 from the French Embassy will continue to France
by ship after stopping in Brindisi, authorities said.
   A final destination will be determined in the refugees' host
country. Many say they hope to go to the United States.
   Soldiers wearing yellow rubber gloves used wire-cutters to
remove coils of barbed wire from concrete walls around the
perimeter of the camp Thursday.
   ``We are taking down the barbed wire so it doesn't seem like a
concentration camp,'' said Lt. Col. Michele Dodde.
   LoParco said the Red Cross expected to treat about a dozen
wounded, including three or four people with fractures and several
with kidney problems.
   Hungary's state news agency MTI said Hungary will fly the 40
Albanians in its embassy to Budapest Friday night.
   The assault on the embassies presented the biggest challenge in
decades to the Albanian government.
   It was reminiscent of the rush on foreign embassies in East
Germany last year that contributed to the collapse of the country's
Communist government.
   Albanian leader Ramiz Alia introduced limited reforms this year,
including some religious freedoms and travel abroad.
   The crisis caused a shakeup in the leadership, but the
government said it will maintain its hard line.
   Some Albanians who arrived this week in Prague speculated that
Communist rule in their country may last only a year or two more.
   ``I give Communism in my country one or two years,'' said Kola,
36-year-old Albanian construction worker. Kola, who gave only his
first name, is housed with other refugees in a barracks outside
Prague.
   ``It was intolerable. We all dreaded the isolation,'' he said.

<HEAD>Truckers Doubt Seat-Belt Regulation Can Be Enforced</HEAD>

<DATELINE>FREDERICK, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At I-70 Truck City on Thursday, resting
drivers expressed indignation and doubt about a government proposal
to make them buckle up while working.
   ``A lot of people might be for it, but I'm against it. They can
tell me how fast to drive, but I don't think they should be able to
say, `Get in and strap yourself in this thing,''' said Ed England,
a trucker from Hopkinsville, Ky.
   The regulation the U.S. Labor Department proposed Wednesday
would cover 5.4 million businesses with 35 million workers, like
Jerry Aiello, a 48-year-old truck driver from Upland, Calif., also
taking a break at the truck stop.
   Aiello wears his seat belt when the road gets bumpy but doesn't
like the way it cuts into his belly on long hauls. And he doesn't
think the government can force him to buckle up.
   ``I don't see how they're going to enforce it. They can't even
enforce the drug laws,'' said Aiello, who was hauling lumber on
Interstate 70 in western Maryland.
   Under the proposed Occupational, Safety and Health
Administration rule, workers who drive or ride on the job would
have to wear seat belts. Self-employed people and businesses with
10 or fewer employees would be exempt.
   Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole said the new rules could save up
to 685 lives a year. She said automobile accidents were the single
largest cause of occupational fatalities, causing about 2,100
job-related deaths a year.
   ``It could cost lives, too,'' said England, 36, who was headed
to Georgia with a load of syrup used to flavor cigars.
   England said he was glad he wasn't wearing a seat belt when his
truck crashed into the rear of another last year.
   ``The whole front end of the cab came through the windshield,''
England said. ``The cop said if I had been seat belted-in, I
wouldn't have been there to talk about it.''
   Bill Thomas, 42, a trucker from Terre Haute, Ind., said he was
willing to risk a ticket in the more than 30 states that have
mandatory seat belt laws.
   ``I don't wear a seat belt _ not in a truck,'' said Thomas, who
was fined for not wearing a seat belt in Illinois. ``At the time I
was hauling gasoline.
   ``I'm afraid of fire. I've seen too many people burn up. If
you're upside down and your arms are trapped, what are you going to
do?''
   Thomas, who was taking a load of appliances from Baltimore to
Columbus, Ohio, said he did not see how the government could
enforce the regulation.
   ``I think the government is overstepping its bounds,'' Thomas
said. ``To me, it should be a choice, except for small kids in a
car or something.''
   Dole admitted enforcement would be difficult. Federal inspectors
would make checks of seat-belt use part of their routine.
Businesses guilty of violations could be fined up to $10,000, she
said.
   Vince Carter, 27, who was delivering packages in downtown
Frederick, said his employer, United Parcel Service, requires
drivers to wear seat belts.
   ``Our company says it's mandatory from stop to stop,'' said
Carter. ``It seems reasonable. It might even be able to help
insurance costs a little.''
   But Curt King, 36, a driver for City Cab Co. in Frederick, said
seat belt laws infringe on his freedom.
   ``If you want to get splattered on the highway it's your
right,'' said King, who does not buckle up. ``It's just a nuisance.
I just personally feel that it isn't anybody's business.''

   The Education Department began mailing public
and private schools advice Thursday on how to teach children the
dangers of drug abuse and warning against using recovering
alcoholics and drug addicts in classrooms.
   Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos released the drug education
model, which is being sent to about 122,000 schools, and described
it as a blueprint for effective techniques and suggestions for
classroom activities.
   Recovering alcoholics and drug addicts should not be used in
classroom presentations that try to discourage youngsters from
experimenting with illegal drugs, the department said.
   ``One of the dangers of using recovering addicts in prevention
programs is that we might be giving a mixed message _ `I tried it.
I've recovered and I'm driving away in my BMW,''' said Dick Hayes,
head of the agency's drug abuse prevention program.
   ``Where recovering addicts seem to have a role is particularly
in intervention and treatment. This is the consensus in the
field,'' he said.
   Cavazos said the program was divided into four academic levels:
kindergarten through grade three, grades four through six, seven
through eight and nine through 12.
   ``Education is our best hope for a drug-free America,'' Cavazos
said.
   Each element contains suggestions for teachers on how they can
work effectively with parents and with agencies in the community. A
lesson plan defines the specific learning objective, with suggested
activities and resources required.
   Drug prevention lessons are included throughout core academic
subjects including mathematics, science, language arts, social
studies, health or physical education classes, art or music classes.
   The model won immediate praise from Rep. Lawrence Coughlin,
R-Pa. and the National School Boards Association, which is urging
all of its members to ``give careful review'' to the document.
   Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., who has complained the
administration isn't doing enough to promote drug prevention,
praised the curriculum but questioned whether there is incentive to
ensure schools will use it.
   ``As promising as this curriculum appears to be, and knowing the
secretary's good intentions, it would be a shame, and a waste of
resources, if this were not put into action far and wide,'' said
Rangel.
   Cavazos said the model contains ``clear, unequivocal messages
that illegal drug use is wrong and harmful and that any drug use
involves risk.'' By using loose-leaf binders, he said educators can
incorporate material developed by local school districts.
   The model is being sent to about school principals and
superintendents, as well as to the 1,500 largest private schools
and members of the Chief State School Officers.

   Passengers and crew on a Soviet jetliner Thursday
thwarted a hijacking by a 17-year-old who claimed he had a bomb and
demanded the plane fly to Sweden, state-run television reported.
   It was the 11th attempt this summer to hijack an Aeroflot
jetliner, according to the news program ``Vremya.''
   Six of the jets have landed in foreign airports _ mainly Nordic
countries. Five have landed at Soviet airports. All the hijackers
have been arrested.
   Thursday's attempt began when a Leningrad youth, identified only
as Lebedev, announced he had a bomb and demanded the jet be flown
to Stockholm, ``Vremya'' reported. It was on a flight from
Leningrad to Murmansk.
   The pilot landed instead at Leningrad's Pulkovo Airport, where
the youth was subdued, the television program reported. The suspect
was then seized by special police agents.
   The program gave no details of how the suspect was subdued. It
did not say if the teen-ager actually had a bomb.

   Government agencies must help Eastern European
teachers and union officials reform their education system, the
American Federation of Teachers said Thursday.
   AFT President Albert Shanker said the ideas and principles of
democracy will take root only if they are taught effectively to the
next generation.
   The AFT, to encourage democracy in education in Eastern Europe,
developed a seven-point agenda detailing steps that can be taken by
governmental agencies, Shanker said.
   A key emphasis of the program, part of the AFT's Education for
Democracy-International and estimated to cost $100 million, is to
get more assistance from Congress and the federal government to
help Central and Eastern Europe overcome a lack of educational
resources, he said.
   But Shanker stressed that private foundations, state education
departments, colleges and universities all must play a role in
promoting the teaching of the history, principles and practices of
democracy.
   The Education for Democracy-International project began early
this year as an extension of a program launched in 1987 to advocate
strengthening the teaching of democratic values in the United
States.
   ``Teachers in Eastern Europe are for the first time in 45 years
able to teach non-propagandistic history, literature, economics,
and politics,'' he said. ``But there are no textbooks for these
subjects, except those produced by the communist governments to
indoctrinate students about the accomplishments of communism.''
   Zoltan Pokorni, national spokesman for the Democratic Teachers
Union in Hungary, said the U.S. Information Agency told him it
would expand its Fulbright exchange program for teachers, and other
education programs.
   The American Council on Education also agreed to develop teacher
and student exchange programs, he said.
   The AFT said there are more than 50,000 Russian-language
teachers in the five Eastern European countries but fewer than
5,000 teachers of Western languages.
   Pokorni said about 10,000 Hungarian and 18,000 Polish Russian
teachers are expected to lose their jobs. The exchange programs
could help many of them find new classroom jobs, such as teaching
English.
   The AFT plan also calls for providing tax incentives and other
assistance to public and private American universities willing to
open branches in various Eastern European countries, and
establishing special English-language training schools and teacher
training colleges in Eastern Europe.

   The cymbals on about 9,200 Sesame Street
Rhythm Band sets will be replaced because a New York toy company
says the parts pose a choking hazard for small children.
   LEWCO Corp. said this week it would offer to replace the Oscar
the Grouch cymbals for its model 3553 band sets because ``the heads
detached from the cymbals'' and fail the Consumer Product Safety
Commission's small-parts test.
   The sets consist of a drum, drum sticks, maracas, slide whistle,
tambourines and the cymbals. Only the cymbals are subject to the
replacement program, the company said.
   There have been no injuries reported involving the sets but
consumers should discard the original cymbals and contact LEWCO
Corp., 1107 Broadway-Suite 905, New York, N.Y., 10010 for
replacements.
   In a similar action, another toy manufacturer recalled 2,364
dolls because various body parts detach easily and present a
choking hazard to young children.
   Allen-Lewis Manufacturing Co. of Denver, Colo., said its ``Cutie
Kid'' dolls were sold or distributed as free premiums since 1989 to
tourists in small towns throughout the nation.
   The 6-inch dolls came with pacifiers and are dressed in a pink
or blue two-piece pajama outfit. The cardboard headers on the clear
plastic bags packaging are labeled ``Cutie Kid Made in China.''
   Consumers should take the dolls away from young children and
contact Frank Garlett at 1-800-525-6658.

<HEAD>Poll Finds Americans Unwilling to Radically Change Health Care
System</HEAD>

   Americans want change in the nation's health
care system but they are far from agreement on how to do it,
according to a poll released Thursday.
   The survey by the Gallup Organization Inc. found more
contradictions than consistencies in Americans' views on health
care, said officials of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association,
which commissioned the poll.
   It found that 68 percent believe government spending on health
care should be increased, but 52 percent said the amount the nation
now spends on health care is either ``too much'' or ``about right.''
   ``Americans are torn between the social value they place on
equal access to care, and the economic reality of paying for that
care,'' said Bernard Tresnowski, president of the Blue Cross and
Blue Shield Association.
   ``Americans want change, but their answers show they're not
ready for a radical dismantling of our health care system,'' he
said.
   Among the findings:
   _Americans don't single out health care costs and quality as a
major problem in the country. Drug abuse is named the biggest
problem facing the nation, with 45 percent. Health care was named
by 2 percent.
   _When asked about health care, 57 percent say they are ``very
concerned'' about costs and 44 percent say they are ``very
concerned'' about their quality of the care.
   _70 percent believe that rising costs are leading to a health
care crisis.
   _86 percent agreed that the federal government should assure
that everyone gets needed health services.
   _60 percent said all health care services should be funded
through a government insurance program.
   _But nearly half said the federal government is not well-suited
to run health programs, 63 percent said government-run programs are
inefficient and wasteful and two-thirds agreed that ``dealing with
the government is often not worth the trouble.''
   Gallup interviewed 2,000 randomly selected American adults by
telephone Jan. 5-30. The margin of sampling error for the survey
was plus or minus 2 percentage points.

<HEAD>Police Increase Bounty on Escobar, Cocaine Kingpin</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities say cocaine kingpin Pablo
Escobar is hiding out in northeastern Colombia and a three-day
manhunt has failed to nab the fugitive billionaire.
   The government raised the reward for information leading to the
capture of Escobar from $400,000 to $600,000, a police spokesman
said on condition of anonymity. Escobar, Colombia's most wanted
man, is the reputed leader of the Medellin cocaine cartel.
   Police Tuesday launched a massive drug raid in northeastern
Colombia. Eleven employees of the Medellin cartel were arrested,
but the drug baron fled near Puerto Triunfo, 75 miles southeast of
Bogota.
   Security forces in the area, known as Magdalena Medio, arrested
seven more employees of the Medellin cartel on Wednesday. They
included Escobar's personal physician and brother-in-law, Hernan
Dario Quintero, police said.
   Gen. Octavio Vargas, a national police director, said another of
those arrested was a man believed to have handed out money to keep
local residents quiet about Escobar's hideout.
   Vargas said 2,000 soldiers and police were sweeping the region
with helicopters and land patrols Thursday.
   ``The presence of family and men close to Pablo Escobar ... and
information we have received from peasant farmers indicates he is
still in the region,'' Vargas said.
   In the Wednesday raid, security forces also found 900 pounds of
dynamite in a truck near Puerto Triunfo, where Escobar is believed
to own extensive property.
   Since Tuesday, authorities have seized more than 8,500 pounds of
dynamite, assault rifles, sophisticated radio equipment, and
documents belonging to the drug cartel, the world's largest.
   The police spokesman said the anti-drug operation would continue
indefinitely.
   According to several accounts, Escobar, 42, went from being a
petty car thief to one of the world's 20 richest men, with an
estimated worth of over $3 billion.
   The raids Tuesday and Wednesday were the latest attacks in the
government's 11-month-old war on traffickers that began last
August, when drug barons allegedly assassinated leading
presidential candidate, Sen. Luis Carlos Galan.
   Since then, the traffickers have retaliated with a terror
campaign of car bombings, massacres and police assassinations, and
hundreds of people have been killed.
   Meanwhile, in Medellin, Colombia's second-largest city, two
policemen were slain Wednesday, bringing to 133 the number of law
officers assassinated in Medellin so far this year, according to
police.
   The cartel has reportedly offered to pay $4,300 for each police
officer killed.
   Since August, President Virgilio Barco has extradited 15 drug
suspects to face charges in the United States and confiscated
hundreds of properties belonging to the cocaine barons.

   Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu urged his
countrymen to be ``good corporate citizens'' in the United States
and proposed a broad cultural exchange between the two countries.
   Kaifu, the first Japanese prime minister to tour the Southeast,
also placed a flower wreath at the tomb of the Rev. Martin Luther
King Jr. and met Thursday with the slain civil rights leader's
widow.
   ``He greatly admired Dr. King. It's only natural he would come
here,'' said Stephen Allen, public relations officer for the
Japanese Consulate in Atlanta. ``Japan is committed to human rights
around the world.''
   Coretta Scott King King took Kaifu on a brief tour of the Martin
Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change and gave him
several mementos, said Steve Klein, the center's research associate.
   U.S. civil rights advocates were outraged four years ago when
then-Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone said blacks and Hispanics
lowered the U.S. intelligence standard.
   ``He's a new prime minister. We can't hold him responsible for
what others have said,'' Klein said.
   ``The American Southeast has long had good relations with Japan,
and this region is today home to about 600 Japanese companies ...
(that) contribute to the region's economic development,'' Kaifu
said. ``I am hoping to have the chance to meet with some of these
corporate leaders, and I will take the opportunity to encourage
them to fit in with their local communities as good corporate
citizens.''
   In a speech Thursday night, Kaifu intended to outline a broad
cultural exchange project and encourage cooperation between Japan
and the United States, Allen said.

   In comments prepared for delivery at a dinner of the
Japan-America Society of Georgia, Kaifu said the United States and
Japan should focus on their similarities.
   ``All human beings are increasingly tied to one another as the
world becomes more integrated into one community,'' he said.
   ``Talks between our two countries should not be used as a forum
for one partner to criticize the other,'' Kaifu said. ``Rather we
should seize these opportunities to promote our joint endeavors.''
   He proposed a cultural exchange, called the Communication
Improvement Initiative, to promote understanding between the two
countries.
   Although he offered no specifics, Kaifu said the public, as well
as politicians, should participate in the exchange.
   Kaifu arrived in Georgia Wednesday night after attending the
economic summit in Houston.

<HEAD>U.S.-funded Anti-missile Missile Reportedly Ready for Test</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Israel will soon launch its first test of a
missile-killing missile developed with U.S. ``Star Wars'' funds, a
newspaper reported Thursday.
   The Arrow missile, designed to combat short-range ballistic
missiles, was created with funds from the U.S. Strategic Defense
Initiative, better known as the Star Wars program.
   In its report Thursday, the Jerusalem Post said a date for the
first test of the Arrow missile was ``imminent.''
   Officials at Israel Aircraft Industries, which is developing the
Arrow along with Lockheed Corp. of Calabasas, Calif., declined
comment Thursday. Moshe Keret, the head of Israel Aircraft, last
month told reporters the Arrow will not be ready for operational
use until at least 1992.
   Defense Minister Moshe Arens on Thursday discussed the Arrow
with Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the U.S. joint chiefs of
staff. Powell is on a five-nation Middle East tour.
   ``I mentioned the Arrow project to Gen. Powell since he is
familiar with it. I understood that he greatly appreciates Israel's
technological achievements in this field, which in many respects
are indeed unprecedented,'' Arens said on Israel radio.
   ``I think we've apparently found an answer to ground-to-ground
missiles,'' Arens added. ``We expect the U.S. administration to
continue funding this project so that we t.''
   Washington provided 80 percent of the $158 million for the first
phase of the Arrow project. Israel's Defense Ministry supplied the
rest. Israel wants about $200 million from Washington for the
second phase.
   Arens said the Arrow was discussed in the context of Iraqi
threats to use missile-carried chemical weapons against Israel in
retaliation for any attack.
   The Arrow is designed to defend against ballistic missiles with
a range of 600 miles or less.
   The Star Wars program is mainly conducting research into the
feasibility of space-based defenses against ballistic missile
attacks.
   The Bush administration spent $1 billion on the program the past
fiscal year. But its $4.5 billion request for the next year is
expected to come under severe attack in the U.S. Congress.
   The program's critics contend the system is too expensive and
unnecessary in this time of lessened East-West tensions.
   However, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has touted the program's
possibilities to counter the growing threat of Third World
ballistic missiles.
   Cheney has also argued the Soviet's spaced-based defense
research is continuing.

   The man just picked to run the daily affairs of
the Soviet Communist Party charted a middle ground Thursday,
backing quick reform and tolerance for many views but warning of
``ill-conceived leaps.''
   Vladimir A. Ivashko, the personal choice of Soviet leader
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, trounced party traditionalist Yegor K.
Ligachev in an election to choose the party's No. 2 leader at the
28th Communist Party Congress.
   In his first meeting with reporters after his victory, Ivashko
on Thursday proclaimed himself a staunch supporter of Gorbachev's
policies who nevertheless was very surprised to find himself the
Soviet leader's new deputy.
   ``I will make every effort to consolidate the party, to
accommodate different points of view in the party,'' he told a news
conference.
   He urged party members contemplating defection from the party to
remain, because the party under Gorbachev ``is able to solve all
the tasks put forward by perestroika,'' he said. Perestroika is
President Gorbachev's program of social and economic reforms.
   However, only hours later, radical reformer Boris N. Yeltsin
announced to the congress he was quitting the party. Leading
members of the Democratic Platform, a reform group, said they would
follow suit.
   In his comments Thursday, Ivashko showed the influence of his
many years as a teacher. The 58-year-old spoke forcefully, using
examples and hand gestures to buttress his arguments.
   Ivashko was picked last fall to replace longtime Ukrainian
Communist Party chief Vladimir V. Shcherbitsky, who retired.
   The deputy party leader's position is new. Gorbachev needs a
deputy to run much of the party's business because he spends much
time on government business as Soviet president.
   The new deputy said he only learned Tuesday he would be
Gorbachev's choice.
   ``When I came here to the congress, I never, never thought that
my life would change so drastically,'' he said.
   He said he had not had a chance to discuss his exact duties with
Gorbachev.
   He spoke out emphatically for speedy reform but said the party
and Soviet government also had to avoid costly mistakes.
   Gorbachev's reform effort, begun in 1985, was 20 years too late
in coming, he declared.
   Now, he said: ``I am for moving forward fast. I see no other
option. There is no way back.''
   But he said the leadership had to avoid the kinds of mistakes it
made in the first years of Gorbachev's reforms.
   ``I am against ill-conceived leaps _ forward, backwards,
sideways,'' he said. ``Perestroika proves that we have made many
erroneous decisions, quickly designed to solve all problems.''
   Although backing transition to a market economy, he stuck to
Gorbachev's line that the moves cannot be made hastily.
   He said a 1985 drive against alcoholism, the first large-scale
reform effort tried under Gorbachev, caused ``huge moral and
financial damage, and damage to the health of the people.''
   The campaign took billions of rubles from alcohol sales out of
the national treasury. It also encouraged moonshiners whose
low-quality brew killed and injured many people.
   Ivashko also said the Soviet government was foolhardy to agree
to demands it knew it could not fulfull in response to a strike
last year by Soviet miners.
   On Wednesday, hundreds of thousands of miners struck for one day
to demand the resignation of the government, the nationalization of
Communist Party property and removal of party groups from the
workplace and security forces.

   Photographers say a famous lone cypress
tree on the coast near Carmel is a natural monument and that anyone
can take a picture of it for any reason.
   But the company that owns its rocky perch warns commercial
photographers away, insisting the tree _ not just the logo it
inspired _ is a trademark.
   ``The Pebble Beach Co. does not mind anyone photographing the
tree for private purposes. What it does object to is the commercial
exploitation of its own property by others without its consent,''
said Kerry Smith, a San Francisco lawyer for the resort company.
   The tree, which stands alone on a windswept finger of rock that
juts into the Pacific, is a popular tourist stop on the 17-mile
drive just north of Carmel, about 85 miles south of San Francisco.
   Although the tree has been recorded on film for a century,
including by renowned photographers Ansel Adams and Edward Weston,
the scenic golf resort recently told two professional photographers
not to use pictures of the tree without its consent.
   The action and trademark claim have evoked bewilderment,
amusement, skepticism and outrage.
   ``This just knocked me over. ... I thought the tree was made by
God,'' said Los Angeles photographer Craig Aurness, who got a
warning letter from the company after his picture of the tree was
used in an MCI brochure last fall.
   Pebble Beach Co. also denied photographer Ed Young of Carmel
permission to take pictures of the cypress if he planned to use
them for commercial purposes.
   ``I'm sure Ansel Adams and Edward Weston didn't have to get
anything in writing,'' Young said in a letter of protest to the
company.
   The Pebble Beach Co. warns visitors in a brochure that
unauthorized commercial photography is not allowed. And it has
registered several depictions of the tree as a trademark and uses
them on company letterhead, golf clubs, balls, caps and other items
at the resort, Smith said.
   The trademark includes the tree itself as well as abstract and
realistic depictions of it, he said.
   ``The lone cypress itself has been the symbol and trademark of
the Pebble Beach Co. and its predecessors since 1916,'' he said.
   But photographers, people who sell their work and experts in
``intellectual property'' law disagree with the trademark claim or
say the issue is unclear.
   ``What is trademarkable is your logo or illustration,'' said
Nancy Wolff, partner in the New York law firm of Cavallo and Wolff,
representing Aurness. ``That doesn't mean the tree is
trademarkable. ... They're trying to get a monopoly over a natural
object because they have this drawing.''
   Critics of the Pebble Beach Co. also argue that the cypress is
in the public domain, pointing out that people were taking pictures
of it long before the area became a resort.
   ``The tree is, in my opinion, a world-renowned symbol,'' said
Allison Worthern, graphics manager of a Carmel gallery. ``It's part
of us here. ... We already put a price on so many things in this
world ... that belong to God and nature.''

   Transit Authority workers said Thursday they're
determined to catch a wily ``non-paying invader'' _ a raccoon
that's taken residence at a downtown train stop.
   ``Rocky the Raccoon has been able to give us the slip somehow,''
Peter Poholik, director of the city's Commission on Animal Care
Control, conceded on Thursday. ``We've been out there the last
three days trying to get close enough to grab him.''
   Transit officials say if the raccoon is cornered, it may be a
threat to riders.
   ``We want to get this non-paying invader off of our system,''
spokesman Don Yabush said.
   Poholik, a veterinarian, and the Transit Authority's security
officers rose early Thursday in the latest attempt to capture the
elusive raccoon.
   Armed with a tranquilizer gun and bait, they were hoisted on a
small platform into the rafters beneath the tracks as trains roared
by above. But the raccoon _ spotted on the preceding two mornings
on a particular rafter above the street _ was having nothing of it.
   ``Never saw him,'' Poholik said glumly.
   A trap set in the rafters, which would catch the raccoon alive,
had malfunctioned, closing as the vibrations of the trains shook
it. Poholik on Thursday added more fragrant peanut butter bait to
the trap and tightened its springs and latches.
   Because of the hoopla, Poholik said that if the raccoon is
captured, it would probably avoid the fate of other wild animals
the city captures: extermination.
   ``What we will do, because of all the attention, is ... find
some zoological society to take him off our hands.''
   But he's hoping it's all a moot point.
   ``There's a very good possibility that he got sidetracked''
during a nocturnal stroll and won't be coming back, Poholik said.

   Heavy rain flooded creeks and broke a
dam Thursday, forcing renewed evacuations in part of eastern Ohio
that was heavily damaged by deadly flooding last month.
   About 600 people in Dillonvale and 200 people in Dunglen were
urged to evacuate their homes, said Francis Sebring, director of an
emergency services command post.
   Residents also were evacuated from their homes in Adena, some by
boat.
   Dillonvale and Adena suffered extensive damage during flash
floods that struck eastern Ohio on June 14 and killed 26 people
near Shadyside, about 20 miles south of Dillonvale.
   ``We got hit again,'' Sebring said. ``It's pouring down rain.''
   Evacuations also were reported in central Ohio because of
flooding.
   Ohio had been hit with thunderstorms much of the week. The
National Weather Service said rain was expected to continue into
the weekend.
   National Guard units in Cambridge and Steubenville were being
sent to the eastern Ohio flood areas to help relief efforts, said
Ohio Emergency Management Agency spokeswoman Stacy Gilg.
   Emergency shelters for the evacuees were set up in churches and
fire departments.
   Sebring said a dam at a strip-mine operation broke. He said
water from the dam would enter Short Creek, which runs through the
Dillonvale and Newtown before emptying into the Ohio River.
   In the Adena area, boaters took people to higher ground.
   ``It's been raining constantly, hard rain, all day,'' said
firefighter Greg Arnett. He said there was about two feet of water
around the firehouse.
   ``Here in Adena I know people are evacuating some houses,'' said
church secretary Mary Martha Carter. ``They're telling people to
leave houses and go where they can go.''
   Flooding also was reported in Licking County in central Ohio and
Athens County in southeast Ohio. Ms. Gilg said there were no
requests for state aid from those areas.
   Dozens of people were evacuated from low-lying areas of Licking
County, one county west of Columbus, after steady rainfall caused
the south fork of the Licking River to spill over its banks. No
injuries were reported.

<HEAD>Brazil Announces End of Budget Deficit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JORGE MEDEROS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government announced Thursday it has
erased its chronic budget deficit with a new fiscal plan that
heralds lower inflation and renewed foreign debt payments.
   In the latest of a series of labor troubles, however, workers at
the country's second-largest steel factory began a sit-down strike.
They are demanding higher wages to counter inflation in this nation
of 150 million residents.
   President Fernando Collor de Mello is trying to combat Brazil's
economic woes. The country, the largest debtor in the Third World,
owes about $6 billion after withholding interest payments to
private creditors for more than a year. Brazil's inflation last
year soared to 5,000 percent.
   A key to balancing the 1990 budget was the president's
controversial ``administrative reform'' plan, said Economy Minister
Zelia Cardoso de Mello. It includes selling government cars and
mansions, closing or selling dozens of state-owned companies and
firing about 360,000 federal workers.
   Despite a wave of labor strikes to protest the planned firings,
Cardoso de Mello said, ``the price was worth paying.''
   De Mello said Brazil's new budget calls for a surplus equivalent
to 1.65 percent of the country's gross national product, which the
Economy Ministry put at $500 billion.
   Earlier estimates had projected a deficit of 7.82 percent of the
GNP, the annual total of goods and services produced.
   ``We have liquidated a chronic situation of fiscal imbalance,
which was one of the main causes of inflation,'' Cardoso de Mello
said in a live television interview.
   To obtain the surplus, the government raised tax revenue 16
percent, cut planned investments 39 percent and reduced costs 18
percent, the minister said.
   She denied the spending cuts would bring recession to Brazil.
   ``We are working with the hypothesis of zero growth this year,''
she said. ``Even so, we can't talk of recession, but rather of an
accomodation of some sectors.''
   Collor, who took office March 15, originally promised a 2
percent budget surplus. But the minister said the 1.65 percent
surplus was still a success, ``because it shows the political
desire to combat inflation.''
   Inflation was 10 percent in June. It is expected to rise to 12
or 15 percent this month.
   The striking steel workers were demanding a pay increase of 188
percent to cover losses caused by the record inflation, union
leaders said.
   Bartolomu Cideli, financial director of the Steel Workers Union,
said all 22,000 workers at the National Steel Company's plant in
Volta Redonda were taking part in the strike. He said production
had been completely halted.
   Cideli spoke by phone from Volta Redonda, 80 miles west of Rio
de Janeiro.
   He said the strike was also to meant to protest the layoff of
almost 1,400 workers the past two months and the government's plan
to privatize the company.
   ``There is no way of telling how long the strike will last as
the company is not prepared to negotiate,'' he said. ``But we won't
go back to work until our basic demands are met.''
   In her comments, the economy minister said Brazil will send a
mission to Washington next week with a new budget to present to the
International Monetary Fund. An endorsement from the fund is
considered essential for a new agreement with creditor banks.
   Private banks hold nearly 70 percent of Brazil's $114 billion
foreign debt.

<HEAD>Bargainers Agree to Phase In Double Hull Requirement for Oil
Tankers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   House and Senate negotiators agreed late
Thursday that most single-hulled oil tankers should be phased out
over the next 20 years and all new tankers should be built with
double hulls.
   The agreement removed a major obstacle to oil spill protection
legislation Congress has been debating since the devastating spill
from the Exxon Valdez tanker off the Alaska coast in March 1989.
   Members working out differences between the House and Senate
bills hope to complete action on the legislation before the
upcoming August recess.
   Negotiators, by voice vote, agreed on a compromise timetable for
removing so-called single-hulled tankers to phase out the oldest
and largest ships beginning in 1995. A small number of tankers
would be allowed to operate until 2015, but most would be gone by
2010.
   Environmental groups in a letter to the conferees earlier this
week called a requirement for double-hull tankers ``the single most
important step Congress can take to prevent oil spills.'' The
petroleum industry has opposed a requirement for double hulls.
   There are more than 1,300 tankers of various sizes that
transport oil in and out of the United States and between U.S.
ports, according to congressional estimates.
   Double hulls provide added protection if a tanker runs aground
or collides with another ship. There have been conflicting studies
on whether the Alaska spill would have been significantly reduced
if the Exxon Valdez had a double hull.
   The bill approved by the Senate called for only a study of issue
and the original House version would have phased out single-hull
tankers by 2005.
   Environmental groups had called for the faster phase-out.
Clifton Curtis of Friends of the Earth called the compromise ``a
kiss on the cheek _ followed by a slap in the face.''
   The tanker hull issue was one of the thorniest in a package that
also calls for a $1 billion emergency response fund to deal with
oil spill cleanup and sets liability levels for spills. The
emergency response fund will comes from a 50-cent-a-barrel levy on
petroleum that began being collected last January.
   Senate and House sources said with the double-hull issue
resolved, the legislation, the subject of intense negotiations
between the House and Senate for months, may be approved before
Congress begins its summer recess Aug. 3.
   Under the compromise, new tankers must be constructed with
double hulls and existing single-hull tankers must begin to be
phased out of operation in 1995, with the largest and oldest
tankers to be taken out of service or retrofitted first.
   Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, said that under the timetable, 43
percent of tankers would likely have double hulls by the end of the
decade and 80 percent by the year 2005. Tankers that unload oil 60
miles outside U.S. waters and tankers that already have double
bottom or sides have until 2015 to comply.

   Hundreds of Monrovians fled in panic
Thursday after soldiers searched houses in the port city and fired
at a fishing boat suspected of carrying rebels.
   The latest disturbances came as peace talks began in Freetown,
the capital of neighboring Sierra Leone, between delegations
representing the Liberian rebels and the embattled government of
President Samuel K. Doe.
   Presidents Ibrahim Babangida of Nigeria and Felix
Houphouet-Boigny of the Ivory Coast also met on Thursday in
Yamoussoukro, Ivory Coast, to consider proposals to end the
6-month-old Liberian conflict, including introduction of an African
peacekeeping force.
   In Monrovia, troops fired into the Nigerian Embassy early
Thursday, where 150 Nigerians had sought refuge. Two bullets grazed
a guard's face.
   More than 6,000 Liberians and foreigners have sought refuge in
churches and embassy compounds in the rebel-besieged capital of
400,000 inhabitants.
   It was the army's second violation of a diplomatic mission'ck and cash.
   Current shareholders would get warrants to buy about 5.8 million
shares of the stock, or about 10 percent of the reorganized
company, Romanoff said. Bank creditors would get cash of about $55
million, plus about 47 percent of the reorganized firm's stock.
Other creditors would get about 43 percent of the company.
   The company and its advisers value the plan at about $687
million.
   Romanoff declined to speculate about how soon the company could
emerge from bankruptcy, but he said finalization would take at
least several weeks.

   Fox Broadcasting Co. announced Thursday that
it will start its fall season early with two programming moves
designed to snatch viewers from the three major networks.
   ``Babes,'' a half-hour comedy about three overweight sisters,
will make its debut Aug. 23 at 8:30 p.m.
   The hefty trio will be preceded on Thursday nights by repeats of
``The Simpsons,'' as the animated family moves sooner than planned
into its new time slot against NBC's top-rated ``The Cosby Show.''
   Original episodes of ``The Simpsons'' will begin in late
October. Fox's highly publicized decision to do battle with Bill
Cosby is the most daring aspect of the alternative network's fall
schedule.
   The announcement that ``Babes'' will start in six weeks came
just two days after Fox executives said the pilot was being redone
because some of its jokes were too raunchy.
   The 4-year-old Fox network hopes to gain viewers while ABC, CBS
and NBC are still broadcasting reruns.

   President Bush on Thursday welcomed Patriarch
Dimitrios, the spiritual leader of Orthodox Christians, to the
White House and thanked him for helping sustain the faith of people
in Eastern Europe.
   ``The world rejoices that the new freedoms of the past year mean
that your Orthodox followers in so many lands are now once again
able to follow freely and openly the road of holy light,'' Bush
later told Dimitrios in remarks at a banquet of the Greek Orthodox
Biennial Clergy-Laity Congress.
   ``We celebrate the dawn of hope for these people, particularly
those for whom you speak in Eastern Europe,'' Bush said in
reference to the democratic reforms in Eastern Europe over the last
year.
   He praised Dimitrios for ``unflinching devotion to the passing
on of clear moral values and your emphasis on the importance of a
good eduction.''
   Bush also praised the Orthodox community for ``deeply rooted
spiritual beliefs as well as the richness of your cultural life.''
   Dimitrios' domain includes the Greek and Russian Orthodox
denominations and a following of 250 million people, many in
Eastern Europe.
   His is the first U.S. visit by the Orthodox patriarch.
   Bush told Dimitrios at a Rose Garden photo session:
   ``As I survey the changes that are taking place in Eastern
Europe and around the world, our thoughts go to the faith of
individuals in so many countries, the faith that is sustained and
strengthened by the church and by the leadership of His Holiness.''
   ``Faith of people is a driving force for change,'' Bush added.
   The 75-year-old religious leader thanked Bush during their
meeting for his support and initiatives that have helped bring
about changes in Eastern Europe, according to his interpreter, the
Rev. Leonidas Contos.

<HEAD>Democrats Want Deeper Cuts in Aid to Salvador</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Democrats on Thursday rejected as too
small a Bush administration offer to cut military aid to El
Salvador, but they held out hope for eventual agreement on a
bipartisan policy toward the Central American country.
   ``The cuts just aren't deep enough,'' said Rep. Joseph Moakley,
D-Mass., the leader of a Democratic task force on El Salvador
appointed by House Speaker Thomas Foley.
   ``The initial offer was outrageously low,'' added Rep. David
Bonior, D-Mich., after a two-hour meeting with Bernard Aronson,
assistant secretary of state for the Western Hemisphere.
   According to documents made available to \te Associated Press,
the administration proposed to cut by 15 percent El Salvador's
expected 1991 allotment of $85 million in military aid.
   The withheld money would be made available to the Salvadoran
government only if several conditions were met, including adherence
by the government to a cease fire, participation in negotiations
aimed at a peaceful settlement of the 10-year civil war and reforms
of the military and judicial systems.
   There also would have to be ``significant progress'' toward
bringing to trial those responsible for the murder of eight people,
including six Jesuit priests, in San Salvador last November.
   To encourage the country's leftist rebels to also work toward
peace, the package would provide another 15 percent could be cut if
the rebels comply with the cease fire, negotiate in good faith and
forsake shipments of weapons from outside the country and terrorism.
   Although Democrats rejected the plan on Thursday, another
meeting was set for next week and both sides said they hoped a
compromise could be reached.
   Bonior said he wanted assurances that deeper cuts would be made
at the beginning of the fiscal year and that tighter requirements
on the Salvadoran government be written into the plan.
   The administration proposal, like one House Democrats wrote into
an emerging 1991 foreign aid bill, is designed to give both the
Salvadoran government and the rebels incentives to resolve their
conflict peacefully.
   The congressional proposal calls for an immediate 50 percent cut
in military aid. The remaining 50 percent could be cut if the
government abandons the peace talks or seeks to crush the FMLN
rebels militarily; the full amount could be restored if the rebels
mount a major offensive or walk away from the negotiating table.
   In talks in El Salvador earlier this week, Aronson pressed
authorities on the Jesuit murder case. A report by Moakley's task
force in April said the investigation had come to a virtual
standstill and that the Salvadoran government had showed no
interest in determining whether senior military officers were
responsible.
   El Salvador's decade-long civil war has cost more than 70,000
lives and has continued despite some $5 billion in U.S. economic
and military aid. Officials have been optimistic about peace
prospects in recent months, in part because they believe diminished
international support for the rebels will make them more flexible
in negotiations.
   The government and the guerrillas have had several rounds of
discussions this year. The next meeting is set for July 20 in Costa
Rica.

   A charter airplane that may have had engine
trouble hit a power line Thursday and crashed into a river,
blacking out hundreds of utility customers and killing a co-pilot.
   The break in a 46,000-volt power line left about 1,400 customers
without power from the mouth of Ogden Canyon eastward to
Huntsville, Eden, Liberty and Snowbasin and Powder Mountain ski
resorts, said Dave Mead of Utah Power &amp; Light Co. Most customers
regained service in a few hours, he said.
   The single-engine, six-seat Cessna 210 left Ogden Airport en
route to eastern Utah's Dutch John, near Flaming Gorge, to pick up
a couple of fishermen, said Weber County Sheriff George Fisher.
   ``It appears they had engine trouble and were coming back down
the canyon,'' he said.
   ``Someone did a beautiful job of bringing it down ... if they
hadn't hit the power lines, they could have landed on the road,''
he said.
   Floyd Leonard ``Buddy'' Hatley, 60, died and Floyd Henry Duncan
Jr., 52, believed to have been in control of the plane, was
critically injured when they crashed on the Ogden River, he said.
   The plane was owned by the men's employer, Great Western
Aviation Inc., Ogden Air Service.

<HEAD>British Spy Case of 1960s Reaches High Court</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A panel of British judges Thursday began hearing
requests to stop the trial of two men accused of helping a Soviet
double agent escape from prison _ a charge they admitted in a book
last year.
   Patrick Pottle and Michael Randle, known as peace activists in
the 1960s, admitted helping Soviet spy George Blake flee in their
book titled ``The Blake Escape: How We Freed George Blake and Why.''
   Legal authorities opened the case against them only after they
published their work. They are accused of helping Blake escape from
London's Wormwood Scrubs prison in 1966.
   At Thursday's hearing, their lawyers asked the High Court to
overturn a lower court ruling in April to let the trial go forward.
They are challenging the court's jurisdiction to hear the case.
   Blake, 67, was a double agent who confessed to spying for the
Soviets while employed by British intelligence. He was jailed in
1961 for 42 years, the longest spy sentence ever imposed by a
British court.
   Pottle and Randle said in their book that they helped Blake
because of the ``cruel and inhuman sentence.'' They said
authorities knew of their involvement by 1970 but decided not to
prosecute.
   They now face charges of aiding Blake's escape and conspiracy.
The escape charge carries a maximum sentence of five years, while
the conspiracy charge has a maximum sentence of two years or an
unlimited fine.
   Pottle, 52, works as an antiques dealer, and 56-year-old Randle
is a researcher.

<TEXT>
   Leftist guerrillas attacked an army post in
the eastern jungle and killed 20 soldiers in the latest flareup of
this country's political violence, police said Thursday.
   The same day, guerrillas shot to death two policemen and a
civilian bystander as the officers ate breakfast at an outdoor
counter in Lima. Two other civilians were wounded.
   Police blamed the Lima attack on the Maoist group Shining Path.
   The same group was blamed for an attack Wednesday night at Urpay
by 80 rebels. The town of Urpay is 10 miles east of the highland
city of Ayacucho.
   The guerrillas killed eight members of a community civil defense
group.
   Police in Pucallpa, a major jungle town 300 miles northeast of
Lima, said about 300 rebels of the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary
Movement surrounded and attacked the nearby army base Wednesday
afternoon.
   Police said many people were wounded in the three-hour battle,
but they did not have a figure. They said an unknown number of
rebels were killed in addition to the 20 soldiers.
   Local military officials would not comment on the attack.
   Wednesday's attack came three days after 48 rebels from the same
group, including reputed leader Victor Polay, staged a spectacular
prison break from a maximum security prison in Lima. The rebels
fled before dawn Monday through a 660-foot tunnel they had dug.
   The government declared a state of emergency following the
breakout. Police have arrested thousands in sweeps through Lima's
streets and shantytowns looking for the escapees.
   The escape was a great embarrassment for the outgoing government
of President Alan Garcia. Many opposition leaders have called for
the resignations of his ministers of justice and interior.
   The Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement is a pro-Cuban group that
started its insurgency in 1984. It takes its name from an 18th
century mestizo revolutionary who led a peasant revolt against
Spanish colonial rule.
   Ayacucho, 235 miles southeast of Lima in the Andean highlands,
is the birthplace of the Shining Path. That group took up arms
against Peru's elected governments in 1980.
   The government says more than 18,500 people have been killed in
the 10 years of political violence.

<TEXT>
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley on Thursday
accused Common Cause, the biggest public advocacy group behind
legislation to reform election spending, of conducting a
``scurrilous campaign'' against Democrats.
   Foley, D-Wash., called the group's ads in the hometown
newspapers of 13 House Democrats ``the lowest point in the public
presentation of issues by Common Cause in its history.''
   ``This is not the organization that I think carries forward the
spirt of John Gardner,'' Common Cause's founder and one-time
secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, Foley said.
   In the past month, the 280,000-member organization chaired by
former Watergate prosecutor Archibald Cox has mailed out editorials
and other material calling the leading House Democratic campaign
finance proposal a ``sham.''
   With several campaign finance bills now stalled in both the
House and Senate, Common Cause escalated its grass-roots pitch last
week with the ads linking millions of dollars politicians received
from political action committees to the savings and loan crisis.
   Under a headline reading ``S&amp;L interests gave members of
Congress millions, taxpayers were ripped off for billions ... and
Congress has done nothing,'' the group targeted the 13 House
Democrats, two Senate Democrats and seven Senate Republicans.
   Each of the senators was accused at the bottom of the ads of
helping kill a campaign finance reform bill two years ago.
   The ads targeting House members focused on how much money they
received from ``PACs representing special interests'' during recent
past elections. All were urged to vote for major cuts in allowable
PAC gifts and told, ``Don't vote for the House Democrats' fake
campaign reform bill.''
   For example, a July 3 ad in The (Hackensack) Record targeted
Rep. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., as receiving $579,000 in PAC money
the past three elections.
   ``The ad is dishonest, it is untruthful,'' Torricelli said,
citing another public interest group's determination that he had a
``nearly perfect record on S&amp;L votes in the public interest.''
   ``... They should be placing the blame where it is, not saying
that environmental organizations, labor unions, students, senior
citizen organizations who represent these PAC contributions are
somehow part of the problem,'' he said.
   Foley accused the group of using ``tactics of innuendo and
inference that are typical of the worst elements of campaign
advertising.''
   Common Cause President Fred Wertheimer called the ad campaign
``fair and appropriate.''
   ``The bottom line is we have a rotten campaign finance system in
Congress and that system is one of the reasons we wound up with an
S&amp;L scandal that will cost every taxpayer $2,500,'' Wertheimer said.

   Raunchy comedian Andrew Dice Clay may not
impress many movie critics, but his new film ``The Adventures of
Ford Fairlane'' has opened to strong business.
   According to figures released Thursday by 20th Century Fox, the
movie grossed $2.1 million in its debut Wednesday night, playing on
1,201 screens in North America.
   ``It's working everywhere, right across the board. It exceeded
my expectations. ... I don't think the reviews have had any
impact,'' said Tom Sherak, head of Fox's domestic distribution and
marketing.
   Fox was concerned that Clay, who stars in the film as a
detective, was not a box-office draw outside big cities. But Fox's
research found that he is attracting a young male audience in most
markets.
   Meanwhile, the studio's ``Die Hard 2'' has grossed more money in
its first week of release than any of this summer's other releases.
According to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc., ``Die Hard 2'' made
$37.2 million after seven days.
   After their first weeks, ``Total Recall'' made $36.1 million and
``Dick Tracy'' netted $34.7 million.

   A messenger and mail room clerk with a history
of psychiatric problems and a drug conviction was charged Thursday
in connection with the ``Dartman'' attacks on women in midtown
Manhattan.
   Jerome Wright, 33, of the Bronx, was arrested after being
identified in a lineup by three of the 55 women who have reported
feeling the sting of makeshift darts aimed at their backsides
during the past three weeks.
   With Wright's arrest, police predicted the attacks would end.
   ``We believe he is our darter,'' Chief Joseph DeMartino, who
heads the Manhattan detective division, said at a news conference
announcing Wright's arrest.
   The chief said Wright admitted to the three attacks. He also
``indicated to us he has been under observation for psychiatric
problems.''
   DeMartino was less positive about the suspect's motive. ``Mr.
Wright has made numerous statements to us, none of which has given
us real insight into why he is doing this,'' he said.
   Wright was charged with three counts each of reckless
endangerment, criminal possession of a weapon and harassment.
Police said it was unlikely he would be charged in any other
attacks since most of the women did not see their assailant.
   The oddball attacks began June 26 when women started complaining
of being stung in the buttocks, legs and arms. In addition to the
Manhattan attacks, one woman reported being stung in Queens.
   The Dartman targeted women in dresses or skirts, and used
homemade darts fashioned out of pins and sewing needles attached to
paper guides. Most of the incidents occurred in the Penn Station
and Times Square areas during lunchtime.
   Wright, who is on probation until 1992 for a drug conviction,
works in the area as a messenger and mail room clerk, which puts
him on the streets during the day, DeMartino said.
   DeMartino said Wright was stopped by two police officers Tuesday
because he fit the description of the Dartman.
   The officers took Wright's name and address and gave it to
detectives investigating the attacks, the chief said. The
detectives called Wright the next day and asked him to come in for
questioning.
   Wright voluntarily went to a precinct house where he was
questioned for more than eight hours. The lineups were conducted
late Wednesday and Wright was arrested early Thursday.
   DeMartino said Wright is unmarried and lives with an aunt.

   The police radio would squawk, a dispatcher
would rasp ``Confirmed shooting ...'', and we, the Zodiac watchers,
would tense. So it went throughout the night, as police and
journalists waited for another strike from the man who had shot
four people.
   Elsewhere in the city, police had better luck against the
Dartman, arresting a suspect in three of 55 dart-blowing attacks on
women.
   The ``Night of the Zodiac'' did not see a fifth shooting by the
astrologically obsessed gunman. But the police at least half
expected one; it had been 21 days since the last shooting, and two
of the other attacks came after the same interval.
   On Wednesday night, that fact brought out legions of police and
press, the latter to see if Zodiac turned up, the former to capture
him if he did.
   In the Dartman case, authorities said Jerome Wright, 33, a
messenger with a criminal record and admitted psychiatric problems,
was charged Thursday after several hours of interrogation in
connection with the firing of darts at more than 50 well-dressed
women, most in midtown Manhattan.
   Wright was identified in a lineup by three women on Wednesday
night and was charged with three counts each of reckless
endangerment, criminal possession of a weapon and harassment.
   ``We believe he is our darter,'' said Manhattan Chief of
Detectives Joseph DeMartino.
   But the search for Zodiac went on. My assignment was to team up
with a photographer and stay up all night, driving around. Listen
to police scanners. Chase shooting reports. Get there first.
   The cycle of shootings started March 8, with other shootings on
March 29, May 31 and June 21. The time between the second and third
shootings was 63 days, a multiple of 21. Each shooting had occurred
early on a Thursday. Of the four shooting victims, one was dead.
   The police had gleaned possible shooting locations from
astrological charts, occult books, FBI psychological profiles and
notes the bizarre gunman has sent to police and the media, vowing
to shoot one person from each Zodiac sign.
   So the photographer and I left the office at 8 p.m. and drove to
the area along the Brooklyn-Queens line where the first three
shootings occurred. Here is what we saw and heard:
   _ 8:45, East New York: At the Grecian III diner, which the
gunman referred to in his first letter to police, employees say
they recognize the Zodiac sketch as that of a former customer. But
he ``hasn't been here in three or four weeks,'' the manager says.
   _ 9:00, Nichols and Jamaica avenues, site of Zodiac's second
shooting: Tom Thompson, 37, believes he has it figured out. ``He
won't be in this neighborhood tonight,'' he says. ``Too many cops
here. This neighborhood is hot as a firecracker.''
   _ 10:07: ``Units take note,'' a dispatcher on a citywide police
radio frequency announces, ``Operation Watchdog is in effect.''
   ``Operation Watchdog'' took in 50 officers, many of them decoy
police, who fanned out through the city to the suspected locations.
When the radio crackled with reports of other shootings that did
not fit the Zodiac pattern, the officers were to stay put. Or, as
the dispatcher said at midnight, ``Designated officers will not
respond to any incident unless confirmed incident announced.''
   _ 1:15, Central Park, near the scene of the last shooting: Not a
soul in sight, except for the occasional four-door sedan with two
front-seat occupants _ undercover police.
   Suddenly, the radio announces a shooting in Brooklyn. When we
arrive, we find it was an attempted gas station robbery. An
attendant was shot in the leg.
   _ 3:25: Shooting in Brooklyn. We speed to the site, but a
plainclothes officer says Zodiac is not involved. ``Your standard
70th precinct drug- or money-related dispute involving a gun,'' he
says.
   _ 4:00: Driving through Brooklyn's Prospect Park, we spot a red
lump in the grass. We find a man in a brand new sleeping bag who is
not asleep. ``My wife threw me out,'' he says. Isn't he worried
about the Zodiac? ``I don't care, I'm a Virgo,'' he replies. We
return to the car, discuss his appearance and his admission of his
birth sign, and decide he's a decoy cop.
   _ 5:20, Bedford-Stuyvesant: We hear a suspect is at the 79th
Precinct station house, but it turns out the police brought in a
Zodiac-sketch lookalike, questioned him for 10 minutes, and let him
go.
   _ 5:45: ``Blue Angel units, White Angel units, your EOT is 0600
hours,'' squawks the police radio. EOT means end of tour, and
dozens of units confirm.
   _ 6 a.m.: We call it a night. Apparently Zodiac stayed home.

   People who live downwind from the Hanford
nuclear reservation reacted with anger and relief Thursday about
the government's disclosure that enough radiation spewed from the
base to cause cancer.
   ``I feel like they used us for guinea pigs, and I don't feel
like they cared one iota what happened to us either, or our
families,'' said Betty Perkes, a farmer in Pasco, which is next to
the 560-square-mile reservation.
   An independent panel of scientists released preliminary data
Thursday that showed some residents in the early years of
atomic-bomb building in the 1940s could have been exposed to large
doses of radioactive iodine. For a few infants, the doses were as
high as 2,900 rad over three years. One rad is the amount of
radiation a body organ would absorb from about a dozen chest X-rays.
   Terry Frazee of the state Health Department said radiation
standards allow a maximum of five rads a year for industrial
workers, although individual organs can handle greater amounts.
   Dr. George Laramore, professor of radiological oncology at the
University of Washington School of Medicine, recommended that
people who were infants in the Hanford area during the period be
checked for thyroid conditions. But he added that thyroid tumors
would likely have appeared five to 15 years after exposure.
   Survivors of the U.S. atomic bombings of Japan at the end of
World War II received thyroid doses estimated at 130 rad, Laramore
said, adding that some nuclear medicine treatments use doses as
high as 800 rads.
   The preliminary study results came a day after Energy Secretary
James Watkins admitted past Hanford emissions may have caused
health problems.
   John Till, a South Carolina consultant who chaired the 18-member
panel of scientists and experts, cautioned that the figures were
not meant as health risk estimates.
   But, Till added, ``These numbers are significant because that is
a lot of folks. That dose level is significant enough to strongly
justify a thyroid dose study.''
   A parallel study by the federal Centers for Disease Control will
use the exposure estimates to try to document cases of thyroid
disease among Hanford-area residents.
   The Hanford Environmental Dose Reconstruction Project concluded
that most people living near the Hanford site from 1944 to 1947
were exposed to low doses of radiation. The study covered 270,000
people living in 10 Washington and Oregon counties.
   But up to 13,500 people may have received doses of more than 33
rad of radioactive iodine from the milk they drank.
   About 1,400 infants and children living in the area received 15
to 650 rad, Till said, including a small number of infants who may
have received doses of 2,900 rad or more.
   The radioactive iodine was produced when spent reactor fuel rods
were chemically dissolved to produce weapons-grade plutonium and
uranium. When it concentrates in the thyroid gland, iodine-131 can
cause cancer and other diseases.
   Till said that by comparison, doses downwind from the Nevada
nuclear weapons testing site ranged from a few rad to 500 rad.
   ``I know of no other releases of this magnitude from any other
U.S. facility,'' Till said of the 1944-47 period, noting that
modern releases are extremely small.
   ``Downwinders,'' people living directly east of the installation
during the years of heaviest releases of radioactive iodine, called
a news conference after the report was released to express
confidence in the Technical Steering Panel's work and anger at the
government's long record of secrecy.
   ``We really believe we're getting the truth now,'' said Tom
Bailie, a Mesa farmer whose family's history of cancers and other
medical problems have been extensively chronicled in news reports
about the downwinders.
   Although the government cannot be sued under the doctrine of
sovereign immunity, Bailie said compensation could be sought
through Congress, similar to that recently given to uranium miners
for radiation-related illnesses.
   ``The federal government owes something if folks have been
harmed by these early releases of radiation,'' Rep. Sid Morrison,
R-Wash., whose district includes the reservation, said in
Washington, D.C. ``While these estimates are preliminary and they
will change, the potential for harmful side effects is with us to
stay.''
   At the downwinder news conference, residents gave a litany of
family health problems, including thyroid dysfunctions and cancers,
that they attributed to the radiation releases.
   ``For a lot of years, I have been hunting every scrap of
newspaper I could find to see why this is happening,'' said Mary
Pengelly, who lives in Kirkland and was raised near Pendleton, Ore.
``It makes me feel that maybe ... we're going to see some answers.''
   The Technical Steering Panel was appointed in 1988 after health
concerns were raised by the release in February 1986 of 19,000
pages of previously classified Hanford environmental documents.
   The phased, five-year, $15 million study is intended to create
computer models of possible radiation doses to nearby residents.
   The first phase studied airborne radioactive iodine emissions
during from 1944-47 and radioactive cooling water poured into the
Columbia River from 1964-67.
   Because of prevailing west-to-east winds, the affected area lies
roughly east of Hanford, with larger radiation doses affecting
those who lived closest to the reservation, Till said.
   Most at risk were infants near Hanford's eastern border who
drank a lot of milk from family owned cows, Till said.
   On Wednesday, Watkins told reports in Washington, D.C., that the
implications of the report were serious.
   It was the government's first admission that the leaks were at
levels sufficient to cause cancer and other illnesses in people
living near Hanford.
   ``I don't want you to think we do this today,'' Watkins said.
``But we do have to go back and look at what happened to people.''
   The inch-thick preliminary report contains hundreds of pages of
tables listing dose ``pathways'' in each U.S. Census area among the
10 counties. The counties are: Benton, Franklin, Walla Walla,
Adams, Grant, Kittitas, Yakima and Klickitat in Washington and
Oregon's Morrow and Umatilla.

   Two Jamaicans wanted on drug-trafficking,
racketeering and murder charges in the United States were arrested
in Jamaica, the U.S. Marshals Service said on Thursday.
   Both were arrested this week by Jamaican police near Kingston,
the Caribbean nation's capital.
   ``This is the first time the Jamaican government has begun
extradition procedures against Jamaican citizens,'' in cooperation
with the U.S. government, said Joyce McDonald, spokeswoman for the
Marshal Service.
   Officials said the pair are believed to be leaders of a Jamaican
organized crime group known as the ``Shower Posse'' based in
Florida.
   One of the men, Richard Orville Morrison, 35, is among the
service's ``15 Most Wanted'' fugitives and has been sought on
federal drug charges since October 1988.
   Lester Coke, 42, has been wanted since September 1988 on
narcotics and racketeering charges, including nine murders.
   Morrison also was named along with Coke in a November 1984
killing in Miami.
   They are being held pending extradition to the United States.

   The head of a teen-age girl was found in a
freezer, and she probably was killed and dismembered as part of a
satanic ritual, according to police, who arrested two people in the
case.
   A Saginaw man and a juvenile were arrested Wednesday after two
women found the head in a freezer of a house in this town 15 miles
north of Detroit and took it to police, said Deputy Police Chief
Carl Muschong.
   The head had been cleaned of skin and hair, he said.
   Jaime Rodriguez Jr., 21, was arraigned Thursday on charges of
first-degree murder, conspiracy to commit first-degree murder and
mutilation of a human body, said Warren police Sgt. Robert Ahrens.
   A hearing was adjourned Thursday for a 15-year-old Saginaw boy
who was apparently staying at the Warren home where the body was
found, Ahrens said.
   He was being held at a youth home until a hearing set for
Tuesday, he said. Police said he was expected to be charged with
similar offenses.
   Murder and conspiracy are both punishable by life in prison and
mutilation is a 10-year-felony.
   Saginaw police said Rodriguez also was wanted on robbery,
kidnapping, extortion, auto theft and weapons charges.
   Police found body parts wrapped in garbage bags buried in the
house's back yard and hidden in a black car in the garage, Muschong
said. The car had been reported stolen earlier in Saginaw, he said.
   Several books and cassettes about witchcraft were found in the
basement, leading police to believe that the girl was the victim of
an occult ritual, Muschong said.
   Neighbors said there had been trouble at the house for more than
two years. Some said fighting in the streets and parties that
lasted through the night were common and police were called often.
   ``It really is a creepy feeling,'' said Berta LaPointe, who
lives three doors away from the house and watched the police carry
bags of body parts out of the back yard.
   Police Commissioner Paul Pash said no illegal activity was
uncovered at the house during previous calls.
   ``We'll try to interview anybody that has had contact with that
house, and we'll check missing persons from that area,'' Muschong
said. ``We'll have a description when we get it all to the medical
examiner and he can put it all together.''
   Police believe the victim is a 15-year-old reported missing June
26, Ahrens said. He said a positive identification had yet to be
made using dental records, but ``we're pretty confident that it's
her.''
   An autopsy determined the girl died recently.

   A House Democrat suggested Thursday that a
$10,000 donation to the Republicans by a business partner of
President Bush's son could have been aimed at blocking an
investigation concerning a Colorado savings and loan association.
   The partner dismissed the allegation as ``total unadulterated
nonsense,'' and the No. 2 House Republican said a separate
Democratic move _ toward requesting a special prosecutor for the
S&amp;L's collapse _ had ``the stench of corruption and hypocrisy.''
   In a day of charges and countercharges concerning the
institution where Neil Bush was a director, Rep. Frank Annunzio of
Illinois suggested developer Kenneth M. Good's $10,000 contribution
to the Republican National Committee on Nov. 2, 1988, could have
been ``a donation of hush money.''
   Annunzio, who has accused the Bush administration of not
prosecuting savings and loan fraud vigorously, didn't provide
specific evidence to back up his allegations.
   Meanwhile, action as well as talk was escalating in Congress on
the explosive S&amp;L issue and Neil Bush's role in the collapse of
Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan Association. Bush, 34, was a
director of the Denver thrift, which failed at a cost to taxpayers
of $1 billion.
   Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee are moving to ask
Attorney General Dick Thornburgh to appoint an independent counsel
to investigate Silverado's collapse, Rep. Patricia Schroeder,
D-Colo., said Thursday.
   ``The case has criminal implications that should be aggressively
investigated,'' said a letter that had been signed by 11 of the
committee's Democrats by Thursday night.
   The law requires the signature of at least 12 Democrats, a
majority of the 21 on the committee, to make the request.
   The letter sparked an outraged reaction from No. 2 House
Republican Newt Gingrich, D-Ga., who criticized congressional
Democrats for seeking to investigate the president's son while
trying to block past probes of Democrats accused of wrongdoing.
   Republicans have said Democrats are trying to use the Neil Bush
case as a way of attacking his father.
   The Democrats' letter to Thornburgh said that because Neil Bush
and several other people with political connections were associated
with the bank, it would be a conflict of interest for the Justice
Department itself to conduct the investigation of Silverado.
   Thornburgh, in a news conference Wednesday, said, ``I am not a
great fan of independent counsels, as you know, but we know our
obligations under the law and will execute them.''
   A spokesman said that if legislators formally requested a
special prosecutor he would review the request and respond within
30 days.
   Good, in a statement issued by his attorney, said, ``My
contribution to the Republican Party in 1988 was two years after my
relationship with Silverado was terminated through a negotiated
settlement.''
   ``With no evidence whatsoever, Mr. Annunzio has accused a
private citizen of criminal activity. He is spreading vicious,
false accusations in the public arena without any basis. ... No
government agency at any level has accused me of any wrongdoing,''
Good said.
   Good donated more than $90,000 to Republican candidates in the
1987-88 period, including $5,750 for George Bush's presidential
bid, the Federal Election Commission said. Some $85,000 _ to
candidates other than Bush _ was given in November 1988 just before
the elections.
   The developer, who also invested over $3 million in Neil Bush's
oil exploration company, was the fifth-largest individual political
contributor in Colorado in 1988, according to a study by the Center
for Responsive Politics.
   His contributions included $750 in August 1986 and $5,000 in
October 1987 for the Bush presidential campaign, said Scott Moxley,
a spokesman for the Federal Election Commission.
   The developer also contributed to the campaigns of several
Democrats, including Sen. Robert Kerrey of Nebraska ($500), Sen.
Timothy E. Wirth of Colorado ($2,000) and Sen. George J. Mitchell
of Maine ($500), according to the Federal Election Commission.
   During Neil Bush's tenure on its board, Silverado loaned Good
around $30 million that was never repaid. Federal regulators have
ordered the president's son to answer allegations of conflict of
interest in his role as a director of the thrift.
   Among accusations, the regulators allege that he failed to
adequately disclose his ties to Good. Bush has denied any
wrongdoing, and the president has defended the ``honor and
integrity'' of his son at news conferences.
   Annunzio said Good's donation to the Republicans, made shortly
before the election that brought George Bush to the White House,
could have been aimed at blocking a Justice Department
investigation of Good as a Silverado borrower.
   Annunzio said officials of the Office of Thrift Supervision made
five criminal referrals concerning Silverado to the Justice
Department, but the thrift office has refused to give him the names
or dates of those referrals.
   He speculated that one of the referrals could have involved
Good, and that the information is not being made public because the
referrals could have been made at around the same time Good
contributed the $10,000.
   Annunzio sent a letter Thursday to Thornburgh requesting copies
of the five Silverado referrals.
   Justice Department spokesman Doug Tillett said Thursday the
names of any people who might be involved wouldn't be made public
since they would be part of a pending investigation. He wouldn't
confirm whether Silverado referrals had been made to the department.
   Neil Bush's attorney, James Nesland, said his client would have
no comment.
   Good recently told a House Banking Committee hearing on
Silverado that his net worth has plummeted from $100 million to
less than zero.
   Campaign finance records show that Good donated $42,500 to
Republican candidates in Colorado and an equal amount to
Republicans in California, both in early November of 1988.

   Lockheed Corp. delivered the 59th and
last F-117A stealth fighter to the Air Force on Thursday in a
well-publicized ceremony that contrasted sharply with the secrecy
that veiled the jet for a decade.
   Delivery from Lockheed's famed supersecret Skunk Works division
comes as the defense firm girds for heated competition with
Northrop Corp. to build the Advanced Tactical Fighter for the Air
Force of the next century.
   The ATF contract for hundreds of warplanes is the last big
ticket item on the Pentagon shopping list for the end of the 20th
century and represents the major spoils of what is left in the
rapidly shrinking U.S. defense budget.
   Gen. Michael J. Dugan, the new Air Force chief of staff,
described the F-117A as an example of a ``small is beautiful''
philosophy promoted by Skunk Works founder Kelly Johnson and noted
that the program finished within budget and ahead of schedule.
   ``We are going to be a smaller Air Force,'' Dugan said. ``We are
going to be a little smaller and little smarter. ... Small can be
beautiful.''
   Still, at a cost of $42.6 million a plane, the F-117A remains
one of the most expensive fighter aircraft ever built. Part of the
cost resides in program secrecy imposed in 1981.
   The project was accomplished with the strictest security
measures known since the Manhattan Project to build the atom bomb
during World War II, former Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci has
said.
   What the Air Force got for its money is a force of a little more
than 50 planes. The black, sharply angled jet is actually a ground
attack aircraft able to sneak past radar while dropping bombs with
pinpoint accuracy.
   The last delivery was announced in big newspaper advertisements
which have become common in the aerospace industry since the
defense budget began shrinking and firms and the services have
become eager to show off advanced, operational hardware that once
was secret.
   About 500 people attended the ceremony at Lockheed's Palmdale
plant.
   A Northrop-led team has already rolled out its ATF prototype but
Lockheed's prototype is not expected until late summer.
   Both Northrop and Lockheed are laying off many workers in
Southern California.
   For Lockheed's part, the company hopes its breakthrough in
stealth technology will help in the winner-take-all contract to
build the ATF.
   The stealth fighter was built at the top-secret Skunk Works that
developed such other high-technology aircraft as the U-2 and the
Mach 3 SR-71 Blackbird spyplanes.
   ``Let the nation know we are ready to do it again,'' said Skunk
Works chief Ben Rich.
   If Lockheed gets the ATF contract, the Calabasas, Calif.-based
contractor said it would build the fighters for the $63 billion
program in Georgia.
   Northrop would build ATF planes in California at Palmdale.

   The House passed landmark legislation on
Thursday guaranteeing rights to millions of disabled Americans,
including access to public transportation, businesses and jobs.
   Approval of the Americans with Disabilities Act, by a 377-28
vote, came after House and Senate negotiators agreed on a way to
protect the jobs of AIDS-infected workers who handle food.
   Rep. William E. Dannemeyer, R-Calif., and others tried
unsuccessfully to restore an amendment that would have let
employers keep AIDS-infected workers away from food-handling duties.
   The Senate will vote on the bill Friday morning, said Senate
Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine.
   President Bush has urged passage of the bill, one of the most
significant pieces of domestic legislation of his term. The bill
has been hailed as the most significant civil rights legislation
since the 1964 act prohibiting racial discrimination.
   ``It is indeed a bill which will open up America to 43 million
Americans who have been shut out, sometimes consciously, but too
often subconsciously,'' said the chief House sponsor, Rep. Steny
Hoyer, D-Md.
   Among the measure's key provisions:
   _Restaurants, stores, professional offices and all other
businesses must make their services available to people with
disabilities, provided the cost of doing so is not excessive. The
requirement takes effect 18 months after enactment, except for
small businesses, which would have longer.
   _Businesses with 15 or more employees must disregard handicaps
in hiring decisions and make special accommodations, at the
employer's cost, for those disabilities. The accommodation is
limited by the financial hardship it will cause for the company.
The requirement will be phased in over four years.
   _Amtrak, commuter rail systems and local and intercity bus
systems will have to provide areas for disabled passengers,
including those in wheelchairs.
   _All telephone companies will have to provide special services
for people with speech and hearing impairments.
   Opponents of the bill , such as Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind.,
complain the bill is vaguely worded and will ``create a firestorm''
of lawsuits at the expense of the economy.
   The bill caps two years of efforts, including negotiations last
summer with the White House.
   The Senate passed the bill last September by a 76-8 vote. The
House passed its version of the bill in May by a 403-20 vote.
   The House, however, added an amendment to let employers reassign
workers with AIDS so they couldn't come into contact with food. An
attempt to resurrect that amendment failed Thursday night by a
224-180 vote.
   Under a compromise approved earlier Thursday by House and Senate
negotiators, the Department of Health and Human Services would be
required each year to study all communicable diseases and how they
are transmitted. The House vote on the bill approves that
compromise, which originated Wednesday in the Senate.
   Under the compromise, employers in the food industry would be
able to reassign workers whose diseases may be spread to customers
through contact with food.
   The compromise effectively negates the earlier House amendment.
Health and Human Services Secretary Louis W. Sullivan and other
leading health officials have repeatedly stated the disease cannot
be spread through such casual contact.
   Proponents of the House amendment included Sen. Jesse Helms,
R-N.C., who unsuccessfully sought to have the Senate adopt it.
Helms and others said public fears about AIDS could drive
restaurants out of business despite scientific evidence.
   Those voting against the bill were:
   Reps. Bill Archer, R-Texas; Richard K. Armey, R-Texas; Joe
Barton, R-Texas; Herbert H. Bateman, R-Va.; Dan Burton, R-Ind.; Jim
Chapman, D-Texas; Jim Cooper, D-Tenn.; Philip M. Crane, R-Ill.;

Olin, D-Va.; Ron Packard, R-Calif.; Mike Parker, D-Miss.; Norman D.
Shumway, R-Calif.; Bud Shuster, R-Pa.; Charles W. Stenholm,

   Not voting were:

<HEAD>Arizona Supreme Court Says Impeached Governor Can Run Again</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Former Gov. Evan Mecham can run for office again
despite his 1988 impeachment and ouster from office, the Arizona
Supreme Court ruled Thursday.
   ``Impeachment, essentially a political process, is not subject
to judicial review,'' the state's highest court said in a unanimous
decision. ``Any appeal from the impeachment conviction lies in the
electoral process.''
   A former highway patrolman, Dennis Ingram, challenged Mecham's
re-election bid, saying the Arizona Constitution automatically
barred him from running again.
   The justices decided, 5-0, that the state constitution was
unclear on that point and that ``election, the ultimate weapon of
democracy, is favored where any doubt exists.''
   Mecham was convicted of misuse of about $80,000 given him by
supporters and obstruction of justice in a cover-up of an alleged
death threat made by an aide.
   ``As expected, the court made the only decision that we could
see that they could make,'' Mecham said at a campaign stop in Yuma.
``We appreciate that and now let's get on with the election and let
the people do the choosing of who their next governor's going to be
and get on with solving the critical problems of the state.''
   Mecham filed as a gubernatorial candidate last month for the
Sept. 11 Republican primary. He faces four primary opponents.
   With incumbent Gov. Rose Mofford stepping down, the
gubernatorial race is wide open. Former Phoenix Mayor Terry Goddard
is considered the Democratic front-runner.
   Ingram contended Mecham's impeachment and conviction
automatically barred Mecham from ever again seeking office.
   ``I'm disappointed, obviously,'' said Michael Meehan, Ingram's
lawyer.
   Mecham argued the state constitution does not automatically ban
him from seeking public office and the state Senate rejected such a
ban.
   The Senate convicted Mecham by a two-thirds vote but came up
three votes short of a two-thirds majority when it considered a
``Dracula clause,'' which would have banned him from holding public
office.
   Mecham and Arizona Attorney General Bob Corbin said
disqualification from holding office is discretionary and the only
thing the constitution required was removal from office.
   Ingram has declined to discuss his motivation for filing the
challenge to Mecham's comeback attempt.
   Mecham has said he believes one of his political opponents was
behind Ingram's challenge, but Meehan denied that.

   Thirty-nine Haitians drowned when their
sailboat capsized in choppy seas in the Bahamas while being towed
by a military patrol boat, according to a government statement
Thursday.
   Sixty-seven others aboard the unnamed 45-foot sailing sloop were
rescued after it sank Tuesday afternoon, the Bahamian government
said.
   The government did not explain what caused the sloop to sink
while under tow.
   The Bahamian Defence Force vessel HMBS Yellow Elder, under the
command of Lt. Cmdr. Godfrey Rolle, spotted the Haitian vessel at
11:30 a.m. Tuesday off Staniel Cay, about 200 miles southeast of
the southern tip of Florida near Great Exuma island.
   The sloop tried to enter shallow waters and the patrol boat
pursued, catching up to the vessel and taking it under tow,
according to the statement. During the tow back to Staniel Cay, the
sloop capsized.
   One Haitian radio station reported that the tow line broke,
while another said that panicked Haitians ran to one side of the
vessel when Bahamian soldiers boarded the vessel.
   The bodies of the 30 men and nine women were buried Wednesday at
Bitter Guana Cay in the Exumas, about 80 miles from Nassau, the
statement said.
   Defence Forces officials Thursday night did not return calls
from The Associated Press.
   A fishing guide, Walter Robinson, said the bodies of the
Haitians were placed on a raft, covered with a canvas and brought
into Black Point on the Great Guana Cay.
   He said he helped a police boat tow the raft with his skiff,
navigating between shallow flats and rocky heads.
   Robinson said he arrived at 2 a.m. Wednesday after being called
to the scene to help move the bodies.
   ``There was nobody to take charge of the bodies. I put the raft
into the beach, took a grapple overboard and pulled it up on the
island and tied it to the beach and left them there,'' Robinson
said.
   The surviving Haitians were brought to Nassau on Wednesday.
   Defense Force divers were searching the sunken vessel Thursday
for more bodies.

   Pro-Sandinista workers jumped for joy
and began returning to their jobs Thursday after the U.S.-backed
government gave in to strike demands in order to settle a
destructive work stoppage.
   Former President Daniel Ortega called the settlement a victory
for the Sandinistas that preserved a basic ``conquest of the
revolution'' _ land reform.
   A Sandinista strike in May ended with a 100 percent pay raise.
   Businesses opened Thursday in Managua and workers began to
replace street paving stones torn up to build barricades.
   Six people were killed and 100 wounded in clashes between
strikers and government supporters during the 10-day strike that
tested the stability of President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro and
her government, which replaced Ortega's government on April 25.
   The government met many Sandinista demands: salary increases,
compensation for fired government workers, suspension of a decree
to return Sandinista-confiscated land to its original owners, and
restoration of free public transportation for students.
   Unions also appeared to have made headway in their demand for a
role in running the economy in this country of 3.7 million
residents.
   In Washington, State Department deputy spokesman Richard Boucher
said the administration was pleased the strikes had ended.
   But he assailed Sandinista authorities, saying they have been
unwilling to grant the government the breathing spell it needs to
get desperately needed economic reconstruction under way.
   Ortega denied the strike was a Sandinista attempt to undermine
the government and said senior party leaders played a pivotal role
in settling it.
   He praised the Sandinista armed forces, which his brother heads,
and the Sandinista police for avoiding confrontation.
   The Superior Council of Private Enterprise, the major business
group here, said the strike amounted to blackmail and accused the
government of caving in under pressure. Council President Gilberto
Cuadra said the accord crippled the government program to return
Nicaragua to a free market economy.
   The strike hit at planting time and involved thousands of
agricultural workers. Cuadra said it will cost Nicaragua from $35
million to $50 million.
   Presidential spokesman Danilo Lacayo defended the settlement on
state radio. He said it prevented more bloodshed and assured
stability.
   Employees at the Industry and Commerce Ministry jumped up and
down and hugged each other in celebration when the end of the
strike was announced.
   The strike began July 2 and grew into the biggest challenge to
Mrs. Chamorro since the Sandinistas were voted out of office 10
weeks ago after nine years in power. The Sandinistas had said since
losing elections to her United National Opposition coalition that
they would ``rule from below.''
   Unions claimed 90,000 government and state industry employees
joined the walkout. It was the second time the Sandinistas brought
public services to a halt to force pay raises and modifications in
Mrs. Chamorro's plans to cut public spending, sell off state-owned
enterprises and turn into a capitalist economy the
socialist-oriented economy built by the Sandinistas.
   Traffic stareted returning to normal Thursday, but cars and
trucks had to creep around potholes, dislodged paving stones and
rubble left behind from the barricades and fires that filled the
streets during three days of disturbances.
   The unions called off street disruptions Wednesday to persuade
the government to negotiate, but intense gunfire could be heard in
the city through the night. No casualties were reported.
   Army and city cleanup crews used heavy equipment to shovel away
remaining barricades. Others fit paving stones back into place.
   The government had declared the strike ``illegal, illegitimate
and non-existent'' and threatened to fire those who took part. Most
government employees received their positions during Sandinista
rule.
   The agreement with the pro-Sandinista National Workers' Front
grants a 43 percent raise this month and another increase in
August. The amount of the second raise is to be later determined.
   The agreement specifies that 800 employees fired after April 26
will receive compensation, state jobs will be reclassified in
September and a new minimum wage law will be established.
   The strikers forced the conservative government to back down on
a key part of its plan to return Nicaragua, debilitated by the
Reagan administration's economic embargo, to a free-market economy:
the return of lands confiscated in the 1979 revolution.
   Workers and students are to once again ride public
transportation for free, a privilege granted by the Sandinistas and
recently suspended by the new government to save money.
   The government agreed to create a commission of government and
National Workers' Front representatives to discuss government
investment in state-owned texile, metalworking and construction
companies. The talks are to begin Monday.
   Creation of the commission appeared to be a response to the
Front's demand for a role in making economic policy.

   Four performance artists denied grants by the
National Endowment for the Arts plan to appeal.
   ``I refuse to accept the overturning of my grant and those of
the three other artists,'' Holly Hughes said Wednesday at a news
conference called by the National Campaign for Freedom of
Expression.
   The NEA vetoed funds June 29 for Hughes and fellow artists Karen
Finley, Tim Miller and John Fleck, despite a recommendation by an
endownment peer panel that they be given money. Grants totaling
$104,000 were awarded to 14 other artists.
   The endowment has come under attack from right-wing critics and
some religious groups who contend public money should not be given
to art that might be considered obscene. The work of all four
artists, three of whom are openly homosexual, contains explicit
sexual references and, in some cases, nudity.
   ``Our work is not, as the religious right charges,
pornographic,'' Hughes said. ``If any of these artists were doing
pornographic work, we wouldn't bother applying to the NEA. We would
be making plenty of money already.''
   The process of appealing the NEA decision has not yet been
worked out, but the idea has received strong support from the Solo
Performance Fellowship Panel which initially recommended that the
grants be given to the four artists.
   ``We believe that each of these individual artists, based on the
criteria that was before us, is deserving of the fellowship as
recommended,'' said Philip Arnoult, panel chairman and director of
the Theater Project in Baltimore.
   In an emotional statement, Finley said: ``I am being punished
because I am a morally concerned artist. ... This is a sad
regressive time in our national history. As the wall in Eastern
Europe is coming down, it seems that a new wall in our own country
is going up.''
   But she cautioned against abolishing the NEA and relying solely
on private business to underwrite the arts.
   ``Corporations use the NEA as a guideline in knowing who to give
money to, by knowing who has gone through the distinguished process
of the endowment's granting procedures,'' she said. ``Most private
funds and foundations do the same.''
   Richard Elovich, a performance artist whose grant was approved
this year by the endowment, called on artists and organizations
given government funds to use a part of that money ``to support
artists and arts organizations blacklisted by the NEA.''
   In Denver Wednesday, a group of artists attending the
Composer-to-Composer International Telluride Institute conference,
including Pulitzer Prize winner Roger Reynolds, denounced the NEA's
rejection of the four, saying it was part of a disturbing trend
toward censorship.
   ``We really believe these artists have a right to express
themselves,'' said Laurie Anderson, a performance artist. ``These
artists, in my opinion, were sacrificed to the so-called greater
good.''
   The National Campaign for Freedom of Expression, based in
Washington, was created earlier this year by arts activists. It has
called for the five-year reauthorization of the National Endownment
for the Arts without restrictions or restructuring.

   Episodes of the ABC hits ``thirtysomething''
and ``The Wonder Years,'' a segment of the CBS miniseries ``Common
Ground'' and an ABC ``Afterschool Special'' each won a 1990
Humanitas Prize Wednesday.
   The animated CBS series ``Dink, the Little Dinosaur'' and a
syndicated show on teaching morality to children also were honored
for enriching television audiences during a luncheon in Century
City.
   The awards were presented by the Human Family Educational and
Cultural Institute. A total of $70,000 in prize money went to
writers of network programs that ``most fully communicate those
values which enrich the viewing public,'' according to the
institute.
   Todd W. Langen, who wrote the ``Square Dance'' episode of ``The
Wonder Years,'' in which the character Kevin snubs his assigned
dance partner, won an award in the category for 30-minute
prime-time programs.
   The episode was cited for ``its witty affirmation of each
person's right to be uniquely different; for its poignant depiction
of the ravages of peer pressure,'' the institute's statement said.
   Joseph Dougherty won in the 60-minute category for ``The Other
Shoe'' episode of ``thirtysomething,'' which involved the character
Nancy having ovarian cancer.
   The show was honored ``for its chilling dramatization of the
specter of death, and of the moral stamina needed to face it down.''
   The second part of the miniseries ``Common Ground'' earned
Edward Hume a Humanitas Prize in the 90-minute-or-more category.
   The show, dealing with the mandated desegregation of Boston
schools in the 1970s, celebrated the courage to abandon stereotypes
and respond to hatred with non-violence, the institute said.
   An ABC ``Afterschool Special'' by Bruce Harmon, ``A Town's
Revenge,'' dealt with ``the courage it takes to be ecologically
sensitive,'' and to be faithful to one's values even at the risk of
alienation from loved ones, the statement said. It won in the
children's live action category.
   The prize in the children's animated category went to Cliff Ruby
and Elana Lesser, whose ``Badge of Courage'' episode of ``Dink, the
Little Dinosaur'' was commended for depicting the fulfillment of
committing an unselfish act. In the episode, Dink overcomes fear to
help others threatened by an erupting volcano.
   A documentary award went to Carol L. Fleisher for ``See Dick and
Jane Lie, Cheat and Steal: Teaching Morality to Kids.'' The show
was part of the syndicated series ``Raising Good Kids in Bad
Times.''

   Western leaders managed a breakthrough in a
long-troublesome trade dispute but still left it to their aides to
do the hard bargaining needed to craft a final plan for revamping
global commerce.
   ``I'm not under any illusions that we'll be dealing with a new
era by Christmas _ or even by next spring,'' Canadian Prime
Minister Brian Mulroney said at Wednesday's close of a three-day
economic summit.
   President Bush joined Mulroney and other leaders of the seven
richest democracies in pledging to make sharp cuts in government
support for farmers, a contentious issue in the current Uruguay
Round of world trade talks.
   ``What we're trying to do is move the whole thing forward
without saying that we have to have, tomorrow, totally unprotected
trade,'' Bush told a news conference.
   The leaders of Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Canada,
Italy and the United States took part in the summit. A
representative of the 12-nation European Community also attended.

   President Violeta Barrios de
Chamorro's government has opened talks with Sandinista leaders of a
general strike that hurled the nation into a chaos of street
skirmishes between armed partisans.
   Something of a truce emerged Wednesday night after six days of
unrest that brought the capital to a virtual standstill and posed
the most serious challenge yet to Mrs. Chamorro's 10-week-old
administration.
   The president had called off negotiations over the weekend, but
softened her position in response to an offer from the strikers on
Wednesday.
   She also won a promise from army chief Gen. Humberto Ortega that
troops would quiet Managua today.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has scored another
triumph at a watershed Communist Party Congress, persuading
delegates to elect his protege as the party's second-in-command.
   This morning, on the final day of the 10-day congress, members
considered nominations for a new Central Committee.
   Former Ukraine party chief Vladimir A. Ivashko defeated leading
hard-liner Yegor K. Ligachev in an election Wednesday for the newly
created post of deputy general secretary.
   The official Tass news agency said Ivashko was approved by a
vote of 3,109-to-1,309. Ligachev was handed a stinging loss, with
delegates voting 776-to-3,642 against him.

   Corrupt executives who pillaged the savings
and loan industry would face an expanded army of investigators and
longer prison terms under major crime legislation approved by the
Senate.
   ``We need to be cracking down on the orgy of fraud and
lawbreaking that occurred in the savings and loan crisis,'' Sen.
Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said Wednesday as the crime bill was approved
94-6 and sent to the House.
   The savings and loan provisions came as a last-minute addition
to the crime package, which also would place curbs on nine kinds of
semiautomatic assault weapons and make 34 federal offenses
punishable by death.
   Senate approval of more money, new weapons and fresh troops to
aid prosecutors put pressure on the Bush administration to clean up
the scandal.

   Undercover police guided by the stars staked out
various points in the city in their quest for the Zodiac killer,
whose 21-day pattern of shootings led investigators to suspect he
would strike again today.
   Police consulted astrological charts, occult books, FBI
psychological profiles and letters scrawled by the gunman in
selecting their positions.
   The gunman has vowed in his letters to shoot 12 people, one for
each sign of the zodiac. He has struck four times in four months.
One victim died.
   Police, including a task force of 50, refused to divulge the
locations staked out. To match Zodiac's pattern of preying on easy
targets, they dressed as homeless or elderly people or others who
are vulnerable.

<HEAD>Was This Trip Necessary? `Great Journeys' on PBS Suggests It's Not</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Travel is hell.
   An airport traffic jam delivers you to an endless line with
luggage to lug to your narrow airplane seat for a meal of cute, toy
food, a pressurized atmosphere and a bouncy landing. Worse, to come
back you reverse the procedure. International travel can be
unshirted hell, exposing the unwary traveler to bad food, bad
service and bad company in a foreign language AND an eccentric
currency: Um, how many shinplasters for that there fried zobrovny,
pardner?
   ``Great Journeys,'' an eight-part series bowing Saturday night
on PBS, is another powerful incentive to stay home. It reminds you
just how miserable travel can be. Or how much fun, if you're a
masochist.
   ``I love to travel,'' you say.
   And then you tell the whole story of your 13-hour layover at
Krazed Dictator International on the equator, where sullen customs
men teased sunburned, sweaty Germans in counterfeit Chanel T-shirts
and you saw babies get sucked dry by malarial mosquitoes the size
of dinner plates.
   ``Great Journeys'' promises more of that kind of fun. Its first
episode, ``The Silk Road'' takes you through Western China and some
of the most desolate landscape ever seen outside a kitty box.
   The publicity for ``Great Journeys'' says it will travel the
world's great trade routes with writers who ``make making personal
`journeys of passion' along routes that hold personal significance
for each of them.'' Hmm.
   The opening episode takes Colin Thubron, a well-regarded British
novelist and travel writer, along the silk traders caravan route
from the Great Wall of China to, well, China. He almost gets to
Afghanistan.
   The lust for silk, he explains, nearly bankrupted the Roman
Empire when travelers brought the fine fabric back from the Orient.
The overland route flourished but has been in decline for, oh, 600
years or so.
   For Thubron, who chronicled a 10,000-mile road trip in his 1987
book ``Where Nights are Longest: Travels by Car through Western
Russia,'' it must seem like a pleasant outing. It exhausts even an
armchair traveler.
   Along the way, we see the waning influence of Chinese culture.
It is gradually supplanted by the Moslem people known as the
Turcomen _ farmers and traders whose culture is distinctly Middle
Eastern and non-Chinese.
   They're a handsome, courteous people and they treat Thubron with
great restraint, especially when he asks dumb questions: Q: Would
you like to live in the city? A: Certainly! Why not?
   It turns out this journey has personal significance for Thubron
because he always wanted to do it. Judging from the landscape and
his fellow travelers, he is alone in that regard. Nobody but
Thubron is out there for recreation.
   Remember, we're talking ``trade'' route, not ``scenic'' or
``fun'' route. The terrain is flat and monotonous or hummocked and
monotonous or mountainous and ugly. A road runs through it. He
travels mostly by bus. He loves it.
   The silk traders skirted the great deserts. Not Thubron. He
hires a couple of spitting, toe-stomping camels and takes a daytrip
onto the sand. He loves it. Heck, he even loves the camels, who
care for nothing but other camels.
   He characterizes his journey as a solitary one. This was
probably a comfort to the invisible cameraman and sound operator
who filmed his departing bus or arriving truck or his camel caravan
endlessly rolling across the horizon.
   Mostly, though, Thubron meditates on what it feels like to be in
the last place God made.
   Other episodes of ``Great Journeys'' are much more promising
than ``The Silk Road.'' The Burma Road, ``The Salt Road'' of the
Sahara, The Pan American Highway and the Ho Chi Minh Trail will be
featured in coming weeks.
   And you don't have to leave home to see them.

   SHE SINGS, SHE DANCES, SHE'S ... EMMA WHO?: She's Emma Thompson,
a funny, talented British actress known mostly for her work on
``Fortunes of War'' last season on ``Masterpiece Theater.''
   She returns to the PBS on Sunday night with ``Thompson,'' a
series of six comic half-hours she wrote for the BBC. The sketches
are funny, wicked, fast-paced and wildly uneven, but the great ones
are well worth waiting for.
   ``Self Defense in the Kitchen'' opens with various martial-arts
techniques available to a woman with a cookstove, wok and saucepan
lids; there's a monologue on a dinner party for guests who turn out
to be vegetarians who only eat uncooked food. There's a howlingly
funny scene about flatulence.
   Her mystery guest star in a song-and-dance number turns out to
be her husband, Kenneth Branagh, the star and director of last
year's ``Henry V,'' but the evening is all Thompson's and well
worth your time.

<HEAD>Why The Stock Market Isn't Doing What It `Should' Be Doing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If the usual measurements indicate stocks are
priced rather high, and the profit outlook is uninspiring, and the
economy seems to be going nowhere fast, shouldn't the market
averages fall?
   If you think so, you have lots of company among professional
analysts, some of whom have been saying for a year that the
market's price-to-equity and price-to-earnings and
price-to-prospects ratios are too high.
   But the market never does what it ``should'' do. The very word
has no meaning whatsoever in regard to stock prices except to offer
alibis to those who have been wrong or who wish to parade their
academic knowledge.
   That said, why should the market ride higher on a weaker
substructure than it has in the past? Or, why shouldn't the popular
blue-chip averages revert to their proper behavior?
   Here are a few possibilities, gleaned from analyst comments:
   _The institutionalization of the marketplace. Pension funds
continue to grow. Their investment commitments are dictated not
only by their analyses of stocks but by the need to put the money
to use.
   In a sense, they must invest. Because of the large size of their
transactions, they must buy stocks in companies that also are large
and have enough shares outstanding to accommodate large-scale
buying and selling.
   When the market was made up of small traders, there was more
variability in their choices. But individual investors continue to
leave the market. In the first quarter, they reduced equity
holdings at an annual rate of $91 billion.
   _The popular averages reflect prices of the biggest stocks and
the activities of the biggest investors. Not all stocks are doing
as well as the blue chips. Smaller stocks have been laggards for
several years.
   _More big buyers are indexing their portfolios. That is, they
seek to at least match the popular indexes _ most of which are
blue-chip indicators _ and they do so by buying the very stocks
that make up the indexes.
   _The supply of equities is shrinking, but the number of equity
seekers may not be shrinking. There are fewer stocks to buy today
than there were last year or five years ago or seven years ago.
   Since 1983, according to Wright Investors' Service, which
closely monitors the equities population, more than $500 billion of
U.S. equities have been removed from the stock market.
   The shrinkage continued in the first quarter of 1990, according
to Wright, which estimates that the value of equities retired
exceeded the value of new issues by an annual rate of $63 billion.
   In the 1980s, most of the shrinkage resulted from corporate
takeovers, many of which substituted debt for equity. More
recently, the decline seems to be resulting more from corporations
buying back their own shares.
   In late 1989 and early this year, for example, General Electric,
IBM and Westinghouse announced major stock repurchase programs that
will total about $16 billion over the next several years.
   What ``should'' the market be doing? Nothing but what it is
doing.

<HEAD>Candidates Debating Peace Dividend That May Be Just a Mirage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congressional candidate Rosa DeLauro wants to
use a big chunk of the peace dividend to help defense workers and
industries adapt to the end of the Cold War.
   It's a win-win proposal in her Connecticut district, which is
dominated by three major military contractors already feeling the
effects of friendlier relations around the world.
   There's only one catch: There might not be a peace dividend.
   The Cold War thaw is expected to produce military spending cuts
adding up to tens of billions of dollars over the next few years.
   But even as candidates tout their big plans for that money, some
politicians and analysts maintain the peace dividend is only a
mirage.
   The savings and loan bailout will eat it up, Rep. Dan
Rostenkowski of Illinois told the nation's mayors last month.
   Efforts to cut the federal deficit will swallow it, others say.
   ``Any politician in an election year is going to grab for any
available resource and spend it on the trail because they don't
have anything else to spend,'' said Democratic analyst Bob Beckel.
   ``But the pressure to take peace dividend money and use it for
anything but deficit reduction is just too strong right now. And
this is coming from a liberal,'' he added with a laugh.
   The same argument is coming from Republicans and fiscally
conservative Democrats like Rostenkowski. Many of them contend that
any peace dividend is too far down the road to mean much to voters
anyway.
   ``People can't relate to the argument,'' said Linda DiVall, a
GOP polling consultant. ``There is no $150 million surplus there on
the table. If it existed, Republicans and Democrats would not be
sitting down to talk about deficit reduction. The peace dividend
was peace.''
   Such talk aside, the peace dividend continues to crop up on
campaign trails in places like Connecticut, Iowa, Colorado and
Nebraska.
   Josie Heath, a Democratic Senate candidate in Colorado, visited
with coal miners coming off the morning shift one day last week.
``I was telling them I'd like to cut the defense budget by 50
percent and they were shaking their heads and saying it's about
time,'' Heath said.
   She and DeLauro, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for an
open House seat, are suggesting similar peace dividend plans that
would divide military savings between deficit reduction and
domestic needs such as education, health care, housing subsidies,
pollution cleanup, road and bridge repair, and aid to
defense-dependent states and communities.
   Neither candidate believes peace dividend savings automatically
must go to the S&amp;L bailout.
   ``I don't think we need to accept Rostenkowski's dictum on
that,'' said DeLauro. ``We have to decide what it is we want to do,
what are the priorities we want to focus on.''
   The DeLauro and Heath plans are similar to proposals being
offered by more than a few Democrats eager to highlight their
party's reputation for caring about domestic concerns.
   Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster, said it is a useful
political exercise even if there's no pot of gold at the end of the
rainbow.
   ``The peace dividend is just becoming a metaphor for talking
about priorities in spending,'' she said. ``It's one of the few
areas where Democrats still have an advantage.''
   Several influential Democrats, including House Majority Leader
Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., believe the party can build on its
strengths by becoming identified as the champion of displaced
defense workers.
   This ``economic conversion'' theme, evolving in legislation and
campaign pitches like those of Heath and DeLauro, involves a range
of proposals to retool factories, redirect research and retrain
workers while cushioning economic shocks.
   The policy holds obious appeal for defense-dependent regions of
New England, Virginia, California, Texas, Colorado and New York.
And Democrats believe their candidates stand to benefit most.
   ``People believe Democrats would cut the military more than
Republicans, but they also know it's darn hard to change a
50-year-old tank welder into a toxic waste specialist,'' said Lake.
``They believe it takes resources. And if you're looking for
resources, you're looking for Democrats.''
   But Beckel cautions there are potential pitfalls to the
strategy, as well.
   ``There's an advantage. You force the debate,'' he said. ``But I
worry about raising expectations and then not being able to deliver
on them.''

<HEAD>Does Ingersoll Want or Have to Go to Europe?</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   With the U.S. newspaper empire he built on junk
bonds and panache crumbling, it's not surprising that Ralph M.
Ingersoll II has retreated to Europe to pick up the pieces.
   Ingersoll, whose network of newspaper holdings grew fast the
past five years and shrank even faster earlier this month, always
considered himself an odd duck among American newspaper publishers.
   He's been described as worldly, soft-spoken, debonair,
continental and global. Some acquaintances just call the
44-year-old entrepreneur a European kind of guy.
   He speaks several languages, went to school in Switzerland,
wears English suits, married a German, drives a German car and when
he dashes off a note, he dates it the European way _ 2 July 1990.
   That date, July 2, was a turning point in the rise and fall of
the media company started by Ingersoll's father, Ralph senior, a
respected editor who got into publishing in the late 1950s.
   Ingersoll announced a trans-Atlantic swap with investment
partner E.M. Warburg Pincus &amp; Co. He gave up all his American
newspapers and became sole owner of his European newspaper group.
Ingersoll had controlled 10 American dailies and dozens of weeklies.
   The swap also left Ingersoll with a much smaller, less-indebted
business that includes a morning, afternoon and Sunday newspaper in
Dublin, Ireland, and three dailies and 39 weeklies in England.
   Ingersoll said he's happy with the deal.
   ``I think it was natural and basically inevitable,'' Ingersoll
said in a telephone interview from the south of France where he was
visiting friends. ``We had a philosophical difference. I saw great
opportunity in Europe. They weren't really interested.''
   He said the key to the deal for him is that he's severing his
ties with Warburg Pincus, his investment partner since 1983.
   Under his original agreement with that firm, Ingersoll was
obligated to share 50 percent of the profits of any acquisition or
deal he made. After several years, he realized he had made a
mistake, especially when he learned that Warburg Pincus wasn't
particularly enthusiastic about European expansion.
   ``I was faced with an opportunity to get out from under that
agreement and I took advantage of it,'' Ingersoll said. ``Now I'm
free to negotiate with individual investor groups for each
individual deal. That's the way my father and I did it for 25 years
and that's the way I'm going to do it now.''
   Nonetheless, a basic question still emerges: How much choice did
he have in what's happened to him?
   ``What's happening, I think, was basically forced upon him,''
said John Morton, a media industry analyst for Lynch Jones &amp; Ryan
in New York. ``But I guess with his affinity for Europe, it might
make it easier to swallow.''
   Others say Ingersoll welcomes the chance to escape the recession
that has hurt the American newspaper industry. Ingersoll said he
talked with his partners about the trans-Atlantic swap last year
and has been watching the European market for eight years.
   ``Ralph always said there were greater opportunities in Europe.
He always expressed a strong interest over there. I think this move
is consistent with his thinking,'' said Tom Tallarico, ex-publisher
of Ingersoll's ex-newspaper, the St. Louis Sun.
   The Sun, launched last September, was supposed to be a
revolutionary tabloid designed to show that growth was possible in
a stagnant industry.
   After seven months, the newspaper folded with a loss of at least
$25 million. Ingersoll, who used some of his own money to start the
paper, said he stopped publishing because of inadequate street
sales.
   Analysts said he was forced to pull the plug because of his
weighty obligations in junk bonds, the high-yield, high-risk debt
securities that became a primary financing tool for many companies
in the 1980s.
   By some reckonings, Ingersoll's U.S. newspaper network amassed
debts exceeding $700 million, much of it raised by Michael Milken,
the junk-bond financier of the now-defunct Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc. investment company.
   A month before the Sun's demise, Ingersoll offered to repurchase
$240 million worth of junk bonds at deep discounts to avoid
defaulting on upcoming interest payments. He got a poor response.
   ``Everyone in the industry said the St. Louis Sun was ill-fated
from the start,'' said Kenneth Berents, a stock analyst with Alex
Brown &amp; Co. in Baltimore. ``And it's interesting that had he not
gone out on a limb for the Sun, he might not be having the problems
he's having today. The Sun may have cost him his whole empire.''
   Ingersoll said the junk bond troubles had nothing to do with his
decision to make the trans-Atlantic swap, and he's not sure where
the startup of the Sun fits into the picture.
   ``It didn't figure in it directly, but I suppose it may have had
some type of metaphysical impact on what Warburg Pincus was
thinking, but it's hard to say,'' Ingersoll said.
   It's difficult to say much about the internal finances of
Ingersoll's companies because they are privately owned. Even
bondholders have a hard time obtaining information about them.
   But it's clear that things haven't been easy for Ingersoll since
the Sun stopped publishing April 25.
   ``I think the failure of the Sun affected him more than anyone
thought. It disenchanted him with American newspapers,'' said Kevin
Horrigan, the Sun's lead columnist, who was lured away from the St.
Louis Post-Dispatch. ``Ralph felt he had something to contribute
and was basically told, `No thanks.' ''
   So, Horrigan said, he's not surprised to see Ingersoll going to
Europe. Actually, many acquaintances say they're not surprised to
see Ingersoll going to Europe because he's more attuned to that
culture.
   When newspaper analysts and other experts said that starting a
new metropolitan newspaper couldn't de done, Ingersoll rattled off
the names of several recent successful startups _ in Europe and
elsewhere.
   At one point, while his Sun was struggling with sagging
circulation and an identity problem in St. Louis, Ingersoll was in
England having dinner with Prince Charles.
   Ingersoll hinted he hasn't given up on U.S. newspapers
completely. The financial problems in the industry probably will
create opportunities for newspaper entrepreneurs with a global view
to pick up some bargains, he said.
   ``Maybe in a perfect world, one would operate on every
continent,'' Ingersoll said.
   For now, Ingersoll's world is less than perfect.

<HEAD>Ford Escort: Best Seller of the '80s Is Growing</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto, Graphic</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ANN M. JOB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>For The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   America's favorite car of the 1980s isn't resting on its
laurels. For the 1991 model year, the Ford Escort is growing,
adding more hiproom and shoulder room in the rear, more glass area
up front and a new engine.
   It's also becoming more aerodynamic and improving its fuel
efficiency.
   Nearly a decade ago Americans came to know and love the
mild-mannered Escort, the vehicle that Ford called its ``world
car'' because it would be sold in many countries.
   As the 1980s unfolded, the Escort subcompact was repeatedly at
the top of the pack of favorite U.S. nameplates. By the end of the
decade, more than 3.46 million Escorts had been sold in this
country, far outdistancing the No. 2 nameplate, the Honda Accord.
   But Ford Motor Co. knew the old Escort needed upgrading. Annual
sales peaked at around 524,500 in 1985, and the No. 2 U.S.
automaker wanted to attract buyers of import cars to the Escort.
   ``The car was very good, but it was almost a decade old,'' said
Mike Sullivan, Ford Division marketing plans manager for the Escort.
   ``It was not quite as modern as the (Honda) Civic and (Toyota)
Corolla. The new Escort is virtually all new, very modern. It's not
second fiddle to any car.''
   Indeed, the 1991 Ford Escort LX 4-door hatchback test car was
admirable in furnishing a back seat that can really be used for
more than stowing briefcases and shopping bags. Though three
good-sized adults might find it confining, two adults would be in
decent shape. Sullivan noted that Ford added 2.5 inches of hiproom
and more than 1 inch of shoulder room to the 2-door Escort.
   I had a couple inches of clearance above my head to the roofline
while sitting on the nicely cushioned, cloth back seat, and my legs
were even extended a bit with the front seat back a bit.
   With the front seats back all the way, I tucked my feet under
the front seats and my knees still weren't crushed into the back of
the front seatbacks.
   In the 4-door test car, the rear seatback is divided and either
side can fold down to allow room for long items in the hatchback.
   The Escort LX rode solidly for a little car. I didn't feel
particularly vulnerable to road bumps. The powertrain has its own
subframe to help reduce vibration and noise, and new independent
front and rear strut suspension kept the ride from being punishing.
   I could hear some road noise and the 1.9-liter, sequential,
electronic fuel-injected four-cylinder engine _ teamed with the
optional four-speed automatic transmission _ jerked a bit a few
times. I also noticed when the air conditioner running at full
blast tapped into the engine's power.
   Still, the engine can deliver up to 88 horsepower while
propelling an Escort that's heavier than its predecessor _ all
without losing fuel economy. A smoother exterior design helps, too,
bringing the Escort's drag coefficient _ which indicates the ease
with which the car moves through the air _ down from 0.39 to 0.35.
   Of course, I wasn't expecting a race car from the Escort LX.
Overall, there was just no getting around the fact that the Escort
LX was simple, decent transportation packaged in a body that was
plainly pleasing, inside and out. I admired the way the car
squeezed into awkward parking spots, how easy it was to read the
large analog gauges, how comfortable it was to get used to this
vehicle.
   The average price of a 1991 Escort is up about 2.5 percent from
its comparably equipped predecessor. But base prices ranging from
$7,565 for a 2-door hatchback to $11,063 for an Escort GT sport
model remain within reach of many potential buyers.
   Ford expects Escort purchasers to have a median age of 34, with
median household income of $30,000 a year. About 45 percent will be
men and at least a third of buyers will be college graduates,
Sullivan said.
   He added that many features _ such as better computerized engine
control and tinted glass _ are now part of the standard Escort
vehicle.
   Comparisons with competitors, such as the Civic, which starts at
more than $6,600 for a 2-door hatchback with manual transmission,
and Corolla, which starts at more than $8,700, are, therefore,
difficult, Sullivan said.
   Consumer Reports magazine ranked 1987 and 1988 Escorts worse
than average in owner reports of trouble. But Ford said the 1991
Escort ``will usher in a new era at Ford in terms of quality,
manufacturing and design.''
   The company looks to sell 400,000 Escorts a year.

<HEAD>Global Population Growth, Improved Economies Could Help U.S.
Farmers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   World population growth and the potential
upgrading of Third World economies are cited by some economists
when they predict a rosy future for American farmers.
   More people, particularly more people with money, means greater
demands on world food production, goes the argument. And the United
States, as the premier granary, stands to gain with rising exports.
   It's an iffy forecast. Global politics and the possibility of
massive crop failures inhibit long-range predictions.
   Population growth is a certainty, but don't bet the old home
place just yet that Third World countries will hoist themselves out
of economic swamps and suddenly buy everything U.S. farmers produce.
   Nearly one-fourth of the world's people live in absolute
poverty, says Alan B. Durning of the Worldwatch Institute. And
poverty is much more than an economic condition.
   ``Poverty's horror extends to all aspects of a person's life:
susceptibility to disease, limited access to most types of services
and information, lack of control over resources, subordination to
higher social and economic classes, and utter insecurity in the
face of changing circumstances,'' Durning said.
   Poverty's psychological toll is the erosion of human dignity and
self respect, he said.
   The figures describing the extent of world poverty are
mind-warping. Durning, writing in Worldwatch's annual State of the
World report for 1990, estimated that nearly 1.23 billion people _
more than 23 percent of the global population _ lived in poverty in
1989.
   According to Worldwatch estimates, the global network of
absolute poverty included: Asia, 675 million people, 25 percent of
the region's population; sub-Saharan Africa, 325 million, 62
percent; Latin America, 150 million, 35 percent; North Africa and
Middle East, 75 million, 28 percent.
   The Agriculture Department recently issued a report on world
population, including revisions since 1950 and projections to the
year 2050.
   Authors Francis Urban and Michael Trueblood of the department's
Economic Research Service noted that the world population passed 5
billion in 1987 and as of the writing in 1990 stood at 5.3 billion.
It is likely to pass the 10 billion mark in 2041.
   But the report said there now appears to be a ``slowing down of
the world population growth, even though the number of people added
annually seems large.''
   Global population growth peaked in the mid-1960s at an all-time
high of 2.2 percent a year before declining gradually to the
current rate of 1.7 percent.
   ``By the year 2050, the annual rate of population growth is
estimated to drop to about 0.6 percent, indicating that the world
population may stabilize at about 10.5 billion people toward the
year 2100,'' the report said.
   However, while the growth rate has been declining in most
countries and regions, ``it is just reaching its estimated peak in
Africa and the Middle East of 3.2 percent and 3.4 percent,
respectively,'' the report said.
   By the year 2050, the rate of population growth in these two
regions probably will still be twice as high as the other regions
of the world.
   Agricultural economists are more comfortable projecting a year
or two ahead. But when hard-put they sometimes take a longer view.
Right now, the year 2000 is a favorite target for speculation.
   Dennis Avery and Glenn H. Sullivan, of the Hudson Institute
Center for Global Food Issues in Indianapolis, say world food
demand will rise in the 1990s as higher incomes enable many
countries to upgrade diets.
   But Avery and Sullivan said in a recent report that American
farmers may be left out of this growing overseas market unless
there is reform of international trading rules and U.S. farm
policies.
   Negotiations aimed at reforming world trade are being conducted
under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and Congress is
trying to hammer out a new farm bill affecting domestic programs.
   At last week's economic summit in Houston, leaders of the seven
richest nations issued a final communique that finessed the thorny
issue of eliminating agricultural subsidies, as President Bush
wants. The communique urges all nations to make ``substantial,
progressive reductions'' in subsidies with an eventual goal of
eliminating them.
   The Avery-Sullivan report said an 18 percent increase in world
food production will be required in the 1990s to take care of the
expected population growth.
   ``In addition, hundreds of millions of people in the world are
getting higher incomes and want to upgrade their diets,'' the
report said.
   ``There are probably more than 200 million `middle-class' food
customers in India alone today, and India's economic growth has
recently been about three times as rapid (5 percent to 6 percent)
as her projected population growth (1.8 percent).''
   Overall, the report said, low- and middle-income countries have
been expanding their economies by 4 percent a year, more than
double the rate of global population growth.
   ``We expect economic growth in the 1990s to be still more rapid
than in the debt- and inflation-ridden 1980s,'' the report said.
``The GATT continues to offer developing countries good
opportunities for export-led growth.''
   Some examples of export-led growth are Algeria, Thailand and
Mexico, which the report said are now trying to emulate the export
success of such countries as Taiwan and South Korea.
   ``More and more of the world is rejecting the overdependence on
governments which slowed economic growth in recent decades,'' the
report said. ``It is happening now in the East Bloc and Nicaragua,
but it has been evident in China for a decade, in much of Latin
America the past several years, and even in large parts of Africa.''

   The dangerous legacy of 45 years of building
atomic bombs is contaminated nuclear graveyards that will cost
billions of dollars to clean up, if indeed scientists can figure
out a way to clean them up. One researcher even says that trying to
get rid of the radioactive wastes would cost more lives than
leaving them alone.

<DATELINE>OAK RIDGE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Miles of 8-foot-high electric fences
stretch through Bethel Valley, the once-secret cradle of the atomic
age. They stand watch over burial grounds of deadly wastes that are
the legacy of four decades of nuclear bomb production.
   Yellow and magenta signs proclaim, ``Radiation Hazard, Keep
Out.''
   The fences encircling some of the hundreds of acres of
contaminated land on the federal Oak Ridge nuclear weapons compound
are reminders that while the Cold War may be over, it took a
serious toll.
   It cost about $250 billion for the roughly 65,000 nuclear
weapons that the United States has manufactured since 1945, when
the first was assembled. That bill is paid. Yet to be settled is
the toll this secretive manufacturing process has taken on weapons
workers and the environment.
   At Oak Ridge alone, the Energy Department has spent $1 billion
since 1983 trying to control the environmental damage. It is
expected to take at least 10 more years just to determine what
poisons have seeped into the soil and ground water here, and 20
more years to stop it from spreading.
   The total bill for cleaning up Oak Ridge may top $12 billion.
   Costs at some of the 16 other active nuclear arms laboratories,
manufacturing plants and proving grounds in 11 other states will be
much higher.
   The full cost of environmental repairs alone may top $100
billion. Estimates vary greatly because the government itself
doesn't know how badly some sites are contaminated. Nor has all the
necessary technology been developed.
   The Energy Department, which makes and tests all nuclear weapons
for the Pentagon, said in a report on July 3 that the magnitude of
the cleanup is expanding so rapidly that it cannot keep up. Its
cost estimate for the next five years is $31.4 billion _ nearly 50
percent more than it expected just one year ago. And this is in the
early days. The full cleanup effort will take at least 30 years.
   ``These amounts challenge and almost certainly exceed'' the
cleanup resources available to the government and its hundreds of
private contractors, the report said.
   In the meantime, Tennessee health authorities ban fishing and
swimming in East Fork Poplar Creek, which winds through the
56,000-acre weapons plant as well as the adjacent city of Oak
Ridge, and in a portion of the Clinch River, which borders the
plant on three sides. The stream is poisoned by mercury, once used
to separate lithium for nuclear weapons.
   Oak Ridge, originally called the Clinton Engineer Works, was the
site of the first nuclear bomb production plants, code-named Y-12,
X-10 and K-25. Today it remains a key link in the production chain,
although some of its operations have been closed permanently.
   Martin Marietta Energy Systems Inc., which runs Oak Ridge under
a government contract, says 75 tons of toxic mercury and
substantial amounts of the radioactive element cesium-137 have
spread from the weapons plant and contaminated the sediment in
Watts Bar Reservoir, which remains open to the public for swimming
and boating.
   ``Not only did the atomic age start here, the problems did,
too,'' says Bill Adams, the Energy Department's chief of waste and
environmental management at Oak Ridge.
   Unfortunately, the problems don't end here.
   The radioactive and toxic contamination is so bad at several
nuclear weapons plants _ in Colorado, Ohio, Tennessee, South
Carolina, California, Missouri and Washington state _ that portions
of these huge sites will become ``national sacrifice zones,''
scientists say, land deemed permanently unfit for human use.
   ``We have one hell of a legacy to clean up,'' says Leo Duffy,
the top adviser to Energy Secretary James D. Watkins on long-term
environmental issues.
   The legacy is not just environmental insults. It's damage to
human health, damage long suspected by workers and plant neighbors
but routinely denied by the government until Watkins two years ago
began tearing down the walls of secrecy.
   On July 11, more than 40 years after the fact, the Energy
Department acknowledged the Hanford plutonium production plant in
south-central Washington state leaked radiation at levels that
endangered the health of nearby residents.
   It was the government's first admission that the Hanford leaks
were at levels sufficient to cause cancer and other illnesses in
people living near the facility.
   The Energy Department is committed to cleaning up the
environmental damage, even if it has made few promises about
addressing the problem of health risks. The question is how to get
the money needed to restore the soil and water.
   Congress and the Bush administration are under pressure to cut
the budget deficit even as defense spending slows in response to
moves toward democracy in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.
   In the emerging national debate over the size of a ``peace
dividend'' from expected military savings _ and how to spend it _
little has been said about the ``mortgage'' the atomic bomb
builders took out to compete in the arms race.
   During the World War II development of the first atomic bombs in
the Army's secret Manhattan Project, any thoughts of environmental
or excessive health risks were subsumed by a feeling that the very
survival of democracy depended on getting the bomb as quickly as
possible.
   Later, through the Cold War period, military authorities used
the shield of strict secrecy _ justified on national security
grounds _ to continue borrowing against the environment and
workers' health to speed up bomb production, according to
interviews with current and former arms plant workers, government
officials, scientists and congressional investigators.
   Now payment is coming due.
   Officials who have surveyed the dozens of existing and former
nuclear weapons sites around the country say hundreds of billions
of dollars are needed not only to control environmental damage, but
also to reduce the health risks of nuclear plant workers and to
make safety improvements long put off.
   Until the mid-1980s the government would not acknowledge these
failures.
   ``Nobody wants to look under the rug, and a lot has been swept
under the rug in the nuclear weapons industry,'' says Elizabeth
Paul of the Snake River Alliance, based in Ketchum, Idaho. The
citizens group opposes the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory,
which recovers highly enriched uranium from naval reactors.
   Even an investment of $100 billion in environmental corrections
won't completely reverse the damage.
   The chief problems are contamination of the soil and ground
water _ on the federal sites and in surrounding areas _ with
radioactive materials such as plutonium, tritium and strontium-90
and such toxics as mercury, arsenic and a variety of solvents.

   Plutonium is so potent that lethal lung doses are measured in
the billionths of a gram.
   The ``burial grounds'' and some other parts of Oak Ridge, as
well as large sections of the Hanford weapons plant near Richland,
Wash., the Savannah River plant near Aiken, S.C., and portions of
other sites from coast to coast won't be fit for human use for
hundreds, perhaps thousands, of years.
   ``There'll be hot spots that will never have any other use
except for disposal of hazardous and radioactive waste,'' says Vic
Rezendes, director of energy issues at the General Accounting
Office, the investigative arm of Congress.
   The cost to human health is harder to assess.
   The government has never acknowledged any human health damage
caused by emissions from its plants or by radiation releases from
atomic bomb tests in the desert Southwest. But increasing numbers
of Americans are going to court seeking compensation on grounds
that chronic exposure to radiation caused illness and death, even
at levels the government considers safe.
   Bruce H. DeBoskey, a Denver lawyer for some workers at the Rocky
Flats plutonium processing plant, says relatives of workers who
died of cancer feel cheated by the federal government.
   ``The widows of these workers who gave their lives to build
these bombs are deeply embittered,'' DeBoskey says. ``There's a
human tragedy here.''
   Also at risk were thousands of uranium miners who dug out the
bomb material in unventilated shafts in New Mexico, Arizona, Utah
and Colorado from the late 1940s to the mid-1960s, when mining
stopped because the government had stockpiled all it needed.
   Of the estimated 15,000 men who worked the mines, about 450 have
died of lung cancer _ five times the number expected in a similar
size group of American men, according to the National Institute of
Occupational Safety and Health.
   Congress is now trying to make some amends. In June the House
passed a bill to establish a $100 million trust to compensate
families of miners with radiation-induced illness, as well as
certain cancer victims in Nevada, Utah and Arizona who were exposed
to fallout from above-ground nuclear testing from 1951 to 1962. The
Senate is expected to approve the bill. President Bush opposes it.
   Scientists have not yet determined conclusively whether
accidental releases of radioactivity from nuclear weapons plants
are a health threat. Nor are they yet sure of the risk posed by
chronic exposure of workers to low levels of radiation.
   Until the mid-1980s these issues were secondary. Production was
king, secrecy its serf.
   ``Things having to do with atomic weapons are born secret,''
says J. Carson Mark, who spent 27 years designing nuclear weapons
at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico and is now retired.
   Clyde Hopkins remembers the mind-set in the early 1950s when he
was a production control worker at the Oak Ridge Y-12 plant, which
used tons of mercury to separate lithium for use as a fuel source
in thermonuclear warheads.
   ``The pressure was intense to come up with weapons components on
a short-term basis,'' he says. ``People back in those days didn't
even think about the environment. They thought about getting the
doggone work out to support the country's nuclear stockpile.
   ``I can remember days when people were walking around with lots
of mercury on the floor. You kept operating because you wanted that
product to come out. So the emphasis then was on production. The
thought that we had mercury leaking on the floor, obviously working
its way down through the concrete into the ground, it wasn't
thought about back then.''
   Hopkins thinks about it a lot now. He is president of Martin
Marietta Energy Systems, which is locked in negotiations with the
Energy Department over its financial and legal liability for
failing to meet state and federal environmental laws.
   Oak Ridge was not alone in its approach to meeting bomb
production schedules.
   Cleve Anderson recalls fighting against a ``production-first''
mentality while he headed a committee studying long-range waste
management at Hanford in the late 1950s. Hanford was the main
producer of plutonium _ the most lethal element known _ for use in
nuclear bombs, although today its nine reactors are shut down.
   ``At Hanford we had been indoctrinated thoroughly that the
nation's survival depended on what we were doing, that nothing was
more important to national security than getting ever more
plutonium. Anything else that might interfere was secondary,'' he
said.
   In a classified report written in December 1958 for General
Electric Co., which was running Hanford under a government
contract, Anderson urged that more money be spent to develop safer
disposal methods for radioactive wastes. He wrote: ``The
probability of the superiority of alternate methods of waste
disposal has long been recognized but the pressing problems of
(weapons production) precluded any but the most cursory
examinations of these alternatives.''
   He said his report was shelved. Years later, he had to file a
request under the Freedom of Information Act to obtain a copy.
   Today Hanford is considered the most extensively contaminated
piece of land in the United States, perhaps in the world.
   The government's own advisers were sounding the alarm on nuclear
waste as early as 1955. In that year the National Academy of
Sciences formed a committee to advise the Atomic Energy Commission
on waste disposal.
   The committee concluded in late 1955 that dumping radioactive
wastes directly into the ground ``probably involves unacceptable
long-term risks'' to the environment. Yet such practices continued
for more three decades.
   Hopkins, the Martin Marietta manager at Oak Ridge, says, ``I'd
be surprised'' if officials there were told prior to the 1980s that
dumping wastes directly into the ground carried the risk of serious
environmental damage.
   ``If they had, I don't think we'd have done it,'' he said.
   Regardless of the reasons, the hazards posed by huge
accumulations of nuclear wastes now represents a technological
challenge for America unlike any it has faced since the dawn of the
atomic age.
   ``We've scratched the surface,'' says Duffy, the Energy
Department waste czar. ``We know the problems, we don't know the
solutions.''
   One of the least understood problems is how much of the nuclear
graveyards can be excavated or treated without putting workers at
unacceptable risk.
   Frank L. Parker, who headed Oak Ridge National Laboratory's
radioactive waste management research in the late 1950s and early
1960s and now teaches environmental engineering at Vanderbilt
University in Nashville, Tenn., says the country will have to
accept that some nuclear wastes are too dangerous to remove.
   ``The number of deaths you're going to incur to clean it up will
dwarf the number who would be killed if you left it alone,'' he
says.

   It's a lean political year for New
England governors, grappling with an economic slump, deficits and
rebellious taxpayers _ woes that could worsen, according to a
Vermont Republican who wants to reclaim the State House and try to
manage them.
   ``I think I can create a sense of orderliness in hard times,''
said Richard A. Snelling, a four-term governor running for a
reprise. While incumbent governors are facing the backlash of those
hard times, Snelling is campaigning with the status and the name
recognition of incumbency, but without the downside of blame for
the slackening economy.
   That confronts Democrat Peter Welch with difficult odds, and he
knows it. ``This is not going to be an uphill campaign,'' he said
in launching his bid, ``it is an up-mountain campaign.''
   Welch, 43, a lawyer and former president of the state Senate,
got into the race after Democratic Gov. Madeleine M. Kunin got out
in April. She had succeeded Snelling when he retired in 1984.
   Now Snelling is running against her record, after an
administration that had to increase taxes, cut and scrape programs
to produce the balanced budget that Gov. Kunin delivered this month.
   ``It creates an easy cruising agenda for the Republican,'' Welch
said the other day at his cramped, cluttered campaign headquarters
across the railroad tracks from the Lake Champlain docks. But Welch
said he has the campaign time and the issues to overcome the
Snelling advantage. He said he's talking with voters about tax
fairness for the middle class, health care, housing, education.
   Snelling counters the new governor won't have much money to
spend. ``It's going to be tough next year,'' he said. ``The next
governor isn't going to get to solve problems with money.''
   He advocates budgeting based on economic cycles, up or down.
Snelling said governments should spend what is necessary, not
what's available, cutting taxes when economic boom times swell
revenues, accepting deficits when the economy slumps.
   ``He's the Babe Ruth of Vermont deficits,'' Welch said. ``He
holds all the records.''
   Snelling is a businessman. He's been managing investments, most
of them his own, since he left the governor's office, with time out
to lose, badly, in a 1986 Senate challenge. At his upstairs offices
at a South Burlington shopping mall, he is addressed as governor.
The photographs on the wall show him in that role with presidents
and party leaders.
   Not long ago, one of his campaign aides called the State House
to ask for some budget information for the governor, and was archly
reminded that the governor's name is Kunin.
   In retirement, he was an ocean sailor. Now he is selling his
46-foot sailboat, saying he knows there will not be time to use it
in the job he expects to win back.
   ``There's a great deal of difference between fun and
satisfaction,'' Snelling said.
   So when supporters began saying he should come out of retirement
at 63, he listened. ``If a lot of people say we need you, that's
very powerful stuff,'' Snelling said.
   He'd expected to run against Gov. Kunin, but she became the
third New England Democrat to decide against seeking re-election as
governor this year. Gov. William A. O'Neill of Connecticut opted
out earlier in the spring. Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts
did so more than a year ago. The slump and its budget impact were
factors in all three states.
   The region's other three governors are Republicans, all seeking
re-election, all handicapped by financial problems.
   In New Hampshire, Gov. Judd Gregg has just told his
administrators there will have to be more spending and personnel
cuts to check a swelling deficit, blaming saying he can't forecast
when the slump will end.
   Three Democrats seek the nomination to challenge Gregg.
   Tax and budget troubles also are plaguing Gov. Edward DiPrete of
Rhode Island, a conservative who had to reverse his pledge against
tax increases this spring, and he's facing a struggle to hold on
for a fourth term.
   Snelling acknowledges he might have political problems of his
own if he'd been in office when the economy faltered _ but he also
said he managed the state government through two recessions without
losing his support. ``I don't think the voters are just guaranteed
to turn on you in hard times,'' he said.
   He said a politician who takes credit for an economic boom is
going to suffer politically for a slowdown. ``If you tout the
Massachusetts miracle and it ends, then you will be forced to take
the blame,'' he said.
   That's what happened to Democrat Dukakis.
   A broader slump could confront President Bush with similar
problems in 1992, after nearly a decade of campaign claims that
Republicans policies are the path to uninterrupted economic growth.
   ``The slowdown in New England is contagious,'' warned New
Hampshire's Gov. Gregg. ``I don't see how the rest of the nation
can not be drawn in.''

<HEAD>Fancy Foods Generally Not Lean Foods, But Some Change Is Afoot</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY MacVEAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Low-fat cheeses, all-fruit jams and low-calorie
crackers are making inroads in the fancy foods industry, and
health-conscious eaters can find satisfaction in the gourmet
section if they look carefully.
   ``All-natural'' was a common rallying cry as purveyers showed
off 20,000 foods at the 36th Annual International Fancy Food and
Confection Show last week. But even if all-natural, which generally
has no legal meaning, most of the samples spread out for potential
customers were more likely to be buttery or chocolatey than
slimming.
   ``People are trying to eat healthy most of the time,'' said
Ronald Tanner, spokesman for the National Association for the
Specialty Food Trade Inc. ``And then when they're splurging,
they're really splurging.''
   Most of the time, people who buy fancier foods try to satisfy
their urges with foods that carry rich flavors but at little cost
to the waistline.
   ``Flavor is the real big selling point. People want to eat
healthy, but they don't want to just eat lettuce,'' Tanner said.
   For the first time, this year's trade show included a seminar on
healthy foods.
   So, there are mustards _ green chili mustard, sage mustard, wine
and champagne mustards, sweet mustards. And wild rice. Organic
baked beans. Oats added to pancake mixes. Organically grown teas.
Goat's milk yogurt. Organic maple syrup. Eleven-calorie cookies.
   But just as in the supermarket, consumers should read labels at
gourmet shops. Organic doesn't mean low-calorie, and
cholesterol-free doesn't mean no fat. A sugar-free product may have
as many calories as one with sugar.
   Le Slim Cow, a butter substitute made with buttermilk, was
promoted as having half the fat of butter or margarine. And just 57
calories, compared with 103 calories per serving of butter.
However, its makers, St. Hubert of Rolling Hills Estates, Calif.,
warn that the high moisture content of Le Slim Cow makes it
unsuitable for frying.
   Elan Foods Inc. has introduced a chocolate-covered frozen yogurt
bar that's available east of the Mississippi and should be
available nationwide in a year or so, said Joanne Biltekoff, who
runs the company with her husband.
   While a bar has 230 calories and 13 grams of fat, a premium ice
cream bar has 350 calories and 22 fat grams.
   Salsas and chile sauces were plentiful at the show _ San Angel,
La Preferida, Montezuma, Corn Mother red and green salsas, one made
with eggplant, one with dried tomatoes, one from Canada.
   Generally, these have little fat, though eating them with
tortilla chips cancels any advantage. Try them with bread or
vegetables instead.
   The Baker brand of breads includes varieties made from
stone-ground grains, but the company's booth also included rich
brownies. And a Vermont company called Food 2000 offered vegetarian
chili. There were organic vegetable pates from Threefold
International Co. Ltd. in carrot, chestnut, mushroom and other
flavors.
   But temptation lurked everywhere.
   Across the aisle from Golightly sugar-free candies was a big pan
of tiramisu, the Italian dessert made with high-fat cheese.
   Walk down another aisle and go from butter cookies to spicy meat
to potato pancakes. Pates seemed to be everywhere. And chocolate.
Chocolate shaped like hair dryers, chocolate with every kind of nut
imaginable, chocolate sauce, chocolate cookies, even
chocolate-covered caramel corn.

<HEAD>Feds Propose Crackdown on Cactus Raiders</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal plan to save a rare cactus that
grows in Utah and Colorado includes a crackdown on professional and
amateur growers who have been digging up the plants for private
collections.
   The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's draft recovery plan for the
Uinta Basin hookless cactus, or Sclerocactus glaucus, notes the
plant is prized by growers for its purplish-red flowers.
   The Colorado population has lost an estimated 200 to 300 plants
to collectors since 1977, but there are no estimates for losses in
Utah, the document said. Its total population is estimated at
20,000 plants.
   The plan calls for increased monitoring by the Fish and Wildlife
Service, the Bureau of Land Management and local law enforcement
officers.
   It also encourages the service to work with cactus
horticulturists to try to provide a source of the plants to satisfy
the horticultural demand.
   The cactus was designated a threatened species in 1979 and is
protected under the federal Endangered Species Act.
   Other threats to the cactus include oil shale development, gold
mining, oil and gas development, sand and gravel quarrying,
building stone collection, off-road vehicles and water development.
The recovery plan contains provisions to reduce the threat from
those sources.

<HEAD>Researcher Trying To Get Crustacean To Keep Soft Shell Longer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A university researcher is trying to
get softshell crayfish to keep that shell longer.
   ``People like to eat these creatures when they're soft because
they can eat the whole animal, not just the tail and claws, and
they don't have to work to take out the meat,'' said Michele
Wheatly, a University of Florida zoologist.
   Most restaurants don't offer them regularly because they can't
be assured of a steady supply.
   As crayfish and other crustaceans grow, they shed their hard
shells to reveal a new soft one underneath. It takes a day or two
for the soft shell to harden.
   Wheatly is studying whether this molting process can be
manipulated to last longer, so that more softshell crustaceans can
be caught. Learning how these creatures absorb calcium to harden
their shells is a key, she said.
   In studies on crayfish in Florida, Wheatly found that calcium
must be absorbed within a certain time after molting begins,
usually three to four days, or a hard skeleton cannot form.
   ``We're trying to figure out what the mechanism is for getting
the calcium into the skeleton and why it's so important that this
happens right away,'' she said. ``If we can stop calcification from
starting, we may be able to prolong the softshell state.''
   That would allow the commercial fishing industry to serve a
growing restaurant market and could encourage the development of
new crustacean fisheries, Wheatly said.
   Wheatly, who received a $250,000 grant from the National Science
Foundation, said the research may have application for people.
   ``By studying the mechanism that moves calcium in and out of the
skeletons of crustaceans, we may be able to learn something about
what happens in human bone,'' she said.

<HEAD>Publisher Plans To Launch Direct-Response TV Network</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The publisher of Working Woman, Sassy and other
magazines plans to launch a new television network this fall that
will feature classic TV show reruns along with direct-response
advertising programs.
   Dale Lang, chairman of the newly created Star Television Network
Inc., said 23 independent UHF stations reaching more than 13.7
million of the nation's 92 million TV households have agreed to
carry the service starting in September.
   Stations that sign affiliation agreements will be given eight
hours of television programs a day, consisting of series such as
``Life of Riley,'' ``The Invaders'' and ``Richard Diamond,'' movies
and game shows, Lang said.
   The programming concept will be marketed as ``TV Heaven'' and
affiliate stations will be encouraged to use that term in their own
promotions.
   In exchange for the programs, the stations must run at least
four hours a day of direct-response programs, also called
``infomercials.'' These are program-length commercials in which a
marketer typically demonstrates a product and invites viewers to
call in to order.
   Lang said Star Television and the producers of the infomercials
would share revenue from sales of the products or services with
affiliate stations.
   In addition, stations would be given the option of using shorter
direct-response advertising ranging from 30 seconds to two minutes
to fill any gaps they may have in their commercial schedules.
   Informercials were once a staple of some cable networks, but
have fallen into disfavor as those networks have grown and found
more traditional revenue sources.
   Media critics have long faulted television stations for carrying
such programming because viewers may not always recognize it as
paid programming created expressly to sell a particular product or
service.
   But Lang said this type of programming can help stations cut
their operating losses and make it economically feasible for
holders of FCC construction permits to proceed with new UHF
stations.
   He said Star eventually will produce original programming for
its network, and anticipates generating product sales of more than
$100 million in its second year in operation.
   A spokeswoman for Lang could not say how much was being invested
in the new network. The network will be transmitted to member
stations via satellite from the MCA-Universal Studios in Orlando,
Fla., Lang said.
   Lang also heads Lang Communications, a New York-based media
company that publishes Working Woman, Working Mother, Sassy and
Success magazines.
   It plans to resume publishing Ms. magazine later this month as
an advertising-free publication. Ms. suspended publication last
December shortly after Lang's company acquired it because of
mounting losses.
   Lang said the stations that have signed up and their markets
are: WOCD, Albany, N.Y.; KHFT, Albuquerque, N.M.; KDMD, Anchorage,
Alaska; WNHT and WPHX, both in Boston; W25AI, Cincinnati; KJLF, El
Paso, Texas; KKAK, Fresno, Calif.; and KBLR, Las Vegas.
   Also, KXLI, Minneapolis; WAYQ and WAYK, Orlando, Fla.; WWLA,
Portland, Me.; KCFV, Portland, Ore.; WYED, Raleigh, N.C.; KXLT,
Rochester, Minn.; KOOG and KZAR, both in Salt Lake City, and KLXV,

<HEAD>Banks Required To Write-Down Brazil, Argentine Loans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal regulators have ordered the nation's
largest banks to write off as a loss large portions of about $14
billion in outstanding loans to economically troubled Brazil and
Argentina.
   The order requires 36 affected banks to write off 20 percent of
about $11 billion in loans to Brazil and to increase write-offs of
$2.9 billion in loans to Argentina to 60 percent from 40 percent.
   The write-off of Brazilian loans is the first required by
federal authorities and comes as the South American nation
undertakes economic reform and is seeking new loans to bolster
industry.
   Brazil and Argentina are far in arrears on debt repayments.
Neither country has negotiated debt forgiveness with the United
States, a step taken by Mexico last year and Venezuela earlier this
year.
   Bank officials speaking on condition of anonymity Wednesday
confirmed the receipt of letters ordering the write-downs in recent
days from the Interagency Country Exposure Review Committee.
   The panel consists of representatives of the Federal Reserve
Board, the Office of the Controller of the Currency and the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp. It normally does not announce its decisions.
   The action could force some of the banks to further boost
reserves to protect against losses from nonperforming loans to
developing nations, money that would be subtracted from profits.
   It a bank has enough money set aside in reserves to cover bad
loans, then the new write-downs should not affect earnings.
   The 20 percent write-off of Argentine debt was the third ordered
by federal authorities.
   Brazil's was considered surprising because the country has
undertaken economic reform under new president Fernando Collor de
Mello and is expected to resume negotiations this year on meeting
some bank debt obligations.
   Citicorp, the nation's largest bank holding company, declined to
comment on the regulatory action. But it said the bank already had
written down 60 percent of its Argentine exposure from a $1 billion
reserve created last year.
   ``Any other such writedowns, voluntary or mandated, would
likewise be charged to the reserve without earnings impact,'' the
statement said.
   ``That's the reason for taking such provisions and reserves,''
Citicorp said. ``The earnings impact occurs when they are taken,
not when a writedown subsequently occurs.''
   Citicorp would be forced to write off $660 million of its $3.3
billion exposure to Brazilian loans under the new mandate,
officials said. It would not have to take further write-downs
against its current $400 million exposure to Argentine loans.
   Brazil has not paid interest on its long-term debt for more than
a year and has a total foreign debt of about $113 billion.
Argentina, which has debt of about $62 billion, last month began
paying $40 million a month in interest, still far short of its
interest obligations.
   The federal committee can order banks to write off loans if a
country fall six months behind in payments unless it is attempting
to make progress on paying its debt. Both Argentina and Brazil have
implemented some economic reforms, but apparently not enough to
persuade regulators not to take action.

<TEXT>
   The former head of the collapsed
retailing concern Hooker Corp. and his wife have declared
bankruptcy, claiming debts of nearly $400 million.
   George and Sheila Herscu lodged debtors petitions in Federal
Court at Melbourne on Monday, which the court accepted.
   Herscu was not in court Wednesday for a hearing involving FAI
Insurance, which has been suing the couple for bankruptcy. The
hearing was adjourned after the bankruptcy declaration was
announced.
   Herscu is believed to be in New York for the birth of his
daughter's child.
   The Hooker Corp. was placed in receivership a year ago with
debts of about $1.6 billion.
   Sydney-based Hooker is being managed by a court-appointed
provisional liquidator in a process similar to what its American
subsidiary is experiencing in the U.S. bankruptcy court.
   The U.S. subsidiary, L.J. Hooker Corp., has disposed of the bulk
of ts retail holdings acquired since 1986, including Bonwit Teller
and other department store chains.
   According to documents filed with the Federal Court, Herscu
claims assets of $150,000, including a Rolls Royce, a Cadillac, a
35 percent interest in a racehorse, paintings, jewelery, and
furniture and effects at his mansion in suburban Melbourne.
   The house, modeled after Tara from the film ``Gone with the
Wind,'' was the subject of an auction last month.
   Mrs. Herscu claims assets of $19,600, including a Daimler car,
paintings and jewelry.

<HEAD>SEC Chief to Congress: Banking, Securities Regulation Must Change</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress needs to overhaul regulation of the
securities and banking industries, according to the head of the
Securities and Exchange Commission, but he isn't ready to recommend
the best way to do it.
   In testimony before a House panel Wednesday, SEC Chairman
Richard C. Breeden also outlined several suggestions for reversing
U.S. financial firms' declining market share over the last decade.
But he cautioned against piecemeal change ``for the mere sake of
change.''
   ``The level of unnecessary costs created by the U.S. regulatory
system could become a significant factor in the international
competitiveness of U.S. firms,'' Breeden told a subcommittee
considering proposals to update a nearly 60-year-old banking law.
   He noted that in 1970 seven of the world's 25 largest banks were
based in the United States, while today just one is U.S.-based with
most of the others are headquartered in Japan.
   Breeden was among several witnesses testifying before the
finance subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.
   Critics of existing regulation have called for repealing the
Glass-Steagall Act, the Depression-era law that keeps most banks
out of the securities business and vice versa.
   Such regulations, critics maintain, make the United States less
able to compete for investment in the ever-shrinking global
marketplace.
   But Breeden warned that deregulation must be a two-way street.
He said if Congress repeals Glass-Steagall it simultaneously should
amend the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 to permit bank ownership
by non-banking companies.
   ``Banks should not be free to acquire securities firms, while
many securities and other major U.S. firms remain, as a practical
matter, unable to acquire banks,'' he said.
   Similar views were expressed by other witnesses, including
Samuel J. Baptista, president of the Financial Services Council, a
Washington-based trade group of 25 banks, securities firms and
other financial service companies.
   ``The issue at hand is not deregulation, not re-regulation and
not broader powers for banks,'' he said. ``The issue before
Congress is comprehensive restructuring of our financial services
industry that will benefit both financial services providers and
consumers.''
   Among his recommendations were opening all financial businesses
to all companies _ financial and commercial _ that meet safety and
soundness tests. Baptista also called for functional regulation,
whereby the banking operations of a financial firm would be
regulated by banking regulators and the securities part by
securities regulators.
   Richard Stuart, former head of the Bank Capital Markets
Association, a trade association of 100 banks, and David Silver,
president of the Investment Company Institute, a trade group
representing mutual funds, also supported functional regulation.
   ``Banks, securities firms and others should be allowed to offer
all financial services,'' Silver said.
   In addition to repealing the 1933 Glass-Steagall Act, Silver
called for amending the Bank Holding Company Act ``so that it no
longer confines the banking business to a restricted group of
players.''
   In his testimony, Breeden critiqued ways of regulating financial
firms after the barriers come down.
   One version, universal banking _ which allows banks to engage
directly in a broad range of financial activities _ was ``fatally
flawed,'' he said.
   Universal banking, which is used in West Germany and elsewhere
in Europe, would expand federal deposit insurance guarantees to
bank ventures in the securities and insurance industries. That
would increase taxpayer risk in the event of a bank's losses, he
said.
   Also no single federal regulator has the capability or expertise
to examine all the different types of financial products that could
be offered under universal banking, Breeden said.

   The Bush administration's move to transfer
authority for stock-index futures from one regulatory agency to
another now faces testimony from supporters of the Securities and
Exchange Commission.
   The administration is pushing legislation that would strip the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission of regulatory authority over
stock-index futures and hand it to the rival SEC.
   The Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee is to
conclude two days of hearings today with backers of the SEC.
   On Wednesday, Sen. Christopher Bond, R-Miss., suggested a
compromise that would allow the CFTC to retain most regulation but
allow the Federal Reserve Board to set margin levels for trading
stock-index futures.
   Margins are the downpayments or collateral paid by investors who
buy securities or futures contracts on credit.
   Bond said the administration does not have enough Senate votes
to pass its measure.
   Stock-index futures, often used in program trading strategies by
large institutional investors such as pension funds, allow
investors to trade on the movement of a basket of stocks without
having to buy the underlying stocks.
   The CFTC and the futures industry oppose any shift, saying it
will cripple the agency's ability to regulate other futures
products and overregulate a segment of an industry that's battling
to stave off foreign competition.
   But the SEC and the Treasury Department argue the move is
necessary to curb volatility in the stock markets arising out of
price differences between the futures and securities markets.
   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady is scheduled to appear before
the committee later today and witnesses representing the futures
industry were slated to testify later this month.
   The administration bill also seeks to give the SEC authority to
set margins for stock-index futures. Currently, futures margins are
set by the exchanges, usually only a fraction of the amount
required in securities transactions.
   On Wednesday, a former top official of the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange blasted the CFTC as a ``pygmy of federal regulation.''
   It was the second time Thomas F. Eagleton, who resigned from the
Merc last year, had harsh words for the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission.
   Last year his criticism came in a hearing before the Senate
Agriculture Committee, which oversees the CFTC.
   In his testimony, Eagleton, a former Democratic senator from
Missouri, criticized the CFTC's light regulatory touch and its
limited resources to investigate illegal activities.
   ``The CFTC is about as sluggish a regulatory agency as one can
find,'' he told the committee members.
   Recalling last year's FBI undercover investigation of fraud in
the Chicago futures pits that led to more than 40 indictments,
Eagleton said:
   ``After the sting, the CFTC, this pygmy of federal regulation,
overwhelmed by its day-to-day operations, came plodding along with
too-little, too-late to catch fast-moving crooks and fast-changing
events.''
   Also testifying before the Banking Committee in favor of the
jurisdictional switch were representatives of the National
Association of Securities Dealers, the American Stock Exchange and
the Options Clearing Corp.

   The U.S. dollar firmed against key currencies in
European trading this morning. Gold was lower.
   Traders said the dollar was bouyed by a round of short-covering
as the economic summit in Houston brought no signs of an imminent
reduction in U.S. interest rates.
   Said one trader: ``The market isn't totally convinced about the
dollar, but given the fact it doesn't move lower, we're seeing a
prudent recovery. A lot of people had gone short before the summit,
and now they're covering up.''
   The dollar closed at 148.90 in Tokyo, up 0.80 yen from
Wednesday. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 149.30 yen.
   The British pound was quoted at $1.7810 in London, down from
$1.7980 late Wednesday.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe compared with late Wednesday's
rates included: 1.6577 West German marks, up from 1.6507; 1.4080
Swiss francs, up from 1.4030; 5.5620 French francs, up from 5.5285;

   Gold in Hong Kong dropped 64 cents an ounce, closing at $354.38.
   Silver bullion traded in London at a bid $4.84 an ounce,

   Stock prices closed higher on the Tokyo Stock
Exchage while th U.S. dollar rebounded against the yen today.
   The dollar closed at 148.90 yen, up 0.80 yen from Wednesday's
finish of 148.10 yen, the lowest closing since late February.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues rose 281.14

   Currency dealers said the dollar firmed after the economic
summit in Houston failed to meet market expections of a call for a
stronger yen.
   They also said the dollar's rebound followed Bank of Japan

<HEAD>Wheat Crop Expected to Meet Demand for First Time Since Mid '80s</HEAD>

   Farmers are harvesting a bumper wheat crop,
large enough to bring U.S. production into line with demand for the
first time since the mid-1980s, according to Agriculture Department
analysts.
   But less than half of the U.S. output is used domestically,
meaning that the financial well-being of wheat farmers depends
heavily on the export market.
   Also, production is being stepped up in other countries,
including some of the biggest U.S. export competitors. Production
in the Soviet Union and China _ two huge markets for U.S. wheat _
also is increasing this year.
   Globally, says Sara Schwartz of USDA's Economic Research
Service, wheat production is expected to exceed consumption for the
first time since 1987-88, meaning ``a modest recovery'' in world
inventories during 1990-91.
   That translates into lower wheat prices and an increase in world
wheat trading, including more for livestock feeding.
   Schwartz and colleague Pete Riley said in the July issue of
Agricultural Outlook magazine that many livestock feeders around
the world will turn more heavily to wheat as tight supplies of corn
and other coarse grains bolster prices of traditional feed supplies.
   Major U.S. competitors will have larger exportable supplies of
wheat because of bigger crops this year, reflecting favorable
weather across much of northern Europe, improved moisture
conditions in the Canadian spring wheat areas and good planting
conditions in Argentina and parts of Australia.
   Another reason will be the anticipated increase in the amount of
wheat imported for livestock feeding. The bulk of U.S. exports is
higher-quality wheat used for milling into flour and other food
products.
   ``Competitors, especially the European Community (EC), have
historically been the major suppliers of wheat for feeding and
probably will be the beneficiaries of increased trade in the coming
year,'' the report said.
   Schwartz, in a telephone interview Wednesday, said the general
outlook described in the report continues to hold up without
significant recent changes.
   ``The weather seems to be pretty good,'' she said. ``There still
seems to be some questions about dryness in the EC, but that would
affect spring crops more than their winter wheat.''
   Looking at the four major wheat competitors, the report said
wheat production in the 12-nation EC is expected to be the second
largest on record, with yield increases most notable in France and
the United Kingdom.
   Canada is forecast to boost wheat output sharply in 1990-91. The
report said Canadian farmers have few production alternatives, and
``planting conditions are better than last year.''
   Although prices are down from 1989-90, those still are expected
to make wheat attractive to producers.
   In Australia, wheat production is expected to be down from last
season because of lower yields, the report said. Sheep production
competes with wheat for land, but wool prices recently dropped
sharply and there are large stockpiles.
   ``Even though world wheat prices are likely to fall in 1990-91,
the relative change in prices between wheat and wool is making
wheat more attractive to some producers,'' the report said.
``Moreover, depreciation of the Australian dollar likely will
cushion Australian producers from the slide in prices.''
   Argentina, the fourth major U.S. wheat competitor, is expected
to increase production, although there is uncertainty because of
inflation and farm costs.
   But the Argentine government has reduced export taxes on grain,
hoping to boost plantings, although it is unclear what effect this
might have on acreages.
   ``Despite these uncertainties, many Argentine farmers,
especially those who double-crop soybeans, probably need the income
that wheat provides and likely will plant as much or more wheat
than a year ago,'' the report said.

   The Agriculture Department has expanded
federal quarantine restrictions to control fire ants in all or
parts of six Southern states.
   The quarantine is being expanded to keep up with the spread of
the pests in Alabama, Arkansas, Mississippi, South Carolina,
Tennessee and Texas.
   Other areas where federal quarantine restrictions continue
unchanged include Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, North Carolina,
Oklahoma and Puerto Rico.
   James W. Glosser, administrator of the department's Animal and
Plant Health Inspection Service, said the restrictions are on the
interstate movement of ``certain goods and equipment to prevent the
artificial spread'' of the imported fire ant into uninfested areas.
   ``For example, nursery stock is treated before being shipped
from infested areas to be sure it isn't harboring the ants,'' he
said.
   The imported fire ant builds large mounds in fields and
pastures, the agency said.
   Fire ants can damage certain crops, and the stings are painful
to livestock, pets and people, not only on farms but also in the
suburbs and cities of infested areas.

<HEAD>Summit Leaders Give Trade Talks a Nudge, But Hard Bargaining
Remains</HEAD>

   Western leaders managed a breakthrough in a
long-troublesome trade dispute but still left it to their aides to
do the hard bargaining needed to craft a final plan for revamping
global commerce.
   ``I'm not under any illusions that we'll be dealing with a new
era by Christmas _ or even by next spring,'' Canadian Prime
Minister Brian Mulroney said at Wednesday's close of a three-day
economic summit.
   President Bush joined Mulroney and other leaders of the seven
richest democracies in pledging to make sharp cuts in government
support for farmers, a contentious issue in the current Uruguay
Round of world trade talks.
   ``What we're trying to do is move the whole thing forward
without saying that we have to have, tomorrow, totally unprotected
trade,'' Bush told a news conference.
   The leaders of Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Canada,
Italy and the United States took part in the summit. A
representative of the 12-nation European Community also attended.
   The Uruguay Round talks, involving some 100 countries, have been
stymied by a nasty dispute between the United States and its
European trading partners over slashing government payments to
farmers. The United States wants the Europeans to cut more than
they have been willing to do so far.
   The global trade bargaining, which opened in 1986, is due to end
in early December in Brussels, Belgium.
   To try to restart the negotiations, aides to the summit leaders
reached a last-minute compromise that promised ``substantial,
progressive reductions'' in export subsidies, domestic price
supports and barriers to imported goods. The United States had
wanted to target those three areas.
   In a bow to the Europeans, the leaders acknowledged differences
in ``the social and economic conditions of farming.'' European
officials contend they need their extensive subsidy program to
protect their many small-scale farms.
   The compromise also contained a European demand that they be
allowed to work out a formula to measure, and then reduce, a
variety of farm subsidies.
   Both sides claimed success.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said there were ``some
quite tough discussions'' among the seven leaders over farm
subsidies and, even now, progress on actual cuts would be slow.
   ``But there has been movement on all sides,'' she said.
   Jacques Delors, president of the European Community's executive
body, agreed, ``This is clear progress on both sides.''
   ``We have finally gotten the European Community engaged in a
negotiation,'' said a senior American official, demanding
anonymity. ``That, I do not believe, has occurred to date.''
   The administration is counting on the talks to lower trade
barriers and greatly expand opportunities for American farmers and
businesses abroad. The aim is to help narrow America's $100
billion-plus trade deficits.
   The negotiations, which began in Uruguay in 1986, face a July 23
bargaining session in Geneva to draft basic agreements in 15
separate areas, including agriculture.
   Those outlines will then be used over the next five months to
achieve a final deal by the December deadline.
   Looking ahead at the schedule, the senior American official
predicted negotiators will ``take three or four steps forward, one
back. There will be times when we are discouraged and times when
we're elated.''
   The Uruguay Round is being held under the auspices of the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, a forum and agreement for
promoting freer trade.

   Corrupt executives who pillaged the savings
and loan industry would face an expanded army of investigators and
longer prison terms under major crime legislation approved by the
Senate.
   ``We need to be cracking down on the orgy of fraud and
lawbreaking that occurred in the savings and loan crisis,'' Sen.
Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said Wednesday as the crime bill was approved
94-6 and sent to the House.
   The savings and loan provisions came as a last-minute addition
to the crime package, which also would place curbs on nine kinds of
semiautomatic assault weapons and make 34 federal offenses
punishable by death.
   Senate approval of more money, new weapons and fresh troops to
aid prosecutors put pressure on the Bush administration to clean up
the scandal.
   Lawmakers said the S&amp;L scandal was heating up as an issue on the
congressional campaign trail.
   The only lawmaker to oppose the provisions, Sen. William
Armstrong, R-Colo., acknowledged that while calling the bill ``a
knee-jerk response to the outrage that is spreading across the
country over the savings and loan crisis.''
   The plan provides for $162.5 million in each of the next three
years to increase the number of agents and prosecutors pursuing S&amp;L
fraud and embezzlement cases.
   Sponsors said the funds would allow the FBI to add 224 agents
and 146 support aides while permitting U.S. attorneys' offices to
bring on 205 more prosecutors plus 205 support workers and 50
auditors.
   The Justice Department's tax, civil and criminal divisions would
be fortified with 104 attorneys and 78 support workers in addition
to those added after $50 million was appropriated in the current
fiscal year.
   Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del., chairman of the Senate
Judiciary Committee and floor manager of the bill, estimated the
overall price tag as $2 billion a year starting in 1991 and
acknowledged that the source of the funds was uncertain.
   The measure would also authorize $16 million for the fiscal year
starting Oct. 1 for the Internal Revenue Service to expand its
corps of investigators pursuing savings and loan cases.
   A new financial institutions fraud unit would be established in
the Justice Department. The measure also would establish strike
forces composed of FBI agents, IRS investigators, bank examiners
and prosecutors in cities hardest hit by the scandal.
   Maximum prison time for bank fraud and embezzlement would be
increased from 20 years to 30 years under the plan and mandatory
minimums would be set.
   The bill also provides life sentences as a maximum for a special
category of S&amp;L ``kingpins'' who act in concert with three others
and derive more than $5 million from their crimes.
   The bill would expand the possible use of the Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act against S&amp;L crime. Federal
prosecutors would gain power to seize and freeze assets of savings
and loan looters under the measure and whistle blowers could get
rewards of up to $300,000 for helping put perpetrators behind bars.
   ``It is essential that those who broke the law be pursued
aggressively and brought to justice,'' said Sen. Timothy Wirth,
D-Colo.
   ``Of we give the FBI and the U.S. attorneys more help, the
Department of Justice will be able to make progress against the
significant backlog of cases and pursue new cases,'' Wirth said.
   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole of Kansas was critical of
``slick political operatives'' who are trying to capitalize on the
S&amp;L issue for fall congressional campaigns.
   He called it ``good news for the American people, who don't want
to trivialize an American financial tragedy with ill-conceived
efforts to achieve short-term political gain.''
   Senators voting against the crime bill were Armstrong and Sens.
David Durenberger, R-Minn.; Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., Edward M.
Kennedy, D-Mass.; Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, and William Roth,
R-Del.

   President Bush's son Neil was unqualified to
be a director of a Colorado thrift, but that doesn't excuse him
from harm caused to the institution that failed at a cost of $1
billion, federal regulators say.
   Neil Bush described himself Wednesday as ``just a Denver guy
trying to make a living and raise a family,'' and not as a
freewheeling former director of Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan
Association.
   Bush, 34, continued to deny conflict of interest allegations
raised against him by thrift regulators.
   Meanwhile, President Bush strongly defended his son on
Wednesday, saying he has confidence in his ``honor and integrity.''
   The president, who has pledged to vigorously prosecute fraud in
the savings and loan industry, repeated his promise not to
interfere with regulators' investigation of his son.
   ``If he's done something wrong, the system will digest that,''
he told a news conference in Houston. ``This is not easy for me as
a father. It's easy for me as a president because the system is
going to work. I am not going to intervene.''
   In documents released by the Office of Thrift Supervision,
regulators asserted that Neil Bush was ``unqualified and
untrained'' for his position as an outside director of Denver-based
Silverado.
   ``Certainly he had no experience in managing a large
corporation, especially a financial institution with almost $2
billion in assets,'' said the documents released this week.
``Unfortunately, he was not cognizant of the conflict-of-interest
situations he encountered as a director of Silverado.''
   However, the regulators added, Bush's inexperience does not
excuse him ``from the harm and potential harm he caused'' to the
thrift.
   The younger Bush has been ordered by the thrift office to answer
allegations of conflict of interest in his role as a director of
Silverado, which lent millions of dollars to his business partner,
who never repaid the money.
   At a news conference in Denver, Neil Bush said, ``I am standing
on very solid ground when it comes to defending my role as an
outside director.''
   He said that his father ``had wanted me to keep a little lower
profile.''
   However, he told reporters for The Denver Post after the news
conference that he is thinking about running for Congress because
he thinks there should be more congressional accountability. ``I
may (run),'' he said. ``Not anytime soon because it's something I
have to build up to. But if I do it, it's probably going to be with
the intent of being part of a shakeup.''
   The federal government is considering filing lawsuits to recover
misspent funds from the officers and directors of 1,300 failed
banks and savings institutions, officials told a congressional
hearing Wednesday. Neil Bush could be among the defendants.
   L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp., appearing at Wednesday's hearing, declined to comment on
whether FDIC officials have recommended whether to sue Neil Bush.
   ``We are treating the Silverado case the way we treat every
other case,'' Seidman told the House Judiciary subcommittee on
criminal justice. ``Every failed institution, we go into and make a
thorough investigation of whether or not there is the possibility
of civil or criminal activity.''
   In other savings and loan developments Wednesday:
   _The Senate approved a broad crime bill that stiffens prison
terms for savings and loan fraud and offers rewards to
whistleblowers for turning in S&amp;L looters.
   _The former president of one of Texas' largest collapsed thrifts
was indicted on fraud charges in connection with a $700 million
real estate scheme. FBI officials in Dallas announced the
indictment against Edwin T. McBirney III, former president of
Sunbelt Savings Association.
   The regulators asserted that Bush was unqualified to sit on
Silverado's board. They noted that he graduated from college in
1977, worked on his father's political campaign for a year and
received a master's degree in business administration in 1979.
   The documents also noted that Bush worked as an oil lease
negotiator for Amoco Production Co. in Denver from 1980 through
late 1982, and later started his own oil company, JNB Exploration.
He became a director of Silverado in the summer of 1985 and quit
the job in August 1988, shortly after his father won the Republican
presidential nomination.
   In earlier years, Bush held summer jobs with Republic National
Bank in Dallas and a small oil equipment company there.

   Western leaders put their deadlocked trade talks
back on course and christened a new era of economic cooperation
with the Soviet Union in a summit President Bush says has
strengthened ``free wills and free markets for all mankind.''
   Bush, before returning to Washington early today, declared his
meeting with the six other leaders of the world's richest nations
had not only been a success, but ``it has been a celebration.''
   ``In Houston, the presidents and prime ministers who lead the
largest industrialized democracies met to build a world beyond the
Cold War,'' the president told a farewell party in his adopted
hometown.
   He declared the summit partners had managed ``to uphold the
revolution of '89 _ to help liberated nations enter the 21st
century as enduring democracies. To support free wills and free
markets for all mankind.''
   The three-day economic summit, along with a NATO gathering in
London last week, saw Bush and his Western colleagues groping for
ways to keep pace with the challenge of a world in transition.
   Bush said his summit partners ``all left feeling good'' at the
end of the Houston meeting.
   The leaders agreed, despite what British Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher called some ``tough discussions,'' to broad cuts in farm
subsidies, which are at the heart of long-festering charges of
unfair trade practices among the allies.
   ``Coming after last week's very successful NATO summit, which
took a major stride towards a more peaceful world, the results of
the meeting in Houston are an important step towards a more
prosperous world for everyone,'' Mrs. Thatcher said.
   Even Mrs. Thatcher, the most enthusiastic backer of the
compromise deal on subsidies, acknowledged that the process of
actually reducing them ``will be slow.''
   West Germany's Helmut Kohl and France's Francois Mitterrand were
reconciled to the summit's refusal, at U.S. insistence, to grant
direct aid to the Soviet Union. To the end, however, Italy's Guilio
Andreotti sought a united Western aid package to the Kremlin:
``When someone is ill, you don't want to wait for medicine.''
   Instead, in a communique, the leaders of the United States,
Canada, Japan and the four major West European nations urged the
Soviet Union to reform its crumbling economy and commissioned a
study of Soviet needs.
   They offered the prospect of ``meaningful and sustained'' aid if
Moscow cut military spending and stopped supporting regional
troublemakers, an apparent reference to Soviet aid to Cuba, North
Korea, Syria, Libya and Vietnam.
   Bush did not rule out American cash for the Kremlin after the
study supervised by the International Monetary Fund is completed at
the end of the year. But he was cool about that prospect.
   ``We have some problems. I'm not particularly enthusiastic about
the intercontinental ballistic missiles aimed at U.S. cities,''
Bush told reporter. He added, as he has on several occasions, that
he found Soviet aid to Cuba ``a little contradictory.''
   The first reaction from Moscow was favorable. Foreign Ministry
spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said his country welcomed new
approaches that ``correspond to the spirit of the times.''
   The summit, the first since the collapse of the Berlin Wall and
the end of communist governments in half a dozen East European
countries, appeared to mark the start of a new era of economic
cooperation between the West and Mosow.
   Bush sent an immediate telegram to Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev about the outcome, assuring him ``technical assistance
would continue apace,'' Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said.
   Bush told reporters on Air Force One that he messaged Gorbachev
``that I was going to call him in a couple of days, plus
congratulated him on his victory'' in the Communist Party Congress.
   In addition, Secretary of State James A. Baker III was due to
give a personal briefing to Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze within days.
   On the environment, the leaders of the so-called G-7 group
compromised too. The Europeans did not push Bush for specific
ceilings on gas emissions, blamed for global warming of the
environment.
   The communique said the seven nations would work to stop to stem
global warming ``as expeditiously as possible.''
   Overriding U.S. arguments that more study of the causes of
global warming is needed, the joint statement said ``lack of full
scientific certainty is no excuse to postpone actions which are
justified in their own right.''
   The final agreement on the agricultural front called for
across-the-board cuts in all categories of farm subsidies.
   However, the last-minute compromise between the United States
and the Europeans also allows the nations to measure subsidies in a
way Washington has opposed.
   The United States has been pushing since 1987 for an end to
agricultural subsidies, which cost taxpayers and consumers in
developed nations an estimated $245 billion annually.
   The European Community is resisting, saying Bush's demands would
put 3 million farmers out of business.
   There were fears before the summit that the international trade
talks, known as the Uruguay round, would collapse.
   But most leaders said they were confident the political push
from the Houston summit would help bring a deal by year's end.
   Said Mrs. Thatcher: ``The great achievement of the summit has
been to make it easier for all of us to reject short-term soft

<HEAD>Seat Belt Rule Might Be `Regulatory Overkill,' Business Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A new federal seat belt regulation for
American workers that will cost employers about $220 million a year
in training costs could be ``regulatory overkill,'' a spokesman for
U.S. business says.
   ``It's perhaps a little more nitpicking than one would like to
see,'' Fred Krebs of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said Wednesday,
reacting to a new rule that will require 35 million American
workers to use seat belts on the job.
   In theory, a business could be fined if one of its workers was
caught not wearing a seat belt.
   The regulation, announced by Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole, is
disturbing because it shows ``a mindset that Washington knows
best,'' Krebs said.
   Under the new rule, workers who drive on the job _ anyone from
delivery people to traveling salesmen to cab drivers _ will have to
wear seat belts. Even business people riding in taxis would have to
buckle up.
   The rule, a proposed addition to standards that fall under the
Occupational Safety and Health Administration, would exempt people
who are self-employed or businesses with 10 or fewer workers.
   Employers would also have to provide training courses for
workers who drive on a routine basis. The rule will not take effect
until after a 120-day waiting period and possibly a hearing next
January.
   Mrs. Dole estimated that the rule will cost the 5.4 million U.S.
businesses that will be affected by it about $220 million a year,
or about $6 for each driver. Krebs predicted the rule would end up
costing businesses more than that.
   Businesses that violate OSHA regulations face fines of up to
$10,000, but Mrs. Dole said only employers guilty of ``willful and
egregious'' violations of the seat belt regulation would be subject
to the maximum.
   Fine points of the regulation, such as whether it includes farm
workers who ride in the back of trucks, still have to be worked
out, she said.
   The regulation will be difficult to enforce, Mrs. Dole said, but
federal inspectors will make checks of seat belt use among workers
part of their routine.
   Mrs. Dole said the new rule could save an estimated 685 lives a
year.
   But Krebs, manager of the Chamber of Commerce's
business-government policy department, said ``it could be
regulatory overkill'' and that ``there might be more significant
safety and health issues that OSHA could be addressing.
   ``Seat belts are a good thing and people should wear them. But
whether or not this is a good regulation for OSHA is debatable,''
he said.
   ``There are limits to what employers can do to regulate the
conduct of their employees,'' Krebs added.
   The AFL-CIO, which represents 14.2 million unionized workers,
praised the new regulation but said the standard also needs to
require vehicle inspection and maintenance.
   The seat-belt rule ``is a first step in reducing the high toll
of job-related motor vehicle fatalities and injuries,'' the labor
federation said in a statement.
   Since 1984, when states began passing seat belt laws, belt use
among the general public has risen from 14 percent to 46 percent,
Mrs. Dole told a news conference. Thirty-six states with 88 percent
of the U.S. population now have seat belt laws, she said.
   Under the training programs required by the new federal
regulation, employers will have to familiarize workers with their
vehicles and give instructions on seat belt use and on the effects
of drinking and driving.
   ``I think people pay a lot of attention to what their bosses are
telling them on the job,'' Mrs. Dole said.
   Automobile accidents are the single largest cause of
occupational fatalities, causing about 2,100 job-related deaths a
year, she said.
   Mrs. Dole chose Wednesday to announce the new rule because it
marks the sixth anniversary of a regulation she pushed through, as
transportation secretary in the Reagan administration, that
requires all new cars to be equipped with seat belts.

   The stock market pushed ahead today, challenging
the record highs it set last month.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 12.63 points to
2,945.30 in the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers took a narrow lead over losers in nationwide trading of
New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 452 up, 436 down and
514 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 26.15 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   The Dow Jones industrials' gain carried the average past the
closing peak of 2,935.89 it reached on June 15.
   Analysts said buyers appeared to have been encouraged by the
market's steady showing of late in the face of a succession of
disappointments in midyear corporate earnings reports.
   Whatever the current profit picture, brokers say, traders seem
convinced that the current slow pace of economic growth is helping
to improve the outlook for earnings in future quarters.
   Energy stocks gained ground for the second straight day, powered
in part by new efforts within the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries to foster higher oil prices.
   Atlantic Richfield rose 1{ to 119&lsqb;; Chevron ~ to 71~; Texaco 1

index was up 1.01 at 360.42.
   On Wednesday the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 41.83
points to 2,932.67, its highest close since it stood at a record
2,935.89 on June 15.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by nearly 2 to 1 on the
NYSE, with 969 up, 498 down and 517 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 162.22 million shares, against 147.63

<HEAD>Japan's Trade Surplus Widens for Second Time in 14 Months</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's trade surplus expanded 28 percent in June
to $6.72 billion, only the second time in 14 months it had climbed
from a year earlier, the Ministry of Finance reported Thursday.
   The country's surplus with the United States, however, narrowed
to $3.25 billion in June from $3.62 billion in June 1989. The 10
percent decline was good news in the wake of a recent agreement
aimed at reducing trade frictions between the two countries.
   For the first six months of the year, Japan's overall
merchandise trade surplus shrank 22.8 percent to $25.79 billion
from $33.39 billion in the year-earlier period, the ministry said.
   Imports for the six months totaled $108.15 billion, up 5.6
percent from $102.43 billion the year before. Exports slipped 1.4
percent to $133.94 billion from $135.84 billion.
   Foreign Ministry officials attributed the June reversal to a
drop in import values resulting from a decrease in world commodity
prices and slowed domestic demand. At the same time, the export
values of many big-ticket items sold by Japan grew, they said.
   Kazuko Mizuno, an economist at Baring Securities (Japan) Ltd.,
said export growth had accelerated since the yen began depreciating
rapidly at the beginning of the year, and import growth slowed.
   ``When (the dollar) is between 150 and 160 yen, Japanese exports
are quite competitive and it's quite easy for Japanese corporations
to increase exports,'' Mizuno said.
   The dollar closed at 148.90 yen on the Tokyo foreign exchange
market Thursday, but it has been above 150 yen for much of the year.
   June exports to the United States fell 6.7 percent to $7.4
billion, in part because of sluggish car sales. But imports from
the United States also slipped, down 3.7 percent to $4.15 billion,
partly because of slowed purchases of lumber and aircraft.
   The overall rise from $5.27 billion in June 1989 to $6.72
billion last month marked only the second time since April 1989
that the nation's trade gap widened from the same month in the
previous year. The last year-on-year increase was in March, when
Japan's trade surplus broadened to $7.09 billion from $6.61 billion.
   Imports in June decreased by 2.2 percent to $17.04 billion from
$17.42 billion in June 1989, while exports edged up 4.7 percent to
$23.76 billion from $22.68 billion.
   Excluding March, when imports slipped because of extraordinary
factors, the year-on-year decrease in imports was the first since
February 1987, Finance Ministry officials said.

<HEAD>Cray Research President Resigns</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Marcelo Gumucio, president and chief
operating officer of Cray Research Inc., on Thursday resigned from
both positions and from the supercomputer company's board of
directors.
   Cray Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John A. Rollwagen
announced the resignation in a letter to employees, saying he and
Gumucio ``were unable to agree'' on implementing a long-range
strategy for the company.
   ``We attempted to blend our distinct management styles
effectively, but were not successful in that effort,'' Rollwagen
said in his letter. ``The decision to part is mutual and in the
best overall interests of the organization and the individuals
involved.''
   Rollwagen said for the ``foreseeable future'' he will assume
Gumucio's responsibilities, in addition to retaining his other
titles.
   Rollwagen was not specific in the letter about the nature of his
disagreements with Gumucio.
   Neither Rollwagen nor Gumucio immediately returned phone calls
seeking comment.
   Gumucio became president of Cray in November 1988. He joined the
company in 1983 as executive vice president of marketing.
   At the company's annual meeting in May, Gumucio said Cray
planned to continue expanding its line of supercomputers in the
1990s. He said the company's introduction of a new, smaller
supercomputer was an example of how the company was developing
outward from its original focus on the most powerful computers.
   Cray now is focused on a variety of products to fit the growing
demand for computer networking, he said then.
   Cray suffered a slump in 1989, with sales up just 4 percent to
$784.7 million and earnings declining 43 percent to $89 million.
   In April, however, Cray reported its first-quarter profit
totaled $9.5 million, compared with $1.5 million for the same
period in 1989. The company also said then that it expected its
profit for the entire year to be higher.

<HEAD>Fisher-Price Toys to Close Another New York Factory, Cut
Headquarters Staff</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAST AURORA, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fisher-Price Toys, the troubled Quaker
Oats Co. unit, said Thursday that it is closing a nearby factory
and slashing jobs at its headquarters here in a move that will cut
more than 500 workers from its payroll.
   Some 245 jobs will be eliminated at the company's headquarters,
and between 300 and 400 jobs will be lost when the shutdown of the
plant in Holland, N.Y., is completed by November. Until recently,
the plant made molded plastic parts that were shipped to the East
Aurora plant for assembly.
   Company officials said the move, coupled with the closing of
another plant in East Aurora earlier this year, would make
Fisher-Price profitable again.
   Fisher-Price is expected to have lost about $44.5 million during
the fiscal year that was just completed and the first three months
of the current fiscal year.
   ``The closing of the Holland plant was necessary because of the
excess capacity throughout our manufacturing system and the
continued decline in sales volume,'' Ronald F. Jackson, chairman
and chief executive officer, said in a statement.
   In February Fisher-Price terminated 450 employees when it closed
its East Aurora plant. Following the reductions announced Thursday,
the company will employ a total of 6,400 workers.
   Fisher-Price is scheduled to be spun off from its parent
company, Chicago-based Quaker Oats, in early January and become an
independent, free-standing company that will be publicly traded.
   Fisher-Price spokeswoman Carol Blackley said the company needs
to take the drastic measures to recoup its losses and ``be as
strong as we can possibly be when we go public.''

<HEAD>Senate Ties Food Handling by AIDS Patients to Scientific Findings</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: LEADS with 4 grafs conferee approval of changes; picks up 4th

<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   House and Senate negotiators today approved
major civil rights legislation for disabled Americans after
agreeing on a provision that would help protect the jobs of
AIDS-infected workers who handle food.
   Sponsors predicted quick final action in both chambers and said
the legislation could reach President Bush's desk by the weekend.
   The legislation prohibits discrimination against disabled
Americans _ 43 million, according to congressional estimates _ in
employment, access to restaurants, stores and other commercial
establishments, transportation and telecommunciations.
   The AIDS provision, approved by the Senate 99-1 Wednesday night,
would allow owners of restaurants, packing companies and other food
businesses to reassign AIDS-infected workers only if medical
evidence shows a need.
   Health and Human Services Secretary Louis W. Sullivan has said
no evidence exists for removing AIDS-infected people from
food-handling jobs.
   Most scientists believe AIDS is more difficult to spread:
through intimate sexual contact, punctures with needles or other
contaminated objects, and transfusions of contaminated blood
products.
   ``It's a clear message that AIDS needs to be dealt with in a
responsible way and we need to reject appeals to prejudice and
bigotry,'' said Gregory King, a spokesman for the Human Rights
Campaign Fund, a gay rights group. Male homosexuals and intravenous
drug users have been the chief victims of the fatal disease.
   The vote Wednesday represents a reversal of a previous Senate
vote and a defeat for Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., who said the fear
of AIDS would drive any restaurant out of business if the public
learned a chef or other employee were infected. He cast the lone
negative vote.
   Supporters say the bill is the most comprehensive piece of civil
rights legislation since the Civil Rights Act of 1964 outlawed
discrimination against blacks.
   President Bush has asked Congress to speed up passage of the
bill, which the Senate approved last September by a 76-8 vote.
   The House passed its version in May, 403-20, after including an
amendment giving employers the right to reassign food-service
workers with AIDS or other contagious diseases, regardless of how
they are spread.
   The vote Wednesday was on a proposal by Sen. Orrin Hatch,
R-Utah. Under it, the Health and Human Services Department would
have to evaluate all contagious diseases each year. HHS would then
determine which diseases could be spread through food handling.
   Food-service employers would be able to reassign workers whose
diseases are determined to be passed along through such contact _
tuberculosis, for example.
   ``All it says is, `Let's use science, let's not use
conjecture,''' Hatch said.
   Helms, however, said evidence that AIDS cannot be transmitted
through such casual contact is short of conclusive. He referred to
scientific findings as ``conventional wisdom.''
   ``I don't want to go to that convention,'' he said. ``I don't
want to take that chance.''
   On June 6, the Senate voted 53-40 at Helms' urging to support
the House AIDS provision. Later that month, however, House and
Senate negotiators refused to include that amendment in their
compromise version of the bill.
   On Wednesday, the Senate voted 61-39 to reject a similar Helms
amendment.

<TEXT>
   The opera singer who was the voice
of Sleeping Beauty can sue Walt Disney Co. in Florida because the
company does business in the state, an appeals court ruled.
   The decision Wednesday could mean a speedier trial for Mary
Costa, voice of the title character in Disney's 1959 animated film
``Sleeping Beauty.'' The Palm Beach soprano is seeking an
unspecified cut of the $60 million the company made from the
movie's videocassette release in 1986.
   Disney attorneys had hoped to move the lawsuit from Palm Beach
County to California, where the suit could have languished for
years in the state's overburdened judicial system.
   The company originally argued to have the Florida case thrown
out because Disney is a Delaware corporation with its primary place
of business in California.
   Circuit Judge Stephen Rapp refused to dismiss the case, and
Disney attorneys appealed his decision to the 4th District Court of
Appeals.
   Ms. Costa's suit claims Disney breached its contract with her by
not paying her royalties from video sales of the movie.

   Investigators are looking into allegations that
New York Telephone suppliers helped pay for bawdy parties and
prostitutes at annual conventions of company employees, The Wall
Street Journal reported today.
   State regulators are questioning whether the meetings at Florida
resorts resulted in higher costs being paid by customers, the
newspaper said.
   The meetings, held for one week each year from 1984-88,
allegedly involved improper contact between employees of Materiel
Enterprises Co., the purchasing unit of New York Telephone
corporate parent Nynex, and about 30 company suppliers, the Journal
said.
   Annual awards were handed out to the wildest attendees of the
events, the Journal reported. One Nynex worker won the
``Procurement Award'' three times in a row for his efforts in
enticing women to attend the parties.
   Other honorees included the ``Most Valuable Pervert'' and the
winner of the ``Moon Over Miami Award,'' for unspecified
activities, the Journal said.
   The story comes on the same day that state Attorney Robert
Abrams planned to announce his opposition to New York Telephone's
request for a $965 million rate hike.
   Steve Marcus, a New York Telephone spokesman, denied today that
the parties had resulted in higher costs to any of his company's
customers.
   ``We want to emphasize there's been no general increase in rates
since 1986, so no ratepayer funds are involved in any of the
allegations about overcharges,'' Marcus said. Nynex is preparing a
response to the charges, he said.
   Nynex refused to discuss the Florida meetings with the Journal.
   But the paper reported that at rate hearings held by the state
Public Service Commission, Nynex officials said details of the
parties and the names of those involved were ``trade secrets'' that
need not be disclosed.
   Abrams disputes that argument, and is trying to get the
testimony about the Florida parties unsealed.

   After repeated criticism for failing to round up
big names involved in the collapse of the nation's thrift industry,
the government has indicted two major executives in recent weeks
and is promising more.
   On Wednesday, officials announced the 17-count indictment of
Edwin T. McBirney III, once a flamboyant young financier who
presided over the tremendous growth and $2.5 billion failure of
Sunbelt Savings Association of Texas.
   Attorney General Richard Thornburgh said the indictment,
returned by one of three grand juries in Dallas investigating bank
and thrift fraud, ``marks another milestone in our crackdown on
fraud in the thrift industry.''
   Since Oct. 1, 1988, Justice Department prosecutors have obtained
307 indictments and 200 convictions involving S&amp;L fraud, Thornburgh
said.
   Thornburgh has been criticized in Congress for failing to bring
indictments against many former executives suspected of stealing
from thrifts.
   But he predicted it would take at least five years for the
Justice Department to investigate and prosecute remaining cases of
S&amp;L fraud.
   Last month, former Vernon Savings and Loan Association owner
Donald R. Dixon was indicted on 38 conspiracy and fraud counts in
the billion-dollar collapse of his thrift in 1987. Dixon has
pleaded innocent.
   Dixon and McBirney frequently were listed as being among the
most sought-after officials of collapsed thrifts.
   Bob Gilliam, special agent in charge of the Dallas FBI office,
said the increased pace of indictments was the result of manpower
provided investigators by last year's thrift bailout legislation.
   ``You'll see the numbers continually increasing,'' Gilliam said.
``A year from now, we'll really see the impact.''
   McBirney, 37, appeared before U.S. District Judge Barefoot
Sanders today to be apprised of the charges against him. He was
released on his own recognizance and faces a July 19 arraignment
before U.S. District Judge Robert Maloney. His attorney, Paul
Coggins, said he would plead innocent when arraigned later.
   McBirney had no immediate comment for reporters.
   McBirney was famed for the exuberant way he celebrated his
wealth _ flying friends to Hawaii for fishing and Las Vegas for
gambling, dressing as a king at a 1984 Halloween party where guests
dined on pheasant, antelope and lion.
   The indictment accuses McBirney of hiding from regulators
agreements with Western Savings Association over the partial
financing of $700 million worth of property in Southern California.
   FBI agent Pat Dorsey said the deal contributed to the collapse
of Sunbelt in 1988.
   The 17 counts involve one transaction. McBirney is accused of
ensuring Western Savings a $6 million profit on the sale of a
property of its choosing in return for Western providing $30
million in financing on California property being bought by Sun
Cal, a Sunbelt subsidiary.
   The charges against McBirney include bank fraud, misapplication
of funds, false entries and making false statements to regulators.
He faces to up 85 years in prison and a $4.25 million fine if
convicted.
   Coggins said the indictment ``is a typical case of government
overkill.'' He said McBirney would show ``he acted in the best
interests of Sunbelt.''
   ``This case shows the great lengths to which people went to
deceive regulators,'' U.S. Attorney Marvin Collins of Dallas told
reporters in Washington. He said Sunbelt's was largest S&amp;L bailout
thus far.
   Thirteen other Sunbelt officials, borrowers and accountants have
been convicted as a result of the 2{-year investigation of the
failed thrift.
   Sunbelt and Western, both based in Dallas, were among eight
insolvent thrifts taken over by the government in 1988 in one of
the largest of the efforts to rescue failing institutions.
   McBirney, who bought Sunbelt in 1982, was forced out by
regulators in 1986. Since then, he has been chairman of a company
dealing in waste treatment technology.
   ``Under McBirney's guidance, the association engaged in
high-risk loans that were either unsecured or inadequately secured
by commercial real estate,'' the government said in 1988 when it
finally closed the institution in a bailout estimated at least $2.5
billion.

   Morris Sultan knew the competition would be
tough when he decided to look for a new job, so he tried something
novel.
   Instead of writing a resume, he made a video.
   In a three-minute pitch sent out to a dozen prospective
employers, Sultan detailed why he should be hired. One firm liked
what they saw and brought Sultan in for an interview; he now
oversees customs and merchandise orders for M&amp;L Design, an
accessory importing firm in New York.
   ``Communication is a big part of what I do, so I felt like I
might have a better chance if they could get to know me. Usually,
they just take your number and say, `We'll call you.' The tape
helped me get noticed,'' Sultan said.
   The new-wave resumes are ``a nice calling card to start out
with'' that can give candidates an edge on the competition, said
Albert Dabah, who runs Video Portfolios where Sultan made his tape.
   But critics call video resumes a gimmick that fosters
discrimination and gives stressed-out job seekers more to fret over.
   ``The rare person, maybe in advertising or something, can come
across as a dynamo. Most people look like a jerk on videotape,''
said Kathryn Troutman, who owns The Resume Place in Washington,
D.C., which still specializes in traditional paper resumes.
   Most people don't like the way they look in photographs, let
alone on camera, she said.
   ``If someone tried to put me on a tape, I'd say, `Hey, I'm
trying to look for a job here, not get myself depressed.' There's
already enough trauma involved with looking for a job. This is just
an extra aggravation,'' she said.
   Since the tapes give prospective employers a way to view job
seekers' appearance, critics say they make age or race
discrimination too easy and give employers a way to weed out people
whose appearance they don't find appealing.
   But William Brown, who owns an Annapolis, Md., firm where job
seekers pay $149 for a package that includes a video resume, said
they don't give employers any more of a chance to discriminate than
personal interviews.
   ``We can't control discrimination. If a person comes in, there's
nothing to prevent me from saying, `Hey, she's a blonde. My
ex-wife's a blonde and I'm not hiring a blonde,' '' Brown said. He
conceded the tapes save employers' time by allowing them to ``laser
through'' candidates.
   ``If someone can't take 10 minutes for a haircut or time to tuck
their shirt in, why would you want to waste your time on them?''
said Brown, who founded Network Employment &amp; Resume Inc. five years
ago.
   Serouya Morey, the owner of M&amp;L Design, said Sultan's video
resume was the first he'd ever seen.
   ``It struck me as a little innovative, and this job takes some
creativity,'' Morey said. The tape gave him a chance to judge
Sultan's personality and make decisions ``you can't get from
reading a resume,'' Morey said.
   ``The bottom line is he probably got the job because of it,''
Morey said.
   At Brown's office, clients, already prepped on what to wear, sit
in front of a picture of the Manhattan skyline. Brown, with his
back to the camera, asks them questions that might come up in any
job interview. Clients talk about their current job and what
they're looking for in their next post.
   Tapes containing several five-minute interviews with people
looking for the same type of jobs are then sent to a network of
corporate clients Brown is developing. Brown declined to provide
the names of his clients.
   Steven Klein of Target Search, a Washington headhunting firm,
called the tapes a ``gimmick people are using to make money.'' Job
candidates lose out by trying to sell themselves on video rather
than in person, he said.
   ``A lot of it is chemistry. It either clicks or it doesn't. With
a video, you never get a chance to go eyeball to eyeball,'' Klein
said.
   Peter Cushley, who handles video and advertising for Brown's
firm, writes off the competition's criticism.
   ``If you're selling super widgets, is a guy selling widgets
going to tell you super widgets are better?'' Cushley said.

   Stock prices ended higher on London's Stock
Exchange Thursday, helped by a weaker pound.
   But prices finished well below their session highs, mostly
because of profit-taking, dealers said.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index rose 10
points, or 0.4 percent, to close at 2,370.5.
   The index gained as much as 25.8 points at late morning. Its
session low was a gain of 9.7 points.
   Sterling's decline in early trading provided encouragement for
shares with overseas earnings, dealers said.
   Wall Street's firm performance also provided support, with the
Dow Jones industrial average up 6.19 points at 2,938.86 as the
London market day was winding down.
   The Financial Times 30-share index ended down 7.6 points at
1,870.4. The Financial Times 500-share index rose 4.69 points to
close at 1,277.57.
   Volume came to 460.6 million shares, compared with 449.1 million
shares Wednesday.

   The U.S. dollar closed mostly firmer in European
trading on Thursday.
   Gold prices moved lower.
   Foreign exchange dealers said the dollar traded higher for most
of the day until some selling shortly before the close.
   Dealers said the dollar was on the rise because the Houston
summit of the seven major industrialized nations issued no
statements indicating support for a stronger Japanese yen when the
conference closed on Wednesday.
   The British pound closed higher despite a day of speculation
about criticism of West Germany, France and the European Economic
Community by Trade and Industry Secretary Nicholas Ridley.
   The pound fell when Ridley's remarks in a magazine interview
were published but it rose afterwards and closed at $1.7995, more
expensive for buyers than late Wednesday's $1.7980. The pound was
quoted at $1.8095 in early afternoon New York trading.
   Other late dollar rates compared with late Wednesday's levels
were: 1.6525 German marks, up from 1.6507; 1.4020 Swiss francs,
down from 1.4030; 5.5460 French francs, up from 5.5285; 1.8625
Dutch guilders, up from 1.8582; 1,211.00 Italian lire, up from
1,207.04; and 1.1580 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1586.
   In Tokyo the dollar rose to 148.90 Japanese yen, up from 148.10.
In London late Thursday the dollar was quoted lower at 148.45 yen.
The dollar was quoted at 147.30 yen in afternoon New York trading.
   Selected rates for the dollar at 2 p.m. in New York included:
1.6400 German marks; 1.3940 Swiss francs; 1.15725 Canadian dollars;
and 1,198.00 Italian lire.
   Gold bullion prices lost around $2.50 an ounce in moderate
trading that brought the metal near the $350 level.
   The late price of gold in London, the major market, was $351.75
a troy ounce, down from $354.45. The late bid in Zurich was
$351.60, down from $354.10.
   Gold in Hong Kong closed earlier at $353.45, down from $354.15.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at a bid of $4.86 a troy
ounce, unchanged from late Thursday.

<HEAD>Armond Hammer Sued by Late Wife's Heir</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Armand Hammer, chairman of Occidental
Petroleum Corp., has been sued for $700 million in damages by the
estate of his late wife Frances, which claims at least a half
interest in Hammer's art collection.
   The 18-count suit, filed Wednesday in a Los Angeles court,
alleges fraud, legal malpractice and financial misconduct. It
contends Hammer and a law firm representing the industrialist
repeatedly deceived Frances Hammer about her ownership rights to
Hammer's assets.
   The lawsuit was filed by Robert Weiss of Los Angeles, husband of
Joan Weiss. Mrs. Weiss is a niece of Frances Hammer and sole heir
to her estate. Mrs. Hammer died in December after 33 years of
marriage to Armand Hammer and named Robert Weiss executor of her
will.
   The 92-year-old Hammer maintains that his wife signed documents
waiving her interest in his art collection, which has been
estimated to be worth $450 million.
   Richard C. Cleary, a lawyer for the Weisses, said those signings
were part of the pattern of fraud and deceit. The suit also says
Mrs. Hammer was fraudulently deprived an interest in thousands of
shares of Occidental stock and millions of dollars in cash paid to
Armand Hammer in salary and fringe benefits.
   Howard Collins, a spokesman for Hammer and Occidental, declined
comment on the lawsuit.
   Also named as defendants are Occidental; the Armand Hammer
Foundation; Lewis, Overbeck and Furman, a Chicago law firm; and the
Armand Hammer Museum of Art and Cultural Center in Los Angeles,
where Hammer's art collection is to be housed.
   The lawsuit was the fourth filed in connection with the museum,
which is under construction beside Occidental's headquarters.
   The others were filed by Occidental shareholders seeking to halt
the company's involvement with the museum. Occidental has committed
about $100 million to building and endowing the facility _ money
Hammer maintains is well-spent because it promotes the corporation
and will provide a public service.
   Hammer began collecting art during the 1920s in the Soviet
Union. His collection, including Impressionist and Old Master
paintings and drawings by Leonardo da Vinci, had been promised to
the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.
   But he got into a dispute with that museum over how the art was
to be displayed, and instead decided to build his own museum and
donate the art to it.

   The stock market kept climbing today,
challenging the record highs it reached last month.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 41.83 on Wednesday,
gained another 13.62 points to 2,946.29 by 2 p.m. today on Wall
Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 6 to 5 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 771 up, 648 down and
513 unchanged.
   The Dow Jones industrials' gain carried the average past the
closing peak of 2,935.89 it reached on June 15.
   Much of the gain came after Chairman Alan Greenspan of the
Federal Reserve Board indicated that the Fed was ready to relax its
monetary policy if it proved necessary to counter a squeeze in
availability of bank credit.
   Analysts also said buyers appeared to have been encouraged by
the market's steady showing of late in the face of a succession of
disappointments in midyear corporate earnings reports.
   Whatever the current profit picture, brokers say, traders seem
convinced that the current slow pace of economic growth is helping
to improve the outlook for earnings in future quarters.
   But some individual stocks still came under severe pressure in
reaction to earnings news.
   Computer Associates International, the most active NYSE issue,
tumbled 5| to 10~. The company said it was likely to post lower

<TEXT>
   CPC International Inc. said
Thursday its second-quarter earnings rose 14 percent, helped by the
acquisition of three products in its European food division.
   CPC, a U.S. food company that makes Hellman's mayonnaise and
Skippy peanut butter, said sales in Europe were up 24 percent,
largely due to the acquisitions, made after the first half of 1989.
   In the second quarter of 1990, profits totaled $94.98 million,
or $1.23 a share, on revenue of $1.45 billion. That compared with
earnings of $83.1 million, or $1.06 a share, on revenue of $1.26
billion in the same 1989 period.
   The Englewood Cliffs-based company's earnings for the first half
of 1990 rose 15 percent to $173.9 million, or $2.24 a share, from
$150.8 million, or $1.92 a share, from the first six months of 1989.
   During the second quarter, CPC completed three acquisitions: the
leading producer of jams in Portugal, marketed under the brand
names of Mateus and Casa de Mateus; the assets of the Bee Hive
brand corn syrup business in Canada; and the Poti line of fruit
compote desserts in France.
   CPC's worldwide consumer foods business accounts for about 80
percent of its total sales. Its U.S. brands include Mazola corn
oil, Knorr products and Karo syrup, which showed strong volume
gains in the second quarter.
   Mueller's pasta volumes were slightly higher, while volumes of
the Best Foods Baking Group were somewhat lower and margarine
volumes continued to decline, the company said.

<HEAD>Corn, Soybean Futures Slip Ahead Of Crop Report</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Corn and soybean futures prices fell Thursday on
the Chicago Board of Trade while wheat futures rose slightly ahead
of a government report that was expected to contain a lower winter
wheat crop estimate.
   Analysts attributed some of the activity to position-squaring
ahead of the Agriculture Department crop report. Traders expected
the USDA to reduce its winter wheat harvest projection to about
2.05 billion bushels from last month's estimate of 2.09 billion,
according to one survey.
   In the report, which was released after the close, the USDA
lowered the winter wheat production estimate to 2.04 billion
bushels.
   The report did not contain production estimates for corn or
soybeans.
   The corn and soybean markets were mainly influenced by forecasts
for continued mild temperatures and adequate rainfall in the
Midwest through the end of next week.
   The weather in the Corn Belt has been so fine for crop
production that ``you could arguably state that yield potential has
improved,'' said Richard Feltes, commodity research director with
Refco Inc. in Chicago.
   At the close, wheat futures were } cent to 2 cents higher with
the contract for delivery in July at $3.07 a bushel; corn futures
were 1{ cents to 3{ cents lower with July at $2.76\ a bushel; oats
were 4 cents lower to 1 cent higher with July at $1.26{ a bushel;

<HEAD>Abitibi-Price, Two Partners May Build Recycled Newsprint Mill in
Scotland</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Canadian forest products giant Abitibi-Price
Inc. and two British publishers have agreed to buy a venture that
has been exploring building a newsprint plant in Scotland that
would use only recycled fiber.
   Abitibi-Price said Thursday the partners would build the plant
in Gartcosh, Scotland, under certain conditions that include
updating engineering studies and cost estimates and securing
approval from their respective boards.
   Terms of the deal were not disclosed. It comes amid growing
global demand that newpaper companies increase their use of
recycled newsprint to help preserve natural resources.
   Abitibi-Price's partners are London-based publishing companies,
The Daily Telegraph PLC led by Conrad Black and Mirror Group
Newspapers Ltd. led by Robert Maxwell.
   The publishing companies each would own 25 percent of the
venture called North British Newsprint Ltd. while Abitibi-Price of
Toronto would own 50 percent and operate the newsprint mill,
according to an announcement by the companies.
   It said groundbreaking for the plant could take place in the
first half of 1991 and construction time would take about two years.
   Bernd Koken, chairman and chief executive of Abitibi-Price, said
the mill would give his company a newsprint manufacturing presence
in the European community. The company now has nine newsprint
plants, all in North America.
   The North British Newsprint project was conceived and developed
by Stirling Fibre, a leading British waste paper merchant that has
been working on it for several years.
   ``We are delighted that Abitibi-Price and its partners are
taking over this outstanding project,'' Chairman Christopher
Wilkins of Stirling said in a statement.
   Current estimates are that the plant will cost about 200 million
pounds, or about $360 million at recent exchange rates. It is to
produce 220,000 metric tons per year of newsprint, using about
270,000 metric tons of old newspapers and magazines.
   The newsprint is expected to be sold mainly in the United
Kingdom.

<HEAD>Kimberly-Clark Earnings Fall On Charge From Subsidiary's Sale</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Paper manufacturer Kimberly-Clark Corp. reported
Thursday its second quarter pre-tax income rose 2.8 percent,
although a charge against earnings due to the sale of a newsprint
operation caused net income to fall 20.6 percent.
   In the three months ended June 30, the Dallas-based company said
pre-tax income rose from $147.9 million to $152 million. Sales grew
from $1.4 billion to $1.61 billion.
   But a $44 million after-tax charge connected to the pending sale
of Spruce Falls Power and Paper Co. Ltd. reduced net income to
$80.4 million, or $1.01 per share, compared with last year's $101.3
million, or $1.26 per share.
   The company said the charge amounted to 55 cents per share. The
sale of the Canadian newsprint subsidiary, 50.5 percent owned by
Kimberly-Clark, is expected to close in the third quarter.
   For the first half of the year, net income was $197.6 million,
or $2.47 per share, compared with $204.4 million, or $2.54 per
share, in the first half of 1989. Net sales grew from $2.82 billion
to $3.19 billion.
   Chairman Darwin E. Smith said the operating improvements in the
quarter came in the domestic consumer-related business and improved
results in Mexico and Australia.
   Kimberly-Clark manufactures Kleenex brand tissues, Huggies
disposable diapers, Kotex and New Freedom feminine pads, Hi-Dri
household towels and Depend incontinence products. The company also
manufactures newsprint and premium business and speciality papers.

   Cash-strapped Donald J. Trump tried to avoid
more financial problems Thursday at a civil lawsuit that alleges he
defrauded a union pension fund by using undocumented Polish workers
to raze a building to make way for the Trump Tower.
   Trump tried to distance himself from the accusation by saying he
did not directly supervise the 1980 project and did not know the
contractor had used Polish workers until after the job was done.
   He also said repeatedly during his 90-minute appearance that he
could not remember specific events and conversations.
   Trump's court appearance took place amid reports he is suffering
from a severe cash crunch caused by the enormous debt on his
casinos and real estate properties.
   Trump made a passing reference his financial problems when
plaintiff attorney Wendy Sloan asked whether he generally read
newspaper articles about his projects.
   ``Lately it's become almost impossible because of the volume,''
he said.
   If he loses this case, Trump could have yet another debt to pay.
The lawsuit seeks more than $1 million in unpaid contributions and
interest for the union pension fund.
   The multimillionaire developer and landlord was subpoenaed by
the plaintiff, a retired demolition worker who was a member of the
house wreckers union, to testify at the non-jury trial in
Manhattan's federal court.
   The lawsuit charges that Trump conspired with union officials to
defraud the pension fund by failing to make contributions on behalf
of 200 illegal Polish aliens who worked on the job.
   The complaint also names the Equitable Life Assurance Society,
Trump's partner in the demolition project.
   Trump said he probably visited the site on Fifth Avenue between
56th and 57th streets, but did not enter the old Bonwit Teller
building that was being razed.
   ``You have to be very brave to walk into a building under
demolition and I'm not sure I'm that brave,'' he said.
   Trump said he might have been aware that workers had lodged
complaints about not being paid, but he placed the blame on the
contractor, William Kaszycki, whom he described as ``a disaster, to
put it mildly,'' who could not handle the job.
   ``In life you make mistakes and this was a mistake,'' he said.
   Trump said he did not learn until sometime after the demolition
project was completed that Polish workers were used. He said he
still does not know whether they were illegal aliens.
   His testimony was frequently interrupted by his attorney, Milton
Gould, who objected that certain questions were irrelevant. On one
occasion, Gould muttered, ``This case is nonsense.''
   During one line of inquiry, Trump acknowledged that he ``on
occasion'' had used the pen name ``John Barron,'' but U.S. District
Judge Charles Stewart stopped Sloan from asking more questions on
the subject.

   The stock market swept ahead to record highs
today, inspired by visions of easier credit conditions.
   Much of the gain came after Chairman Alan Greenspan of the
Federal Reserve Board indicated that the Fed was ready to relax its
monetary policy if it proved necessary to counter a squeeze in
availability of bank credit.
   Greenspan's comments to the Senate Banking Committee were seen
as a departure from his recent position that weakness in the
economy did not warrant any immediate change in Fed policy.
   Though analysts differed as to how much the Fed's views might
have changed, the news was warmly received in the credit markets,
sending interest rates lower.
   Brokers also said buyers appeared to have been encouraged by the
market's steady showing of late in the face of a succession of
disappointments in midyear corporate earnings reports.

<TEXT>
   President Bush gave congressional leaders his
personal review Thursday of the NATO and economic summits, winning
praise for going slowly on Soviet aid and quickly on fighting farm
subsidies.
   However, one congressman said the history of farm supports in
this country suggests they ``will live forever.''
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater indicated the president
had not yet called Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to fill
him in on the summit.
   Bush said Wednesday he had sent Gorbachev a cable indicating the
results ``were positive as far as the Soviet desires went'' and
planned to call him in a few days.
   Bush, back in the White House froma week of summitry on two
continents, met first with his Cabinet, which greeted him with
applause.
   Then, joined by his secretaries of state, defense and treasury,
Bush gave more than a dozen top Democrat and Republican lawmakers a
rundown on the London and Houston summits.
   ``It was basically upbeat,'' Rep. Dante Fascell, D-Fla.,
chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said of the
briefing.
   Fascell said the United States had ``accomplished what it set
out to do'' in London in revising the Western alliance's military
strategy and showing ``that the Soviets need not fear NATO.''
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley said the economic summit, which
concluded Wednesday in Houston, ``made some progress. There are
still obviously some unresolved issues with respect to trade. ...
But in general, I think it was a successful outcome.''
   On the question of Soviet aid, Foley said the president
reiterated his belief ``that additional economic reforms are
necessary. I can only say that I don't dispute the president's
statement at this time.''
   Bush kept a low profile Thursday, ignoring reporters' questions.
   On Wednesday night, however, flying home from Houston, he said,
``We're very satisfied with both events. We've got a lot of work to
do now, but they went well.''
   The United States won a commitment from its six economic summit
partners and the European Community to revive the General Agreement
on Tariff and Trade talks by trying to find ways to cut farm
subsidies.
   Bush also withstood pressure from West Germany and France for
coordinated Western aid in response to Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's appeal for help.
   Rep. Bill Archer of Texas, the top Republican on the Ways and
Means Committee, said Bush was ``eminently correct'' on the Soviet
aid question.
   ``He was almost alone in that and ultimately, I think,
negotiated a good arrangement,'' said Archer, who represents Bush's
adopted home town of Houston.
   ``We're not ready ... to just jump in there with massive
economic aid'' before the Soviets move closer to a market-oriented
economy, Fascell said.
   Bush also said in Houston he will ask Congress to dismantle U.S.
farm subsidies if other countries agree to lower their barriers.
   Asked if Congress would buy that, Fascell said, ``If you follow
the history of farm price supports in this country, it's been very
difficult to conclude anything except that farm subsidies will live
forever.''
   Fascell said there was no question the subsidies should be
reduced, but added, ``we don't want to destroy our agriculture in
the process.''
   Foley said, ``There is great reluctance on the part of our
trading partners to dismantle'' their subsidies.
   The European subsidies ``go far beyond anything the U.S. does
with respect to agriculture,'' the speaker said.
   The Bush administration says such subsidies should be eliminated
because they skew international trading and cost taxpayers and
consumers billions of dollars in government payments and higher
food costs.

   Last week, H.J. Heinz Co. announced it was ``opting out'' of
Pennsylvania's anti-takeover law, making the food manufacturer the
latest company to voluntarily give up the protections offered by
the new statute.
   States increasingly are offering corporations more protection
from hostile threats. But faced with growing shareholder activism
and other considerations, some companies would rather tough it out
on their own.
   ``We don't need the protection ... We will live on our
performance,'' said Bob Pugliese, Westinghouse Electric Corp.'s
executive vice president for legal and corporate affairs.
   The Pennsylvania Legislature passed the anti-takeover law,
considered the nation's toughest, last spring after to an unwanted
foray against Armstrong World Industries Inc. by Canada's Belzberg
family.
   Armstrong welcomed the bill. But other Pennsylvania-chartered
companies, including Westinghouse and Heinz, began to take
advantage of a 90-day period during which they could opt out of any
or all of its provisions.
   David H. Gunning, a partner with the law firm Jones, Day, Reavis
&amp; Pogue in Cleveland, said corporate managers have had to weigh the
advantages and disadvantages of accepting the law's provisions.
   He described the dilemma: ``If I opt out of it, I haven't gotten
the added protection, but I haven't gotten the more immediate
problem of more active shareholders.''
   Shareholders, particularly big pension funds, don't like
anti-takeover laws that have been enacted in recent years because
they perceive the statutes as barriers to higher stock prices.
Shares of companies considered to be vulnerable to takeover
frequently shoot higher on speculation or when an actual bid is
made.
   Some of the big shareholders campaigned against the new law. The
California Public Employees Retirement System, the nation's largest
public pension fund, urged Pennsylvania corporations to opt out.
   Many companies complied with the request, realizing ``they're
going to deter investors from acquiring shares in the company,''
said William Tyson. professor of legal studies at the Wharton
School of the University of Pennsylvania.
   Westinghouse's Pugliese said, ``We don't want them to have a
disincentive to invest in Westinghouse.''
   New takeover defenses continue being enacted, although the
merger wave of the late 1980s continues to recede. The takeover
business has slowed as financing has become more scarce, but this
does not mean U.S. corporations are safe from hostile bids _
especially if financing becomes easier to obtain.
   ``There will come a time ... when money is going to become
available again,'' Gunning said. ``These statutes will probably
serve as inhibitions to some acquisitions in some place.''
   Stat anti-takeover laws have flourished since 1987. That year,
the Supreme Court upheld Indiana's anti-takeover statute in a
ruling that recognized the states' rights to develop corporate
defenses against hostile bidders.
   The Indiana law gave shareholders the right to decide whether an
investor who buys a big stake in a company, even a majority
interest, could vote those shares in corporate elections. The law,
known as a control-share statute, has been copied in other states.
   Anti-takeover laws also have been evolving. More than half the
states have adopted merger moratorium statutes, which generally
prevent a hostile acquiror from taking control of a company's
assets for several years without the approval of a specific
percentage of shareholders.
   Such laws were aimed at raiders who sought to pay for
debt-financed takeovers by breaking up a target company and selling
it piece by piece.
   The Pennsylvania statute has both control-share and merger
moratorium provisions and contains a provision that disarms
corporate raiders. Under the law, a raider is forced to return any
profits made after announcing a buyout bid that is intended solely
to drive up the company's stock price or set off a bidding war.
   Westinghouse and Heinz opted out of all the provisions.
   Tyson said states continue passing takeover laws with new
embellishments partly because many believe the Indiana-style
control share laws aren't strong enough.
   Furthermore, he said, ``The trend seems to be getting stronger
because the courts seem to be supporting these takeover statutes''
and upholding their constitutionality.
   Judges themselves continue to craft takeover defenses. In May,
the Delaware Chancery Court continued its inclination toward giving
boards of directors leeway in defending against unwanted bids.
   The court said the board of Apple Bancorp Inc., which is facing
an unwanted bid, did not violate a duty to shareholders by delaying
setting a date for its annual meeting, where suitor Stanley Stahl
was threatening a proxy fight.
   Delaware court decisions are watched closely because many of the
nation's biggest companies are incorporated in the state.

<HEAD>Six Month Update: Still No Plan, But Creditors Don't Seem Worried</HEAD>

   Six months after the Federated-Allied
department store empire plunged into the biggest retailing
bankruptcy case in history, it still hasn't produced a plan to
repay $7.7 billion in debts, reorganize and survive.
   But suppliers and creditors don't seem overly concerned, and
some are optimistic about the future of the stores, which span some
of the best-known names in retailing including Bloomingdale's,
Jordan Marsh and The Bon Marche.
   Federated Department Stores Inc. and Allied Stores Corp., the
retailing divisions of the Campeau Corp. in Toronto, are still
bleeding substantial amounts of money.
   Both lost nearly $100 million in the first full quarter under
federal bankruptcy protection. Last week they reported a combined
loss of $26.9 million in May alone.
   Nonetheless, they said the May loss was smaller than expected,
and four of their nine chains recorded operating profits for the
month. Seattle-based The Bon Marche reported the largest profit _
$3.9 million.
   ``From every indication we see, they are on the right track, and
we are going to support them in every way we can,'' said Bernard
Chaus, president of clothing supplier Bernard Chaus Inc.
   Chaus said he plans to ship the stores merchandise worth $30
million to $40 million this year. That's an indication of faith
among many suppliers that the department stores will emerge
successfully from their financial problems.
   A federal bankruptcy court has twice granted Federated and
Allied extensions on their deadline to submit a plan to reorganize,
giving them until Sept. 12. After that date, creditors can propose
their own plans.
   The retailers say they plan to ask Judge J. Vincent Aug for at
least one more extension at a hearing later this month.
   Federated and Allied sought protection from creditors Jan. 15
under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code, the biggest-ever
bankruptcy case in the retail industry. The move gives them a
respite while they devise a plan to pay the bills and emerge as
healthy businesses.
   The retailers had been struggling to repay enormous debts that
accrued from Campeau's takeover of Allied in 1986 and of Federated
in 1988. Much of the debt was in risky high-yield ``junk bonds''
that developer Robert Campeau sold to finance his company's
expansion in the United States.
   The stores themselves have remained largely healthy, despite
pockets of weakness in the retailing industry. For that reason,
some creditors have asked why the stores should remain in
bankruptcy court refuge at all, since it is the parent company that
was mostly responsible for the crippling debts.
   The court protection has delayed major decisions on expansion
plans and financing arrangements. Lewis S. Rosenbloom, a lawyer for
the retailers' major suppliers, said such protection could be
costly for the stores.
   The next major step in the case will be for Federated and Allied
to propose a plan to run the businesses in reorganization.
Spokeswoman Carol Sanger said the plan is due by late summer or
early autumn.
   ``I think until we see the companies' business plan later this
summer, it is difficult even to begin negotiating over
reorganization,'' said lawyer Joseph F. Kelly, who represents
holders of $1.2 billion in Federated and Allied junk bonds.
   While creditors await a reorganization plan, the decision to
appoint Federated veteran Allen I. Questrom chairman and chief
executive officer has reassured some suppliers.
   Questrom, considered one of the nation's best retailers, was
hired away from Dallas-based Neiman-Marcus in February. He had
spent 23 years in Federated divisions before resigning in 1988.
   Questrom is implementing new marketing strategies and cutting
out unprofitable segments of private label clothing brands, said
Thomas Tashjian, a retail industry analyst for Seidler Amdec
Securities Inc.
   ``As long as the losses remain reasonable within a wide range of
expectations, I don't think the figures are really an issue. I
really think the reassessment of strategy is more important,''
Tashjian said. ``And I expect them to emerge from Chapter 11 as a
very strong, vibrant competitor in the department store business.''

   Assets of the nation's 512 money market mutual
funds rose $3.10 billion in the latest week to $385.83 billion, the
Investment Company Institute said Thursday.
   The rise in the seven-day period ended Wednesday followed a
$2.20 billion drop in fund assets the week earlier. That decline
originally was reported as $2.24 billion but the Washington-based
mutual fund trade group revised it.
   Fund assets hit a record high $392.14 billion in the week ended
March 21. The Investment Company Institute said that in the latest
week, assets of 250 general purpose funds rose $763.5 million to
$133.98 billion, assets of 102 broker-dealer funds increased $2.12
billion to $160.04 billion, and assets of 160 institutional funds
rose $215.4 million to $91.82 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds fell in
the week ended Tuesday to 7.65 percent from 7.68 percent the
previous week, said Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade journal
based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield remained unchanged at 7.67 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
43 days, down from 45 days, Donoghue's said.
   The newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of 100 leading
commercial banks, savings and loan associations and savings banks
in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the effective annual
yield available on money market accounts fell to 6.14 percent as of
Wednesday from 6.16 percent a week earlier. The North Palm Beach,
Fla.-based newsletter said the effective annual yield available on
special savings accounts, called Super NOW accounts, remained
unchanged at 5.04 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 7.90
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, down from 7.91
percent the previous week. Yields were 8.09 percent on 1-year CDs,
down from 8.10 percent; 8.10 percent on 2{-year CDs, unchanged; and
8.16 percent on 5-year CDs, down from 8.17 percent.

<HEAD>Greenspan Hint on Interest Rate Cut Sends Dollar Down</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar tumbled Thursday in a selloff sparked
by Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan's suggestion that
the central bank might consider easing interest rates.
   The Fed chief's comments in Congressional testimony caught many
foreign exchange dealers holding portfolios weighted heavily toward
the dollar.
   Renewed technical buying in later afternoon New York trading
carried the dollar above its session lows against other key
currencies but it still ended below Wednesday's closing levels.
   In overseas and early U.S. trading, the dollar was driven higher
amid buying inspired by the lack of any currency-related
announcements when the seven major industrialized nations concluded
the Houston summit on Wednesday.
   It had been expected that the leaders would indicate support for
a stronger Japanese yen.
   But the dollar abruptly reversed course around midday in New
York after reports of Greenspan's comments to the Senate Banking
Committee reached the market.
   He said that slow growth in the money supply and an increase in
average interest rates on commercial loans indicate credit
conditions may be tightening independent of central bank action.
   ``If that is in fact the case, it could have undesirable effects
on the economy that the Federal Reserve would have to consider
offsetting using monetary policy,'' he said.
   Lower U.S. interest rates would tend to reduce returns on
dollar-denominated investments and curb demand for dollars.
   Hugh Walsh, a currency dealer at the Amsterdam Rotterdam Bank's
office in New York, said as the session progressed traders began to
view Greenspan's comments more skeptically, which may have aided
the recovery in the dollar.
   Walsh said Greenspan only stated the possibility that the Fed
might ease monetary policy and didn't declare that it would do so,
or when.
   Late dollar rates in New York, compared with Wednesday's late
quotes, included: 1.6355 German marks, down from 1.6540; 1.3895
Swiss francs, down from 1.4020; 5.4910 French francs, down from
5.5515; 1,198.75 Italian lire, down from 1,211.25; and 1.15675
Canadian dollars, down from 1.15885.
   Selected late dollar rates in Europe compared with late
Wednesday's levels were: 1.6525 German marks, up from 1.6507;
1.4020 Swiss francs, down from 1.4030; 5.5460 French francs, up
from 5.5285; 1.8625 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8582; 1,211.00
Italian lire, up from 1,207.04; and 1.1580 Canadian dollars, down
from 1.1586.
   The British pound closed higher despite a day of speculation
about criticism of West Germany, France and the European Economic
Community by Britain's Trade and Industry Secretary Nicholas Ridley.
   The pound fell in European trading when Ridley's remarks in a
magazine interview were published but it rose afterwards and closed
at $1.7995, more expensive for buyers than late Wednesday's $1.7980.
   A pound was quoted at $1.8130 late in New York, stronger than
Wednesday's late level of $1.7995.
   Earlier, in Tokyo, the dollar rose to 148.90 Japanese yen from
148.10. In London late Thursday the dollar was quoted lower at
148.45 yen. The dollar traded late in New York at 147.40 yen, down
from 148.40 yen late Wednesday.
   Gold prices ended mixed, rising in the United States after
moving lower abroad.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery
added $4 a troy ounce to settle at $358.10. The Republic National
Bank later quoted a bid of $357.70 an ounce, up $4.30 from
Wednesday.
   The late gold bid in London, the major metals market, was
$351.75 a troy ounce, down from $354.45. The late Zurich bid was
$351.60, down from $354.10. Gold in Hong Kong closed earlier at
$353.45, down from $354.15.
   Silver prices also finished mixed. On the Commodity Exchange, a
troy ounce rose of silver for current delivery settled at $4.890,
up from $4.836 Wednesday. Silver bullion traded late in London at a
bid of $4.86 a troy ounce, unchanged from late Thursday.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The stock market charged to record highs
Thursday, with the Dow Jones industrial average hitting a new peak
in trading sparked by visions of lower interest rates.
   The Dow average of 30 blue-chip industrial stocks jumped 37.13
to 2,969.80, giving it a gain of 78.96 points in the last two
trading sessions. That carried the average past its previous
closing peak of 2,935.89, reached June 15.
   Broader market indicators also showed strong gains, with nearly
two stocks rising for every one that declined on the New York Stock
Exchange.
   Much of the rally came after Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan indicated the central bank was ready to relax its
monetary policy if necessary to counter a squeeze in the
availability of bank credit.
   That could mean lower interest rates, which would help ease
pressure on corporate profits.
   Greenspan's comments to the Senate Banking Committee were seen
as a departure from his recent position that weakness in the
economy did not warrant any immediate change in Fed policy.
   Brokers also said buyers apparently were encouraged by the
market's steady recent showing despite a succession of
disappointing midyear corporate earnings reports.

   The stock market rose sharply Thursday, carrying
the Dow Jones industrial average to a record high in buying
inspired by visions of easier credit and lower interest rates.
   Dow Jones's average of 30 blue chips jumped 37.13 to 2,969.80,
extending its gain over the past two sessions to 78.96 points.
   That pushed the average decisively past its previous closing
peak of 2,935.89, reached on June 15.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 9 to 5 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
987 up, 545 down and 479 unchanged.
   Much of the gain came after Chairman Alan Greenspan of the
Federal Reserve Board indicated that the Fed was ready to relax its
monetary policy if it proved necessary to counter a squeeze in
availability of bank credit.
   Greenspan's comments to the Senate Banking Committee were seen
as a departure from his recent position that weakness in the
economy did not warrant any immediate change in Fed policy.
   Though analysts differed as to how much the Fed's views might
have changed, the news was enthusiastically received in the credit
markets, sending interest rates lower.
   Brokers also said buyers appeared to have been encouraged by the
market's steady showing of late in the face of a succession of
disappointments in midyear corporate earnings reports.
   Whatever the current profit picture, brokers say, traders seem
convinced that the current slow pace of economic growth is helping
to improve the outlook for earnings in future quarters.
   But some individual stocks still came under severe pressure in
reaction to earnings news.
   Computer Associates International, the most active NYSE issue,
tumbled 6\ to 10\. The company said it was likely to post lower
sales and earnings results for the fiscal quarter ended June 30.
   Contel jumped 7&lsqb; to 35&lsqb; and GTE dropped 1\ to 29} after GTE
agreed to acquire Contel through an exchange of stock.
   Energy stocks gained ground for the second straight day, powered
in part by new efforts within the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries to foster higher oil prices.
   Atlantic Richfield rose 4\ to 121~; Unocal 2 to 29}; Chevron 2~
to 73~; Texaco 2&lsqb; to 60&lsqb;, and Mobil 1~ to 63{.
   Other gainers among the blue chips included DuPont, up 1{ at
39~; McDonald's, up 1 at 37; International Business Machines, up ~
at 120, and Procter &amp; Gamble, up 1| at 90~.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 211.51 million
shares, against 162.22 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 249.23 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market increased $34.89 billion, or
1.01 percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
gained 2.21 to 199.32.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 5.83 to 433.37, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was up 4.21 at 365.44.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
gained 3.27 to 467.17. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 362.23, up 2.82.

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Marcelo Gumucio, president and chief
operating officer of Cray Research Inc., on Thursday resigned from
both positions at the supercomputer maker.
   Cray Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John A. Rollwagen said
for the ``foreseeable future'' he will assume Gumucio's
responsibilities, in addition to retaining his titles of chairman
and chief executive officer.
   Rollwagen said in a letter to employees that he and Gumucio
``were unable to agree'' on implementing a long-range strategy for
the company.
   ``We attempted to blend our distinct management styles
effectively, but were not successful in that effort,'' Rollwagen
said. ``The decision to part is mutual and in the best overall
interests of the organization and the individuals involved.''
   Gumucio, who also resigned from the Cray board of directors, did
not return a phone call Thursday. He joined the company in 1983 as
executive vice president of marketing, becoming president in 1988.
   ``It boils down to a style difference, maybe not even a
personality difference,'' Rollwagen said in an interview after the
announcement.
   ``My style is somewhat more intuitive and informal, whereas
Marcelo is more structured and more formal. That's one way to try
to put a handle on it. Neither style is right nor wrong. Both
styles have worked very effectively in a lot of companies,
including ours.
   ``The problem is from trying to marry two styles at top of the
company,'' Rollwagen said.
   Rollwagen emphasized there was no disagreement with Gumucio over
long-range strategies the company has been developing. ``Absolutely
not. We have full agreement on strategy,'' he said.
   At the company's annual meeting in May, Gumucio said Cray
planned to continue expanding its line of supercomputers in the
1990s. He said the company's introduction of a new, smaller
supercomputer was an example of how the company was developing
outward from its original focus on the most powerful computers.
   Cray now is refocused on a variety of products to fit the
growing world of computer networking, he said then.
   Cray suffered a slump in 1989, with sales up just 4 percent to
$784.7 million and earnings declining 43 percent to $89 million.
   In April, however, Cray reported its first-quarter profit
totaled $9.5 million, compared with $1.5 million for the same
period in 1989. The company also said it expected an increase in
profit for the year.
   Analyst Gary Smaby, president of the Minneapolis-based Smaby
Group, said he met with Rollwagen and Gumucio after the
announcement Thursday.
   ``My sense is the differences were stylistic differences,'' he
said. ``There was no particular event or issue that caused them to
reach this decision. It built up over a period of years.''
   The change should be a positive one for Cray, Smaby said.
   ``Any time conflicts are resolved, it bodes well for the health
of the enterprise. It helps people focus on the work at hand,'' he
said.
   Smaby said Gumucio told him he had not yet decided on his future
plans and did not have another job lined up.

<HEAD>Money Supply Rises</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The two broadest measures of the nation's money
supply rose in the week ended July 2, the Federal Reserve Board
reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 rose to a seasonally
adjusted $3,276.1 billion from $3,271.2 billion the previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, rose to a seasonally adjusted
$4,058 billion from $4,054.5 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose to a
seasonally adjusted $818.2 billion from $809.4 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   The annual growth rate in M2 so far this year is 5.7 percent,
which is within the Fed's target range of 3 percent to 7 percent.
The annual growth rate in M3 was 2.2 percent, which is within the
Fed's target range of 2.5 percent to 6.5 percent. The Fed has not
set a target for M1 growth since early 1987.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3,268.3 billion, a 2.3
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous
13 weeks. M3 averaged $4,060.5 billion, up 0.4 percent, while M1
rose 3.5 percent to an average of $807.6 billion.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window, excluding extended credit,
averaged $369 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, down from
$430 million the previous week.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $309.0 billion in the two-week period ended
July 11, up from $307.2 billion two weeks earlier.

<HEAD>Gold Prices Jump On Prospects For Lower Interest Rates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Gold futures prices spurted higher Thursday, erasing a
$3.40-an-ounce decline, after Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan
Greenspan said the Fed was considering easing up on interest rates.
   On other commodity markets, silver futures also rose; energy
futures soared; grains and soybeans were mixed; coffee fell; and
livestock and meat futures were mixed.
   Gold futures settled $3.60 to $4 higher on New York's Commodity
Exchange with the contract for delivery in August at $359.50 a troy
ounce; silver futures ended 4.9 cents to 5.4 cents higher with July
at $4.89 an ounce.
   August gold traded as low as $352 in the first half of the
session, following platinum's lead amid signs of significant
platinum sales by the Japanese, analysts said.
   The mood in the gold market shifted early in the afternoon after
Greenspan, testfying before the Senate banking committee, indicated
that the Fed was ready to relax its monetary policy if it proved
necessary to counter a squeeze in availability of bank credit.
   Lower interest rates could stimulate the economy and lead to
higher inflation, which typically sparks investor demand for
precious metals.
   Anne Orton, a vice president of the currency and precious metal
dealer Deak International Inc., said gold's strength would be
limited by fears of large-scale sales of bullion from the Middle
East and the Soviet Union, which have recently tended to sell into
rallies.
   ``The problem now is, where is the new selling going to come
in,'' she said.
   Petroleum futures surged their permitted daily limits in late
trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange amid reports that Saudi
Arabia had expressed willingness to reduce its OPEC crude
production quota.
   Crude oil prices have fallen sharply this year due to a
worldwide crude glut that analysts have attributed to
overproduction by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
   Traders have grown edgy over the prospects that OPEC members
will take action to reduce their crude output at a meeting to be
held later this month.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 78 cents to $1 higher
with August at $18.46 a barrel; heating oil was 2 cents to 2.66
cents higher with August at 53.04 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline
was 1.9 cents to 2.57 cents higher with August at 60.57 cents a
gallon.
   Crude oil futures are limited by the exchange to daily moves of
$1. The limit for refined products is 2 cents except for the
nearest-term contracts, which are limitless.
   Corn and soybean futures prices fell on the Chicago Board of
Trade while wheat futures settled mixed ahead of a report in which
the Agriculture Department, as expected, lowered its winter wheat
crop estimate.
   In the report, which was released after the close, the USDA
lowered the winter wheat production estimate to 2.04 billion
bushels from last month's estimate of 2.09 billion.
   The total 1990 U.S. wheat harvest is estimated at 2.7 billion
bushels, up 33 percent from last year's production, the USDA said.
   The USDA will not release official corn and soybean production
estimates until Aug. 9.
   But analysts working backwards from the report's soybean and
corn yield projections said the USDA projected a soybean crop of
1.86 billion bushels and a corn harvest of 7.85 billion bushels.
   Those numbers, along with a smaller-than-expected estimate of
1990-91 soybean ending stocks, were expected to give corn and
soybean futures a boost Friday.
   Wheat futures settled \ cent lower to 1 cent higher with July at
$3.06 a bushel; corn futures were 2\ cents to 3{ cents lower with
July at $2.76{ a bushel; oats were } cent to 3 cents lower with
July at $1.24} a bushel; soybeans were 5 cents lower to 3 cents
higher with July at $6.07{ a bushel.
   Coffee futures fell in late trading on the New York Coffee,
Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange following a report that Brazil, the world's
largest coffee producer, remained opposed to coffee export quotas
as a means of raising prices.
   Coffee settled 1.6 cents to 2.5 cents lower with July at 83.90
cents a pound.
   Firm cash markets supported cattle futures on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange. Pork futures ended mixed.
   Live cattle were .30 cent to .75 cent higher with August at
74.95 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .35 cent to .85 cent higher
with August at 86.27 cents a pound; live hogs were .18 cent lower
to .42 cent higher with July at 60.27 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were 1.4 cents lower to .07 cent higher with July at 50.25
cents a pound.

<HEAD>IBM, Diebold To Combine Bank Machine Lines Under Joint Venture</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BART ZIEGLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   IBM and Diebold Inc. said Thursday they will
combine their automated teller machine operations and market the
products worldwide under a joint venture.
   Based on last year's shipments, the combined operation would be
the largest seller of ATMs in the United States and No. 2 worldwide
after NCR Corp., said H. Spencer Nilson, the Los Angeles-based
publisher of a newsletter on the banking and credit industry.
   The arrangement will benefit Diebold by giving it access to
IBM's worldwide sales force. It also will allow Diebold to sell its
ATMs as part of a package with IBM's banking computer systems,
Nilson said.
   ``Diebold is the only major supplier of ATMs that wasn't tied
into complete (banking) computer systems,'' he said in a telephone
interview. ``NCR can practically give away the machines as long as
they sell the whole system.''
   IBM benefits because its ATMs are not as competitive as those of
the market leaders, he said.
   IBM, the world's largest computer maker, ranked eighth in bank
machine shipments worldwide last year and ATMs represent a tiny
fraction of its overall sales, Nilson said.
   Fujitsu Ltd. of Japan was second in worldwide ATM shipments
after NCR, but most of its sales were in Japan. Diebold was a close
third, Nilson said.
   Diebold's stock rose on the news, gaining $1.37{ to close at
$45.87{ in New York Stock Exchange trading. IBM shares closed at
$120.12{, down $1.
   Under the agreement, the joint venture company and Diebold will
market the combined ATM product lines of the two companies in the
United States, with assistance from IBM. IBM will market the lines
abroad, the companies said.
   No dollar value was placed on the deal.
   Diebold, based in Canton, Ohio, will own a majority of the joint
venture. International Business Machines Corp., based in Armonk,
N.Y., will hold the remainder, the companies said. Nilson said he
believed Diebold's stake was 70 percent.
   Robert P. Barone, Diebold's president and chief operating
officer, has been named chief executive officer of the venture.
   Diebold and IBM will continue to manufacture their existing ATM
products under agreements with the joint venture, but the venture
will own the manufacturing rights to the products, the companies
said.
   The venture, which will be based in Canton, is expected to begin
operations later this year. The company will have its own name but
it has not yet been decided, Diebold spokeswoman Mary Ann Jackson
said. Its products eventually will bear this name, the companies
said.
   The company will have about 500 employees, coming from both
Diebold and IBM, Ms. Jackson said.
   Robert W. Mahoney, Diebold's chairman and chief executive, said
in an interview that his company views the venture as a way to
increase its international business. Diebold currently conducts
most of its international sales through outside distributors.
   In addition, Mahoney said, ``We wanted a partner that could
bring very significant things to the table in terms of research and
development.''
   For IBM, the venture represents another move in its strategy of
combining its resources with those of other companies to reduce
development costs. IBM is involved in joint computer chip research
with Siemens AG of West Germany and in cooperative software
development with other companies.
   Diebold, which also makes corporate security systems, earned
$36.2 million on revenue of $468.9 million last year. About 12
percent of its overall sales were abroad, Ms. Jackson said.

<DATELINE>STRASBOURG, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   European companies and television
networks developing high definition television formed a consortium
Wednesday in a bid to make their version of razor-sharp pictures
and digital sound acceptable worldwide.
   The consortium is named Vision 1250 after the 1,250 horizontal
lines of resolution planned for European HDTV screens, compared
with the 625 on conventional sets.
   Its launch ``may turn out to be a milestone,'' said Antonio La
Pergola, chairman of the European Parliament's energy, research and
technology committee.
   The formation of Vision 1250 follows a 1989 decision by the 12
European Community nations to formulate a strategy to launch HDTV
in Europe.
   The founding members of Vision 1250 are NV Philips of the
Netherlands; RAI of Italy; the British Broadcasting Corp., British
Satellite Broadcasting, Laser Creation and Thames Television of
Britain; BHD TV, BTS, and Unitel of West Germany; Nokia of Finland;
and France Telecom, OFRT, SFP and Thomson SA of France.
   One of Vision 1250's objectives is to promote its 1,250-line
technology as a world standard. The system would allow HDTV signals
to be received by conventional 625-line European television sets.
   Japan and the United States have proposed a worldwide HDTV
standard based on 1,125 horizontal lines. Conventional TV sets in
the United States and Japan use 525 horizontal lines.
   The EC has rejected the Japanese HDTV technology on grounds that
it is incompatible with existing broadcast and reception equipment
in Europe and would give Japanese companies a virtual monopoly over
the television hardware market in Europe.

   Energy futures prices surged higher Thursday
amid reports that Saudi Arabia, the biggest member of OPEC, was
willing to accept a lower production quota to help rein in the
cartel's output.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the contract for August
delivery of West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S.
crude oil, soared 99 cents to $18.46 a 42-gallon barrel after
rising $1 over the first three sessions of the week.
   Gasoline prices also rose sharply. The August contract for
wholesale unleaded gasoline jumped 2.57 cents to 60.57 cents a
gallon following a 3.03-cent climb over Monday, Tuesday and
Wednesday.
   Meanwhile, home heating oil for August delivery shot up 2.66
cents to 53.04 cents a gallon after picking up 2.08 cents the first
three days this week.
   Reports that the Saudis were willing to temporarily accept a
production ceiling lower than their current 24.46 percent stake of
OPEC's output sent prices soaring.
   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has been
unable to persuade its members to lower their output, and this has
depressed oil prices.
   But the report about the Saudi agreement meant ``they would be
willing to be a swing producer and this was viewed as very bullish
for the market,'' said Andrew Lebow, a broker at E.D.&amp;F. Man
International Futures Inc.
   Traders got a further impetus to buy from reports that the
United Arab Emirates, another OPEC member, has agreed to a quota of
1.5 million barrels of crude a day. The United Arab Emirates have
consistently violated their quota.
   OPEC officials have been meeting in hopes of reaching some
agreements prior to a gathering of the full cartel on July 25.
   In natural gas trading Thursday, the August contract closed at
$1.5002 per 1,000 cubic feet, up from $1.500 late Wednesday.

<TEXT>
   Japan's trade minister visited one of the
major machine-tool manufacturing regions of the United States on
Thursday and proposed a dialogue possibly leading up to joint
ventures in the industry.
   Kabun Muto, touring Cincinnati after attending the Houston
economic summit, said the proposal was part of his plan to send a
mission to the United States in September to ease trade tensions
and promote U.S. exports to Japan.
   Muto, head of the powerful Ministry of International Trade and
Industry, spoke to an audience of about 250 at a luncheon sponsored
by the Greater Cincinnati Chamber of Commerce.
   His appearance was considered symbolically important, since the
Cincinnati area is a bastion of American manufacturing and its
machine-tool industry has been hurt by foreign competition in
recent years.
   The audience included Procter &amp; Gamble Co. Vice President Durk
I. Jager, who heads the company's international operations, and
executives of Japanese businesses operating in Ohio.
   Muto said that his emissaries hope to start a dialogue
``consisting of American machine tool and parts makers, and
Japanese users and makers to exchange opinions on procurements and
establishing such long-term cooperative relationships as joint
ventures.''
   Muto gave no details. But the plan appeared to be part of a much
broader agreement reached last month by Japan and the United States
on ways to open Japan's markets, alleviate the huge U.S. trade
deficit with the Japanese and make American products more
competitive.
   ``Although it is true that the trade imbalance between the
United States and Japan stands at nearly $50 billion, this is not
because Japan is trying to hamper imports from the United States,''
Muto said. ``Japan is certainly not forcibly exporting. It is
merely selling products that are demanded by the U.S. market.''
   Earlier, Muto told a news conference at Procter &amp; Gamble's
headquarters that U.S.-Japanese relations should be based on
cooperation in international economic development.
   His comments reflected the sentiment in a statement issued
Wednesday at the end of the three-day summit of the world's leading
industrialized democracies. They pledged liberalized trade with the
Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.

   Westinghouse Electric Corp. said Thursday its
net income increased 11 percent in the second quarter as
broadcasting revenue and operating profit grew.
   The diversified corporation said its earnings for the quarter
ended June 30 totaled $252 million, or 86 cents per share, up from
$228 million, or 78 cents per share in the same quarter a year
earlier.
   Revenue for the period were $3.175 billion, compared with $3.178
billion for the same quarter last year.
   For the first half of 1990, Westinghouse said it earned $462
million, or $1.57 per share, up 11 percent from $417 million, or
$1.43 per share, in the first half of 1989.
   Westinghouse said revenue for the first half of 1990 totaled
$6.04 billion, compared with $6.07 billion for the first half of
the previous year.
   Westinghouse's broadcasting unit saw substantial increases in
revenue and operating profit in the second quarter, compared with
the same quarter a year ago, the company said.
   Revenue and operating profit for the first six months also were
higher than the first half of last year.
   Other income increased in the quarter mainly because of a gain
from the sale of a minority interest in a cable television system,
Westinghouse said.

   Southmark Corp.'s former top officers caused the

   Examiner Neal Batson said in a report filed last Friday that
Dallas-based Southmark, which is operating under Chapter 11 of the
federal Bankruptcy Code, should pursue claims against former
Chairman Gene Phillips and former Vice Chairman William Friedman to
recover a portion of an estimated $1.5 billion in losses the
company allegedly suffered during their eight-year tenure.
   Batson also urged Southmark to investigate a severance agreement
reached last year between the company and former officers.
   At the recommendation of the examiner, Southmark's creditors
committee last month filed suit against Phillips and Friedman
seeking to recover roughly $68 million in payments and rights
surrendered to the officers.
   The report also advised the company to take legal action against
Grant Thornton, Southmark's outside auditor from the early 1980s
until 1988. Batson wrote that Grant's ``improper accounting'' was
key to maintaining the illusion that Southmark was a growing and
profitable company even as it slid toward insolvency.
   In a statement, Grant Thornton denied any wrongdoing.
   Concluding that Southmark was insolvent by December 1987, the
examiner tried in the report to explain how the $9 billion company
saw its net worth wiped out with one quarter's losses and wound up
in bankruptcy court struggling to repay $1 billion in junk bonds
with stock of doubtful value and $64.4 million in cash.
   ``The story of Southmark's rise and fall involved its ability to
create the illusion of success and prosperity that deceived the
investing public with a self-portrait of ever-increasing profits,
assets and net worth,'' Batson wrote in the report, the last to
arise from his investigation into the pre-bankruptcy affairs of the
company.
   ``The Southmark story is one of unsound acquisitions, overvalued
assets, illusory sales, phantom profits, hidden liabilities,
insider deals and outsider cronyism resulting in a `sea of red
ink,' '' he said.
   Attorneys for Phillips and Friedman, who said they hadn't yet
seen the independent examiner's latest report, criticized its
general findings.
   Henry Simon, one of the men's bankruptcy lawyers, said all
highly leveraged real estate companies in Texas suffered the same
fate as Southmark and that the state's real estate crash _ not
mismanagement _ was responsible for Southmark's woes.
   ``So far, there's no one who has received a business achievement
award for doing highly leveraged deals,'' Simon said.
   Grant Thornton said in a statement it ``emphatically disagrees''
with the report, charging the findings ``are supported neither by
generally accepted accounting principles nor generally accepted
auditing standards.''
   The accounting firm defended its work, calling its audits
``extremely vigorous.'' It said its audit resulted in a $200
million loss for fiscal 1988, in place of the $6 million profit.
   ``Southmark's story is that of a failed business, not an audit
failure,'' it said. ``Southmark did not fail because of its
auditor. Grant will not allow itself to be made a scapegoat and
will defend itself vigorously.''
   Under the bankruptcy reorganization plan outlined Wednesday at
the first day of the hearing, Southmark would contribute $100
million in new assets to its San Jacinto Savings unit, the
centerpiece of the proposed reorganization, and repay creditors
holding more than $1 billion in claims with cash, new debt and
stock in the reorganized company.

   Con artists as well as capitalists see a
potential jackpot in the globalization of investment opportunities,
a House panel investigating telemarketing fraud was told Thursday.
   Kansas Securities Commissioner M. Douglas Mays said that the
international investment fraud problem in this country ``parallels
the growth in legitimate international investment activity.''
   Mays, who is also president-elect of a state-level securities
regulators organization, testified about a report that found small
U.S. investors have lost more than $1 billion in the last two years
to con men.
   Schemes described ranged from high interest bank accounts on
Pacific Ocean islands to gold mines in South America.
   The 100-page report by the North American Securities
Administrators Association found that crooks who have been selling
phony oil well stocks and other get-rich-quick schemes over the
phone have now turned to bogus overseas investment programs.
   Other witnesses included William McDonald, director of the
enforcement division of the California Department of Corporations
and Lawrence H. Fuchs, deputy comptroller of Florida's Department
of Banking and Finance.
   Mays said the NASAA report identified two major centers of
alleged fraud outside the United States: phony offshore banks on
tiny islands in the Pacific and Caribbean, and high-pressure
telephone marketing operations known as ``boiler rooms'' working
out of Panama and Costa Rica.
   In one case cited, three boiler rooms based in San Jose, Costa
Rica, took Hawaiian investors for more than $200,000 in phony
investments in precious metals stocks.
   Officials in Iowa, Missouri and Alaska have issued cease and
desist orders against a Georgia man who has been promising
investors bank accounts that bear 9 percent to 21 percent interest
at a financial institution on Saipan in the Northern Mariana
Islands, the study said.
   Another case cited was a St. Louis man serving eight years in
prison for bilking investors out of millions of dollars nationwide
in phony contracts for five ounce bars of South African platinum.
   Missouri investigators found that the mine in question does not
produce five ounce platinum bars and the self-styled business
expert's previous experience was installing mirror tiles and table
tops.
   ``International investment scams are now the fastest-growing
fraud problem with which securities agencies are dealing,'' said
Mays.
   The study is based on an analysis of 87 major enforcement
actions and investigations by 40 state securities agencies in 1988
and 1989. It was prepared at the request of the consumer and
monetary affairs subcommittee of the House Government Operations
Committee.
   The study recommended that Congress:
   _Create a federal-state interagency working group on
international financial fraud.
   _Direct the federal Securities and Exchange Commission to work
with state regulators to create a database for tracking
international investment swindlers.
   _Pass pending lesgislation that would give the SEC greater
authority to crack down on various forms of securities fraud and
exchange information with foreign regulatory agencies.

<HEAD>French Lodging Company Agrees To Pay $1.3 Billion for Motel 6</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The French lodging company Accor SA said
Thursday it has agreed to pay about $1.3 billion for Motel 6 LP in
a deal it said will create the world's largest group of budget
motels.
   Motel 6 is one of the best-known brand names in economy lodging
in the United States, advertising its chain of 554 motels with a
folksy charm that emphasizes its low cost and no-frills ambience.
   Its radio ads end with the signature, ``We'll leave the light on
for you.''
   Paris-based Accor already owns more than 850 hotels and 3,000
restaurants in 60 countries, including the growing Formula 1 budget
hotel chain in Europe.
   The deal marks another hefty return for the buyout specialists
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., which led a group that bought the
Motel 6 chain for about $880 million in 1985 and kept a controlling
interest after the company went public a year later.
   Under the terms of the proposal, Accor said it had agreed to
make a tender offer of $22.50 per share in cash for the more than
55 million outstanding Motel 6 partnership units. Payments for
preferred stock make up the balance.
   An affiliate of Kohlberg Kravis owns more than 50 percent of
Motel 6 and the companies said it has agreed to tender its holdings
under the offer.
   The deal was announced after the stock market closed. Motel 6
units rose $2.62{ a share to $19.25 on volume of 1.5 million shares
in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Accor said the transaction already has been fully financed and
its offer is not conditioned on obtaining financing. Motel 6's
outstanding debt of about $1 billion is expected to remain
outstanding.
   The tender offer is expected to begin no later than July 18 and
close in August.
   Paul Dubrule and Gerard Pelisson, co-chairmen of Accor, said the
deal will help their company become the world's pre-eminent budget
hotel company. They said it would give Accor more than 775 economy
motels, well along toward its target of owning and operating 2,000
budget hotels.
   Motel 6 Chief Executive Joseph W. McCarthy and his management
team were expected to stay on, the French company said, and its
headquarters will remain in Dallas.
   The founding partners of Kohlberg Kravis, Henry R. Kravis and
George R. Roberts, said the deal made sense for both sides.
   ``It is appropriate at this time, five years after we began the
process of transforming Motel 6 into a dynamic, modernized and
aggressive economy lodging company, that it become part of a global
lodging company with even greater resources and potential,'' they
said in a statement.
   Kohlberg Kravis and its partners acquired Motel 6 from City
Investing Co. in 1985. The company was converted into a publicly
traded limited master partnership in 1986 with units offered at
$13.50 a share.
   A source close to the firm said investors who bought shares at
that time will have received over $27 per unit for their investment
by the time the Accor deal closes, a 21.5 percernt compounded
annual rate of return counting both the amount of the tender and
the $4.63 a share in cash dividends already paid.
   The source said those who invested in the original buyout did
even better _ a 38 percent compounded annual rate of return on a
$125 million equity investment.
   When Kohlberg bought it in 1985, Motel 6 had 378 motels with
42,279 rooms and 7,000 employees. The chain has since grown to 554
motels, 63,765 rooms and more than 11,500 employees.
   Motel 6's sales rose over the same period to an estimated $475
million this year from $226 million in 1985. Operating profit also
has risen, reaching anm estimated $220 million this year from $122
million in 1985.
   Accor said the deal will give it more than 160,000 hotel rooms
worldwide. Its properties include Sofitel, a luxury chain; Novotel
and Mercure, aimed at business travelers; and Ibis-Urbis,
moderately priced chains.
   Accor presently is expanding its Formula 1 budget chain at the
rate of about one hotel a week in Europe.
   Accor estimated it will earn nearly $150 million this year on
sales of more than $4 billion.

<HEAD>South Korean Union Sues U.S. Company for Unpaid Wages</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM KATES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A South Korean union sued a U.S. company
in federal court Thursday, alleging breach of contract for shutting
down its South Korean factory and withholding $1 million in wages
from workers.
   An attorney for the union, said the lawsuit was the first in
federal court by foreign workers seeking to settle a labor
disagreement.
   The lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court accuses Pico Products
Inc. of suddenly closing its Pico Korea Ltd. factory in Buchun City
in February 1989 to avoid compliance with a collective bargaining
agreement.
   The union is seeking more than $1 million in back wages and
severance it claims is owed to 294 workers employed by Pico Korea,
a wholly owned subsidiary of Pico, a Liverpool, N.Y.-based maker of
cable television components.
   ``In the United States, must a worker sue her boss to receive
her paycheck?'' union president Jum Soon Yoo said through an
interpreter.
   Yoo and a dozen other supporters ended a week-long hunger strike
with the filing of the lawsuit.
   Yoo and two other union leaders came to the United States in
April to get Pico Chairman Bernard Hitchcock to negotiate a
settlement after failing to resolve the dispute in their homeland.
Hitchcock has refused to negotiate with the union.
   At a news conference Thursday, Hitchcock repeated claims that
union representatives are ``terrorists'' who kidnapped a company
management team, ransacked the factory and seized its contents, and
extorted unreasonable contract concessions.
   ``They ripped us off for $2 million and stole the company. I'm
through with these people. We're now in court and I'm happy with
that,'' Hitchcock said.
   During their three-month stay in the United States, the union
leaders and a growing number of supporters have picketed Pico's
headquarters regularly.
   Last weekend, they protested outside Hitchcock's home in
Syracuse. Hitchcock responded by standing on his roof and dousing
the demonstrators with water from a garden hose.
   Frank E. Deale, legal director of the Center for Constitutional
Rights in New York City, which is representing the South Korean
union, said the lawsuit was filed on the basis of two federal laws.
   They are the Labor Management Relations Act, which gives federal
courts jurisdiction to enforce collective bargaining agreements and
the 1988 Worker Adjustment, Retraining and Notification Act, which
entitles all workers employed by American corporations to 60-day
notice of plant closings.
   Deale said the lawsuit would test whether that law can apply to
employees of a U.S. corporation who work abroad.
   The union charged that Pico Korea took full advantage of its
status as a foreign firm and enjoyed tax breaks and other benefits
offered by the South Korean government.
   The company grew rapidly after it opened in March 1983. The
workers mobilized in June 1988 to form a union in response to what
they called unsafe working conditions and subminimum wages.
   The union and company reached a labor accord in November 1988
that excluded the issue of wages, which was to be settled through
future talks, according to the lawsuit.
   But before those talks could begin, Hitchcock fired Pico Korea's
top officers and ordered the plant shut down, the lawsuit alleged.
   Union members admitted seizing the plant on Feb. 28, 1989, and
refusing to allow shipment of finished products, but said they did
so to force negotiations.
   Yoo said the union brought the lawsuit because the South Korean
and American governments were ``ignoring the crimes of
multinational firms against Third World workers.''

   Fisher-Price Toys announced Thursday it
was cutting 720 jobs as it struggles amid weak sales, mounting
losses and an expected spinoff from its parent company.
   The maker of brightly colored preschool toys said it was laying
off 245 employees at its upstate New York headquarters and closing
a nearby plant later this year.
   Fisher-Price in February closed its plant in East Aurora, where
the company was founded 60 years ago.
   Fisher-Price, which employs 6,500 employees in plants in New
York, Kentucky, England and on the U.S.-Mexico border, has lost
$44.5 million in the last 15 months. Company president Ronald J.
Jackson said Fisher-Price sales dipped to $700 million in fiscal
1990 from $849 million the previous year.
   He said the latest layoffs weren't necessarily related to the
scheduled spinoff in early 1991 of Fisher-Price from its current
owner, Quaker Oats Co. of Chicago.
   ``Whether you're a part of Quaker Oats or a public company, you
just can't go forward losing money,'' he said. ``I think these cuts
would be made whether it was part of Quaker or whether it was
independent.''
   Fisher-Price said it was closing its plant in Holland, which was
built in 1962 and employs about 475 workers, between September and
November because it is the company's oldest facility.
   The cutbacks at its headquarters, where the company will retain
a work force of about 950 employees, involve all phases of the
operation, including marketing, research and development,
operations and engineering.
   David Leibowitz, a toy industry analyst with American Securities
Corp., said the layoffs are designed to get Fisher-Price ``into
fighting trim'' before the spinoff from Quaker Oats.
   ``These are very hard things to do, but the reality is if this
company goes independent early next year and does not have a strong
parent to fall back on during hard times, they have to be able to
stand on their own two feet,'' he said.
   Jackson, who just joined the company seven weeks ago, said
company executives had been enthusiastic about the reception
Fisher-Price's products received at the annual Toy Fair. The
company had promised no further layoffs in upstate New York.
   ``By the time they got to April, and saw the business trends ...
our products just weren't doing as well as we'd hoped,'' he said.
   He said most of Fisher-Price's losses can be attributed to the
company's decision within the past 10 years to branch out from its
traditionally strong infant and preschool product lines.
   The promotion line of toys was aimed at and marketed to children
between the ages of 5 and 12 had only initial success and the
company has withdrawn from that line, Jackson said.
   He said Fisher-Price would refocus on infant and preschool
products.

   The Securities and Exchange Commission on
Thursday charged the troubled Colorado penny stock brokerage
Blinder, Robinson &amp; Co. of overcharging investors by more than $20
million in 21 months.
   According to a lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court, Blinder
Robinson marked up prices as high as 140 percent on penny stocks
when selling them to investors.
   SEC attorney Stephen J. Crimmins said companies are permitted to
mark up prices as much as 10 percent as commission for conducting
transactions, but they must notify buyers if they charge more than
that. He said Blinder did not.
   The SEC complaint said the alleged illegal activity took place
from June 1985 through February 1987, with some occurring in
Pennsylvania.
   In April the SEC suspended Blinder Robinson from trading in
penny stocks for 45 days and from underwriting such offerings for
two years. The SEC also barred the firm's founder and chairman,
Meyer Blinder, from associating with and registered broker-dealer
for at least two years.
   Blinder, 69, of Denver, Colo., and four associates were indicted
in February on racketeering and securities fraud charges by a
federal grand jury in Las Vegas. The indictment followed a 1988
Internal Revenue Service raid on Blinder Robinson's Denver office.
   Blinder Robinson once was the nation's largest penny stock
brokerage.
   Penny stocks are low cost, high risk securities, usually trading
for less than $3 per share. They are not listed on stock exchanges
and typically are used to raise capital for new or small companies.
The lack or reliable information about penny stocks has made them
prone to fraud.
   The complaint charged that of more than 1 billion shares of
penny stocks in 12 companies Blinder Robinson sold to customers,
99.7 percent were marked up by over 10 percent of the prevailing
market price.
   Blinder Robinson general counsel Kalmon Glovin said the lawsuit
appeared to be a ``rehashing of old allegations by the SEC, which
Blinder Robinson ... and Meyer Blinder have been and are being
vigorously defended against in other litigation.''
   Glovin said the SEC was ``relentless'' in trying to justify
``systematic destruction of Blinder Robinson ... and the
professional career of its founder, Meyer Blinder, under the guise
of protecting the public interest.''
   The Philadelphia lawsuit also charges that Blinder Robinson bid
for and purchased stocks at the same time it was distributing them
to customers. Crimmins said the practice is considered legal if a
firm informs buyers but Blinder Robinson did not.
   The SEC also charges that the firm dominated the market in the
12 stocks _ accounting for over 86 percent of all inter-dealer and
retail trading activity _ a practice which resulted in essentially
giving the company complete control of the price of the stocks.
   The SEC seeks permanent injunctions against the alleged illegal
practices. Crimmins declined to say whether other federal agencies
would pursue criminal charges against the company or its officers.
   Intercontinental Enterprises, Inc., the Englewood, Colo.,
corporation that owns Blinder Robinson, also is named in the suit
along with Blinder Robinson and Meyer Blinder.

   Federal Express Corp. said Thursday that
profits rose 5.3 percent in its fourth quarter but slumped for the
full year in large part because of the acquisition of Tiger
International.
   Earnings for the quarter were $43.1 million, or 81 cents a
share, up from $40.97 million, or 78 cents a share, in the same
1989 period. Revenue rose 14.7 percent to $1.9 billion from $1.7
billion.
   For the fiscal year ending May 31, profits fell 30.5 percent to
$116 million, or $2.18 a share, from $185 million, or $3.18 a share
in fiscal 1989. Revenue rose to $7 billion from $5.2 billion.
   Federal Express spokesman Dan Copp said the annual decline in
earnings was due largely to increased debt resulting from the
acquisition in February of Tiger International, a Los Angeles-based
air cargo carrier.
   Copp said the company's net interest expense more than doubled
in fiscal 1989 to $188 million due to the purchase of Tiger
International and was the primary reason for the earnings decline.
   Federal Express' long-term debt increased to more than $2
billion from about $75 million a year because of the acquisition of
Tiger International.
   Federal Express chief executive Frederick W. Smith also cited
international expansion, disappointing air freight volumes and
expansions at major hub facilities in Anchorage and Indianapolis
also contributed to the earnings result.
   Federal Express is the world's largest air delivery service.
