   The Rotary clubs launched a project Friday to
encourage members to help clean up the Earth, a sure sign that even
the ``sensible middle'' has gone Green, a federal official said.
   ``These people are not environmental radicals,'' said Richard J.
Smith, a special negotiator on environmental affairs for the State
Department, after addressing about 350 members of the Evanston,
Ill.-based Rotary International.
   ``These are a very solid, center group ... who are tremendously
influential (and) are beginning to think carefully about the
environment,'' he said.
   Rotary International claims some 1.1 million members in 25,000
Rotary clubs worldwide.
   The civic group traditionally has confined itself to service
projects such as the eradication of polio. In tackling the
environment, Rotary turns itself to what some may consider a more
political arena.
   But the group's world president, Paulo Costa, said the demand
for an improved environment is too urgent to ignore.
   ``The rush for development has pushed our ecosystem to the
breaking point,'' the Brazilian told the group. ``We have to change
our habits.''
   People at the conference planned workshops to develop specific
strategies for improving the environment through their clubs. Costa
urged members to begin by educating themselves of the problems in
their own backyards.
   ``Education is the true, real key,'' said Costa, who said the
threat to the rain forest in his nation first prompted him to
consider the new Rotary project.
   ``I see Rotary as an umbrella organization, a clearing house of
information,'' he said.
   Rotary members were encouraged to start environmental resource
centers, address ecology issues in their own communities, and use
environmentally sound practices in their everyday lives.
   They were also issued a list of ``101 ways you can help
`Preserve Planet Earth.''' Among the tips: sweep rather than hose
down sidewalks; clean air conditioner filters monthly; and fix
broken things rather than junking them.
   ``You represent the sensible middle _ and that's what we have to
engage if the job's to be done,'' Smith told the group.

<HEAD>Minister Closes Italian Roads To Trucks From Austria</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A ``war of trucks'' between Italy and Austria has
escalated with Italy's transportation minister closing Italian
borders and roads today to most commercial trucks from Austria.
   Transportation Minister Carlo Bernini's move came after Italian
truck drivers claimed they were discriminated against by Austrian
authorities, who limited the number of transit passes to reduce
pollution along the roads and protect the local environent.
   In a communique, the Italian Transportation Ministry announced
the suspension of the authorization for the crossing of trucks
through the border points at Brenner, Tarvisio, Prato Drava and
Resia pass.
   The ministry said the ban did not apply to trucks transporting
perishable goods.

   Thirty-five Albanians, most of them ethnic
Greeks, have fled across the tightly guarded border and requested
political asylum in Greece, the Athens News Agency said.
   The semi-official news agency reported Friday the Albanians
crossed into northern Greece in several groups late Thursday and
early Friday.
   Greek officials estimate that more than 250,000 ethnic Greeks
live in Albania, which has a total population of about 3.2 million.
   In July, more than 4,000 Albanians were allowed to leave their
orthodox Communist homeland after seeking refuge in embassies in
the capital, Tirana.
   Albanian authorities recently began building a wall around the
embassies.
   A U.S. congressional group that recently visited Tirana said
Thursday that Albania still holds a large number of political
prisoners, limits religious practice and restricts minority rights.

   An unemployed man who displayed a defaced portrait
of Mikhail S. Gorbachev has become the first person arrested on
charges of insulting the Soviet president, a newspaper reported.
   Gennady Smirnov strolled through Moscow on July 29 carrying the
portrait, the newspaper Vechernaya Moskva reported Friday.
According to law enforcement officials, Smirnov had penned
insulting and slanderous words and drawings on it.
   The 40-year-old man could face a $4,800 fine or a two-year
prison camp term.
   Smirnov is undergoing a medical examination to determine his
mental condition, Vechernaya Moskva reported.
   The Soviet legislature passed the law on slandering the
president in May after a May Day demonstration in which protesters
shouted insults at Gorbachev and other leaders in Red Square.

   The city's wildest tourists are up from South
America. They've enjoyed the cuisine and spent their nights
swinging around town. They also have razor-sharp teeth, and can
carry parasites and viruses.
   They are 25 recently liberated squirrel monkeys, and they've
turned a quiet Queens neighborhood into a wild kingdom since they
were stolen from a local business and turned loose three weeks ago.
   ``It's like vacationing in a faraway land,'' said Constance
Quinn. ``You look out the window and there's a monkey hanging on
the wash line or swinging in the trees.''
   The monkey business began when the animals were swiped from
South America Unlimited, which imports the primates and sells them
to research laboratories. The thieves' apparent plans to peddle the
monkeys to pet stores fell through, and they released them, police
said.
   Ever since, it's been monkeys in the middle of everything. They
pop up in back yards, dangle from telephone wires, lead local kids
on wild chimp chases. One found a new home in Mrs. Quinn's garage.
   ``I walked out there, and the monkey was just sitting on the
car,'' Mrs. Quinn said of her Monday monkey meeting. ``Then it
started flying all over. It was just hysterical.''
   Her encounter with the monkey has made Mrs. Quinn somewhat of a
celebrity. In addition to calls from reporters, she made an
appearance Friday morning on a radio station.
   ``What part of Queens do you live in? The Amazon section?'' the
host asked her.
   Actually, the Glendale section, which along with neighboring
Ridgewood is where the visitors are hanging out. The monkey in Mrs.
Quinn's place escaped despite the best efforts of a policeman and
an ASPCA worker; since then, two of the small brownish beasts have
been recovered.
   One was put to sleep because of the potential health risk; the
other is safe and sound in an undisclosed location, said Kathi
Travers, director of the ASPCA animal port at Kennedy International
Airport.
   The cute little critters are as dangerous as they are adorable,
Travers warned; they will bite if confronted, and they can carry
dozens of dangerous diseases, including potentially fatal Hepatitis
B.
   But after spending their time in cages since leaving South
America, the beasts are now busy living it up during their summer
in the urban jungle.
   ``We're worried, but these monkeys are having a party,'' said
Travers.
   Foodwise, they've discovered a smorgasbord: plenty of greenery,
trees and flowers to munch on, along with the occasional spider or
other insect. One homeowner already reported losing his backyard
grape harvest to the ravenous critters.
   But the good times will soon end, Travers warned. The monkeys
thrive in the heat, but a New York winter would mean their demise:
``Forget it. They'd have no shot,'' she said.
   ``They are cute and adorable, but they don't belong in the trees
of New York,'' said Travers. ``They belong in the trees of South
America.''

   The telephone calls from worried relatives
and friends of U.S. military personnel in the Persian Gulf start
streaming into Pat Enninga's kitchen about 5:30 a.m.
   ``People are just crying,'' said Enninga, an organizer of a
burgeoning support group known as S.O.C.'M. _ Support Our Country's
Military.
   In less than two weeks, S.O.C.'M.'s three main organizers have
comforted thousands of callers from around the country and spawned
several Twin Cities chapters and a letter-writing campaign to
American soldiers.
   The activity has been an outlet for people at a loss for
companionship and information since Operation Desert Shield
disrupted their lives. It also has rekindled some patriotism,
although the group insists it is not political.
   ``All we are trying to project is love,'' said Enninga, whose
21-year-old son, Shayne Hawkins, is with the Army's 82nd Airborne
division. ``As long as they are there and they have to be there, we
want to support them and look out for each other.''
   Yvonne Minor, another S.O.C.'M. organizer, said the group would
like to send American flags to the families of active duty soldiers
who request one.
   ``Morale is important to us,'' said Minor, whose 20-year-old
son, Shane, shipped out Aug. 6, about two weeks after he was
married. ``I wanted patriotism back in this country. I didn't want
it like Korea or the Vietnam war.''
   Minor, 45, of Savage, said she isn't alone. Many S.O.C.'M.
callers are volunteering to write letters to soldiers whom they
don't know and a magazine publisher is considering shipping unused
magazines to the troops, Minor said. She declined to identify the
publisher.
   ``Kids are sending little postcards and pictures of Ninja
Turtles,'' she said.
   But the group's primary mission has been to console families who
have been left with very little information about their loved ones
overseas.
   ``A lot of what we're doing is talking,'' Enninga said. ``We've
got people calling from Texas, New Jersey, South Dakota, Ohio,
California. We just try to get together and cry on each others'
shoulders or hold each other up.''
   She said the biggest fears surround the possible use of chemical
weapons by Iraq, but many callers have unique troubles.
   Enninga remembered a call from a young woman with 2-year-old
twins who planned to marry an American soldier a week before he was
summoned to the Persian Gulf.
   ``All of a sudden he's gone and she doesn't know where he is,''
said Enninga, 40, of Brooklyn Center. ``She sounded so young. She's
just totally devastated.''
   S.O.C.'M. makes frequent use of the Red Cross and officers in
each branch of the military to answer questions, many of which have
to do with mailing, Enninga said. A meeting Monday in the Twin
Cities also will feature a chaplain and a veteran of the war in
Vietnam, she said.
   Enninga and Minor helped start S.O.C.'M. after the idea of a
support group was aired on Twin Cities television by Betty Walters,
52, of Crystal. Walters has a son and grandson in active military
units and most of her family lives in South Dakota.
   Enninga said she has heard of similar support groups at U.S.
military bases.
   Attendance at the first two S.O.C.'M. meetings totaled about
100, but the group doesn't yet have membership scrolls and has not
logged the number of calls it has received. Minor estimates she
handles about 100 calls a day, but Enninga says she has no idea how
many calls she has received.
   The calls begin about 5:30 a.m. and last until about 10 p.m.,
she said
   ``If you're done with a call, you don't even bother to hang
up,'' Enninga said. ``You just press the button once on the
receiver and take the next call.''

   It started out as just another hot, lazy
summer and workers at the Quaker Oats plant figured the Gatorade
they were making was for weekend warriors on tennis courts and
softball diamonds.
   Now that it's quenching the thirst of full-time soldiers in the
Middle East, work doesn't seem so dull anymore.
   Thousands of gallons of the drink produced at the Newport plant
are bound for the Persian Gulf, and more is on the way.
   ``This started about two weeks ago when we received a rush order
for two truck loads of 12-ounce Gatorade,'' plant manager Bill
Wolford said Friday.
   Through some overtime effort, the plant got the order of about
500,000 quart bottles completed in time for delivery to Camp
LeJeune, N.C., and an airlift to the Middle East.
   Since then, the plant has delivered about 23,000 cases of the
beverage to Charleston, S.C., where it was loaded onto container
ships headed to Saudi Arabia.
   The plant currently is working on another order of 20,000 cases
of liquid Gatorade for the military and it's anticipating
potentially larger orders for the drink in powdered form.
   In Newport, a town of 8,000, there's a sense of mission at the
600-employee Quaker Oats plant.
   ``The folks here at the plant are very much aware of where this
product is going and we are keeping them abreast,'' Wolford said.
   ``We have several employees in the plant that have children in
the armed service and also in the reserves,'' general supervisor
Thom Pasinger said.
   ``It's a small town, so everybody knows where the shipments are
going. The guys in the warehouse are proud, we've got a lot of
veterans,'' said warehouse manager Mel Wadlinger said.
   Gatorade was developed for athletes in the 1960s to prevent
dehydration and heat illnesses. It didn't get its first taste of
military action until recently in Panama.
   The military's demand isn't expected to cause any less of the
product for the domestic market, said Peter Vitulli, president of
Quaker's grocery specialities division, at corporate headquarters
in Chicago.

   A crack in an old bell is nothing compared
with new maintenance problems at Independence National Historical
Park, which may start closing buildings as early as October because
of budget cuts.
   In fact, the once-troublesome, now-revered crack in the Liberty
Bell is one of the few sights that may remain open to the public if
the park is forced to get by on the funds they now expect.
   ``We have literally reached the point where we can't maintain
the park,'' Bernie Goodman, the park's acting superintendent, said
Friday.
   Independence Hall is developing a leaky roof, original wood is
rotting and everything from light poles to brick and flagstone
walkways are in disrepair.
   Signs at the far end of the three-block mall north of
Independence Mall near downtown Philadelphia warn: ``Danger: Uneven
walking surface. Enter at your own risk.''
   Sand has been thrown over some of the brick surface, rippled by
roots from trees that shaded what used to be a popular picnic area.
Plastic bags cover light poles once topped by globes. None of the
11 fountains works.
   Park officials said there are two problems: insufficient funds
to make regular repairs, and not enough to pay the staff needed to
keep buildings open.
   Officials said they need about $8.5 million in the budget year
beginning Oct. 1 to maintain what they did this year for $7.9
million _ which included some temporary building closings. But they
expect to be about $483,000 short.
   In addition, park officials say they need a bigger chunk of
money from a maintenance fund for parks in the region. Only $60,000
of the requested $175,000 for re-roofing Independence Hall came
from the fund this year, so only a fourth of the job was done.
Pieces of metal have been shoved under some of the red cedar
shingles to keep out water until workers can do more.
   Money shortages could cause the closing of all but Independence
Hall, the Liberty Bell Pavilion and the Visitor Center in October,
Goodman said.
   Potential targets: Congress Hall, where George Washington was
inaugurated for a second term; Old City Hall, former home of the
Supreme Court; and Franklin Court, where steel ghost structures
outline the site of Benjamin Franklin's home and print shop.
   Goodman said those buildings attract about 1.3 million people a
year.
   The situation has Goodman and visitor services director Kathy
Dilonardo showing off the weak points of a park they'd rather boast
about. On Friday, their guests included Rep. Robert Borski, D-Pa.
   ``It's a very strange position to be in because we all have a
great deal of pride and keep a great deal of pride in how well we
operated the park in the past,'' Goodman said.
   Borski and five other Philadelphia-area congressmen this week
appealed for help for the park in a letter to the regional director
of the Interior Department, James W. Coleman Jr., whose office is a
short walk from Independence Hall.
   Like other national historic parks across the country, the
Philadelphia park is federally funded via the National Parks
Service, which is part of the Interior Department.
   Borski said he expects Congress to respond when the problems are
publicized.
   ``The whole Congress was here just a few years ago to celebrate
the bicentennial of the Constitution,'' Borski said. ``All
Americans as well as all congressmen will want to see this place
maintained properly.''

<TEXT>
   RIYADH, Saudia Arabia (AP)_ The biggest U.S. military operation
since the Vietnam War is run out of a cramped room in a downtown
office building by a gregarious general called in from South
Carolina.
   ``Just what you thought for the commanding general, right?'' Lt.
Gen. Charles A. Horner said with a laugh as he pointed around
quarters about 12-by-20 feet.
   The sound of the Moslem call to prayer, which is piped into the
modern building, reverberates through the room.
   Horner, 53, head of U.S. Central Command Air Forces at Shaw Air
Force Base in Sumter, S.C., is a down-home fellow whose life has
been running at fast-forward since he was tapped to oversee
Operation Desert Shield.
   Horner hasn't ventured into the field yet, but he's hoping that
will change soon when Gen. Norman Schwazkopf arrives to assume the
helm. Schwazkopf is head of the central command, which is
responsible for U.S. forces from Pakistan to Kenya and is
headquartered at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Fla.
   In desert boots and regulation camouflage work pants and shirt,
Horner, a beefy, Davenport, Iowa, native, is indistinguishable from
his troops _ except for his authoritative tone, the three stars
pinned to his chest and a $3 watch with Arabic numerals.
   ``A gift from a mujahedeen,'' explains Horner, referring to the
fierce anti-communist rebels in Afghanistan.
   Horner arrived even before President Bush announced Aug. 8 that
U.S. forces would be deployed in Saudi Arabia. He accompanied
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney to plot the defense of the oil-rich
nation with King Fahd four days after Iraq invaded neighboring
Kuwait Aug. 2.
   When Cheney returned to the United States, Horner stayed behind
to start the wheels in motion for the arrival of more than 40,000
troops and 500,000 tons of materiel.
   ``Secretary Cheney looked at me and said, `Good Luck, Chuck,'
Horner recalled in an interview. ``I swallowed hard.''
   Since then it's been adreneline-charged, 15-to-18 hour days as
the decorated fighter pilot manages the most important assignment
of his career.
   His command post is in the capital about 200 miles from Dhahran,
the gulf city where most of the U.S. troops and materiel are
arriving.
   Logistics _ and dealing with Saudi officials _ are major
components of the job. Desert Shield is a cooperative venture with
the Saudis; the forces operate essentially as a joint command.
   U.S. military and diplomatic officials say the movement of
weapons, personnel and equipment has gone off without major
glitches.
   With more than 4,500 hours of flying time, including 41 combat
missions over North Vietnam, Horner is itching to get into the
cockpit of an F-15. ``I love to fly,'' he said.
   Horner has known and worked with the American-trained top Saudi
air force generals for years. He finds the Saudis bright,
energetic, hard-working _ and different.
   ``The toughest thing is you have to accommodate to their
customs,'' he said.
   They don't like to say ``no'' and would rather postpone a
decision than risk a confrontation, he says.
   ``You're charging and trying to get things done,'' while the
Saudis have a more indirect manner, he said.
   ``He's a gruff, take-charge kind of guy who is not taken to
flowery speech,'' said a Pentagon spokesman. ``He is not a timid
politician.''
   The hours are also a switch. Saudis take time off during the
heat of the day and often work until 1 a.m., with vital issues
raised late in the evening.
   Despite the challenges, Horner said even generals get a little
homesick. He misses his family. Horner's daughter is entering
college, and she wrote him several letters telling of her anxiety
about the choice of which sorority to pledge.
   Horner concludes an interview when his driver Col. Samir Turki,
whom Horner calls Sammy, summons him for a meeting.
   ``Tell the people we are in good hands,'' Turki says.

   World leaders gather this weekend to discuss
ways to counter hate, but the conference organizer, Nobel peace
laureate Elie Wiesel, wishes he had called the seminar earlier.
   ``I wonder if the conference had been held six months ago, if it
could have done something to avoid the problems we see now,''
Wiesel said Friday, referring specifically to the Persian Gulf
crisis and unrest in South Africa.
   The Romanian-born author and human rights activist said the
seminar, ``The Anatomy of Hate,'' which begins Sunday in Oslo, is
expected to draw about 70 delegates from 30 countries.
   South African anti-apartheid activist Nelson Mandela,
Czechoslovak President Vaclav Havel, French President Francois
Mitterrand and former President Jimmy Carter are scheduled to be
key speakers during the four-day meeting.
   Wiesel and the Norwegian Nobel Peace Prize committee sent out a
call last fall to statesmen, Nobel laureates, activists and
thinkers to meet in this small Scandinavian city to discuss the
problem of hate.
   At the time, Wiesel, a Nazi death camp survivor, said he feared
that new freedoms won by East bloc nations would cause smoldering
religious, ethnic and regional hatred to flare. He chose Oslo as
the conference site because it is the home of the Peace Prize,
which he won in 1986.
   ``Now in Europe the problem is hatred. Now in the Middle East
the problem is hatred ... There is no issue so timely as the issue
of hate,'' said the 61-year-old Boston University professor.
   Keynote speakers, including Mandela and Havel, will open
discussions on racism and regional hatred in Europe, the Middle
East and Africa in a search of ways to resolve conflicts through
dialogue and democracy.
   ``The moment the Iraq crisis exploded, I expected people to
cancel, but to our pleasure very few have,'' said Wiesel, a U.S.
citizen.
   ``And when I read of the killings in South Africa I thought he
(Mandela) was not coming. But he is coming anyway, and that is a
good sign,'' Wiesel said.
   Hundreds of blacks have been killed in fighting between rival
factions in South African townships recently. The violence prompted
the government Friday to impose a state of emergency in black
townships outside Johannesburg, giving police widespread powers to
detain people and take action to stop the violence.
   One of those taking part in the hate conference is Chai Ling, a
leader of last year's pro-democracy movement in Beijing.
   She was greeted with a standing ovation by Norwegian students
she addressed Friday. Ling spoke of the violent June 4, 1989
military crackdown on the Chinese students and said: ``Tanks can
crush student movements, but cannot crush love or respect between
people.''
   ``We still don't know what the meeting will do,'' Wiesel
admitted. A joint declaration may be issued, possibly suggesting
ways to counter hatred.
   Planners considered bringing together enemies in bitter
conflicts, such as Irish Catholics and Protestants, but Wiesel said
the idea was rejected. ``This is not a forum for those who hate.''

   Americans traveling in Europe this summer find the
purchasing power of the already weak U.S. dollar sapped even
further by the crisis in the Persian Gulf.
   From London to Athens, the dollar buys far less than it did a
year ago. Once-cheap destinations, bargain basements no longer, are
raising eyebrows and flattening pocketbooks.
   ``We sat in a sidewalk cafe yesterday and were shocked a small
beer cost $8,'' said Christopher Kirk, 42, of Seattle, who was
visiting Paris. ``Everybody's been asking us for $5 for a coffee
and roll for breakfast.''
   Poring over brochures at the Champs-Elysees tourist office, Kirk
and traveling companion Janet Stanford ruled out a shopping spree
for designer wear. Any fashions they take home will come from
mid-priced department stores.
   They number among tens of thousands of Americans visiting Europe
whose greenbacks have lost about 20 percent in value to benchmark
European currencies since this time last year.
   The gulf situation has pushed the U.S. currency even lower.
   A dollar bought 5.38 francs Aug. 1, the day before Iraq invaded
Kuwait. On Friday, it fetched 5.21 francs.
   Things are tough even in Greece, a haven for budget
holidaymakers.
   Mary Mandis of Fort Lee, N.J., couldn't understand ``why my
dollars are buying less drachmas at the bank when I thought Greece
was so cheap.''
   A Paris-based financial analyst said the dollar is weak for many
reasons: ``Slowdown in the U.S. economy, lower interest rates. More
people interested in Euro currencies.''
   The gulf situation added to the reasons for the slide. Higher
oil prices resulting from Iraq's takeover of Kuwait renewed the
threat of a U.S. recession, pushing the dollar down, the analyst
said.
   The Deutschmark grew mighty in the last year as investors saw
West Germany as the economic powerhouse of a bigger Europe, the
analyst said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The dollar is at a historic low against the mark, dropping from
about 1.75 marks to 1.54 in just two months. In Britain, the pound
is nearing the benchmark $2 level. In Italy, the dollar has plunged
to its lowest level against the lire since 1981.
   Just a few years ago, footsore Yanks saw Rome as crowded and
smoggy but a bargain for a well-cut suit or big meal.
   Today only the crowds and smog remain.
   ``We learned the first night,'' said Missy Prowell of Huntington
Beach, Calif., traveling with her husband, Court.
   ``We had a very nice dinner in a restaurant, but we had to pay
190,000 Italian lire (about $190),'' Mrs. Prowell said. ``That was
outrageous. Now we share dishes and split desserts.''
   Americans are also staying out of the clothing shops.
   ``I'd love to buy shoes,'' sighed Lydia Lavin, from Olean, N.Y.
``But I content myself with looking at them.''
   The potential oil shortage has boosted gasoline prices in Europe
as well as the United States. Touring English country lanes costs
5.8 cents more per liter of gasoline more than it did a month ago.
   ``We rented a car, and I thought gas prices were going up at
home,'' said Richard Ralston. ``I filled up a small Ford for $46.''
   Expatriate workers feel the pinch of the currency exchange rate,
and so do those who depend on their salaries paid in dollars.
   Like Harry Spittler, who hawks cuckoo clocks and nutcrackers to
an almost exclusively American clientele of GIs and tourists from
his gift shop in Kaiserslauten, West Germany.
   ``We are very much affected by this. Our business has gone down
almost 20 percent in the past month,'' Spittler said.
   ``Many Germans haven't realized the benefits they accrue from
the GIs over here. But now they're starting to see.''
   It's hard to tell if fewer Americans are visiting Europe. Most
tourist ministries don't analyze statistics until September.
   But Hartmut Emmich of the Reisedienst der Wirtschaft travel
office in Frankfurt feels that the low dollar hasn't changed travel
plans for many Americans.
   ``They booked these trips months ago. They have a set price when
they are booked and there haven't been many cancellations,'' Emmich
said. ``But it will certainly affect bookings for next year.''

<HEAD>Sheep Burned Alive, Veal Trucks Seized by Angry Farmers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CAEN, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Farmers hurt by foreign competition stopped
trucks carrying veal calves from Britain, two days after masked men
burned alive more than 200 imported sheep.
   The incidents in western France signaled a worsening situation
in a 2-month-old movement to keep out foreign animals that
livestock herders say undercut domestic prices.
   The farmers in Caen captured two veal trucks Friday morning and
drove them to the city hall before allowing the animals to be taken
to slaughterhouses.
   The protest was relatively peaceful compared to the incident
Wednesday at Thouars, in the Deux-Sevres region, where masked men
stopped an English truck carrying 440 sheep.
   After threatening the driver and a passenger, the men doused the
truck in gasoline and set it afire, killing 219 animals.
   Farmers' unions have demanded immediate relief from falling
prices. But Agriculture Minister Henri Nallet said Thursday that
the government does not have the millions of francs needed for an
all-encompassing bailout.

<TEXT>
   Lt. Gov. Martha Griffiths, who served in
Congress 20 years and was a force behind passage of the Equal
Rights Amendment, was dropped Friday from the 1990 gubernatorial
ticket by Gov. James Blanchard.
   Blanchard praised Griffiths as ``the premier stateswoman'' and
``a wonderful friend'' but said he asked her to step aside because
he no longer considers her ready to assume the governor's post at a
moment's notice.
   ``I've always tried to do what's right for the people of
Michigan,'' Blanchard told a news conference. He did not give a
reason for his decision and said a search was on for a new running
mate for the fall campaign against John Engler, the Republican
Senate majority leader.
   Griffiths was giving a speech in Ann Arbor at the University of
Michigan and was unavailable for comment, her office said.
   Griffiths, 78, ran with Blanchard in his successful campaigns of
1982 and 1986. Amid speculation she would not run again, Griffiths
surprised her boss on May 10 when she said she was ready for a
third term.
   As recently as Aug. 7, Blanchard told reporters, ``It's been a
great team, a successful team. I'd hate to break it up.''
   Griffiths served in the Michigan House from 1949 to 1952. Two
years later she entered Congress from Michigan's 17th District, and
she held the seat until her resignation in 1975.
   Her shining moment came when she got the 218 signatures from
House members needed to pull the Equal Rights Amendment out of
committee and onto the floor, clearing the way for its eventual
approval in 1972.
   The amendment eventually fell three states short of the 38
needed to ratify it in order to add it to the U.S. Constitution.
   A spokesman for Engler's campaign said the appearance that
Blanchard had dumped her off the ticket was potentially damaging.
   ``Democrats would probably have a stronger ticket if Martha
Griffiths booted Jim Blanchard off instead of the other way
around,'' said the spokesman, John Truscott.
   Blanchard declined to speculate on the political fall-out of the
move.
   ``If the decision that I have made were only based on how to win
the election, there would be no question of who I would choose to
share the ticket _ Lieutenant Governor Martha Griffiths,'' he said
in a prepared statement.
   The governor said he met with Griffiths last week to discuss the
matter, and advised her of his decision before he made the
announcement.
   The governor credited Griffiths with helping him win his first
gubernatorial campaign in 1982 and said the decision to remove her
from the ticket was ``one of the most personally trying and
difficult decisions I have ever had to make.''
   Griffiths became Michigan's first elected lieutenant governor
when she helped Blanchard beat Republican Richard Headlee.
   A native of Pierce City, Mo., Griffiths graduated from the
University of Missouri and the University of Michigan law school.

   The city threatened to prosecute a man because
his house failed to meet building-code regulations after being
damaged last month by an explosion at a chemical plant.
   The July 19 explosion at a BASF Corp. plant rocked George
Heard's house across the street, said Harvey Wilbekin, the city's
director of buildings and inspection. Of 271 buildings that were
inspected, only Heard's house was condemned, Wilbekin said.
   His department recently sent Heard a letter saying that if he
failed to bring the house up to minimum standards under
building-code regulations, he risked prosecution for a first-degree
misdemeanor. That carries a maximum penalty of six months in jail
and a $1,000 fine.
   ``It's the grossest kind of insensitivity. It is the worst
aspect of bureaucratic response,'' Heard's lawyer, David Altman,
said Friday. ``It is not at all appropriate for a government to
respond like this to a citizen who suffered from a disaster that
was not his fault.
   ``They treated Mr. Heard like a guy who let his house go to
disrepair, rather than a guy whose house was destroyed by an
explosion,'' Altman said.
   Wilbekin apologized after learning about the letter.
   ``The reason it was done was to alert the owner that he had a
serious condition,'' Wilbekin said. ``We do not intend to be
following up with any prosecution. We admit that it was not handled
as delicately as it should have been.''
   Investigators said the explosion, which killed two people,
occurred when a cloud of cleaning vapor solvent ignited at a
reactor in which chemicals are mixed and heated. The plant remains
closed.
   In a lawsuit filed against BASF earlier this week in Hamilton
County Common Pleas Court, Altman demanded that all residents whose
houses were damaged be reimbursed for all repair and temporary
relocation expenses.
   The company declined immediate comment on the lawsuit.
   Spokesman Charles Coe said BASF has received about 1,500
reimbursement claims and has settled about half of them, but did
not reveal how much has been paid out.

   The Chilean Supreme Court has forced a
private clinic to release a newborn baby it held 11 days as
collateral for a $1,000 unpaid medical bill.
   The Santiago daily La Tercera said the baby was handed to his
parents, Fernando Onetto and Elena Culell, on Wednesday after the
Supreme Court ruling.
   The Providencia Clinic, where the incident occurred, refused to
comment.
   The mother said she was initially told the bill would be $430,
according to the paper on Thursday. Eventually, however, she was
charged $1,000 and couldn't come up with the money immediately.
   ``The owner of the clinc had ordered that the baby should not be
handed to me until the entire bill was paid,'' she told La Tercera.
   The court ruling ordered the baby's release but the final result
of the pay dispute was not reported.

<HEAD>Bush Recommends Small Pay Raise for Federal Employees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KENNEBUNKPORT, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush is recommending a 3.5
percent pay raise on Jan. 1 for federal employees.
   That is only a small fraction of the 22 percent to 40 percent
increases that Bush's pay advisers recommended to keep pace with
salaries in the private sector.
   But in a letter Friday to leaders of Congress sent from his
vacation home, Bush said, ``Pay raises of this magnitude are
clearly unacceptable.''
   Bush's plan would boost the top salaries among senior government
executives to $108,300.
   The lowest-paid job on the civil service pay rung would pay
$10,951 a year. The highest salary on grade 18 of the civil service
scale would be $96,756.
   Members of the president's Senior Executive Service would get
salaries ranging from $87,000 to $108,300.
   The pay scale for the foreign service would range up to $79,675.
   The White House also released a separate scale for health
officials in the Department of Veterans Affairs, with a top scale
of $104,085 for the deputy chief medical director.

<TEXT>
   OPEC is reeling from the sharp blow
delivered by the Persian Gulf crisis, which has badly crippled the
cartel's ability to exert control over oil pricing and production.
   ``For the moment, it's an irrelevant organization,'' said Bryan
Jacoboski, a vice president at Paine Webber brokerage in New York.
``Everything occurring in the oil markets is outside of OPEC's
influence.''
   The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries was thrown
into one of its worst crises when the unthinkable happened: one of
its members invaded and annexed another in a dispute over oil, land
and money.
   Years of effort to polish the group's image as a reliable
business organization appear to have ended in failure.
   ``At this point, the organization has very little credibility,''
said Peter Bogin, associate director for oil markets at Cambridge
Energy Research Associates in Paris. ``The future of the crisis
will determine the future of OPEC.''
   Since Iraq seized Kuwait on Aug. 2, OPEC has chosen, despite
pleas from Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, not to hold an emergency
meeting to discuss the turbulent situation in the oil markets.
   At least seven of the 13 member nations have agreed to talk
informally in Vienna on Sunday, but Saudi Arabia's influential oil
minister, Hisham Nazer, may not show up. Iraq and Kuwait also were
expected to stay away.
   Without going into a formal session, there is little the
ministers can do to try to calm the jittery markets.
   Crude prices, lifted by fears of military escalation in the gulf
and cutbacks in oil supplies, have spiraled above $30 a barrel, a
level untouched since the mid-1980s.
   ``OPEC is not really a feature in the fundamentals of this
(price) move,'' said Peter Gignoux, director of the international
energy department at Shearson Lehman Hutton in London.
   Last month, the cartel agreed to restrain production at 22.5
million barrels a day in the last half of the year in an effort to
drive prices up to a new target of $21 a barrel. The benchmark was
reached _ and exceeded _ almost immediately.
   An international embargo on Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil has meant a
loss of about 4 million barrels of crude a day to the world markets.
   Saudi Arabia, which holds about a quarter of the world's oil
reserves, has said it intends to increase crude pumping by as much
as 2 million barrels a day, with or without OPEC's blessing.
   But analysts say the kingdom would like the cartel's nod to go
over its newly set supply quota of 5.4 million barrels a day.
   ``It would be better for Saudi Arabia and the organization as a
whole to have it done under the umbrella of OPEC rather than as a
unilateral action,'' said Bahman Karbassioun, an oil consultant in
Vienna. ``No one likes unilateral action.''
   Some see the organization divided into two camps _ those who
want much higher prices and those who don't. ``There's a terrific
battle between the OPEC `hawks' and `doves','' said Gignoux.
   Iran, considered a hawk on prices, has said there is enough oil
in storage in the industrialized world to make up for the loss of
Iraqi and Kuwaiti crude.
   Some of the smaller members, with less capacity to produce oil,
also may be delighted by the surge in prices, bringing a windfall
to their governments' coffers.
   Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates
have been considered among the price doves or moderates, who worry
about the effects of sharp price swings on the world economy.
   Despite the cartel's hesitation to act over the Iraqi invasion,
analysts say it would be foolish to write its obituary.
   ``Calling OPEC dead is a little bit premature,'' said Bogin.
``They've come back from a lot.''
   The cartel has weathered other crises in just the past decade.
   The 1979 revolution in Iran, a major oil-producing nation, was
marked by a sharp drop in crude production. World oil prices
soared, almost hitting the $40 mark and sending the world economy
into a tailspin.
   In the mid-1980s, a production free-for-all sent oil prices
crashing, and the organization was near collapse.
   Throughout most of the 1980s, Iran and Iraq were at war, which
ended in a cease-fire two years ago.
   Referring to the present crisis, Bogin said that if the Iraqi
leadership is replaced by a more moderate one friendly to the West,
``OPEC again can play a role in the oil world.''
   But if Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's military might prevails
in the high-stakes contest, he said, ``OPEC will be spelled
I-r-a-q.''

<HEAD>After-Tax Corporate Profits Down</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The newest report on corporate America's
performance gives further evidence of an overall weak economy,
analysts say.
   The assessment came Friday after the Commerce Department
reported that corporate profits in the second quarter of this year
dropped 0.2 percent from a year ago. The quarter began in April and
ended in June.
   The decline is the first since a 5.9 percent drop in after-tax
profits in 1989's third quarter, July-September, the Commerce
Department reported.
   Profits rose 1.7 percent in the final quarter of 1989, followed
by a 0.5 percent increase in the first quarter of this year.
   The government also reported Friday that the gross national
product for the second quarter expanded at a lackluster rate of
just 1.2 percent.
   Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co., said the profit
picture is likely to worsen in coming months, especially if the
country enters a recession.
   While profits normally drop between 15 percent and 20 percent in
the typical recession, Sinai said he was looking for only about a 5
percent drop in profits next year because he expects that any
downturn will be a mild one.
   Even analysts who are not yet forecasting a recession are
looking for corporate profits to remain soft in coming quarters.
   ``Although oil companies are likely to have bigger profits in
the second half of the year because of higher oil prices, that will
be offset by a weaker showing in other sectors,'' said Bruce
Steinberg, an economist at Merrill Lynch.
   After-tax profits totaled $166.7 billion at an annual rate in
the second quarter. The decline from the first quarter reflected in
part weak earnings in the transportation and public utilities
sectors.
   Among the details of the profits report:
   _Before-tax profits, which totaled $297.6 billion at an annual
rate in the second quarter, were up a slight 0.2 percent from the
first quarter. Before-tax profits had risen 2.4 percent in the
first quarter.
   _Corporate profits, after adjusting for depreciation and
inventories, climbed 3.3 percent in the second quarter to an annual
level of $306.5 billion. They had been up 2 percent in the first
quarter.
   _Corporate cash flows, a measurement intended to show the funds
corporations have for investment, rose 2.3 percent in the second
quarter to an annual rate of $402.3 billion, after falling 0.7
percent in the first quarter.
   Dividend payments to stockholders increased 2.1 percent to an
annual rate of $133 billion in the second quarter after increasing
2 percent in the first quarter.

<HEAD>Performance Artists Lose Appeal To NEA</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lawyers for four ``performance artists'' who
were denied federal grants say they will take the National
Endowment for the Arts to court for making what they call a
political decision that violates the First Amendment.
   The lawyers from the Center for Constitutional Rights said a
federal court case is the only option because the NEA on Friday
rejected an appeal of its decision in June to turn down the grant
applications.
   ``As in its initial denial letters, the NEA gives no substantive
reasons for the denials,'' the non-profit center said in a
statement from its New York headquarters.
   The four performers in question are Karen Finley and Holly
Hughes of New York, and Tim Miller and John Fleck of Los Angeles.
Their solo stage acts consist of songs and monologues on such
themes as sexual oppression, politics and racism. The acts
sometimes include explicit sexual content.
   NEA critics had cited the four as examples of the endowment's
willingness to subsidize works that might be considered obscene.
   The performers' applications for federal grants were approved
last spring by an NEA ``peer review'' panel. But NEA Chairman John
E. Frohnmayer vetoed them on June 29, with the concurrence of the
26-member National Council on the Arts, the endowment's
presidentially appointed advisory body.
   At a fund-raising party in Washington for local artists'
organizations, Ms. Hughes and Miller said they were disappointed
but not surprised by Frohnmayer's decision to deny the four grants,
which Ms. Hughes said totaled about $23,000.
   ``I think it's really clear that Frohnmayer is going ahead with
the idea of presenting us as sacrificial lambs to Congress so he
can ask for more money for the NEA ... to perpetuate safe, dead
artists,'' Ms. Hughes said.
   ``Now it's a matter for the courts and the constitutional
lawyers,'' Miller said. Fleck could not be reached for comment.
   In response to repeated telephone calls, an NEA spokeswoman said
she could not confirm the report and had no comment. Frohnmayer was
vacationing and could not be reached by telephone.
   Although Frohnmayer gave no reasons for rejecting the artists'
applications or their appeals, he warned a meeting of arts
professionals in Seattle in June that ``political realities'' made
it likely he would have to veto some grants recommended by NEA
panels of artists.
   Two days later, he rejected the grant requests by the four
performance artists. Each had received NEA grants in the past.
   Frohnmayer apparently was referring to growing criticism from
religious fundamentalists and conservative members of Congress led
by Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C. They have complained that the arts
endowment uses taxpayer dollars to subsidize obscene and
sacrilegious works.
   Last October, at Helms' urging, Congress amended the NEA's
current $171 million budget to prohibit use of federal funds for
any works that ``may be deemed obscene,'' including depictions of
homoeroticism, sadomasochism, sexual exploitation of children and
``individuals engaged in sex acts.''
   Although Frohnmayer has said repeatedly that he opposes the
Helms statute as unnecessary, he is requiring all NEA grant
recipients to sign a pledge that they will not use federal funds to
produce obscene art.
   The pledge has provoked widespread protests in the arts
community, and the advisory council voted overwhelmingly in early
August to recommend that Frohnmayer eliminate the requirement.
   The NEA chairman said recently he will keep the anti-obscenity
pledge until a federal judge in New York rules _ possibly within a
month _ on a lawsuit challenging it as unconstitutional.

   Operation PUSH says it will keep urging a
black boycott of Nike after a three-hour meeting with executives of
the sports shoe company produced no promise of a comprehensive
affirmative action program.
   The meeting Friday was ``congenial, amiable,'' PUSH founder
Jesse Jackson said afterward. But he said Nike executives showed no
willingness to yield to the black self-help group's demands for
more minority representation in the company.
   Nike officials and Georgetown University basketball coach John
Thompson, who has an endorsement contract with Nike, said progress
had been made in the talks. But they declined to predict how the
conflict will be resolved.
   ``Obviously, we're encouraged,'' said Nike President Richard K.
Donahue. ``If this meeting had taken place first, there never would
have been a boycott.''
   Chicago-based PUSH says Nike uses black athletes to advertise
its expensive shoes among black youths yet has no minorities on its
board of directors and does not advertise in black-owned media
outlets.
   Nike released an affirmative action hiring plan last week in
response to the boycott, promising to appoint a black to its board
within 24 months.
   But after Friday's meeting, Jackson suggested he was
dissatisfied with that offer as well.
   ``John Thompson is eminently qualified to be on that board
immediately,'' Jackson said.
   The two sides agreed Friday to provide each other basic
information about their organizations, and Jackson said that Nike
seemed ``obsessed'' with learning whether PUSH has any contractual
agreements with Reebok. Nike has accused PUSH of conspiring with
Reebok, a chief Nike competitor.
   Jackson denied any connection between PUSH and Nike's rival.
   The civil rights leader also complained that Nike had failed to
provide details on the exact job duties of the minorities who make
up 14 percent of its 3,000-member work force.
   ``We suspect that the majority of them are on the bottom,''
Jackson said.
   PUSH, which has launched successful boycotts against a
half-dozen other corporations, has been urging consumers to stop
buying Nike products or to cover the Nike emblem on the goods they
already own.
   Tyrone Crider, president of PUSH, said he will travel to
different cities in the next week in hopes of expanding the boycott.
   Jackson and the Nike officials said they would not set a date
for future meetings until each side has assessed information
provided by the other.
   ``I expect it would be a week .. or 10 days'' before that
happens, Donahue said.

   U.S. air power in the Persian Gulf,
ranging from radar-evading Stealth fighters to carpet-bombing
B-52s, will be decisive in any fighting with Iraq, military
analysts say.
   The Americans' technological superiority give its pilots a
critical edge over Iraq's war-seasoned veterans, they say.
   The United States, backed by Britain, has built up an awesome
strike capability in the weeks since the Iraqi army invaded Kuwait
on Aug. 2.
   As of Friday, the Americans and their allies had an estimated
700 combat aircraft in the region. The Iraqi air force has about
500 planes.
   ``Air power alone cannot win wars. But the strength of U.S. and
British air forces in the gulf, and their electronic and
technological capability, is enough to be extremely effective in
any conflict,'' said Don Kerr of London's International Institute
for Strategic Studies.
   Allied air power ``can give the Iraqis a very hard time, in the
air as well as against strategic targets and Iraq's tank
formations,'' he said in an interview.
   ``But more significantly, they can carry out long-range
penetration inside Iraq to hit lines of communication and supply
beyond Kuwait,'' he said.
   The Iraqis fought Iran for eight years and most of their pilots,
known as ``eagle warriors,'' have combat experience.
   But for most of the 1980-88 war, they were up against a
seriously depleted Iranian air force, weakened more by shortages of
spare parts than combat losses.
   They became adept at blasting attacking Iranian ground forces
and mounting long-range raids on Iranian oil terminals in the
southern gulf.
   Dogfights were rare, so they have little experience with
air-to-air combat.
   ``They also never had to contend with the kind of operations the
Americans and British can carry out and they're not very
experienced in electronic warfare,'' Kerr said. ``They'll have a
lot of difficulties.''
   Strategic bombing offensives against Iranian industry were never
sustained long enough to do lasting damage.
   Most of Iraq's pilots are not considered high quality by Western
analysts. But they have a core of top guns flying Soviet-made
MiG-29s and some French-made Mirage F-1s, the best jets in Saddam's
arsenal.
   Superiority in the air is vital, because the United States is
outnumbered and outgunned on the ground.
   The Iraqis have an estimated 200,000 troops and 1,000 tanks in
Kuwait. They have another 3,500 tanks in Iraq.
   The Americans have about 40,000 men with light armored vehicles
in place, backed by Arab forces. These include Saudi Arabia's 450
battle tanks.
   Some analysts deem allied air power, augmented by the army's
anti-tank missiles and tank-killing Apache AH-64 helicopters,
sufficient to counter an Iraqi thrust south from occupied Kuwait.
   But they believe the United States won't be able to mount a
major offensive until it has built up its heavy armor.
   U.S. units and tanks are en route to Saudi Arabia. But it could
take weeks before the Americans have marshalled enough armor to
have a lethal punch.
   In the gulf region, the U.S. aircraft carriers Independence and
Saratoga have a combined air strength of more than 100 fighter
planes.
   The USS Dwight D. Eisenhower in the eastern Mediterranean has
more than 50 aircraft capable of hitting Iraq from the west.
   Two more carrier battle groups led by the USS John F. Kennedy
and the USS Midway are heading for the Middle East with 100 more
fighters.
   Britain's Royal Air Force has 12 Tornado F3 fighter-bombers in
Saudi Arabia and a squadron of Jaguar ground-attack jets in Oman.
   Backing them is the Saudi air force's nearly 200 combat
aircraft, with another 150 from other gulf states.
   Kuwaiti pilots got most of their 36 fighters to Saudi Arabia
before the Iraqis overran the emirate.
   U.S. F-16s, deployed in the gulf area, are considered more than
a match for Iraq's Mirages and MiG-29s.
   Most of Iraq's air force is composed of older Soviet-built
fighter planes.
   Moscow is reported to have recently supplied Baghdad with
long-range Su-24 fighter-bombers, which could pose a threat. But
analysts believe the U.S. and British pilots can handle the planes.

<HEAD>Cheney Cuts Helicopter Program to Save $7.8 Billion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney says his
decision to cut in half the number of planned purchases of a new
generation helicopter for the Army will save close to $8 billion
over the long run.
   The Army will buy 1,292 of the attack and reconnaissance
helicopters, which are still on the drawing board, instead of the
previously planned 2,096, Cheney said Friday. The yearly rate of
production will be 120 instead of 216.
   The change will cut the program's total cost to $34.2 billion
from the originally projected $42 billion, the Army said. But it
will increase the cost of each helicopter produced because the
research and development costs will be spread among fewer aircraft.
   The Army said each helicopter is expected to cost $8.9 million,
up from the previous estimate of $7.5 million.
   Cheney said the demonstration phase of the program will be
extended by two years to allow for full testing of a prototype.
   Two corporate teams are competing for the production contract.
One is comprised of McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Co. of Mesa,
Ariz., and Bell Helicopter Textron of Fort Worth, Texas. The other
is Boeing Helicopters of Philadelphia and Sikorsky Aircraft Co. of
Stratford, Conn.
   A McDonnell Douglas spokesman said the company views Cheney's
announcement to build a prototype as a positive step in the
development of the helicopter.
   ``It is an endorsement that the LH (light helicopter) concept is
the best solution for the Army's next generation of reconnaissance,
armed helicopters,'' said spokesman Ken Jensen. ``We have suggested
that the prototype would be the next logical step,''
   A single contracting team for full-scale development of the
helicopter is to be chosen next February.
   ``I am convinced that the Light Helicopter is essential to our
long-term strategy of meeting worldwide requirements with a
smaller, lighter Army force structure,'' Cheney said in a prepared
statement after a department review of the program.
   The new helicopter is designed to perform reconnaissance at
night, in adverse weather conditions, at high altitudes and in hot
climates, the Pentagon said.
   The Bush administration's budget request for the 1991 fiscal
year that begins Oct. 1 includes $465 million for research,
development, testing and evaluation of the new-generation
helicopter, but Congress is expected to approved a smaller total.

   Hawaii and Nevada have topped the 1-million
population mark, according to the Census Bureau, which is issuing
preliminary 1990 counts for 11 states.
   While 10 of the states showed population gains in data released
Friday, Ohio recorded a decline from the 1980 national head count.
   The bureau said that it had counted 10,777,514 people in Ohio,
down from 10,798,000 in 1980.
   Officials stressed that the reports are preliminary. They are
designed to give local officials a chance to raise questions if
they find areas where they believe people have been missed or
overcounted.
   The final, official, census counts are scheduled for release on
Dec. 31.
   Friday's report brings to 40 the number of states for which
preliminary counts have been published. The rest are expected in
the next week or two.
   Newly released state counts, and the census count in 1980 are:
   _Alaska, 545,774, up from 402,000.
   _Arizona, 3,619,064, up from 2,718,000.
   _Colorado, 3,272,460, up from 2,890,000.

   Communist China has turned Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait into a badly needed public relations coup by helping
stranded ethnic Chinese from Hong Kong and Taiwan flee the Middle
East.
   ``Beijing has done beautifully,'' read an editorial by Ming Pao,
an independent Hong Kong daily that often criticizes Beijing.
``Without much effort, it saved a group of fellow Chinese and won
the approval of Taiwanese and overseas Chinese.''
   So far, China has helped 159 ethnic Chinese from Taiwan and Hong
Kong leave Kuwait and Iraq following Baghdad's Aug. 2 invasion of
its oil-rich neighbor.
   Taiwanese had difficulty returning home because their government
doesn't have diplomatic relations with Kuwait or Iraq, which both
recognize China. Hong Kong residents had problems because they
carry Hong Kong-British passports, which made them British citizens
in the eyes of the invading Iraqis.
   Iraq has refused to allow most of the estimated 21,000
Westerners leave Iraq and Kuwait, including about 3,000 Americans.
   China apparently easily persuaded Iraq to free its
``compatriots,'' as Beijing's official Xinhua News Agency refers to
ethnic Chinese. At least until the invasion, China has been one of
Iraq's top arms suppliers and has maintained close economic and
military ties with Baghdad.
   The episode is ironic because Beijing has technically been at
war with Nationalist Taiwan since 1949 when Chinese Communist
troops forced the Nationalists from mainland China.
   And few people in Hong Kong have any love for the Communist
government, especially since June 4, 1989, when China crushed a
student-led movement for freedom in Beijing in which hundreds,
perhaps thousands died.
   More than 1,000 people emigrate from the British colony each
week, having lost faith in China's promise to maintain the
freewheeling economic and social system for 50 years after 1997,
when Beijing resumes control of the territory.
   In Hong Kong, the episode gave China badly needed good press. In
Taiwan, prestigious political analyst Chiou Hung-ta warned of a
``potential danger'' of people losing confidence in the Nationalist
government if China continues to successfully employ such tactics
to win the hearts of Taiwanese.
   One Western diplomat said China's quick response to requests for
help in the gulf was aimed at convincing the people of Taiwan and
Hong Kong they ultimately must recognize Beijing as their capital.
   China's two main foreign policy questions in the 1990s will be
its upcoming takeover of jittery Hong Kong and its hopes to
re-unite with Taiwan. Beijing has yet to abandon its threat to
attack Taiwan in order to force unification.
   ``The Chinese are saying, `When the chips are down, you've got
to admit that Beijing is the boss,''' the diplomat said on
condition of anonymity.
   In Beijing, a Foreign Ministry spokesman offered an explanation
to illustrate Chinese thinking on the issue: ``The people on the
two sides of the Taiwan Straits are all Chinese. Naturally, we
should offer assistance within our capacity to our Taiwanese
compatriots who have run into difficulties in other countries.''
   The type of assistance China provided also won it praise. The
Chinese Embassy issued Taiwanese travel permits and not passports,
avoiding the sticky question of forcing the Taiwanese to accept
Chinese citizenship.
   The episode in the gulf highlights what many Chinese
intellectuals call ``the crisis of Chinese identity.''
   ``We all consider ourselves Chinese but the crisis comes when we
have to choose a government to represent us,'' said Joseph Y.S.
Cheng, a leading educator in Hong Kong.
   For thousands of years, Chinese have considered themselves
united as a people not because they shared a capital, but because
they shared a common culture, rooted in a common written language.
   The events in the gulf ``rang a bell with almost all Chinese
intellectuals,'' Cheng said.
   ``We realize that we can't just be culturally Chinese,'' he
said. ``We must also belong to a political group. For many of us,
the time for choosing is now and the choices are few.''

   Madison Avenue hypesters have seldom been shy
about waving the flag to boost sales. But commercial-makers have so
far stayed away from ads tied to the U.S. military effort in the
Saudi desert.
   Advertising experts say they don't expect many will try _ at
least as long as there is a chance the Persian Gulf could explode
into war.
   ``Companies tend to jump on things that they know have no
enormous downside _ things like the Wall coming down in Berlin,''
said Jack Trout, a marketing consultant.
   The Persian Gulf has a big downside, Trout said. The region
could erupt into all-out war, exposing any effort to draw a
connection with the troops as crass commercialization.
   Short of that, he said a campaign tied to the gulf could
antagonize Americans who are opposed to U.S. involvement there.
   ``Marketers want to deal with 100 percent,'' Trout said. ``They
don't want to be associated with an event that still has a negative
potential with a piece of their marketplace.''
   Dave Hudgens, a spokesman for Chevrolet, said the automaker has
no plans to run commercials tied to the Gulf. ``That is too
volatile a situation to try and capitalize on it in a commercial
way,'' he said.
   Burger King Corp. and Coca-Cola Co. each said they had no plans
for Gulf-related ads.
   Stephen A. Greyser, professor of consumer marketing at the
Harvard Business School, recalled that in the aftermath of the
Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan in the late 1970s, some
vodka makers developed marketing campaigns that exploited
anti-Soviet sentiment to lure drinkers away from Russian vodka.
   During World War I, he said U.S. vendors of sauerkraut began
calling their product Liberty Cabbage to avoid any possible
connection with the German enemy.
   But Greyser said there are no products sold here that are so
clearly associated with Iraq to inspire any similar
counter-marketing efforts. Iraqi troops invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   But what about companies that may be providing products American
troops are using to do their jobs?
   Quaker Oats Co., for instance, supplies the drink Gatorade to
military bases, and it announced Thursday that it had ``stepped up
its efforts to supply the U.S. armed forces'' for use in the desert
in Saudi Arabia.
   Spokesman Ronald Bottrell said the company had shipped more than
20,000 cases of the drink for use by troops in Saudi Arabia and had
orders for 100,000 more cases.
   But aside from announcing the order, Bottrell said the
Chicago-based company had no plans to tout it in advertising. ``Our
feeling this week was not to hype this,'' he said.
   So why put out in a news release to the media?
   Bottrell said he issued it only after receiving about a dozen
calls from reporters who were writing stories about supplying the
troops.
   ``We felt we wanted to get on the record,'' he said.
   Harvard's Greyser said the public would accept advertising that
makes a connection between a product and the Persian Gulf crisis if
there was ``a legitimate connection'' between the product's
performance, its use in a desert setting and its use in civilian
life.

   Magellan engineers tried to recover
today from an emotional roller-coaster ride after the unruly
spaceship gave them great pictures of Venus and ``moments of terror
and of great happiness.''
   ``We've got to get the team rested,'' Magellan project manager
Tony Spear told a news conference Friday at NASA's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory.
   Magellan was launched from the shuttle Atlantis on May 4, 1989.
It started orbiting Venus Aug. 10 on a $744 million radar-mapping
mission to make the best pictures and maps yet of the cloud-covered
planet.
   The spacecraft returned its first pictures of Venus last week.
New pictures released Friday, including a spectacular
three-dimensional image, show a 20-mile-wide meteorite impact
crater with a floor covered by lava flows.
   Science and mission planning manager Tommy Thompson said
engineers and scientists felt ``a little strung out'' after the
spacecraft malfunctioned and lost contact with Earth twice: first
for 14 hours starting Aug. 16, then for 17{ hair-raising hours
beginning Tuesday night.
   ``It's kind of like having a date for the prom, stubbing your
toe the night before, getting up the next morning and stubbing a
toe on the other foot,'' Thompson said.
   While Magellan mission control is staffed around the clock, many
other team members were resting this weekend, he said.
   Until engineers identify and fix the problem that cut the radio
link, ``I think it's likely to happen again,'' Spear said earlier
Friday.
   If contact is lost again, engineers are ready with new computer
commands to ``kick start'' Magellan's automatic safety systems and
make the spacecraft re-establish contact with Earth immediately,
Spear said.
   ``My heart can't stand this 17-hour loss of signal'' again, he
said. ``There are moments of terror and of great happiness after we
recovered the signal.''
   The emotional wear-and-tear showed a bit Friday as National
Aeronautics and Space Administration officials contradicted each
other on one possible explanation for the communication problems.
   During the news conference, spacecraft system engineer John
Slonski said the braking rocket Magellan used to slow down and go
into orbit around Venus might have failed to separate fully, or
might have burned some cables as it was jettisoned.
   ``It's a possibility we're investigating that the solid rocket
motor really hasn't gone away _ that it's still hanging on'' and
bumping into Magellan, Slonski said.
   Spear called that possibility remote and contrary to available
evidence, but also said it was conceivable the rocket yanked out
some cables on Magellan as it separated from the spacecraft.
   Two hours later, the laboratory's public relations office issued
a statement saying there was ``currently no doubt the separation
was complete.'' Spokesmen refused to elaborate when asked to
explain the contradiction between that statement and those made by
Slonski.
   Even if the rocket had not completely separated, it wouldn't
prevent Magellan from conducting its mission, Spear said. The
official mapping effort is likely to start no earlier than
mid-September, two weeks later than planned, he said.
   Engineers also were considering the possibility the
communications failures were caused by problems with Magellan's
computer hardware or programs, or the unlikely chance Magellan is
being affected by previously unknown electrical fields around Venus.
   One of the biggest joys was that Magellan's first pictures of
Venus, made during an Aug. 16 radar test, lived up to NASA's
promise of being 10 times more detailed than the best obtained from
radar on Earth or from the Soviet Venera 15 and 16 spacecraft in
the mid-1980s.
   The meteorite impact crater shown in pictures released Friday
has a very smooth floor and a central peak. The smooth floor
indicates the crater was flooded by volcanic lava, either during or
sometime after the impact, said Steve Saunders, Magellan's chief
scientist.
   He said the crater is relatively young geologically, 100 million
to 150 million years old. It is named after Soviet sculptor Anna
Golubkina, who lived from 1864 to 1927.
   Other pictures from Magellan showed intense ``Venusquake''
faulting, lava flows and a network of intersecting ridges and
valleys.

<HEAD>South African Police Face Tough Odds in Township War</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG MYRE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>KAGISO, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police face a shortage of both
manpower and credibility as they confront black factional fighting
in the townships ringing Johannesburg that has claimed more than
500 lives.
   In many instances, only a handful of police have been present to
prevent battles between hundreds of angry Zulus and Xhosas, warring
since Aug. 12.
   Also, many township residents view the police as an enemy rather
than a protector. They accuse police of bias and even active
participation in the bloodletting.
   ``We have evidence that there are elements in the police force
that seem to be interested in the violence spreading,'' said Pallo
Jordan, a spokesman for the African National Congress, the
country's leading black opposition movement.
   Police emphatically deny the charges, and many neutral observers
believe the police have been far more restrained than in recent
years. A four-year national state of emergency lifted in June had
given police extensive powers, and officers routinely used force to
break up even peaceful demonstrations.
   ``The suggestion that police either disarm or tear gas certain
sectors of the community in order to facilitate Inkatha attacks ...
is unfounded,'' said Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok.
   The government acknowledges it needs more police and is adding
10,000 policeman to the 70,000-strong national force, responsible
for a vast country with a population of 30 million people.
   Some accusations of police bias appear based on anger that
police won't let the two sides fight it out. Other blacks point
fingers because officers won't side with them against their
opponents.
   Policemen are often the most visible symbol of white authority
in black townships, and there is inevitably suspicion of their
actions.
   Many township residents say police favor Zulus, tied to the
conservative Inkatha political movement, in their township battles
against mostly Xhosas who back the ANC.
   In Kagiso, a hard-hit township west of Johannesburg, residents
said police simply stood watch at night as Zulus attacked homes
with stones, gasoline bombs and guns then took money, televisions
and radios from the unarmed residents.
   ``The police do nothing to stop the Zulus,'' said one Kagiso
resident who gave his name only as Joe. ``We call the police, but
they do not respond.''
   Associated Press reporters saw several uniformed black municipal
police officers fighting alongside the Zulus in Kagiso. Other Zulus
said the officers were Zulus living in hostels and were defending
themselves.
   Municipal police work for particular townships and are distinct
from the national police who have borne the brunt of the fighting.
   But regular police in Kagiso reacted swiftly on several
occasions Thursday to intervene between Zulus living in a migrant
workers hostel and township residents who said they wanted to
destroy the hostel.
   Police fired tear gas at both sides to prevent clashes between
heavily armed gangs. When residents could not reach the hostel,
they threw gasoline bombs and stones at police. Police responded
with more tear gas. Several residents were hurt and others were
arrested.

   Connie Chung got booed and hissed in absentia
when she sent a videotaped apology to a journalists' convention
where she was to have given the keynote address.
   The 44-year-old Chung last month put her CBS-TV series, ``Face
to Face With Connie Chung,'' on hold, saying she wanted to try to
have a baby.
   In a videotape screened Friday before the Asian American
Journalists Association, she made no mention of why she couldn't
attend, other than to say, ``It was very important for me to be
here.'' Some in the audience showed their displeasure.
   ``I wish I could be there with you,'' Chung said. ``If I could
have been, I would have been.''

   Milton Berle has an illegitimate son he
sometimes runs into at Hollywood parties, but the comedian has
never disclosed their relationship, an associate confirmed.
   ``My son always comes up to me and says, `Hello, Milton. How are
you?' Little does he know he's talking to his father,''' the
National Enquirer quoted Berle as saying in its Sept. 4 issue.
   Michael Bass, producer of a television special Berle is
preparing on his 75 years in show business, said Friday the
Enquirer's story is accurate.
   Berle, 82, says his 51-year-old son was born to an actress he
met at the Beverly Hills Hotel. ``It was very early in our careers
and neither of us was looking for any long-term involvement,'' he
said.
   He refuses to tell his son the truth ``because his mother is
still alive, and I keep silent out of respect for her. I want to
wait until she dies.'' He did not identify her.
   ``I dream of him many a night,'' Berle said. ``And in those
dreams I tell him. In case I die without ever telling him, he's
taken care of in my will.''
   Berle has married twice and has four children.

   Mayor Sidney Barthelemy says he'll swim in a
tankful of sharks after losing a bet that New Orleans' Aquarium of
the Americas wouldn't open on schedule on Labor Day weekend.
   ``I know it's risky, but this represents my commitment to the
City of New Orleans,'' Barthelemy said Friday. ``If I have to swim
with the sharks to prove my commitment, I will.''
   Barthelemy said he'd pay on Tuesday the bet he made with Ron
Forman, the aquarium's executive director, that the $40 million
aquarium wouldn't be completed by its Sept. 1 deadline.
   The aquarium will have more than 10,000 aquatic specimens _
including 30 sharks and a 14-foot sawfish in the Gulf of Mexico
exhibit that Barthelemy said he'll swim in.

   A bugged Gov. Jim Florio sent a biting
letter to a Bahamas-based hotel and casino that advises gamblers to
steer clear of rival casinos in Atlantic City because the mosquito
is ``New Jersey's state bird.''
   Christopher Raphael, senior vice president in charge of The
Carnival Crystal Palace's casino in Nassau, said its print
advertisements were ``only in good fun'' and that Florio was
overreacting.
   The ads say that while the islands' ``gentle trade winds keep
our summer so cool and breezy,'' gamblers in Atlantic City have to
endure hot summers.
   ``It's muggy out there,'' the ads say. ``That's why they've made
the mosquito New Jersey's state bird.''
   Florio said the ads pestered him, so he fired off a letter to
the casino expressing disappointment with the campaign.
   ``Millions of people from around the world choose to come to the
Jersey shore every year because it's fun, it's clean, it's
inexpensive and, may I add, largely free of mosquitoes,'' Florio
wrote.

   Iraqi soldiers sealed off the U.S. and at
least eight other embassies in Kuwait on Friday, and Baghdad
threatened to forcibly remove any diplomats whose governments
defied orders to close their missions.
   U.S. Ambassador Nathaniel Howell and a skeleton staff of about
10 remained at the palm-fringed U.S. compound near the Persian Gulf
coast.
   Richard Boucher, a State Department spokesman, said Howell and
his staff would stay, keeping in touch with the 2,500 Americans
trapped in Kuwait ``as much as circumstances allow.'' They were
keeping telephone conversations short because Iraqis were listening
in, Boucher said in Washington.
   In Amman, Jordan, a Spanish diplomat said Baghdad had threatened
to use force to remove diplomats remaining at their posts in Kuwait
city on Saturday.
   Electricity and water were cut to the British and Greek
embassies, officials in those countries said. West Germany's
foreign ministry said the Iraqis had warned embassies they would
take such action if they do not close.
   In London, a Foreign Office spokesman said later that Iraqi
tanks had moved into position to back up troops outside the British
Embassy in Kuwait, where Ambassador Michaely Weston and three staff
members remained.
   ``The ambassador and his staff are in good heart and, the last
time we heard from them, they were drinking champagne by
candlelight,'' said the spokesman, who cannot be identified under
briefing rules.
   The spokesman said the embassy staff had stocked up food
supplies in case the Iraqis tried to starve them out.
   Britain's foreign secretary, Douglas Hurd, said his embassy's
staff would decide for themselves how to oppose any Iraqi move on
the mission.
   ``I don't expect, no one expects, unarmed diplomats to give
physical resistance to physical force,'' he said.
   About a dozen Iraqi soldiers surrounded the Canadian Embassy in
Kuwait, preventing individuals from entering or leaving the mission.
   In Gaspe, Quebec, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said Iraq ``is
well on the way to becoming ... a pariah nation.''
   More than 100 U.S. embassy personnel and dependents, including
the Marine guards, left the U.S. embassy in Kuwait on Thursday and
were staying in the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, said White House
spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   Fitzwater said the Iraqis had promised earlier to allow the
group to leave Iraq, then reneged. He said Iraqi forces ``of one
kind or another'' were surrounding the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait but
``have not made any moves against the embassy or intruded in any
fashion.''
   ``It would appear that people are not being allowed to enter or
leave the embassy,'' Fitzwater said in Kennebunkport, Maine.
   Iraqi troops were also surrounding or patrolling near the
French, Japanese, Norwegian, Swedish, Romanian and Hungarian
embassies.
   The official Iraqi News Agency said Iraq would only detain the
male embassy employees _ including diplomats _ of those countries
that refused to close their embassies in Kuwait. But there was no
indication that dependents, including the U.S. women and children
who had traveled to Baghdad, were being allowed to leave.
   INA quoted an unidentified official spokesman in Baghdad as
saying Iraq ``is determined'' to implement its decision to shut
down the embassies in Kuwait.
   President Saddam Hussein of Iraq, who seized Kuwait in a
lightning assault on Aug. 2 and later annexed it, had given foreign
governments until 9 p.m. Friday to vacate their embassies in Kuwait.
   Spain's ambassador to Jordan, Ramon Armengod, told a news
conference in Jordan on Friday that Iraqi authorities later told
the embassies in Kuwait that they had until 8:30 a.m. Saturday to
close.
   He quoted Iraqi authorities as saying that once the Saturday
deadline passed, troops would ``proceed with the forced
evacuation'' of diplomats.
   The deadline passed with no immediate report of action by Iraqi
troops.
   Baghdad has said that keeping the embassies open would amount to
an ``act of aggression'' and that diplomats remaining in Kuwait
would no longer be considered protected by diplomatic immunity.
   The United States, Canada, Japan, Bangladesh, Switzerland,
Austria, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, Egypt and the 12
European Community nations were among those countries who declared
they would defy the order.
   They have evacuated most of their staff and dependents, leaving
behind only skeleton staffs.
   Egypt has refused to close its embassy or reduce its staff of
20, and its foreign ministry announced Friday that it would hold
Iraq responsible for any harm to its mission. In Cairo, four
truckloads of riot police remained outside the Iraqi Embassy, where
they have been stationed since the invasion of Kuwait.
   The United States and other countries said their embassies have
a right to remain in Kuwait because they do not recognize Iraq's
annexation of the oil-rich emirate and need to provide assistance
to citizens trapped there.
   About 3,000 Americans and 4,500 Britons are among the roughly
21,000 Westerners trapped in Iraq and Kuwait.
   Among the countries complying with the Iraqi order to close
their embassies were Lebanon, Jordan and the Philippines.
   The Soviet Union, Malaysia and India evacuated all of their
embassy personnel from Kuwait, but said they did not consider their
missions closed.
   Saudi Arabia refused to close its embassy, but its legation in
Kuwait has been locked since the invasion and the Saudi ambassador
is back in his country.
   About 60 countries have embassies in Kuwait.

   Scientists who successfully bonded
metal ions to an antibody say it's the first step toward creating
super-antidotes that could neutralize chemical weapons, drug
overdoses and most poisons.
   The metal ions act as catalysts that can convert poisons to
harmless substances inside the human body, said Stephen J.
Benkovic, a chemistry professor at Penn State.
   ``It could be used as a detoxifying agent for people who have
taken a drug overdose and can be used against environmental
pollutants,'' Benkovic said in an interview. When the U.S. military
learned of the early laboratory success, it asked for a briefing
about applications in chemical warfare, he said.
   The ``metalloantibodies'' can be made by altering the amino acid
sequence of protein to make it easier to bind with a metal, said
Sheila A. Iverson, working on the project at the Research Institute
of Scripps Clinic at La Jolla, Calif.
   Antibodies occur naturally in the body and are integral
components of the human immune system. They attack invading
bacteria and viruses. Using metal ions could broaden their range to
combat strong toxins the human body cannot fight.
   Through different modifications, antidotes could one day be
developed for any poison, making metalloantibodies a logical
defense against chemical warfare, said David Lenz, an Army
pharmacologist at the Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland.
   ``It can be used not so much to demoralize the enemy, but to
reduce the threat of him using chemical weapons at all,'' Lenz
said. ``They won't use them if they're not going to work.''
   Development of antibodies for humans is years away, but recent
laboratory successes are promising, he said.
   ``By having a metal ion embedded in the protein, it can now
catalyze many diverse chemical reactions,'' said Benkovic, whose
work with Richard Lerner of the Research Institute was published in
the Aug. 10 issue of Science magazine.
   A metalloantibody could be developed to treat cocaine overdoses,
Benkovic said.
   ``The antibody can convert poisons by acting as a catalyst,'' he
said. ``It changes the first toxin it sees, then keeps on going
until there's no toxin left. The antibody can be engineered to bind
toxins or chemically change them.''
   With zinc or copper attached, the new antibody could be injected
into a person even before exposure. Chemical poisons rendered
harmless would be excreted.
   In research conducted between April and June, Benkovic and
Lerner experimented on genetic material exposed to fluorescein,
which emits a known amount of energy.
   After altering the genetic material's antibodies with a copper
ion, they exposed the new product to fluorescein. Energy changes in
the original foreign substance took place.
   ``When metal binds to fluorescein, it should change the energy
level,'' Ms. Iverson said, so researchers knew the metal ion had
been successfully added to the antibody.
   To make the process work on animals or humans, scientists must
explore the structure of other antibodies and determine what what
chemical alterations are needed to make the metal attach to them.
   If successful, antidotes could one day be mass-produced,
Benkovic said.
   ``We have shown that you can bind a metal ion to an antibody,''
Benkovic said. ``It's a start.''

<TEXT>
   A sizzling abortion debate in both
East and West Germany threatens to hold up a treaty that would
merge the laws of the two states.
   The newly adopted Oct. 3 unity date is not endangered, but
failure of the treaty would leave a number of legal issues to be
settled by an all-German parliament. All-German elections are not
set until Dec. 2.
   The opposition Social Democrats have threatened to torpedo the
treaty following a government decision that West German women who
after unity try to take advantage of East Germany's permissive
abortion law can be prosecuted.
   The Social Democrats have insisted West German law should only
apply to West German turf.
   Party chief Hans-Jochen Vogel said Chancellor Helmut Kohl's
government cannot ``force a special regulation that discriminates
against women.''
   Kohl needs a two-thirds majority for the treaty to pass
Parliament and thus needs the backing of the Social Democrats, West
Germany's second-biggest party.
   The treaty covers a grab bag of issues, including distribution
of sales tax revenues among the German states, how to settle claims
by West Germans on property they once owned in East Germany, and
abortion rights.
   For weeks women's rights groups, politicians and government
officials in both Germanys have feuded over the best abortion law
for a united Germany.
   In West Germany, abortions are allowed only if there is
life-threatening risk to the mother, if the pregnancy resulted from
rape or incest, or if the birth would create extraordinary social
and economic hardship for her.
   East German women, on the other hand, have a fundamental legal
right to an abortion, as long as it occurs within the first 12
weeks of pregnancy.
   East Germany, with a population of about 16 million, last year
recorded 73,000 abortions. The figure was 75,297 in West Germany,
which has a population abour four times greater than its eastern
neighbor.
   The two Germanys have agreed to keep their respective abortion
laws until a single set of statutes can be worked out, which could
take years.
   There is strong pressure from East German women to not scrap
their nation's abortion law.
   Many conservative West Germans insist their law is the correct
one.
   The Roman Catholic Church and the Lutheran Church added their
powerful voices to the debate Friday.
   In a joint statement, the two churches criticized East Germany's
abortion statute, saying it fails to ``stress that every death of a
human being stands in contradiction to the foundations for a humane
system of laws.''
   The statement was authored by Bishop Martin Kruse, head of the
German Lutheran Church, and his Roman Catholic counterpart, Bishop
Karl Lehmann.
   Kohl, however, is feeling pressure from within his coalition to
be more liberal on the abortion issue.
   Leaders of the Free Democrats, Kohl's junior coalition partners,
reluctantly agreed that West German women who go to East Germany
for abortions after unity should face prosecution.
   But many party members now say that decision was a mistake, and
they won't support it in a parliamentary vote.
   A weekend meeting is planned to try to resolve the dispute.

   China, having built international sports
facilities for the 11th Asian Games, has now set its sights on
hosting the Olympics in the year 2000, a senior official said.
   He Zhenliang, president of the Chinese Olympic Committee, said
China was ``taking an active attitude'' toward bidding for the 2000
Olympics, the official Xinhua news agency reported late Friday.
   Plans to bid for the games would depend on the success of the
11th Asian Games that China will host Sept. 22-Oct. 7, he was
quoted as saying.
   The Asian Games will be China's first major international sports
event. Organizers have rushed to complete facilities that have been
widely expected to be not just for the Asian Games but also in
preparation for bidding to host the Olympics.

   Five inmates killed a guard, took
four hostages and escaped from a maximum security prison in
southeastern Brazil, a television network reported.
   TV Globo, Brazil's largest network, said one guard died after
being shot in the head by the convicts when the incident began
during the prison lunch hour Friday.
   The jailbreak took place at the Contagem prison in Belo
Horizonte, about 290 miles northwest of Rio.
   After taking two guards as hostages, the prisoners demanded an
armored car to make their getaway, Globo reported. Officials
delivered the armored car in the late afternoon and the prisoners
fled, after trading the guards for four state troopers, Globo
reported.
   The network said a helicopter and 20 police vehicles were
following the armored car, which as of late Friday night was
heading south on a major road.

   The Peace Corps usually conjures up images of
idealistic American youth aiding the poor in distant lands. In a
new twist, a former Peace Corps volunteer has started a program for
foreigners to work at soup kitchens and homeless shelters in
America's inner cities.
   The first two Peace Corps-in-reverse volunteers arrived in
Boston this summer from Ghana and Czechoslovakia. Ghana was the
first country to receive American volunteers, and the latter one of
the latest.
   The two already have worked in soup kitchens and an inner-city
day camp, planted gardens at a homeless shelter and aided the
elderly. Both said the poverty they encountered surprised them.
   ``I knew there possibly would be some problems, but not to this
extent,'' said Charles Hutchinson, 29, a biology teacher taught by
Peace Corps volunteers as a teen-ager in southern Ghana.
   More than 130,000 volunteers and staff have served in the Peace
Corps in 95 countries since John F. Kennedy founded the overseas
development agency in March 1961 in his first major initiative as
president.
   Hutchinson and Ester Boszormenyiova, 24, of Czechoslovakia,
spoke outside the John F. Kennedy Library about the two-month pilot
program, funded by $6,000 in private donations.
   ``I think everybody who comes to the United States, they think
this is a very rich country ... a kind of Hollywood life,''
Boszormenyiova said.
   Boszormenyiova said she has few illusions about the darker side
of capitalism. She was particularly disturbed by the problems of
American youth.
   Hutchinson said learning about urban poverty here will serve him
well when he returns home. ``Many of our countries in Africa are
going through very fast development in terms of urbanization,'' he
said.
   Tracy Mathieu, a former Peace Corps volunteer, started up the
pilot program, and hopes to extend it next year so that 100
volunteers _ two for every state _ can come to the United States
for the summer.
   ``We're getting a lot of interest in it,'' said Mathieu, who
once supervised a water sanitation project in West Africa. ``It's
really taking off.''
   Supporters include Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., economist John
Kenneth Galbraith and Citizens Energy Corp. President Michael
Kennedy, a nephew of the late president.
   A reverse Peace Corps project was first proposed in 1961 by
former Ghanaian Prime Minister Kwame Nkrumah.
   For two years, between 1966 and 1968, overseas Peace Corps
volunteers came to the United States and worked in VISTA, the
Volunteers in Service to America progam for improving the living
conditions of impoverished Americans.
   But the program was never approved by Congress, Mathieu said.
   Both of this year's volunteers, who plan to attend school in the
United States when the program ends, said they are inspired by
Kennedy's call to American youth: ``Ask not what your country can
do for you, ask what you can do for your country.''
   Boszormenyiova said Kennedy's words hold significance for
Czechoslovak youth who want to foster democracy in the midst of
Eastern Europe's political upheavals.
   ``It was something I really started thinking about,'' she said.
``I feel that I must give something to my country. I'm proud of
Czechoslovakia, as John Kennedy was proud of America. People in
Czechoslovakia are waking up.''

   Two jumbo jetliners with a total of 942 people
aboard barely avoided colliding over western Japan, flying within
about 330 feet of each other before veering away, aviation
authorities said.
   The incident took place near Osaka International Airport
Thursday evening, the Transport Ministry said in a release seen
today.
   The release said the incident occurred about 27 miles south of
the airport when an All Nippon Airways Boeing 747 and another
Boeing 747 owned by Cathay Pacific Airways were approaching the
airport. The planes were both flying at an altitude of 13,000 feet.
   The pilots of both airliners barely avoided a collision by
turning at the instructions of air traffic controllers at the Osaka
flight tower, officials said.
   ANA flight 530, carrying 521 passengers and 15 crew members, was
arriving from Kumamoto in southwestern Japan, and CPA flight 564,
with 22 crew members and 384 passengers, was on a flight from Hong
Kong via Taipei.
   Officials of the Civil Aviation Bureau in the ministry are
investigating why the two planes were flying at the same altitude,
the statement said.

   The United Nations sanctioned the use of force to back up a U.N.
economic embargo of Iraq early Saturday, while Sadam Hussein made
diplomats his latest target, ringing foreign missions in Kuwait
with Iraqi troops.
   On Friday, the Soviet Union announced it was ending its
objections to the U.S. initiative, clearing the way for passage of
the resolution.
   That move came after Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
warned Saddam Hussein the Persian Gulf situation was ``extremely
dangerous'' and suggested in an urgent message his country might
now support a military blockade of Iraq.
   In Baghdad, Saddam detained a group of U.S. Embassy dependents
and staff who had been promised safe passage from his capital. He
said they would not be released until Kuwait's U.S. Embassy was
vacated.
   Britain said tanks surrounded its embassy, and the water and
power were cut. It later reported on Saturday that the tanks were
withdrawn and electricity restored.
   The Middle East conflict on Friday came home to hundreds of U.S.
military reservists called up in the first such summons since
Vietnam.
   Iraq's parliament speaker, Sadi Mehdi Saleh, warned the same day
the presence of U.S. forces in the gulf might ignite a war that
would set the region and its oil reserves afire and kill thousands
of Americans.
   At the United Nations, the 15-member Security Council voted for
a U.S. initiative that puts teeth into U.N. sanctions against Iraq.
   The resolution by the 15-member council passed with 13 votes in
favor and 2 abstentions. It calls on nations with naval forces in
the Persian Gulf region ``to use such measures commensurate to the
specific circumstances as may be necessary under the authority of
the Security Council to halt all inward and outward maritime.''
   Yemen and Cuba abstained from the vote.
   At least nine embassies in Kuwait _ including the U.S. and
British missions _ were guarded by troops Friday as diplomats
defied an Iraqi order to close their doors. With its Aug. 2
conquest of Kuwait and its quick annexation of the small oil state,
Iraq now considers Kuwait to be Iraqi territory.
   A European envoy said Baghdad threatened to use force to remove
diplomats remaining at their posts on Saturday. The Iraqis also
threatened to cut water and power to the missions, and the Foreign
Office in London said they did just that on Friday at the British
Embassy.
   Like other embassies staying open, the U.S. mission had a
skeleton staff of about 10. More than 100 U.S. Embassy staff and
dependents, including about 30 children, left Kuwait only to find
new trouble in Baghdad, where they were detained.
   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Friday the Iraqis
had promised earlier to allow the group of Americans to leave, but
then reneged. ``They are safe,'' he said _ but stuck.
   The official Iraqi News Agency said later that Iraq would only
detain the male embassy employees _ including diplomats _ of those
countries that refused to close their embassies in occupied Kuwait.
But there was no indication the dependents were being allowed to
leave.
   The Foreign Ministry in Rome said three Italian diplomats who
left Kuwait Thursday were kept from leaving Baghdad on Friday, and
that the reason cited was that Italy's Embassy in Kuwait had defied
orders to close.
   Besides the diplomats, about 21,000 Westerners _ including 3,000
Americans _were caught in Iraq and Iraqi-occupied Kuwait by the
invasion and President Bush said they must be considered hostages.
   Getting out of Iraq was becoming harder even for people from
countries not considered hostile toward Baghdad.
   Jordan, however, still let refugees cross over from Iraq despite
Wednesday's announcement that the border would be closed to them.
Jordan said coping with thousands of refugees had become too much
of a burden. The European Community and others moved to help with
money and supplies.
   Turkey, another escape route for refugees, said it might close
its border with Iraq unless countries whose nationals are coming
through take steps to ensure quick transport elsewhere.
   In his message, Gorbachev had urged Iraq to comply immediately
with U.N. Security Council resolutions.
   The Soviet ambassador to the U.N., Valentin V. Lozinskiy, later
announced in New York that Moscow was ending its resistance to
backing the U.N.-ordered embargo with military muscle. He also
indicated the Soviets would be willing to join an international
force to police the embargo.
   In Moscow, Foreign Ministry spokesman Yuri Gremitskikh said that
the Soviets had pulled all staff from their Kuwait embassy _ but
insisted they had not formally closed it. The Soviets _ long an
ally of Iraq _ immediately cut off weapons supplies to Baghdad
following the invasion.
   At the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait, Ambassador Nathaniel Howell and a
dozen other Americans remained. The White House said the Iraqi
troops outside the embassy in Kuwait ``are not allowing people to
enter or leave.''
   Troops were reported surrounding or patrolling near the
American, British, Canadian, French, Japanese, Norwegian, Swedish,
Romanian and Hungarian embassies. Nations including Venezuela, the
Philippines, India and Lebanon complied with the embassy-closing
order.
   Spain's Ambassador to Amman, Ramon Armengod, said in Madrid that
Iraqi authorities warned the Western diplomats that troops would
forcibly remove them from their missions starting Saturday.
   Also, the Japanese Foreign Ministry said Iraqi soldiers told the
two Japanese diplomats remaining in Kuwait Friday that their
diplomatic immunity had been revoked but made no attempt to remove
them from the embassy.
   The 12 European Community members indicated they would seek an a
``explicit, firm condemnation'' by the Security Council of Iraq's
behavior if their embassies were interfered with.
   In the Arabian desert, Iraqi troops are confronting tens of
thousands of U.S. troops deployed to deter further aggression by
Saddam.
   The American forces were being bolstered by reservists from half
a dozen states, who were packing their bags and preparing to report
for duty.
   Teresa Mason, 21, of Columbus, Ga., shipping out for Saudi
Arabia, said goodbye to her husband and 3-month-old baby.
   ``I wasn't real thrilled with the idea of her going over there,
but when you have to go, you go,'' said her 23-year-old husband
Joseph.
   The mobilization is expected to continue at least until Oct. 1.
Bush has the authority to call up as many as 200,000 reserves for
up to 180 days without declaring a national emergency.
   Oil ministers from most of the 13 nations making up the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed to attend the
talks in Vienna on Sunday, the cartel's headquarters, Venezuelan
President Carlos Andres Perez said in Caracas.
   Oil prices helped set off the crisis. Saddam cited Kuwaiti
overproduction that drove down prices and a land dispute as his
reasons for the invasion.

   Video stores have been besieged with requests
for cassettes of ``Three Men and a Baby'' amid speculation that the
ghost of a child lurks in a scene in the Disney film.
   ``Everybody who's walked into the store today wants this
movie,'' said operations manager Ryan Bicknell of Music Plus in the
Los Angeles suburb of Marina Del Rey. All the store's copies of the
1987 comedy about three bachelors who rear a baby were rented out
Friday morning, he said.
   ``Three Men and a Baby'' already is the No. 1 rental in video
history, according to Billboard magazine.
   Viewers have been transfixed by an eerie figure in a scene in
which actor Ted Danson and Celeste Holm, co-starring as Danson's
mother, walk by a window in a home shared by Danson and his
buddies, played by Tom Selleck and Steve Guttenberg.
   Partially obscured in the window is the figure of what looks to
many to be a young boy, seemingly hiding behind a curtain.
   ``I was never a firm believer in ghosts or anything, but I'll
tell you the truth, it made the hair stand up on my arms,'' Jon
Roup of Network Video in Pittsburgh said Friday.
   Callers from Milwaukee, Pittsburgh, Los Angeles, Utah and
Vancouver, Canada, have inquired at Disney's video division about
the scene for weeks, said Buena Vista Home Video spokesman Steve
Feldstein. Popular Los Angeles radio station KLOS reported on the
controversy Friday, setting off a rush for the video in this city.
   Feldstein said some viewers believe the figure is the ghost of a
child who either died or committed suicide in a house where the
film was shot.
   But he said the mysterious figure is actually a cardboard cutout
or standee of a man in top hat and tails. It was part of the set
dressing in the film that was made on a sound stage in Toronto, he
said, not in anybody's house.
   ``It's a prop,'' he said of the standee, a promotional device
for a role played by Danson.
   Some bought Disney's explanation.
   ``It doesn't look like a ghost,'' said sales rep Aaron Chu of
Movies and More in West Los Angeles. ``There's no third dimension
to the figure,'' he said, adding that it appeared to be the
likeness of a young man.
   Yet many people believe something supernatural is going on.
After all, ``Three Men'' was directed by Leonard Nimoy, the former
host of ``In Search Of,'' a television show tracking strange
phenomena.
   ``I put standups up all the time in here, and it isn't big
enough,'' said Tony Hostler of Best Video Rentals in Pittsburgh.
``You can't make out the kid's face, and on a real standup they
make sure you can. But you can make out the body real clear.
   ``I believe it's just some kind of freak of nature or
something,'' he said.
   Roup said he and other employees at Network Video examined the
footage carefully on a video machine with ``crystal-clear'' freeze
frame.
   ``If you look at it, it's way too small to be Ted Danson. And it
doesn't have any feet or anything,'' he said.
   As for Disney's explanation, he said, ``I think that's an
excuse...they're saying (it) not to scare people.''

   A federal grand jury issued indictments
against five state legislators accused of accepting bribes in
exchange for their support for a bill legalizing betting on horses
and greyhounds.
   A 16-month FBI sting operation led to the indictments issued on
Friday. Prosecutors said they expect a federal grand jury to issue
more anti-corruption charges against other state lawmakers over the
next few months.
   ``This investigation is continuing,'' U.S. Attorney Bart Daniel
said at a news conference.
   State Reps. Robert Kohn, Luther Taylor, Robert Brown, Danny
Winstead and state Sen. Rick Lee were indicted under the Hobbs Act,
a federal law banning acceptance of money or gifts in return for
votes or favors. Winstead also was indicted on a second charge of
obstruction of justice.
   ``The indictments, simply put, allege that each of these public
officials sold their votes for cash,'' Daniel said.
   Conviction under the Hobbs Act carries a maximum penalty of 20
years in prison and a $250,000 fine. Taylor, indicted on six
counts, faces a maximum sentence of 120 years in prison and a $1.5
million fine if convicted.
   Winstead faces a total of 30 years in prison and a $500,000 fine
if convicted on obstruction of justice.
   The five lawmakers either refused comment or did not return
calls made to their homes and offices.
   In July, the campaign spending records of all 124
representatives and 46 senators were seized in the sting operation,
code-named ``Operation Lost Trust.''
   The sting employed a former House member-turned-lobbyist, Ron
Cobb, and an undercover FBI agent who went by the name of Joe
Williams.
   Cobb purported to represent The Alpha Group of Atlanta, which
supported efforts to legalize parimutuel betting on horses and
greyhounds in South Carolina.
   Without elaborating, Daniel said the sting began as a drug
investigation.
   Daniel said the indicted legislators broke ``a sacred trust''
public officials hold.
   ``Their actions have torn at the very fiber of our democratic
form of government,'' he said. ``This case crosses all political,
racial and regional lines. Public corruption, we have learned,
knows no such boundaries.''

   A judge's rejection of provisions in
Pennsylvania's restrictive abortion law provides a chance for the
Supreme Court to review its 1973 decision in Roe vs. Wade that
legalized abortion, both sides in the case said.
   Senior U.S. District Judge Daniel H. Huyett struck down
provisions in the 1982 state law, saying much of it was just a
repeat of provisions previously ruled unconstitutional. The state
said it would appeal to the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and,
if necessary, to the Supreme Court.
   ``If the (Supreme) court is looking to overturn Roe v. Wade,
this case provides an opportunity to do that,'' said Linda Wharton
of the Women's Law Project, an attorney for the plaintiffs in the
case.
   ``Everything is happening the way we thought it would happen,''
said Republican Rep. Stephen Freind, the leading anti-abortion
voice in the Legislature. ``No doubt we are going to win in the
Supreme Court.''
   In 1986, the Supreme Court declared unconstitutional much of
Pennsylvania's Abortion Control Act. The Legislature amended the
act in 1988 and 1989, but Huyett called the new law ``nothing more
than a reenactment'' of the old one.
   In his 191-page ruling, Huyett said women's rights are being
``subjected to the vicissitudes of the legislative process.''
   The U.S. territory of Guam had banned all abortions except where
the mother's life is threatened. A federal judge on Thursday ruled
that law unconstitutional.
   The Guam ruling is the only other potential challenge to Roe vs.
Wade ``in the pipeline,'' Wharton said.
   Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania and five
abortion providers challenged the amendments. The judge's ruling
stops the state from enforcing them.
   ``Safe, legal abortion continues to be accessible to women in
Pennsyvlania because of the court's decision today,'' said
Elizabeth Hrenda-Roberts, executive director of Planned Parenthood
Pennsylvania Affiliates.
   ``Pennsylvanians would be well-served if the Commonwealth
accepts this decision and stops squandering taxpayers' money to
promote government interference in personal matters and threaten
women's lives,'' she said.
   An appeal could be heard sometime next year, and could reach the
Supreme Court in 1992, Wharton said.
   Robert Gentzel, spokesman for Attorney General Ernie Preate Jr.
said Friday's ruling was ``disappointing but not unexpected.''
   Huyett ruled against Pennsylvania's requirements that a woman
notify her husband before getting an abortion; wait 24 hours before
getting an abortion; and that minors obtain the consent of at least
one parent, or a court order, before an abortion.
   The judge upheld a provision allowing the state to collect data
from doctors and clinics on abortions performed as long as it was
kept confidential. He also upheld a section requiring a test to
determine the age of the fetus.

   A Superior Court judge who retired in
February returned to the courtroom to hear evidence in a murder
case _ but this time as a juror.
   During jury selection Thursday, Martin L. Haines, 70, described
himself as a ``struggling journalist.'' Since retiring from the
bench, he has been writing for the New Jersey Law Journal.
   First assistant county prosecutor Michael E. Riley and defense
attorney Jorge C. Godoy said they did not consider moving to strike
Haines as a potential juror.
   Haines was one of two judges named ``most competent'' in a 1989
survey of court officials carried out by the New Jersey Law
Journal. His opinions were considered among the most influential
handed down by the Superior Court during his tenure on the bench.
   The jury began hearing evidence Friday in the trial of Lee Roy
Foxx, 56, of Burlington City, who is charged with shooting to death
William Orange, 59, of Willingboro, in March.
   Haines wasn't the only juror in the case with legal connections.
Another juror is an attorney.

<HEAD>Tamil Rebels Thwart Government Advance Across Lagoon</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PATRICK CRUEZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tamil separatist rebels have thwarted
the army's efforts to cross a heavily mined causeway and enter the
guerrillas' chief stronghold in the far northern city of Jaffna,
military officials said today.
   For the past three days the Tamil Tiger guerrillas, entrenched
in bunkers on a small island in the Jaffna lagoon, have prevented
government forces from reaching Mandativu Island, officials said.
   The island is a key stepping stone in an arc of islands facing
Jaffna town.
   Officials denied that the army, which landed Wednesday on nearby
Kayts Island, had bogged down in its latest offensive against the
Tigers. But they acknowledged their attempts to break the Tiger
siege had slowed.
   The officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, claimed at
least 170 Tigers have died since the offensive began Wednesday to
crush the rebels in their Jaffna Peninsula stronghold. Troops also
hoped to rescue a government garrison under siege for more than two
months in Jaffna Fort.
   The causeway leads from Kayts Island to Mandativu Island and on
to the 17th century, star-shaped fort 4 miles away.
   Most of the rebels were killed by helicopter gunships strafing
boats and jungle roads, they said.
   They claimed only four soldiers have been killed and 16 wounded
in the 4-day-old offensive.
   Government troops landed Wednesday on Kayts Island. The
following day, Deputy Defense Minister Ranjan Wijeratne, chief
architect of the war effort, predicted they would reach the fort in
two or three days.
   The Tigers, in statements issued in London and Geneva, claim to
have killed ``a large number'' of government troops. They denied
the government had inflicted heavy losses, charging instead that
300 civilians died in government aerial bombing and strafing and
troops' gunfire.
   No independent reports of the situation in Jaffna Peninsula,
home to 850,000 people, have emerged. Communications with the
peninsula, 185 miles northeast of Colombo, were severed after June
11.
   On that date, the Tigers broke a 13-month cease-fire and
attacked government police stations and army camps. The combatants
use radios to communicate with colleagues outside the peninsula.
   The government claims 5,000 people have died in the past 10
weeks in northern and eastern Sri Lanka, bringing to 14,000 the
death toll since the Tamil insurrection began in 1983.
   The Tamil Tigers are fighting for a separatist homeland for
their ethnic minority, which has long accused the Sinhalese
majority of discrimination in jobs and education.
   Tamils comprise 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people.
They predominate in the north, while the east is about equally
divided among Sinhalese, Tamils and Moslems.
   Fighting has tapered off in the east, where the government is
concentrated in the towns and the Tigers have retreated to the
jungles.
   Sinhalese, who make up 75 percent of the population, have
controlled the government and military since the Indian Ocean
island became independent from Britain in 1949.

   Rain lingered in parts on the Northeast today, and fog or low
clouds covered much of the East and the nation's midsection during
the morning.
   Low pressure was expected to bring rain from southern Maine to
North Carolina today. Except for thunderstorms in Florida, sunny
skies and temperatures in the 90s were expected in the rest of the
region.
   Hot summer weather was predicted for the South, Midwest and
Southwest. A large storm system was forming over the Pacific
Northwest, with showers extending from Montana to Northern
California.
   Highs in the 80s were expected for areas with rain, while the
rest of the country was looking for temperatures in the 90s and
100s.
   In northern Texas, temperatures were expected to climb to 110
degrees with lows around 80. But showers over Northern California
could include snow in the higher elevations of the Sierra Nevada.
   The high temperature for the nation Friday was 106 degrees in
Phoenix and Bullhead City, Ariz.

   An anonymous midnight caller told deputies
where they could find the bundled kidnap victim.
   Unhurt and in good spirits was Iggy, a 3-foot-long iguana nabbed
from his pen at Upper Tampa Bay Park. The pen was found empty
Wednesday morning, and its door bolt was broken.
   Authorities don't know who took him, but park ranger Joe Humble
speculated the 40-pound lizard could have been put up for sale.
Iguanas are worth up to $200 on the black market, and it's not
uncommon for the lizards to be stolen and sold to pet stores, he
said.
   The iguana-nappers might have become scared and decided to
return Iggy Thursday night after the theft was reported, Humble
said.
   ``A lot of people know Iggy,'' the park ranger said. ``He's kind
of a celebrity. We take him around to local schools and use him to
teach kids about exotic wildlife.''

   A truck in a Kashmir-bound army convoy
skidded off a mountain road and plunged 1,500 feet into a river,
killing at least 22 soldiers, a police official said today.
   The crash occurred late Friday on the road linking Jammu and
Srinagar.
   Five injured soldiers were rescued, deputy inspector general
Gopal Sharma said. The truck was thought to be carrying about 40
soldiers, and the search for more victims was continuing, he said.
   The crash occurred near Ramban, about 45 miles northeast of
Jammu, on a winding section of road hewn from the mountainside
above the Chenab River. Sharma said the truck skidded out of
control and plunged off the mountain.
   Heavy military contingents are deployed in Kashmir in an effort
to quell a separatist revolt by Moslems. Additional troops were
deployed recently after clashes between Indian and Pakistani troops
along the disputed Kashmir frontier.

<HEAD>Irish Academic Traded Violence of Belfast For War In Beirut</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with five grafs to remove `reportedly'; Pickup 6th,
`American educator...'; Also in Saturday AMs report.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Irishman Brian Keenan, who
spent most of his life in strife-torn Belfast, dismissed the
dangers of Beirut when he went there to teach English in 1986.
   ``There's a war there. There's a war here at home and life has
to go on,'' his sisters remember him saying.
   For four months, Keenan taught at the American University in
Beirut, writing home about the beauty of Lebanon and the fine
cuisine and nightlife in Beirut.
   On April 11, 1986, he rushed out of his apartment, late for an 8
a.m. lecture, and was abducted by gunmen.
   No group had claimed responsibility for kidnapping Keenan, but a
previously unknown group called the Organization of the Islamic
Dawn announced he would be freed Friday.
   American educator Frank Reed, who was freed on April 30, said he
spent almost three years with Keenan and British journalist John
McCarthy _ either in the same room or the same house _ and had seen
them two days before his release. For at least part of the time,
they were blindfolded and chained to radiators.
   Keenan and McCarthy, who became like ``blood brothers,''
exercising daily and reading voraciously, Reed said.
   They kept each other's spirits high and Keenan had used his
Irish gift for storytelling to relate anecdotes lasting more than
an hour, Reed said.
   The Organization of the Islamic Dawn is believed part of
Hezbollah, or Party of God, a Shiite fundamentalist umbrella
organization whose factions hold most of the 13 Western captives in
Lebanon.
   Keenan's sisters, Brenda Gillham and Elaine Spence, said their
brother's mistake was to forget his Irish passport when he left his
apartment. They believe his kidnappers thought he was American or
British, rather than a citizen of a small neutral country.
   Although born in Northern Ireland, which is part of Britain,
Keenan decided about 15 years ago to adopt Irish citizenship, his
sisters said.
   Any Northern Irelander is entitled to dual Irish and British
citizenship. But Keenan's choice was unusual since he is
Protestant, and most Protestants identify with Britain rather than
the overwhelmingly Roman Catholic Irish Republic.
   Even though Keenan only has an Irish passport, he has never
renounced British citizenship, so both Britain and Ireland had
worked for his release.
   Keenan was dubbed Britain's ``forgotten'' hostage because his
plight did not receive the same publicity as that of Anglican
Church Envoy Terry Waite and McCarthy.
   After two years of campaigning for his release, Mrs. Gillham
said: ``The trouble is nobody seems to want to know. We have not
had much help. We wrote to some MPs (members of Parliament) but
only one replied.''
   Keenan never joined a political party, but his sisters said he
believes fervently in the non-violent unification of Ireland.
   With great affection, Mrs. Gillham and Mrs. Spence describe
their bachelor brother as somewhat eccentric _ a scruffy,
impulsive, artistic man who gets around Belfast on an old bicycle,
loves poetry, Irish culture, conversation and his dog, which is
with his mother Minnie in east Belfast. The dog's name is Saiorse _
the Irish word for freedom.
   When Keenan was born on Sept. 20, 1950, Northern Ireland was
still relatively conflict-free. But by the time he graduated from
Orangefield Boys Secondary School near his home in mainly
Protestant east Belfast in 1970, the province was in the throes of
sectarian rioting, the British army had arrived, and the Irish
Republican Army was being resurrected.
   Keenan graduated from the New University of Ulster at Coleraine
near Londonderry in 1974 with a bachelor's degree in English, and
spent the following year in San Sebastian, Spain, working as an
English tutor.
   In 1975 he returned to his old school, Orangefield, and spent
two years teaching English and coaching rugby. From 1977 to 1984,
as sectarian and political strife continued, Belfast City Council
employed him as a community worker, dealing with Protestants and
Catholics, young and old.
   ``He tried to build communication on both sides,'' Mrs. Gillham
said. ``He loved his country.''
   He also pursued his graduate studies, receiving a post-graduate
certificate in community studies from Aberdeen University in 1978,
a master's degree from the New University at Coleraine in
Anglo-Irish literature in 1984 and a doctorate in English
literature from the New University's Magee College in 1985.
   Later that year he left for Beirut.

<HEAD>Judas Priest Cleared of Liability in Suicides of Two Fans</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The lead vocalist of the British rock band
Judas Priest says the heavy metal group is ready to get back to
work after being cleared by a judge from liability in the death of
two young fans.
   ``Our immediate reaction is obviously one of great relief,'' Rob
Halford said Friday. ``It's a great day for Judas Priest.''
   In a telephone interview from from Puerto Vallarta, Mexico,
Halford said he and his fellow band members ``simply just want to
get on with what we do, playing rock 'n' roll and heavy metal
music.''
   Earlier Friday, Washoe District Judge Jerry Carr Whitehead ruled
that subliminal messages exist on the band's 1978 ``Stained Class''
album, but they were not intentional and did not cause the two
youths to form a suicide pact, as their families charged in a
lawsuit.
   He said the words ``do it'' on the song ``Better By You, Better
Than Me'' were a ``chance combination of sounds.''
   Raymond Belknap, 18, died from a single blast from a shotgun
held in his mouth two days before Christmas 1985. James Vance, then
20, blew away the lower portion of his face the same day but lived
until November 1988.
   The families of the two victims sued the band and CBS records,
claiming messages hidden in Judas Priest's song touted Satanism and
promoted suicide. They had sought $6.2 million in damages.
   Ken McKenna, a lawyer for Belknap's family, predicted the
judge's finding of subliminal content will open the way for similar
lawsuits.
   ``This finding, although not a victory, certainly gives hope to
attorneys pursing similar cases in the future,'' he said.
   Defense lawyer Suellen Fulstone agreed, saying she was pleased
with the result but adding: ``The judge is certainly more open to
the possibility of subliminal communication than I think the
scientific evidence warrants. I don't think this will be the end of
cases alleging such effects.''
   The defense maintained during the four-week trial that what
sounded like ``do it'' was actually Halford exhaling combined with
the sound of guitars.
   The judge agreed reluctantly, saying that a listener probably
would not have perceived such phrases in the record ``without the
power of suggestion.''
   In a small victory for the plaintiffs, Whitehead ordered
co-defendant CBS Records to pay $40,000 to their. He said the
company refused to find the original multitrack recordings of other
songs on the ``Stained Class'' album.
   He said the defaults were not caused by the courtroom lawyers,
but by in-house counsel of CBS.
   The judge added that even if the master tapes had been found,
``the court does not believe that the ultimate outcome of the trial
would have been any different.''

<TEXT>
   The Security Council today overwhelmingly
authorized military action to enforce its trade embargo against
Iraq, in an unprecedented step meant to force Saddam Hussein's
troops to pull out of Kuwait.
   Approval came after the Soviet Union on Friday dropped its
opposition to the U.S.-backed resolution. As one of the five
permanent members of the Security Council, the Soviets have veto
power.
   It was the first time in its 45-year history that the council
had authorized such military action to enforce its own sanctions _
a sweeping economic embargo against Iraq.
   Iraq's envoy condemned the council action as illegal and warned
that acting on it could lead to all-out war.
   ``This use of force by the United States or any of its allies or
puppets will lead inevitably to a number of explosions which will
burn all in their path,'' said Iraqi Ambassador Abdul Amir
Al-Anbari.
   U.S. Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering hailed the decision.
   ``Iraq has evaded resolutions of the Security Council and
thumbed its nose at all humanity,'' he said. ``This has prompted
the council to take one of the most important decisions in its
history.''
   The vote early today was 13-0 with two abstentions, from Cuba
and Yemen, after informal meetings through the night.
   Yemen's ambassador, Abdallah Saleh Al-Ashtal, warned that any
military action backing the sanctions might lead to war, while
Cuban Ambassador Ricardo Alarcon said the council's move was in
defiance of the U.N. charter.
   The vote gave Security Council blessing to a loose military
arrangement, without a U.N. flag or command, whereby navies in the
region could take unspecified steps to enforce the U.N. embargo.
   Today's resolution calls on countries deploying warships in the
Persian Gulf region ``to use such measures commensurate to the
specific circumstances as may be necessary under the authority of
the Security Council to halt all inward and outward maritime
shipping'' in order to implement the embargo.
   Language calling for ``minimum force'' was dropped Friday at the
insistence of the Soviet Union and other nations, but diplomats
emphasized that the vague language adopted clearly did not exclude
the use of military might.
   ``It is sufficiently broad as to allow the use of force,''
Pickering said of the measure.
   ``This is not an act of war,'' he added, ``but an enforcement of
sanctions which have been flagrantly violated.''
   The sanctions against Iraq were ordered by the United Nations on
Aug. 6 to punish Iraq for invading Kuwait on Aug. 2 and later
annexing it.
   Most countries have cut off trade with Iraq, whose main export
is oil. But but some Iraqi ships have gotten around the embargo,
Pickering said.
   Jordan has allowed trucks to transport supplies into neighboring
Iraq from ships that unload at the Jordanian port of Aqaba. It was
not immediately clear what effect the resolution would have on
those shipments, as they have been difficult to differentiate from
Jordanian imports.
   The resolution covers only maritime shipping and not airlifts to
Iraq.
   It was the fifth in a series of strong council resolutions since
Iraq invaded Kuwait. Other resolutions have condemned the invasion
and demanded immediate and unconditional withdrawal; imposed
sweeping economic sanctions against Iraq; declared the annexation
of Kuwait to be null and void; and demanded the immediate release
of all foreigners held against their will.
   There is no precise precedent for such U.N. authorization of
military action. In 1950 in the Korean conflict, it approved an
international force under a U.N. flag and a U.S. command.
   British Ambassador Crispin Tickell said the latest move was
``the result of mounting evidence of breaches of sanctions on a
large scale. There is a string of tankers carrying Iraqi oil from
Iraqi ports going outward.''
   He said the resolution ``shows a new spirit and creative
approach of the international community to deal with an
unprecedented crisis.''
   The confirmation of Soviet support by Ambassador Valentin V.
Lozinskiy on Friday removed the final major hurdle to Security
Council approval of the U.S. initiative. For about 10 days the
Soviets had balked.
   But Lozinskiy emphasized that use of any force should be the
``last resort.'' He said political and diplomatic efforts should
come first in defusing the crisis precipitated by Iraq's invasion
of Kuwait.
   Chinese Ambassador Li Daoyu said his government is also opposed
in principle to military involvement by big powers and is ``not in
favor of using force in the name of the United Nations.'' He said
China had argued to delete the reference to ``use of force'' from
the amended resolution.
   On Friday, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev sent an urgent
message to Saddam that urged him to obey U.N. resolutions or face
``corresponding additional measures.''
   President Bush had said he wanted the Security Council's
endorsement of the use of force to halt Iraq's shipping. But he
also said the United States already had the right to enforce the
U.N. trade sanctions against Iraq.
   The five permanent council members are the United States,
Britain, China, France and the Soviet Union.

<HEAD>African Force Reportedly Lands in Liberia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHELLE FAUL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A multinational African force sent
to Liberia to end its civil war landed safely in the port city of
Monrovia and met no resistance from government or rebel soldiers, a
news agency reported.
   The landing occurred Friday night, the News Agency of Nigeria
said.
   The report, monitored in Abidjan, said Nigeria's naval
headquarters was in touch with the 3,000 troops sent to Liberia
aboard six ships.
   Earlier Friday, gunfire in Monrovia had kept troops from the
five West African states from landing, delaying their attempt to
end Liberia's 8-month-old civil war, which has killed more than
5,000 people, mostly civilians.
   Charles Taylor, a leader of one of two Liberian rebel groups,
has threatened to fight the multinational task force, saying their
announced intention to stop the fighting is a ploy to keep
President Samuel Doe in power.
   Taylor's National Patriotic Front has about 10,000 fighters and
is stronger than either Doe's forces or those of Prince Johnson, a
leader of a rebel faction that has grown hostile to the Taylor's
group.
   The port of Monrovia is controlled by Johnson's forces who also
hold most of the capital city.
   Johnson's forces and troops loyal to Doe declared a truce
Monday, and said they would welcome the West African intervention.
They also said they were ready to join forces to resist any attacks
by Taylor.
   Taylor said through his chief spokesman, Tom Woewiyu, that the
soldiers of the task force will be regarded as the ``enemy and we
will shoot at them.'' Taylor's forces control most of the country
outside the capital.
   Fighting has raged in Monrovia since late June. Taylor led his
forces into Liberia from Ivory Coast on Dec. 24, saying Doe's
government was corrupt and that he wanted to oust it. Johnson later
split with Taylor.
   West African leaders decided to intervene on Aug. 6. They said
the war was no longer an internal conflict because thousands of
their citizens were trapped in Liberia and 400,000 Liberian
refugees were burdening neighboring countries.
   The task force's chief of staff, Brig. Cyril Igwueze of Nigeria,
said on Nigerian state television Thursday that the West African
troops have no desire to shoot their way into Monrovia. But he also
warned, ``We are able and willing to defend ourselves if attacked.''
   Troops from Ghana, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Gambia and Guinea are
in the force. Togo said it would send troops but did not.
   U.S. forces stationed on a warship off Liberia's coast have
evacuated U.S. citizens and residents of other countries trapped by
the fighting. The U.S. Marines have also landed in Liberia to
defend the U.S. Embassy compound.

<HEAD>New Tropical Depression Joins Storm Gustav</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tropical storm Gustav headed west toward the Lesser
Antilles today as another tropical depression strengthened in the
eastern Atlantic, forecasters said.
   Gustav, the seventh named tropical storm of the 1990 Atlantic
hurricane season, was headed west at 13 mph with top sustained
winds of about 45 mph, said hurricane specialist Hal Gerrish of the
National Hurricane Center in suburban Coral Gables.
   At 6 a.m. EDT, Gustav was centered near latitude 13.6 north,
longitude 50.6 west about 690 miles east of the Lesser Antilles. It
was expected to maintain that motion through today and gain
strength, Gerrish said.
   The depression, ninth of the season, formed about 10:30 p.m. EDT
Friday, said hurricane specialist Lixion Avila.
   ``It looks like it's becoming better organized, and we think it
could become (Tropical Storm) Hortense before the end of the day,''
he said.
   At 6 a.m. EDT, the depression was located near latitude 12.5
north, longitude 37.2 west, about 850 miles west southwest of the
Cape Verde Islands.
   It was moving west with maximum sustained winds of 35 mph and
was expected to maintain that motion today, said hurricane
specialist Max Mayfield. It would become a tropical storm if wind
speed increased to 39 mph.
   The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1 to Nov. 30.

<TEXT>
   President Kurt Waldheim of Austria met
today with Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein on the fate of thousands of
foreigners held in Iraq, an Austrian diplomat said.
   Waldheim, the first Western leader to meet with Saddam since
Iraq invaded Kuwait Aug. 2, arrived aboard an Iraqi presidential
plane, accompanied by his foreign minister, Alois Mock, and other
Austrian officials, according to diplomats, who spoke on condition
of anonymity.
   Saddam and other senior Iraqi officials greeted Waldheim at the
Baghdad airport, they said.
   An Austrian diplomat said Waldheim was expected to use his
friendship with Saddam to raise the issue of the 21,000 Westerners,
including more than 70 Austrians and 3,000 Americans, stranded in
Iraq and Kuwait.
   Waldheim became acquainted with Arab leaders during his 10 years
as United Nations secretary-general. He has been shunned by Western
leaders in recent years since it was disclosed that during World
War II Waldheim served with a German army unit in the Balkans
implicated in atrocities, and later misrepresented his war record.
   In Vienna, Austrian radio said Saddam held an impromptu news
conference for Austrian reporters accompanying Waldheim before the
talks started. Saddam had not talked with Western reporters since
the crisis began.
   The radio quoted Saddam as saying that Iraqi troops don't plan
to withdraw from Kuwait, and confirming that foreigners have been
brought to strategic points, including missile bases and oil
refineries.
   ``This is not done to protect Iraq against the U.S. but to
protect the foreigners,'' the radio quoted Saddam as saying.
   The radio quoted Saddam as saying the United States had occupied
Saudi Arabia and other holy places of Islam and the ``Arab world
condemns this.''
   He termed the Western military action ``a naked aggression,''
the phrase Westerners applied to his invasion of Kuwait.
   ``The leadership of Saudi Arabia is corrupt,'' Saddam reportedly
said. But he said Iraq respects the sovereignty of every Arab
country and would not attack Saudi Arabia.
   The radio quoted Saddam as saying Iraq also respected the
sovereignty of Kuwait, ``but the corrupt regime there made a
conspiracy against its motherland.''
   He said he was happy about the visit of Waldheim, whom he
described as ``an especially fair politician who could mediate.''
   The Austrian president arrived from Amman, Jordan. Austria's
ambassador to Amman, Franz Pernegger, told The Associated Press
that Waldheim was not accompanied by Jordan's King Hussein.
Earlier, it was believed that the king also might attend the
meeting with Saddam.
   Waldheim told reporters Friday in Amman that he would discuss
``humanitarian issues'' with Saddam.

<TEXT>
   Jordan and Turkey kept their borders with
Iraq open today to a diminishing flood of mostly Arab refugees as
Saudis and Europeans moved to help with money and supplies.
   Of 205,000 evacuees who crossed into Jordan in the past 18 days,
only 35,000 remain, mostly Arabs and Asians, said Salameh Hammad,
interior ministry undersecretary.
   Jordan has been allowing in 20,000 refugees a day. A senior
Jordanian security official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said ``a much fewer number of people are crossing my borders now
and we were told by Iraqi authorities that the number of people on
their borders is in the hundreds.''
   He said authorities were transporting away 7,000 people stranded
for two days at the Ruweishid border post, 210 miles northeast of
Amman.
   The Jordanian security official also said 5,000 foreigners were
at the Iraqi border post of Rutbah, 75 miles west of Ruweishid,
awaiting entry to Jordan.
   The refugees reached Rutbah, 590 miles west of Baghdad, after
grueling desert treks that left them in need of food, water and
whatever personal items they were not able to bring along.
   Saudi Arabia's King Fahd ordered six planes to assist the
Egyptian airlift of its nationals reaching Jordan, according to
state-run Riyadh radio. Saudi Arabia also is sending $75 million to
help Egyptian authorities resettle the workers who fled
Iraqi-occupied Kuwait.
   The European Community earlier this week said it gave Jordan
$1.3 million to help it deal with refugees. Spain said today it
planned to send a transport plane bearing medicine, food, blankets
and tents to Jordan on Monday.
   Jordan had announced Wednesday it would close its border with
Iraq, saying it could not handle the financial strain of coping
with tens of thousands of refugees.
   But Amman announced Friday it was officially reopening its
borders _ which had never really closed _ and it asked the United
Nations for emergency assistance.
   Turkish Premier Yildirim Akbulut warned Friday that his nation
faces similar problems and might have to close its border post
where more than 4,500 foreigners have crossed from Iraq.
   Some 21,000 Westerners, including 3,000 Americans and 4,500
Britons are stranded in Iraq and Kuwait. They have been barred from
leaving Iraq by President Saddam Hussein, who is using some of them
as human shields at potential military targets.
   In Thailand, the Bangkok Post reported today that the Palestine
Liberation Organization offered to assemble bus convoys and escort
250 Thai workers a day from Kuwait. The PLO has been seeking
official recognition from Thailand, and about 3,500 Thai workers
remain in Kuwait, the newspaper said.

   Several European governments today joined the
United States in welcoming the United Nations Security Council
resolution authorizing military enforcement of the economic embargo
against Iraq.
   The resolution, adopted 13-0 with Cuba and Yemen abstaining,
called on all countries deploying maritime forces in the Persian
Gulf region to use ``such measures commensurate with the specific
circumstances as may be necessary'' to end commerce with Iraq.
   The French Foreign Ministry called the measure ``a very
important act which is testimony to the international community's
firmness and solidarity,'' and said French forces would apply the
resolution ``with the necessary resolve.''
   Though France was coordinating with other countries on the
placement of forces, ``each force remains under national control
and master of its mission,'' the Foreign Ministry said in a
statement.
   Britain refused to say immediately what force British vessels
would use to back up the embargo. ``We will use, obviously, the
minimum force necessary,'' William Waldegrave, the second-ranking
official in Britain's Foreign Office, told a news conference.
   He hailed the passage of the resolution.
   ``It is important that, contrary to what some people might have
expected _ I think what Saddam Hussein expected _ the unity of the
international community is not fraying, it is actually getting more
close as time goes on,'' Waldegrave said.
   The White House said today the resolution ``further strengthens
the world resolve to force Iraq out of Kuwait.''
   Greek government spokesman Vyron Polydoras called the Security
Council decision ``an act of historic significance and a landmark
in the further course of international relations.''
   ``It demonstrates the will of the international community to
serve justice and ethics,'' he said in a statment.
   Greece has said that it will send a frigate to join the
multinational armada but has not said when it will sail or what its
mission will be.
   Danish Foreign Minister Uffe Ellemann-Jensen said the Security
Council move ``is so fine that I almost don't know how to express
it.'' He said his country is now prepared to contribute a corvette
and a supply ship to the forces in the gulf, subject to
parliamentary approval.
   ``With the historic U.N. resolution we now have a clear basis to
participate actively in the multinational blockade of Iraq,''
Ellemann-Jensen said in an interview with Danish public radio.
   Juan Lena, spokesman for the Spanish Foreign Ministry, said in a
statement that the Security Council vote ``coincides with the
Spanish posture since the start of the Persian Gulf crisis in
seeking to provide effective enforcement of the U.N. embargo
against Iraq within the framework of the United Nations.''
   Dutch Foreign Minister Hans van den Broek said the resolution
would discourage would-be breakers of the embargo, ``because now
they are going to run a certain risk.''
   ``Navy ships in the area will not any longer be condemned to
strict passivity when freight ships refuse to divulge their
cargo,'' van den Broek said in an interview on Dutch radio.

   Police said Saturday they arrested 60
supporters of ousted Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and raided her
party's suburban headquarters.
   Ms. Bhutto claimed the arrests were aimed at manipulating
general elections scheduled for Oct. 24.
   ``Such unwarranted action . . . is designed to openly create a
state of panic and thereby pave the way for rigging of the coming
elections,'' Ms. Bhutto said in a statement.
   On Aug. 6, President Ghulam Ishaq Khan dismissed Ms. Bhutto's
20-month-old government on charges of corruption, nepotism and
ineptitude.
   Ishaq Khan said Ms. Bhutto had been unable to curb ethnic and
political violence that has caused at least 500 deaths since May in
Sindh, her home province and political power base.
   The arrests were in connection with a shooting spree Wednesday
in Karachi that killed 30 people and injured dozens more. The
victims were members of the refugee people's movement, representing
Indian immigrants who came to Pakistan after it gained independence
from British India in 1947.
   Police said marauding gunmen opened fire on brightly colored
booths set up throughout the city to welcome the movement's
returning leader, Altaf Hussein. He had been receiving several
months of medical treatment in London for a kidney ailment.

   An escaped convict suspected in four
slayings, including an attack on a group of target shooters that
killed two, was wounded and captured early today after an extensive
manhunt, authorities said.
   Michael G. Bell was shot in the neck as he ran from a bar and
attempted to escape in a car, said Boulder sheriff's Lt. Joe Gang.
Officers who had been tipped off were waiting in the car.
   He was taken to Boulder Community Hospital, where he was in
serious condition, a nursing supervisor said.
   Bell, 36, escaped from the Four Mile Correctional Center in
Canon City on Aug. 5. He is suspected of being the man who rounded
up five men as they practiced target shooting in the mountains
Friday, and then opened fire. Two men were killed and a third
seriously injured.
   Bell also is being sought for questioning in the fatal shootings
of a 36-year-old transient on Tuesday in Boulder Canyon and a
20-year-old convenience store clerk in Broomfield on Aug. 15, Gang
said.
   After Friday's attack, roadblocks were set up in Boulder and on
roads throughout the pine-covered mountains and steep canyons
northwest of the city. It was described as Boulder County's largest
manhunt in 15 years.
   Authorities said Bell contacted someone he knew and asked the
person to provide a car so he could escape. Instead, Gang said, the
person tipped off authorities.
   When Bell arrived at the Boulder City Limits, a bar, deputies
were waiting in the car he planned to take.
   Identities of the two men killed Friday were withheld pending
notification of relatives.
   The wounded were Timothy Bendel, described as in his 20s, who
was shot in the head and was listed in serious condition at Boulder
Community Hospital, and Michael Victor, 22, was treated and
released after a bullet grazed his head, hospital official said.
   Matthew Hickey, 19, who fell while trying to escape the
shootings, was treated for a knee injury and released, said
Assistant Boulder County Sheriff Dave Voorhis.
   The five men were in an area of the mountains used for target
shooting and motorcycle riding when the shooter drove up in a blue
car and represented himself as an off-duty park ranger, Voorhis
said.
   He took the serial numbers of the victims' weapons and began to
march them back down to a road, Voorhis said. ``As the five were
going down to the road he began shooting them,'' he said.
   The car, which was stolen near Canon City on Aug. 6, was found
abandoned in Boulder later Friday.
   Spokeswoman Liz McDonough of the state Department of Corrections
said Bell, 36, was admitted to the state prison system in 1988 and
was serving a 12-year sentence for check fraud and theft.
   She said Bell had an Illinois prison record, including for
attempted murder in 1972.

   For much of the summer, two dozen cardboard shacks
draped in plastic have sheltered a small squatter community a
stone's throw from the magnificent gold-tipped domes of Red Square.
   Not long ago, police would have smashed the shacks and dragged
the occupants away. Today, policemen protect the squatters from the
occasional angry worker who wants to evict them from their grassy
lot outside the Hotel Rossiya.
   So the squatters wait, as everyone here must for one thing or
another. They sit with their hand-scrawled paper signs about
grievances against the government, former employers, the Communist
Party.
   As summer slid into autumn, bringing a cold rain, the ink of
their printed plaints ran and smeared.
   ``We are here today,'' one sign says. ``You will be here
tomorrow. We are all deprived of our rights in the U.S.S.R. Down
with Communist slavery.''
   Like everyone else, they wait to see what the government will do
next.
   It has been a long summer of waiting: for consumer goods, for
the government to prepare a new plan for a market economy, for yet
another explosion of protest.
   The list of things people must wait for seems to grow as rapidly
as the line that forms in the rain for a rare opportunity to buy
German shoes.
   Drivers carry empty cans in their cars to fill when they find
gasoline. Frustrated smokers block traffic in Moscow and other
cities to protest a cigarette shortage. Ice cream kiosks close
because there is none to sell.
   Even bread, traditionally abundant and just a few cents a loaf,
is so scarce that rationing was introduced in Tarusa, south of
Moscow. A riot broke out in Chelyabinsk, Siberia, after an angry
crowd had demanded vodka and meat.
   Some things are plentiful.
   Old women sell freshly cut red, white and pink carnations
outside nearly every subway station.
   Just in time for fall, while parents hunt for scarce school
notebooks, inflatable beach toys fill the shelves of Detsky Mir,
the huge children's department store.
   At tables inside subway stations, vendors sell posters featuring
everything from pictures of the last czar to a topless woman
putting a saddle on a horse. There's a bumper grain crop this year,
but the fuel shortage hampers the harvest and tons of wheat may rot
in the fields.
   Crime is increasing. Some tourists report their hotel rooms
looted. Black marketeers hawk car parts, cigarettes and other goods
on Moscow's ring road on Saturday nights.
   Newspapers are filled with reports of violent crimes, including
rumors of a ``Jack the Ripper'' on the loose in Moscow.
   Two things are in great supply: anxiety and pessimism.
   Many people agree the Soviet Union must adopt a market economy,
but worry about replacing a bad system with one that may be worse.
   Sergei Borinov, a 19-year-old college student, says he is not
convinced the goverment can cure the shortages and the ailing
economy.
   ``Lawmakers have visited shops several times to check the
situation in the stores, and nothing ever changes,'' said Borinov,
one of those who blocked traffic last week to protest cigarette
shortages. ``I am indignant about such an attitude, and about just
what is going on in our country.''
   Two commissions, one appointed jointly by President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev and his chief rival, Boris N. Yeltsin, and the other run
by Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, are considering how to make
the switch to a market system.
   Yeltsin, president of the Russian federation, says it should be
done in 500 days.
   Gorbachev wants to go slower, lessening the shock of price
increases.
   Yeltsin has accused Ryzhkov's government of sabotaging the
reform effort by not divulging basic economic data, and has said
the Russian federation will ogo its own way if the Ryzhkov plan is
presented to the national parliament, scheduled to convene Sept. 3.
   Russia, largest of the 15 Soviet republics, is one of a dozen
republics seeking to set their own courses, either through
independence or a lesser form of autonomy.
   The separatist movements are related to the process of
disintegration illustrated by the cardboard village near the
Kremlin walls, where dozens of protesters clamor for the attention
of the Soviet leadership. They have elected an unofficial mayor to
coordinate their demands.
   Authorities have made no move to evict them.
   A policeman who spends eight hours a day keeping track of them
was asked how long they would be allowed to stay.
   ``It depends on how fast their problems are solved,'' Lt. Sergei
Petrykin said.
   ``The country has a lot of problems, and these are priorities.
When the country resolves its own problems, it will be easier to
deal with the individual problems of these people.''
   In the meantime, he said, ``these people are just torturing
themselves.''

   President Turgut Ozal of Turkey tells of
glancing at the television screen just in time to see and hear
President Bush saying he was about to call him up.
   The Turkish president walked into his office and picked up the
ringing telephone. It was Bush.
   That's the way it often is in the Persian Gulf confrontation.
Cable News Network's constant, live broadcasts from scenes of
crisis and diplomacy lets leaders a world apart look over one
another's shoulders as events unfold.
   In another era, information on crisis situations moved to
diplomats and warriors over secret, coded, back channels. The world
knew only what these movers and shakers wanted known.
   The Gulf crisis is broadcast around the world in color, often
live, 24 hours a day on CNN. Among the most avid watchers are the
world leaders who make the news, including Britain's Margaret
Thatcher, France's Francois Mitterrand, Libya's Moammar Gadhafi and
King Fahd of Saudi Arabia.
   CNN staffers in Washington are reminded of this by a photograph
tacked to their bulletin board. It shows President Bush and his top
advisers watching an Iraqi newscast, the CNN logo prominent in one
corner.
   ABC's Ted Koppel, broadcasting from Baghdad, paid a rival the
ultimate compliment by saying that the Iraqi foreign ministry was
following events by watching CNN.
   And Turkey's Ozal, a key player, says he has kept his television
tuned to CNN since Iraq troops crossed into Kuwait Aug. 2. An
Associated Press reporter arriving for an interview recently found
the president chuckling over a brawl between the New York Mets and
Philadelphia Phillies.
   Each morning, Iraqi television sends CNN's Atlanta headquarters
two or three messages advising what stories it plans to carry. Such
a message might advise that ``at 11:30 a.m. Eastern Time, Iraqi TV
will be carrying a message from President Saddam Hussein to
President Bush.''
   Television has become a weapon in this war of nerves, just as it
was when the Ayatollah Khomeini allowed U.S. camera crews to film
frenzied mobs of Iranians denouncing ``The Great Satan'' America
during the 1979-1980 hostage crisis.
   And it's getting on President Bush's nerves. Bush complained to
reporters this week that they were asking harder questions of him
than of Saddam Hussein in Baghdad.
   Ed Turner, CNN's executive vice president for news gathering,
said the network tapes most Iraqi TV offerings and screens them
before they are put on the network.
   But on Thursday, when Hussein appeared on television for 50
minutes with a roomful of English-speaking hostages, CNN stayed
with Iraqi TV the entire time. The other American networks showed
excerpts of the bizarre, profoundly disturbing scene.
   Turner, no relation to CNN founder Ted Turner, shrugs off any
suggestion that the network is being used for propaganda by the
Iraqis.
   ``The technology that permits all this is not going to be
disinvented,'' he said. ``When we worry about being used or
manipulated, or becoming a part of this story as opposed to being
chroniclers, it seems to me that since the technology exists, it's
a question of using it responsibly.''
   Robert MacNeil, co-anchor of ``The MacNeil-Lehrer Hour'' on the
Public Broadcasting service, said television is doing what wire
services and newspapers have been doing for more than a century.
   ``It's just that television has speeded it up,'' MacNeil said.
``It's a kind of television version of the hot line that Kennedy
and Khrushchev set up after the Cuban Missile Crisis.''
   The international audience for CNN's broadcast is awesome. The
network's broadcasts are seen in 95 countries, including 25 in
Europe, 3 in the Middle East and 10 in Africa.
   ``We're virtually the primary source of news for many people,
including many principals involved in the current crisis,'' said
Peter Vesey, director of CNN International. ``It's gratifying, but
it emphasizes once again our responsibility as journalists not only
to get it fast, but to get it right.''
   Ted Turner began with 1.7 million domestic subscribers and now
has over 55 million. At any given time the evening newscasts of the
other three commercial networks out draw CNN 10-to-1, but that is
not a valid comparison since the cable network's audience is spread
over a 24-hour day.
   Vesey estimates that CNN has nine million subscribers worldwide,
but its audience is far larger, since the service is available
unscrambled to people who have the right kind of equipment, but
don't pay.
   The network observed its 10th anniversary last month and
Newsweek, describing a celebration, headlined its piece ``CNN is
the network of the new world it helped create.'' National Public
Radio's Daniel Schorr, who was with CNN at the start, called it
``The world's intercom.''
   CNN took out a three-age advertisement this month in the
industry publication, Electronic Media, to brag about how far it's
come.
   ``They laughed when we decided to create an all-news network,''
said the first page.
   ``Nobody's laughing now,'' says the second.

   The United Nations Security Council voted today to put military
might behind economic sanctions on Iraq, while diplomats inside
embassies in Kuwait played a tense waiting game with Iraqi troops
surrounding some of their compounds.
   U.S. officials said electricity to the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait
was cut off today but Iraqi troops around the American compound
have not attempted to close it.
   The Security Council vote came after the United States _ which
has dozens of warships in the Persian Gulf _ sought U.N. authority
to use force in stopping trade with Iraq. The embargo is aimed at
pressuring Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to end his 3-week-old
occupation of Kuwait.
   Iraq denounced the Security Council move as illegal and warned
it could lead to all-out war.
   ``This use of force by the United States or any of its allies or
puppets will lead inevitably to a number of explosions which will
burn all in their path,'' said Iraq's U.N. ambassador, Abdul Amir
Al-Anbari.
   Meanwhile, Japan's Foreign Ministry said today that Tokyo's
ambassador to Iraq had protested the moving of about 20 Japanese
from a Baghdad hotel to an unknown destination. A Foreign Ministry
official said the Japanese nationals were put on a bus today with
about 20 other foreigners, mostly Caucasians.
   Saddam has repeatedly threatened to use trapped foreigners as
human shields to protect Iraqi installations against attack.
   In the embassy standoff, a European envoy had said Iraq
threatened to forcefully remove diplomats remaining at their posts
in Kuwait today.
   But diplomatic sources said it was unlikely that Baghdad would
make such a move while Austrian President Kurt Waldheim was in the
Iraqi capital for talks with Saddam.
   Waldheim arrived today and Saddam himself was on hand to greet
him at the airport, according to diplomats who spoke on condition
of anonymity. The Austrian president was the first Western leader
to meet with Saddam since the invasion of Kuwait Aug. 2, which set
off the Persian Gulf crisis.
   According to Article 45 of the Vienna Convention on diplomatic
relations, foreign missions are to remain inviolable even in times
of armed conflict.
   Iraq had said it would cut water and power to embassy compounds
where diplomats defied an Iraqi order to close their doors.
   U.S. officials speaking on condition of anonymity said the power
was cut at the U.S. compound but water and other supplies remained
adequate.
   Japan and Italy said power had been cut at their embassies, but
the British Foreign Office said electricity to its compound, cut
Friday, was back on today and that Iraqi tanks previously
surrounding the British compound had left.
   The British and U.S. embassies were among 10 missions ringed by
soldiers.
   Today's U.N. Security Council vote was the first time in its
45-year history the council has authorized such military action to
enforce its own sanctions. The sanctions against Iraq were imposed
four days after the invasion.
   The resolution calls on nations with naval forces in the Persian
Gulf region ``to use such measures commensurate to the specific
circumstances as may be necessary under the authority of the
Security Council to halt all inward and outward maritime.''
   The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Thomas R. Pickering,
called the resolution a historic decision and said it is
``sufficiently broad as to allow the use of force.''
   The main sticking point prior to the vote was objections by
Moscow, but the Soviet Union agreed to back the resolution and said
it would consider joining the naval force. As a permanent council
member, the Soviets had veto power over the measure.
   The Soviet reversal after 10 days of balking came shortly after
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev sent an urgent message to Iraq
suggesting Moscow might support a military blockade. He called the
Persian Gulf situation ``extremely dangerous.''
   The 15-member council adopted the resolution with 13 votes in
favor and two abstentions, from Cuba and Yemen.
   Yemen said today it was fully committed to honoring the U.N.
embargo and denied reports it serves as a base for Iraqi warplanes.
   But diplomatic sources in the gulf region contended that Iraq
had flown 12 captured Kuwaiti jet fighters to Yemen, and that prior
to the invasion it had based 36 Soviet-made Iraqi jet fighters at
Ta'ez, 120 miles south of Yemen's capital, San'a.
   In occupied Kuwait, troops were reported surrounding, or
patrolling near, the U.S., British, Canadian, French, Japanese,
Italian, Norwegian, Swedish, Romanian and Hungarian embassies. Iraq
now considers its oil-rich neighbor Iraqi territory.
   Several nations complied with the Iraqi order to close
embassies, including Venezuela, the Philippines, India and Lebanon.
Moscow evacuated its embassy but said the mission remained
technically open.
   The Japanese Foreign Ministry said today that there were still
soldiers posted outside the Japanese mission, and that water,
electricity and telephone lines were cut.
   Japan also said one of 213 Japanese refugees from Kuwait _ now
under virtual house arrest in a Baghdad hotel _ had made telephone
contact with the Baghdad embassy and reported all the Japanese
confined in the hotel were well.
   In Rome, Italy's Foreign Ministry said today that electricity at
its Kuwait mission was cut off.
   Many embassies remaining open maintained skeleton staffs. Some,
including Poland and Spain, had just one diplomat present.
   Greece's Foreign Ministry said today its embassy's
telecommunications had been cut. Poland, too, said it has had no
contact with its embassy today.
   Spain's ambassador to Amman, Ramon Armengod, said in Madrid that
Iraqi authorities warned Western diplomats that troops would
forcibly remove them from their missions starting today.
   But there were no immediate reports of Iraqi action.
   The U.S. mission, like most embassies staying open, was cut to a
staff of about 10, including Ambassador Nathaniel Howell. On
Friday, 100 dependents and staff traveled to Baghdad, from where
they were scheduled to leave for home.
   But once they arrived, Saddam reversed an earlier promise and
refused to let them leave the country, said White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater.
   Later Friday, the official Iraqi News Agency said Iraq would
detain only male embassy employees of those countries that refused
to close embassies in Kuwait. But there was no indication the
dependents were being allowed to leave.
   Italy's Foreign Ministry said three Italian diplomats who left
Kuwait were also kept from leaving Baghdad on Friday.
   Iraq had said it would revoke the diplomatic status of embassy
staff who refused to leave by a Friday deadline. After that date,
diplomats were to be treated as any other foreigner.
   About 21,000 Westerners _ including 3,000 Americans _ have been
held in Iraq and Kuwait since the invasion, and President Bush has
said they must be considered hostages.
   Turkey and Jordan, which share borders with Iraq, said they were
encountering difficulties sheltering and providing transport for
the thousands of mostly Arab refugees streaming across their
borders.
   Jordan said earlier this week that it would close its border,
but the European Community and others moved to help with money and
supplies, and the border remained open. Turkey requested similar
assistance.
   In the Saudi Arabian desert, more than 100,000 Iraqi troops face
tens of thousands of U.S. troops deployed to deter further
aggression by Saddam.
   The American forces will be bolstered by reservists from half a
dozen states called up Friday.

<HEAD>Gulf Crisis Tests Europe's Ability to Take Joint Military Action</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUE LEEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Persian Gulf crisis has presented Western
Europe with a tough practical test of its dream of uniting into a
superpower.
   The European Community began the summer with ambitious plans for
deepening the economic and political union of its 12 member states.
Then came the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, and suddenly the Europeans
must think militarily as well.
   Their initial response was hesitant. The French appeared
determined to go their own way. West Germany cited constitutional
restrictions on deploying forces outside Europe.
   Britain, as ever Washington's most loyal ally, quickly sent
ships and planes, but it was an American show from the start. That
has helped squelch any notion in Europe that, with the end of the
Cold War, America was fading away as a superpower.
   ``The United States has gained tremendous respect and people can
no longer say that it is a failing superpower, unable to keep up
with the EC or anybody else,'' said Vernon Bogdanor, an Oxford
University expert on Europe.
   ``The European population is larger than that of the United
States and they rely on (Arab) oil even more than the Americans do,
but they are simply not able to organize their own defense.''
   It took nearly three weeks for the Europeans to come up with a
joint response.
   On Tuesday, the nine-nation Western European Union, the European
arm of NATO, said it had agreed on a coordinated military response
to back the U.N. embargo against Iraq.
   European Community foreign ministers, also meeting in Paris,
announced the same day that member countries would defy Iraqi
orders to close their embassies in Kuwait.
   Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, Spain and Greece will join
Britain and France in sending naval vessels to the gulf.
   West Germany said it would change its constitution to allow
participation. Portugal, the ninth member of the Western European
Union, expressed reservations and did not commit itself to sending
ships.
   Foreign Minister Roland Dumas of France described the Tuesday
meetings as a response ``to a situation which is exceptional in its
gravity and its implications.''
   France's president, Francois Mitterrand, acknowledged the
disadvantage of not having a joint defense structure. He said
Europe ``must become more conscious of itself, which will become
more possible once it has a political existence.''
   Bogdanor said Europe was slow to act ``partly because there is
no real European government to make decisions and partly because of
the lack of a defense capacity.''
   He said the Western European Union could act only through member
governments and required unanimity, and the EC was preoccupied with
internal problems.
   ``Germany is concentrating on reunification and the rest of
Europe is looking at monetary and political union, so the gulf
crisis has really highlighted the weaknesses of the Community,''
Bogdanor said.
   Josef Janning of the European Research Group at Mainz University
in West Germany said the delay showed the Europeans had no concept
of how to react quickly and were forced to scramble in a crisis.
   West Germany hid behind its own laws to avoid military action in
the gulf, he said, ``but it is noteworthy that . . . changing the
constitution is no longer being completely rejected.''
   As the EC's economic powerhouse, Germany cannot escape ``the
point that at some time military operations must be undertaken,
even if they expose themselves to others who say `Ah, there come
the Germans, who started World War II,''' Janning said.
   The EC has been firmer on diplomatic issues arising from the
crisis.
   Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd of Britain pointed to the united
stand on Iraq's threat to the embassies in Kuwait.
   ``It's been very heartening that, against some predictions,
we've all stuck together on this and none have yielded to the
temptation to pull out the diplomatic staffs while the going was
good,'' he said Friday, as Iraqi troops began surrounding the
legations.
   ``Even those countries who have very small communities in Kuwait
have stuck, and that is a good thing,'' Hurd said.
   Trevor Taylor, a defense expert soon to join the Royal Institute
for International Affairs in London, said of the decision to sent
naval forces: ``The notion that there would be such a coordinated
European military action outside the NATO area was unthinkable a
few years ago.''
   Christopher Hill, lecturer in international relations at the
London School of Economics, noted that the Western European Union
meeting was the first to coincide with a conference of EC foreign
ministers.
   ``Combine this with the German decision and . . . you have an
extremely significant development,'' he said.
   Hill added, however, that the concerted action runs ``the risk
of breaking the traditional Euro-Arab dialogue asunder.''

   A car company was bombed in the
financial district Saturday night and police said they suspected
renegade soldiers.
   The military has said that blasts in Manila may be a prelude to
a coup attempt against President Corazon Aquino.
   Police Col. Remy Macaspac said at least six cars were damaged
but no one was hurt in the explosion at the Toyota sales office in
Makati.
   It was the 14th bombing since mutinous soldiers bombed two
buildings of the Department of Trade in Makati on Aug 14.
   Mrs. Aquino has survived six coup attempts since becoming
president in February 1986 after a popular uprising drove the late
Ferdinand Marcos into exile.

   Electricity to the U.S. Embassy in
Kuwait was cut off today but Iraqi troops around the diplomatic
mission have not attempted to close it, U.S. officials said.
   ``They're operating under generator power,'' said White House
spokesman Roman Popadiuk, adding that the Bush administration had
``made known our views about the current situation'' to Iraqi
officials in Baghdad, Kuwait and Washington.
   But he said water and other supplies remain adequate for
Ambassador Nathaniel Howell and his staff of about 10 diplomats,
who are defying Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's order to shift the
U.S. embassy operations to Baghdad.
   ``Power was cut to our embassy some time during last night,''
Popadiuk said. ``There are reports that power as well as other
services such as water have been cut to other embassies.''
   He said, however, that electricity may have been restored to
some of the other diplomatic compounds.
   ``The embassy continues to function. It is carrying out its
consular functions,'' Popadiuk said.
   He said a small contingent of Iraqi soldiers remained outside
the embassy as they have since before Friday's deadline from the
Iraqis for Western nations to close their embassies in Kuwait.
   Meanwhile, the State Department sought to assure 2,500 or so
Americans trapped in Kuwait that the embassy was ``determined to
continue working for your release from Kuwait and your safe return
to your families.''
   In a broadcast carried on the Voice of America and the British
Broadcasting Corp., the State Department also cautioned Americans
not to go to the embassy compound where Iraqi troops were posted.
   ``The United States government wants American citizens to be
assured that your welfare is foremost in our thoughts,'' the
broadcast said.
   In Baghdad, about 100 U.S. diplomats and dependents who were
evacuated from the embassy in Kuwait still were unable to leave
Iraq.
   ``Their situation has not changed,'' a U.S. official told The
Associated Press in Washington.
   The group had been guaranteed safe passage. But en route to
Baghdad from Kuwait City, the Iraqis imposed new regulations
barring the departure of diplomats whose embassies remained open
despite Saddam's order that they be closed Friday.
   Subsequently, the Iraqi news agency reported the dependents
could leave. The State Department planned to evacuate them to
Turkey today, but they remained in the Iraqi capital while U.S.
diplomats took up the situation with the Iraqi foreign ministry,
the officials in Washington said.
   In other developments today, the White House applauded the
United Nations vote to allow military enforcement of trade
sanctions against Baghdad, saying the move ``further strengthens
the world resolve to force Iraq out of Kuwait.''
   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater also hailed Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev's ``strong support'' of the sanctions,
calling it ``a very important development.''
   At the Pentagon, officials announced that elements of the 48th
Tactical Fighter Wing were being deployed to Saudi Arabia from
their base at RAF Lakenheath in Great Britain.
   The wing will deploy F-111 aircraft, which are long-range
bombers, associated personnel and equipment to support the U.S.
Central Command forces in Operation Desert Shield. F-111s from
Britain were used in the raids against Libya.
   Fitzwater, in a written statement released at this rainy resort
where President Bush is in the third week of a crisis-clouded
vacation, said:
   ``President Gorbachev's statement (Friday) supporting the United
Nations sanctions was a very important development. We welcome his
voice to the world condemnation of the aggression by Saddam
Hussein.''
   Fitzwater added that the U.N. Security Council resolution
adopted early today ``further strengthens the world resolve to
force Iraq out of Kuwait. We are encouraged by the progress of
events at the United Nations and by President Gorbachev's strong
support.''
   Gorbachev sent an urgent message Friday to Saddam urging him to
comply with the U.N. orders to get out of Kuwait, and warning that
the situation in the gulf was ``extremely dangerous.''
   Bush stayed out of the public eye today, fishing from his
speedboat Fidelity despite a morning downpour.
   The resolution by the 15-member Security Council passed with 13
votes in favor and Yemen and Cuba abstaining. It calls on nations
with naval forces in the Persian Gulf region ``to use such measures
commensurate to the specific circumstances as may be necessary
under the authority of the Security Council to halt all inward and
outward maritime.''
   Fitzwater said:
   ``The unanimous vote further underlines the deep concern of the
world community regarding the blatant aggression by Iraq against
Kuwait. The resolve of the international community is strong.''
   Iraq overran Kuwait Aug. 2 and annexed the emirate six days
later.
   The Soviets had said they would back a U.S. resolution calling
for ``minimum force'' to stop all shipping to and from Iraq.
   As U.S. Ambassador Thomas Pickering was marshaling support for
that resolution at the U.N. on Friday, the White House charged that
Iraq was circumventing the sanctions in a variety of ways,
including ``aviation shipments into Baghdad.''
   Fitzwater said called Iraq's refusal to let all the diplomats
out ``a further step in the harassment that (Saddam) has
undertaken.''
   At least 20 countries kept their Kuwait embassies open in
defiance of Saddam's edict. The British and Greek embassies
previously reported they had no electricity or water, and troops
surrounded a number of Western embassies and the Japanese embassy.
   Thousands of American troops and an armada of warships are
within range of Iraq and Kuwait, but Bush has given no hint how he
might respond if Saddam attempts to overrun the embassy.
   The Navy announced on Saturday that it had called up 127 reserve
units.
   The Marine guards at the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait left in the
convoy, signalling that U.S. officials had no intention of
resisting any Iraqi effort to storm the building.

   Freed Irish hostage Brian Keenan said
today he had seen American hostages Terry Anderson and Thomas
Sutherland and other Westerners during his four-year captivity in
Lebanon.
   Keenan, 39, looking pale but otherwise physically fit, was
turned over to Irish Foreign Minister Gerry Collins today, almost
24 hours after he was freed by his captors.
   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, was abducted March 16, 1985. He is the longest held of the
13 Westerners still believed held by Moslem zealots in Lebanon.
   ``I saw Terry Anderson some time ago,'' Keenan said, without
specifying when. ``He's in good form. He received messages from his
fiance and he appreciates the letters that he received from his
family.''
   He said he also saw Sutherland, who was kidnapped June 9, 1985,
and British hostage John McCarthy, grabbed April 17, 1986.
   He did not specify when he last saw Sutherland, 56, of Fort
Collins, Colo., but said he was with McCarthy, 33, ``only two
nights ago.''
   About Sutherland, he said, ``He's well. He has told us an entire
repertoire of jokes also several times, and Dr. Sutherland is in
good health and regularly exercising.''
   He said McCarthy, a reporter for the London-based Worldwide
Television News, was also well.
   ``His great sense of humor succeeded very early in driving me
slightly insane. John's good humor mimickly was very much
appreciated and brought in all of us who came in contact with him a
real sense of the outside world,'' Keenan added.
   Of Anderson, he said: ``He has a picture of his daughter,
Sulome, which is some great companionship for him.''
   Anderson has never seen Sulome, 5, who was born almost three
months after he was kidnapped. He is among six Americans, two West
Germans and an Italian also remaining in captivity in Lebanon.
   Anderson's sister Peggy Say, told of Keenan's comments, said:
``I'm anxious to talk to Brian and to get more details about
Terry's mental, emotional and physical health.''
   ``Of course, I'm very pleased for the Keenan sisters and their
family. But unfortunately, our experience has been in the past that
when a single hostage is released, that doesn't nercessarily mean
that we are going to see another one for some time _ six months and
sometimes years,'' she said by telephone from her home in Kentucky.
   Keenan, who held a news conference at the home of the Dutch
Ambassador Gerben Meihuizen, read a handwritten statement to
reporters but took no questions.
   Keenan was turned over to the Irish foreign minister at the
Syrian Foreign Ministry. Keenan's sisters, Eliane Spence and Brenda
Gillham, also were waiting in the compound.
   Kenaan, his hair cut short and his beard neatly trimmed,
struggled to hold back tears as he sat between his sisters on a
sofa in the Syrian foreign minister's office.
   ``I am delighted to be with my sisters,'' he said, his voice
choking.
   Collins, Mrs. Spence and Mrs. Gillham had flown in from Dublin
an hour earlier. They were accompanied by a doctor and a nurse.
They drove first to the home of the Dutch ambassador, then to the
ministry.
   Keenan was the fifth Western hostage released in as many months.
   A little-known group calling itself The Organization of the
Islamic Dawn had said the teacher was being freed Friday, and
Ireland later confirmed Keenan had been handed over to Syrian army
officers in Beirut, the Lebanese capital.
   Keenan was kidnapped April 11, 1986 in west Beirut while walking
to the American University where he taught English. He was born in
Belfast and was traveling on an Irish passport, but he has dual
Irish-British citizenship.
   A statement by the Irish government said ``everyone in Ireland
is overjoyed'' at the news of Keenan's release.
   Britain's Foreign Office also expressed delight and said Britain
welcomed the helpful role played by Syria and Iran in Keenan's
release and looked to their ``undoubted influence'' to ensure the
release of other hostages.
   These include Church of England envoy Terry Waite, who
disappeared in Beirut in 1987 while trying to negotiate the release
of other hostages, and McCarthy, Alec Collett and Jack Mann.
   Collins had told a news conference Friday he hoped Keenan's
release would signal the start of the release of all other
hostages, and the Irish government intended to work toward that aim.
   Until the kidnappers' statement Friday, no group had claimed
responsibility for Keenan from the time he was abducted until he
was freed.
   The only other statement on hostages to come from The
Organization of Islamic Dawn was when it announced April 30 it was
releasing Frank Reed, an education administrator born in Malden,
Mass.
   Hostage Robert Polhill of New York was freed April 22, and two
Swiss Red Cross workers, Elio Erriquez and Emmanuel Christen, were
freed this month.
   In London, Sky News television said on Friday that Reed, held
with Keenan for almost three years, was to fly from Washington to
greet Keenan on his arrival at Dublin.
   Reed, 57, promised after his release following 44 months of
captivity that he would be with Keenan when the Irishman was freed.

<HEAD>Iraq Reported Reviving Nuclear Project, Increasing Poison Gas
Output</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GENE KRAMER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq not only has become a major poison gas
producer, but also has revived efforts to make atomic weapons,
which were thwarted by Israel's 1981 bombing of a nuclear reactor,
a report says.
   President Saddam Hussein's government each year turns out more
than 1,000 tons of chemical warfare agents, including
blister-causing mustard gas and nerve gas, according to ``Sword of
the Arabs,'' a survey of Iraqi weaponry to be issued shortly by the
Washington Institute for Near East Policy, a private research
organization.
   Sustained production at that level would give Iraq the world's
largest chemical weapons stockpile if the United States and Soviet
Union carry out obligations of a treaty they signed last June to
reduce their stocks to 5,000 tons by the year 2002. Current U.S.
stockpiles are estimated at 30,000 tons, while the Soviets have an
estimated 50,000.
   Iraq also has an active program to make germ weapons even though
it has signed but not ratified a 1972 treaty prohibiting
development or possession of biological weapons, said the report,
obtained by The Associated Press.
   After Israel bombed Iraq's Osiraq reactor in 1981, the Iraqi
nuclear weapons project remained dormant until 1987 when Baghdad
turned to the gas centrifuge method of enriching uranium fuel, the
study said.
   This could provide the ability to produce nuclear weapons in
five to 10 years depending the amount of equipment and technology
Iraq continues to draw from abroad, it added.
   Long before that, however, Iraq could make one or two small,
low-yield atomic bombs using 12.5 kilograms (27.5 pounds) of
French-supplied uranium in its possession, said report author
Michael Eisenstadt.
   That uranium, however, is subject to international inspection
and its diversion to weapons would be a formal breach of the
Non-Proliferation Treaty signed by Iraq, provoking international
censure and making it harder for Baghdad to acquire equipment and
technology for the other process.
   Eisenstadt said Iraq was unlikely at this time to opt for the
crude, smaller bombs.
   The gas centrifuge method, used by Pakistan and Brazil, is easy
to disperse and conceal and ``might enable Iraq to clandestinely
develop a nuclear weapons production capability while formally
preserving its credentials as a signatory of the NPT (treaty),'' he
said.
   Predicting that Iraq will stockpile chemical ``and possibly
biological weapons for the foreseeable future,'' Eisenstadt said
Iraq in the near future is expected to produce chemical missile
warheads, ``vastly increasing the lethality of its strategic
forces.''
   Such capabilities enable Iraq to coerce its smaller neighbors
and increasingly to deal with Israel ``from a position of
strength,'' he said, noting inputs of Soviet, Chinese, West German,
Austrian, Italian, Argentine, Egyptian and Swiss technology in
Iraqi missile development.
   Development of strike systems capable of reaching Israel ``has
led to the emergence of an uneasy deterrent relationship between
Iraq and Israel,'' he said. ``Israel now has to consider that a
preventive strike against Iraq could prompt retaliation and produce
unacceptable losses. Iraq's strategic deterrent thus produces a
protective umbrella for its nuclear weapons program.''
   Eisenstadt, a research fellow in political-military affairs at
the Washington Institute, also works as a civilian analyst for U.S.
Army Intelligence and is a reserve Army intelligence officer. The
Institute has a declared policy of promoting wide-ranging, informed
debate about the Middle East. While regarded as supportive of
strong U.S.-Iraeli relations the institute office said it receives
no Israeli funds.
   Its advisory board includes former Secretaries of State George
Shultz and Alexander Haig, former Vice President Walter Mondale,
former U.N. Ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick, U.S. News and World
Report Editor Mortimer Zuckerman, former Assistant Defense
Secretary Richard Perle and Stuart Eizenstat, counsel to former
President Jimmy Carter.

   After struggling for weeks to fix
fuel leaks, NASA intends to try once again this week to send
Columbia up to study some of the hottest objects in the universe.
   The shuttle, sporting new hydrogen lines, is scheduled to lift
off at 1:17 a.m. EDT Saturday with seven astronauts and the $150
million Astro observatory. The countdown is due to begin early
Wednesday.
   As Columbia orbits 218 miles above Earth, Astro will probe
high-energy ultraviolet light and X-rays emitted from stars,
galaxies, quasars, even a comet and supernova. Such radiation is
invisible from the ground.
   The mission, scheduled to last nine to 10 days, will be the
first in five years devoted entirely to scientific research.
   It also will be the first shuttle flight since Discovery carried
the flawed Hubble Space Telescope into orbit in April. That's the
longest gap between missions since flights resumed following the
1986 Challenger disaster.
   ``We're certainly aware we will be getting a lot more public
attention. Will that affect what we're doing? Not at all,'' said
Jeffrey Hoffman, one of four astronomers on board to operate Astro.
``We were always going at it 105 percent.''
   Columbia originally was scheduled to lift off with Astro in
March 1986; one of the targets was to have been Halley's Comet.
That mission and all others were put on hold after Challenger
exploded in January 1986.
   This year, after a revamping of Astro's observation plans,
launch was set for May 30, but hydrogen escaped from Columbia
during fueling and the flight was called off.
   Atlantis took Columbia's place at the pad but also was found to
have a hydrogen leak, and its classified military mission was
delayed from July to November.
   Atlantis was rolled back to the hangar 2{ weeks ago, and a newly
repaired Columbia reclaimed the pad.
   ``Yeah, it's frustrating,'' Hoffman said, noting all the delays.
``One of the things that you absolutely need in this business is
patience and also the ability not to take all of these things
personally.''
   Besides coping with leaky shuttles, the space agency has spent
the past several months investigating the cause of Hubble's
blemished mirror.
   More recently, National Aeronautics and Space Administration
engineers have been struggling with the periodic loss of radio
contact with the Venus-orbiting Magellan spacecraft.
   Consequently, NASA expresses eagerness for success.
   ``Everyone is very anxious for our mission to go very well,''
said Gene Urban, deputy mission scientist for Astro. ``We're really
a little nervous, I'd say, about having everything work right.''
   ``I'm worried that it normally comes in threes, so maybe I have
two more to go'' following Hubble, said Charles Pellerin Jr.,
NASA's director of astrophysics.
   Scientists' main concern with Astro is the instrument pointing
system for the three ultraviolet telescopes. The pointing system
has been used only once before, for solar observations in 1985, and
numerous problems were encountered.
   About half of the 150 or so objects Astro will observe _ some of
them millions of degrees _ will be new this time around, said
mission scientist Ted Gull. Many of the May targets had to be
replaced because they got too close to the sun for the instruments
to see.
   Columbia's flight will be the first of five Spacelab missions
dedicated to a single subject _ astrophysics.
   Among the questions astronomers hope Astro will answer on its
first outing are how much helium existed shortly after the universe
was created, and what powers quasars, the most distant objects in
the universe.
   Columbia's crew is taking advantage of the mission's scientific
focus to conduct ``Space Classroom,'' the first of what NASA hopes
will become a regular series for youngsters. More than 40 middle
school students at two NASA centers will question the astronauts
through a two-way audio link.
   The crew hopes to contact the two cosmonauts aboard space
station Mir by ham radio, marking the first time direct radio
communications is made between a U.S. and Soviet spacecraft.
   Payload specialist Ron Parise, a licensed ham radio operator,
also plans to contact amateur radio stations around the world.
   Commanding the mission is Vance Brand, who at age 59 will become
the oldest astronaut to fly in space.

<HEAD>Canadian Rail Trestle Damaged by Fire after Violent Police-Indian
Clash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SETON PORTAGE, British Columbia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A railroad trestle was
severely damaged by fire after the Royal Canadian Mounted Police
clashed with Indian demonstrators and dismantled their rail
blockade.
   Almost half the 165-foot railroad across the Portage River on BC
Rail's main line was severely charred before volunteer firefighters
extinguished the blaze, which began late Friday. The bridge is at
Seton Portage near Lillooet, about 115 miles northeast of Vancouver.
   No damage estimate was available. There were no fire-related
injuries, authorities said.
   About five hours earlier, police officers armed with clubs
stormed about 150 Indians blocking the main road through Seton
Portage to protest arrests at the rail blockade, which was
dismantled earlier in the day.
   As police dogs on leashes snarled and two helicopters hovered
overhead, the officers charged about 150 men, women and children
standing at the barricade.
   The dogs, led by officers yelling, ``Get 'em! Get 'em!'' plunged
into the crowd. Some protesters threw rocks at the officers. The
confrontation lasted about 10 minutes.
   The roadway and rail blockades are being used to show area
native support for Mohawks clashing with authorities in Oka,
Quebec, and to call attention to native land claims.
   Police said arson was suspected in the trestle blaze, which BC
Rail officials said will indefinitely halt traffic on the main line
serving British Columbia's resource-rich interior.
   An Indian leader denied native involvement in the fire.
   ``There's no question it was set but I know it wasn't done by
one of our members,'' said Rod Louie, Seton Lake Indian band chief.
``I've indicated to BC Rail our fight isn't with them. It's with
the federal and provincial governments.''
   The rail blockade on BC Rail's main line that was dismantled a
few hours before the confrontation had been erected late Thursday.
The 3-foot-high blockade of timber and rocks was the second rail
blockade to be dismantled in a week.
   Sixteen people were arrested at the rail blockade. Fifteen were
charged with violating a court injunction against such blockades
and one was charged with obstruction.

   Marchers protesting political
violence and alleged police bias paraded through several cities
Saturday to demand government action to restore peace.
   Some 250 women of all races of the African National Congress
Women's League marched to parliament to present demands, including
an immediate halt to black factional fighting.
   The Women's League organized similar marches around the country
and drew even larger crowds in Port Elizabeth, on the southern
coast, and Pietermaritzburg, in Natal Province.
   More than 5,000 blacks have been killed in Natal Province since
1985 in clashes between the Zulu-led conservative Inkatha movement
and ANC-affiliated groups.
   The clashes spread to black townships around Johannesburg on
Aug. 12, leaving more than 500 people dead. On Friday, the
government declared the Johannesburg area townships ``unrest
areas,'' which gave police widespread powers to suppress the
violence.
   The marchers claimed thousands of lives would have been saved if
the government had taken effective steps earlier.
   ``Had the conflict been in white residential areas or if the
victims had been predominantly white, immediate steps would have
been taken to end the conflict,'' said Nomatyala Hangana of the
Women's League.
   The marchers also contended that police failed to protect black
communities and had shown ``extreme partiality'' toward Inkatha
members. Police and government officials have denied such charges.
   The marchers demanded a judicial commission of inquiry into the
violence; that security forces play an ``effective and impartial
role as peacekeepers;'' and creation of a crisis fund to help
families repair damaged and looted homes.
   In a separate protest, several hundred people marched to the
headquarters of the government-operated South African Broadcasting
Corp. in Johannesburg to protest what organizers called secret and
partial decision-making on restructuring.
   The protesters demanded a government-appointed task force on the
restructuring be disbanded. They also demanded impartial
broadcasting, union organizing at the corporation, racially
balanced hiring and promotion policies, and an end to censorship.

   About 40 youths scaled gates at an
amphitheater during a concert by the rap group Public Enemy and
randomly assaulted concert-goers and security guards, police said.
   Thirty people were treated for minor injuries at first aid
stations after the attacks Friday Shoreline Amphitheatre, said Lt.
Gary Smith. Three others, including one police officer, were
treated and released from El Camino Hospital, he said.
   The assaults in the outer plaza of the amphitheater apparently
did not disrupt the concert, which was attended by an estimated
8,000 people, Smith said.
   About 55 officers from Mountain View, a city approximately 20
miles south of San Francisco, and other police agencies were
assigned to security at the amphitheater, but no arrests were made,
Smith said.
   Victims told police the attackers were members of a gang, but
Smith said no gang affiliation was confirmed. None of the attackers
apparently was armed, Smith said.
   ``It was strictly with their fists. Some people didn't know what
they had been hit with,'' Smith said. There was no indication
robbery was a motive, he said.
   Messages left on answering machines of two of the group's
publicists seeking comment on Saturday were not immediately
returned.
   Public Enemy, whose recordings have been banned in some cities,
was performing as part of a ``Sizzling Summer Tour 90'' that
included the groups Digital Underground and Big Daddy Kane.

<HEAD>U.N. Resolution on Iraq Could Mean New Life for Moribund Military
Body</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Since 1946, the officers of the U.N.
Military Staff Committee have gathered doggedly every two weeks to
formally confirm that there is no work for their moribund group to
do.
   Suddenly, their role may change.
   The U.N. resolution passed Saturday, authorizing the use of
force to carry out an embargo against Iraq, asks member states to
coordinate their actions ``as appropriate'' through the Military
Staff Committee.
   The resolution didn't say precisely what the committee should
do. It could conceivably be a center for exchanging intelligence,
or just receive reports of individual nations' activities.
   But the resolution is likely to give some visibility and a new
lease on life to what had been one of the United Nations' most
obscure institutions.
   The committee consists of senior military officers from United
States, Soviet Union, China, Britain and France, the five permanent
members of the Security Council. Since the committee's founding, it
has met twice a month for about 20 minutes, often in a basement
conference room, to officially take note that the Security Council
hasn't ordered it to do anything.
   Meanwhile, on the 38th floor of U.N. Headquarters, civil
servants have coordinated the U.N. forces the world is already used
to _ the 15,000 peacekeepers assigned to trouble spots worldwide.
   The civilian secretariat members run the peacekeeping troops in
a hierarchy completely separate from the Military Staff Committee.
   Under the U.N. Charter, the Military Staff Committee was to
command any combined military force that the Security Council would
establish.
   But the committee quickly became moribund because of the Cold
War. During the Korean conflict, the United Nations assigned
military command of U.N. forces to the United States, instead of
attempting to activate the Military Staff Committee.
   Diplomats have favored continued meetings of the staff committee
on the grounds that abandoning them would symbolize an end to the
hope that the United Nations would ever be able to organize joint
military action.
   The U.N. missions of the five powers pay the salaries of the
officers assigned to it.

   Reports filtering out of Baghdad tell of
panic buying, rationing and house-to-house sweeps by militiamen
hunting food hoarders as Iraq begins to feel the bite of the U.N.
trade embargo.
   On Saturday, the U.N. Security Council approved military action
to enforce the embargo imposed Aug. 6 to punish Saddam Hussein for
invading and annexing Kuwait.
   It could be weeks before Iraqis really have to tighten their
belts.
   But even before the sanctions were given sharper teeth, reports
out of Iraq said essentials such as cooking oil, flour and fruit
have virtually disappeared in the capital city of Baghdad and other
areas.
   Armed units of the ruling Ba'th Party's militia, the People's
Guard, were conducting random checks of stores and homes, looking
in freezers and cupboards for surplus stocks, the dissident Kurdish
Democratic Party said in a statement released in Nicosia.
   The reports were confirmed by sources in Baghdad, where about a
quarter of Iraq's 17 million people live.
   Since Aug. 12, when Saddam told the nation to prepare for
austerity, hoarding food and profiteering have been punishable by
death.
   For the last three days, government agents have been conducting
a census in Baghdad to prepare for national rationing based on the
number of people in each family, according to sources who spoke on
condition they not be identified.
   Militiamen and soldiers patrolled Baghdad's streets to disperse
crowds of more than five people, the sources said.
   Government ministers and the official media have been asking
people to reduce their consumption of some foods, while assuring
them that Iraq has sufficient stockpiles to last months, the
sources said.
   Exiled Iraqis and experts have varied opinions about how much
food Iraq has on hand and how long it will last. The only certainty
is that the country requires food imported with oil revenue.
   Last year, Iraq spent $2.9 billion importing 75 percent of what
its people ate.
   With oil exports, Saddam's main source of revenue, now largely
cut off, Iraq faces a harsh winter if it does not withdraw from
Kuwait.
   ``The most important thing is the oil embargo,'' said Selim
Fakhri, a former colonel in the Iraqi army and a leading figure in
the resistance alliance in exile.
   ``Food is still coming in through Jordan, perhaps Yemen and
Lebanon. But if Iraq can't sell its oil, then there will come a
time when the country will not be able to pay for anything, even if
it can bring it in.
   ``Without oil, the country grinds to a halt. I give it no more
than a couple of months,'' he said in a telephone interview from
London.
   Throughout the 1980-88 war with Iran and after, Iraq bought most
of its food from the United States, Canada and Australia, all now
committed to the embargo.
   In the 12 months ending June 30, Iraq bought 2.5 million tons of
wheat, barley, rice and corn from the United States, said Jonathan
Crusoe, an analyst with the Middle East Economic Digest. U.S. corn
accounted for 650,000 tons of total Iraqi imports of 750,000 tons.
   Last year, however, the U.S. Agriculture Department reduced
credit to Iraq, which then started seeking other suppliers of
cotton, tobacco, wool, cattle hides and tallow.
   Around 100,000 tons of wheat had been ordered from the European
Community for shipment in August and October, Crusoe said.
   Turkey, which supplied its southeastern neighbor with citrus
fruits, tomato paste, lentils, chickpeas and cotton, could have
helped fill Iraq's import gap, but joined the embargo on Aug. 8.
   Some U.S. agencies estimate that Iraq has enough wheat to last
two months, rice for three months and corn for less than two weeks.
All these stocks could be extended substantially by rationing.
   The eight-year war with Iran left its scars on Iraq's
agricultural sector. But the real damage was done by 20 years of
tight socialist control of the economy.
   Farmland between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers was ravaged. A
campaign against rebellious Kurds in the fertile north resulted in
the forcible relocation of tens of thousands of peasants.
   Even with the international military action to halt shipping to
Iraq, some food still may get through. U.N. Resolution 661 allows
food on humanitarian grounds.
   But President Bush's goal is ``total economic deprivation.'' To
be successful, he said, ``this embargo is going to be
all-encompassing, and it will include food.''

   Pennsylvania's anti-abortion advocates
promised to restore restrictions overturned by a federal judge and
predicted ultimate victory in the courts.
   ``The big enchilada is the U.S. Supreme Court and we're going to
win,'' said Rep. Gerard Kosinsky, one of the Legislature's most
vocal anti-abortion supporters.
   In a 191-page ruling issued Friday, U.S. District Judge Daniel
H. Huyett III struck down provisions of Pennsylvania's abortion law
that would have required a woman to notify her husband and to wait
24 hours before getting an abortion, and would have forced minors
to obtain a parent's consent or a court order.
   Women's rights groups proclaimed victory after the ruling, but
expressed concern the Pennsylvania law could become the case that
would lead to the overturning the U.S. Supreme Court's 1973 Roe vs.
Wade decision legalizing abortion.
   Kathryn Kolbert, the American Civil Liberties Union lawyer who
argued the case, said it could reach the nation's highest court by
fall 1991. She said the case ``continues to pose an ominous threat
to reproductive freedom nationwide.''
   Pennsylvania's law was considered the nation's most restrictive
state statute. The nation's most stringent law _ enacted in the
U.S. territory of Guam _ banned all abortions except when a woman's
life was in danger and also made it illegal to recommend a woman
have an abortion. A federal judge threw it out it Thursday.
   A stringent anti-abortion bill was passed this year by the
Louisiana Legislature, but the governor vetoed it after the
legislative session ended and legislators rejected a move for a
special session.
   A spokesman for Pennsylvani state Attorney General Ernie Preate
Jr. said an appeal seeking to uphold the law here would be filed
with the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.
   Abortion-rights activists said Huyett's decision proved the law
was unconstitutional and that the Pennsylvania Legislature was out
of sync with voters.
   ``We feel it was the best decision we could have gotten,'' said
Jenny Daughtry, executive director of the National Abortion Rights
Action League. ``It was a very sensible and courageous decision.
Judge Huyett saw through the anti-choice rhetoric and spoke to the
lives of real women harmed by the restrictions.''
   Ms. Daughtry said her group is working to defeat anti-abortion
legislative candidates in the upcoming November election,
particularly Rep. Stephen Freind, the Legislature's chief abortion
opponent.
   Contacted by the Delaware County Times at the New Jersey shore,
Freind said: ``No doubt we are going to win in the Supreme Court.
I'm not the slightest bit discouraged. Everything is happening the
way we thought it would happen.''
   Rep. Karen Ritter, the state's most vocal abortion-rights
legislator, said she was pleased by the ruling but concerned that
women's reproductive freedom could be threatened nationwide.
   ``We are concerned that we may have problems keeping abortion
safe and legal in the United States, not just in Pennsylvania,''
she said.
   Howard Fetterhoff, executive director of the Pennsylvania
Catholic Conference, said the decision could not be viewed as a
significant setback because he predicted it would ultimately be
reviewed by the U.S. Supreme Court.
   ``For those people who think abortion is a legitimate medical
procedure, (the law) does pose burdens. But for those of us who
believe unborn children are deserving of legal protection ... the
law does as much as it can under present circumstances to protect
the unborn child,'' Fetterhoff said.

   It was a night for sushi and tears as arts
supporters rallied to denounce government censorship and plot a
lawsuit against the National Endowment for the Arts for rejecting
grants to a quartet of avant-garde theater performers.
   Two of the stage artists, Holly Hughes of New York and Tim
Miller of Los Angeles, enlivened the fund-raising party Friday
night with ribald monologues that heaped scorn on NEA Chairman John
E. Frohnmayer and Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C.
   The mood of the party was dampened by word that Frohnmayer had
just denied the appeals of the four performers _ Ms. Hughes,
Miller, Karen Finley of New York and John Fleck of Los Angeles _
whose grants he had vetoed in late June.
   Ms. Hughes said Frohnmayer was using the four rejected grantees
as ``sacrificial lambs'' to appease Helms and other conservative
members of Congress who oppose federal support for works they
regard as obscene and sacrilegious.
   Ms. Finley, whose performances sometimes include smearing her
body with chocolate and filling her bra with gelatin, didn't make
the party. But she issued a statement in New York charging that
Frohnmayer's decision amounted to government censorship of the arts.
   ``This only underscores that we are being punished for the
controversial content of our work,'' she said. ``The government
wants art to be propaganda for the state, and we're not willing to
do that.''
   The non-profit Center for Constitutional Rights of New York said
the NEA had disclosed Frohnmayer's decision in letters received
Friday. ``As in its initial denial letters, the NEA gives no
substantive reasons for the denials,'' the center said.
   The center said it would represent the four performers in a
lawsuit in federal court charging that Frohnmayer's decision was
based on political rather than aesthetic grounds and violates their
First Amendment free-speech rights.
   Last October, after criticism of NEA support for exhibitions of
controversial images by photographer Robert Mapplethorpe and artist
Andres Serrano, Congress voted to prohibit the arts endowment from
using federal funds to support works that ``may be deemed obscene.''
   Frohnmayer warned a meeting of arts professionals in Seattle in
late June that ``political realities'' might force him to veto some
grants recommended by NEA review panels.
   Two days later, on June 29, he rejected panel-approved grants
for Ms. Finley, Ms. Hughes, Miller and Fleck.
   At Friday's party, about 200 people used chopsticks to munch on
sushi and spring rolls as Charlotte Murphy, executive director of
the non-profit National Association of Artists' Organizations,
tearfully told the gathering that her group would press ``the fight
against censorship, especially censorship based on politics, racism
and homophobia.''
   Public performances by such ``solo performance artists'' as the
four rejected NEA grantees frequently include monologues or songs
with explicit sexual content that deal with politics, racial
bigotry and sexual oppression.
   Each of the four had received NEA grants in the past, but their
performances have been singled out recently by conservative
lawmakers and religious fundamentalists as examples of the arts
endowment's willingness to subsidize offensive material.
   Ms. Hughes said the four rejected grants totaled about $23,000,
a minuscule share of the NEA's current $171 million budget.
   The next time she needs financial support, Ms. Hughes
deadpanned, she will skip the NEA and apply to the Silverado
savings and loan in Denver for $100 million to build a resort
hotel, with a multimillion-dollar golf course financed by the
Department of Housing and Urban Development.
   ``When the whole thing goes belly-up, it'll be the taxpayers'
problem,'' she said with a laugh. ``The government will bail me
out, and I'll be free.''
   Silverado, whose directors included President Bush's son, Neil
Bush, is a prominent casualty of the current S&amp;L crisis.
Silverado's collapse in December 1988 will result in an estimated
$1 billion in bailout costs to the taxpayers.

   Aunt Marie helps them with their voice projection
and Uncle Donny wrote them a song, but the Osmond Boys say they're
working on their own image.
   ``We grew up around music but we're not trying to copy
anybody,'' leader Michael Osmond, 15, said Saturday before a
performance at the Michigan State Fair.
   The four brothers, Michael, Nathan, 13, Douglas, 12, and David,
11, are sons of Alan Osmond, at 41 the oldest of the defunct Osmond
Brothers, who themselves got their show biz start as youngsters.
The Osmond Boys are on a 70-city tour that ends in mid-November,
when they return home to Utah.
   ``There's a lot of screaming girls,'' Michael said. ``It makes
it a lot more fun on stage.''
   They released an album, ``The Osmond Boys,'' last month that
includes a song written by Donny Osmond, ``Wait on Love.''
   They're developing their own style _ no flashy costumes _ but
Alan Osmond, who manages his Osmond Boys, said it's like reliving
his past.
   ``Everyone says they've got the Osmond smile,'' he said. ``We've
had a lot of screaming girls on this tour.''
   He said he's trying to keep things as normal as possible,
keeping them in their schools back home and faxing homework to
their teachers.

   Six years ago Andrew Dice Clay was
banished from the Las Vegas Strip after one performance because his
act was too raunchy.
   But the Diceman returneth. Clay had three sellout shows at
Bally's resort last week and if Dice fans were fearful of him
cleaning up his act, they need not have worried.
   One woman in the front row became a target for the evening of
sexually explicit shots by the comedian as he graphically described
his sexual appetite and questioned hers.
   Clay said he considers himself ``greatest comic that ever
lived.''
   ``I've created something so unique, so special, people are just
going crazy for it,'' Clay said. ``I'm going to be around for a
long time.''
   He wasn't so confident six years ago when he was bounced from
the lineup at the Comedy Store at the Dunes Hotel, across the Strip
from Bally's, because of his foul language.
   He vowed he would be back and would someday see his name on the
marquee of one of the Strip's glitzy resorts. He realized that goal
when he returned Thursday.
   ``I figured the town just wasn't ready yet,'' he said of his
first experience with Las Vegas.
   When it comes to Dallas, however, Clay apparently feels that
city isn't ready for him. He canceled his Dallas concert because
he's afraid of violating Texas' strict anti-obscenity law, his
publicist said Friday.
   Michael Levine said Clay canceled the show, scheduled for
Sunday, because ``we feared the possibility that Dice might be
subject to arrest, embarrassment and subsequently jailed.''

   Country music star Ronnie Milsap says in
a new book that he has no love for his mother, who abandoned him.
   Milsap, who was born blind, said in his autobiography ``Almost
Like a Song'' that she abandoned him when he was a 1-year-old
infant.
   ``I don't hate her,'' he wrote. ``I have no feelings for her at
all.''
   Milsap said his mother once asked him for money after he became
a successful entertainer.
   ``Why would I want to see her? Motherhood means more than just
giving birth,'' he writes.
   The book, published recently by McGraw-Hill, is named after one
of Milsap's hit records.

   A television news helicopter crashed
while filming the crowd at a concert by the New Kids on the Block.
Two men aboard the aircraft were injured, officials said.
   The KTBS-TV Channel 3 helicopter apparently clipped a power line
and crashed outside Independence Stadium about 6 p.m. Friday as
crowds were gathering for the concert.
   No one on the ground was injured.
   Helicopter pilot Scott Wallace and KTBS photographer Norris
Carden, both of Shreveport, were flying about 15 feet off the
ground around the stadium to film the 25,000 fans arriving to see
the 8 p.m. concert.
   ``They were doing traffic reports and Norris was shooting video
of the lines,'' said KTBS news producer Sharon Rambin. ``I know
they were landing but I don't know what happened.''
   Hana Kanagawa, with a cinematic group from CBS-Sony Japan, saw
the crash.
   ``I saw the helicopter flying, then bursting into the wires,''
she said. ``It wouldn't move. I saw sparks from the wires, and then
it crashed.''
   Wallace suffered cuts and bruises; Carden complained of severe
back pains, said KTBS News Director Andrew Pontz. The men were kept
overnight Willis-Knighton Medical Center for observation.
   The $75,000 helicopter was a total loss, Pontz said.
   The New Kids on Block, known for their intricately choreographed
routines, their cheerful outlook and their anti-drug message, have
had hits such as ``This One's For the Children,'' and ``I'll Be
Loving You Forever.''

<HEAD>Conservation `SWAT Team' Finds Scientific Riches And Plague In
Forest</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A conservation ``SWAT team'' has returned from
an unexplored Bolivian forest with plants unknown to science, tales
of spectacular animals, and a case of bubonic plague.
   The team's trip to northern La Paz province, Bolivia, was the
first test of a method for surveying wilderness areas to determine
whether they are deserving of protection or further study, said
Russell Mittermeier, president of Conservation International in
Washington, D.C., which devised the method.
   The month-long trip by four American field biologists and three
of their counterparts in Bolivia revealed an area with one of the
richest collections of plants and animals on Earth.
   ``It's really confirming that the region may be as diverse as
the Manu National Park (in Peru), which is known to be the richest
protected area on Earth in terms of biological diversity,''
Mittermeier said.
   The SWAT team _ known more properly as a ``RAP team,'' for rapid
assessment program _ found 403 species of birds and 45 species of
mammals, including three not previously known to exist in Bolivia.
They were the spiny tree rat, the big-eared bat and the short-eared
dog.
   ``For me, the most exciting thing was the sighting of this
short-eared dog,'' said Mittermeier. It was spotted by Louise H.
Emmons of the Smithsonian's National Museum of Natural History.
   ``It's an extremely poorly known animal. She actually got a look
at one with a frog in its mouth.'' That was the first observation
ever of the animal feeding in the wild, Mittermeier said.
   Emmons also found something she wasn't looking for: fleas
carrying bubonic plague, the black death of the Middle Ages.
   ``She came back and got sick, and they said `You've got the
plague,''' Mittermeier said. ``They cured it, but she was out of it
for a few weeks.''
   The team also came back with hundreds of plant specimens, which
they are now studying. ``Some of them are likely to be new to
science,'' the team said in its report.
   The RAP team was led by Theodore A. Parker III of Conservation
International and Louisiana State University, who is able to
identify tropical birds from their songs.
   He concluded that the forest in La Paz may contain as many as
1,000 species of birds, or 11 percent of all the species on Earth.
   As a result of the RAP team's findings, ``the idea is to
recommend some sort of protection for the area,'' said Mittermeier.
   The development of the RAP teams is part of Conservation
International's effort to rapidly assess and protect what it calls
the world's most important conservation hot spots.
   ``Science can proceed at a glacial pace, but forest destruction
is spreading like wildfire,'' Mittermeier said. The RAP teams, he
said, are ``cutting-edge biology'' that ``can put us one step ahead
of deforestation.''

<HEAD>State Denies Convicted Judge A Pension</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge who was convicted of corruption
charges that included haranguing an aide into loaning him $500 was
denied his pension and had more than $150,000 seized.
   The State Employees Retirement Board announced Friday it was
denying pension for former Cambria County Judge Joseph O'Kicki. His
retirement fund from 17 years on the bench, totaling $156,299, also
was seized.
   The money will be used to pay $50,000 in fines O'Kicki owes and
other costs, the board said. State Attorney General Ernie Preate
Jr. has filed a claim in county court asking O'Kicki be held liable
for $96,351 in investigative costs and $42,725 in trial costs.
   Board counsel Abbott A. Leban said he expects the attorney
general will present those costs for payment from O'Kicki's pension
contributions.
   O'Kicki, 59, was convicted in December 1989 for corruption
charges and was sentenced in June to two to five years in prison.
   Prosecutors said the judge improperly solicited a lawyer for a
$500 loan that never was repaid, asked for $500 from an aide who
was promised a promotion that was never granted and had court
aides, clerks and secretaries perform personal chores, such feeding
his dogs and chopping wood.
   Senior Judge Richard Grifo of Northampton County has ordered
O'Kicki to reimburse the state for about $140,000 in salary he
received while he was suspended from the bench.
   O'Kicki has been free on $10,000 bond and planned to appeal his
conviction.
   His lawyer, James Yelovich, was not in his office Friday
afternoon and could not be reached for comment.
   The board said it had not calculated what O'Kicki's pension
would have been if he had been eligible for benefits. The state
contributes an amount equal to 12.3 percent of salary. O'Kicki made
$80,000 a year.

   Soviet authorities on Saturday sought to reassure
smokers that there will be enough tobacco soon, following
increasing public outrage over the worst cigarette shortage in
decades.
   State-run newspapers reported that a Moscow factory had produced
45 million cigarettes in the previous 24 hours. The newspapers said
a special command post was ensuring that the packs made it to
tobacco kiosks instead of black marketeers, and that authorities
were cracking down on such speculators.
   Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov tried to calm the nation's
smokers _ estimated at 70 million out of a population of 285 milion
_ on national television Friday night by similarly pledging that
more cigarettes, both domestic and imported, were on the way.
   Ryzhkov also dodged responsibility for the crisis, saying that
the shortage was not the fault of the central government but the
leadership of the individual Soviet republics. He also blamed
panic-buying by the public.
   Beneath a banner headline pleading ``Government, give us a
smoke!'' Saturday's Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper devoted its
entire front page to the crisis, chronicling the various ``tobacco
rebellions'' around the Soviet Union since July and reporting that
an American pack of Marlboros would bring up to $32 on the black
market in Moscow.
   The actions underscored how seriously national and local
authorities are taking the summer-long cigarette shortage,
especially after an upsurge in street demonstrations by angry
smokers in Moscow and Leningrad.
   On Wednesday, scores of people blocked a street next to the
Kremlin, the seat of Soviet power, until a nearby tobacco kiosk was
restocked.
   The newspaper Moskovskaya Pravda reported that Muscovites will
be getting ration coupons for tobacco products as a temporary,
two-to three-month measure to combat hoarding and black market
speculation.
   The newspaper also said one black marketeer killed a buyer over
a pack of cigarettes in Moscow, but it provided no details.
   Komsomolskaya Pravda said that in the central Siberian city of
Barnaul, one brand of Soviet cigarettes was being sold for 7 rubles
($11.20) on the black market. Soviet cigarettes usually sell for
about 45 kopecks (about 80 cents) per pack.
   The Java cigarette factory, the main one in Moscow, turned out
45 million cigarettes since Friday and a freight car full of
cigarettes from Bulgaria arrived Saturday, the Communist Party
newspaper Pravda reported.
   ``We are trying for the most rational distribution,'' Pravda
quoted Moscow City Council member A. Bobkov as saying. ``We're
sending the bulk of the supply directly to workplaces and
residential areas.''
   In addition, he said the City Council has a ``special duty car''
to deliver a load of cigarettes to any ``hot spot,'' Pravda
reported.
   Police arrested one cigarette delivery truck driver who made an
unscheduled stop and was selling five cases of cigarettes at higher
prices, the newspaper said. He was turned in to police by the
distributor who was to have been the legitimate recipient of the
cigarettes.
   Pravda said a criminal case was opened against a store owner who
had stashed about 16,000 packs of cigarettes under the counter for
resale at higher prices.
   In an interview with Pravda, L. Sinelnikov, director of the Java
factory, disputed the central government's disclaimer of
responsibility for cigarette production.
   He said half of his plant's equipment is obsolete and more than
20 years old. When he informed communist central planners, he said,
he was told the problem was not serious and that the Soviet people
should cut down on their heavy smoking anyway because it is a
health hazard.
   In one corner of its front page, Komsomolskaya Pravda provided a
4-by-4{-inch blank spot to be cut out and used by its readers to
roll their own cigarettes out of the loose, coarse tobacco that is
being sold at some cigarette shops in the absense of proper paper
and filters.
   Printed beneath the blank spot was a sardonic proviso:
``Typographic ink is hazardous to your health. Smoke only in the
appointed place!''

<HEAD>Rikers: `Every Day, a Slowly Brewing Riot'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK HAMPSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Correction officers at Rikers Island call the
3-to-11 shift at the nation's most populous jail ``the war tour.''
And they say the prisoners hold every advantage: in numbers,
weapons and rules.
   Two weeks ago, about 600 guards tried to change the rules. For
two days they blockaded the lone bridge to the island, turning back
food, medical supplies and even the corrections commissioner. They
relented only after city officials agreed to ease restrictions on
use of force against inmates.
   ``Every day, Rikers is a slowly brewing riot,'' said Robert
Gangi, director of the Correctional Association, a private research
group that studies the jail. ``Usually it's the inmates who blow
up, but here it was the COs who blew (by erecting the blockade).
I've never heard of anything like it.''
   The night the blockade ended, inmates in one unit rioted, and
guards who quelled the rebellion allegedly lined up prisoners and
systematically beat them with nightsticks.
   ``We control the jails, not you!'' guards were said to have
shouted.
   When it was over, the injured included 142 inmates and 20 guards.
   Also hurt during that tense two days were eight emergency
medical technicians _ the victims of attacks by guards at the
blockade.
   A second major incident occurred this past week, after an inmate
was stabbed by an unknown assailant Tuesday night. A group of
inmates refused to return to their cells and began setting fires.
By the time order was restored, 25 guards and four inmates had
suffered minor injuries, mostly smoke inhalation.
   Although the blockade seemed to bring the jail to the edge of
chaos, a union spokesman said it was a symptom, not a cause, of
Rikers' malaise.
   ``The officers had come to the conclusion they were in danger,''
said Jim Grossman. ``They simply didn't feel safe anymore.''
   Many never felt safe at a jail where the population doubled to
14,000 in 10 years, where prisoners routinely carry knives and
homemade weapons, where there's an average of a stabbing a day.
   Each month for the past year and a half, the city's jail system
has set a new record for violent incidents.
   Officers who directly supervise prisoners, meanwhile, carry no
weapons.
   ``We don't scare anyone anymore,'' says Phil Seelig, president
of the officers' union.
   The penal complex occupies 440 acres on a chunk of land in the
East River. It houses all sorts of inmates: men and women,
juveniles and adults, the convicted and the accused, the celebrated
and the unknown.
   Always a violent, crowded place, Rikers in recent years has been
flooded by an influx of drug outlaws, many of whom form gangs
within the jail. Increasingly, the balance between order and
anarchy has been determined by the prisoners themselves.
   Confronted with an exploding jail population, the city opted for
relatively inexpensive and easily constructed open dormitories
rather than conventional concrete and steel cell blocks. Each dorm
accommodates about 50 inmates.
   In an interview published in Saturday's editions of The New York
Times, Allyn R. Sielaff, who took over the city's jail system in
March, criticized previous administrations for what he sees as
spending too much energy expanding the jails and not enough on
programs to make it safer.
   ``The dormitories were the quickest structures to put up, and
the cheapest,'' he said. ``But they're the toughest structures to
supervise.''
   He also said he intends to reverse conditions at Rikers Island
in which guards are swiftly punished for the most minor infractions
while inmates get put on a waiting list.
   ``When an inmate stabs or slashes somebody, when he attacks an
officer, one should expect he would be taken out of the general
population,'' Sielaff said. ``We had 500 stabbers and slashers
mingling with the rest of the population.''
   But he also said that hiring standards for corrections officers
have been too lax in recent years.
   Meanwhile, a federal judge is considering a new set of rules on
the use of force by jail guards.
   The revised guidelines, agreed to by the Correction Department
and Legal Aid attorneys, were submitted for approval Friday to U.S.
District Judge Morris E. Lasker of Manhattan. Lasker scheduled
another hearing next week.
   The Legal Aid Society began the court proceeding after the city
decided to replace a 27-page directive on the use of force with a
streamlined nine-page version as part of a settlement to a job
action by guards at Rikers Island.
   Legal Aid had complained that the nine-page guidelines went too
far in relaxing restraints on guards.
   The subsequent compromise list of rules, said Legal Aid attorney
John Boston, ``restores all the important restrictions while
removing excess verbiage. It is appropriate and serves everyone's
purpose.''
   But Ernesto Marrero, a lawyer for the officers' union, objected
to specific language in the new directive as ``unduly restrictive.''

<HEAD>Police: Hostage Taker Who Got $2,000 Ransom Thought He Would Get
To Keep It</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A man who held a former business adviser hostage
with a hunting rifle for three hours, saying the man's advice had
not paid off, thought he would get to keep the $2,000 he received
as ransom, police said.
   After Charles Edward Jordan accepted the cash from authorities,
he tossed it inside his house, locked the door and surrendered.
   ``I'll be ready to go in a minute,'' Jordan reportedly told
tactical officers who had their weapons leveled at him as he
secured his house Friday in the South Oak Cliff section of Dallas.
   His hostage, Bruce Henry Humphrey of suburban Carrollton, was
released unharmed.
   Jordan knew he was going to jail, ``but he thought he got to
keep the $2,000,'' said Cpl. Joey Fox. Police later retrieved the
money.
   Jordan was charged with aggravated kidnapping and was jailed on
$25,000 bail Saturday.
   The hostage's wife, Fay Humphrey, said that Jordan, using
another name, had called her husband repeatedly last week asking
him to come to the house. Mrs. Humphrey said she and her husband
work for a company that helps people prepare business plans to
present to banks for financing.
   In 1988, Humphrey prepared a business plan for Jordan, charging
him $2,000. Jordan used the plan but failed to find financing.
   The fee for producing the plan was non-refundable, police said.
   Jordan ``felt he had been wronged in a loan approval several
years ago and since then several other things had gone wrong in his
life, like a divorce and some other failed business deals,'' Fox
said. ``I guess he thought that at minimum he could get his $2,000
back.''
   Police didn't know what kind of business Jordan had planned to
open.
   Jordan told Mrs. Humphrey that he wanted $2,000 in return for
her husband's release. She went to a nearby bank branch to call
police. The bank later provided the money that led to Jordan's
release.
   ``He said I wouldn't live to see anything but the inside of his
house if he didn't get $2,000,'' Humphrey said afterward. ``I tried
to talk to him about cars, the weather, anything to calm him down.''

   The all-white Selma Country Club has reversed
itself and extended membership to a Japanese businessman barred
last month amid lingering ill feelings about World War II.
   Hiroshi Isogai, manager of the Honda All-Lock Manufacturing Co.
plant in Selma, was accepted into the club Friday following a vote
by its board of directors earlier in the week.
   The board action overturned an earlier vote by the general
membership, which rejected Isogai's application to join the golf
club. Some members blamed the first vote on resentment dating back
to Japan's 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor.
   City Council President Carl Morgan, a member of the club,
saluted directors for their decision.
   ``I guess there still are people out there who are fighting
World War II,'' said Morgan, who served in the Army in Europe
during the war. ``As for me, I wouldn't blackball a German.''
   Telephone calls to Isogai's home and office went unanswered
Saturday.
   Isogai, 55, was 10 years old when World War II ended. In an
interview after his initial rejection, Isogai said he just wanted
to play golf at the club.
   ``I don't want to say much about this,'' he said.
   Shortly after the initial vote, a club member who spoke on
condition of anonymity said Isogai drew ``between 15 and 20''
blackballs against him being admitted to the club. Five no votes
are enough to bar membership.
   One of the club's director, Charles Pollack, declined to discuss
the board's action.
   ``We made a pact not to say anything because we felt the whole
thing had been blown out of proportion,'' said Pollack.
   President Donnie Russell said the club has ``no exclusionary
policies toward any minorities, either written or verbal.'' He
refused to say whether any blacks had ever applied for membership.
   Morgan said although the club has no black members, ``I imagine
that issue will be coming next.''
   The issue of Isogai's membership surfaced about the time the PGA
Championship became embroiled in controversy over the all-white
membership at Birmingham's Shoal Creek Country Club. Following
protests and threats of pickets during the tournament, the club
accepted a black insurance executive as an honorary member.

<TEXT>
   Investigators of a private plane crash that
killed three men have ruled out tainted fuel, weather and
structural failure and believe it will be months before the
accident's cause is determined.
   ``We've taken fuel samples and they are fine,'' Warren V.
Wandell, chief air safety investigator for the National
Transportation Safety Board, said Friday. Structural and weather
problems had been ruled out earlier.
   Three men in the cockpit of the Gulfstream G-159 that crashed
Thursday, including the pilot and co-pilot, were killed; 12
passengers were injured.
   The crash was the second worst at the Houston Intercontinental
Airport. Five people were killed on Feb. 14, 1980, when a
Mitsubishi MU-2 twin-engine crashed.
   On Saturday, crews continued documenting the wreckage and
prepared to move it to a hangar for a detailed analysis.
   The plane, owned by a subsidiary of Houston-based Rowan Drilling
Co., was ferrying to New Orleans a group of offshore oil workers
who had completed a regular two-week tour in the North Sea.
   ``Obviously, we won't know what caused this accident for
months,'' Wandell said. ``Based on initial witness statements from
controllers, it appears to us that for some yet undetermined reason
there was a loss of control shortly after liftoff.''
   It appeared the plane got 30 to 50 feet off the ground, then
veered suddenly to the left, Wandell said. Its left wing tip
touched the ground, crumpling the entire wing.
   Then the propellers came off and the rest of the aircraft
slammed to the earth, scattering wreckage for about 150 yards, he
said.

<TEXT>
   Actor Nicholas Kadi, who played an Arab
terrorist in the film ``Navy SEALs,'' knows the tumultuous Middle
East first hand.
   His father, Nizar El-Kadi, served 22 years as an Iraqi
ambassador and in other diplomatic posts in India, Turkey, Lebanon,
Belgium and the United Nations.
   ``My first Christmas tree was a palm tree. My mother cut off the
top of a tree in Baghdad,'' said Kadi, who was born Nameer El-Kadi
in Istanbul, Turkey.
   Not all his memories of Baghdad are fond ones. At night, the
family slept on the roof to escape the 120-degree heat.
   ``When I was about 5 years old, there was a communist printing
press discovered across the roof from us. About five o'clock in the
morning, I looked over and they were shooting this family right in
front of us.''
   Kadi, 37, has little sympathy for the current Iraqi leader,
Saddam Hussein.
   ``The man is regarded as a Robin Hood in Iraq. For myself, I
just put the emphasis on `hood,''' he said. ``I think (President)
Bush is doing the right thing.''
   Kadi now is an American citizen and lives in the Los Angeles
area with his Scottish-born wife and 3-month-old daughter.
   His ``Navy SEALs'' role of Ben Shaheed was based on an actual
member of the Hezbollah terrorist group.
   ``I was very pleased to finally play a smart terrorist,'' he
said in a telephone interview. ``He had them really running around,
those SEALs.''
   However, Kadi faults Hollywood for failing to flesh out such
characters and explain what led them to terrorism.
   ``To show the very stereotypical, madman Arab is a little
unfair. I sometimes speak to producers about that,'' he said.
   For ``Navy SEALs,'' Kadi spent two months filming in Spain.
   ``We had to shoot in the armpits of Spain because it was
supposed to be burnt-out Beirut,'' he said. ``There were a lot of
drug addicts there. They'd have to clear the set of hypodermic

   Afghan President Najibullah returned
to Kabul on Saturday hours after rockets slammed into the capital
city, killing nine people and wounding 15.
   No one claimed responsibility for the attack, but a Kabul radio
broadcast blamed rebel fighters, headquartered in Pakistan. The
radio was monitored in Islamabad.
   Najibullah's sudden departure for Moscow on July 29 generated
speculation that the United States and the Soviet Union were
hammering out a settlement to the 12-year-old civil war. However,
spokesmen for the superpowers have reported only that the two
nations were closing the gap, with no deal agreed.
   More than 1.5 million people have been killed in the war between
U.S.-backed rebels and Najibullah's communist-style government.
   Until February 1989, Afghan guerrillas were battling more than
115,000 Soviet troops who intervened militarily nine years earlier
to help fight an Islamic insurgency and install a government
friendly to Moscow.
   The Kremlin withdrew its soldiers in line with a U.N.-negotiated
agreement, but sends about $300 million worth of military and
humanitarian aid to Kabul monthly. The United States delivers an
estimated $300 million worth of military supplies to its rebel
allies annually.
   Najibullah left for Moscow, reportedly for medical treatment,
only three days before Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze
and U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III met in the Siberian
city of Irkutsk.
   No details of Najibullah's medical treatment have ever been
given. Shevardnadze told reporters in Irkutsk that Najibullah was
on vacation with his family in the Soviet Union, only adding to the
speculation.
   The two sides ended their meetings in Siberia saying they were
``close'' to a deal on Afghanistan, but nothing was settled.

   Yemen said Saturday it was fully
committed to honoring U.N. economic sanctions on Iraq and denied
reports that Iraqi warplanes are based in that Red Sea country.
   Yemen's information minister, Mohammed Ahmed Garhoum, also
denied reports that Yemen let Iraq fly food and medical supplies
out of the country, or broke any provision of the U.N. embargo
against Iraq.
   Authorities in Yemen also said they ordered a British diplomat
expelled after they caught him Friday taking pictures of military
activities and port facilities in Aden, where Britain argued Yemen
had violated U.N. sanctions against Iraq.
   The British Foreign Office confirmed that Consul General Doug
Gordon had been given 48 hours to leave Yemen.
   Diplomatic sources in the Persian Gulf region, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said Iraq flew 12 captured Kuwaiti jet
fighters to San`a, the Yemeni capital, and that before invading
Kuwait on Aug. 2 it based 36 Soviet-made Iraqi jet fighters at
Ta'ez, 120 miles south of San`a.
   They said Saturday all the planes are still there.
   Garhoum said in a telephone interview that there is ``no basis
whatsoever'' to reports that Yemen is a base for Iraqi warplanes.
   ``There are absolutely no Iraqi warplanes and no Iraqi forces on
any part of Yemeni soil,'' he said.
   Iraq's official news agency also denied that Iraqi warplanes had
been sent to either Yemen or Sudan, as some other news reports
indicated.
   Garhoum added, ``Yemen's stand is very clear, we are committed
... to all aspects of the embargo.'' He said, however, that Yemen
will not impede international navigation by challenging ships.
   The statement was Yemen's most forceful declaration yet it would
abide by the U.N. sanctions on Iraq.
   Yemen and Cuba abstained from a 13-0 Security Council vote
Saturday authorizing use of military force to enforce the embargo.
   The minister denied reports circulating among diplomats in San`a
that Yemen allowed Iraq to fly shipments of food and medicine out
of the country.
   He said Iraq has not requested any shipments of food or
medicine, but left open the possibility of such shipments in the
future. He said terms of the U.N. embargo provide for exempting
food and medicines ``when necessary.''
   In response to a charge by British Foreign Secretary Douglas
Hurd, Garhoum confirmed that the 35,388-ton Iraqi tanker Ain Zalah
unloaded part of its cargo of crude oil at the refinery in Aden
this week. But he said that was before Yemen announced its decision
to abide by the embargo.
   Ain Zalah is one of four Iraqi tankers still anchored off the
oil terminal at Aden.
   The British Foreign Office said it would protest the expulsion
of Gordon. A Foreign Office spokesman, who cannot be identified
under government rules, said the British have not been given any
details about what Gordon was doing when he was detained.
   ``But it is the case that the counsul-general has been,
naturally enough, observing tanker movements in Aden harbor. Many
others have been doing that,'' the spokesman said.

   People demanding more food and tobacco rioted in
the Siberian city of Chelyabinsk for three days after the city's
largest supermarket refused to sell alcohol, Tass reported Saturday.
   The official Soviet news agency said about 1,500 people marched
to the local Communist Party headquarters Friday night, smashing
cars and an ambulance and throwing gasoline bombs. Some burned
portraits of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   At midnight, they rallied outside the building, demanding better
supplies of food and consumer goods. They jeered and cursed
regional party officials who tried to address them.
   Tass said the crowd also demanded the immediate release of
protesters arrested earlier, and some tried to storm the city's
Interior Ministry Department. They were driven off by militiamen,
and when they dispersed they smashed dozens of shop windows, Tass
said.
   The protests began on Wednesday when a supermarket refused to
sell alcohol to shoppers waiting in line. Eleven policemen and one
protester were injured in the first round of rioting which
continued until Friday morning, Tass said.
   The city council on Friday issued an appeal to citizens, saying
the riots were ``a reflection of the difficult times in all of the
country,'' the independent news agency Postfactum reported.
   ``Things have gotten worse as a result of a failure to organize
normal trade in alcohol and tobacco,'' the appeal said. ``City
authorities are intervening to ensure normal supplies of goods. Now
it is of extreme importance to avoid new clashes in which our
children, mothers and wives will again suffer at the hands of
hooligans who take senseless actions leading to disturbances.''

   Thomas Willson McKnew, chairman emeritus of
the National Geographic Society, has died. He was 94.
   Authorities said his death Friday in a nursing home in this
Washington suburb followed a bout with pneumonia.
   McKnew participated in financing hundreds of research projects
in geology, archaeology, anthropology, botany, astronomy and
related sciences since joining the National Geographic in 1932.
   He was named chairman emeritus in 1987.
   He traveled extensively in connection with his work and was
aboard a flight over the North Pole in 1953.
   As assistant secretary of the society, McKnew served as project
officer in man's first venture into the stratosphere. The society
and the Army Air Corps in 1935 launched the giant manned balloon
EXPLORER II from the Stratobowl near Rapid City, S.D.
   Captains Albert W. Stevens and Orvil A. Anderson piloted
EXPLORER II and its pressurized, instrument-filled gondola to the
then-record height of 72,395 feet. The curvature of the earth was
photographed for the first time.
   McKnew established the General Thomas D. White U.S. Air Force
Trophy, named for his late friend, who was then Air Force Chief of
Staff.
   A veteran of World War I, McKnew was awarded the Navy's
Distinguished Service Award and the Air Force's Exceptional Service
Award, the highest civilian awards given by the Navy and the Air
Force.

   Flooding killed at least 50 people last
week, officials and news reports said Saturday.
   United News of India said heavy rains in the western state of
Gujarat caused five rivers to burst their banks and maroon scores
of villages. At least 48 people drowned in the flooding, the news
agency said.
   Army helicopters were being used to ferry essentials to the
stranded villagers, it said. Road and rail traffic has been
disrupted.
   In the eastern city of Bhubaneshwar, officials said at least two
people were drowned on an island off the coast after heavy rains
caused floods.
   At least 140 people have died in India this year in floods
caused by the annual summer monsoons.

   An escaped convict suspected of the fatal
shootings of four people in ten days _ including two killed by a
man impersonating a park ranger _ was shot and wounded Saturday,
authorities said.
   Michael G. Bell, 36, was shot in the neck trying to flee after
authorities learned of a meeting he had set up with a friend. Bell
was in serious condition at Boulder Community Hospital, said a
nursing supervisor.
   Deputies charged the friend, Theodore Oliver, 22, with counts of
murder and robbery in connection with two slayings the two men
allegedly carried out.
   But Oliver ``was afraid of being killed'' by Bell, and tipped
off authorities to the meeting at the Boulder City Limits bar,
saying Bell wanted him to bring an escape car, said Boulder County
Sheriff's Lt. Joe Gang.
   When Bell arrived at the bar, deputies were waiting in the car
he planned to take. Bell was shot as he tried to flee, Gang said.
   Bell was being held on a charge of escaping from prison. Murder
charges were pending.
   On Friday, police say, Bell, impersonating a park ranger,
rounded up five men who were target shooting in the mountains north
of Boulder and then began shooting them.
   Two of the men died, two were shot and injured, and the fifth
was injured in a fall as he ran away, police said. One of the
injured men remained hospitalized Saturday in serious condition
with a head wound.
   A car reported stolen shortly after Bell escaped from the Four
Mile Correctional Center in Canon City on Aug. 5 was seen in the
area of Friday's shootings, officials said.
   Police allege that Bell and Olivery shot a transient in nearby
Boulder Canyon on Tuesday and a convenience store clerk in
Broomfield on Aug. 15.
   Bell was sentenced to 12 years in prison in 1988 for check fraud
and theft, said state Department of Corrections Spokeswoman Liz
McDonough. He had an Illinois prison record, including for
attempted murder in 1972, she said.

<TEXT>
   The local chapter of the National Organization for
Women picked a man to receive its first Feminist of the Year award.
   ``A lot of people feel that to be a feminist you have to be a
woman,'' said Diane Dodge, the local NOW president. ``A feminist is
someone who works for and believes in rights for women.''
   Ms. Dodge said history professor Robert Zangrando was selected
because he has supported the chapter, participated in
women's-rights marches and events, and donated money toward NOW
efforts. He teaches women's studies at the University of Akron.
   ``I think personally there are others more richly deserving, but
I'm certainly not going to refuse their kind gesture,'' said
Zangrando.
   Zangrando has been a member of NOW's Akron chapter since 1975.
The chapter was founded 19 years ago, but his is the first time it
has given the award.
   Carole Garrison, director of women's studies at the University
of Akron, said it was inappropriate for NOW to choose a man for the
award.
   ``While Bob is certainly a special person, it's inappropriate
and doesn't educate the public,'' Ms. Garrison said. ``It's not
that we don't appreciate men's efforts. It's just that there's so
many women yet to be recognized.''

<HEAD>Poland Hails 10th Anniversary of Solidarity</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DRUSILLA MENAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki led a
tribute to Solidarity's 10th anniversary Saturday filled with
nostalgia for the days when the movement united workers and
intellectuals.
   ``Ten years ago, the alliance between workers and intellectuals
was so strong. . . . These values cannot be wasted,'' said
Mazowiecki, marking the start of his second year as the East bloc's
first non-Communist prime minister.
   The Solidarity movement that led the democratic upheaval in
Eastern Europe begins its second decade deeply divided. The split
is between workers backing the trade union and leader Lech Walesa
on the one hand, and intellectuals surrounding Mazowiecki and the
Warsaw government on the other.
   The two camps have been observing the anniversary separately.
The events began Aug. 15 in Gdansk, where Walesa led a
commemoration of the shipyard strike that spawned the movement.
   Walesa did not attend Saturday's forum at Warsaw University but
sent a warmly received letter that began, ``Thank you for those 10
years.''
   ``We won because we were united . . . but today, there is no
need to hide . . . that we don't agree on everything,'' he wrote.
   Mazowiecki is expected to go to Gdansk on Aug. 30 to meet with
shipyard workers and join Walesa in celebrating the accords
Solidarity signed with Communist authorities to create the first
free trade union in the Soviet bloc.
   It was during those negotiations that Mazowiecki, then a
Catholic journalist, brought a letter to Walesa expressing the
support of intellectuals in Warsaw and Krakow for the workers
movement being born on the Baltic coast.
   The united front formed by the two forces, joined by farmers, is
given significant credit for Solidarity's ability to survive
martial law and eight years underground before toppling the
Communists last year.
   Historian Bronislaw Geremek, chief of the Solidarity-based
parliament caucus, joined Mazowiecki in early support for
Solidarity.
   On Saturday, he recalled Walesa receiving the intellectuals'
letter and then asking, ``But can you help us?''
   ``The fact that striking workers accepted this alliance . . .
began from the simplest things _ apples brought by farmers, the
presence of intellectuals on both sides of the shipyard fence,''
Geremek said.
   Although the dissolution of Solidarity's united front has been a
painful development, participants suggest it is the start of a
multiparty political system that must emerge after four decades of
Communist Party rule.
   Calling Solidarity ``a strong partner,'' Mazowiecki said,
``Today we are divided . . . it is what democracy is about . . .
With all our differences, we will be all responsible for this
historic moment.''

   A pickup truck driven by the bride's cousin
careened through a wedding reception, knocking down guests and
toppling the wedding cake, authorities said.
   Ten people suffered minor injuries Friday night when the
18-year-old driver plowed into the recreation center at a mobile
home park a few miles west of Pittsburgh, police said.
   The bride's father, Ralph Robson, 39, suffered a broken wrist.
Five other people, including two children, were treated briefly at
hospitals, police said. Four others were treated at the scene.
   ``I saw people go flying all over the place,'' said Charles
McCarthy III.
   The driver, Jay Kanish, left Steve and Benita Gable's wedding
reception with McCarthy to get cigarettes from the truck, which
belonged to Kanish's mother, said Police Sgt. Richard Valent.
   Kanish decided to move the truck forward, but did not know how
to operate its stick shift, Valent said. The truck jumped a curb,
careened down a 50-foot embankment and crashed through the wall of
the recreation center.
   It crossed the room, where guests were enjoying rigatoni and
cold cuts, knocked over the head table and smashed the wedding cake
into a wall.
   Kanish told police he had not been drinking. He voluntarily
submitted to a blood-alcohol test, the result of which was not
available Saturday, police said. The accident remained under
investigation.

   Train enthusiast Steve Johnson says he's been
all over the country on trains, but never on one that came apart _
twice.
   ``This has to be a first,'' said Johnson, who slept through it
both times as he rode Amtrak's Empire Builder Thursday night with
his wife, Joanne.
   The first uncoupling left six cars behind.
   ``I walked to the back of the car and there was nothing there
but the tracks,'' said Joanne Johnson, who took the train with her
husband to celebrate their wedding anniversary. ``You could hear a
crew member on the walkie-talkie: `Oh my God, the train's
disconnected.' ''
   The train's crew backed up a quarter-mile, hitched the coach
back to the sleeper car where the Johnsons were riding, and headed
north again.
   Then it happened 47 miles up the track.
   ``I thought `It couldn't be happening again,' '' said Mrs.
Johnson.
   ``It happens,'' said Amtrak spokeswoman Debbie Hare. ``It
doesn't happen often.''
   The Johnsons, both rail enthusiasts, have made six Amtrak
journeys in the last year. They decided to spend the entire day of
their anniversary on the train: Take the eastbound Empire Builder
to Milwaukee in the morning, spend an hour or so in the city, and
return in a sleeper.
   Railroad officials suspect that a faulty coupler caused the cars
to ``part,'' Hare said.

   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar said Saturday that he had invited the Iraqi foreign
minister to open urgent talks to resolve the crisis in the Persian
Gulf.
   Perez de Cuellar said the talks could begin as soon as Monday in
New York or Geneva.
   ``I believe that after the resolutions adopted by the Security
Council, the time has come for the secretary-general to begin
diplomatic efforts to alleviate the present crisis in the gulf in
all aspects, through the process of dialogue,'' the
secretary-general.
   ``As a result of this, today I have invited (Iraqi Foreign
Minister) Tariq Aziz to meet with me in New York or Geneva to begin
next week a discussion about the crisis in the Persian Gulf,'' he
added.
   Perez de Cuellar, wrapping up an official visit to Colombia,
said at a morning news conference that he expected a reply soon.
   ``I have a personal relationship with Tariq Aziz . . . developed
over the course of the problem between Iran and Iraq,'' Perez de
Cuellar said. ``I want to use this personal relation to prevent the
aggravation of the gulf crisis.''
   A spokesman for President Bush said in Kennebunkport, Maine,
that the United States welcomes a ``discussion by all U.N. members
in the context of the complete and immediate and unconditional
withdrawal'' of Iraqi forces from Kuwait.
   Saddam Hussein has refused to withdraw from Kuwait.
   Perez de Cuellar's statements came just hours after the Security
Council passed a resolution calling on U.N. member nations to
militarily enforce the economic embargo it imposed on Iraq Aug. 6.
   Perez de Cuellar said his personal diplomatic effort was ``in
accordance with the spirit'' of the Security Council initiatives.
   The secretary-general said he believed the Iraqis were
interested in seeking a peaceful solution to the crisis. He added
that U.N. member nations with forces in the gulf should use
``maximum restraint'' in order to allow negotiations.

<TEXT>
   About 1,500 police occupied a square
along the capital's main boulevard after fighting anti-government
demonstrators who blocked traffic Saturday for the fourth day.
   Anti-riot troops and military police carrying shields and clubs
moved in on the demonstrators, who unleashed a barrage of rocks and
bottles. Hundreds of assembled Romanians booed as the security
forces pushed in.
   Many people were beaten and arrested. An unidentified man in
civilian clothes beat an Associated Press correspondent, who was
mistaken for a rioter. He was later released without charge.
   By nightfall, about 1,500 police and military personnel remained
in University Square, and most demonstrators had dispersed. Traffic
returned to normal.
   Demonstrators have blocked University Square every evening since
Wednesday, shouting for President Ion Iliescu to resign. Up to
Saturday, 32 had been arrested.
   Several anti-government demonstrations have occurred at the
square since June 13, when police swinging clubs broke up a 53-day
blockade. The police action led to violence in which officials said
six people were killed.
   Previous demonstrations were organized by students and activists
who accuse Iliescu and his associates of being thinly veiled
Communists, despite their role in ousting Communist dictator
Nicolae Ceausescu in the December revolution.
   This week's rallies appeared mainly motivated by the
deteriorating economy and attracted mostly lower-income workers.
   The protesters arrived around noon Saturday, halting traffic and
shouting slogans demanding that Iliescu step down. They attacked
cars trying to drive through. Fights broke out with supporters of
the government.
   ``How can you be satisfied with the state of affairs in this
country?'' one demonstrator demanded of a group who had accused him
of being a ``hooligan.''
   Dozens of demonstrators went after cars trying to break through
their blockade, throwing rocks and beating on the cars with sticks
and even crutches.
   About 400 police cleared the square in the early evening, but
demonstrators regrouped after police left and again took over the
square, this time erecting fences along the sides.
   Many people at the square opposed the demonstrators' actions.
Several times government supporters tried to forcibly remove
barricades and persuade demonstrators to let traffic through.
Fights broke out as police looked on.
   The AP correspondent was clubbed, kicked and punched by a man in
civilian garb who took a club from a policeman. Civilians and
police joined the fray, and the reporter was thrown in a van and
driven to the nearby police precinct.
   In a television interview Saturday before the latest
confrontation, Interior Minister Doru Ursu said his anti-riot
troops ``are determined to assure public order. . . . No one will
stop us from enforcing the law. Although I am opposed to violence,
I am a supporter of law and order.''
   He said he would soon propose a new law restructuring his
ministry and governing the activities of police. He did not
elaborate.

   West African troops sent to Monrovia
to end Liberia's 8-month-old civil war repulsed an attack Saturday
by rebels loyal to Charles Taylor, the Ghana news agency reported.
   The agency, which sent a reporter with the five-nation force,
said the West African troops advanced from Monrovia's port to the
outskirts of the capital, where they were attacked by Taylor's
National Patriotic Front rebels.
   Lt. Col. George Ayiku, commander of the task force's Ghanaian
contingent, told the news agency that the experience of his troops
and their greater firepower, including artillery, enabled them to
drive off the rebels.
   The 3,000 West African troops were welcomed upon arrival at the
port Friday night by Taylor's rival rebel chief, Prince Johnson.
The morning fighting apparently flared after they left the area
controlled by Johnson's fighters.
   Troops from Ghana, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Gambia and Guinea were
in the force. Togo said it would send troops but did not.
   Taylor has threatened to fight the task force, saying their
announced intention to stop the fighting is a just a maneuver to
keep President Samuel Doe in power. Taylor expressed concern that
the force contained soldiers from Nigeria and Guinea, whose leaders
in the past supported Doe.
   Taylor's rebels invaded from Ivory Coast on Dec. 24, branding
Doe's government as corrupt and saying they would overthrow it. A
rebel faction led by Johnson broke with Taylor in February.
   Taylor's National Patriotic Front has about 10,000 fighters, but
many of them are inexperienced teen-agers. The forces of Doe and
Johnson are smaller in size.
   A report by the News Agency of Nigeria, monitored in Abidjan,
Ivory Coast, said earlier that the West African task force landed
safely and that Nigerian naval headquarters was in touch with the
task force troops.
   The force was dispatched on six ships from Freetown, Sierra
Leone, to enforce a cease-fire in a war in which more than 5,000
people, mostly civilians, have died.
   Gunfire in Monrovia had delayed the task force's landing earlier
Friday.
   Johnson's forces control the port and most of Monrovia, the
capital of about 400,000 people. Taylor's fighters control most of
the country outside the capital.
   Forces under Johnson and troops loyal to Doe declared a truce
Monday. They said they would welcome the West African intervention.
They also said they were ready to join forces to resist any attacks
by Taylor.
   Through his chief spokesman, Tom Woewiyu, Taylor said that task
force soldiers would be regarded as the ``enemy and we will shoot
at them.''
   West African leaders decided to intervene on Aug. 6, saying the
war was no longer an internal conflict because thousands of their
citizens were trapped in Liberia and 400,000 Liberian refugees were
burdening neighboring countries.
   Brig. Gen. Cyril Igwueze of Nigeria, chief of staff of the task
force, said on Thursday that his men had no desire to shoot their
way into Monrovia, but ``we are able and willing to defend
ourselves if attacked.''
   U.S. forces stationed on a warship off Liberia earlier evacuated
U.S. citizens and other foreigners trapped by the fighting. Marines
also landed to defend the U.S. Embassy compound.

<HEAD>Report: Honecker Unlikely To Go to Trial in East Germany</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ousted East German leader Erich Honecker will
not stand trial in East Germany as long as the formerly Communist
country exists, a West German newspaper reported.
   The Hamburg-based Bild am Sonntag said Saturday that it would
report in its Sunday editions that Honecker could be prosecuted in
a united Germany, however, for violation of property laws.
   Bild quoted Guenter Seidel, an East German prosecutor, as saying
that Honecker had used $42 million for stocking a private housing
estate for leaders of the former Communist government.
   However, Seidel said that the investigation was not far enough
along to determine whether charges could be filed against Honecker
before East Germany merges with West Germany on Oct. 3.
   Negotiators are still working out the merger of the two German
legal systems.
   Honecker, 78, was ousted as East Germany's leader on Oct. 18,
paving the way for the country's first freely elected government in
March. Honecker is in poor health and remains confined to a Soviet
military hospital in Beelitz outside East Berlin.
   He is under investigation on allegations of abuse of power,
corruption, harboring terrorists and issuing shoot-to-kill orders
to prevent East Germans from escaping to West Germany when he
served as the country's leader.
   Bild said that Erich Mielke, the ex-head of East Germany's
former secret police, was also unlikely to go to court in East
Germany.
   ``I am at the end. I am a dead man,'' Bild quoted Mielke, 82, as
saying at his last interrogation.

   The State Department on Saturday urged
Americans traveling to El Salvador to exercise caution and to
refrain from trips to the eastern and northern parts of the country.
   The department noted the insurgency by the Farabundo Marti
National Liberation Front is ``particularly active'' in those
areas. And even in San Salvador, where the FMLN mounted an
offensive which lasted several weeks late last year, ``random
guerrilla attacks still occur.''
   The department recommended that air travelers pick arrival
flights that will enable them to clear customs and depart San
Salvador's airport by 5:30 p.m.
   The safest land route, it said, is via southern entries along
the Guatemalan border. But the department recommended that all
overland travel be avoided after dusk.
   The warning also recommended that Americans remain indoors after
1 a.m., and register upon arrival with the consular section of the
U.S. embassy.

   Iraqi authorities stepped up pressure on
foreign diplomatic missions in occupied Kuwait on Saturday, cutting
off water, power and telephone service and deploying heavily armed
troops nearby.
   But there was apparently no effort to remove diplomats by force,
according to reports reaching foreign ministries of the countries
involved. In Washington, Iraq's ambasador said ``we are not going
to use force'' against the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait.
   ``We haven't touched any embassy there,'' the Iraqi diplomat
said at an impromptu news conference at the State Department.
   However, Baghdad warned its own citizens that hiding foreigners
would be considered ``an act of espionage punishable by death.''
Iraqi officials had already issued harsh warnings against harboring
foreigners.
   The Iraqi ambassador to Washington, Sadiq al-Mashat, also said
Saturday that American diplomats who earlier left Kuwait for
Baghdad would be treated ``just like anybody else'' _ in other
words, that they no longer had diplomtic immunity. But he said
their dependents would be allowed to leave Iraq.
   About 100 U.S. diplomats and dependents had fled Kuwait for Iraq
late Thursday, arriving in a 33-car caravan after more than 19
hours on the road.
   According to the Bush administration, their safe passage out of
the area was assured by Iraq. But while they were en route, Iraq
imposed what it said were new regulations prohibiting the departure
of diplomats whose embassies had not shut down as ordered by
Saddam. This left the diplomats and their families stranded at the
U.S. Embassy in the Iraqi capital.
   Brent Scowcroft, Bush's national security adviser, said
negotiations were under way in Baghdad to permit the departure of
the diplomats and dependents.
   Meanwhile, the official Iraqi News Agency reported that hundreds
of Iraqi children marched to the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad on
Saturday carrying signs complaining that the international trade
embargo against Iraq is depriving them of milk. The protest likely
had official sanction.
   The Iraqi government has threatened to deprive Western children
stranded in Iraq and Kuwait of food and medicine if supplies are
cut for Iraqi children.
   The United States, Canada, Japan, Bangladesh, Switzerland,
Austria, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia and the 12 European
Community nations were among those who announced they would remain
in Kuwait, defying an Iraqi order to shut down.
   In London, the No. 2 man at the Foreign Office, William
Waldegrave, said more than 30 embassies were still functioning in
Kuwait. He said electric power at the British Embassy had been cut
off again after being restored earlier in the day.
   Similar reports were received in Paris, Rome, Vienna, Oslo and
Tokyo, although the numbers of soldiers outside the compounds
varied. The troops patrolling outside some of the embassies were
armed with machine guns and mortars, the reports said.
   The U.S. Ambassador in Kuwait, Nathaniel Howell, and about 10
other Americans stayed at the American compound.
   Iraqi troops appeared outside the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait City on
Thursday night and, according to U.S. officials, have blocked entry
and exit since.
   Electricity and water were cut off Saturday, but Iraqi troops
around the diplomatic mission have not attempted to close it, U.S.
officials said. They said the embassy was operating on generator
power.
   White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk said the administration had
expressed its objections through diplomatic channels in Baghdad,
Kuwait and Washington.
   ``The embassy continues to function. It is carrying out its
consular functions,'' said Popadiuk, in Maine with the vacationing
Bush.
   The Voice of America radio advised the 2,500 Americans trapped
in Kuwait not to go near the embassy while the soldiers remained.
   A State Department broadcast on VOA said the embassy was
``determined to continue working for your release from Kuwait and
your safe return to your families.''
   In Rome, Foreign Ministry officials said soldiers began
patrolling around the Italian mission in the morning. Electricity
went off in the early afternoon, but the embassy was able to keep
its lights on with a generator.
   An Italian Foreign Ministry official said the Iraqis had damaged
the wall around the French compound as they were working to cut off
the water. In Paris, the Foreign Ministry said it was trying to
verify the report. A half-dozen French Embassy personnel remained
in the mission.
   The Norwegian Foreign Ministry said power and water had been cut
at its embassy.
   Iraq annexed Kuwait after invading it on Aug. 2. Officials in
Baghdad decreed that all embassies there must close on Friday and
said diplomats remaining in Kuwait would lose their diplomatic
immunity.
   According to Article 45 of the Vienna Convention on diplomatic
relations, foreign missions are to remain inviolable even in times
of armed conflict.
   Many governments believed closing their missions could be
interpreted as the first step toward recognition of Iraq's claim of
sovereignty over Kuwait. Other governments, including the Soviet
Union, said that they would remove their diplomats for reasons of
security, but that this was not implicit recognition of the claim.
   In Tokyo, a Foreign Ministry official said water, electricity
and telephone lines to the Japanese Embassy were cut off Saturday
without notification.
   There were no reports that soldiers had made any move to take
control of the complex, where two diplomats remained. The diplomats
were told on Friday that their diplomatic immunity had been
revoked, however.
   The Greek mission and many others maintained skeleton staffs.
Some, including Poland and Spain, had just one diplomat present.

<HEAD>Sununu Takes `Acorn' Managerial Philosophy to Kremlin</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: INSERTS 1 graf after 5th graf, `I'm a,' to give departure and
return details.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>KENNEBUNKPORT, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   White House Chief of Staff John
Sununu's managerial philosophy _ which will be on display this week
in an unusual visit to Moscow _ is what he calls ``the acorn theory
of management.''
   He says he would rather deal ``with a couple of dozen problems
when they're acorns rather than one big problem when it's become an
oak tree.''
   In practice, it means keeping his door open and giving aides
ample opportunity daily to contact him on even the most trivial
matters.
   Sununu isn't trying to graft his own style onto the Kremlin, and
in fact is hoping to learn as much as he imparts on his five-day
visit with Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev and company.
   ``I'm a great believer that whenever you talk shop with
somebody, you can learn,'' he said in an interview last week with
The Associated Press. ``We're going over to the Soviet Union as
much to take a look at what they have and learn as much as we can.''
   Sununu and a phalanx of top White House staff were departing for
Moscow Sunday night from Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland. They
will return to Pease Air Force Base in New Hampshire on Friday.
   Sununu's trip actually is a return visit with the Soviet
efficiency experts who got a backstage view of how the White House
works following the Bush-Gorbachev summit in June.
   The Soviet team led by Gorbachev aide Mikhail Shkabardnya, like
Sununu an engineer by training, knew just what they wanted to talk
about, such as how President Bush's scheduling works, how the White
House interacts with Congress, how the administration separates
responsibilities between domestic policy and national security
policy.
   ``They were smart enough to understand that the needs of their
new presidency'' were very distinct from the ``more autocratic
ruling structure that they had before,'' Sununu said.
   Sununu, a staunch conservative, confided that if he'd been told
five or six months ago he'd be consulting for the Kremlin, ``I
wouldn't have believed it.''
   ``It's a tribute to the president, to Mr. Gorbachev and what
they've done with the U.S.-Soviet relationship,'' Sununu said.
   It trip also marks the latest chapter in Sununu's own success
story, which came as a surprise to Washington insiders who
predicted the strong-willed engineer would be outmatched by the
demands of running the White House.
   Brookings Institution scholar Stephen Hess calls Sununu ``the
big surprise of the Bush administration.''
   ``He has kept the White House staff efficient and importantly
anonymous. ... His relations with Congress (are) a little rocky
from time to time but it's an opposition Congress,'' said Hess.
   How has Sununu done it?
   In part by working marathon hours, maintaining an open-door
policy and, despite a reputation for ideological rigidity,
displaying an ability to cut deals even with liberals such as Sen.
Edward Kennedy, D-Mass.
   Sununu, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology graduate and
former governor of New Hampshire, brought formidable intellectual
skills to the job. Bush, in a toast at a state dinner May 15 for
the president of Tunisia, noted that his guest kept track of his
cabinet on a home computer.
   ``Your home computer is called an Apple. Mine is called John
Sununu,'' Bush quipped.
   Sununu gets to his desk at 6:45 a.m. and seldom leaves the White
House before 8 p.m. He presides over a daily 7:30 a.m. meeting of
the White House senior staff before joining the president at 8 a.m.
in the Oval Office for Bush's intelligence briefings and Sununu's
own private session with the president.
   ``People know that they can come in with the most trivial of
items from about a quarter of seven in the morning to seven-thirty
staff meeting. And they know they can come in any time after say
six o'clock without an appointment and just talk about whatever
they want to,'' said Sununu.
   ``He's got an open door and an open mind,'' said Andrew Card,
the deputy chief of staff and part of the delegation to Moscow,
which also includes domestic policy director Roger Porter, chief
congressional liaison Fred McClure, Soviet specialist Condoleezza
Rice, James Cicconni, who oversees the flow of paper into the
president's office, Sununu assistant Ed Rogers, and Nancy Sununu,
his wife.
   Sununu ``is not a micromanager. He does not do an awful lot of
minutiae,'' said Card, a former Massachusetts state legislator.
``But he has the ability to sift quickly ... and find those details
that need to be changed.''
   Sununu does not bother to read newspapers every day, relying
instead on aides to keep him informed. He prefers to deal with
people in person rather than on paper.
   Sununu has a ritual meeting with the president late each
afternoon, as well as in the morning.
   In between, said Card, ``he wears the rug out walking down to
the Oval Office. He goes down there a dozen times a day probably.''

<DATELINE>AQABA, Jordan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cranes used for unloading cargo hang
motionless against the blue sky, and the constant roar of trailer
trucks to and from the port has stopped.
   Jordan's only port _ and by extension, Iraq's Red Sea gateway _
has been brought to a near standstill by the U.N. sanctions imposed
on Iraq after its Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   Jordanian economists say the embargo could eventually have a
devastating effect on the country's fragile economy by boosting
unemployment, shrinking the economy and drastically cutting foreign
exchange.
   On Saturday, the U.N. Security Council endorsed the use of force
to back up the sanctions.
   ``It is a major blow to the Jordanian economy,'' Fahad Fanek, a
leading economist and publisher of the Jordanian Economic Monitor,
said of the U.N. embargo.
   King Hussein has said he intends to comply with the sanctions.
But Jordan's economic dependence on its powerful neighbor to the
east, coupled with the country's grassroots support for Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein, make it difficult for the beleaguered
king to comply.
   Fanek estimates that long-term compliance with the sanctions
could cut the kingdom's gross domestic product, which he estimated
at $4 to $5 billion a year, in half.
   ``Jordan will suffer more than Iraq if Jordan is forced to
comply,'' he said.
   The most significant loss would be in exports, he said, since
they account for 50 percent of the gross domestic product. More
than half of Jordan's labor force works in that sector.
   Before the invasion, Iraq was the destination for 23 percent of
those exports, while another 5 percent went to Kuwait.
   ``That means we will sacrifice about 14 percent of the economy,
through export losses,'' he said.
   Related losses would come in the transportation sector, until
recently driven by a steady stream of trailer truck traffic plying
the 1,120 miles between Aqaba and Baghdad along a narrow desert
highway.
   Losses in the export and transit sectors would translate into a
doubling of the current 20 percent unemployment rate, Fanek said.
   The hundreds of long-haul trucks parked idle along the highway
leading into Aqaba bore witness to the pinch already being felt.
Drivers lay on the pavement under their trucks to escape the sun,
which reaches 113 degrees in August.
   The economist said Jordan was likely to lose annual development
grants totaling $185 million which it received from Iraq and Kuwait.
   Also lost was the ability to buy Iraqi oil for $16 a barrel
instead of at world prices, now over $31 a barrel, to compensate
Jordan for its exports. Iraq supplies 90 percent of Jordan's oil.
   Having to buy oil on the world market could cost Jordan up to
$400 million a year in scarce foreign exchange, Fanek said.
   Wages sent home from the approximately 100,000 Jordanian workers
in Kuwait _ which amounted to $300 million a year _ were another
major source of foreign exchange for the country.
   Fanek predicted potential losses of $1.5 billion to $2 billion a
year for Jordan, which already has an $8.4 billion foreign debt,
major development costs and no ready source of revenue like its
oil-rich neighbors.

<TEXT>
   Veterans from the unit that dropped the
atom bombs met Saturday to dedicate a peace memorial, but the
gathering's tone was marred when a Japanese journalist was
scratched off the speaker list for saying the bombings weren't
necessary.
   A planned rendition of the Japanese national anthem also was
removed from Saturday's program.
   The memorial was dedicated to the 2,000 members of the 509th
Composite Group, and the nearly 200,000 people who died in the
atomic blasts at Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
   The dedication was held in conjunction with the 509th's 45th
reunion and about 400 people gathered at the monument adjacent to
the Wendover Visitor's Center.
   Veterans said they believe peace was bought with the lives
claimed by the bombings. A chaplain gave thanks for the bomb.
   ``We thank thee God for the atom bomb, through which peace came
to our world,'' said the Rev. William B. Downey in dedicating the
16-foot granite obelisk topped with a brass model of the ``Enola
Gay,'' the B-29 that dropped the bomb on Hiroshima.
   ``Lord keep that peace,'' Downey said.
   The 509th trained at the now-abandoned Wendover Air Base in
nearby Utah in 1944-45, a few hundred yards from where the memorial
was dedicated.
   Group organizers had invited Hideaki Kase, a conservative
Japanese author and advisor to two prime ministers, to speak of the
significance of the event.
   Kase is a controversial figure in Japan because he has advocated
bolstering the military and rewriting the Japanese constitution _
drawn up under U.S. auspices after World War II _ to allow Japan to
send its troops overseas.
   Friday night, Kase said Japan was ready to capitulate before the
bombs were dropped, making the destruction of the two cities
unnecessary. During Kase's presentation, dozens of veterans and
their wives walked out and sang ``God Bless America'' in the
hallway.
   Christopher Turoff, 69, a bombardier in the group, was one who
stayed.
   ``I couldn't believe it,'' he said later. ``He seemed to blame
the whole war on us.''
   Kase, who traveled to Wendover from Tokyo, said he was unclear
what portion of his speech offended his guests.
   ``What I talked about was that Japan was ready to give up the
war in early August,'' Kase said. ``That in retrospect the two
atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki were not necessary.''
   James Corliss, 69, who was flight engineer on one of the chase
planes on the Aug. 6, 1945, Hiroshima raid, said he was
``disgusted'' with Kase's rendition of history.
   ``He said we shouldn't have bombed at all,'' Corliss said. ``He
said we started the war.''
   Fearing a walkout at the dedication ceremony if Kase were
allowed to talk, reunion organizer George Marquardt told the
conductor of the Army band not to play the Japanese national anthem
and passed over Kase on the program.
   ``I feel awful about it,'' said Marquardt, a 70-year-old retired
major who now lives in Murray, Utah. ``But this is the 509th's
reunion. I couldn't have them walking out.''
   ``There would have been a riot,'' said Corliss.
   Kase said he was not offended by the last-minute decision to cut
him out of the program.
   ``I am a guest here,'' he said, ``You will have to ask them what
I said that was offensive.
   In an interview from Tokyo in the weeks before the event, Kase
said the bombings had been necessary because their demonstration of
power had prevented a major war since.
   Retired Gen. Paul W. Tibbets Jr., commander of the 509th and
pilot of the ``Enola Gay,'' which dropped the bomb on Hiroshima,
unveiled the memorial along with Marquardt and retired Gen. Charles
Sweeney, who piloted the bomber on the Nagasaki raid.
   Under Tibbetts' command, the 509th practiced high-altitude
precision bombing, flying long trips to California's Salton Sea
bombing range and the Caribbean Sea to simulate long, over-water
navigation.
   Only Tibbetts knew the group's true mission, and he demanded
unquestioning loyalty from those who didn't. All he told them was
that their efforts might save thousands of American lives and bring
the war to an early end.

   What Elvis Presley would have weighed in
outer space may be a useful theme with which to approach potential
mates in bars, but the keepers of Graceland don't find it funny.
   ``It's really kind of tasteless,'' said Todd Morgan, a spokesman
for Graceland, the singer's former home. ``We have a lot more
important things to worry about than how much Elvis would weigh on
other planets.''
   The ``Elvis on Other Planets Weight Chart'' was printed in
several publications recently marking the 13th anniversary of the
singer's death.
   Chris Mojo, 30, of Mojo's Guitar Shop in New York City, said he
used to have the chart printed on the back of his business cards.
He said he borrowed the idea from the business cards of Billy
Gibbons, lead singer of the rock group ZZ Top.
   ``For some reason, people all over the country got copies of
them,'' Mojo said. ``Everybody told me that it was the best opening
line for picking up girls ever. Like, `Do you know how much Elvis
would weigh on Pluto?' ''
   Presley weighed 255 pounds when he died Aug. 16, 1977.
   According to the chart, that equals about 7,140 pounds on the
sun, 97 pounds on Mercury and Mars, 232 pounds on Venus, 43 on the
moon, 648 on Jupiter, 275 on Saturn, 232 on Uranus, 303 on Neptune
and 13 pounds on Pluto.
   The weights vary in relation to the planets' surface gravity
relative to earth's.
   James Emerson, ZZ Top's general crew master, said the cards are
very popular, although a few fans were offended.
   He quoted one Memphis woman as saying, ``I see you've very
conveniently left off what he's weighing in heaven.''

   NEAR THE SAUDI-IRAQI BORDER (AP) _ The thousands of Arab
soldiers camped in the desert are training with tanks,
anti-aircraft weapons and gas masks for possible battle with Iraq,
Saudi military officials said Saturday.
   For the first time since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, the
Saudi government escorted reporters to the border area to see
Saudi, Egyptian and Moroccan troops in the field.
   Military officials said Syrians and troops from other Persian
Gulf countries are also deployed in the joint Arab command, but
reporters were not taken to their outposts.
   ``They are on alert to either move forward, stay or pull back
here to prepare to defend the border,'' said a major general who
commands a joint Saudi-Gulf Cooperation Council Force of more than
10,000 men.
   The Cooperation Council defense ministers have agreed to
reinforce their rapid deployment force in Saudi Arabia. Up to
10,000 troops from six Cooperation Council states have been based
at the northeastern Saudi base of Hafr Al Batin for the past two
years.
   The joint Arab force is significant because it is the first time
soldiers have united against another Arab country, Iraq.
   ``I am defending the Saudi Arabian territory regardless of who
the offender is because it is a holy land,'' said an Egyptian
colonel. Saudi Arabia is home to Islam's holiest shrines at Mecca
and Medina.
   The Egyptian said he was taking orders from the Saudis.
   Saudi troops make up the front line of defense, while forces
from other nations are further back. Americans are not in the same
area, military officials said.
   Saudi officials escorted journalists to within 18 miles of the
border on condition they not reveal exact locations or the
commanders' full names.
   The major general said Arab troops were about 36 miles from the
closest Iraqi troops, but they hadn't spotted any movements.
   ``The Iraqis are in a defensive posture,'' the general in charge
of the Arab force said.
   The headquarters are a clump of tents and vehicles in the desert
shimmering with heat. Other units, each of which is responsible for
protecting a section of the border, dot the area, their clusters
difficult to distinguish from mirages.
   Several tanks _ primarily French-made MX-30s _ were visible,
although their silouettes were concealed by sands.
   Saudi military officials said they had thousands of tanks and
were pleased with their performance. The Iraqis are believed to
have between 800 and 1,000 tanks in Kuwait.
   Were Iraqi tanks to roll across the border, a massive tank force
would be needed to stop them, said a Saudi lieutenant colonel who
is a battalion commander.
   Air power ``can destroy (tanks), but they can't stop them,'' he
said. His battalion of 368 people has an air defense platoon
attached to it.
   ``We consider our tank one of the best tanks,'' he said. ``Good
firepower, good for our environment, and it can carry people.''
   ``Our morale is high,'' the lieutenant colonel said. If
attacked, ``we will keep fighting until victory or martyrdom.''
   The troops also have anti-aircraft equipment, including TOW
missiles.
   The Saudis and Cooperation Council countries have infantry,
artillery, air and tank divisions. The Egyptians _ 2,000 men
wearing a different style of camouflage uniform and driving smaller
jeeps _ are an elite commando unit known as Saiq'a, the Arabic for
lightning.
   The Moroccan infantry unit seemed less well-equipped. The men
were unarmed, and some wore tee-shirts, fatigues and sandles
instead of uniforms.
   Compared to American units, the Saudis' camp seemed more
homelike. The main tent at each camp was covered with a nylon
Persian rug.
   Instead of packaged meals, the men ate a rice and lamb stew and
grapes for lunch.
   Many of the men are stationed permanently in the area, so they
can call their families or go home for a four-hour day leave.
   The men also have less trouble adjusting to the heat than do the
Americans because they are accustomed to the temperatures.
   ``I told you logistics were not a problem here,'' said one
Saudi. ``Pepsi here, Kleenex here, cigarettes here.''

<DATELINE>SEQUOIA NATIONAL PARK, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Looking a little like a
high-rise construction project, three tall trees stand surrounded
by scaffolding in Sequoia National Park in an experiment to gauge
ozone damage to the giants.
   Smog from the San Joaquin Valley in central California is
increasingly wafting into the air around the sequoias of the
southern Sierra Nevada.
   Earlier research has shown that ozone damages seedlings 1- and
2-years-old. The current project is aimed at finding ozone's
effects on mature trees. Damaging ozone results when nitrogen
oxides and hydrocarbons _ components of smog _ react in sunlight.
   ``The problem we have here in the park is mainly ozone,'' ranger
Diane M. Ewell, an air quality specialist, said Friday. ``We don't
have the air problems cities do, such as carbon monoxide. You need
great concentrations of carbon monoxide to exceed health
standards.''
   The current research began in June about a mile north of Giant
Forest Village and 150 miles northeast of Los Angeles when
researchers rigged 106-foot-high scaffolding beside three
200-year-old, 165-foot tall trees.
   Four clear cellophane cylinders about 2{ feet in diameter and
four feet long were placed over separate boughs on each tree. A
length of 10-inch, foil-wrapped ducting brings in air mixed with
specific levels of ozone.
   One set of chambers contains half the level of ozone considered
normal, or ambient. The second has normal levels, the third double
that amount and the fourth triple.
   Ewell said the scaffolding would be removed in late September
because it would be unable to handle the weight of the winter's
snow.
   Expected federal budget cuts make the project's future uncertain.
   Currently, it is funded by about $82,000 from the National Park
Service and about half that amount from the U.S. Forest Service,
said head researcher Nancy E. Grulke, from the Forest Service'
Forest Fire Laboratory in Riverside.
   This summer's statistics will be analyzed by the end of the
year, she said.

   The historic Treaty Oak, a centuries-old tree that
was severely damaged by a powerful herbicide, will be severely
pruned later this year in an effort to save it, says the city
forester.
   ``It's time,'' said John Giedraitis. ``What's dead is dead.''
   About three-fourths of the tree's crown will be cut off, he
said, leaving only one living section.
   The tree, estimated to be as many as 500 years old, was poisoned
with the liquid herbicide Velpar in early 1989. About two-thirds of
the oak died, foresters said.
   According to legend, the tree was the site of a treaty-signing
between Stephen F. Austin and Indians.
   Paul Stedman Cullen was sentenced to nine years in prison for
poisoning the tree. Prosecutors claimed the poisoning was part of a
ritual to attract a woman's attention.
   Since the poisoning, the small park surrounding the tree has
been pampered with activated charcoal, microbes, fertilizer,
saltwater, sugarwater, spring water, a huge set of shades, and an
intricate sprinkling system.
   But that hasn't brought the dead limbs back to life.

   A Newsweek poll released Saturday found 80
percent of Americans oppose quick military action against Iraq,
preferring instead to wait to see if economic and diplomatic
sanctions are effective.
   The poll, conducted on Thursday and Friday, also found growing
support for a covert assassination of Iraqi president Saddam
Hussein as a way of quickly ending the crisis.
   In the new poll, 43 percent said they would support an
assassination, 49 percent opposed it and 9 percent didn't know. In
a Newsweek poll two weeks ago, 34 percent supported a covert
assassination.
   Federal law prohibits American involvement in the assassination
of foreign leaders.
   More than two thirds _ 68 percent _ of respondents said
President Bush should pay more attention to a diplomatic solution
to the crisis, which began Aug. 2 when Iraq invaded Kuwait.
   But if fighting begins, more than half _ 57 percent _ said Bush
should order attacks on Iraqi positions even if Saddam makes good
on his threat to station U.S. hostages as human shields. Only 26
percent said Bush should not attack under those conditions and 17
percent didn't know.
   Bush's approval rating has not changed much from the Newsweek
poll two weeks ago _ 74 percent now compared with 75 percent in a
poll done Aug. 9 and 10.
   Most Americans _ 55 percent _ said Bush was not spending too
much time on vacation during the crisis, compared with 38 percent
who said he was and 7 percent who didn't know.
   Newsweek interviewed 767 people for the new poll, which has a
margin of error of plus or minus 4 percent.

<TEXT>
   Austrian President Kurt Waldheim left Iraq
after a brief visit with President Saddam Hussein on Saturday,
taking with him more than 90 Austrians stranded here since Iraq
invaded Kuwait.
   Waldheim was the first Western leader to meet face-to-face with
Saddam since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2. The Austrian
leader was accompanied by his foreign minister, Alois Mock, and
other Austrian officials.
   The special Iraqi Airways flight carrying Waldheim and the
Austrian evacueess landed in Amman, Jordan, on Saturday evening.
The Austrian evacuees immediately boarded a plane for Vienna, and
Waldheim stayed behind in Amman.
   At Amman's airport, Waldheim told reporters he still held out
hope for a diplomatic settlement of the Persian Gulf crisis.
   ``Of course, I cannot tell you what the outcome will be. But the
president (Saddam) assured me that he continues to be interested in
a peaceful negotiated settlement.''
   Waldheim said later that he had raised with Saddam the issue of
U.S. citizens and other Westerners who have not been allowed to
leave Iraq and Kuwait, but he received no commitments from the
Iraqi leader.
   ``The president (Saddam) was very serious in discussing this
matter with me ... and it is my hope that it will take a positive
development,'' Waldheim told The Associated Press in an interview
at an Amman hotel.
   He said he told Saddam: ``I hope that it will be possible to do
something for the other citizens too. And the president said he
will keep it in mind. He didn't give me any immediate answer.''
   An Austrian embassy official in Amman said 96 Austrians,
including about 30 women and 15 children, arrived on the flight
from Iraq. Earlier, an Austrian diplomat in Baghdad had said about
80 people _ mainly workers, technicians and their families _ were
leaving with Waldheim.
   Waldheim said four Austrians stayed behind in Baghdad to take
care of personal and business affairs, and would be traveling
overland to Jordan in the next few days.
   Franz Pernegger, the Austrian ambassador to Jordan, said Iraqi
authorities arranged for helicopters to fly Austrians stranded
elsewhere in Iraq to Baghdad so they could leave with Waldheim.
   Waldheim, interviewed by the Cable News Network in Amman, said
Austria ``did not make any concessions and we were not asked to''
in order to obtain permission for its citizens to leave Iraq.
   In Baghdad, the official Iraqi News Agency said Waldheim and the
Iraqi president were joined in their meeting by Foreign Minister
Tariq Aziz; Izzat Ibrahim, vice chairman of the Iraqi Revolutionary
Council, and other council members.
   About 21,000 Westerners, including 3,000 Americans and 4,500
Britons, are stranded in Iraq and Kuwait. Saddam has barred them
from leaving and he confirmed Saturday that some were taken to
strategic points, including missile bases and oil refineries.
   ``This measure is not meant to protect us against attacks, it is
meant to prevent attacks from happening,'' Saddam said at a news
conference with Austrian reporters.
   ``We hope that our hosting of the rest of the foreigners here
will not last long,'' but he added that this depended on ``the
removal of the specter of war which the U.S.A. seeks to ignite in
the area.''
   Waldheim arrived aboard an Iraqi presidential plane and was
greeted at the airport by Saddam, diplomats said, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   Waldheim got to know Arab leaders during his 10 years as U.N.
secretary-general. Most Western leaders have shunned him and
America barred him after disclosures that he served during World
War II with a German army unit implicated in atrocities, and later
misrepresented his war record.
   Saddam held the impromptu news conference for Austrian reporters
accompanying Waldheim before the talks began. It was carried by
Austrian radio and broadcast later on Iraqi TV, picked up by Cable
News Network. It was his first talk with Western reporters since
the crisis began.
   Saddam, dressed in a gray suit, told reporters Iraqi troops
don't plan to withdraw from Kuwait.
   He said the United States had occupied Saudi Arabia and other
holy places of Islam and the ``Arab world condemns this.''
   A multinational military force, composed largely of U.S. troops
sent by President Bush, has been building up in neighboring Saudi
Arabia following the invasion of Kuwait.
   Saddam termed Western military action ``a naked aggression.''
   He characterized as corrupt the government of Kuwait that was
driven into exile _ ``sitting around gambling tables wasting
millions. This is the type of Arab character Bush wants to bring
back to Kuwait.''
   In news conference remarks broadcast by CNN, Saddam said he was
ready to negotiate over the crisis, but that Western powers hadn't
offered to open talks.
   ``I shall say that whatever collides with Iraq will find colmns
of dead bodies which may have a beginning but may not have an end.
We want the Americans to live. We do not want them to die. In the
same way we want the Iraqis to live and not die,'' Saddam said.
   ``So it is the duty of Americans now to bear in mind that they
must resort to a political solution and not to force, and to end
this tendency they have that they can have anything they want.''
   He also said that with the annexation of Kuwait, Iraq seeks no
other Arab territory.

   A Michigan man who flew into Amman from
Baghdad on Saturday reported that other U.S. citizens he
encountered in the Iraqi capital were well and leading a fairly
normal life.
   Nick Ablahad, a machinist from Hazel Park, Mich., arrived at
Queen Alia International Airport on an Iraqi airliner carrying
about 170 other evacuees.
   ``Everything was normal in Iraq,'' he said. ``It is quiet and
life is normal.''
   It was not clear why Ablahad was allowed to leave while about
3,000 other Americans are being held by order of Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein. Iraq has allowed some foreigners of Arab extraction
to leave, regardless of nationality. Ablahad said he held an Iraqi
residency permit, but had been traveling on a one-month vacation.
   He said he was leaving because he had to return to his job.
Ablahad said he saw about 20 American friends during his visit to
Iraq and ``they all looked fine to me.''
   ``They are going to the movies, bars, the Sheraton and stuff
like that. We had no problems at all there.''
   He had no information on Westerners sent by Iraq to sites near
military installations and potential targets to deter attack by the
multinational force gathered in Saudi Arabia.
   The 3,000 Americans and about 4,500 Britons are among about
21,000 Westerners left stranded in Iraq and Kuwait by Saddam's
invasion of that small oil state on Aug. 2.
   PLO chairman Yasser Arafat also flew into Amman, according to a
senior official of the Palestine Liberation Organization in Amman.
Arafat's agenda was not disclosed, but he has tried to act as an
intermediary in the Persian Gulf crisis.
   The official Iraqi News Agency later said Arafat had arrived in
Iraq. The broadcast, monitored in Cyprus, said only that Arafat
would meet with Saddam on the Persian Gulf crisis.
   Late Saturday, Austrian President Kurt Waldheim arrived in Amman
on a special Iraqi Airways flight carrying 96 Austrian evacuees
from Iraq, an Austrian official said. Saddam allowed the Austrians
to leave after meeting with Waldheim.
   Also, 78 Chinese who had been working in Kuwait arrived in Amman
on Saturday and departed immediately for Beijing, an airport
official said.
   The flood of foreigners pouring through Jordanian border posts _
the great majority of them Arabs _ continued Saturday, although
officials said the number had decreased.
   One security official, speaking from his border office, said,
``A much fewer number of people are crossing my borders now, and we
were told by Iraqi authorities that the number of people on their
borders is in the hundreds.''
   He said Jordanian authorities were transporting away 7,000
people stranded for two days at the Ruweishid border post, 210
miles northeast of Amman. The official spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   He said 5,000 foreigners were at the Iraqi border post of
Rutbah, 75 miles west of Ruweishid and 590 miles west of Baghdad,
and they are expected to cross to Jordan shortly.
   Jordan announced Friday it was reopening its borders. The
Interior Ministry said 20,000 people a day will be allowed to enter
Jordan through Ruweishid.
   Jordan closed the border with Iraq Wednesday, saying tens of
thousands of refugees had put an unacceptable financial strain on
the country.
   The European Community on Saturday said it would provide Jordan
with $650,000 in emergency aid to assist the refugees.
   King Fahd of Saudi Arabia sent six planes to help airlift to
Cairo the thousands of Egyptians flooding into Jordan from Iraq,
according to an official statement read over state-run Riyadh radio
and monitored in Bahrain.
   Fahd also pledged $75 million to help Egypt resettle the
refugees, many of whom left penniless after the Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait.

<HEAD>FAA Worries About Shortage Of Air Traffic Controllers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Aviation Administration could lose
air traffic controllers and other key staff to severe budget
cutbacks and the national call-up of military reservists, a
spokesman for the agency said.
   Nearly 15 percent of the FAA's 2,200 key jobs in the Northwest _
mainly air traffic controllers _ are held by reservists, FAA
spokesman Mitch Barker said Friday. Just over 5 percent, or about
865, of the FAA's 17,250 air traffic controllers are in the
reserves.
   The agency has asked all its facilities to report daily on how
many reservist they lose to active duty, said FAA spokesman Fred
Farrar in Washington D.C.
   ``We're concerned, and we're working right now to develop some
way to get through this,'' Barker said.
   FAA Administrator James Busey said Friday the reserve call-up
had not yet caused any problems.
   As of Friday, seven controllers at some of the nation's 686
control towers had been called to active duty. The FAA has said
remaining controllers would work overtime if a staff shortage
develops.
   The agency has not asked for any of its controllers to be
exempted from the call-up.
   Farrar said it would be difficult to move controllers to
understaffed airports because it would take several months for them
to adjust.
   But he said the agency's main concern is with potential budget
cuts when the next phase of the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law
takes effect on Oct. 1. The FAA could lose nearly one-third of its
budget.
   Some senior employees have begun seeking early retirement,
fearing that generous elements of the federal retirement program
could be cut by Congress, Farrar said. That could further compound
a staffing problem.
   The agency has asked the Bush administration for 475 more
controllers and 250 more safety inspectors in fiscal 1991, Busey
told reporters Friday at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport.
   He said an existing shortage of inspectors means the FAA will
not alter its policy of allowing large airlines to oversee their
own safety and maintenance records.
   Busey said the system works, despite a 60-count federal
indictment last month against Eastern Airlines and several of its
top managers for allegedly falsifying safety and maintenance
records.
   ``There will always be discrepancies,'' he said. ``I'm very
comfortable that the system is working.''

<TEXT>
   It was 90 degrees on the plains, but
Sherry Barsotti and Jim Reaka went to the top of 14,264-foot Mount
Evans for a windy, chilly and breathtaking wedding ceremony.
   After saying their ``I do's'' Friday, the Arvada, Colo., couple
and an impromptu wedding party climbed onto 18-speed mountain bikes
and bicycled 28 miles, a drop of 6,724 feet down the winding,
twisting, narrow asphalt road to Idaho Springs.
   Along the way, the newlyweds stopped at Echo Lake Lodge, at
10,600 feet, for a wedding lunch highlighted by the traditional
cutting of the nuptial cake.
   ``We originally thought of getting married in Kansas City, which
was our original hometown, but we both love the outdoors and knew
about this bicycle tour,'' Sherry said. ``It sounded like an
exciting way to get married.''
   Sherry's friend, Joni Lund, runs bicycle tours off Mount Evans
and arranged the combination wedding and tour.
   ``At first, we really didn't think she was serious,'' Lund said.
``But soon we realized she was. So we contacted two couples from
Massachusetts who were already booked on the Mount Evans tour and
asked if they would mind.''
   One of the visitors, Susan Gaitley of Duxbury, Mass., stood next
to the bride during the ceremony and said she got so carried away
with the sentiment ``that I thought I was going to cry.''
   With temperatures in the 30s, ice on pools of water and a brisk
wind blowing at the summit, the cyclists donned red two-piece
windbreaker suits for the trip down.
   The Lunds tied a bouquet to the handlebars of the married
woman's bicycle and threaded color crepe paper streamers through
the front wheel spokes of the newlyweds' bicycles.
   Looking on with varying degrees of curiosity were a forest
ranger, several tourists, and a few mountain goats on a nearby
slope.

<HEAD>Countries Cheer U.N. Decision to Use Force in Anti-Iraqi Embargo</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Gulf-UN, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nations around the world hailed the United
Nation's approval of force to back its embargo of Iraq, praising
the decision as an act of international solidarity against Baghdad.
   However, Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi called the resolution a
very dangerous endorsement of a ``fait accompli which is imposed by
force.'' He was referring to the military buildup in the region by
the United States, Britain, France and other countries opposed to
Iraq.
   The Libyan leader sent a message to U.N. Secretary-General
Javier Perez de Cuellar complaining that ``this is very dangerous
for it is a patched-up resolution taken under American pressure.
...,'' Libya's official JANA news agency said.
   The U.N. resolution, adopted 13-0 with Cuba and Yemen
abstaining, authorized the various nations' navies assembled in the
gulf region to use force if necessary to stop Iraqi trade.
   The White House hailed the U.N. resolution as strengthening
``world resolve to force Iraq out of Kuwait.''
   President Bush's national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft,
said the United Nations has given the Bush administration a free
hand to enforce the economic embargo on Iraq. But he sidestepped a
question of how much force America was willing to use.
   Scowcroft said on Cable News Network that the U.N. action
``means no commerce should go in and out (of Iraq) by sea, and that
means that vessels will be stopped and inspected,'' effective
immediately.
   In Moscow, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze warned
Iraq to heed Saturday's U.N. vote: ``The results of the voting ...
show the unanimity of the council with regard to measures to be
taken in the existing situation. We hope that the Iraqi leadership
will draw proper conclusions from this fact, will take steps to
deescalate the conflict. ...''
   France said the resolution was ``a very important act which is
testimony to the international community's firmness and
solidarity.'' It said French forces would apply the resolution
``with the necessary resolve.''
   France has said its forces remain under French command, though
they are coordinating with other countries.
   The U.N. Security Council decision was ``an act of historic
significance and a landmark in the further course of international
relations,'' Greek government spokesman Vyron Polydoras said. ``It
demonstrates the will of the international community to serve
justice and ethics,'' he said in a statement.
   Britain said that the U.N. decision displayed vital
international unity.
   ``It is important that, contrary to what some people might have
expected _ I think what Saddam Hussein expected _ the unity of the
international community is not fraying; it is actually getting more
close as time goes on,'' said William Waldegrave, second-ranking
official in Britain's Foreign Office, during a news conference.
   In his comments, Waldegrave would not say what force British
vessels in the gulf region would use. ``We will use, obviously, the
minimum force necessary,'' he said.
   Saddam, Iraq's leader, ignited the international uproar with his
Aug. 2 invasion of neighboring Kuwait. Iraq later annexed the
oil-rich state.
   In a statement carried by Iraqi News Agency, Iraqi Foreign
Minister Tariq Aziz said the U.N. resolution ``did not come as a
surprise to us, considering the frenzied efforts that have turned
the Security Council into a tool for America's aggressive and
unjust policy.''
   In Venice, Italian Foreign Minister Gianni De Michelis said the
agreement of China and the Soviet Union was especially significant.
   He said Italian military authorities would give orders to the
three Italian navy ships headed to the gulf ``on the basis of the
U.N. resolution.'' He said rules of engagement would be discussed
Monday among navy officials of the countries of the nine-nation
Western European Union.
   Spain, Denmark and Canada were among the other nations that
applauded the U.N. decision.

   The interim president of the Navajos
is encouraging members of the tribal nation to extend spiritual
support to troops in the Middle East.
   ``In time of conflict or crisis, the Navajo People must unite
and provide spiritual support for our Navajo brothers and sisters
now awaiting warfare in the Middle East,'' Leonard Haskie said
Friday. ``I urge each citizen of the Navajo Nation to pray for our
loved ones who are out there to defend this country.''
   An estimated 100 of the 1,000 Navajos in active duty are
believed to have shipped out to the Middle East, the statement said.

   Waldheim, the first Western leader to meet Saddam since the
invasion, has been shunned by Western leaders because he concealed
his links to a German army unit in World War II that has been
implicated in atrocities.
   Saddam did not hesitate to use the visit by Waldheim, a former
U.N. secretary-general, to again reject demands by the United
Nations that he restore Kuwait's sovereignty and free the hostages.
   Saddam, at a news conference with Austrian reporters, said Iraqi
troops will not withdraw from Kuwait and repeated that foreigners
have been moved to strategic points, including missile bases and
oil refineries.
   ``I shall say that whatever collides with Iraq will find columns
of dead bodies which may have a beginning but may not have an end.
We want the Americans to live. We do not want them to die. In the
same way, we want the Iraqis to live and not die,'' Saddam told the
Austrian reporters.
   ``So it is the duty of Americans now to bear in mind that they
must resort to a political solution and not to force, and to end
this tendency they have that they can have anything they want,'' he
said.
   After leaving Iraq for Jordan on Saturday, Waldheim gave a
lengthy interview to Cable News Network in which he said of Saddam:
   ``I have the impression that he still wants a negotiated
settlement. ... I personally insisted that one should try to find
such a settlement,'' Waldheim said.
   ``He realizes, of course, that the situation is very dangerous.
... He expressed his concern about the possibility of a military
confrontation, saying that he would be prepared for that, but that
he wants a negotiated solution and that he is still trying to get
this.''
   Saddam has repeatedly threatened to use trapped foreigners as
human shields to protect Iraqi installations against an attack by
tens of thousands of U.S. forces deployed in Saudi Arabia to
contain Iraqi aggression.
   In another indication that Iraq is carrying out that plan,
Japan's Foreign Ministry said 20 of its nationals and 20 other
foreigners, mostly Caucasians, were moved by bus Saturday from a
Baghdad hotel to an undisclosed location.
   The Security Council vote Saturday was a major victory for the
United States, which had sought U.N. authority to use force in
stopping trade with Iraq and thus force Saddam to end his
3-week-old occupation of Kuwait.
   The resolution allows navies in the gulf region ``to use such
measures commensurate to the specific circumstances as may be
necessary under the authority of the Security Council to halt all
inward and outward maritime.''
   Moscow had held up the resolution but later changed its position
and said it may even join the naval force. Because it is one of
five permanent Security Council members, the Soviet Union could
have vetoed the measure.
   The United States says Iraq is still receiving goods and even
military equipment. Iraqi oil tankers have recently anchored in
Yemen's harbor, and Iraqi goods are still passing through Jordan's
Red Sea port of Aqaba.
   It was not immediately clear what effect the U.N. resolution
would have in Aqaba, where Iraqi and Jordanian imports are
difficult to differentiate.
   The resolution covers only maritime shipping and not airlifts to
Iraq.
   Yemen and Cuba were the only countries that abstained from the
Security Council vote. Yemen's ambassador, Abdallah Saleh
Al-Ashtal, warned that any military action backing the sanctions
might lead to war.
   Yemen said Saturday that it was fully committed to honoring the
U.N. embargo and denied reports it serves as a base for Iraqi
warplanes.
   But diplomatic sources in the gulf region say Iraq has flown 12
captured Kuwaiti jet fighters to Yemen, and that prior to the
invasion it had based 36 Soviet-made Iraqi jet fighters at Ta'ez
south of Yemen's capital, San'a.

<HEAD>National Parks Warned To Brace for Cutbacks, Layoffs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CODY, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   National parks are being warned that they may
have to fire some employees, put others on unpaid temporary leave
or even shut down completely because of the federal budget crisis.
   ``We've sent a memo to every park superintendent telling them to
dust off their contingency plans to reduce operations,'' said
Harold Danz of Denver, the National Park Service's associate
regional director for administration. ``That could come to even
include closing of parks.''
   Yellowstone National Park managers said Friday they had received
the memo.
   Grand Teton National Park in Wyoming and Bighorn Canyon National
Recreation Area and Glacier National Park, both in Montana,
received similar memos and letters for employees, the Billings
(Mont.) Gazette reported Saturday.
   The federal budget, already bogged down by a huge deficit, is
being further stretched by the mounting costs of the massive U.S.
military buildup in the Middle East.
   Unless Congress and the White House compromise on a budget by
the end of next month, $100 billion in automatic cuts would take
effect.
   Federal agencies have therefore taken the unusual step of
warning employees that they might have to take unpaid furloughs of
up to 22 days to keep costs down. National Park Service employees
should receive the warning letters Monday, Yellowstone spokeswoman
Marsha Karle said.
   U.S. Forest Service, Bureau of Land Management and other
agencies will distribute similar letters next week.
   All federal workers are expected to receive similar letters by
the end of the month. The last time a furlough was threatened was
in 1982, when several thousand employees were kept from work for a
few days.
   Cutbacks could hit Yellowstone especially hard. The summer staff
is far smaller than in previous years snd rangers are struggling to
keep up with a record number of visitors.
   ``We have fewer people doing more with less,'' Karle said.
``This is all going to be hard for folks to take with morale
already down.''
   Congress is far behind this year in passing an appropriations
bill for the Department of the Interior.
   ``If there are no funds, there is no legal way to spend money,''
Danz said. ``But we have to look at an orderly closure.''
   During World War II, he said, similar cutbacks were required
because of military expenditures. National parks kept skeleton
staffs in parks but shut down most of their public services.
   Karle said if reductions come, only top Yellowstone Park
administrators and law enforcement rangers would probably continue
working.
   ``We're going to keep the park open as long as we can,'' Karle
said. ``But if we do run out of money, we may have to take hard
steps to cut down.''

   Freed hostage Brian Keenan, who flew home
to Ireland Saturday, said he saw American hostages Terry Anderson
and Thomas Sutherland during his four-year captivity in Lebanon and
that both had been well.
   ``It's an understatement to say I'm delighted to be home,'' he
said, his voice breaking as he read a statement in Dublin. ``It's
where the heart is, you know.''
   Keenan, 39, looking pale but otherwise physically fit, earlier
had an emotional reunion with his two sisters in the Syrian
capital, Damascus, almost 24 hours after he was freed by his
captors in Beirut.
   In his comments in Damascus, he did not say when he had seen the
two Americans. He described Anderson as being comforted by a
picture of his daughter, Sulome, and said Sutherland entertained
his fellow hostages with jokes and stories.
   He said he had seen British hostage John McCarthy only two days
ago, but did not mention any other hostages.
   His hair cut short and his beard neatly trimmed, Keenan
struggled to hold back tears as he sat between his sisters, Elaine
Spence and Brenda Gillham. He read the statement to reporters in
Dublin but took no questions.
   Keenan said he had spent ``a long 4{ years (in captivity) and it
sometimes seemed like 4{ lifetimes.''
   ``On my way here, I thought of what I was going to do,'' he told
reporters. ``And finally, I said to myself I would eat all the food
in the world, drink all the drink in the world and make love to all
the women in the world, and then maybe I'll get a good night
sleep.''
   Keenan said he was overwhelmed by his homecoming, ``but another
part of me goes back to those men who are left behind.
   ``They're somewhere out there; somewhere in here,'' he said,
pointing toward his heart.
   After Keenan left, his sisters spoke briefly with reporters.
   ``As you see he still has his wit and his humor. His character
is still very strong. He is the same Brian that left us 4{ years
ago,'' said Mrs. Spence.
   Asked why her brother's voice was so weak, Mrs. Spence said he
spoke in a whisper because he communicated that way with the other
hostages and hasn't gotten used to raising his voice yet.
   Keenan's sisters arrived in Syria with Irish Foreign Minister
Gerry Collins and a doctor and a nurse. They all flew back to
Ireland three hours after Keenan was formally turned over to
Collins at the Syrian Foreign Ministry.
   A welcoming cheer went up as Keenan stepped off a government jet
at Dublin airport onto a red carpet. He was warmly embraced by
Prime Minister Charles Haughey.
   Keenan opened his arms to the crowd and then clasped his hands
over his head in delight.
   Keenan, wearing a sweater his mother had knit for him, clasped
his two sisters to him and blew kisses to the crowd of about 500
before going into the VIP lounge for a private reunion with more
than 20 relatives.
   In Damascus, he told reporters, ``I saw Terry Anderson some time
ago.
   ``He's in good form ... and he appreciates the letters that he
received from his family.''
   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, is the longest held of the 13 Westerners believed held
captive by Moslem extremists in Lebanon. He was abducted March 16,
1985.
   Anderson and Sutherland are among six Americans remaining in
captivity, along with two West Germans, an Italian and four Britons.
   Of Sutherland, 56, of Fort Collins, Colo., Keenan said: ``He's
well.''
   ``He has told us an entire repertoire of jokes ... and Dr.
Sutherland is in good health and regularly exercising,'' Keenan
said. Sutherland was kidnapped June 9, 1985.
   Anderson has never seen his 5-year-old daughter, who was born
almost three months after he was kidnapped. But Keenan said, ``He
has a picture of his daughter, Sulome, which is some great
companionship for him.''
   Keenan also said he had seen McCarthy, a reporter for the
London-based Worldwide Television News, two nights ago. He said
McCarthy was well.
   ``John's good humor... was very much appreciated and brought in
all of us who came in contact with him a real sense of the outside
world,'' Keenan said.
   McCarthy, 33, was captured April 17, 1986. The other Britons are
Terry Waite, the envoy of the Archbishop of Canterbury, and Alec
Collett and Jack Mann.
   Waite disappeared in Beirut on Jan. 20, 1987, while seeking the
release of other hostages.
   Anderson's sister Peggy Say, told of Keenan's comments, said:
``I'm anxious to talk to Brian and to get more details about
Terry's mental, emotional and physical health.''
   ``Of course, I'm very pleased for the Keenan sisters and their
family. But unfortunately, our experience has been in the past that
when a single hostage is released, that doesn't necessarily mean
that we are going to see another one for some time,'' she said by
telephone from her home in Kentucky.
   Keenan was handed over Friday to Syrian army officers in Beirut,
the Lebanese capital, after a little-known group calling itself The
Organization of the Islamic Dawn said he would be released.
   Until the kidnappers' statement Friday, no group had claimed
responsibility for Keenan from the time he was abducted until he
was freed.
   The fifth Western hostage freed in as many months, Keenan was
kidnapped April 11, 1986, in west Beirut while walking to the
American University where he taught English.
   He was born in Belfast and was traveling on an Irish passport,
but he has dual Irish-British citizenship.
   Prior to Keenan's release, the only other statement on hostages
from The Organization of Islamic Dawn was when it announced April
30 it was releasing Frank Reed, an education administrator from
Malden, Mass.
   Hostage Robert Polhill of New York was freed April 22, and two
Swiss Red Cross workers, Elio Erriquez and Emmanuel Christen, were
freed this month.

<TEXT>
   The map of Iraq is elaborately marked and
circled, pinpointing potential targets if shots are fired in the
Persian Gulf standoff.
   Until recent days, U.S. military planners focused on Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein's troop positions, including a
concentration of forces along the Kuwait-Saudi border, a
crescent-shaped formation further north near Kuwait City and supply
routes back to Iraq.
   Now convinced there is enough U.S. firepower on the ground to
thwart any Iraqi attack, strategists at the American command post
here are mulling ways to use their might against Iraq should
hostilities erupt.
   ``Right after the invasion of Kuwait, we had to hurry, so it was
a come-as-you-are war,'' a Pentagon source said. ``That was more
than two weeks ago. Now, for us, it's a do-as-you-please war.''
   There are numerous political, economic and military factors that
would influence any decision to make an all-out assault on Iraq, an
attack that American officials stress is highly unlikely unless
Iraq fires first. Complicating all planning is Iraq's grasp on some
10,000 Western hostages, including 3,000 Americans.
   But it is clear from interviews and reviews of U.S. intelligence
and planning over the past week that such a plan is in place and
being refined virtually daily, as spy satellites, AWACS tracking
planes and other intelligence sources provide information on Iraqi
military activities.
   After spending their first week here reluctant to discuss
contingency plans, many officers in the past week, at several
command levels, have discussed such plans privately, if for no
other reason than to send a signal to Saddam.
   ``We know when they are loading gas into their trucks,'' an Army
colonel said Friday. ``We'll be ready if they come, and ready to go
after them too.''
   Vietnam-era generals leading the deployment in Saudi Arabia
favor an overwhelming attack on Iraq if fighting erupts. That would
include destruction of key government facilities in Baghdad, Iraqi
oil fields and military installations and infrastructure used to
resupply Iraqi forces in Kuwait and near Iraq's border with Saudi
Arabia, according to a number of military sources here.
   The command post for the Persian Gulf deployment, dubbed
Operation Desert Shield, has been at the Central Command
headquarters in Florida, but a makeshift war room will be opened in
Saudi Arabia within days.
   ``I came out of one briefing the other day hearing B-52s humming
in my head,'' one senior officer said this past week. A field
commander privy to some of the contingency plans put it this way:
``These guys have decided if we go, we go all out, none of this
halfway bull shit.''
   The options, according to the officials, include bombing runs,
use of naval firepower from a battleship and other ships in the
Persian Gulf, and even ground forces if necessary to knock out key
Iraqi installations and block supply and communications routes.
   American aircraft have been flying 24 hours a day on practice
missions and to counter Iraqi air patrols. Elements of the 82nd and
101st airborne divisions have been briefed on possible Iraqi
targets. The 82nd consists of paratroopers; the 101st has attack
helicopters and can deploy infantry from helicopters as well.
   Members of the 82nd have been told their division might be
dropped into Iraq or just over its border with Kuwait to cut off
supply routes, according to the sources.
   Massive amounts of U.S. military force continue to pour into
Saudi Arabia and the waters that surround the Arabian peninsula.
For example, the first shipments of huge M-1 tanks are just
offshore and once unloaded will immediately move to forward
positions in the Saudi desert. The M-1s, from the Army's 24th
Infantry Division (Mechanized), will join Marine M60-A1 tanks
already on the ground.
   Backing up the tanks are formidable deployments of tank-fighting
helicopters, A-10 planes and other heavy weapons stationed in the
Saudi desert _ some at airstrips not even on most maps. These
strips are well within striking distance of Iraqi targets in both
Kuwait and Iraq.
   A ground war against entrenched Iraqi positions in Kuwait would
be bloody, planners say, and the air attacks necessary to support
the ground troops likely would level much of Kuwait. Kuwaiti
government officials, now living in exile in Saudi Arabia, have
implored U.S. officials not to wage such a fight.
   Less bloody, and potentially devastating to Saddam's power,
would be a direct assault on selected Iraqi targets, which if
successful would create chaos in the government and choke off
supplies and reinforcements to the Iraqi forces in Kuwait.
   Air Force jets stationed in Saudi Arabia and on Navy carriers in
the Persian Gulf and Red Sea are within range of Iraqi targets, as
are F-111 bombers in Turkey and long-range B-52s from Diego Garcia.
   The Pentagon said Saturday that more F-111s, which the United
States has used previously against Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi,
were being moved from Britain to Saudi Arabia.
   U.S. officials believe there is enough firepower here to defend
Saudi Arabia from any forward attack from Kuwaiti territory during
such an assault on Iraq.
   There are concerns that Iraq would launch chemical-carrying Scud
missiles into Saudi Arabia if the United States moved against Iraqi
targets.
   But American and Saudi military officials say the missiles
travel slowly, and jets and ground-to-air missile systems should be
able to destroy them in flight. Saudi officials this week confirmed
reports that Scud launchers had been moved into Kuwait. However, an
American military intelligence source disputed that, while
acknowledging that Scuds stationed in southern Iraq still could
reach Saudi targets.

   The Bush administration has vastly overestimated
the viewership of TV Marti, whose broadcast since March has been
marked by Cuban government jamming, according to a report Saturday.
   The U.S. Information Agency estimated that 1 million to 7
million Cubans watched the new station, which broadcast American
entertainment and news shows to the communist-ruled island from
Florida.
   But the General Accounting Office, in an unpublished report
obtained by The Miami Herald, cited notes by U.S. diplomats who
estimated an audience of only 50,000 to 70,000.
   The GAO, the investigative arm of Congress, faulted the USIA's
methods in two viewership surveys, which polled Cuban refugees and
emigres arriving at Miami International Airport between March 28
and May 12.
   The survey subjects ``would be more interested in and aware of
TV Marti than the general population'' because they were leaving
Cuba, the GAO report said.
   The first report prepared by USIA's Radio Marti research and
policy staff in Miami concluded the station was ``received in
practically all of the Cuban territory with acceptable quality''
for potential viewing by 7.3 million Cubans.
   A second report prepared by a research firm under contract to
USIA estimated 1 million to 1.3 million Cubans tuned in during the
station's first six weeks on the air.
   The station began transmitting on March 27. Its signal
frequently is beamed to Havana from 3:45 a.m. to 5:59 a.m., when
state-run stations are not transmitting. Officials have said TV
Marti's directors do not want to overlap with Cuban stations both
for technical reasons and to avoid further aggravating the Cuban
government.
   TV Marti's signal often is partially blocked by Cuban jamming.
   GAO investigators said 21 percent of the 112 airport arrivals
who responded to the USIA survey said they watched TV Marti on four
days when there were no broadcasts.
   The GAO report was requested by U.S. Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich.,
chairman of the House Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations.
   TV Marti is an extension of the Radio Marti coverage launched by
the Reagan administration in its campaign against Cuban president
Fidel Castro.

   Elite army troops joined
police patrols in black townships Saturday as part of a government
crackdown on factional fighting that has killed more than 500
people.
   Soldiers wearing full combat gear went door-to-door at migrant
worker hostels in the Vosloorus township southeast of Johannesburg,
confiscating the crude weapons used in street fighting between
Zulus and township residents.
   Armored police vehicles stood guard as the soldiers rounded up
spears, knives, machetes, clubs and other weapons.
   No serious fighting was reported for a second straight day in
the townships near Johannesburg after almost two weeks of clashes
between Zulu backers of the conservative Inkatha political movement
and Xhosas mostly loyal to the African National Congress.
   However, a grenade exploded late Saturday at a train station
east of Johannesburg, killing one person and injuring two, police
told the independent South African Press Association.
   Several recent blasts in the Johannesburg area have been blamed
on extreme right-wing whites opposed to government moves toward
sharing power with the disenfranchised black majority.
   Police said two more bodies from the factional fighting were
found Saturday, increasing the death toll to 514 since fighting
erupted Aug. 12. Government officials said 18,000 people had been
left homeless by the conflict.
   On Friday, the government declared the townships around
Johannesburg ``unrest areas,'' giving police widespread powers to
suppress violence. It also ordered in more soldiers and police to
control the chaos.
   Demonstrations against the violence and alleged police bias
toward Inkatha were held in several cities Saturday. In Cape Town,
about 250 members of the ANC Women's League marched to criticize
the government for waiting so long to curb the fighting.
   The Soweto Civic Association called a work stayaway in the
township for Monday to ``protest the violence, police behavior and
to mourn our dead.'' More than 120 people have died in Soweto since
the fighting began.
   Police have denied accusations that they sided with Inkatha
fighters in the clashes. President F.W. de Klerk said Friday that
while a few individuals may have acted improperly, the force as a
whole followed orders to be impartial.
   Army commanders said three elite paratroop and infantry
battalions were being sent to the townships to aid police, along
with a battalion of exiled black Angolans who fought that country's
communist government in the mid-1970s.
   The ANC has charged that some members of the Angolan battalion
terrorized South African blacks in Natal Province earlier this year.
   Army officials declined to say how many troops were involved,
but most South African battalions have at least 500 soldiers.
   About 1,000 police and troops raided Kagiso township late Friday
and seized a large number of weapons, officials said. Police Capt.
Eugene Opperman said such raids might be conducted regularly.
   The government lifted a nationwide state of emergency in June in
all provinces except Natal, where fighting between Inkatha and ANC
forces has claimed about 5,000 lives in the past five years.
   The ANC had demanded lifting of the state of emergency as a
condition of formal talks with the white-led government on a new
constitution.
   ANC leader Nelson Mandela said Friday the new emergency measures
were unnecessary but would not derail negotiations with the
government on ending apartheid and sharing power with the black
majority.
   On Saturday, Defense Minister Gen. Magnus Malan said the ANC
continued to advocate violence, despite telling the government it
had suspended its armed struggle.
   Malan also said black leaders should quit blaming each other for
the violence and work together toward peace.
   Zulu leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi on Saturday accused the ANC of
starting the Johannesburg area violence. It was the latest in a
series of charges and counterclaims by the rival black opposition
movements.
   Buthelezi says the ANC is terrorizing Inkatha members to try to
wipe out any competition for power among black groups.
   The ANC claims Inkatha spread the political violence from Natal
to the Johannesburg area to try to broaden its constituency.

   The worst part about being a quintuplet isn't the
stares and finger-pointing of strangers.
   It's wearing the same clothes as four other kids born at the
same time who look like you.
   ``Whenever one of us spilled, all of us would have to go back
home and change,'' said Chanda Davis, 15.
   Davis, of Winnsboro, Texas, is literally one in a hundred. There
are only 20 full sets _ meaning all five children are still alive _
in North America. Nine of those families gathered in Chicago's
Grant Park Saturday in a promotional event for New Jersey-based
Tyco Industries, Inc., which was introducing its new line of dolls,
The Quints.
   Seventeen of the 20 mothers took fertility drugs, said Helen
Kirk, a board member for the Center for Study of Multiple Birth.
The Chicago-based center is an information and research center for
mothers carrying more than one child.
   The quintuplets and their parents spent the day tossing water
balloons, picnicking and talking about the trials and joys of
family life times five.
   Raising quintuplets is much like raising any other large family,
parents said. Many said they don't dress young quintuplets alike
out of spite _ it's an easy way to keep track of them in a crowded
mall.
   ``I know immediately what to look for,'' said Amy Chikaraishi of
Glenview, a suburb north of Chicago. ``I just do a quick head count
and if I'm one short, it's easier to find them.''
   Making sure each of his five-year-olds receives an equal amount
of attention and affection is one of the biggest chores for Gregory
Miller, a truck driver and supervisor in Bennett, Colo.
   ``Because they're all the same age, you can't spend time with
one-on-one activity, then time with another one doing something
different,'' Miller said. ``At the same time, you can't just treat
them as a group.
   ``We noticed that they were individuals with different
personalities right away, so we started treating them like that,''
he said.
   In the past five years, Miller said he's learned to be more
patient.
   ``Forget taking family pictures _ it's ridiculous,'' Miller
said, as event organizers frantically tried to round up all 45
children and keep them in one place long enough for photographers
to snap a picture.
   Not all quintuplets look alike, but those who do say outsiders
have trouble keeping them straight.
   ``Our teachers give up on our names,'' Davis said. ``They wind
up just pointing or saying, `You, there.'''
   It's not the only time Davis minds someone pointing at her.
   ``We hate it when people talk about it too much,'' Davis said.
``People still point and stare.''
   But she and her four identical sisters, Christa, Casey, Charla
and Chelsa do have some advantages.
   ``We get to share clothes,'' she said. ``And we spend a lot of
time together as a family. We've always done that.''

<HEAD>Tropical Storm Gustav, Depression Continue to Strengthen</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two storms were gaining strength in the eastern
Atlantic Ocean Saturday _ Tropical Storm Gustav and the ninth
tropical depression of the season, forecasters said.
   ``Both are Cape Verde-type storms,'' said hurricane specialist
Noel Risnychok of the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables.
``They are typical for this time of year.''
   Cape Verde storms _ named for a chain of islands off the west
coast of Africa _ have been some of history's most destructive, he
said.
   Gustav slid west at 15 miles per hour Saturday toward the Lesser
Antilles and the depression moved into the open Atlantic,
forecasters said.
   Gustav, the seventh named tropical storm of the 1990 Atlantic
hurricane season, had top sustained winds of 50 miles per hour at 6
p.m. EDT and was centered near 14.0 north latitude and 53.1 west
longitude, or about 515 miles east of the Lesser Antilles,
Risnychok said.
   Gustav was expected to maintain that motion through tonight and
no change in strength is expected, Risnychok said.
   The depression formed Friday morning, meanwhile, by Saturday was
located near 13.7 north latitude and 40.0 west longitude, or about
850 miles west southwest of the Cape Verde Islands.
   It was moving west with maximum sustained winds of 35 mph and
had a chance of strengthening into tropical storm Hortense late
Saturday night, Risnychok said.
   ``It only has to increase a few miles per hour, so the chances
are good,'' he said.

   Stories of a ghost lurking in a scene in the
movie ``Three Men and a Baby'' are scaring up business for video
stores nationwide.
   ``I was never a firm believer in ghosts or anything, but I'll
tell you the truth, it made the hair stand up on my arms,'' said
Jon Roup, who works at Network Video in Pittsburgh, which was
besieged by requests for the movie.
   Staff and customers of Music Plus in Marina del Rey, Calif.,
looked for the eerie figure Friday before all copies of the comedy
were rented.
   ``Everybody who's walked into the store today wants this
movie,'' said operations manager Ryan Bicknell.
   Viewers are transfixed by a scene in which Ted Danson and
Celeste Holm, co-starring as Danson's mother, walk by a window in a
home shared by characters portrayed by Danson, Tom Selleck and
Steve Guttenberg.
   Partially obscured in the window is what appears to many viewers
to be a young boy hiding behind a curtain.
   Some callers claim the figure is the ghost of a child who died
in a home where the film was shot.
   But Disney spokesman Steve Feldstein said viewers actually are
looking at a cardboard cutout or standee of a man in top hat and
tails. The 1987 movie was filmed on a Toronto sound stage, not a
private home, he said.
   Feldstein said the cutout was part of the set; a promotional
device for Danson's character in the movie.
   ``It doesn't look like a ghost,'' said Aaron Chu, the sales rep
at Movies and More in Los Angeles, which rented all eight of its
copies. ``There's no third dimension to the figure.''
   Despite Disney's explanation, many customers cling to their
ghostly beliefs. After all, ``Three Men'' was directed by Leonard
Nimoy, the former host of ``In Search Of,'' a television show
tracking strange phenomena.
   ``I believe it's just some kind of freak of nature or
something,'' said Tony Hostler, an employee at the Best Video
Rentals store in Pittsburgh. ``I put standups up all the time in
here, and it isn't big enough. You can't make out the kid's face,
and on a real standup they make sure you can.''
   Even before the craze, ``Three Men and a Baby'' was the No. 1
rental title in video history, according to Billboard magazine.

   As jurors in New York City weighed the
fate of three teen-agers charged in the Cental Park jogger case, a
jury 300 miles away heard the gruesome details of an attack on
another jogger raped and left to die.
   Two days after the three teen-age defendants in New York were
convicted for the Central Park attack, jurors in Syracuse on Monday
found 23-year-old Erwin Williams guilty of the 1986 rape and
attempted murder of a suburban woman.
   Both victims were women running alone, attacked by strangers
they were later unable to identify. Both trials involved black or
Hispanic defendants charged with attacking a white victim.
   But the Williams trial aroused little of the outcry that grew up
around the Central Park case. The New York trial was marked by
national media attention, demonstrations outside the courthouse and
accusations of racism by some black New Yorkers.
   In Syracuse, ``the racial thing has not come up at all,'' said
county legislator William Sanford, the first person to see the
jogger after the attack.
   ``It was bigger than that. It wasn't black or white, it was just
two animals out there ... nothing but animals.''
   The 40-year-old woman was raped, stabbed 11 times with a
penknife and left tied to a stake in the ground on Sept. 20, 1986.
As her attackers left, one said ``Die, bitch, die,'' she testified
in court.
   With the knife still protruding from her neck and one lung
partially collapsed, the woman freed herself and walked more than a
mile along the trail to Sanford's boathouse home.
   A second defendant, 32-year-old Ronald Jock, pleaded guilty in
July to attempted murder and testified against Williams.
   Even the plea bargain agreement with Jock, who is white, drew no
protest except from Williams' relatives, said defense attorney
William Rose. Williams is black.
   Assistant District Attorney Mary Felasco said the plea bargain
was offered to Jock because the victim did not want to testify at
two trials. Jock said his only involvement was tying the woman's
hands together and the victim's statements corroborated that,
Felasco said.
   ``It wasn't a racial issue,'' she said. ``Throughout our
investigation, Ronald Jock appeared to be the less culpable of the
two.''
   The situation in New York was one of a series of highly
publicized, racially charged incidents that have plagued that city,
said Van Robinson, president of the Syracuse branch of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People.
   While Syracuse is not immune to racial conflict, he said, ``you
don't have the heightened racial tensions here that you have in New
York.'' Some 150,00 people live in Syracuse and of them, roughly 16
percent are black.
   The passage of time between the attack and the arrests also
helped calm emotions, Robinson said.
   Arrests in the Central Park case came within days of the April
1989 incident. In Syracuse, it was more than 3{ years after the
September 1986 attack before Jock and Williams were arrested.
   Police received anonymous tips fingering the pair shortly after
the attack, but it was not until March 1990 that Williams'
estranged wife came forward with evidence that would end the
investigation.
   Outrage over the crime has not diminished, but has been tempered
by time, Sanford agreed. ``You go back four years, there was
community response,'' he said. ``The outpouring was tremendous.''
   Williams was 19 when he and Jock attacked the woman as she
neared the end of a 9-mile jog along the running trail at Onondaga
Lake Park in Geddes, a suburb of Syracuse.
   There in the leafy woods beside the trail, the jogger was raped
and stabbed. The woman testified that the man who tried to strangle
her said, ``She just won't die. She won't die.''
   ``She's an amazing woman,'' said Sanford. ``I don't think I ever
saw her in a situation where she wasn't in control. I think she was
an unbelievable example of the extent that a person can control her
destiny, whether she was going to live or die.''
   Sanford said the arrests and convictions give him a feeling of
relief that he hopes the victim shares.

<HEAD>Scowcroft: U.S. Now Has Free Hand To Enforce Embargo</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: Inserts grafs 7-9, ``Meanwhile, the New York xxx to include
report of possible political asylum for Iraqi tanker crews</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>KENNEBUNKPORT, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United Nations has given the
Bush administration a free hand to enforce the economic embargo
against Iraq, President Bush's national security adviser said
Saturday.
   But Brent Scowcroft sidestepped a question of how much force the
United States was willing to use to choke off commerce to and from
Iraq.
   Asked during a Cable News Network interview whether the United
States planned to board, seize or even sink ships moving goods
between Iraq and other nations, Scowcroft said only that American
vessels will use ``the minimum amount of interference with traffic
in order to make the sanctions effective.''
   The U.N. Security Council early Saturday adopted a resolution
calling for military enforcement of the embargo against Iraq. The
resolution was approved 13-0, with Cuba and Yemen abstaining.
   Scowcroft said the U.N. action ``means no commerce should go in
and out (of Iraq) by sea and that means that vessels will be
stopped and inspected,'' effective immediately.
   Asked whether the United States now had a free hand in the
Persian Gulf to do as it wants in enforcing the blockade, he said
``I believe that's the case.''
   Meanwhile, the New York Times reported in Sunday's editions that
the administration is studying the possibility of offering
political asylum to the crews of Iraqi vessels to persuade them to
cooperate with the embargo.
   The idea is to persuade the crews to give up without resorting
to violence, the paper reported, quoting administration and
Pentagon officials who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   American intelligence officials say the tanker crews are under
orders from Baghdad to ignore warnings to halt, even if fired upon,
and face execution if they allow U.S. forces to board, the paper
said.
   At the Pentagon, a senior official who spoke on condition of
anonymity said he did not foresee any immediate conflict involving
ships, and that the two Iraqi ships the Navy fired upon last
weekend were continuing to be monitored.
   ``I don't sense that there's anything out there about to
happen'' because of the U.N. action, the official said.
   Scowcroft's comments came as administration officials protested
the interruption of electricity to the U.S. Embassy in
Iraqi-occupied Kuwait and as Iraq's ambassador to the United States
said the wives and children of American diplomats who fled Kuwait
to Baghdad were free to go.
   U.S. officials said Iraqi soldiers maintained their blockade of
the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait City and the embassy was operating on
generator power. Water also had been cut off.
   White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk said the administration had
expressed its objections through diplomatic channels in Baghdad,
Kuwait and Washington.
   ``The embassy continues to function. It is carrying out its
consular functions,'' said Popadiuk, in Maine with the vacationing
Bush.
   He added, ``A small contingent of Iraqi soldiers ... continues
to maintain its presence outside the embassy.''
   Bush received an intelligence briefing and monitored the
situation while continuing his three-week vacation.
   The Voice of America radio advised the 2,500 Americans trapped
in Kuwait not to go near the embassy while the soldiers remained,
even though there appeared to be no attempt to take over the
compound.
   The State Department broadcast on VOA said the embassy was
``determined to continue working for your release from Kuwait and
your safe return to your families.''
   Scowcroft said the power had apparently been returned to the
British embassy but that it was ``a very fluid situation'' at all
the western diplomatic missions.
   U.S. officials said telephone service to Kuwait was sporadic,
but they were maintaining phone contact with Ambassador Nathaniel
Howell and his staff of about 10 diplomats, who stayed behind to
keep the embassy open in defiance of Iraq's order to close it on
Friday.
   Scowcroft said negotiations were under way in Baghdad to permit
the departure of some 100 U.S. diplomats and dependents who were
being detained after they evacuated the embassy in Kuwait on an
Iraqi promise they could leave from the Iraqi capital.
   Mohamed Sadiq al-Mashat, Iraq's ambassador to the United States,
said Saturday in Washington the wives and children of American
diplomats who fled Kuwait to Baghdad were free to go but that the
diplomats would be treated ``just like anybody else.''
   He did not register any direct threat to the diplomats or any of
the more than 3,000 U.S. citizens trapped in Iraq and Kuwait.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, in a television news conference
Saturday, warned the United States to pursue a diplomatic solution
to the volatile situation or risk great bloodshed.
   The White House welcomed the U.N. vote. In a statement from
Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater, the administration singled out
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev for praise. Moscow voted for the
resolution after balking for several days.
   Gorbachev sent an urgent message Friday to Saddam urging him to
comply with the U.N. orders to get out of Kuwait.
   Gorbachev's statement ``was a very important development,''
Fitzwater said.
   Meanwhile, the Navy announced Saturday that it had called up 127
reserve units from 34 states and the District of Columbia.
   In addition, the Army released a list of 173 National Guard and
reserve units from 37 states, Puerto Rico and the District of
Columbia it said might be called to duty before Oct. 1.
   In Omaha, Neb., the Air Force's Strategic Air Command confirmed
that it sent B-52 heavy bombers from two U.S. air bases overseas
two weeks ago. SAC did not, however, indicate how many had been
dispatched or where they had been sent.
   The U.S. response to the Persian Gulf crisis sparked a
demonstration Saturday in front of the White House. The National
Park Service said there were about 140 participants.

   The Boston Symphony Orchestra players tuned, then
laid down their instruments before a note had been played. Stage
lights blinked off during a performance of Shakespeare. Unemployed
ballet dancers lighted candles in a vigil.
   All around the Berkshire hills, at precisely 8:30 p.m. Saturday
night, about 30 groups taking part in the traditional summer
festival stopped dead for three minutes to protest reduced
government funding and censorship of the arts, said ``arts
blackout'' organizer Frank Bessel.
   ``The primary consideration is to recognize culture as a
priority, even as an election issue. More and more people are not
getting (a moral education) or they're getting it from television
sitcoms,'' said Bessel, artistic director of the Berkshire Public
Theatre in Pittsfield, in western Massachusetts.
   The protest also was aimed at the National Endowment for the
Arts, which has cut the funding of some controversial artists.
   At Tanglewood, a retreat for The Boston Symphony Orchestra,
Managing Director Kenneth Haas stopped the musicians shortly after
they tuned their instruments, said BSO spokeswoman Kim Smedvig.
   Haas told the audience of 10,000 that ``across the Berkshires at
this moment, theater, dance and musical performances are being
interrupted or delayed to request a few minutes of reflection on
the importance of art in our lives and the problems we are facing
as result of a loss of government support.''
   The symphony, the most popular cultural attraction in the
Berkshires, has spent each summer since 1937 at the former country
estate in Lenox, about 130 miles west of Boston.
   Lenox' population of 6,500 doubles each summer as urbanites
arrive to beat the heat and immerse themselves in the arts.The
local economies rely heavily on the tourist trade.
   In nearby Pittsfield, about 100 members of Berkshire Ballet and
their supporters held a candlelight vigil. The dancers lost their
jobs when the summer season was canceled because of cuts in federal
and state arts funding.
   At Shakespeare &amp; Company in Lenox, the stage lights went down
and actors stopped the comedy ``As You Like It'' at the end of a
wrestling scene.
   ``Because we're outdoors, it was in complete darkness. (The
audience) could see the outline of the white clothing of the actors
on stage. And when the lights were restored, the audience
applauded,'' said Dennis Krausnick, the company's managing director.
   The last line before the blackout was ``bear him away,'' said
Krausnick. ``We thought it was appropriate because that's what
might happen to the arts.''
   The Hubbard Street Dance Company from Chicago, performing at the
Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival in nearby Becket, delayed the start
of ``Read My Hips,'' an American jazz dance piece choreographed by
Daniel Ezrlow, said Sam Miller, a festival spokesman.
   The Berkshire Public Theatre is showing Larry Gelbart's
``Mastergate,'' a political farce based on the Iran@Contra scandal.
The lights went down just as an actor portraying a senator
investigating the scandal rapped his gavel three times.

<HEAD>Iraqis Detain Pregnant Woman, More Britons; Teen-ager Returns Home</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraqi troops detained four Britons, including a
pregnant woman, in Kuwait on Saturday, but a British teen-ager
returned home after being released on orders of Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher condemned the detention of the
pregnant woman as ``totally contemptible behavior.''
   The woman, who is due to give birth in two or three weeks, was
stopped by Iraqi soldiers at a roadblock in Kuwait City as she was
returning from a checkup at a clinic, the Foreign Office said.
   She is being held with her husband at a hotel, the Foreign
Office said. Three other Britons were also detained in Kuwait City.
   That brings to 139 the number of Britons seized by Iraqis since
they invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2 and annexed the oil-rich emirate.
   A protest about the detentions was lodged by the remaining
officials at the British Embassy in Kuwait City, which was
surrounded by Iraqi troops armed with machine guns and mortars.
   Meanwhile, in London, 15-year-old Alan Barnett enjoyed a reunion
with his parents at Gatwick Airport.
   He was one of the British hostages shown meeting Saddam in a
tape broadcast Thursday on Iraq's state television and shown
worldwide.
   The 15-year-old said he had brought a package of letters from
other hostages to be delivered to their relatives at home. He said
he and the other hostages were not mistreated by the Iraqis.
   ``We were given a fair amount of freedom, and the Iraqis were
quite nice to us. They didn't push us around or anything like
that,'' he said.
   He said the people he left behind ``are close together and fine.
But they are expecting to be held for several weeks or even
months.''
   The teen-ager said he had been traveling alone on a British
Airways flight heading from London to Madras, India and Malaysia
that was stranded in Kuwait City during the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion.
He was later taken to Baghdad with other Britons and Americans on
the flight.
   In Baghdad, the hostages met with Saddam.
   ``Everyone was happy that their questions were answered on the
video,'' he said. ``We didn't know in advance we were going to be
filmed. Everyone at the recording was quite relaxed.''
   He said his release followed an order from Saddam.
   ``One of my friend's mothers told the president I was 15 years
old and unaccompanied,'' he said. ``The president, through a
translator, asked me if I wanted to leave. I said `yes.' The next
thing I heard was that I was going home.''
   He added: ``I just wish they had let everyone else go as well.''
   He flew from Baghdad to the Jordanian capital of Amman on
Thursday and then waited for a flight home.

<HEAD>Haiti's President Replaces Five Ministers After Resignations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL NORTON</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ President Ertha Pascal-Trouillot
replaced five Cabinet members who resigned amid growing
dissatisfaction with her administration, the independent Radio
Inter reported Saturday.
   The five ministers resigned Friday, and their replacements will
be sworn in Monday.
   On Thursday, seven of the 12 political organizations that
appointed Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot president in March called for her
resignation and the postponement of elections scheduled for Nov. 4.
   Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot, a former Supreme court judge, came to
power after a weeklong popular uprising toppled military ruler Lt.
Gen. Prosper Avril. She heads a caretaker interim government whose
main task is to organize elections.
   But the president has been seen as weak and unable to control
the army. The last attempt at free elections in Haiti in November
1987 collapsed when attackers supported by the army killed at least
34 voters.
   On Saturday, Jean Claude Bajeux, co-leader of the socialist
Congress of Democratic Movements and a member of 12-party Unity
Assembly, criticized Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot for her quick
appointment of the five new Cabinet members.
   ``Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot has aggravated the crisis, since she has
appointed her Cabinet without the advice and consent of the Council
of State,'' he said.
   In a statement Aug. 15, the Council of State, which was set up
in March to govern alongside Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot, said the
president was an obstacle to holding free elections.
   At least two of the ministers said they were resigning because
of their unhappiness with the government.
   Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot has also been criticized for not doing
enough to enforce two arrest warrants issued for former officials
linked to the 29-year Duvalier family dynasty that ended in 1986.
   Roger Lafontant, the reputed head of the dreaded Tonton Macoutes
paramilitary police, and Williams Regala, a retired army officer
who has been linked to the November 1987 election massacre, remain
at large.
   They returned from exile in July, leading many citizens to think
there will be an attempt to disrupt the upcoming elections.
   Haiti has had five governments since Jean-Claude ``Baby Doc''
Duvalier fled to France in 1986.
   Replacing the five ministers who resigned on Friday are Andre
Jean-Louis in Agriculture, Jean Mainville in Commerce, Chavannes
Douyon in Education, Alex Toussaint in Foreign Relations and Carlo
Desinor in Foreign Affairs.
   All are career civil servants except Desinor, the outgoing
information minister. He will be replaced in that post by Alfred
Mentor.
   Onill Millet, former director of the Central Bank, was named
minister of finance, filling a post that has been vacant since July
23.

   Thomas Willson McKnew, chairman emeritus of
the National Geographic Society, died Friday of pneumonia. He was
94.
   McKnew participated in financing hundreds of research projects
in geology, archaeology, anthropology, botany, astronomy and
related sciences since joining the National Geographic in 1932. He
was named chairman emeritus in 1987.
   As assistant secretary of the society, McKnew served as project

<TEXT>
   Yo, Bill. Rest easy, dude. You're still No. 1.
   In the most-hyped family feud of the new TV season, overnight
ratings released Friday showed that venerable Bill Cosby and the
genteel Huxtables thrashed skateboarding Bart Simpson and his
acid-tongued cartoon family.
   NBC's kinder, gentler ``The Cosby Show'' averaged a 15 rating
for Thursday night. Fox Broadcasting Co.'s grousing, dysfunctional
``The Simpsons'' captured an 8.4, according to the A.C. Nielsen Co.
Each ratings point represents 921,000 homes.
   Thursday's national overnight figures marked the highest showing
all summer for Cosby, which ranked 12th in last week's standings.
``The Simpsons,'' in its old Sunday night time slot, ranked fourth
for the same period.
   Since Fox announced this summer that ``The Simpsons'' would go
toe-to-toe with NBC's longstanding ``Cosby'' hit beginning Thursday
night, the showdown has taken on new proportions in television hype.
   Cosby, wearing a Bart T-shirt captioned ``Yo, Bill,'' is on next
Friday's cover of Entertainment Weekly. NBC entertainment president
Brandon Tartikoff walked into a press conference last month and was
greeted by more than 100 television critics wearing Bart Simpson
masks.
   In typical television spin control, both networks claimed
victory in their first round of battle.
   ``We're thrilled,'' said Brad Turell, a spokesman for Fox, which
has 75 fewer affiliates than NBC.
   ``You're not the No. 1 show of the decade for nothing,'' said
Preston Beckman, NBC vice president of audience research.
   Thursday's ``Simpsons'' offering in its new, 8 p.m. time slot
was a third repeat of an episode highlighted by the decapitation of
a city hero's statue by 10-year-old Bart.
   ``The Cosby Show'' was a rerun of a bloopers special first
telecast during the February sweeps period.
   ``What we saw last night is there's room for Cosby and there's
room for Fox and there's room for the other networks,'' said
Beckman.
   Fox, which has said all along its strategy was not to topple
Cosby, but to come in second, achieved that.
   ``Father Dowling Mysteries'' on ABC and ``48 Hours'' on CBS tied
for last place with a 7.4 average.
   Both Fox and NBC said they expected their Thursday night ratings
to change when original episodes begin airing. Both expect an
increase.
   ``The Cosby Show'' premieres its new season on Sept. 20. ``The
Simpsons,'' because of the time-consuming animation process, won't
debut until late October.
   Cosby is ``working his butt off to make this a great year,''
Beckman said. ``We acknowledge and respect `The Simpsons' as a
legitimate hit show.''

   The Federal Election Commission sued the
National Republican Senatorial Committee Friday, accusing it of
illegally funneling nearly $2.7 million raised through solicitation
letters from George Bush to a dozen GOP campaigns in 1986.
   The suit, filed in U.S. District Court, accuses the Senate
campaign arm of the National Republican Committee, of violating a
contribution ceiling of $17,500 that party organizations can make
to a single candidate.
   All 12 of the GOP Senate candidates subsequently lost to
Democrats in the November general election.
   The commission filed the suit in U.S. District Judge Gerhard A.
Gesell's court in response to his ruling last January reversing the
FEC's decision to dismiss a portion of a complaint by Common Cause
against the Senate GOP committee.
   Common Cause, a citizens lobbying group, filed the complaint
with the FEC a week before the 1986 general election. It alleged
that the Republican committee's ``bundling'' of contributions
raised from Bush's letter and dispersing them to the 12 candidates
circumvented the party spending limits.
   In September 1986, the committee mailed out in mass some 24
different versions of Bush's solicitation letter _ each mentioning
four states in which Senate campaigns were occurring but not the
names of the GOP candidates. Bush was vice president at the time.
   The returning checks from donors were made out to the National
Republican Senatorial Committee or an organization under its
control _ such as the ``Inner Circle'' or the ``Republican
Presidential Task Force'' _ rather than the individual candidates'
campaigns.
   The committee, however, reported the contributions as going
directly from original donor to candidate.
   ``In some cases, individual donors had never even heard of the
candidates to whom they supposedly had earmarked contributions,''
the FEC said in its lawsuit Friday.
   The FEC's general counsel said the committee's fundraising
tactics on behalf of the Senate GOP candidates violated the Federal
Election Campaign Act.
   However, the commission _ reflecting its composition of three
Republicans and three Democrats _ deadlocked on most of his
recommendations, effectively rejecting them in July 1988.
   However, the panel did find that the $534,000 the GOP committee
spent on the mass mailings without listing the money as a
contribution to the candidates violated the law.
   Five months later, the Republican committee agreed to pay a fine
of $20,000. However, Common Cause opposed the settlement and filed
suit in Gesell's court to reverse it.
   ``Our position is that this matter was closed in 1988,'' Bill
Canfield, the Republican committee's legal counsel, said Friday.
``We paid a civil penalty and we have a letter from the general
counsel of the FEC saying the matter is closed.''
   Canfield described the FEC as being ``caught between a rock and
a hard place'' because of Gesell's ruling last January. He said any
adverse ruling by Gesell _ ``who happens to be no friend of
Republicans'' _ in the suit filed Friday will be appealed by the
committee.

   A judge Friday dismissed charges against
a Greenwich millionaire who became the hero of sign-haters after he
was arrested for spray painting a real estate sign.
   Rene Anselmo, 64, said after the 10-minute hearing that he had
accomplished his goal of bringing attention to the proliferation of
signs in exclusive Greenwich, even though he didn't get to argue
his case before a jury as he had wanted.
   ``I'm going to concentrate on working on a new ordinance that
would totally ban the signs,'' said Anselmo, owner of Pan American
Satellite Co., which leases satellite time to television networks.
   Anselmo's lawyer, Philip Russell, said his client's conduct had
brought the sign issue up for public debate, ``which is what it was
intended to do.''
   Anselmo was arrested July 3 for painting a Coldwell Banker real
estate sign.
   ``A police car came by and the officer said `Do you need help?'
I said, `No, I've just been spraying this sign,' '' he said.
   Since then, public opiniohn has grown against advertising signs
commonly placed in front of homes by real estate and construction
companies.
   At a forum last week, hundreds of Greenwich residents cheered
when Anselmo said the town was drowning in a ``sea of signs.''
   Only one, a real estate broker, came out against Anselmo,
calling him a ``Robin Hood with a Bentley.''
   Zoning officials are considering the issue.
   Judge Sandra Villardy Leheny dismissed the charges against
Anselmo after prosecutor Steven Weiss argued the case belonged in
small claims court because it was a property damage dispute.
   Anselmo said Coldwell Banker sent him a bill for $108.10 after
he was arrested.
   He said he wouldn't pay the bill but offered to treat Coldwell
Banker officials to a lunch or dinner of the same value.

   The U.S. Postal Service is advising people not
to send packages through military mail address to soldiers in Saudi
Arabia.
   Spokesman Azeezaly Jaffer said Friday the only mail accepted at
military post offices (APO or FPO addresses) for those assigned to
Operation Desert Shield will be first-class letters up to 12 ounces.
   Items that don't meet the requirement or fail to pass Saudi
Arabian customs will be returned, Jaffer said. If packages
eventually are accepted, they may not contain alcoholic beverages
or pork products, he said.
   The restriction to letters is imposed by the Defense Department,
which has put a priority on shipment of military supplies, Jaffer
said. Mail to military post offices for soldiers serving abroad is
sent at regular domestic mail rates.
   Regular mail to Saudi Arabia or other Mideast addresses is not
affected by the restrictions, Jaffer said.
   The Pentagon said Friday it had established special addresses
for mail sent from the United States to U.S. soldiers, sailors and
airmen in Saudi Arabia.
   Mail for members of the Army, Air Force and Marine Corps may be
directed to Operation Desert Shield, APO New York 09848-0006.
   Mail for Navy and Marine Corps members on ships around the
Arabian Peninsula may be addressed to Operation Desert Shield, FPO
New York 09866-0006.
   Mail to individual Army members identified by name, rank and
service number may be sent directly to an Army Post Office number
set up for six of the Army units in Saudi Arabia. They are:
   _For the 101st Airborne Division, APO 09309.
   _For the 82nd Airborne Division, APO 09656.

<HEAD>Social Workers Oppose Physical Punishment of Children</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TAMARA HENRY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parents were advised Friday by a national
organization of social workers to stop spanking their children
because mild physical punishment could quickly escalate into abuse.
   An anti-spanking policy was adopted on a voice vote by the
primary governing body of the 130,000-member National Association
of Social Workers. The policy is an expansion of one opposing
physical punishment in school adopted six years ago.
   ``We are not simply trying to circumvent child abuse,'' said
Isadora Hare, the group's education commission staff director. ``We
also want to reverse the acceptance of using physical means to
resolve conflicts. There are more effective ways to discipline
children without using physical punishment.''
   Hare said that physical punishment is deeply ingrained in the
United States. A recent study showed that 81 percent of U.S.
parents use physical punishment on their children during 1982. More
than 60 percent spanked at least once a week.
   An estimated 3 million children have been kicked, bitten or
punched and about 2 million have been ``beaten up'' by parents some
time in their lives. The association said research has demonstrated
that most physical child abuse is an escalation of what a parent
intends only as discipline.
   Several European countries have laws banning parental use of
physical punishment. Sweden prohibited physical punishment of
children in 1979. Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Austria have since
passed legislation. England has launched a parent-focused campaign
called End Physical Punishment of Children.
   The idea to expand the 1984 ban of physical punishment in school
came last February when the association participated in a meeting
involving researchers and other national agencies that issued a
position statement opposing parental use of physical punishment.
   Hare said the latest action is ``a tremendously important
statement of principle. In terms of impact, it will be a slow
process of changing the way people feel about raising children.''
   The association is the world's largest organization of
professional social workers with members in the United States,
Puerto Rico and Europe. Social workers provide more than half of
the mental health counseling in this country.

   Health and Human Services Secretary Louis
Sullivan imposed a hiring freeze Friday as officials laid plans for
dramatic cuts that would be necessary if no federal budget
agreement is reached by Oct. 1.
   In a memorandum to the department's 118,000 employees, Sullivan
said the reductions under the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law would
``seriously affect this department's many programs, the people we
serve and our employees.''
   No budget compromise between the Bush administration and
congressional leaders is in sight.
   Even if the freeze on hiring from outside HHS and other
money-saving steps are taken, ``furloughs may still be necessary,''
Sullivan said in the memo.
   Kevin Moley, HHS assistant secretary for management and budget,
said most federal departments and programs would see their budgets
reduced by 31.9 percent if no agreement is reached.
   However, government officials believe that the required
across-the-board spending cuts of more than $100 billion would be
so severe that they would not remain in effect for long.
   In past years, lawmakers and the White House have agreed to roll
back Gramm-Rudman cuts after leaving them in place only briefly.
   In addition to furloughs at HHS, payments for such programs as
Medicare and Social Security would be delayed, and Medicare
payments would be cut by 2 percent, Moley said.
   Social Security Commissioner Gwendolyn King told Moley in an
internal memo that a $1.3 billion cut in personnel and
administrative costs would leave the agency too shorthanded to keep
up with changes in the benefit rolls, an agency spokesman confirmed.
   Social Security benefit payments would not be affected by the
Gramm-Rudman cuts.

<HEAD>FDA Not Ready To Blame Deaths On L-Tryptophan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration said Friday
it is too early to blame the deaths of 27 Americans who took
L-tryptophan directly on gene splicing.
   ``We are still not sure what caused the problem,'' said FDA
spokesman Jeff Nesbit.
   The FDA will review a petition filed by biotechnology watchdog
Jeremy Rifkin asking the agency to put on hold further approvals of
genetically engineered products, Nesbit said.
   Rifkin, president of the Foundation on Economic Trends, filed
his petition Friday, saying the L-tryptophan-linked deaths are the
first cases on record connecting a genetically engineered product
with human deaths and injuries.
   The 27 who died were among more than 1,500 Americans who
developed a rare blood disorder called eosinophilia-myalgia
syndrome, or EMS, after taking L-tryptophan.
   Until the FDA ordered all L-tryptophan off the market in March
because of its link to EMS, the dietary supplement was sold in
health food stores as a remedy for insomnia, appetite control and
depression.
   An Aug. 9 article in the New England Journal of Medicine
concluded that the Japanese chemical company whose product had been
linked with most of the EMS cases had made two changes in its
manufacturing process that could have caused the problem.
   The company, Showa Denko K.K., introduced a new strain of
genetically altered bacteria at about the same time it changed its
purification process for L-tryptophan. The changes occurred in 1988.
   ``The data from the New England Journal of Medicine article
suggest but don't prove a relationship of illness with ingestion of
tryptophan made with the aid of a bacillus that is bioengineered,''
the FDA said in a paper put out Friday.
   The agency also noted that ``a great number of products
(medicines and foods) continue to be made by fermentation
processes, many involving bioengineered organisms, with no apparent
deleterious effects on the health of people that use them.''
   But the FDA also said problems with their use must be thoroughly
investigated.

   Efforts to help Americans trapped in Kuwait
and Iraq and provide information to family members in the United
States have largely boiled down to trying to improve morale, the
State Department said Friday.
   The information offered to families is generally limited because
of the nature of the situation, the department said, adding there
is no information on the whereabouts of Americans rounded up by the
Iraqis and detained.
   ``I think the American community in Iraq and Kuwait is very
tense, concerned,'' said Nicholas Ricciuti, director of the
Citizens Emergency Center of the department's consular section.
   ``I think morale is probably the most practical purpose'' of the
State Department communication effort, he said.
   However, Ricciuti said the department had provided repatriation
money and emergency loans.
   ``We assist the Americans any way that we can,'' he said.
   At a briefing, Ricciuti said more than 25,000 phone calls had
been received by the Kuwait Task Force since the Aug. 2 Iraqi
invasion inquiring about the well being of Americans in the two
nations.
   The task force, staffed by more than 100 people in three shifts,
24 hours a day, has made more than 10,000 calls to families and
friends to relay information, Ricciuti said.
   The State Department says there are about 2,500 Americans in
Kuwait, of whom 1,984 have been identified by the U.S. Embassy.
There are some 500 Americans in Iraq.
   Gathering information has become difficult because of restraints
placed on U.S. diplomats in the two countries and because of the
belief that Iraq is monitoring telephone calls to learn the
locations of Americans, Ricciuti said.
   He said calls are kept short.
   ``We never say where they have moved for obvious reasons,'' he
said. ``We have been able to pass messages to families in the
United States and vice versa.''

   A family who fled across the Kuwaiti
border under the gunfire of Iraqi soldiers arrived home Friday,
waving American flags and hugging relieved relatives.
   Ray and Annette Shoopman, their daughter Kay Rashid and Mrs.
Rashid's two young children were welcomed with tears and hugs at
Huntsville's airport.
   Shoopman, 52, who was in the oil business in the Middle East,
said the family left behind all their belongings and escaped with
only the clothes they were wearing.
   After Iraq's invasion of Kuwait Aug. 2, the family decided to
make a run for the border when a Kuwaiti friend invited them to
meet to take part in a convoy of cars.
   Shoopman said the convoy took back roads along the Kuwaiti
border. The cars were stopped at one point by an Iraqi patrol and
told to turn around. He said they turned back, but took another
route toward the border.
   Mrs. Rashid said Iraqi patrols shot over the tops of the cars as
they approached the border.
   ``Yes, we were scared, but we didn't stop,'' she said. ``We knew
if we stopped they had us _ and we had come too far to stop.''
   Mrs. Rashid's husband, Adnan, escaped with the family from
Kuwait but remained in Saudi Arabia to help other relatives escape
from his native Kuwait.

<TEXT>
   Riot police tangled Friday with dozens
of anti-government demonstrators, who for a third straight night
occupied central University Square and blocked traffic.
   Protesters _ estimated by the Soviet news agency Tass as
``several hundred'' _ took over the square in the early evening,
shouting slogans demanding the resignation of President Ion
Iliescu. They blocked traffic and attacked a delivery truck that
tried to drive through.
   On Wednesday and Thursday evenings, demonstrators had
voluntarily dispersed when police arrived. On Friday, however,
hundreds of riot police were called in to form a rectangle around
the square's perimeter when protesters stood fast.
   Fellow demonstrators blocked off another section of the
boulevard about a half-mile north, burning piles of garbage on the
road. Police marched in formation up the boulevard and cleared that
area.
   Later, most of the demonstrators cleared the square, allowing
traffic to flow once more after a confrontation with the police
that at times broke into jostling and shouting between police and
demonstrators who charged them.
   Demonstrators threw rocks at police. One man hurled fire bombs
and then fled.
   No one was hurt. At least one man was arrested, police said.
   Police helicopters flew over at low altitude, drawing a chorus
of boos.
   Several anti-government demonstrations have occurred at the
square since June 13, when club-swinging police broke up 53-day
occupation. The police action led to violence in which six people
were officially reported killed.
   Unlike the previous demonstrations, organized by students and
others who accuse Iliescu and his associates of being thinly veiled
Communists, this week's rallies appeared mainly motivated by the
deteriorating economic situation and attracted mostly lower-income
workers.
   In December, Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu was overthrown
and executed in a violent revolution.
   In Sibiu, 150 miles northwest of Bucharest, on Friday, a
military court heard closing arguments in the trial of Ceausescu's
youngest son, Nicu, who is charged with genocide in resisting the
popular uprising..
   The five-judge panel postponed its verdict until Sept. 21, when
the court will reconvene in Bucharest.
   Nicu Ceausescu led the former Communist Youth League until 1987,
when he became party secretary in Sibiu.
   He is formally charged with ``complicity to genocide,'' accused
of ordering ordered security forces to fire on anti-government
demonstrators in Sibiu during the December revolution. Fighting in
Sibiu killed 89 people.

   Fire destroyed a wharf and a warehouse full
of rubber in the Port of New Orleans on Friday, sending black smoke
billowing over the Mississippi River and threatening nearby docks
and stores of coffee.
   Two firemen were injured fighting the blaze, which took four
hours to control and went to seven alarms.
   ``It is one of the largest fires in the history of the New
Orleans Fire Department,'' said Fire Superintendent William
McCrossen.
   Smoke from the burning Orange Street wharf engulfed the twin
spans of the Crescent City Connection bridge, which crosses the
river a few blocks downstream from the fire.
   Adjacent wharfs were evacuated, among them the Robin Street
wharf, where the paddlewheelers Delta Queen and Mississippi Queen
dock. Neither boat was in port.
   About 115 men, 25 fire trucks and other equipment were sent to
the scene. Port officials asked every available fireboat on the
lower Mississippi to pump river water onto the blaze, said port
director Ron Brinson.
   The cause of the fire was not known. Brinson said workers at
Colley's Warehouse on the Orange Street wharf found a small blaze
and were unable to put it out before it spread.
   As the blaze roared out of control, small explosions could be
heard inside the warehouse. The building collapsed about an hour
and a half after the first alarm, about noon.
   After that, firefighters concentrated on containing the fire.
The contents of the warehouse continued to burn and spew clouds of
heavy black smoke after the fire was declared under control.
   Brinson said the damage toll for the 150,000-square-foot,
70-year-old warehouse and its contents would be ``in the millions.''

<HEAD>Senate Candidate Demands Probe of Simon's S&amp;L Intervention</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Paul Simon, a frequent critic of the
government's handling of the savings and loan crisis, said Friday
he did nothing wrong when he helped a developer who owed millions
of dollars to a troubled thrift.
   But it quickly became a campaign issue as Simon's Republican
election opponent, Rep. Lynn Martin, sought an ethics investigation.
   Simon last month asked a California bank president to seek a
settlement of a lawsuit against a Chicago developer who raised
thousands of dollars for the senator's past three campaigns.
   Martin said she will file a formal complaint asking the U.S.
Senate Ethics Committee to determine whether Simon violated Senate
rules.
   Simon said Friday he was unaware the lawsuit against the
developer involved a troubled savings and loan, and did nothing he
hasn't done for thousands of constituents.
   First Nationwide Financial Corp., the bank that sued Simon
supporter Stephen Ballis, was trying to reach a settlement long
before Simon contacted them, a bank spokesman said.
   But Martin said the senator improperly used his influence on
behalf of Ballis, who raised as much as $10,000 for the senator.
   ``How often does Paul volunteer to call a bank president to
forestall foreclosure and negotiate deals for people who are not
raising money for his campaign?'' Martin said. ``This is not normal
procedure for members of Congress. You don't call bank presidents
to talk about loans.''
   Ballis, president of Dayton Resources Ltd., defaulted on a $5
million loan to Chicago-based Pathway Financial, F.A. San
Francisco-based First Nationwide received a $255 million pledge
from federal thrift regulators in December, 1988, for agreeing to
take over Pathway.
   In May, First Nationwide officials sued to foreclose on the
loan. After meeting with Ballis in Chicago, Simon called First
Nationwide President John Devine and asked if the bank could seek a
settlement.
   ``I said, `If you two can get together and work it out and avoid
litigation, it seems to me that it's in everyone's best
interest,''' Simon said. ``The taxpayers aren't out a penny.''
   The settlement's details were complete, but the agreement has
not yet been approved, said Dan Brigham, First Nationwide spokesman.
   Ballis' wife Elizabeth contributed $1,800 to Simon's re-election
and 1988 presidential campaigns, records indicate. Ballis' total
fundraising efforts for Simon totalled less than $10,000, said
campaign spokeswoman Ellen Golin.
   Simon, who held hearings on the savings and loan crisis in
Chicago last week, says he would make the same phone call today.
   ``Public relations-wise, you might reconsider it, but it was
clearly a proper thing to do,'' Simon said.
   Martin said Simon's intervention will become an issue in her
campaign to unseat him.
   ``I believe he is beatable on the issues. I believe he is
beatable on philosophy,'' she said. ``But it would be just as wrong
not to talk about this as it would be not to talk about the other
things.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Defense Department on Friday invoked a law
that will enable it to spend money it doesn't officially have to
pay for its operations in the Middle East.
   The law, the Feed and Forage Act, give the Pentagon the
authority to finance Operation Desert Shield until Congress can
appropriate the money, the department said in a statement. Congress
is in recess until after Labor Day.
   The Pentagon has estimated that the operation will cost some
$1.18 billion through the end of September.
   The law invoked by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney will allow the
department to spend money for ``clothing, subsistence, forage,
fuel, quarters, transportation and medical and hospital supplies,''
necessary for the rest of the year, the statement said. The fiscal
year ends on Sept. 30.
   The Pentagon plans to pay for chemical protection and combat
clothing, ship and aircraft fuel, medical supplies and food and
shelter for the U.S. forces, the statement said.

<HEAD>Clay Cancels Dallas Concerts, Citing Fear of Arrest</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Raunchy comedian Andrew Dice Clay has
canceled a Dallas concert because he's afraid of violating Texas'
strict anti-obscenity law, his publicist said Friday.
   Michael Levine said Clay canceled the show, scheduled for
Sunday, because ``we feared the possibility that Dice might be
subject to arrest, embarrassment and subsequently jailed.''
   The promoters of the concert announced Thursday that no one
under 18 would be admitted _ even with a parent. Dallas County
Assistant District Attorney David Pickett had said the performance
could violate state obscenity laws.
   A woman at Pickett's office said he had left for the day and no
one else was authorized to discuss the cancellation.
   Larry Fontana, manager of the Starplex Amphitheatre where Clay
was to perform, said the cancellation is ``just one of the things
that happens in this business.''
   He estimated promotion losses would be ``in the low
five-figures.'' Fontana said 6,000 of 7,000 available tickets were
sold at $22.50 each by Friday afternoon. They went on sale July 28.
   Clay, whose comedy act includes graphic descriptions of sex,
ethnic slurs and descriptions of women as ``whores'' and ``pigs,''
said in a statement: ``America is where people have always come for
freedom, and it's a shame that a noisy minority is now attempting
to tear down the right of free speech.''
   Members of several local civil rights groups had promised to
protest Clay's appearance. On Monday, the last local sponsor of the
concert, radio station KTXQ-FM, withdrew its support.
   Pickett's office has filed nine misdemeanor obscenity charges
against the music store chain Sound Warehouse for selling the rap
group 2 Live Crew's recording, ``As Nasty As They Wanna Be.''
   Fontana said Pickett's office placed ``an informational call''
to him a few days ago, ``saying citizens groups had contacted them,
concerned about the fact that Mr. Clay's material might be
obscene.''
   Fontana said he didn't take the phone call as a warning.
   ``We contacted Clay's people and our attorneys had discussions
with the district attorney's office, but the cancellation was
straight from Mr. Clay,'' Fontana said.
   Earlier this year, ``Saturday Night Live'' cast member Nora Dunn
and Irish pop singer Sinead O'Connor refused to appear with Clay on
the NBC program. Clay appeared in ``The Adventures of Ford
Fairlane,'' this summer but 20th Century Fox has decided not to
release a planned Clay concert film.

<TEXT>
   Tadzhikistan declared sovereignty on Friday after
a stormy six-hour parliamentary session in the Soviet Central Asian
republic, the independent news service Interfax reported.
   A measure passed by the republic's Supreme Soviet, or
parliament, declared that Tadzhikistan's laws will take precedence
over Soviet laws, it said.
   Tadzhikistan thus became the 13th of the Soviet Union's 15
republics to move toward greater autonomy.
   Only Kazakhstan and Kirghizia have made no such moves.
   Tadzhikistan said its declaration would be the basis for a new
constitution and treaty of union with the central Soviet
government, Interfax said.
   The agency said the parliament rejected a proposal to create a
separate army, saying Tadzhikistan has no money for its own army.
   On Thursday, Soviet Armenia took a more defiant step, declaring
independence on the same day the republic of Turkmenia declared
sovereignty.
   The declarations bring the Soviet Union closer to fragmentation.
   The three Baltic republics of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia
insist they want independence and want no part of President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev's plan to restructure the nation into a looser
confederation with more local autonomy.
   The Central Asian republics, which are predominantly Moslem,
have been more cautious to embrace the more radical course pursued
by nationalists in other republics.

   A former Northwest Airlines pilot convicted
in federal court of flying while intoxicated joined two
co-defendants Friday in pleading guilty to a similar charge in
North Dakota.
   Joseph Balzer of Antioch, Tenn., agreed to enter the plea on the
condition that it can be withdrawn if his federal appeal is
successful, said Cass County State's Attorney Robert Hoy.
   Norman Lyle Prouse of Conyers, Ga., and Robert Kirchner of
Highland Ranch, Colo., entered similar pleas with the same
conditions Thursday.
   Hoy said the appeal process could take eight to 10 months.
   The three were convicted in Minneapolis of flying a passenger
plane with 91 people aboard from Fargo to Minneapolis in March
while under the influence of alcohol.
   Cass County Judge Frank Racek on Friday sentenced Balzer to six
months in jail but suspended the sentence for one year. He was
ordered to pay a $500 fine and $500 to cover the costs of
prosecuting the case.
   Prouse and Kirchner received identical sentences Thursday.
   Hoy said the state dismissed a second count against the
defendants, which charged them with acting as aircraft crew members
within eight hours of consuming alcohol.

   An American Islamic leader on Friday urged
religious officials to repudiate the United States' military
buildup in the Middle East.
   Mohammad T. Mehdi, secretary-general of the National Council on
Islamic Affairs, called the military buildup ``a threat to
international peace'' and said it would ``create greater hostility
against America throughout the Moslem world.''
   In messages to various Catholic, Protestant and Jewish leaders,
Mehdi said: ``Peace in the Middle East and the world depends on the
religious community and our opposition to the war hysteria created
by President Bush.''
   So far, Christian and Jewish leaders have shown support in
principle for the U.S.-led actions against Iraq's takeover of
neighboring Kuwait.
   The American military establishment has been idle since the
Vietnam war and was ``itching for action to justify its
existence,'' said Medhi.
   American and other military forces were sent to Saudi Arabia at
that Islamic country's request, to prevent further agression by
Iraq. The United Nations approved economic sanctions against Iraq.
   The National Council of Churches, which includes most major
Protestant and Orthodox denominations, has denounced Iraq's
invasion and supported international resistance against it.
   However, it expressed hope for diplomatic solutions.
   Similar stands have been taken in recent days by Roman Catholic
and Jewish leaders. The Associated Press' attempts to those
religious leaders for comment on Mehdi's appeal late Friday were
unsuccessful.
   Mehdi termed absurd President Bush's claim that Operation Desert
Shield was needed to protect the American way of life, and said, in
apparent reference to the monarchies of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait:
   ``The protection of a few medieval kingdoms and princedoms can
never be vital for the protection of the American way of life.''
   The ``free flow of oil in world markets is assured, regardless
of who controls the Arab oil resources,'' Mehdi said. Whoever rules
will ``either have to sell the oil or drink it.''
   Mehdi urged religious leaders ``in the name of the one God we
worship to do your utmost to pressure the President to withdraw
American forces.''

   President Carlos Salinas de Gortari says
Mexico is willing to send troops to the Persian Gulf if the United
Nations asks its help in a multilateral force.
   ``We would be ready to participate in any manner that the United
Nations Security Council would decide,'' Salinas said in an
interview with syndicated journalist and cartoonist Ranan R. Lurie.
   ``If they consider that the presence of Mexico in a multilateral
force would be needed, it would be ready.
   ``We participated in World War II with a force with the Allies
and we would certainly respond to any request from the U.N.''
   Salinas' remarks in the interview this week were made available
to The Associated Press on Friday.
   The president was restating general government policy, but it
appeared to be his most direct comment on Mexico's approach to the
Persian Gulf crisis since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   The U.N. Security Council has ordered an embargo on all trade
with Iraq, but has not called for a multilateral U.N. force to join
Western and Arab forces already arrayed against Iraqi troops.
   Salinas did not respond directly when asked if he would send
troops if asked by the United States or Saudi Arabia, but indicated
he would need broad global backing for such a move.
   ``We are part of the world community and we will act along with
the world community,'' he said.
   ``I wouldn't hesitate to participate with the rest of the world
in what the world considers a just act.''
   The turmoil in the Persian Gulf has affected world oil supply.
Mexico is one of the largest crude oil producers outside the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
   Salinas said his country ``immediately opened the capacity of
oil production . . . to its limits, increasing it by 100,000
barrels per day in order to make a contribution to a stable world
market.''
   Asked what he expected of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein,
Salinas replied: ``He will not pull out of Kuwait.''

   A man convicted of plotting to kill a
Catholic priest who sexually abused him when he was a teen-age
altar boy was placed on three years probation Friday.
   Gregory J. Riedle, 26, of St. Paul, Minn., was arrested in May
after police got a tip he had come to this town in northern
Wisconsin with the intention of killing the priest, Thomas Adamson.
   Police found a butcher knife and a 4-foot long wooden club in
Riedle's car. In his hotel room, they found a letter addressed to
Riedle's girlfriend saying Adamson ``had to die.''
   District Attorney Raymond Pelrine said he recommended to Eau
Claire County Judge William O'Brien that Riedle be given probation
because no violence actually occurred. Police arrested Riedle
before he could find Adamson.
   Riedle had been charged with attempted first-degree intentional
homicide, but the charge later was reduced to attempted felony
battery.
   In an interview last week with the Eau Claire Leader-Telegram,
Riedle said he did not plan to kill Adamson, only to confront the
priest who sexually abused him when he was a 14-year-old altar boy.
   He said Adamson first approached him in a St. Paul YMCA
whirlpool and they had a sexual relationship for two years until
his family moved.
   ``As God as my witness, I would not have done anything,'' Riedle
said. ``I ain't got it in me to hurt people ... physically. I was
mad at him. I won't deny that. I've always been mad at him.''
   Riedle told police he brought the knife to commit suicide and
the club to protect himself from Adamson.
   Adamson moved to the Eau Claire area several years ago when he
was deactivated by the church after revelations of sexual liaisons
with Riedle and another altar boy.
   Riedle won a settlement from the Twin Cities archdiocese in 1988.

   A former beauty queen convicted of
strangling her ex-boyfriend's fiancee begged for mercy Friday
before being sentenced to life in prison with no parole for at
least 13 years.
   Lori Esker, 21, pleaded for a ``chance to start paying back all
the people I hurt so bad'' with the Sept. 20 murder of Lisa Cihaski.
   ``If I could trade places with Lisa, I would in a minute,'' Ms.
Esker, choking back tears, told Marathon County Circuit Judge
Michael Hoover.
   Hoover sentenced Ms. Esker to the required term of life in
prison and granted her request that she be eligible for parole in
13 years, four months, the minimum. The judge said her otherwise
clean record prevented him from setting a harsher minimum.
   A Circuit Court jury ruled in June that Ms. Esker killed Ms.
Cihaski, 21, because she was jealous of the victim's relationship
with her former boyfriend, 26-year-old Bill Buss, a dairy farmer.
   The Sept. 20 strangulation is something ``I will be punishing
myself for as long as I live,'' said Ms. Esker, the Marathon County
dairy princess last year. ``There isn't a day that goes by that I
don't think about what happened.''
   After sentencing, she was taken to the Taycheedah women's prison
near Fond du Lac. Her conviction was to be appealed.
   Ms. Esker, of the tiny farming community of Hatley, a few miles
from here, was convicted of first-degree intentional homicide,
which carries a mandatory life sentence.
   But Hoover was allowed to set the parole limit.
   ``It's as much a tragedy that has befallen the defendant's
family as the Cihaski family,'' Hoover said. ``No one expects the
Cihaski family to fully understand that, at least not today.''
   The Cihaskis declined to comment.
   Buss, who dated Ms. Esker for more than a year before becoming
engaged to Ms. Cihaski, also refused to comment.
   Ms. Esker, a junior at University of Wisconsin-River Falls,
strangled Ms. Cihaski with a belt after the two women met in a car
outside a Wausau motel where the victim worked, according to
testimony.
   She confessed to the murder but her lawyers claimed that she
killed Ms. Cihaski in self defense after the two women argued.

<TEXT>
   Harold Masursky, a pioneer space
scientist involved in the Mercury and Apollo programs and the
Viking experiments on Mars, died early Friday at his home. He was
66.
   Masursky had diabetes and his health had declined over the past
few years. A cause of death was not immediately released.
   Masursky retired in February after 43 years with the U.S.
Geological Survey. His death coincided with the first transmission
of images of Venus from the unmanned Magellan flight, a mission he
began advocating in the 1960s.
   Born in Fort Wayne, Ind., Masursky joined USGS in 1947 and
explored the western United States for fossil fuels. He transferred
to the astrogeology branch in 1962.
   In the early 1970s, he was one of a small group of U.S.
scientists who began a quiet exchange of space science information
with the Soviet Union.
   In 1976, Masursky helped select the landing site on Mars for the
Viking flight. He also helped set up Viking's experiments.
   Masursky was a member of 41 scientific groups and received four
awards of excellence from the geological survey. In 1988, he was
awarded the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum
Award for Achievement in Lunar and Planetary Exploration.
   He is survived by his wife, LesLee, four children, two
grandchildren and three sisters.

<HEAD>White House Condemns Saddam's TV Appearance With Britons</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: Inserts 2 grafs after 8th grasf, The spokesman, with Post
report on chances of standoff as great as those of war</NOTE>

   The White House on Friday condemned
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's TV appearance with Britons he
won't allow to leave Iraq as ``sick beyond expression.''
   Meanwhile, President Bush prepared to interrupt his vacation and
personally brief members of Congress on the Persian Gulf crisis.
   In Kuwait, Iraqi troops blocked off the U.S. Embassy that Saddam
has ordered closed, while in Baghdad more than 100 Americans who
had left compound on Thursday were kept from continuing their trip
and leaving Iraq.
   Though the embassy standoff was tense, there were indications
the president did not want military action there.
   ``Our purpose is not to create a confrontation or to create a
threat,'' Bush's press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater, said when asked
why it was decided to pull out the embassy's Marine guards in
Kuwait City while defying the Friday deadline to close the embassy.
   Fitzwater said Bush had watched a TV broadcast Thursday in which
Saddam told a group of British citizens that their presence helped
to prevent a U.S. military attack.
   The spokesman said Saddam's broadcast ``shows the cynical and
inhumane view that he holds for human life. To hold men, women and
children up for viewing as targets for destruction is sick beyond
expression.''
   The Washington Post reported in Saturday editions that U.S.
officials believe the situation along the Kuwait-Saudi Arabia
border has stabilized and that the likelihood of a prolonged
military and diplomatic standoff between the United States and Iraq
is at least as great as war.
   The newspaper, in a story from Kennebunkport that cited no
sources, said the possibility of a lengthy standoff has raised
concerns about how long economic and military pressure can can be
maintained against Iraq.
   Bush will fly to Washington on Tuesday afternoon to meet with
congressional leaders and members of key foreign policy committees.
   Although Congress is still in recess, ``several Congress members
indicated they would like to come back to Washington for a
face-to-face briefing,'' Fitzwater said.
   As for the embassy standoff, Fitzwater was asked what would be
the appropriate response by Ambassador Nathaniel Howell and his
staff if the Iraqis forced their way in.
   ``I can't get into specific instructions, but he is staying
there to help out as he can,'' Fitzwater said.
   ``Force has not been applied. Should he be subject to that, he
will have to act accordingly. But those are judgments that he is
authorized to make in many cases, and beyond that, I couldn't go
into specific discussions we have had with him.''
   Tensions also were high in Persian Gulf waters where U.S.
vessels trailed a number of Iraqi and other ships.
   The United States so far has declined to forcibly interdict any
ships for violation of the United Nations-endorsed trade embargo
against Iraq. But Fitzwater said ``we are monitoring all of them''
navigating in the region.
   Bush has said he was willing to give the United Nations a little
time to work out agreement on a resolution backing military
enforcement of the sanctions. But he also was prepared to go ahead
with military interdiction without that approval, officials have
indicated.
   Fitzwater expressed confidence the U.N. concurrence would come.
   He said Iraq continues to try to circumvent the U.N. sanctions.
Among its efforts, he said, are ``aviation shipments into Baghdad
of one kind or another, materiel that appears to be coming in
through some routes and also the procurement of chemical warfare
products, which we have great concern about.''
   The spokesman declined to give further details ``because we are
still working to resolve the matter and put an end to this.''
However, in answer to a question, he indicated the source of the
materiel was not the Soviet Union, long a major supplier of
armaments to Iraq.
   The vacationing president spent most of Friday morning with his
national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, taking him out on
Bush's speedboat to continue discussions of the Persian Gulf
developments, Fitzwater said.
   Turning to domestic issues, Bush also met Friday with Treasury
Secretary Nicholas Brady and budget director Richard Darman. They
were discussing new administration proposals on reducing the
national deficit.

   Scientists who successfully bonded
metal ions to an antibody say it's the first step toward creating
super-antidotes that could neutralize chemical weapons, drug
overdoses and most poisons.
   The metal ions act as catalysts that can convert poisons to
harmless substances inside the human body, said Stephen J.
Benkovic, a chemistry professor at Penn State.
   ``It could be used as a detoxifying agent for people who have
taken a drug overdose and can be used against environmental
pollutants,'' Benkovic said in an interview. When the U.S. military
learned of the early laboratory success, it asked for a briefing
about applications in chemical warfare, he said.
   The ``metalloantibodies'' can be made by altering the amino acid
sequence of protein to make it easier to bind with a metal, said
Sheila A. Iverson, working on the project at the Research Institute
of Scripps Clinic at La Jolla, Calif.

   A judge's rejection of provisions in
Pennsylvania's restrictive abortion law provides a chance for the
Supreme Court to review its 1973 decision in Roe vs. Wade that
legalized abortion, both sides in the case said.
   Senior U.S. District Judge Daniel H. Huyett on Friday struck
down provisions in the 1982 state law, saying much of it was just a
repeat of provisions previously ruled unconstitutional. The state
said it would appeal to the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and,
if necessary, to the Supreme Court.
   ``If the (Supreme) court is looking to overturn Roe v. Wade,
this case provides an opportunity to do that,'' said Linda Wharton
of the Women's Law Project, an attorney for the plaintiffs in the
case.
   ``Everything is happening the way we thought it would happen,''
said Republican Rep. Stephen Freind, the leading anti-abortion
voice in the Legislature. ``No doubt we are going to win in the
Supreme Court.''

   A sizzling abortion debate in both
East and West Germany threatens to hold up a treaty that would
merge the laws of the two states.
   The newly adopted Oct. 3 unity date is not endangered, but
failure of the treaty would leave a number of legal issues to be
settled by an all-German parliament. All-German elections are not
set until Dec. 2.
   The opposition Social Democrats have threatened to torpedo the
treaty following a government decision that West German women who
after unity try to take advantage of East Germany's permissive
abortion law can be prosecuted.
   The Social Democrats have insisted West German law should only
apply to West German turf.

   Operation PUSH says it will keep urging a
black boycott of Nike after a three-hour meeting with executives of
the sports shoe company produced no promise of a comprehensive
affirmative action program.
   The meeting Friday was ``congenial, amiable,'' PUSH founder
Jesse Jackson said afterward. But he said Nike executives showed no
willingness to yield to the black self-help group's demands for
more minority representation in the company.
   Nike officials and Georgetown University basketball coach John
Thompson, who has an endorsement contract with Nike, said progress
had been made in the talks. But they declined to predict how the
conflict will be resolved.
   ``Obviously, we're encouraged,'' said Nike President Richard K.

   Lawyers for four ``performance artists'' who
were denied federal grants say they will take the National
Endowment for the Arts to court for making what they call a
political decision that violates the First Amendment.
   The lawyers from the Center for Constitutional Rights said a
federal court case is the only option because the NEA on Friday
rejected an appeal of its decision in June to turn down the grant
applications.
   ``As in its initial denial letters, the NEA gives no substantive
reasons for the denials,'' the non-profit center said in a
statement from its New York headquarters.
   The four performers in question are Karen Finley and Holly
Hughes of New York, and Tim Miller and John Fleck of Los Angeles.
Their solo stage acts consist of songs and monologues on such
themes as sexual oppression, politics and racism. The acts
sometimes include explicit sexual content.

   Friday's mild updraft in the markets was little
relief to those nursing the wounds inflicted so far by the Persian
Gulf crisis.
   Since Iraq invaded Kuwait Aug. 2:
   _ Nearly half a trillion dollars has been stripped from the
value of U.S. stocks, roughly equaling the damage done on Black
Monday in 1987.
   _ Oil prices have leaped above $30 per barrel, pushing unleaded
gasoline prices up more than 15 cents per gallon at the pumps.
   _ Mortgage rates have moved back over 10 percent as yields on
Treasury securities have risen in the bond market.
   _ Gold has soared well above $400 per ounce.
   _ The dollar has tumbled against other major currencies in
foreign exchange, tarnishing its image as a safe haven in times of
world turmoil.
   The crisis has proved an unusually heavy burden for the markets
by striking at a time when recession worries already were eroding
confidence. The situation also recalled unhappy memories of the
sour investment climate that accompanied Mideast troubles in the
1970s.
   There was some good financial news on the military front,
however. A World War II-era statute makes reservists summoned to
active duty eligible for an interest-rate cut to 6 percent for a
wide range of debts incurred before being called up.

<HEAD>ECONOMY: The Bad News Keeps Coming</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The economic news from Washington continued to paint a bleak
picture. A report on the second-quarter gross national product
pegged growth at a paltry 1.2 percent. The report showed the
economy was weakening well before the Mideast crisis.
   The wealthiest fraction of America is still doing splendidly
well by the latest government measure. The Internal Revenue Service
said the richest 3.3 million people in the country held $4.3
trillion in 1986, exceeding the value of the GNP that year.
   An auto sales report from Detroit showed mid-August sales fell
4.7 percent. It was the first report since the Gulf erupted, but it
showed no rush yet to fuel-efficient cars.

   National Semiconductor and Data General Corp. both announced big

in the technology sector.
   Elsewhere, USAir said it was issuing pink slips to 1,500
probationary employees and canceling a planned expansion. The move
was blamed on the sobering outlook for the economy.
   Procter &amp; Gamble said it would drop a plan to market the popular

<HEAD>PEOPLE: Trump Gets A Second Roll</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   For Donald Trump, it was another humbling week. He found the
fate of his complex debt restructuring being decided by casino
regulators for the state of New Jersey, who put their stamp of
approval on a new loan from his banks.
   Trump himself was relegated to spectator status at several days'
worth of state hearings, where he was reduced to conducting
business by pay telephone during breaks in the proceedings.
   Adding insult to injury, Fortune magazine on Tuesday dumped the
ex-billionaire from its annual list of the world's richest people.
Trump, worth $1.7 billion by Fortune's estimates last year, now
could have a negative net worth according to the documents released
by New Jersey gambling regulators.
   Although mildly humiliating, the agreement reached with the
Casino Control Commission at least helped Trump avert disaster. The
bank deal gave him $65 million in new credit and put a moratorium
on some other pressing loan payments. Trump, in turn, promised to
make payments on bonds financing his casinos and live within a
strict budget. With fresh capital in hand, he took the Trump
Shuttle off the market for the time being.
   Also during the week, he peddled a new book, titled ``Surviving
at the Top.''

<TEXT>
   Author Dorothy Gilman gets letters from readers
who love her books about Mrs. Pollifax, who travels through exotic
places on missions for the CIA looking more like a grandmother on
holiday than a secret agent.
   She also gets letters from people who've discovered her five
non-Pollifax novels, saying how much they enjoy those. Few letter
writers like both.
   Gilman made her first author's tour this summer, promoting
``Mrs. Pollifax and the Whirling Dervish,'' published by Doubleday.
   She doesn't speak against her creation of 26 years ago, even
then an intrepid widow in her mid-60s. ``She supported me and my
two boys and put them through college.''
   But, she admits, Mrs. Pollifax does get a bit confining to
write. ``Now that I'm in my later years, I'm insisting on doing
more books I really want to do. But I always feel when I do a
non-Pollifax, someone is looking over my shoulder saying, `This is
nice but when are you going to do the next Mrs. Pollifax?' ''
   ``The Clairvoyant Countess'' is about a clairvoyant who helps
the police. ``A Nun in the Closet'' is her only funny book, about
two cloistered nuns who get embroiled in the outside world.
   ``Incident at Badamya'' was published last year. ``Its heroine
is 16. There are people up through their 60s,'' she said. ``It's
not a mystery. It's an adventure story. A lot of strangers are
captured together in Burma, telling their stories. It has some
mysticism in it. I've been told there's a little mysticism in all
my books.''
   Gilman's books are set in exotic locales, which she visits,
finding that more fun than pounding her manual typewriter. Before
Mrs. Pollifax met the Sufi dervish in her ninth CIA assignment,
Gilman toured in Morocco with a dozen people, two of whom spoke
English.
   ``For the first book, I was too poor to travel,'' Gilman says.
``I had her in Albania. I couldn't go to Turkey for the second but
for the third I went to Bulgaria. I've been to the country of all
the Mrs. Pollifaxes since _ Switzerland, Thailand, China.''
   She usually isn't in danger. ``I went to Kenya and Tanzania and
nothing happened. In Zambia, bombs were going off. There were
freedom fighters from what is now Zimbabwe. While I was there,
somebody was blown up. That trip was for `Mrs. Pollifax on Safari.'
''
   Gilman says, ``The books have to have something political.
America is supporting the Moroccan king in his fight to take over
the western Sahara from the Polisario. In 1975, the U.N. promised
the Polisario a plebiscite.
   ``It appalled me. There was my plot. I do have a bit of trouble
with plots _ so I lean on the political. The political part of the
book is still up to date. No vote has been taken.''
   There were more beggars in Morocco than Gilman has seen anywhere
else. ``It made me even angrier at the king and at our government
for supporting him. He is spending $1 million a day on this war.
   ``I didn't know about the war until I looked into Morocco. I
love the research on these books.''
   She finished ``Mrs. Pollifax and the Whirling Dervish'' last
summer, now is working on a non-Pollifax. ``For six years I've been
collecting material on the Sahara Desert and tribes. I haunt
second-hand bookstores. When I find something, it's a big event.
Now I'm finally putting it to work.''
   Many writers start with a protagonist similar to themselves. But
only now is Gilman catching up to Mrs. Pollifax in age. ``I think I
was hiding behind her,'' the New Brunswick, N.J., native says. ``I
was a minister's daughter. The church had so many eccentric,
wonderful elderly ladies. It just seemed natural that Mrs. Pollifax
would be a little quirky like them. She gave me a good cover.
   ``I had a need for escape in that horrible year (1964) when I
had to leave my husband. I had a lot of trouble doing that,
actually.
   ``I was caught in a very confined marriage, getting very
depressed. You weren't supposed to leave husbands. This was my
escape. She traveled, which I had always wanted to do. I think
growing up I wanted to be a spy or a deep sea diver and write about
those things.''
   Gilman had gone to art school in Philadelphia, and was married
to a seventh grade teacher. ``The Unexpected Mrs. Pollifax'' was
published in 1966.
   ``Then I wrote `Uncertain Voyage.' It was psychological
suspense, about a woman recovering from a nervous breakdown and
testing herself by a trip to Europe. She has to find herself. There
was some intrigue. Somebody said it was pre-women's lib,'' she said.
   ``I never thought Mrs. Pollifax would be a series. Then they
wanted another one.'' It isn't surprising, since the day ``The
Unexpected Mrs. Pollifax'' was published Gilman received a phone
call that Rosalind Russell wanted to star in a movie of it. She
departed from the book and wore designer clothes in the 1970 ``Mrs.
Pollifax _ Spy.'' It wasn't a hit.
   Gilman had previously written a dozen young adult books. ``My
income from those had risen to $5,000. Here I was with three of us
to support.'' She calls the movie sale ``kind of a neat rescue.''
   The author, whose sons and infant grandchild live in New York,
rents a condo in Portland, Maine.

   Stock prices rose today in what analysts
described as a technical rebound from the market's free-fall slide
of the past several weeks.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 173.02 points over
the past three sessions, recovered 30.94 to 2,514.36 by 3 p.m. on
Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 8 to 7 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 821 up, 720 down and
444 unchanged.
   Analysts said buyers were encouraged by hopes that the markets
had gone too far in their appraisal of the potential calamities
resulting from the showdown in the Middle East.
   But by near-unanimous agreement the mood in the marketplace
remained cautious and touchy.
   It will take months, economists observe, to gauge the effects on
business aactivity of the upsurge in oil prices and interest rates
that followed Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   Even without that disruptive influence, the domestic economy was
widely believed to have been verging on a recession as it began the
second half of 1990.
   Among actively traded blue chips, General Electric rose 1&lsqb; to
59|; International Business Machines 1&rsqb; to 98\; Boeing 2} to 45\,
and American Telephone &amp; Telegraph } to 31\.
   Federal National Mortgage gained 1} to 28&rsqb;. The stock traded as
low as 24~ Thursday before the company announced that it had
earmarked as much as $500 million for buybacks of its common shares
and warrants.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
1.07 to 169.95. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down 1.14 at 314.71.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 169.08 million shares with an

<HEAD>Investors, Faced With Crisis, Look To Bottom Line</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Whatever the outcome of the showdown in the
Persian Gulf, Wall Streeters believe the stock market now is
reconciling itself to the prospect of a long dry spell for
corporate profits.
   As the summer began, hopes had been spreading among U.S.
investors that earnings would soon start pulling out of a slump
that set in at mid-1989.
   Even in a relatively weak economic environment, the reasoning
went, bottom lines at many businesses stood to benefit from moves
by the Federal Reserve toward a more stimulative credit policy.
   Such visions faded fast, however, with the Aug. 2 strike on
Kuwait by Iraq under President Saddaam Hussein, and the resulting
upsurge in oil prices and interest rates.
   ``The economy looks bad,'' said Suresh Bhirud, chief portfolio
strategist at the investment firm of Oppenheimer &amp; Co.
   ``What Saddam has done,'' summarized Barton Biggs at Morgan
Stanley &amp; Co., ``is boost oil prices, diminish economic growth,
raise inflation and increase budget deficits (particularly in the
U.S.) at a time when economic engines were beginning to sputter
anyway.''
   At Wright Investors' Service, a Bridgeport, Conn., investment
management firm, analysts have pushed back their projections of any
pickup in profits to the second half of 1991.
   They add, ``this reduced estimate may still prove to be too
optimistic if the U.S. economy does indeed enter a recession.
   ``Over the next few quarters, stock prices will get little
support from the overall corporate profit performance.''
   Some favorable resolution of the Middle East crisis, it is
widely presumed, would logically cause oil prices to drop back
significantly from the recent peaks they have reached of $30-plus
per barrel.
   But even then energy costs are expected to settle at a point
higher than they would have been otherwise, increasing many
companies' operating costs and hurting businesses that depend on
car travel and on consumers' disposable income.
   The increase in interest rates looms as another negative in the
cost of doing business. Not so incidentally, it enhances the
comparative allure of interest-bearing investments that compete
with stocks for investors' favor.
   As the stock market struggled to cope with such unsettling
thoughts, it took a steep drop in the past week to its lowest
levels in more than a year.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials closed Friday at
2,532.92, down 111.88 from the week before.
   The New York Stock Exchange composite index fell 10.04 to
171.05; the NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
dropped 26.16 to 367.33, and the American Stock Exchange market
value index was down 17.32 at 316.29.
   Volume on the Big Board averaged 189.86 million shares a day,
against 147.95 million the week before.
   Late in the week, a flurry of stories crossed financial news
wires carrying word of companies budgeting money to buy back shares
of their stocks.
   That was reminiscent of the aftermath of the 1987 market crash,
when buyback plans sprang up by the hundreds.
   In one of the most notable early instances this time, Federal
National Mortgage Association announced that it had earmarked as
much as $500 million for purchases of its common shares and
warrants.
   Buybacks, by themselves, are far from any assurance that the
worst of a market decline is over. But they provided one sign that
stock prices had at last fallen far enough from their July peaks to
attract a few venturesome buyers operating from a long-term point
of view.

<HEAD>Corn Prices Remain Low Despite Tight Stocks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL A. DRISCOLL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   While the Middle East crisis holds profound implications for the
economy, grain and soybean prices seem to have been little moved by
the Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   It's not that what's going on in the Persian Gulf and other
financial markets is unimportant to farm commodities. Rather, the
crisis is sending a mixed message.
   ``They're getting inflation and recession signals at the same
time,'' said Walter Spilka, an analyst with Smith Barney, Harris
Upham &amp; Co.
   The higher oil and precious metals prices are inflationary and
should be pulling grain prices higher.
   ``But if we do have a recession, people will be going out to
dinner less and switching more to chicken,'' Spilka said. ``The
things that use up corn the most are steaks and hamburgers.''
   The worldwide supply of corn and other grains contains other
puzzling elements. In the United States, corn supplies are tight.
   ``In lots of areas, there just isn't any,'' said analyst William
Biedermann, research director of Allendale Inc., a futures
brokerage in Crystal Lake, Ill. ``In other areas there is some
corn, but farmers just aren't selling.
   ``For the last three years, we've been consuming more than we're
producing,'' he said.
   The result, Biedermann said, is that for the first time in the
nation's history, corn stocks have dropped four years in a row.
   The supply of corn on hand at the end of this marketing year is
expected to be 1.33 billion bushels. By September 1991, corn
supplies are expected to be down to 1.2 billion.
   Yet, the price of corn, $2.57} on the Chicago Board of Trade
Friday, is low. ``I'd say it costs more than $2.40 to grow it
now,'' Spilka said.
   The tight corn supplies happen to coincide with a little more
wheat in the nation's storage bins than a year ago and with better
than average crops being reported in much of the Northern
Hemisphere this season.
   With the price of wheat not much above that of corn, livestock
growers will be feeding a lot more wheat than normal, which
depresses the price of corn. Overseas sales aren't likely to help
much either.
   ``We have to export this stuff,'' Spilka said, ``but there are
better crops this year in the Soviet Union and a big wheat crop in
China.''
   The fact that grain prices remain depressed seems to be an
indication that the trade believes there is going to be plenty for
what demand develops.
   ``The ending stocks we're seeing now is not the final number,''
Spilka said. ``The market probably is saying that the stocks are
not going to be this tight.''
   ``If the country was booming, the stock market going up, gas
prices OK, then there would be an explosive potential on the up
side,'' he said.
   But under present conditions, he said, there's no anticipation
of renewed demand.

<HEAD>Ford Keeping Dearborn Assembly Plant Shut for Two More Weeks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co. said Friday an engine
parts shortage will force it to extend a two-week shutdown of its
Dearborn assembly plant for another two weeks.
   Originally, the factory that makes Mustang automobiles was
closed for a week because of a shortage of dealer orders. The
shutdown this week was blamed on the parts shortage.
   On Friday, Ford said the parts shortage for the 2.3-liter
standard engine continues and would force the plant to remain
closed until Sept. 10.
   The plant employs about 2,100 hourly workers, most of whom will
be on temporary layoff. Others will be used from time to time to
maintain machinery in the factory.

   United Airlines will increase its
air freight rates 5.3 percent on all domestic flights effective
Oct. 1 to cover rising jet fuel costs, the airline announced Friday.
   United was also considering a similar fuel surcharge for
international freight shipments, according to a prepared statement
released by the suburban Chicago-based airline.
   ``This modest charge is necessary to offset escalating fuel
costs. (Those) costs are being closely monitored, and should prices
decline, the fuel surcharge will be removed,'' said Carl Norris,
United's director of cargo.
   The company will impose a 5.3 percent fuel surcharge on
passenger flights beginning at the end of August, said company
spokesman Rob Doughty.

<NOTE>Eds: ADDS three grafs with Weyerhaeuser comment after 5th graf

<TEXT>
   A financial adviser afraid to face his
clients admitted in a videotape message that he lost about $100
million of investors' money by making risky trades in stock options.
   More than 1,000 investors may be affected, according to lawyers.
Included are several large retirement funds.
   ``Words aren't adequate to express my regret and sorrow,'' said
Jim Donahue, head of the Hedged Securities Associates limited
partnership, based in the Denver suburb of Englewood. ``I feel
terrible remorse for the things I've done to you.''
   H. Alan Dill, attorney for the partnership, said the
organization has about $5.25 million in assets remaining and will
seek bankruptcy protection to sort out investor claims.
   He said the biggest loser was the retirement fund of
Weyerhaeuser Co., of Tacoma, Wash., which lost about $30 million.
   In a statement, Weyerhaeuser said, ``Only a small percentage of
our total pension funds was invested there, and our pension funding
continues to be very sound.''
   The company said aggregate assets of its pension funds exceeded
$850 million at the end of 1989.
   ``The facts in this situation are still unclear and since a
legal evaluation is under way, we cannot comment further,'' the
wood products company said.
   Donahue sent a videotape to an investor meeting Thursday instead
of appearing personally because he feared for his safety, according
to aides.
   While the 18-minute message was played to an overflow crowd,
security guards walked through the audience.
   Donahue, 62, was known as an aggressive trader in stock options,
contracts to buy or sell a stock for a specified price in the
future.
   During the past 11 years, he claimed annual returns of 20
percent or better by hedging his bets in the options market.
   Donahue ran into trouble when he bet on an upturn in the shares
of United Airlines' parent company, UAL Corp.
   The stock turned down after an employee group failed to line up
financing to buy the company, and on Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   ``The loss is extensive, and involves most of the total assets
of the fund,'' he said. ``My words cannot possibly alleviate the
emotional or financial impact on each person involved.''

<HEAD>Sun Microsystems Withdraws Plan to Offer Common Stock</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Deteriorating market conditions
resulting from the Middle East crisis prompted Sun Microsystems
Inc. to withdraw its planned offering of common shares on Friday.
   The worldwide supplier of general purpose computing systems had
announced Aug. 13 that it would sell 5.9 million shares of common
stock and 1.1 million shares offered by various stockholders.
   ``Financial market conditions clearly have deteriorated since we
announced this offering,'' said Scott McNealy, president and chief
executive officer of Sun Microsystems.
   ``We do not believe it is in the best interest of our
stockholders to sell additional shares under current market
conditions,'' McNealy said.
   Sun shares closed at $27.62{ Friday on the New York Stock
Exchange, up $1.25. The stock had been trading as high as $36.62{
on July 13.
   Sun Microsystems earlier this month reported $111.2 million in
profits during the 1990 fiscal year, an 83 percent jump over the
previous year. Revenues for fiscal 1990, which ended June 30, were
$2.47 billion, a 40 percent increase over $1.77 billion reported a
year earlier.

   A former Chicago Mercantile Exchange trader
pleaded guilty Friday to charges of fraud and violating commodities
exchange regulations, a government prosecutor said.
   Aric March, one of 21 yen traders indicted in an FBI
investigation into corruption charges at the Merc, pleaded guilty
to one charge of mail fraud and one charge of violating the
Commodities Exchange Act, Assistant U.S. Attorney Dan Gillogly said.
   March has also agreed to cooperate with federal prosecution
efforts, Gillogly said.
   Fifteen other yen traders are scheduled to go on trial beginning
Sept. 5.
   Earlier this year, another yen trader, Gary Wright, was indicted
and charged with trying to persuade March not to cooperate with the
government.

<TEXT>
   USAir Inc. said Friday it will eliminate
2,100 more positions during the next four months, bringing to 3,600
the total number of layoffs announced this week.
   The layoffs were ordered to cut operating costs before 1991,
when the rate of business growth is expected to decline, USAir
spokesman Mike Clark said.
   ``We expect softening passenger demand, poor economic conditions
generally, escalating fuel costs,'' Clark said.
   USAir currently has about 54,000 employees. Workers to be laid
off include 500 managers, 211 pilots, 650 flight attendants and
2,100 reservation clerks and other fleet service employees.
   The carrier previously forecast 6 percent growth for next year,
but recently completed reviews have reduced that number to 2
percent.
   ``So what we have is people who were hired pretty much in
anticipation of a continuing growth rate that has been scaled back,
and we just simply do not need that many people,'' Clark said.
   Company officials do not know whether any more layoffs will be
ordered before the end of the year, he said.
