   The United States has done nothing about an
Iraqi instruction to close the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait, the State
Department said Friday night.
   Iraq told all embassies in Kuwait, which Iraq claims to have
annexed, that ``all embassies should move to Baghdad by the 24th,''
said an official who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``So far no action has been taken,'' this official said. ``I
don't know what will be done.''
   The European Common Market said in a statement in Brussels
earlier in the day that it considers the annexation null and void,
and, ``The same applies to the announced removal of diplomatic
missions from Kuwait,'' according to an account in Saturday
editions of The Washington Post.

   National Guard members from at least 15 states, many of them
described as volunteers, are joining or supporting the movement of
U.S. forces to Saudi Arabia, governors and guard officials said
Thursday.
   Their destinations and exact jobs were not revealed, but they
included air transport and aerial refueling units, communications
specialists, and medics.
   The number of people involved ranged from five from South
Carolina to 500 from Kansas, but most of the states did not
disclose numbers.
   Contingents were drawn from Army and Air guard units in Arizona,
New York, New Jersey, Kansas, Rhode Island, Delaware, Tennessee,
West Virginia, Illinois, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas,
Utah, Washington state, Ohio and New Hampshire.
   Although most of those going on active duty were described as
volunteers, the South Carolina Guard's spokesman, Lt. Les Carroll,
said that by just being in the guard, an all-volunteer service, his
state's five men placed on active duty volunteered to participate.
He said he wasn't sure if they actually raised their hands to be
sent, but should be considered volunteers.
   A contingent of the 105th Military Airlift Group of the New York
National Guard volunteered to support the movement of troops to the
Middle East, Gov. Mario Cuomo announced late Wednesday.
   7 The 105th, based at Stewart International Airport in Newburgh,
has 12 C5-A Galaxy jet transports. It is the only Air National
Guard unit that has the huge aircraft, which can carry 290,000
pounds of cargo. It flew 48 missions during the U.S. intervention
in Panama, transporting almost 2.3 million pounds of cargo and more
than 750 soldiers.
   A second New York contingent of 40 nurses and medical
technicians from the 139th Aero Medical Evacuation Flight based at
the Schenectady County Airport was approved Thursday by Cuomo. Part
of the 109th Tactical Airlift Group, they would provide air
evacuation of casualties in a combat situation, said Guard
spokesman Lt. Col. P.C. Kutschera.
   Seventy-four West Virginia Air National Guardsmen were
mobilized, Adjutant Gen. Joseph Skaff said.
   The Pentagon called the West Virginia National Guard on
Wednesday night seeking volunteers, Skaff said. ``Within two hours,
we got all the volunteers we needed, which made us very proud of
our people,'' he said.
   The West Virginia volunteers include medics, nurses, medical
technicians and cargo specialists.
   Twenty-one members of the 156th Aeromedical Evacuation Flight of
the North Carolina Air National Guard volunteered, Gov. Jim Martin
announced Thursday.
   ``This unit is made up of personnel that run the gamut from
nurses and physician's assistants to doctors,'' said National Guard
spokesman Lt. Col. Baron G. Hignite.
   New Jersey Gov. Jim Florio said aircraft and volunteers from the
Air National Guard's 170th Air Refueling Group at McGuire Air Force
Base were called into service. He said he had no details.
   Kansas Gov. Mike Hayden agreed to active duty for 500 members of
the 190th Air Refueling Group, which is stationed at Forbes Field
just south of Topeka.
   The 500 will go on active duty on a voluntary basis, said Joy
Moser, spokesman for the Kansas National Guard. ``It is not
mandatory,'' she said.
   About 100 members of three Tennessee Air National Guard units
were mobilized and some were deployed beginning three days ago,
said Adjutant Gen. Carl Wallace. The units are the 134th Air
Refueling Group, the 228th Combat Communications Squadron, and the
118th Aero Medical Evacuation Squadron, which functions as a
``flying hospital,'' Wallace said.
   ``We all know about Tennessee volunteers,'' said Wallace. ``They
went to Texas and all that. This time we'll be more successful than
at the Alamo.''
   Major Gen. Harold G. Holesinger, adjutant general of Illinois,
said 108 members of the 126th Air Refueling Wing volunteered.
   South Carolina Gov. Carroll Campbell released five members of
the 228th Signal Brigade to go on active duty.
   Thirty-four members of the Ohio Air National Guard will take
part as volunteers, Gov. Richard Celeste said Thursday. He said
that included 14 from the 160th Air Refueling Group at Rickenbacker
Air National Guard Base, and 20 from the 179th Tactical Air Lift
Group at Mansfield.
   Washington Gov. Booth Gardner said National Guard volunteers
would go on active duty. But he would not identify the units or
give other details.
   Utah Gov. Norm Bangerter said 25 members of the Utah Guard's
151st Air Refueling Group and three members of the 169th Electronic
Security Squadron volunteered.
   Texas Gov. Bill Clements said he approved a Pentagon request for
11 volunteers from the 136th Tactical Airlift Wing, based at
Hensley Field in Grand Prairie.
   An undisclosed number of members of the Arizona National Guard
were allowed to volunteer, Gov. Rose Mofford said. Press secretary
Vada Manager said they included members of the 161st Refueling
Group.
   Delaware Gov. Michael Castle approved the participation of 60
Delaware National Guard members.
   Sgt. Frank Donkin, a maintenance worker at Dover Air Force Base,
left Tuesday, said his wife, Chris. He was told to bring his gear
and gas mask, she said.
   In Rhode Island, three members of the 143rd Tactical Airlift
Group based in North Kingston volunteered, the governor's chief of
staff said.
   New Hampshire Gov. Judd Gregg said he approved a Defense
Department request for 40 members of the guard's 157th Air
Refueling Group. Lt. Col. Joseph Riley, a guard spokesman, said
tanker jets from Pease Air Force Base, N.H., were meeting and
refueling planes en route to the Middle East.

   Anger and frustration still simmer in Watts,
25 years after a week of rioting reduced entire blocks to charred
ruins and seared black rage onto the American conscience.
   But Watts today is not the powder keg it was when the streets of
Los Angeles exploded on Aug. 11, 1965, and burned for six nights
and days, according to residents, community activists and academics.
   Some people say such post-riot developments as a new shopping
center and a health clinic have improved the community. Others
contend that negative forces are responsible for keeping the lid on
any more riots.
   In recent years, gangs and drugs have joined the longtime
problems of crime, joblessness and despair, making the area both
violent and stagnant. Watts today directs its rage at itself,
rather than at society, reducing the risk of another riot but doing
nothing to solve the community's woes.
   ``Drugs are a deterrent, a lazy deterrent,'' said Ted Watkins
Jr., president of Watts Labor Community Action Committee, a leader
in the effort to rebuild the area. ``I don't think that in 1990 the
will is here'' for another riot.
   Watts became a symbol of inner-city anger, sparked by an event
that didn't even happen inside the community of 30,500 people eight
miles due south of downtown Los Angeles.
   Four blocks west of Watts, two white California Highway Patrol
officers stopped a 21-year-old black motorist for investigation of
erratic driving.
   A scuffle started between the patrolmen and the motorist. A
crowd gathered and quickly grew angry. Rocks were thrown. More
police arrived. The crowd swelled.
   In about an hour, the disturbance spread to surrounding
communities, including Watts. Rioters torched buildings, looted
stores and pulled white drivers from their cars and beat them.
Snipers took to the rooftops.
   A 50-square-mile area became a combat zone. National Guard jeeps
with machine guns patrolled the streets.
   When it was all over, 34 people were dead, 4,000 others
arrested, and damage was estimated at $40 million. A stretch of
103rd Street was lined by burnt-out skeletons of buildings, giving
it the name Charcoal Alley.
   The McCone Commission, named after Chairman John A. McCone,
former head of the CIA, issued a 101-page report, finding that the
cycle of poverty and despair gripping the area set the stage for
the riot.
   The report recommended a series of ambitious reforms, from job
training to efficient public transportation.
   Many community activists and politicians say some important
reforms went into place and made Watts a better community.
   Charcoal Alley has become a pleasant street with a post office,
city council field office, shopping center with a bank and
supermarket and a station on the city's new Blue Line light rail
system.
   Relations with the Police Department are the best ever, many
say, thanks in part to increased minority recruitment, community
outreach and the common enemies of drugs and gangs.
   Ola Mae Toler, a Watts resident since 1947, said Watts has
improved to the point a riot could not happen today.
   ``I don't think people are thinking of that anymore,'' she said.
``There's a lot of people who want progress. I know I do. But I
have never thought that Watts was the worst place to live.''
   Others say many of the reforms recommended in the McCone report
never materialized, got lost in the shuffle or were scaled down.
The Lockheed aeronautics plant near the Watts-Willowbrook border,
built in response to the riots, was closed in 1988, putting
thousands of people out of work.
   The Martin Luther King Jr.-Drew Medical Center, built south of
Watts to provide more accessible health care, has been battered by
allegations of administrative negligence and inadequate services.
   The schools have a serious dropout problem. The failure rate was
35 percent at D.S. Jordan High School in Watts in the 1988-89
school year and nearly 36 percent at Locke High School, just west
of Watts, according to the Los Angeles Unified School District.
   Estimates of unemployment run as high as 40 percent. The county
Department of Public Social Services says more than half of Watts'
residents receive some sort of public assistance, most of them
children.
   Crime is rampant in Watts and surrounding communities, with
homicides about one every four days in the Police Department's
Southeast Division, about a third of which is Watts. Ninety-four
murders were committed in the division last year. In the first half
of this year, 49 homicides were reported.
   ``The ground gained in `65 for the most part has been lost,''
said Tommy Jacquette, a Watts resident and head of the Watts Summer
Festival, a local arts celebration. ``Health programs and human
services programs have been cut out by local government.
Organizations designed for self-help are gone. Then there's the
onslaught of drugs and gang activities.''
   UCLA professor James Johnson, director of the UCLA Center for
the Study of Urban Poverty, describes Watts as a community at war
with itself, with Watts residents killing Watts residents.
   ``I personally don't think we'll have another Watts rebellion of
'65,'' he said. ``I think today it takes place on a daily basis.''

<DATELINE>MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The woman was probably in her 20s but
she had the look of those who have lost all hope. At first glance,
she appeared at least 50 years old.
   She sat in the tropical rain on the curb of Sekou Toure Avenue
with a days-old baby cradled in her lap. The baby was crying in the
darkness. No one else was to be seen.
   It was after curfew, and she risked being shot by President
Samuel Doe's soldiers.
   Passers-by stopped to offer her dollars and to advise her to get
her baby out of harm's way. She refused the money. ``I want food,''
she said, ``I can't buy food with that.''
   She was told if she walked into territory held by rebel chief
Prince Johnson, she might get some Red Cross rice. There had been a
distribution of rice that morning in the part of Monrovia.
   The woman shook her head. ``I couldn't make it,'' she said.
``I'm too weak to carry the baby.''
   It was a statement of fact, not a cry for help.
   Liberia's civil war trudges on in its heartless manner. Civilian
lives matter little in the immediate battle for a street crossing
or a gas station, and reports from rebel-held territory indicate
people there face the same dangers.
   In the morning, the woman had gone.
   Was she taken in by people living nearby, or killed by the
troops, or had she just wandered down the deserted, rubble-strewn
street in search of ... what?
   Even news of an impending intervention by a force of troops from
several West African nations couldn't lift the gloom.
   ``I don't believe anyone can help us in the mess we've made of
our country,'' said Elwyn Jackson, a gas station attendant until
the war closed his station and government troops killed his boss.
   Monrovia has no first aid stations, no facilities for the poor,
no one to whom to turn for help. Not even ambulances or fire
brigades are functioning.
   Fires started in the fighting blazed out of control, sometimes
all night. When the rain comes, every day or so, the flames go out
by themselves in a sizzle of hell.
   Stray dogs _ abandoned, lost _ wander through the streets. Their
bones show through their backs, and they have the strange slow
movements of those too starved to care.
   The rotting, bloated corpses of the human victims are seen
everywhere, in strange postures in gutters, on sidewalks, along the
beach or in the uncut weeds on empty plots of land.
   There's no one to remove the bodies, and no one is worrying
about dying later from some disease spread by the corpses.
   Feet, hands, and faces of the corpses are often missing. The
bodies are being attacked under cover of darkness by rats to the
stray dogs.
   Acnid Farnat is a diminutative Lebanese who used to run the
Arabic School on the seafront. He still lives there, but his
students have long since gone.
   He came to the nearby British Embassy pleading for special help.
The odor from a human body that had washed up in front of his house
was making his family sick. He wanted help to move the body.
   Neither the British nor anyone else was willing to assist him.
The body remained where it was until it disappeared a few days
later in the waves.
   The downtown streets are empty. Cars without wheels or with
their windows shot out are parked everywhere, long past anyone's
capacity to get them moving again.
   The steel shutters of supermarkets, most of them owned by
Lebanese or Indians who have long gone, have been blown apart by
rifle bullets, their contents looted.
   The crackling of machine-gun fire whipping across the long,
straight streets has become part of daily life.
   Every morning, the remaining downtown inhabitants slink out of
their homes in search for food and water. Long lines of civilians
can be seen making their way across the old bridge over the
Mezurado River, toward a haphazard rice distribution set up by
Johnson.
   On Benson Street, there is a solitary figure in a red T-shirt,
crouched on the sidewalk, eating garbage.
   He ignores the roadblock set up by Johnson's ``freedom
fighters'' across the street, and they ignore him.
   ``He's crazy,'' said the sergeant in charge.
   ``Even if everyone in this town gets killed, he'll still be
there.''

   The deployment of U.S. troops to protect
Saudi Arabia prompted an outburst of anti-American sentiment in the
Arab world, ranging from demonstrations to calls for a holy war
against the United States.
   The U.S. troops were dispatched to protect Saudi Arabia in the
wake of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait one week ago. Although the move
came in response to a Saudi appeal for protection, it fanned
resentment among Arabs who consider it unwarranted interference.
   Arab nations have so far refused to participate in any
multinational military effort against Iraq and have concentrated on
diplomatic efforts _ so far unsuccessful _ to peacefully resolve
the crisis.
   Even before the deployment of U.S. troops, there was strong
anti-American feeling in much of the Arab world because of the
United States' close ties with Israel. But the deployment brought
an upsurge in such sentiment.
   The head Moslem clerics, or mufti, attached to the military wing
of the Palestine Liberation Organization declared that if the
United States attacked Iraq, holy war ``is a duty for all Moslems.''
   The Amman-based mufti, Sheik Nader Assad Bayoud al-Tamini, said
in a statement clearly aimed at the Saudi royal family that ``those
who ally themselves with the enemies of God, the Americans and the
Westerners, and participate in the killing of Iraqis, are
considered apostates, and their blood should be shed.''
   In Jordan, where King Hussein said he continues to recognize the
deposed Kuwaiti government, the powerful professional Engineers
Association called on all Arab governments to form ``popular
armies'' to confront the danger posed by the ``attempt of America
to impose its will.''
   ``We call on all Arabs to awaken from their slumber after seeing
for themselves that imperialist countries stand together against
the Arab nation and its interests,'' the group said in a statement.
   A group calling itself the Jordanian Committee for the Defense
of Kuwait urged volunteers to go to Iraq to help President Saddam
Hussein, who has annexed Kuwait, resist any U.S. attack.
   Mohammed Rashdan, a Jordanian lawyer who is the secretary of the
committee, said the number of volunteers swelled following the
arrival of the first U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia. He said he
expected the number would grow to more than 10,000 by the end of
the day.
   The United States and Saudi Arabia have said the American forces
will act only defensively.
   Libyan radio announced during the day that thousands of Libyans
were ready to go to the region to fight against U.S. interference
in Arab affairs.
   In the Yemeni capital of San`a, about 1,000 people gathered in
front of the U.S. Embassy and chanted slogans denouncing the U.S.
intervention. But Yemen, the only Arab member of the U.N. Security
Council, joined in the unanimous vote Thursday declaring the Iraqi
annexation of Kuwait ``null and void.''
   The official Egyptian Middle East News Agency reported an
anti-American demonstration was staged outside the U.S. Embassy in
the Sudanese capital, Khartoum.
   Critics claim the United States has no reason to intervene to
protect Saudi Arabia because it has not moved to end the Israeli
occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which Israel seized in
1967.
   Faisal Husseini, the leading pro-PLO activist in the occupied
lands, accused Washington of using a ``double standard'' with the
Arabs. ``Why ask only Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait?'' he said.
``Why not ask Israel to withdraw from the West Bank?''

   Iraqis rushed to stock up on rice, sugar,
cooking oil and other foodstuffs after economic sanctions were
announced, fearing shortages in a country that imports $2 billion
worth of food a year.
   After Iraq invaded Kuwait, attention was focused on the world
embargo on Iraq's oil exports. The food cutoff could impose even
greater suffering on Iraq.
   Because the world embargo applies to Kuwait, too, the residents
of the Iraqi-annexed emirate are likely to feel the food pinch just
as much. Kuwait imports effectively all of its food.
   Foreigners who fled Kuwait after the invasion reported immediate
shortages as residents rushed to supermarkets and prepared for
siege-like conditions.
   London's Financial Times on Thursday quoted a source inside
Kuwait, whom it did not identify, as saying in notes shipped to the
newspaper: ``Tuesday morning some residents queuing at banks and
food shops, but no sign of them opening.''
   Iraq imports about 70 percent of its food, according to Omar
Kader, a Middle East expert and board member of the Arab-American
Affairs Council. Food accounts for a quarter of all Iraqi imports,
and one-third of the food brought in comes from the United States.
It consists mainly of wheat, corn, rice, barley, sugar, poultry and
eggs at subsidized prices.
   Washington has also provided agricultural credits to the Arab
country.
   Even before the invasion, the Senate voted July 27 to halt $1
billion in agricultural credit guarantees, citing in part Iraq's
recent threat to use chemical weapons against Israel.
   That measure required presidential approval but became moot
after the post-invasion sanctions cut off all credit.
   Omar Kader, a Middle East expert and board member of the
Arab-American Affairs Council, said on ``Good Morning America''
that a food cutoff would have almost immediate impact.
   The Iraqi people are accustomed to shortages.
   During the 1980-88 war with Iran, many foodstuffs were rationed,
including rice, sugar and cooking oil. People stood in lines
stretching around city blocks to purchase small quantities at
government stores.
   Local Turkish and Iraqi officials have been trying to figure out
what to do about thousands of trucks blocked on both sides of the
border since Turkey decided to cut off trade with Iraq.
   Turkey is both a supplier of food to Iraq and a crucial overland
route for imports from Europe and other points.
   A major route for Iraqi food imports during the Iran-Iraq war
was the truck route from the port of Aqaba in Jordan, a country
where feelings in support of Iraq run strong in some quarters.
   But businessmen in Jordan said ships carrying food or other
products have not unloaded at Aqaba since the U.N. Security Council
voted Monday for global sanctions against Iraq.
   Another possible route for food imports, the long Iran-Iraq
border, has been shut to trade since the 1980 outbreak of the
Iran-Iraq war. It is now patrolled by U.N. cease-fire monitors,
with no trade allowed across it.
   Marking an exception to the world blockade, Sri Lanka said it
would continue selling tea _ a major staple in every Arab country _
to Iraq despite the embargo.
   ``We are a poor country and must continue to pick and sell our
tea,'' said Deputy Defense Minister Ranjaan Wijeratne. ``Sanctions
can be imposed by rich countries. We cannot afford to stop selling
our products.''
   Iraq is Sri Lanka's second-largest customer after Egypt, having
bought 24 percent of last year's tea exports.

   The world's longest staircase has
six times as many steps as the Empire State Building and is nearly
twice as long as its nearest rival in China. But it is virtually
unknown, even in Switzerland.
   In a bid to end its obscurity, local enthusiasts this week
staged the first official race up the 11,674 steps of Mount Niesen,
in the Swiss Alps.
   Organizers say the ``Niesentreppen'' run will be an annual
event, attracting the world's top racers in a test of stamina and
skill up a hodgepodge of concrete, wooden and metal steps.
   For the rest of the year, the steps give maintenance workers
access to a cable railway and are off limits to others. The
80-year-old railway runs from this Bernese Oberland village up the
7,794 feet mountain.
   The lineup at Wednesday's race included a sports professor, a
diving instructor, a ski-tour organizer and a shop assistant. They
were among 20 people, all men, competing for the $7,692 prize.
   Swiss medical student Christian Aebersold averaged 223 steps a
minute to complete the dizzying course in 52 minutes, 26 seconds.
Jairo Correa of Colombia clocked 53.11 minutes. Correa is the world
champion of mountain racers, whose sport involves running up
mountains.
   U.S. runner Jay Johnson said one of the reasons he entered the
race was because it was different from the usual courses in the
mountain-racing circuit.
   The narrow steps, through tunnels and over bridges spanning
great drops, extend for only 2.1 miles but scale 5,344 feet from
valley to summit.
   After finishing sixth in 56.42 minutes, Johnson, the 1988
mountain-racing champion, declared the race great fun.
   ``But I had problems with the open metal steps toward the top as
when I looked at the drop below I felt dizzy,'' he said.
   One of the few competitors who had raced on steps before was
Villa Frades from Colombia. He scaled the 6,600 steps at the
Chinese temple of Tai Chun.
   Mike Ballmann, a former stuntman who helped organized the race,
said his goal was to put the Niesentreppen on the map.
   ``It is a great pity that we have the world's longest steps here
in Switzerland, but they are mostly unknown,'' he said.
   Ballmann said he first hit on the idea of organizing a race when
he scaled the steps in 1979 while training for a race in Nepal.
   He then persuaded fellow mountain enthusiast and Swiss
mathematic professor Jacques Berlie to take up the challenge.
Berlie's time last year of one hour and three minutes, in a run
televised worldwide, set the standard for this year.
   Fabiola Rueda, a two-time women's world mountain-racing
champion, also ran up Mount Niesen on Wednesday but was not
competing.
   Ms. Rueda, a Colombian national married to her Swiss trainer,
clocked 1:05.50 to set the target for women racers next year.
   Ballmann said he hoped four to five women would participate next
year. But the overall number of competitors will stay fixed at 20
for safety reasons, he said.

   Former leftist guerrillas who signed a
peace treaty with the government say they will return the sword of
Colombian liberator Simon Bolivar they stole 16 years ago.
   The M-19 Movement, which became a political party in March
following years of armed struggle, said Thursday that it will hand
over Bolivar's sword to the government on Dec. 17, the 160th
anniversary of the liberator's death.
   The sword was used in Colombia's battle of independence from
Spain. M-19 stole it in 1974 from Bolivar House, the patriot's
former residence in Bogota.
   The rebels in 1985 took over the Palace of Justice. About 115
people died in fighting with the army, including 11 supreme court
justices.
   After signing the peace treaty the group's presidential
candidate, Antonio Navarro, placed third in the May election. When
President Cesar Gaviria took office Tuesday, he appointed Navarro
as minister of health.

<HEAD>Judge Denies Bid to Stop Chemical Weapons Shipment</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal judge Thursday denied an environmental
group's request to immediately halt the shipment of U.S. chemical
weapons from West Germany to a Pacific island pending a hearing
later this month.
   Greenpeace USA had asked U.S. District Judge David Ezra to grant
a temporary restraining order preventing the Army from moving the
weapons from a storage site at Clausen, West Germany, to Johnston
Atoll, 800 miles southwest of Honolulu.
   Ezra denied the request, but scheduled a hearing on Greenpeace's
plea for a preliminary injunction for Aug. 20.
   The decision was a partial victory for the Bush administration,
which has pledged to remove the weapons from West Germany by the
end of the year. Government attorneys had said any halt in the
shipment could delay the operation until 1991.
   ``Events unfolding in the Middle East have painted up with
precision and clarity the importance to the national security of
the United States that commitments made by and between
representatives of nations be honored,'' Ezra's 21-page ruling said.
   Greenpeace filed a lawsuit last week naming Defense Secretary
Dick Cheney and Michael P. Stone, secretary of the Army, as
defendants. The organization said the munitions and plans to
incinerate them pose a threat to the environment and people of the
Pacific.
   Government attorneys said Johnston Atoll is the safest location
for the weapons. They said every precaution has been taken to
ensure the safety of the shipment.
   Ezra ruled that failing to immediately halt the shipment would
not cause irreversible harm to the plaintiffs' goal of keeping the
Army from transporting the munitions to Johnston Atoll, since the
weapons are not scheduled to leave West Germany until next month.
   The weapons are to be loaded onto trucks, then transferred to
rail cars bound for the North Sea. Two U.S. Navy ships are to take
the weapons to Johnston Atoll by an undisclosed route sometime
after Sept. 1.
   About 30 percent of the 100,000 rounds of nerve gas shells
already have been removed from the Clausen facility or packed into
shipping containers.
   Greenpeace attorney Skip Spaulding said he was confident the
Aug. 20 hearing would allow him to prove the Army has violated U.S.
environmental laws.
   Spaulding contended the Army violated the National Environmental
Policy Act by not filing an Environmental Impact Statement covering
the movement of the weapons within West Germany.
   The Army said it prepared an Environmental Impact Statement on
the ocean portion of the weapons' journey to Johnston. However, the
report is classified, and Ezra has not seen it.
   The Army has yet to obtain approval to incinerate the weapons at
the new Johnston Atoll Chemical Agent Disposal System. The facility
is still being tested.
   Ezra said nothing leads him to believe U.S. environmental laws
apply in West Germany when the removal of the munitions is being
assisted by that nation. However, he said the laws do apply to the
proposed incineration of the weapons at Johnston Atoll.
   President Bush has assured the West German government the
weapons will be removed by the end of the year.
   Congress has required that all U.S. chemical weapons be
destroyed by 1997.

   Three mountaineers dismantled a hammer

Soviet founder Vladimir Lenin in cardboard in Bulgaria's second
largest city, Plovdiv.
   Other countries in eastern Europe have dismantled the icons of
the communist ideology that held sway across the region for more
than four decades.
   In Bulgaria, where the former Communist party still holds power,
such de-ideologization has proceeded more slowly.
   The official news agency BTA reported that onlookers applauded
as three mountaineers scaled the local headquarters of the
Bulgarian Socialist Party, the former Communist party, to remove
the hammer and sickle on Wednesday.
   City authorities authorized the job as they prepared to move

   Anti-Communist demonstrators were denied permission to wrap the
Lenin statue in cardboard but went ahead anyway. They are
circulating a petition to remove the statue altogether.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A year after his death, Mickey Leland's hope
and vision to end world hunger is still alive.
   It's in $500,000 worth of food and supplies scheduled to leave
New York this month for Fugnido, the Ethiopian refugee camp the
Texas congressman was heading for when his plane crashed Aug. 7,
1989.
   It's in a drive expected to yield at least 30,000 pounds of food
for the Houston Food Bank.
   And it caused 336 House members to vote for more food stamp
benefits in the 1990 farm bill last week. Just after the vote, many
of them sang ``God Bless America'' in Leland's honor at a moonlight
vigil on the Capitol steps.
   ``They feel committed to make sure that things and issues that
matter to him carry forward, get attention,'' Leland's widow,
Alison, said after the tribute.
   Leland, a Democrat who served a predominantly black and Hispanic
inner-city Houston district, was best known for starting the House
Select Committee on Hunger in 1984. He chaired it until his death.
   ``Mickey had become a conscience in the Congress for fighting
malnutrition across the world,'' civil rights leader Jesse Jackson
recalled. ``Mickey Leland was unique. He was bilingual. He had a
great sense of coalition-building. He could get strange and odd
couples to do things together.''
   Leland's friend and former colleague in the Texas Legislature,
Craig Washington, was elected to his House seat in December.
Washington has taken up several of Leland's causes, most notably
the reunification of Ethiopian Jews.
   Mrs. Leland, who is an attorney, briefly considered running for
the seat. She was pregnant then and has since given birth to twin
boys. Her sons and a feeling there wasn't ``any unfinished business
on Mickey's part'' made her decide not to run, she told The
Washington Post.
   Leland and 15 others were killed shortly after the plane
carrying them left Addis Ababa, the Ethiopian capital, for refugee
camps on the Sudanese border.
   Leland took the trip to call attention to the plight of Sudanese
teen-agers who fled to Ethiopia from the civil war in their country.
   ``These particular refugee situations are among the most totally
hidden from Western view,'' said Michael Toole, an epidemiologist
with the federal Centers for Disease Control who spent June at
Fugnido and two other camps.
   Ethiopia's own hunger problem has been compounded by 380,000
Sudanese and 385,000 Somalis who fled to the country from unrest at
home. There are 77,000 Sudanese refugees at Fugnido.
   Relief workers still talked about Leland during Toole's visits,
he said.
   ``Relations between the U.S. and Ethiopia being as they are, not
totally good, Mickey helped overcome that obstacle to providing
humanitarian aid,'' Toole said. ``Humanitarian aid was provided
despite the shaky relations.''
   Aid is reaching the refugees, but their mortality rate remains
high, particularly among the Somalis, he said.
   Funding problems at the United Nations High Commission on
Refugees have made the situation worse, Toole said. But Leland's
legacy, the hunger committee, helped earlier this summer by
obtaining millions for the commission in a supplemental
appropriations bill.
   Neil Flieger, a committee staff member, said Leland galvanized
Congress to end hunger.
   ``It was a lifetime and four terms in Congress of having worked
on and paid attention to this issue and trying to get other people
to pay attention to this issue that came to an untimely end, but
also reached a crescendo that day a year ago,'' Flieger said.

<HEAD>Hubble Investigation Finds `Astonishing' Error of About 1
Millimeter</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An error of about one millimeter _ called
``astonishing'' by one expert for its large size _ has been found
in a measuring device used to guide the manufacture of a flawed
mirror on the Hubble Space Telescope.
   A NASA committee investigating the defect that has crippled the
$1.5 billion telescope announced Thursday that the millimeter
mistake was found while testing the measuring device, called a null
corrector.
   The space telescope, touted as an orbiting observatory that
would be able to see objects up to 14 billion light years away, was
launched in April.
   Engineers discovered two months later that a mirror in the
device had been manufactured wrong. As a result, the telescope's
views of stars are blurred and of severely reduced value to
astronomers.
   The investigation committee said in a one-page statement that it
found the millimeter error while testing a null corrector on
Wednesday at the Hughes Danbury Optical Systems plant in Danbury,
Conn., where the mirrors were made.
   Hughes Danbury had preserved the null corrector in the exact
position that had been used to grind and polish the mirrors in the
early 1980s.
   Preliminary results of the test, the statement said, ``have
revealed a clear discrepancy of approximately one millimeter
between the design of the null corrector and the device as it
exists.''
   A millimeter is about one twenty-fifth of an inch, or about the
size of the very tip of a ballpoint pen.
   Daniel Schulte, a senior scientist at the optical laboratory at
the Lockheed Palo Alto Research Laboratory in California, said an
error of that magnitude was ``astonishing.''
   ``That's gross,'' he said. ``There's no reason for an error of
that size to be tolerated.''
   Schulte said that in normal optical manufacturing, a difference
of a 20th or a 50th of a millimeter is considered ``standard
tolerance.''
   He said the error was so large ``it had to be a transposition of
numbers or something like that, that was carried through. It had to
be something clerical like that.''
   Schulte, an astronomer, was a member of an independent panel
named by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to
evaluate the Hubble focusing flaw just after it was discovered in
June.
   After confirming that the focusing error was in the spacecraft
mirrors, the panel was dissolved and NASA named another committee,
headed by Jet Propulsion Laboratory director Lew Allen, to
investigate the mistake.
   A null corrector is a device that can be adjusted to create a
pattern of light in the exact shape desired in an optical lens or
mirror. The light pattern from a null corrector is interpreted by
another device to tell a computer the precise grinding and
polishing pattern that must be followed.
   However, if the null corrector is set wrong, the lens or mirror
will be ground to an incorrect shape. In effect, the optics then
are made to the wrong prescription and cannot give the expected
focus.
   An engineer, who asked not to be identified, said that during
the 18-month-long mirror grinding and polishing process, at least
two measurements had been made with a second null corrector and
that errors had been found. But the errors were ignored on the
assumption that the main measuring device had the correct pattern.
   Sarah Keegan, a NASA spokeswoman, said the space agency's
investigation board would have no further statements this week. But
the board plans to conduct hearings at the Hughes Danbury plant
next Wednesday and Thursday, and more information may be released
after those hearings, she said.
   Thomas Arconti, a spokesman for Hughes Danbury, said the company
was informed of the committee finding and ``we are not in
disagreement with their release.''
   He said Hughes officials were ``surprised to find the
discrepancy,'' but ``we're not going to speculate about what might
have happened.''
   Arconti said a single null corrector was used to guide the
polishing process for the Hubble mirrors.
   Dick Wollensak, vice president of Litton Itek Optical Systems,
an unsuccessful bidder for the Hubble optical contract, said he was
surprised at the size of the error found by the investigation
committee.
   ``That is a very large error,'' he said. ``I can't imagine how
they would have missed something like that.''

   American GIs dug into position in Arabia's searing sands
Thursday while American diplomats worked the air-conditioned
corridors of power, both tightening a vise, step by step, on an
increasingly isolated Iraq.
   The dangerous U.S.-Iraqi standoff in the desert rattled nerves
across the Middle East.
   Israel fired off a test missile as a warning to the Iraqis. Air
raid sirens wailed mysteriously in Jordan. Turkish villagers said
Iraqi tanks had rumbled into position near the Turkey-Iraq border.
And Iraq closed its frontiers for foreigners, heightening concerns
about hundreds of Americans stranded in Iraq and Kuwait.
   The tension reached as far as the hills of Tennessee and farms
of Wisconsin, where local Air National Guardsmen were hurriedly
called from their civilian jobs to help ferry U.S. troops and gear
the 5,000 miles to Saudi Arabia.
   A Pentagon source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
United States was prepared to put ``many divisions'' in Saudi
Arabia in the face of a continued Iraqi buildup in Kuwait.
   ``We have contingency plans that could result in the insertion
of up to 200,000 to 250,000 ground forces before it's all done,''
said the source, who spoke on condition that further identification
be withheld. Such moves could take up to two months, the source
said.
   The Pentagon earlier reported that 50,000 Iraqi combat units
were moving south inside Iraq, and that if they entered Kuwait, the
total invasion force would number ``about 170,000.'' Only a day
earlier, the intelligence estimates had put the Iraqi force at
100,000 men.
   American leaders believe the Saudi oil kingdom could be the next
target of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, whose invasion force
conquered Kuwait last week.
   Arab leaders, desperate to defuse the explosive crisis, gathered
in Cairo in search of a peaceful resolution _ possibly an all-Arab
force to act as a border buffer between the Saudis and Americans on
one side and the Iraqis on the other.
   The summit was postponed a day until Friday. The official reason
for the postponement was some late arrivals.
   But unconfirmed reports said the summit hit a snag because the
Iraqi delegation brought its own representative for the new
Baghdad-installed Kuwaiti government. The Iraqis, according to some
reports, refused to accept the presence of Kuwait's emir.
   Taha Yassin Ramadan, the leader of the Iraqi delegation in
Cairo, asserted that the U.S. force in Saudi Arabia would be used
to attack Iraq.
   Any such move ``will be answered decisively,'' he said. Iraq's
ambassador to Greece suggested the Iraqis would unleash poison gas
on any attacking American troops.
   While the Arab presidents and sheiks marked time in Cairo,
American diplomacy pressed forward in world capitals:
   _Secretary of State James A. Baker III, in Ankara, told Turkish
leaders they could depend on their NATO allies in any showdown with
neighboring Iraq.
   _In Paris, a U.S. envoy reassured a 21-nation energy conference
that Washington would tap its huge emergency oil stockpile if the
crisis causes shortages. France promised to send an aircraft
carrier to the gulf and strengthen its naval and air forces there.
   _At U.N. headquarters in New York, the United States helped
shepherd a resolution through the Security Council rejecting Iraq's
announced annexation of Kuwait. On Monday, the council ordered a
worldwide economic embargo against Iraq.
   The Iraqi invasion of Kuwait Aug. 2 was rooted in grievances
over oil, money and land.
   Saddam complained that Kuwaiti overproduction of petroleum had
driven down world oil prices and Iraq's oil revenues. He also
rejected Kuwait's demands that Iraq repay an estimated $15 billion
in loans. And he reasserted longstanding claims on Kuwaiti
territory.
   On Thursday, a day after ``annexing'' the wealthy emirate, the
Iraqis announced they were ``cancelling'' their debt to Kuwait.
   World opinion, led by the United States, has almost universally
condemned the invasion. Iraq's neighbor and longtime enemy Iran
joined the chorus Thursday, declaring it ``will not tolerate'' the
Kuwait annexation.
   On Wednesday, President Bush announced the deployment of U.S.
troops to buttress the outmanned Saudi military and declared, ``We
must resist aggression or it will destroy us.'' An Iraqi takeover
of Saudi Arabia, a key source of U.S. oil, would endanger the U.S.
economy, he said.
   On Thursday, however, Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said the
Iraqi troops in Kuwait ``seem to be in a defensive posture.''
   At least 2,300 American soldiers, mostly from the 82nd Airborne
Division's ``ready brigade,'' were flown to Saudi Arabia on
Wednesday. Pentagon sources said elements of two other divisions _
the 101st Airborne and the 24th Mechanized Infantry _ would be
among the units to be sent.
   The United States also was dispatching some 140 F-15s, F-16s and
other warplanes, including ``tank killer'' A-10s, Pentagon and
other sources reported.
   Sources in the Middle East said the U.S. units were being
deployed at strategic airports and bases across Saudi Arabia, but
the main grouping was in the remote northeastern region of Hafr
al-Baten, near Iraqi-occupied Kuwait.
   Travelers leaving Saudi Arabia, and speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the flow of American forces to the border region
appeared to be increasing Thursday.
   The dimensions of the global U.S. operation _ many of whose
details were being kept secret _ could be seen Thursday at the
Lajes air base in Portugal's Azores islands, where eyewitnesses
reported 17 U.S. Air Force aerial tankers lined up on the runway at
one point.
   On Wednesday, diplomatic sources said hundreds of U.S. Marines
had been flown to Saudi Arabia's northeast corner and deployed at
Khafji, just seven miles from Kuwait. But on Thursday a Pentagon
source denied that, saying no Marines were in Saudi Arabia ``at
this time.''
   Besides the ground forces, powerful Navy units were converging
on the tense Persian Gulf area.
   Fifteen vessels, the biggest of them the aircraft carrier USS
Independence, were in the gulf or near its entrance. About 20 more
will be in Mideast waters by next week, including the battleship
Wisconsin, bristling with cruise missiles programmed for targets in
Iraq.

<HEAD>Soviet Government Adopts Measures to Cure Economy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has moved to get the Soviet economy
out of its slump by ordering a 32 percent increase in prices paid
to farmers for their produce and setting up a fund for state
property.
   The Tass news agency said the Council of Ministers, the Soviet
Cabinet, on Thursday ordered the increase as of Jan. 1 for sugar
beets, sunflowers, cotton, flax goods, tobacco and tea leaves. Also
covered are cattle, poultry, milk and cream.
   The measure was clearly aimed at encouraging farmers to produce
more, to help end chronic food shortages that have left many
grocery shelves bare nationwide.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev is trying to move from a
centrally planned to a regulated market economy. His advisers'
latest proposals are to be presented to the Supreme Soviet
legislature next month.
   Tass said Gorbachev decreed that a fund be set up to manage the
state's vast property. For decades, private property has been
illegal in this communist state, but Gorbachev has been moving
toward it as part of his economic reforms.
   Tass said the new fund would organize transformation of state
enterprises into joint stock societies and other new arrangements.
Its goals include breaking up state monopolies in production,
protecting state property and ``carrying out measures to privatize
property,'' Tass said.
   Gorbachev's chief economic adviser, Deputy Premier Leonid
Abalkin, told Soviet television the decree envisages widescale
denationalization of property and sale of property to individuals.
   A third measure announced by Tass suggests that government
agencies help small businesses get established and procure material
and technical support. State ministries tightly control these
aspects of the economy. Many would-be entrepreneurs say their
efforts are stifled by the ministries' strangehold.

   Hurricane Diana killed at least 38 people and
injured 80 as it battered the states of Veracruz and Hidalgo this
week, relief officials said Thursday. Eleven people were reported
missing.
   Officials said the death toll could still rise as reports come
in from isolated areas.
   The storm brushed the Yucatan peninsula, roared through Veracruz
state Monday night, and then went on to dissipate in the mountains
north of Mexico City. It subsided to a tropical storm Wednesday.
   The office of the federal Civil Protection Agency, which is
coordinating relief efforts, said it did not have a complete death
toll yet.
   However, relief officials said at least 24 people died in
Hidalgo, a small mountainous state north of Mexico City. In
addition, 80 were injured and 1,270 were left homeless there.
   Of the 24 who died, 20 drowned and four were killed when
buildings caved in, said Marco Antonio Heras, an officer with the
Hidalgo State Civil Protection Agency, in a telephone interview.
   Heras said eight townships suffered severe damage, with 333
homes partly or totally destroyed. He said Gov. Adolfo Lugo
Verduzco declared a state of emergency in those communities so they
can qualify for state aid.
   Another 14 people were killed in Veracruz state, on the Gulf of
Mexico, and 11 were missing, the relief officials said.
   About 30,000 people were left homeless and have taken shelter in
schools and other public buildings, state spokeswoman Rosa Maria
Ahuja said in a telephone interview from Jalapa, the state capital.
   The spokeswoman said state and federal officials were helping
residents in 29 communities struck by Hurricane Diana.
   A total of 17 rivers and one lake swelled by rainwater had
overflowed their banks, Ahuja said.
   The government has given hurricane victims 16,000 food packages
and 15,000 slabs of building siding, Ahuja said. A state
agricultural commission is assessing the damage to banana, orange
and corn crops, she said.
   At least two other nearby states suffered serious damage in the
storm, news reports said.

   Charlie Sheen has checked into a drug and
alcohol rehabilitation center for a month, his spokesman says.
   The 24-year-old actor, who played a raw recruit in ``Platoon''
and a rookie securities trader in ``Wall Street,'' is suffering
from ``extreme exhaustion due to an arduous filming schedule of
four features back-to-back,'' Jeff Barnard said Thursday.
   The spokesman refused to say whether Sheen has a drug or alcohol
problem and would not disclose where the actor was undergoing
treatment or when he checked in.
   Sheen is the son of actor Martin Sheen and brother of actor
Emilio Estevez. In his most recent movie, ``Navy SEALs,'' he plays
a member of an elite anti-terrorist squad.
   He also has leading roles in ``Men At Work,'' which opens Aug.
24, and ``Cadence'' and ``Rookie,'' due to be released next year.

   Princess Diana used sign language to
address 800 delegates at a British Deaf Association conference.
   The princess, who has been learning to sign since she became a
patron of the association in 1983, thanked delegates Thursday for a
book she was presented.
   ``I am very proud to receive this book, thank you. I offer my
congratulations to the British Deaf Association for 100 years of
service,'' Diana said, using her hands. The delegates responded
with a standing ovation.
   ``There were no mistakes, no fluffs and everyone in the audience
understood what she said,'' said Bernard Quinn, spokesman for the
British Deaf Association. ``She made a very important gesture to
deaf people.''
   It is the first time the 29-year-old wife of Prince Charles, the
heir to the British throne, has used the complex sign language in
public.

   Delta Burke says she will return to the set
of ``Designing Women'' next week despite her bickering with the
series' producers.
   Production on the Emmy-winning CBS comedy resumes Monday, and
Miss Burke said she plans to continue her role as the feisty
Southern belle Suzanne Sugarbaker.
   Miss Burke and ``Designing Women'' producers Harry Thomason and
Linda Bloodworth-Thomason have been slinging accusations about
problems on the set.
   The producers have claimed Miss Burke behaved badly on the set
last season. The actress has contended she was harassed about
gaining weight.
   The actress recently was nominated for an Emmy for best actress
in a comedy series.
   Thomason earned a nomination for his directorial work on an
episode called ``They Shoot Fat Women, Don't They?'' in which Miss
Burke's character dealt with a weight problem.

   Folk singer Arlo Guthrie says it's
ridiculous to put labels on records warning the lyrics may be
offensive.
   ``The fact that people can spend their time thinking about all
that stuff when there are disasters going on all around us is kind
of silly, I think,'' Guthrie said. He added, ``The fear of music is
more harmful than bad music.''
   Guthrie, the son of folk legend Woody Guthrie, is known for his
hits ``Alice's Restaurant'' and ``City of New Orleans.'' He was
scheduled for a concert tonight at the Tennessee Performing Arts
Center.
   In May, the Recording Industry Association of America unveiled a
voluntary ``parental guidance'' label for recordings that might be
deemed objectionable because of lyrics dealing with such themes as
sex, violence, suicide or drugs.

<TEXT>
   A presidential spokesman said U.S.
Marines fired from a helicopter at President Samuel Doe on the
porch of his executive mansion Thursday in an unsuccessful attempt
to assassinate him.
   In Washington, the State Department denied the charge.
   Doe spokesman Selly Thompson, speaking in a radio telephone call
with the British Broadcasting Corp., said a Doe adviser, former
Justice Minister Isaac Nyaplu, was hit in the chest and neck and
was hospitalized.
   The incident came as West African peacekeeping troops headed for
a showdown with rebels, who battled Doe's troops and fought to
within a mile of his mansion in a bid to take Monrovia before the
African task force arrives.
   Rebels loyal to former bureaucrat Charles Taylor pushed into
eastern Congo Town suburb, where they ransacked the Nigerian
Embassy and attacked the Guinea Embassy.
   They forced thousands of people seeking refuge at the Nigerian
Embassy, most from Nigeria, into streets where battles raged.
   It was not clear what happened at the Guinea Embassy, which had
given sanctuary to thousands of people from the Mandingo tribe
seeking safety from the rebel who have killed thousands of their
people, accusing them of supporting and enriching themselves on
Doe's corrupt regime.
   Nigerian Foreign Minister Rilwanu Lukman said in Lagos that his
government sent word to Taylor ``that we will hold him personally
responsible for any harm done to Nigerians inside the embassy at
the time of the attack.''
   In alleging the U.S. assassination attempt, Thompson asked the
international community to pressure the United States to stop
``excessive harassment'' to remove Doe.
   ``He said ... Doe and all those in the Executive Mansion have
felt under contant harassment from the U.S. Marines, and he was
sure that the United States government was now going out
deliberately to kill the president,'' said the BBC report.
   Last month, Doe accused a U.S. submarine of firing on his
mansion. The United States denied it.
   State Depapartment deputy spokesman Richard Boucher said the
United States has evacuated 150 people from Liberia this week,
including the French and Italian ambassadors.
   He said prior to the alleged assassination attempt that Prince
Johnson, a rebel leader who is a rival of Taylor, ``has not carried
out his threat to fire on the Marines.''
   He said the Marines ``are there to protect the embassy and the
Americans there. ... They're not in Monrovia to intervene in the
fighting or to take sides.
   Diplomats say Taylor wants to capture the city by the weekend.
   The five-nation West African force, dominated by Nigerian
soldiers, mobilized to move into Liberia and impose a cease-fire,
by force if necessary.
   Troops and tanks were reported massing across Liberia's northern
border in Guinea and to the east on the Sierra Leone border,
according to military sources in Ghana and Sierra Leone. Reports
said 500 troops were on standby and may be airlifted into Monrovia.
   Nigerian troop transports and warships were reported headed for
Monrovia harbor.
   A contingent of 225 U.S. Marines set up defensive positions
around their embassy and key U.S. installations on Sunday. They
evacuated scores of foreign nationals.
   France announced it was closing its embassy and evacuating the
small remaining staff and any French nationals who could reach
evacuation points.
   Taylor's men on Thursday fought Doe's troops in Congo Town, an
eastern suburb in which lie embassies and St. Joseph's Catholic
Hospital, the only hospital still operating in Monrovia.
   ``There is fighting going on all around the hospital and workers
there are cut off from an embassy where they were staying,'' a
European relief worker said in a radio communication from Monrovia
to Europe. The name of the agency was withheld to protect its
workers in Liberia.
   Rebels reportedly met little resistance in their overnight
advance.
   The relief worker said Taylor's rebels ``plundered the
(Nigerian) embassy and forced the refugees out.'' She said it was
not clear if anyone was wounded.
   There were no reports about what had happened at the Guinea
Embassy.
   A Foreign Ministry spokesman in Bonn said 300 people from the
Nigerian Embassy sought refuge at the West German mission. He said
about 500 refugees now were at the mission, including Americans,
Belgians, French, Dutch, Irish, Liberians and Filipinos.
   A relief worker said doctors in Monrovia asked Doe Thursday for
permission to burn down St. Peter's Lutheran Church to prevent a
plague being spread by decomposing bodies of up to 600 refugees.
Survivors said the victims were massacred by Doe's troops July 30.
Doe said the killers were rebels in dressed in government uniforms.
   The attack on the Nigerian Embassy raised tension in the region
two days after leaders of the West African Economic Community
decided to send troops to end the 7-month-old civil war, in which
at least 5,000 people have died.
   President Joseph Momoh of Sierra Leone told his troops in
Freetown on Thursday, ``The need for you as soldiers going to
Liberia is due to the deterioration which has resulted in the
displacement of innocent citizens, and also in anarchy.''
   He said about 80,000 refugees who fled to Sierra Leone were
affecting his country's economy and social life, while Sierra
Leoneans stranded in Monrovia and sheltering at their country's
embassy had no food or medicines.
   There are more than 400,000 Liberian refugees in neighboring
states.
   Doe and Prince Johnson have welcomed the West African initiative.
   Taylor is opposed. He fears Nigerian participation because its
president, Gen. Ibrahim Babangida, in the past has been an ally of
Doe.
   Momoh emphasized the task force ``is to maintain neutrality and
our intention is not to take over Liberia.''
   Gambian leader Sir Dawda Jawara told the BBC there were no plans
to ask the Nigerians to withdraw from the joint force because of
Taylor's opposition.
   The West Africans say they will enforce a cease-fire to allow
formation of an interim government charged with organizing free and
fair elections within a year.
   On Wednesday, Johnson freed the last of dozens of foreign
hostages seized Monday and Tuesday in a bid to force foreign
intervention.
   The civil war began when Taylor led an insurgent force across
the border from the Ivory Coast, accusing Doe of corruption and
mismanagement.

<HEAD>Justice Department Challenges Georgia's Runoff Election System</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID PACE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department's challenge to
Georgia's majority vote election runoff system ultimately could aid
Republican candidates in the South and Southwest _ not blacks, a
political observer says.
   The department sued Thursday, contending that Georgia's election
runoff system has had ``a chilling effect on black political
participation.''
   Ten states in the South and Southwest have laws requiring a
runoff election if no candidate receives a majority of the votes in
a general election.
   ``The Republican Party can be made overnight in the South if
that runoff law is eliminated,'' said Claiborne Darden, an
Atlanta-based pollster. ``That would do more for the Republican
Party than Republicans could do for themselves in 125 years.''
   Without runoff elections, Darden said, blacks would win more
Democratic primaries. But they would lose general elections to GOP
candidates backed by white voters who previously supported white
Democratic candidates, he said.
   John R. Dunne, assistant attorney general for civil rights, said
more than 35 black candidates in over 20 counties in Georgia have
finished first in multi-candidate primary elections in recent
years, only to lose in runoffs against a single white candidate.
   He said the law amounts to ``an electoral steroid for white
candidates'' because it gives them ``an extraordinary power'' over
black candidates in states with racially polarized voting.
   The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Atlanta, contends that
the 1964 Georgia law requiring candidates to receive a majority of
the vote to win an election deprives black voters of an equal
opportunity to elect candidates of their choice.
   The suit marks the first time the Justice Department has used
the 1965 Voting Rights Act to challenge a state's majority vote
runoff system, a position Jesse Jackson first advocated during his
1984 presidential campaign.
   Jackson tried unsuccessfully that year to persuade the
Democratic Party to take a stand against majority vote runoff
elections in its presidential platform. Democratic presidential
nominee Walter Mondale opposed the effort.
   Jackson's Georgia coordinator in 1984, state Rep. Tyrone Brooks
of Atlanta, renewed the effort earlier this year when he filed suit
in federal court asking that Georgia's runoff system be invalidated.
   A federal judge refused to rule on the issue before this
summer's Georgia elections. Former Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young, who
was seeking to become Georgia's first black governor, opposed the
lawsuit.
   Young finished second in the Democratic primary and then was
swamped by Lt. Gov. Zell Miller in Tuesday's runoff election.
   The runoff law, however, has made the political careers of other
Georgia leaders. Sen. Sam Nunn, Gov. Joe Frank Harris, and Rep.
John Lewis, all Georgia Democrats, were elected for the first time
after finishing second in Democratic primaries and then winning the
runoff.
   ``I think the runoff is enormously important, and I think
majority rule is important,'' Nunn said Thursday. ``And I believe
that if you deprive the people of the right to make that decision
by majority votes, you've greatly damaged the election process.''
   Asked if he believed the suit was an effort by Republicans to
weaken the Democratic Party in the South, Nunn said, ``I wouldn't
want to make that charge. But I certainly disagree with the Justice
Department getting involved in this.''
   Dunne said the department has no immediate plans to challenge
the election systems in Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida,
Louisiana, Oklahoma, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Texas, the
only other states with laws requiring a majority vote to be
nominated or elected to office.
   But he said those state runoff laws, because of their similarity
to the Georgia law, likely would be overturned should the
department prevail in the Georgia case.
   Dunne said the department's lawsuit challenges only elections
where the majority vote requirement has been used to dilute the
voting strength of minorities. That would include most statewide
elections, he said, and many local elections where blacks are a
large bloc of the voting population but have been unable to elect
black candidates.
   Dunne said about 24 percent of Georgia's voting age population
is black, but less than 10 percent of the elected offices in the
state are held by blacks, and most of those are at the local level.

<HEAD>Report Says Reagan White House Thwarted Study</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congressional investigators say a Reagan White
House plan to deny federal liability in toxic exposure cases led to
the cancellation of a major study of Agent Orange's effects on
Vietnam veterans.
   A House panel concluded in a report issued Thursday that the
White House ``controlled and obstructed'' the study Congress
ordered from the Centers for Disease Control.
   The report by the House Government Operations Committee
supported arguments by the American Legion and the Vietnam Veterans
of America. They filed a lawsuit last week seeking to have the CDC
resume its study of the health effects of Agent Orange exposure
during the Vietnam war.
   ``While the Reagan administration defended the Vietnam conflict
as an honorable war, it worked behind the scenes to deny benefits
to the very people who sacrificed their health for their country,''
said Rep. Ted Weiss, D-N.Y., chairman of the subcommittee that
wrote the report.
   The report followed a 14-month investigation and hearings by
Weiss' subcommittee.
   In a written dissent, the subcommittee's ranking Republican said
the report's conclusion of a White House plot to cover up the truth
about Agent Orange ``is simply not supported by the facts.''
   ``Instead of advancing the debate on Agent Orange in a positive
direction, the human resources subcommittee has abused this issue
in order to launch an ideological assault upon a Republican White
House with which it has never agreed,'' Rep. Richard K. Armey,
R-Texas, said.
   Agent Orange was a herbicide used to destroy ground cover during
the Vietnam war. It has been blamed by veterans groups for 19
cancers and a variety of other health problems, including birth
defects.
   Congress ordered the CDC study to determine whether Vietnam
veterans had been exposed to Agent Orange. It was to be used as a
basis for other studies measuring links to health problems.
   The report said the White House ordered the study's cancellation
after the CDC said it was scientifically impossible to use military
records to identify veterans who had been exposed.
   The committee said the study should have continued ``because CDC
did not document that exposure could not be assessed'' and
disregarded alternate methods of measuring exposure.
   ``The White House compromised the independence of the CDC and
undermined the study by controlling crucial decisions and guiding
the course of research, at the same time it had secretly taken a
legal position to resist demands to compensate victims of Agent
Orange exposure and industrial accidents,'' the report said.
   At the CDC in Atlanta, spokeswoman Gayle Lloyd said the agency
would have no comment because it had not seen the report. But she
said, ``We do stand by our studies and our decisions.''
   A spokeswoman for the Department of Veterans Affairs, Donna St.
John, said the agency had no comment.
   The study was officially monitored by a White House task force
called the Agent Orange Working Group. The House panel concluded
the White House controlled the study through the working group and
the Office of Management and Budget.
   The panel said that despite evidence Vietnam veterans are more
susceptible to certain forms of cancer and birth defects in their
offspring, the federal government has consistently refused to
acknowledge any link to Agent Orange exposure.
   ``The federal government has suppressed or minimized findings of
ill health effects among Vietnam veterans that could be linked to
Agent Orange exposure,'' the report said.
   But Armey said in his dissent scientific information has failed
to establish any conclusive link between Agent Orange and health
problems. He said that ``compensating veterans for simple exposure
to Agent Orange is a political decision, not a scientific one.''
   The VA this year decided to award compensation for two rare
cancers, soft-tissue sarcoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, linked to
Agent Orange.

   Stores were closed, buses stayed in the garage
and soldiers in tanks patrolled the streetson the first day of an
economic austerity program. Three people died in isolated protests
and looting.
   The capital's normally crowded downtown streets were nearly
deserted Thursday in the hours after the new government of
President Alberto Fujimori announced a plan to end soaring
inflation.
   A military state of emergency was declared early this week to
prepare for the rigid measures, announced Wednesday by Prime
Minister Carlos Hurtado Miller, also the country's economy minister.
   Under the plan, the price of gasoline jumped from 7 cents per
gallon to more than $2. Many basic foods tripled and quadrupled in
cost. Price subsidies, a staple of government policy for four
decades, are to be eliminated.
   Controls will be removed to allow the inti _ the nation's
currency _ to float free. If the value of the inti against other
currencies falls as expected, Peruvian products would be cheaper
abroad and spur exports.
   Import duties will be drastically cut, forcing Peruvian industry
to compete with foreign-made goods. Taxes will be raised,
especially for the rich.
   ``God help us,'' Hurtado said after announcing the measures.
   The austerity plan aims to slash the 3,000 annual inflation
rate. The government also hopes to provide the basis for rebuilding
Peru's collapsed economy, which has shrunk by 20 percent in the
last two years.
   Industry runs at less than half its capacity. Automobile sales
last year were 10 percent of 1967 levels. Only one in five
Peruvians holds an official job.
   Peru's worst drought this century has deepened the crisis. Up to
70 percent of many crops, including staples such as the potato,
have been lost.
   Authorities are uncertain how Peruvians will respond to the
measures. Many people voted for Fujimori because of his strong
opposition to the harsh austerity plan proposed by campaign
opponent Mario Vargas Llosa.
   The poor are especially liable to feel betrayed by the austerity
program. About one-third of Peru's 22 million people live in
critical poverty and the great majority voted for Fujimori.
   Nevertheless, it is this sector of the population that will
likely suffer most from the measures. Many of the poor will simply
be unable to afford food or bus fares.
   The government has said it will hand out food and subsidize
water and bus service. The government has promised $450 million to
help the poor survive the economic adjustment, Hurtado said
Wednesday.
   But new bus fares had yet to be set Thursday night and most
municipalities lacked the food to set up soup kitchens. The
government has yet to raise most of the $450 million.
   Markets were shuttered Thursday, exacerbating the situation.
Most of Peru's poor buy food on a day-by-day basis.
   ``What am I going to eat? What are my children going to eat?''
Maria Vidaurre said Thursday before the locked gates of a
shantytown market. She held an empty plastic bag.
   Many economists, including top Fujimori advisers, have said
Peru's economy is too weak to absorb an extreme austerity program.
They said vastly higher prices accompanied by a tight monetary
policy could paralyze the country.
   Many believe the key to the austerity program's success will be
the military's ability to keep order.
   The army has taken a major role in Fujimori's government, with
active generals running the ministries of defense and interior.
Many police responsibilities were transferred to military control
last week, after a purge of top police officials.
   The state of emergency _ which allows the army to arrest people
without hearings and to search houses without warrant _ was decreed
two days before Hurtado's speech.
   The strict security measures are to help quell a 10-year-old
insurgency by leftist Shining Path rebels in which more than 15,000
people have died.

   President Bush is headed to Maine on a 3{-week
vacation, saying ``life goes on'' despite the Persian Gulf crisis.
   Bush and his wife Barbara were leaving the White House for their
summer home in Kennebunkport, three days after Bush sent American
troops and warplanes off to defend Saudi Arabia against Iraqi
aggression.
   ``Life goes on,'' Bush said Thursday evening when asked if he
really planned to go on vacation.
   ``Gotta keep moving. Can't stay in one place all the time,'' the
president said, bantering with reporters after leaving the Oval
Office.
   He later went out to dinner with his wife, who had flown down
from their oceanside home for the day. She had been in Maine with
grandchildren since July 27.
   The White House said Bush was taking extra staff with him to
Maine to help monitor events in the Middle East in the wake of last
week's Iraqi occupation of Kuwait and the deployment of U.S. troops
to Saudi Arabia.
   Bush also will fly back to Washington on Wednesday for a
military briefing, then return to Maine, where he will stay until
Labor Day, Sept. 3.
   ``The president will be conducting the business of the
presidency at Kennebunkport just as he does every year and every
vacation,'' press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said. That goes on
``24 hours a day, every day of the week, wherever he is.''
   Bush's oceanfront home at Walker's Point has its own helipad,
sophisticated communications equipment, and is heavily protected on
land by the Secret Service and at sea by Coast Guard ships hovering
offshore.
   Fitzwater said the White House never seriously considered
canceling the vacation plans.
   Bush has gone to Kennebunkport every summer of his life except
1944, when he was off in the Pacific flying bombing missions for
the Navy against the Japanese in World War II.
   Either Bush's national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, or his
deputy, Robert Gates, always accompanies Bush to Kennebunkport and
provides daily briefings on the latest U.S. intelligence from hot
spots around the world.
   ``Our forces are in Saudi Arabia on a defensive basis. They're
not involved in conflict, and there's not the need for any kind of
minute-by-minute or hour-by-hour update that might be necessary if
they were actually involved in combat,'' said Fitzwater.
   Bush plans to fly to Baltimore on Aug. 20 to address the
Veterans of Foreign Wars convention. He also will attend several
fund-raising events for GOP candidates in New England during his
vacation.

<HEAD>Federal Agency Seeks $40.9 Million From Keating, Five Associates</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal regulators want Charles H. Keating Jr.
and five associates to pay $40.9 million to the defunct Lincoln
Savings and Loan Association for losses it suffered from three sour
business deals.
   But a spokesman for Keating and lawyers for his company accused
the Office of Thrift Supervision of trying to harass the Phoenix
businessman because regulators have failed to prove allegations
raised in court cases.
   OTS launched administrative proceedings Thursday against
Keating, the chairman of American Continental Corp., and five of
the company's top officers. The regulators are seeking to recover
money they say was improperly used to finance questionable business
deals.
   The agency also seeks to remove Keating and the five executives
from the company and bar them forever from the thrift industry.
   American Continental, which owned Lincoln Savings and Loan,
filed for bankruptcy protection a day before the Irvine, Calif.,
thrift was seized by federal regulators in April, 1989.
   Lincoln, which Keating's company acquired in 1984, invested
heavily in the junk bond market. A federal grand jury in Los
Angeles is investigating possible criminal wrongdoing in the S&amp;L's
$2 billion failure.
   Keating has repeatedly claimed he is broke.
   But OTS Director Timothy Ryan said regulators ``just do not
believe him right now'' and want a full accounting of Keating's
personal assets in five days. ``There was much too much money that
was available to him and too short a time for it all to
disappear,'' Ryan said.
   A temporary cease and desist order demanding that he account for
his assets also bars Keating from moving any money out of the
country. It also forbids him from making any transactions over
$5,000 without first notifying OTS.
   American Continental spokesman Bradley Boland said Keating and
his associates would ``take every legal opportunity that is
available'' to fight the charges.
   Ryan said an administrative law judge will hear the case in late
October. OTS may seek additional restitution after completing
investigations of other deals financed by Lincoln, he said.
   A statement issued by lawyers representing American Continental
said the OTS action ``appears to be a case of duplicative and
harassing litigation.
   ``In its claim for restitution, the government is again seeking
the same relief against the same individuals with respect to the
same transactions that are at issue in the civil RICO suit it filed
nearly a year ago,'' the lawyers said in a statement read by
Washington attorney Leonard Bickwit Jr.
   Last September, the Resolution Trust Corp. and the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corp. cited the same three transactions outlined
in the OTS charges in a racketeering suit against Keating and his
associates filed under the Racketeer-Influenced Corrupt
Organizations law.
   Keating in turn sued federal regulators, charging that the
seizure of Lincoln Savings was unwarranted. The case is still
unresolved.
   The agency's complaint details a loss to Lincoln of $24.2
million for an investment in a money-losing hotel in Detroit, and a
$4.4 million loss on what regulators called the sham sale of desert
land in Arizona.
   It also outlines how Lincoln lost $12.3 million when it financed
an employee stock ownership plan's purchase of American Continental
stock from Keating and others.
   The charges also were filed against five other American
Continental officers: Judy J. Wischer, president and chief
executive officer; Robert J. Kielty, a director, senior vice
president and general counsel; Keating's son, Charles H. Keating
III, an executive vice president and director; and two of Keating's
sons-in-law who are vice presidents, Robert J. Hubbard and Robert
M. Wurzelbacher Jr.
   The Justice Department is investigating whether Keating
illegally donated $1.3 million to five senators who in 1987
intervened with federal regulators on his behalf, sources say. The
Senate Ethics Committee is also investigating the allegations of
misconduct against the five lawmakers.

Missile</HEAD>

   Despite threats by Iraqi president Saddam
Hussein to use chemical weapons against Israel, analysts say they
do not believe Iraq has developed a chemical warhead capable of
reaching the Jewish state by missile.
   The experts said Iraq's only option was to deliver the chemical
weapons to Israel by artillery bombardments or air raids, which
would have little chance of success.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, meanwhile, compared the Iraqi
leader with Hitler and warned him that the Jewish people would
retaliate if attacked.
   Saddam has threatened to attack Israel in case of an American
military strike in the Persian Gulf.
   Speaking to graduates of the army's defense college on Thursday,
Shamir said he was not taking the Iraqi leaders threats lightly and
warned any attempt to harm Israel ``will cost him and his army a
heavy price.''
   After comparing him to Hitler, Shamir noted that the decades
since the Holocaust has changed the Jewish nation, which lost some
six million people during World War II.
   ``This time the Jewish nation has the ability and the tools to
defend itself, and if need be, to repel and defeat,'' he said.
   Iraq has the Soviet-made Scud B or SS-1 surface-to-surface
missiles with a range of 170 miles and the Iraqi-modified version
of these, al-Hussein, with a range of 370 to 430 miles.
   Israeli generals decided last weekend to step up the
distribution of gas masks nationwide. But Chief of Staff Lt.Gen.
Dan Shomron told Israel television the army was refraining from
distributing the masks because the hysteria would be ``playing into
the hands of Saddam Hussein.''
   ``We have the ability to prevent the attacks on Israel,'' he
said without elaborating.
   Joseph Alpher, an analyst at the Jaffee Center for Strategic
Studies, said he believed Saddam did not yet have chemical warheads
for its surface-to-surface missiles despite Iraqi efforts to
develop rockets capable of carrying the payload.
   Moshe Shlonsky, Israel television's military affairs reporter,
said Iraq could only deliver chemical weapons on Israel through
atillery bombardment from batteries deployed along the
Israel-Jordanian border or from long distance air raids which
involved mid-flight refuling.
   ``The chance of this happening without being foiled by Israel is
not great,'' he said.
   However, Aharon Levran, a strategic analyst and former brigadier
general, believed Saddam would not have made the threats to us
chemical weapons against Israel if he did not have the capability
of delivering them.

<HEAD>Soldiers in Saudi Arabia Learned Desert Warfare in California</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRUCE V. BIGELOW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FORT IRWIN, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia prepared
for the searing heat and gear-grinding sand of the Middle East by
taking part in mock combat on a 1,000-square-mile patch of the
Mojave Desert near Death Valley.
   Summertime temperatures at the Army's Fort Irwin National
Training Center reach about 120 degrees, about 10 degrees hotter
than Saudi Arabia, where President Bush sent troops to defend the
oil kingdom against Iraq.
   At the outset of the deployment, Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of
the joint chiefs of staff, noted that troops of the departing 82nd
Airborne Division learn desert warfare and chemical combat at the
California base.
   In fact, every Army brigade visits about once every 18 months
and spends two weeks in war games. Since 1982, about 390,000 Army
soldiers have battled the elements _ and each other.
   Visiting soldiers face the resident 177th Armored Brigade, a
2,300-member unit trained in Soviet tactics, including gas attacks,
said Maj. John Wagstaffe, a base spokesman.
   ``You can die every day for 14 days at the National Training
Center, and that's a sobering thing for most soldiers,'' Wagstaffe
said Thursday.
   ``What we're hoping is that by dying 14 times out here, we'll
help prevent our soldiers from dying when they have to go into real
combat.''
   Fort Irwin is on a high desert plain. The nearest town is
Barstow, 37 miles away. The isolation allows a full range of
military operations, including artillery fire, radio jamming and
low flying of jets and helicopters.
   President Bush visited the center in February and interrupted a
mock battle to address troops by radio.
   ``Military challenges to democracy persist in every hemisphere
and America must always be prepared to fight for freedom and
security,'' he said.
   From a hill, Bush watched bursts of artillery and streaking
jets. He saw the Soviet-style opposing force break through the Army
team's lines.
   Making mistakes is part of the training, Wagstaffe said. One
lieutenant had his squad prepare for a tank attack by digging a
deep trench, but forgot to close one end of the ditch, allowing
tanks to pour in.
   ``The lieutenant who dug this hole, I guarantee you, will not
make the same mistake in Saudi Arabia, in Panama or anywhere
else,'' said Wagstaffe.
   Soviet desert warfare features a speedy, swarming style based on
surprise and a ``be-damned attitude about taking casualties,'' he
said. U.S.-Soviet tensions have eased, but Iraq and 30 other
nations train with Soviet military tactics and use their equipment.
   Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, who boasts a battle-hardened army
of 1 million, has used poison gas in his war with Iran. Gas also
was used against Iraq's Kurdish minority.
   Tear gas is substituted for mustard gas and nerve gas in the
Fort Irwin war games, which count ``kills'' with laser beams and
sensors.
   The ``enemy'' soldiers of the 177th use the gas freely,
Wagstaffe said. Targeted soldiers scramble into protective
clothing. It takes 15 seconds to put on gas masks and hoods, eight
minutes to don hot, cumbersome full-body suits.
   The war is make-believe, but sometimes the dying is real.
Helicopter accidents, bad-weather parachute jumps and vehicle
accidents have killed at least 20 soldiers in recent years.

   Although Iraq was removed in 1982 from
the U.S. list of countries that support terrorism, the Baghdad
government still uses force and intimidation against opponents at
home and abroad, experts say.
   Iraqi exiles say President Saddam Hussein uses an extensive
network of informers, especially among the Iraqi student community
abroad, to finger opponents of his government and to plot their
assassinations.
   Prof. Bernard Reich, specialist in Middle East politics and
terrorism at George Washington University in Washington, said
Saddam is ``demonstrating that those not bending to his views will
face terror and intimidation. Without question he has employed
state terrorism and chemical warfare and has been willing to use it
against his own people.''
   Saddam has used poison gas against Kurds seeking independence
from the Baghdad government.
   Within the Arab world, Saddam's goals are ``Iraqi leadership and
that he is prepared to use virtually all means to achieve that end,
from economic intimidation to the use of force and terror,'' Reich
said in an interview.
   The United States resumed relations with Iraq in 1984 after a
17-year lapse, citing in part Iraq's improved record on terrorism.
   The U.S. State Department said in its annual report on terrorism
last April that Iraq was still working toward improving its image
and wasn't known to have sponsored any acts of terrorism in the
past year.
   But the latest U.S. State Department report on human-rights
practices around the world said: ``Iraq's human-rights record
remained abysmal in 1989.'' ``The intelligence services engage in
extensive surveillance and utilize extralegal means, including
torture and summary execution, to deal with anti-regime activity,''
the report said.
   As recently as April, the U.S. State Department expelled an
Iraqi diplomat at the United Nations because of his suspected role
in an alleged plot to murder two opponents of the Baghdad
government in California.
   Two years ago, Sudan accused an unidentified Iraqi diplomat of
assassinating an Iraqi opposition leader who was killed by two
gunmen as he sat in the lobby of the Khartoum Hilton hotel.
   On terrorism, the department said Iraq has continued to provide
safe haven to some Palestinian groups, including the Iraqi-created
Arab Liberation Front and Abul Abbas' Palestine Liberation Front.
   It cited press reports that Abu Ibrahim, whom it described as
the former leader of the now defunct 15 May terrorist organization,
had returned to Iraq.
   ``Abu Ibrahim is known for the skill with which he built highly
sophisticated and lethal suitcase bombs,'' the department said.
   Notorious terrorist mastermind Abu Nidal once lived in Baghdad
but he was kicked out more than a decade ago as Saddam sought a
more moderate image in the West.
   Abu Nidal, the nom de guerre of Sabri al-Banna, reportedly lives
in Libya where his movement is riven with an internal feud. He was
expelled from Iraq in 1978, but reportedly returned for a while in
late 1982.
   Nowadays Iraq provides a haven to only a few such international
terror groups _ most of which are thought to operate from Libya or
Syria.
   But Reich said Saddam might try to exploit any terrorist groups
that remain headquartered in Baghdad.
   In the current Middle East crisis, the focus is on major
military intimidation, Reich said. But he said that if Saddam
should make a face-saving retreat he might revert to terrorist
attacks on American and other Western targets outside the Middle
East.

<HEAD>Quayle Far from Main Arena in Gulf Crisis But in Touch with White
House</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An hour into the inauguration of a new
Colombian president, with the ornate oratory just getting started,
the emergency call came from the White House to Bogota with word
for Vice President Dan Quayle.
   American troops and warplanes would be sent to Saudi Arabia to
defend against possible invasion by Iraq. Word of the decision was
seeping out, and the White House wanted Quayle forewarned that what
had been secret was becoming public.
   The vice president couldn't take the call himself. He was in a
front row VIP seat on the inaugural platform of Cesar Gaviria, a
spot too prominent to leave for a phone call.
   ``I had a pretty good idea what it was about, and I was right,''
Quayle said Thursday as he flew home from a three-day Latin
American mission that had left him far from the arena as the
administration dealt with the Persian Gulf crisis.
   ``I knew that we were going in.''
   Quayle wouldn't say when he knew. ``I'll leave it to others to
get into a tick-tock situation,'' he said.
   The vice president left Washington for Bogota on Tuesday, the
sixth day of the crisis triggered by Saddam Hussein's invasion of
Kuwait. There had been crisis conferences with President Bush every
day since Friday, and the administration had planned its course.
   ``There was no reason for me to cancel this trip,'' Quayle said.
   By late afternoon Tuesday, Bush's decision to send forces to
Saudi Arabia began to leak, prompting the call to alert Quayle.
William Kristol, his chief of staff, took it in a sitting room of
the Colombian presidential palace, set aside for Quayle and for
U.S. Embassy use that day.
   Quayle got word of the message before the inauguration was over,
and details before he left Bogota for Lima, Peru. Aides said there
was no thought of returning to Washington, and no need.
   While Bush delivered his televised address to the nation
Wednesday morning, announcing what he called a defensive stand
against ``an aggressive dictator threatening his neighbors,''
Quayle was at a breakfast meeting with Peruvian business and civic
leaders.
   He couldn't break away, and the U.S. ambassador's residence in
Lima doesn't have cable television anyhow. Kristol was the relay
man again. This time he slipped out of the breakfast meeting and
went upstairs, telephoned Quayle aides at the Sheraton Lima Hotel,
and had them hold the phone up against a television set so that he
could take notes on the Bush address.
   It turned out to be unnecessary; the White House had faxed a
text of the speech to the vice president, and it got there before
the breakfast was over. Quayle said he had a good idea of what Bush
was going to say from their conversations on the crisis before he
left Washington.
   In Bogota, Quayle had talked with Venezuelan President Carlos
Andres Perez about the crisis, and had assurances that he would
work to make up the oil shortfall stemming from the crisis _ about
4.5 million barrels a day in Iraqi and Kuwaiti production. Perez
was said to have told Quayle that Venezuelan production would be
increased by 500,000 barrels, and that other OPEC oil nations also
would boost production.
   That message went the other way, from Quayle's traveling party
to the White House.
   ``We're in contact. I wouldn't say on an hourly basis, but every
couple of hours,'' Quayle said.
   But it was long distance, very long distance.
   While Quayle was dealing with drug control efforts and Latin
American development and aid programs, the Middle East crisis came
up constantly, in his conferences with the presidents of Colombia,
Peru and Bolivia, and in his public statements.
   Once, he was asked about the danger of Iraq's ``poison bombs,''
a reference to the threat of chemical weapons in the Gulf conflict.
``We are fully appraised of the military capability of Iraq,'' he
said. ``We will be able to defend ourselves and to work for the
defense of Saudi Arabia.''
   Quayle returned to Washington Thursday night, after a four-hour
stop in Haiti in the cause of free elections there. Elections are
scheduled on Nov. 4. Quayle met with leaders of the provisional
government, the armed forces and an electoral commission to urge
that they work to enable the Haitian people ``to go to the polls to
vote in free, secure and credible elections.''
   Elections in 1987 were aborted by violence in which at least 34
people were killed.
   ``Haiti deserves democracy,'' Quayle told about 200 military men
and government officials. ``So my message is: no coups, no murders,
no threats.
   ``And instead, free and fair elections that will bring honor to
the brave people of Haiti.''

   An Air Force Security Police
airman shot and killed a man who drove through a security
checkpoint at an entrance to Andrews Air Force Base.
   The man, described as a 34-year-old civilian, was pronounced
dead at Malcolm Grow Medical Center on the base about 1:05 p.m.
Thursday, Lt. Col. Temple Black said.
   The man drove through the base's manned west gate shortly after
12:30 p.m., base officials said.
   Guards shouted at the man to stop, but he continued driving
erratically for about 200 yards, officials said.
   It was unclear whether the driver stopped when asked, Black
said. It also was unclear whether the man was inside or outside of
the car when he was shot.
   The incident was being investigated by the Air Force's Office of
Special Investigations and the FBI.
   Hospital officials said the man's relatives had been notified of
his death. Base officials gave no reason for withholding his

<HEAD>Government Orders Sulfur Cut in Diesel Fuel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Environmental Protection Agency is
ordering an 80 percent cut in diesel fuel sulfur content, saying
the move would help get rid of black smoke belched from truck
tailpipes.
   ``This control measure is an important step for cleaner air and
protection from the harmful effects'' of pollution, EPA
Administrator William K. Reilly said Thursday.
   The regulation will boost the price of diesel fuel as much as
2.3 cents per gallon, he said. It requires refiners to reduce
sulfur content of the fuel used on the road from 0.25 percent by
weight to 0.05 percent, effective Oct. 1, 1993.
   Small refiners have until 1995 to phase in the new standards as
they install equipment to remove the sulfur, Reilly said. During
that period, they will have to meet a set of interim standards.
   The new regulation will help manufacturers of large diesel
engines meet a 1985 requirement to curtail emissions of diesel
``particulates,'' said Jeff Alson, an engineer with the EPA's
Office of Mobile Sources in Ann Arbor, Mich.
   The particulates _ tiny bits of soot, hydrocarbons and other
materials _ are inhaled and tend to remain in the human respiratory
tract, Alson said. They often are contaminated with poisonous fumes.
   EPA recently declared the diesel particulate a probable
carcinogen. It is believed to cause about 600 cases of cancer a
year.
   ``It's nowhere near as big a carcinogen as cigarette smoking,
for example, but we still want to minimize the damage,'' Alson said.
   Reilly said the new regulation on diesel sulfur and the 1985
rule on particulates, which will be fully effective next year, will
``virtually eliminate the black smoke from diesel tailpipes,
cutting particulates by 90 percent,'' Reilly said.

   A black FBI agent who charged in civil suits
he was racially harassed by white agents will receive full pay and
pension benefits, possibly worth more than $1 million, under a
settlement of the case, his lawyer says.
   Attorneys for Donald Rochon, 40, and the FBI signed an agreement
this week that settles the three-year-old legal battle arising from
the black agent's charges he was harassed by white colleagues when
he worked in the FBI's Chicago office.
   The settlement is a further admission by the FBI of racial
problems in its ranks.
   Officials earlier this year acknowledged that the FBI had
settled three other racial discrimination suits, including one
involving 30 employees of the fingerprint identification division.
   The FBI announced the settlement with Rochon on Wednesday but
declined to give details.
   Rochon, who has been on disability leave since April because of
emotional stress, will receive full compensation and full pension
benefits under the terms of the settlement, said his attorney,
David Kairys of Philadelphia.
   Rochon will remain on disability leave until he is eligible to
retire in 11 years, Kairys said. As a result of the emotional
strain, ``he never wants to go back to the FBI,'' the lawyer said.

<HEAD>Report: Navy Fleet Maintenance Costs Higher Than Projected</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The cost of maintaining and overhauling the
nation's naval fleet exceeded original estimates by about 30
percent with expenses rising to $3.7 billion over a three-year
period, congressional investigators say.
   The General Accounting Office, the watchdog agency of Congress,
found cost growth and schedule overruns at the eight public
shipyards and 44 private shipyards across the United States between
fiscal years 1985 and 1988.
   Public shipyards generally work on more sophisticated ships,
including submarines, carriers and nuclear-powered surface ships.
Private shipyards usually handle auxiliary and amphibious ships.
   The GAO blamed the problems at private shipyards on an inability
to determine beforehand what repair work must be done, unplanned
work added after the government contract has been awarded and
difficulty in obtaining materials.
   In the study, released the end of July, the GAO also found that
the market for ship maintenance and modernization is highly
competitive, forcing contractors to submit low bids to obtain Navy
work.
   Similar problems also existed at public shipyards, where the GAO
found that in some cases the companies did not have enough labor to
do the work properly.
   At the private shipyards, the GAO said that over a three-year
period, contract costs increased from $2.8 billion to $3.7 billion
with the final prices exceeding the contract award prices on 357 of
402 projects.

<HEAD>Americans Still Unable To Leave Iraq, Kuwait</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Despite pressure from the United States, Iraq
continues to deny permission for more than 3,500 Americans to leave
Iraq and Kuwait, the State Department said.
   Deputy spokesman Richard Boucher confirmed Thursday that a
10-year-old American girl, Penelope Nabokov, was allowed to leave
the Hotel Rashid in Baghdad and to enter the American Embassy,
   The girl had been flying unaccompanied from France to India when
she was taken into custody by Iraqi soldiers in Kuwait during a
stopover there at the time of the Iraqi invasion last week.
   But Boucher said Iraqi officials have refused exit visas to
Americans and other foreigners in the two countries. The United
States and several Western allies have made joint appeals to the
Iraqi government to let citizens of their respective countries
depart, he said.
   The administration has become increasingly concerned about
Americans in Iraq and Kuwait as military tensions between the
United States and Iraq have escalated.
   There are about 3,000 Americans in Kuwait. Boucher said Thursday
there were 580 Americans in Iraq.
   U.S. officials have focused their concern on 38 Americans at the
Hotel Rashid. Almost all were bused from Kuwait by Iraqi
authorities last week and are confined to the hotel under armed
guard. The State Department is refusing to call them hostages.
   Boucher said that 10 dependents and nonessential personnel from
t he American embassy in Baghdad departed the capital by road
Thursday and reached the Iraqi-Jordanian border.
   They were turned back by Iraqi officials at the border, but
subsequently the foreign ministry in Baghdad informed U.S.
officials that they will be permitted to cross, Boucher said.
   Although Boucher contended the borders in both Kuwait and Iraq
were closed, Jordanian officials said thousands of foreigners,
mainly Arabs, had fled Kuwait in recent days. They entered Saudi
Arabia and then crossed the border into Jordan 60 miles southeast
of Amman.
   The officials, insisting on anonymity, said most of the Arabs
arriving from Kuwait were Egyptian workers. After crossing into
Jordan they traveled to the Red Sea port of Aqaba to await
transportation to Egypt by sea, the officials said.

   Journalists are protesting to the Pentagon
that U.S. troops have arrived in Saudi Arabia, but no reporters
have been given access to cover the story.
   ``The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia controls its borders and decides
who enters that country, and that's not for us to tell the Saudis
who comes in,'' Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams told reporters at
a briefing Thursday.
   Williams said he was ``sensitive'' to such requests and said he
was attempting to get reporters on the U.S. Navy ships that have
been deployed to the region.
   Several reporters responded that they would prefer to be in
Saudi Arabia with U.S. troops, given that placement on a ship would
prevent them from covering any ground conflict, should such an
event occur.
   ``I think you all know that we want very much for this to work.
Obviously as we continue to commit forces to Saudi Arabia, that's
something we have to be mindful of,'' Williams said.
   ``It's a very sensitive subject ... Let me just say that we'll
try to get you out on the ships as soon as possible to continue to
work the rest of it.''
   Burl Osborne, president of the American Society of Newspaper
Editors and the president and editor of The Dallas Morning News,
has written Williams to protest the situation.
   ``We now have a situation in which an increasing number of
American troops are deployed in dangerous areas in the Middle East,
and the American press is not being given access to the U.S.
military forces,'' Osborne said.
   ``We urge that somehow _ either with the use of press pools or
by other means _ you take immediate action to insure that the
American press has access to the air, ground and naval forces in
the Middle East.''
   On Wednesday, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney was queried about
the same subject. He said the Saudis had established ``the ground
rules under which people have access to cover activities inside the
kingdom.''
   Cheney said the Pentagon would work on the problem. He didn't
make any promises and wasn't specific.
   In the invasion of Panama last December, the U.S. forces took
along a small group of reporters selected in advance by their
employers and pledged to keep their movement secret to protect the
security of the military operation.
   This ``pool'' arrangement was set up after the U.S. invasion of
Grenada, when journalists were kept away from the Caribbean island
entirely.
   Although there have been several tests of the Pentagon media
pool, it didn't work in Panama. Instead of being taken to the front
lines of battle as promised, the reporters were kept bottled up
away from the action.

<HEAD>Military Takes Part in Sweep of Marijuana Growing Area</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SHELTER COVE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>

   Army soldiers, National Guardsmen
and federal agents claimed to have destroyed more than 1,400
marijuana plants in a 12-day sweep that drew protests and a lawsuit
from residents and civil libertarians.
   The operation, which ended Thursday, was the first time that
active-duty soldiers have been used to fight marijuana growing in
the United States.
   About 50 agents from the Bureau of Land Management and the Drug
Enforcement Agency and an estimated 150 Guardsmen and soldiers from
Fort Ord took part in Operation Green Sweep, a raid on pot fields
in the King Range National Conservation Area. There were no arrests.
   The rugged, 60,000-acre area and its environs along California's
northwestern coast was settled in the early 1970s by hundreds of
hippies and homesteaders. Marijuana was widely planted on both
public and private land.
   On Thursday, six residents and several groups, including the
Civil Liberties Monitoring Project, filed a lawsuit in federal
court seeking to bar the use of soldiers to enforce drug laws. The
lawsuit also seeks $100 million in damages.
   The lawsuit alleges the troops engaged in illegal searches,
roadblocks, interrogations and detentions. The soldiers used
``excessive force to terrorize, intimidate and otherwise distress
residents,'' the lawsuit said.
   Roger Bruckner, BLM agent in charge, called the operation a
``fantastic success.'' He said 1,408 marijuana plants with a
potential street value of $4.2 million had been confiscated from 28
marijuana-growing sites and destroyed.
   The BLM said 12 tons of growing equipment, including pipes and
water storage tanks, was seized.
   ``What's important is that we've made the point that marijuana
growing will not be tolerated on BLM land,'' Bruckner said.
``Would-be growers will not only lose their crop and their labor,
but they'll also lose their investment in irrigation systems and
other agriculturl equipment.''
   The operation cost about $100,000 above normal expenses such as
salaries, said Art Lunklay, BLM state drug coordinator.
   Soon after the raid started, 11 demonstrators were arrested on
minor charges involving violation of government closure of some
areas. But Bruckner said such protests never attracted more than a
small percentage of the area's residents.
   Some residents called to voice their support, Bruckner said.
   ``I particularly want to thank the person who mailed us a
detailed and, as it turned out, surprisingly accurate map of one
area,'' he said.

   Marlon Brando commanded center stage
in his son's murder case, promising to post the $2 million bail and
declaring, ``My son is not a mad dog killer.''
   The usually reclusive 66-year-old actor stood on the courthouse
lawn and spoke with reporters for an hour, accusing ``the sleaze
bags'' of TV news and ``the carrion press'' of turning the case
into ``a circus ... some kind of animal show.''
   Bail for Christian Brando, 32, was reduced to $2 million from
$10 million Thursday. He has been in jail since the fatal shooting
on May 16 of Dag Drollet, the boyfriend of Brando's half-sister,
Cheyenne Brando.
   Brando said his offspring suffer unfairly because of his
celebrity. He admitted his son, an unemployed welder, has a history
of alcohol and drug abuse.
   But he said: ``My son isn't a mad dog killer and I hate to see
anyone portrayed that way. There is another Christian and I hope to
have the opportunity to present that.''
   Defense attorney Robert Shapiro was uncertain how long it would
take for Brando to post the bail, either by putting up the cash or
offering the deed to his $4 million home in the hills above
Bel-Air. The trial is set for Oct. 9.

<TEXT>
   The front-line Air Force general directing
U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia is a highly decorated Vietnam War
fighter pilot who blends toughness with a sense of humor, neighbors
say.
   Lt. Gen. Charles A. Horner, 53, was named Thursday to head
Desert Shield, the U.S. military effort to prevent further Iraqi
advances in the Persian Gulf.
   ``He's the forward commander. He's the one that's on the ground
and out in the boonies directing the show,'' said one Pentagon
officer.
   The three-star general, a native of Davenport, Iowa, has lived
here since 1987 with wife, Mary Jo. He commands the 9th Air Force
and the U.S. Central Command Air Forces at nearby Shaw Air Force
Base.
   Friends in Sumter, a city of 29,000 about 45 miles from
Columbia, are impressed with the man known as much for his quick
wit and love of golf as for his military exploits.
   ``He gives the appearance of a real tough guy, and he is tough.
But he also has a delightful sense of humor,'' said Phil Ballinger,
president of the Sumter County Chamber of Commerce. ``He could be a
professional comedian. He keeps people laughing, but when the time
comes, he's certainly a no-nonsense guy.''
   Horner is a pilot with more than 4,500 flying hours. He
regularly flies a variety of jets.
   During the Vietnam War, Horner tallied more than 100 combat
missions in F-105 fighter bombers. He was an instructor at the
Fighter Weapons School at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada and went
on to hold a number of positions in the Tactical Air Command at
Langley Air Force Base in Virginia.
   A graduate of the Armed Forces Staff College and the National
War College, he commanded units at Nellis, at Luke Air Force Base
in Arizona and at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico.
   In 1985, he was named deputy chief for plans at the Tactical Air
Command Headquarters. He assumed his present command in 1987.
   Horner's decorations include the Distinguished Service Medal,
the Silver Star with one oak leaf cluster, the Legion of Merit,
Distinguished Flying Cross, Meritorious Service Medal, Air Medal
and Air Force Commendation Medal.
   ``Gen. Horner is a down-to-earth professional, a superb general
officer who knows his stuff but genuinely cares about the people
under his command,'' said Rep. John Spratt, D-S.C.
   Mayor Steve Creech said Horner has about a 12-handicap but could
be a better golfer if he had more time.
   City officials work hard to maintain close ties with the base
and they say Horner is the best of neighbors. He joins in Chamber
of Commerce projects and meets frequently with community leaders.
   But right now, his neighbors are glad he's a tested fighting man.
   ``He's a very skilled and knowledgeable Air Force commander,''
Ballinger said. ``I'm glad he's on our side.''

   Iraq's chemical weapons might slow U.S. troops
down in the Middle East but are unlikely to claim many American
lives, arms experts say.
   Brad Roberts, a chemical-arms specialist at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said Iraq's
chemical weapons could not stop a U.S. naval blockade or defeat an
American defense of Saudi Arabia's oil fields.
   If ground warfare broke out between Iraq and the United States,
Iraq's President Saddam Hussein could use chemical weapons to
attack U.S. forces and to deny them access to certain terrain,
Roberts said.
   ``But to do it over an extended period of time, he would need a
lot of chemical agent,'' and it would have to be packaged in
artillery shells, bombs or missiles, and he would need the ability
to move the weapons into place quickly.
   ``Those three things are difficult, and it's not clear he can do
them,'' Roberts said.
   Iraq's use of chemical weapons against Iran led to ghastly
pictures of victims covered with severe blisters, but most of those
victims recovered, Iran has reported.
   As of April 1987, for example, Iran had reported 27,000 victims
but only 262 deaths, said Seth Carus, a fellow at the Naval War
College Foundation in Newport, R.I. Iraq has also used chemical
weapons against the Kurds, an ethnic minority in Iraq.
   John Deutch, provost of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology and a member of the Defense Science Board, said it's
likely the United States would dramatically escalate the conflict
if Hussein used chemical weapons against U.S. troops.
   ``I fear to speculate what the response would be by the U.S. or
its allies,'' he said.
   The threat of chemical weapons could reduce the effectiveness of
U.S. troops forced to wear protective suits and gas masks in the
fierce desert heat, the authorities said. But most said that
wouldn't give Iraq a very important tactical advantage.
   ``There is a popular misconception that you have to wear the
protection buttoned up all the time, and that's simply not true,''
said Matthew Meselson of Harvard University, who has been a
government consultant on chemical weapons. ``When the detectors
show there aren't chemicals around, you don't zip up.''
   Meselson said protective gear would make it seem 10 degrees
hotter than it really was. If the temperature is 100 degrees and
the humidity 50 percent, a soldier probably shouldn't carry a
90-pound pack for more than 40 minutes, he said. If he has to pull
on a suit over his uniform, that might be cut to 20 minutes.
   ``It would be an annoyance, but nothing to compare with the
incoming high explosives,'' Meselson said.
   Deutch disagreed. He argued that chemical weapons pose an
important military threat, although not a major threat to American
lives.
   Even a few badly aimed chemical weapons ``would cause every
ship, every military unit to conduct themselves in a more prudent
way and reduce their effectiveness,'' he said.
   Iraq has known stockpiles of at least 1,400 tons of mustard gas
and perhaps 200 pounds of the nerve gas tabun since it ended its
war with Iran in 1988, said Carus. Actual stockpiles could be
several thousand tons.
   Under ideal conditions, it takes 4 tons of airborne mustard gas
or 2 tons of airborne tabun to kill 50 percent of unprotected
people spread over about a third of a square mile, Carus said.
   If the people are wearing protection, the death rates are far
lower, he said. And much more gas is needed in the hot, dry
conditions of the Middle East, where gas evaporates much more
quickly, Carus said.
   Mustard gas and tabun work in entirely different ways, said
Gordon Burck, formerly director of studies on chemical and
biological warfare at the Federation of American Scientists in
Washington.
   Mustard gas is an odorless alcohol compound to which sulfur and
chlorine have been added. (Impurities in the first versions used in
World War I gave it the faint smell of mustard.) It causes severe
blistering but is rarely fatal.
   Tabun interferes with nerve-to-nerve communication. ``You can't
see, your stomach throws up, you go into convulsions,'' said Burck.
   But American soldiers carry injectors they can stab into their
thighs to give themselves a dose of atropine, a chemical that
counteracts the nerve gas. ``It doesn't leave you in top fighting
form, but it doesn't leave you dead,'' Burck said.

   Many of the estimated 6 million
foreigners living in the oil-rich Persian Gulf region are sending
their families away but sitting tight themselves through the Middle
East crisis.
   They face a dilemma: If they leave, they face losing the
lucrative jobs for which they left their homes. If they remain,
they may face the dangers of war.
   George Jacobs, an Indian working for Falcon, a video and camera
company with branches throughout the gulf area, said he sent his
wife and daughter home to India on Thursday.
   In Dubai, the United Arab Emirates, contingency plans for
employees at foreign companies have been drawn up, according to
executives who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``All the employees in our company have been told to pack their
bags and be ready to leave immediately if the situation worsens,''
said one executive in Dubai, located in the southern Persian Gulf.
   One Dubai executive estimated 10 percent of expatriates had
already left.
   There is more of a sense of urgency among the foreigners living
in Eastern Saudi Arabia, near where American forces were landing.
U.S. troops and Saudi forces face the Iraqis along Saudi Arabia's
northeastern border with Kuwait.
   Many fear not the gun and missile fire, but chemical weapons
reportedly being readied by Iraq in case of a confrontation.
   Eastern Dhahran is the Kingdom's oil center and houses the Saudi
Arabian Oil Co. complex, with 38,000 employees. Of the between up
to 28,000 Americans living in Saudi Arabia, the Eastern Province is
home to about 20,000.
   News that U.S. Embassies were advising Americans to leave and
that American, British and other foreigners were sending their
families to safer regions enhanced the tension and kicked off panic
buying of dollars.
   Black market rates of the dollar and British pound sterling
jumped, while banks reported heavy withdrawals of cash and
transfers abroad.
   At the immigration offices in Dammam and Al-Khubar, hundreds of
people lined up to get exit and re-entry visas, required under
Saudi law to leave and later return to the kingdom.
   At Saudi Aramco Co., nearly 6,000 foreign employees lined up
with their passports for visas. Similar lines were reported at many
multinational companies.
   One company reportedly gave its employees six months' paid leave
along with exit and re-entry permits to wait out the crisis, which
began when Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2 then started massing
troops along the Kuwait-Saudi border.
   In Tokyo, the Foreign Ministry today urged the about 1,600
Japanese living in Arab countries nations in the Persian Gulf
region to leave for safer ground.
   Saudis also were leaving for safer places such as Jiddah, Abha
and Riyadh. Those who could afford it were leaving the country.
   There are now mostly Indians, Pakistanis, Filipinos and
Bengalis, the poorer foreigners, on the streets of cities in
Eastern Saudi Arabia. Embassies for the Asian communities have
reacted differently to the crisis.
   The Indian Embassy in Riyadh has told its community to stay put.
   Those foreigners chosing to stay in the Eastern province, have
put away enough supplies for months and have suitcases packed and
ready for an emergency.

   Coming soon to a theater near you:
``Iraqnophobia.''
   The gathering military storm in the Middle East could bring a
downpour of films inspired by the crisis. It may also boost the
fortunes of films now in release or production.
   The co-writer of ``Team 6'' has been dispatched to Israel from
Los Angeles to update the script with references to the Persian
Gulf crisis.
   ``Navy SEALs,'' a new movie about Navy commandos in combat in
the Middle East, will be promoted with an advertising campaign this
weekend that will try to link the action title to last week's
invasion.
   Other companies _ including Walt Disney Co. with ``The
Ultimatum'' _ have films in development whose focus on Middle
Eastern terrorists will have sudden relevance.
   ``The movies are entertainment _ you go there fantasizing what
we wish we could do in Iraq,'' said actor Chuck Norris, whose 1986
film ``Delta Force'' was about a plane hijacked by Middle Eastern
terrorists.
   Norris said the sequel ``Delta Force III,'' starring his son
Mike, is also set in the Middle East and ``is closely related to
what's happening now.'' Norris and several film producers said they
expected an increase in the number of movies related to the area.
   ``Team 6,'' which will begin filming for 21st Century Film Corp.
on Sept. 24, was first a story about Navy SEALs attacking a missile
installation in a generic Middle Eastern country. After Iraq moved
into Kuwait, the story was changed: the Navy unit will now invade
Iraq to disable chemical-weapon missiles aimed at U.S. ships in the
gulf.
   ``History is writing the script for us,'' said Menahem Golan,
chairman of 21st Century. He said he hopes to have the film in
theaters by early 1991. ``I only hope I'm first.''
   He said the script changes should make the action-adventure film
more accessible. ``The drama is connected with real life and people
usually identify better with those situations,'' Golan said. The
cast, he said, includes Rob Lowe.
   ``Navy SEALs,'' which is playing to modest business in the
nation's theaters, could improve its fortunes at the box office
this weekend because the Middle East is so much in the news, the
film's producer said.
   ``As a filmmaker trying to make a buck, I'm embarrassed that we
got it so right,'' producer Brenda Feigen said. ``I can assure you
that the Navy SEALs are in the Middle East right now, although the
government won't confirm it.''
   Orion Pictures plans to introduce an ad campaign that will link
the film to the Middle East crisis without mentioning Iraq
specifically, said David Forbes, president of Orion's distribution
arm. He said box-office returns appear to be improving slightly.
   In ``The Ultimatum,'' being developed by Disney's Touchstone
Pictures, an American city will be destroyed by a nuclear bomb
planted by Middle Eastern terrorists if the American government
does not order all Jews out of Jerusalem.
   The script languished for three years until the Middle East
became a focus of world tensions this year.
   Hollywood has a history of predicting history. Weeks before the
release of 1979's ``The China Syndrome,'' a movie about a nuclear
meltdown, a reactor at Three Mile Island near Harrisburg, Pa., came
close to doing the same thing.
   In a memorable piece of dialogue, a nuclear expert in ``China
Syndrome'' told Jane Fonda's character that a meltdown could wipe
out an area the size of Pennsylvania.

   Some Iraqi soldiers in Kuwait beat up
residents and looted stores, while others were apologetic about
their country's invasion of its tiny oil-rich neighbor, travelers
reaching Bahrain said.
   Resistance to the invasion has dwindled but there are still
scattered demonstrations in support of the deposed Kuwaiti emir and
against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, the travelers said Thursday.
   In addition, Iraqis in Kuwait have staged demonstrations in
support of Saddam. An unspecified number of women with Iraqi
accents shouted pro-Saddam slogans, one traveler said.
   For the most part, however, an eerie silence prevails,
punctuated only by the sound of gunshots. Iraqi soldiers squat and
sleep on the pavements of the near-deserted streets, they said on
condition of anonymity.
   Kuwaiti businessman Mohsen al-Ajmi, 28, said he participated in
garbage clearing and maintenance operations to help out housewives
whose husbands were stranded outside Kuwait when Iraq invaded the
country on Aug. 2.
   Al-Ajmi said that at one point he and others participating in
the operations were stopped for questioning by Iraqi soldiers.
   ``They did not search us. In fact, they apologized and cursed
Saddam. One of them said `Why are we here? We have been hurting
Kuwaitis and drinking warm water in this heat, while Saddam sits in
his air-conditioned palace,''' al-Ajmi said.
   He said that as he was being questioned by the Iraqis, two
Egyptian workers passed by. The soldiers called to the men, asked
them to produce identity cards then said: ``Egyptians? You don't
deserve to live.''
   ``They beat the two Egyptians so savagely that we implored them
to stop,'' said al-Ajmi. ``They let the Egyptians go. They were
hurt quite badly.''
   In London, one traveler reported the rape by an Iraqi soldier of
a woman on a British Airways flight that was stranded in Kuwait by
the Iraqi invasion. Her nationality was not immediately clear.
   Jamal Alsane, managing director of the Regency Palace Hotel in
Kuwait City, said the woman was attacked on a bus as the passengers
and crew of Flight 149 were being transferred from one hotel to
another.
   Speaking at the Kuwaiti Embassy in London, he said a Lebanese
crew member pleaded with the soldier to show the woman mercy.
   ``The soldier took his gun and said, `One move and I blow you
up.' The other soldiers laughed, Alsane said.
   Travelers reaching Bahrain said Iraqi soldiers often knocked on
doors to ask for cold water, and sometimes food _ mainly beef and
fruit. But others said Iraqi soldiers forced Kuwaitis to provide
them with water and fruit.
   In the sweltering summer heat ``profusely sweating Iraqis
soldiers look tired and, I would say, ashamed of themselves,'' said
26-year-old Kuwaiti, Youssef al-Rashidi.
   ``A number of Iraqi soldiers came to us and tried to calm us
down, saying `we will do you no harm ... we have nothing against
you ... we only carry out orders,''' al-Rashidi said at the
Diplomat Hotel in Bahrain.
   But Al-Rashidi's four companions had different stories to tell.
   ``I saw Iraqi soldiers heap in lorries sacks of money and bits
of furniture stolen from the Gulf Bank,'' one of the four said on
condition of anonymity. He said his brother watched soldiers loot
two car showrooms in Kuwait.
   Another Kuwaiti said he saw Iraqi soldiers loot jewelry shops.
   ``I saw Iraqi soldiers armed with rifles stop uniformed Kuwaiti
soldiers, force them to remove the uniforms and then order them to
return home in their underwear,'' he said.
   The man said he took part in what he called ``minor resistance
operations,'' knocking down two Iraqi soldiers with a speeding car,
and distributing anti-Saddam leaflets.
   One shipping company executive said contacts in Kuwait told him
Thursday that more than 70 percent of Kuwaitis had left the
country. Those reports could not be confirmed independently.
   Kuwaitis are a minority in their country, comprising 27 percent
of the total 1.8 million population. The rest are Palestinian,
Egyptian, Iranian, Indian, Pakistani, American and other expatriate
workers.

   The market failed to sustain early gains on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange and share prices declined Friday, while the
dollar finished marginally higher.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues shed 286.18
points, or 1.04 percent, closing the week at 27,329.55. The index
lost 893.41 points on Thursday.
   The dollar closed at 149.75 yen, up 0.07 yen from Thursday's
close of 149.68 yen. After opening at 149.75 yen, the currency
ranged between 149.53 yen and 149.85 yen.
   Traders said the stock market started moderately higher, but
market players sold issues in the afternoon over gloomy prospects
in the Middle East.
   Toshiyuki Nishiguchi, a stock analyst with Daiwa Securities,
said though the market was beginning to recover from a recent
slump, ``As a whole (investors are) taking a wait-and-see position,
while watching the Middle East situation.''
   The Nikkei index, the market's main barometer, lost 4,348 points
between July 20 and Thursday's close because of increasing interest
rates in Japan and the Persian Gulf crisis, which began Aug. 2 when
Iraq invaded Kuwait.
   In currency dealings, the lack of significant news from the
Middle East also was why the dollar traded in a relatively narrow
range, exchange dealers said.
   ``It's very quiet,'' said Kozo Yoshida, a dealer with Mitsui
Taiyo Kobe Bank. ``At this time it is difficult to determine the
dollar's direction, unless there will be new developments in the
Middle East.''
   Other dealers said many market players Friday were waiting for
results of the emergency Arab summit in Cairo called in hopes of
resolving the Gulf crisis.
   The meeting, originally scheduled for Thursday, was postponed to
Friday because some Arab leaders had not arrived in time.

   A family of four who huddled on their kitchen floor during an

and came home to tell of their frightening journeys.
   Meanwhile, President Bush's decision to sent U.S. troops to the

country Thursday.
   Several Arab-American groups denounced the Iraqi invasion of
Kuwait but said they did not support the American military presence
in Saudi Arabia.
   In San Francisco, a noisy anti-war protest in front of Chevron
Corp. headquarters drew more than 50 people. Marchers held signs
with such messages as ``U.S. Out of the Gulf'' and ``No Vietnam in
the Mideast.''
   In Atlanta, 10 members of the Quakers' American Friends Service
Committee held a vigil to protest U.S. intervention.
   U.S.-based companies, including Texaco and the Boeing Co., on
Thursday arranged to evacuate some employees and dependents from
Saudi Arabia.
   ``There's no order back in Kuwait. Nobody goes to work, there's
no police, no services. We don't intend to go back there,'' said
Kimberly El-Zahr, 29. She, her husband, Camille, 33, and two young
children were with her parents in Portland, Ore., after escaping
Kuwait.
   On Aug. 2, when Mrs. El-Zahr heard Iraqi warplanes overhead, the
family stocked up on food and got what cash they could from the
bank.
   ``We lived right behind the crown prince's palace, like the vice
president's palace, and they started taking over that palace,'' she
said. ``It was a terrific bombing-shelling. Artillery rounds and
everything was going off.
   ``We ended up on the floor in the kitchen and we just huddled on
the floor until we could get through that.''
   The family spent three days at a friend's house, then left in a
three-car caravan for the Saudi border.
   ``Nobody stopped us,'' El-Zahr said. ``Nobody looked at us. I
guess we were lucky. There were soldiers and big machine guns and
we were scared.''
   Texan Benny Whitaker and his wife joined a convoy of his
co-workers who left the Hamad Al Hamad oil company for Saudi Arabia
on Aug. 3, one day after the invasion.
   The group was stopped twice by Iraqi soldiers during the
75-minute drive. The second time, ``I just acted like I didn't hear
him and kept going,'' said Whitaker, who returned Sunday to Abilene.
   Steve Betts, 35, of Houston, who formerly coached Kuwait's
national swimming squad, said his car stalled at a checkpoint
during his 85-mile drive to the Saudi border. An Iraqi soldier
allowed him to pass after being offered a soft drink.
   ``I had about six to eight Diet Pepsi's with me and I handed
them to him,'' Betts said in an interview from Washington. ``He had
fever blisters on his mouth and the Diet Pepsi _ well, that rang
his bell.''
   The estimated 3,400 Americans still in Kuwait and Iraq left many
loved ones in this country ignorant of their whereabouts and
condition. Thirty-eight Americans were still being held in a hotel
in Baghdad, Iraq, but were reported to be in good condition.
   Bush received high marks in the latest ``Pulse of America''
survey conducted in Lubbock County, Texas _ the president's adopted
sounding board for America.
   Sixty-four percent of 400 people surveyed Aug. 6-8 said they
would support Bush if he opted to use military force to push Iraq
out of Kuwait. Twenty-one percent did not support military use. The
survey, sent to Bush on Thursday, was conducted by Southwest
Research Associates and has a margin of error of 4 percentage
points.
   Arab-American groups were divided in their reaction to U.S.
military action.
   The Southern California American-Arab Anti-Discrimination
Committee opposed both Iraq's annexation and U.S. military
involvement. ``The best way is to leave it to the Arab states,''
said regional director Nacih Bayda.
   ``Our confidence is behind President Bush and the government of
the United States of America,'' the Detroit-based Chaldean
Federation of America said in a statement. Chaldeans are Christian
Arabs, mostly from Iraq.
   M.T. Mehdi, president of the American-Arab Relations Committee
and the National Council on Islamic Affairs, held a news conference
in New York City with about 30 other Arab leaders. He said about 60
percent were anti-Saddam, about 40 percent pro, but they
unanimously opposed the U.S. military deployment.
   ``We feel it will increase Arab and Muslim hostility to the U.S.
and only increase Saddam Hussein's prestige in the Arab world,''
Mehdi said. But he said most Arab-American leaders in the area
favor economic sanctions.

   The leading pro-PLO activist in the
Israeli-occupied lands has said Palestinians are angry about U.S.
military action in the Persian Gulf and accuses Washington of using
a ``double standard'' with the Arabs.
   ``Why ask only Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait, why not ask Israel
to withdraw from the West Bank?,'' the Baghdad-born Faisal Husseini
said Thursday. Israel has occupied the West Bank and the Gaza Strip
since the 1967 Middle East War.
   Husseini's comments underscored sympathy for Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein among the 1.7 million Palestinians in the occupied
lands. Saddam, whose army invaded Kuwait Aug. 2, has also received
the backing of Palestine Liberation Organization leader Yasser
Arafat.
   Only a few Palestinians expressed fears of being hurt themselves
if Iraq made good on threats to attack Israel with chemical weapons.
   Most Palestinians hail Saddam as a hero for flexing his muscles
against the world's superpowers at a time they are fighting a
seemingly hopeless battle against Israeli rule.
   In the 32-month uprising, 727 Palestinians were killed by
Israeli soldiers and civilians, and another 246 were slain as
suspected collaborators by fellow Arabs. Forty-seven Israelis have
also been slain.
   ``Israelis are behaving like thugs in this area and so now
Saddam is telling them, you are not the only ones who can control
things,'' said Ahmad Abu Salom, 39, a Palestinian actor in
Jerusalem.
   A local Palestinian faction sympathetic to Syria, called the
Popular Struggle Front and headed by Jerusalemite Samir Ghoshi,
published a leaflet Thursday comparing Saddam's actions to their
protests against Israel.
   ``The Arab masses and the children of the stones are now hoping
to see victory through you,'' said the leaflet. ``We express full
support and solidarity with Iraq in its revolutionary steps.''
   Husseini, 50, said Palestinian support for Iraq was largely a
sign of frustration.
   The United States has failed to exert effective pressure to
prevent Israel's heavy-handed policies against Palestinians, but
came swiftly to the defense of oil-rich Kuwait, he said.
   ``Okay, the United States sends forces to force Iraq to withdraw
from Kuwait. Very good. You are the police in the area. So why not
do the same thing with Israel?'' said Husseini.
   ``So what you are seeing is a reaction of anger at the United
States,'' he said.
   ``It is not that the Palestinians support the regime in Iraq or
believe in Saddam Hussein's ideology, but because they believe
there is a double standard in the area,'' Husseini said.
   Husseini spent a year of the uprising in jail without trial on
allegations of pro-PLO activism. Since his release in 1989 he has
emerged as a popular leader.
   His father, Abdel Kader Husseini, was a Palestinian war hero
killed leading fighters against the emerging state of Israel in
April 1948.
   Husseini said the PLO believes the Persian Gulf crisis ``must be
solved without letting foreign forces interfere ... we are strongly
against outside interference because it will complicate the
situation.''
   An opinion poll of Israeli Arab citizens in northern Galilee
also indicated strong support for Iraq.
   The poll, in which 208 people were questioned by telephone,
showed 62 percent supported Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and 69
percent considered Saddam a national hero. Fifteen percent felt he
was mad and irrational. No margin of error was given for the poll.
   Pro-Iraqi and anti-American sentiments were also prominent in
editorials run by Palestinian-owned newspapers published in Arab
east Jerusalem.
   ``It would be better for the Saudis to seek the opinions of the
sages before seeking help from enemies,'' wrote the pro-Jordanian
An Nahar daily.
   ``The language of escalation by the United States means dragging
the entire region into a brutal war,'' wrote the pro-PLO Al-Quds
newspaper.

   Seafood-rich Galveston Bay opened today to
shrimpers for the first time in eight days, but officials warned
against fishing in waters stained with residue from a
700,000-gallon oil spill.
   The Coast Guard said it hoped to fully open the Houston Ship
Channel, which courses through the bay, to all traffic today for
the first time since a tanker collided with two barges on July 28.
A sunken barge is obstructing the waterway.
   Texas Health Commissioner Robert Bernstein said bay shrimping
could resume today. But he cautioned shrimpers and consumers to
beware of fish with visible oil, or fish caught in oily water.
   Bernstein shut down the bay to all fishing on Aug. 2 because of
a 17-mile slick. Two days later, he reopened the bay to fin fishing
and allowed seafood harvesting in some areas.
   Shrimpers said the ban cost them thousands of dollars a day. A
ban also was lifted today on the taking of crabs and oysters.
   ``This is clearly good news for the men and women who rely on
the bay for their livelihoods,'' Gov. Bill Clements said.
   The spill occurred when a Greek tanker collided with two barges
under tow. One barge sank and the other ruptured, spilling heavy
oil that threatened sensitive marshes, birds and other wildlife.
   Coast Guard spokesman Rick McCullor said salvage crews were
expected to end the cleanup today and reopen the channel to all
traffic. Crews used cutting torches to take apart the sunken barge
and removed half on Thursday, leaving the other half for today.
   Divers had pugt a sling around one end of the barge last week
and crews moved the vessel into shallow water beside the shipping
channel, where it limited traffic to one-way, tug-assisted ships
and two-way, slow-moving barges.
   The Coast Guard said that the cleanup has cost more than $1
million and that the total might be about $3 million.
   ``Almost all the visible oil has been recovered,'' McCullor said.

<HEAD>Surprising Link Found Between Elephant Man's Disease and Cancer</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists may have accomplished far more than
they thought when they found the gene for Elephant Man's disease.
The gene, it turns out, appears to be a switch that can turn on
cancer, researchers reported today.
   ``The payoff here is going to be that we may come up with a
treatment for brain tumors,'' said Dr. Allan Rubenstein, medical
director of the National Neurofibromatosis Foundation in New York.
Neurofibromatosis is Elephant Man's disease.
   The surprising discovery could bring about an explosion of
research toward a treatment for neurofibromatosis _ a disfiguring
disease that ``a couple of years ago was an obscure phenomenon
which practically the whole scientific world ignored,'' Rubenstein
said.
   That research also holds promise for many people with cancer,
though scientists cautioned that treatments may be years away.
   ``It's the kind of understanding we hoped discovery of the gene
would lead to,'' said the author of the new finding, Raymond L.
White of the University of Utah. ``I expect it to make a
fundamental contribution to our understanding of cancer genetics.''
   White's findings appeared today in the scientific journal Cell.
   The report concludes that the neurofibromatosis gene is one of
the family of GAP genes that may operate as anti-cancer genes.
   That is, when the genes are normal, they keep cancer growth
switched off. When they are defective, they allow cancer tumors to
grow. These so-called tumor-suppressor genes have been found to be
among the causes of lung cancer, breast cancer and colon cancer.
   White said his findings suggest that neurofibromatosis tumors,
which are not cancerous, may be an intermediate stage between
normal tissue and cancer.
   Similar discoveries have been made in colon cancer, where White
and other researchers have shown that benign polyps have some, but
not all, of the genetic changes required to form colon cancer.
   Neurofibromatosis afflicts 100,000 Americans. Symptoms can
include learning disabilities and crippling, non-cancerous tumors
all over their bodies. Until now, researchers have had no clue to
its cause.
   A month ago, White and Francis Collins of the University of
Michigan reported that they had independently discovered the
neurofibromatosis gene.
   That opened the door to further studies to determine precisely
what goes wrong in neurofibromatosis and how it might be fixed. The
latest findings are an important step in that direction,
researchers said.
   ``The potential to start to design therapies is now a couple of
years closer than it could have been otherwise,'' Collins said.
   ``I don't want to raise false hopes, but the implication is it
might be possible to treat some forms of NF,'' said Michael Wigler
of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York.
   The GAP genes are known to switch off certain cancer genes
called ras genes, which have long been known to contribute to the
formation of cancer tumors, said Wigler.
   White said he made his discovery by determing the DNA sequence,
or genetic code, of part of the neurofibromatosis gene. He then
compared it to known sequences stored in a computer, and ``the GAP
genes popped out as clearly as could be.''
   It is not yet proven that the neurofibromatosis gene acts like a
GAP gene, but researchers believe it does because its sequence is
so closely related to the GAP genes, White said.

<HEAD>Atlanta Study Finds One in Four Assaults in Family, Intimate
Setting</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A study of violence in Atlanta found that one in
four assaults takes place in a family or intimate relationship,
with most of the assailants men and most of the victims women.
   The findings, reported Thursday by the national Centers for
Disease Control, were based on 1984 police reports, the latest
available at the time the survey was begun.
   Police reported 27 fatal family or intimate assaults for the
year, and 3,295 non-fatal ones, said Dr. Linda Saltzman, a
behavioral scientist with the CDC.
   Incident reports were taken from a broad range of police
categories, including assault, robbery, rape and disorderly
conduct. Overall, 14 percent of reports in those categories were in
families or intimate relationships, and about 25 percent of the
assaults were in such situations, Saltzman said.
   Analysis of 177 assaults found that 52 percent of the fatality
victims and 73 percent of the non-fatality victims were women; 74
percent of the fatal assaults and 80 percent of the non-fatal ones
were committed by men.
   Twenty percent or more of the Atlanta incidents studied involved
broken relationships, and between 26 percent and 37 percent of the
parties involved had been reported to the police in similar
assaults before, the CDC said.
   ``Violence between persons who are related, share a household or
are otherwise intimate with each other is a widespread public
health problem,'' the CDC concluded. ``In particular, intimate
violence is a leading cause of injuries to women.''
   The CDC noted a 1986 survey concluding that battering was
responsible for more injuries to women than car crashes, rape and
mugging combined.

<TEXT>
   A college student with leukemia whose search for
a compatible bone-marrow donor drew celebrity support and 50,000
volunteers underwent a last-ditch transplant using her mother's
marrow.
   Allison Atlas, 20, opted for the surgery Thursday although her
mother's tissue is not a perfect match. She said she wanted to try
the life-saving procedure while she was still relatively strong.
   Her condition today at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center
was withheld at the family's request, said hospital spokeswoman
Alice Burgess. The transplant team was headed Dr. Edward Agura.
   The marrow from her 54-year-old mother, Arline Atlas, matched
only four of six antigens, or cell identifiers, from her daughter's
marrow. The operation could work if Miss Atlas' body does not
reject her mother's tissue.
   ``They're both fighters,'' said Sy Atlas, a cousin. ``They're
both people who are determined to beat the odds. Arline was excited
to be the donor for her daughter.''
   Miss Atlas, a student at New York University when she became ill
last year, heightened awareness of the need for bone-marrow donors
with a publicity campaign that drew 50,000 volunteers in the United
States and Israel.
   Supporters raised $3 million, including a six-figure check from
actor Dustin Hoffman, to process the 50,000 blood tests. No match
was found for Miss Atlas, but 10 other leukemia patients were
matched with donors.
   Bone marrow provides necessary components of the human immune
system, and transplant patients are at high risk of infection for
three weeks after the operation until the new marrow begins to work.
   Miss Atlas, of Bethesda, Md., will recuperate in a sterile
environment at the cancer center, where more than 3,000 bone-marrow
transplants have been performed, more than any other clinic.
   Anatoly Grishchenko, a leukemia-stricken Soviet helicopter pilot
who flew firefighting missions over the damaged Chernobyl nuclear
reactor, underwent a bone marrow transplant at the center earlier
this year.
   He died July 3 of complications of a lung infection that took
hold during the period when he had no natural defenses.
   In leukemia, a form of blood cancer, white blood cells multiply
out of control. Since bone marrow produces blood, doctors can
combat leukemia by replacing the diseased marrow with healthy
tissue.
   Before the operation, Miss Atlas reassured her mother with humor
and encouraged family members.
   ``She was really cool,'' Sy Atlas said in a TV interview from
Washington, D.C. ``Last night, talking with her mom, she jokingly
said ... `Mom, your marrow better be good for me tomorrow.'''
   ``She's really positive. With that kind of attitude, we're
confident she's going to do well.''

   Continuing pessimism over the Middle East sent
shares on the Tokyo Stock Exchange down further today, traders
said. The dollar gained marginally against the Japanese yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 286.18 points, or 1.04
percent, closing the week at 27,329.55. It was the Nikkei's lowest
closing level since Oct. 24, 1988, when it ended trading at
27,281.54.
   A total of 320 million shares changed hands, down from the
previous day's 380 million shares. On Thursday, the Nikkei plunged
893.41 points.
   Traders said the stock market opened moderately higher, but
market players then dumped issues because of pessimism over the
situation in the Middle East.
   Akira Shimoda, an equity analyst with Yamaichi Securities, said
there had no news about major new developments in the Middle East
today, but ``the situation there is hazy, resulting in a negative
psychological impact on investors.''
   The Nikkei index gained nearly 300 points in the morning, but
later suffered from sporadic arbitrage selling to take advantage of
price gaps between the spot and futures markets, he said.
   Among losers were chemical, drug, shipbuilding and trading
company issues.
   The Nikkei index has lost a total of 4,634.19 points since July
20 because of rising interest rates in Japan and the Persian Gulf
crisis, which began last Thursday when Iraq invaded Kuwait.
   In currency dealings, the dollar finished the week at 149.75
yen, up 0.07 yen from Thursday's close of 149.68 yen. It opened at
149.75 yen and ranged between 149.53 yen and 149.85 yen.
   ``It's very quiet with only a small number of calls and
customers,'' said Megumi Morita, a dealer with Sanwa Bank.
   Ms. Morita said many market players conducted position
adjustments in the absence of fresh incentives, including fresh
news from the Middle East.
   Meanwhile, oil prices remained steady in Tokyo throughout the
day, said a trader with a major Japanese trading company.
   North Sea Brent crude oil for October delivery was trading at
$23.70 a barrel, unchanged from Thursday's close.
   In bond dealings, the yield of benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds closed at 7.995 percent, up from
Thursday's 7.985 percent. Their price slipped to 83.47 points from
83.52 points.

<TEXT>
   An anti-drug program born of the AIDS crisis
recorded success rates ranging from 47 percent in Miami to 16
percent in Chicago in getting intravenous drug users to kick the
habit, officials say.
   The program, begun in 1987 in 41 communities by the National
Institute on Drug Abuse, was aimed at studying and changing the
behavior of intravenous drug users and their sex partners.
   More than 30,000 people who were not then in drug abuse programs
enrolled, and follow-up interviews in five cities found from 16
percent to 47 percent stopped all use of IV drugs, the Centers for
Disease Control said Thursday.
   ``If the results at other sites prove to be consistent,'' it
would provide ``strong evidence of the considerable impact this
approach could have,'' the agency said.
   AIDS is transmitted chiefly through sexual contact, contaminated
blood and sharing of contaminated needles.
   More than 38,000 of the 139,000 AIDS cases reported in this
country have occurred in IV drug users. An additional 3,000
involved sex with IV drug users, and 1,400 were children born to IV
drug users or their sexual partners.
   The National Institute on Drug Abuse project contacted IV drug
abusers through community workers, many of whom were former
addicts. Drug users were paid for participating in the program.
   Results were reported from Chicago, Houston, Miami, Philadelphia
and San Francisco. Between 45 percent and 78 percent of the
participants came back for the follow-up interviews.
   Success rates in getting addicts off drugs included 17 percent
in San Francisco, 26 percent in Philadelphia and 32 percent in
Houston.
   In Chicago the percentage of participants not sharing needles
with friends rose from 18 percent to 47 percent. In Houston, it
went from 47 percent to 88 percent six months later.

   Grape stompers can cast off their shoes and
squish for charity at Stone Hill Winery.
   For the 13th year, the winery is sponsoring a Grape Stomp on
Saturday to raise money for a workshop for the disabled, and
hundreds of contestants were expected to have a go. Last year, the
event raised $1,900.
   Contestants paying a $3 entry fee get 30 pounds of red grapes
and two minutes to show their stomping style, said Betty Held,
co-owner of the 143-year-old winery.
   ``They will be stomping to the music of Otto's Polka Band from
St. Louis,'' she said Thursday. ``The judges will grade them 80
percent on the amount of juice the stomping produces and 20 percent
on their style.''
   Age groups for contestants range from pre-teen to over 55. The
best stompers will get prizes, and all contestants may keep the
juice from their efforts.
   Hermann is on the Missouri River about 60 miles west of St.
Louis.

   The dollar was higher against all other major
foreign currencies in early European trading today amidst
continuing concern over the Middle East crisis.
   Gold prices were higher.
   Traders said they expected the dollar to continue gaining ahead
of an Arab League meeting in Cairo today and on reports of further
Iraqi troop movements toward Kuwait and toward the border with
Turkey.
   ``The market is reserved,'' said a trader at a major West German
bank in Frankfurt. ``The (Middle East) situation looks like it can

   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.07 yen to a closing 149.75 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at a higher rate of 150.10 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Thursday:
   _1.5974 West German marks, up from 1.5915
   _1.3455 Swiss francs, up from 1.3385
   _5.3607 French francs, up from 5.3340

   _1,170.50 Italian lire, up from 1,164.75
   _1.1473 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1467
   In London, the dollar rose against the British pound, and was
quoted at $1.8690, compared with $1.8720 late Thursday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $387.00 a troy ounce, up
from $385.25 bid late Thursday. At midmorning, the city's major
bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $388.75. In Zurich,
the bid price was $388.75, up from $385 late Thursday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $3.84 to close at a bid

   Showers and thunderstorms were scattered over the East and South
early today and rain also fell in the Northwest. Skies were mostly
clear elsewhere.
   A low pressure system was expected to bring another day of rain
to the East today with showers extending from the Carolinas to
Maine and some thunderstorms in Florida.
   Sunny skies were forecast for the South and most of the Midwest,
but heavy rain was developing in a narrow band from eastern Montana
to central Nebraska. Thunderstorms were expected in Oregon, Idaho,
Nevada and northern California.
   Scorching summer heat was again predicted for the Southwest,
with temperatures in the 100s and even the 110s in southern Arizona.
   Elsewhere, temperatures were expected to be in the 90s in the
South, the 80s in the East and Midwest and the 70s in the central
northern region and West Coast.
   The high temperature for the nation Thursday was 121 degrees at
Death Valley, Calif.

<HEAD>AIDS Couple Guilty of Marijuana Possession, Medical Necessity
Defense Denied</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   An AIDS-stricken couple who say they
smoked marijuana to relieve painful side-effects from their AIDS
treatments were found guilty by a judge who rejected their medical
necessity defense.
   But justice was tempered with mercy as Circuit Judge Clinton
Foster on Thursday sentenced Kenneth and Barbara Jenks to a year's
probation and 500 hours of community service _ to be completed by
caring for each other.
   ``The events of this case are horrifying, and evoke sympathy and
compassion for the defendants by all persons acquainted with the
facts,'' Foster said after a non-jury trial. ``There is no cure for
this disease.''
   The husband and wife were convicted of cultivating and
possessing marijuana.
   Jenks, 28, is a hemophiliac who contracted AIDS through a
tainted blood transfusion. He passed the disease to his 24-year-old
wife before he was aware he was infected.
   ``I've never had that sweet a sentence in my 20 years of
practicing law,'' said attorney John Daniel, who represented the
couple for free. Nevertheless, he filed notice of appeal, an effort
he hopes will reverse Foster's rejection of the medical necessity
defense.
   The couple said they smoked marijuana especially to relieve
intense nausea and vomiting caused by the anti-AIDS drug AZT.
   ``When I started taking AZT, I lost all reason to eat,'' Jenks
has said. He and his wife declined to say whether they will
continue smoking marijuana.
   Foster noted the medical necessity defense has been approved by
some courts around the nation, including a judge in Fort Lauderdale
who authorized it for another disease.
   But he concluded it should not be recognized across the board
unless the state Legislature gives ``statutory authorization
addressing the scope and parameters of that defense.''
   The Jenkses have applied to take part in a federal program
allowing the use of marijuana for medicinal purposes. They said
neither they nor their doctor knew about the program before they
were arrested March 29.
   Marijuana has been used to treat the nausea that accompanies
cancer chemotherapy, as well as to treat glaucoma and multiple
sclerosis.

<HEAD>Canadian Army To Stay Put for Now in Mohawk Dispute</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The army won't enter the armed standoff between
the Mohawk Indians and Quebec police unless a federally appointed
mediator asks them to intervene, an army commander said.
   Also Thursday, the Mohawks warned that any military presence at
barricades they have erected between themselves and provincial
police might jeopardize a settlement of the conflict.
   The standoff began a month ago when the Mohawks occupied what
they claimed to be sacred land that was earmarked for a golf course
expansion.
   ``A build-up of military force at the Kahnawake reserve will be
regarded by the Mohawk people as something akin to gunboat
diplomacy,'' said Owen Young, legal advisor to the Mohawks.
   The army's role in the conflict will depend on the efforts of
mediator Alan B. Gold, chief justice of the Quebec Superior Court,
to bring both sides to the mediating table, said Armed forces
spokesman Lt. Gen. Kent Foster Thursday.
   ``If Chief Justice Gold finds in his discussions that there is a
role for us to play ... we would do our best to react to that,''
Foster said. ``Clearly we are going to continue to get ready to put
our forces in place and so on for that eventuality.''
   He said the earliest the soldiers could be ready to move is
Saturday.
   The soldiers would move toward Montreal from Canadian Forces
Base Valcartier, just outside of Quebec City, and then into
position in the town of Oka and outside the Kahnawake reserve. At
Valcartier 4,400 troops and 1,400 vehicles are available, Foster
said.
   A land dispute led to a July 11 gunbattle between Mohawks and
Quebec police at Oka, 18 miles west of Montreal, and the two sides
have faced each other across barricades since then.
   An officer was shot to death in the clash that began when police
tried to storm a barricade put up by the Mohawks. Responsibility in
the death has not been established.
   Earlier this week, Premier Robert Bourassa asked the federal
government for authorization to bring in the army. Prime Minister
Brian Mulroney said Wednesday the military would be at the
province's disposal to help police.
   Bourassa said in Quebec City that Gold started work Thursday,
talking with provincial government officials and the Mohawks.
   Also Thursday, Quebec announced that the provincial government
will build a section of highway to bypass the Mercier Bridge into
Montreal, blocked for nearly a month now by Mohawks as part of the
dispute.
   Quebec's public security minister, Sam Elkas, said two lanes of
the road will be built this year at a cost of $8.5 million (U.S.)
and it will be broadened next year.
   The road will allow residents of suburbs on the South Shore of
the St. Lawrence River to bypass the blocked bridge and get to
Montreal by way of other bridges.

<TEXT>
   Neighboring West African countries were
assembling troops to halt a 7-month-old civil war between rebels
and the government of President Samuel Doe.
   A Doe spokesman accused U.S. Marines of shooting at the leader
Thursday, but the State Department in Washington denied it.
   A close advisor to the president was hospitalized with chest and
neck wounds after the attack in which the Marines allegedly shot at
Doe from a helicopter, said Selly Thompson, a spokesman for Doe. He
spoke in an interview with the British Broadcasting Corp.
   In Rome, A U.N. agency said it would send $16 million in
emergency food aid to help feed about 400,000 people uprooted by
Liberia's war. The food will be shipped to Liberia and the
neighboring Ivory Coast, Guinea and Sierra Leone, where tens of
thousands of Liberians have taken refuge.
   The shipment includes more than 21,000 tons of rice, 1,200 tons
of oil and 1,700 tons of canned meat and fish, the Rome-based World
Food Program said.
   West African peacekeeping troops massed across Liberia's
northern border in Guinea and to the east on the Sierra Leone
border, according to military sources in Ghana and Sierra Leone.
There were reports 500 troops might be airlifted into Monrovia.
   Rebels battled Doe's troops within a mile of his executive
mansion Thursday in a bid to take Monrovia before a five-nation
African task force, dominated by Nigerian soldiers, arrives to
impose a cease-fire in the war-ravaged nation.
   At least 5,000 people have died in the war, which began in
December when rebels invaded from the Ivory Coast seeking to depose
Doe, whom they accuse of corruption and mismanagement.
   The war has become a tribal conflict, pitting people loyal to
the rebels against those loyal to Doe's government.
   On Wednesday night, rebels loyal to former bureaucrat Charles
Taylor pushed into eastern Congo Town _ an eastern suburb of
Monrovia _ where they ransacked the Nigerian Embassy and attacked
the Guinea Embassy.
   They forced thousands of people seeking refuge at the Nigerian
Embassy _ mostly Nigerians _ into streets where battles raged. It
was not clear whether anyone was injured, said a relief worker in
Congo Town.
   Nigerian Foreign Minister Rilwanu Lukman said in Lagos that his
government told Taylor ``that we will hold him personally
responsible for any harm done to Nigerians inside the embassy at
the time of the attack.''
   In Bonn, a Foreign Ministry spokesman said 300 people from the
Nigerian Embassy sought refuge at the West German mission. He said
that swelled the total at the mission to 500 refugees, including
Americans, Belgians, French, Dutch, Irish, Liberians and Filipinos.
   It was not clear what happened at the Guinea Embassy, which gave
sanctuary to 5,000 people from the Mandingo tribe seeking safety
from the rebels who have killed thousands, accusing them of backing
Doe's regime.
   Guinea Radio called the attack on its embassy a ``provocation''
and said three guards were taken hostage by rebels. In Abidjan,
sources were quoted as saying one woman was killed in the attack on
the Guinean Embassy.
   Doe spokesman Thompson said former Justice Minister Isaac Nyaplu
was wounded in the assassination attempt against Doe and appealed
for the international community to pressure the United States to
``excessive harassment to remove Doe.''
   But State Department deputy spokesman Richard Boucher said the
235 Marines airlifted into Monrovia Sunday to evacuate Americans
were there to protect the embassy and Americans and not to
intervene in the fighting or take sides.
   Boucher said the United States has evacuated 150 people from
Liberia this week, including the French and Italian ambassadors.
   The West Africans moving into Liberia say they will enforce a
cease-fire to allow formation of an interim government charged with
organizing free and fair elections within a year.
   Doe and Johnson have welcomed the West African initiative, but
Taylor is opposed. He fears Nigerian participation because Nigerian
President Gen. Ibrahim Babangida has been an ally of Doe.

   Students of Thomas Jefferson College got
credit for some unusual activities _ carving Indian flutes,
painting portraits of comic-book characters and observing the
antics of roving bands of mongrel dogs.
   About 250 graduates, former faculty and administrators will
gather this weekend for a weekend reunion marking the closure of
the college 10 years ago.
   ``I felt that we were on the cutting edge of something really
exciting,'' said T. Dan Gilmore, who guided the college through
two-thirds of its 12 years in existence. ``There was almost a
feeling of a new-age mentality.''
   The college, a subdivision of Grand Valley State University in
Allendale, had as many as 600 students in the mid-1970s. It allowed
students to design their own classes and experiment with learning.
   The college was born out of the freewheeling 1960s, when
alternative higher education programs sprouted nationwide.
   The experimental approach drew criticism from some who thought
credit was given too easily for such pursuits like wilderness
backpacking.
   Many graduates said some of their best years were spent at
there, and defended the learning experience there.
   ``TJC taught me how to learn, how to adapt to a changing
world,'' said Mark Miller, who spent part of his academic career
following the movements of a roving band of mongrel dogs on the
inner-city streets of Grand Rapids.
   Miller said he later put his knowledge of urban animal behavior
to good use as director of an animal shelter.
   Susan Haskins, who traipsed the shores of Lake Michigan in
search of new rock forms, now works for the federal government as a
geologist.
   ``The college gave me the freedom to chart my own course,'' she
said. ``It encouraged my independence. TJC did fine by me.''
   Dan Anderson, a Grand Valley physics professor, said teaching at
the college ``was the mountaintop of my career.''
   The school's alumni include doctors, dancers, mental health
workers, teachers and business owners.
   Jeff Brown, who received credits for helping transform a shoe
store into a theater, now owns a nut shop in Kalamazoo.
   ``TJC was almost like a schoolwide encounter group,'' he said.
``It was magic.''

   Tropical Storm Edouard hovered just north of the
Azores today and forecasters expected it to lose strength on its
slow-moving northeastward drift past the mid-Atlantic Portuguese
archipelago.
   At 6 a.m. EDT today, Edouard's center was located about 95 miles
northeast of the island of Terceira, according to the National
Hurricane Center in suburban Coral Gables.
   The storm had maximum sustained winds near 40 mph, and was
heading east northeast at 6 mph.
   ``This system hasn't got much rain in it, and it'll probably
drop below tropical storm strength today,'' said Miles Lawrence,
hurricane specialist at the center.
   Hurricane Diana killed at least 38 people and injured 80 as it
battered the Mexican states of Veracruz and Hidalgo this week,
relief officials said. Eleven people were reported missing.

<TEXT>
   Journalists allowed into parts of Adolf
Hitler's underground concrete bunker have seen a half-dozen dark
rooms that some day may be turned into an exhibition.
   In a tour Thursday, journalists saw rooms at the edge of the
once-bustling Potsdamer Platz in East Berlin that historians
believe were dining facilities for the Nazi dictator's bodyguards.
   There were doors marked ``toilet'' and ``shower.'' A rusting
steel door led to the ``Reichsrundfunk,'' or government radio
station, which Hitler used to broadcast propaganda messages to the
German people during World War II.
   The only objects left in the rooms, which lie under a small hill
visible to the passersby, were a blown-up safe and what appeared a
water tank. There were pools of water on the floor.
   Other parts of the bunker were opened up earlier. The Soviets
blew up still other parts at the end of the war.
   The underground bunker is off limits to the public and East
Berlin officials are faced with the issue of what to do with the
labyrinth.
   East Berlin city councilor Thomas Krueger said Thursday the
bunker rooms may one day become a ``historic exhibition,'' but
cautioned, ``there is still no clear plan.''
   German officials fear that keeping the rooms intact would
attract neo-Nazis, but they have made a commitment to turning
relics of the Third Reich into stark memorials to prevent a return
of fascism.
   Vandals occasionally have slipped into the bunker in the past,
sometimes leaving pro-Nazi slogans written on the walls.
   The rooms opened up for viewing on Thursday do not include the
one where Hitler and Eva Braun, his longtime mistress and wife of
one day, committed suicide on April 30, 1945.

   A 17-year-old was charged with
manslaughter today for allegedly pulling two friends into the
raging rapids of the Niagara River, police said.
   A search for the girls, presumed drowned, resumed at daybreak.
   The youth, Rudolph Rogler of Niagara Falls, pulled the girls off
a rock they'd clung to Thursday evening after earlier escaping the
turbulent water, said officer Kenneth Lewis of the New York State
Parks police. He was charged with two counts of second-degree
manslaughter.
   Lewis said Jessica Currie, 14, and Shelly Pembleton, 17, were
among a group of friends smoking marijuana and drinking beer in
Whirlpool State Park Thursday evening.
   The girls, both of Niagara Falls, went swimming in a forbidden
section of the gorge and got caught in the current, but managed to
swim ashore and clung to a rock, he said.
   ``They made it back to shore the first time. Then this
individual came along and pulled both of them off the rock'' as a
prank, Lewis said. ``If he hadn't touched the two females, they
would have both been still alive.''

<HEAD>Army Patrols Restore Order in Town After 33 Die In Unrest</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Heavily armed soldiers in
armored cars and police riot squads were restoring order today in
Port Elizabeth after at least 33 people were killed in four days of
rioting and looting.
   Police commanders said they were regaining control of colored,
or mixed race, townships around the city on the south-east coast.
Scores of South African army soldiers backed by armored units and
helicopters aided police.
   Police Lt. Gen. Mulder van Eyck said today that security forces
were in control of much of the area. ``The police and the army are
now involved. We are patrolling the areas,'' he told reporters.
   According to police, 33 people were killed in the fighting. Some
had been killed by police gunfire, but there was no breakdown on
how many, police said.
   Authorities said that about 160 people had been arrested for
looting, arson and other offenses.
   Telephone, trash collection, mail and all other public services
were still cut off in the riot-hit areas. Municipal employees had
been targeted for attack and they, along with most other residents,
stayed home to protect their houses.
   The government had appealed to Port Elizabeth residents to stop
the unrest.
   Van Eyck said residents told him the unrest was caused by the
``high rental of homes, the lack of proper water supply, lack of
facilities and the inadequate schools.''
   The riots in the northern Port Elizabeth suburbs of Bloemendal,
Arcadia, Chatty Windvogel and Hillside began on Monday in a clash
between members of a political group and police.
   But police and political organizations in the city said criminal
gangs and roving mobs of looters took advantage of the unrest and
were responsible for much of the violence and looting.
   The local Northern Areas Action Committee and the affiliated
African National Congress did not appear to have any control over
the hundreds of rioters who stormed through the streets, throwing
rocks and gasoline bombs.
   Police repeatedly opened fire with shotguns and pistols to
disperse the mobs. Businessmen also reportedly fired at looters
before fleeing with their families.
   The car manufacturing plants which employ a large percentage of
Port Elizabeth-area blacks remained at a standstill today. Public
transport was not running in most areas.
   Shops, factories, schools, a church, police and private vehicles
were burned, said the Port Elizabeth police spokesman, Maj. Bill
Dennis.

<HEAD>Saudi Oil: Lifeblood of World Economy</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: SUBS graf 11, So far..., to CORRECT U.S. imports from Saudi
Arabia to more 1.2 million barrels a day</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By CHARLES CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The vital interest America sees in Saudi
Arabia is no mystery: it's the oil. The desert kingdom sits on a
sea of crude whose flow is crucial for running the engines of the
modern global economy.
   Saudi Arabia is the world's biggest oil exporter, and its 255
billion barrels of proven reserves give it 25 percent of the
world's total.
   ``The sovereign independence of Saudi Arabia is of vital
interest to the United States,'' President Bush said in dispatching
American troops to face off with menacing Iraq.
   Experts agree that if Saudi oil fell to conquest, destruction or
intimidation, the consequences would be devastating.
   ``The word unthinkable is correct,'' said John Lichtblau,
chairman of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation. ``If Saudi
Arabia were out, 7 millionbarrels a day would be lost. You couldn't
close the gap with prices. You'd have to have worldwide rationing
and shortages.''
   It gets worse. Any set of events that blocks Saudi oil would
presumably cut supplies from other Persian Gulf oil exporters as
well _ certainly Abu Dhabi and maybe Iran. Who knows what would
happen next?
   ``It would be a major international conflict,'' Lichtblau said.
``Oil would no longer be the only consideration.''
   But the oil shortage would certainly be a major consideration,
if only because petroleum is so essential to the modern way of life.
   Gasoline, of course, powers nearly all the 180 million cars,
trucks and buses on America's roads. Many people use oil or
liquefied petroleum gas to heat their homes, and power companies
consume 730,000 barrels a day generating electricity.
   Besides, petroleum products and derivatives are used in items as
diverse as detergents, plastics, fertilizers, drugs, paint,
cosmetics and clothing.
   So far this year, Saudi Arabia has exported more than 1.2
million barrels of oil a day to the United States, covering about
7.5 percent of the nation's consumption. A barrel contains 42
gallons.
   The Saudis have been pumping 5.3 million barrels a day recently,
nearly 10 percent of what is consumed worldwide, excluding the
Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, which is how the figures are still
compiled.
   Many people believe the Saudis now will boost output to more
than 7 million barrels, replacing nearly half of the Iraqi oil
being blocked by a worldwide embargo.
   ``If Saudi Arabia increases production, that puts them in a more
overt confrontation with Iraq,'' said James E. Akins, a former U.S.
ambassador to Saudi Arabia. ``We'd have to assume there would be an
attempt by Iraq to sabotage Saudi oil production.''
   The oil fields of Saudi Arabia, as it happens, are concentrated
in the east near the borders with Kuwait and Iraq, making them all
the more vulnerable to attack. Even if American and other forces
are able to keep Iraq from gobbling up the Saudis as it did tiny
Kuwait, it would be hard to prevent any damage.
   ``It's a huge complex. It's very difficult to protect every
checkpoint,'' Akins said.
   Increased production from countries outside the region, such as
Mexico and Venezuela, will not be enough to replace the missing
Iraqi oil, let alone cover for a disaster in Saudi Arabia.
   The United States has about 600 million barrels of crude oil in
its Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which should be able to deliver up
to 3.5 million barrels a day to refineries if Bush orders it
tapped. West Germany, Japan and other industrial powers have
similar emergency oil reserves.
   Akins joined other critics in urging Bush to release oil
immediately from the strategic reserve to head off panicky price
increases and lines at gasoline stations.
   He also said it was time to put a gas rationing system in place,
to be ready if drastic shortages and zooming prices make it
necessary.
   ``Price rationing would be catastrophic. Physical rationing need
not be catastrophic,'' Akins said.

<HEAD>Tentative Contract Agreement Averts Strike by Supermarket Workers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CARSON, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A tentative contract was reached with
about 80,000 supermarket workers in California shortly after union
members began walking off their jobs.
   Members of the United Food and Commercial Workers will vote on
the proposed contract this weekend. The tentative pact was
announced Thursday night about 15 minutes after a strike deadline,
said union spokesman Bob Bleiweiss.
   Some union members had already walked off their jobs, but
quickly returned to work, he said.
   John C. Sperry, president of UFCW Local 324, said the proposed
agreement contained improved wages, pensions, working conditions
and health benefits.
   Union spokesman Michael O'Rourke said earlier that the Food
Employers Council's most recent offer provided three-year raises of
9.8 percent to 10.7 percent for veteran employees.
   The union represents about 73,000 clerks and 7,000 meat cutters
at 800 supermarkets from San Diego to San Luis Obispo.
   The clerks currently earn between $4 and $13.05 an hour. Meat
cutters make from $9.31 to $14.33 an hour.
   The Food Employers Council represents Vons, Ralphs, Alpha Beta,
Lucky, Albertsons and Stater Bros. supermarkets.

<TEXT>
   What could be more anesthetizing than the
first August in Washington of the post-Cold War era?
   Answer: Just about any August of the Cold War era.
   This city seemed headed for one of the laziest Augusts ever just
a week ago. With communists a disappearing species, what passed for
controversy here was the way Roseanne Barr butchered the National
Anthem.
   The sounds of summer could be heard at households everywhere.
``Don't forget the beach towels.'' ``Where's the sun block?''
   Some of the people who were saying those things never made it
out the front door.
   August was only about 18 hours old when all hell broke loose in
the Middle East. Nothing has been the same here since then. Saddam
Hussein has reduced Roseanne Barr to a mere footnote.
   Washington has become a city of frayed nerves and furrowed
brows, of countless canceled vacations. The work days have become
longer and the tempers shorter.
   George Lewis of NBC News had it right when he put new words to
an old Bill Haley tune, titling it, ``Iraq Around the Clock.''
   As bureaucrats throughout the city fret over Saddam's deed,
their mail piles up unread. Spouses and children feel neglected.
Books reserved for summer reading will have to wait until fall.
   Doctor and dental appointments get put off. That cholesterol
check? Kuwait can't wait. Those things can.
   People who planned to be at Nantucket or Nag's Head now find
themselves manning State Department telephones from midnight to 8
a.m. Others who had already arrived at the shore never had a chance
to unpack; the boss summoned them back to duty.
   President Bush has shown the strain. He has been testy with
reporters, replacing the usual evasions with ``watch and learn.''
At his news conference Wednesday, Bush sounded even more exhausted
than he looked.
   But Bush is the boss, and he's beginning a 3{-week vacation
today at his summer home in Kennebunkport, Maine. ``Life goes on,''
Bush said Thursday when asked if he really planned to go on
vacation.
   And as the boss, Bush was taking extra staff along to help
monitor events in the Middle East. And he plans to return to
Washington for a military briefing one day next week.
   It's doubtful anyone's schedule has been more mutilated than
that of Secretary of State James A. Baker III. He had just arrived
in Mongolia and was planning a hunting expedition when Saddam
devoured Kuwait.
   Baker was soon on his way to Moscow for talks with his Kremlin
pal, Eduard Shevardnadze.
   Since leaving Mongolia, the shredding of Baker's schedule has
continued unabated. He canceled a trip to Houston for his mother's
birthday and gave a visiting Mexican delegation two hours of his
time instead of the 12 that had been planned.
   His Thursday meeting with the Israeli foreign minister? Forget
it. His three-week vacation that was supposed to start today looks
more and more like an Arabian desert mirage.
   Other Augusts have produced other villains. Two years ago, it
was Willie Horton. Last year, Manuel Noriega was at the top of the
hate chart. But next to Saddam, Willie Horton looks like the soul
of goodness. Never used poison gas in his life.
   Another big August was in 1968. The Soviets invaded
Czechoslovakia one week and Chicago's cops had a street fight with
anti-war protesters the next.
   Then there was August of 1981 when Ronald Reagan's jets blew two
of Moammar Gadhafi's MiG fighters out of the sky over the Gulf of
Sidra.
   But that wasn't too much of a big deal. They didn't even wake
Reagan up to tell him the news. After all, it was August.

<HEAD>Abu Nidal's Group Says Swiss Made Deal for Release</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The extremist Palestinian faction led by
Abu Nidal claimed today that the release of a 33-year-old Swiss
hostage this week came after a deal with the kidnappers.
   The Fatah-Revolutionary Council, in a statement published by
Beirut's An-Nahar independent newspaper, called on the Swiss
government and the International Committee of the Red Cross to
``break their silence and declare the real identity of the side
that concluded the release deal.''
   But the statement did not elaborate on the alleged deal or give
a source for the group's allegation. The group's spokesman, Walid
Khalid, was not immeditately available for comment.
   Swiss and Red Cross officials have denied that any deal took
place for the release Thursday of relief worker Emanuel Christen.
   France said the release may have been a result of its decision
last month to pardon Anis Naccache and four other members of a
pro-Iranian assassination team.
   The Fatah-Revolutionary Council statement reiterated that it was
``not involved at all in the abduction crime or the release deal.''
   It challenged ``those who call themselves the ficticious
Palestinian Revolutionary Squads faction to reveal its true
identity and shoulder the responsibility of their acts instead of
blaming them on revolutionary fighting forces.''
   The previously unknown Palestinian Revolutionary Squads
announced Tuesday that Christen, 33, and fellow Swiss captive Elio
Erriquez, kidnapped Oct. 6, would be freed within 24 hours.
   There was no explanation why Erriquez was not released.
   Both men worked as orthopedic technicians at a Red Cross clinic
in Sidon, 25 miles from Beirut.
   No group had claimed the Swiss pair's abduction, but Lebanese
police suspected Abu Nidal's group, which repeatedly denied the
charge.
   Abu Nidal, whose real name is Sabri al-Banna, broke away from
Yasser Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization in 1973 and set
up his own group based in Iraq, Syria and Libya.
   Christen was the first Western hostage released since two
Americans were freed in April. His release brought to 15 the number
of foreigners held hostage in Lebanon.
   The longest held is Terry Anderson, 42, chief Middle East
correspondent of The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16,
1985.

<TEXT>
   The nation's highest court should
not decide on abortion, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia
says.
   ``The Constitution says nothing about it either way,'' Scalia
said Thursday. ``That's how I read the document. It's an issue the
states must decide for themselves.''
   His remarks came in response to written questions submitted
after a speech before the Los Angeles World Affairs Council. About
1,100 people attended.
   Scalia did not specifically discuss abortion in his talk,
focusing instead on his belief that judges should not engage in
public debate.
   Still, his speech was interrupted by two abortion-rights
activists.
   ``You have blood on your hands,'' shouted one of the
demonstrators. ``You're killing women. Women will die because of
you.''
   Both were quickly escorted out of the ballroom by security
personnel.
   Scalia also avoided discussion of David Souter's nomination to
the high court. And he declined to answer a question about what the
Senate should be allowed to ask a Supreme Court nominee during
confirmation hearings.
   ``The Senate and I have an understanding,'' Scalia said. ``They
don't kibitz about how I do my business and I don't kibitz about
how they do theirs.''
   The 54-year-old Scalia, appointed to the court in 1986 by then
President Reagan, has tried to pull the court further to the right
and has been outspoken in criticizing conservative colleagues who
prefer incremental change.
   Though he has a libertarian streak and strict adherence to
constitutional principles that occasionally produce a surprise,
Scalia is considered one of four solid votes poised to overturn the
Supreme Court's 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision legalized a woman's
right to an abortion.
   Hundreds of abortion-rights demonstrators crowded outside the
hotel.
   ``We want to send a message to the president and the Senate that
we want no more Scalias,'' said Kathy Spillar, national coordinator
of an activist group called the Feminist Majority.
   Ms. Spillar was referring to Scalia's reputation as an abortion
foe and Souter's nomination. Souter has not made public his stand
on the abortion issue.
   ``American people have a right to know where Souter stands on
abortion,'' Ms. Spillar said. ``He could be the fifth vote, the
swing vote on the Roe decision.''
   Motorists creeping along Wilshire Boulevard in rush-hour traffic
honked and waved at demonstrators who lined the sidewalks and
chanted slogans.
   The protesters waved signs with such slogans as, ``U.S. out of
my uterus,'' ``How many black children do you plan to adopt this
year?'' and ``Women are not incubators.''
   Among the demonstrators was Rosemary Stasek, 27, a member of
Southern California Catholics for Choice.
   ``Because Antonin Scalia is a Catholic, we want him to know that
the majority of Catholics are pro-choice,'' she said.
   Demonstrators also included members of the newly formed Nurses
for Choice and the National Organization for Women.

<HEAD>Cheap Gas Promotion Turns Into Chaos</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GRANDVIEW, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fueled by motorists' frustration with
rising gas prices, a gimmick to sell cheap gas at a service station
turned into chaos that took police three hours to control.
   Before it was over, hundreds of motorists had lined up Thursday
to buy gas for 48.9 cents a gallon at Kar Kleen, which has only six
pumps.
   That was 64 cents less than the price at some competing stations
in suburban Kansas City.
   ``It's like somebody giving you seven or eight bucks,'' said
Clel Hall, who ran out of gas while waiting in line and had to push
his car to the pump.
   The idea was promoted by radio station KBEQ-FM, known as Q104,
which offered $1,004 to the station with the cheapest gas in the
metropolitan area.
   The price of gasoline has risen since war broke out in the
Middle East.
   The special, which included premium grades, was supposed to last
for 104 minutes beginning at noon.
   Cars started lining up at 10:30 a.m. and extended more than a
mile about an hour later. Station manager Roger Weibrecht said he
expected to sell about 3,000 gallons during the special.
   Police were not warned of the promotion, and 11 Grand View and
Kansas City officers were sent out to direct traffic, answer
complaints from area businesses and mediate traffic altercations.
   ``I'm all for stunts, but this could be dangerous,'' Grandview
Officer H.R. Ellis said while directing traffic. ``There are people
leaving their cars, running for food, and they could get run over.''
   Business owners complained about blocked driveways and tempers
flared as cars tried to cut into line. Waiting motorists were
detoured to avoid clogging the U.S. 71 interchange.
   Police closed the line at 1 p.m. and the last tank was filled at
2:30 p.m. There were no reports of serious accidents. But, customer
Debbie Gross said the good price was tempered by the dent in her
convertible, which was hit by another waiting car.
   ``I don't know. The price is wonderful, but now I have to go
home and tell my husband about the car,'' she said.

<HEAD>Palestinian Stabbed, Decapitated in West Bank</HEAD>

   Palestinian militants fatally stabbed a
suspected collaborator with Israel, cut off his head and hung it
from an electrical line in a West Bank town, an Arab witness said
today.
   The army confirmed the death Thursday of Idris Akeel and said it
was under investigation by police. Police officials refused comment.
   Akeel, 45, was driving near the town of Dura when he was
ambushed by militants hurling stones at his car, said a villager
who would only give her first name, Salma.
   ``He came out with a pistol in his hand and began shooting,''
Salma said. She said Akeel was eventually overcome by his
knife-wielding attackers.
   ``The activists cut off his head and hung it from an electricity
wire. They pushed his car with the body in it into a valley,''
Salma said.
   Israel radio confirmed that the victim was stabbed to death, but
did not mention anything about him being decapitated.
   Whistles of joy were heard throughout Dura after news of the
killing spread, the reports said.
   Akeel's death brought to 247 the number of Palestinians slain by
fellow Arabs, most on suspicion of helping Israel, since the
December 1987 start of the Palestinian uprising against Israeli
occupation of the Gaza Strip and West Bank. The killing of Akeel
was one of the must brutal cases reported.
   Another 727 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiers
and civilians. Forty-seven Israelis have died.
   Villagers said Akeel was the leader of a group of from 10 to 15
armed Palestinians who patrolled Dura, an isolated hill town of
10,000 people near the West Bank city of Hebron.
   Akeel and his men reportedly raided houses and frequently
threatened activists at gunpoint. Villagers blamed Akeel for the
shooting deaths of two activists in confrontations in the past year.
   In other developments today, the army sealed one room in the
five-room house of Abdul Sami Karaz in the Gaza Strip refugee camp
of Deir el-Balah. Karaz' son is accused of throwing a stone at a
woman soldier and injuring her, the army said. The measures brought
the number of such actions this week to eight, in addition to one
house demolished Wednesday.
   The army seals houses by bricking up windows and doors. Soldiers
then frequently patrol the area to make sure people do not move
back in.
   The practice has been condemned by the United States and other
Western nations as collective punishment. In the vast majority of
the cases, houses are sealed or demolished while a suspect is still
awaiting trial.

<HEAD>Harvard Under Fire For Alleged Discrimination</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Harvard University has come under fire for alleged
discrimination after the reassignment or dismissal of several
minority administrative staffers, according to a published report
today.
   Several minority employees have been fired or reassigned in the
past year, and two have taken legal action, The Boston Globe
reported.
   Another employee has filed a discrimination complaint with the
federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which is
investigating the matter at Harvard Law School this week, the
newspaper said.
   University spokeswoman Merry Touborg declined to comment on the
allegations.
   Lawrence Watson, an assistant dean at the Harvard School of
Design who was laid off in June after more than five years, was
said to be taking legal action, the Globe reported. Watson declined
to comment about the matter.
   Watson was co-chairman of the Harvard University Association of
Black Faculty and Administrators with Harvard Law Professor Derrick
A. Bell Jr.
   ``I am appalled that a senior administrator like Watson with an
outstanding record could be summarily fired under the guise of a
budget cut, when there was no suggestion of any problem with his
job performance,'' Bell said.
   ``His termination will have a chilling effect on black
administrators at Harvard,'' Bell said. ``Here was a guy who was
outspoken, and look what happened to him.''
   Last spring Bell promised to step down if the law school failed
to give tenure to a black female professor, which it lacked.
   A black female administrator at the Harvard Business School also
was dismissed recently after four years. She said she has sought
legal representation.
   The woman, who asked not to be identified, said she was told
there was not enough work for her to perform. But two consultants
were reportedly hired to fulfill her duties within days of her
firing, the Globe reported.
   Kunmi Toyu, a black computer operations assistant at Harvard Law
School, was to be released at the end of this month. Toyu was
allegedly hired below the posted salary level after a white male
was hired for the same position at higher pay.
   Toyu said she filed a complain with the EEOC over her dismissal.
An official with the federal agency said it does not comment on
investigations.
   A fourth administrator, Mildred Allen, was reportedly reassigned
from personnel director of the law school to the medical school.
Allen, a vocal affirmative action advocate, would not comment.
   Harvard has 8,512 non-faculty positions, and 1,410 are held by
minorities, according to the school's Affirmative Action Plan.
   At the law school, 54 of the 343 non-faculty positions are held
by minorities, and the business school employs 59 minorities in 538
positions. The design school includes 12 minorities on a staff of
92.

<HEAD>Federal Government To Test For Pesticide In Honey</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration will test
the nation's honey after some in Massachusetts was found with 22
times the legal amount of pesticide, according to a published
report today.
   Officials identified two large beekeeping operations which
allegedly misused the chemical, fluvalinate, in hives used to
pollinate cranberry bogs in Massachusetts, The Boston Herald
reported.
   Inspectors found fluvalinate in honey taken from hives owned by
one of the companies. The company sells honey to the public as well
as to the federal government, which gives it to schools and senior
citizen centers.
   John A. Hamilton Jr., compliance director for the FDA in Boston,
said the agency was concerned that dozens of beekeepers who travel
between Florida and New England pollinating everything from citrus
groves to apples orchards may be misusing the pesticide.
   ``We don't know whether this is (in) food for human consumption
or not at this point, so we are actively investigating it and we
will begin testing the honey that is sold for human consumption,''
he said.
   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency describes fluvalinate
as ``low to moderately toxic.'' It is made by the Sandoz Crop
Protection Corp. and can cause skin, eye and throat irritation, the
EPA said.
   Fluvalinate, which is legal for use in hives which do not
produce honey, is used to kill the varroa mite, which kills bees.
   Officials are concerned that some of the 169.3 million pounds of
honey purchased by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and
distributed to schools, centers for the elderly, and other human
services agencies may be contaminated.
   A source close to the investigation who spoke on condition of
anonymity said officials from at least two other states, including
Florida, are cooperating with the investigation by the EPA and FDA,
the Herald said.
   ``This is just symptomatic of the rest of the (industry),'' the
source said. ``The FDA is looking at honey all across the country.''

<TEXT>
   The defense in the Central Park jogger case was
dealt a setback when the judge told the jury that the law did not
necessarily require that the young defendants' parents be present
during questioning.
   Justice Thomas Galligan's instructions came in response to a
request for clarification from the jury during its first day of
deliberations Thursday. Jurors resumed deliberations in the rape
and attempted murder case shortly after 10 a.m. today.
   ``The fact that a parent was not present during the questioning
of a juvenile does not automatically mean the statement is
involuntary,'' the judge said.
   Peter Rivera, 15-year-old Raymond Santana's lawyer, had argued
that Santana's incriminating statements were no good because his
grandmother, who spoke little English, was the only adult with him
during questioning.
   ``The attack on the confession was our central issue. The
judge's instructions hurt my case,'' Rivera said Thursday.
   Santana, Yusef Salaam, 16, and Antron McCray, 16, are charged
with attacking a jogger in Central Park in April 1989. They were
tried in an adult court as juveniles, meaning a conviction would
bring limited prison terms.
   Prosecutors said the jogger was dragged into the woods,
gang-raped, bashed with a brick and pipe and left to die in a pool
of blood. She is back at work as an investment banker but her
sight, balance and smell are impaired.
   The savagery of the attack and her extraordinary recovery
captured the attention of the city and the nation.

   Stock prices moved lower today in New York, Tokyo and London,
the dollar edged higher and oil prices rose slightly as traders
awaited new developments in the Persian Gulf crisis.
   Arab leaders were meeting today in Cairo, Egypt, where President
Hosni Mubarak told them they either must persuade Iraq to withdraw
from Kuwait or allow foreign powers mobilizing in the region to
resolve the crisis for them.
   Iraq's invasion of Kuwait last week drove oil prices sharply
higher and rocked world financial markets because of the
possibility of a dropoff in oil supply, which could fuel inflation
and crimp industrial production.
   As the Cairo meeting got under way, stock prices were slightly
lower on Wall Street, with the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial
stocks down 7.42 points to 2,752.49 as of 10 a.m. EDT.
   On London's Stock Exchange, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange
100-share index was down 6.80 points at 2,237.80.
   Earlier, stock prices lost ground on the Tokyo Stock Exchange,
where the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 286.18 points, or
1.04 percent, to close at 27,329.55. It was the Nikkei's lowest
closing level since Oct. 24, 1988, when it ended trading at
27,281.54. The index had fallen 893.41 points Thursday.
   Akira Shimoda, an equity analyst with Yamaichi Securities, said
the uncertainty about the Middle East left ``a negative
psychological impact on investors.''
   On Thursday, the Dow Jones average gained 24.01 to finish at
2,758.91, extending a rebound that began with a 24.26-point jump
Wednesday.
   In currency dealings, the dollar moved higher in New York this
morning, trading at 150.20 yen as of 10 a.m. EDT, up from 149.805
yen late Thursday.
   In London, the dollar was quoted at 150.15 yen, up from 149.80
yen late Thursday. Earlier, the dollar closed at 149.75 yen in
Tokyo, up 0.07.
   Meanwhile, oil prices rose in early New York trading, were up in
London and closed steady in Tokyo.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, oil for September delivery
was up 20 cents per 42-gallon barrel to $25.87 as of 10 a.m. EDT.
On Thursday, the September contract lost 29 cents to settle at
$25.67 barrel. The contract had plummeted $2.35 per barrel
Wednesday.
   Crude oil contracts traded between $25.35 and $26.60 per barrel
Thursday, which some traders described as the narrowest range in
the last several trading sessions.
   Among refined petroleum products traded on the New York Merc,
the near-term contract for home heating oil dropped 0.36 cent to
69.77 cents per gallon Thursday. The September contract for
unleaded gasoline gained .21 cent to 76.42 cents per gallon, partly
on technical trading factors.

   The unidentiffied spokesman accused Western nations and Kuwait's
former leaders of having used ``sly methods'' to corrupt the

   Iraq's invasion was intended to bring the priniciples of

<TEXT>
   A man with AIDS beat his mother to death after
she came from California to care for him, police said. The man then
set himself on fire, but jumped in the shower after deciding he did
not want to die.
   Earl Imbert, 39, was charged Thursday with second-degree murder
and criminal possession of a weapon. He was in critical condition
today at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center with second- and
third-degree burns over 25 percent of his body, said hospital
spokeswoman Kathy Robinson.
   Police went to Imbert's apartment Thursday morning after
receiving a call from the woman's other son in California who was
worried because he could not reach anyone at the apartment, said
police spokeswoman Tina Mohrmann.
   Imbert, who was incoherent and had blood on his clothing, let
them in without resistance, Mohrmann said.
   Officers found the body of his 63-year-old mother, Leona,
wrapped in a blanket. She had been hit on the head with a hammer
and a wooden statue.
   The woman had planned to take her son back to her home in Van
Nuys, Calif., to take care of him, Mohrmann said. Police found
airplane tickets in the apartment.
   After he killed his mother, Imbert wrapped himself in a shower
curtain and set it on fire, authorities said, but he put out the
flames in the shower.

<TEXT>
   President Bush, praising Marilyn Quayle for
her efforts to fight cancer, signed legislation today that will
provide federal money to screen women for breast and cervical
cancer.
   Mrs. Quayle, wife of Vice President Dan Quayle, attended the
bill-signing, her first public appearance since undergoing a
hysterectomy nearly three weeks ago. Doctors said pre-cancerous
cells were detected during a routine checkup.
   ``You're looking so well,'' Bush told Mrs. Quayle, who lobbied
for the legislation. Mrs. Quayle adopted the cause in part because
her mother, a pediatrician, died of breast cancer.
   Bush didn't refer directly to Mrs. Quayle's recent surgery, but
said she was a ``source of strength to all of us.''
   Calling breast and cervical cancer a ``women's and family
issue,'' Bush signed the legislation authorizing $50 million in
fiscal 1991 for grants to states.
   Under the legislation, states would use the grants to screen
women for cancer, develop and disseminate information about the
early detection and prevention of cancer and improve the education
of health professionals in the area.
   To receive the funds, states could be required to match $1 for
each $3 from the federal government. They would also have to
provide free testing services to low-income women.
   Bush said 150,000 women develop the diseases each year and
50,000 women die from them.
   ``So many sad stories of loss could have happy endings if more
women are aware of the life-saving technologies that are now
available,'' he said.

   Patrick Halpin probably thought the mausoleum
he built 125 years ago would be his family's final resting place.
   But unless one of his descendants can be found, the generations
of Halpins inside the dilapidated tomb will be exhumed and the
crypt will be renovated and sold.
   The reason: a 1974 law under which New Orleans tombs in need of
renovation can be confiscated and the remains moved to unmarked
mausoleums elsewhere in the same cemetery.
   Called ``The Cities of the Dead,'' New Orleans' 31 historic
cemeteries mirror the city in miniature and in marble. Laid out
along twisting lanes, bedecked with cast iron fences and carved in
elaborate architectural detail, the tombs form whitewashed
neighborhoods.
   Hundreds of tourists a day visit the tombs, which were built
above ground because New Orleans is below sea level, too wet for
graves.
   Some tombs, such as those of William Claiborne, the first
American governor of Louisiana, and New Orleans voodoo queen Marie
Laveau, are maintained through a special preservation fund. But
other tombs are the responsibility of the family.
   As a result, the cemeteries have been ravaged by years of
neglect. Last week, for example, lightning blasted apart a brick
wall of 56 vaults in the Lafayette Cemetery, exposing rusty coffin
hinges, bags of bones and skulls.
   The New Orleans Archdiocese, which owns six of the old
cemeteries on almost 50 acres, has upgraded streets, drainage and
monuments in the cemeteries over the years. Now the church, along
with a volunteer group, hopes to use the 1974 law to restore
hundreds of abandoned tombs built 60 to 200 years ago.
   ``It's your house and the city isn't going to come in and
renovate your house,'' said Bret Clesi, president of Save Our
Cemeteries, which gives tours to raise money for restoration. ``If
the family doesn't maintain it, it should go to someone who will.''
   Among the tombs in need of repair is the Halpin family crypt on
the main street of St. Patrick Cemetery No. 3. Its soft red bricks
are loose and weeds grow along the edge of the roof.
   ``This tomb could be beautifully restored. If it's left as it
is, it will just continue to deteriorate,'' said Michael D.
Boudreaux, assistant director of the New Orleans Archdiocesan
Cemeteries.
   The archdiocese is trying to locate tomb owners by advertising
in newspapers, by mail and through notices posted on the crypts.
Under the 1974 law, officials must try for a year to trace heirs,
then wait three more years before repossessing the tombs.
   Over the last five years, the archdiocese has located 40 to 50
descendants, many of whom didn't know about their family tomb until
they were contacted about restoring it, Boudreaux said. So far, no
tombs have been confiscated.
   Boudreaux put the costs of restoration at $2,000 to $3,000 per
tomb, although Save Our Cemeteries said some could run $30,000 or
more. Families also must pay a one-time $2,400 for perpetual care
to assure the tombs don't fall into disrepair again, Boudreaux said.
   If a restored tomb is resold, the remains inside will be put in
another crypt and records will be kept to show where they are,
Boudreaux said. He said there have been no objections so far.
   ``If the tomb is ready to fall down anyway, I'm not too sure you
can be concerned about moving the remains,'' Clesi said.
   Boudreaux hopes eventually to restore the Cities of the Dead to
their former glory.
   ``We're seeing some derelict areas really being upgraded,'' he
said. ``Some day, it may be like it once was when families brought
picnic lunches and spent the day working on their tombs.''

   Miami-based Eastern Airlines is among a handful of
major U.S. air carriers approached by the military to fly thousands
of American soldiers into Saudi Arabia, an airline spokeswoman said.
   ``We have been contacted by the government about our airplane
availability,'' Eastern spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak said Thursday.
No flights have been scheduled yet, she said.
   In South Florida, scores of Eastern pilots and flight attendants
have been asked to staff charters that could carry thousands of
soldiers on the 6,000-mile flight from the United States to the
Middle East, employees said.
   Mary Jane Barry, president of the Eastern flight attendants
union, said flight attendants are being contacted by
crew-scheduling managers and asked if they are interested in
working the charter flights.
   Not all carriers have jets available to airlift the soldiers.
   ``We were called but this is our busiest time of the year. We
just don't have any planes available,'' said Jim Faulkner,
spokesman for TWA in St. Louis.
   A spokesman for Chicago-based United Airlines would not comment
on that carrier's plans, while Northwest and Delta airlines said
their companies were not planning charters.

   A special task force to combat crack cocaine is
being disbanded because officials concluded Britain does not have a
signficant crack problem outside of London.
   ``Because the problem has been identified at such a low level,
it is no longer considered necessary to devote permanent
resources,'' a spokesman for the Customs and Excise department said
Friday.
   The force, including officers from Customs, London's
Metropolitan Police and regional crime squads, was established in
December. Its formation came at a time of heightened concern among
politicians that the crack epidemic in the United States would
spill into Britain and other European countries.
   In seven months, the unit handled 14 cases, police said.
Twenty-seven people were charged, and officers seized about 29
pounds of cocaine, including some crack cocaine.
   The Customs spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Britain's crack problem is ``very limited, almost exclusively
confined to London _ at this time. The danger remains, we're not
being complacent.''

   The West German national carrier
Lufthansa said Friday it wants to begin flights to Berlin by late
October. The airline has not been allowed to fly to the divided
city since the end of World War II.
   Lufthansa, founded and based in Berlin until the end of the war,
said it had applied to the West German Transportation Ministry in
Bonn to begin the flights.
   Only airlines that were based in the nations of the four
victorious World War II powers _ the United States, Soviet Union,
France and Great Britain _ have been allowed to fly to West Berlin.
   Lufthansa is also barred from the air space above Berlin.
   An airline spokesman said it was not clear whether the four
powers would also have to approve the application. But a spokesman
at the U.S. Embassy in Bonn said: `The application is being
reviewed like any other. No decision has been made.''
   The Germanys are racing toward unification, and Allied
privileges are to be lifted after unification.

   India and Pakistan met Friday on
relaxing border tensions amid uneasiness in New Delhi over the
dismissal of Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.
   Indian opposition members in Parliament expressed fears the
caretaker government in Pakistan would increase aid to Moslem
separatists in India's Kashmir Valley and to Sikh militants in the
Punjab.
   Pakistani Foreign Secretary Tanvir Ahmad Khan said Thursday the
dismissal of Ms. Bhutto's government would not affect Pakistan's
foreign policy or its ambition to build good ties with India.
   Ms. Bhutto's government was dismissed and the National Assembly
dissolved on Monday, in a move analysts said was engineered by the
army.
   During a scheduled two-day meeting that began Friday, Khan and
Indian Foreign Secretary Muchkund Dubey were to consider a package
of confidence-building measures.
   The two nations nearly went to war in May over Kashmir, where
Moslem militants are seeking to break away from predominantly Hindu
India.
   India accused Pakistan, an Islamic nation, of giving military
support to the rebels. Pakistan denied the allegations.
   At a first round of talks last month, the foreign secretaries
drafted the text of agreements concerning violations of air space
and exchanging information on military exercises, Khan said.
   More than a half dozen other measures remain to be discussed, he
told reporters on his arrival here Thursday.

   The military government blamed Western
diplomats Friday for what it called exaggerated reports of
bloodshed in a clash between soldiers and a group of Buddhist monks
and students.
   The diplomats said soldiers were reported to have killed at
least two monks and two students who were demonstrating peacefully
in the central city of Mandalay on Wednesday.
   Government radio said one monk and three policemen were injured.
It said police fired to disperse the crowd after demonstrators
stoned policemen and tried to seize their guns.
   At a news conference Friday, government spokesman Col. Than Tun
said the foreign media accounts of the clash came from two groups
of Western diplomats who were in Mandalay at the time. He would not
identify them.
   ``Diplomats should refrain from indulging in mean acts
incompatible with diplomats of civilized nations,'' he said.
   Reporters reached the diplomats in Rangoon by telephone from
Bangkok. They said while they could not independently confirm the
deaths, the reports came from usually reliable sources.
   They said the demonstration reflected the growing frustration at
the government's refusal to hand over power to the National League
for Democracy, which won a majority of seats in the May 27
parliamentary election.
   The authorities still hold party leader Aung San Suu Kyi under
house arrest, and other opposition leaders remain imprisoned.
   The military government came to power in September 1988, when
soldiers crushed a nationwide uprising for democracy.

   Travel agents said Friday they had received
cancellations and were being swamped by phone calls from anxious
tourists worried about an Iraqi chemical attack on Israel.
   Also Friday, an Israeli newspaper reported the United States has
vowed to launch a full military strike against Iraq if that country
attacked Israel. The U.S. assurance was part of a message sent by
Defense Secretary Richard Cheney to his Israeli counterpart, Moshe
Arens, Hadashot said in an unattributed report.
   Defense Ministry spokesman Dan Naveh did not return several
telephone messages Friday. U.S. Embassy spokesman Don Cofman would
not refer to specifics, saying only that ``U.S. support for Israel
is well-known.''
   Sixteen Americans in a 40-member tourist group canceled at the
last minute Thursday and many more cancellations were expected,
said Ofer Eshed, manager of Ophir Tours in Tel Aviv.
   ``It is not the (Persian) Gulf crisis but the stories of the gas
masks that are worrying American tourists,'' Eshed said. ``Tourists
are asking if they will also be given gas masks.''
   The cancellations could mark the start of a deep slump in
Israel's tourism industry, just recovering from a two-year decline
attributed to the Palestinian uprsing. Tourism is Israel's largest
source of foreign capital, bringing in more than $1.7 billion last
year.
   On Wednesday, Iraqi President Saddam Hussein threatened to
launch a missile attack on Israel if the Americans launched a
military strike in the gulf. In April, Saddam threatened to burn
half of Israel with chemical weapons if Israel attacked Iraq.
   The Hyatt Regency Hotel in Jerusalem has received many overseas
inquiries about the situation in Israel, said the hotel's public
relations manager, Ezra Astruc.
   ``People abroad want to know if Israel has really mobilized its
troops and if everybody has been given gas masks,'' Astruc said.
   Both Astruc and Eshed said there was a lull in reservations for
spring 1991, which usually pour in this time of year.
   Tourism Ministry spokesman Yossi Shuval confirmed that
reservations for spring were down and said some Americans might
think twice now before buying a ticket to Israel or any other
overseas destination.
   ``Those who have tickets in hand will still come but those who
haven't bought their tickets yet may change their plans,'' Shuval
said.
   ``If there is World War III, people will prefer to stay home,''
Shuval said.
   Another tourism official said most short-term cancellations over
the gulf crisis would come from ``holiday makers from Europe
looking for sun and fun.''
   The official said pilgrims, who account for 38 percent of
Israel's tourism, are less easily deterred by troubles.
   Before the Persian Gulf crisis, Israeli tourism enjoyed a 1990
comeback after the plunge set off by the Palestinian uprising.
   Figures released by the Ministry of Tourism said the number of
tourists coming to Israel in the first six months of 1990 was up 10
percent from the same period last year.

<TEXT>
   Cash-strapped East Germany halted millions of
dollars in trade with Iraq on Friday, joining a worldwide embargo
but endangering the fragile existence of some East German factories.
   The Economics Ministry said it was complying with a U.N.
resolution to cut economic ties with Iraq because of its invasion
of Kuwait.
   East Germany had been a big exporter of electronics,
agricultural machinery, industrial equipment and some chemical
products to Iraq, said Rainer Schuster, head of the ministry's
office for economic relations with developing nations.
   The trade agreements with Iraq were made by the former Communist
regime, which was toppled in the fall and replaced with an elected
democratic government in March.
   Schuster said East Germany has in the past exported $200 million
to $300 million in goods annually to Iraq, but that amount has been
cut to less than half in the past year because of Iraq's own
economic problems.
   He said his office had no specific figure for the current dollar
value of trade between the countries.
   East German exports often were paid for in Iraqi oil. East
Germany, which relies solely on Soviet crude for its own petroleum
needs, would then sell the Iraqi oil to other countries, Schuster
said.
   He said East Germany received $70 million to $100 million in
Iraqi oil in 1990.
   East Germany has only negligible trade with Kuwait, he said.
   East Germany's economy has taken a beating since the nation
switched to a free market on July 1 in anticipation of unification
with West Germany later this year.
   Jobless is skyrocketing and hundreds of factories are threatened
with bankruptcy.
   Schuster said he did not think the trade embargo with Iraq would
significantly worsen East Germany's already dire economic
situation, but said ``it may be harmful to some enterprises'' that
manufactured products sold to Iraq.

   Firefighters today battled lightning-kindled wildfires that have
burned more than 275,000 acres in the West, including 12,000 acres
in Yosemite National Park, which was closed to most visitors.
   Scattered fires in California left 100,000 acres charred by
morning. More than 90,000 acres of forest land have burned in
Oregon in recent days, more than 80,000 acres burned in Idaho and
nearly 5,500 in Utah.
   In Yosemite, the park immortalized by naturalist John Muir and
photographer Ansel Adams, 10,000 visitors were stranded overnight
to keep roads clear for emergency vehicles. Two villages were
evacuated and 25 structures burned.
   The park was closed to most visitors late Thursday, after fires
blocked all the main roads. Fire officials planned to escort out
the stranded campers early today.
   Only California Route 395 over Tioga Pass, a small road near the
Nevada border, remained open. Spokeswoman Paula Brown said only
visitors with reservations at the Wawona camp on the park's south
end would be allowed in.
   About 200 miles to the north, a 3,500-acre blaze forced some
residents to flee Ravendale, said state forestry spokesman Chris
Parker. A 2,500-acre fire threatened the town as well, he said.
   A total of 17,608 lightning strikes were recorded from Aug. 3
through mid-week, sparking more than a thousand fires, Parker said.
He said more than 6,000 firefighters were in action, including
2,000 brought in from out of state.
   A 39,000-acre fire burned in Tehama County, and 20 rural
families were evacuated. A 17,500-acre fire threatened campgrounds
in Sequoia National Park.
   In Idaho, smoke from wildfires blanketed Boise Valley today as a
growing army of firefighters hustled to keep up with several
blazes. ``It could be several days before we'll see clear skies
again,'' said Kathleen Eide, a National Weather Service
meteorologist in Boise.
   Low humidity and temperatures topping 100 helped scores of
blazes sear central Idaho forests, while three large range fires
burned out of control on the southern Idaho desert.
   The largest of the range fires _ a 60,000-acre blaze _ ripped
across sagebrush and grass 35 miles northeast of Twin Falls and
created weather of its own Thursday. ``It looked like a cyclone
with black clouds and a wall of flame rising about 1,000 feet in
the air,'' said Dale Chatterton, a U.S. Bureau of Land Management
dispatcher.
   In Oregon, a 70,000-acre blaze turned away from three small
towns in the southeast corner of the state after 60 mph winds
switched direction. Some residents of Riley fled when flames came
within a mile, while residents three miles from the fire in Burns
and Hines watched its progress closely, said state forestry
spokeswoman Christie Sohn.
   More than 6,500 people from state and federal agencies were
fighting fires statewide.
   In Utah, crews on Thursday cleared landing spots for helicopters
planning to ferry firefighters battling a 5,350-acre blaze into
hard-to-reach areas on the Uintah and Ouray Indian Reservation.
   The blaze in the ponderosa pines and oak brush was nearly
contained Thursday before thunderstorms slowed firefighters and
started new fires.
   Meanwhile today, firefighers in northwestern Utah battled five
brush fires totaling 1,800 acres, including one that threatened
homes in the desert community of Terra about 40 miles west of Salt
Lake City.

   By a slight margin, the French want their armed
forces to fight alongside the United States in the event of war
with Iraq, according a poll released Friday.
   Of 800 people surveyed this week by the IPSOS polling firm, 47
percent said they favored French participation in a multinational
force if war breaks out, while 43 percent were opposed.
   The poll, conducted for the weekly magazine Le Point, said 46
percent of the respondents hoped U.S. forces would confront Iraq
directly, while 34 percent hoped this would not happen.
   Asked if they had confidence in President Francois Mitterrand's
ability to serve French interests in his handling of the crisis, 59
percent said ``yes'' and 31 percent said 'no.'
   No margin of error for the poll was given.
   France prepared to bolster its Persian Gulf forces to seven
ships and 3,200 military personnel Friday.
   The aircraft carrier Clemenceau, guided-missile cruiser Colbert,
anti-submarine frigate Montcalm and supply vessel Var will steam
out of the Mediterranean port of Toulon in coming days. On arriving
in the gulf region in two weeks, they will raise the total French
military presence to seven ships and 3,200 sailors, airmen and
soldiers.
   France will coordinate with a U.S.-led multinational force in
the gulf but not belong to it, Mitterrand said. French ships will
remain under French command.

Friday from Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, which was monitored in
Bahrain and translated from Arabic by The Associated Press.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   The foreigner used to respect the Arab and did not trample them
under foot nor their sacred shrines and the Arabs were one nation
... They were dignified. The ruler was a wise man and one of the
most courageous, leading the vanguard wherever the fighting ...
strong, standing in the front lines ... the most generous among
them. He was honest and feared God, was loved and respected by his
people.... A real leader ... he distributed the riches of the
nation to the people.
   He didn't obey the foreigner.... He was close to God and kept
distance from evil ...
   Look at where the Arabs are today ... The foreigner entered our
homes, the Western imperialism has divided us, setting up small
states to facilitate the task of occupying Arab land ...
Imperialism made sure they guaranteed the major points by creating
those states, kept away the riches from the majority.
   With the riches in a minority, it was used for the foreigner and
the minority ruler. They used schemes to help the imperialists.
Because of this condition, they give the worst picture of the Arabs
to the foreigners because of their shameful behavior. (They were)
stooges of the foreigner.
   There had to be a fundamental correction of this picture
changing this minority control that is spreading disease in the
body of the majority. And so, in the south of Iraq, Iraq responded
to save Kuwait ...
   The traitors who betrayed the nation collapsed ... It is the
battle of the entire Arab nation the battle of freedom from hunger
and humiliation away from God. It's the beginnning for the
foreigners to respect the Arab demand and respond to them
everywhere. It's the gain on which the Palestinians can base...
   Imperialism and Zionism (are) standing (up) to Iraq because it
represents the conscience of the Arab world. Iraq, oh Arabs, is
your Iraq. (Iraq is) moving darkness (away), and after (we) all
stand in one line, God will bless us ... The evil ememies' ranks
will collapse no matter how strong and no matter what traitors.
   The American forces came and Saudi Arabia opened its doors to it
under false pretext that the Iraqi army will continue toward them.
Denials and clarifications were of no avail ...
   It means that there are plans for aggressive intentions. The
joint policy with the foreigner has become exposed. So they are not
only defying the Arab and Islamic nations and their own ... They
were challenging God the day they put Mecca and the tomb of
Mohammed under the soil of the foreigner.
   Oh Arabs, oh Moslems, oh believers in God wherever you are, this
is your day to rise and spread quickly in order to defend Mecca,
which is captive to the spears of the Americans and the Zionists.
This is your day to rise quickly to defend the Prophet Mohammed ibn
Abdallah, who carries the noble message in this noble land for it
to remain holy.
   Rise up against evil, against the foreigner who has trampled our
sacred rights. Keep the foreigner away from our sacred shrines ...
Tell the traitors there is no place for them on the soil of the
Arabs after they humiliated Arab honor and dignity.
   Burn the soil under the feet of the aggressors and invaders who
want harm for your families in Iraq. Until the voice of right rises
up in the Arab world, hit their interests wherever they are and
rescue holy Mecca and the grave of the Prophet Mohammed.
   Don't let the enemy pass from the soil of Egypt to use your
water. Sons of the Strait of Hormuz, stop the fleets from moving.
Sons in Ras al-Khaimah and Sharjah, Arabs everywhere, your brothers
in Iraq are determined on holy war without hesitation and without
any slowing down.
   Victory with God's will. We shall be victorious, God willing,
and evil and corruption will be trampled wherever it is, and the
sun will rise on the Arabs and the Moslems and God will be happy.
After we purify our souls and land from the foreigners, oh
brothers, denounce them. Hit their interests wherever they are and
rescue Holy Mecca.

   Magellan, the first U.S. planetary
spacecraft launched since 1978, fired its braking rocket and
dropped into orbit around Venus today on a mission to make the best
pictures yet of the planet's cloud-covered terrain.
   ``The system worked as planned. A lot of hard work was
rewarded,'' said George Alexander, chief spokesman for NASA's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory.
   ``I'm tremendously gratified we were able to do something for
NASA and the public that shows this is a capable agency'' following
troubles with the shuttle fleet and the Hubble Space Telescope, he
said. ``This breaks the string of bad luck.''
   Magellan dived over Venus' north pole, then ignited the
forward-facing rocket at 9:32 a.m., slowing from about 24,600 mph
to roughly 18,500 mph.
   That allowed Magellan to be captured by Venus' gravity and start
orbiting the second planet from the sun, said mission commentator
Steve Wall.
   The rocket ignition happened when the spacecraft was behind
Venus, out of radio contact with engineers on Earth. Magellan
emerged at 9:53 a.m., but preliminary confirmation that all went
well came 13 minutes later because of the time Magellan's radio
signal takes to reach Earth.
   ``We are now in orbit!'' said David Okerson, a Magellan project
engineer.
   In the Magellan project office, ``there was cheering and
applause and whistling and hooting'' by scientists and engineers,
said secretary Sharon Kyle.
   Magellan encountered Venus 144 million miles from Earth after
circling the sun 1{ times during a roundabout, 948-million-mile
journey.
   The $413 million Magellan, the heart of a $744 million mission,
was designed to use radar to penetrate thick Venusian clouds,
allowing the spacecraft to make maps and pictures of the planet's
deformed, volcanic landscape with unprecedented detail. Mapping is
slated to start by Sept. 1.
   NASA plans to release the first pictures in September, but may
do so this month if images made during tests produce any
interesting discoveries.
   Magellan has raised NASA's hopes after its recent woes,
including the temporary grounding of the shuttle fleet because of
hydrogen leaks and a defective mirror that crippled the $1.5
billion Hubble Space Telescope.
   ``The major pressure we feel is the pressure to succeed,''
Wesley T. Huntress Jr., NASA director of solar system exploration,
said Thursday. ``I'd prefer not to speculate on what failure might
mean.''
   The 21-foot Magellan, deployed from the shuttle Atlantis in May
1989, was the first U.S. planetary spacecraft launched since 1978,
when NASA sent the Pioneer 12 orbiter and the Pioneer 13 probes to
Venus.
   ``Magellan is the beginning of a new era of planetary
exploration,'' Huntress said. ``We're looking forward to the
drama.''
   The Voyager probes explored Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune
between 1979 and last year, but they were launched in 1977.
Galileo, launched in October, is headed toward a 1995 rendezvous
with Jupiter.
   During the coming decade or so, NASA also plans to send
spacecraft to explore Mars, the moon, Saturn, comets and the sun's
polar regions.
   NASA has said Magellan would return more data than all previous
NASA missions combined.
   Venus is similar to Earth in size, density and position in the
solar system, although a runaway ``greenhouse effect'' raised its
surface temperature to 900 degrees Fahrenheit, about as hot as a
self-cleaning oven.
   NASA wants to learn if the planet's geological processes are
similar to Earth's. Venus has tens of thousands of volcanoes, but
no one knows if any are active.
   Magellan was named for the Portuguese explorer Ferdinand
Magellan, who sailed around the world in the early 1500s.
   The spacecraft was built by Martin Marietta Corp. and its radar
was built by Hughes Aircraft Co.

   Shirley Kagan and Matthew Dubroff did not want
to begin married life buried by the usual wedding presents, so they
created their own bridal registry _ a list of classic rock 'n' roll
compact discs on file at a record store.
   ``We figured that we'd never remember who gave us the ceramic
Dalmatian, but we'd always know who gave us Van Morrison's
`Moondance,''' said Kagan.
   She and Dubroff, both 22, get married Sunday. Since they plan to
spend the next two years in Japan teaching English, the couple
neither want nor need a lot of household objects. So instead of
registering a silver pattern at Tiffany's, Kagan decided to
register at Tower Records.
   ``We both really love music,'' she explained, ``and this was a
way to get it in bulk.''
   Her plan was simple: They would list, in order of preference,
the 150 compact discs they most wanted to begin their rock library.
   But choosing and ranking proved difficult. He liked the Grateful
Dead; she liked Cat Stevens. They wound up spending three days in
the store, arguing over the best of rock 'n' roll.
   Finally, they settled on a system: He'd pick one, she'd pick
one, all the way from the complete, 16-volume Beatles collection
down to Prince's ``1999'' and Earth, Wind &amp; Fire's ``Raise.''
   ``It was an experience in compromise before marriage,'' Kagan
said. ``But we never even made it to the classical section. We were
exhausted.''
   When the couple's friends and relatives called Tower, they were
told which discs on the list had not been purchased, and where they
ranked in preference.
   Store manager Steve Harman outlined the ``packages'' Kagan and
Dubroff had devised, such as a four-disc set of solo albums by John
Lennon and Paul McCartney and one comprising ``The Essential Jimi
Hendrix'' and ``Bob Dylan Live at Budokan.''
   But some gift buyers tried to break up the packages.
   ``They wanted to choose music that they liked,'' Harman said.
``One woman was willing to buy Kate Bush, but she said no Led
Zeppelin. She wanted to substitute Dire Straits.''
   Kagan's aunt and uncle provided the most essential gift, a
portable CD player.
   ``We've also gotten an espresso machine, some china and a bunch
of silverware, but I'm much more enthusiastic about the music,''
Kagan said. ``Some might argue that I'll become more mature and
regret this, but I don't see myself getting more sensible.''

<HEAD>Analysts: Lower Prices Show Inflation Tame Before Persian Gulf
Crisis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wholesale prices declined 0.1 percent in July,
the government said Friday in a report showing inflation was in
check before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait last week sent oil costs
spiraling.
   The seasonally adjusted decline capped a six-month stretch of
virtually no change in the Labor Department's Producer Price Index
for finished goods. The index had risen a modest 0.2 percent in
June.
   For the first seven months of the year, wholesale prices
advanced at an annual rate of 3 percent, down sharply from the 4.8
percent increase for all of last year.
   ``Obviously this number is history,'' said economist Donald
Ratajczak of Georgia State University. ``But what it shows is that
heading into the oil shock, inflation was tame.''
   Financial markets shrugged off the good news. Stock prices fell
after Iraqi President Saddam Hussein called for Arab unity to
condemn U.S. forces in Saudi Arabia and to overthrow the Saudi
royal family.
   The effect on world oil markets of Iraq's action last week means
the July report is the end of the inflation respite, analysts said.
   ``The numbers almost appear like the calm beach scene before the
shark in `Jaws' arrives,'' said Ron Schreibman, vice president of
the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors.
   Crude oil prices, which averaged around $20 a barrel in July,
have pushed past $25 since the invasion and gasoline prices are
reported up as much as 16 cents a gallon at many service stations.
   Ratajczak predicted that overall wholesale prices could shoot up
as much as 1.6 percent in August. That would be the biggest
increase since a 1.9 percent jump in January when a severe cold
snap froze vegetable crops and dried up fuel oil supplies.
   In July, energy prices fell 0.5 percent, the sixth consecutive
decline. Food costs were unchanged. And, prices excluding the
volatile food and energy sectors _ considered a better indicator of
underlying inflationary pressures _ fell 0.1 percent, the first
drop in a year.
   The prospect of accelerating inflation at the same time the
economy seems on the verge of recession presents a dilemma for the
Federal Reserve. The central bank has been fighting inflation by
cooling the economy with relatively high interest rates.
   But last month the Fed nudged short-term rates lower in response
to signs that businesses were having trouble obtaining loans.
   Economist David Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co., a government
securities dealer in New York, said monetary policy makers will
look beyond the oil shock, which they cannot influence, and pay
close attention to recent signs of accumulating economic weakness.
   Those include a leap in the civilian unemployment rate from 5.2
percent in June to 5.5 percent in July, the highest in two years.
   ``The handwriting is on the wall for the Fed. It's going to have
to ease. The question is whether it's going to ease right away or
whether it's going to wait until its Aug. 21 meeting,'' he said.
   The Labor Department offered these details of July prices:
   _Gasoline fell 5.3 percent while natural gas rose 6.6 percent
and fuel oil was up 0.4 percent.
   _Fresh fruit prices jumped 14 percent, but egg prices declined
18.3 percent. Costs were up for rice, pasta, chicken, fish and soft
drinks. Prices fell for vegetables, baked goods, beef, pork and
shortening and cooking oil.
   _Clothing prices were mixed, with a 0.2 percent rise for girls',
children's and infants' apparel, a 0.1 percent drop in men's and
boys' clothing and no change in women's clothing.
   _Passenger car prices dropped 0.5 percent. Household glassware
fell 5.1 percent, but silverware rose 4.1 percent.
   _Tobacco prices fell 2.9 percent, but they had been rising
steadily before and were still 13.3 percent higher than a year ago.
   The various changes put the Producer Price Index for all
finished goods at 118.0 in July. That means a hypothetical
selection of goods that cost $100 in 1982 cost $118 last month, up
from $114.10 a year earlier.
   In earlier stages of the production process, prices were
unchanged for intermediate goods and rose 0.6 percent for crude
goods. An example of the three processing stages would be clothing
for finished goods, cloth for intermediate and cotton for crude.

Threat</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Turgut Ozal said Friday that
Turkey is on guard against a possible Iraqi attack, but he played
down the possibility his country will become a target.
   ``There is no full alert yet,'' Ozal said in an interview with
The Associated Press. ``I think we have to be very careful. Our
chief of staff is looking at the case very carefully. We are trying
to listen and gather intelligence, and act accordingly. That is a
necessity.''
   Citing national security reasons, the government Friday ordered
an end to strikes by civilian workers at U.S. bases in Turkey. Last
week, about 4,000 Turkish workers walked off their jobs at 26
American installations to demand pay increases.
   The air force announced Thursday it was in a state of ``advanced
readiness'' to ward off any attack.
   Ozal denied Iraq and Turkey were beefing up forces along their
185-mile border. The Iraqi Embassy in Ankara also denied Baghdad
had reinforced troops at the frontier.
   ``According to the intelligence I have, there is no real
military buildup, not on the Turkish side, nor the Iraqi side,''
the president said. ``Probably these are already existing forces in
the area. But this may change as time goes on. I don't know.''
   Speaking in his office in the presidential palace, Ozal said
there was no legitimate motive for Iraq to attack Turkey. Some have
suggested that Iraq might retaliate because Turkey effectively shut
down two Iraqi oil pipelines and froze trade with Baghdad.
   Ozal stressed that the sanctions were adopted in compliance with
an embargo ordered by the U.N. Security Council.
   ``The sanctions are a United Nations decision and there is a
legal basis for it,'' he said. ``I think they (the Iraqis) should
understand this.''
   Sanctions adopted earlier this week allowed for sale of food and
medicine to Iraq. On Friday, Turkey said it was banning all food
exports except for a few items, such as milk for babies. Turkish
sanctions have also blocked Iraq's only land route to Europe.
   If Iraq attacked Turkey, Iraq's forces would counter a
formidable adversary. The Turkish armed forces, with 800,000 men,
are the second-largest in NATO behind the United States.
   Foreign ministers of the NATO alliance pledged to stand by
Turkey in the event of an attack. ``It is very clear that an attack
on Turkey would be considered an attack on all (NATO) nations,''
NATO Secretary General Manfred Woerner said.
   As the only NATO nation bordering Iraq, Turkey has taken on a
central role in the alliance's strategy since Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait. Secretary of State James A. Baker III conferred here
Thursday with Ozal and other Turkish leaders on the crisis.
   Ozal said Baker thanked Turkey for applying the U.N. sanctions,
discussed Turkey's losses stemming from the embargo on oil and
trade and asssured him NATO would come to Turkey's aid in case of
attack.
   U.S. administration officials traveling with Baker said Turkey
had pledged to allow the United States to use its air bases as
staging areas for attacks against Iraq in the event of war.
   Ozal, however, said there had been no specific discussions on
the matter and denied Turkey made any commitment on the use of the
bases. But he did not rule out that Turkey might eventually do so.
   The Americans were using the bases for training in accordance
with NATO and bilateral agreements, he said. Asked whether they
could be used for larger-scale military operations, he said, ``No,
it is not required right now.''
   The president also said Turkey had no immediate plans to join
the U.S.-led multinational force being deployed in Saudi Arabia. He
said any such decision would have to be approved by Parliament.
   A senior government official, speaking on ground rules of
anonymity, said: ``It is out of the question for Turkey to take
part in any kind of military action at this point.''
   But the official said Turkey might reconsider if Iraq attacked
Saudi Arabia.
   Ozal said there would be no need to resort to military action
against Iraq if the worldwide embargo is strictly enforced. ``I
have a feeling the world this time will not falter,'' he said.
   However, he said, Saddam may not take the embargo seriously on
grounds that Western nations would give in to profit motives and
gradually relax the embargo. ``After all, who built those chemical
weapons plants in Iraq?'' Ozal asked. ``The Europeans did.''
   Asked whether the embargo might force Iraq to retaliate rather
than withdraw from Kuwait, Ozal dismissed the possibility. ``I know
Saddam Hussein,'' he said. ``He is decisive. But he's an
intelligent man. He's a first-class intelligent man.''

   Marilyn Quayle on Friday made her first public
appearance since her hysterectomy, joining a White House ceremony
where President Bush signed legislation she promoted to help detect
breast and cervical cancer.
   ``You're looking so well,'' Bush told Mrs. Quayle, who underwent
the operation three weeks ago after doctors detected pre-cancerous
cells during a routine checkup.
   Calling Mrs. Quayle a ``source of strength to us all,'' Bush
thanked her and others for their work in helping to publicize ways
of detecting and stopping breast and cervical cancers. Mrs.
Quayle's mother, a pediatrician, died of breast cancer.
   ``Marilyn has brought a special eloquence,'' to the fight
against cancer, Bush said, adding: ``She told all Americans the
time has come to declare war on cancer.''
   David Beckwith, Vice President Dan Quayle's spokesman, said Mrs.
Quayle is ``feeling fine,'' but she doesn't plan to resume a normal
schedule until after the family returns from a three-week vacation
in Wickenburg, Ariz.
   The legislation that Bush signed as his wife, Barbara, and the
Quayles looked on authorizes $50 million in fiscal 1991 to give
grants to states.
   Under the legislation, states would use the grants to screen
women for cancer, develop and disseminate information about the
early detection and prevention of cancer and improve the education
of health professionals in the area.
   To receive the funds, states could be required to match $1 for
each $3 from the federal government. They would also have to
provide free testing services to low-income women.
   Bush said 150,000 women develop the diseases each year and
50,000 women die from them.
   ``So many sad stories of loss could have happy endings if more
women are aware of the lifesaving technologies that are now
available,'' he said. One of barriers to cancer detection, Bush
said, is fear. That must be overcome, he said.

anticipating history and unifying East and West Germany and
decentralizing the Soviet Union in its new world atlas, Society
officials said Friday.
   The sixth edition of the National Geographic Atlas of The World
removes the red line that separated the two Germanys in past
editions and refers only to the nation of ``Germany.''
   ``We've had to look into our crystal ball and see that the
unification of Germany is inevitable,'' said John B. Garver,
National Geographic's chief cartographer.
   The atlas shows both Bonn and Berlin as capitals, but features
only the West German flag. The page on Germany was printed at a
Willard, Ohio, publishing house Thursday and Friday, with the new
edition of 240,000 copies to be released in November.
   Unification is scheduled to take place in December, although the
East German parliament has called for the first all-German
elections and the merging of the two Germanys on Oct. 14.
   Spokeswoman Barbara Hand Fallon said National Geographic's first
new atlas since 1981 drops the letters ``S.S.R.,'' or Soviet
Socialist Republic, from ll Soviet states except Russia to reflect
impulses within the Soviet Union for greater independence.
   The capitals of such states as Lithuania have been clearly
marked in the event they later gain independence from Moscow, she
said.
   Other political changes to be reflected in the new book are the
recent unification of North and South Yemen and the de facto
division of Cyprus.
   The Middle East map will be flagged with a note that ``On Aug.
2, 1990, Iraqi military forces invaded Kuwait.''
   ``It's a precarious time to be putting out a world atlas,'' Miss
Fallon said.

   A federal judge ruled today that the U.S.
government illegally kidnapped a Mexican doctor to stand trial in
the slaying of a U.S. drug agent.
   U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie said the abduction of Dr.
Humberto Alvarez Machain violated an extradition treaty between the
United States and Mexico and was an offense against Mexico's
sovereignty.
   The judge added: ``The court orders this defendant is to be
discharged and the government is ordered to repatriate this
defendant to Mexico forthwith.''
   But he stayed execution of his order for one week after
Assistant U.S. Attorney William Fahey asked for time to consider an
appeal.
   Alvarez' lawyer, Robert Steinberg, said he felt the judge's
ruling was a warning to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration to
stop kidnapping suspects from Mexico.
   He added that he believed the judge's ruling would be appealed
and might go as high as the U.S. Supreme Court. ``My fear is
they're going to take these appeals for years while he (Alvarez)
rots in jail,'' he said.
   Although the government suggested a bail hearing for the doctor,
Steinberg said the defendant has no property to post as collateral
and probably would not win release because of fears that he would
flee to Mexico.
   Alvarez, who was wearing a blue jail jumpsuit, displayed no
emotion when he heard the ruling. Asked for his client's reaction,
Steinberg said: ``He's numb.''
   The doctor was spirited out of Mexico on charges he administered
drugs to keep DEA agent Enrique Camarena alive while he was being
tortured.
   Rafeedie stressed that he was not dismissing the charge against
the doctor but merely ruling that the case could not be tried in
the United States.
   The U.S. Justice Department said earlier it was pressing its
investigation into the 1985 torture-murder in Mexico following the
convictions of four men in the slaying.
   The probe includes two former high-ranking officials of the
Mexican government who have been indicted in connection with the
slaying.
   The DEA is pursuing its own investigation of the possible
involvement of Mexico City's former police chief in Camarena's
slaying, authorities said.
   ``The government of the United States will spare no effort or
expense in its continuing investigation of the circumstances
surrounding the kidnapping and murder of special agent Camarena,''
U.S. Attorney Lourdes G. Baird said.
   The second Camarena trial ended Monday with the conviction of
the last of four defendants. Three people were convicted in 1988 on
charges of involvement in the murder.
   More than two dozen people have been convicted in Mexico.

<HEAD>Grateful Dead Member Died Of Drug Overdose, Coroner Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MARTINEZ, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grateful Dead keyboardist Brent Mydland,
who was found dead in his home last month, died from an overdose of
drugs, a coroner said Friday.
   ``The autopsy examination revealed a recent puncture mark on the
left arm consistent with a recent intravenous injection prior to
death,'' said Capt. Al Moore of the Contra Costa coroner's office.
``Toxicology tests reveal lethal levels of morphine and cocaine in
the blood.''
   No drugs or narcotics paraphernalia were found and there was no
indication of foul play, Moore said. Mydland had reportedly been
troubled over family problems, but Moore said there was no evidence
of suicide.
   Mydland, 37, was found dead July 26 in the bedroom of his
secluded Lafayette home, in the hills above Berkeley.
   The band had returned to Northern California two days before
from a three-week national tour.
   Grateful Dead publicist Dennis McNally said band members had no
immediate comment on the coroner's report.
   ``Speaking as an individual,'' McNally added, ``I can only say
no matter what the cause of death, Brent was a sweet guy and it's a
tragedy his music is not around any more.''
   Mydland joined the Grateful Dead in 1979 and was its newest
member. In addition to playing keyboard instruments, he wrote songs
such as ``Far From Me'' and the environmental ballad ``We Can Run
(But We Can't Hide).''
   Led by guitarist Jerry Garcia, the band was formed in the 1960s
in San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury district. Although it releases
albums sporadically, its concerts are almost always sold out,
thanks to devoted fans known as ``Deadheads.''
   Mydland replaced keyboardist Keith Godchaux, who later died in
an auto accident about a year after leaving the band. Godchaux had
replaced Ron ``Pigpen'' McKernan, who died of cirrhosis of the
liver at age 27 in 1973.
   Mydland and his estranged wife, Lisa, had two daughters. Half of
his more than $2 million estate went automatically to his wife
under California law, and under Mydland's will the other half was
placed in trust to care for his two daughters.

   Lawyer Christopher A. Hart was sworn in Friday
as a member of the National Transportation Safety Board, which
investigates air, land and sea accidents.
   Hart, who was nominated by President Bush in June and then
confirmed by the Senate, fills the seat left vacant when Joseph
Nall died in an airplane crash in Venezuela last November.
   The five-member board manages a staff of investigators, conducts
hearings and draws up reports on major accidents. It has no
regulatory powers but makes recommendations to government agencies,
Congress and transportation companies for safety improvements.
   Hart, a native of Denver, Colo., has been managing partner of
Hart &amp; Chavers of Washington. He earlier was deputy general counsel
at the Transportation Department and has worked as an attorney for
the Air Transport Association, which represents airlines.
   He is a pilot with certificates for flying commercial and
single- or multi-engine aircraft. His term on the board expires
Dec. 31, 1992.

   Armed soldiers, riot police
and ANC marshals marched through mixed-race townships of Port
Elizabeth on Friday to restore order after 42 people died in four
days of rioting and looting.
   ``It would appear the situation is under control, but we cannot
say if it will flair up again or what is going to happen,'' said
Maj. Bill Dennis, a police spokesman in the southeastern coastal
city. He said sporadic incidents or arson, looting and
stone-throwing continued Friday although it was ``much quieter.''
   Police Lt. Gen. Mulder van Eyck said security forces were in
control of much of the area, where violence erupted Monday night
following a local meeting to protest rent increases and the
educational system.
   Police said 42 people were killed in fighting which spread
Thursday night to townships around the city of Uitenhage, 15 miles
inland from Port Elizabeth. Some were killed by police gunfire, but
there was no breakdown on how many, they said.
   Police said 220 people had been arrested for ``looting,
plundering and burning'' since Monday.
   Telephone, trash collection, mail and all other public services
were cut off in the riot-hit areas. Municipal employees had been
targeted for attack and, along with most other residents, stayed
home to protect their houses.
   The government had appealed to Port Elizabeth residents to stop
the unrest. The African National Congress held a community meeting
and urged people to stay off the streets.
   Van Eyck said residents told him the unrest was sparked by the
``high rental of homes, the lack of proper water supply, lack of
facilities and the inadequate schools.''
   The riots began Monday in a clash between members of a political
group and police at a meeting to protest rent increases and
education problems.
   Dennis said police had learned that criminals had joined the
crowd and helped spark the violence by throwing stones.
   Police and political organizations said criminal gangs and mobs
of looters then took advantage of the unrest and were responsible
for much of the violence and arson.
   Police repeatedly opened fire with shotguns and pistols to
disperse the mobs. Businessmen have also been reported firing at
looters.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American Red Cross today announced that it
is nationalizing the operations of its 54 regions and appointing a
new senior vice president who will oversee blood services.
   The changes, aimed at assuring the safety of the blood supply
and meeting federal regulations, came after ``searing
self-examination'' as well as scrutiny by the press and the Food
and Drug Administration, said Red Cross Chairman George F. Moody.
   The organization has been the subject of an FDA investigation
into the condition of its blood supply.
   Moody said each of the group's 54 blood regions will have a new
``principal officer,'' appointed and paid for by the national
headquarters, who will report directly to the new senior vice
president, Dr. Jeffrey McCullough of St. Paul. Previously, regional
blood services directors had reported to their local chapters.
   In addition, Moody said the organization has tripled its
regulatory affairs unit in Washington from five to 14 people and
doubled from eight to 16 people the unit responsible for evaluating
the blood services offered by local chapters and following up their
reports of accidents or errors.
   A preliminary report on an FDA inspection of the Red Cross's
national headquarters in Washington in May found that for years,
various Red Cross regional offices had not reported accidents and
errors made in gathering and distribution of blood.
   Even when regions did make such reports, the audit found,
Washington headquarters did not always review or follow up those
reports.
   The Red Cross supplies blood to more than half the hospitals in
the country.
   One example the investigation cited concerned the Washington
regional center. About 230 cases were reported to the Washington
region in which people may have contracted the AIDS virus through
blood transfusions, the report said, but headquarters was alerted
to only four of those cases.
   FDA officials said Red Cross procedures were not responsible for
the infections. Almost all of the transfusions, they said, took
place before 1985, when reliable AIDS tests became available.
   FDA spokesman Jeff Nesbit said the agency was unaware of the
pending changes.
   But ``if they're putting in a system where they can get reports
from their field office, that's all to the good,'' he said.
   Nesbit said the FDA ``has an ongoing discussion with the Red
Cross'' and ``I suspect those discussions will continue.''
   The agency's regions, which have been operating ``rather
independently,'' will be centralized in the Washington
headquarters, he said.

<HEAD>Church Wants to Dig up Ex-Slave's Grave, Is Weighing Sainthood For
Toussaint</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK HAMPSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Roman Catholic Church asked court permission
to open a grave in an old church cemetery to make sure it holds the
remains of Pierre Toussaint, a onetime slave from Haiti who could
become the first black American saint.
   ``We want to be certain that what's down there is not sticks and
stones and someone else's bones,'' said Monsignor Robert O'Connell,
who is directing the campaign to canonize Toussaint.
   On Thursday, the archdiocese of New York sought the order from
state Supreme Court. Judge Phyllis Gangel-Jacob scheduled a hearing
for Aug. 28 and pronounced the matter ``utterly fascinating. ...
This is much more interesting than Trump.''
   Although the Health Department routinely issues permits to
unearth buried coffins _ mostly so they can be moved from one
cemetery to another _ anyone who wants to actually open a coffin
must obtain a court order.
   Those present when the coffin is opened, including pathologists,
church officials and gravediggers, ``must take an oath to testify
truthfully to what they saw,'' O'Connell said.
   Church officials do not expect to find any supernatural evidence
of Toussaint's sainthood, such as an unusually well-preserved
corpse, he said.
   Toussaint apparently was buried 137 years ago in the cemetery of
Old St. Patrick's Cathedral in Manhattan's Little Italy. The grave
bears several markers, but O'Connell said that ``if he is declared
a saint, and there is a ceremony honoring him, we must be sure.''
   He said there was another reason for positive identification: If
Toussaint becomes a saint, the Vatican may distribute some of his
bones or personal items to ``places where his faith was
nourished,'' such as Haiti, or to prominent places of worship such
as St. Patrick's Cathedral on Fifth Avenue.
   Toussaint was born a slave in Haiti in 1766, and moved to New
York with his owner's family in 1787. He became one of the city's
leading hairdressers, and was allowed to keep some of his income.
   When Toussaint's owner died, leaving his wife and child
impoverished, Toussaint secretly supported them for about 20 years.
The widow freed Toussaint shortly before her death in 1807.
   Toussaint gave lavishly to several charities, including an
orphanage and the city's first school for black children, and
entered quarantined sections of the city each August to help yellow
fever victims.
   But he took no stand on slavery, and seems generally to have
avoided controversy; according to a pamphlet released by the
archdiocese: ``The famous phrase, `Only my hairdresser knows for
sure,' could well have had its origin in Pierre's discretion.''
   When Toussaint died in 1853, the New York Post said he was
``spoken of by all who know him as a man of the warmest and most
active benevolence.''
   O'Connell said the case for Toussaint's sainthood is buttressed
by one reported miracle: the recovery of a young Haitian with
cancer who refused medical care and relied solely on prayers to
Toussaint.
   Even if Toussaint is deemed worthy of sainthood, canonization
could be years away. Cardinal John O'Connor has said he hopes
Toussaint might be near sainthood by the time Pope John Paul II
visits Haiti in 1992, but O'Connell said he was told by Vatican
officials that no timetable could be set.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former Reagan administration aide who worked
with John Poindexter and Oliver North testified for more than two
hours Friday before a federal grand jury investigating the
Iran-Contra affair.
   Ronald Sable, an ex-National Security Council staff member,
declined to discuss his testimony as he left the U.S. Courthouse.
Sable was a witness at Poindexter's criminal trial in March.
   A retired Air Force colonel, Sable is now vice president for
legislative liaison at aircraft manufacturer McDonnell Douglas Corp.
   Sable was the NSC's legislative affairs director in 1986 when
Congress renewed its inquiries into reports that North was secretly
assisting the Nicaraguan Contras in defiance of a congressional ban
on U.S. military aid to the rebels.
   At Poindexter's trial, Sable testified that the national
security adviser decided to ``follow the line'' of Poindexter's
predecessor, Robert McFarlane. McFarlane in 1985 denied that North
was raising money or coordinating the Contra military effort.
   Poindexter sent responses to Congress endorsing McFarlane's
denials, which McFarlane eventually admitted were false. Shortly
after Poindexter's letters were sent, North denied in a
face-to-face meeting with the House intelligence committee that he
had armed the Contras.
   Sable testified that he did not know the denials were false.
   McFarlane pleaded guilty to misdemeanor charges that he misled
Congress when he denied North's contra military aid in letters to
three House committees.
   Poindexter was convicted of obstruction of Congress in
connection with his denials that North was assisting the Congress.
Poindexter also was convicted of four other felony counts. His
lawyers have said the conviction will be appealed.
   Mary Belcher, a spokeswoman for the office of independent
counsel Lawrence Walsh, said she would have no comment on Sable's
grand jury appearance.
   Since the end of May, North has appeared six times before the
grand jury and Poindexter has appeared once.
   On Wednesday, a former national security aide to then-Vice
President Bush testified for nearly two hours before the grand
jury. G. Philip Hughes has been nominated by Bush to be the U.S.
ambassador to Barbados.
   He worked with both North and Donald Gregg, who was Bush's top
national security counsel aide at the time of the Iran-Contra
scandal. Gregg is now the Bush administration's ambassador to South
Korea.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said today
he expects announcements soon from Germany, Canada and Belgium
about joining military efforts to thwart Iraqi aggression in the
oil-rich Persian Gulf region.
   At a news conference following a closed-door session at NATO
headquarters, Baker denounced Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein for his
invasion of Kuwait last week. But he sidestepped the question of
whether the United States would like to see him overthrown by
internal rebellion.
   He said that is an issue for the Iraqi people to decide, and
added, ``I'm not going to suggest that this is something the United
States is interested in, or pursuing.''
   Baker also said the Bush administration is ``very disturbed''
about restrictions on travel placed on an estimated 3,500 Americans
as well as other foreign nationals in Iraq and Kuwait.
   But Baker said ``we are not calling them hostages ... nothing
has been asked or demanded for their freedom.'' He said discussions
are under way to press for permission for them to leave.
   Baker was returning to Washington later in the day.
   The secretary of state expressed satisfaction with the results
of his session with NATO foreign ministers over what he said was
the ``first crisis of the post Cold-War period.''
   He said he found solid support for President Bush's decision
earlier this week to deploy ground, air and naval forces to deter
Iraq from invading Saudi Arabia and seizing control of its enormous
oil fields. He also said the Western allies were united in their
determination to defend Turkey _ a NATO member _ from any military
action by Iraq's Saddam Hussein.
   Baker said ``a number of members (of NATO) have indicated they
do intend to send military support to the efforts that are under
way in Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf.''
   He noted that Great Britain and France already have announced
the deployment of forces, and said Germany, Belgium and Canada
``gave indications they will have announcements to make in due
course.''
   Hours later in Ottawa, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said his
nation will send three ships and 800 sailors to the Persian Gulf as
its contribution to the multinational force. He said Canada is
dispatching two destroyers and a supply vessel.
   In Bonn, West Germany said today it is sending four or five mine
sweepers and a supply ship to the Mediterranean in case Iraq tries
to mine shipping lanes there, and left open the possibility they
could sail to the Persian Gulf region.
   West German government spokesman Hans Klein said the deployment
was a ``contribution of solidarity to the allies' efforts to
stabilize the situation in the gulf.''
   In Australia, Prime Minister Bob Hawke said today that Canada
and Japan might join Australia, the United States and Britain in
sending military forces to the gulf.
   In addition, Baker thanked Italy, Spain and Portugal for being
``very forthcoming'' in giving the United States the use of bases
within their borders.
   Officials at the NATO meeting also said Denmark had offered to
make naval ships available to fill gaps left within the alliance by
units that have been assigned to help in the gulf.
   Baker made no mention of the possibility of whether non-NATO
nations would be joining American ground forces in Saudi Arabia. An
emergency meeting of Arab nations was under way in Egypt to discuss
a regional response to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   He noted the Soviet Union had sent a ship to the Persian Gulf
region, and said he believed ``they would want to do any
coordination only under'' United Nations auspices.
   Asked about Turkey, which shares a border with Iraq and recently
shut down an Iraqi oil pipeline, Baker said ``there is some
evidence of increased activity up there, up north.''
   He also said there is evidence of Iraqi troops moving into
Kuwait in greater numbers.
   Baker stopped in Brussels after a visit in Turkey at which he
reassured the Turks of United States commitment to back up their
own retaliation against Iraq.
   In casting the Persian Gulf confrontation as the first crisis of
the post-Cold War era, he said NATO was demonstrating its ability
at ``dealing with threats from new sources and new directions.''
   In his prepared speech, he called on the 15 U.S. allies to
``examine how you might help'' enforce the boycott of Iraq approved
by the United Nations Security Council.
   He said he found support for Bush's decision to send troops to
Saudi Arabia and said each member nation will contribute in its own
way to the effort.
   He also said there was support for the U.N. sanctions,
reaffirmation that NATO will stand by its defense obligations to
Turkey.
   Finally, he said, ``We sent another signal that NATO is the
place to consult and meet together on common crises. ...''
   Earlier, in his closed-door speech, Baker vowed to do what was
necessary to devastate Iraq's economy.
   ``We should show that we will do whatever must be done in order
to enforce the will of the United Nations,'' Baker said.
   His appeal to the NATO foreign ministers extended far beyond
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and seizure of its oil fields.
   ``It is not only economic progress that is threatened,'' he
said. ``If might is to make right, then the world will be plunged
into a new dark age.''
   ``We have seen a continous and unrelenting buildup of arms,''
Baker said. ``The Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein has spared no
expense to sustain a vast force, far out of proportion to any
conceivable threat.''
   Baker arrived in Brussels from Ankara, where Turkish leaders
pledged that the United States could use their air bases to launch
an attack on Iraq in the event of war.
   Baker called Saddam a dictator pursuing ominous nuclear and
chemical weapons programs, and said he hoped Iraq was ready to
``close the book of war'' after its 12-year conflict with Iran.
   Surely that was in the country's interest, he said.
   ``Just as surely, that remains the true interest of the people
of Iraq today,'' Baker said.
   The NATO foreign ministers were determined to stand by Turkey if
Iraq threatens that NATO ally across their shared 185-mile border.
   Turkey, which stands to lose an estimated $3 billion a year in
commerce with Iraq, received through Baker an offer of some
compensation from the oil-rich Kuwaiti royal family that was
overthrown in the Iraqi invasion.
   Baker also promised the United States would back Turkey in its
request for development loans from the World Bank and would provide
credits for Turkey to import industrial machinery.
   There was no immediate sign at the NATO headquarters Thursday
that the alliance sees an imminent threat against Turkey.

   President Bush said today he's determined to
see economic sanctions ``tightened up even more'' against Saddam
Hussein to drive Iraq out of Kuwait. Sources said the U.S.
deployment in Saudi Arabia could involve up to 250,000 troops in
the event of war.
   ``I would advise Iraqi ships not to go out with oil,'' the
president warned. He spoke with reporters aboard Air Force One en
route to his Maine vacation home.
   The president's comments came a few hours after Secretary of
State James A. Baker III met with NATO counterparts to press for
common action against Iraq, saying the world could be plunged into
a ``new dark age'' if Saddam's aggression went unchecked.
   Asked whether he was calling for a naval blockade to enforce a
United Nations trade embargo against Iraq, Bush replied, ``I'm not
prepared to use the word blockade, but we are prepared.''
   The president said Saddam's call for an Arab holy war against
the West was the ``frantic ploy'' of a man who is isolated in world
opinion. ``It won't work,'' he said.
   Even as he said that economic sanctions ``can be tightened up,''
Bush added: ``The troubling thing is, we're up against a man known
for his brutality and irrationality.''
   Even as the Iraqis reinforced their troop numbers in Kuwait,
Bush said, ``There's no evidence right now that Saddam Hussein
would be foolish enough to cross that border'' into Saudi Arabia.
   As did Baker, Bush expressed concern about the fate of Americans
and other foreigners who are not being permitted to leave Iraq or
Kuwait.
   And like Baker, he shied away from calling them hostages.
   ``I'm not going to invite further harassment by elevating the
value of any citizens. We're not helpless, no. But as we've seen
with hostage situations, and I don't think this is one, sometimes
it is very difficult,'' said the president.
   Saddam said in a speech today that Arabs everywhere should
attack Western forces in the Persian Gulf region and overthrow the
Saudi royal family.
   Said Bush of those incendiary remarks: ``It's not unexpected. He
is so isolated in the world, so much backed into a corner by world
opinion...''
   Bush applauded a meeting of Arab leaders in Egypt, and said,
``Maybe, just maybe, and I'm not optimistic, somebody can talk some
sense'' into Saddam.
   Bush said he would monitor the crisis _ and the continuing
buildup of American forces _ from his vacation home on the Maine
coast: ``I'll be in very close touch,'' he said. Baker is flying
there on Saturday to brief the president on his trip to Europe this
week.
   In his news conference in Brussels, Baker said: ``Given the
significance of gulf oil to the world economy, we all have an
interest in thwarting Iraq's menacing and unlimited ambitions.''
   He said the United States was ``very disturbed'' that foreign
citizens, including 3,500 Americans, were not being allowed to
leave Iraq and Kuwait. But he said: ``Nothing has been asked or
demanded for their freedom, so we are not calling them hostages.''
   In a dramatic statement, Baker escalated the already high stakes
of the Middle East standoff, saying its outcome would have
worldwide ramifications and test NATO's clout in a time of improved
Western relations with the Soviet Union.
   He added: ``If might is to make right, then the world will be
plunged into a new dark age.''
   ``This is the first crisis of the post cold-war era,'' Baker
said. Germany, Belgium and Canada have indicated they soon will
send forces to confront Iraq, Baker said. Fresh deployments would
be a major boost to the Bush administration's efforts for a
multinational deterrent force.
   Still, no major Arab powers have committed to the Saudi defense
effort. Baker said NATO had no military role in the Middle East
unless Iraq was to go into Turkey.
   Baker's diplomatic efforts came as naval forces were growing in
the waters of the Middle East and White House officials suggesting
that an international naval blockade against Iraqi commerce was
possible. ``Plans are being made for a blockade,'' Fitzwater said,
so that one could be imposed swiftly if ordered by President Bush.
   Bush, under terms of the War Powers Act, today officially
informed Congress of the Saudi military deployment and played down
the possibility of war.
   ``I do not believe involvement in hostilities is imminent,''
Bush said in a letter to Congress. ``To the contrary, it is my
belief that this deployment will facilitate a peaceful resolution
of the crisis.''
   Bush said ``our armed forces will remain so long as their
presence is required.'' He said the forces are equipped for combat
and have a defensive mission. Iraq, Bush said, has ``an enormous
and sophisticated war machine'' near Kuwait's border with Saudi
Arabia.
   In a separate letter detailing the U.S. sanctions against Iraq,
Bush told Congress that Iraq has ``has tightened its unlawful grip
over the territory of Kuwait and has installed a puppet regime that
in no way represents the people or legitimate government of
Kuwait.''
   Several thousand American combat troops already are on Saudi
soil, supported by a powerful contingent of air and naval forces.
Their mission is to defend the Saudi kingdom amid hopes that
worldwide economic pressure will force Saddam to withdraw from
neighboring Kuwait.
   U.S. officials have refused to publicly reveal the scale of the
troop deployment, code-named ``Desert Shield'' and aimed at
forestalling an Iraqi invasion of the Saudi kingdom, the world's
largest oil exporter.
   But several Pentagon and administration sources, who declined to
be identified by name, revealed planning that could involve the
largest deployment of U.S. ground troops since Vietnam.
   ``We have contingency plans that could result in the insertion
of up to 200,000 to 250,000 ground forces before it's all done,''
said one source, who added that the troop transfer also could be
capped at any point.
   Such a deployment would take up to 60 days to complete, the
sources said. A Pentagon official said troops could come from units
in Colorado, Kansas, Texas, Georgia, Kentucky and North Carolina.
   ``Hussein's response will determine exactly how much combat
power we put on the ground,'' one source said.
   But if deterrence fails and U.S. forces must do battle, ``it
will be a high-intensity war with many casualties, many chemical
casualties, much equipment destroyed,'' the official said. ``It
will mean warfare on a scale that we haven't seen since World War
II.''
   Baker arrived from Turkey, where he won a promise that American
forces could use Turkish military bases in the event of fighting
with Iraq.
   The U.S. troop commitment in Vietnam reached 550,000 at its
peak, plus additional personnel in other Southeast Asian countries.
   The new total, if deployed in Saudi Arabia, would be a
significant share of the approximately 940,000 active-duty members
of the Army and Marine Corps.
   At least 2,300 American ground troops from the 82nd Airborne
Division have landed in Saudi Arabia as the first wave of the
deployment. Additional F-15 fighters and A-10 ``tank killer'' jets
were ordered to the region. Two Navy hospital ships _ the Mercy and
the Comfort _ were being readied for deployment to the Mideast.
   Two U.S. aircraft carriers flanked the Saudi coasts. More than
20 other warships _ including a third carrier and the battleship
Wisconsin _ will be in the Mediterranean Sea or nearby waters by
next week.
   Earlier Thursday, the Pentagon reported that 50,000 Iraqi
soldiers were moving south inside Iraq, and that if they entered
Kuwait the total invasion force would number about 170,000. A day
earlier, the intelligence estimates had put the Iraqi force at
100,000 men.

<HEAD>Gulf Crisis Gives Bush Political Ammunition in Budget Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Even if the American-Iraqi standoff in the
Arabian desert doesn't come to a shooting war, the crisis almost
surely will give President Bush new ammunition to slow Congress'
assault on the defense budget.
   ``Saddam Hussein, for all the bad things he did, may have done
us a favor,'' Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., said Friday of Republican
efforts to scale back the 1991 defense spending cuts of $24 billion
approved by the House on July 31. ``He sort of woke us up in
America and woke us up in Congress,'' Dole said.
   Others argue that while the Persian Gulf crisis highlights the
need for a strong American military, it also shows the need for a
different sort of defense than the one built on fear of all-out
global combat with the Soviet Union.
   ``This stresses the need in our future defense posture for
mobility, for flexible forces, for ready forces, just what we're
having to call on right now'' in Saudi Arabia, said Sen. John
Glenn, D-Ohio, a member of the Armed Services Committee.
   Glenn, speaking to reporters on Wednesday, acknowledged that the
gulf crisis may help Bush limit defense cuts.
   Bush proposed $307 billion in defense spending for the budget
year starting Oct. 1, but last month said he would accept an
additional $18 billion in cuts as proposed by the Senate. The two
houses will begin negotiating a compromise defense bill when they
return from recess in September.
   The drive to cut defenses has been fueled by a perception that,
with democracy sweeping Eastern Europe and the Cold War ending, the
world is a safer place.
   The Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and Bush's decision to dispatch
U.S. warplanes, ships and troops to Saudi Arabia, America's biggest
supplier of imported oil, has cast the defense budget debate in a
different light, analysts say.
   ``It probably will mean the defense cuts will be a little bit
less than they otherwise would be,'' said Alexis Cain of the
private Defense Budget Project.
   By triggering a substantial rise in oil prices, which in turn
makes a U.S. economic recession more likely, the Middle East crisis
also may weaken Congress' resolve to reduce the budget deficit,
Cain said. Government spending helps fuel the economy. Thus,
pressure to cut the defense budget might ease.
   Bush himself has cited the Iraqi invasion in arguing against
major defense cuts.
   ``Notwithstanding the alteration in the Soviet threat, the world
remains a dangerous place with serious threats to important U.S.
interests wholly unrelated to the earlier patterns of the
U.S.-Soviet relationship,'' Bush said Aug. 2, one day after 100,000
Iraqi troops swept into tiny Kuwait and overthrew the government.
   Bush on Friday exempted military personnel from the 1991
spending cuts other agencies are preparing for in the absence of a
budget-reduction agreement with Congress. His spokesman, Marlin
Fitzwater, said ``clearly the situation'' in the Persian Gulf
played a role in the president's decision.
   The Iraqi threat to Saudi Arabia serves as a convenient
political tool for members of Congress, too, particularly those
trying to protect defense installations and weapons programs that
provide jobs in their states or districts.
   Rep. Frank Pallone, D-N.J., cited the Iraqi crisis in
criticizing the Army on Thursday for dismissing 300 civilian
employees at Fort Monmouth in New Jersey.
   ``They are cutting at the heart of our national defense in a
time of crisis while the fat survives,'' Pallone said.
   While a surge of patriotic fervor from the U.S. standoff against
Iraq may lead to smaller-than-planned cuts in military personnel in
1991, it is unlikely to change the debate on cutting weapons
programs.
   One of the biggest defense battles in Congress this year centers
on the B-2 stealth bomber, which is expected to cost $865 million a
plane. Several members of the Senate referred to the Iraqi crisis
during floor debate on the B-2 on Aug. 2. The Senate rejected
efforts to kill or slow production of the bomber, but advocates of
ending the program said Iraq should have played no role.
   ``There are all kinds of weapons that we can deploy against the
Iraqis if we decide to,'' said Rep. Jim Slattery, D-Kan. ``Any
suggestion that we should do the B-2 because of what's going on in
Iraq and the Middle East right now is just an emotional, knee-jerk
reaction that lacks any basis in logic and reason.''

<TEXT>
   President Bush has exempted military personnel
from the spending cuts other agencies would face in the absence of
a budget-reduction agreement with Congress, his spokesman said
Friday.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said: ``Clearly the
situation'' in the Persian Gulf played a role in persuading the
Bush administration to avoid cuts in military personnel at a time
the United States is deploying forces in the Middle East.
   Bush, who wrote a formal letter authorizing the exemption,
discussed the issue with Defense Secretary Dick Cheney at a meeting
Friday, Fitzwater said.
   If the exclusion were not in effect, layoffs could affect U.S.
armed forces, the White House Office of Management and Budget said.
As a result of the exclusion, other parts of the defense budget may
have to absorb larger cuts.
   Because Bush and Congress have failed to agree on a budget
deficit reduction package, the administration has ordered federal
agencies to draw up plans to cut their spending by 31.9 percent.
   Under a worst-case scenario, most departments would have to
participate in $104 billion in spending cuts during the budget year
that begins Oct. 1. Those cuts, known in Washington jargon as
``sequestration,'' would take effect Oct. 15 unless Congress and
Bush agree on a package of tax increases and targeted spending
reductions.
   Negotiations on a package have been suspended until early next
month. However, there is a general expectation that the government
will never permit such deep spending reductions to take effect,
especially with the economy apparently falling into a recession.
   Even before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait last week, negotiators had
been planning on a deficit-reduction plan of no more than about $50
billion for 1991.
   Richard G. Darman, director of the White House Office of
Management and Budget, said in a letter to department heads that
Bush would issue the initial spending-cut order on Aug. 25.
Darman's letter was made public today.

   Former Atlanta Archbishop Eugene Marino, who
resigned because of an ``intimate'' relationship with a woman, has
been admitted to a hospital psychiatric unit, an archdiocese
spokesman said Friday.
   The Rev. Peter Dora confirmed that Marino, formerly the nation's
highest-ranking black Roman Catholic, was hospitalized late
Thursday. But he said he had no other information.
   ``This morning I got word that sometime late last night he was
admitted to a hospital, to the psychiatric unit of that hospital,''
Dora said. ``It's very sketchy.''
   Dora would not reveal the location of the hospital.
   Marino, 56, has been in seclusion since church officials
confirmed last week that an ``intimate'' relationship with Vicki
Long, a 27-year-old former lay minister, led to his June
resignation.
   Marino had been in poor health prior to his resignation and was
last known to be recuperating in New York. Last spring, church
officials said he suffered from stress and a near heart attack.
   Ms. Long's ``intimate'' ties with a priest, the Rev. Michael
Woods of Sandy Springs, also led to his resignation last week. She
also has filed a paternity suit against a second priest, the Rev.
Donal Keohane, claiming he fathered her daughter. Blood tests
showed Keohane was not the father, but the church is paying child
support.
   Ms. Long's attorney has said she was a victim of sexual abuse
who turned to Marino for help and instead was manipulated into a
sexual relationship. Ms. Long contends she and Marino were secretly
married and claims her relationship with Woods, her daughter's
godfather, was not sexual.
   The church has described Marino's relationship with the woman
only as ``intimate.''

<HEAD>Actors' Union to Reconsider Ban on English Star</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The council of Actors' Equity will reconsider
its decision barring a white English actor from portraying a
Eurasian in the Broadway production of the hit London musical
``Miss Saigon.''
   Equity said it decided to reconsider actor Jonathan Pryce, who
won raves in the London show, after receiving petitions signed by
more than 100 of its members, Dick Moore, a spokesman for the
union, said Friday. The council will meet Thursday.
   The ban prompted producer Cameron Mackintosh to cancel the
Broadway run of ``Miss Saigon,'' despite a record $25 million
advance.
   Petitions went up backstage Wednesday at a half dozen Broadway
shows _ including ``The Phantom of the Opera,'' ``Les Miserables''
and ``Cats'' _ urging Equity to reverse the ban.
   The council voted Tuesday to bar Pryce from appearing on
Broadway in the role of the Engineer, an amoral brothel owner. The
show is set during the last days of the Vietnam War. Equity said it
could not ``condone the casting of a Caucasian in the role of an
Eurasian.''
   Mackintosh took a hard line in canceling the show Wednesday,
saying ``the debate is no longer about the casting of `Miss Saigon'
but the art of acting itself.'' Newspaper ads appeared Thursday
listing a post office box where ticketholders could write for
refunds.
   Some 40 members of the 79-member council took part in vote, said
Alan Eisenberg, its executive secretary. The vote was reportedly
close.
   Mackintosh said he would not take the case to arbitration.
   However, in an interview Thursday with The New York Times, the
producer said, ``if there was a complete about-face by Equity,
under the pressure of their own membership, which changed the
atmosphere, I would be happy to discuss the situation with
anybody.''
   Talk show host Dick Cavett, a union member, lambasted the
council's ``bonehead decision'' in an editorial published in
Friday's Times.
   ``Since when are the arts a democracy? Perhaps the only
justifiable aristocracy on earth is that of the talented,'' Cavett
wrote. ``Were Laurence Olivier alive and able to do `Othello' on
Broadway, would Equity bar it on the grounds that black actors here
are unemployed?''
   Besides, in barring Pryce to protect one role, the council
eliminated 34 other roles in ``Miss Saigon'' that would have been
filled by Asians, he said.
   The union has jurisdiction over all performers appearing on
Broadway and must approve actors from foreign countries. Approval
is routinely given to foreign actors of ``star'' quality.
   Equity certified Pryce as a ``star'' in 1984 when it endorsed
his appearance in ``Accidential Death of an Anarchist.'' The union
said it rejected him this time solely because of his race.
   ``We are talking here about color and this union responding to
the wishes of its membership,'' said Colleen Dewhurst, the
president of Actors' Equity.

   A pocket-size computer helped a woman sharply
reduce her obsessive habit of checking locks, electrical appliances
and other objects, showing promise as a treatment for obsessive
compulsive disorder, a researcher said Friday.
   The woman, who had undergone traditional therapies for three
years, showed improvement when she started using a laptop computer
and again with a device about the size of a credit card. When she
had the urge to check something, she logged on to the computer,
which offered encouragement.
   The technology extends behavioral therapy into the home and
elsewhere, because when patients feel the urge to perform a ritual,
``they need some help right there,'' said Lee Baer of Massachusetts
General Hospital in Boston.
   The computer approach has not been formally evaluated, but a
handful of cases gives hope that it may be a useful addition to
standard treatment, Baer said.
   As many as 5 million Americans may have obsessive compulsive
disorder. It is a type of anxiety characterized by obsessions,
which are persistent unwanted thoughts or impulses, and
compulsions, which are repetitive behaviors in response to the
obsessions.
   Patients recognize their behavior is irrational, but cannot
control it.

   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, in an outburst of fury against
Western efforts to devastate his economy and hem in his army, today
called on Arabs everywhere to wage ``holy war'' against enemies of
Islam.
   Hours after Saddam's bellicose statement, a majority of the Arab
League nations agreed to dispatch an Arab force to defend Saudi
Arabia and approved economic sanctions against Iraq.
   President Bush said Saddam's call for an Arab holy war was the
``frantic ploy'' of a man who is isolated in world opinion. ``It
won't work,'' he said.
   Saddam had promised not to attack Saudi Arabia, but today he
called for the overthrow of the Saudi royal family, and urged
attacks on the Western powers who moved to defend Saudi Arabia in
the wake of Saddam's invasion of Kuwait.
   ``Burn the soil under the feet of the aggressors and invaders!''
he said in a statement read by an announcer on Iraqi radio and
television. ``The evil enemies will be defeated!''
   Iraq's representatives at the Arab summit denounced the measure
calling for the dispatch of Arab troops to Saudi Arabia, conference
sources said. In arguments over the measure, the Iraqi and Kuwaiti
delegations engaged in a shouting match and the Kuwaiti foreign
minister collapsed, the sources said.
   Of 20 Arab League member states present, 12 supported the
seven-point resolution. Three _ including Iraq _ voted against, two
abstained, and three governments expressed reservations and took no
position. One member, Tunis, was absent.
   As the Arab leaders debated, Saddam urged Moslems everywhere to
``rescue'' the shrines of Islam in Saudi Arabia, including the holy
city of Mecca.
   ``Your brothers in Iraq are determined on holy war,'' Saddam
said in the statement read on Iraqi TV. ``O Arabs, O Moslems, O
believers in God wherever you are! This is your day to rise...''
   Earlier today, Secretary of State James A. Baker III warned NATO
allies that the world would be plunged into ``a new dark age'' if
aggression like Iraq's goes unpunished.
   Also today, President Bush told Congress he hoped the presence
of U.S. military might in the Persian Gulf would deter another
strike by Saddam, who set off the crisis with his takeover of
Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   ``I do not believe involvement in hostilities is imminent,''
said Bush, who gave lawmakers formal notice of the troop deployment
under the War Powers Act.
   Pentagon and administration sources said up to 250,000 U.S.
ground troops could eventually be sent to defend Iraq's strategic
neighbor Saudi Arabia, in what would be the biggest U.S. military
operation since the Vietnam War.
   Washington also hinted at a possible naval blockade to choke off
Iraq's oil exports.
   Baghdad radio told the people of Kuwait today the Iraqi takeover
had restored their ``genuine Arab face and real freedom.''
   In Iraq, which imports $2 billion worth of food a year, people
fearing shortages as a result of the international economic embargo
rushed to stock up on rice, sugar, cooking oil and other foodstuffs.
   More than 3,500 Americans remained trapped in Iraq and Kuwait,
despite pressure from the United States to let them go. The State
Department said the United States and several Western allies have
made joint appeals to the Iraqi government to let citizens of their
respective countries depart.
   Baker told reporters in Brussels today the United States was
``very disturbed about the status of the stranded Americans. But,
he said, ``We are not calling them hostages...nothing has been
asked or demanded for their freedom.''
   Iraq on Thursday reportedly sent forces to the northern border
with Turkey and southward toward Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
   World markets continued to register the tremors from Baghdad.
Stock prices were lower today in Japan and London, the dollar edged
higher and oil prices were fairly steady as traders awaited new
developments in the crisis.
   Baker told NATO ministers the situation in the Persian Gulf was
``full of peril,'' and called on the 15 U.S. allies in the Western
alliance ``to examine how you might help'' enforce the boycott of
Iraq approved by the U.N. Security Council.
   ``It is not only economic progress that is threatened,'' he told
them. ``If might is to make right, then the world will be plunged
into a new dark age.''
   At the Arab summit in Cairo, Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak
said time was running out for the Arab world to act to resolve the
crisis.
   As Kuwait's deposed emir looked on, Mubarak told Arab leaders
they must either persuade Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait or face ``a
foreign intervention in which we will have no say or control.''
   ``It is an unbalanced and explosive situation, which gets worse
every day and holds within its folds huge dangers for us all. The
Arab umbrella to get us out of this crisis represents a reasonable
choice,'' said Mubarak, who has emerged as the prime mover in Arab
diplomatic efforts surrounding the invasion.
   But even before Mubarak spoke, Saddam's foreign minister, Tariq
Aziz, insisted to reporters that Kuwait is, and will remain, ``part
and parcel of Iraq.'' Iraq annexed the emirate Wednesday, a move
that was condemned by the U.N. Security Council on Thursday.
   Saddam himself did not attend the Cairo summit, although the
other Arab nations were represented by kings and presidents.
   The summit was to have begun Thursday but was delayed by a day,
reportedly over a dispute over who would represent Kuwait _ its
Iraqi-installed government or the fallen monarch, Emir Sheik Jaber
al-Ahmed al-Sabah.
   In Saudi Arabia, more U.S. fighter planes arrived to bolster the
buildup of U.S. combat troops. Britain, France and Australia on
Thursday announced they were sending ships and planes to the gulf
in response to U.S. appeals for an international force to defend
Saudi Arabia _ the world's largest oil exporter.
   A Pentagon source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
United States was prepared to put ``many divisions'' in Saudi
Arabia.
   ``We have contingency plans that could result in the insertion
of up to 200,000 to 250,000 ground forces before it's all done,''
said the source, who spoke on condition that further identification
be withheld.
   The U.S. troop commitment in Vietnam reached 550,000 at its
peak, plus additional personnel in other Southeast Asian countries.
   The Pentagon reported that 50,000 Iraqi combat units were moving
south inside Iraq, and that if they entered Kuwait, the total
invasion force would number about 170,000. Only a day earlier, the
intelligence estimates had put the Iraqi force at 100,000 men.
   Besides the U.S. ground forces, powerful Navy units were
converging on the tense Persian Gulf area. Fifteen vessels, the
biggest of them the aircraft carrier USS Independence, were in the
gulf or near its entrance. About 20 more will be in Mideast waters
by next week, including the battleship Wisconsin, bristling with
cruise missiles programmed for targets in Iraq.
   Even with so much firepower, it would be extremely difficult for
the forces in Saudi Arabia to rid Kuwait of its Iraqi invaders, who
are part of Saddam's million-man army.
   Iraq invaded after Saddam complained that Kuwaiti overproduction
of petroleum had driven down world oil prices and Iraq's oil
revenues. He also rejected Kuwait's demands that Iraq repay an
estimated $15 billion in loans. And he reasserted longstanding
claims on Kuwaiti territory.

   Some of the heat-resistant tiles on
the space shuttle Atlantis were damaged during a thunderstorm that
trapped the shuttle outside a hangar for several hours, NASA said
Friday.
   Atlantis was about to be moved inside when the storm struck
Thursday afternoon, preventing workers from moving the shuttle
until three to four hours later. Earlier in the day, Atlantis had
been moved off the launch pad for repair of a hydrogen leak, and a
newly fixed Columbia was rolled out of the hangar to take its place.
   Workers counted about 90 cracks or chips in Atlantis' tiles,
apparently caused by hail, said NASA spokesman Bruce Buckingham.
NASA workers will fill in the small dings with a silicon compound.
   Each orbiter has 25,000 to 30,000 tiles, which protect the
vehicle from the heat of re-entry into the atmosphere. Each tile
costs about $2,000.
   A lightning bolt hit the launch pad during the storm, but a
lightning rod controlled the strike and Columbia was not damaged.
   NASA plans to launch Columbia next month carrying the Astro
observatory. It has spent two months inside the hangar undergoing
repairs for a leak in its hydrogen fuel system.
   Atlantis' next flight, a classified military mission, is now set
for November.

<HEAD>Magazine: Captured Documents Show Noriega Plan to Blow Canal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD COLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Manuel Noriega drew up plans during the 1970s to
sabotage the Panama Canal and attack U.S. military headquarters to
guarantee compliance with the treaty giving the waterway to Panama,
according to confiscated documents.
   Notes by Noriega on the plan, portions of which are printed in
the September issue of New York-based Details magazine, were found
during last year's U.S. invasion. The files are currently in a
warehouse guarded by the U.S. Army in Corozal, Panama.
   The documents indicate Noriega was behind a series of small
explosions in the old U.S.-controlled Canal Zone during 1976, when
Panama was trying to hasten negotiations with the United States
over the canal.
   During the 1970s, Noriega was a rising officer in the Panamanian
military intelligence service. Panama's then-leader, Gen. Omar
Torrijos, died in 1983 in a plane crash and Noriega eventually took
control of the military and de facto control of the country. He was
ousted in December after U.S. troops invaded.
   ``In this operation of placing the bombs, I personally received
orders from my Lt. Col. Noriega,'' said a report by an unidentified
officer. ``My colonel told me he wanted 14 bombs placed, as a
symbol for the 14 (U.S. military) bases.''
   One of the bombs failed to explode and Noriega was asked by the
United States if he knew anything about the device, but denied it,
the story said.
   The Details article was written by Doug Vaughan, a free-lance
reporter who was hired as an investigator by Michael O'Kane, a
defense attorney for Noriega co-defendant Daniel Miranda.
   Miranda is out on bond on charges of helping to fly drug money
from Fort Lauderdale to Panama.
   Attorneys for Noriega, who is being held here on
drug-trafficking charges since his surrender Jan. 4, dismissed the
reports.
   ``I would be very, very surprised if there were any such
document with Gen. Noriega's signature,'' Jon May said Friday. ``I
don't believe it. But of course, it has nothing to with our case.''
   The canal treaty was signed in 1978, but only after Torrijos
asked Noriega to draw up plans to sabotage the canal and attack the
U.S. Southern Command headquarters at Quarry Heights.
   A note in Noriega's handwriting referred to a plan called
``Huele A Quemado,'' _ ``Smells Burnt'' in English _ which called
for a series of commando teams to attack and sabotage the targets.
   When U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler, who is presiding over
the case, was informed last Wednesday that O'Kane had hired a
reporter, he chastised the attorney in court and ordered him to get
approval of his investigators in the future.
   Prosecutors said O'Kane violated professional ethics by allowing
the documents under military guard to be distributed publicly.
   In its article, the magazine said that the plan was continually
updated, including after Noriega became head of Panama's military
in 1983.
   One team was to attack the lock gates, another the locomotives
that pull ships through the canal, his memo showed.
   A document marked ``SECRETO'' said ``Mission: Make inoperable
the Panama Canal and areas of defense of same,'' it said.
   Six commandos disguised as civilians were to attack the
underground command center at Quarry Heights, killing a sentinel,
then igniting a five-gallon gasoline tank.
   Others were to hit the canal itself.
   ``We'll wait until Zero Hour to open fire against some ship
passing throught the locks; if no ship passes, we will fire on the
control tower,'' according to the documents.

<HEAD>42 Opposition Activists Released From Jail</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAN PETREANU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government on Friday announced it
would free 42 anti-government activists arrested during the
violence in Bucharest in mid-June, when police suppressed a 53-day
opposition demonstration.
   The prosecutor-general's office said the reason for the
``preventative measures'' no longer exist. It did not say when the
detainees would go free.
   The decision follows the release of student leader Marian
Munteanu last week after widespread student protests on his behalf.
   Among those already released under the announcement was Nica
Leon, leader of the Free Democrat Party and one of the rally's
organizers.
   Leon, freed Wednesday, said his seven-week detention was a
``purely political'' punishment resulting from his criticism of
President Ion Iliescu and his ruling National Salvation Front.
   The detentions drew criticism at home and abroad. Western
countries curtailed aid to Romania after thousands of miners
summoned by Iliescu terrorized the capital, beating and detaining
presumed opponents at will.
   Leon, 25, also said he would now try to unite all the opposition
parties to counter Iliescu. Iliescu, a former senior Communist
party official, took over in the December revolution that toppled
Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu.
   Leon described his detention as ``miserable and inhuman.'' He
said he was denied access to newspapers ``other than those which
speak for the government, and even out of these some articles were
cut out.''
   Although Leon's party controls only two seats in Parliament, he
has been one of the government's most strident critics. He was a
leader of the 53-day anti-government rally broken up by police June
13.
   Later that day, demonstrators attacked police headquarters with
firebombs, prompting Iliescu to summon the miners. Six people were
killed in violence June 13-15, according to authorities.
   Leon said he was beaten June 14 in front of his downtown party
headquarters by the miners. He was arrested that day on charges of
inciting violence.
   He said the military prosecution that took over his case
Saturday freed him after witnesses testified they had ``never seen
me before and were forced to testify against me'' by civilian
prosecutors.
   Prosecutors announced in June that 89 opposition activists
arrested then would be tried. Since then, however, Munteanu, Leon
and several others were released without further word of legal
action.
   Leon said he plans to work toward uniting the major opposition
parties, the National Liberal and National Peasant, into ``an
efficient opposition force.''
   The opposition parties control about a third of the two-chamber
parliament elected May 20 and dominated by Iliescu's party. The
opposition protesters had demanded that former Communists such as
Iliescu be banned from politics for 10 years.

<HEAD>Sri Lanka Says It Will Move 1 Million Civilians From Harm's Way</HEAD>

   The government said Friday it intends
to shift 1 million civilians from the northern Jaffna peninsula
before launching a major assault on ethnic Tamil rebels there.
   ``We plan to get all innocent Tamil civilains out of the Jaffna
peninsula and then throw the Tamil terrorists into the ... Palk
Straits,'' Deputy Defense Minister Ranjan Wijeratne told parliament.
   This nation's civil war flared up again in June, when Tamil
rebels repudiated a 13-month cease-fire. Since then, at least 3,200
combatants and hundreds of civilians have been killed. At least 315
people have been killed in the past week.
   More than 1 million people, mostly Tamils, live on Jaffna
peninsula, a stronghold of the Timil Tiger rebels.
   ``To prevent (loss of) civilian lives, we will move them further
south into large camps and then clear the north,'' said the deputy
minister. However, he gave no details of the plan and did not say
when it would go into effect.
   The parliament was meeting in special session to discuss the
upsurge in the war.
   In violence during the day, armed Moslems avenging Tamil attacks
killed three Tamil civilians in the northern village of Vavuniya,
military officials said on condition of anonymity. At least six
Tamil houses were burned, they said.
   Moslems claim neutrality in the fighting, but the separatists
accuse them of siding with the army.
   On Thursday, five rebels and a government soldier were killed,
the military officials said.
   The separatist Tamils began battling the Sinhalese-dominated
government seven years ago. About 14,000 people have been killed in
the conflict on this island at the southern tip of India.
   Tamils, who make up 18 percent of the country's 16 million
people, claim they are discriminated against by the Sinhalese, who
comprise 75 percent of the population. Moslems make up 7 percent.

   President Bush pointed Friday to ``very
disturbing reports'' of Mideast violence against Westerners, as
Secretary of State James A. Baker III accused Iraq of violating
``all international norms'' by refusing to allow 3,500 Americans to
leave Iraq and Kuwait.
   Meanwhile, the State Department warned all overseas diplomatic
posts that the Middle East tensions could produce terrorist
incidents against American interests abroad. It urged all posts to
take appropriate security precautions.
   The statement blamed the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait for the
increased risk to Americans, but Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein said
in a fiery speech that the United States was to blame for the
region's troubles.
   As Baker spoke in Brussels and Bush talked with reporters on the
flight to his Maine vacation home, there was concern that Americans
stranded in Iraq and Kuwait could increasingly become part of
Saddam's political calculations as he seeks a way out of his
growing international isolation.
   In addition, there have been reports of rapes and other assaults
against foreigners in Kuwait by Iraqi occupation forces.
   Iraqi officials have told the United States that only diplomats
will be allowed to depart, leaving the 3,000 Americans in Kuwait
and 580 in Iraq with an uncertain fate.
   Iraq has said all borders and airports are closed but State
Department deputy spokesman Richard Boucher noted that large
numbers of non-Westerners, mostly Arabs, living in Iraq have been
allowed to leave.
   ``The practice and the policy are different,'' Boucher said.
   Baker, speaking to reporters at the end of a brief trip to
Europe, said he was ``very disturbed'' about the restrictions on
Americans and other Westerners in Iraq and Kuwait.
   He said the term hostages is not being used to describe the
Americans in the two countries. One reason, he said, is that
discussions are going on with Iraqi authorities for their release.
   In the administration's view, that distinction is important
because the U.S. government does not negotiate with hostage-takers.
   Bush, too, made a point of not calling the Americans in the two
countries hostages, saying, ``I'm not going to invite further
harassment by elevating the value of any citizen.''
   Asked if the United States were helpless in the situation, he
replied, ``We're not helpless, no. But, as we've seen with hostage
situations, and I don't think this is one, sometimes it's very
difficult.''
   Another official said that if the government calls the Americans
hostages, that would make it more difficult for Saddam to release
them unconditionally. Normally, a hostage is a person who is kept
prisoner until certain conditions are met.
   So far as is known, Iraq has imposed no conditions for the
release of the Americans. Baker said they are not being mistreated
to the best of his knowledge.
   But Saddam, who was moving troops south to add to his invasion
forces, was far from conciliatory on Friday.
   ``Burn the soil under the feet of the aggressors and invaders!''
he said in a statement read by a spokesman. ``The evil enemies will
be defeated!''
   Boucher said U.S. diplomats have been in regular contact with
Iraqi authorities about the fate of the Americans. He said there
was no change in the Iraqi position.
   Most of the U.S. concern focuses on 38 Americans confined under
armed guard to the Hotel Rashid in Baghdad. They have access to
American consular officers and to the hotel facilities but are not
free to leave the grounds.
   In warning of a possible terrorist strike against American
interests, Boucher said there was no specific information
suggesting such an incident might take place.
   ``If specific, credible information on a threat to the public is
received, the Department of State will provide information for
travelers and other concerned parties,'' Boucher said.

<HEAD>Red Cross Tightens Blood Services Supervision</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American Red Cross brought its local blood
services programs under national control Friday, announcing dozens
of new positions and tighter supervision that it said would help
assure a safe blood supply.
   Red Cross Chairman George F. Moody called the changes a
milestone and said they were prompted by ``searing
self-examination'' as well as months of scrutiny by the press and
the Food and Drug Administration.
   They symbolize a ``recommitment to our goal of ensuring that the
American people can count on a blood supply that is safe and
adequate to meet their needs,'' he said.
   FDA inspectors have found several problems in the Red Cross
system of reporting, investigating and following up on accidents
and errors that occur in the course of collecting and distributing
blood.
   One of the inspectors, Mary Carden, said at a congressional
hearing last month that the national headquarters sometimes took
months to review reports of AIDS cases associated with transfusions
of blood collected by Red Cross centers.
   Stephen Richards, newly named executive vice president of the
Red Cross, on Friday acknowledged procedural and record-keeping
problems. But he added that ``we have not seen any evidence of
contaminated blood ... being transfused into a patient'' as a
result of those problems.
   Moody attributed some of the problems cited by the FDA to a
tremendous backlog of reports, which he said is almost resolved. He
said the steps announced Friday are meant to address both the FDA
criticisms and the shortcomings that came to light in an internal
Red Cross study.
   Under the group's restructuring plan, each region will get a new
``principal officer,'' appointed and paid for by the national
headquarters. The officers will report directly to a new senior
vice president for blood services, Dr. Jeffrey McCullough of St.
Paul.
   Previously, regional blood services directors had reported to
their local chapters. But Moody said the increasingly complex
business of blood services, including relatively new tests for AIDS
and hepatitis, made it necessary to centralize supervision.
   ``We have had to clarify the reporting relationship and the line
of authority,'' Moody said.
   The Red Cross also said it is doubling, from eight to 16, the
number of people responsible for evaluating the blood services
offered by local chapters and following up on their accident and
error reports.
   And Moody said the organization is nearly tripling its
regulatory affairs unit in Washington, from five to 14 people, to
better comply with FDA regulations.
   The 54 Red Cross blood regions supply blood to more than half
the hospitals in the country. The organization's $500 million blood
bank network is the largest in the nation.
   Brad Stone, an FDA spokesman, said the agency believes the new
Red Cross moves will help standardize procedures and eliminate
communications problems among the central and regional offices.
   ``We feel that the steps they've outlined today are a very
significant movement toward ... improving the overall efficacy and
safety of their system,'' Stone said.
   FDA investigators inspecting the group's national headquarters
in Washington found that, for years, various Red Cross regional
offices had not consistently reported accidents and errors. And
even when regions did make such reports, the headquarters staff did
not always review or follow up on them.
   Rep. John Dingell, who held last month's hearing, said the FDA
found some Red Cross blood centers had released infected blood,
mixed up records or violated AIDS testing procedures.
   Dingell, a Michigan Democrat and chairman of the House Energy
and Commerce oversight and investigations subcommittee, said the
organization has had ``serious and persistent problems with its
procedures for testing and keeping track of this blood.''
   Carden said she found that FDA's own regulations had been
violated. She said the headquarters staff had failed at times to
file reports on cases in which donors tested positive for hepatitis
or were at risk for contracting the AIDS virus. Such notification
is required even if the blood is discarded.

<TEXT>
   Historically black colleges and universities
have formed an association of journalism and mass communications
programs to help promote their programs and black journalists,
association officials announced Friday.
   Representatives from 29 historically black colleges and
universities voted unanimously Thursday to form the Association of
Black College Journalism and Mass Communication Programs, said
Orlando J. Taylor, dean of the School of Communications at Howard
University in Washington, D.C.
   The new organization ``represents a historic effort to ensure
that the voices of black colleges and universities will be heard in
journalism and mass communication education and in the media
professions,'' he said.
   Supporters said its long-range goals are to help more journalism
programs at member institutions gain accreditation, and to help
increase the hiring of black journalists and other media
professionals.
   ``This association wants to destroy the myth that there are no
qualified black media professionals,'' Taylor said.
   The association will seek to enhance instruction, fund-raising,
and faculty and student development at predominately black
institutions that offer journalism and mass communication majors,
minors and courses.
   Taylor said the organization plans ``an intensive study of the
nature, scope and status of all journalism and mass communication
programs at the nation's 117 historically black colleges, to be
accomplished in the coming year, in order to provide the data base
for enhancing these programs.''
   The organization was formed during the convention of the
Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication.
Taylor said it has been given representation on the Accrediting
Council for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication.

   East Germany authorities on Friday
interrogated former Communist leader Erich Honecker about his role
in the killings of people who tried to flee the country.
   Honecker and Erich Mielke, head of East Germany's once-feared
secret police agency, were interrogated by federal prosecutors,
said Peter Przybylski, a Justice Ministry spokesman.
   More than 200 people were shot to death or killed by land mines
as they tried to escape from East Germany's Communist rule.
   The government announced in June that Honecker, Mielke and
several border guards would be investigated on possible murder
charges in connection with those deaths.
   Honecker, 77 and in failing health, and several other members of
his ousted regime already have been charged with corruption and
abuse of power.
   The murder charge could put Honecker behind bars for life, but
his poor health makes prosecution questionable. He is staying in a
Soviet hospital outside Berlin.
   Last month, a medical panel ruled that Honecker was too ill to
be jailed pending investigation but fit enough to be prosecuted.
   Mielke was ordered jailed.
   East Germany's democratic government has changed its mind
several times on whether to pursue charges against the aging
members of the former hard-line regime that was toppled in last
autumn's pro-democracy protests.

   Indian border gaurds shot and killed 12
Moslem separatists after they crossed over from neighboring
Pakistan to campaign for independence of the disputed territory of
Kashmir, police said.
   The separatists were killed during an encounter with guards at
the Trehgam border area, 50 miles from Srinagar. Srinagar is the
capital of the Indian-held part of Kashmir.
   Details of the reported enconter were not immediately available.
   India and Pakistan have fought two wars over Kashmir since
gaining independence in 1947. This summer, tensions between the two
nations flared over the long-standing dispute over Kashmir, which
both countries claim.
   India accuses Pakistan of supporting the Moslem secessionist
movement in Kashmir by providing arms and training to Moslem
militants. Pakistan, an Islamic state, denies the charge but says
it will back any movement for self-determination by the Kashmiri
people.
   At least 959 people have been killed in the Kashmir valley since
New Delhi cracked down on the secessionist movement Jan. 20.
   Jammu-Kashmir state, which includes the valley and the Jammu
plains to the south, is the only one of India's 25 provinces with a
Moslem majority. At least 65 percent of its 6 million people are
Moslem.
   Nationwide, Moslems make up 12 percent of the country's 880
million people while Hindus comprise 82 percent.

   The jury had appeared divided on Tuesday over their apparent
decision on one of the 10 cocaine possession charges Barry faces.
After sending a note to Jackson telling him they had reached a
verdict on one count, the panel balked at revealing their decision
when they entered the courtroom.
   The new note came as deliberations in Barry's case resumed after
a juror who had been hospitalized for stress returned to court.
   Jackson said Thursday that juror Deborah Noel, a diabetic, was
``deeply depressed'' and ``overwrought'' but should be all right
after a night's rest.
   The seventh day of deliberations was cut short around noon
Thursday because Noel said she didn't feel well.
   Noel, a Howard University Hospital clerk, was examined by her
physician, who ``could find nothing physically wrong with her,''
the judge said. But she was admitted to Providence Hospital.
   If Noel for some reason was unable to return, Jackson could
order deliberations to continue with an 11-member jury.
   A 12-member jury once was regarded to be a constitutional
requirement in federal criminal trials, but the Supreme Court has
more recently made clear that the Constitution does not require 12
jurors for conviction.
   Barry has pleaded innocent to 10 misdemeanor cocaine possession
charges, one misdemeanor cocaine conspiracy charge, and three
felony charges of lying to a grand jury about his drug involvement.
   Jackson assured the defense and prosecution that Noel would be
guarded by U.S. marshals at the hospital. The jury has been
sequestered during the trial.
   In a pre-trial questionnaire, Noel said she generally favors
police undercover operations ``because (they) help police and the
FBI catch criminals.'' She said she was uncertain whether Barry had
been treated fairly by the government.
   One of the 10 cocaine possession charges against Barry stems
from the FBI sting operation in which the mayor was videotaped
smoking crack cocaine in the hotel room of former model Rasheeda
Moore last January.
   Defense attorney R. Kenneth Mundy has said Barry was entrapped
on that charge because Moore improperly lured him to the hotel room
and talked him into smoking crack.

   Saudi Arabia's ambassador Friday lashed back
at Iraq's Saddam Hussein, ridiculing his assertion that the Moslem
holy city of Mecca has been defiled and calling the Arab leader a
liar.
   Asked whether Arabs will believe Saddam's assertion that U.S.
troops in Saudi Arabia have captured their holy city, Prince Bandar
bin Sultan said:
   ``I don't think anyone will believe him. There is 1,000 miles
between Mecca and where the conflict is.''
   He added, ``It is ironic that he pulled a page from the old
speeches of Khomeini,'' a biting reference to the anti-Western
rhetoric of Saddam's nemesis in his eight-year war with Iran.
   ``If anybody is to be blamed for bringing multinational forces
to our region, it is the government of Iraq,'' Bandar said.
   In a televised statement Friday, Saddam appealed to Arab
religious pride in calling for unity against foreign intervention.
   The Saudis, the Iraqi president said, ``are not only defying the
Arab and Islamic nations. ... They were challenging God the day
they put Mecca and the tomb of Mohammed under the soil of the
foreigner.
   ``Oh Arabs, oh Moslems, oh believers in God wherever you are,
this is your day to rise and spread quickly in order to defend
Mecca, which is captive to the spears of the Americans and the
Zionists.''
   The ambassador, speaking during a picture-taking session with
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., also said he was certain
that military units from other Arab countries would join the
U.S.-British defensive force in his country.
   Dole said later that Bandar indicated Arab countries were in a
better position to participate once they had exhausted all
diplomatic efforts to resolve the conflict in an Arab summit that
ended in Cairo Friday.
   Saudi Arabia had no choice but to invite outside forces to help
in its defense, Bandar said. ``We are faced with a de facto
superior power, intent on aggression. We could not rely on the
words of the leaders of Iraq because they had lied to us and the
rest of the Arab world many, many times.''
   He noted that Saddam had personally promised fellow Arab leaders
that he had no intention of attacking Kuwait. ``He broke his
promise,'' Bandar said.
   ``I just put it to you: What does it look like? What does it
sound like? This reminds me of the 1930s, and we have learned from
history.''
   And he dismissed Saddam's populist appeal to poor Arabs to rise
up against the region's wealthy royal families like his own,
saying: ``That is a cheap shot.'' He said Saudi Arabia has been
among the world's most generous countries in giving foreign aid,
and that Saddam has thanked his country recently for its largesse.

<HEAD>Polish Official Says McDonald's Exploring Operations in Poland</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An official of the McDonald's fast-food
company has held talks with regional officials to explore opening
the first McDonald's restaurants in Poland.
   Andreas Hacker, McDonald's director for Central Europe, met this
week with provincial officials from Warsaw and the surrounding
region to review opportunities and gauge the interest of Polish
authorities, according to Jacek Czerwinski, director for regional
policy at Warsaw city hall.
   ``We are of course interested,'' added Czerwinski, in a
telephone interview Thursday.
   However, Czerwinski said, the officials were told it will be at
least one to three years before the first McDonald's can open in
Poland.
   McDonald's first must obtain a joint-venture partner in Poland,
open a Polish branch office and find suppliers, he said. It will
also be conducting profitability studies.
   Czerwinski said the restaurant company later would contract with
a private farmer or state farm to grow its potatoes. Similarly, it
will hire a bakery to make hamburger buns to its specifications.
   Warsaw and the nearby cities of Plock and Radom were willing to
offer specific locations for McDonald's restaurants, but they were
told by McDonald's that it was too early to consider sites,
Czerwinski said.
   McDonald's opened its first restaurant in the Soviet Union last
year and already operates in Hungary and Yugoslavia.
   In West Germany, McDonald's is the country's largest
restaurateur and seeks to expand into East Germany.

<TEXT>
   The NATO allies on Friday unanimously
approved U.S. military action to guard the Persian Gulf against
further Iraqi aggression but steered clear of taking collective
action themselves.
   Two of the allies _ Canada and Belgium _ prepared to announce
their own contributions to the land force and sea armada organized
by the United States in defense of Saudi Arabia's oilfields. And
West Germany sent four ships to the Eastern Mediterranean.
   However, Manfred Woerner, the NATO secretary-general, announced
after a four-hour closed meeting with Secretary of State James A.
Baker III and 15 other Western foreign ministers: ``Military action
by NATO as such is restricted to its area,'' meaning Europe.
   Still, Baker, in a separate news conference, said the United
States, Britain and other nations that have sent forces to the
region will have to coordinate their operations.
   If there should be a naval blockade, for example, ``there will
have to be a traffic cop,'' Baker said. ``Someone or some
collection of countries or individuals will have to coordinate
this. That is something that is being considered and being
discussed.''
   Baker headed back to the United States after the meeting in
Brussels. He will meet with President Bush Saturday at the
president's vacation home in Kennebunkport, Maine, to report on his
trip, which also included a stop in Turkey.
   Woerner said the allies by ``full consensus'' had endorsed
President Bush's military moves in the Persian Gulf and sanctions
against Iraq approved by the U.N. Security Council. And they
pledged to defend Turkey if attacked by neighboring Iraq. Turkey on
Thursday informed Baker that U.S. forces could launch attacks from
Turkish bases against Iraq in the event of war.
   Baker said Friday at NATO headquarters that the allies had acted
with ``unmistakable resolve and solidarity.''
   He noted that Great Britain and France already have announced
the deployment of forces, and said Germany, Belgium and Canada
``gave indications they will have announcements to make in due
course.''
   Later Friday, Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said his
nation will send three ships and 800 sailors as its contribution to
a multinational force.
   A U.S. official traveling with Baker, commenting only on
condition of anonymity, said, ``You will see other allied forces,
some of which will be on the ground'' in the Mideast.
   Baker had told the foreign ministers at their closed session
that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein was a dictator engaged in an
unrelenting buildup of missiles and chemical weapons ``far out of
proportion to any conceivable threat.''
   Asked at the news conference if he was calling for Saddam's
overthrow, Baker said he was not going to suggest the United States
was pursuing such a goal.
   ``That's a matter for the people of Iraq to determine; that is,
who will constitute their leadership,'' Baker said. ``But I am
suggesting that the entire world community has risen up in almost
complete unity to condemn the aggression that has taken place by
Iraq under the leadership of Saddam Hussein.''
   Baker went on to condemn as ``beyond all international norms''
Iraq's refusal to permit some 3,500 Americans and thousands of
other foreigners to leave the country and Iraqi-held Kuwait.
   ``The United States is very disturbed about the restrictions on
the freedom of travel,'' Baker said.
   He said most if not all foreigners ``are being prevented from
leaving Iraq and Kuwait against their will, he said.
   However, Baker said, since no demand had been made in exchange
for their freedom ``we are not calling them hostages.'' Nor, he
said, had they been mistreated ``as best we can tell.''
   He said diplomatic contacts were continuing in an effort to
secure their freedom.
   Baker lauded Spain, Italy and Portugal for letting the United
States use bases to support its deployment of troops to the Persian
Gulf.
   He pointed out that the NATO charter precludes the allies as a
group from undertaking military action in the gulf, an area outside
the alliance's territory.
   However, Woerner said, ``It is very clear that an attack on
Turkey would be considered an attack on all (NATO) nations.'' He
said, ``We have been able to deal adequately'' with what NATO terms
out-of-area operations such as the situation in the gulf.
   Woerner said NATO will inform the Warsaw Pact nations of the
discussions on Friday. In recent weeks, Warsaw Pact nations have
designated their ambassadors to Belgium to act as ``diplomatic
liaisons'' with the Western alliance in reply to an invitation to
do so issued at last month's NATO summit meeting.

<TEXT>
   In the United States, Bush dismissed Saddam's statements as ``a
rather frantic ploy'' by a leader ``backed into a corner.''
   The president sent a report to Congress declaring, ``I do not
believe the involvement in hostilities is imminent'' in Saudi
Arabia. He later flew off to a 25-day vacation at his home in
Kennebunkport, Maine.
   Before and after the NATO meeting in Brussels, some U.S. allies
said their navies would supplement the dozens of American warships
gathering in the gulf region, led by three U.S. aircraft carriers.
   Canada said it would send three ships, France was preparing to
expand its force to seven ships, including the aircraft carrier
Clemenceau, and Australia said it would send naval units. The
British and Soviets also have a handful of warships in or near the
gulf.
   For a third day Friday, the Soviet foreign minister, Eduard
Shevardnadze, conferred by telephone with Baker, Soviet reports
said. But the Kremlin says it will participate only in a blockade
sponsored by the United Nations.
   An effective blockade could strangle the Iraqi economy, heavily
dependent on oil exports, most or all of which already have
stopped. Iraqis clearly were unsettled by the prospect: Reports
filtering out of the isolated nation told of panicky people
hoarding rice, cooking oil and other foodstuffs.
   Up to 50,000 U.S. troops are expected to pour into Saudi Arabia
in the coming weeks in Operation Desert Shield, as it has been
dubbed. Pentagon sources say contingency plans call for as many as
250,000 to be sent, depending on whether a grave Iraqi threat
develops.
   At least 2,300 paratroopers of the 82nd Airborne Division landed
in Saudi Arabia as the deployment's first wave. The Air Force was
deploying about 140 F-15s, F-16s and other warplanes.
   Many of the Americans were taking up positions in Saudi Arabia's
far northeast, near the Kuwait border, facing an Iraqi occupation
force in Kuwait of between 130,000 and 170,000 men.
   Detailed descriptions of the operation were lacking, in part
because the Pentagon did not dispatch a U.S. news media pool along
with the troops.
   Because of Arab sensitivities, some troop movements were being
carried out with relative discretion. A European reporter said, for
example, she saw hundreds of young Western men with short haircuts
and civilian clothes _ clearly U.S. troops _ arrive at the airport
in the gulf emirate of Bahrain on Thursday.

<HEAD>U.S. Joins Fraud Suit Against Researcher</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Justice Department announced Friday that
it would join a fraud suit against a medical researcher who is
accused of falsifying results of scientific work financed by
government grants.
   The suit against John L. Ninnemann charges that he falsely
reported research results on progress reports and applications to
renew grants from the National Institutes of Health.
   It seeks recovery of $1.2 million in NIH grant money given to
Ninnemann for research on the causes of immune system suppression
after burn injuries that he performed at Utah and the University of
California, San Diego.
   The action was first filed under the False Claims Act by J.
Thomas Condie, Ninnemann's research assistant at the University of
Utah, the department said.
   The Justice Department said its action in the case against
Ninnemann will mark the first time it has brought a False Claims
Act suit for scientific research fraud.
   ``The government's action in assuming responsibility for the
case reflects our insistence that scientific research, especially
when federally funded, be truthfully reported,'' Assistant Attorney
General Stuart M. Gerson said in a statement.
   ``The government will not tolerate the falsification of
scientific data in support of research grants,'' Gerson said.
   The lawsuit, still under court seal in U.S. District Court in
San Francisco, charges that NIH paid $544,684 to the University of
Utah and $749,098 to the University of California, San Diego, on
the basis of false grant applications, the department said.
   The suit seeks recovery of the money, plus triple damages, from
both Ninnemann and the two universities. The Justice Department
said that responsible officials at both institutions certified the
grant applications and progress reports that Ninnemann filed about
his research.
   The suit also seeks penalties ranging between $5,000 and $10,000
for each of 14 false statements officials claim Ninnemann made in
grant requests.
   The case was investigated by the Department of Health and Human
Services' inspector general and the Office of Scientific Integrity
at NIH.
   Under the Civil War-era law, citizens may file suit on behalf of
the government to pursue allegations of fraud. The law allows the
government to intervene and take over the prosecution of the
lawsuit if it determines the allegations have merit.
   The citizens who bring successful False Claim Act suits
typically receive 15 percent of a judgment.

   ``O Arabs, O Moslems, O believers in God wherever you are. This
is your day to rise and spread quickly in order to defend Mecca,
which is captive of the spears of the Americans and the Zionist,''
_ President Saddam Hussein, Iraq.
   
   ``Burn the soil under their feet. Burn the soil under the feet
of the aggressors and invaders who want harm for your families in
Iraq.
   ``Hit their interests wherever they are, rescue holy Mecca and
rescue the grave of the prophet (Mohammed, at Medina),'' _
President Saddam Hussein, Iraq.
   ``The choice in front of us is clear: an Arab act that will
preserve higher Arab interests in both Iraq and Kuwait, or a
foreign intervention in which we will have no say or control.'' _
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
   
   ``I just put it to you: What does it look like? What does it
sound like? This reminds me of the 1930s, and we have learned from
history.'' _ Prince Bandar bin Sultan, Saudi Arabia's ambassador to
the United States.
   
   ``I do not believe the involvement in hostilities is imminent;
to the contrary, it is my belief that this deployment will
facilitate a peaceful resolution to the crisis.'' _ President
George Bush.

<TEXT>
   The first gorilla twins born alive in
captivity in the Western Hemisphere will be permanently separated
next week when one is shipped to a Nebraska zoo.
   Mosuba and Macombo II have not been separated since their birth
on Oct. 26, 1983, according to Columbus Zoo officials. The pair are
believed to be the only known surviving gorilla twins.
   Mosuba, the firstborn, will be sent on Tuesday to the Henry
Doorly Zoo in Omaha, Neb. His brother, Macombo II, will remain at
the Columbus Zoo.
   The twins are the offspring of Oscar and Bridgette, a breeding
loan from the Omaha zoo.
   When officials learned that Bridgette was expecting twins, the
zoos agreed to treat the ownership as if they were separate births.
Under the agreement, the Omaha zoo would own the firstborn and
Columbus would take the second.
   The zoos agreed the gorillas should remain together in their
early years. They lived here until they were 4 years old and
visited Omaha for several months each year.
   While there has been some discussion that separating them could
be traumatic, zoo keepers believe it is safe.
   ``They are fairly independent right now,'' and often play with
other gorillas, said keeper Beth Armstrong. ``But they are
obviously very good buddies. I think gorillas are really
adaptable.''

<HEAD>Jimmy Hoffa's Former Lawyer Convicted of Tax Evasion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jimmy Hoffa's attorney was convicted of
federal tax-evasion charges for failing to report money he made
from a proposed movie about the former Teamsters boss.
   Frank Ragano, 66, said he would appeal Thursday's conviction on
two tax evasion counts, which could bring a sentence of 10 years in
prison and $200,000 in fines. He was freed on bail pending
sentencing.
   Ragano was convicted in U.S. District Court of failing to report
$83,000 income on his 1982 tax return and $24,000 in income the
following year. Prosecutors said the ploy helped Ragano avoid
paying $24,199 in taxes.
   The money came from investors who bought shares of the profits
Ragano stood to receive from ``The Life and Death of Jimmy Hoffa.''
   Ragano represented Hoffa for 15 years and formed a partnership
with a Washington screenwriter to produce the movie. The project
was later sold to a production company, but was never made.
   Ragano contends the March 1989 indictment resulted from his
representation of Hoffa and the late Santo Trafficante Jr., a
reputed Tampa crime boss. Ragano claimed prosecutors once offered
to withhold the indictment if he provided information against
Trafficante's associates.
   Ragano was also convicted of tax fraud in 1974 and suspended by
the Florida Bar for five years.
   Hoffa, who once led the international Teamsters union, vanished
15 years ago. Federal investigators have said he was probably
murdered.

<HEAD>Families Leave Homes After Sandblasting That Caused Lead
Contamination</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LYNN, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sandblasting on a bridge raised large amounts
of lead dust that contaminated the homes of 11 families, who had to
be evacuated to hotels until their homes can be cleaned, a city
official said Friday.
   City Health Inspector Jim Wilson said residents near the
sandblasting project at the Shepard bridge had been exposed to the
toxic lead dust from paint for three weeks.
   The families, including 15 children, were moved to hotels
Thursday.
   ``It's a pain and a nightmare,'' said Guy Vangelist, speaking
from a hotel where he was staying with his wife and three children.
   The sandblasting was stopped one week ago after the health
department found lead contamination levels of more than 27,000
micrograms per square foot on interior surfaces in some nearby
homes.
   Levels of more than 800 micrograms per square foot on any
surface are considered unsafe, according to state Public Health
Department regulations.
   The time needed to get test results, the reluctance of some
families to move and difficulty in finding hotels accounted for
delays in getting the people out, Wilson said. ``Everything is
being done that can be done,'' he said.
   Wilson, trained in lead paint inspections, said lead poisoning
can cause serious health problems, especially in children.
   The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, which hired J.F.
White to sandblast the bridge, said the contractor erred by not
determining if the paint on the bridge contained lead.
   J.F. White declined ti comment, referring queries to the MBTA.
However, the contractor hired Lead Busters, which specializes in
removing lead, to clean the houses. J.F. White also paid for the
hotel rooms.
   Lead Busters said the homes could be habitable by next Thursday,
depending on the amount of work to be done.

   Radio host Casey Kasem, whose Lebanese
heritage prompts him to speak out frequently on Arab issues, says
sending American troops to the Middle East could provoke another
Vietnam.
   ``Let's not provoke another Vietnam by sending troops and having
an accident turn into a catastrophe,'' Kasem said Thursday before
taping another of his weekly shows, ``Casey's Top 40 With Casey
Kasem,'' heard on more than 450 stations. ``Gunboat diplomacy is
not what the '90s is all about. Shooting from the hip is not what
the '90s is about. It's the age of reason.''
   The disc jockey called for diplomatic efforts to resolve the
crisis brought about by Saddam Hussein's decision to invade Kuwait.
Several thousand American troops are already on Saudi Arabian soil,
and sources said the U.S. deployment could involve as many as
250,000 troops if war imperiled Saudi oil fields.
   ``Why can't they do it man-to-man? Our president should call
Saddam and ask him what his intentions are,'' he said.
   Kasem, who is also the host of the syndicated ``America's Top
10'' TV show, has been outspoken on Arab issues in the past,
including protesting deportation proceedings against local
Palestinians.

   A tired looking President Bush began
a crisis-clouded, 25-day vacation Friday saying he did not want to
``be held hostage in the White House to events.''
   Bush said he believes Americans would be sympathetic to his
decision to leave Washington as U.S. forces move into the turbulent
Persian Gulf region. ``I'm determined that life goes on,'' he said.
   Accompanied by his wife, Barbara, he flew to their oceanside
home, but said he could return to Washington on short notice if
necessary.
   ``It's very easy to go back,'' Bush said, noting it is only a
1{-hour flight to the capital.
   Immediatly on his arrival, Bush went fishing for a couple hours
on his racing boat, Fidelity. The excursion was interrupted by a
shore-to-ship telephone call from Brent Scowcroft, his national
security adviser, concerning the Arab League's decision to send
troops to Saudi Arabia and to impose economic sanctions against
Iraq.
   ``I think the American people want to see life go on, so long as
they understand that their president and his top officials are on
top of a troubled situation,'' Bush told reporters.
   Bush has ordered a major deployment of U.S. troops, planes and
ships to the gulf area in response to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and
the possibility that Saddam Hussein's army would continue on into
oil-rich Saudi Arabia.
   Explaining Bush's decision to go to Kennebunkport, White House
press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said, ``Our forces are going to be
in a defensive manner. It's not a conflict.''
   The president appeared fatigued after long days of monitoring
the crisis. Bush met at the White House with foreign policy
advisers and Defense Secretary Dick Cheney before leaving.
   The White House originally said Bush was taking extra staff with
him but Fitzwater said on Friday that was not the case.
   White House chief of staff John Sununu was heading for vacation
in his home state of New Hampshire. Vice President Dan Quayle was
preparing for a vacation in Arizona.
   Scowcroft, Bush's national security adviser and frequent golf
companion in Maine, remained behind at the White House.
   The top officials accompanying Bush were Robert Gates, onetime
deputy director of the CIA and now Scowcroft's deputy; Andrew Card,
the chief deputy to Sununu, and Fitzwater.
   Bush is to remain in Maine until Labor Day, Sept. 3.
   Bush said this vacation ``will be different'' from previous
stays when he devoted himself to golf, fishing, tennis and other
recreation.
   ``It will be legitimately a combination of work and play,'' the
president said. ``What you don't want to do is appear to held
hostage in the White House to events.''
   He spoke with reporters on Air Force One en route to Maine. The
president is expected to break away on Wednesday to return to
Washington for a day of briefings and then head back to
Kennebunkport.
   Bush said Americans should know that his estate is equipped with
a complex and effective communications system that will allow him
to be in close touch with administration officials and with other
world leaders.
   ``I will have a busy schedule, busier than I would have liked to
have had,'' he said.
   He said Secretary of State James A. Baker III, after visiting
Turkey and attending a NATO meeting in Brussels, was expected to
fly to Maine over the weekend to brief him.
   ``If I find matters seem to be requiring my going back, it's an
hour-and-a-half to go,'' he said.
   Bush's oceanfront home at Walker's Point has its own helipad,
and is heavily protected on land by the Secret Service and at sea
by Coast Guard ships.
   Bush has gone to Kennebunkport every summer of his life except
1944, when he was in the Pacific flying bombing missions for the
Navy against the Japanese in World War II.

   The military hospital ship USNS Comfort will
sail Saturday from Baltimore on the first leg of a trip to support
troops in the Middle East, the Navy said Friday.
   The ship will be staffed with nearly 1,200 doctors and other
personnel from the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Md.
All elective surgery at the 350-bed military hospital was suspended
Friday in anticipation of the ship's deployment.
   The ship will head to Norfolk, Va., on Saturday to pick up
supplies, said Margaret Holtz, a spokeswoman for the Military
Sealift Command, which controls the ship in domestic ports.
   From there, Holtz said, it will sail ``in support of Operation
Desert Shield,'' the military's name for the deployment of U.S.
troops to protect Saudi Arabia from attack by Iraq.
   Spokesman H.B. Auld said Bethesda would be on a ``reduced
status.''
   Comfort is one of two floating hospitals operated by the Navy.
The other, the USNS Mercy, is docked in Oakland, Calif.
   If either ship puts to sea in response to the American buildup
of forces on the Arabian peninsula, it will be the first time that
Navy hospital ship has been activated fully since the Vietnam War.
   The Comfort, commissioned as a hospital ship in 1986, is a
converted San Clemente class tanker. It is 894 feet long, 105 feet
wide and is equipped with 1,000 hospital beds.
   Medical facilities on board include surgical suites, intensive
care wards and equipment, and general wards. Unlike most ships, it
has wide, hospital-style stairways and hallways to accommodate easy
transfer of patients.
   For emergency medical care, the ship has the best available of
everything, Auld said.
   ``It can do everything from treating a hang-nail to major
surgery,'' he said.
   The ship is normally staffed by 1,000 medical and logistic
workers. These would include doctors of virtually every speciality,
dentists, corpsmen and nurses. The ship itself is run by 80
civilian workers who man the vessel constantly, even while it is in
port.
   Comfort's wide decks will accommodate helicopters, making it
possible to bring wounded or injured service directly to the vessel
from a combat zone.
   Normally, the Comfort would provide immediate, lifesaving care.
Once an injury or wound is stabilized, the patient is shifted to
permanent hospitals on shore.

<HEAD>NABET Union To Challenge NBC In Court</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A major union at NBC said Friday it probably
will go to court to fight the network's ``final'' offer that the
company plans to put into effect on Wednesday.
   The decision by the National Association of Broadcast Employees
and Technicians was made Thursday after NBC rejected the union's
bid to resume negotiations with a federal mediator present, a union
spokesman said.
   ``NBC's position is that we've had a number of meetings over
seven months and there has been ample opportunity to discuss key
issues,'' said Betty Hudson, an NBC spokeswoman. ``The contract is
on the table and we have no intention of modifying it.''
   There will be no salary increases when NBC puts the contract
into effect because union members haven't ratified it, she said.
``They'll operate under the old wage provisions until we have a
ratified contract.
   NBC's previous contract with NABET expired March 31. Union
members have twice rejected NBC contract offers.
   When NBC implements its new four-year contract, ``it appears
that we'll be countering with every legal means at our disposal,''
said the union's spokesman, John Krieger.
   This means a court challenge of NBC's action, said Krieger,
whose union says it has 2,373 members at NBC, 1,300 of them
engineers.
   Major issues in the dispute include jurisdiction, daily hires
and NBC's proposals to let outside producers rent its facilities to
make new programs without union members employed by NBC.
   No walkout is imminent. The union's members, who struck NBC for
17 weeks in 1987, have not taken a strike vote, Krieger said.
   NABET members work at NBC and NBC-owned facilities here and in
Burbank, Calif.; Washington; Cleveland;and Chicago.

   SADDAM HUSSEIN _ Iraq's president since an internal purge in
1979, the 53-year-old Saddam has a background in conspiracy and
violence in the Baath party underground of the 1950s. Saddam
established a ruthless dictatorship which brought the longest
period of stability to a coup-plagued country. After he came to
power as strongman behind Gen. Ahmed Hasan al-Bakr as nominal,
figurehead president in 1968 some 50 high military and civilian
officials were executed. Twelve years later he launched the Persian
Gulf war against Iran, thinking he would quickly vanquish his enemy
because of the revolutionary chaos in Iran. He miscalculated, and
the war halted in a stalemate in 1988, leaving both countries
ruined. But Iraq's war machine was built into the mightiest in the
Arab Middle East and easily overran Kuwait on Aug. 2. Like many
Arab leaders, Saddam has survived several assassination attempts.

   SHEIK JABER AL-AHMED AL-SABAH _ The 62-year-old emir of Kuwait
came to power in 1977 after a dozen years as crown prince and prime
minister. In order to lessen Kuwait's dependence on oil revenues,
Sheik Jaber spearheaded the country's diversification and oversaw
its huge overseas investment program. Kuwait has invested about
$100 billion outside the country, partly in a ``Future Generations
Fund.'' By 1990, Kuwait was making more money from its investments
overseas than from its oil sales, but the border dispute with Iraq
remained unresolved. The now-deposed emir's family ruled Kuwait
since 1756. The family allowed democratic elections twice, but
dissolved Parliament due to harsh critcism of ministers from the
Al-Sabah family.

   KING FAHD IBN ABDEL-AZIZ _ The 70-year-old Saudi Arabian monarch
is the sixth son of King Abdel-Aziz ibn Saud, the founder of the
kingdom. Fahd, who has ruled since 1982, heads a royal family of
4,000 princes who are the cement that holds the kingdom together.
He is believed to the the world's second-richest person, with his
worth estimated at $18 billion in 1988 _ second only to the Sultan
of Brunei, said to be worth several billion more. But the title he
cherishes is Guardian of the Two Holy Shrines, which is how he is
always referred to inside the kingdom. His highest duty is to
preserve Mecca and Medina, sites of the annual hajj or Moslem
pilgrimage.

<TEXT>
   HOSNI MUBARAK _ The president of Egypt, a 62-year-old former
fighter pilot and later air force commander, was chosen by the late
President Anwar Sadat as his vice-president in 1975. Unlike his
predecessor, he eschews grand gestures such as Sadat's shock visit
to Jerusalem in 1977. Caution has been the hallmark of Mubarak's
rule. The president suffered a slight hand wound in the Moslem
fundamentalist fusillade that killed Sadat in October 1981. Mubarak
moved to recover Egypt's traditional position as political and
military anchor of the Arab world, a position it lost after the
1979 peace treaty with Israel. The Egyptian president has been at
the forefront of diplomatic efforts to end the crisis triggered by
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.

<TEXT>
   KING HUSSEIN _ Jordan's monarch took power in 1953 as a
teen-ager and has survived the tempests of Middle East politics and
numerous assassination attempts to emerge as a world statesman. The
54-year-old Hussein faced down a leftist-inspired rebellion in the
1950s, rode out the 1967 defeat by Israeli forces that robbed him
of the West Bank, and crushed Palestinian fighters in the 1970
``Black September'' civil war. Following four days of
anti-government rioting in April 1989, Hussein launched a
liberalization drive that gave Jordan one of the Arab world's
freest presses and most open parliaments. In 1978 he married Lisa
Halaby, the Lebanese-American daughter of an airline executive. She
took the name Queen Noor.

<TEXT>
   HAFEZ ASSAD _ The 59-year-old Syrian president, until recently
holding the title as Israel's most feared enemy, seized power in a
bloodless coup in 1970. He is Saddam Hussein's sworn enemy in the
Arab world: Syria is ruled by a rival branch of the Arab Baath
Socialist Party that also reigns in Baghdad. He supported Iran in
the eight-year war against Iraq, to the annoyance of most Arab
states. A peasant boy from a minority Moslem sect, he rose against
great odds to become commander of the air force, and later,
president. His declared ambition is to achieve ``strategic parity''
with Israel and regain the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights. In 1976
he sent Syrian troops into Lebanon, and 40,000 of them remain. He
suffered a heart attack in November 1983 and cut down on his heavy
schedule and stopped smoking.

<TEXT>
   YASSER ARAFAT _ Chief of the Palestine Liberation Organiation,
the stocky unshaven onetime gun-runner has used both violence and
diplomacy to push his Palestinian people's cause to the forefront
of world attention. The 61-year-old, Egyptian-educated civil
engineer co-founded the Fatah guerrilla movement in Kuwait in 1959.
His group rose to prominence through its guerrilla attacks on
Israel in the 1960s, and Fatah eventually became the mainstream PLO
faction. In 1988 he got the Palestine National Council, the PLO's
parliament in exile, to endorse resolutions that proclaimed the
independent state of Palestine and explicitly recognized the state
of Israel. He also renounced terrorism and the United States
initiated a dialogue with the PLO, broken off earlier this year
after an abortive raid by a PLO faction against Israeli beaches.

   MOAMMAR GADHAFI _ The mercurial, 52-year-old Libyan leader
ousted King Idris in a 1969 coup and soon sought to acquire the
mantle of his hero, the late President Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt,
as leader of Arab nationalism. Under Gadhafi, Libya became
notorious for its support for international terrorism and its
leader famous for his maverick ways. Born to a family of nomads,
Gadhafi often lives in a tent and has a dazzling wardrobe of
traditional and more way-out costume that is a fixture at Arab
summits. President Ronald Reagan ordered a bombing raid on Tripoli
in 1986 after the United States accused Libya of backing a terror
attack on Americans. More recently Washington has accused Libya of
building a poison-gas factory, a charge it denies.

<TEXT>
   KING HASSAN II _ The 61-year-old Moroccan monarch is a wily,
pro-Western leader who often strikes independent positions in the
Arab world. Morocco and neighbor Algeria were the first Arab states
to openly condemn Baghdad's invasion of Kuwait. Like his Jordanian
counterpart he has been a frequent assassination target, and also
like Hussein he claims to be a descendant of the Prophet Mohammed.
Hassan, a French-speaking cosmopolitan, has pursued an independent
course, breaking Arab taboos by meeting with Israeli leaders.
Moroccans say the king has ``baraka,'' or the blessing of God.
Despite internal unrest in the early days of his reign, which began
in 1961, the Moroccan monarch has become something of an elder
statesman in the Arab world.

   A young Kuwaiti who fled her country said
Friday that young men who stayed have been running an
``underground'' resistance to the Iraqi invasion force.
   The group has led Kuwaiti efforts to stay away from work,
collect garbage and run food collectives, said the woman on
condition of anonymity.
   ``They have decided that only the service utilities will go on
working for the sake of the population and everyone is obeying. But
otherwise no one obeys orders from the Iraqi forces to work,'' said
the young Arab woman, who worked in a Kuwaiti bank and stole across
the border into Saudi Arabia early Friday.
   Local telephones, bakers, electricity, water, gasoline stations
were listed among the services operating.
   There was, she said, ``a secret code of how to conduct life and
we are adhering to it ... Everything is organized. And that gives
us strength.''
   The Iraqis were able to coerce the Asians or workers from other
Arab countries, who often are too poor to think of leaving, she
said. ``But there is no way that Kuwaitis will cooperate with
them.''
   The woman said they were organizing teams to collect garbage, or
to run the food cooperatives.
   Some of the young men had rushed to Kaifan and Shuwaikh, where
there were military barracks close to the borders, seized arms
stocks there and began military resistance. But they were
outmatched by the Iraqis who have some 120,000 soldiers and 350
tanks inside the country.
   The sporadic acts of resistance against the Iraqis are still on
a small scale. ``But we are confident they would develop if they
have to, and many, many would be volunteering from inside the
country and from outside,'' she said.
   Among acts of the developing resistance are graffiti on
buildings saying ``No One But Jaber,'' she said.
   Jaber is the name of the emir, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah,
who fled the country during the invasion.
   ``We did not know the emir was alive until we heard his voice on
Saudi television on Sunday. It was like God's hand was balming us,
and the most terrific morale booster,'' the woman said.
   Kuwaiti women stage demonstrations. The Iraqi soldiers let them
be, as long as they just chant ``God, country, the emir.'' But once
they start ``Death to Saddam!'' the Iraqis start firing in the air,
she said.
   Because many of the women are elderly, some of them fainted at
the sound of the guns in a demonstration on Tuesday, travelers
reaching Bahrain said.
   The Iraqis tried to dress like the Kuwaitis, fellow Arabs, in
taking over key administrative jobs, or running television
programs, according to the woman.
   ``Non-Arab foreigners can't tell the difference, but we know
immediately from the accent. And it is so depressing.''
   ``We can go on living, but we just have to keep our nerves in
the icebox,'' she said.
   The young woman, her sister and a friend, like many others, had
to depend on a driver who knew his way about the borders.
   and make a dash for it across the desert if they saw Iraqi
soldiers approaching.
   If Iraqi soldiers spot someone heading for the border, ``They
shoot first at the tires, then they stop you and come breaking up
the car, taking occupants out,'' said Mariam Marzooq, a Bahraini
executive for an American financial institution.
   ``There were so many destroyed cars along the borders. I don't
know what they do with the occupants. We succeeded in making it.''
   They said U.S. and Western embassies were harboring remaining
foreigners or keeping close in touch. Ms. Marzooq said at least two
Americans, a Briton, and 300 Austrians remained in Kuwait.

<TEXT>
   A majority of Arab League nations agreed
Friday to send Arab troops to protect Saudi Arabia from Iraqi
aggression, approved economic sanctions against Baghdad and
condemned the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
   The moves were by far the strongest Arab steps against Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein since the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   Iraq, a league member, denounced the measures and vowed that
Baghdad would stand by its annexation of Kuwait.
   Of 20 Arab League member states present, 12 supported the
seven-point resolution. Libya, the Palestine Liberation
Organization and Iraq voted against the package, Algeria and Yemen
abstained, and Tunis was absent. Three governments _ Jordan, Sudan
and Mauritania _ expressed reservations and took no position.
   Egypt's representative to the United Nations, Amr Moussa, told
reporters details of the deployment of the Arab force would be
worked out in contacts coordinated by the League's secretary,
General Chadli Klibi.
   Mufid Shehab, head of the international law department at Cairo
University's faculty of law, told reporters that according to the
Arab League charter, the resolutions were binding only on the
members who voted for them.
   Those nations include Egypt and Syria, which have the largest
Arab armies in the Middle East after Iraq.
   Moussa said Iraq's representative, Deputy Premier Taha Yassin
Ramadan, ``opposed and rejected the whole thing.''
   The gathering of Arab presidents and kings had been hastily
convened with the goal of finding a diplomatic solution to the
Persian Gulf crisis in order to stave off foreign intervention.
   The session quickly turned stormy. Conference sources said a
shouting match broke out between delegations from Iraq and the
Kuwait government it ousted. During the heated argument, the
Kuwaiti foreign minister collapsed, the sources said.
   The proposals endorsed by the Arab leaders were drafted by Arab
League foreign ministers. It was not clear whether an Arab force
would join the multinational force already deployed in Saudi
Arabia, though the summit resolution seemed implicitly to endorse
the U.S.-led force.
   The package is the toughest the Arab League's leaders ever
ordered against an Arab country in the organization's 45-year
history. It marked a major diplomatic achievement for Egypt's
President Hosni Mubarak, who called the summit to counter Saddam's
growing belligerence against his neighbors.
   Conference sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
that during the debate, Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz spoke out
harshly against the proposals and repeated Iraq's insistence it
would not withdraw from Kuwait.
   As the ministers were meeting, Saddam called on Arabs to
overthrow the Saudi royal family and attack Western powers,
including the United States, that have sent forces to defend Saudi
Arabia.
   The troop-deployment measure cited a 1950 Arab mutual defense
pact that says an armed attack on one Arab League member
constitutes aggression against them all.
   The delegates also cited the U.N. charter's authorization of
joint military action to restore peace.
   ``We have decided to respond to the request by Saudi Arabia and
other gulf states to deploy Arab forces to support the armed forces
there to defend its lands and its regional security against any
foreign attack,'' the document said.
   The Arab leaders also supported ``the procedures taken by Saudi
Arabia and other Arab Gulf countries ... as part of their
legitimate right for self-defense.''
   That statement was seen as an endorsement of the request for
Western military help in the face of the Iraqi buildup.
   The Middle East News Agency said the Kuwaiti official who
collapsed _ Foreign Minister Sabah al-Ahmed al-Jaber _ returned to
the meeting later after resting at his hotel.
   Kuwait's ousted emir, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, whose
family ruled Kuwait for more than 230 years before being ousted by
the Iraqis, was present for the morning session. He sat two
delegations over from the grim-faced Iraqi delegation.
   One of the two pool reporters allowed in the meeting hall said
the 62-year-old emir looked ``terribly depressed. He looked as
though he was near collapse.''
   Before the afternoon session, the emir returned to Saudi Arabia,
his home in exile, leaving his delegation to speak for him.
   As the conference opened, Egyptian President Mubarak warned that
unless Arab states could unite to resolve the crisis, foreign
powers would act. Thousands of U.S. troops have already moved into
Saudi Arabia to protect the oil-rich desert kingdom from Iraqi
attack.
   ``The choice in front of us is clear,'' Mubarak said, ``an Arab
act that will preserve higher Arab interests and both Iraq and
Kuwait, or a foreign intervention in which we will have no say or
control.''
   The Arab League conference had been scheduled to begin Thursday
night but was delayed until Friday, reportedly because of a dispute
over who would represent Kuwait _ the Iraqi-installed government or
exiled ruler.
   The Arab League had 22 members until May, when the merger of
North Yemen and South Yemen lowered membership to 21. They are
Algeria, Bahrain, Djibouti, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon,
Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia,
Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, the United Arab Emirates, Yemen and the
Palestine Liberation Organization, now officially listed as
Palestine.

<TEXT>
   A former top aide to U.S. Attorney
General Dick Thornburgh was indicted Friday on charges of using
cocaine while employed by the Justice Department and lying to
federal officials about his alleged drug use.
   Former U.S. Justice Department lawyer Henry Barr was charged
with one count of cocaine possession, two counts of making false
statements and one count of conspiracy.
   A federal grand jury in Harrisburg returned the indictment
against Barr. It was the latest in a series of problems among
long-time associates of Thornburgh who followed him to the Justice
Department from Pennsylvania.
   Barr, of suburban Harrisburg, was general counsel to Thornburgh
when he was governor of Pennsylvania and later was assistant to
Thornburgh when he became attorney general in 1988. He resigned
from the Justice Department in May 1989.
   The indictment is the first of a public official stemming from a
15-month federal probe.
   According to the indictment, Barr allegedly lied on a federal
form that asked if he used or provided illegal drugs within the
last five years and repeated the false statement in a subsequent
interview with the FBI. He is also accused of using cocaine at a
suburban Harrisburg home on April 8, 1989, about a month before he
resigned from the Justice Department.
   The government also alleges that ``Barr conspired with others to
obtain, possess, and use cocaine and to conceal his cocaine
involvement from outside scrutiny.''
   If convicted on all counts, Barr, 47, could face up to 12 years
in jail and fines of $510,000. The false statement counts are both
felonies.
   Barr could not be reached for comment Friday afternoon. No one
answered the telephone at his Mechanicsburg home. But his lawyer,
Charles F. Scarlata, said in a statement that Barr would plead
innocent to the charges.
   ``The decision to bring the charges is particularly egregious
since Mr. Barr did not seek the position but rather was asked to
sacrifice his partnership in a large Harrisburg law firm, leave his
family and go to Washington, D.C.,'' Scarlata said.
   ``The ultimate irony here is there is not even a suggestion from
any source that Mr. Barr performed his duties in other than a
thoroughly professional, honest, competent and loyal manner,'' the
statement said.
   Thornburgh said in a statement he had recused himself from the
case upon learning of the allegations.
   He called the indictment ``a personal tragedy for Henry Barr,''
whom he described as ``a capable lawyer who devoted many years of
his career to public service.''
   ``I have no knowledge of the particular circumstances of this
case,'' he said. ``It is now up to the judge and jury to determine
the facts of this case and their consequences for Mr. Barr,''
Thornburgh said.
   The indictment came less than two weeks after Sen. Arlen
Specter, R-Pa., asked the Justice Department to appoint a special
prosecutor in the case. Scarlata also called for a special
prosecutor, saying in a letter last week that he welcomed a review
by a ``prosecutor whose judgments are not driven by media
attention.''
   Thornburgh and a number of top Justice Department officials had
bowed out of the investigation, as did U.S. Attorney James West.
West's chief assistant, Gordon A.D. Zubrod, has been assigned to
prosecute the case.
   In May, Thornburgh reassigned two top aides _ press secretary
David Runkel and his chief of staff, Robert S. Ross Jr. _ to less
sensitive positions after it was disclosed that they had showed
deception on FBI polygraph tests.
   Last month, Barry H. Stern, an associate deputy attorney
general, resigned from the Justice Department when his temporary
security clearance was revoked.
   All three men served under Thornburgh when he was governor.
Stern was labor and industry secretary, Runkel was his press
secretary and Ross was a special assistant.

   Here is a transcript of President
Bush's news conference with reporters accompanying him to his
summer home in Kennebunkport, Maine.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Q: Hello, Mr. President.
   Q: What's your reaction to Saddam Hussein calling for a holy war?
   A: It's not unexpected. He is so isolated in the world, so much
backed into a corner by world opinion, which is almost 100 percent
against him, that he has to find some mechanism to try to rally
support. And it's _ it won't work. And his problem is in the Arab
world, in the Muslim world, as well as it is in the rest of the
world. So it's a rather frantic ploy to try to gather some support.
But it's going to be ineffective. It will not work.
   Q: Mr. President _
   Q: Mr. President are you hearing anything out of the Arab summit
that encourages you?
   A: Haven't got any reports yet from the Arab summit one way or
another.
   Q: Mr. President, are you confident there are enough American
troops already in Saudi Arabia to be able to withstand any sort of
assault? Basically, do you think American troops can _ would be
able to win?
   A: To be able to withstand an assault on Saudi Arabia? Well, I
think _
   Q: Immediately.
   A: Huh?
   Q: Immediately, it happened _
   A: Well, there's no evidence of _ right now that Saddam Hussein
would be foolish enough to cross that border, but we have
implemented the air power out there, air forces. Saudi has strong
air power. Some of the Kuwaiti air force is there in Saudi Arabia.
Other elements will be there. We have a carrier there. So I think
there would _ I think that our fighting men that are on the ground
there will be safe.
   But I don't want to heighten concern, because I've seen _ they
have not presented me with any evidence that the troops that have
already been moved forward are being reinforced or that they are
preparing to move across the Saudi border.
   Q: ir, because of all the number of troops that are obviously
now leaving the United States _ (inaudible). Can you give us more
of an idea of the time _ (inaudible) _ and how long you think
they'll be there _ the American people _ (inaudible)?
   A: No. They haven't even gotten there yet, so I can't estimate
how long it'll be. I might say, since you mention the American
people, in asking them how long they'll _ you know, how long they
should be supported, I am very pleased with the strong support for
what we've done from the American people, indeed, from around the
world. I think it's been very gratifying, and I think it means that
people understand that this aggression cannot go unchallenged.
   So, in terms of the numbers, I'd prefer not to go into that. I
never believe that it's good to pinpoint numbers of forces, and
that's, of course, the way Dick Cheney and General Powell conducted
themselves. So, I can't give you any help on that right now, and
I'm not going to even give you any estimates on it right now. But,
it will be a substantial force. And others will be coming in with
more forces, too.
   Q: (Inaudible) _ the sizable numbers of ground troops _
   Q: (Inaudible) _ all of their equipment suggests preparation for
an extensive capability on the ground. Can you enlighten us? Is
that your plan? (inaudible) _ suggests that you're preparing for
something other than a _ (inaudible).
   A: Listen, I'd love to see the economic sanctions be so
successful that the forces could be withdrawn. But _ and I think
they will be successful. But I just can't _ my problem is I just
can't estimate the time right now, how long it will take. But there
will be substantial force. There will be enough force to _ so that
Americans are protected from unwarranted attack, and it won't be
just US forces and Saudi forces.

   Q: Mr. President, there have been reports already of violence
against foreigners _ (inaudible) _ Kuwait and Baghdad. A woman was
raped on a bus _ (inaudible). Are you prepared to do anything to
ensure the safety of the 3,600 Americans in Kuwait and Iraq?
   A: Well, I view that as a prime responsibility, but you're
right. There have been very disturbing reports of violence against
citizens of all _ of several countries. And there was a report of a
British Airlines stewardess having been violated and humiliated by
Iraq soldiers. And there are scattered reports, but I will say that
it's not just against Americans, but I think all countries are
concerned about the safety of their citizens.
   And part of any planning has to be about how to protect
citizens. Now, we all know the difficulties of that if somebody is
_ does violence like has already taken place, as a matter of fact.
So, it worries me because I do view it as a prime responsibility,
but I would say, you know, I'm not going to go beyond that and I'm
not going to invite further harassment by elevating the value of
any citizen.
   Q: You mean you're helpless?
   A: I'm not _ we're not helpless, no. But, as we've seen with
hostage situations, and I don't think this is one, sometimes it's
very difficult.
   Q: Mr. President, how can you read Saddam's call for jihad? Is
this just rhetoric or _
   A: Yeah, it's rhetorical because he's backed into a corner. He's
been isolated by the rest of the world. Nobody supports him. And
so, he's trying to rally Arab support generally. The problem he's
got is most of the Arab countries violently disapprove of what he's
done. But he doesn't have many options, so he's resorting to
radical rhetoric, trying to mobilize opinion. But the _ his problem
is everybody sees through this. Everybody around the world will see
through this rhetoric.
   Q: (Off mike) _ Arab leaders are meeting again today in Cairo.
Are you frustrated that they haven't moved forward as of yet and
actually done something?
   A: No. No, I think it's going well, and my talks with Arab
leaders have been very supportive. But they're _ it's the right
thing that you have an Arab meeting of this kind. I salute
President Mubarak for having stayed with the idea. The more such
meetings, the better. Maybe, just maybe, and I'm not too
optimistic, somebody can talk some sense into this man who has been
thoroughly censured by the rest of the world.
   Q: Is there no _ is there no threat from _ you say that Saddam
is _ that it's rhetoric _
   A: Yeah.
   Q: _ that he's using, but is there no danger that that kind of
rhetoric is likely to inflame the Saudi rank and file, hearing _
   A: No, I don't see any danger.
   Q: _ words like _ (inaudible) _ the holy places being turned
over to foreigners?
   A: I don't _ I think it's so extreme that people that are in
Saudi Arabia, loyal to the King _ they're not going to _ they're
not going to rise up when a cornered radical tries to mobilize
support when he has none. I mean, people see this so clearly that I
wouldn't worry about that.
   Q: Mr. President, speaking of the safety of Americans, what
about the safety of Americans outside of Iraq and Kuwait? What are
you being told about the possibility of terrorist attacks?
   A: Well, you always worry about that. As you know, I've worried
about that for a long time, long before this incident. And indeed,
Americans are still being held against their will, probably in
Lebanon. And this will continue to concern me, wherever they are,
whether it's in the Middle East or elsewhere. So, I do worry about
extremists taking extreme action.
   Q: Do you have reason to believe that is more likely now that
Saddam _
   A: No specific _ no specific reason on this case and no
intelligence that has me alarmed, but I continue to worry about it.
And we, of course, take the proper warning procedures in our
various embassies. But all you can do is make clear to people that
_ that there are these dangers.

   Q: Do you think Americans need to be careful in travelling to
others places than the Middle East?
   A: Well, I think they've always _ always been advised to be
careful of travel, but I'm not prepared to say nobody should travel
to any place in the Middle East. I'm not prepared to say that at
all.
   Q: What about outside the Middle East?
   A: I'd be careful wherever you go, these days.
   Q: Speaking of trips, did you have any concern about your own
trip to Kennebunkport, that you'll be able to stay on top of things
while you're up here _
   A: I think we're going to have a safe trip. Are you referring to
the safety of the trip?
   Q: (Off mike.)
   A: No, I can easily stay here. We have a highly complex and
highly efficient communications. I have some of my top advisers
here. Others will be coming up there from time to time. I expect to
see Jim Baker up there very soon. And I'm in very close _ I will be
in very close touch with Pentagon officials or whoever's behind
National Security Council right now, it'll be General Scowcroft.
   So I'm determined to _ that life goes on. I will have a busy
schedule _ busier than I'd like to have had _ of contacts. In fact,
I've got a list of calls that I'll be making over the next couple
of days _ not all to the Middle East, incidentally. And so it'll be
a little different than I'd hoped but I think I'm doing the right
thing.
   I think the American people want to see life go on so long as
they understand that their President and his top officials are on
top of a troubled situation. So, that's the way I looked at it. And
if I find it gets _ matters seem to be _ require my going back,
it's an hour and a half to go back. So, I think we're in pretty
good shape on that.
   Q: (Off mike.)
   A: Yeah. I mean, you've seen the telephone in my golf cart, or
boat. Word of honor, well, I talked, you know _ where was it? We
talked to _ where was it when we were out in the Fidelity last time?
   STAFF: (Off mike.)
   A: No, no. No, no, well, that was one, yeah, that was one. But,
no, the other day we were out in _ and talked overseas, I believe
it was, but in any event, I think it's _ I should reassure the
American people that the communication is extraordinarily good. And
if I found that I needed meetings with these top officials or with
foreign officials and it would be more convenient to do it in
Washington, it's very easy to go back.
   Q: Any concern _ (inaudible) _ Mr. President?
   A: No. I think the American people will support what I'm _ you
mean on this?
   Q: You're going _ you're on a vacation at the same time as
   _
   A: No, not at all.
   Q: Thank you.
   A: When I'm going to be working _ normally, you know, what I've
said is, ``Look, if I'm on vacation, I want to have a vacation, and
I don't want to try to kid the American people that I'm working _
play and play hard and then work like hell the rest of the time
when you're in Washington.'' And I think I've done that. Go to work
early in the morning, go home late at night.
   This one will be different because there are some tasks that I
must undertake up here, but _ so, it'll be a little _ it'll be
legitimately a combination of work and play, but I don't want to
deceive the American people. Just tell them what you think and ask
for their support. And I think people will understand that. So,
that's the way _ that's the way I approach this.
   You know, what you don't want to do is appear to be held hostage
in the White House to events. And I'm not going to do that. That's
why we have all this sophisticated intelligence. So, I feel all
right about it.

   Saddam Hussein urged Arabs on Friday to
join in a holy war to sweep from power the Saudi royal family,
seize the Moslem holy shrines in Saudi Arabia and block U.S.
warships sent to defend the kingdom.
   Saddam's defiant call to take back the Moslem shrines signaled
his intentions are broader than the annexation of Kuwait. His
rhetoric aimed at presenting himself as a champion of Arabs and
Moslems everywhere.
   By inviting U.S. troops to protect Saudi Arabia, the Saudi
leaders ``are not only defying the Arab and Islamic nations ... but
are challenging God the day they put Mecca and the tomb of Mohammed
under the grip of the foreigner,'' Saddam said in a statement read
by a spokesman on television.
   ``Your brothers in Iraq are determined on holy war, without
hesitation and without any slowing down.
   ``We shall be victorious, God willing, and evil and corruption
will be trampled wherever it is, the sun will rise on the Arabs and
the Moslems and God will happy after we purify our souls and land
from the foreigners.''
   His mention of foreigners was a clear reference to American and
other Western forces in the region.
   The statement appeared directed at Arab League members meeting
in Cairo to find a diplomatic solution to the crisis caused by
Iraq's invasion Aug. 2 of Kuwait.
   Saddam has been under intense economic and military presssure
since the invasion. Thousands of U.S. troops are in Saudi Arabia as
part of a multinational force to defend the oil-rich kingdom, and a
majority of the Arab leaders voted Friday to deploy Arab troops to
Saudi soil. They also approved economic sanctions against Baghdad,
a league member.
   Saudi Arabia's ambassador in Washington, Prince Bandar bin
Sultan, ridiculed Saddam's assertion that Mecca has been defiled.
   ``It is ironic that he pulled a page from the old speeches of
Khomeini,'' Bandar added, a biting reference to the anti-Western
rhetoric of the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, Saddam's nemesis
in his eight-year war with Iran.
   ``If anybody is to be blamed for bringing multinational forces
to our region, it is the government of Iraq.''
   Bandar also called Saddam a liar, saying he personally promised
fellow Arab leaders he had no intention of attacking Kuwait.
   ``O Arabs, O Moslems, O believers in God wherever you are. This
is your day to rise and spread quickly in order to defend Mecca,
which is captive of the spears of the Americans and the Zionist,''
Saddam said.
   ``This is your day to rise quickly to defend the Prophet
Mohammed ... who carried the noble message in this noble land for
it to remain holy.''
   ``Burn the soil under their feet,'' Saddam said. ``Burn the soil
under the feet of the aggressors and invaders who want harm for
your families in Iraq.
   ``Hit their interests wherever they are, rescue holy Mecca and
rescue the grave of the prophet (Mohammed, at Medina),'' he said.
   The statement called on Egyptians to bar Western military fleets
from using the Suez Canal. He also appealed to the Persian Gulf
emirates to stop American warships, without specifying how.
   ``Don't let the enemy pass through the soil of Egypt to use your
waters, sons of the Strait of Hormuz. Stop the fleets from moving,
sons in Ras al-Khaimah and Sharjah,'' Saddam said, referring to
emirates in the southern gulf.
   The ``soil of Egypt'' was a reference to the Suez canal, and
possibly to Egyptian air bases that might be used by American
forces.
   Addressing Arabs everywhere, he called for the overthrow of the
Saudi royal family.
   ``Make it clear to your rulers, the emirs of oil, as they serve
the foreigner; tell the traitors there is no place for them on Arab
soil after they humiliated Arab honor and dignity,'' he said.
   ``The American forces came and Saudi Arabia opened its doors to
it under the false pretext that the Iraqi army will move toward
them,'' he said. ``It means there are plans for aggressive
intentions.''
   On the holy shrines at the Saudi cities of Mecca and Medina,
Saddam said: ``Arabs, Moslems, believers in God wherever you are.
This is your day to jump up and defend Mecca, hostage of the
Americans.''
   The statement was read on Baghdad television and monitored in
Bahrain and Cyprus.
   In an earlier broadcast on Iraqi radio, addressed to Arab
professional unions and ruling Baath party members, the government
said:
   ``Every free and honorable Arab is required to respond to the
call of the Arab conscience and the Arab land, and to choose the
way he deems fit to strike at U.S. interests in the Arab land if
the United States becomes bull-headed and arrogant enough to begin
a military aggression.
   ``We pledge to you, as knights, that we will make them drink
virulent poison and will deal unprecedented blows to them so that
the heads of the Arabs will remain crowned with laurels of victory
and glory.''

   SULTAN QABOOS BIN SAID _ Oman's 49-year-old leader came to power
in 1970 when he deposed his father Sultan Said bin Taimur in a
bloodless coup. His father had ruled since 1932 and kept Oman
locked in a medieval timewarp to keep his people safe from what he
considered the dangers of the modern world. In the past 20 years
Qaboos, a graduate of Britain's Sandhurst military academy, has
pulled his long-isolated country into the 20th century with an
ambitious development program. Qaboos wears a loosely tied turban
and an ankle-length white robe, and bears a khanjar _ the
distinctive curved Omani dagger _ on his waist, as well as a pistol
in his belt.

   SHEIK ZAYED BIN SULTAN AL NAHYAN _ Sheik Zayed is president of
the United Arab Emirates, formed in the 1971 merger of seven
sheikdoms in the wake of Britain's withdrawal from the Persian
Gulf. The 72-year-old leader was the chief architect of the
federation and is also the emir of Abu Dhabi, an oil-rich sheikdom.
The U.A.E. federation also includes Dubai, Sharjah, Ras al-Khaimah,
Umm al-Qawain, Fujairah and Ajman under the leadership of the
bigger and richer Abu Dhabi. For 20 formative years, until 1966,
Sheik Zayed lived with the bedouins as required by his post as
governor of the emirate's eastern province. That year, his brother
Sheik Shakhbut was overthrown in a palace coup and the Al Nahyan
family council appointed Sheik Zayed the new emir.

1976 census. Like neighboring Arab oil producers, Qatar has
diverted oil wealth into massive economic and social development

   CHADLI BENDJEDID _ Algeria's 61-year-old president, Bendjedid
ended the ruling National Liberation Front's monopoly on power in
1989 with a new constitution allowing rival political parties and
free elections. His strongest challenge comes from Islamic
fundamentalists, who swept local elections in June. Hopes of
reviving Algeria's stagnant economy have been thwarted by low oil
prices and unbalanced demographics: about three-quarters of the
country's 26 million people are younger than 30 and many are
unemployed. Formerly in charge of national defense, Bendjedid
became president in 1979 after the death of Houari Boumedienne and
moderated Algeria's pro-revolutionary foreign policy. In 1985, he
became the first Algerian leader to visit the United States.

   Heavy rains drenched the already saturated Northeast and
produced flooding in parts of New Jersey and New York on Friday
afternoon, and a tornado on New York City's Staten Island uprooted
trees and disrupted electrical service.
   Flooding closed the Saw Mill River Parkway at Saw Mill and the
Bronx River Parkway near White Plains, New York.
   There was extensive flooding at Hammonton, N.J., where more than
4 inches of rain fell Friday morning.
   Two gas lines were pulled out when trees were uprooted when the
tornado struck Staten Island, said a spokesman for Brooklyn Union
Gas. The utility shut down service along one block to stop leaks,
affecting about 50 homes.
   Consolidated Edison power lines also were knocked down, said a
company spokeswoman. The tornado started as a waterspout over Lower
New York Bay.
   Flood watches were posted over much of New Hampshire, western
portions of both Massachusetts and Rhode Island, eastern New York
and the southern half of Vermont.
   Rainshowers and thunderstorms pelted New England as well as
southeastern New York, New Jersey, eastern Pennsylvania, Maryland,
Delaware, eastern Virginia, and parts of the Carolinas.
   Showers and storms extended over western Virginia, eastern
Kentucky, eastern Tennessee, and from northwest Florida across the
Florida peninsula.
   Rainshowers and storms were scattered over northeast Oklahoma,
southeast Kansas, central Missouri, southern Illinois, northwest
Iowa, eastern Nebraska, southeastern South Dakota, and southeast
California, and from western North Dakota across Montana, northern
Idaho and eastern Washington.
   Friday morning was another cool one for the southeast portion of
the nation. Low temperature records set or tied were 61 in Atlanta,
59 in Jackson, Miss., 64 in Mobile, Ala., 67 in Pensacola, Fla.,
and 66 in Tallahassee, Fla.
   Low temperature for the Lower 48 states Friday morning was 38
degrees at Gunnison, Colo.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EDT ranged from 55 at

<HEAD>Pesticide Found In Non-Commercial Honey Eaten By Bees</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A high level of pesticide was found in honey eaten
by bees that pollinate East Coast crops, an official of the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration said Friday.
   Federal and state officials said there was no apparent
contamination of honey sold for human consumption.
   Following a complaint from beekeepers on Cape Cod, officials of
the state Department of Food and Agriculture made a routine
investigation of bee hives in Rochester and Middleboro on July 17.
They found 22 times the appropriate level of the pesticide,
fluvalinate, in one honey sample. The FDA followed up with its own
investigation.
   Fluvalinate, legal for use in hives that do not produce honey
for human consumption, is used to kill the varroa mite, which kills
bees.
   Because the heavily dosed honey was not for human consumption,
no FDA laws were broken, said John Hamilton, the FDA's New England
director of compliance.
   ``We have not instituted any nationwide testing,'' Hamilton
said, dismissing earlier reports that honey was being tested across
the country.
   Hamilton noted the contaminated honey was not eaten by humans;
it's the bees' food.
   August Schumacher, commissioner of Food and Agriculture, said
consumers were in no danger and that his agency was ensuring this
remains the case.
   ``These bees are not used to make honey for human food, they are
only used for pollination,'' Schumacher said.
   The state agriculture officials received a complaint from
beekeepers on Cape Cod that migrant beekeepers were using
fluvalinate illegally.
   The migrant beekeepers travel between the citrus orchards of
Florida to the blueberry barrens of Maine, their bees pollinating
as they go.
   The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency describes fluvalinate
as ``low to moderately toxic.'' Made by the Sandoz Crop Protection
Corp., it can cause skin, eye and throat irritation, the EPA said.
   ``We have an ongoing investigation on the use of fluvalinate to
make sure it is properly done and that no (affected) honey is sold
to the commercial markets. To the best of my knowledge, this honey
has not entered the food chain,'' Schumacher said.
   As a precaution, however, Hamilton said the FDA planned to test
honey produced by two manufacturers that used the bees from the
contaminated hive. They are Mendes Apiaries of Punta Gorda, Fla.,
and W.D. Fisher Bee Farm of McVeytown, Pa., he said.
   ``If that indicates a problem, we will in fact expand our
investigation,'' he said. ``We're not aware of any contaminated
honey that's on the market.''
   In the meantime, he said, there's no indication that consumers
should throw out their honey.

<HEAD>Canada Tries To Save Whales from Beaching Death</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHETICAMP, Nova Scotia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fisheries officials using small
boats and a helicopter tried to keep dozens of stubborn pilot
whales from returning to shore _ and certain death _ off Cape
Breton Friday.
   Several close-knit groups of about 20 whales, called pods,
stayed about 1{ miles off the west coast of Cape Breton Island
throughout the day after being coaxed back into the water Thursday,
said Tom Kiely, acting regional manager for the federal Fisheries
Department.
   At least two whales died Thursday as fisheries officials,
tourists and residents tried to rescue dozens of whales on the
beach near Cheticamp.
   Rescuers doubted that the approximately 60 who lived could
survive being stranded again because of cuts and scratches they
suffered while thrashing around in the shallow waters.
   Whale expert John Lien, a professor of animal behavior at
Memorial University in St. John's, Newfoundland, said the whales
may have beached themselves because they were about to die anyway.
   He said it is normal for pilot whales, common in the waters of
Atlantic Canada, to be involved in between three and five
strandings each year.
   The reasons remain unknown. Some believe beachings occur when a
pod follows a sick leader ashore or when subterranean geological
faults hamper their navigation.
   Pilot whales, a toothed species also called blackfish, are among
the smaller members of the whale family, growing up to 20 feet in
length and weighing up to three tons.

   President Bush declared Friday that Iraq's
Saddam Hussein had been ``backed into a corner'' by worldwide
outrage over his aggression. With Western forces gathering in the
Mideast, Bush warned Iraq against sending out oil tankers to evade
an economic embargo.
   Bush told Congress he doubted outright war was imminent, but he
also said U.S. troops would stay in Saudi Arabia as long as needed
to protect its huge oil reserves.
   A majority of Arab League nations agreed at a stormy meeting to
dispatch troops to Saudi Arabia, offering the Arab participation
Bush has fervently sought for a multinational effort to deter Iraq
from advancing from occupied Kuwait. It was unclear which nations
would participate in the deployment, which the Arab League
announcement said was in response to a Saudi government request.
   Bush kept up his verbal fire on Saddam as the administration
pressed allies for help in breaking Iraq's ``unlawful grip'' on
Kuwait. Bush said Saddam would be ``foolish'' to invade Saudi
Arabia, where a growing U.S. military force was taking up defensive
positions.
   Complicating all responses by the United States was the grim
knowledge that some 3,500 Americans remained trapped in Iraq and
Kuwait, potential pawns in what Saddam described Friday as a ``holy
war'' pitting the Arab world against the West.
   Bush called Saddam's declaration ``a rather frantic ploy to try
to gather some support'' among fellow Arabs. ``He is so isolated in
the world, so much backed into a corner by world opinion which is
almost 100 percent against him, that he has to try to find some
mechanism to try to rally support. It will not work. ... Everybody
around the world will see through this rhetoric,'' Bush said.
   The president commented aboard Air Force One as he flew to Maine
for a 25-day vacation at his Kennebunkport home. Later in the day,
White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said, ``We welcome the Arab
League statement as a positive and significant statement. We are
pleased with the very strong condemnation of Iraqi behavior and the
equally strong support for Kuwaiti sovereignty and the return of
the legitimate government.''
   As the U.S. military forces in the Mideast grew, and other U.S.
allies pledged new support to the defense of Saudi Arabia, Bush
indicated he was ready to act if Iraq tried to evade an
international embargo by shipping oil outside its borders.
   ``I would advise Iraqi ships not to go out with oil,'' he said.
   The Pentagon detailed more units involved in the buildup, but
gave no figures figures for numbers deployed: Air Force F-16
fighters from Shaw Air Force Base, S.C. and C-130 transports from
Pope Air Force Base, N.C.; the Navy hospital ships Mercy, based in
Oakland, Calif., and Comfort, based in Baltimore and elements of
the 24th Infantry Division (Mechanized) from Fort Stewart, Ga.
   Bush said economic sanctions were hurting Iraq but could ``be
tightened up even more.''
   Asked if Iraq appeared ready to invade Saudi Arabia, Bush said:
``There's no evidence right now that Saddam Hussein would be
foolish enough to cross that border.'' But he said Saddam was
anything but predictable. ``The troubling thing is we're up against
a man known for his brutality and irrationality,'' Bush said.
   The State Department said diplomatic posts around the world had
been urged to ``take appropriate security precautions'' out of
concern that the Mideast crisis might lead to terrorist acts
against Americans elsewhere.
   ``You could well see terrorist groups try to take advantage of
this,'' Bush said.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III carried an appeal from
Bush to the NATO allies, urging swift and strict enforcement of
international economic sanctions against Iraq. Baker said the
stakes in the standoff go far beyond the Persian Gulf and the oil
that powers the industrialized world, declaring that NATO faced the
first test of its clout in the post Cold War era.
   ``We all have an interest in thwarting Iraq's menacing and
unlimited ambitions,'' Baker said after a closed-door session of
NATO foreign ministers in Brussels. ``If might is to make right,
then the world will be plunged into a new dark age.''
   Bush headed to Maine to begin a summer vacation at his oceanside
home, but not before sending two letters to Congress detailing his
response to the Iraqi invasion, the greatest test of his
presidency. Bush also met with Defense Secretary Dick Cheney to
discuss the costs of the military mission, and the White House said
Iraq's aggression should bring a rethinking of calls for dramatic
defense cuts.
   Baker was to meet with Bush Saturday in Kennebunkport.
   Bush told Congress that U.S. troops would remain on Arab soil
``so long as their presence is required to contribute to the
security of the region.''
   Sounding a hopeful note, the president said: ``I do not believe
the involvement in hostilities is imminent; to the contrary, it is
my belief that this deployment will facilitate a peaceful
resolution to the crisis.''
   But Baker said there were signs that Iraq was moving troops near
its border with Turkey and also sending more forces into occupied
Kuwait. The U.S. deployments continued as well, with more air,
ground and sea power arriving for an effort Pentagon sources said
could ultimately include 250,000 ground troops if Iraq took aim at
the Saudi oil fields. Several U.S. commercial airlines said they
had been asked to help shuttle troops to the Middle East.
   In a fiery message broadcast on Iraqi television, a spokesman
for Saddam called on all Arabs to attack Western forces in the Gulf
and overthrow the Saudi monarchy.
   Not mentioned by the Iraqi statement were Americans who are not
being allowed to leave Iraq or Kuwait. The administration is loathe
to call them hostages, wary that doing so would complicate efforts
to win their freedom because any release would appear to be a
concession on Iraq's part.
   ``I'm not going to invite further harassment by elevating the
value of any citizens,'' Bush said.
   Britain, France and Australia already had promised to help the
United States mount a multinational defense of Saudi Arabia, the
world's biggest oil producer. Canada and West Germany pledged
Friday to join the effort and Baker said Belgium was poised to help
as well.
   The Saudi defense force is designed to deter further Iraqi
aggression, with hopes for an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait pinned
on a worldwide effort to suffocate Iraq's economy.
   Fitzwater said the sanctions appear to have all but shut down
Iraqi oil production. But U.S. officials were still talking about a
possible naval blockade in case Bush orders that all Iraqi commerce
be halted.
   The president's second letter to Congress explained the need for
the trade embargo against Iraq.
   ``The Iraqi government has tightened its unlawful grip over the
territory of Kuwait and has installed a puppet regime that in no
way represents the people or legitimate government of Kuwait,''
Bush said.
   While designed to cripple Iraq's already weak economy, the
sanctions were exacting a toll in the United States as well.
   Fare increases imposed by some commercial airlines because of
higher fuel costs kicked in Friday, with more price hikes scheduled
to take effect next week. And the Labor Department, in releasing
encouraging data on price inflation during June, said higher energy
costs _ particularly at the gas pumps _ likely would drive up
inflation in subsequent reports. With the economy virtually idle
now, many economists believe higher fuel prices will be enough to
trigger a recession.

   A federal judge ruled Friday that the U.S.
government illegally kidnapped a Mexican doctor for trial in the
slaying of an American drug agent, and ordered his return to Mexico.
   U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie said the abduction at
gunpoint of Dr. Humberto Alvarez Machain in the Enrique Camerena
murder case violated the government's extradition treaty with
Mexico.
   ``The defendant is ordered discharged and the government is
ordered to repatriate this defendant to Mexico forthwith,''
Rafeedie ruled.
   The judge also warned the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration
that such violations of another nation's sovereignty will not be
tolerated even if they are launched in the interest of stopping the
international drug trade.
   However, the judge stayed execution of his order for one week
after Assistant U.S. Attorney William Fahey asked for time to
consider an appeal in light of the ``significance'' of the ruling.
   The April 2 kidnapping of Alvarez at his office produced
diplomatic tensions between the two countries. Mexico accused the
United States of encroaching on its sovereignty and threatened to
cut off anti-drug cooperation.
   Justice Department officials had no immediate comment on the
ruling.
   Rafeedie stressed he was not dismissing the charge against
Alvarez but merely ruling that the case could not be tried in the
United States. He noted a long line of decisions upholding
abductions, but said those cases did not involve a formal
diplomatic protest, such as Mexico's over Alvarez.
   The judge also referred to other abductions in the Camarena
case. Juan Ramon Matta Ballesteros, a Honduran drug kingpin, was
taken by plane from Honduras. Rene Verdugo Urquidez was pushed
through a fence at the U.S.-Mexican border and grabbed by U.S.
agents.
   Matta's lawyer, Martin Stolar, has protested his abduction, but
said Honduras never formally protested the violation of its
extradition treaty. He said Rafeedie's ruling, if upheld, might
invalidate Matta's conviction last month. Verdugo was convicted in
a separate trial in 1988.
   In 1985, Camarena and his pilot, Alfredo Zavala Avelar, were
abducted, tortured and killed at a ranch outside Guadalajara.
   The doctor was spirited out of Mexico by DEA operatives to face
charges he administered drugs to revive Camarena for questioning
while he was being tortured.
   ``The DEA gave the go-ahead for the abduction,'' Rafeedie said
in a 39-page decision. ``This command was approved at the highest
levels of the DEA. The United States attorney general's office was
consulted.''
   Rafeedie said it was clear from the testimony of two DEA
operatives that the agency paid at least $20,000 in rewards for the
Alvarez abduction and continued to support the abductors and their
families to the tune of $6,000 a week in living expenses.
   He rejected a government contention that the DEA was not
responsible because its agents did not personally kidnap Alvarez.
   ``The United States is responsible for the actions of its paid
agents,'' the judge said.
   He noted that Mexico sent three diplomatic letters to the U.S.
government protesting Alvarez's kidnapping as a violation of its
sovereignty. When such a protest is made and a treaty is violated,
Rafeedie said, the defendant must be returned.
   Alvarez's lawyer, Robert Steinberg, said he felt the judge's
ruling was a warning to the DEA to stop kidnapping suspects from
Mexico. He said he believed the judge's ruling would be appealed
and might go as high as the U.S. Supreme Court.
   ``My fear is they're going to take these appeals for years while
he (Alvarez) rots in jail,'' he said.
   Although the government suggested a bail hearing for the doctor,
Steinberg said the defendant has no property to post as collateral
and probably would not win release because of fears that he would
flee to Mexico.
   Alvarez, who was wearing a blue jail jump suit, displayed no
emotion when he heard the ruling.
   Asked for his client's reaction, Steinberg said: ``He's numb.''
   The defense lawyer denied Alvarez had any involvement with the
drug trade in Mexico, although he acknowledged the defendant knew
drug traffickers and was the doctor for the family of drug kingpin
Rafael Caro Quintero.
   ``This man is incapable of a violent act,'' said Steinberg.
``He's a jolly buffoon who liked to hang around with the big guys.
It was an honor to be invited to Caro Quintero's rancho.''
   ``He enjoyed being important and being invited to the house, but
half the state did, including the governor of Jalisco,'' he said.
Jalisco is the Mexican state that includes the city of Guadalajara.
   He said Alvarez had been the personal physician to Caro's
grandfather and father.
   The U.S. Justice Department said earlier it was pressing its
investigation into the murders of Camarena and Avelar. Four men
were recently convicted in Los Angeles. Three others were convicted
in 1988 on charges of involvement in the murder. More than two
dozen people have been convicted in Mexico.

<DATELINE>LIMA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Looting broke out in dozens of poor
neighborhoods Friday in an angry reaction to President Alberto
Fujimori's harsh austerity program.
   In the Villa El Salvador shantytown, soldiers fired over the
heads of a stone-throwing mob of 2,000 that gathered in front of
the local market, demanding that it open.
   Police used tear gas and clubs to control about 3,000 Peruvians
in Lima's Ate-Vitarte section. The people had been waiting for up
to two days for subsidized sugar, but the supply ran out Friday.
   Looting began immediately after the government announced an
extreme economic austerity program Wednesday night. Gasoline prices
jumped from seven cents to more than $2. The cost of many basic
foods tripled or quadrupled.
   Telephone, water and electricity rates will rise, as will taxes
on the rich. Lower import duties and a free-floating dollar are in
store.
   The program aims to slash Peru's 3,000 percent annual inflation
rate by eliminating subsidies. The subsidies are largely
responsible for Peru's huge fiscal deficit, which in turn spurs the
government to print money to cover costs.
   Fujimori's plan also is intended to reactivate an economy in
which four of five people lack steady work.
   At first, the measures at first brought Lima to a near halt.
Most stores were closed Thursday and buses did not run.
   Life in downtown Lima and in the capital's wealthier
neighborhoods was largely back to normal Friday, with stores open
and some public transportation available. Restaurants were largely
empty.
   But the poor areas have been hard hit. Most people there buy
food day to day. Few had money enough to buy the basics Friday.
   Most markets were closed for fear of looting. Venders often
charged double the prices in supermarkets in wealthier
neighborhoods.
   People blamed the government.
   ``They're strangling us,'' Albina Urcaya said as she stood for
the third day in the sugar line in Ate-Vitarte. ``They pull us out
of one crisis just to throw us into a much deeper hole.''
   Julia Pomachagua stood nearby, caressing the head of her
5-year-old son. ``He hasn't eaten breakfast or lunch.''
   The government has said it will give out food directly to the
poor and subsidize their water and bus services.
   But few municipal offices in Lima had received any food by
Friday and most existing soup kitchens remained closed.
   At least part of the anger Friday turned against Fujimori.
   About a third of Peru's 22 million people live in deep poverty
and most of these voted for Fujimori, largely because of his
promise not to implement an austerity program.
   ``We are ignorant people, but when someone says he will help us
we believe him,'' said Deli Aguray, near Huaycan shantytown's
shuttered market. ``Fujimori tricked us into voting for him and now
he's abandoned us.''
   A man and a woman died Thursday outside Huaycan's market, shot
by the owner of a nearby grocery who fired on an enraged crowd.
   ``I don't know why he used his gun,'' Mrs. Aguray said Friday.
``We were just asking him to sell us what's in his store. We're
hungry and we have to get food somewhere, somehow.''

<TEXT>
   A rare tornado hit the New York borough of
Staten Island on Friday, uprooting trees and disrupting gas and
electrical service, authorities said.
   ``It's pretty scary. It's scary especially to look outside and
see everything like that,'' said Dawn Zimmer, 27.
   Her home was left standing, but its aluminum siding was slashed
and trees were uprooted. ``Everything's thrown all over,'' she said.
   Paul Egeler Sr. said he'd never seen anything like it in his 80
years on Staten Island, across New York Harbor from Manhattan and
Brooklyn. He said it lasted five to 10 minutes.
   It was the first tornado to hit any part of the city since Oct.
5, 1985, when a tornado hit the borough of Queens, causing
negligible damage, said Anthony Gigi of the National Weather
Service. No major tornadoes have struck New York this century.
   Police said it affected only a three- or four-block area.
   Two gas lines were pulled out when trees were uprooted, said Bob
Loftus, a spokesman for Brooklyn Union Gas. The utility shut down
service along one block to stop leaks, affecting about 50 homes.
   Consolidated Edison power lines also were knocked down, said
spokeswoman Bea Meltzer. No figures were immediately available
about outages.
   Fire Department Lt. Jim Powell said firefighters evacuated one
area until they could shut off fallen power lines and gas service.
   Gigi said the tornado started as a waterspout over Lower New
York Bay. He said tornadoes that begin as water spouts usually are
not as powerful as those that form over land.
   Debbie Casrovinci of Emergency Medical Services said two
injuries were reported.

<TEXT>
   A store employee tried to stop two
shoplifting suspects driving away from a supermarket, then tried to
leap over their car when it bore down on him.
   ``I lost an argument with a Pinto,'' said Duncan Walker,
assistant manager of a Winn-Dixie store.
   Actually, Walker put one foot through the windshield of a
Mercury Bobcat.
   Police Lt. Alvin Allcon said they do not encourage people to
follow Walker's example by pursuing perpetrators, although other
civilians wound up catching the two suspects.
   ``The history of that is we've just had too many folks that have
been severely injured,'' he said.
   Walker was taken to the Harris Methodist Fort Worth emergency
room Thursday night for treatment of gashes on his right leg.
   Walker, who has been working at the store for three weeks, had
hoped to stop the suspects' car by running in front of it.
   ``I thought he was going to run over me,'' Walker said. ``I had
a choice to either stand there and get run over, or jump right and
I'd probably get hit by traffic. Or jump over the car.
   ``I didn't get high enough to get over the windshield.''
   The suspects' car stopped after striking several vehicles.
   The two suspects fled on foot and were apprehended by
neighborhood residents carrying bats and at least one shotgun,
police said.
   Police found a supermarket basket loaded with cigarettes, key
chains, sweet rolls, toothpaste, socks and underwear.

<TEXT>
   Robert Campeau, the flamboyant Canadian retailer
whose empire foundered under the weight of debt, was ousted Friday
as chairman and chief executive of his own company.
   The Campeau Corp.'s board made the announcement in a terse
statement from its Toronto headquarters. Campeau remains a director
of the company but his future remains unclear.
   Campeau is an entrepreneur who went on a multibillion-dollar
spending spree for American department stores in the 1980s using
borrowed money, expanding his holdings to well-known names ranging
from Jordan Marsh to Bloomingdale's.
   But his U.S. retailing operations staggered under the weight of
this debt and sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection last January.
He has faced further pressure because of additional debts, which
include millions of dollars in personal loans, and the declining
value of the stock in his own company.
   Rumors had circulated recently that Campeau was in danger of
losing his position as chairman and was in fact under pressure to
resign.
   Campeau's board appointed James D. Raymond, a director of the
National Bank of Canada, and Gary M. Goodman, a top executive with
Olympia &amp; York Developments Ltd. of Toronto, to the office of chief
executive on an interim basis.
   The board also named Robert Despres, a Canadian investor who has
been on Campeau's board since 1975, as interim chairman of the
company.
   The company said in a statement from Toronto that it had begun a
search for a permanent chairman and chief executive.
   Campeau Corp. spokesman Richard W. Wertheim declined to comment
on what changes the board planned for the future of the company. He
said while Campeau would remain on the board, ``other roles he may
have in the future I can't say.''
   The changes are effective immediately, he said. The Campeau
board met in Toronto in a special session following its first
meeting July 30.
   Raymond, 65, was appointed to Campeau's board Aug. 1. He is a
former president of Claridge Inc., an investment firm connected
with the powerful Bronfman business family in Canada.
   Goodman was elected to the board on July 30. He is a senior vice
president of corporate development of Olympia &amp; York in Toronto.
   Despres has been on Campeau's board since November 1975. He is
president of DRM Holdings Inc., a Canadian investment firm.
   Campeau's department store divisions, Federated Department
Stores Inc. and Allied Stores Corp., had a combined debt of $7.7
billion when they sought protection from creditors six months ago.
   Much of the debt was in high-interest junk bonds to finance the
purchases by Robert Campeau, who bought Allied in 1986 and
Federated in 1988.
   He lost control of the retailing operations shortly after they
filed for bankruptcy. They are now run as a separate operation
headquartered in Cincinnati.
   Campeau Corp. lost $80 million in the first quarter of 1990, on
top of $1.7 billion in losses in 1989.
   The National Bank of Canada in January seized about 80 million
Canadian dollars in Campeau Corp. stock owned by Robert Campeau,
after he missed payments on loans.
   He had lost much of his personal fortune in a plunge in the
company's stock. But he failed to meet payments that would have
allowed him to repurchase the shares and regain control of the
company earlier this year.
   Before the bank seized his stock, Campeau and his family held
53.9 percent. Olympia &amp; York, a property development company, still
holds 11.8 percent and the remainder is publicly held.

   Two members of the rock group Red Hot
Chili Peppers were ordered to pay $5,000 each to a rape crisis
center and apologize to a young woman they sexually harassed during
a Spring Break beach concert.
   Michael ``Flea'' Balzary, 26, and Chad Smith, 28, each pleaded
guilty to battery. Balzary, 26, also pleaded guilty to disorderly
conduct and solicitation to commit an unnatural and lascivious act.
   County Judge Freddie Worthen on Thursday sentenced Balzary and
Smith each to pay a $1,000 fine, pay $300 to the State Attorney's
Office for prosecution costs and donate $5,000 to the Volusia
County Rape Crisis Center.
   Both also had to apologize in writing to the 20-year-old college
student from Virginia who was attacked on the sand last March 14
during the taping of an MTV Spring Break broadcast.
   Both musicians were hustled by their lawyers from the courtroom
and would not comment. They both have sent letters of apology.
   According to beach rangers, the woman was dancing on the sand
when Balzary picked her up and swung her around on his shoulder.
Despite her repeated protests and attempts to free herself, she was
thrown onto the sand.
   Balzary and Smith spanked her and tried to peel off her swimsuit
bottom. The woman fell to the sand and Balzary knelt on her legs,
yelling at her to perform a sex act, authorities said.
   Prosecutors said the woman approved of the sentence, which
included the maximum sentence for the first-degree misdemeanor.
   In his apology, Smith wrote: ``I clearly got carried away in the
theatrics of the moment and I now realize how inappropriate and
wrong my actions were.''
   Kathy Wilkes, executive director of the Rape Crisis Center, said
the $10,000 in donations would be a boon for the agency, which is
operating on a $90,000 budget this year.
   Albums by the Red Hot Chili Peppers include the 1989 record
``Mother's Milk'' and the 1985 ablum, ``Red Hot Chili Peppers.''

<HEAD>ANC Chief Says Violence To Stop, Despite What Winnie Mandela Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURINDA KEYS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An African National Congress
leader went on state-run TV Friday to contest Winnie Mandela's
assertion that suspending guerrilla actions was merely a
``strategy'' and violence would continue.
   Walter Sisulu said the ANC's National Executive Committee
``decided that, as from now, the armed struggle, meaning the
shooting, actually will stop. It was decided as a well-considered
decision, not a mere strategy.''
   Sisulu is a founder of the ANC's military wing.
   Later, however, the ANC issued a strong statement demanding that
the government ``suspend'' the Internal Security Act, which allows
suspects to be detained indefinitely in solitary confinement. The
ANC said 151 of its members have been arrested recently under the
law.
   The organization said the arrests run counter to an agreement
reached with the government Tuesday, when the ANC suspended its
armed struggle to make way for negotiations on the end of
apartheid. The government said it would review the Internal
Security Act and consider repealing some sections.
   The ANC asked that the law be suspended until Parliament can
repeal it.
   In reply to a question from a TV reporter, Sisulu said no action
would be taken against Mrs. Mandela, wife of ANC Deputy President
Nelson Mandela, for her comments on the suspension of guerrilla
actions.
   ``Many people make mistakes and ... we would take no further
step about the matter,'' he said.
   The South African Broadcasting Corp. showed film of a speech
Mrs. Mandela made Thursday night in Durban at the relaunch of the
ANC Women's League. She said,
   ``To suspend military action on the part of the ANC is a
strategy. It does not mean the cessation of violence.''
   After the broadcast, the ANC issued a news release repeating
Sisulu's comment.
   ANC leaders have previously disagreed with Mrs. Mandela, in
particular when she gave support in a 1986 speech to use of the
``necklace'' method of killing blacks in the townships. It involves
placing a gasoline-soaked tire around the victim's neck and
igniting it.
   The ANC has called for a stop to ``necklacings,'' usually
administered in the past to blacks accused of collaborating with
the white-led government and which police say have caused about 400
deaths since 1984.
   The ANC said then that Mrs. Mandela held no position in the
organization, though she has claimed to have been an ANC
``soldier.''
   In February 1989, major anti-apartheid leaders in South Africa
denounced Mrs. Mandela, urged the black community to shun her and
accused her bodyguards of waging a ``reign of terror'' in Soweto, a
black township outside Johannesburg.
   One bodyguard, Jerry Richardson, was sentenced to death
Wednesday for murdering a 14-year-old black youth leader, who was
held captive and beatn in Mrs. Mandela's home, according to court
testimony.
   Mandela, Sisulu and other ANC leaders were sentenced in 1964 to
life in prison for sabotage and plotting the overthrow of the
government. Sisulu was freed last October and Mandela last February.

<HEAD>Chemical Protection Gear Will Do Job, Air Force Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Air Force's anti-chemical attack suits
and gas masks are bulky and heavy and the Saudi Arabian heat could
make them more uncomfortable, two men who helped design the gear
said Friday.
   But they said the equipment is the finest in the world and will
provide ample protection from chemical weapons.
   Robert May, director of the Human Protection Systems Division at
Wright-Patterson Air Force Base outside of Dayton that helped
design the gear, said it had been used in the field with simulated
environments, including hot climates in the United States.
   ``It's very good,'' he said. ``We believe it's the best in the
world.''
   ``It's good protection,'' said Burnham Foley, deputy chief of
the division's chemical warfare defense branch. ``But you've got to
train harder to work in it.''
   A growing U.S. military force is taking up defensive positions
in Saudi Arabia to protect the oil-rich kingdom from possible
attack from Iraqi troops that overran Kuwait last week.
   Iraq's Saddam Hussein has an unknown quantity of deadly chemical
weapons. Saddam used chemical weapons against Iran during the
countries' eight-year war and against Iraq's rebellious Kurdish
minority.
   Saddam also threatened in April to attack Israel with chemical
weapons in the event of an Israeli attack.
   May said the heat of Saudi Arabia, where temperatures can soar
to 120 degrees, could make wearing the suits, which he described as
heavy and bulky, more stifling.
   ``There's no doubt that it's not comfortable stuff to work in,''
May said. ``You're not going to be comfortable, and it's not going
to be fun.''
   The equipment, one for air crews and another for ground crews,
includes overgarments, masks, boots, gloves, decontamination
devices, chemical detectors and medical supplies. The Army's gear
is different.
   Crews can temporarily remove parts of the gear, then quickly put
them back on again if an attack appears imminent, Foley said.
   ``If someone is surprised and they don't have their equipment
on, ... it would be a problem,'' Foley said. ``(But) our troops
train in it, and they typically have part of it on if there's any
kind of alert status at all.''
   May said that the gear provides head-to-toe protection and that
the masks include vapor traps and charcoal filters and allow for
insertion of drinking tubes. He declined to say what specific
chemical agents the suits will repel.
   ``It's designed to protect against the ones we believe to be a
threat,'' May said.
   The 1925 Geneva Protocol forbade use of chemical weapons in
battle. More than 100 nations had signed the protocol by 1986, but
production of chemical weapons never completely stopped.

<HEAD>Wisconsin Congressman Suggests Bush Speech to Arabs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush needs to address the Arab world
to counter the ``demonizing'' statements of Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein, an influential member of Congress proposed Friday.
   ``Right now we are abdicating the political rostrum in the Arab
world to Saddam,'' said Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the
House Armed Services Committee, in a statement. ``He is demonizing
us and we are not responding.''
   Aspin said the president needs to make a televised address to
the Arab world explaining U.S. aims in sending troops to Saudi
Arabia, and that Saddam Hussein is the enemy of the United States,
not the Iraqi people.
   ``First, the Arab world, and especially the Iraqi people and
military, need to be told that we will withdraw out troops if
Saddam is driven from power. ... Bluntly put, we want to encourage
a coup or an uprising,'' Aspin said.
   ``Second, we need a way to offer a hand of friendship to the
Arab world in a concrete manner,'' to counter what Aspin called the
``disgusting lie'' that western countries stopped shipments of
sensitive military technology to Baghdad because it wants to deny
Arabs the fruits of science and technology.
   ``We should consider spiking that lie by offering a generous
program of scholarships for young Arabs with scientific and
technical skills.''
   The president spoke to the American people by television on
Wednesday an address that Aspin found inadequate.
   ``He never once mentioned that Saddam Hussein threatens our
national security directly _ and that this is the reason we are
deploying troops in Saudi Arabia.''
   Instead, Aspin complained, Bush made the deployment ``sound like
a good-government exercise.''
   ``We aren't sending an army halfway around the world to help
some rich oil sheikh get back his throne,'' Aspin said.
   Aspin said he had written Bush with his ideas, but he did not
release the letter.

   Australia, Canada and West Germany on Friday
committed ships to an international effort to isolate Iraq, and
Secretary of State James A. Baker III pressed the NATO allies to do
more.
   In Cairo, 12 Arab states voted Friday night to send troops to
protect Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf states. Details of the
joint Arab force and its relations, if any, with the U.S.-led
multinational air, land and sea force will be worked out later.
   The United States and Britain also were sending ships to enforce
a U.N. economic embargo intended to force Iraq to withdraw from
Kuwait. France and the Soviet Union sent ships to the region,
independent of the multinational force.
   At a NATO meeting in Brussels, Baker appealed to the alliance
for support. ``We should show that we will do whatever must be done
in order to enforce the will of the United Nations,'' Baker said.
   Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney announced late Friday his
country will contribute two destroyers and a supply ship to the
multinational force.
   Representatives from Italy and Belgium indicated at the NATO
foreign ministers' meeting that they would announce their decisions
on supporting military moves in the next few days.
   Denmark said it would make ships available to take up gaps in
the alliance as U.S. and other ships move into the Gulf.
   Hans Klein, chief spokesman for the West German government, said
his country was sending four or five minesweepers to the
Mediterranean in case Iraq tried to mine shipping lanes there. He
said the ships might be available for duty in the gulf.
   Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke announced that two frigates
and a supply ship would leave within five days and would be on
station in the Persian Gulf in about three weeks.
   Hawke, who said he was responding to an appeal from President
Bush, said the vessels would be ``Australia's contribution to the
multinational task force in the Middle East'' and will be used ``to
enforce the blockade on Iraq and Kuwait and protect the exports
from other oil-producing countries.''
   Britain announced Thursday that it was sending two fighter
aircraft squadrons, anti-aircraft missiles and other air and sea
forces totaling more than 1,000 men to the gulf area as quickly as
possible.
   French President Francois Mitterrand announced Thursday that his
nation was increasing its naval and air forces in the gulf but
would operate independently of the U.S. force.

   Mayor Marion Barry was convicted Friday on a
single drug charge and acquitted on another. The judge declared a
mistrial on 12 counts, including more serious perjury charges,
after jurors reported they were deadlocked.
   An elated Barry took what amounted to a victory lap around the
courthouse grounds, surrounded by supporters chanting ``four more
years.''
   It was a stunning end to a six-week trial that featured an FBI
videotape of the mayor smoking crack cocaine in a sting operation.
   Asked why the jury deadlocked, foreman Edward P. Eagles said,
``Never forget that famous phrase in law, beyond a reasonable
doubt. That's a very, very tough standard to meet.''
   Barry insisted all along that he had been singled out by
vindictive federal prosecutors. He and others argued that the
government spent millions singling him out _ in part because he is
black _ and the case exposed deep racial divisions in the nation's
capital.
   The jury found Barry guilty of charges that he possessed cocaine
in November 1989 with long-time associate Doris Crenshaw. Crenshaw
testified that she snorted cocaine with the mayor in her hotel room.
   Barry was found innocent of charges that he possessed cocaine on
Sept. 7, 1988.
   The jury was hung on the three most serious counts, felony
charges that Barry lied to a federal grand jury about his dealings
with Charles Lewis, a convicted cocaine dealer who was one of the
government's chief witnesses.
   It also couldn't agree on a verdict on the cocaine possession
charge stemming from the FBI sting operation. In the FBI videotape,
Barry was seen smoking crack cocaine with former girlfriend
Rasheeda Moore at the Vista Hotel on Jan. 18. Juror Johnnie Mae
Hardeman said the panel deadlocked 6-6 on the charge arising from
that night.
   The single cocaine possession conviction carries a maximum
penalty of one year in jail and a $100,000 fine.
   U.S. Attorney Jay Stephens said he would review the case before
deciding whether to seek a new trial. U.S. District Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson scheduled a hearing Sept. 17.
   In a statement that reflected the racial concerns raised by the
trial, Benjamin Hooks, executive director of the NAACP, urged the
government not to try Barry again. ``We hope that this brings this
sad, sad saga to an close,'' he said.
   A few hours after the verdict was rendered, impromptu
celebrations broke out in predominantly black areas of the nation's
capital. A short distance from the mayor's house, motorists were
honking their horns and shouting ``Barry, Barry,'' and ``Four more
years.'
   Several churches opened for unscheduled services as word spread
of the outcome of the trial.
   All told, Barry was charged with 10 counts of cocaine
possession, three counts of perjury and one count of conspiracy to
possess cocaine and conceal its use.
   The mayor said repeatedly that he never used cocaine except for
the night of the FBI sting last Jan. 18. It wasn't until closing
arguments that Barry's lawyer, R. Kenneth Mundy, acknowledged that
Barry had used the drug. Even so, Mundy said the government had
failed to prove the specifics of its case.
   Barry, who sat stonefaced when the single guilty verdict was
announced, smiled broadly as Jackson declared the mistrial. He
threw his arm around Mundy in celebration.
   As he left the courthouse, Barry was mobbed by supporters urging
him to seek re-election. Barry had said that he would not run for a
fourth term, but there has been speculation in recent days that he
would change his mind and run as an independent.
   ``He is relieved, obviously, and this is his 202nd day chemical
free,'' his press secretary Lurma Rackley said. Barry, who sought
treatment earlier this year for what he said was addiction to
alcohol and prescription drugs, planned to make a statement
Saturday.
   Stephens was heckled as he defended the prosecution of the mayor.
   He said that on the single conviction, the jury had held ``Mr.
Barry accountable for his criminal conduct and he must now accept
responsibility for that conduct.''
   The end to the trial came simply, as the judge asked the jury
whether it wanted to resume deliberations on the remaining 12
counts. After conferring in the jury room, the panel said it was
deadlocked.
   ``I am prepared to declare a mistrial on the remaining 12
charges,'' Jackson said.
   Mundy responded, ``I move ...'' and Jackson nodded in assent.
   Thirteen witnesses testified during the trial that they had seen
the mayor use drugs cocaine, marijuana and opium some 200 times.
Mundy conceded the mayor was an occasional cocaine user, but said
the prosecution had relied on liars _ ``little Lucifers'' _ to make
its case and had failed to prove the charges.
   Several black leaders suggested that Barry was prosecuted simply
because he is a high-profile black politician. Among them was
Nation of Islam Minister Louis Farrakhan, who at first was barred
from attending the trial.
   Two whites sat on the 12-member jury. The jury foreman was a
white man.
   Barry came to the city in 1965, a civil rights worker. Three
years later, after the assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King
Jr., the city erupted in its worst racial violence. Barry was often
credited with cooling tempers in the aftermath.
   Many in the black community said they felt betrayed by the
mayor, who had made appearance after appearance preaching the evils
of drugs to the city's youth.
   The verdict is the culmination of a criminal investigation that
began in December 1988 after the mayor's visits to Lewis' hotel
room in Washington, D.C.
   Lewis testified that Barry used cocaine and crack repeatedly on
two trips to the Virgin Islands. He said they also smoked crack in
a Washington, D.C., hotel room, and that they conspired to cover up
their drug use when police began investigating a complaint that
Lewis had offered crack to a hotel maid.
   Lewis began cooperating with the government a year ago, after he
was convicted of drug charges in the Virgin Islands.
   Barry's lawyers depicted Lewis as a liar who fabricated
allegations of drug use to shorten his time in prison.
   Moore, the government's star witness, testified that she and
Barry used drugs together ``at least 100 times'' in hotels, boats
and homes around the city from 1986 to 1989. They were lovers for
two years, then simply partners in drug use, she said.
   The defense attacked Moore's credibility and motives. She
admitted that she was nearly broke and in trouble with the police
when the FBI asked her to cooperate in the sting operation.

   General Motors Corp. said a strike by parts plant
workers angry at use of outside parts sources would halt several
assembly lines from Michigan to Louisiana, and by Friday it had
idled more than 10,000 workers.
   United Auto Workers officials said the strike by 2,700 employees
in Flint proves the union is serious in its opposition to so-called
``outsourcing'' of parts and in its demand for job security in its
national contract talks with the Big Three automakers.
   Negotiations on contracts to replace those that expire Sept. 14
began last month.
   Workers at the AC Rochester Flint West plant walked out
Wednesday over complaints about being assigned more work in the
same hours, health and safety grievances and plans to transfer as
many as 900 jobs to independent shops and other GM plants.
   The plant makes about 65 percent of the fuel tanks for GM cars
and trucks, along with other parts such as doors for vans and
grilles for vans and pickups.
   To avoid storing large stocks of expensive parts, GM plants rely
on just-in-time delivery from parts plants like Flint West, so the
effect of a strike spreads quickly.
   GM's pickup truck and sport utility vehicle assembly plant in
Moraine, Ohio, ran out of fuel tanks and closed Thursday, idling
about 3,000 workers.
   GM's Buick-Oldsmobile-Cadillac Division said statements that its
Buick City plant in Flint and its Orion Township plant in Oakland
County would close at midnight Friday were premature.
   ``Today we realized we have enough material to operate on
Monday,'' spokeswoman Marsha McGee said.
   A first shift would run Monday at both the 3,000-worker Orion
plant and the 2,500-worker Buick City plant, McGee said. The
company will decide on further shifts then, she said.
   Dave Michels, general manager of the GM Truck &amp; Bus Group plant
that assembles pickup trucks and sport-utility vehicles in
Shreveport, La., said that plant worked only a few hours Friday
before running out of fuel tanks and sending its 2,400 employees
home.
   The Truck and Bus Group's Pontiac West plant sent 2,000 workers
home Friday afternoon when it ran out of tanks for the light-duty
trucks assembled there, GM spokesman John Maciarz said.
   GM President Lloyd Reuss said Thursday the AC Rochester Flint
West strike could affect six to eight assembly plants by Monday.
   Negotations were under way.
   ``We've been exchanging paperwork and talking,'' said Mike
Grimes, UAW Local 659 shop chairman. ``We don't want any more
people to suffer than have to. We want our people back to work.''
   GM wouldn't comment on the implications of the strike on
national contract talks. Job security is a major issue as the
automakers seek to trim employment levels to cut their costs.
   ``All I know is we have one local on strike and we have GM
plants being affected,'' GM spokesman John Maciarz said.
   ``Outsourcing is a very serious national concern ... that has
strong emotional appeal to GM workers,'' said Harley Shaiken, labor
specialist at the University of California at San Diego.
   During past national negotiations, union leaders have delayed
strikes over local issues. The strike at a key plant a month before
the contract expires points out the mood of the workers, Shaiken
said.
   ``I think it sends a signal of the discontent of people being
told that if you change, and put out your quality, and up your
productivity, we'll take care of you _ and then they turn around
and keep shipping their work out,'' said Stan Marshall, UAW vice
president and director of the union's Chrysler Department.

   About 100 pro-choice abortion
demonstrators carried signs, chanted slogans and staged a
``die-in'' to protest a visit Friday night by Supreme Court Justice
Sandra Day O'Connor.
   O'Connor addressed about 500 people at the annual banquet of the
Herbert Hoover Library Association. But in her 39-minute speech,
O'Connor did not touch upon the abortion issue.
   Instead, she gave a long history of President Hoover's three
appointments _ Charles Evans Hughes, Owen J. Roberts and Benjamin
Cardozo _ during his term.
   Hoover's appointees were picked for their qualifications as
jurists instead of their political ideology, she said. Hoover
believed firmly in the independence of the high court from
governmental interference, O'Connor said.
   ``The court underwent the most fundamental shift in
constitutional jurisprudence in the court's history,'' she said.
   Although O'Connor wasn't in town to speak about abortion,
activists from both sides of the issue held demonstrations before
the speech.
   Members of the Reproductive Rights Coalition of Iowa City and
New Wave, a student group at the University of Iowa, heavily
outnumbered those from the Johnson County Right to Life group, who
showed up in support of O'Connor.
   The two groups yelled at each other and shoved signs in each
other's faces but no disturbances broke out.
   O'Connor, who has said she finds abortion personally abhorrent,
has been considered a key vote on abortion. In a 1989 ruling, she
joined a 5-4 majority giving states new power to limit abortions.
But she stopped short of providing a fifth vote to overturn the
basic abortion rights ruling.
   Carrying a sign splattered with red paint that read, ``Sandra
Day Go Away,'' Gregory Eiselein said he blamed O'Connor for
``moving the Supreme Court more and more to the right.''
   ``It seems to me that Sandra Day O'Connor has made her impact on
the Supreme Court,'' Eiselein said. ``She's leading the overturning
of Roe vs. Wade,'' the landmark Supreme Court decision that
legalized abortion.
   Members of the Johnson County Right to Life countered by yelling
``baby killers'' and carried signs just outside the Hoover
association's banquet room at the Holiday Inn.
   ``I think we need to stand up for what's right,'' said Kevin
Rocca of Iowa City. ``You can't just sit around and let a bunch of
confused people who have their own ideas make policy for the rest
of us.''
   During the ``die-in,'' about 20 men and women lay on the red
bricks of the pedestrian mall outside the hotel. A member of the
New Wave group, parodied Supreme Court Chief Justice William
Renquist by dressing in a white wig and black robe, stood over them
and outlined their bodies with yellow chalk.
   O'Connor's speech would focus on Hoover's presidency from 1929
to 1933 and his effect on the Supreme Court, said Tom Walsh,
executive director of the library association.
   The Herbert Hoover Library is located in nearby West Branch,
birthplace of the nation's 31st president.

   An error of about one millimeter _ called
``astonishing'' by one expert for its large size _ has been found
in a measuring device used to guide the manufacture of a flawed
mirror on the Hubble Space Telescope.
   A NASA committee investigating the defect that has crippled the
$1.5 billion telescope announced Thursday that the millimeter
mistake was found while testing the measuring device, called a null
corrector.
   The space telescope, touted as an orbiting observatory that
would be able to see objects up to 14 billion light years away, was
launched in April.
   Engineers discovered two months later that a mirror in the
device had been manufactured wrong. As a result, the telescope's
views of stars are blurred and of severely reduced value to
astronomers.

   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner is
calling in airline executives to discuss the impact of sharp rises
in jet fuel prices that led nearly every major carrier to announce
fare increases.
   Some increases went into effect today, but passengers on most
airlines have until next Wednesday to book flights in advance at
current fares.
   Skinner wrote several airline presidents on Thursday, asking
them to make appointments with him next Wednesday, Thursday or
Friday to discuss how higher jet fuel prices following the Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait are affecting airline finances and the public.
   Delta, United and USAir all announced 5.3 percent fare increases
Thursday that are to take effect in five days. Several other
airlines announced increases earlier.

   Bankrupt savings and loans under government
management effectively added $1.35 billion to the cost of the
thrift bailout in the first three months of the year.
   Operating losses at the 350 failed, but still open, institutions
rose 35 percent from the $1 billion in operating red ink a year
earlier, when the S&amp;Ls were still managed privately, the Resolution
Trust Corp. said Thursday.
   However, the operating losses were down 16 percent from $1.61
billion in the last three months of 1989, the bailout agency said.
   Analysts said the operating loss increase from the first quarter
of 1989 does not necessarily mean the insolvent thrifts are being
managed poorly by the government.

   The Justice Department's challenge to
Georgia's majority vote election runoff system ultimately could aid
Republican candidates in the South and Southwest _ not blacks, a
political observer says.
   The department sued Thursday, contending that Georgia's election
runoff system has had ``a chilling effect on black political
participation.''
   Ten states in the South and Southwest have laws requiring a
runoff election if no candidate receives a majority of the votes in
a general election.
   ``The Republican Party can be made overnight in the South if
that runoff law is eliminated,'' said Claiborne Darden, an
Atlanta-based pollster. ``That would do more for the Republican
Party than Republicans could do for themselves in 125 years.''
   Without runoff elections, Darden said, blacks would win more
Democratic primaries. But they would lose general elections to GOP
candidates backed by white voters who previously supported white
Democratic candidates, he said.

   Army soldiers, National Guardsmen
and federal agents claimed to have destroyed more than 1,400
marijuana plants in a 12-day sweep that drew protests and a lawsuit
from residents and civil libertarians.
   The operation, which ended Thursday, was the first time that
active-duty soldiers have been used to fight marijuana growing in
the United States.
   About 50 agents from the Bureau of Land Management and the Drug
Enforcement Agency and an estimated 150 Guardsmen and soldiers from
Fort Ord took part in Operation Green Sweep, a raid on pot fields
in the King Range National Conservation Area. There were no arrests.
   The rugged, 60,000-acre area and its environs along California's
northwestern coast was settled in the early 1970s by hundreds of
hippies and homesteaders. Marijuana was widely planted on both
public and private land.

<HEAD>Socialist Sanders Running Hard For Vermont's Lone Seat In House</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSAN ALLEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The hopes of maverick congressional
candidate Bernard Sanders are rising right along with voters' anger
at the Washington insiders who brought them, among other things,
the savings and loan scandal.
   Sanders, a socialist trying to win Vermont's only House seat,
says he wants to shake things up on Capitol Hill. He's counting on
public discontent with politics-as-usual to help him get there.
   ``The American people are totally disgusted with the performance
of the U.S. Congress,'' said Sanders.
   Sanders is not the only challenger running against the
establishment in an era of skyrocketing federal deficits, ethical
violations by politicians and public outrage over the S&amp;L mess.
   But he's been using the outsider theme longer and more
successfully than most. Polls show him within striking distance of
Rep. Peter Smith, R-Vt., who narrowly defeated Sanders two years
ago in a three-way race.
   Sanders portrays Smith as a slave to big money, noting that
about half his campaign contributions this year have come from
political action committees.
   Smith, on the other hand, portrays Sanders as someone who is
unable to work within the system and therefore would be
ineffective. ``It sure isn't anger and cynicism that will solve the
problems in Congress,'' he said.
   That debate over style has dominated the race.
   Although Smith has received a 100 percent rating from the League
of Conservation Voters, for example, Vermont environmental activist
Cort Richardson endorsed Sanders. He said Smith is not ``a man who
is really taking the initiative proposed and working for it ... you
don't see the commitment there.''
   Sanders' anti-establishment message has not changed over many
years and races, from a marginal 1972 Senate bid on the third-party
Liberty Union ticket through eight years as mayor of Burlington
after a 1981 upset.
   What has changed is the popularity of that message. At least two
independent polls taken in the state this summer indicate that
Sanders and Smith are running a tight race for the House, with
Democrat Dolores Sandoval lagging behind with between 1 percent and
10 percent of the vote.
   Smith admitted he's battling the negatives that accompany
incumbency this year.
   ``I don't think there's any doubt that nationally there is
concern about the incumbency, and to an extent in Vermont that is
there. People on the street say we wish we felt better about
Congress,'' Smith said. ``But you can't separate yourself (from
Congress). I have to say, here's what I have done since I have gone
down there.''
   During his first term, Smith has demonstrated some spunk _
voting against the Bush administration 51 percent of the time,
leading the call for an independent prosecutor to investigate the
S&amp;L debacle, and promoting a crackdown on the sale of semiautomatic
weapons.
   But Sanders is calling for more dramatic moves by Vermont's lone
representative.
   Among his priorities: slashing defense spending by $40 billion
annually; nationalizing the health care system; increasing taxes on
the wealthy and corporations to pay for expanded human service,
education and environmental programs; guaranteeing free public
transportation; and mandating trash recycling.
   Although Smith began the campaign with a $130,000 war chest
carried over from the 1988 race, the two matched fund raising
during the most recent financial reporting period that ended June
30. Each raised almost $100,000.
   Sanders recently became embroiled in a controversy when
Republicans noted that he had listed all campaign workers as
consultants _ and therefore paid no taxes on those staffers.
Certain taxes, including Social Security, were paid by the workers;
others, including workers compensation and unemployment, were not
paid at all.
   The GOP charges hit close to the bone for Sanders, who has spent
much of his political career championing workers' causes and
blasting those who fail to pay their fair share of taxes. He is
meeting with state and federal tax officials to determine if his
bookkeeping methods are legal.

   It's two hours before show time and
guitarist Lonnie Mack is sitting at a table in his tour bus in the
parking lot of a roadhouse.
   He's smoking roll-your-own cigarettes, talking about 30-plus
years on the road and thinking ahead _ way ahead if the music world
is lucky.
   ``Till I die,'' he says responding to a question about how long
he will keep touring and playing his old-time rock 'n' roll.
   ``Just keep on. It's my life. I don't know that I'll be out here
running in a bus when I'm 80 years old or something. But right now,
I'm thinking more of getting into a quieter situation and to think
on writing some more.
   ``I've been sort of letting that go downhill, because we have
been running the highways pretty good.''
   Mack, 49, was at Fitzgerald's, playing to celebrate the release
of his new, live album on Alligator Records, ``Live! Attack of the
Killer V.'' It was recorded at the suburban Chicago roadhouse in
December.
   It was the second night of a month-long domestic tour that
followed a stint in Europe and would end with a short break before
a trip to Australia in August. In the calm before another
lay-it-down, sweat-it-out jam, it remains unclear just when Mack
will find time for quiet.
   It doesn't seem to bother him, however. Little does, although
the man whose music celebrates simplicity in theme and style has a
world of opinions he's willing to share this rainy night.
   _ The government: ``I'm not really happy about where the
government's at at this point.''
   _ The nation's education system: ``And in education, you know,
I'm not a big believer in the educational system in this country
right now, or any country.''
   _ Modern music, particularly rap and heavy metal: ``You know, to
me it's a joke. It's a joke and it's a bad joke. It's so obvious, I
mean the guys are making money at it and that's what they're doing
and they're in it for the money and that's strictly what it's
about. They ain't in it to send anybody any good vibes.''
   What's remarkable here is Mack's frame of reference. Simplicity
is the thread that stitches it together.
   Witness the new record, which captures Mack in the setting most
familiar to him these past three decades: on a roadhouse stage
backed by bass, drums and keyboard. The result is a rollicking
blend of rhythm and blues, gospel and rockabilly that adds up to
stripped-bare rock 'n' roll.
   ``I like simplicity,'' he said. ``I think it's the very thing
that made rock 'n' roll become what it was in the first place. ...
I mean, you know, `be bop a lula you're my baby' ain't something
you got to think a whole lot about.''
   A native of Harrison, Ind., Mack has been in the music limelight
on and off since his recording of Chuck Berry's ``Memphis'' was
released in 1963. He has moved from the stage to the corporate
suite, joining Elektra Records as an A&amp;R man for a time, and back
to the stage and studio.
   Mack's latest resurgence began in 1983 when he was persuaded by
guitarist Stevie Ray Vaughn to move to Austin, Texas. The two began
jamming around town and across the country.
   Mack's first Alligator record, ``Strike Like Lightning,'' in
1985, was a critical success and helped him attract all-star guests
such as Keith Richards, Ron Wood, Ry Cooder and Vaughn on his tour.
Since then, Mack's career has been steady and busy.
   ``But I want to try to get involved in something again that
means something,'' he said. ``I mean music is about giving. You're
out trying to give people a good time. You want them to enjoy
themselves, you know. I mean if you're not, you feel like a
failure.''
   Mack delivers his aphorisms in a southern Indiana drawl that
gives them more impact. The underlying conviction comes partly from
realizing that he needs to please himself first.
   ``In the old days it used to be I was very concerned with going
out and really pleasing the audience, trying to figure out the
audience, do exactly what they wanted me to do, do all their
requests,'' he said.
   ``You do this, you do everything, but most generally you find in
a large group that there's no way you can do that, so the first
thing you've got to do is please yourself. And if you make yourself
happy and you look happy and you're having a good time, it'll show
usually.''
   Commercial success is another question. But once again, Mack is
at ease.
   ``A little more wouldn't hurt,'' he said with a pause. ``A
little less, I could still live with.''

<HEAD>Shanna Reed of `Major Dad' Toughs It Out</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>

<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shanna Reed spent a summer week roughing it
in the backwoods of Maine _ a tough-it-out struggle which might
serve her well in her new job with the Marines in CBS' ``Major
Dad.''
   In the coming fall season, Maj. J.D. ``Mac'' McGillis (played by
Gerald McRaney) is transferred to a small Marine base in Virginia.
Reed plays his wife Polly, who braves the hazards of a job on the
post newspaper.
   The show began last year with Major McGillis as a gung-ho
Marine, a bachelor in his early 40s, who has a whirlwind courtship
with a widow with three daughters and suddenly finds himself in a
house full of females.
   In the break between seasons of ``Major Dad,'' Reed went on a
strenuous canoeing trip on the Androscoggin River and Umbagog Lake
in Maine.
   The canoe trip had some aspects of a military adventure.
   ``There were 12 of us, including two guides, in six canoes,''
she said. ``Every day we had different duties, like navigator one
day, cook the next. The guides didn't interfere. We took a wrong
turn one day and had to paddle back. ``We forgot our tents, so we
roughed it. I covered myself head to foot and wrapped myself in
mosquito netting and still got bit. The thing I got the most out of
was the teamwork. Everyone needed someone else.''
   In the second season of ``Major Dad,'' the show moves to
Virginia and enlists three new characters. The camp is on the
bubble _ military cutbacks threaten it with closing.
   A lot of the comic conflict, however, will come from Polly's new
job as a reporter on the camp newspaper.
   ``Mac's in charge of the newspaper, so her articles will be
edited by Mac and the general,'' she said. ``She'll have to do some
rewriting. I'll be the editor of the feature section, called `At
Ease.' We'll live on base, so the kids will also be involved in the
military system.''
   ``Major Dad'' is the fourth series for Reed. She was in ``For
Love and Honor'' (another military series), ``I Had Three Wives''
and ``The Colbys.'' She was also a semi-regular on ``HeartBeat''
and starred in the soap opera ``Texas.''
   ``Polly's feisty, and I know that's an overused description, and
intelligent and independent,'' Reed said. ``She'll jump in over her
head and find herself overwhelmed. I want to see more of that,
where you have someone who's not completely comfortable in her
environment. She has a lot of good qualities. I don't have kids,
but I hope to be the kind of parent she is. She values
communication and honesty with her kids.
   ``She's a romantic at heart. An overboard romantic, which I'd
like to see more of. We have to keep romance a prominent part of
the show. I think Mac and I have good chemistry. You have to get to
the husband and wife and get beyond their work.''
   Reed was born in Kansas City, but grew up in Phoenix. She began
dancing at 16, and after a year of college went to Las Vegas and
joined the Folies Bergere at the Tropicana.
   ``I was very green, but I had a lot of energy. I never thought
about acting until I spent a year and a half in the road company of
`A Chorus Line.' I moved to New York and got into the stage play
`Dancin',' and I started taking acting lessons.''
   Reed is married to Terrence O'Hara, a movie director and former
actor she met in acting class.
   In addition to Reed's camping adventure, she went to Europe this
summer to appear in the latest remake of ``Three Coins in the
Fountain,'' the story of three women seeking romance and fun in
Rome.
   This version, co-starring Loni Anderson, Stepfanie Kramer and
Anthony Newly, will be broadcast on CBS. The original, which won an
Oscar for its theme song, was made in 1954. A remake was released
10 years later, but the location was moved to Spain.
   The latest edition returns to Rome, but only a bit was filmed in
the Eternal City.
   ``We filmed most of it in Luxembourg, using it for Rome,'' Reed
said. ``Apparently it was cheaper and they had a warehouse we used
for a sound stage. They were shooting a `Dracula' movie at the same
time we were there.''

<HEAD>Past Use of Economic Santions Not That Successful</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States has achieved only limited
success with coercive economic sanctions like those being used
against Iraq, in part because of the difficulty in rallying the
rest of the world behind them.
   But Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait may have changed the
nature of the game.
   In the week since Iraqi tanks lumbered across the Kuwaiti
border, the oil-dependent world, with a rarely seen unanimity, has
cut off Iraqi oil shipments, barred all trade with Iraq and frozen
billions of dollars of Kuwaiti assets to shield them from Iraqi
looting.
   At the same time, U.S. forces are being deployed to the Middle
East to guard against an Iraqi invasion of Saudi Arabia.
   ``I would think that if this international lesson is taught
well, Saddam Hussein would act differently in the future,''
President Bush told a news conference last week. ``... A line has
been drawn in the sand. We're getting strong support from around
the world for what we've done.''.
   The economic offensive against Iraq has long and tangled roots.
   In 432 B.C. the Athenian leader Pericles declared economic war
against Megara, a rival Greek City state. History does not record
the results.
   But the results were clear in 1935 after the League of Nations
imposed sanctions against Benito Mussolini's Italy for its invasion
of Abyssinia, now Ethiopia.
   There was no deterrent effect although the action was seen by
some as a public relations boon for participating countries.
   British political leader Lloyd George said, cynically, that the
sanctions ``came too late to save Abyssinia, but they're just in
the nick of time to save the (British) government.''
   In the early 1980s, a grain embargo imposed by President Carter
failed to persuade the Soviet Union to withdraw from Afghanistan.
Moscow found the grain it needed elsewhere.
   American farmers complained they had been forced to suffer
needlessly. Critics said the United States had aimed at the Soviet
bear and ``shot itself in the foot,'' a phrase used repeatedly
since then by congressional opponents of other attempts to impose
sanctions.
   In a 1985 study published by the Institute for International
Economics, Gary Clyde and Jeffrey Schott said economic sanctions
had been used successfully only 39 times since 1914. In the
remaining 69 cases, they said, the sanctions had little effect.
   American attempts to use the economic weapon have most often
failed because other countries could not be persuaded to follow the
U.S. lead.
   John Spanier, professor of political science at the University
of Florida, says sanctions work best when there is widespread
agreement by many nations about the wisdom or necessity of
employing them.
   ``Individual national sanctions are rarely effective,'' he said
in his book ``Games Nations Play.''
   ``Sanctions will inflict only temporary pain if alternative
sources of supplies and export markets are available,'' Spanier
said.
   Some examples of Washington's experience with sanctions:
   _In 1988, U.S. sanctions wrecked the fragile Panamanian economy
but did not dislodge the country's ruler, Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega. It took a U.S. invasion to do that.
   _The longstanding U.S. embargo of Fidel Castro's Cuba has done
little to erode his hold on the country but has caused considerable
economic difficulty.
   _Bush's economic sanctions against China after the 1989 massacre
in Tiananmen Square in Beijing resulted in only token moderation in
that nation's policies. Some of those sanctions have been eased.
   _President Carter's decision to stop U.S. purchases of Iranian
oil after the 1979 seizure of the U.S. Embassy in Tehran gave an
impression the administration was acting firmly in the hostage
crisis. But it was largely symbolic since the United States
purchased little Iranian oil.
   On the other hand, the sanctions imposed by the United States
and other nations against South Africa's white minority government
may have significantly slowed that nation's rate of economic growth
and been a potent psychological factor in persuading white leaders
to deal with the black majority.
   Aside from Iraq, U.S. economic sanctions still are in effect
against South Africa, Libya, Cuba, Vietnam, North Korea and
Cambodia.
   Before the Kuwaiti invasion, the Bush administration had
objected to proposals for sanctions against Iraq.
   John Kelly, assistant secretary of State for Middle Eastern
affairs, told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on June 15
that ``based on past experience, we do not believe that legislating
unilateral trade and economic sanctions would help us to achieve
U.S. goals with Iraq.''
   He said then that there was ``no prospect'' then that other
nations would follow the U.S. lead.
   The situation changed drastically after Saddam's troops headed
into Kuwait.
   The United States was joined by the Soviet Union in a joint
condemnation of Iraq. Moscow cut off the flow of weapons to its
erstwhile Middle East ally. Iraq's other major arms suppliers,
including China, said they would do the same.
   The 12-nation European Economic Community followed the United
States in imposing stiff economic sanctions. So did Japan.
   The United Nations Security Council voted comprehensive and
mandatory trade and business sanctions, and directed Saudi Arabia
and Turkey to cut off the flow of Iraqi oil through pipelines which
cross their national territory.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher conceded a naval
blockade might be necessary to stop the export of Iraqi oil by
ship. And Bush dispatched air, naval and ground forces to shield
Saudi Arabia from possible Iraqi attack.
   While some questioned the long-term will of the United States
and its allies to accept the sanction-related rise in oil prices,
others were optimistic that the sanctions would work.
   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., a former chairman of the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee, said: ``Iraq's wealth comes only from
oil and it is a food dependent country. That leaves it in a state
of comparative weakness. Sanctions on food and oil will cause grave
damage to the economy of Iraq.''
   During the Reagan administration, after Iraq had been accused of
using poison gas against its Kurdish minority, the Senate voted
three times and the House twice to impose sanctions against Iraq.
   But the administration successfully squelched them on grounds
that they would hurt U.S. agricultural exports and hinder rather
than enhance efforts to encourage Hussein to show restraint.
   Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Claiborne Pell,
D-R.I., said the failure to send Hussein a strong message against
the use of poison gas may have encouraged him on the path that
eventually led his tanks across the Kuwaiti border.

<HEAD>Here It Comes Again: Gas Nozzle Pointed at America's Head</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT DVORCHAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP National Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This isn't the first time Americans have been
forced to pay more for gas while U.S. oil companies profited from
turmoil in the Middle East.
   Think back 17 years, to the Arab oil embargo of 1973, to lines
at gas stations and rules restricting fill-ups to odd or even days.
The circumstances were different, but the scenario was the same:
The nozzle of the gas pump was held to Uncle Sam's head like a gun.
   Despite the jolt of that five-month embargo and a replay in 1979
during the Iranian revolution, the United States is more dependent
than ever on foreign countries for its oil habit.
   ``This country went back to sleep on energy about 1980. Now
we're in a defensive position and we don't have a game plan,'' said
David Freeman, a California utility executive and an energy adviser
to Presidents Johnson and Nixon.
   ``We were led to believe by our leaders in the 1980s we could
have a party, we could go back to gas guzzling and we could
continue the joyride,'' Freeman said. ``To continue the joyride on
Arab oil is a risky proposition.''
   The 1973 action was a producer embargo. The Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries shut off the tap to the United States
for its support of Israel in the 1973 war with Egypt.
   What's going on today is a consumer embargo. The United States
won't take any oil from Iraq because of its Aug. 2 absorption of
Kuwait. So Americans must either make up the difference somewhere
else, or make sacrifices.
   Although there is no shortage of oil in the United States or the
world, prices rose 18 cents a gallon at the pump by Friday. Seven
airlines also raised ticket prices to offset higher fuel costs.
   Reaction was as wrathful as it was in 1973, when most Americans
blamed the oil companies and the government for their plight and
not the Arabs, according to the National Opinion Research Center in
Chicago.
   Oil companies back then pocketed record profits while gasoline
escalated from 39 cents a gallon to 53 cents before the embargo
ended March 18, 1974.
   ``A more cynical view lays the fault for this country's present
difficulties to the economic greed of the oil industry,'' the
American Association for the Advancement of Science said in a study
at the time.
   Compare that to current charges of war profiteering.
   ``The big oil companies have gone on a feeding frenzy. This
isn't panic. This is greed,'' said Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev.,
chairman of the Senate consumer subcommittee.
   ``They're ripping us off,'' said New York Gov. Mario Cuomo.
   ``We think the oil companies carried out a pre-emptive strike
not unlike Saddam Hussein's strike into Kuwait,'' said Ed
Rothschild, energy policy coordinator for Citizen Action, a
national consumer group based in Washington. ``They raised prices
and made an immediate windfall profit.''
   The oil companies contend they have acted responsibly this time,
and several have publicized price decreases following a warning by
President Bush against gouging.
   Bush also has appealed to Americans to conserve oil to head off
any future shortages. He made no specific demands, saying instead
that ``Americans everywhere must do their part.''
   His predecessors had to take much harsher action. In 1973, the
United States, then as now the biggest consumer of oil in the
world, paid dearly for its insatiable oil thirst.
   Gas stations, if they were able to stay open, had two-mile long
queues of customers who sometimes waged fist fights for gas.
President Nixon ordered stations closed on Sunday, and sales were
rationed on odd-even days based on license plate numbers. Billions
of ration coupons were printed but never used.
   Thermostats were ordered set at 68 degrees in the winter, and
the national speed limit was set at 55 mph to conserve.
   The country went on year-round daylight savings time.
   Independent truckers, outraged at seeing the price of diesel
fuel double, parked their rigs and halted shipments _ sometimes
violently. Armed convoys of the National Guard delivered goods and
Army helicopters patrolled some highways.
   Things eased when the embargo was lifted, at least until 1979
when the Shah of Iran was deposed and Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini
turned off his country's petroleum spigot.
   Gas prices skyrocketed from 69 cents to more than $1, long lines
forced a reprise of odd-even rationing and angry truckers again
shut down.
   President Carter, wearing a symbolic sweater, ordered
thermostats at settings that would save energy. He also installed
solar panels on the White House roof to heat water.
   Then Iran and Iraq began pumping more oil to pay for killing
each other. A worldwide surplus grew in the early 1980s and finally
resulted in a tumultuous price collapse four years ago, when prices
plunged from more than $30 a barrel to under $10. Oil was cheap,
and the energy shortage was ancient history.
   That situation more or less prevailed until recent months, when
Iraq began making noises about raising oil prices to repay war
debts. Then the Iraqis invaded oil-rich neighbor Kuwait Aug. 2 and
threatened Saudi Arabia, owner of the world's richest oil reserves.
   Once more, American vulnerability is exposed.
   A nation with 6 percent of the world's population drinks up 27
percent of the world's oil. Half of the country's oil consumption _
16.9 million barrels a day _ must be imported.
   That's a bigger percentage of imports than 1973, when about
one-third of the oil came from foreign sources and dreams of
self-sufficiency disappeared like exhaust fumes.
   Oil is the nation's top energy source. Oil accounts for 42
percent of U.S. energy needs, and about 63 percent of all oil used
goes for transportation, mainly the 180 million cars, trucks and
buses on U.S. highways.
   In 1973, 47 percent of the nation's energy came from oil. About
53 percent went for transportation, according to the Department of
Energy.
   Some things have changed.
   Since 1973, the reliance on oil to make electricity has been
halved.
   The average car got 12 miles per gallon in 1973 and was half as
efficient as foreign cars. Today, the average is 27.8 mpg but the
trend in Detroit is back to luxury, gas-guzzlers.
   Utilities pitched better insulation, weather stripping and more
efficient bulbs and appliances to hold down increases in electric
bills.
   The government established a stock of 590 million gallons of oil
called the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which hasn't been tapped
yet.
   But 40 states have raised the speed limit to 65 mph. President
Reagan removed those solar panels from the White House roof. And
even the oil interests see a disturbing trend back to old habits.
   ``As long as the price wasn't too high and the product was
available, nobody has been thinking about it,'' said Joseph
Lastelic, spokesman for the American Petroleum Institute.
   ``You're not going to save your way out of it when you have lots
of cars, lots of air conditioners, a high standard of living and
all those wonderful things,'' Lastelic said. ``People are not
likely to give most of that up.''

<HEAD>Controversy Bedevils Teaching of History in Modern Britain</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JESSICA BALDWIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British students learn all about Florence
Nightingale, the heroic nurse of the Crimean battlefields, but what
of Mary Seacole, a Jamaican nurse who served with equal devotion in
the same war?
   Therein lies the heart of an intellectual wrangle over how
history should be taught in British schools.
   One side says Britain's own history comes first. The other
believes that, in what has become an ethnically diverse country,
one child's footnote is another's historical landmark.
   Most students know about Cecil Rhodes, the Victorian empire
builder who dreamed of a Cape-to-Cairo railroad. But how many have
heard of King William Dappa Pepple Bonny V of Nigeria, who was
exiled with his wife Annie from their realm and lived in London in
the 19th century?
   British children learn about Anglo-Saxon settlers, but the
contribution of Jewish settlers in the Middle Ages is often
overlooked.
   Debate centers on a national ``core'' curriculum mandated by the
Education Reform Bill of 1988 in history as well as English, math
and science-technology. The reform limits local choices, but does
not do away with them.
   The curriculum recommended by a history study group ``is the
only one that has generated the heat,'' Rozina Visram, a former
teacher, said in an interview.
   ``Academics from high and mighty universities have thrown their
hats into the ring. No other document has been given such a long
consultation.''
   Those who approach history as a force in molding national pride
and identity view the curriculum reform as a means of regaining the
ground that has been slipping away since the liberal 1960s.
   They want a return to teaching Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher's ``great landmarks of British history'': the life of King
Henry VIII, Nelson's victory at Trafalgar, the Battle of Waterloo,
the Battle of Britain.
   Opponents contend minority history must be included in a country
whose ethnic minorities now total 2.6 million people.
   Children of the inner cities will not ``switch on to an
all-white male experience,'' said Sylvia Collicott, a senior
lecturer at the North London Polytechnic.
   ``In the classroom, you can't tell kids what to do; they won't
do that anymore. They expect to be engaged. They won't sit there
and take that.''
   Local schools have adapted to the cultural changes. In Bradford,
where 53 of the 231 schools have non-white majorities, students
learn a little of everything.
   Tonnie Ecker's children attend Birkby School in Kirkliees,
suburban Bradford, where ``just about every ethnic festival is
celebrated.''
   ``It's wonderful,'' she said. ``They come back and tell you the
stories about various gods and all that. Sometimes their hands are
covered for three days with mehandi patterns,'' butterfly or flower
designs painted in a reddish dye.
   The reform does not prohibit local diversity and ethnic
celebrations, but critics say it makes so many detailed
prescriptions of what should be in the curriculum that it leaves no
room for ethnic studies.
   Robert Skidelsky, a historian at Warwick University, said
history trains people for citizenship, ``and it touches many raw
nerves.''
   So vehemently have academics disagreed that some fear the
government will abandon the history reforms..
   Skidelsky got into the debate when his son took a test that
instructed him to ``imagine that you are a Palestinian gunman
attacking the Israeli Olympic team in Munich.''
   The question was part of the empathy theory of teaching history,
which asks students to imagine themselves as players on the
historical stage.
   ``There were too many theories floating around,'' Skidelsky said
in an interview. ``Pupils were becoming guinea pigs.''
   Michael Barber, education policy director for the National Union
of Teachers, feels the curriculum is too detailed.
   ``What we need at the national level is an interstate highway
map of the country, as opposed to a map of all the local state
roads and footpaths,'' said Barber, a former high school history
teacher.
   For instance, the working group's says students aged 7 to 11
should study invaders and settlers; the Romans, Anglo-Saxons and
Vikings in Britain; life in Tudor and Stuart times; Victorian
Britain; ancient Egypt and Greece, and exploration from 1450 to
1550.
   Each topic is divided into four areas: political; economic,
technological-scientific; social-religious, and cultural-aesthetic.
   ``There are hundreds and hundreds of detailed prescriptions,''
said Ted Wragg, director of Exeter University's school of education.
   He finds the proposals arbitrary. As an example, he said,
students aged 14 to 16 studying modern American history would be
required to learn about President Franklin D. Roosevelt and Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr., but President John F. Kennedy and the civil
rights movement would be optional.
   Detractors, including the teachers' union, say less than the
recommended 50 percent of class time should be devoted to British
history.
   Mrs. Thatcher supports a heavy emphasis on British history and
told the House of Commons concentrating on the names of England's
kings and queens, statesmen and battles was ``absolutely right.''
   Skidelsky feels the proposed curriculum benefits the majority:
``Some areas have got to adopt entirely unconventional methods, but
most people in Britain are part of the great middle class bulge and
go to a very standard school.''
   Although the opposition Labor Party accused Mrs. Thatcher of
seeking to indoctrinate children with her own view of history,
Skidelsky doesn't believe politics is involved.
   ``The government has felt a responsiblity to increase its
involvement because of testing which shows British school children
are behind those in other countries,'' he said.

   Promotions to move out summer merchandise and good weather
boosted business at some big store chains in July.
   But modest industrywide sales growth failed to impress analysts
who predict possibly tighter times in retailing for the rest of the
year. Industry analysts said Thursday there was a continuation last
month of a gradual slowdown in consumer spending.
   An index of 17 leading chains compiled by Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.

percent in July from a year earlier, little different from June's
5.8 percent year-to-year gain.

   With the possibility of a strike at
United Parcel Service of America, Inc., businesses already have
switched to other delivery services, passing on higher costs and
warning of slower shipments.
   The two choices closest to the ground-based service offered by
UPS are the United States Postal Service and Roadway Package
System, Inc., of Pittsburgh.
   Other companies, such as TNT Skypak, Federal Express, and DHL
Worldwide Express, are mainly air-delivery services with faster
service, but also higher prices.
   Beechmont Press, a commercial publishing company in Louisville,
Ky., switched to RPS because it was afraid its packages might get
stuck in the UPS system if a strike was called, said Beverly
Anderson, a customer service representative.
   She said Beechmont was also using Federal Express for areas not
serviced by RPS, and the added costs were being passed on to the
consumer.
   ``It's not nearly as handy as UPS,'' Anderson said. UPS ``came
here every night and loaded up the skid and was gone and that was
the end of it. Now, there's a lot more planning.''
   Land's End, an in-home catalog giant based in Dodgeville, Wis.,
has given its customers one option of spending $5 more per shipment
to have goods sent via Federal Express, said spokeswoman Charlotte
LaComb.
   LaComb said the apparel company has told customers reluctant to
spend the extra money _ the $5 is in addition to a regular $3.50
handling charge _ that their other option is to order the
merchandise and have Land's End hold it until the UPS situation is
settled.
   The company already sends a small percentage of merchandise
through the U.S. Postal Service, she said.
   But the Postal Service announced in late July that it wouldn't
be able to absorb UPS's business if there was a strike.
   The Teamsters union has threatened UPS with a nationwide strike
if a new three-year contract is rejected by its 150,000 members at
UPS. Teamsters officials will start counting ballots Friday, and an
announcement of the outcome could take several days.
   UPS delivers more than 10 million packages a day, 20 times more
than the Postal Service.
   The Postal Service has developed contingency plans that would
restrict to four the number of parcels that any one customer could
send, and would require shippers of large numbers of packages to
make reservations.
   Other companies are also turning to the Postal Service,
including L.L. Bean, Inc., an outdoor clothing company based in
Freeport, Maine, and Bruce Medical Supply, a home medical supply
company based in Waltham, Mass.
   ``To the extent we can, we're allocating more than we would
normally to the Postal Service,'' said L.L. Bean spokesman Kilton
Andrew. L.L. Bean sent 70 percent of its 11.3 million packages via
UPS in 1989, he said.
   Andrew said the company is using the Postal Service to deliver
to points west of the Mississippi.
   Richard Najarian, president of Bruce Medical Supply, which sends
up to 1,500 packages a day, said once a UPS contract is signed, his
company is likely to return to the familiar boxy, brown trucks.
   ``It's really the only show in town,'' Najarian said.
   Spiegel Inc., of Oak Brook, Ill., the nation's largest in-home
catalog company, has been making contingency plans since the
beginning of July, spokeswoman Mary Dale Walters said.
   ``It's the first time in a long time our system has been really
put to the test, but you can't survive in this business unless you
have a degree of flexibility,'' Walters said.
   She said Spiegel, which sends out 50,000 packages by UPS each
day, will send packages by other means and using other routes, but
declined to discuss specifics.

   Hollis L. Harris, the Delta Air Lines Inc.
veteran named to replace Frank Lorenzo as head of Continental
Airlines Holdings Inc., has a solid reputation in the industry and
said he's looking forward to the new job.
   ``I wanted to be the chief executive officer of a major U.S.
airline,'' Harris, 58, said Thursday. As president and chief
operating officer at Delta, he was No. 2 to Chairman and CEO Ronald
W. Allen.
   Allen is several years younger than Harris, ``so the chances of
doing it at Delta are very slim,'' Harris said.
   Harris spoke with Lorenzo at a New York news briefing held to
announce the change. Lorenzo, the CEO of his airline holding
company for nearly two decades, told reporters his replacement is
one of the most able in the business and said ``we're very excited
to be able to attract Hollis Harris.''
   Terms of his new job weren't disclosed, but industry analysts
said it was likely to be a lucrative deal that could make Harris
wealthy.
   ``It's a chance for him to maximize his financial net worth
before he retires. I'm sure he got an attractive stock ownership
package,'' said Kevin C. Murphy, an airline industry analyst with
Morgan Stanley in New York.
   Lorenzo, one of the most well known figures in the industry,
said he was getting out of the business after a stormy life at the
center of major labor disputes at Continental and Eastern airlines.
   Harris entered Delta's executive suites in 1969 as vice
president in charge of facilities and became president in 1987. He
started at the company in 1954 as a transportation agent in Atlanta.
   ``The decision to leave Delta after 36 years was not an easy
one,'' Harris said, but he called the new position ``a challenge I
cannot resist.''
   Lorenzo praised his successor, calling Harris ``one of the
industry's most experienced and highly regarded executives.''
   Analyst Murphy agreed. ``I think it's a real coup (for
Continental),'' he said.
   ``It's a loss for Delta, but Delta has such capable layers of
management that they'll be able to survive. Life will go on for
Delta,'' Murphy said.
   Delta officials said Allen would assume Harris' duties.
   Harris will be entering a much more heated labor environment
than he ever faced at Delta, where, other than the pilots and
dispatchers, the employees are non-union.
   But Rhea Nicolls, a spokesman for the local Air Line Pilots
Association, the union which represents Delta pilots, said Harris
would be a positive influence at Continental.
   ``After Frank Lorenzo, everyone will be very happy to have
Hollis Harris there,'' Nicolls said. ``He's fair and honest, and
has always been a real gentleman.
   ``He had a good reputation'' with the union, Nicolls said.

   Frank Lorenzo parlayed his airline holding
company into a leading force in the industry, but along the way
incurred the wrath of organized labor which vilified him as a union
buster.
   The inability of Lorenzo and the unions to make peace with each
other played an indirect but important role in his announcement
Thursday that he was exiting the airline business after more than
two decades.
   The 50-year-old entrepreneur, who came to symbolize a tumultuous
decade of airline deregulation, said he is selling most of his
stake in Continental Airlines Holdings Inc. to Scandinavian
Airlines System. The leading foreign carrier has held a small stake
in Houston-based Continental for two years.
   Lorenzo also is resigning as chairman and chief executive, to be
replaced by Delta Air Lines Inc. President Hollis L. Harris, a
highly respected manager lured to Continental after a discreet
search that started four months ago.
   The negative publicity that came to haunt Lorenzo and his
company was an important element in his decision to get out,
Lorenzo told reporters at a news briefing in New York.
   ``It's been perfectly obvious to me that I personally have
become a lightning rod for many of the attacks that the company has
taken in the process of making the changes that have been
required,'' Lorenzo said.
   ``This transaction allows me to step aside and allows the
company to have a new management,'' he said. Asked what he would do
now, Lorenzo said, ``Take a little time to catch my breath. I
haven't had much time to do that.''
   The departure of Lorenzo marks the end of an era, but it didn't
end the criticism of him by organized labor.
   ``We can all shout `hallelujah!,''' said E.J. Breen, chairman of
the Eastern Airlines pilots strike committee.
   ``Clearly, nobody denies his genius to put deals together. But
as for his ability to operate (airlines), he's a complete
failure,'' Breen said in a telephone interview from Miami, where
Eastern is headquartered. ``The way I'll remember him is as a
tyrant who destroyed lives and walked away with pockets full of
money and not a care in the world for what he has done.''
   Others reacted with a similar mix of satisfaction and
resentment. The International Association of Machinists, which has
led the Eastern strike from the start, said he was largely
responsible for the problems in his company.
   ``Frank Lorenzo demolished Eastern Airlines, wreaked havoc on
thousands of workers' lives and severely devalued Continental
Airlines,'' said John Peterpaul, IAM general vice president. ``Our
condolences to whatever industry he stalks next.''
   Lorenzo will get nearly $30 million in severance payments and
sale proceeds. But that is only a fraction of what his airlines
were worth years ago in better times.
   From his plunge into the flying business in the 1960s, the
Harvard MBA helped pioneer innovations ranging from cut-rate fares
to the industry's first hostile takeover. Lorenzo built his holding
company into the largest airline company in the country, owning
both Continental and Eastern.
   In 1966, he and Harvard classmate Robert Carney formed a
financial advisory firm. Two years later, they created Jet Capital
Corp., which bought a controlling interest in Texas International
Airlines in 1972.
   Lorenzo, then 32, was the carrier's youngest president.
   His image as a union buster began when he fought organized labor
at Continental Airlines and won.
   In 1981, Lorenzo merged Texas International with Continental
after a bitter takeover battle. Two years later, he put
Continental, then the nation's eighth-largest carrier, under
bankruptcy protection, scrapped labor contracts and hired strike
replacements at lower pay.
   Lorenzo subsequently acquired New York Air, People Express and
Frontier airlines, which have been merged into Continental.
   He didn't face another labor fight until he acquired Eastern.
The unions waged a bitter strike against the carrier and made
Lorenzo the target of their hatred.
   Lorenzo lost control of Eastern altogether in April when U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge Burton Lifland placed the airline in the hands of
trustee Martin Shugrue. Texas Air Corp. then changed its name to
Continental Airlines Holdings.

<HEAD>More Oil Companies Lower Or Freeze Prices</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIVIAN MARINO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The public outcry over alleged price gouging has
apparently lead more big oil companies to trim or freeze thier
gasoline prices, with some cutting nearly a nickel a gallon.
   Others said they were holding prices steady and promised to
abide by requests from President Bush and lawmakers to practice
restraint during the rising tensions in the Persian Gulf.
   Four big companies _ Texaco Inc., BP America Inc., Phillips
Petroleum Co. and Conoco Inc. _ announced Thursday they were
trimming gasoline prices, with cuts ranging from a penny to 4 cents
a gallon. The Phillips reduction of 1.8 cents a gallon was the
second cut in two days.
   Those announcing temporary price freezes included Amoco Corp.,
Unocal Corp. and Getty Petroleum Corp.
   The companies said they largely were responding to the recent
easing of oil prices following a sharp runup after the Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2. But industry analysts said the
companies also couldn't ignore the pubic outcries of price gouging
and Bush's admonition.
   Service station owners applauded the action and many were
expected to eventually pass on their savings to motorists.
   ``A random sampling shows that some already have lowered their
prices 1 or 2 cents a gallon. Those that don't will at least keep
their prices the same,'' said Joseph L. Koach, executive director
of the Service Station Dealers of America in Washington.
   A spot check of gas stations Thursday by the American Automobile
Association of America said prices on average continued to increase
nationally but at a much slower rate than in recent days. It said
the average price of self-service unleaded regular was $1.237 a
gallon, up 1 to 2 cents from Wednesday.
   Unleaded gas has risen more than 16 cents a gallon since Iraq
invaded Kuwait.
   On Wednesday, Atlantic Richfield Co. froze its wholesale gas
prices for a week and Phillips Petroleum Co. cut its price by 4.5
cents a gallon after Bush in a nationally televised speech urged
big oil companies to show price restraint.
   Other big companies like Exxon Corp., Chevron Corp., Mobil Corp.
and Shell Oil Co., said they haven't raised prices in recent days
and would practice restraint in making any future price changes.
All the companies said any pricing decisions would directly reflect
market conditions.
   The oil companies have been denying allegations by consumer
groups and politicians that they've been using instability in the
Persian Gulf as an excuse to drive up prices at the pumps.
   The companies said the increases reflected a huge jump in crude
prices on the open markets as well as the threat that oil supplies
might be disrupted.
   ``Since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, crude prices have
increased approximately 35 percent and the openly traded market for
gasoline supplies has jumped about 20 cents a gallon,''
Houston-based Shell Oil Co. said in a statement.
   Although Koach said many gas stations would be in a good
position to pass on oil company rollbacks to their customers, some
experts said it may take some time for stations to actually realize
any savings. That is because gas deliveries vary, from as little as
once a week to as frequent as three times a week.
   Koach also indicated it might be hard for some station operators
to lower prices now, especially those who had been reluctant to
pass on the previous price increases for fear of losing customers.
   ``It's economic suicide to bite the hand that feeds you,'' said
Dennis DeCota, owner of Red Hill Union 76 station in Novato,
Calif., about 35 miles north of San Francisco.
   DeCota said he had raised prices 11 cents a gallon since the
Iraqi invasion, but more than half of that went to offset a recent
gas tax instituted in California.
   Among the specific changes announced Thursday:
   _Texaco cut its gasoline price to resellers by as much as 3
cents a gallon.
   _BP cut prices at its gas pumps by 3 cents per gallon.
   _Conoco lowered by 3 to 4 cents its wholesale prices for
gasoline and by a penny its price for diesel fuel.
   _Getty froze gas prices for a week.
   _Unocal froze prices until Aug. 16.
   Oil companies have been criticized frequently since gas prices
soared from about 39 cents a gallon in 1973 to 53 cents a year
later following the Arab oil embargo. Prices climbed to 69 cents by
1978, before surging above $1 when Iranian supplies were cut off
after its 1979 revolution.
   More recently, prices jumped after the Exxon Valdez spill off
the Alaska coast last year and heating oil skyrocketed during a
severe December freeze. Despite allegations, no profiteering or
collusion by companies was proven.
   In defending the price hikes, companies have said that while it
can take up to 90 days for crude oil to reach the United States
from the Middle East, companies usually pay the market price in
effect when it arrives at the refinery, not the price when it was
contracted for.
   They also noted that large amounts of gasoline are purchased on
often volatile ``spot'' markets.

   William H. Donaldson has a resume that seems to
run on and on like a stock ticker tape.
   The 59-year-old securities industry veteran will need to call on
his experiences on Wall Street, in Washington and in the Ivy League
as head of the nation's largest stock exchange during what promises
to be a turbulent 1990s.
   Donaldson, a friend of President Bush, was named chairman and
chief executive officer of the New York Stock Exchange on Thursday,
taking over one of the highest profile jobs in American business at
a time of rapid evolution.
   He succeeds John J. Phelan Jr., who is stepping down at the end
of the year after winning almost universal praise for calmly
shepherding the Big Board through the nightmare of the October 1987
market crash.
   ``There's a whole slew of things,'' Donaldson said about his
challenges in an interview after his appointment, which was rumored
for weeks on Wall Street, was formally announced.
   More specifically, he cited the globalization of securities
trading, increased competition from overseas, rapidly changing
technology, new regulations and 24-hour trading _ which threaten to
dramatically alter the 198-year-old exchange.
   ``All of that with a bottom line emphasis of maintaining the
believability of the marketplace,'' Donaldson said. ``The
fluctuations of the last decade _ a lot of people don't understand
it.''
   Before he officially takes over Jan. 1, Donaldson is expected to
solicit advice and support from his many contacts. Already he
appears to have broad support on Wall Street.
   ``One of the important things is to earn the confidence of the
people with whom he's dealing,'' said James J. Maguire, chairman of
Henderson Brothers Inc., a top NYSE floor firm. ``I think he's very
acceptable because of his broad experience not only in the
securities industry but in politics and elsewhere.''
   ``He's a very conceptual guy,'' said his former partner, Richard
Jenrette, now chairman of Equitable Life Assurance Society of the
United States. ``He thinks through things quite carefully. He will
have interesting ideas and angles.''
   A native of Buffalo, Donaldson's first job on Wall Street was at
the old brokerage G.H. Walker &amp; Co., run by Bush's uncle Herbert
Walker. Donaldson was a classmate of the president's brother,
Jonathan, at Yale University and is friends with the Bush family.
   Friends describe Donaldson as proper in the mold of Wall
Street's stodgy old ``white-shoe'' investment firms. ``But not a
preppy snob at all,'' Jenrette said. ``He would be kind of an
intellectual white-shoe type.'' At his news conference Thursday,
Donaldson appeared slightly stiff.
   In 1959, just one year out of Harvard Business School, Donaldson
and two friends founded Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette. He left in
1973 after the company grew from its initial $100,000 investment to
the nation's 10th largest brokerage.
   Donaldson served in the Nixon and Ford administrations, first as
an undersecretary of state to Henry Kissinger in 1973-74 before
becoming special White House counsel to Vice President Nelson
Rockefeller. In between he helped New York Gov. Hugh Carey, a
Democrat, pick a new administration.
   ``It was just out of the blue,'' Donaldson said of the
appoinment by Kissinger. ``I didn't know him, I had never met him.
It was the last thing in the world I expected to do at that time
but I did it.''
   Donaldson helped Rockefeller devise an extensive plan for the
nation to utilize alternate energy sources. The proposal died in
Congress when the Carter administration arrived.
   A Yale trustee, Donaldson in 1975 helped found and served as
dean of Yale's School of Organization and Management until 1980,
when he returned to Wall Street to open a private investment firm,
Donaldson Enterprises Inc.
   Donaldson said his experience setting up the school _ which
specializes in the public as well as private sector _ would help at
the exchange, a private institution with an awesome public
responsibility.
   Donaldson becomes the fourth full-time, paid chairman of the Big
Board since the job was created in 1972. He was tabbed by a
nine-member search panel appointed after Phelan in February
announced plans to retire at the end of the year. Phelan, 59 and
chairman since May 1984, will remain an adviser for NYSE relations
with foreign stock exchanges.

   Fear of rising inflation and unemployment coupled with anxiety
over shrinking personal net worth will restrain retail sales growth
for the rest of this year, industry analysts say.
   The nation's major chain stores on Thursday reported mixed July
results, with business at several big retailers getting a boost
from price markdowns and other promotions to unload summer
merchandise.
   But industrywide results were unimpressive and a growing number
of forecasters raised red flags about the outlook for the second
half of the year, a time when retailers do the bulk of their annual
business.
   ``The events over the past several weeks cause us to be much
more concerned about consumer sentiment and consumers' willingness
to purchase aggressively,'' said Thomas Tashjian, a retail analyst
at Seidler Amdec Securities Inc.
   Seidler Amdec recently reduced its 1991 earnings projections for
the retailers it follows and recommended slimmer holdings of retail
stocks in investment portfolios.
   Jeffrey Edelman, who tracks retailers for the investment firm
Barclays de Zoete Wedd, said this year's steady erosion in consumer
spending could worsen due to economic fallout from the Middle East
crisis.
   Inflation fears and weakness in the stock market have shaken
confidence and caused consumers to reassess their financial health.
People already were feeling poorer because of the slide in real
estate values.
   ``I think general merchandise sales are likely to weaken through
the end of the year,'' Edelman said.
   Sales growth was mixed last month. Specialty apparel chains
mostly fared better than general merchandisers.
   An index of 17 leading chains compiled by Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.
indicated that sales at stores open at least a year rose an average
of 5.7 percent in July from a year earlier, little different from
June's 5.8 percent year-to-year gain.
   ``We would characterize the July sales reports as mixed with
some benefits from the seasonal weather,'' said Merrill Lynch
analyst Jeffrey Feiner. ``Moreover, sales were aided by heavy
promotion on the part of retailers to clear inventories as they
move into the more important back-to-school selling season.''
   July typically is a cleanup month for retailers. They clear out
summer leftovers and start rolling out new autumn lines.
   Price cuts and other promotional activity may have slightly
exceeded normal levels. Store operators were left with too much
merchandise because May's poor weather discouraged shoppers and led
to disappointments at the cash register.
   Several nationwide general merchandisers posted results that
fell short of the industry average.
   Sears, Roebuck and Co. said its sales in the four weeks ended
Aug. 4 rose 3.7 percent from a year earlier. Sales at stores open
at least a year moved 3.1 percent higher.
   These same-store results are widely regarded as the best
indicator of a retailer's performance. Tallies that include new
stores can be inflated because business frequently is busier
immediately after an opening than it ends up being over time.
   Sears, the nation's largest retailer in terms of sales volume
last year, has been struggling to keep ahead of its faster growing
competitors.
   The company on Wednesday announced a major change in command in
an apparent bid to salvage a merchandising strategy that analysts
say isn't working. Edward A. Brennan, chairman of the corporation,
will run the merchandise group, ousting Michael Bozic, who took
over a new position as president.
   ``By deposing Bozic, they are publicly acknowledging they are
doing very, very poorly,'' said New York-based retail consultant
Kurt Barnard.
   Second-ranked retailer K mart Corp. reported its total July
sales rose 12.1 percent over July 1989. But on a comparable store
basis, sales grew a more modest 2.2 percent.
   Wal-Mart Stores Inc., as usual, beat its two bigger rivals.
Total sales leaped 21 percent while same-store sales grew 8 percent
in July. The rapidly growing discounter is expected to challenge
Sears and K mart for the No. 1 ranking in terms of nationwide
revenue this year.
   Several specialty apparel retailers also outperformed the
industry.
   The Gap Inc., for instance, said its July sales jumped 36
percent. Sales at stores open a year or longer rose 28 percent. The
Limited Inc. said its total sales grew 19 percent while its
same-store sales rose 6 percent.

   Here are the domestic July sales and sales for the year to date
reported Thursday by some of the nation's largest retailers.
   Many of the major companies have agreed to issue their monthly
results on the same date, similar to the practice in past years.
Monthly results had been released on different days earlier this
year.
   Some top retailers do not report their sales on a monthly basis,
including R.H. Macy &amp; Co. And, Montgomery Ward &amp; Co., a privately
held retailer, has stopped releasing its monthly sales. Reporting
periods vary slightly and not all retailers have the same fiscal
year.

<HEAD>Flint Strike Stops Ohio Plant Production</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FLINT, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A strike by workers at a General Motors
Corp. parts plant forced a work stoppage at an assembly plant in
Ohio and could halt production in at least two other plants,
officials said.
   The walkout at GM's AC Rochester Division Flint West plant came
Wednesday after negotiations with the United Auto Workers union on
employee grievances about health and safety issues broke off.
   The strike left the Moraine, Ohio, assembly plant without enough
parts to continue producing pickup trucks and sport utility
vehicles, so GM was forced to idle about 3,000 workers on Thursday.
   ``With no fuel tanks we can't assemble trucks,'' said Tony
Henderson, vice president of the International Union of Electrical,
Radio and Machine Workers Local 801, which represents union
employees at the Moraine plant.
   The 2,800 Flint workers make van doors and grilles, pickup truck
grilles and gasoline tanks.
   GM spokesman Tom Tatham said there are more than 3,400 workers
employed at the Moraine plant, which had been producing 56 vehicles
per hour.
   Two more plants could shut today, GM spokesman John Maciarz said.
   Maciarz said he was unable to say which plants might close next
if the strike continues. ``Obviously we want to see this settled as
soon as possible,'' he said.
   One of the plants fed by the striking Flint facility is GM's
luxury-car Orion plant in Oakland County.
   Meanwhile, bargainers from the company and United Auto Workers
Local 659 resumed negotiations Thursday in an effort to end the
work stoppage at the AC Rochester West manufacturing plant that now
threatens to shut as many as eight GM assembly plants.
   In addition to the Orion plant, the Pontiac East truck assembly
plant may not be able to begin production of 1991 models next week
as scheduled.

<HEAD>Chrysler to Replace Spirit-Acclaim in '95</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. plans to replace its
Dodge Spirit and Plymouth Acclaim compact cars in about five years,
and is pushing back the introduction of a new luxury car, an
executive says.
   Glenn Gardner, Chrysler's general manager of new platform
engineering, said Thursday that a new version of the Spirit-Acclaim
has a potential for more sales than a new luxury car, so the
introduction of the compact car was moved ahead of the luxury car.
   Originally, Chrysler's new luxury car, codenamed the LX, was to
be introduced shortly after its new midsize car, the LH, bowed in
late 1992 for the 1993 model year.
   Gardner said the company's most pressing product priority was
the LH. In fact, he said, Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca wants the
car out earlier.
   ``Mr. Iacocca said he wants six months (cut from the
introduction schedule). I told him he can't have it,'' Gardner
said. ``He's a very persistent individual.''
   Gardner's comments came during the fourth day of a week-long
management conference sponsored by the University of Michigan.
   ``An LX is obviously one of those (cars) you have a chance to do
or not do and not break the corporation,'' Gardner said.
``Obviously the LH is critical to the corporation.''
   Wall Street analysts have criticized Chrysler for opting to
build the Viper low-volume, high-performance sports car when the
company should accelerate development of the LH midsize car.
   Between the introduction of the LH and the Spirit-Acclaim
successor, Chrysler is expected to bring out a new subcompact car.
Chrysler left the subcompact segment when it shut down a Detroit
assembly plant that built the Dodge Omni and Plymouth Horizon last
February.
   The Spirit-Acclaim successor will be introduced sometime around
1995, Gardner said. The cars originally were introduced in the
spring of 1989 and are assembled in Newark, Del.
   Chrysler is realigning its vehicle development programs about a
year after Iacocca said a billion-dollar cost-cutting program would
not alter new-vehicle development plans.
   ``Our $15 billion, five-year program remains intact and we don't
comment on specific future products that are contained in that
program,'' Chrysler spokesman Tom Houston said.
   Also at the conference, Ford Motor Co. officially unveiled its
4.6-liter, V-8 engine for the 1991 Lincoln Town Car which goes into
production later this year.
   The engine to be built at Ford's $780 million revamped engine
plant in Romeo, Mich., is the first of the company's ``modular''
family of engines. Modular engines give manufacturers flexibility
and cost reductions by creating a common basic engine structure
with interchangeable components giving each kind of engine its own
characteristics.
   ``Overall, we estimate the new family of engines will share
about 350 parts, or about 75 percent of the engine,'' said David F.
Hagen, general manager of Ford's engine division. ``New V-8
variations will cost about $60 million to develop compared to about
$500 million for a typical new engine program.''
   He said the modular engine concept will be expanded to Ford's
huge Cleveland engine plant, which will build a new series of V-6
engines to go into production in the mid-1990s.

   Bankrupt savings and loans under government
management effectively added $1.35 billion to the cost of the
thrift bailout in the first three months of the year.
   Operating losses at the 350 failed, but still open, institutions
rose 35 percent from the $1 billion in operating red ink a year
earlier, when the S&amp;Ls were still managed privately, the Resolution
Trust Corp. said Thursday.
   However, the operating losses were down 16 percent from $1.61
billion in the last three months of 1989, the bailout agency said.
   Analysts said the operating loss increase from the first quarter
of 1989 does not necessarily mean the insolvent thrifts are being
managed poorly by the government.
   ``It may indicate the institutions are worse run or it may just
indicate they've had another year to deteriorate. ... Also,
interest rates have shifted,'' making it more difficult to earn
profits, said Martin Regalia, an economist with the National
Council of Savings Institutions.
   The figures, however, underscore the need to close the thrifts
quickly, even when it must keep and warehouse the S&amp;Ls' inherited
real estate, sour loans and other assets, Regalia said.
   The RTC noted that $443 million of the $1.35 million operating
loss occurred in 155 institutions that in the following quarter
were either closed or sold to new investors.
   ``Keeping these institutions open doesn't seem to help them,''
Regalia said. ``It would be nice if you could say we closed them
all down ... but that's what the RTC is trying to do.''
   The agency announced plans recently to close or sell 130 more
failed thrifts in the second half of 1990. But unless Congress
provides more bailout funds as requested by the Bush
administration, the RTC would have to drastically slow its
operations after September and fall short of the goal.
   At the same time, additional S&amp;Ls are failing _ 66 since March
31. In the next two years, the agency could end up taking over 230
to 550 more insolvent thrifts.
   Total losses for the failed thrifts in the first quarter of 1990
were $3.14 billion, up from $2.67 billion a year earlier and down
from $6.39 billion in the fourth quarter of 1989.
   But analysts said comparing those figures are less meaningful
because they largely reflect non-operating losses that are booked
when regulators force institutions to account for past mistakes and
long-delinquent loans.
   Total losses are largely ``the accumulated losses that occurred
two, three, four, five years ago and are finally being
recognized,'' said Bert Ely, a financial institutions analyst in
Alexandria, Va.
   ``Operating losses are the cost of carrying these institutions.
... It's an unavoidable cost until we get rid of these turkeys,''
Ely said.
   The RTC's first-quarter report was released two weeks after the
Office of Thrif Supervision said the 2,505 S&amp;Ls under private
management at the end of March lost $271 million.
   Thus, losses for the entire industry totaled $3.41 billion in
the first quarter, down from $3.6 billion a year ago and $9.5
billion in the previous three-month period. It was the best overall
result in a year and a half. Overall fourth quarter losses were $3
billion worse than initially reported earlier this year.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan's trade surplus shrank 10.3 percent in July
from a year earlier, largely due to increased imports, the Finance
Ministry said Friday.
   The ministry said the country's trade surplus declined to $5.38
billion in July from $5.99 billion a year earlier on a customs
clearance basis.
   Imports rose 6.0 percent to $18.50 billion from a year earlier
while exports rose 1.8 percent to $23.88 billion, the ministry said.
   The drop in the surplus marks a return to a recent declining
trend in Japan's trade gap, which had been steadily falling since
June 1989 until June 1990, when it jumped 27.6 percent.
   Ministry officials said a record increase in the imports of
finished products, including an 82 percent increase in aircraft and
440 percent increase in imports of works of art, contributed to the
rise in imports.
   The officials noted concern about economic sanctions and oil
embargoes against Iraq and Kuwait, decided earlier in the week.
   On a regional basis, Japan's trade surplus with the United
States narrowed 20.6 percent to $3.07 billion from a year earlier.
   Its surplus with the European Community shrank 29.8 percent to
$1.15 billion, while its surplus with Asia rose 42 percent to $2.48
billion, the ministry said.
   Japan calculates its trade surplus on a customs-clearance basis,
which includes freight and insurance costs in imports but not in
exports.

   The stock market headed lower today as traders
unloaded equities as a hedge against any surprise developments in
the Middle East over the weekend.
   After advancing in the previous two sessions, the market was not
expected to continue to build upon those gains, and trading
activity continued to slow from the brisk pace at mid-week.
   In the first half hour of trading, the Dow Jones average of 30
industrial stocks shed 7.18 points to 2,751.73.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 11 to 8 on the New York
Stock Exchangewith issues 524 down, 383 issues up and 505 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Boardtotaled 19.83 million shares
as of 10 a.m. on Wall Street.
   The NYSE composite index of all its listed common stocks was
down 0.20 at 186.04. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index stood at 341.47, down 0.02.
   The Labor Department reported wholesale prices edged down 0.1
percent in July and for the first seven months of the year advanced
at an annual rate of 3 percent, down sharply from the 4.8 percent
increase for all of 1989.
   ``It was a relatively positive number, but it doesn't seem to
have done anything positive for the market,'' said George Boyd III,
manager of equity research at Kidder Peabody &amp; Co. The government
noted in the report that prices were surveyed in mid-July, before
the Iraqi in
   Guinea Radio called the attack on its embassy a ``provocation''
and said three guards were taken hostage by rebels. In Abidjan,
sources were quoted as saying one woman was killed in the attack on
the Guinean Embassy.
   Doe spokesman Thompson said former Justice Minister Isaac Nyaplu
was wounded in the assassination attempt against Doe and appealed
for the international community to pressure the United States to
``excessive harassment to remove Doe.''
   But State Department deputy spokesman Richard Boucher said the
235 Marines airlifted into Monrovia Sunday to evacuate Americans
were there to protect the embassy and Americans and not to
intervene in the fighting or take sides.
   Boucher said the United States has evacuated 150 people from
Liberia this week, including the French and Italian ambassadors.

   Commodore International Ltd. said
Friday it lost $3.5 million in its last fiscal quarter though sales
increased.
   The personal computer maker, which has been struggling to
increase its profitability, said the loss for the quarter ended
June 30 equaled 11 cents a share.
   Revenue for the quarter totaled $198.1 million, compared with
$180.3 million for the same quarter last year.
   The company said earnings were hurt by an increase in operating
expenses due to greater marketing costs. The company has been
promoting its Amiga model and computers compatible with those made
by International Business Machines Corp.
   Amiga sales rose by more than 40 percent in the quarter compared
with a year earlier, the company said. Sales of its older C64 model
were down.
   ``We remain fully committed to improving Commodore's financial
performance and capitalizing on the Amiga's unique capabilities for
the emerging multimedia marketplace,'' said Irving Gould, chairman
and chief executive officer.
   For the fiscal year ended June 30, Commodore said it earned $1.5
million, or 5 cents a share, down sharply from $51.3 million, or
$1.59 a share, in the previous fiscal year.
   Sales for the 12 months totaled $887.3 million, down from $939.7
million a year earlier.

   Wholesale prices in July edged down 0.1
percent, the government said today in a report seen by analysts as
the last respite from inflation before the Mideast crisis sent oil
prices soaring.
   The slight, seasonally adjusted decline in the Labor
Department's Producer Price Index for finished goods, one stop
short of retail, followed moderate gains of 0.2 percent in June and
0.3 percent in May.
   The drop in July was even better than the 0.1 percent or 0.2
percent rise expected by most economists.
   ``Obviously this number is history,'' said economist Donald
Ratajczak of Georgia State University. ``But what it shows is that
heading into the oil shock, inflation was tame.''
   The stock market shrugged off the news. After 90 minutes of
trading, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks shed 17.82
points to 2,741.09.
   Wholesale prices, which soared in January when a cold snap sent
fuel oil and vegetable costs spiraling, have remained virtually
unchanged from February through July, helped by six consecutive
drops in energy costs.
   For the first seven months of the defense budget would have to take
a larger reduction.

   The U.S. economy faces the twin threats of
inflation and recession if the oil price run-up caused by the
Middle East crisis continues for more than several weeks, analysts
say.
   ``It's a real monkey wrench that is creating real economic
distress for American households and businesses,'' said Allen
Sinai, an economist with the Boston Co. ``An oil price increase is
essentially a tax on consumption ... that causes consumers to cut
back in other areas.
   ``The oil shot will ... add a substantial dose of inflation as
crude oil prices work their way through the chain,'' Sinai said.
   The government reported today that wholesale prices in July
edged down 0.1 percent, but analysts predict that will be the last
respite from inflation before the Mideast crisis sent oil prices
soaring.
   The Labor Department noted that prices were surveyed in
mid-July, before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. Analysts expect the
six-month respite from wholesale price increases to end this month,
at least for three or four months until the economy absorbs the oil
shock.
   The economy has been weakening for several months, noted Charles
Stone, senior economist with Congress' Joint Economic Committee.
``No one is talking about a really severe recession but this oil
situation makes things a little bit worse,'' he said.
   How much worse? Experts agree that depends on how long the price
of oil remains in the range of $26 per 42-gallon barrel or higher,
which is nearly double the price two months ago.
   The benchmark price rose from $18 to $21 the day Iraq invaded
Kuwait, soared above $28 on Monday and dropped back to about $26
after it became apparent the United States would use military might
to keep Saudi Arabia's oil fields open.
   ``If prices stay up for two or three months, a recession will be
a reality,'' private analyst Joel Popkin said.
   ``Depending on how high the price goes, this definitely raises
the risk of recession, because higher prices drain purchasing power
out of the economy and send it to the Arabs,'' Fred Ribe of the
Congressional Budget Office said.
   ``If the Middle East situation is resolved in the near term, I
wouldn't expect a long-run impact on the economy,'' said Roy
Cordato, an analyst with the Washington-based Institute for
Research on the Economics of Taxation. The economy would suffer if
the run-up continued for more than a few months, he said.
   Many economists and politicians dread any increase in the price
of energy, especially oil, because no commodity has a greater
influence on inflation. When the price of oil goes up, it affects
the cost of fuel to plow a farmer's wheat field, to heat a baker's
oven and to cool the corner grocery. That raises the price of bread.
   The economy, measured by the Gross National Product, has little
growth to give up. It grew at an anemic rate of 1.5 percent in the
first half of the year.
   Richard Rahn, chief economist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,
doubts any long-range impact on the economy assuming that other
oil-producing countries will increase output to make up for the
loss of Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil, thus stabilizing prices.
   But Rahn said a sustained high price would worsen the recession
that he insists already is under way. ``The rule of thumb is that a
price increase of $5 in place for a year costs half a percentage
point of growth,'' he said.
   One of the most pessimistic forecasts on oil prices came from
Philip K. Verleger Jr., a visiting fellow with the Institute of
International Economics. He told Congress' Joint Economic Committee
earlier this week that prices could hit $45 to $50 a barrel unless
consuming nations open their strategic reserves.
   ``This new price shock will almost certainly trigger a recession
in both the United States and possibly throughout the
industrialized world,'' Verleger said. ``Real GNP will decline by 1
to 2 percent in the current quarter and 3 to 4 percent in the
fourth. Unemployment (now 5.7 percent) could rise to 7.5 percent by
the middle of 1991.''
   Another big question is how the Federal Reserve will respond to
higher oil prices. Many conservatives contend the central bank, in
its zeal to hold down inflation, has overreacted and made credit so
tight that a recession is inevitable.
   ``We are not contemplating recession,'' Treasury Secretary
Nicholas F. Brady said Wednesday. But he repeated the
administration's hope that the Federal Reserve will loosen credit
to stimulate the economy.

<HEAD>Soybean Futures Surge On USDA Crop Data</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices rose sharply this morning
on the Chicago Board of Trade, boosted by a government harvest
projection that was below market expectations.
   Corn futures also rose in reaction to Thursday's Agriculture
Department crop report while wheat futures were slightly lower amid
profit-taking after two days of strong gains, said Walter Spilka,
grain analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co.
   The USDA estimated the 1990 U.S. corn harvest at 7.85 billion
bushels, up 4 percent from last year's crop. The government
projected a soybean crop of 1.84 billion bushels, down 5 percent
from last year's harvest of 1.93 billion bushels.
   Both numbers were below market expectations, which averaged 7.92
billion bushels for corn and 1.86 billion bushels for soybeans.
   Spilka predicted the reaction to the crop report would be
short-lived and that traders would quickly return their attention
to growing conditions.
   ``They'll be trading weather by this afternoon,'' he said.
   In early trading, wheat futures were 1 cent to 1} cents lower
with the contract for delivery in September at $2.89\ a bushel;
corn was 1 cent to 2\ cents higher with September at $2.51} a
bushel; oats were \ cent to 1 cent higher with September at $1.20{
a bushel; and soybeans were 7 cents to 12 cents higher with August
at $6.08{ a bushel.
   Cattle futures were mostly lower in early trading on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange while pork futures were mixed.
   Live cattle were .02 cent to .13 cent lower with August at 78.75
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .30 cent lower with
August at 89.55 cents a pound; hogs were .15 cent lower to .85 cent
higher with August at 57.20 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were
.15 cent lower to .80 cent higher with August at 49.25 cents a
pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled lower on Thursday.

   Stock prices turned broadly lower today as a
call for Arab unity from Iraq's president sent a ripple of concern
through the market that events in the Middle East may not be
stabilizing.
   The market had been moving lower as traders unloaded equities to
hedge against any surprise developments overseas this weekend, but
prices turned sharply downward following the statement from Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein.
   ``It was quite inflamatory, and it added fuel to the fire'' in
an already pressured stock market, one analyst said.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks fell 27.47 points
to 2,731.44 at midday.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 13 to 6 on the New York
Stock Exchangewith issues 897 down, 415 issues up and 505 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Boardtotaled 70.66 million shares
as of noon on Wall Street against 71.94 million at the same time
Thursday.
   Saddam's speech, broadcast on national Iraqi television and read
by an unidentified announcer, upset a market that was beginning to
find its equilibrium.
   In reference to the U.S.-led multinational military presence in
nearby Saudi Arabia, Saddam called on all Arabs to ``condemn the
invaders and collaborators.''
   Traders who were lucky enough to catch the market before it
headed higher in the two previous sessions were taking profits
before the speech was broadcast. And new investors remained ``leary
about coming in,'' noted Charles Jensen, chief tecnical analyst at
MKI Securities Corp.
   Also pressuring stocks was a negative reaction in the credit
markets to the Labor Department's report showing wholesale prices
edged down 0.1 percent in July.
   ``It was a relatively positive number, but it doesn't seem to
have done anything positive for the market,'' said George Boyd III,
manager of equity research at Kidder Peabody &amp; Co.
   So far this year wholesale prices have advanced at an annual
rate of 3 percent, down sharply from the 4.8 percent increase for
all of 1989. But the government noted prices were surveyed in
mid-July, before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait sent oil prices
skyrocketing.
   Among actively traded Big Board issues, Unitel was up \ at 25|;
Boeing was down 1 at 53{; Wal-Mart was down | at 30, and Exxon was
up \ at 52&lsqb;.
   The NYSE composite index of all its listed common stocks was

value index stood at 340.11, down 1.38.

<HEAD>Posts 18 Percent Profit Increase for Second Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch food and home products
group, said Friday its second-quarter profit rose 18 percent,
helped by growth in its major markets.
   Unilever said its net earnings for the three months ended June
30 came to 311 million pounds, or $516 million, compared with 263
million pounds a year earlier.
   Pre-tax profit rose 4.8 percent to 477 million pounds, or $781
million, from 455 million pounds a year earlier.
   Sales rose 14 percent to 5.72 billion pounds, or $9.37 billion,
in the quarter from 5 billion pounds a year earlier.
   For the first six months of the year, its profit rose 18 percent
to 541 million pounds, or $898 million, from 457 million pounds a
year earlier.
   Sales gained 14 percent to 10.8 billion pounds, or $17.77
billion, from 9.51 billion pounds a year earlier.
   Sir Michael Angus, Unilever's chairman, said the six-month
results represented ``satisfactory progress.''
   Angus said that a ``measure of caution'' is needed for the
second half, however, given the uncertain outcome of events in the
Middle East and how they could affect world economies.
   On a regional basis in the second quarter, the company said it
had a 7 percent gain in operating profit to 332 million pounds, or
$544 million, in Europe, its biggest market.
   North American results for the second quarter showed a 13
percent rise in operating profit to 94 million pounds, or $154
million.
   In the rest of the world, Unilever's operating profit rose 41
percent to 127 million pounds, or $298 million.

<HEAD>Beer Company Starts India's First Private Airline</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN POMFRET</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BANGALORE, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When the Indian government ended its
37-year monopoly on airlines in April, visions of belly-dancing
hostesses undulated through Deepak Anand's head.
   Anand, one of India's new breed of capitalists, has yet to
realize his dream of sashaying stewardesses.
   But he has a private airline flying in India for the first time
since the country nationalized eight carriers in 1953.
   UB Air took to the skies on June 1, led by Anand, who is
corporate planner for the UB Group, India's biggest beer brewery
and one of the country's largest companies.
   ``On time, every time,'' is UB Air's slogan. Its nickname is
``Beer Air'' _ in reference to the company's main product _ and
Anand said the airline would soon relaunch canned beer in India by
offering UB's Black Label and Kingfisher brews on board, a first in
India.
   UB Air is targeting business travelers. With fares about 30
percent higher than Indian Airlines, Anand says he is committed to
getting people ``where they want to go in time for their business
meetings.''
   ``I also wanted belly dancers,'' Anand said. ``But I got shot
down.'' Company officials thought dancing on board would be too
disruptive, he said.
   Many seem to be taking UB Air seriously.
   It began by flying the 180 miles from Bangalore, a southern city
of high-tech industries and 4 million people, to Mangalore, a beach
resort on the west coast. Since June, it has added a route from
Bangalore to the eastern city of Madras. A round trip to Hyderabad,
in central India, and the capital, New Delhi, are also planned.
   As of late July, the company had flown about 60 flights. All of
them have been on time, a highly unusual occurrence in India, the
land of the endless wait.
   When 18,000 Indian Airlines' employees went on strike July 12,
UB Air responded with two special flights to Madras.
   ``It was fun to stick it to them,'' Anand said. ``It was our
small way of saying, `Wake up, India.'''
   The young airline operates with a single plane, a 15-seater
Donnier 228-100, which flies six round trips a week between
Bangalore, Madras and Mangalore.
   Next month, UB Air pans to purchase a 19-seater Donnier 228-201
from Druk Air, Bhutan's state-run airline. It is also trying to
lease a 77-seater BAE-146 jet from Druk.
   The appearance of a private airline in India's skies highlights
attempts made by recent governments to liberalize this vast
nation's rigid economy.
   Since independence from Britain in 1947, India has sheltered
itself from the world economic system, erecting huge tariffs on
items from bicycles to automobiles to soft drinks. Most major
industries, such as power, steel, transportation and communication,
were state run.
   When Rajiv Gandhi became prime minister in 1984, he moved to
increase India's competition with the outside world, lowering some
tariffs and pushing trade.
   Gandhi's loss in the 1989 election to V.P. Singh didn't stop
this process. In May, the government announced a new industrial
policy, approving foreign investment as long as the foreign partner
holds less than 40 percent equity.
   The government also opened up India's state-run power industry
to private investors. And the Ministry of Defense published a list
of items which could be produced domestically by private industry.
   In April, the government announced its ``open skies'' policy,
permitting private airlines to fly.
   Many thought the announcement was overdue. In India's air
industry, the gap between supply and demand has been acute.
   Of India's three state-owned airlines, Air India, Indian
Airlines and Vayudoot, only Air India is considered passable and
its flights are mainly overseas. One airline analyst in Hong Kong
called Indian Airlines ``the worst way to travel east of Iran.''
Vayudoot lost an estimated $25 million last year.
   Even with liberalization, the government is not allowing fair
competition in the skies. Private airlines are prohibited from
advertising schedules and are banned from using India's foreign
exchange to buy airplanes.
   As such, India's fledgling airlines will have to rely on wary
foreign banks or rich non-resident Indians, interested in investing
in their homeland, for funds to buy planes. UB Air is currently
negotiating with West Germany's Deutschebank for a loan, said
Devapriya Guha, a senior manager in corporate planning.
   Still, Anand and other entrepreneurs remain undaunted.
   ``Competition is a process that India cannot avoid,'' he said.
``It's the only way to improve service and enter the modern world.''

   Teamsters union officials count United
Parcel Service of America Inc. workers' ballots on a proposed new
contract today in a vote that could start a nationwide strike
against the giant package shipper.
   Company officials were optimistic that a strike would be
averted, even if the proposed contract is rejected.
   ``The sentiment we're hearing right now is an actual work
stoppage is one of the last options being considered,'' UPS
spokesman John Flick said Thursday. ``Both of us will go to great
lengths to avoid a work stoppage.''
   UPS officials said the results of the voting could be announced
Satrday, but a man who answered the telephone at Teamsters'
headquarters in Washington said no announcment would be made until
Monday. Teamsters spokesman Duke Zeller in Washington did not
return calls.
   Members had until 10 a.m. EDT today to send their ballots to
union headquarters in Washington.
   UPS, the world's No. 1 package handler, has about 150,000
part-time and full-time Teamsters members out of a total work force
of 230,000. It delivers more than 10 million packages a day, and
made 2.8 billion deliveries in 1989 for $12.4 billion in revenue.
   Teamsters President William McCarthy, who helped negotiate the
proposed new three-year contract, told UPS officials early in the
negotiations that the union would call for a work stoppage if the
pact wasn't ratified, said Ken Sternad, another spokesman for UPS.
   ``But that was one verbal comment made at one moment in time,
and we've heard very little, if any, of that talk since then,''
Sternad said.
   The old contract expired July 31, and the company has agreed to
make the new one, if ratified, retroactive to Aug. 1, Sternad said.
   Rival shippers and UPS customers have been scrambling to make
alternate plans if a strike is called, and some customers said they
have already stopped using UPS to avoid getting packages caught in
the system during a walkout.
   Spiegel Inc. of Oak Brook, Ill., the nation's largest in-home
catalog company, has been making contingency plans since the
beginning of July, said spokeswoman Mary Dale Walters.
   The Postal Service said last month that it could not absorb
UPS's business, and the company's other main ground competitor,
Roadway Package System, Inc., echoed that sentiment Thursday.
   ``Nobody has that kind of capacity,'' said Bram Johnson,
spokesman for Pittsburgh-based RPS.
   Other options to UPS include Federal Express, DHL Worldwide
Express and TNT Skypak.
   If a strike is called, packages would be cleared out of the UPS
system by any means possible, Sternad said, adding that volume had
decreased slightly by last week.
   ``We will do everything up to and including getting everybody up
to the chairman of the board to get our customers' packages either
returned to them or forwarded to where they are going,'' he said.
   The proposed contract calls for higher wages, benefits and
better working conditions, Sternad said. It would raise the wages
for the average UPS full-time driver a minimum of $1.50 an hour by
August 1, 1992 from $16.10.
   The contract also calls for a cost-of-living allowance of up to
20 cents per hour each year, depending on the rate of inflation,
Sternad said. Inflation would have to be 10 percent for the drivers
to get the full 20 cents, he said.
   Part-time workers, who start at $8 or $9 an hour, would receive
$1.50 more, Sternad said.
   Company contributions for health benefits and employees'
pensions, currently at $8,300 a year for full-time workers, would
increase to $10,500 by the end of three years, Sternad said.
   The proposal also offers a one-time bonus, to be paid within the
first month of ratification, of $1,000 to full-timers and $500 to
part-timers, he said.
   Sternad said there has never been a national strike against UPS,
which has had a national Teamsters contract since 1979, but
sporadic work stoppages and strikes have occurred regionally.
   The mostv recent and biggest was in 1976, when 18,000 workers in
15 Northeast states walked out for 13 weeks.

   Share prices finished lower on London's Stock
Exchange Friday in subdued dealings as events in the Middle East
overshadowed any genuine interest in the market.
   Investors were merely flattening out positions ahead of the
weekend in case circumstances over the next two days become more
volatile, dealers said.
   Most players were unwilling to open new positions at the moment,
dealers said.
   In addition, a poor start on Wall Street made investors
cautious, dealers said. At the close of the London session, the Dow
Jones industrial average was off 27.23 points at 2,731.19.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index fell 11.1
points, or 0.5 percent, to close at 2,233.8, also the session low.
The peak was 2,249.2.
   The Financial Times 30-share index was down 9.8 points at
1,743.0 at the close. The Financial Times 500-share index fell 5.56
points to close at 1,208.30.
   Volume was 312.4 million shares, compared with 429.2 million
shares Thursday.

   Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner is
calling in airline executives to discuss the impact of sharp rises
in jet fuel prices that led nearly every major carrier to announce
fare increases.
   Some increases went into effect today, but passengers on most
airlines have until next Wednesday to book flights in advance at
current fares.
   Skinner wrote several airline presidents on Thursday, asking
them to make appointments with him next Wednesday, Thursday or
Friday to discuss how higher jet fuel prices following the Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait are affecting airline finances and the public.
   Delta, United and USAir all announced 5.3 percent fare increases
Thursday that are to take effect in five days. Several other
airlines announced increases earlier.
   Northwest dropped a planned $8-per-flight fuel surcharge and
announced a 10 percent fare increase instead _ which it amended to
5.3 percent late today. American on Thursday scaled back its
increase from 10 percent to 5.3 percent.
   Other airlines that have announced increases include America
West, Midway, Pan Am, Southwest, Trans World and the Trump Shuttle.
   Prices of jet fuel shot up from a level of 70 to 75 cents a
gallon before the invasion to 80 to 90 cents this week, airline
officials said.
   The government has no power to regulate fuel prices or airline
fares, but Skinner earlier asked all transportation companies to
show restraint in raising rates in response to increasing fuel
costs.
   ``I am concerned about the effect of the rise in fuel costs,
both on the financial position of the industry and on the traveling
public,'' Skinner said in a two-paragraph letter to several airline
presidents. He asked the officials to brief him on the situation.
   ``Airline ticket prices are going up, and we want our passengers
to know why. Jet fuel prices have gone through the roof,'' Robert
J. Aaronson, president of the industry's Air Transport Association,
said at a news conference Thursday.
   Aaronson said he expects all airlines to honor advance tickets
sold before the price increases take effect. Calls to several
carriers indicated that tickets bought before the increases would
be at lower prices, even for flights several months away.
   Many carriers already had sold 30 percent to 40 percent of their
seats over the next two months before the announcements, Aaronson
said.
   The fare hikes come at a time when domestic air travel has shown
little increase over last year and some airlines have reported
first- and second-quarter declines in profits. It also comes toward
the end of the summer vacation season, after which travel volume is
expected to drop.
   ``While the industry struggles to hold down costs and to keep
people flying at reasonable prices, we are faced with these new,
enormous fuel bills,'' Aaronson said.
   A $1 increase in the price of a barrel of crude oil results in a
3 cent increase in the cost of a gallon of jet fuel, which in turn
costs airlines $500 million a year, the industry spokesman said.
   With crude oil up from $22 a barrel last week to $26 a barrel on
Wednesday, the increased costs would total $2 billion.
   But Aaronson noted that crude oil prices were declining Thursday
and he said if jet fuel costs follow, the industry is likely to
lower fares.
   He said a Bush administration proposal to increase domestic
ticket taxes and a House-passed bill to impose passenger charges at
airports would add to the cost of air travel.
   Although the airline industry has not taken a unified stand on
the taxes, Aaronson said, ``To put it mildly, if ever there was a
wrong time to raise taxes on airline passengers, it is now.''

hostilities in the Middle East would escalate.
   The downward momentum escalated as traders digested a statement

Iraq's intentions are wider than the annexation of Kuwait.
   ``It was quite inflamatory, and it added fuel to the fire'' in
an already pressured stock market, one analyst said.

   Saddam's speech, broadcast on national Iraqi television and read

find its equilibrium.
   In reference to the U.S.-led multinational military presence in
nearby Saudi Arabia, Saddam called on all Arabs to ``condemn the
invaders and collaborators'' and to seize Islam's holiest shrines,
which lie within Saudi borders.
   Analysts had expected the market to turn lower today as traders

<HEAD>State Sues Exxon, Alleges Deceptive Practices</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   North Carolina's attorney general filed a
lawsuit Friday against Exxon Corp., charging the oil company with
deceptive trade practices since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait last
week.
   Attorney General Lacy Thornburg charged that Exxon is quoting
wholesale prices which it fails to honor, and is imposing
retroactive wholesale price increases. Superior Court Judge Robert
Farmer signed an injunction to halt the practice.
   A spokesman for Exxon said officials were unaware of the lawsuit
and had no immediate comment.
   North Carolina's action follows the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait,
which set off a spiral of higher gasoline prices across the United
States.
   The lawsuit is based on an investigation by the attorney
general's office which uncovered documents showing that Exxon had
raised its wholesale prices by as much as 6 cents a gallon after
having already contracted and sold the gas at the lower price.
   Thornburg said records indicate that in some cases, distributors
had picked up loads and already made deliveries to service stations
before being informed of the price hikes.
   Documents show that some oil and gas distributors have suffered
significant losses by relying on Exxon's alleged misrepresentation
of price, Thornburg said.
   According to the lawsuit, because the Exxon distributors don't
know whether Exxon will impose retroactive price increases on gas
which they have already purchased, the distributors must build a
cushion into their resale prices.
   ``Ultimately, the public pays the price,'' Thornburg said.
``When Exxon or any other company unfairly raises its prices to the
distributors, it sets off a chain reaction of price increases which
hit the consumer in the pocketbook.''

<HEAD>Kellogg Takes Nabisco to Court Over Shredded Wheat Claims</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KALAMAZOO, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Kellogg Co. is taking Nabisco Brands
to court over shredded wheat, contending Nabisco is trying to crush
Kellogg's plans to introduce a more nutritious cereal.
   Kellogg has been planning since June to put its Whole Grain
Shredded Wheat on the market this month with the claim it's ``very
simply, the most nutritious shredded wheat you can buy.''
   The company contends the shredded wheat has 33 percent more
dietary fiber and more thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, iron, vitamins
B6 and B12, folic acid, magnesium and zinc _ with no sugar or salt
_ than the famous shredded wheat manufactured for 89 years by New
Jersey-based Nabisco Brands, a division of RJR-Nabisco.
   But on July 27, attorneys for Nabisco told Kellogg that it, too,
had developed a more nutritious shredded wheat _ with nearly
identical nutritional value as the new Kellogg product _ that would
be on the market in mid-August.
   Nabisco sent a letter to Kellogg, saying the Battle Creek
company must ``take immediate steps to avoid any false claims of
nutritional superiority for its fortified shredded wheat cereal on
packaging, advertising, point of sale and any other materials
whatsoever.''
   Instead, Kellogg filed suit Aug. 3 in U.S. District Court in
Kalamazoo.
   The company contends Nabisco had known since early June that
Kellogg was preparing to spring the new shredded wheat onto the
market, but said nothing. Kellogg had been sending samples and
promotional materials since that time to various test markets.
   ``That Nabisco should wait for 89 years and a competitive
challenge from Kellogg before manufacturing its own unsugared,
fortified shredded wheat biscuit was itself suspicious,'' the suit
says. ``But ... Kellogg has learned other facts which clearly
indicate that Nabisco set out to copy both the features of and
marketing strategy behind Kellogg's new cereal in a cynical attempt
to prevent vigorous competition in a sector of the market for
ready-to-eat cereals that it has dominated for so long.''
   Nabisco spokesman Mark Gutsche said Friday the company denies
the charge and called the lawsuit ``a reaction to Nabisco's own
threat of legal action.''
   He said the company's new cereal, Spoon Size Plus Shredded
Wheat, a fortified version of its regular product, already has been
sent to grocers.
   ``Nabisco is absolutely confident that Kellogg will be stopped
from confusing consumers that its new cereal is the most nutritious
shredded wheat,'' he said, reading from a prepared statement.
   Kellogg spokesman Neil Nyberg said the company is asking the
court to rule that its product claims are legal and that Nabisco
may not sue Kellogg over those claims.

<HEAD>Two Chrysler Proposals Shot Down by UAW</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TRAVERSE CITY, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United Auto Workers union has
rejected proposals that would give workers a stake in the
financially struggling Chrysler Corp. and would establish a new way
to figure profit sharing, a UAW official said Friday.
   UAW Vice President Stan Marshall said a third company proposal,
which would establish a multi-employer health-care trust, is still
under consideration.
   The three concepts were introduced by Chrysler Vice President
Anthony St. John on July 20, the day national contract negotiations
began between the UAW and General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and
Chrysler. Current contracts covering more than 450,000 workers _
60,000 of them at Chrysler _ expire Sept. 14.
   Marshall said Friday that the union had rejected the employee
ownership plan and the so-called ``gain-sharing'' proposal.
   ``It's pretty close to being laid to rest from the union's
position,'' he said. ``We're rejecting unless the membership said
differently.''
   Marshall said he expected union members to agree with the
bargainers' position.
   However, UAW negotiators are likely to hear about the two
proposals later.
   ``I'm sure all those discussions will come up again at the
bargaining table,'' Chrysler spokesman Tom Houston said.
   St. John offered few details about the proposals for the
employee ownership program or the ``gain-sharing'' scheme.
   Currently, Chrysler workers nationwide receive annual
profit-sharing payments if the company's North American earnings
are high enough.
   St. John said the gain-sharing program would alter that by
including other factors, such as employee attendance and
productivity. It also would be operated on a plant-by-plant basis
rather than nationwide.
   He said the two programs, along with the multi-employer
health-care trust, would save Chrysler money, although GM and Ford
officials have been cool to the ideas.
   ``You don't hear about buying in (to the corporation) or
gain-sharing until they (the companies) are in trouble,'' Marshall
said. ``They are willing to include workers in their misery.''
   Chrysler said it made $180 million during the second quarter,
down 47.2 percent from last year. Wall Street analysts have
forecast that the company will lose a substantial amount of money
in the third quarter because of a minivan production interruption.
   Marshall, speaking at a management conference sponsored by the
University of Michigan, criticized St. John harshly for talking
about the three proposals to reporters before discussing them with
the union. He said negotiations got off to a rocky start partly
because of that.
   Since then, Marshall said, the atmosphere at the talks has
improved but distrust remains between the union and management.
   In a speech to the conference, Marshall endorsed an expansion of
joint labor-management programs and said the union would consider a
three-crew, two-shift manufacturing schedule.
   The union's leadership once before backed such a plan at
Chrysler's car assembly plant in St. Louis. The UAW overwhelmingly
rejected the proposed change.
   Shortly after, Chrysler announced it would close the plant in
late September.

<HEAD>Soybean Futures Gain, Wheat Retreats in Late Plunge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices rose sharply Friday on the
Chicago Board of Trade after the government issued a lower than
expected harvest estimate.
   Corn futures were mixed and wheat ended lower after a dizzying
late-session plunge sparked by a huge sell order that was believed
to have come from one speculative fund.
   ``They hit it hard. It was a big mess in there,'' said John
Frazier, director of agricultural trading for Gerald Inc. in
Chicago.
   Soybeans finished below the day's highs after a powerful rally
linked to Thursday's Agriculture Department crop report.
   The government projected a soybean harvest of 1.84 billion
bushels, about 20 million less than expected.
   The USDA's estimate for the corn harvest _ 7.85 billion bushels
_ was about 70 million lower than expected.
   Wheat futures settled 10\ cents lower to { cent higher with the
contract for delivery in September at $2.80 a bushel; corn was
unchanged to 1{ cents lower with September at $2.50{ a bushel; oats
were { cent lower to 1\ cents higher with September at $1.19{ a

   At the request of federal mediators, the
Teamsters union agreed Friday to postpone a strike and resume
negotiations with United Parcel Service of America Inc. if union
members reject a proposed contract.
   ``There will not be a work stoppage, at least not for the
foreseeable future,'' said Alan Caminiti, a UPS spokesman at
company headquarters in Greenwich.
   The Federal Medliation Service asked that the
company and the union go back to the bargaining table if the
Teamsters rejected the new pact, said Bernard E. DeLury, mediation
service director.
   The votiation and Concies were being counted Friday, and Caminiti said
no word
was expected on the results until Monday.
   ``Now, people will be at work Monday, regardless,'' Caminiti
said.
   If the contract is ratified, UPS and the Teamsters have agreed
to make it retroactive to Aug. 1. The old contract expired July 31,
but the Teamsters asked for an extension to collect all the ballots.
   Caminiti said UPS expects that work will proceed at a normal
pace Monday and throughout further contract talks.
   ``We haven't seen any dogging,'' he said. ``They're going to
work, they're doing what they have to do, working as professionals,
and we would expect nothing less of them.''
   A man who answered the telephone at Teamsters headquartloyees'
pensions would increase from $8,300 a year for full-time workers to
$10,500 by the end of three years, Sternad said.
   The proposal also offers a one-time bonus, to be paid within the
first month of ratification, of $1,000 to full-timers and $500 to
part-timers, he said.
   There has never been a national strike against UPS, which has
had a national Teamsters contract since 1979, but sporadic work
stoppages and strikes have occurred regionally.
   The last and biggest was in 1976, when 18,000 workers in 15
Northeast states walked out for 13 weeks.

   H.J. Heinz Co. has signed chief executive
Anthony J.F. O'Reilly to a five-year contract that includes options
to buy 4 million shares of stock, officials said Friday.
   ``We see it as a way to put a handcuff on Tony O'Reilly and keep
him at Heinz,'' said James McDonald, a board member who heads the
compensation committee for the Pittsburgh-based food giant.
   Under the agreement, O'Reilly cannot exercise the option to buy
the stock until 1995. O'Reilly only would earn a profit on the
stock if the price exceeds the option's exercise price of $29.87.
   ``This does not pay off unless the stock does,'' McDonald said.
``Unless the company continues to perform, it can't be a good deal
for him.''
   Heinz stock closed Friday at $33.
   The board struck the agreement to keep the 54-year old chairman
and chief executive at the company, which has grown steadily under
his 11-year tenure into a $6 billion company.
   McDonald said O'Reilly has become increasingly attractive to
other companies because of his record. O'Reilly introduced Weight
Watchers and other lines and began an aggressive marketing campaign
in the United States and abroad.
   ``If you look at his performance, it has been outstanding,''
McDonald said.
   Other terms of the contract, which must be approved by
shareholders at next month's annual meeting, remain the same as
last year, when O'Reilly earned $534,688 in salary and other
compensation and about $1.4 million in bonuses.

<HEAD>Southmark Emerges from Chapter 11 Bankruptcy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Southmark Corp. emerged from bankruptcy Friday,
transferring $75 million to senior creditors and shareholders under
its reorganization plan.
   Southmark chairman, president and chief executive officer Arthur
G. Weiss resigned Friday, as did the board of directors. Two
directors agreed to remain in office for a brief transition period.
   Glen Adams was named chairman, president and chief executive
officer of the Dallas-based real estate and financial services
company, Southmark announced.
   Adams, who previously managed the liquidation of the Great
Western Sugar Co., will be joined by a new board of directors
elected by the new shareholders of the reorganized company.
   Southmark filed for protection from creditors in July 1989. The
Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing, made in Atlanta and transferred to
Dallas, listed total book value assets of $1.046 billion, secured
debt of $152.4 million, unsecured debt of $1.051 billion and other
liabilities of $190.9 million.
   To comply with the reorganization plan approved by the
bankruptcy court in Dallas last April, the company transferred $76
million in cash along with new securities to various agents on
behalf of Southmark's creditors and shareholders.
   Holders of old Southmark securities will receive their portion
of cash, new notes, new preferred stock and new common stock upon
surrender of their old certificates.
   Southmark also transferred $100 million in assets to its
Houston-based thrift subsidiary, San Jacinto Savings Association. A
key feature of the reorganization was the recapitalization of San
Jacinto.
   Southmark will have no managerial control of San Jacinto.
   The rest of Southmark's assets will be liquidated, with proceeds
being used to redeem the new notes and new preferred stock of the
reorganized company.
   The new preferred stock and common stock will begin trading over
the counter on Aug. 13.
   In order to ensure Southmark has adequate working capital, the
company wants to defer paying an estimated $8 million in fees to
professionals that represented the company, creditors' committee,
equity holders' committee and the court-appointed examiner. The
fees would bear 10 percent annual interest from Nov. 1, 1990 and
would be payable no later than April 15, 1991.

   Polaroid Corp. flashed some light into
Masasachusetts' dark economic picture Thursday by announcing a $90
million plant to produce film for its new electronic imaging
products.
   The plant in New Bedford will employ more than 100 people and is
expected to be built by late 1992. Polaroid officials said it would
be the company's largest investment in a manufacturing plant, and
its products should help lift the company's weak profits.

``Polaroid's confidence in the commonwealth of Massachusetts as a
great place to do business.''
   Recent events have shaken the business climate in that state. A
once-booming economy has tumbled, increasing unemployment. State
government wrestled for months with a fiscal crisis before raising
taxes and cutting programs.
   The expansion may be a needed shot for Polaroid. Its instant
film business has been lackluster, and the company must find new
products to stimulate sales, said Alex Henderson, an analyst at
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Polaroid last month reported drops in second quarter operating
income, net earnings and worldwide sales.
   Booth said electronic imaging products are ``a key element in
our growth strategy.'' That includes making devices that can be
used in hospitals to give doctors instant images when they examine
patients.
   The company is set to test the products later this year and
begin selling them in 1991.
   Polaroid looked at sites around the world after choosing New
Bedford, where the company operates another plant that employs 500.
   Booth acknowledged Polaroid did not look favorably on the
instability in Massachusetts. ``But it wasn't enough of a factor to
send us outside the state,'' he said.
   Gov. Michael Dukakis and business leaders hailed Polaroid's
announcement as a positive signal to other companies. John Gould,
president of Associated Industries of Massachusetts, called it a
``lightning rod'' that could help the state attract other
investments.

<HEAD>Shareholders Approve Shearson's Merger With American Express</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shareholders of Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings
Inc. on Thursday approved the Wall Street firm's merger with its
parent, American Express Co.
   Shearson said the merger will take effect at 12:01 a.m. Friday.
   At a shareholders meeting, 91.59 percent of the votes cast were
in favor of the merger, said Shearson spokesman Steven Faigen.
Since American Express owns almost all the shares, the vote was a
formality.
   Shearson is the parent company of the retail brokerage Shearson
Lehman Brothers and the investment bank Lehman Brothers. The
divisions recently were created by American Express out of what
formerly was known only as Shearson Lehman Hutton.
   Earlier this year, American Express took greater control of
Shearson after it experienced internal turmoil and weak financial
performance. The financial services company increased its ownership
of Shearson, ousted its chairman, Peter A. Cohen, and injected more
than $1 billion in fresh capital. The merger is the final step in
that process.
   Shearson lost an industry record $915 million in the first
quarter, in part because of expenses to pay for a restructuring
that includes about 2,000 layoffs. Most Wall Street firms have been
forced to cut back because of an industry slowdown since the 1987
stock market crash.
   A large part of Shearson's problems were due to overexpansion in
the 1980s, when the firm acquired the brokerage E.F. Hutton &amp; Co.
and the investment bank Lehman Brothers Inc.
   At the shareholders meeting, Shearson's chairman and chief
executive officer, Howard L. Clarke, said the company does not
expect to take any additional restructuring charges, Faigen said.
   In addition, Shearson said it does not expect it will require
any additional cash infusions by American Express, the spokesman
said.

   Two federal judges in Cleveland and Texas on
Friday consolidated thousands of asbestos liability lawsuits in a
first step toward resolving claims against manufacturers for worker
deaths and illnesses.
   The joint class-action ruling was issued by federal district
judges Robert M. Parker of Beaumont, Texas, and Thomas D. Lambros
of Cleveland following a meeting of judges to consider ways of
clearing a burgeoning asbestos case backlog.
   More than 100,000 lawsuits are filed in state and federal courts
nationwide against companies that produced asbestos, a mineral used
widely for insulation that causes cancer and other respiratory
illnesses.
   ``The need for a multi-court cooperative effort to dispose of
these cases is compelling,'' Parker and Lambros said in their order.
   ``The transaction costs are unacceptable. Thousands of claimants
die before they can get their cases resolved. Trials have become
repetitive, with the same issues and the same products being
litigated time after time,'' they said.
   The judges consolidated all pending asbestos liability cases in
their jurisdictions into one case. It is the first such grouping
made by judges handling the asbestos docket.
   Parker, Lambros and eight other federal judges held an
extraordinary meeting Friday in Washington. They heard proposals by
plaintiffs and defense lawyers for taking steps to clear the
asbestos docket. The order was approved by all the judges, although
it was issued by Parker and Lambros, who have the most cases.
   ``I'm not sure it will result in a national class being
established but it's a step in the direction of having a forum
created so that an equitable solution to the problem can be arrived
at,'' said Louis Robles, a Miami plaintiffs lawyer handling 1,000
asbestos claims.
   Parker and Lambros also scheduled a Sept. 14 hearing in
Cleveland to discuss certifying a national class action in Texas
consolidating all pending asbestos lawsuits nationwide. That
hearing also would examine which companies have too little money on
hand to pay claims against them.
   The judges' order does not stay on any pending asbestos
litigation. Parker and Lambros said they want to establish
procedures to determine defendant companies' national or regional
share of asbestos to apportion their liability.
   Many of the claims involve exposure dating to the 1930s and
'40s, much of it during World War II at government shipyards. The
government to date has avoided liability for asbestos diseases, but
is being challenged in several courts.
   Separately, a court-appointed adviser is New York is developing
a plan to restructure the Manville trust. The trust, which was
created after Manville Corp. was driven into bankruptcy court by
thousands of asbestos claims, is out of money to pay new claims.
Further spending by the trust has been frozen until Sept. 6.

<HEAD>Six Months After Benzene Scare, Perrier Still Hard to Find</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL NOWELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Perrier bottled water hasn't reappeared
in large quantities in the city where discovery of benzene
contamination in the famous drink stopped distribution in 120
countries.
   Progress also apparently has been slow in reintroducing the
drink in some other areas as well.
   ``We've got our work cut out for us,'' said Jane Lazgin,
spokeswoman for the Perrier Group of America, the water's U.S.
distributor.
   ``We have to earn their (customers) trust again. That's our job.
We feel our first step was the best one to take. Now it will take
an educational campaign.''
   It's been six months since a local health official discovered
traces of the chemical benzene in Perrier samples, prompting the
worldwide recall. The company began reintroducing the water into
the United States in some areas in April.
   Hellen Berry, who works for Beverage Marketing of New York, an
industry consulting firm, said it will take a long time for Perrier
to restock all of its customers.
   ``They have to restore the entire pipeline,'' she said. ``That
includes a store's shelves as well as the back rooms and
warehouses.''
   Ms. Berry estimated the company's sales for May were about 67
percent of what they were in the same month last year. She also
said the benzene scare could have a long-lasting impact on Perrier
sales.
   ``Before this, most restaurants stocked only one brand of
bottled water,'' she said. ``Now I'm being told their customers
expect them to offer more than one.''
   Patrons at Charlotte restaurants are discovering Perrier's still
difficult to get.
   ``I can't find it and you know how upsetting that can be to the
owner of a French restaurant,'' said Daniel Quillec, owner of Chez
Daniel. ``My customers are asking for it.''
   At Eli's, another popular Charlotte eatery, owner Larry Campbell
has switched to another bottled water, Quibell.
   ``As far as I know it's not available and no one's been asking
for it,'' he said of Perrier.
   One grocery store said it has been selling Perrier for about a
week.
   ``It isn't blowing off the shelves,'' said Janice Keifer,
assistant manager at the Fresh Market. ``It looks like people got
used to (rival products) Quibell and LaCroix.''
   Another store manager said she expects the first shipment of
Perrier next week.
   The company says it resumed distribution in Charlotte on June 15.
   In February, Perrier announced an international recall after
benzene traces were found in some samples by Mecklenburg County
environmental lab director Tom Ward.
   In his small lab, which tests 25,000 water samples a year, Ward
routinely uses Perrier as a diluting agent. When he found benzene
in six bottles, he notified the Food and Drug Administration and
sent it two unopened bottles from the same batch. The FDA found
similar levels of benzene in the samples.
   Perrier _ which eventually traced the contamination to naturally
occurring benzene that inadvertently had not been filtered from the
water _ responded by ordering the dumping of 160 million bottles,
including 72 million in the United States, and halted distribution
to 120 countries. Last month, the company said the recall had cost
it nearly $150 million.
   Before the recall, Perrier was the nation's biggest selling
imported bottled water brand and third overall.
   According to the research firm Beverage Marketing Corp., Perrier
had 5.7 percent of the overall $2.2 billion bottled water market in
the U.S. in 1988. It trailed only Arrowhead at 7.7 percent and
Sparklettes at 5.9 percent.
   Ms. Lazgin said the company wants to regain about 80 percent of
its U.S. markets by next August. The company does not disclose its
sales.
   ``We gave ourselves 18 months to do it so we're doing well after
six months considering we were out of the market so long,'' she
said.

<HEAD>Gold Nears $400 Amid Mid East Anxiety</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Gold futures prices raced to their highest levels in nearly five
months Friday as fiery rhetoric from Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
reignited fears that a Middle East war would wreak economic havoc
on the West.
   On other markets, petroleum futures soared; soybeans rallied
strongly while wheat futures plunged; and livestock and meat
futures were mixed.
   Gold futures settled $11.10 to $12 higher on New York's
Commodity Exchange with the contract for delivery in August at
$396.90 a troy ounce, the highest spot-month settlement since March
19.
   Silver futures settled 11.1 cents to 12.7 cents higher with
August at $4.969 a troy ounce.
   The gold market surged after Saddam, in an outburst of fury
against Western efforts to devastate his economy and hem in his
army, called on Arabs everywhere to wage ``holy war'' against
enemies of Islam.
   Hours after Saddam's statement, a majority of the Arab League
nations agreed to dispatch an Arab force to defend Saudi Arabia and
approved economic sanctions against Iraq.
   The developments triggered a runup in oil futures and a drop of
more than 40 points in the Dow Jones industrial average. Both of
those moves supported the gold market, which tends to attract
investors during times of inflation and economic and political
uncertainty.
   ``Gold is getting helped twice, once by the political
instability in the Middle East and once by the price of crude
oil,'' said Jim Paul, chief commodities analyst with Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc.
   Gold has rebounded with increasing momentum since tumbling below
$345 an ounce in June. And Paul said the chart patterns, on which
many large institutional investors and commodity funds make their
trading decisions, indicate the precious metals are likely to move
higher.
   But he cautioned, ``we're not trading gold and silver _ we're
trading political events in the Middle East and we don't know
what's happening next.''
   In energy trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, West
Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 17 cents lower to 69 cents
higher with September at $26.23 a barrel; heating oil was .90 cent
to 2.84 cents higher with September at 72.61 cents a gallon;
unleaded gasoline was 1.2 cents to 3.03 cents higher with September
at 79.45 cents a gallon.
   Soybean futures ended sharply higher, but below the day's highs,
on the Chicago Board of Trade after the Agriculture Department
issued a lower-than-expected harvest estimate.
   The market dropped from its highs on spillover selling from the
grain pits, where a large wheat sell order sparked a dizzying
plunge late in the session.
   ``They hit it hard. It was a big mess in there,'' said John
Frazier, director of agricultural trading for Gerald Inc., in
Chicago.
   Analysts said the strength in soybeans was mainly a reaction to
Thursday's USDA report.
   The government projected a soybean harvest of 1.84 billion
bushels, about 20 million less than expected.
   The USDA's estimate for the corn harvest _ 7.85 billion bushels
_ was about 70 million lower than expected.
   Wheat futures settled 3 cents to 10\ cents lower with September
at $2.80{ a bushel; corn was 2{ cents lower to \ cent higher with
September at $2.50\ a bushel; oats were unchanged to { cent lower
with September at $1.19{ a bushel; soybeans were 10 cents to 14
cents higher with August at $6.08} a bushel.
   Near-month hog futures rose sharply on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, rebounding from recent losses on ideas that lower
wholesale prices for pork products would encourage retailers to
promote pork.
   Pork-belly futures and most cattle futures retreated in light
trading.
   Live cattle settled .30 cent lower to .20 cent higher with
August at 78.97 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .33 cent to .65
cent lower with August at 89.52 cents a pound; live hogs were .07
cent lower to 1.42 cents higher with August at 57.77 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .30 cent to 1.75 cent lower with August at
47.62 cents a pound.

<HEAD>Gold Climbs, Dollar Mostly Lower in New York</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gold prices climbed Friday in heavy trading
after Iraq's call for an Arab holy war against Western forces in
the Persian Gulf region.
   The dollar, meanwhile, finished lower against most major
currencies despite the possibility of an escalation of Middle East
hostilities that could disrupt oil flows from that region and
damage economies.
   Analysts said weakness in the U.S. economy and the prospect of
lower U.S. interest rates weighed on the dollar. Trading was
described as light.
   Gold for current delivery jumped $11.10 a troy ounce to close at
$396.90 on New York's Commodity Exchange. In later dealings,
Republic National Bank in New York quoted a bid for an ounce of
gold at $396.25 as of 4 p.m. EDT, up $10.65 from Thursday's late
bid.
   David Ryan, chief bullion trader for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.,
said trading volume was heavy and reflected a feeling that
``tensions are getting worse instead of better'' in the wake of
Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   As Arab leaders gathered for a meeting Friday in Cairo, Egypt,
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein called on Arabs everywhere to attack
Western forces in region, overthrow the Saudi royal family and take
back the Moslem holy sites in Saudi Arabia.
   But a majority of the Arab League nations attending the Cairo
meeting later agreed to send troops to protect Saudi Arabia from
Iraq, approved economic sanctions against Baghdad and condemned the
Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
   Ryan said Saddam's call for a holy war against Western forces
``really played on traders' nerves today.''
   He said gold was bid higher higher because of its perceived
safety in times of distress and as a hedge against inflation likely
to result from the recent sharp increase in oil prices since Iraq's
move against its neighbor Kuwait.
   Earlier in the day, gold prices rose by smaller amounts in Asia
and Europe in what analysts there attributed to short-covering by
professionals who bought gold to fulfill earlier agreements to sell
it.
   Gold rose to $391.25 a troy ounce in London from $385.25 late
Thursday and to $390.50 an ounce in Zurich from $385.00 late
Thursday. In Hong Kong, gold rose $3.84 an ounce to $388.01.
   Silver bullion rose in London to $4.95 a troy ounce from $4.87
Thursday. On New York's Comex, silver for current delivery rose
11.2 cents an ounce to $4.969.
   In the currency markets, the dollar fell in New York trading
against every major currency except the Japanese yen and the
Canadian dollar after turning in a mixed performance on foreign
exchange markets overseas.
   ``We saw dollar weakness at the close of the European session,
and it carried over to New York,'' said Marc Chandler, a currency
markets analyst at MMS International in Chicago.
   Chandler said the dollar is suffering because of the weakness in
the U.S. economy, the likelihood of rising inflation and chances
that U.S. interest rates will fall while rates in Germany may rise.
   He said the dollar would probably be even lower were it not for
the Persian Gulf situation. Some investors turn to the dollar
during international strife on the theory that it offers more
security than other currencies.
   ``The danger for the dollar now is for a protracted and costly
U.S. involvement in the Persian Gulf,'' Chandler said.
   The dollar rose to 150.40 yen in New York from 149.805 yen late
Thursday. In Tokyo, the dollar edged up 0.07 yen to 149.75 yen. The
dollar was quoted at 150.20 yen in London.
   But the dollar fell against the British pound. In New York, the
pouind rose to $1.8735 from $1.8680 late Thursday. In London, the
pound rose to $1.8730 from $1.8720 late Thursday.
   Dollar rates in New York, compared with late rates Thursday,
included: 1.5895 German marks, down from 1.5965; 1.3375 Swiss
francs, down from 1.3435; 1,165.00 Italian lire, down from
1,168.50; 5.3325 French francs, down from 5.3510; and 1.14705
Canadian dollars, up from 1.14695.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late rates
Thursday, included: 1.5895 German marks, down from 1.5915; 1.3400
Swiss francs, up from 1.3385; 5.3360 French francs, up from 5.3340;
1.7925 Dutch guilders, down from 1.7930; 1,166.50 Italian lire, up
from 1,164.75, and 1.1476 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1467.

<HEAD>NII Chairman Steps Down, Group Wins Board Seats</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of National Intergroup Inc.
stepped down from the holding company's board of directors Thursday
as a dissident group claimed three seats on the panel.
   Candidate slates for the seats had been nominated by NII and the
dissident group, Centaur Partners of New York, the company's
largest stockholder with 16.5 percent of outstanding shares.
   Centaur's nominees won about 63 percent of the votes cast at the
company's July 25 annual meeting, National Intergroup said as the
meeting resumed Thursday.
   Howard M. Love's seat was one of those at stake on the 10-member
board. Although he resigned as chairman, he remains the company's
chief executive officer and has said he would like to finish the
company's restructuring if the board permits him to stay.
   Also approved were Centaur proposals to prevent NII from
increasing its anti-takeover defenses, to require confidential
voting in company elections and to require stockholder approval for
severance payments to managers.
   The company's proposal to change the name of the corporation to
FoxMeyer Corp. received more than half the shares voted but failed
to achieve the two-third majority needed to ratify the proposal.
   ``While we are disappointed with the vote outcome, we plan to
continue to implement the final steps of our restructuring
program,'' NII said in a statement. ``We remain convinced that the
continued growth and development of FoxMeyer Drug Company is in the
best interests of all of our shareholders.''
   Centaur wants the company to sell all its assets and distribute
the proceeds to stockholders.
   NII has agreed to place most of its businesses up for sale and
close its Pittsburgh headquarters but has insisted on keeping
FoxMeyer, the nation's third-largest wholesale drug distribution
network, as the foundation for a continuing company.
   Before beginning its restructuring, NII was a conglomerate that
owned National Aluminum, a major aluminum producer; the Ben
Franklin variety store chain; Permian, an independent energy
wholesaler; and 50 percent of National Steel Corp.
   Ben Franklin is on the block, Permian will go on the block once
NII completes its tender offer for shares held by the public, and
the other operations have been sold.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush signed legislation Friday that
extends his authority to begin pumping oil from the nation's
Strategic Petroleum Reserve into the market should Iraq's invasion
of Kuwait disrupt world oil supplies.
   The bill, passed by Congress shortly before lawmakers left for
vacation last week, temporarily extends the Energy Policy
Conservation Act, which established the 580-million-barrel
stockpile of unrefined crude oil in response to the 1973-74 Arab
oil embargo.
   Without the extension, Bush's authority to pump crude oil from
the stockpile to relieve shortages would expire Aug. 15, while
Congress is out of town.
   The stockpile, stored in salt caverns along the Louisiana-Texas
coast, has been accumulated at a cost of more than $20 billion over
the last decade.
   The system could now replace 80 days of oil imports, according
to the Senate Energy Committee. That cushion has fallen from 110
days in the middle 1980s because of growing U.S. dependence on
foreign crude.
   Congress and the administration have been battling the last 18
months over whether to increase the reserve to 1 billion barrels.
Bush has opposed increasing the reserve beyond 750 million barrels.

<HEAD>Analysts Believe Continental Can Still Fly Without Lorenzo</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURA TOLLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Now that Frank Lorenzo is leaving Continental
Airlines, the question remains whether the carrier can rise above
the problems it accumulated on its way to the top.
   Lorenzo's departure may have stemmed the flow of harsh criticism
from organized labor, but the carrier still faces other obstacles.
   Heavy debts and a bitter strike at sister carrier Eastern
Airlines have hurt business, and Continental still suffers from an
image problem. But despite those hurdles, several analysts said
Friday there is room for optimism.
   ``It is a fairly low-cost provider. With a different kind of
management, it could be a very powerful airline,'' said industry
analyst Andrew Geller of PNC Financial Corp. in Philadelphia.
   ``I think it definitely has a better future now, or a heightened
chance of a better future with this happening,'' Geller said.
``Whether I think it's a survivor, I don't know yet.''
   Continental Airlines Holdings Inc., formerly known as Texas Air
Corp., announced Thursday that Lorenzo was selling most of his
stake in the company to Scandinavian Airlines System and resigning
as chairman and chief executive.
   Lorenzo will be replaced by Delta Air Lines Inc. President
Hollis L. Harris.
   The Houston-based company once commanded 20 percent of the
domestic airline market through its ownership of Continental and
its sister carrier, Miami-based Eastern.
   Robert J. Joedicke, of Lehman Brothers in New York, said the
carrier has several advantages and disadvantages as it moves into
the post-Lorenzo era.
   ``Its labor costs are lower than the industry average. Whoever
takes it over is blessed with a low-cost airline,'' he said. ``They
can be quite competitive among the major carriers.''
   The company's debt, however, ``sort of counterbalances that,''
Joedicke said. Its success, he said, depends on whether management
can realign the structure of its debt, which totaled some $4.8
billion as of March 31.
   Joedicke also said he believes Harris will make strides in
improving service, which should help attract additional business
travelers.
   ``They kind of had a reputation of bad service that they were
slowly getting rid of, this may hasten that,'' said Thomas Canning
of Standard &amp; Poor's in New York.
   Canning said Harris is well respected in the airline industry
and should be instrumental in polishing Continental's tarnished
image.
   But Continental also faces problems common throughout the
airline industry, including high fuel costs, sagging traffic growth
and increased competition, he said.
   Continental, he said, needs to attract a loyal following and
obtain a larger share of the flying public. He said that except for
Lorenzo's surprise departure, he doubted there would be any major
changes immediately.

<HEAD>GM Announces 1.9 Percent Average Price Increase</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOSE MARTINEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Consumers will pay an average 2.3 percent more
for General Motors Corp. cars and trucks in the 1991 model year, as
GM on Friday joined the other two Big Three automakers in
announcing price increases.
   Chrysler Corp. said last week that its 1991 cars, Jeeps and
minivans would cost 0.9 percent more than this year's models, while
Ford Motor Co. said a week earlier that its 1991 cars would cost an
average 3.2 percent more than this year's. Ford's trucks will cost
3.6 percent more.
   While GM's price increase isn't expected to keep pace with
inflation, the company doubts its profits will suffer.
   ``There are a couple of dynamics to determine profit other than
hiking prices,'' said Terrence P. Sullivan, manager for sales and
financial reporting.
   ``If you have a modest price increase, you can increase profit
by increasing sales and cutting costs,'' he said.
   Sullivan said GM would likely release prices for various models
early next week. He said 1.9 percent of the increase is to cover
health care and production costs and 0.4 percent is for installing
airbags on several models.
   The price comparisons are for comparably equipped vehicles, but
year-to-year comparisons are difficult because automakers pad
prices to allow for incentives.
   During the past several years, each of the Big Three has offered
a variety of incentives, mostly cash rebates and low-interest
financing, to help sell its vehicles.
   Sullivan said the cost of incentives at GM were about the same
as at Ford and Chrysler _ about $1,000 per vehicle.
   The cost of incentives come directly out of profits. During the
last three weeks, the Big Three have all blamed incentives for
cutting their second-quarter earnings.
   Overall, Big Three profits tumbled 43.3 percent in the
April-June quarter this year compared with the same 1989 period.
Chrysler's earnings dropped to $180 million, 47.2 percent less than
earnings for the 1989 second quarter.
   Ford said it made $770.7 million in the second quarter, down 45
percent from the year-earlier period, while GM reported
second-quarter earnings fell 40 percent to $900.1 million.
   Nonetheless, Sullivan said dealer inventories are at lower
levels than they were at this time last year, when GM increased its
incentives to get vehicles off the showroom floors.
   ``This year there is no need for a big, year-end announcement of
incentive packages,'' Sullivan said.
   ``There are rebates on most vehicles now, but they're not as big
or as aggressive as before.''

<HEAD>Bond Prices Slip as Mideast Fears Grow</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bond prices slipped Friday in light, volatile
trading as participants took profits and fears grew that a war
could erupt in the Middle East, traders said.
   The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell 11-32 point, or $3.44
per $1,000 face amount. Its yield, which rises when prices fall,
rose to 8.79 percent from 8.75 percent late Thursday.
   The yield on the 30-year bond due in August 2020, which was
auctioned Thursday as part of the Treasury's quarterly refunding,
also fell 11-32 point in when-issued trading.
   Traders said the market had little reaction to a report showing
inflation moderated last month. The government reported that
wholesale prices in July edged down 0.1 percent.
   Analysts said the report, which normally would be positive for
the bond market, was discounted because it occurred before the
Middle East crisis sent oil prices surging.
   ``The market disregarded it as old news,'' said Kevin Flanagan,
a money market economist with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. ``The
Mideast situation is not going to go away.''
   Instead, bond prices were sent lower by bondholders who sold
issues to take profits after the Treasury's quarterly refunding,
which concluded Thursday, said Gib Clark, chief trader at Daiwa
Securities Inc.
   In addition, investors concerned that the Iraqi situation could
escalate were unwilling to hold large amounts of bonds over the
weekend, furthering the selloff, Clark said.
   The market has been concerned that the turmoil and resulting
rise in oil prices could heighten inflation, which erodes the value
of fixed-return securities such as bonds.
   Also influencing bond prices was a rumor that the Federal
Reserve would inject money into the banking system to lower
interest rates, Clark said. Lower rates benefit bonds.
   The Fed did add some funds, but only to make a technical
adjustment in the monetary supply, Flanagan said. The size of the
injection made it clear the central bank had not changed its
tight-money policy, he said.
   ``The market was a little disappointed about that,'' Clark said.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
governments were unchanged to &lsqb; point lower, intermediate
maturities fell from 3-32 point to 5-16 point, and long-term issues
were down by as much as &rsqb; point, according to Telerate Inc., a
financial information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, fell 0.98 to 1,153.00.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills fell to 7.61 percent as the
discount fell 2 basis points to 7.38 percent. Yields on six-month
bills fell to 7.64 percent as the discount fell 1 basis point to
7.27 percent. Yields on one-year bills fell to 7.65 percent as the
discount fell 3 basis points to 7.15 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each
other on overnight loans, was quoted at 8 percent, unchanged from
late Thursday.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds fell 1-16 point. The average yield to
maturity remained at 7.45 percent due to rounding.

<HEAD>Judge Sets Aside Verdict Against GTE</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. District Court judge Friday set a aside a
$15.9 million jury verdict against GTE Products Corp., calling for
a new trial in a case filed by an inventor who claimed the company
stole his idea.
   The jury in June had awarded the money to George Panagiotou, a
former rock band manager who had charged GTE appropriated trade
secrets for his cool lamp, which is used in movie studios.
   GTE had maintained that Panagiotou failed to show that any trade
secrets existed, or a contract had been breached.
   Judge John J. McNaught set aside the verdict, but Panagiotou's
attorney, Sydelle Pittas, said an appeal is likely.
   ``It was a big award, but we feel that the grounds on which it
was set aside are not valid and are confident of winning an appeal
of the judge's decision,'' she said.
   A spokesman for GTE said the company is pleased with the judge's
decision. ``GTE welcomes the retrial and the opportunity to
completely vindicate itself,'' the company said in a prepared
statement.
   Panagiotou's lawyers had argued that he started developing the
cool light when he realized how uncomfortable performers were under
the heat of movie studio lamps in the 1970s.
   His cool lights were used in the production of numerous popular
television shows. The trial, originally filed in California in
1984, brought such television stars as Ed Asner and Michael Landon
to testify on Panagiotou's behalf.
   Panagiotou has since started a successful home video light
company in Los Angeles.

Sales</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Northwest Airlines Inc. said Friday second-quarter earnings fell
32.6 percent from a year earlier, partly due to rising expenses,
while Trans World Airlines Inc. said second-quarter earnings rose
sharply due to gains from asset sales.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Northwest</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Northwest, which is privately held, reported earnings of $60
million for the three months ended June 30, compared with $89
million for the year-earlier quarter.
   Second quarter operating revenue rose to $1.8 billion from $1.6
billion.
   Operating expenses rose 13.5 percent, causing operating profit
to drop to $64 million from $107 million a year earlier.
   ``Our results were characterized by moderating fuel prices and a
continued devaluation of the yen in relation to the dollar earlier
in the quarter,'' said John Dasburg, executive vice president of
finance and administration. The company derives much of its income
in yen because of highly traveled U.S.-Japan routes.
   Dasburg said operating cash flow dropped from a year earlier due
to significant investments in maintenance and customer promotions.
   Northwest was taken private in August 1989 former Mariott Corp.
executive Alfred Checchi and other investors.
   As a private company, Northwest is not required to make its
finances public. The second quarter figures were disclosed as
required, however, to the U.S. Department of Transportation and
released by Northwest.

<HEAD>TWA</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   TWA reported second quarter earnings of $103.4 million, compared
with a $4.4 million loss a year earlier.
   Earnings in the latest quarter were boosted by one-time gains
totaling $160.2 million from sales of assets that included certain
airport facilities in Chicago, aircraft and a portion of TWA's
interest in the WORLDSPAN passenger reservation system.
   There also was a $19.8 million gain from the repurchase of
long-term debt securities, some at a discount.
   Without the one-time gains, operating profit fell by 45.5
percent, to $43.9 million from $80.5 million, due to increased fuel
costs, higher labor rates and other rising business costs.
   TWA operating revenue rose to $1.23 billion during the quarter
from $1.20 billion a year earlier, while operating expenses rose to
$1.18 billion from $1.12 billion.
   For the six months ended June 30, the airline had a net loss of
$39.6 million, compared with a loss of $87.4 million a year earlier.
   Operating revenue in the six months rose to $2.24 billion from
$2.19 billion a year earlier.

<HEAD>Stocks Sharply Lower on Middle East Jitters</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIANN CAPRINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The stock market tumbled sharply lower Friday as
concerns flared up over the volatile Middle East.
   The widely followed Dow Jones industrial average of 30 stocks
was off 42.33 points at 2,716.58, putting its loss for the week at
93.07 points.
   At one point in the afternoon, the Dow was down 50 points,
triggering a New York Stock Exchange limit on computerized trading
strategies. Analysts said the so-called circuit breaker helped pull
the market back from its worst levels.
   Analysts had expected traders to lighten their stock holdings
ahead of an uncertain weekend, but a flurry of heated statements
surrounding the Persian Gulf crisis combined with higher oil prices
and higher interest rates to pressure stocks lower.
   ``Things got very nasty'' as investors flocked to safe havens
like short-term U.S. government securities and precious metals,
said Hugh Johnson, senior vice president at First Albany Corp.
   Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones by about 5 to 2 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
1,038 down, 436 up and 515 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 145.34 million
shares, down from 155.81 million Thursday.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 179.42 million shares.
   After advances the past two days, many traders were beginning to
think that the market had found an equilibrium and that the Middle
East crisis was showing signs of stabilizing.
   The amount of stock selling began to ``trickle down,'' said Gene
Jay Seagle, a vice president at Gruntal Financial Inc., as
evidenced by the session's relatively light volume. ``Most
investors who wanted out are pretty well out.''
   But what fanned the downturn, according to Johnson, was
``saber-rattling from all corners.''
   The market was hit with a flurry of news, beginning with a
statement from Iraqi President Saddam Hussein urging other Arabs to
wage ``holy war'' against America.
   Elsewhere, Arab leaders in Cairo said they would send troops to
help protect Saudi Arabia while denouncing the Iraqi invasion. In
addition, a number of nations were poised to send troops to join
U.S. forces in the Arabian desert.
   ``So far the game seems to be going against Saddam, which is
positive for the market,'' Seagle said.
   Traders ignored a report showing wholesale prices declined a
better-than-expected 0.1 percent in July. ``It was an
extraordinarily good number, but the market's behavior dramatized
how much the focus is on the Middle East,'' Johnson said.
   Oil issues were mostly higher. In the energy sector, Texaco rose
\ at 63&lsqb;; Chevron was up 1&lsqb; at 78; Pennzoil was up { at 81&rsqb;, but
Amoco was down 1 at 55} and Exxon lost \ to 51|.
   Precious metals stocks rose as gold prices jumped higher. Hecla
Mining was up { at 12\; Placer Dome rose ~ to 17~; Newmont Gold was
up 2 at 51&lsqb;; Homestake Mining was 1{ at 21~, and ASA Ltd. was up 1}
at 52}.
   Among other actively traded Big Board issues, IBM was down 1\ at
102; Wal-Mart was off } at 29~; Boeing lost 1\ to 53\; Eli Lilly
was down 2} at 75\, and Unitel was up 1&lsqb; at 26{.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $34.21 billion, or 1.06
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
2.09 to 184.15.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index lost 5.38 to 395.82, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index declined 4.42 to 335.52.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market fell
4.95 to 408.03. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 339.32, down 2.17.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Treasury Department said Friday a $368,000
civil penalty had been assessed against the National Bank of
Washington because of what the government said were improper
currency transaction reports discovered during a money laundering
investigation.
   The penalty was assessed before the government took over the
bank on Aug. 1 after its parent, Washington Bancorporation, filed
for bankruptcy protection from its creditors.
   The Treasury said the penalty was based on the bank's failure to
file currency transaction reports as required by the Bank Secrecy
Act. Most of the violations were discovered during a federal
undercover operation, it said.
   ``Despite an earlier warning by Treasury and the involvement of
its former senior vice president in money laundering, NBW continued
to rely on a woefully inadequate Bank Secrecy Act compliance
program which led to a number of violations and created a situation
rip for money laundering,'' said Assistant Secretary Peter K.
Nunez, who announced the fine.
   The penalty is the maximum authorized.

<HEAD>Stocks Tumble, Oil Prices Rise on Middle East Tension</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The stock market tumbled and oil prices climbed Friday as
belligerent rhetoric by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein unnerved
investors and heightened fears of an oil shortage.
   ``We're still seeing an underlying tension swelling in that
region,'' said Randall Rothenberg, a oil broker with Dean Witter
Reynolds Inc. in New York. ``The situation has not been averted.''
   The stock market closed the week with its worst performance
since Monday as virtually all sectors except gold and oil were
battered by tensions in the Middle East.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 blue-chip industrial stocks fell
42.33 points to 2,716.58, extending its weekly drop to 93.07 points.
   Analysts had expected some selling by investors reluctant to
hold on to stocks in case of further developments over the weekend.
   But Saddam called for a ``holy war'' against Western forces,
while Arab nations agreed to dispatch troops to Saudi Arabia, where
U.S. forces are positioned in what President Bush called a defense
against Iraqi invasion.
   Bush raised tensions by warning Iraq against sending out oil
tankers to evade an economic embargo. He also said Saddam would be
``foolish'' to invade Saudi Arabia.
   Those events created jitters in the oil futures market on a
belief they might lead to further disruptions of oil supplies from
the Middle East, a critical source of world fuel. A supply shortage
would boost demand, in turn pushing up prices.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the September contract for
U.S. crude oil rose 56 cents to $26.23 per 42-gallon barrel. Crude
oil has risen nealry $6 per barrel since the Iraqi invasion Aug. 2.
   Among refined petroleum products traded on the Merc, the
near-term contract for home heating oil soared 2.84 cents to 72.61
cents per gallon. The September contract for unleaded gasoline
jumped 3.03 cents to 79.45 cents per gallon.
   In addition to Saddam's speech, oil futures prices were helped
by a statement by Venezuela denying it planned to raise output to
cover production by Iraq and Kuwait. Western nations have embargoed
oil from the two nations.
   Meanwhile, gasoline prices at the pump dropped for the first
time since Iraq invaded Kuwait. The Automobile Association of
America said the average price of unleaded fuel nationwide was down
0.3 cent Friday to $1.25 a gallon.
   On other financial markets, gold for current delivery jumped
$11.10 a troy ounce to close at $396.90 on New York's Commodity
Exchange. The dollar was lower against most major currencies
despite the threat of escalating hostilities.
   Gold rose because it is viewed as a safe haven in times of
distress and as a hedge against inflation likely to result from the
sharp increase in oil prices.
   Bond prices fell as traders reduced their portfolios before the
weekend. The Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond fell 11-32 point, or
$3.44 per $1,000 face amount and its yield rose to 8.79 percent.
   Earlier in Tokyo, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 286.18
points, or 1.04 percent, closing the week at 27,329.55, its lowest
closing level since October 1988. The London stock market lost 11.1
points to close at 2,233.8.

<DATELINE>CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Venezuelan Energy and Ministry on
Friday denied reports that it had ordered the state oil industry to
raise output to cover Iraq and Kuwait's OPEC quotas.
   ``Until this moment, the minister has not ordered any increase
and our production is still limited to our OPEC quota of 1.945
million barrels per day of crude,'' a ministry spokesman told The
Associated Press.
   ``However, a new order could be given later on, depending on
OPEC agreements,'' he added.
   Venezuela will not make any unilateral hikes, and in any case,
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is awaiting word
from Arab leaders on the success of their peace efforts before
changing the level of output, the spokesman said.
   Energy Minister Celestino Armas is in ``constant touch'' with
other OPEC ministers. The cartel has yet to make any decision about
making up for Iraq's 3.1 million barrels per day and Kuwait's 1.5
million, the spokesman said.
   ``But depending on what happens in the Arab world, minister
Armas may make an announcement within a day or two,'' he said.
   Reports from New York and elsewhere had indicated that the state
oil monopoly Petroleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA) had already
ordered its subsidiaries to raise output by around 500,000 bpd.
   However, by law, the ministry imparts instructions to PDVSA,
which cannot raise production on its own.
   According to a recent nationwide test, Venezuela has the
capacity to produce between 2.6 and 2.7 million barrels of oil per
day, excluding heavy crudes. Its reserves are sixth in the world,
not counting oil in the Orinoco bitumen belt.
   Venezuela's OPEC limitations have led to friction between the
ministry and PDVSA, which has advocated overproduction to finance a
$20 billion program to expand the oil and petrochemical industries
over the next 10 years.
   A main goal is to raise production capacity to 3.5 million
barrels per day by 1995 and to 4 million by 2000.

<HEAD>South East Says it May Lay Off Workers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Kentucky's third largest independent coal company said Friday it
was notifying more than 800 workers of possible layoffs in October.
   The United Mine Workers, which won the right to represent South
East Coal Co. workers last month, dismissed the announcement as a
``scare tactic'' designed to influence upcoming contract talks.
   South East President Harry LaViers Jr., made the announcement in
a one-page press release. He and other South East officials could
not be reached by telephone for comment.
   ``We hope not to have to layoff everyone, economics will
determine that, but we are not currently in a position to determine
which employees, or how many, will be affected,'' LaViers said.
   ``Therefore, we believed it was necessary to notify all
employees.''
   South East has underground mines and a coal processing plant in
Kentucky. It has about 740 hourly workers; the rest are managers,
foremen, office staff or engineers.
   The statement said South East believes more than 50 employees
will be laid off by Oct. 12. The company was notifying all workers
to comply with a federal law that requires companies to give
workers 60-day notice of impending layoffs.

<DATELINE>CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Inventor Howard O. McMahon, a former
head of Arthur D. Little Inc., has died at the age of 75.
   McMahon, who lived in Cambridge, died of heart disease Sunday at
Mount Auburn Hospital, said an Arthur D. Little spokesman. The
Cambridge-based firm specializes in international management and
technology consulting.
   McMahon joined Arthur D. Little as a research associate in 1943.
He succeeded Gen. James M. Gavin as its president in 1964.
   In 1951 the scientist received the Franklin Institute's Edward
Longstreth Medal for co-developing the Collins helium cryostat,
which liquefies helium gas at minus 452 degrees Fahrenheit.
   The American Ceramics Society gave McMahon the Frank Forrest
Award in 1952 for his research in thermal radiation. In 1979, he
received the Samuel C. Collins Award from the Cryogenic Engineering
Conference.
   McMahon earned a doctorate in physical chemistry and physics
from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. While still an
undergraduate, a Canadian neon sign company paid him $100 for his
patent on a bubbling Christmas tree candle.
   After becoming president of Arthur D. Little, McMahon began to
organize programs at the American Academy for the Advancement of
Science in which the public, scientists and students discussed
political and social issues.
   McMahon also began pushing corporations to conduct social
audits, essentially the costs to their employees, customers and the
community at large of their doing business.
   After retiring from Arthur D. Little in 1977, McMahon founded
the Helix Technology Corp., which manufactures cryogenic
refrigeration systems in Waltham.

<HEAD>Computer Firm Announces 83 Percent Jump In Fiscal 1990 Profits</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Boosted by a 62 percent increase in
revenues, Sun Microsystems Inc., on Thursday reported $49.1 milion
in profits in the fourth fiscal quarter, up from a loss a year ago.
   The profit works out to 51 cents per share. In the same period
last year, the company lost $20.3 million, or 25 cents per share,
the computing systems company said.
   Sun Microsystems had revenues of $700.1 million in the
April-June period, compared with $431.2 million for the same three
months in 1989.
   Scott McNealy, president and chief executive officer of Sun
Microsystems, attributed the company's strong revenue growth to its
workgroup computing business, including powerful workstations.
   ``More than 34,000 units were shipped in the fourth quarter,
bringing our worldwide installed base to more than 285,000 units,''
McNealy said in a statement. ``We had record booking during the
quarter and ended the period with a record backlog of orders.''
   For the fiscal year, Sun Microsystems had earnings of $111.2
million, or $1.21 per share, on revenues of $2.47 billion. For
fiscal 1989, earnings were $60.8 million, or 76 cents per share, on
revenue of $1.77 billion.
