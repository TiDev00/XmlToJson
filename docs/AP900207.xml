<HEAD>Magistrate Denies Defense Request For Document Inventory</HEAD>

   A federal magistrate on Wednesday denied a request
by ousted Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega for an immediate
inventory and inspection of materials seized from his homes and
offices since the U.S. invasion of Panama.
   Prosecutors already have promised to provide an inventory of
seized documents and materials. But defense attorneys say the
government is dragging its feet, and claim officials may remove or
destroy materials critical to Noriega's case.
   ``Defense counsel has reason to believe that some documents and
tangible objects ... have been stolen by members of the U.S.
military forces occupying Panama,'' the motion said. ``In order to
avoid any more mishandling, compliance with (the previous order) is
mandatory.''
   ``The U.S. attorney's office is dragging its feet,'' Noriega
attorney Steven Kollin told Magistrate William C. Turnoff, who last
month ordered that an inventory be provided to the defense.
   Diane Cossin, spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office,
declined to comment on whether any potential evidence in the
possession of the military had disappeared.
   ``We do not believe anything has been removed from inventory''
in Miami, she said.
   Turnoff set a hearing for Feb. 14 to check the progress in
providing such lists.
   While Turnoff said it's critical the defense be provided access
to all materials, he denied the motion for a prompt inventory and
immediate access to seized material.
   ``We fear that this material will be lost or destroyed or
somehow disappear,'' Kollin said.
   One concern about the Noriega case was that some materials could
be used by the defense to make embarrassing disclosures of
sensitive intelligence information. Kollin said some material
seized by the military may be favorable to his client's case.
   Prosecutors have agreed to provide lists of Noriega materials,
but complains the defense hasn't provided specific details about
locations of his homes and offices.
   During the hearing, Turnoff suggested that a cutoff date be set
for the government to provide the inventory.
   But Assistant U.S. Attorney Michael P. Sullivan protested,
saying discovery ``is a continuing process under the law'' and the
court should not set a deadline. Turnoff instead set the status
hearing.
   The magistrate said he has found ``that the government has made
a good-faith effort to comply, but I want them to continue their
efforts.''
   Kollin said he intended to go to Panama to view the items listed
in inventory, but he was told by Sullivan in a letter that the
government has no objection but cannot guarantee access.
   At Kollin's request, Turnoff directed that material in the
inventory be withheld from the Panamanian government. Sullivan said
he might appeal that part of the order.
   ``We're not in a position to direct the U.S. government not to
turn over materials to Panama.''

   An unemployed maintenance worker suspected
in the Christmas weekend killings of four family members who were
bound, shot and set on fire during a robbery died Wednesday in a
shootout with police.
   His mother was charged with second-degree murder in the case.
   State police said it was unclear whether the man, Anthony
Turner, 33, was killed by officers' gunfire or by a blast from his
own shotgun. He was holding the shotgun to his chin when officers
burst into his apartment, said State Police Superintendent Thomas
Constantine.
   Turner's 2-year-old child was turned over to social workers.
   Authorities had a warrant charging Turner with the Dec. 22
murders of Warren Harris, 39, Dolores Harris, 41, and their
children, 15-year-old Shelby and 11-year-old Marc.
   Turner's mother, Shirley Kinge, 54, was arraigned Wednesday
night in Dryden Town Court on four counts of second-degree murder
and one count each of arson and criminal possession of stolen
property. Town Justice Edwin Sweetland ordered her held without
bail in Tompkins County Jail.
   According to court papers, police discovered Ms. Kinge's
fingerprints on a gasoline can found in the Harris home. Police
also alleged she used a bank card belonging to Warren and Delores
Harris to get $200 from an automatic teller machine.
   Police discovered the bodies the morning of Dec. 23 after a
neighbor reported hearing a smoke alarm in the Harris' farm house
in an affluent section of this Ithaca suburb.
   The parents and Marc were found in one room, bound hand and
foot, with pillowcases over their heads, Constantine said. Each had
been shot in the back of the head with a .22 caliber gun.
   The teen-age girl was found in another room. She had been
sexually assaulted and shot in the head, police said.
   All four bodies were set on fire some time after the killings,
Constantine said. The fire went out.
   Money and credit cards were taken from the house, and robbery is
considered the motive.
   Turner was traced through composite drawings of a man who used
credit cards taken from the Harris home, police said.
   Shortly before 7 a.m. Wednesday, troopers forced their way into
Turner's apartment, which is about three miles from the Harris
home, on a rural street dotted with mobile homes and rusting trucks.
   When troopers told Turner to put his shotgun down, he turned
toward them and fired at least one round, Constantine said.
   At the same time, a trooper opened fire.
   Turner had been a suspect for seven to 10 days. Neighbors said
his apartment had been staked out since Friday. The search warrants
that allowed police to enter were issued Tuesday.
   Turner lived in one half of the duplex and his mother and
grandmother, Sally Reese, lived in the other half, state police
said.
   Turner, who had worked off and on in cleaning jobs, had a record
of arrests in New York City for burglary, robbery and theft with a
deadly weapon, Constantine said.
   Turner may have known he was wanted, Constantine said. An
unidentified associate of Turner's told police Turner always had
guns and would shoot it out with officers if they tried to arrest
him, Constantine said.
   Investigators said they don't have any other suspects.

<HEAD>`Imagining Brad,' A New Play by Peter Hedges, Opens Off-Broadway</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: No PMs planned.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL KUCHWARA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Drama Critic</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The title character in ``Imagining Brad'' has no
arms, no legs, almost no hair, cauliflower ears and flaky, crusty
skin that makes him look, in the words of his wife's good friend,
like ``a Christmas cookie.''
   These are some of the qualities that make Brad an ideal husband,
according to Peter Hedges' dark comedy that the Circle Repertory
Company brought to off-Broadway's Players Theater on Tuesday night.
But as the centerpiece of Hedges' blessedly short, 80-minute play,
Brad, who is neither seen nor heard, makes for less than riveting
dramatic material.
   The comedy, a bleak meditation on marriage, is absurd without
being insightful. The characters are long on weirdness, short on
sympathy. Much of the play consists of tedious, unenlightening
conversations between Brad's wife _ she is never identified by name
_ and Dana Sue, her new best friend.
   In church, at bars, even driving around town, the two women
discuss their men. Dana Sue can't speak highly enough of her
husband, whom she describes as handsome and a good lover. It's only
later in the evening that the audience discovers that he is a
violent man.
   But Brad's wife is content with her mate. Their relationship is
a happy one, even if it only consists of her singing songs to her
bedridden husband. The woman even suggests that Dana Sue ditch her
husband for a man like Brad. There are a lot of them out there, she
confides. Better a vegetable than a wifebeater, Hedges seems to be
saying.
   The play includes a prologue, a long speech by a girl named
Valerie who grows up to be Brad's wife. It's her birthday, but she
spends most of the time talking about her first menstrual cycle _
either on the phone to her girlfriends or holding a mock news
conference about it.
   Director Joe Mantello allows the charming Melissa Joan Hart, who
plays the the teen-age Valerie, to rush through her monologue,
making some of it unintelligible. Sharon Ernster gives a good ol'
girl performance, complete with honey-dipped Southern accent, as
Dana Sue, while Erin Cressida Wilson displays an earnest looniness
that lends Brad's wife some credibility.
   But the play isn't funny enough to be a comedy, no matter how
outrageous its situations, or compelling enough to be a good drama.
Like its inert hero, ``Imagining Brad'' just lies there.

<HEAD>Stars Remember Irving Berlin</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   Actress Helen Hayes says Irving Berlin saved her
marriage plans with playwright Charles MacArthur by playing his
then-newly written song ``Always.''
   ``Our spirits were very low,'' she recalled Tuesday during a
two-hour salute to the songwriter.
   ``There were so many impediments to that marriage. My protective
friends were always warning me I was going to be in terrible
trouble: `He's fickle and he'll break your heart.' I was beginning
to feel fear and Charlie was disconsolate.''
   Berlin played them the song he had finished that afternoon.
   ``Well, we were healed and we felt secure and that became our
song for the rest of our lives,'' Hayes said. ``For 30
anniversaries we sang that or played it on the phonograph.''
   The tribute to Berlin, who died in September at age 101, was
held at the 1,010-seat Music Box Theater, which Berlin and Sam
Harris built in 1921.
   Samuel Goldwyn Jr. recalled that as a child he asked Mary Ellin
Berlin what her father did. Her reply:
   ``He writes some songs for a Miss Merman to sing. Sometimes she
doesn't sing them the way he wants and Daddy gets very angry.''
   In 1937, the Berlins took Goldwyn with them on their boat to
Alaska. There was a piano in the room where the children played,
Goldwyn said.
   ``Each morning he would come in and bang on the piano while we
tried to play,'' he said. ``It was very distracting for us.''
   Tony Bennett sang ``It's a Lovely Day'' and ``Let's Face the
Music and Dance.'' Rosemary Clooney and Howard McGillin sang a duet
on ``You're Just in Love.''
   Roberta Flack sang a vibrant ``Always'' and Dorothy Loudon an
emotional ``Falling in Love Is Wonderful.''
   Mandy Patinkin sang ``Puttin' on the Ritz'' with two sets of
lyrics.
   Songwriters Sammy Cahn, Jule Styne and Burton Lane each
performed a Berlin song.
   Cy Coleman called Berlin ``our No. 1 songwriter,'' and when he
played ``Alexander's Ragtime Band,'' everyone joined in singing.
   The show was presented by Berlin's daughters, Mary Ellin
Barrett, Linda Emmet and Elizabeth Peters. The American Society of
Composers, Authors and Publishers, which Berlin helped establish,
produced it.

<TEXT>
   Cartoonists have become the conscience of Hong
Kong as they acidly etch the desperation felt by a people destined
to live under the flag of Communist China in seven years.
   With politicians bickering and editorial writers anxious not to
irritate the leaders in Beijing, comic strips have become one of
the few platforms where Hong Kong's fears are expressed with often
brutal clarity.
   Just after the crackdown June 4 in Beijing on the democracy
movement, cartoonist Juan Tze drew Premier Li Peng in a bathtub of
blood.
   ``Is it hot enough?'' asked a soldier holding a bucket of
steaming ``people's blood.''
   After Sir Geoffrey Howe, then the British foreign secretary,
told Hong Kong that Britain could not guarantee the territory's
future, Larry Feign, an American expatriate, summed up the feelings
of many.
   ``I don't know who to hate more, Deng Xiaoping or Margaret
Thatcher,'' says one of his comic strip characters.
   After 149 years of British rule, Hong Kong returns to China in
1997. Although Beijing has promised to retain the territory's
free-wheeling economic and social system for 50 years, many of Hong
Kong's 5.7 million people lost faith in that promise after the June
4 crackdown.
   Many also have little confidence in faction-ridden local
politicians, says Joseph Y.S. Cheng, a leading educator and writer
in the colony. Newspapers also practice self-censorship in their
criticism of Beijing, he said.
   ``People look to comic strips as an outlet for their
frustrations,'' Cheng said. ``Their popularity demonstrates that we
have a solid groundswell of anti-communist, anti-China feeling,
especially after June 4.''
   Adds Feign: ``Cartoons appeal to the Chinese becaus you can get
your meaning across indirectly.''
   Cheng said that only in the last few years have comic strips
become an important political outlet in Hong Kong. A recent
exhibition of cartoons at the Hong Kong Arts Centre drew 40,000
people over several weeks.
   Feign and Juan are perhaps the two best known cartoonists in the
colony.
   Frenetic and balding, Feign, 34, is author of a comic strip for
the English-language South China Morning Post called ``The World of
Lily Wong.''
   For the five years since he moved to Hong Kong from Orange
County in California with his Chinese wife, Feign has charted the
lives of Lily, a smart, sexy Hong Kong woman, and Stuart Wright, a
bumbling but good-hearted American.
   Stuart wants to marry Lily and give her the passport she covets
but Lily isn't in love and so far has refused him. Through their
relationship, Feign explores the often blatant racism inflicted on
Chinese by Westerners. He also pokes fun at the ways Chinese view
Westerners, known as ``devils'' in Cantonese.
   A tall man, with the comportment of a Mandarin official in old
China's imperial court, Juan is more self-consciously political
than Feign.
   He grew up during Hong Kong's most turbulent times and remembers
watching the bloody anti-British riots in 1967 from a rickety
balcony on his tenement home. He began drawing comics as an art
student at the Chinese University of Hong Kong in the 1970s.
   He took a page from early 20th century Chinese history, during
which cartoons were a popular form of political agitation, and
decided to use comics to fight for Hong Kong's common man. He went
to work at the Chinese-language Ming Pao.
   ``My generation is different from my parents','' said Juan, now
33. ``They came from China and are concerned with basic things like
food and money. We are searching for other things, from the
spirit.''
   When China recently announced its opposition to a British plan
to give passports to key Hong Kong professionals and officials,
Juan drew a man sitting on his bed, his birth certificate, identity
card and passport scattered beneath him. ``Who am I? Who am I?''
the man screamed as his wife snored beside him.
   ``We have an identity crisis in Hong Kong,'' Juan said. ``London
and Beijing are deciding our fate and we can't influence them. I
wanted to describe our feeling of hopelessness.''
   Following the crackdown in Beijing, Juan drew Chinese Premier Li
Peng explaining why tanks were used to put down the rebellion. ``We
ran out of cars,'' Li tells a visitor.
   Another strip shows an Englishman offering Hong Kong on a fork
into the drooling mouth of a corrupt Chinese cadre. ``Be a brave
Chinaman,'' the Englishman says.
   Juan, who hopes to stay in Hong Kong after 1997, has recently
published a book of his work, ``Black Goods.''
   ``I guess the Chinese might call me a counterrevolutionary,'' he
said with a wry smile. ``I'm just helping them gather proof.''
   If Juan expresses the desperation of Hong Kong, Feign captures
the absurdity of its life.
   Living on the cusp of two worlds _ Hong Kong Chinese and Western
expatriate _ Feign has a unique vantage point.
   ``In the beginning, my position gave me a chance to pull off a
lot of good gags,'' said Feign. ``But now as things get serious I
find it harder to draw. It's becoming a tragedy.''

   Film star Bruce Willis caused young
hearts to throb when he turned up unannounced at a ski area while
the set for ``Die Hard II'' was being arranged.
   ``Oh yeah, he created quite a stir,'' said Gordon West, a
manager at the Mission Ridge ski area. ``He had every lady going
`ooh ah ooh.' He came in incognito and rented his skis under some
other name.''
   Jason Stromme, a 17-year-old high school student, said he
noticed Willis eating lunch Sunday with four people at the central
Washington ski lodge.
   ``He got up and left because everyone was looking at him,''
Stromme said, and then youngsters pounced on his table, grabbing
the water glass and other items the star had touched.
   Scenes from the thriller ``Die Hard II'' were being filmed this
week in Leavenworth, said Chamber of Commerce director Laura Jobin.

   Guitar virtuoso Eric Clapton is planning a
six-week U.S. tour that will bring the British rocker to 27 cities
in the spring.
   It will be Clapton's first U.S. tour since 1987, although he
appeared with the Rolling Stones several times during their
just-completed ``Steel Wheels'' tour.
   Clapton's smashing groups of the 1960s and early '70s included
Cream, Blind Faith and Derek and the Dominoes. Unlike other
megastars on the road in the past year, his tour will not have a
corporate sponsor, publicist Mitch Zamarin said Tuesday.
   The tour opens in Atlanta on March 28, then heads up the Eastern
Seaboard before moving west and ending May 5 in San Francisco.
   Clapton's band features guitarist Phil Palmer, keyboardists Greg

   Prince Charles appealed to architects and planners
to minimize their use of tropical hardwoods, whose harvest is one
cause of rampant deforestation.
   ``The sands of time in the tropical hour glass are running out
fast and we can't turn it upside down and watch the sands run out
again,'' Charles said Tuesday in a speech to the Royal Botanical
Gardens.
   Despite agreements to import only timber grown in sustainably
managed forests, it is impossible to know whether given shipments
come from properly managed forests or not, he said.
   Charles criticized the International Tropical Timber
Organization for making no mention of the rights and needs of the
forest-dwellers in its articles of agreement, and said new
mechanisms are needed to protect rainforest regions.
   ``This is clearly a massive challenge, but it seems to be that
we cannot simply go on talking about the need to protect the
world's rain forests and not create the kind of institutions and
mechanisms which will actually make that possible,'' Charles said.

   Ticky-tacky _ that's how actress Kirstie Alley
of ``Cheers'' fame first saw the city of angels.
   ``I was very amazed at how most houses in Los Angeles looked
alike,'' Alley told Good Housekeeping for its March issue. ``After
a while I thought that if I saw one more white-on-white-on-white
room I would gag. The furniture's too big, also.''
   When she headed for Los Angeles in 1981 to become an actress,
the Kansas-born Alley said, she left behind a job as an interior
decorator and a $400-a-week cocaine habit.
   ``I had spent a fortune decorating peoples' homes and I didn't
even know what I was doing,'' she said.
   With roles in ``Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan'' and the
miniseries ``North &amp; South'' under her belt, she is happily settled
into life with husband Parker Stevenson and their myriad pets and
guests, in a 22-room mansion on the former Al Jolson estate.
   ``She's a biker's chick,'' ``Cheers'' co-star Ted Danson said.
   ``If you want to have a verbal flirtation, Kirstie's your
girl,'' Danson said.
   ``He's a very good kisser,'' Alley responded.

   Despite its early worries about reporters'
safety during President Bush's drug summit next week in Colombia,
the White House will let an expanded press pool cover the meeting.
   That was reported Tuesday by Tim Russert, NBC's Washington
bureau chief, chairman of the network TV pool covering the one-day
trip.
   ``This is an extremely difficult, sensitive trip because of the
security, but the White House accomodated us in everything we _
certainly television broadcasting _ asked for,'' said Russert.
   The four-nation drug summit is being held in Cartagena, a
coastal town on Colombia's Caribbean side about 400 miles north of
the capitol city of Bogota.
   The usual White House press contingent _ 11 reporters
traditionally fly with Bush on Air Force One, followed by others on
a chartered plane _ will go with him to Cartagena, Russert said.
   In addition, an expanded press pool will be allowed to accompany
the president to the actual meeting site at Barranquilla 65 miles
to the northeast.
   The expanded pool could have as many as 35 members, said Sig
Rogich, a White House spokesman. He estimated that at least several
hundred foreign and American news staffers will be on hand in
Cartagena.
   Each U.S. network will be allowed to send a correspondent and a
camera crew to the actual summit meeting, Russert said, contrasting
that with the usual pool arrangement in which one network team
provides coverage for all.
   After the meeting, Bush is to hold a news conference, Rogich
said. He said he had no additional details, but network officials
expect the press conference will be held in Cartagena.
   There have been reports of threats of violence against Bush and
others in Colombia by drug lords angered by the Columbian
government's crackdwn on their operations. CBS News said last month
that drug terrorists were buying surface-to-air missiles to try to
shoot down Bush's plane.
   On Jan. 24, White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, citing
worries about reporters' safety, said the Secret Service was
confident it could protect Bush in Colombia but had no authority to
protect journalists covering his trip.
   No network anchor is scheduled to go to the Colombian summit,
although ``NBC Nightly News'' anchor Tom Brokaw flew to Bogota last
weekend to tape reports and interviews as part of NBC's reportage
on Bush's trip.
   Brokaw said that although he was more uneasy while on a story in
Beirut, ``you can certainly sense the tension'' in Bogota, where
the drug war has made fear and personal weapons part of daily life.
   ``Everybody's armed, and everybody who can afford one drives a
big Mercedes with armor plating,'' he said.
   Russert said White House officials with whom he discussed
televison coverage of Bush's trip cited nothing specific that they
worried about, ``but they obviously are extremely concerned about
security.''
   ``And frankly, so are news organizations,'' he said.
   However, ABC News Vice President Jeff Gralnick downplayed the
potential of danger to reporters.
   ``Right now, we haven't heard anything from our people in
Cartagena that says `Get excited,''' Gralnick said.
   ``We're going to be cautious and and sensitive to cirumstances
that might exist,'' he said. ``We'd be crazy not to.
   ``But we have had people in and out of Colombia since this
(drug) story first became a major concern. And they're all fine,
and they continue to be fine.''

<HEAD>After 20 Months, Grand Jury Tells Jacksonville It Stinks</HEAD>

   The nose knows without any help from
the legal system, but a grand jury report tells residents what they
know already:
   Jacksonville smells.
   The grand jury issued the report on June 14, 1988, but it had
been sealed as two paper mills and two chemical plants criticized
in the report challenged it in court. The four companies say that
have taken expensive steps to eliminate smelly emissions.
   ``I don't think we need a grand jury to tell us Jacksonville
smells,'' said Dick Kennedy, a frequent critic of the city's
pollution policies.
   ``I don't think anybody should be put out of business, but I
think they should stay out of court and spend their money cleaning
up the air,'' said Kennedy, who said he lives downwind from the two
paper mills.
   After months of court challenges, Chief Circuit Judge John E.
Santora ordered the report released Monday evening.
   ``The history of Jacksonville's achievements is preceded only by
its reputation as `The City That Smells.' To each of us
individually, and to the community as a whole, this situation can
only be termed an embarrassment,'' the report said.
   The report by the 23-member panel said emissions have resulted
in more than 4,000 citizen complaints since 1985.
   ``The odors have an adverse impact on their property values, and
unreasonably interfere with their health, welfare, and comfortable
enjoyment of life and property,'' it said.
   Mayor Tommy Hazouri has campaigned to clean up Jacksonville's
odors and the city council approved a tough anti-odor ordinance to
cite offending industries in March 1988, parts of which have been
thrown out by the courts.
   The panel also found that local industries have not taken all
the steps they could to solve odor problems and could have made
improvements years ago.
   The grand jury report concluded that if industries fail to get
rid of stinky odors that city, state and federal officials should
pursue civil and criminal remedies to stop further emissions.
   At the same time, the grand jury indicted SCM Glidco Organics
Corp., Jefferson Smurfit Corp., Seminole Kraft Corp. and Union Camp
Corp. for violating air pollution laws. The charges since have
either been dropped or struck down.
   The four companies challenged the report, and Santora Jr.
ordered it sealed.
   The Florida Times-Union and the state attorney's office
challenged the sealing of the report. The case wound its way up to
the 1st District Court of Appeals and through another round of
motions before Santora ordered it released.
   Chief Assistant State Attorney John Delaney said Tuesday he
wishes the report could have been released when the grand jury
completed its work.
   John Baggett, operations director for Union Camp, said Tuesday
the chemical company fought the presentment because it was unfair
to the industries.
   ``We were not objecting to the fact that there are objectionable
odors in Jacksonville,'' Baggett said. ``We did not agree with
their broad-brush approach that the industries had done nothing to
address the problem.''
   Union Camp has spent about $1 million in 1988 and 1989,
installing and improving equipment to cut down on odors.
   But he said the company had committed to do that before the
grand jury investigation.
   ``The report is grossly biased, factually deficient and very
misleading to the general public,'' said SCM Glidco President
George Robbins. His company has spent more than $2 million to
reduce odors.
   Robbins pointed out that about a third of the odor complaints in
1989 were directed at plants operated by the City of Jacksonville.
Most of them concerned a sewage treatment plant. Fewer than 7
percent of the complaints involved SCM Glidco.
   Seminole Kraft, a paper mill, announced last week that it was
spending $100 million to convert is cardboard-making process to use
recycled cardboard instead of wood chips, eliminating a major
source of odor.

   ``Lethal Weapon'' outmuscled the Walker
family spy ring, two debut shows ran into trouble and a new show's
rise suggested Americans like to watch themselves, according to the
latest A.C. Nielsen Co. ratings.
   NBC's shows captured half the spots in the Nielsen's top 10 for
last week, which started February's sweeps, one of four periods a
year when ratings are used to compute advertising value.
   ABC put four shows in the top 10, including No. 1 ``Roseanne.''
CBS' lone entry was its perennial favorite ``60 Minutes.''
   ``Roseanne'' led with a 24.1 rating; NBC gave viewers ``Cheers''
with 22.7, ``The Cosby Show'' with 22.4 and ``Golden Girls'' with
21.5. CBS'`60 Minutes'' was fifth at 21.3 and NBC's ``Empty Nest''
was sixth at 20.0.
   In seventh place with 19.8 was ``America's Funniest Home
Videos'' on ABC, a Sunday night show that uses home video clips
sent in by viewers. ABC claims the show has increased its audience
10 percent since it premiered Jan. 14.
   Rounding out the top 10 were ABC's ``The Wonder Years'' with
19.2, ABC's ``Coach'' with 18.8 and NBC's ``Unsolved Mysteries''
with 18.7.
   Each ratings point represents the nation's 92.1 million homes
with televisions.
   Two mid-season replacements had unspectacular premieres.
``City,'' featuring Valerie Harper as a city manager, made its CBS
debut at No. 35, and CBS' ``Grand Slam,'' about competing bondsmen,
failed to make bail at No. 68.
   Despite widespread distribution in video and cable, the Mel
Gibson-Danny Glover cop movie ``Lethal Weapon,'' on NBC's Sunday
night lineup, managed only to stake out 12th place.
   But that was well above the 28th place for the first part of
CBS' ``A Family of Spies,'' the miniseries about the John A. Walker
spy ring, which was also shown Sunday night.
   Two sweeps specials were in the top 20 shows, NBC's ``David
Letterman Eighth Anniversary Special'' at No. 17 and ABC's ``Sammy
Davis Jr.'s 60th Anniversary Celebration'' at No. 19.
   In the battle of the Monday night movies, NBC's ``Where Pigeons
Go To Die'' was in a three-way tie for 24th place (with ``Family
Matters'' and ``Murphy Brown'') but outflew the sexier-sounding
``Rich Men, Single Women,'' in 27th place on ABC.
   NBC was the lead network with a 14.0 average, followed by ABC's
13.5 and CBS' 11.7. For the season, NBC leads with 14.8 followed by
ABC's 13.0 and CBS with 12.3.
   For news shows, ABC's ``World News Tonight'' was first with
11.1, followed by ``NBC Nightly News,'' 10.4, and ``The CBS Evening
News,' 10.0.

   President Bush told U.S. troops taking
part in war games Tuesday that political proposals by Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev are encouraging but that America
must not let changes in Eastern Europe ``lull us into a sense of
complacency.'
   The president, getting a first-hand look at U.S. forces in
action, declared: ``Military challenges to democracy persist in
every hemisphere and America must always be prepared to fight for
freedom and security.''
   Critics, especially congressional Democrats, contend that Bush's
military budget ignores the dismantling of the Communist empire.
   The president defended his plan to make military cuts in select
areas _ such as bases _ but to spend more on strategic weapons as
he began a three-day trip combining visits to defense installations
with Republican fund-raising.
   A continent away, the Democratic chairman of the House Armed
Services Committee kept up the pressure for changes, saying the
administration's $292.1 billion defense budget, with a continued
emphasis on big strategic programs such as long-range missiles,
fails ``to match the new political realities at home or abroad.''
   ``This administration's approach reflects old thinking rather
than these new realities,'' Rep. Les Aspin of Wisconsin said at a
congressional hearing in Washington.
   Bush told the soldiers the U.S. Army ``the premier land force in
the world today.'' He said, ``The realistic battles you wage here
forge tactical expertise, leadership, and a fighting spirit. And
that's what we need.''
   Bush's talk was carried by radio to troops on both sides of the
mock battle at Fort Irwin's National Training Center in the remote
Mojave desert.
   ``Now, back to the war,'' Bush said.
   ``We've never stopped a battle before to listen to the president
on the radio,'' joked Army Col. Michael Ryan, chief of plans and
operation.
   Bush, in his first remarks on changes proposed on Monday by
Gorbachev, said: ``I can speak for all Americans when I say we are
pleased to see chairman Gorbachev's proposals to expand steps
toward political pluralism in the Soviet Union.''
   ``It's especially encouraging to see anything which might bring
the day of true democracy a bit closer to the Soviet people.''
   From a ridge, Bush watched puffs of smoke emerging from tank
columns, saw bursts of artillery shells and saw planes sweeping low
to provide air cover over the desert valley floor.
   He watched as the team portraying a Soviet-style ``opposing
force'' smashed through the defending side's lines.
   Bush watched the simulated battle from Hill 781, his tie off, a
khaki jacket over his shirt, military binoculars around his neck.
His wife, Barbara, was nearby, wearing a colorful jogging suit.
   After his remarks, he heard the commander of the ``blue army''
from Fort Lewis, Wash., Col. A. J. Bergeron, tell him over a
television monitor, ``This for us is a training Super Bowl.''
   He said he was ``absolutely delighted'' that Bush came. However,
one of his men, 2nd Lt. Barry Hale, ``hit'' in the simulated
battle, said ruefully to reporters, ``We would have been great if
we hadn't been blocked from going around Hill 781. ... They called
it a chemically contaminated area.''
   Bush, in his formal remarks, said, ``It is important not to let
... encouraging changes, political or military, lull us into a
sense of complacency. Nor can we let down our guard against a
worldwide threat.''
   ``The Soviet Union still does maintain formidable forces,'' he
said.
   Bush said that the U.S. military would face ``its share of
uncertainties and danger'' in the years ahead, despite the current
easing of tensions.
   The president said his defense strategy is one of active forces
which are ``smaller but more agile and flexible,'' such as the
contingent sent to Panama in the raid against Gen. Manuel Antonio
Noriega.
   Later, in Los Angeles, the president again trumpeted his 1991
defense budget at a $1,000-a-plate fund-raising dinner for
California Republicans.
   ``As the nature of the threats to American security change, so
too must our response,'' Bush said. ``Our forces will remain
robust, well-trained, highly professional but geared to the new
array of challenges of the '90s.''
   Bush cited ``rapid and welcome change as people from Panama to
Prague strive for democracy.'' But he said the lessening of
East-West tensions should not lessen the military mission, only
refocus it.
   Switching subjects to fit his GOP audience, Bush lashed out at
``Democratic gerrymandering'' in California that he said had made
it hard in the past for Republicans to win House seats.
   Noting that new congressional district lines will be drawn after
this year's census, Bush declared ``the time has come for
redistricting reform.''
   Bush and other speakers was interrupted by five hecklers at
various times, three shouting something about El Salvador and two
something about AIDS. All were led from the room.
   After one interruption, Bush ad-libbed, ``Pretty tough.''
   Several hundred demonstrators paraded for a variety of causes
outside the hotel.
   The military-spending debate also includes an issue some have
portrayed as political: The Bush plan calls for closing or scaling
down 72 U.S. military installations, many of them in Democrats'
districts.
   In his war-games remarks, Bush declared: ``As we enter the
1990s, the United States is shaping its military to meet a changing
international environment, one that may be potentially safer; but
one that will almost surely have its share of uncertainties and
dangers.''
   He praised the Dec. 20, 1989 invasion of Panama that toppled
Noriega as an example of the kind of role he envisions for the
modern military.

<HEAD>Wright's Stuff: Industrial Artist Gets 1st Major Show 200 Years
After Death</HEAD>
<HEAD>By GRAHAM HEATHCOTE</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One artist grasped the importance of what was
happening in England in the 18th century when he chose scientific
demonstrations, iron forges and blacksmiths' shops for his
``peculiar'' subjects.
   Joseph Wright's first major show in London, opening today, comes
almost 200 years after his death.
   ``He deserved one before but this often happens in England,''
said Nicholas Serota, director of the Tate Gallery, at Tuesday's
preview.
   To avoid confusion with artists of the same name, Wright was
known in his lifetime as Wright of Derby, the Midlands town where
he was born and worked. He died in 1797 and the title has stuck
ever since.
   His most famous picture is of a group of people watching a
demonstrator pump air from a glass globe, causing a bird inside to
flutter in distress as it loses oxygen. The viewers react in
fascination or shock and one covers her eyes.
   A critic who saw it in 1768 wrote: ``Mr. Wright, of Derby, is a
very great and uncommon genius, in a peculiar way.''
   In those days, ``peculiar'' meant ``individual'' or ``unlike
others,'' says the exhibition organizer, Judy Egerton, who has
gathered about 200 works from around the world for the show.
   Two years earlier, Wright had shown another unique painting, of
a lecturer explaining the workings of an orrery, a clockwork model
of the solar system. His listeners, including two little boys, are
entranced and one man makes notes.
   There are no pictures like these anywhere else, art historians
say.
   The scene in each painting is illuminated by a candle lamp,
demonstrating Wright's mastery of light effects. His industrial
pictures show workers lit by the fires at which they work metals.
   Wright's scientific and industrial paintings won for him the
honor of being the first artist to directly express the spirit of
the industrial revolution.
   He was gripped by fire and light and returning in 1775 from a
visit to Italy he brought his paintings of the annual firework
display in Rome, the Girandola, and of a nighttime eruption of the
Vesuvius volcano.
   All these are in the Tate show along with many of the portraits,
by which Wright earned the bulk of his income.
   ``Wright fell into obscurity in the 19th century but in the
1920s he was appreciated by American collectors,'' Serota said.
   His paintings then rose in value. In 1984, London's National
Gallery paid $1.7 million at auction for his portrait, ``Mr. and
Mrs. Coltman.''
   Wright had charged Coltman 63 pounds for it in 1771, then the
equivalent of about $300.
   The ``Wright of Derby'' exhibition goes to Paris this summer and
to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York in the fall, the
first time the Tate has loaned a show to the Met, Serota added.
   ``Wright captures the excitement of scientific discovery,'' said
David Fraser, curator of Derby's museums.
   Derby Art Gallery has the largest collection of Wright's work
because its residents admired him and contributed in Victorian
times to the museum's purchase of his paintings.
   In the 1960s, the Derby church he was buried in was demolished
and its site now lies under a beltway. His remains were so
carelessly reburied in a local cemetery that no one now quite knows
where they are, the curator said.
   The exhibition is at the Tate Gallery through April 22, at the
Paris Grand Palais May 17 through July 23 and at the New York
Metropolitan Museum of Art Sept. 6 through Dec. 2.

<HEAD>Leona Helmsley Calls `Little People' Line a Lie</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Billionaire tax evader Leona Helmsley has denied
ever telling a housekeeper ``only the little people pay taxes,''
and predicts she will not go to prison because ``I've done
nothing.''
   In her first interview since her August conviction, Helmsley
told ``A Current Affair'' that the quote was ``an out and out lie.''
   ``This is the most ludicrous, ridiculous thing that ever
happened to me in my entire life. ...
   ``We paid a fortune in taxes and I sat down with a housekeeper,
and I said, `Do you know that only the little people pay taxes?'''
she said, her voice rising mockingly.
   ``This is nonsense,'' she told interviewer Cindy Adams, adding,
``Then I'm the little people. I'm the one paying the taxes. We paid
$344 million. ... I really don't know where it came from. But it
didn't come from this mouth.''
   The interview was taped at her Central Park South apartment on
Jan. 29. It will be broadcast nationally tonight and Thursday on
the Fox network.
   Helmsley, who was convicted of evading more than $1.2 million in
federal taxes between 1983 and 1985, was sentenced to four years in
prison and ordered to pay a $7.1 million fine and $1.7 million in
back taxes. She is free on $25 million bail, pending an appeal.
   Asked how she will survive if her appeal fails, Helmsley said,
``If I went to jail? I'm not going to jail. I've done nothing. I
can't believe ... that the system in the United States of America
has stopped working.''
   Several times during the interview, Helmsley tried to keep her
voice from cracking when talking about the trial and dabbed her
nose with a tissue when asked about her lawyer's assertion in court
that she was a ``tough bitch.''
   She said she may have cultivated that image by being tough on
her employees and said, ``If you pet me, I'll purr. But if you hit
me, I might scratch, of course.''
   The 69-year-old hotel magnate said she was ``terrified'' of what
was happening to her, adding, ``It's like being on a roller
coaster. You're just being pushed with no control whatsoever.''
   Since her trial, she said, she and her husband, Harry, ``don't
go anywhere,'' but added that when they do reporters are always
nearby.
   During a recent trip to Arizona, she said, ``there were
helicopters flying over the house'' and when they went to the beach
near their Sarasota, Fla., home ``there was a reporter lying on the
sand and he had his camera aimed at us. It's terribly unfair.''

   Khmer Rouge guerrillas have made
major gains since Vietnamese troops left in September and worry
grows that the movement, which ruled Cambodia with terror in the
late 1970s, may regain power.
   Guerrilla and Western officials say Khmer Rouge fighters have
overrun dozens of government positions, capturing a 250-mile
stretch of territory in northern and western Cambodia.
   They have closed many jungle camps on the Thai border and moved
tens of thousands of civilians and soldiers to the newly seized
areas, including the gem-mining district of Pailin in Battambang
province.
   Hundreds of thousands of Cambodians were executed or died of
disease or starvation while the Communist Khmer Rouge ruled
Cambodia from April 1975 until the Vietnamese invasion of December
1978 that overthrew Pol Pot's government.
   The Khmer Rouge says those days are gone, and it has changed.
   Mit Noly, a guerrilla major interviewed on a trip through the
region, said in the district capital of Tmar Puok: ``We are trying
to separate ourselves from the past. We are willing to accept the
will of the people.
   ``In 1982, we changed. Our struggle became one of national
liberation against the Vietnamese. Our policy is now one of
justice. We tell people that theft is wrong, that murder is wrong.''
   Western analysts say, however, that Pol Pot and others who
directed the massacres of the 1970s remain in control. There is
considerable documentation of continued human rights violations by
the Khmer Rouge in recent years.
   Thousands of civilians under Khmer Rouge control serve as
porters to move food, weapons and military supplies from border to
the new base camps, according to the reports by guerrilla and
Western officials.
   Ok Serie Sopheak of the non-Communist Khmer People's National
Liberation Front, another group fighting the Vietnam-sponsored
government of Premier Hun Sen: ``The Khmer Rouge have been very
successful on the battlefield. They now operate quite freely almost
everywhere in the country.''
   The tour of northwestern Cambodia sometimes involved traveling
in jeeps supplied by the Chinese, the Khmer Rouge's main
supporters, and eating in marketplaces.
   Khmer Rouge guerrillas could be seen in dozens of newly captured
villages, visiting relatives and mingling with villagers who went
about their regular work of the harvest season.
   Other guerrillas were en route to interior provinces such as
Kompong Thom, where they must operate far from the supply lines
leading from the Thai border.
   Analysts say that, despite its bloody record, the Khmer Rouge
has recruited thousands of fighters and continues to get some help
from villagers as its units move deeper inside Cambodia.
   ``They are seen by many as patriots,'' a senior Thai
intelligence officer said privately. ``In rural Cambodia, the
average villager is not nearly as opposed to the Khmer Rouge as the
international community.''
   Outside the country, the analysts say, the more the Khmer Rouge
wins on the battlefield, the more it loses diplomatically.
   After the Khmer Rouge seized its first district capital _
Pailin, in October _ several Western countries tried to isolate it,
fearful of a return to power.
   The Khmer Rouge is the strongest member of a three-party
resistance coalition that also includes the non-Communist forces of
Prince Norodom Sihanouk and the Khmer People's National Liberation
Front.
   Khmer Rouge guerrillas increased attacks after the Vietnamese
withdrawal in the last days of September and now control more 6,250
square miles in the north and west, according to Thai and Western
intelligence sources. Much of the area is sparsely populated.
   Since September, the Khmer Rouge has captured at least three
district capitals in Battambang and Siem Riep provinces. In
January, its guerrillas attacked Battambang's provincial capital,
also called Battambang.
   Thai intelligence officers close to Khmer Rouge leaders say the
plan is to to capture Battambang before monsoon rains start in
April. Battambang is Cambodia's second-largest city after Phnom
Penh, the capital.
   A Western diplomat in Bangkok said: ``They are cutting roads,
trying to isolate Battambang. If all supply lines can be cut, they
can seize the city.''
   According to intelligence sources, the Khmer Rouge recognizes
its increased isolation and is ready if China yields to
international pressure and cuts off aid.
   The guerrillas are reported to have arms and ammunition caches
throughout Cambodia. Western diplomats and ruby miners say the
Khmer Rouge collects the equivalent of more than $500,000 a month
in taxes from gem miners in Pailin, which the guerrillas captured
Oct. 22.
   ``If all international support stopped tommorrow, the Khmer
Rouge could fight for five more years,'' a Thai intelligence
officer said. ``If the Khmer Rouge are shut out of a peace
settlement, there will be no peace.''

   Authorities seized 17 tons of weapons from a
ship that had arrived from Europe and the United States and said
they were investigating to determine who was responsible for the
shipment.
   The attorney general's office showed reporters the haul, which
included 270 rifles, 4,988 cartridges, machine guns, pistols and
other firearms.
   ``Until now, we have not detained anyone because the shipment
was going to a dummy company called Super Comercial Agropecuaria
San Pablo,'' the attorney general's office said in a statement.
   The Mexican flag ship Sonora left Belgium on Dec. 5 and stopped
in the Netherlands, West Germany, France, Miami and Houston before
arriving in Veracruz on Jan. 27, the statement said.
   The weapons were in a container labeled as containing garbanzo
paste from Lebanon, the government said. The statement did not say
where the arms were loaded onto the ship.
   One spokesman for the attorney general's office said the weapons
could be destined for Mexican drug traffickers, while another
speculated that they were headed for another country.

   Rock singer Billy Idol suffered a badly
broken leg and fractured arm when he ran a stop sign on his
motorcycle and smashed into a car on a Hollywood street Tuesday,
police said.
   Idol, 34, underwent seven hours of surgery on his right leg and
left forearm, and was listed in serious but stable condition at
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center's intensive care unit late Tuesday.
   The rock star, who was not wearing a helmet, also suffered some
lacerations on the back of his head, said police Officer Don
Lawrence.
   Idol ran a stop sign at 8:30 a.m. while southbound on a street
and hit a car eastbound on another street, according to Lawrence.
The car's driver was not injured.
   The singer will be cited for failing to stop for a stop sign,
Lawrence said. Such a citation usually results in a fine.
   Idol was brought to the hospital at 9:10 a.m., said Cedars-Sinai
Medical Center spokesman Ron Wise.
   Idol suffered a compound fracture between the knee and ankle,
said Wise, who described the fracture as serious. Wise earlier said
the performer suffered a fractured wrist, but said later that
surgeons discovered the arm was broken.
   His publicist, Ellen Golden, knew only sketchy details of the
collision, which occurred after Idol wrapped up work on a new
album, ``Charmed Life,'' at a Hollywood studio and was riding home.
   She said she was initially told Idol was not at fault in the
crash. She said earlier that he was not intoxicated.
   Golden said it was not immediately known what impact, if any,
the accident would have on Idol's plans to begin work in three
weeks in director Oliver Stone's motion picture about the Doors
rock band.
   Idol was to play a close friend of the late lead singer Jim
Morrison, she said.
   It also was unknown whether Idol's plans to release ``Charmed
Life'' in late April and launch a concert tour in July would be
affected, Golden said.
   Idol _ with his blond spiked hair, tight leather garb and curled
lip _ personifies the bad boy rock 'n' roll image. He is best known
for his 1984 album ``Rebel Yell,'' which produced the hit songs
``Eyes Without a Face,'' ``White Wedding'' and ``Rebel Yell.''
   He followed his ``Rebel Yell'' success with the ``Whiplash
Smile'' in 1987, which produced the hit singles ``To Be a Lover''
and ``Sweet Sixteen.''
   He also had hits with ``Dancing with Myself'' and ``Mony Mony''
off his first album, ``Don't Stop.''
   Idol was most recently seen as part of the Who's ``Tommy'' tour.

   Mayor Rodger Randle took three-fourths of
the vote in a Democratic primary Tuesday, pitting him against
Republican state Rep. Frank Pitezel in his bid for a second term.
   Voters also narrowed the number of city council candidates from
72 to 20 in the city's first step toward replacing its 82-year-old
commission form of government.
   Randle, who'll meet Pitezel in a general election April 3,
received 17,662 votes, or 75 percent, to 4,332, or 18 percent, for
Joe Williams, president of the local chapter of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Virginia Jenner
garnered 1,064 ballots, or 4 percent, and Guilford Escue had 624,
or 3 percent.
   Pitezel easily won the GOP primary with 11,661 votes, or 63
percent, to 2,234, or 12 percent, for Reba Yeskavich, and 1,552, or
8 percent for Andrew Harriman.
   Tulsa has had a commission form of government since 1908. City
residents last year approved changing Tulsa's charter to replace
commissioners with a council representing nine districts in an
effort to regain neighborhood representation.
   That drew a flood of candidates for city posts with backgrounds
ranging from dishwashers to ministers and bank executives.
   Under the new form of government, the mayor will be the city's
chief administrator responsible for overseeing all city operations
and appointing 16 department heads.
   The charter change also increased the mayor's term from two
years to four. The nine council members will serve two-year terms.

<TEXT>
   A bill on today's state Senate agenda
calls for the sterilization of a person who falls a year behind in
child support payments.
   The legislation being introduced by Sen. Charlotte Pritt, a
Democrat, calls for a court to find the offender in contempt before
ordering the sterilization.
   ``I think we need to have a discussion in the subcommittee about
it,'' said Pritt, a 41-year-old school teacher and leading abortion
rights advocate in the Senate. ``The whole thing is a legitimate
area for discussion.''
   Pritt also introduced a bill that calls for a physician who is
counseling a woman about tubal ligation to counsel her husband on
vasectomies.
   Her third bill would require a spouse's written consent before a
man could obtain a vasectomy.
   ``Notice is not required if the performance of the vasectomy is
necessary to save the man's life,'' the bill said.

   When porn queen Annie Sprinkle performed her
stage show, members of the audience might have thought they saw
art. But when Rep. Dana Rohrabacher heard about it, he saw red.
   ``The National Endowment for the Arts is at it Again!'' the
conservative California Republican exclaimed in the headline over a
letter to his House colleagues accusing the federal arts agency of
using tax funds to subsidize pornography.
   Endowment Chairman John E. Frohnmayer says his agency didn't
underwrite Miss Sprinkle's sexually explicit show at the Kitchen, a
private, avant-garde performing arts center in lower Manhattan. He
said the endowment gave the Kitchen $60,000 last year solely for
the theater's operating expenses.
   Rohrabacher didn't actually see Miss Sprinkle perform but relied
on press reports for the lurid details.
   During one breathless pause in her act, Rohrabacher said, the
star of 150 X-rated videos commented: ``Usually I get paid a lot of
money for this, but tonight it's government-funded.''
   The program for the show included a ``Post Porn Modernist
Manifesto'' that said its adherents ``celebrate sex as the
nourishing life giving force'' and ``utilize sexually explicit
words, pictures and performances to communicate our ideas and
emotions.''
   Rohrabacher urged his fellow House members to remind Frohnmayer
``he is dealing with taxpayer funds and is accountable for how they
are spent, just like every other head of every other federal
agency.''
   ``If the NEA can't hold itself responsible to the U.S. taxpayer,
it's our job to make them responsible,'' he said.
   Barbara Tsumagari, executive director of the Kitchen, said in
New York that Miss Sprinkle's 12 performances were not financed
with federal funds.
   Ms. Tsumagari said the New York State Council on the Arts, which
receives funds from the NEA, gave a $25,000 grant to underwrite
part of the Kitchen's current season of 54 performances, but
specifically excluded Miss Sprinkle's show.
   That was confirmed by state arts council spokesman Tim Mulligan,
who said her ``presentation was not of an artistic quality to
warrant council support.''
   Frohnmayer, in a telephone interview, said the NEA gave the New
York arts council a $500,000 grant last year for staff salaries and
other administrative expenses.
   Rohrabacher's press secretary, David Eisner, said the
congressman plans to circulate similar letters about every week to
highlight further examples of what Eisner called the endowment's
``use of tax dollars for triple-X, hard-core pornographic stuff.''
   Eisner said NEA supporters dismiss such reports as ``isolated
incidents,'' but ``we are starting a campaign to really work hard
to show that's not the case. This is a systemic problem.''
   Rohrabacher's campaign could prove politically embarrassing to
Frohnmayer as the House and Senate prepare for hearings on
legislation authorizing an extension of the NEA's life.
   Last October, a controversy over endowment support for a
traveling exhibition of photographs by Robert Mapplethorpe _
including some sexually explicit photos _ led Congress to include a
ban on federal funds for ``obscene'' art in the NEA's $171 million
budget. A Rohrabacher proposal to abolish the arts endowment was
rejected.
   ``I don't intend to rise to the bait any time someone comes up
with a new horror story,'' Frohnmayer said Tuesday.
   ``I want to make it very clear that we do not fund anything that
is obscene and, in fact, my view is that art and obscenity are
mutually exclusive terms,'' he said. ``I think those who oppose
obscenity _ and I count myself among them _ might more fruitfully
look elsewhere.''

<HEAD>Bush Economic Report Replays Many Reagan Hits</HEAD>

   The dogma may be toned down a bit, but in many
respects President Bush's first annual report on the state of the
U.S. economy could just as easily have been former President
Reagan's ninth.
   When Bush sent Congress his 419-page epistle on the economy
Tuesday, all the hits from yesteryear were playing once again:
   _Tax cuts to stimulate growth.
   _Balanced budgets down the road just a bit, accomplished without
the need for higher taxes.
   _Promises of economic growth as far as the eye can see.
   Just as they did with Reagan's economic outlooks, the critics
griped about overly optimistic economic forecasts and accused the
Republicans of promoting tax cuts for the wealthy in the guise of
boosting investment.
   They charged Bush failed to note the biggest policy failures of
the Reagan era _ the mountain of federal debt and the huge trade
deficits which have transformed America from the world's largest
creditor country to the largest debtor nation.
   Bush officials, meanwhile, complained the critics ignored the
Reagan era's successes, including an unprecedented seven straight
years of peacetime economic growth and the creation of more than 20
million jobs, while inflation was kept under control.
   This economic debate, which raged for all of Reagan's two terms,
likely will continue for some time to come.
   Democrats aimed much of their fire Tuesday at Bush's tax
proposals. His economic report repeated his call for a capital
gains tax cut and a new Family Savings Account to let Americans put
away up to $5,000 a year in tax-free savings accounts.
   The critics called the capital gains tax cut a giveaway to the
wealthy and said the savings plan would not boost Americans' dismal
savings rate any more than similar plans advanced during the Reagan
years.
   ``Tinkering with the tax code is the worst thing we could do.
This is just gimmickry that we are going to suffer for in the long
run,'' complained Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill. and chairman of the
House Ways and Means Committee.
   Bush's first ``Economic Report of the President'' did offer some
subtle changes by avoiding some of the more doctrinaire monetary
and supply-side economic positions sounded during the Reagan years.
   In a departure from the monetarist leanings of Reagan
economists, Bush's report warned against relying on ``rigid
monetary targeting,'' in which the central bank focuses solely on
controlling the growth of the nation's money supply to hold down
inflation.
   Bush's report gave general approval to the Fed's work under
Chairman Alan Greenspan, saying the central bank was correct in
using a variety of economic barometers to direct interest rate
policies.
   Bush extolled the benefits of free markets and open world trade,
while proclaiming ``the primary economic goal of my administration
is to achieve the highest possible rate of sustainable economic
growth. Growth is the key to raising living standards, to leaving a
legacy of prosperity for our children, to uplifting those most in
need and to maintaining America's leadership in the world.''
   Asked to explain the differences between Reagan and Bush on
economic issues, Michael Boskin, Bush's chief economic adviser,
suggested the primary difference lies in the two men's views of
government.
   ``I think that President Reagan believed that not only was the
government the problem, but that it was rare indeed that government
could be a positive force in solving the problem,'' Boskin said.
   Bush is more willing to use government to solve problems in such
fields as promoting long-term research, fighting illegal drugs or
boosting support for the Head Start preschool program, Boskin said,
adding that Bush ``does believe in some areas the federal
government has an important role to play.''

Road</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush will spend a good part of this
election year traveling about, mixing politics with war. And with
peace. And maybe with the environment, education, crime and the
battle against drugs as well.
   Any time Bush mixes a political appearance with an ``official''
presidential event, it reduces the amount the Republican Party must
pay for his appearance.
   In this congressional election year, people can expect to see
Bush making plenty of stops combining political and non-political
events.
   Some critics see the tactic as a partial taxpayer subsidy for
political activity. In any event, Bush is not the first president
to do it, nor likely to be the last.
   This week's three-state swing, focusing on national defense
issues, is a good example of mixing the business of politics with
the nation's business.
   On Tuesday, Bush's first stop in Southern California was to
watch Army war games in the Mojave Desert and to talk to U.S.
troops.
   Afterward he came to Los Angeles for an evening $1,000-a-plate
GOP fundraiser for Sen. Pete Wilson, who is running for governor of
California.
   Election law requires political parties or candidates to pay for
purely political visits by a president _ and the cost of moving a
president and his entourage can be quite high.
   Thus, the fact that Bush had an official event in the same state
as the fundraiser means taxpayers will bear some of the cost of the
visit, on a pro-rated basis.
   Further official stops today _ a foreign policy speech in San
Francisco and a tour of a laboratory where Star Wars research is
done _ will also trim the cost to California Republicans for
getting Bush to the Wilson fundraiser.
   On Thursday, Bush will combine a visit to the Strategic Air
Command Headquarters in Omaha, Neb., with a fundraising breakfast
for Nebraska's Republican Gov. Kay Orr. The SAC tour will help
defray the cost to the Nebraska GOP.
   Then, before returning to Washington, he will tour a Head Start
center in Colombus, Ohio. The political twin? An Ohio GOP dinner.
   ``This should be a very good trip, emphasizing some of our
defense requirements, needs. And a little politics mixed in here,''
Bush told reporters accompanying him aboard Air Force One. ``We'll
be doing more of that this year.''
   ``It raises a serious question about abuse of taxpayer funds,''
said Ellen Miller, director of the Center for Responsive Politics
in Washington D.C., a private organization that studies the role of
money in politics.
   She said the key is whether the president would have made the
trip anyway without the political event _ or whether the official
appearances were just added to generate a partial taxpayer subsidy
for a political visit.
   Not surprisingly, White House spokeswoman Alixe Glen says the
official business, not the political stops, pace the president's
schedule.
   ``He goes on trips to get his message out,'' she said. But she
added, ``on the flip side, the president is very committed to the
Republican Party.''
   Bush, a former national GOP chairman, started combining
presidential business with politics early on. Last fall he combined
a fundraising speech for Rep. Lynn Martin, R-Ill., a 1990 Senate
candidate, with a trip to a Chicago inner-city school where he
talked about drugs.
   Earlier this year, he mixed an appearance at a glitzy Miami
hotel fundraiser for Florida Gov. Bob Martinez with a meeting with
a group of sixth graders in Everglades National Park.
   Would Bush have made the ``official'' trip to the Everglades in
the absence of the Miami fundraiser? Doubtful, claims Bob Dreyfus
of Public Citizen, a watchdog group set up by consumer advocate
Ralph Nader.
   Dreyfus says the practice of scheduling official visits to help
defray the costs of political visits is ``a flagrant abuse'' of the
public trust.
   But many political veterans see it as a legitimate way to
exercise the powers of the presidency.
   Stephen Hess, a political analyst at the Brookings Institution
in Washington, said, ``the president is both president of all and
at the same time, the titular elder of his party. It's sometimes
hard to balance those two conflicting interests.''
   ``I don't think it's all bad,'' Hess added. ``I must say, if a
president has nothing better to do, it's useful for him to get
around the country and meet the people up close.''

<HEAD>Cheney Defense Higher Spending for Strategic Force</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Democrats are attacking the Bush
administration's belief that the United States must keep paying to
upgrade its strategic force until new U.S.-Soviet arms control
treaties are completed.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, defending his $292 billion
military budget for fiscal 1991, said Tuesday the dramatic changes
of pro-democracy movements in Eastern Europe and the diminishing
Soviet threat to the West ``are, in fact, reflected in the budget.''
   President Bush's proposed budget for the fiscal year beginning
Oct. 1 calls for a nearly $1 billion increase in spending on the
Strategic Defense Initiative, $5.5 billion for the B-2 stealth
bomber and more than $3 billion on two new long-range nuclear
missiles.
   The defense secretary told the House Armed Services Committee
``a good deal of prudence is in order.''
   Cheney argued no major cuts in spending or changes in defense
strategy should be considered until new arms control treaties are
completed.
   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of Armed Services panel, said
the administration appeared to be trying to use the arms control
process to justify building both the mobile MX and the smaller
Midgetman missile systems, as well as the B-2 bomber.
   ``There is old thinking in strategic arms control,'' Aspin said,
adding the administration should not be seeking to build the MX and
Midgetman just because they would be permitted under terms of the
emerging Strategic Arms Reduction Talks treaty to reduce both
superpowers' strategic arsenals by up to 50 percent.
   ``You stand logic on its head when you use arms control as an
argument for a larger defense budget,'' Aspin said.
   Under questioning by Aspin, Gen. Colin Powell, the chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the service chiefs would reconsider
their support for the proposed START treaty if Congress decided to
kill either the MX or Midgetman programs and if the B-2 bomber
program were canceled.
   Powell said he personally ``would have to make a very careful
reassessment of the START treaty'' if the B-2 program were killed.
   Aspin said Congress may not accept the administration's request
to buy five B-2s in fiscal 1991, and a bipartisan group of
congressmen introduced legislation to kill the bomber program.
   ``It is as relevant to modern nuclear warfare a the Polish
cavalry was to German tanks in 1939,'' said Rep. Ron Dellums,
D-Calif., a member of the Armed Services panel. ``It could only
effectively be employed after nuclear annihilation had already
occurred.''
   Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, another panel member, said ``cheaper,
but just as effective, alternatives to the stealth'' are available,
including cruise missiles that could be fired outside an enemy's
borders.
   The bill would allow completion of the 15 planes now in
production. The Pentagon plans to build 132 planes at a cost of
about $70 billion, including more than $23 billion that has already
been spent.
   Cheney's proposal to close or realign more than 72 domestic
military facilities and 14 foreign bases prompted charges of
partisanship from Aspin, who proposed that an independent
commission determine the hit list of bases.
   ``You want to work together we'll close some bases, but it's
going to have to be a commission,'' said Aspin.
   ``I wonder, Mr. Chairman, if you would have been as eager to
hold a press conference to introduce your new ... commission
legislation if I had not started with a list,'' Cheney said.
   Aspin rejoined: ``Cheney, you got to play this thing a little
less confrontational if you want it to happen.''

   In a report harshly critical of the Bush
administration's policies toward China, the human rights group Asia
Watch says repression of Chinese dissenters is deepening despite
the lifting of martial law.
   The findings, largely mirroring a still-confidential State
Department report on human rights violations in China, come as
Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger was appearing today
before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to defend the
administration's China policy.
   Some in Congress believe the evidence of Chinese repression
makes it even more difficult for Bush to defend his current efforts
at rapprochement, just eight months after the brutal crushing of
the pro-democracy movement.
   Eagleburger has been at the center of Bush's secret
policymaking, traveling on two clandestine trips to China with
national security adviser Brent Scowcroft in the months since the
crackdown.
   The administration, since the massacre of hundreds and perhaps
thousands of protesters in Beijing last June 4, ``has reverted ...
to a shabby double standard insofar as the question of human rights
in China is concerned,'' the Asia Watch report concluded.
   The 89-page document, based largely on press reports, catalogs
continuing arrests of peaceful dissidents, secret trials of
protesters, new executions and death sentences and government use
of torture against political opponents.
   It also adds a layer of criticism, calling Bush's reluctance to
anger the rulers in Beijing a ``shamefully supine policy'' and
concludes: ``The burden of trying to shape a policy that reflects
concern for human rights still rests largely on the Congress.''
   Sources have said the State Department report, which has been
sent to Capitol Hill but not publicly released, offers a
matter-of-fact recitation of abuses by the Beijing government
throughout 1989, including terming the June 4 Tiananmen Square
killings a ``massacre.''
   It describes the government of Deng Xiaoping as a totalitarian
regime that has tightened its grip on information and throttled
opposing ideologies while restricting foreign travel and
suppressing labor and religious groups, sources said.
   The Asia Watch report said between 10,000 and 30,000 people
remain jailed because of pro-democracy activities. ``The recent
lifting of martial law in Beijing ... has little significance if
viewed as anything other than a public relations exercise,'' the
report contends.
   ``Arrests have continued, largely in secret, right through to
the present,'' and reports of continued executions persist, the
report said. Most of those detained have not been charged or tried,
and their families are not told where the prisoners are being held,
it said.
   When they are tried, ``verdicts are usually decided upon before
the trial even begins,'' it said. Torture of prisoners is common,
and at least 40 people have been executed in connection with the
events of last June, it added.
   ``China's criminal justice system is among the most deeply
flawed in the world,'' the report said. ``Indeed, it is essentially
pre-modern.''
   ``To sum up,'' it said, ``the continuing arrests and executions
in China form the cutting edge of a protracted, government-led
campaign of punitive repression, and they serve a purely political
purpose.''

<HEAD>Blind Lobby for Bill to Ban Seating Limitations on Airliners</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Scores of blind people are lobbying Congress
to overturn a proposed Federal Aviation Administration rule that
would bar them from seats next to emergency exits in airliners.
   The blind say they have the same rights as anyone else to sit by
the exit door.
   The FAA, which has not yet announced its final rule, is
proposing the seats be unavailable to blind people or anyone else
who might not be able to operate the doors quickly or lead other
passengers to safety.
   More than 150 blind people crowded a hallway outside a
congressional news conference Tuesday to protest the FAA proposal
which they predicted soon would become final. Using seeing-eye dogs
and white canes, they then spread through congressional office
buildings to lobby for the legislation.
   The FAA proposed last March to prohibit blind or deaf passengers
or passengers who might inhibit the use of an airliner emergency
door from sitting in the exit row seats. The agency called the
matter ``a critical safety issue'' and said the rule would enhance
the safety of all passengers.
   FAA spokesman Dick Stafford said the agency is in the final
rule-making procedure, which means it still could impose the rule
as proposed, modify it or withdraw it.
   Bob Marx, Transportation Department spokesman, said the
department is expected to issue next month an access rule that
would not preclude the FAA from imposing safety restrictions on
seating.
   Leaders of the National Federation of the Blind said the
government actions would be discriminatory and decrease a blind
person's chances of surviving an airplane crash. Some airlines
already prohibit blind travelers from sitting in exit-door seats
and several blind people have been arrested in recent years for
refusing to move from the seats.
   A half-dozen members of Congress expressed support for bills
that would ban rules to bar passengers from certain based on
whether the passenger can see. The measure has passed a Senate
committee.
   ``Blind people must not be treated as second-class citizens and
pushed to the back of the bus,'' said Rep. James Traficant, D-Ohio,
chief sponsor of a bill in the House. He said there is no evidence
to show that blind people pose any kind of safety hazard when
sitting next to airline exit doors.
   James Gashel, government affairs director for the blind
federation, said a sightless passenger's ability to maneuver in a
smoke-filled or darkened airliner might actually enhance safety if
he or she is in a position to lead other passengers.
   Gashel said the FAA rule would give blind people ``more of a
chance to die.''
   Gashel told of his own arrest in April 1988 after he refused to
leave an exit row seat on a United Airlines plane. More than 200
other passengers were evacuated, the flight was canceled and he was
carried off the aircraft by police, but no charges were filed, he
said.
   Other blind people have been arrested after refusing to leave
seats. Airline rules on the seats differ, with some barring
pregnant women and handicapped people, and others allowing
handicapped people to use the seats if they insist.

<HEAD>Administration Seeks Flexibility in Crop Programs</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Farm Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration's ``flexibility'' plan
for farmers calls for reviving the NCA to use with the ARP and ARC,
says the USDA.
   In that way, Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter said Tuesday,
farmers would have more choices in planting crops without being
penalized.
   Farmers often complain that Agriculture Department rules to
control production are too severe and often penalize them for not
following complicated program regulations straight down the line.
   Wheat farmers must abide by rules in the wheat program. Feed
grains producers following feed grains regulations, and so on. If
there is deviation, the acreage base or history of a crop may be
reduced, thereby meaning reduced USDA payments and other benefits.
   Current law passed in 1985 expires at the end of the 1990 crop
season. It generally denies program benefits if farmers harvest
crops other than the ``program'' crop for which they have a base
acreage.
   A change in the strict rules is being sought by the
administration and many farm groups and members of Congress.
   The American Farm Bureau Federation favors acreage flexibility,
with a couple of stipulations of its own. And the National Farmers
Union, which is often at odds with the administration on farm
policy, also likes the idea but wants to study the fine print on
the administration's plan.
   Yeutter explained the administration's version of flexibility at
a news conference. It's not exactly a new idea, he said.
   Here's how it might work:
   Each farm is assigned a normal crop acreage, or NCA, which is
the total acreage bases of program crops such as wheat, feed
grains, upland and extra-long staple cotton. Plus a farm's
historical plantings of oilseeds: soybeans, sunflowers and
rapeseed, including canola.
   As it does now, the USDA would determine each year whether to
apply individual crop ``acreage reduction programs'' called ARPs,
if necessary, to each crop's base acreage. If so, a percentage of
the farm's base _ with the exception of oilseed acres _ must be
idled as an ``acreage conservation reserve,'' or ACR.
   To qualify for price supports and other program benefits, the
farmer must comply with the ARP requirement for that crop. In
addition, the sum of all NCA-crop plantings, plus land idled under
the acreage reduction programs, cannot exceed the NCA for the
individual farm.
   In return, the farmer is allowed some flexibility without losing
benefits or suffering penalties on the farm's acreage base.
   ``We're proposing that we would establish ARPs, acreage
reduction programs, on a crop-by-crop basis, just as we do now,''
Yeutter said. ``In other words, there'll be a wheat ARP and a corn,
or a feed grains ARP, and a rice ARP, whatever it may be.''
   Basically, on the rest of the acreage, the farmer will be able
to grow any of the so-called program crops, plus any of the oilseed
crops, he said.
   ``It's really what I would call a modified NCA program ... as
the NCA existed back in the '70s or thereabouts,'' Yeutter said.
   In an example, a 300-acre farm included a 100-acre wheat base, a
100-acre corn base, and 100 acres of soybeans. The mythical wheat
program included a 5 percent ARP and the corn program a 10 percent
ARP.
   ``That means the farmer has to pull out 5 acres of land for his
wheat ARP, 10 acres for his corn ARP, and then under present law,
that means he'll plant 95 acres of wheat and he'll plant 90 acres
of corn,'' Yeutter said. ``And then on the other 100 acres he'll
grow soybeans or whatever.''
   Shifting to ``the simplest example'' of flexibility as proposed
in the administration plan, Yeutter said the ARPs would be the same
_ five acres of wheat and 10 acres of corn.
   But on the remaining 285 acres, Yeutter said the farmer would be
allowed to grow wheat, corn, any of the oilseeds, rice, cotton or
whatever.
   ``And he can plant that in any proportions he wishes,'' Yeutter
said. ``If he wants to plant it all to wheat, he can plant it all
to wheat. If he wants to plant it all to corn, he can plant it all
to corn.''
   Yeutter described several variations of the plan in which the
300-acre farmer could plant certain crops on his set-aside acres,
provided his acres eligible for payments are reduced accordingly.
   Oilseeds and experimental crops such as kenaf used for newsprint
are among the options under the flexibility plan, he said.

   Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter says the
nation's environment would benefit if planting rules in the
government's commodity programs were made more flexible.
   By requiring only basic cropland set-asides under a ``normal
crop acreage'' arrangement, farmers generally would be free to
plant whatever they choose on the remaining acreage without
penalties, Yeutter said Tuesday.
   Yeutter said the flexibility plan would ``permit crop rotations
or facilitate and foster crop rotations which are very difficult to
carry out'' under current, more rigid farm program regulations.
   ``The rigidities that exist today discourage the kinds of
rotation practices that were often followed in past year,'' he
said. ``One pays a very significant price in shifting from one
program crop to another today because it affects deficiency
payments (subsidies).''
   Yeutter added: ``Under this program, those kinds of shifts can
be undertaken much more readily and it would not be difficult under
our flexibility provisions to carry out the kind of rotation _
multi-year rotation _ that is often suggested by people who are
engaging in low-input, sustainable agricultural research.''

   A hearing on a proposal to close an exhibit
of skeletal remains of prehistoric Indians at a museum turned into
a noisy display of emotions among opposing factions Tuesday.
   Indians in headgear, beads and feathers showed up from half a
dozen states to urge that the display be closed.
   ``Their bodies need to be reburied to let their spirits continue
on their journey,'' said Jerry Bear Shield of Wounded Knee, S.D.
   One Indian punctuated the hearing with drum beats when speakers
said things he liked.
   Others among the 400 people in attendance repeatedly shouted and
applauded through the hearing.
   State Rep. David Leitch of Peoria, said he objected to closing
the exhibit at the Dickson Mounds museum.
   ``We're not talking about a peep-show here,'' he told the crowd.
``These remains can't be traced to any existing tribe or group of
people. Each of us can share in their history and culture.''
   Michael Haney, of Seminole, Okla., said he came to the hearing
with petitions signed by 250,000 Indians from 26 tribes opposing
the exhibit.
   ``We demand that the remains of our ancestors be taken off
display,'' he said. Haney threatened to set up picket lines at the
museum if the exhibit is not closed on the proposed date of Feb. 15.
   The hearing was held to gauge grass-roots reaction to the
decision by Gov. James R. Thompson's administration to close the
site.
   The Illinois Department of Energy and Natural Resources, which
runs the museum, announced plans last month to close the exhibit,
citing growing sensitivity to the public display of human remains.
   Similar exhibits in Kansas, Alabama and Kentucky have been
closed or will be shut down in deference to American Indian groups
who objected to the displays.
   The exhibit of exposed graves in an excavated Indian burial
ground is the centerpiece of the Dickson Mounds museum near
Lewistown, 35 miles southwest of Peoria.
   The museum, one of the only ancient Indian burial plots open to
public view, attracts about 80,000 visitors each year.
   When the natural resources agency decided to close the exhibit
effective Feb. 1, with Thompson's approval, there was an outcry
from lawmakers who contended the move would cripple the museum's
drawing power and educational value.
   The state House of Representatives approved a non-binding
resolution that opposed closing the exhibit and called for public
hearings on the proposal.
   The hearing and original closing date were postponed by a
snowstorm in late January.
   Attorney General Neil Hartigan, a candidate for the Democratic
nomination for governor, has criticized Thompson for agreeing to
close the museum, complaining that Illinois children should not be
denied access to their past.
   Spokesmen for the governor have labeled Hartigan a political
opportunist and questioned his sincerity.
   The museum was opened in 1927 after an amateur archeologist, Don
Dickson, unearthed the remains of 237 people who lived in the
Illinois River Valley 800 to 1,000 years ago.
   It was privately operated until 1945, when it was purchased by
the state and turned into a public museum.

<HEAD>Senator Protests Proposed Cut to Seniors Jobs Program</HEAD>

   The Bush administration's proposed $14 million
cut in a jobs program for elderly Americans will prevent 10,000
needy senior citizens from receiving help, a Senate chairman says.
   Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, who heads the Senate Appropriations
subcommittee that oversees funding for the Labor Department,
complained Tuesday of the agency's plan to scale back the jobs
program.
   Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole, who testified on the
department's $26.3 billion budget, said the administration chose to
cut the program because of the nation's tight financial situation.
   Under the program, older citizens are placed in community
service jobs such as in hospitals, schools and libraries. The jobs
usually pay minimum wage.
   ``It's a great employment opportunity that keeps elderly
Americans off welfare and gives them some respect, some dignity,''
Harkin said. ``This is one cut that just does not make sense.''
   President Bush's budget proposes $343 million be spent on the
program in the 1991 budget year; it got $357 million in the current
fiscal year.
   ``It's a result of the budget constraints. I wish that it did
not have to be so,'' Mrs. Dole said.
   Harkin, noting the hourly minimum wage is set to increase from
$3.35 to $4.25 next year, said the program's funding would also
have to increase to employ the same number of Americans in 1991.
   He suggested funding be restored through the supplemental
appropriations process to account for the minimum wage difference,
but Mrs. Dole said that process should be reserved for ``dire
emergencies.''
   ``Dire emergency is in the eye of the beholder,'' Harkin said.
Many participants in his home state had lost their farms and the
community service jobs helped them ``through a period of time to
something else.''
   On another issue, Mrs. Dole said the department's proposed
$252.6 million increase for new youth job training programs would
help an estimated 683,000 of the nation's ``most at-risk youth.''
   ``If we're going to remain competitive in a global market, we
must address ourselves to this skills gap and a motivational gap
that exists in many areas as well,'' Mrs. Dole said.
   She said the department was working on ways to help high school
students make the transition to the workforce, since many students
now get out of school and ``kick around for a couple of years
trying to find the right spot.''
   Many senators praised the labor secretary for her role in
bringing about a tentative settlement in the Pittston-United Mine
Workers strike, but she again found herself explaining the
government's hands-off approach at Eastern Air Lines, where
machinists remain on strike.
   ``I think you always have to go case by case,'' Mrs. Dole said,
citing different federal labor laws that govern the transportation
industry. She also said the airline strike was not causing an
emergency in the travel industry.
   ``This was not the kind of situation that would tie up
transportation in a section of the country,'' she said.

<HEAD>Police Groups Join in Asking for Assault Weapon Limits</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Law enforcement organizations are joining
forces with gun control crusader Sarah Brady and religious and
professional groups in urging quick Senate action to ban specified
semiautomatic assault weapons.
   ``Drug traffickers are increasingly utilizing `assault weapons'
to assist and protect them in the selling of death and
destruction,'' Baltimore Police Chief Cornelius J. Behan, firearms
chairman of the International Association of Chiefs of Police, said
Tuesday.
   Behan and others appeared at a news conference with Mrs. Brady,
whose husband, former presidential press secretary James Brady, was
wounded in an assassination attempt on former President Reagan in
1981.
   ``This is the first time these fine groups have gathered
together to speak out for sensible gun laws,'' said Mrs. Brady, who
heads Handgun Control, Inc. ``But I'm angry that we have to be here
at all.''
   She said backers of the legislation were told it would be
considered by the Senate this week, but it now appeared it might be
put off until after the February congressional recess. Congress is
to recess Friday for Lincoln's Birthday and return Feb. 19.
   The bill would impose a three-year ban on the sale, transport
and possession of the semiautomatic weapons. Penalties include a
mandatory 10 years in prison for use of a semiautomatic assault
weapon in the commission of a drug trafficking or violent crime.
   ``We cannot begin to curb crime and the epidemic of random
violence which plagues our cities while we continue to legitimize
the wholesale arming of ordinary citizens, including the mentally
defective and the street gangs,'' said Rabbi Lynne Landsberg,
assistant director of the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism.
   The National Rifle Association opposes the bill, saying the
restrictions would apply to guns used for hunting.
   But Warren Eisenberg, director of the International Council of
B'nai B'rith, said his organization does not believe the bill would
``interfere with the legitimate activities of sportsmen.''
   ``In an age when hate criminals and narcoterrorists use assault
weapons to commit their crimes, it is ridiculous to try to defend
certain categories of domestic and imported weapons as sporting
equipment,'' Eisenberg said.
   Robert Z. Alpern, director of the Washington office of the
Unitarian Universalist Association, said the bill ``would be a
small step toward limiting the supply of semiautomatic weapons that
have taken an unconscionable toll of human lives and terrorized our
nation.''
   ``Assault weapons are a life and death issue to police
officers,'' said Sgt. William Pattison of Nassau County, N.Y.,
executive vice president of the National Association of Police
Organizations. ``The police officers of this country are at war to
reclaim our streets. We must end the maiming and killing of our
children, our citizens and our police officers.''
   Spokesmen for the American Bar Association, American Medical
Association and American Federation of Teachers, AFL-CIO, also
supported the bill.

<HEAD>North's Lawyers Press for Line-by-Line Judgement on Iran-Contra
Testimony</HEAD>

   Oliver North's lawyers say a ``line-by-line''
review of testimony from every witness should have been made to
ensure the former White House aide's case was untainted by
immunized congressional testimony.
   Defense attorney Barry Simon made the argument Tuesday in urging
a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals to overturn
North's convictions in the Iran-Contra scandal.
   Appeals Judge Patricia Wald asked whether Simon was urging that
``every line'' of testimony be scrutinized to determine whether its
origin was independent of North's immunized statements in 1987 on
national television.
   ``We believe that is what it requires,'' Simon said of the 1972
Supreme Court ruling declaring that prosecutors must show that none
of their case comes from a defendant's previously immunized
testimony.
   ``We would have gone through trial testimony line by line,''
Simon added.
   Simon also argued former President Reagan should have been
called as a witness at North's trial.
   ``Frankly, I don't see how his testimony could not have been
relevant,'' said Simon.
   North was convicted May 4 of aiding and abetting an obstruction
of Congress, altering and destroying National Security Council
documents and accepting an illegal gratuity.
   North's defense to the first two convictions is that all his
activities were authorized by his superiors, including
then-national security adviser John Poindexter and Reagan.
   Government attorney Gerard Lynch said North's own testimony at
his trial was that ``he never met alone'' with Reagan and that
North ``never said the president told him to do anything.''
   But appeals judge Laurence Silberman said that even if Reagan
didn't give specific authorization, the ex-president's testimony
could have been helpful to North.
   ``Suppose the ex-president says that `I never gave specific
authorization' (but) `I did indicate that I didn't wish this
information to be revealed,''' said Silberman.
   During nearly 2{ hours of arguments, Silberman also noted
Reagan's written answers to questions in the Iran-Contra affair
were submitted to a grand jury but were never provided to North's
lawyers.
   ``Why as a matter of basic fairness'' weren't Reagan's answers
turned over to North? asked Silberman.
   Lynch said the judgment was made that Reagan's written answers
would not have been helpful to North.
   ``But our system'' of justice, said Silberman, is based on a
defendant getting a wide latitude in obtaining information for his
defense.
   Silberman said, ``what troubles me is we don't have a very good
idea of what the president'' would testify had he been called as a
witness at North's trial, indicating Reagan's still-secret written
answers in the Iran-Contra scandal were general in nature.
   If North had worked in the State Department and Reagan had been
secretary of state, Reagan would certainly have been called to
testify, said Silberman.
   Wald is a Carter administration appointee. Silberman and David
Sentelle, the third member of the panel that will decide North's
appeal, were appointed by Reagan.

<HEAD>FDA Says States, Farmers Must Keep Drugs Out of Milk</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration says it
cannot bear the sole responsibility for ensuring the nation's milk
supply is safe from veterinary drugs that may be harmful to humans.
   ``We know that traces of drug residues may sometimes be found in
milk, and that such trace levels are rarely of public health
concern,'' the FDA's Gerald B. Guest told a House panel Tuesday.
   ``While FDA and the states must continue to play a larger role
in solving this problem, the responsibility for this situation is
not totally a federal and state responsibility,'' said Guest, head
of the FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine.
   ``In fact, a share of the burden for reducing illegal residues
in milk falls clearly on the dairy farmer, the veterinarian and the
milk industry,'' he told the House Government Operations
subcommittee on human resources and intergovernmental relations.
   But subcommittee Chairman Ted Weiss, D-N.Y., said, ``The honest
answer is, you just don't know the extent to which the milk supply
is safe.''
   The hearing followed Monday's release of an FDA survey which
purported to strike down the findings of private studies by The
Wall Street Journal and the Center for Science in the Public
Interest, a consumer group.
   Weiss challenged the methods used in the FDA tests and
questioned its reluctance to accept a relatively new screening test
known as the Charm II. That test was used in the two private
surveys.
   The test is highly sensitive, able to show drug residues in
amounts as low as five parts per billion, advocates say.
   But the FDA said the test yields too many false positives and
none of its positive findings could be validated in what it
considered more accurate, newer tests. Charm II is also limited
because it deals with only classes of drugs, not individual ones,
FDA says.
   The FDA said its follow tests for sulfa drugs eliminated all
samples. But the agency admitted its more advanced follow-up tests,
the final being mass spectrometry, were far less sensitive to small
amounts.
   Joseph Settepani, an FDA scientist, criticized the agency for
failing to control extra-label drug use, under which veterinarians
may prescribe drugs, under certain conditions for purposes other
than those for which the drug was initially approved.
   He said an internal memorandum in 1988 listed 30 drugs believed
to be used by milk producers. Sixteen are used extensively, he said.
   ``Many of these medicines are quite toxic, but the BS disk assay
(test) only has any likelihood of being able to detect residues in
milk from 2 of the 30 drugs on the list,'' he said.
   The BS test _ which stands for bacillus stearothermophilus _ is
the only FDA standard test for state inspectors under the milk
inspection program.

Panel</HEAD>

   The Senate is embroiled in a dispute over
whether $25 million should go to a private national board seeking
to set higher standards for public school teachers.
   Arguments over such a federal role in teacher certification held
up quick action Tuesday on a $1.5 billion, five-year program aimed
at upgrading the quality of education in the United States.
   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., sought unsuccessfully to strip the
money from the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards.
But he promised to renew that fight today.
   ``What this board wants is ... to be the sole voice of setting
the standards by which teachers operate _ that only teachers and
their unions should decide who can and who cannot teach,'' he
argued. ``Now, I think that's an outrage.''
   Sen. Strom Thurmond, D-S.C., said the provision ``could set a
precedent for federal funding of other private organizations, could
move this country to federal control of teaching standards,'' he
said.
   But the Senate defeated, on a 64-35 vote, Helms' amendment to
remove funds for the board from the education bill.
   The board was created in 1987 at the urging of the National
Governors' Association. It is an independent, nonpartisan
organization governed by a 64-member board of directors, including
representatives of teachers' unions. Activities so far have been
low-key.
   Tuesday's vote upholding funds for the board came after several
senators said public education in the United States had fallen into
disarray. Sen. David Boren, chairman of the Intelligence Committee,
said declining educational standards pose the greatest national
security threat to the United States.
   Supporters of the funding said the board _ with federal
encouragement _ would lend badly needed prestige to the teaching
profession.
   They said it would give teachers the sort of professional
competency reviews that doctors and lawyers get from the American
Medical Association and American Bar Association. Teachers could
voluntary submit for review by the national accreditation board,
backers of the provision said.
   The proposal to authorize $25 million for the certification
board is part of a wide-ranging education bill the Congressional
Budget Office says would likely cost close to $1.5 billion over
five years.
   The bill seeks to combat drugs in public schools, establish a
presidential merit schools program and increase aid to schools
seeking to reduce dropout rates.
   Earlier Tuesday, the Senate passed 99-0 legislation providing
$50 million in fiscal 1991 to attack illiteracy _ said to affect at
least 23 million Americans _ with a goal of eliminating illiteracy
by the year 2000.
   Helms argued that the National Board for Professional Teaching
Standards would be dominated by the National Education Association
and the American Federation of Teachers.
   ``The control of these unions over the board will enable them to
use taxpayers money not so much to professionalize teachers as to
finalize who does and does not teach in America,'' he said.
   Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., said a vote against the bill was ``a
vote for parents.''
   But Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., charged opponents were
using ``misinformation'' to defeat the provision. Supporters noted
that none of the $25 million could be used to pay the board's
operating expenses. Instead, the money could be used only for
research and development of teaching standards.

<HEAD>Study Shows Drug Treatments Slowing Spread of AIDS</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new government study shows drug treatments
are slowing the rate of AIDS cases among homosexual men, but that
the new therapies aren't reaching intravenous drug users and others
among the poor.
   The study shows about 36 percent fewer homosexual men have
developed AIDS than had been projected by the Public Health
Service. This rate began slowing around the middle of 1987, around
the time the anti-AIDS drug AZT and other AIDS treatments came into
wide use.
   However, the number of intravenous drug users developing AIDS is
continuing upward along the same path as projected.
   ``A good conjecture is they had less access,'' since IV drug
users tend to be poor and underserved by the health care system,
said Mitchell H. Gail, a National Cancer Institute epidemiologist
who prepared the study with NCI colleagues.
   ``Although we don't have good data yet, it's a reasonable guess
that they are not being treated as intensively as they should be,''
Gail said.,
   The study is to be published in the March issue of the Journal
of AIDS.
   AIDS can take years to develop after a person has been infected
with the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV.
   The study confirms early treatment with AZT and drugs such as
aerosol pentamidine, which treats opportunistic infections that can
kill AIDS patients, can slow progression of the disease.
   ``This is a significant report since it provides independent
evidence that early intervention and treatment for people with HIV
infection slows progression of their disease,'' Dr. James Mason,
assistant secretary for health at the Department of Health and
Human Services, said in a statement.
   He added, ``I am delighted that treatment programs are
effective.'' But he said, ``It is extremely important to remember
that this good news is not a substitute for sustained behavior
choices and effective prevention efforts by all people who are at
risk.''
   Gail said the numbers show that although treatments may be
slowing progress of the disease, people infected with the virus
will eventually get the disease. No one is known to have recovered
from AIDS.
   ``We have to be prepared for this large pool of infected people
to work their way to the more severely immune depressed and to an
AIDS diagnosis, unless we develop a cure,'' he said. ``So we can't
be that sanguine. We have to be alert that AIDS incidence is going
to rise in the future.''
   The federal Centers for Disease Control, which tracks reported
AIDS cases, is reassessing its projections. Last month, the agency
said its estimates of the potential number of AIDS cases, ranging
from 1 million to 1.5 million, may be too high.
   The CDC now believes the number to be in the range of 700,000 to
1.4 million, according to an HHS source, who spoke on the condition
of anonymity.

<HEAD>Zero Inflation Resolution Backed by Four Regional Fed Officials</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Four Federal Reserve Bank presidents are
supporting a congressional resolution calling for an inflation rate
near zero within five years, but warn it will require temporarily
higher unemployment and slower economic growth.
   ``There is absolutely no question that bringing the underlying
inflation rate down from its current level of 4.5 percent to
something like 1 or 1.5 percent will involve costs,'' said E.
Gerald Corrigan, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
   ``Indeed, I am very hard-pressed to recall a single case where a
significant reduction in inflation was accomplished in a major
industrial country without relatively large costs,'' he told the
House Banking subcommittee on monetary policy on Tuesday.
   ``Over the last decade, in both Germany and the Netherlands _
the European superstars on the inflation front _ the unemployment
rate has been quite high by historic and international comparative
standards,'' he said.
   Nevertheless, Corrigan and the three other presidents endorsed a
zero inflation resolution proposed by Rep. Stephen L. Neal, D-N.C.,
chairman of the monetary policy subcommittee. In the long run, zero
inflation will bring the greatest possible economic growth and
lower interest rates, they argued.
   The nation's monetary policy is set mainly by the Federal Open
Market Committee, which is composed of the seven-member Federal
Reserve Board in Washington and the presidents of the 12 regional
Federal Reserve Banks.
   Robert T. Parry, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San
Francisco, said work done by his staff indicates that in the short
term slower growth and higher unemployment, but not an outright
recession, are necessary to bring inflation down to zero by 1994.
   The unemployment rate, now at 5.3 percent, could rise to between
6.75 percent and 7.75 percent, he said. At the same time, growth,
as measured by the gross national product, would have to be 1 to 2
percentage points slower than the 2.5 percent to 3 percent growth
that the bank presidents said was the fastest achievable without
accelerating inflation.
   Congress and the administration can ease the pain by cutting the
budget deficit and stimulating savings and investment, Corrigan
said.
   ``It's going to take much more than rhetoric,'' he said.
   However, Neal's resolution, if passed, would give the Fed the
political backing it needs to do its part, said Robert P. Black,
president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, Va.
   ``Inflation may well re-accelerate in the absence of a clear
signal to the public that Congress fully supports the Federal
Reserve's commitment to lower inflation,'' he warned.
   ``The (Federal Reserve) is under constant pressure to `do
something' with monetary policy in the short run to improve the
economy's performance,'' Black said. ``Such pressures have, at
times ... actually contributed to an acceleration of inflation.
There is obviously a risk that history will repeat itself.''
   The fourth Federal Reserve Bank president endorsing the
resolution was H. Lee Hoskins of Cleveland.
   In recent weeks, the Bush administration, with no noticeable
effect, has called on the Fed to lower interest rates and stimulate
economic growth.
   Michael Boskin, chairman of the White House Council of Economic
Advisers, told reporters Tuesday that the administration supports
reducing inflation over time, but not necessarily within the
timetable required by Neal's resolution.
   ``Our primary goal is to sustain the highest possible growth. In
the course of obtaining a sensible monetary policy, we think it is
desirable to maintain growth and employment,'' Boskin said.

<TEXT>
   Congressional Democrats are raising images of
democratic reforms in Eastern Europe and the U.S. civil rights
movement to pressure President Bush into backing a House-passed
bill easing voter registration.
   Over the objections of the White House and some other top
Republicans, the House approved the legislation 289-132 on Tuesday
and sent the measure to the Senate. Sixty-one of the chamber's 175
Republicans broke with party leaders to vote for the proposal.
   The so-called motor voter bill requires states to include voting
registration forms with drivers' license applications and to
establish procedures to sign up voters by mail and at numerous
government offices. It would take effect in January 1993.
   States would have to search voting lists at least once every
four years for people who have moved or have registered
fraudulently. The federal government would provide up to $50
million to help states pay for the new procedures.
   The White House complained last week that the measure, written
by Reps. Al Swift, D-Wash., and William Thomas, R-Calif., would
allow too much fraud and be too expensive for states. Democrats
spent much of Tuesday attempting to capitalize on the
administration's opposition.
   House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., noted the bill
was being debated ``at the very time the leaders of Eastern Europe
are trying to bring democracy to their countries.''
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., told reporters Democrats
and Republicans are ``proud and happy'' about the political reforms
under way in Eastern Europe. If President Bush opposes improvements
at home, he said, ``I would be interested in knowing why.''
   Even Democratic Party Chairman Ronald H. Brown got into the act,
telling reporters, ``As the Iron Curtain falls abroad, we must open
fully the voting curtain here at home.''
   Other Democrats drew connections between the legislation and the
American civil rights movement.
   Arguing the bill would be the broadest extension of voting
rights since the 1965 Voting Rights Act, Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga. _ a
1960s civil rights activist _ said, ``We should not be afraid to
open fully the doors of political participation and let the people
come in.''
   The legislators rejected by a 291-129 vote a White House-backed
alternative introduced by Rep. Pat Roberts, R-Kan. The measure
would have made the bill's new procedures voluntary and provided
$120 million to help states boost their voter registration efforts.
   ``Our campaigns are too long, they're too expensive, they
alienate potential voters,'' said House Minority Leader Bob Michel,
R-Ill. ``If you want more people to vote, then we should run more
stimulating and competitive campaigns.''
   Swift argued the GOP amendment would ``gut'' the underlying bill.
   The bill is aimed at dwindling voter turnout, which dipped to 50
percent of the 120 million registered voters in the 1988
presidential polling. Experts say about 60 million Americans who
are eligible to vote are not registered.
   Advocates of the measure believe the ``motor voter'' section
would be particularly effective because 91 percent of the 180
million voting-age Americans have drivers' licenses or motor
vehicle department identification cards.
   The legislation would apply to every state but North Dakota,
which does not require voters to register.

   For about $5 you can get a room at
Saalfeld's best hotel. Cheap, but you might not be pleased by the
failing furnace, sagging floors and a bed that remains unmade
unless you do it yourself.
   ``East Germany is just like this hotel,'' remarked a worker at
the Hotel Anker who said he would be fired if his name was
published.
   ``The whole place is falling apart and no one in their right
mind would want to stay here.''
   East Germany seems like it is crumbling.
   Despair at economic conditions and uncertainty about East
Germany's future, an exodus of workers to West Germany, strikes,
and absenteeism are bringing the country to the brink of collapse.
   East Germany is also suffering a political paralysis stemming
from a leadership vacuum and constant bickering among opposition
forces.
   ``This country is in serious trouble, and there's not a lot of
agreement about what to do about it,'' said Guenter Bader, a member
of the New Forum opposition group in Saalfeld, a town of about
30,000 people near the Bavarian border.
   Karl Gruenheid, head of a government economics committee, said
in East Berlin that the shortage of workers and strikes are
seriously driving down production.
   Mail is no longer delivered in some areas because there's no one
to deliver it.
   Soldiers are being used to operate trolleys because of a driver
shortage.
   Production at a giant potash mine near Erfurt was paralyzed by
striking workers demanding more pay and assurances they won't lose
their jobs as East Germany goes through the painful process of
adopting free-market principles.
   Production slow-downs are starting to create serious shortages
of some key products, such as rolled steel, coal and natural gas,
West German news media report.
   At least one-tenth of Saalfeld's citizens have fled to West
Germany and the number grows every day, Bader said.
   ``If something isn't done soon, Saalfeld will be nothing but an
old folk's home with a few jobless Stasi (state security agents)
left behind,'' he said.
   West German companies have plans to help bail out East Germany's
economy as the two countries gradually move toward reunification,
but the rescue operation will cost billions and take years.
   East Germany once had one of the strongest economies in the East
bloc. But an exodus of more than 400,000 people in little more than
a year and rising despair among the people have steered the economy
to the edge of disaster.
   Financial experts say East Germany has many assets on which to
build a thriving economy.
   But over 40 years the Communists did little maintenance on
plants and factories and a total overhaul may be needed to make
them profitable.
   Experts say tourism could also become an important moneymaker in
East Germany, but enormous and costly renewal efforts would be
needed.
   Saalfeld, for example, sits on the edge of the picturesque
Thuringian Forest and would probably draw tourists with the right
accommodations and entertainment possibilities.
   But like most small-town hotels across East Germany, the main
one in Saalfeld _ the Anker _ has standards most Westerners would
not tolerate.
   The hotel furnace failed on at least two recent cold February
nights, the maid showed up only to announce it was time for the
guest to leave, and noxious coal fumes filtered into the room from
someone else's furnace.
   ``Whenever West German businessmen think about our country's
economy, what they see is a place where a lot of money has to be
invested. This hotel, for example, would have to be totally
rebuilt. It's an embarrassment,'' said a hotel employee.
   During a rally in Saalfeld, New Forum speakers promised they
would work for the preservation of local jobs if residents sent
their candidate to Parliament in March 18 elections.
   But the 500 or so rally participants were less interested in the
elections than they were in calling for unity with West Germany.
   East Germany's leaders have finally had to swallow the idea that
German unification is inevitable. But they want it to come from a
gradual process.
   Communist Premier Hans Modrow has pleaded for workers to stay on
the job and for citizens to remain in East Germany, saying the
country has to work out its problems in an orderly manner.
   ``Above all, I call on the citizens ... to abstain from anything
_ and I mean anything _ that damages our economy, and assistance
for and welfare of the people,'' Modrow told Parliament.

<HEAD>Rights Group Promises No Move to Block Judicial Nominee</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission has one less roadblock toward confirmation as a federal
appeals judge with a major civil rights group's promise not to
stand in his way.
   ``While we cannot give him our unqualified endorsement, we will,
however, not oppose the nomination,'' NAACP Executive Director
Benjamin L. Hooks said Tuesday.
   The statement was issued as the Senate Judiciary Committee heard
testimony on the nomination of Clarence Thomas, a prominent black
conservative in the Reagan and Bush administrations.
   Civil rights forces over the last seven years have continuously
criticized the 41-year-old Yale law graduate and former aide to
Sen. John C. Danforth, R-Mo. They say he has been lax in enforcing
anti-bias laws.
   It appeared the nomination of Thomas to succeed Robert Bork on
the U.S. Court of Appeals in the District of Columbia could become
the first skirmish this year between the Bush administration and
liberals over judicial nominees.
   But there didn't appear at the hearing to be enough opposition
in the Senate to block the nomination, with the NAACP standing
aside. In his brief statement, Hooks said, ``we do have questions
about his management of EEOC.''
   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, a member of the panel, said,
``Frankly, I have questions about the nominee's commitment to the
law.'' But he told Thomas, ``We haven't always agreed, but I
respect your views.''
   Nancy Kreiter of Chicago, research director of the Women
Employed Institute, testified that under Thomas the commission
``failed to fulfill its mandate to protect the rights of victims of
discrimination.''
   ``Mr. Thomas' actions in the areas of policy and enforcement
performance demonstrate a lack of respect for law and a disregard
for individuals,'' she said, arguing people who file complaints
have been treated with increasing hostility.
   ``A careful look at his record raises serious questions about
his qualifications for a lifetime appointment to administer justice
on the federal bench,'' she said.
   Rutgers law professor Alfred W. Blumrose, an advocate of rights
for senior citizens, told the committee the commission apparently
violated its own regulations by eliminating a policy of pursuing
hiring goals and timetables in 1985 without taking any formal
action under the federal government's ``sunshine'' law.
   He said there was a ``sort of quiet suggestion by innuendo
leading the lawyers in the agency to alter the process.''
   Thomas testified that as an appeals judge he would not ``have
the option of roaming unfettered through judicial terrain'' and
injecting his personal views into decisions.
   Thomas vowed ``to faithfully adhere to the Supreme Court
decisions'' and not ``torture a case to reach a preconceived notion
of what a result should be.''
   He acknowledged the statute of limitations on 900 cases of
alleged bias against the elderly lapsed before the commission acted
on them. ``It happened on my watch,'' he said. But he said the
lapses were because he initiated more extensive investigative
procedures that may have been ``too ambitious.''
   Sen. Howell Heflin, D-Ala., asked him about reports that 13,000
cases actually lapsed. Thomas said: ``I don't have the slightest
idea where that number comes from.''
   Thomas, who is black, said as a conservative he often finds
himself at odds with ``an expected orthodoxy from black
Americans.'' He said criticism from civil rights groups ``is
something that is uncomfortable, but it is something that I'll have
to live with.''
   ``I think the choice between principle and popularity is
something that each individual will have to make and I've made mine
and I'll live with the consequences,'' Thomas said.
   Danforth, who twice hired Thomas as an aide, praised him as ``a
person who calls them as he sees them.''

<HEAD>Tentative Agreement Reached to Limit Toxic Industrial Releases</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate negotiators on clean air legislation
are working toward a compromise on curbing auto emissions, now that
sources say they reached a tentative agreement to limit toxic
industrial releases.
   ``I hope we can conclude the discussions this week,'' said
Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, in a telephone
interview Tuesday night after daylong closed-door bargaining on key
parts of the clean air bill.
   The legislation, which would require tighter pollution controls
on everything from automobiles to industrial facilities and
electric power plants, would be the first tightening of federal
clean air law in 13 years.
   A subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee
planned to begin considering that chamber's clean air bill today.
   Mitchell said several proposals on auto emissions were being
considered and that he hoped that issue could be resolved by the
end of today.
   According to Senate sources, negotiators reached a tentative
agreement that would require industry to use the best available
technology to curb toxic chemical releases and eventually meet
specific health standards based on cancer risk.
   Industry and the Bush administration had opposed the health-risk
criteria, arguing it would be too expensive and some plants would
be unable to comply. But the compromise would make it easier for
certain plants to avoid the most stringent health-based standards
because the government would have to calculate risks using ``real
world'' situations at specific plants and not rely on mathematical
models.
   Sources said the negotiators also reached agreement on urban
smog pollution from sources other than motor vehicles. The
compromise, however, exempts most smaller polluters which
complained that they might be driven out of business if required to
install pollution control equipment.
   The negotiations have involved a relatively small number of
senators and senior Bush administration officials including EPA
Administrator William Reilly, his deputy for air pollution issues,
William Rosenberg, and Roger Porter, a senior presidential adviser.
   Regular participants have been Mitchell, Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan.,
the minority leader, and Sens. Max Baucus, D-Mont., and John
Chafee, R-R.I., the bill's two floor leaders, as well as other
senators with interest about specific parts of the bill, according
to Senate sources.
   The talks are aimed at heading off a floor fight on the clean
air bill, which Mitchell has made a target for early action.
   Negotiators on Tuesday narrowed the discussions on auto
emissions to a small number of proposals, including a compromise
reached between Mitchell and Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., who had
championed the concerns of the automakers.
   But the Mitchell-Levin proposal was not endorsed by the Bush
administration and both Baucus and Chafee also were said to have
reservations about it.
   The Mitchell-Levin proposal would retain tough second-stage
tailpipe standards scheduled to go into effect in the year 2003,
but eliminate a requirement for automakers to sharply increase fuel
economy through mandated reductions in carbon dioxide emissions.
   The carbon dioxide reductions have been strongly opposed by
automakers who maintain they are not feasible, while being pushed
by environmentalists as a way to deal with global warming.
   Meanwhile, some senators not directly participating were said to
be privately expressing some concern about the closed-door deal
making.
   Even Baucus suggested some discomfort Tuesday, saying he wants
to ``make sure that all that has been written (into the bill) in
public is not unwritten in these closed sessions.''

<HEAD>Polygraph Expert Appears Before Grand Jury</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A grand jury's questioning of a polygraph
expert who is helping investigate the bombing of Pan AM Flight 103
indicates the Justice Department's probe is entering a new phase.
   A federal grand jury in Washington heard testimony last Friday
from James Keefe, a polygraph expert for a security consulting firm
hired by lawyers representing Pan Am in a civil suit over the Dec.
21, 1988 bombing.
   Keefe testified about giving polygraph tests to three Pan Am
baggage handlers in Frankfurt, West Germany, during his appearance
before the grand jury, said a source familiar with the case.
   Keefe told the panel two of the three baggage handlers failed
the polygraph tests when they said they knew nothing about the
transfer of a piece of luggage to Flight 103, said the source, who
spoke on the condition of anonymity.
   The source confirmed a report published in Tuesday's editions of
the Syracuse Post Standard.
   Keefe's appearance before the grand jury indicates U.S.
authorities are stepping up their investigation of the bombing over
Lockerbie, Scotland that killed 259 passengers and crew members and
11 people on the ground.
   Anti-terrorism laws give federal prosecutors in Washington
jurisdiction to bring cases in acts that occur abroad.
   Scottish police believe the bomb was in a suitcase that was
placed aboard Pan Am Flight 103 in Frankfurt before it took off for
London. Passengers and luggage were transferred to a Boeing 747 at
London's Heathrow Airport for the trans-Atlantic leg of the trip to
New York City.
   The suitcase is believed to have been brought to Frankfurt
aboard a plane from Malta. Investigators found clothing fragments
in Lockerbie that were traced to a clothing store in Malta,
according to a federal law enforcement source.
   The bombing investigation has focused on a number of terrorist
organizations, including the Popular Front for the Liberation of
Palestine-General Command.
   Polygraph tests cannot be admitted in court, but the questions
Keefe asked the baggage handlers and their responses may provide
investigators with new leads in the case.
   Keefe works for Interfor Inc., a New York-based security
consulting firm retained by lawyers representing Pan Am's insurance
carrier in a $300 million damage suit filed by relatives of people
killed in the bombing.
   He was served with the grand jury subpoena on Jan. 25 as he
stepped off a plane at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New
York following his return from Europe, said the source.

<HEAD>No Planning Now Against Soviet Attack On Iran</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Defense Department is no longer planning
for large-scale resistance to a Soviet attack through Iran toward
Persian Gulf oil fields, according to published reports today.
   The instructions are contained in the annual Defense Planning
Guidance, this year covering the period 1992-1997 and signed by
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney on Jan. 24, according to The
Washington Post.
   The newspaper said a senior Defense Department official briefed
several reporters about the document, which is classified.
   The New York Times today carried a similar description of the
contents of the document, attributed to a senior defense official.
   A Pentagon spokesman, Col. Steve Roy, said Tuesday night he had
no information on the guidance document.
   The United States has had contingency plans to counter a Soviet
attack into Iran since the Soviets invaded Afghanistan in 1979.
   Central Command, based in Tampa, Fla., was established to handle
the planning and to direct any military operations in the Persian
Gulf area. This command handled the Navy patrols of the gulf and
escorts of Kuwaiti tankers under the U.S. flag in 1987 against
Iranian attacks. Naval activity drastically curtailed after the end
of the Iran-Iraq war.
   According to the Times, the senior official said the threat of a
Soviet drive through Iran was now ``not credible'' and the United
States was not capable of mounting a defense in Iran's Zagros
Mountains.
   According to the Post, the United States would still ``consider
the contingency of the Soviet attack into Iran'' but no longer make
the ``large investments to support forces in Iran,'' according to
the senior official.
   According to both newspapers, the guidance document instructs
planners to assume a successful negotiation on conventional forces
in Europe will cut Soviet forces there.
   Both said the services were told to plan to defend the oil
fields of the Arabian Peninsula against attacks by unspecified
adversaries.

<TEXT>
   A group that threatened to picket
actress Jane Fonda's new film ``Stanley &amp; Iris'' at every movie
house in the state has put down its placards.
   After a delay of more than five months, the movie shot partly in
Waterbury will open Friday.
   But the Waterbury-based ``American Coalition Against Hanoi
Jane,'' which staged protests during the filming in Connecticut in
1988, won't be at Hoyt's Mallview Cinema 10 for the opening.
   Gaetano Russo, the coalition's organizer, said the group has
accomplished its goals of educating the public about Fonda's
actions during the Vietnam War.
   The coalition has criticized Fonda for actions such as a 1972
radio broadcast during which Fonda criticized the United States for
its role in the Vietnam War.
   Fonda apologized to Vietnam veterans and their families during a
segment of ABC-TV's ``20-20'' shown in 1988 while she was still in
Waterbury. She said she never intended to hurt them or make their
situation worse.
   She also appeared at a benefit for the Vietnam Veterans Agent
Orange Victims during the summer of 1988 at Quassy Amusement Park
in Middlebury to raise money for the children afflicted with
illnesses associated with the defoliate Agent Orange, which was
used in Vietnam.

<HEAD>Six Killed in Fire Blamed on Woodburning Stove</HEAD>
<DATELINE>POTOSI, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Relatives say they listened helplessly to
screams for help but were kept back by intense heat as a young
couple and four children died in a fire that destroyed their mobile
home.
   A woodburning stove that had been moved and reinstalled in the
mobile home just a day earlier caused the fire.
   Killed in Tueday's predawn fire were Davie Light, 18; Michelle
Miller, 22; their 3-week-old daughter, Jessica; Miller's two other
children, James, 3, and Alicia, 16 months; and Light's niece,
Rachel Hafley, 3.
   ``I ran over and I could hear Davie yelling and banging, trying
to get out,'' said Jim Wills, Light's brother-in-law. ``I tried to
yank the back door open, but when I finally did, it was too late.''
   The flames blocked the door, he said, trapping the occupants.
   ``It's an awful thing when you hear someone hollering for
help,'' Wills said, ``and you can't do nothing.''
   Investigators said the fire started in an improperly installed
flue attached to the wood stove.
   ``Apparently the flue pipe was a couple of inches too short
where it ran through the ceiling,'' said Washington County Sheriff
Ronnie L. Skiles. ``The stove had also been mounted on wooden
blocks.''
   Robert Jacobsen, of the state division of fire safety, said the
fire probably had smoldered for some time before bursting into
flames and that the residents probably could have gotten out had
the trailer been equipped with a smoke detector.
   Skiles said wood stoves were becoming more prevalent in trailers
in the area, 65 miles southwest of St. Louis.
   ``People can't afford gas, they can't afford electricity,
especially in a financially depressed area like Washington County.
They do it to save money,'' he said.
   Skiles said although fire codes don't forbid it, ``a mobile home
is not made for a wood stove.''

<HEAD>Stocks Down, Dollar Higher on Tokyo Market</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange plunged
Wednesday, while the dollar inched up against the yen.
   The dollar closed at 145.10 yen, up 0.20 yen from Tuesday's
144.90-yen close. The currency opened higher at 145.18 yen, and
ranged between 145.03 yen and 145.34 yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 364.96 points, or 0.97
percent, ending the day at 37,301.87. It had gained 35.42 points
Tuesday.
   The index fell as most investors stepped to the sidelines amid
uncertainties over the U.S. government bond auction and the Soviet
Communist Party Central Committee meeting, said a Nomura Securities
analyst, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   ``Although many participants evaluated (Mikhail) Gorbachev's
achievement in the meeting positively, expecting the move would
lead to further reforms and stability, they can't wipe off all the
uncertainties,'' he said.
   Japanese investors reportedly bought substantial amounts of the
three-year U.S. government notes auctioned Tuesday, but it remains
to be seen if demand will be strong for the sale of 10- and 30-year
bonds later Wednesday and Thursday.
   At the end of the morning session, the dollar stood at 145.13
yen. It opened at 145.18 yen, up 0.28 yen from Monday's close, and
ranged between 145.03 yen and 145.34 yen.
   The dollar-yen rate moved narrowly in thin trading, said Minori
Takeuchi, a trader with Chemical Bank in Tokyo.
   ``Market players rather focused on cross-tradings with the West
German mark,'' she said.
   But the trading was mixed as some investors sold the mark
against the yen to take profits on the German currency's recent
gains, Ms. Takeuchi said.
   Investors bought the mark encouraged by Gorbachev's initiative
calling for an end to the Communist monopoly on power, traders
said. Gorbachev's grip on power is believed to be key to stability
in Eastern Europe, a key factor in the mark's strength.
   The Communist Party meeting continues for a third day Wednesday.

   A 156-year-old painting of a mountain
by the founder of the Hudson River School apparently shows the
highest peak in the Berkshires, not a New York slope as was long
thought.
   Some art historian sleuthing has revealed that what was accepted
as a scene near the Hudson River studio of 19th century landscape
artist Thomas Cole actually is Mount Greylock of Massachusetts.
   The 1834 painting had been identified in the 1950s as a scene
near Mount Merino in Hudson, N.Y., across the river from Catskill,
N.Y., where Cole maintained a studio.
   Maureen Johnson Hickey, curator of art education for the
Berkshire Museum in Pittsfield, said her curiosity was piqued when
she began assembling an exhibit of Hudson River School painters'
scenes of the Berkshires to open in March.
   ``All the biggies _ Cole, Church, Duran, Innes _ came to the
Berkshires and I just couldn't believe that Cole, living so close,
had never painted anything here,'' she said.
   Ellwood C. Parry III, a professor of art history at the
University of Arizona, said Cole was in Pittsfield in 1833 and had
mentioned doing a portrait of Hoosac Mountain, as Greylock was then
called.
   At Parry's suggestion, a painting acquired two years ago by the
Newark Museum in Newark, N.J., was examined and found to depict
Lake Pontoosuc and Mount Greylock, rising 3,491 feet from a
sea-level valley in the northern Berkshires, instead of the gentler
rise along the Hudson River.
   Although the lake is larger now, a grove of pines at the right
of the painting still stands and the white church steeple and
little village of Lanesboro can be seen in the distance, just as
they appear in the painting, Ms. Hickey said.

   Some asked about former President Reagan's
boyhood habit of hiding pennies, others fixated on the football in
his bedroom and just about everyone liked his birthday cake.
   By all accounts, the birthday party for 250 fifth graders at
Reagan's boyhood home was a success even though Reagan was not on
hand to have a piece of the birthday cake.
   In honor of his 79th birthday, youngsters from the school system
toured the Reagan Home and Visitor's Center on Tuesday and saw a
video about his life.
   Fifth graders were selected for the party because Reagan was
about that age when he began school in Dixon, after moving with his
family to the northern Illinois town from his hometown of Tampico,
about 20 miles southwest.
   The Dixon City Council and the Illinois General Assembly marked
the event by declaring Tuesday Ronald Reagan Day. The birthday
party for fifth graders may become an annual event.

   As a municipal animal control officer,
Dave Opfer has plenty of experience rounding up stray dogs, cats.
Now, a stubborn seal has been added to the list.
   Opfer said the slippery marine mammal wandered into this logging
and prison town about 50 miles southwest of Seattle three times
Tuesday.
   The first two times it was herded into a creek and back into

   The third time the seal was spotted near the library, eight
blocks from the water and heading uphill. Attempts to move it were
met by bared teeth and ominous growling.
   The seal eventually was captured in a net and taken to the Point
Defiance Zoo in Tacoma.
   Marine mammal experts at Cascadia Research identified the animal
as a 5-year-old northern fur seal but were unable to say what it
was doing in town, police officer Michael Hudnell said.

   The school board reinstated a black
superintendent and closed the schools today to ease racial turmoil
that raised discordant echoes from this 1960s battleground of the
civil rights movement.
   With the 25th anniversary of the Selma-to-Montgomery voting
rights march only a month away, white officials appeared close to
bowing to the key demands of black protesters.
   The six white members of the Selma Board of Education reinstated
the city's first black school superintendent, Norward Roussell, and
urged the five black board members who had quit over Roussell's
treatment to return.
   Roussell said he was not surprised by his reinstatement, saying
he ``did not understand the board's decision to relieve me of my
duties.''
   The board closed all 11 schools in the 6,000-student system,
which is 70 percent black. They will not reopen until racial
tensions subside and the threat of schoolhouse violence ends, the
board said.
   The board's decision late Tuesday capped weeks of protests and
periodic school boycotts.
   ``Selma is a magic name for demonstrations,'' said Mayor Joe
Smitherman, who has served all but one term as mayor since 1964.
``This is almost like a beginning of a re-enactment of the '60s _ a
real re-enactment.
   ``I hope it doesn't get to that,'' he said.
   The five black school board members quit in December after the
board, in a vote split along racial lines, decided not to renew
Roussell's $80,000-a-year contract in June. Supporters claimed
Roussell was removed because of race and not because of a lack of
managerial skills, as his detractors said.
   Last week, the white members of the board voted to remove
Roussell immediately, and installed the Rev. F.D. Reese, the black
principal of Selma High School, as interim superintendent.
   The decision to reinstate Roussell meant Reese would lose his
new job, but Reese said he accepted the decision.
   Reese called for the orderly dismissal of classes Tuesday after
reports of fighting at 1,508-student Selma High, the system's only
public high school, which is about two-thirds black.
   ``We could certainly see and feel the level of tensions among
the students,'' Reese said. Police were called but there were no
arrests.
   Dozens of the black students joined in demonstrations outside
City Hall, carrying signs saying ``Smitherman Must Go,'' and
singing civil rights songs.
   On Monday, four black protesters were arrested on misdemeanor
charges in a melee in the mayor's office.
   One of the four, Rose Sanders, was taken to a hospital with an
apparent neck or back injury and was listed in stable condition.
Her husband, state Sen. Hank Sanders, a Democrat, said she was in
pain but indicated the injury was not critical.
   The five black board members said they never signed formal
resignation papers, leaving open the possibility of their return.
   A statement by the board said Selma schools would reopen ``upon
adequate assurances to Dr. Roussell and the board that the safety
and physical welfare of our students and all school employees can
be ensured.''
   Roussell was at Selma High as throngs of parents and students
left the building with the cancellation of classes Tuesday morning.
He joined in helping disperse crowds of students ``so we would not
have any trouble.''
   Roussell, who became superintendent in 1987, said he was not
legally removed from office by the board and was ``officially on
vacation'' during recent weeks.
   In sanctioning his removal, white school board members had cited
an unfavorable job evaluation and Roussell's management style.

<HEAD>IRS Issues New Guidelines</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Internal Revenue Service is putting out
guidelines to help charities determine how much of a contribution
is tax-deductible when the donor receives something in return.
   The IRS also asked charitable organizations to determine
beforehand the fair market value of any benefit given to a
contributor. Any solicitation, ticket or receipt should state how
much of the contribution is deductible.
   Although the law allows a tax deduction for most contributions
to charities recognized by the IRS, it generally requires that any
goods or services of value received in return be subtracted from
the deductible amount.
   In the new guidelines, issued Tuesday, the agency acknowledged
that some gifts to the donor may be so insubstantial that the
entire contribution is deductible.
   In general, the ``insubstantial'' rule will come into play when
the value of all benefits received by a donor is not more than 2
percent of the contribution, or $50, whichever is less; or if the
contribution is $27.26 or more and the only benefits are token
items such as T-shirts, bookmarks or calendars bearing the
charity's name. The cost of the article may not exceed $5.45.
   The latter two figures represent the inflation-adjusted value of
$25 and $5, respectively, which were the limitations when Congress
amended the law affecting deductible contributions.

<HEAD>Congressional Study Says Pap Smears Can Help Elderly Women</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pap smear screening to detect cervical cancer,
combined with appropriate treatment, could save the lives of many
elderly women, according to a new study by the Office of Technology
Assessment.
   Medicare, the federal health care program for the elderly, will
begin paying for Pap tests in July 1990, and the study by the
congressional agency said the screening will be most cost-effective
it is combined with efforts to encourage high-risk women to be
tested.
   According to the study:
   _Women at high risk of cervical cancer are smokers, poor,
nonwhite, were young at first intercourse and have had multiple
sexual partners.
   _Studies have found that women who have been screened are
one-half to one-tenth as likely to develop cervical cancer as other
women.
   _Elderly women appear to have lower rates of localized,
noninvasive cervical tumors than younger women, but the elderly
have higher rates of invasive cervical cancer and higher death
rates from cervical cancer.
   _Since elderly women are less likely to be screened for cervical
cancer than younger women, older women are more likely to be in
advanced stages of the disease when it is diagnosed.

<HEAD>US Official Says Other Nations Lag in Controlling Drug Chemicals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Governments in West Germany, the Netherlands
and Japan are unwilling to control the export of chemicals used to
manufacture drugs, says a Bush administration official.
   ``It does not seem likely that European chemical legislation, as
contemplated, will have a significant impact on the diversion and
trafficking of chemicals, particularly those destined for the
illicit production of cocaine,'' said Gene R. Haislip, deputy
assistant administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration.
   Haislip, testifying before the Subcommittee on Foreign Commerce
of the Senate Commerce Committee, said great quantities of
chemicals are shipped through the Dutch port of Rotterdam.
   ``Whereas in the past most of these shipments have come from the
United States, I think the shift is on and in the future we're
going to see that Europe, and to some lesser extent Brazil and
other countries, will become the predominant suppliers, with the
Netherlands and the Federal Republic of Germany ... being the two
principal exporting countries,'' he said.
   In an interview after his testimony, Haislip said the West
German and Dutch governments are reluctant to interfere with what
they see as legitimate business.
   At the hearing, Sens. Harry Reid and Richard Bryan, both Nevada
Democrats, accused U.S. chemical companies of selling chemicals
that help make drugs in Colombia.
   ``The evidence is inescapable that some American chemical
manufacturers and distributors have contributed to America's $100
billion cocaine habit,'' said Bryan.

   Communist Party leaders added an unexpected third
day to their pivotal meeting Tuesday and sent Mikhail S. Gorbachev
back to the drawing board to fill in holes in his blueprint for
ending the party's monopoly on power.
   The extension of the party session, which was supposed to end
Tuesday, was a clear sign of the controversy generated by
Gorbachev's proposals to revamp the country's political structure.
   It sharply contrasted with previous sessions, when the Central
Committee automatically approved policies that had been worked out
at higher levels.
   Central Committee sources said most speakers agreed with
Gorbachev's proposal that the party's monopoly on power, enshrined
in the Soviet Constitution, must end.
   ``All unanimously think it has become obsolete. It has no
meaning,'' Central Committee member Vladimir P. Anishchev told
reporters who gathered outside the Kremlin's Spasky Gate to await
news. The session was closed to journalists.
   However, partial transcripts of two days of the session, in
which 51 speakers took the floor, indicated that neither radical
reformers nor hard-liners were satisfied with Gorbachev's proposal.
   Delegates said Tuesday night's Central Committee session was
suspended so a commission, headed by Gorbachev, could complete
changes to his nearly 20-page platform. A Central Committee source
quoted Gorbachev as saying that the 60-member commission was only
half-finished, even though it met all night Monday.
   The meeting resumed Wednesday morning.
   Delegates interviewed Monday and Tuesday as they filed out onto
Red Square indicated a common objection: the platform contains few
specifics.
   ``A lot of its points, and this is what has been said by many
speakers, need major changes and reinforcement, especially in the
direction of stepping up decisive action,'' Leonid A. Bibin, a
non-voting Central Committee member, said in a Soviet TV interview
Tuesday.
   Bibin said he and others want the platform to stress that the
party must remain united. The party's unity has been threatened in
recent months by a breakaway of the party in Lithuania and by
proposals by Moscow radicals for formal factions.
   Gorbachev, as he has done on so many issues, has placed himself
in the middle, trying to forge compromises.
   Still, the Soviet leader's platform has yielded to the demands
of political reformers _ including the thousands of people who
gathered near the Kremlin wall Sunday _ by removing the party's
monopoly and advancing to this summer a party congress that will be
empowered to clear out conservatives on the Central Committee.
   Gorbachev is not likely to water down the platform, for fear of
displeasing the increasingly active and consolidated reformers. But
he also must be careful not to antagonize conservatives, who remain
strong in the Central Committee.
   Formally, the Central Committee has the power to replace the
party leader.
   Indrek Toome, premier of the Baltic republic of Estonia and a
guest at the party meeting, emphasized the threat from hard-liners.
   ``I am worried about the wish of a fairly large proportion of
the people in this hall to reverse things, so as to clamp down on
things and return to the old order,'' Toome told Soviet TV.
   Other speakers worried out loud about Gorbachev's political
standing. Y.A. Gankovsky, a Siberian party secretary, suggested
Gorbachev's position was weakened because he had taken on too many
jobs.
   ``While you, Mikhail Sergeyevich, were only the (party) general
secretary _absolutely without flattery I will say _ we felt that
new ideas were born in the party, that some kind of reformation
work was under way to break up the outlived and outdated. Now you
have four posts. One gets the impression that someone wants the
general not to be successful at any of them, scattering powers,''
Gankovsky said.
   In addition to being party general secretary, Gorbachev is
president, chairman of the Defense Council and a Politburo member.
   Politburo member Yegor K. Ligachev, widely identified as its
leading conservative, received warm applause for a speech
criticizing failings in perestroika, Gorbachev's reform program,
the Central Committee source said.
   ``After somewhat of an enlivening in the first two years of
perestroika, the economy began to decline, inter-ethnic feuds
reached bloodshed, people began to experience fear, and in some
places there is practically dual power,'' Ligachev said in remarks
reported by Tass.
   He said the Politburo, led by Gorbachev, and the government
committed ``serious oversights and mistakes.'' He cited monetary
problems that worsened consumer goods shortages, a lack of
supervision of new economic forms and a ``weakness of governent
discipline.''
   ``The gap between the word and deed is intolerable,'' he
continued.
   On political reform, Ligachev demanded the platform include a
clause emphasizing the sacredness of party unity, and he said he
firmly opposes allowing private property, a demand of radical
reformers.
   Ligachev, 69, has generally taken a cautious approach to
reforming the country and last week came under attack in a Soviet
newspaper for his conservative views. But in his speech Tuesday, he
said he wants reform quickly, denied he was a conservative, and
said people who call him one are trying to divert the people's
attention.
   Alexander Fomin, a coal miner invited as a guest to the session,
said other speakers criticized the platform as being ``based on old
dogmas.''
   ``There were not enough radical proposals to solve the party's
problems,'' Fomin said.
   He did not detail the objections, and the Soviet media carried
few details of the session.
   One speaker, Yevgeny P. Velikhov, said the Communist Party would
be better off if it split in two so it could compete more
effectively in the new political structure.
   He compared the parties he envisions to the Democratic and
Republican parties in the United States. The platforms of those
parties, Velikhov said, are difficult to distinguish from one
another. Velikhov's remarks were reported by Tass.

   Former principal Joe Clark, whose
bat-wielding cleanup of a New Jersey high school became the subject
of a motion picture, says America could become the ``first fully
developed Third World nation.''
   Public education is ``institutionalized child abuse,'' Clark
told 200 Lowndes County High School students.
   ``American education is in the absolute doldrums of
stagnation,'' he said Tuesday. ``Everything points to the fact that
the educational process is suffering a type of malady that, unless

   Clark gained notoriety by roaming the halls of Paterson, N.J.'s
East Side High School while carrying a baseball bat and talking
straight with kids. His effort became the subject of the movie
``Lean On Me.''
   Clark told the cheering students Tuesday they must make their
own way in life.
   ``If you want something out of life, you have to go out and work
for it,'' he said. ``If you end up a nothing, blame yourself,
because that's just what you wanted to be _ a nothing.''

<BYLINE>Court: Mississippi Universities `Perpetuate a Stigma of
Inferiority'</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>By GINA HOLLAND</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JACKSON, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal appeals court ruled that
vestiges of segregation ``permeate'' Mississippi's public
universities 15 years after a lawsuit was filed to change the
system.
   The 2-1 decision by a 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals panel in
New Orleans overturned a lower court ruling in a lawsuit by blacks
over policies at Mississippi's five historically white and three
historically black universities.
   ``The badge of inferiority that marks black institutions has not
been removed,'' judges Irving Goldberg and Sam D. Johnson wrote in
the decision released Tuesday. ``As such, there remains in
Mississippi's higher educational system vestiges of discrimination
which distort the perceptions of black students.''
   Unfortunately, they wrote, ``this case lingered, loitered and
lulled for more than a decade'' without adequate changes.
   Hours after the ruling, state leaders of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People appealed to
students and administrators of traditionally white-dominated
schools to be more accepting of black students.
   ``Racism is America's Number 1 problem. This ruling about
Mississippi gives a true portrait of Mississippi, but in any other
state the ruling could have been the same,'' said state NAACP
president Aaron Henry.
   He said whites had not worked as hard as blacks in the
desegregation effort that began when a court ordered the University
of Mississippi to enroll James Meredith, its first black student,
in 1962.
   ``The willingness of the black communities to adapt to their
(white) presence is more than the whites are willing to accommodate
blacks,'' Henry said.
   In his dissent, Judge John Duhe said Mississippi had fulfilled
its legal obligation to open its universities to all students,
regardless of race.
   ``The majority, relying on district and other circuit court
decisions, has ... imposed upon the state the same constitutional
duty required for primary and secondary education, where freedom of
choice is unavailable and services are free of charge.''
   The State College Board can ask the panel to reconsider the
ruling, or can request an opinion of the full 15-member court.
   Board attorney Bill Goodman said he would withhold comment until
after the ruling is reconsidered.
   Aubrey Lucas, president of University of Southern Mississippi,
said: ``My first reaction was one of regret that we were unable to
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the courts some very significant
progress has been made.''
   Historically white Southern Mississippi, Delta State,
Mississippi State, Mississippi University for Women, and the
University of Mississippi enjoy distinct advantages over
historically black Alcorn State, Jackson State and Mississippi
Valley State universities, the panel ruled.
   ``Vestiges of de jure segregation permeate the public university
system of Mississippi,'' the majority decision said. ``Admissions
policies, the racial composition of the faculty and administration,
funding practices, academic offerings and mission designations all
perpetuate a stigma of inferiority.''
   More than 99 percent of the state's 26,953 white college
students were enrolled in historically white institutions during
the 1985-86 school year, while 71 percent of 12,826 black students
were enrolled in historically black schools, the court said.
   Mississippi spent an average $1,351 in 1960 and $8,516 in 1986
per student enrolled at historically white institutions. The
average at historically black schools was $718 in 1960 and $6,038
in 1986, the court said.
   The lawsuit was filed in 1975 by Jake Ayers of Glen Allen on
behalf of his son, Jake Ayers Jr., a high school student, and 20
other black students.
   The elder Ayers has died and his son, now 32, moved to Oklahoma
after dropping out of junior college to join the Air Force. His
mother, Lillian Ayers, said she has another son who will graduate
from high school this year.
   ``Hopefully he will benefit from the change,'' Mrs. Ayers said.
   The court sent the case back to U.S. District Judge Neal B.
Biggers Jr., who had dismissed the lawsuit in 1987, declaring
Mississippi's university system sufficiently desegregated.
   The appeals panel called for the lower court's re-hearing to
include testimony from psychologists, sociologists and other
professionals.
   ``Windows must open to ventilate the courtroom with ideas from
the winds of truth,'' it said. ``To this end, testimony,
depositions, cross-examinations and opinions can assist. Only then
should the parties come forth with a definite plan for'' achieving
desegregation.

<HEAD>Contras Remove Bermudez as Top Commander</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD COLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Enrique Bermudez was ousted as top Contra military
leader after weathering years of in-fighting and accusations of
corruption, human rights violations and close ties to the hated
Somoza regime in Nicaragua.
   A clandestine Contra radio station announced Bermudez' ouster
Tuesday in a broadcast from Central America, military spokesman
Alejandro Acevedo said in Miami.
   Bermudez's position as chief of the military in northern
Nicaragua has been eliminated, and rebel forces will be run by the
rebels' joint chiefs of staff, headed by Israel Galeano, Acevedo
said.
   The move, which came at a meeting Monday, was intended as a
signal to Nicaragua's leftist government, Acevedo said, and did not
represent a rejection of Bermudez.
   ``In a democracy, military officers do not rule for life,'' he
said, contrasting Bermudez's departure with the continued military
rule of Ortega in Nicaragua.
   Bermudez, 57, long considered a hard-liner, has run the
U.S.-backed Contra army in one post or another since it was formed.
Monday, the officers decided he would remain a military officer,
but with no current responsibilities, the spokesman said.
   Just under 10,000 Contra soldiers and about 50,000 family
members are living in camps in Honduras, just north of the
Nicaraguan border.
   Galeano, whose nom de guerre is Commander Franklin, pledged in
December to place his troops in ``defensive positions,'' limit
violence and support international observer groups in advance of
Nicaragua's elections Feb. 25.
   The Contra reorganization followed accusations by the Sandinista
government and some human rights organizations that Contra troops
under Bermudez's command killed two nuns, one a U.S. citizen, in an
attack on a church vehicle in northern Nicaragua last month.
   The Contras have strongly denied responsibility for the nuns'
deaths, blaming Sandinista troops for the attack.
   Bermudez also was accused in a lawsuit filed in Miami last week
of ordering his troops to torture and kill an American engineer,
Benjamin Linder, who had been helping the Sandinistas build a dam
in Nicaragua. The Contras say Linder, 27, of Portland, Ore., died
in a firefight, and was in uniform.
   Bermudez was the military attache in Washington under the
government of former dictator Anastasio Somoza Debayle when the
Sandinistas overthrew the government in 1979.
   He assumed the position of leader of the U.S.-supported Contra
troops when the force was created by the Reagan administration, and
accounts by former Contras have reported him as being a favorite of
the CIA and the supply network set up by former White House aide
Oliver North.
   Despite the reports criticizing Bermudez as too close to
Somoza's National Guard, he outlasted other Contra civilian and
military leaders.
   When he joined the seven-member ruling directorate as military
coordinator in July 1988, several commanders on the Contras'
southern front quit in protest.
   The directorate was abolished by military officers after it lost
U.S. funding last year.

   Lynda Beams doesn't care if Geraldo Rivera
interviews men in lace panties, topless donut shop operators, or
teen-age satanic murder cultists _ just not in front of her kids,
please.
   ``It's soft-core pornography,'' says Mrs. Beams.
   She would like the show taken off the air, but will settle for
it being moved from an after-school time slot.
   ``It's an adult talk show and it airs when most adults are at
work and children are at home,'' she said.
   Mrs. Beams heads a national grassroots movement against Rivera's
program, one of several such loose groupings that have arisen in
recent years to battle objectionable TV shows.
   Last year a Michigan woman, Terry Rakolta, persuaded three
corporations to pull ads from Fox network's ``Married ... With
Children,'' which Rakolta complained was full of gratuitous sexual
innuendo.
   Other companies withdrew advertising from ``Saturday Night
Live'' in response to complaints about an episode in which the word
penis was repeatedly used.
   Many viewers are complaining about ``Geraldo,'' and some
stations are listening.
   Rivera publicist Jeff Erdel said ``Geraldo'' is being carried by
199 stations in all but a few network TV markets, up from 162
stations a year ago. But 25 percent of the stations have let Rivera
know they're not happy with his show, Erdel said.
   Rivera and the show's producers have pledged a return to ``more
substantive issues'' in an effort to win back sponsors and viewers,
but some stations are holding out on renewals.
   ``We haven't quite decided about `Geraldo,''' said Joe Bell,
program director of KDFW in Dallas, which lost numerous sponsors
for the show after Mrs. Beams contacted them. She asked that the
program be rescheduled from 4 p.m., but so far the station has
refused.
   In Augusta, Ga., WAGT moved ``Geraldo'' from 5 p.m. to 10 a.m.
in September after sponsors pulled out because of viewer
complaints, led by Claire Tankersley.
   Mrs. Tankersley said she boiled after her 4-year-old watched a
``Geraldo'' show in which a prostitute graphically described being
sexually abused as a child.
   ``I was so horrified and aghast that something like that would
be on at 5 p.m.,'' Mrs. Tankersley said. ``I'm not for censorship,
but I just don't think that kids should be exposed.''
   ``Sounds familiar,'' said Jeffrey Ulrich, program director of
WROC in Rochester, N.Y., which had so many complaints about
``Geraldo'' last year that it canceled the program with three
months left on the contract.
   ``The opposition we were receiving on the show was tremendous.
`Geraldo' really raised a stink here,'' Ulrich said.
   KNSD in San Diego took ``Geraldo'' off the air last month
because advertisers withdrew, said station controller Jay Belbey.
   Mrs. Beams started her campaign against ``Geraldo'' after seeing
a show in which Rivera interviewed guests about bestiality.
   ``He asked them if they had had sex with animals,'' she said.
``I turned it off.''
   Other shows that raised viewers' ire include:
   _ ``Men in Lace Panties''
   _ ``Kids Who Murder in the Name of Satan''
   _ ``When the Other Woman is a Man''
   _ ``Kiddie Porn Underground''
   ``I don't think it's wrong that some of these issues are
addressed,'' said Ulrich. ``But it's the way `Geraldo' exploited
them. Phil Donahue could cover them and you wouldn't get the same
complaints. Geraldo's problem lies in his exaggeration and
sensationalism.''
   Last month, at the National Association of Television Program
Executives convention in New Orleans, Rivera and his producers
courted program directors with promises of a more substantive
``Geraldo.''
   Executive producer Martin M. Berman said the show ``went a
little wild'' during the November ratings period, when it was
competing for viewers in 125 markets against ``The Oprah Winfrey
Show.''
   ``We were pandering, and I'm changing to preserve my own
reputation,'' Rivera recently told Electronic Media, an industry
publication.
   Erdel pointed to a show last month about migrant farm workers as
evidence of a reformed ``Geraldo.'' He said stations are showing
``very strong support'' and advertisers are coming back.
   ``That's all fine,'' said Ulrich. ``But I think he's going to
have a hard time getting program directors and station managers and
viewers to believe `Geraldo' is going to be any different.''

   Former Mayor Frank Rizzo says he hasn't
quite decided to seek a third term as mayor, but is leaning toward
running.
   ``I haven't made up my mind yet,'' the 69-year-old Republican
said Tuesday in clarifying a previous report that he had decided to
run.
   ``I have all kinds of options, and that's one of my options, and
I'm leaning that way a little. I've been watching this great city
disintegrate and fall apart, and it needs my type of leadership to
bring it back.''
   Rizzo, now a local radio talk-show host, served two terms from
1972 to 1980 as a Democrat and lost to Mayor W. Wilson Goode in a
Democratic primary in 1983. He switched parties to run again in
1987, losing to Goode by 18,000 votes in the city's closest
election in 20 years.

<TEXT>
   The World Bank signed an agreement with
Mexico that gives the country $2 billion in credits to reduce its
$93 billion foreign debt.
   The accord, signed Tuesday, is part of a larger agreement signed
to back a debt refinancing package with foreign creditor banks.
   Treasury Secretary Pedro Aspe signed the accord for Mexico,
along with Syed Shahid Hussain, vice-president of the World Bank
for Latin America, the government said in a statement.
   The agreement was based on the World Bank's support for Mexico's
agreement with creditor banks on refinancing the foreign debt, the
statement said. The $2 billion credit is the largest ever granted
to Mexico by the World Bank. Of the amount, $1.26 billion will go
toward guaranteeing the payment of interest on new loans and the
rest will guarantee principal.
   On Sunday, Mexico signed a refinancing agreement with the
creditor banks that cut the country's $48.5 billion bank debt by
more than $7 billion and will reduce annual interest payments by
$1.6 billion.
   It was the first major debt renegotiation under U.S. Treasury
Secretary Nicholas Brady's plan to ease the debt burden for Third
World debtors. Agreements for smaller amounts were made with Costa
Rica and the Philippines.
   As part of Sunday's agreement, the World Bank and International
Monetary Fund agreed to give Mexico credits to back up the pact.
   Aspe said Mexico's total foreign debt now stands at $93.6
billion, second among creditor nations only to Brazil, which owes
$114 billion.

<HEAD>Two Charged with Breaking into Nine-State 911 Emergency Phone
Network</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A computer hacker broke into the 911 emergency
telephone network covering nine states in the South and another
intruder passed on the access data to other hackers, authorities
said.
   Robert J. ``The Prophet'' Riggs, 20, of Decatur, Ga., and Craig
M. ``Knight Lightning'' Neidorf, 19, of Chesterfield, Mo., were
indicted Tuesday by a federal grand jury and accused of computer
crimes, said acting U.S. Attorney Ira H. Raphaelson.
   He said Riggs was a member of the so-called Legion of Doom
hackers group, whose members are involved in numerous illegal
activities.
   Riggs and two other alleged members also were indicted Tuesday
in Atlanta and charged in other computer break-ins.
   The government would not say if any emergency calls were
disrupted or whether other damage was done during the tampering.
   ``These were not teen-agers playing games,'' Raphaelson said.
``They are thieves, they're reckless and they're dangerous.''
   In the Chicago case, Riggs is accused of entering Atlanta-based
Bell South's 911 system with a computer, stealing a copy of the
program that controls the system and publishing this data on a
hackers' computer bulletin board in Lockport.
   Neidorf is accused of transferring the data to his computer at
the University of Missouri in Columbia, where he allegedly edited
it for a computer hacker publication known as PHRACK.
   There was no immediate comment from either defendant. Directory
information had no listing for Riggs, and there was a recorded
message at the Neidorf residence. Neidorf's attorney, Art Margulis,
said he had not seen the indictment so he could not comment.
   Raphaelson said industry specialists estimate that $3 billion to
$5 billion is lost yearly to computer fraud. He said this is the
fourth hacker case brought by the federal government in the past
year.
   Bell South's 911 controls emergency calls to municipal police,
fire, ambulance and emergency services in Alabama, Mississippi,
Georgia, Tennessee, Kentucky, Louisiana, North Carolina, South
Carolina and Florida.
   ``People who invade our telecommunications and related computer
systems for profit or personal amusement create immediate and
serious consequences for the public at large,'' said Raphaelson.
   He said the 911 data was valued at nearly $80,000, but would not
say how a hacker could profit by stealing this data, other than by
selling the information to others.
   Riggs, if convicted on all charges, could be sentenced to 32
years in prison and fined $222,000. Neidorf could be sentenced to
31 years and fined $122,000 on conviction.
   Riggs and Neidorf are charged with interstate transportation of
stolen property, wire fraud and violations of the Computer Fraud
and Abuse Act of 1986.

<HEAD>Scotland Yard Advised Rushdie Not to Make Public Appearance</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Author Salman Rushdie said he nearly emerged from
hiding to deliver a speech on censorship but was dissuaded by the
Scotland Yard guards protecting him from Islamic militants.
   Today, a group of British writers condemned the continued threat
to Rushdie's life.
   On Tuesday night, Rushdie's friend, playwright Harold Pinter,
read his condemnation of the impact of religious fundamentalism on
freedom of expression to 200 people at London's Institute of
Contemporary Arts.
   Police guarded the building and security guards searched
handbags and screened the audience with metal detectors.
   Rushdie said his Scotland Yard guards persuaded him not to make
his first public appearance since the late Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini on Feb. 14, 1989 said Rushdie blasphemed Islam in his
novel ``The Satanic Verses'' and deserved to die.
   ``I did ... ask my admirable protectors how they would feel if I
were to deliver my text in person,'' Rushdie wrote in the lecture.
   ``The answer was, more or less, `What have we done to deserve
this?' With regret, I took the point.''
   Rushdie, 42, said he recognized people's profound need for
religion, but said it ``must surely remain a private matter.''
   Rushdie, a British citizen, was born into a Moslem family in
India but renounced his faith as a youth.
   After Khomeini's death call, two Moslem clergymen in Iran backed
Khomeini's call by offering $5.2 million for Rushdie's death. His
publisher, Viking Penguin, has also been threatened, and the stress
of a life in hiding led to a separation from his wife, American
novelist Marianne Wiggins.
   ``It is an agony and frustration not to be able to re-enter my
old life,'' Rushdie wrote.
   The lecture follows a 7,000-word essay Rushdie wrote for The
Independent on Sunday newspaper defending his novel, denying
blasphemy, and appealing to moderate Moslems to reconsider their
opposition.
   Sher Azam of the Council of Mosques in Bradford, northern
England, a stronghold of anti-Rushdie feeling, said Tuesday night
that Rushdie missed an opportunity to come out of hiding ``and show
that he wants an end to this very sad episode.''
   The president of Britain's Royal Society of Literature, Lord
Jenkins; the chairman of the society and writers, including John
Mortimer, David Hughes and Penelope Lively, condemned the
continuing threat to Rushdie's life.
   In a letter in today's issue of The Independent, daily sister
newspaper of The Independent on Sunday weekly, they wrote: ``We
join with those who say it is the right of all people to express
their ideas and beliefs and to discuss them with their critics on
the basis of mutual tolerance, free from censorship, intimidation
and violence.''

   What do a metal soap box, an electronic
billboard flashing messages, giant cracks in a plaza, bricks
inscribed with speeches and an ``autonomous nation'' inside a
6-inch circle have in common?
   They are five proposed works of art named as finalists Tuesday
in a contest to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the free speech
movement at the University of California, Berkeley.
   Four of artists were infants in 1964, when the movement was born
on the Berkeley campus. The movement became the model for a decade
of civil rights and anti-war protests across the nation after the
university banned campus political activities.
   ``No one answer is correct when depicting the idea of free
speech, certainly not one from people in authority,'' said Charlie
Schwartz, a physics professor who dreamed up the project last year.
   The Berkeley Art Project, a group of artists, professors and
protest veterans will commission the selected work with $70,000 in
private donations.
   The committee that selected the finalists said the proposals
would be refined and possibly modified. They reserved the right to
combine several of the ideas.
   The winner will be announced after the proposals are displayed
at the University Art Museum through March 3. The public can
register their favorite with ballots.
   The finalists were Peter Popielarski of New York, soap box;
Lauren Ariel Weingarten, Boston, billboard; Nathaniel Quincy
Belcher, Oakland, Calif., cracked plaza; James M. Rosen, Augusta,
Ga., bricks; and Mark Brest van Kempen, San Francisco, ``autonomous
nation.''

   Former GI Arnold Kephart spent his
first evening at home in America in 30 years celebrating after the
army decided not to court-martial him for deserting to East Germany
in 1960.
   ``The mood here is happy _ quiet and happy,'' said Kephart's
brother-in-law, Arlo Dunbar. ``Arnold is just relaxing and
visiting.''
   It was a warm, low-key ending to a saga that began last week,
when Kephart was arrested as he arrived in Omaha, Neb., from East
Germany. Kephart was granted a less-than-honorable discharge
Tuesday at Fort Sill, Okla., and flew back for a tumultuous reunion.
   ``I've been eating my stomach full,'' Kephart said Tuesday
night. ``I can't explain just how happy I am to be back in the
United States.''
   Kephart gathered with his family at the home of Dunbar and
Dunbar's wife, Flossie. Kephart's 86-year-old father, Ernest, was
among those celebrating his return.
   Kephart's 12-year-old son, Frankie, returned with him from East
Germany but was left with relatives in the Omaha area while the
Army weighed his father's case.
   ``We've got to give them a few days to get settled, then we've
got to start thinking about a school for Frankie,'' Mrs. Dunbar
said.
   She said the famly had been anticipating Kephart's return since
the Berlin Wall came down.
   ``That was my first thought when I heard the news about the wall
_ that Arnold would come back,'' she said.
   About 40 relatives, friends and well-wishers greeted Kephart on
Tuesday as he stepped off the plane from Oklahoma in Omaha.
   The returning deserter's first welcome had been every bit as
emotional, only ``this time, nothing's going to stop us,'' Kephart
sobbed as he hugged his father and sister.
   ``I won't ever think about going back to East Germany,'' he
said. ``I'm going to Dad's place now, and I'm never going to let
him go.''
   ``It's just wonderful,'' Ernest Kephart said through tears as he
hugged his son. ``I can't believe it.''
   Kephart was declared absent without leave in November 1960 while
he was a private stationed in Heidelberg, West Germany.
   According to Kephart's account, he was driving back to his base
from France when his truck crashed. There were three corked bottles
of French wine in the truck, he said.
   ``In the crash, the wine got broke up on our uniforms. The
police, they thought that we had been drunk. ... We didn't have one
single drink from the wine,'' Kephart said.
   He said his superiors told him he would be sent to prison and
would have to pay for the truck. He eventually escaped.
   He headed for East Germany because a girlfriend ``said I'd be
safe over there.''
   Kephart's ex-wife, Brigitte, who is Frankie's mother, and his
twin 8-year-old daughters Kathleen and Katharina remain in
Schmalkalden, East Germany. He said he wanted them to come to the
United States as well.
   Kephart's discharge will be finalized when he receives the
papers from the Army, which his lawyer said should be by week's end.

<TEXT>
   The bus driver is being held as a possible
accomplice in the terrorist attack on a busload of Israeli tourists
that clained the lives of nine Israelis and left 20 people wounded,
newspapers reported today.
   Saeed Abdel-Raouf, a Palestinian who gained Egyptian
citizenship, fell under suspicion after witnesses said he stopped
the bus at once when masked gunmen signaled him to do so Sunday,
with no warning shot fired, said the newspaper Al-Ahram.
   When Abdel-Raouf appeared on state-run television Monday night,
he said he was taken by surprise and stopped the vehicle after
hearing a ``bang'' he thought came from a tire explosion.
   The masked men attacked the bus with machine guns and hand
grenades on a desert road between Cairo and the Suez Canal city of
Ismailiya.
   According to infrmation available to police, Al-Ahram reported,
the attack was carefuly planned abroad and carried out in Egypt by
three gunmen in addition to the bus driver. Earlier reports spoke
of two gunmen.
   Reports in Al-Ahram and other Cairo newspapers identified the
man who rented the white Peugeot station wagon used in the attack
as Akram Deeb Ihab, a 34-year-old Palestinian with a Jordanian
passport.
   Al-Akhbar newspaper said Ihab arrived in Egypt on Jan. 21 and
left a week later. A photograph of him was printed on the front
pages in Al-Ahram and Al-Gomhouria.
   Al-Ahram said about 60 suspects, mostly Palestinians, and a
number of Egyptian non-commissioned police officers were held for
questioning. It said their fingerprints were being compared with
those found at the scene and on the abandoned white Peugoet.
   Police sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said those
held included a Palestinian believed connected with the ambush but
not as a gunman.
   Al-Ahram quoted police sources as saying the guns, grenades and
ammunition used in the assault were smuggled into Egypt from abroad.
   The newspaper said about five policemen boarded the bus in
Rafeh, a divided city on the border with Israel in the Sinai
Peninsula, and left the bus when ordered out by the attackers.
   The terrorists had asked Egyptian hitchhikers on the bus to get
out before they opening fire on the Israelis.
   The only other Egyptians aboard were the driver and the tour
guide, who was wounded in the attack. The bus had been carrying 31
Israeli tourists, only two of whom escaped harm.
   A spokesman at the Interior Ministry, which is responsible for
internal security, refused to discuss the newspaper reports.
   ``We will talk only after making arrests,'' he said, indicating
that no formal arrests or charges had been made.
   Al-Akhbar ran on page one a statement attributed to Ahmed
Jibril's Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestinian-General
Command claiming responsibility for the attack.
   It said the claim was broadcast Tuesday over Libyan state radio.
Monitors in London, however, said they heard no such statement. The
official Libyan news agency did not carry the claim.
   Two Arab groups earlier claimed responsibility for the bus
attack.
   One, in Cairo Sunday night, was made by an anonymous caller to a
Western news agency who said he spoke for the previously unknown
Organization for the Defense of the Oppressed in Egyptian Prisons.
   In Jordan, a handwritten message sent Monday to the French news
agency Agence France-Presse claimed the assault was carried out by
an obscure group calling itself Holy War-Jerusalem.
   The AFP office received a telephone call on Tuesday reasserting
the claim.
   ``Our young men all over the world are going to hit again,
strongly and painfully,'' the caller said, adding that the bus
attack ``is an answer to the killing of our people in the occupied
territories.''
   A senior Jordanian official in Amman said Ihab ``is not a
Jordanian'' but was from Rafah refugee camp in Gaza.
   Israel has occupied the Gaza Strip and the West Bank since
seizing them in the 1967 Middle East war. Many Gaza Palestinians
have carried Jordanian passports since 1967 but are not considered
citizens of Jordan, which does not hold that a passport is a
certificate of citizenship.
   More than 650 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiers
or civilians since an uprising against the occupation began on Dec.
8, 1987. Forty-three Israelis also have died.

   A Republican lawmaker who describes herself
as a ``holy roller'' was excluded from her Baptist church for
sponsoring an abortion-rights bill.
   A letter from the First Baptist Church said it denied state Rep.
Stephanie Micklon a family membership because her ``outspoken
public position in regard to abortion brings disgrace on Jesus'
name.''
   Mrs. Micklon, who was baptized and married at the church, called
it ``religious blackmail.''
   ``I'm not pro-abortion. It is not an insignificant phrase,'' she
said Tuesday. ``I am pro-choice, and now they're saying that is a
sin.''
   Micklon said she knows of no official church stand that a
pro-choice position is grounds to deny membership.
   ``We're Pentecostal,'' she said. ``You're talking to a holy
roller here.''
   ``We are not questioning your relationship to Christ or your
salvation,'' the pastor and Board of Deacons wrote in the recent
letter. That, Micklon said, is ``all they should be questioning.''
   She said she and her husband were married and baptized in the
church, but had attended another church until several years ago.
Last summer, the pastor suggested reaffirming their membership in
the Salem church.
   ``They said there would be no problem,'' she said.
   Last fall, she sponsored legislation to allow abortions at a
woman's discretion until the 25th week of pregnancy. The bill
prohibits abortion after the 25th week unless a doctor deems it
necessary to protect the life of the mother, or the fetus has an
abnormality.
   The Micklons have a disabled child and Micklon said she based
her position on abortion on their experience.
   First Baptist's pastor, the Rev. Clement Sutton III, said the
church board discussed Micklon's case at length.
   ``We felt that if the Scriptures confirm the sanctity of life,
the legislation was immoral,'' Sutton said. ``Where Stephanie has
so publicly stated her issue, we had to make a choice. Is it proper
to take in someone who makes a stand on an issue that is
unbiblical? We couldn't before God and a good conscience recommend
her for membership.''
   The First Baptist Church of Salem is part of the American
Baptist Churches-U.S.A., with headquarters in Valley Forge, Pa.
Sutton said some church members had been arrested in protests
organized by Operation Rescue, the nationwide anti-abortion group.
   Roman Catholic politicians who support abortion rights have come
under criticism from their church. In California last November, a
bishop denied communion for then-state senate candidate Lucy Killea
for her abortion-rights stand. She was narrowly elected the
following month.

   Moslem militants hurled a grenade at a
police bunker in downtown Srinagar today and strafed the post with
automatic rifle fire, witnesses said.
   At least six policemen and two bystanders were hurt in the
attack, said the witnesses, who spoke on condition of anonymity. It
was not immediately known how many militants were involved in the
attack or if any of them were wounded when police returned fire,
they said.
   In another part of the city, a bomb believed planted by the
militants exploded in a post office. There were no injuries, other
witnesses said.
   On Tuesday night, suspected militants blew up a truck, injuring
one person who was sleeping in the vehicle, witnesses said.
   The attack on the police post was the latest in a series of
confrontations between security forces and militants fighting for
secession of the Kashmir valley from Hindu-dominated India.
   At least 77 people have been killed since authorities launched a
crackown on the movement Jan. 20. Most of the victims have been
Moslems who were shot and killed for defying curfew orders.
   Srinagar is the summer capital of northern Jammu-Kashmir state.
   Jammu-Kashmir is India's only Moslem majority state; 65 percent
of its 5 million people are Moslems. Nationwide, Moslems comprise
12 percent of the population of 880 million.
   The campaign for an independent Kashmir is four decades old but
has flared in recent months. The valley is claimed by both India
and Pakistan, and New Delhi has accused Islamabad of fomenting the
trouble.
   Pakistan has routinely denied the charges but says the Kashmiri
people have a right to self-determination.

<TEXT>
   Rock singer Billy Idol had just completed an
album called ``Charmed Life'' when he ran a stop sign and crashed
his motorcycle into a car, suffering serious leg and arm fractures,
authorities said.
   Idol, 34, whose hits include ``White Wedding'' and ``Rebel
Yell,'' was not wearing a helmet during Tuesday morning's crash on
his Harley-Davidson, police said.
   He was listed in serious but stable condition at Cedars-Sinai
Medical Center today after seven hours of surgery to repair the
right lower leg, which sustained a compound fracture, and his right
forearm, hospital spokesman Ron Wise said.
   Doctors discovered during surgery Idol's arm was broken, he said.
   Idol also suffered some cuts on the back of his head, police
Officer Don Lawrence said.
   Idol was in Hollywood when he ran a stop sign and hit a car, the
officer said. He said Idol will be issued a citation for failure to
obey a stop sign, which usually results in a fine.
   The car's 31-year-old driver, whose name was not released, was
not injured.
   Idol's publicist, Ellen Golden, said the singer was heading home
after just completing the album at Conway Studios in Hollywood.
   It was not immediately known if the accident would affect Idol's
plans to begin filming in three weeks in director Oliver Stone's
motion picture about the Doors rock band, Ms. Golden said.
   Idol was to play a close friend of the late lead singer Jim
Morrison, she said.
   It also was unknown whether Idol's plans to release ``Charmed
Life'' in late April and launch a concert tour in July would be
affected, Golden said.
   Idol, with blond spiked hair, tight leather garb and curled lip,
personifies the bad boy rock 'n' roll image. He is best known for
his 1984 album ``Rebel Yell,'' which produced hit songs including
the title track, ``Eyes Without a Face'' and ``White Wedding.''
   His other hits include ``Dancing with Myself'' and ``Mony Mony''
off his first album, ``Don't Stop.''
   He was most recently seen as part of the Who's ``Tommy'' tour.
   In November 1988, Idol was among Hollywood rockers who held a
benefit concert to raise money to help find the motorist who ran
down and killed a motorcycle-riding friend, dance club disc jockey
Lee Selwyn.
   Idol is one of many Hollywood and Malibu entertainment
personalities known for riding motorcycles, often without helmets.
Among them were actors Gary Busey, who has recovered from severe
head injuries sustained in a December 1988 crash, and James Caan,
who suffered broken ribs and a broken collar bone two months later.
   Busey had opposed laws requiring helmet but has since changed
his mind for younger riders.

   A mandatory briefing on sexual violence for new students also
was among the other measures recommended by a task force created to
resolve problems raised in the survey released Tuesday.
   Vice Chancellor Stanley Levy created the 13-member task force _
including students, faculty and community members _ in September,
after viewing preliminary results of the survey on rape at the
campus, which has an undergraduate enrollment of 25,950.
   The survey, conducted last spring, found that 16.4 percent of
the 537 women who responded said they had been raped. That is in
the same range as two 1985 college studies on the topic _ one at
the University of South Dakota and another conducted on 32 college
campuses.
   Another 23 percent said they were victims of sexual abuse, which
meant fondling or touching.
   ``We're talking about acquaintance rape and men in fraternities
or in campus housing who are sexually abusing women,'' said Laurna
Rubinson, an associate professor of health who headed the task
force.
   Levy and Ms. Rubinson said colleges across the country face the
same problems.
   The study showed a strong relationship between sexual violence
and alcohol use.
   Sixty-six of the 88 women who reported being raped answered
questions about alcohol use. Of them, 80 percent said the men
involved in the attacks had been drinking at the time, and 70
percent of the women said they themselves had been drinking.
   Ideally, alcohol consumption on campus and at tailgate parties
outside sporting events would be banned, Ms. Rubinson said.
   But the school is more likely to increase the number of
non-alcoholic social events for students, Levy said. The school
allows drinking on campus by students who are 21 or older.
   The school may also consider a proposal to ban performances by
the Illinettes, an all-female pompon squad that performs at
football and basketball games, and other activities ``that project
women as sexual objects,'' the report said.
   Other proposals likely to face opposition included requiring a
resident director _ generally an older student _ at all
fraternities, which were singled out by Ms. Rubinson as the worst
source of sexual violence against women.
   Levy defended fraternities and noted that they have instituted
new rules of conduct on their own, including banning keg parties.

<HEAD>Storm Lashes Northwest; Heartland Enjoys Warm Temperatures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Jet-stream winds breezed into the southern Plains and
Mississippi Valley today, bringing unseasonably warm weather, and a
lingering Pacific storm lashed the Northwest with rain,
thunderstorms and gusty winds.
   Alaska entered its 11th day of deadly cold with no relief in
sight. Lows of minus 55 were recorded Tuesday at Ambler, Bettles
and Tanana, Alaska.
   Snowfall across western Oregon on Tuesday included 6 inches or
more in the northern coastal range and up to 10 inches in the
Cascade Mountains, where more than a foot and a half of snow has
fallen since the weekend. Storm warnings were posted today across
the Washington Cascades and Olympic Mountains.
   The storm dusted low-lying valleys with snow, creating icy roads
that were blamed for two deaths caused by skidding vehicles in
Oregon. Lightning near the state's southern coast knocked out radio
and television transmitters.
   Warmer temperatures were expected from the Gulf states to the
lower Great Lakes, with forecasts calling for temperatures from
northern Texas to central Indiana and Illinois to be 20 degrees
above normal.
   Rain soaked the Gulf Coast from Texas to Mississippi on Tuesday.
   Snow blanketed areas from the Pacific coast to western Wyoming.
Rain in the Northwest extended across central California, with rain
changing to snow in higher elevations.
   Record highs for the date Tuesday included 45 degrees at Devils
Lake, N.D.; 59 at Beckley, W.Va.; 63 at Bluefield, W.Va.; and 67 at
Roanoke, Va.
   The nation's hot spots on Tuesday were Miami, Fla., and
Presidio, Texas, with 80 degrees.
   Milo, Maine, was Tuesday's coldest spot in the Lower 48 with 26
below zero.

<HEAD>Congressman Said to Comply With Male Hooker's `Business'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The male prostitute who ran his business out of
the Washington apartment of Rep. Barney Frank said the congressman
didn't mind until his landlord found out.
   ``I suggested it; he OK'd it,'' Steve Gobie said Tuesday, at a
news conference to promote an article in Penthouse magazine on his
relationship with Frank and the sexual underlife of the capital.
   Frank has said he fired Gobie as his aide and driver when he
learned how his apartment was being used. But Gobie said Frank knew
not long after the two met in April 1985 and he moved into Frank's
apartment, where he received his phone calls and clients.
   ``I couldn't have done it without him knowing about it,'' Gobie
said. ``It's virtually impossible _ the answering machines were
connected to the telephones.''
   Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat, issued a statement Tuesday
saying, ``Gobie's press conference and article are recycled lies
with some additional sensationalism, apparently to justify
Penthouse paying him a $50,000 fee.''
   Gobie said he and Frank parted after the landlord confronted the
congressman about the activity in the apartment.
   ``He was angry because the landlord found out, not because he
didn't know it was going on,'' Gobie said. ``It wasn't just phone
work that was going on, it was actually individuals coming in and
out of the place.
   ``He was aware of that. He'd call and make sure it was OK for
him to come home, if he was due to come home at an inopportune time
during the day.''
   Gobie, 33, said he has testified for five hours before the House
ethics committee, which is probing Frank's conduct. He declined to
say what kinds of questions he was asked or what he told the
committee.
   Frank, 49, has acknowledged that he paid Gobie for sex the first
time they met. But he says he soon befriended Gobie and hired him
to be a personal aide and driver.
   Gobie declined to divulge how much Penthouse paid him.
   He has said, and Frank has denied, that the congressman at one
point offered him $10,000 to $12,000 to leave Washington and make a
new start in Florida.

<HEAD>U.S. Civil Rights Leader Says He Hopes To See Mandela Freed</HEAD>
<HEAD>By LAURINDA KEYS</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson, beginning a
visit to South Africa, said today he hoped to see Nelson Mandela
``walking down the streets of Johannesburg'' before his 12-day trip
ends.
   The U.S. civil rights leader, granted a visa by the government
after several rejections in the past decade, planned to meet
President F.W. de Klerk and Foreign Minister Pik Botha as well as
leaders of the anti-apartheid movement.
   At an airport news conference, Jackson declined to say if he had
requested a meeting with Mandela, the African National Congress
leader who is expected to be released soon after more than 27 years
in prison.
   ``I have no commitment from the government to meet him,''
Jackson said. ``I hope to see him walking down the streets of
Johannesburg. The whole world hopes to see him free.''
   On Friday, in a widely hailed speech, de Klerk lifted a 30-year
ban on the ANC, scrapped other restrictive measures and pledged to
free Mandela promptly.
   ``This is a moment in South Africa's history that must be
seized,'' Jackson said. ``If the government moves back, there will
be chaos ... But if the government seizes the political moment and
moves forward, we will see the dawn of a new, free and democratic
South Africa.''
   He said he had set two goals for the trip _ to encourage unity
among black political factions and to ``address the unfounded fears
of the whites.''
   Asked whether he favored continuation of sanctions against South
Africa, he replied: ``The real issue is to end apartheid. Sanctions
will end with apartheid.''
   De Klerk gave ``a great speech,'' he said, but ``apartheid is
still in place, the caution is that Nelson Mandela is still in
jail.''
   The Afrikaner Resistance Movement, a neo-Nazi white supremacist
group, has threatened to mount protests against Jackson but only a
handful of right-wing demonstrators were seen at the airport and
they obeyed police orders to avoid displaying placards.
   Jackson and his wife, Jackie, were welcomed by senior leaders of
the anti-apartheid movement, includuing Walter Sisulu, an ANC
colleague of Mandela's, and church leaders Allan Boesak and Frank
Chikane.
   On Tuesday, Botha suggested it was an inopportune time for
Jackson to visit because of the rapid political changes taking
place.
   Botha also complained that Jackson alternates his statements on
sanctions depending on his audience. Botha said Jackson has told
South African officials he favors an end to punitive sanctions,
while appealing in public speeches for added sanctions.
   ``The time has come when Jesse and I must talk straight to each
other,'' Botha said.
   He said Jackson's visit has nothing to do with the release of
Mandela, because the decision has already been made. ``He can enjoy
the aftermath, but not claim any credit,'' Botha said.
   Mandela, 71, has been in jail since 1962 and is serving life
imprisonment for planning the start of the ANC's sabotage campaign
against the government.

<HEAD>Tallahassee Mayor Returned to Office; Mayoral Election Set for
Tulsa</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The black woman mayor of Tallahassee, Fla., was re-elected by a
landslide and the incumbent mayor of Tulsa, Okla., easily won the
Democratic primary in his bid to be returned to office.
   Mayor Dorothy Inman won 60 percent of the votes Tuesday in
Tallahassee, where voters cast ballots for the city commission.
Investment broker Wayne Harris was the closest challenger, with 19
percent. The mayor's office is rotated among commission members
every year.
   Two of the mayor's five white male opponents made openly racist
appeals to the city, which is 25 percent black. They were Jim Fair,
72, who received 3 percent of the vote, and Duane Doty, 68, who got
less than 2 percent.
   In Tulsa, Mayor Rodger Randle and Republican Frank Pitezel
easily won primaries and will face each other in April 3 general
elections.
   Randle, elected in 1988 to serve a two-year term, received
nearly 75 percent of the vote against three challengers. Pitezel, a
state representative, received 63 percent of the GOP vote.

<HEAD>State Proposes $910,220 in Fines For Bridge Collapse</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The state has levied a record $910,200 in
fines against a contractor involved in the rush-hour collapse of a
bridge being built over a busy Baltimore-Washington highway.
   The accident Aug. 31 injured four motorists and six workers.
   The Maryland Occupational Safety and Health Office cited the
J.P. Smith Co. of Edgewater for 128 ``willful'' violations of
safety codes, the most serious type of violation, in what the
agency called ``a gross disregard for public safety.''
   The contractor has 15 days to appeal the fines.
   Among the violations cited was the use of 112 screw jacks of
inferior size and strength to support steel towers that held the
bridge in place.
   ``Anyone with construction experience had the ability to
instantly recognize that this was not the equipment that was
supposed to be used,'' Craig D. Lowry, the agency's enforcement
chief, said Tuesday.
   Screw jacks rated to hold 10,000 pounds, instead of the 25,000
pounds specified in plans approved by federal engineers, were used,
he said.
   The largest penalty previously proposed by the state agency was
$68,000 for a fatal trench cave-in in October.
   John P. Smith, president of J.P. Smith Co., said last month that
he assumed the equipment supplier had provided materials that met
plan specifications. The contractor is rebuilding the overpass.
   A federal Transportation Department panel in December blamed the
collapse on inadequate equipment and materials used contrary to
approved plans.
   MOSH also issued a single ``serious'' citation totaling $720
against Highlights Corp. of Towson, a subcontractor on the project,
for alleged failure to inspect equipment and supports before the
concrete was poured for the bridge.

<HEAD>Health Group Head Says More Than 700 Romanian Children Have AIDS
Virus</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The head of AIDS programs for the World Health
Organization said today that medical teams have determined more
than 700 children in Romania are infected with the AIDS virus.
   ``The situation appears more serious even than we had thought,''
said Dr. Jonathan Mann. ``The number of infected children now
exceeds 700 and it's clearly a very serious situation. We are
mobilizing the resources to deal with it, but I am afraid it is
worse than we thought.''
   He said a WHO medical team is still trying to ``figure out
exactly how this has happened and, particularly, what steps must be
taken immediately to stop this now.''
   ``It is a preventable tragedy,'' Mann said on ABC's ``Good
Morning America'' program. ``This need not have happened. We now
need to make sure that nothing more happens of this kind.''
   Mann said the major route of spread apparently was the use of
untested AIDS-infected blood and the repeated use of needles and
syringes on children without sterilizing them between uses.
   Earlier this week Dr. Jacques Lebas, president of the
Paris-based Doctors of the World, urged the international health
community to provide Romania with disposable needles and
blood-screening equipment.
   Mann said his organization is ``undertaking an initiative'' with
all the countries of Eastern Europe ``to determine the scope of the
problem, determine what needs to be done and do it, because AIDS is
a reality now in Eastern Europe.''
   Mann was asked whether he expected to find other situations
similar to that in Romania.
   ``Let's hope that we don't ever have to see something like this
again, but I'm afraid that as we look further into the countries of
Eastern Europe with the ministries of health, that we are going to
find evidence of more infection than was previously discussed,
particularly in countries like Poland and Yugoslavia,'' said Mann.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome attacks the body's immune
system, leaving victims vulnerable to a wide variety of infections
and cancers. A person can carry the human immunodeficiency virus,
which causes AIDS, for years without developing the disease. But
almost all cases lead to the disease.

   The pro-apartheid Conservative
Party said today it will stage protests and strikes to drive
President F.W. de Klerk from power and block his plans to share
power with blacks.
   Koos van der Merwe, chief spokesman for the Conservatives, the
main white opposition party, said de Klerk deceived South African
whites by suddenly legalizing the African National Congress
guerrilla movement and more than 60 other anti-apartheid groups.
   He said de Klerk's National Party would not be able to retain
power in the face of a white backlash.
   The Conservatives are pushing for a new election. If de Klerk
rejects that proposal, the party would organize ``stay-at-home''
campaigns or general strikes that would bring the country to a
halt, van der Merwe said.
   ``We will keep the pressure on him ... until he has no choice
but to call a general election,'' he said.
   If large numbers of whites joined a general strike, they could
bring the government to a standstill, halt most transportation and
shut down businesses, schools and hospitals.
   On Friday, de Klerk lifted the ban on the ANC and other
opposition groups and partially lifted the state of emergency as
part of a plan to begin negotiations that would bring the
disenfranchised black majority into the government.
   The president also said the government would soon release Nelson
Mandela, the jailed ANC leader, unconditionally. But he did not
give a date.
   On Tuesday, a leading anti-apartheid activist said the
government's drive for peace could be jeopardized by its delay in
releasing Mandela.
   ``He must be released soon or de Klerk will lose momentum,'' the
Rev. Allan Boesak said after meeting with Mandela for more than
three hours at Victor Verster prison farm north of Cape Town.
   Boesak said Mandela wants the government to lift the state of
emergency and free all political prisoners, including those
convicted of violent acts, but would accept freedom whether or not
the demands are met.
   He said Mandela considered de Klerk's speech ``bold, courageous
and hopeful,'' but did not believe it had cleared the way for talks
between the government and the ANC.
   The Rev. Jesse Jackson, beginning a visit to South Africa, said
today he hopes to see Mandela ``walking down the streets of
Johannesburg'' before his 12-day trip ends.
   At an airport news conference, the civil rights leader declined
to say if he had requested a meeting with Mandela, saying only that
``I have no commitment from the government to meet him.''
   Jackson was recently granted a visa after several rejections in
the past decade.
   Van der Merwe said today that the National Party tricked the
white electorate by stating during the election campaign last year
that it would not deal with ANC because of its guerrilla campaign.
   ``Mr. de Klerk and his political Cabinet are a lot a crooks,''
he said.
   The Conservatives won 31 percent of the vote in September's
election compared to 48 percent for the National Party.
   However, the Nationalists won 93 of the 166 white parliamentary
seats, compared to 39 for the Conservatives. The other seats went
to the liberal Democratic Party.
   Van der Merwe said whites would never accept majority rule
because it would result in the 28 million blacks dominating the 5
million whites. He predicted whites would now flock to the
Conservative Party, which seeks to establish separate states for
whites and blacks.
   ``We demand the right of self-determination. We do not want to
be dominated by the ... blacks,'' he said.
   The Conservatives have launched a major membership drive and
plan hundreds of rallies to demand a new election. The campaign
will culminate with a massive rally in Pretoria in May to demand
that de Klerk step down, van der Merwe said.
   He said the Conservative Party stands for Afrikaner nationalism
and is not racist. Afrikaners, the Dutch-descended settlers of
South Africa, account for about 3 million of the 5 million whites.

<HEAD>Communist Leaders Agree to Give Up Monopoly on Power, Delegate
Says</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Combines previous, edits to tighten.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Communist Party leaders today agreed to surrender
their monopoly on power guaranteed by the Soviet Constitution,
allowing rival parties to compete for the first time in seven
decades, a delegate said.
   The reported vote by the powerful party Central Committee was a
victory for President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who had urged his
fellow party members to face voters and earn the right to rule.
   Svyatoslav Fyodorov, a famed eye surgeon and participant in the
three-day meeting in the Kremlin, said the committee agreed to
support abolishing the constitution's Article 6, which guarantees
power to the Communist Party.
   ``Article 6 will no longer be, there will be a multiparty
system. There will be a normal democracy,'' Fyodorov said.
   Both hard-line Communists and reformers had criticized
Gorbachev's platform, with hard-liners complaining he was going too
far and reformers saying he failed to go far enough.
   Populist leader Boris N. Yeltsin cast the only vote against the
platform, Fyodorov said, apparently because it was not radical
enough. Yeltsin on Sunday addressed a huge crowd that gathered
outside the Kremlin to demand reforms, and he promised to present
the demands to the Central Committee.
   There also was one abstention, Fyodorov said.
   There were few major changes in the document Gorbachev presented
to the Central Committee on Monday, he said.
   The 249-member Central Committee was joined in the meeting by
more than 700 other officials from around the Soviet Union, and all
were allowed to vote on the platform, he said.
   The official news agency Tass said debate at the closed meeting
resumed today but did not give details.
   Sources inside the Central Committee meeting said the
policy-making body would recommend to the Supreme Soviet parliament
that it delete Article 6.
   The Supreme Soviet could take up the issue at its meeting next
week, or after the party's Congress, which the Central Committee
agreed to move up to summer from October.
   In either case, final authority rests with the Supreme Soviet's
parent legislative body, the Congress of People's Deputies. At its
last meeting in December, the Congress of People's Deputies heeded
Gorbachev's plea and blocked an effort by reformers to strike
Article 6.
   But since then, Gorbachev said it would be ``no tragedy'' if a
multiparty system develops in the Soviet Union. He told the Central
Committee on Monday that rather than relying on constitutional
guarantees, the party must prove its worthiness to govern.
   The Central Committee, which had been scheduled to meet only two
days, continued to consider how to deal with the breakaway party in
Lithuania, which split from the national Communist Party in
December.
   When Gorbachev extended the committee session late Tuesday, he
told the Central Committee he wanted its work done by
mid-afternoon, but the group was unable to meet that deadline.
   Gorbachev and his advisers were turning their attention after
the Central Committee meeting to the arrival later today of U.S.
Secretary of State James A. Baker III.
   Most speakers during debate Tuesday agreed the Communists must
end their political monopoly, but Gorbachev's plans for the party's
future _ and his tenure itself _ drew harsh criticism from
hard-liners.
   Yegor K. Ligachev, a leading orthodox Politburo member, was
warmly applauded Tuesday for a speech that blamed Gorbachev's
reform program for the country's dire economic situation and
nationalist upheavals, a committee source said.
   ``After somewhat of an enlivening in the first two years of
perestroika, the economy began to decline, inter-ethnic feuds
reached bloodshed, people began to experience fear, and in some
places there is practically dual power,'' Ligachev told the meeting.
   In his speech, quoted by Tass, Ligachev demanded that the party
platform emphasize the sacredness of party unity and said he firmly
opposes allowing private property, a demand of radical reformers.
   Tass quoted three influential Politburo members _ Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, Vitaly Vorontinkov and Vadim
Medvedev _ as backing Gorbachev's program, expressing emphatic
support for a strengthened presidency.
   Many people believe Gorbachev hopes to step down as party chief
in the Communists' anticipated fall from power and concentrate
authority in the presidency and popularly elected legislative
bodies.
   Shevardnadze rejected assertions that Gorbachev's liberalization
was to blame for the ouster of Communist regimes in Eastern Europe.
   ``It has been destroyed by the will of peoples who wished no
longer to tolerate coercion,'' Tass quoted Shevardnadze as saying.
   The committee's free-wheeling debate sharply contrasted with
previous sessions, when the Central Committee automatically
approved policies that had been worked out at higher levels.
   A decision to abolish the party's leading role _ and allow
competing parties for the first time since shortly after the 1917
revolution _ would represent a bold domestic gamble.
   It could send the discredited Soviet ruling party the way of its
fraternal Communist parties in Poland, East Germany, Czechoslovakia
and Hungary.
   On the local level, people across the country have recently
forced the ouster of Communist officials found to have used their
posts to obtain special food supplies and other perquisites
unavailable to the average citizen.
   People must wait in lines for scarce consumer goods, some of
which are rationed in some areas.
   Outside the Kremlin's Spassky Gate on Tuesday, Central Committee
member Vladimir P. Anishchev was asked about the consensus at the
gathering over the Communist Party's future. ``All unanimously
think it has become obsolete. It has no meaning,'' he said.
   Partial transcripts of Tuesday's session, in which 51 speakers
took the floor, indicated that Gorbachev's proposal satisfied
neither radicals nor hard-liners.
   The party has already been fragmented by December's defection of
its branch in Lithuania _ the republic leading the way in
secessionist efforts _ and Moscow radicals are proposing that it
break up into separate wings.
   Communist candidates are expected to fare poorly in local
elections this spring, and some progressives in the party want it
to set the democratic example by having all its leaders chosen by
secret ballot.

   Article 6 of the Soviet Constitution, which makes
the Communist Party the ``leading and guiding force of Soviet
society,'' is the key to the party's exclusive hold on political
power.
   It is part of the Constitution adopted Oct. 7, 1977, by a
special session of the Supreme Soviet under the leadership of the
late Leonid I. Brezhnev. It has been interpreted as ruling out the
creation of competing political parties.
   The Article says:
   ``The leading and guiding force of Soviet society and the
nucleus of its political system, of all state organizations and
public organizations, is the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.
The C.P.S.U. exists for the people and serves the people.
   ``The Communist Party, armed with Marxism-Leninism, determines
the general perspectives of the development of society and the
course of the home and foreign policy of the U.S.S.R., directs the
great constructive work of the Soviet people, and imparts a
planned, systematic and theoretically substantiated character to
their struggle for the victory of communism.
   ``All party organizations shall function within the framework of
the Constitution of the U.S.S.R.''

   The Japanese yen for things American has
extended to college campuses, with a tiny school here announcing a
seven-figure infusion of cash is on its way from Tokyo in exchange
for students.
   And Clemson University officials said the Japanese are
considering opening a branch of the South Carolina school, with
Japanese money, in Kiryu City, 65 miles from Tokyo. Japanese will
visit the campus this week.
   At Iowa's Westmar College, with an enrollment of 470, officials
announced that 100 Asian students will arrive in April and ``a cash
deposit of significant numbers'' will arrive this week.
   Westmar President Arthur Richardson said an agreement in
principle for the venture with Teikyo University of Tokyo was
approved by the college trustees over the weekend.
   ``Nothing is going to change at Westmar,'' Richardson said.
``We're just making the program bigger and better.''
   Richardson said the cash would be for upgrading the faculty. He
characterized the agreement as a ``merger'' with the Japanese
school, which has an enrollment of more than 13,000.
   ``Later this week, there will be a cash deposit of significant
numbers _ in the seven-figure range _ that will be available
immediately for faculty upgrade, in order to prepare to receive the
first 100 students the first week of April,'' Richardson said. He
said 200 to 400 students would arrive in the fall.
   Under the agreement, Westmar will keep a local board of
directors, Richardson said.
   The Japanese university already has agreements with Regis
College to buy its Loretto Heights Campus in Denver and with Salem
College in Salem, W.Va., to form Salem-Teikyo University.
   The American university branch in Kiryu City has a target
opening date of 1992, Clemson officials said.
   ``They're pretty serious about putting a United States branch
campus there,'' said Bobby Wixson, dean of Clemson's College of
Sciences. ``They haven't settled on us yet, but they will be
visiting our pertinent departments this week, and then our planning
committee will meet with them on specifics and see if the proposal
is mutually beneficial.''
   Classes there would be taught in English by American instructors
from Clemson and possibly other universities. Initially, 300
students could enroll, including 50 to 60 Americans.
   Students would be able to work toward a Clemson degree, then
come to the main campus in South Carolina for their junior and
senior years.

<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An IRA bomb exploded today in a
hangar at an aircraft and missile plant, causing no injuries and
little damage. The terrorist group said more attacks on the plant
would follow.
   A local radio station said the Irish Republican Army telephoned
22 minutes before the blast at the Short Brothers Ltd. plant to
warn that three 20-pound devices had been planted at the huge north
Belfast complex.
   A spokesman for Short Brothers said a bomb exploded in an area
of the complex where the company builds the Tucano Royal Air Force
training aircraft.
   The area of the plant was sealed off and an army bomb disposal
team sent in to see whether there were more devices, the Royal
Ulster Constabulary said. Flights at the nearby Harbor Airport were
halted during the inspection.
   The constabulary said it did not know the bomb's contents, but
news reports said it was made of Semtex, the Czechoslovak-made
explosive favored by the IRA.
   The IRA issued a statement later saying there would be further
attacks on plant but that no warnings would be issued ahead of time.
   It said that Short's workers are ``no different to contractors
and workers providing labor, materials and services for the British
Crown forces. They must recognize the consequences of their
involvement in such work.''
   The IRA has targeted several building contractors and their
employees in recent years, saying anybody who carries out any kind
of work or service for the security forces is a target.
   The financially troubled Short Brothers is the biggest employer
in Northern Ireland. It was state-owned until last year when it was
sold to Canada's Bombardier Inc., an aerospace company.
   In central Belfast, army explosives experts today blew up a
suspected car bomb, said a police spokesman. The car, hijacked
earlier, was abandoned outside a bank, and nearby shops and offices
were evacuated.
   The IRA is fighting to end British rule in Northern Ireland and
unite the predominantly Protestant province with the Roman Catholic
Republic of Ireland.

   Andrei Sakharov's brain has been sent to a
research institute that studied the brain of Soviet dictator Josef
Stalin, the official news agency Tass said today.
   Sakharov, a human rights activist, Nobel Prize winner and father
of the Soviet hydrogen bomb, was eulogized as the conscience of the
country when he died in December at the age of 68.
   The nuclear physicist's brain was sent to the Academy of
Sciences brain institute, which was founded as a laboratory to
study the brain of Soviet founder Vladimir I. Lenin in 1926, two
years after Lenin's death, Tass said, quoting the labor newspaper
Trud.
   Results of the research on the brains of Lenin and Stalin is
secret, institute Director Oleg Adrianov said. But he said he has
suggested to higher authorities that the research be made public.
   ``No brain of any political figure was sent to the institute
after the Stalin days,'' Adrianov said.

<TEXT>
   The Communist Party today released a document
urging increased cooperation with China's eight tiny non-Communist
parties while asserting that China will always be under Communist
rule.
   The release of the Dec. 30 document came as Communist parties in
Eastern Europe are abandoning their hold on power and Soviet
Communist Party leaders today agreed to surrender their
constitutionally guaranteed ``leading role'' in society, according
to a Central Committee delegate.
   China has not commented on Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
proposals to abolish the party's 70-year monopoly on political
power.
   Communist parties in East Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and
other Eastern European countries already have eliminated their
``leading role'' status.
   The Chinese document, however, stressed ``that China's
multiparty cooperation must uphold the leadership by the CPC,'' or
Communist Party of China, according to a paraphrase by the official
Xinhua News Agency. China's state constitution refers to the
Chinese people as being ``under the leadership of the Communist
Party.''
   In an apparent attempt to distance China from the pattern of
political reforms that has taken hold of Eastern Europe, the
document said China ``differs from the one-party system practiced
in some socialist countries.''
   The Chinese leadership has watched with concern the developments
of the past few months in Eastern Europe, particularly Romania,
where the revolution was violent. Some analysts have said China's
leaders hope to prevent a viable opposition from forming in their
own country by appearing to give the eight officially sanctioned,
non-Communist parties more influence in policy-making.
   The Communist Party has frequently called for more cooperation
with what it calls ``the democratic parties,'' but these parties
hold no real power and are considered rubber stamps for Communist
policy. Formed before the Communists took power in 1949, their
aging ranks number about 300,000, compared with the
48-million-member Communist Party.
   In a Dec. 28 speech to party elders, senior leader Deng Xiaoping
said, ``The democratic parties should be turned from flower-vase
parties into ones that take part in politics.''
   The newly publicized document appeared to be based on Deng's
comments, but does not change the non-Communist parties
traditionally subordinate role. The document also explicitly denied
the formation of other non-Communist parties.
   ``Political organizations that oppose the four cardinal
principles'' _ of socialism, people's democratic dictatorship,
Communist Party leadership and Marxism-Leninism-Mao Tse-tung
thought _ ``and endanger the state power are absolutely not allowed
to exist.''

<TEXT>
   An election recalling the chairman of the
Southern Ute Indian Tribe and four council members has been
overturned because an election official afraid of being placed
under a spell let a woman vote twice.
   Once the woman's second, illegal vote was thrown out Tuesday,
the election wound up a 182-182 tie, meaning Southern Ute Tribal
Chairman Leonard Burch and the other council members will stay in
office after all.
   The outcome of Friday's recall changed after Ruby Garcia,
chairwoman of the tribal election commission, disclosed that she
let Bertha Grove cast two ballots _ her own and one on behalf of
her imprisoned husband. A vote by proxy rather than absentee ballot
is illegal.
   Garcia said Grove ``said we `would not sleep''' that night if
the woman were not allowed to cast a ballot for her husband.
   ``I didn't know if that was some kind of voodoo,'' Garcia said.
She added that she was concerned the woman ``was going to put a
spell on all of us.''
   Recall committee members said they would challenge the recount
in tribal court.
   Renee Baca, recall coordinator, said her group would seek a new
election.
   Recall backers had accused the council of a lack of
accountability, raised doubts about the benefits of two water
projects and objected to the council's decision to cut from $3,000
to $1,500 a year the per capita payments made to tribal members
from oil and gas leases on their land.
   The tribe has 1,158 members and is based on a reservation in the
Four Corners area of Colorado, Utah, New Mexico and Arizona.

<HEAD>Republicans Hold Fund-Raising Lead Entering Election Year</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The national Republican Party had a dominant
fund-raising edge to begin the 1990 election year, holding $14.4
million on hand while the Democratic Party had $5.4 million in its
coffers.
   Federal Election Commission data also show the GOP dramatically
outspent the Democratic Party last year, with its three principal
national fund-raising groups spending $72.2 million compared to
$19.1 million for the Democrats. It was a costly off year for both
parties because of eight special congressional elections.
   The Republicans generated $80.4 million in contributions and
other receipts for those committees, with the Republican National
Committee taking in $30.6 million, the National Republican
Senatorial Committee $35 million and the National Republican
Congressional Committee $14 million.
   An analysis released Tuesday by the FEC showed some marked
improvement in the Democratic Party's fund-raising, particularly
when compared to other years immediately following a loss in a
presidential election.
   The Democratic National Committee actually began the year with
more money than the RNC _ $3.8 million compared to $1.5 million.
But the GOP's House and Senate campaign arms were far more
successful in raising money than their Democratic counterparts.
   The FEC report, based on the year-end disclosure reports of the
organizations, showed that all told the three principal Democratic
groups took in and spent $19 million.
   The Democratic National Committee, which ended 1988 with a
comfortable surplus in the $5 million range, reported receipts of
$6.8 million and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee said
it received $8 million. Those committees reporting spending of $8.4
million and $6.5 million, respectively, and both made huge
reductions in their debts.
   By contrast, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee had
1989 receipts of $4.1 million but reported spending $4.2 million
and a year-end debt of $1.6 million. It reported having just
$22,179 on hand to begin the year.
   While the Republicans enter this election year with more cash on
hand, Democrats have the power of incumbency in the majority of
House and Senate elections. Incumbents generally run well ahead of
their challengers in raising funds.
   Most of the $14.4 million in the three Republican war chests to
begin the year was with the NRSC, which reported having $10.6
million as of Dec. 31. The GOP hopes to chip away at the 55-45
Democratic majority in the Senate as part of a larger strategy that
banks on a re-election win by President Bush in 1992 and a coattail
effect that would return control of the Senate to Republicans.
   The GOP Senate committee spent $27 million of the $35.4 million
it received last year and reported $589,734 in debts as of Dec. 31,
about half its $1.1 million debt at the end of 1987, the last
comparable non-federal election year.
   The NRCC, the GOP's main fund-raising arm for House candidates,
spent $13.1 million of the $14.2 million it collected, according to
its year-end filing with the FEC. It held $2.3 million heading into
this year and reported debts of $794,654, up dramatically from the
$34,922 in red ink it reported two years ago.
   For all of the committees, the totals raised include
contributions and other receipts such as interest on bank accounts
and certificates of deposit.
   Separate FEC data on the special elections last year show nearly
$11 million was spent on the eight races. There were 41 initial
candidates in the eight elections and the 16 who survived for the
final, head-to-head contests accounted for $8.9 million of the
spending total.

   The government of this U.S.
territory asked President Bush to declare it a federal disaster
area after Hurricane Ofa devastated the Pacific island chain.
   Meanwhile, the governments of Australia and New Zealand pitched
in with military transport emergency airlifts on Wednesday to
Western Samoa, another of the South Pacific island chains hit by
the hurricane over three days.
   Australian dispatched a C-130 Hercules laden with as tents,
plastic sheets and tarpaulins ahead of several more relief flights
expected from Australia and New Zealand.
   In a letter Tuesday, Gov. Peter Tali Coleman asked for money to
help the American territory rebuild and recover from the hurricane,
which passed near the six islands. Ofa battered independent Western
Samoa with 115 mph winds before blowing out into open water on
Tuesday.
   Crops, roads, utilities, businesses and residences in American
Samoa were damaged, Coleman said. Damage could be as high as $100
million, officials said.
   The territory is under an austerity plan to reduce its $12
million deficit.
   ``I have determined that this disaster is of such severity and
magnitude that effective response is beyond the capabilities of the
teritorial government,'' Coleman wrote.
   The worst damage was reported in Western Samoa and Niue, about
450 miles south of Pago Pago. The Australian Associated Press said
three people were killed in Western Samoa, declared a disaster area
Sunday.
   Power and water have been restored to some parts of Pago Pago,
but about two-thirds of the 38,000 residents still were without
power and water Tuesday, said Joyita Viena of Lt. Gov. Galeia
Poumele's office.
   Fewer than 20 people in American Samoa received minor injuries
in the storm.
   ``We were very, very lucky the hurricane wasn't any closer,''
said Bob Blauvelt, chief engineer for government TV station KVZK.

<HEAD>Roh Calls for Development of South Korea's Military</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL SHIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Roh Tae-woo said today that
South Korea must further develop its military forces to prepare for
an eventual withdrawal of U.S. troops from the country.
   Roh made the remarks after receiving a briefing by the Defense
Ministry on various security problems South Korea is expected to
face in the coming decade.
   ``We must pursue the `Koreanization' of our defense. American
troops are here only to help us. We must be prepared to defend our
nation with our own blood and sweat,'' he said.
   In a report to Roh, Defense Minister Lee Sang-hoon said South
Korea will have to increase its defense spending substantially in
the coming years to prepare for an eventual U.S. troop pullout.
   The United States announced last week that it would close three
of its five air bases in South Korea in a cost-saving measure. The
decision will mean the withdrawal of 2,000 of the 43,000 U.S.
troops stationed in South Korea under a mutual defense treaty. But
officials in Washington have not said anything about the United
States pulling out the bulk of its forces.
   South Korean officials later indicated they expected to discuss
the withdrawal of some 3,000 more U.S. troops, all non-combatants,
when U.S. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney visits Seoul Feb. 14-17.
   Lee did not disclose the amount of defense spending South Korea
envisages in the coming years, but said his ministry would earmark
more funds for research and development to produce missiles, combat
planes, submarines and other sophiscated weapons in the early 2000s.
   South Korea, he said, spent only 1.5 percent of its defense
budget on research and development in 1980, but the amount will be
increased to 3 percent in 1996 and 7 percent in 2000.
   ``More spending on research and development will enable us to
develop next-generation weapons on our own,'' he said.
   South Korea depends almost entirely on the United States for its
weapons systems but the country recently has made impressive
progress in developing its own weapons, including new army tanks
more suited to Korean terrain.
   South Korean defense spending is fixed at 6 percent of its gross
national product. The GNP has expanded at an annual rate of 8
percent to 9 percent during the past decade. Last year's Korean GNP
was estimated at $194 billion.
   As a deterrent to what he called the growing North Korean
military threat, the minister said South Korea needs to maintain
close security relations with the United States and share more of
the costs of keeping U.S. troops here.
   He said, however, that South Korea also must be prepared for an
eventual pullout of all 43,000 American troops stationed in the
country. The withdrawal, if made, should be gradual, he added.
   Analysts saw Lee's remarks as indicating South Korea would
accept a withdrawal of American troops rather than taking on an
excessive financial burden to keep them.

   Covenant House named a former school
administrator today to take over the Rev. Bruce Ritter's duties
while the founder of the runaway shelter is investigated on
suspicion of having sex with teen-agers.
   The appointment of former New York City Schools Chancellor Frank
Macchiarola as acting president came as the New York Post reported
a fourth man has come forward to say he had sex with Ritter when he
was a teen-age runaway.
   The Franciscan priest who founded Covenant House and has seen it
grow into the nation's largest shelter system for runaways
reasserted his innocence Tuesday, even as he found himself the
subject of new charges.
   In a statement, Ritter said he had decided to take several weeks
off to rest and recuperate from stress. Later in the day, however,
church officials said they had instructed him to relinquish his
duties.
   Franciscan officials ``have directed Father Bruce to begin a
period of rest and recuperation without responsibility for Covenant
House until this inquiry is completed,'' their provincial leader,
the Rev. Conall McHugh, said in a statement. A spokesman said he
had no idea how long that may be.
   Ritter, 62, had not considered stepping down, a spokesman said.
   Covenant House said Macchiarola, schools chancellor from 1978 to
1983, would immediately assume Ritter's duties. Macchiarola has
served on the Covenant House board for five years.
   The events unfolded after The New York Times disclosed the
Franciscans' investigation of a former Covenant House client's
charges that Ritter had a sexual relationship with him in 1973,
when he was 14. Two other former Covenant House clients also have
accused Ritter of sexual misconduct.
   Ritter, who has campaigned against the sexual exploitation of
youngsters, characterized such charges as ``garbage,'' telling the
Times he ``never, never'' had sexual relations with any youth in
Covenant House.
   ``I am profoundly saddened by the allegations against me and the
need to deny them constantly,'' he said in his statement. ``I have
no way of proving my innocence. My accusers cannot establish my
guilt. I devoutly hope the inquiries currently under way will bring
an end to this incredibly painful chapter in my life.''
   In addition to the Franciscan investigation, the district
attorney is investigating Covenant House's use of funds and its
provision of false identification to at least one youth.
   Covenant House conceded Monday it had provided a former male
prostitute with a new identity, that of a 10-year-old boy who died
in 1980. It admitted acting without the knowledge of the boy's
parents, saying it had sought to protect the ex-prostitute, Kevin
Kite, from enemies.
   It has refused to say how it obtained the documents Kite, now
26, says he was given: a certified copy of the boy's birth
certificate and a falsified copy of his baptismal certificate.
   Kite is one of those now making charges against Ritter. In
December, the New York Post reported his allegations that he had an
eight-month sexual relationship with the priest beginning a year
ago. He said Ritter gave him money, housing and gifts in exchange
for sex.
   Ritter has denied the charges, and Kite's father stepped forward
to describe his son as a chronic liar.
   At a Dec. 14 news conference, Ritter warned that ``copycats''
might make charges similar to Kite's. However, the new accusations
from two other men appear to predate the December disclosure.
   The Village Voice newspaper reported Jan. 24 that John Melican,
now of Seattle, charged in an unpublished interview in 1986 that he
had a 13-year sexual relationship with Ritter. Melican repeated the
charges to the Times, saying the relationship began when he was 13.
   Darryl Bassile, 31, of Ithaca, charged that he had sexual
relations with Ritter in 1973, the Times said. It said notes by
Bassile's psychotherapist show that he complained about Ritter in
April.
   Bassile said he complained to the Franciscans after hearing of
Kite's charges in December.
   Today, the Post said Paul Johnson, 33, had a homosexual affair
with Ritter when he was a teen-age runaway.
   Johnson, who was sentenced in 1986 in Los Angeles to a year in
jail for corporate fraud, told the Post: ``No one else in this
country is doing as much to help kids on the street. He helped me a
lot. But I also have to say that I have deep-rooted hatred for the
way he manipulated me.''
   Covenant House has an $87 million budget, running 17 shelters
with more than 2,000 beds in the United States, Canada and Latin
America. The Times said it planned to expand this year, but
donations, after tripling in four years, have declined since
December, and the plans are on hold.

nearly $500 million in U.S. aid headed for defeat today at the
hands of the voters.
   Early returns showed about half of the voting Palauans supported
a Compact of Free Association and subsidiary agreements with the
United States, but the results were falling short of the required
75 percent.
   With 23 percent of the vote counted from Tuesday's polling, 51
percent opposed the compact and 49 percent approved. Final results
weren't expected until at least Friday.
   Vice President Kuniwo Nakamura, who backed the compact, conceded
it would fail.
   As a result, Palau will continue as the world's last U.N.
trusteeship under U.S. administrative authority. Ten other
territories formed in 1947 under the trusteeship system have
achieved independence or self-government.
   The United States captured the islands in 1944 from Japan.
   The plebiscite was the seventh in seven years on the pact and
its subsidiary agreements, already U.S. law.
   Before the latest plebiscite, Sen. J. Bennett Johnston, D-La.,
ha asked the Department of Interior to re-examine its policy toward
Palau if approval wasn't attained. Interior officials have said
they may bolster their presence.
   Palau is a collection of 200 volcanic islands, the westernmost
cluster of six major groups making up the Caroline Islands. An
estimated 15,000 people live on its eight inhabited islands, about
500 miles east of the Phillipines city of Mindanao and 4,500 miles
southwest of Hawaii.
   Several factors apparently led to the no vote, perhaps foremost
among them anti-nuclear sentiment. One of the provisions on the
ballot would have allowed U.S. nuclear-capable aircraft and vessels
to transit Palau.
   Larry N. Gerston, a San Jose State University political science
professor, found a strong anti-nuclear feeling in an exit survey of
1,235 Palau voters.
   Of ``no'' voters, 49 percent said it was because of the
possibility of U.S. nuclear materials in Palau, Gerston said.
   Another 35 percent said they voted ``no'' because there was not
enough money in the pact.
   It was not immediately clear what Palau's government would do
next.
   In a Jan. 29 letter to Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan, Johnston
recommended that Interior officials exercise greater law
enforcement and financial management of Palauan affairs.
   Nakamura said the government would persist in trying to get the
compact approved, perhaps by holding a referendum to lower the 75
percent requirement to a simple majority.
   ``The status issue must be resolved, if possible, this year,''
he said. ``It is the most important issue facing the republic.''

   Arizona's voter-approved ``Official English'' law
is kaput. Finis. Finito. Terminado.
   U.S. District Court Judge Paul Rosenblatt threw out the law on
free speech grounds Tuesday, and Gov. Rose Mofford _ the only
person with legal standing to appeal _ said she would let the
ruling stand.
   ``I am happy the courts ruled it unconstitutional,'' Mrs.
Mofford said in a brief statement. She said she considered the law,
which made English the state's official language, ``flawed from the
beginning.''
   Backers of the measure said the Democratic governor should
appeal the decision, noting a state court had upheld the measure's
constitutionality last year and because similar laws in 16 other
states had been allowed to stand.
   Republican state Attorney General Bob Corbin said he believed
any ruling that changes the state's constitution should be appealed
as high as possible, but he said he would abide by Mrs. Mofford's
decision.
   The initiative, approved 580,830-569,993 in the 1988 election,
required state and county governments to conduct all business in
English, with certain exceptions in education, public health and
safety, the justice system and federal election law.
   The judge said the amendment would have forced lawmakers,
officials and judges ``to either violate their sworn oaths to obey
the state constitution ... or to curtail their free speech rights''
in such cases as talking with foreign-speaking constituents and
performing marriage ceremonies.
   He said the amendment was ``substantially overbroad'' and
``invalid on its face in violation of the First Amendment'' of the
U.S. Constitution.
   The ruling came on a lawsuit by Maria-Kelly Yniguez, a state
Department of Administration employee, and state Sen. Jaime
Gutierrez, a Democrat.
   Ms. Yniguez, who evaluates and arbitrates medical malpractice
claims, said the law inhibited her constitutional right to free
speech and threatened her job if she used Spanish while speaking
with co-workers.
   Gutierrez, who represents a partially Hispanic district in
Tucson, said the law could block him from communicating effectively
with constituents.
   Rosenblatt dismissed Gutierrez from the case on technical
grounds but said Yniguez was justified in her concerns.
   ``I'm just very happy,'' Gutierrez said. ``If you can write that
I'm jumping up and down, that's just what I'm doing.
   ``I thought it was a longshot,'' he added. ``It took a lot of
courage on the part of the judge. I hope the decision can be used
nationwide, but we'll just fight the battles one at a time.''
   Supporters of the law said the decision should be appealed to
the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco.
   Last April, the U.S. Supreme Court instructed that court to
dismiss a challenge to a rule that generally requires Los Angeles
city court employees to speak only English while at work. The
justices decided to take such action because the woman who
challenged the rule no longer works for the court.
   The legal meaning of ``official English'' amendments in some
states is far from clear. In Colorado, the governor and mayor of
Denver ordered bilingual government information to still be
provided. And in Florida, the Legislature has taken no steps to
pass laws that put voter-approved English-only provisions into
effect.

   The Vatican secretary of state arrived
today for a visit to be highlighted by the formal restoration of
diplomatic ties, which Hungary severed 45 years ago when the
Communists assumed power.
   Hungary becomes the second East bloc country in less than a year
to re-establish relations with the Vatican after enacting
democratic reforms. Poland restored ties in July.
   During his five-day visit, Cardinal Agostino Casaroli planned to
sign the agreement announced Tuesday.
   Also Tuesday, Hungary annulled a 1950 accord that limited the
number of Roman Catholic seminaries and religious orders, the
country's official MTI news agency reported.
   The government plans to cancel similar agreements with other
churches in line with a freedom of conscience law enacted in
January, the MTI report said.
   The dramatic improvement in the Vatican's relations with Eastern
European countries was further underlined Tuesday by the nomination
by Pope John Paul II of a new bishop in Czechoslovakia.
   The bishop, Jan Chryzostom Korec, had been imprisoned in the
1960s under a predecessor of the hard-line Communist government
ousted in November's peaceful revolution.
   Negotiations between the Vatican and Hungary for restoring ties
have been going on for months and both sides had agreed Pope John
Paul II would visit the country next year.
   In addition to signing the agreement, Casaroli will take part in
ceremonies unveiling a statue of the late Cardinal Josef
Mindszenty, who was sentenced to life imprisonment for treason in a
Stalinist show trial in 1949.
   Mindszenty, who became a symbol of church opposition to
communism, was freed from prison by Hungarian revolutionaries
during the 1956 uprising. After the revolt was crushed by Soviet
tanks, Mindszenty took refuge in the U.S. Legation in Budapest,
where he remained until the Vatican and Hungary worked out an
agreement in 1971. He died in Vienna in 1975.
   The ousted Czechoslovak Communist regime had been among the most
hostile to the Roman Catholic church in Eastern Europe, blocking
the nomination of new bishops for 15 years.
   But Prague's non-Communist government has said it wants to
restore ties with the Vatican, and the Polish-born pope plans to
visit in April.
   With a series of recent appointments, including the nomination
Tuesday of Korec in Nitra, only four of 13 dioceses lack bishops.
   The announcement noted that Korec was secretly consecrated a
bishop in 1951, a practice used by the church to ensure it has a
hierarchy in a country where it can't operate freely. Korec, 66,
spent eight years in prison and then was barred from working as a
bishop.

   The tourism minister today became the
fourth member of the provisional government to resign, accusing the
National Salvation Front of ``dictatorial methods'' reminiscent of
the previous Communist regime.
   As an army officer, the resigning minister, Mihai Lupoi, played
a key role in the Dec. 22 revolution that toppled dictator Nicolae
Ceausescu. He appeared in the studio of the besieged television
building and issued the first public appeal by an officer to the
army to join the revolt.
   Lupoi's resignation follows those of Silviu Brucan, the front's
controversial foreign policy expert and ideological guru, front
spokesman Aurel Dragos Munteanu, and its interim vice president,
Dumitru Mazilu.
   The 36-year-old former army architect, who was promoted to the
rank of major after the revolution, said in an interview he is also
resigning from the military.
   The National Salvation Front took charge in the
post-revolutionary chaos, and has ruled by decree ever since. It
has been under pressure from inside and outside of Romania to
become more democratic, and recently agreed to share some power
with other political parties on a new National Unity Council to
rule until multiparty elections in May.
   Lupoi said his resignation resulted from ``differences'' with
Prime Minister Petre Roman on both personal and professional
matters.
   His original letter of resignation, submitted to Roman on
Tuesday afternoon, contained a sharp denouncement of the
leadership's methods.
   He maintained that his attempt to reorganize the Ministry of
Tourism was impeded by ``excessive government bureaucracy,''
``dictatorial methods in the relationship between the government
and the ministry'' and ``an improper and ill-defined division of
responsibility between the government and the front.''
   Lupoi said that at a meeting Tuesday evening, other ministers
accused him of ``trying to take the people into the streets''
against the front, and attempted to head off his resignation by
firing him instead.
   Eventually, he said, he agreed to resubmit a more moderate
version of his letter, and the resignation was accepted this
morning.
   Lupoi contended that the front had to accept a multiparty
democracy ``because of popular demand, but they don't like it.''
   On Tuesday, the front officially registered to run in the May 20
elections, with interim President Ion Iliescu expected to lead the
ticket.
   The front originally promised only to rule until the elections,
but reversed its stand two weeks ago. It is considered the
front-runner in the race against 29 political parties.
   Dan Radulescu, chief of the front's Commission for Press and
Public Relations, said: ``Our candidate for president will be Mr.
Iliescu, that's for sure. That's what everyone wants.''
   The front agreed to form a Council of National Unity with
opposition parties to run the country until Romania's first
multiparty elections since World War II. The council is to meet for
the first time Friday.
   In its platform released Tuesday, the front said its aim is
``realization in Romania of a democratic society based on political
pluralism, the separation of powers in the state, the assurance of
liberty and human dignity.''
   It also said it sought to guarantee ``the inviolability of human
rights, the respecting of the rights and liberties of all national
minorities, the guarantee of freedom of religion.''
   The platform included membership guidelines and an outline of
the party's structure. It bars from membership anyone convicted of
crimes against the revolution.
   The platform made no mention of the Communist Party. Last month,
the front announced it would outlaw the party. Then it decided to
submit the question to a referendum, only to cancel the vote a
short time later.

   Surgeons operated by candlelight and
emergency rooms used water boiled on kerosene stoves today as
fighting between rival Christian forces plunged east Beirut into
more desperate conditions.
   In the ninth day of a showdown over control of Lebanon's
Christian enclave, Gen. Michel Aoun regrouped his army troops for a
major assault to dislodge Samir Geagea's Lebanese Forces militia
from its besieged strongholds.
   Geagea pleaded with President Francois Mitterrand of France ``to
act swiftly to arrange an immediate halt to the hysterical
killing,'' which has claimed about 365 lives and wounded 1,682, by
police count.
   Police said scores of the wounded, mostly civilians, were dying
at hospitals due to scarcity of antibiotics and other medicines.
   Aoun's 20,000 troops and the 6,000-member militia are fighting
across densely-populated residential districts, seeking to control
the 310-square-mile Christian enclave.
   The Hotel Dieu and Saint Joseph hospitals, the largest medical
centers in Christian east Beirut, said in separate statements that
they would bury about 30 victims in mass graves today. The bodies
were decomposing in morgues due to a total power failure.
   A police spokesman, who cannot be named in line with
regulations, said surgeons were carrying out operations in several
hospitals with ``candlelight in desperate efforts to rescue the
victims.''
   ``Most hospitals have run out of diesel oil to operate their
power generators. They are back to the 19th century methods of
boiling water on kerosene stoves for the operation rooms,'' the
spokesman said.
   French Humanitarian Minister Bernard Kouchner and Ambassador
Rene Ala negotiated a 90-minute cease-fire along a narrow street
needed to evacuate 12 seriously wounded from two hospitals.
   At 9:30 a.m., a seven-ambulance convoy dashed across the divided
city's museum crossing to evacuate the wounded from the Hotel Dieu
and Saint Joseph hospitals as the factions exchanged sniper fire
overhead.
   The convoy drove the victims out of the Ashrafiyeh district to
Beirut airport in the Syrian-policed Western sector, where a French
plane waited to fly them for treatment in Paris.
   At one point, the convoy passed a white Mercedes. Its driver lay
dead in the road beside his car.
   The police spokesman said the intensity of clashes had decreased
since Aoun achieved his most significant victory in the
confrontation, flushing Geagea's men out of the Dbaye hills they
controlled north of Beirut late Tuesday.
   The spokesman said the general was massing tanks, commando and
infantry units for major attacks on Geagea's men in east Beirut's
besieged districts of Ashrafiyeh and Ein Rummaneh.
   Aoun, the police spokesman said, also was massing large numbers
of tanks in mountainous regions northeast of the capital in
apparent preparation for a push west to rescue his helicopter base
at Adma, where an estimated 500 commandos are withstanding a siege
by the Lebanese Forces.
   President Elias Hrawi on Tuesday asked for foreign support for
whatever move he might make to try to stop the fratricide,
indicating he might use the mostly Moslem, Syrian-backed units of
the army to stop Aoun.
   A source in Moslem west Beirut, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said Hrawi was considering a plan to help contain the
fighting. The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
first part would be a ``political move'' that depends on Geagea.
   The respected An-Nahar daily newspaper said Geagea, in a move
aimed at rescuing his militia, might declare territories he
controls in Kesrouan, Byblos and Batroun provinces north of Beirut
``loyal to President Hrawi.''
   Hrawi's 22,000-strong troops, backed by 40,000 Syrian soldiers,
control 70 percent of Lebanon, excluding the Christian enclave and
the similar-sized territory Israel occupies in south Lebanon.
   Allowing Hrawi's authority to spread in Geagea's regions would
strip Aoun of about half of the Christian enclave he is fighting to
control.
   Hrawi was elected by Parliament in November as part of a peace
plan designed to end the 15-year-old Christian-Moslem civil war.
   Hrawi dismissed Aoun as military chief, but the general, who
rejects the peace plan and does not recognize the president, has
refused to relinquish his command.
   Aoun, Geagea and Hrawi are Maronites, the Catholic community
that has dominated Lebanese politics since independence from France
in 1943.

   An anonymous jury deliberating whether John
Gotti ordered a union leader shot listened again to the murky tape
recordings on which the government built its assault case against
the reputed mob boss.
   The jurors, who have been sequestered since the start of the
case and whose identities have been kept secret to guard against
jury tampering, reheard the 11 secretly recorded tapes in their
first day of deliberations Monday.
   Deliberations resumed this morning.
   The tapes, recorded at Gotti's hangout and in a jail visiting
room, include conversations in which he allegedly says, ``We're
gonna, gonna bust him up,'' and another in which members of the
Westies gang allegedly say they shot union leader John F. O'Connor
as a favor to Gotti.
   The defense has ridiculed the tapes as inaudible and claims
prosecutors transcribed them to suit their theory. Defense
attorneys Bruce Cutler and Gerald Shargel contend Gotti is being
persecuted because of his reputation.
   Gotti, a barrel-chested man known as the Dapper Don because of
his expensive, double-breasted suits, is reputed to be the boss of
the Gambino crime family, the nation's most powerful criminal
organization.
   Gotti, 49, and Anthony Guerrieri, 61, are accused of
commissioning the Westies, an Irish-American gang from New York's
Hell's Kitchen section that did strong-arm work for the mob, to
shoot O'Connor in 1986.
   The former vice president of a Carpenters Union local was
wounded in the buttocks.
   Assistant District Attorney Michael Cherkasky said Gotti
arranged the shooting because O'Connor had goons trash a mob-run
restaurant being built with non-union labor.
   If convicted, Gotti could face 25 years to life in prison
because of prior convictions.
   Acting Justice Edward McLaughlin told the jurors Monday that
they could convict the defendants only if the prosecution proved
they arranged the shooting and not simply because they might be
members of organized crime.
   ``You do not have to answer to anybody but yourselves regarding
the verdict,'' McLaughlin said.

   Coast Guard officers who boarded the
Exxon Valdez as it created the nation's worst oil spill asked Capt.
Joseph Hazelwood to explain the problem, and a witness said he
replied: ``You're looking at it.''
   Defense attorney Michael Chalos suggested that Hazelwood's reply
referred to the overall situation on the crippled tanker.
   But Exxon Valdez chief radio officer Joel Roberson, who related
the statement in court Tuesday, disagreed with that interpretation.
   ``I took it to mean that he meant himself,'' Roberson said.
   Minutes after Hazelwood's interrogation, a Coast Guard commander
came to his radio office to use a phone, Roberson said.
   ``I overheard the commander saying, `I smelled alcohol on his
breath. I want a technician out here,''' Roberson recalled.
   Blood tests on Hazelwood taken 10{ hours after the tanker ran
aground, showed a blood-alcohol content 0.061 percent, lower than
many states' driving 0.1 limit but above the 0.04 federal limit for
operating a commercial vessel.
   Superior Court Judge Karl Johnstone suggested out of the jury's
presence that the prosecution was failing to address a critical
issue _ whether there was liquor found aboard the Exxon Valdez that
night. If no liquor was found, he said, it would mean that
Hazelwood's blood-alcohol level might have been much higher earlier
in the evening.
   The first two days of testimony in Hazelwood's criminal trial
have focused on his alcohol consumption in the hours before the
ship set out on its doomed journey. Shortly after midnight last
March 24, the tanker hit Bligh Reef, spilling more than 10 million
gallons of oil into Prince William Sound. The disaster killed
thousands of fish, birds and animals and blackened hundreds of
miles of shoreline. Exxon has said it spent more than $2 billion on
the cleanup.
   Roberson remembered being jolted from his sleep by a rumbling
but said he didn't immediately realize the ship had grounded.
   ``I sensed that it was something very serious,'' he said. ``I
noticed vapors enough to make my eyes water. I noticed the ship was
listing.''
   When he went above, he said, ``There was a stream of water
shooting up into the air on deck about 40 to 50 feet high.''
   Soon, he said, ``There was a commotion of people coming
aboard,'' including the Coast Guardsmen who were met by Hazelwood.
   ``One gentleman asked what the nature of the problem was,'' said
Roberson. ``Captain Hazelwood said, `You're looking at it.'''
   Hazelwood, 43, of Huntington, N.Y., is being tried on a felony
charge of second-degree criminal mischief, and misdemeanor charges
of reckless endangerment, negligent discharge of oil and operating
a vessel while intoxicated. The maximum penalty for conviction on
all counts is seven years, three months in prison and $61,000 in
fines.
   During Tuesday's testimony, Roberson, marine pilot William E.
Murphy and chief engineer Jerzy Glowacki, testified they had been
at a bar where Hazelwood drank vodka during the day but saw no
signs of intoxication when the captain boarded the ship that
evening.
   ``I would describe him as serious, calm,'' said Roberson.
   Except for a trace of liquor on his breath, Murphy said,
Hazelwood appeared sober and in control of the Exxon Valdez an hour
before the catastrophe.
   ``Did you see anything that indicated the captain was impaired
in any way?'' Chalos asked.
   ``Not at all,'' Murphy replied firmly.
   ``Did he seem in command of this vessel?'' Chalos asked.
   ``Oh, absolutely,'' Murphy said.
   Glowacki said he saw Hazelwood drink three straight vodkas and
the engineer said he consumed three gin and tonics before boarding
the ship. But he said Hazelwood was steady on his feet and he
didn't see him drink again aboard ship. All three said Exxon
forbids liquor on the ship.
   Glowacki's testimony also deflated a prosecution theory that
Hazelwood, in the wake of the accident, tried to back the ship off
the rocks.
   ``Was the engine ever placed in reverse after the grounding?''
asked Hazelwood lawyer Dick Madson.
   ``It was not,'' said the engineer.

<HEAD>Opposition Demands Communists Dissolve Party Cells</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The opposition today demanded that the
Communists disband party cells at work places and accused the
government of resisting reform to gain advantage in multiparty
elections in May.
   The Union of Democratic Forces, an umbrella group representing
opposition groups, proposed during reform talks with the Communists
that a constitutional amendment be presented to Parliament
dissolving the Communist Party organizations at factories, the
state BTA news agency reported.
   The opposition plan also would bar any other political party
from forming organizations at work places, BTA said.
   The opposition is pressing a demand also lodged by reformers
elsewhere in the East bloc who have tried to rid industries of the
party organizations that often serve as shadow managements and
control scarce commodities and privileges.
   The Communists said the issue of the party's presence in the
economy would be regulated in a law on political parties now being
drafted and likely to be submitted to Parliament in March, BTA
reported, without elaboration.
   Talks are to resume Feb. 12, when a special working group will
review the issue, the agency said.
   The talks, involving the Communists, the Union of Democratic
Forces and other social and political groups, started last month
and are aimed at instituting reforms in preparation for the
nation's first free postwar elections, now planned for May.
   At today's talks, the opposition charged that the Communist
Party's ``wish to preserve its structures until elections gives it
advantages despite renunciation of constitutional guarantees about
its leading role,'' BTA said.
   Compared with their East bloc neighbors, Bulgarian Communists
have given up relatively little power, bolstered by a century of
roots in the nation's politics and a relatively weak, although
growing, opposition.
   At a party congress last week, the Communists ousted ranks of
the old guard and gave the helm to a moderate reformer, Alexander
Lilov.
   Another moderate Communist, Andrei Lukanov, became prime minster
and said he would present his government to Parliament on Thursday.
   The Communists have made a vague proposal for a government of
``national concord'' to rule until the elections, but the
opposition has balked at participating, saying it will have little
influence.

   The Westerly (R.I.) Sun on the federal budget:
   It is such a joy to see that the 1991 proposed federal budget
does not resemble one put out by Ronald Reagan that it is tempting
to say the first all-George Bush budget is good enough.
   It isn't, not nearly.
   In a government budget, when the economic assumptions are too
optimistic, the deficit leaps wildly ahead. ... The rosy Bush
budget low-balls inflation in 1991 at 4 percent and is really
pushing it when it forecasts a 3.3 percent increase in the GNP.
   If the Office of Management and Budget is off by only 1 percent
in its projection for the increase in the Gross National Product,
the projected $63 billion deficit jumps $18 billion.
   The national debt will cross the $3 trillion mark this year.
Interest payments on that debt now eat up 14 percent of all tax
dollars. The Bush budget has not done enough to slow this
catastrophic misuse of our money.

   The Santa Fe (N.M.) New Mexican on the peace dividend:
   Recent polling data confirm that three out of four Americans
believe the end of the Cold War should lead to cutbacks in military
spending, producing a ``peace dividend.''
   So where is the peace dividend? There isn't one. Although the
whole premise of the postwar military buildup is crumbling before
our eyes, there are no savings in the Bush administration's budget
from defense spending cuts.
   To reverse the upward spiral of the past decade, the budget does
propose to close dozens of military bases and to cut five Army
divisions. But just halting unbridled growth is not what is needed
to adjust our economy to the momentous changes that have swept the
world in past months.
   A fair share of what ought to be the peace dividend should go
toward reducing the federal deficit, a major dead weight on our
economy. In addition, we should be using a dividend to fund
economic conversion projects.
   In the end, the peace dividend would be spent for the same
purpose as defense dollars would have been: to make America strong.
It's just that in changing times, our definition of strength must
change as well.

   The Flint (Mich.) Journal on the State of the Union:
   East Europe's great Freedom Revolution of 1989 has shredded the
Iron Curtain and continues to bring down walls of communist
repression.
   No longer should anyone doubt that the dangerous chill of Cold
War that threatened to undo humanity and destroy Spaceship Earth
has finally yielded to warmer relations between the Western
Alliance and the Warsaw Pact.
   Freedom-loving people around the world, inspired by America's
200-year example, have finally overcome tyrants of failed economic
and political systems to usher in a brighter and more prosperous
era _ not just for the United States, but for our entire planet. ...
   But the foreign and domestic challenges facing the United States
remain as great as ever. In too many ways, America has fallen
behind the world's other great industrial powers. We have much to
do to restore the financial health of our debt-ridden economy, to
pursue the fairness of trade between nations, to upgrade the
education of our young, to end the scourge of drug abuse, to
protect our endangered environment, to make health care and child
care and housing affordable and available to all who need it, and
to ease the poverty and hopelessness of our fellow Americans. This
demanding work requires cooperation, sacrifice and discipline.
   Still, after listening to President Bush's inspiring (State of
the Union) address ... , most Americans ... should take comfort
that the direction we are moving in _ both as citizens of America
and of the world _ is positive. The ideals, goals and standards of
excellence to which the president has committed our nation, and
which have won bipartisan acclaim, are attainable _ if we have the
heart and will.
   Certainly, the thaw in East-West relations will ease the task by
allowing us to use our precious human and economic resources for
peace and national development instead of for the continuation of
an expensive weapons buildup against the threat of that ultimate
madness: global, nuclear annihilation.

   Statesman-Journal, Salem, Ore., on church taxes:
   The U.S. Supreme Court decision to uphold California's tax on
the mail-order business of TV evangelist Jimmy Swaggart has raised
howls from other church groups. These include the National Council
of Churches and others who would not normally be Swaggart fans. ...
   The business of the churches is not business. The special tax
treatment given to churches is partly in recognition of the social
role they play by ministering to the religious needs of the
community. The assumption is that they are dependent on the private
contributions of their supporters.
   The debated tax involved $1.7 million worth of religious books,
tapes and other items sold during eight years from Swaggart's Baton
Rouge (La.) base to customers in California, which has a sales tax.
   Most churches seem to be continually short on money and
searching for new ways to raise money.
   According to the destination of income theory, businesses that
support otherwise tax-exempt organizations are not themselves
protected from tax.
   Likewise, only that part of a church's property that is used to
support the primary function of the church is exempt from property
tax.
   And that is as it should be. When churches or other charitable
organizations branch out into roles that traditionally are filled
by private business, they lose their claim to special treatment
because of public service.

   The Daily Journal, Elizabeth, N.J., on insurance benefits for
ill, elderly: Too many times, elderly people with a drawn out
illness cannot afford to die. They simply run out of money to cover
the enormous cost of dying.
   Prudential Insurance Co. of America will allow terminally ill
policyholders and those permanently confined to nursing homes to
tap into death benefits while they are still alive.
   It makes perfect sense. The insurance company has to pay the
money out at some point. Why not offer the money to elderly
patients and their families if there is trouble meeting medical
benefits?
   Prudential's program will be tried initially in 10 states. The
move could start an industry trend. We hope it does.
   As our nation ages, it's one answer to the growing crisis in
long-term care.

   The Waukesha County (Wis.) Freeman on Social Security:
   Social Security has been getting a lot of attention on Capitol
Hill lately, and that's good. It's time to do something about the
burden of Social Security taxes.
   We're not being provincial when we say we like the plan Sen.
Robert Kasten, R-Wis., has come up with. Like his congressional
counterpart, Sen. Daniel Moynihan, D-N.Y., Kasten proposes taking
the Social Security trust fund out of the general fund so the
surplus in the fund can no longer be used to mask the massive
deficits the federal government has run up.
   That's a good idea, because it's too early for congressmen to
count that money as part of the general fund and not feel pressured
to rein in their spending.
   But that's about all the two plans have in common. Whereas
Moynihan's proposal calls for a tax increase to pay off the
deficit, Kasten's calls for three years of tax cuts, along with a
reduction in federal spending.
   Kasten's cuts focus on the Social Security tax itself. He
suggests cutting the current 6.2 percent tax rate to 5.9 this year,
to 5.6 percent in 1991 and to 5.3 percent in 1992. Taxpayers would
save more than $500 over that three-year period.
   Under Kasten's plan, the government would collect $71 billion
less in Social Security taxes but the trust fund would still be
able to cover its expenses.
   And where would that $71 billion be? In your pocket, where it
belongs.

   Durham (N.C.) Morning Herald on U.S. payment of United Nations
dues:
   The world's changing political situation makes it timely and
right that Congress should make full payment of its dues to the
United Nations, as President Bush has proposed.
   The United States became a deadbeat for good reasons. The United
Nations had become an amplifier for Soviet-styled socialism. But
the Communist Party is on the ropes and the United Nations has
become a more moderate and important voice in world affairs.
   Today, Eastern Europe wants the help of the United Nations. And
the United Nations is due at least some credit for an increasing
global concern about human rights and the environment.
   The United Nations' role in world peace is too important for the
United States to continue withholding its checks.

   San Francisco Chronicle on the flow of aliens across the Mexican
border:
   The installation of high-intensity floodlights along a
particularly porous stretch of the California-Mexico border is the
latest effort by immigration experts to stem the steady northward
march of illegal aliens, but it too has failed.
   Border Patrol officials say they have virtually lost control of
the human traffic that gathers each night across the sewage-filled
Tijuana River channel, waiting to make a mad dash for jobs in
California.
   While America must remain committed to supporting the oppressed
of other nations, it is also true that California will never have
the wherewithal to make up for the massive economic failings of ...
Mexico.
   Redoubled effort must be addressed to this problem, whether it
be a question of subsidizing a larger Border Patrol program ... or
stiffer penalties for U.S. employers who hire illegal aliens, or
greater U.S. investment in the Mexican economy.

   Sometime very soon South African black activist Nelson Mandela,
71, will emerge from prison and draw his first free breath in 28
years. But the limited freedom Mandela will enjoy in a country
where blacks are officially repressed by apartheid will fall far
short of what Martin Luther King Jr. envisioned in the words,
``Free at last!''
   Even so, Mandela's release marks a watershed for South Africa's
35.6 million men, women and children, 68 percent of them black. The
stubborn stirrings of democracy sweeping much of the world have
finally been felt _ and reponded to _ on the Cape of Good Hope.
   Now the big question: Where does South Africa go from here? The
best and most hopeful answer? To an open and fair negotiating table.

   The West Central Tribune, Willmar, Minn., on the Soviet Union:
   A few years ago, it would have been unthinkable for Americans to
be rooting for the success of a leader of the Soviet Union. Now,
amid rumors of his impending demise, we are hopeful that Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev can fend off internal political attacks
and achieve his economic and political reforms in the Soviet Union.
   It's a wonder that it took so long for a failed ideology to
succumb to reality. The Soviet Union is and will continue to be a
military superpower, but economically, it's a basket case. Outside
of warfare, military might can maintain political dominance only so
long. In order for power to be lasting, it must include economic
strength.
   If the communist hard-liners fear war as much as we do, then
there may be hope for Gorbachev. He must buy time in order to gain
political support for reform. It will be a long and painful
process. Changing from a rigid, centrally controlled economy to a
market economy has been compared to changing planes in mid-air.
   If the Soviet people are patient, reform will come. Meanwhile,
Big Macs might tide them over, and even whet their appetites for a
higher standard of living they will enjoy in a more democratic
society.

   The Telegraph, Nashua, N.H., on the Soviet Union:
   Mikhail Gorbachev has allowed the changes in the Soviet
satellites to happen by refusing to send the Soviet troops to beat
back popular demands for change.
   A demonstration in Moscow over the weekend, huge by Soviet
standards, also was met without a punitive crackdown by the army or
secret police.
   That augurs well for the elimination of the constitutional
clause that guarantees the Communist Party will always have the
upper hand in Soviet affairs.
   A multi-party system may not solve all problems, as Gorbachev
has warned, but it would bring new people and new ideas into

   The Waco (Texas) Tribune-Herald on U.S. troops in Panama:
   Vice President Dan Quayle's trip to Latin America and the
Caribbean was a worthy gesture but was doomed from the start.
Instead of easing hard feelings over the invasion of Panama, the
trip gave Latin leaders a fresh opportunity to display resentment
against the United States that seems always just beneath the
surface.
   The leaders of Mexico, Venezuela and Peru found it
``inconvenient'' to receive Quayle. So he went to Panama, where he
was welcomed, and to Honduras and Jamaica, where all he heard was,
``Get the troops out of Panama.''
   Some troops from the invasion force remain in Panama because
Panamanians want them there. The remnants of ousted dictator Manuel
Noriega's police force and army must be reorganized before the
nation can take responsibility for its own security. That will take
more time.
   The present leaders of Panama are the same ones chosen in free
elections last May, which is good enough for the Panamanians but
not good enough for the rest of Latin America. They refuse to
recognize the government that took power with American help.
   How all this concern for Panama managed to stay bottled up
during the brutal, corrupt, Noriega years remains a mystery.
   The United States must remove the last invasion troops from
Panama as soon as possible but cannot do so yet. Until the troops
can leave, we will have to put up with the resentment aimed this
way from the south _ and take most of it with a grain of salt.

   Philadelphia Daily News on German reunification and the United
States:
   The East Germans, despite 40-odd years of rhetoric, are talking
seriously about reunification with West Germany, a thought that
can't fail to cause a twinge among people familiar with the German
fondness for marching through their neighbors' homes armed to the
teeth and feeling mean.
   It makes a lot of sense for the East Germans.
   West Germany, after all, is a wildly successful capitalist state
that also maintains layer upon layer of social benefits, along with
intelligently generous spending on infrastructure items like
education. East Germany would be foolish not to hitch its rickety
wagon to that three-pointed Mercedes-Benz star.
   Hmmmmm.
   Looking at the way things are working out here, especially as
President Bush and Congress keep diddling with the deficit, our
industry spirals downward and our branches of government compete
only over who can give the most to the already rich, an idea
glimmers.
   Why don't we unite with the West Germans?
   Or allow ourselves to be acquired, appalling as it seems to have
the Germans be ``white knights''?
   They can handle our invasions of small countries and our
finances.
   We can feed them hamburgers.

   The Bush administration today urged Congress
to be patient with Chinese leaders despite the ``appalling
tragedy'' of their bloody crackdown last June on pro-democracy
demonstrators.
   Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger told the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee the administration ``knows that not
enough has been done'' to restore human rights in China.'' But, he
said, ``we never expected to reverse events overnight.''
   Defending the administration's rapprochement with Chinese
leaders, Eagleburger said the crackdown on demonstrators in Beijing
was ``a tragic setback'' in otherwise slow but steady progress
toward reform.
   ``The China of the 1980s _ despite the appalling tragedy of
Tiananmen Square _ has come a long way from the era of the Gang of
Four'' in the 1970s, Eagleburger said. He cited foreign investment,
cultural and educational exchanges and openness to the news media.
   His testimony came as the human rights group, Asia Watch,
reported repression of Chinese dissenters has deepened despite the
lifting of martial law.
   The group's report, harshly critical of Bush's China policy,
largely mirrored a still-confidential State Department report
listing widespread human rights violations in China.
   Many in Congress believe the evidence of Chinese repression
makes it even more difficult for Bush to defend his current efforts
at rapprochement, just eight months after the brutal crushing of
the pro-democracy movement.
   Eagleburger has been at the center of Bush's secret
policymaking, traveling on two clandestine trips to China with
national security adviser Brent Scowcroft in the months since the
crackdown.
   The administration, since the killings of protesters in Beijing
last June 4, ``has reverted ... to a shabby double standard insofar
as the question of human rights in China is concerned,'' the Asia
Watch report concluded.
   The 89-page document, based largely on press reports, catalogs
continuing arrests of peaceful dissidents, secret trials of
protesters, new executions and death sentences and government use
of torture against political opponents.
   It also adds a layer of criticism, calling Bush's reluctance to
anger the rulers in Beijing a ``shamefully supine policy'' and
concludes: ``The burden of trying to shape a policy that reflects
concern for human rights still rests largely on the Congress.''
   Sources have said the State Department report, which has been
sent to Capitol Hill but not publicly released, offers a
matter-of-fact recitation of abuses by the Beijing government
throughout 1989, including terming the June 4 Tiananmen Square
killings a ``massacre.''
   It describes the government of Deng Xiaoping as a totalitarian
regime that has tightened its grip on information and throttled
opposing ideologies while restricting foreign travel and
suppressing labor and religious groups, sources said.
   The Asia Watch report said between 10,000 and 30,000 people
remain jailed because of pro-democracy activities. ``The recent
lifting of martial law in Beijing ... has little significance if
viewed as anything other than a public relations exercise,'' the
report contends.
   ``Arrests have continued, largely in secret, right through to
the present,'' and reports of continued executions persist, the
report said. Most of those detained have not been charged or tried,
and their families are not told where the prisoners are being held,
it said.
   When they are tried, ``verdicts are usually decided upon before
the trial even begins,'' it said. Torture of prisoners is common,
and at least 40 people have been executed in connection with the
events of last June, it added.
   ``China's criminal justice system is among the most deeply
flawed in the world,'' the report said. ``Indeed, it is essentially
pre-modern.''
   ``To sum up,'' it said, ``the continuing arrests and executions
in China form the cutting edge of a protracted, government-led
campaign of punitive repression, and they serve a purely political
purpose.''

   The world's first recipient of a device
that works like a lung died early today, 4{ days after surgeons
implanted the mechanism.
   LDS Hospital spokesman Tim Madden said the teen-age girl who
received the experimental IntraVascular Oxygenator _ a slender,
20-inch bundle of hollow synthetic fibers that delivers oxygen to
the body _ died at 5:30 a.m.
   He said he could provide no other details immediately.
   The device _ designed for temporary use to allow the lungs to
rest and recover _ was implanted in a major vein during two hours
of surgery Friday in a girl with acute respiratory failure.
   She reportedly was a 16-year-old from Texas, but her parents had
asked that no details about their daughter or her condition be made
public.
   It was unclear how long doctors had planned to leave the device
inside the girl. Food and Drug Administration guidelines limit
implants to seven days, and Madden had said any use beyond a week
would require further FDA permission.
   LDS Hospital is one of four medical centers authorized by the
FDA for clinical testing of the IVOX. The others are Hershey
Medical Center at Pennsylvania State University, the University of
Michigan Medical Center in Ann Arbor and the Los Angeles
County-University of Southern California Medical Center.
   Developed by Salt Lake City-based CardioPulmonics Inc., the
device can satisfy as much as half of the body's need for oxygen
delivery and carbon dioxide removal.
   External tubes the size of a soda straw are connected to the
device. One tube delivers oxygen from a hospital system or oxygen
tank; the other tube removes carbon dioxide from the body.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III opened talks
here tonight determined to find out whether Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev still has firm authority to negotiate
agreements on arms control, Afghanistan and other issues.
   Baker also expects to receive a Soviet response to Bush's
proposal for a ceiling of 195,000 on U.S. and Soviet troops in
Central Europe. He said he would not be surprised if Gorbachev
called for deeper cuts.
   And on German reunification, Baker acknowledged, ``it may not be
as gradual as we anticipated.'' Baker said he expected East Germany
to work on legal and other steps with West Germany after holding
national elections in mid-March.
   Baker declined to speculate on Gorbachev's authority in the wake
of a Communist Party Central Committee meeting that abolished the
party's constitutional guarantee of political power.
   At the outset, at least, Baker's plans were unaffected by the
Central Committee's action.
   That move, taken at Gorbachev's behest, left open the question
whether the authority he derives from the post of party
general-secretary will be trimmed as a result.
   ``Ask me that question after I spend two days with Mr. Gorbachev
and Mr. (Eduard A.) Shevardnadze, and then I would be doing a lot
more than just guessing,'' Baker told reporters on the flight from
Prague.
   Baker arrived in the Soviet capital from Prague, Czechoslovakia,
where he said in a speech that the United States wants leaders at a
proposed 35-nation summit meeting this year to enshrine free
elections as a fundamental human right.
   In his Moscow talks, Baker intends to take up with the foreign
minister _ and then with Gorbachev on Friday _ issues that must be
resolved in order to complete a treaty to reduce U.S. and Soviet
long-range nuclear missiles in time to be signed at a Washington
summit in the second half of June.
   Baker also will take up ways to try to end the 11-year war in
Afghanistan between the Soviet-backed Marxist government and
U.S.-armed Moslem rebels.
   Tass said his discussions would touch on ``questions of a
military-political character, connected with completing work this
year on an agreement to cut strategic attack weapons of the United
States and Soviet Union by 50 percent.''
   In his Prague speech, Baker said the United States, the Soviet
Union, Canada and the 32 countries of Europe also should join in
sending observers to monitor upcoming balloting in Warsaw Pact
countries ``to ensure that people power elections of 1990 genuinely
represent the will of the people.''
   ``Let me be clear,'' he said in a speech at Charles University
in Prague. ``The peaceful transition to democracy now under way in
Central and Eastern Europe will not tolerate rear guard maneuvers
from any quarter.''
   Before the speech, Baker went to Wenceslas Square, the city's
commercial center, and placed a wreath at the statue of King
Wenceslas, the monarch who brought Christianity to Bohemia.
   A crowd of a few hundred watched the ceremony quietly. Nearby is
a circular flower bed, which has been turned into a shrine to honor
the student martyr Jan Palach, a victim of the Soviet suppression
of the 1968 ``Prague Spring'' uprising.
   Baker delivered the speech in Magna Aluh, the ceremonial Great
Hall of the university, after entering in a processional with
gowned deans and professors.
   The nearly 650-year-old university was a rallying point for
pro-democracy forces that overthrew the communist order in
December. Czechoslovaks, who have not voted in a free election
since the communists took power in 1948, are preparing for
balloting June 8.
   Baker also unveiled a U.S. support plan for Czechoslovakia that
would knock down U.S. barriers to its exports but provide no direct
economic aid to the leaders of its ``Velvet Revolution.''
   ``They are not asking for a handout,'' one U.S. official said,
referring to the new Czech leaders responsible for the country's
smooth transition from hard-line communism.
   Endorsing Gorbachev's call for the 35-nation summit meeting,
Baker said its agenda should include making free elections a human
rights obligation under the 1975 Helsinki agreement.
   ``The spirit of revolution needs to move from the street into
the government,'' he said. ``Transitional regimes need to give way
to fair and free elections that establish open parliaments with a
place for opposition. The new democratic political system needs to
respect the rule of law and fundamental individual rights and
liberties.''
   In addition to knocking down trade barriers with Czechoslovakia,
Baker said the Bush administration was prepared to support the
country's request to join the International Monetary Fund and back
the location of a European development bank in Prague.
   But, he cautioned, ``It's up to you to provide a conducive legal
environment, to turn over or sell factories to private owners, and
to lift the heavy hand of excessive government intervention.''

   For people who work at Elvis Presley's
house, a new half-hour TV series on the singer is best seen from
the seat of a `57 Chevy.
   ``This rolls it all back decades before the first jelly doughnut
joke, before he was elevated to a god,'' said Todd Morgan, a
spokesman for Presley's former Memphis residence, Graceland.
   Morgan and about 50 other Graceland workers watched the first
episode of the ABC-TV series Tuesday at a replica of a drive-in
movie set up in a museum featuring Presley's former cars and
motorcycles.
   Spectators at the drive-in sit on front seats taken from 1957
Chevrolets.
   The TV series, ``Elvis,'' focuses on the years while Presley was
breaking into the entertainment business.
   Presley, who died in 1977, spent much of his time inside the
Graceland walls when in Memphis because of the large following of
fans he attracted. Overweight in the years preceding his death,
Presley also drew the attention of jesters who have often referred
to his alleged fondness for jelly doughnuts.

   A man claims he rode 450 miles on the
back of a stingray to safety after his boat capsized three weeks
ago, a radio station reported Wednesday.
   Radio Vanuatu said 18-year-old Lottie Stevens washed up
Wednesday in New Caledonia. It said Stevens' boat capsized Jan. 15
while he and a friend were on a fishing trip off the Pacific island
nation of Vanuatu.
   The friend died, and after four days spent drifting with the
overturned boat, Stevens decided to try to swim to safety, Radio
Vanuatu reported. Despite numerous sharks, a stingray came to
Stevens' rescue and carried him on its back for 13 days and nights
to New Caledonia, the radio said.
   The report could not be confirmed. It said Stevens was weak and
recovering in a hospital.
   Radio Vanuatu said it was the second time someone had been saved
by a fish.
   A woman was saved by a shark when a ship sank in a hurricane
four years ago off Vanuatu, the radio said. It gave no other
details.

   A prisoner nearing the end of a
five-year jail term for theft escaped after a prison official
allowed him to visit a prostitute, authorities said Wednesday.
   The unidentified Yugoslav national had been given an eight-hour
permit to visit this town bordering Lake Geneva on Monday to do
some shopping in preparation for his planned release April 12.
   An accompanying prison official allowed him to pay two visits to
a prostitute. After the second visit, the prisoner ordered a taxi
and fled, authorities said.

   The mystery of where swans go on their migratory
flights may be unraveled with the development of a tiny transmitter
to be attached to the birds so they can be tracked by a satellite.
   The Wild Bird Society of Japan and the telecommunications
utility Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. jointly announced
Wednesday that a transmitter weighing 1.4 ounces will be attached
to swans. Signals from the birds will be beamed to a U.S.-French
environmental satellite called Argos to tell scientists where the
swans are.
   The first satellites will be attached this spring to four swans
in Hokkaido, the northernmost Japanese island. The satellites will
tell scientists the flight path swans use to reach their Arctic
summer homes.
   Larger transmitters have been used in recent years to track
migrations of dolphins and seals, but they were too heavy for the
12-pound swans to carry in flight.

   Rebels attacked a truck belonging to
the government's relief agency, killing the driver and 11 people
riding in the back, a state-run newspaper reported Wednesday.
   Noticias, Mozambique's largest newspaper, said 18 people were
injured in the attack Sunday in the central province of Sofala.
   The truck was part of a military-escorted convoy but fell behind
when its rear tires were punctured, according to Noticias. The
newspaper said rebels of the Mozambique National Resistance raked
the truck with machine gun fire, then looted sacks of corn in the
back.
   The rebels have waged a destructive hit-and-run insurgency
against Mozambique's leftist government since 1977. South Africa
supported the rebels for several years but says it no longer
supports them. No other foreign government acknowledges backing the
rebels.

   A man angry because he was passed
over in a government land distribution program opened fire
Wednesday on people waiting to receive their land titles and killed
two, police said.
   Eighteen people were injured before police shot the man to death
30 minutes later. One policeman was seriously wounded in the
gunfight, said Mohamed Sedek Ali, the chief criminal investigations
officer in Selangor state.
   Mohamed Sedek said the man, Mohamed Ali Dawi, 45, a watchman at
the Waterworks Department, first protested to a government district
officer that his name was not on a list of people receiving land
from the government.
   After the officer told him his case would be considered next
time, he left and returned with a shotgun, Mohamed Sedek said.
   He said the man opened fire on 120 villagers gathered to receive
land titles at the community hall in Kampung Pasir Putih, 30 miles
north of Kuala Lumpur.
   It was the second shooting case in four days in Selangor state,
which is considered federal territory.
   On Sunday, a man grabbed a policeman's M-16 rifle and fatally
shot two passers-by before police shot him to death.

<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The leader of Canada's Liberal Party announced
today he will resign as head of the official opposition and return
to a private law practice.
   John Turner, 60, told a news conference he will keep his
Vancouver Quadra seat in the House of Commons and will live in
Toronto.
   Herb Gray of Windsor, Ontario, immediately replaces Turner as
head of the Liberals in Parliament. Gray is currently opposition
House leader, in charge of the day-to-day affairs of the Liberals
in the Commons.
   ``Mr. Gray is the dean of the House of Commons,'' Turner said.
``He has the confidence of Parliament and I know he has the
confidence of the Speaker.''
   Turner will retain the title of Liberal Party leader until the
party's leadership convention in June 23 in Calgary.
   So far, six candidates are in the running for the job.
   In resigning from the leadership of the opposition, Turner will
have his pay reduced to $82,000, the same as a regular member of
Parliament. As leader, he received about the same pay as a Cabinet
minister, a bit more than $130,000.
   Turner will also lose his chauffeured car and the right to live
at Stornoway, official opposition leader's residence.
   Turner, who served briefly as prime minister after becoming
Liberal leader in 1984, announced his decision to the parliamentary
caucus earlier in the day.
   In a political career that touched on four decades, Turner has
been a member of parliament, a Cabinet minister, and played key
roles in such national debates as those over bilingualism, abortion
and more recently, free trade.
   His spirited election campaign in 1988 against free trade
brought the Liberals back to respectability in the Commons after
being reduced to 40 seats in the 1984 election that brought Prime
Minister Brian Mulroney and the Conservatives to power. The party
currently holds 82 seats in the Commons.

   The jetliner crashed Jan. 25 in Cove Neck, killing 73 people,
apparently because it ran out of fuel.

that toxicological tests done on tissue samples from the pilot,
flight engineer and four stewards showed no drugs or alcohol. The
results are being double-checked by the Federal Aviation
Administration, he said.
   The FAA sends the tissue samples to two independent laboratories.
   The dead included Laureano Caviedes Hoyos, 56, the pilot, and

   Indian paramilitary troops shot and
killed two innocent bystanders Wednesday after Moslem militants
bombed a shopping center in this Kashmir city, witnesses said.
   The deaths were reported in the Lal Chowk area, where witnesses
said Border Security Force soldiers fired into a crowd after
militants campaigning for an independent Kashmir bombed the
three-story shopping complex.
   The victims, a Moslem and a Hindu, were businessmen who were
caught in the paramilitary gunfire, said witnesses and a man who
identified himself as the father of the Moslem.
   The deaths occurred in the Lal Chowk area of downtown Srinagar.
The witnesses said Moslems campaigning for independence for the
Kashmir region bombed a three-story shopping center and that Border
Security Force soldiers opened fire on a mob.
   ``My son was closing the shop after the trouble started when
suddenly the BSF came and opened fire,'' said Mohammad Yusuf, whose
son, Shabir Yousuf, was reported killed.
   The government refused to either confirm or deny the deaths. The
state-run local radio said the shopping complex caught fire after a
cooking-gas cylinder exploded inside the building. The radio,
monitored in Srinagar, made no mention of paramilitary gunfire or
deaths.
   Also Wednesday, at least six policemen and two bystanders were
injured when militants attacked a police bunker with a grenade in
downtown Srinagar, said witnesses who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   In another part of the city, a bomb believed planted by
militants exploded in a post office. There were no injuries,
witnesses said.
   On Tuesday night, suspected militants blew up a truck, injuring
one person who was sleeping in the vehicle, witnesses said.
   At least 79 people have been killed since Jan. 20 when Indian
authorities began a crackdown on the Moslem secessionist movement
in Kashmir, a part of Jammu-Kashmir state. Jammu-Kashmir is the
only Indian state with a majority Moslem population, and militants
support either independence or unity with neighboring Pakistan,
which is mainly Moslem.
   Most of those killed have been shot for defying curfews.
   Srinagar is the largest city in the Kashmir valley and is the
summer capital of Jammu-Kashmir state. The city of Jammu is the
winter capital.
   In Jammu, about 200 Moslem state government employees
demonstrated Wednesday demanding that they be taken to Srinagar,
witnesses said. The demonstrators chanted anti-Indian slogans and
claimed that their lives were in danger in Hindu-dominated Jammu.

<TEXT>
   Ruth Trabelsi says she wants to ``enter the
Garden of Eden with both feet,'' but doctors say she will die of
gangrene if her right foot is not amputated. In a case
unprecedented in Israel, a judge has been asked to decide whether
Mrs. Trabelsi must be forced to have surgery.
   The 84-year-old woman's case has captured Israelis' attention
and been widely covered by newspapers and state-run radio stations.
Even the nation's leading rabbis have become involved in a public
debate on whether Jewish law dictates that her life should be saved.
   Social workers from the Israeli Welfare Ministry question
whether Mrs. Trabelsi fully understands the consequences of
refusing surgery and took the case to court under a law requiring
the state to protect citizens who may not be responsible for
themselves.
   Doctors at Poriah Hospital in the northern Galilee town of
Tiberias insist that without the amputation, Mrs. Trabelsi will die
slowly and painfully from the spreading decay in her foot, which
developed after earlier surgery.
   Judge Oded Gershon of Nazareth District Court met in his
chambers Wednesday with doctors, lawyers, and several of Mrs.
Trabelsi's 258 children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren. He
was expected to make a decision Thursday.
   Israel radio quoted Gershon as asking Poriah Hospital's chief
surgeon, Dr. Amos Mazor: ``How long do I have to decide?''
   ``I hope you have another day or two, but I'm not sure,'' Mazor
reportedly replied. ``Every passing hour without amputation is
worsening Mrs. Trabelsi's situation.''
   ``What do you want from her? She's 84, let her die in honor as
she chooses,'' said the woman's son, Eliahu Trabelsi.
   But other family members said the court should force Mrs.
Trabelsi to have surgery, the radio said.
   Mrs. Trabelsi did not attend the court hearing.
   Dr. Yaacov Farbstein, the director of Poriah Hospital, told The
Associated Press in a telephone interview that Mrs. Trabelsi was
hospitalized and ``is conscious and stable.''
   He said she developed the infection in her foot about a month
ago after surgery at another hospital for a muscular problem.
   ``We see it as a passive suicide, and I would like the court to
answer this question whether we can leave a patient to make a
passive suicide,'' Farbstein said.
   Mazor agreed, saying in a radio interview, ``An 80-year-old
woman also has time ahead of her.''
   ``We don't know whether it's five years or 10, but we shouldn't
be the ones to help her shorten her life,'' he said.
   Judge Gershon ordered a psychiatrist and geriatric specialist to
visit Mrs. Trabelsi to determine whether she was lucid enough to
understand her decision, the radio said.
   The court's decision could be a landmark ruling for Israel on
the right-to-die issue. Similar petitions to shut off life support
systems of terminally ill patients have been rejected by the courts
in the past.
   Some of Mrs. Trabelsi's grandchildren have appealed to the
nation's top rabbis to persuade her to have the amputation, arguing
that her decision was based on religious faith.
   ``I want to enter the Garden of Eden with both feet,'' Mrs.
Trabelsi reportedly told them Tuesday in explaining her decision.
   But rabbis were divided on the question. Rabbi Israel Lau, head
rabbi of the Ashkanazi, or European, community in Tel Aviv, said
Jewish law was ``unequivocal'' that a doctor's decision to amputate
in a life-threatening situation must be honored.
   Rabbi Eliahu Bakshi Doron, Haifa's head Sephardi clergyman,
religious leader of Middle Eastern and African Jews, suggested that
religious law was not so clear.
   ``Only if it is absolute that she would die immediately should a
decision on amputation be forced,'' Doron told the national Itim
news agency.

<HEAD>Brown Says Its Controversial Curriculum Has Been Successful</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROSS SNEYD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some universities are returning to more
traditional curricula, but Brown University believes its
much-maligned 20-year experiment in student-guided education has
been a resounding success and is here to stay.
   The school's practice of setting students free to pursue their
academic interests in a loosely structured environment, which the
university has said produces a better-rounded graduate, has been
derided by education experts and by national publications.
   But a study released Tuesday concludes that, while some
modifications are needed, Brown has been well-served by the
curriculum it established 20 years ago.
   When Brown's current curriculum was adopted for the 1969-70
school year, it was seen as a radical departure from the
traditional method of setting core requiremnts of courses that
students are required to take.
   Brown, instead, encouraged and required students to set off on a
path of their own.
   ``Brown sought to break the lockstep of the conventional
curriculum and induce students and faculty to share the
responsibility for shaping the educational experience,'' said the
report released Tuesday.
   The approach is still controversial but it has produced
well-rounded students who go on to obtain post-graduate degrees in
unusually high numbers and who strongly support its methods, the
report concluded.
   ``On balance, it has been a resounding success, both for
(Brown's) students and its faculty,'' said the report prepared by
university Dean Sheila E. Blumstein.
   Not all have agreed with that assessment. ``Brown is glam and
flash,'' The New Republic concluded in a June 1986 cover story
evaluating the school's curriculum.
   Brown is unconcerned with the criticism of the past because its
nearly year-long study found that its courses achive the
university's goal of a well-rounded education, Blumstein said.
   ``There's been a growing trend to go exactly in the opposite
direction,'' she said. ``What we're showing is, on balance, our
students have been very responsible in how they used the
curriculum. So they provide for themselves a broad general
education.''
   She and university President Vartan Gregorian, who ordered the
study, know that Brown has been accused of being lax, but they said
that is unfair criticism. ``People have confused flexibility and
rigor,'' she said. ``You can be both flexible and rigorous.''
   John C. Hoy, president of the New England Board of Higher
Education, said he was not surprised that Brown judged its program
a success.
   ``For Brown, it clearly has been a successful program,'' he
said. ``The younger alumni that I have a chance to meet reflect on
it that way. They themselves attest to how valuable it was.''
   However, it is not perfect, Blumstein quickly added. ``While we
may celebrate our successes, we must also recognize our weaknesses,
shortcomings and failures, and make serious efforts in developing a
realistic set of priorities and actions for the future,'' she wrote
in her report.
   Specifically, she recommended the following major changes in
curriculum:
   _Improving general education. ``For various reasons ... the
program did not fulfill the goals of general education as
envisioned by the 1969 reforms,'' the report said.
   _Encouraging more students to study science, especially those
students who are not majoring in the sciences.
   _Relieving pressures on certain courses, particularly the social
sciences, where ``larger enrollments are severely stretching
instructional resources.''
   _Improving academic advising.
   _Reconsidering the number of majors _ or concentrations, as
Brown describes them _ offered. Compared to a number of other Ivy
League institutions that it surveyed, Brown offers many more
disciplines, Blumstein said. ``While we have 83 concentration
programs, the next highest number of Ivy League programs is 58,''
she said.
   Hoy said Blumstein's report appeared to be on the mark, although
he had not read it. ``Curriculum is the most intimate reflection of
an intellectual community ... that a college reveals,'' he said.
``That they're looking at revising it today seems to me to make
sense.''

<HEAD>Midwest Housing Most Affordable</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Midwest had the most affordable existing
homes as 1989 ended, while the most expensive existing housing was
found on both coasts, a real estate trade group reported Wednesday.
   Peoria, Ill., had the lowest median price, $47,200, of the 83
metropolitan areas surveyed by the National Association of
Realtors. That was $233,700 below the median cost of a home in
Honolulu, the most expensive area in the survey.
   Low-cost existing housing, as opposed to new homes, in the final
quarter of 1989 also was found in Oklahoma City and Spokane, Wash.,
where the median price in both areas was $53,900; Mobile, Ala.,
$56,400; and Louisville, Ky., $58,000.
   Joining Honolulu in the top expensive areas were the San
Francisco Bay area, where the median price was $260,600; Orange
County, Calif., $247,900; and Los Angeles, $217,000. Boston had the
highest price tag on the East Coast, $183,600.
   The median price means half of the homes cost more and half
less. The survey covered existing single-family detached homes,
townhouses, condominiums and cooperatives.
   The national median price was $92,800 in the October-December
period, a 4.6 percent advance from the fourth quarter of 1988.
Forty-eight metropolitan areas recorded price increases exceeding
the national increase.
   Median prices in the Midwest were $71,700, a 5.9 percent gain
over the same quarter of 1988. The South posted an $83,100 median
price, up 4.3 percent.
   The Northeast's median price stalled in the fourth quarter,
rising only 0.9 percent to $144,000. The West had the largest gain,
9 percent to $141,600.
   Realtors President Norman D. Flynn cited the smaller urban
markets as ``the ones offering both moderately priced housing and a
strong, diverse economic base.''
   ``Affordable homes within a reasonable commute make these cities
a prime target for companies looking to expand or relocate,'' Flynn
said.
   Sales of existing homes, which were weak earlier in the year,
perked up as mortgage rates fell from their March peak into the
single digits.
   John A. Tuccillo, the Realtors chief economist, said interest
rate declines during the fall produced across-the-board sales
increases in the fourth quarter.
   Nationally, sales were up 2.1 percent over the third quarter to
a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.85 million units. Sales for
the year, however, were off 4.3 percent to 3.78 million units.
   The West was the fastest growing market as the year ended,
posting an 8.2 percent increase to an annual rate of 660,000 units
for the October-December period.
   It was followed by a sales gain of 2.8 percent, to 1.45 million
units, in the South, and a 1 percent advance, to 1.04 million
units, in the Midwest.
   Sales slumped in much of the Northeast, where they were off 2.6
percent to 701,000 units at an annual rate for the quarter. For the
year, sales declined 11.8 percent, to 741,000 units.
   Twenty-nine states posted sales increases over the third
quarter, ranging from 0.9 percent in Hawaii to 30.5 percent in
Vermont.
   Flynn said the 1990 housing market is expected to be much like
1989 _ strong in some areas, average in others and sluggish in
parts of the nation where the economy is weak.

<HEAD>Survey Shows Many High School Students Lack Knowledge of Geography</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A little more than half of the high school
students surveyed on their knowledge of geography gave correct
responses to questions about key countries and physical and
cultural features of the world, the Nation's Report Card said today.
   In its first study of geography education, the National
Assessment of Educational Progress _ popularly known as the
Nation's Report Card _ said most students demonstrated a limited
understanding of the characteristics of the planet Earth and the
relationships between people and their environment.
   More than 3,000 12th-grade students from about 300 public and
private schools participated in the survey, conducted from January
through May of the 1987-88 school year.
   An average of 57 percent of the students gave correct responses
overall to questions that dealt with the location of key countries
and physical and cultural features of the world, the survey showed.
   Geography is not a priority in most schools, said the study. It
pointed to a recent survey of the Council of Chief State School
Officers that found only 18 percent of the states required
geography for graduation.
   When it is taught, geography is often integrated into other
courses, such as history, social studies and science, said the
report, ``The Geography Learning of High-School Seniors.''
   ``Geography appeared to play neither a major nor a consistent
role in students' high-school course-taking experience,'' said the
study.
   ``Geography course-taking per se was not associated with
achievement _ a finding that was consistent across most subgroups
of the population.''
   Less than two-thirds of the students surveyed reported taking a
geography course at any grade in high school. But 83 percent
indicated they had studied in other courses the location of
continents, oceans, rivers, mountains, states, cities, countries
and cultures.
   On a world map, 87 percent identified Canada, 85 percent
recognized the Soviet Union, 84 percent correctly identified
countries in the Middle East, 72 percent identified petroleum
exporting countries and 71 percent successfully located Latin
America.
   But only 37 percent were able to locate Southeast Asia and 37
percent incorrectly responded that India is part of Southeast Asia.
Thirteen percent said that either Saudi Arabia or Brazil are part
of this cultural region.
   NAEP is a congressionally mandated project of the National
Center for Education Statistics at the Department of Education. It
is the only nationally representative and continuing assessment of
what American students know and can do in various subject areas.
   The National Geographic Society also helped fund the assessment.

   Members of rival Tamil groups fought

Tuesday fired on a group of Tamils leaving Sri Lanka by sea,
killing at least eight people and injuring 17.
   Two boats on which the victims were traveling reached the coast
of south India on Wednesday, the news agency said. There was no
immediate word on who the assailants were.
   Military officials in Colombo, who cannot be identified under
briefing rules, said at least 19 people were killed in fighting
between the Tigers and members of the Eelam People's Revolutionary
Liberation Front at Unnichai, 135 miles east of Colombo.
   The Tigers attacked members of the Eelam National Democratic
Liberation Front at Jamaliya, 145 miles northeast of Colombo and at
least seven people were killed, said residents contacted by
telephone.
   The military officials confirmed the fighting but said they had
no details of casualties.
   Fighting between the Tigers and other militias erupted after
India announced last year it was withdrawing its peacekeeping
solders from northern and eastern Sri Lanka.
   The Tigers, who have been at the forefront of the 7-year-old
campaign for an independent Tamil nation, have been fighting the
Indian forces since 1987. They have also targeted rival groups that
were aligned with the peacekeeping troops.
   India sent soldiers to quell the Tamil insurgency in 1987 after
signing an accord with the Sri Lankan government aimed at ending
the Tamil war.
   At least 11,000 people, including 1,100 Indian soldiers, have
been killed since the Tamil secessionist movement was launched in
1983.
   At least 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people are Tamils.
They contend they are discriminated against by the Sinhalese, who
make up 75 percent of the island nation's population and control
the government and the military.

   Ask somebody about Terry Sutton's
artwork, and they'll tell you he does a bang-up job.
   He uses guns instead of a paintbrush.
   Sutton blasts holes in sheets of copper to produce images of the
Southwest, such as covered wagons and outlines of Texas. He says he
is particularly fond of shooting out pictures of longhorns.
   ``I take a pencil and sketch out a design on a sheet of
cardboard,'' Sutton said. ``Then I set the cardboard on a sheet of
copper and shoot out all the dots around the picture.''
   Sutton, 41, got the idea from boyhood memories, he said Tuesday.
He recalled seeing a gun salesman shooting out designs with a
Winchester.
   ``I'm sure he never intended it to be framed and sold,'' Sutton
said.
   He says he's sold 80 pieces in three years.
   There are drawbacks, concedes Sutton, who paints houses and
takes other odd jobs for his main income.
   ``Sometimes at the end of the day, I can't hear,'' he said. He
also has to buy shells by the case.
   ``If I miss and booger one up, that's 20 bucks down the tubes,''
he said.
   On a productive day, Sutton can turn out 25 pieces. They fetch
up to $125 apiece, much of it sold through a western art gallery in
Arizona.
   Each piece of art takes about 80 to 100 shots. Sutton said it
takes three or four minutes for each, including time for reloading.

   Since Seattle is known as the Emerald City,
maybe Tacoma should dump its longtime motto as the City of Destiny
and become known as the Sapphire City, says Mayor Karen Vialle.
   Vialle said she's had enough of a smokestack image and
embarrassing ``aroma of Tacoma'' themes in national news reports.
   ``I think we need to come up with another city motto,'' Vialle
said earlier this week. ``In our efforts to enhance our image, we
need to come up with something that plays to our attributes.'' She
didn't mention any specific plans for the change.
   The idea of sapphire was brought up by a psychology professor
last summer.
   Christine Hansvick, of Pacific Lutheran University, said she
found a largely negative self-image of the city and that residents
identified with gray.
   She suggested the sapphire, a blue gemstone, as an antidote.
   ``You can see the image wherever you look,'' she said. ``We have
blue skies, blue waters and a dome with a blue roof,'' referring to
the Tacoma Dome arena.
   Abandoning the City of Destiny, a motto attributed to New York
newspaper columnist George Francis Train during the railroad boom
in 1886, would show the community's determination to project a
fresher face, she said.
   Brian Kamens of the Tacoma Public Library's Northwest
Collection, said the city also had been known over the years as
Mistress of the Sea, Portal of the Pacific, City of Fine Homes and
Lumber Capital of the World.
   A contest in 1981 resulted in a switch of Seattle's nickname
from Queen City to Emerald City.
   A top-quality emerald can cost $9,000 and an equivalent sapphire
about $6,000, said Jane Horowitz, a buyer for the Ben Bridge
jewelry store chain.

<HEAD>Study: Instant Gun Check Law Well Received</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEAN McNAIR</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>RICHMOND, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Virginia's instant background check on gun
buyers is working better than firearms dealers expected, according
to a state report.
   Under the program, which began Nov. 1, nearly 11,000 gun
purchases were approved and 130, or 1 percent, were rejected
because the buyer had a criminal record, said state Secretary of
Public Safety Robert L. Suthard.
   ``This program has operated in the manner intended,'' Suthard
said in a report issued Tuesday. ``If the program had not been
implemented, there would be 130 weapons in the hands of persons the
General Assembly deems unqualified.''
   The law, first of its kind in nation, requires gun dealers to
call state police on a toll-free telephone number each time a state
resident tries to buy certain firearms. The average time to obtain
an approval was less than 90 seconds, the report said. Out-of-state
buyers must wait for approval by mail.
   ``Firearms dealers appear to be generally satisfied with the
program,'' the report said. A survey of the state's gun dealers
found that 65 percent said the program worked better than they
expected, 18 percent said it was worse and 17 percent said it was
about what they expected.
   Gun dealers collect a $2 fee from Virginia residents and a $5
fee from out-of-state residents for each police records check. But
the report said the fees have not covered the cost of the records
checks because the number of gun purchases has been fewer than
estimated.
   Pending legislation would raise the fees to $5 and $10.
   Sen. Moody E. Stallings, who sponsored the gun law, said he has
been contacted by eight to 10 states interested in enacting similar
laws.
   The law covers the purchases of handguns with a barrel length of
less than 5 inches or semiautomatic weapons that hold more than 20
rounds or accommodate a silencer or bayonet.

   A teen-age girl died this morning 4{ days
after becoming the world's first recipient of an implanted device
that works like a lung.
   LDS Hospital spokesman Tim Madden said Melicia Harvey, 16, of
Arthur City, Texas, died of pulmonary failure at 5:30 a.m. The
experimental IntraVascular Oxygenator _ a 20-inch bundle of hollow
synthetic fibers that delivers oxygen to the blood _ functioned as
intended until the girl's death, Madden said.
   Miss Harvey had been in critical condition throughout the
experiment with severe respiratory distress syndrome, which results
from a variety of causes and is characterized by inability of the
lungs to transfer oxygen to the blood.
   The IVOX, approved for use for up to a week to allow damaged
lungs to rest and recover, was implanted during two hours of
surgery Friday.
   Miss Harvey, whose father, Atrell Harvey II, is employed by the
Campbell Soup Co., had been a member of the student council at
North Lamar High School in Paris, Texas, The Paris News reported.
The girl's mother, Edith, died Jan. 31 of undisclosed causes.
   ``Suffice it to say the family has gone through extensive
tragedy during the past week,'' Madden said.
   Linda Bolton, a secretary at the high school, said students were
taking Miss Harvey's death ``really, really hard.''
   ``We have 740 students at the high school here, so all our
students are close, they all know each other,'' she said. She said
counselors had been called in to talk with students, who included
Miss Harvey's brother and sister.
   The IVOX, which is inserted via the neck or groin into the
inferior vena cava, the large vein that brings blood to the heart,
has received Food and Drug Administration approval for up to 10
experimental implants in humans with no better than a 10 percent
chance of survival.
   The inch-wide IVOX bundle of fibers is connected to external
tubes the size of a soda straw. One tube delivers oxygen from a
hospital system or oxygen tank; the other tube removes carbon
dioxide from the body, a waste product of breathing.
   The only alternative for people with acute lung failure is an
extra corporeal oxygenator, a large machine that requires pumping
the blood outside the body.
   ``There were no clinical complications from the use of the
device,'' Madden said in a statement. It was unclear how long
doctors had planned to leave the device inside the girl. FDA
guidelines limit the implants to seven days.
   Doctors emphasized the IVOX is not an artificial lung but a
``lung-assist'' device capable of satisfying half the body's need
for oxygen and for carbon-dioxide removal. But they said it could
lead someday to an artificial lung.
   The inventor, Dr. J.D. Mortensen of CardioPulmonics Inc. in Salt
Lake City, said initial experiments will involve only patients with
acute lung disease, such as pneumonia or smoke inhalation, not
chronic disorders such as cystic fibrosis or emphysema.
   LDS Hospital is one of four medical centers authorized by the
FDA for testing of the IVOX. The others are Hershey Medical Center
at Pennsylvania State University, the University of Michigan
Medical Center in Ann Arbor and the Los Angeles County-University
of Southern California Medical Center.

<HEAD>Newspaper Says Bank Eased Loan Terms For Sen. Durenberger</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sen. Dave Durenberger received loans totaling
nearly $1 million from Commercial State Bank of St. Paul without
collateral and at very low interest from 1979 through 1988, the
Star Tribune reported today.
   Durenberger denied any impropriety.
   Durenberger's personal finances are under investigation by the
Senate Ethics Committee, and the loan information could open a new
avenue of inquiry. Durenberger did not fully disclose some of the
loans as required by Senate rules, the newspaper said.
   The Minnesota Republican's cousin Jack is a vice president in
the bank's commercial lending section, but the senator's staff said
today that Jack Durenberger had nothing to do with the loans.
   ``He had absolutely no involvement in any of the loan
transactions for the senator,'' the senator's press secretary,
Carrie Collins, told The Associated Press.
   Durenberger received 23 loans, most not backed by collateral,
totaling $927,078 from the bank after entering the Senate in 1978,
the newspaper reported.
   The interest rates on many of the loans through 1981 were so low
that industry experts suggested they may not have been profitable
for the bank, the Star Tribune said.
   About half the 23 loans were below the prime lending rate banks
traditionally give their most valued customers.
   Bank officials said the loans were routine for a good customer.
   Six banking experts contacted by the Star Tribune said many of
the loans appeared to be outside standard banking practices.
   The loan history ``doesn't make any sense from a banker's point
of view,'' said Michael Pint, a former state banking commissioner.
   Pint and other experts who commented on the loans weren't told
the identity of the bank or the name of the borrower, but knew it
was a political figure, the newspaper said.
   ``If it happened at my bank, heads would roll,'' said Jim
Burkholder, chief operating officer of Investors Savings Bank in
Minneapolis. ``It's not prudent to do that ... and based on what
I've seen, it appears it smacks of seeking to influence a public
official.''
   ``You just don't make loans like that because they are losers,''
said Pint, president of Central Financial Services and former chief
finance officer of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis.
   Bert McKasy, Durenberger's chief of staff, provided details of
the loans to the Star Tribune and set up an interview with
Commercial State's president.
   McKasy said Durenberger did nothing wrong in obtaining the loans
and simply took the best interest rate available.
   Bank officials said they gave the loans to Durenberger because
he was a good customer and because they hoped he might return to
Minnesota after leaving office and promote the bank to his friends.
   Bank officials said they never contacted Durenberger for help in
his official role.
   ``We feel our relationship was absolutely above board. It was a
very typical relationship,'' said Bank Chairman Victor Reim.
   Bank President Richard Kastner said Commercial State was never
at risk.
   Durenberger, who refused to be interviewed, provided a written
statement outlining his relationship with the bank. He called Reim
a close friend and said he began banking at Commercial in 1975.
   ``I never asked for any special consideration from the bank and
don't believe I was ever extended any,'' Durenberger said.

   State officials say they're not sure how
to respond to an appeals court ruling that segregation still
affects Mississippi's public universities because they can't
mandate where students will go to school.
   ``How to integrate the universities in Mississippi is a question
beyond me. It's very complicated _ a very thorny-type issue,'' said
State College Board member Sidney Rushing of Gulfport. ``You can't
force students to attend.''
   Gov. Ray Mabus said Wednesday that many education reforms being
considered by lawmakers would improve conditions at all the
colleges, but declined to comment directly on the court's action.
   ``There are still areas in which we need to work harder and we
have made progress.''
   The governor said the universities would benefit from improved
literacy programs and other measures to improve the quality and
quantity of high school graduates.
   The 2-1 decision Tuesday by a 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
panel in New Orleans overturned a lower court ruling in a lawsuit
by blacks over policies at Mississippi's five historically white
and three historically black universities.
   The court sent the case back to U.S. District Judge Neal B.
Biggers Jr., who had dismissed the lawsuit in 1987, declaring
Mississippi's university system sufficiently desegregated.
   Historically white Southern Mississippi, Delta State,
Mississippi State, Mississippi University for Women, and the
University of Mississippi enjoy distinct advantages over
historically black Alcorn State, Jackson State and Mississippi
Valley State universities, the panel ruled.
   More than 99 percent of the state's 26,953 white college
students were enrolled in historically white institutions during
the 1985-86 school year, while 71 percent of 12,826 black students
were enrolled in historically black schools, the court said.
   House Speaker Tim Ford and others argue the Legislature tries to
promote integration and to equitably fund all eight universities.
   ``I don't see what else we can do, other than mandating where
people can go,'' Ford said.
   Mississippi spent an average $1,351 in 1960 and $8,516 in 1986
per student enrolled at historically white institutions. The
average at historically black schools was $718 in 1960 and $6,038
in 1986, the court said.
   Legislators say little new money can be squeezed out of the
overburdened state budget.
   Appeals court judges Irving Goldberg and Sam D. Johnson said the
black colleges are still inferior and ``there remains in
Mississippi's higher educational system vestiges of discrimination
which distort the perceptions of black students'' 15 years after a
lawsuit was filed against the higher education system.
   There is no formal plan for desegregating the eight
universities, although presidents are encouraged to strive for a
racially mixed enrollment by recruiting blacks and whites.
   ``If the state of Mississippi continues with its tradition, it
will delay any changes as long as possible,'' said state Sen. Doug
Anderson, chairman of the Senate Universities and Colleges
Committee. ``What we do know is at the predominantly white
institutions, there is very little black faculty. And there is also
the discriminatory way appropriations have been made to
predominantly black institutions. Historically, they've received
fewer dollars and less attractive, new programs.
   ``This case is very important to the survival of black
institutions. Right now, the lowest salaries, the worst facilities
are at predominantly black institutions.''
   The College Board can ask the three-member panel of the court to
reconsider the ruling or ask the full 15-member court to take up
the case.
   College Board attorney Bill Goodman of Jackson said he is sure
the ruling will be considered by the full court. ``I'd rather do my
talking in the courtroom,'' he said, declining further comment.
   State Rep. Aaron Henry, president of the Mississippi NAACP,
appealed to students and administrators of traditionally
white-dominated schools to be more accepting of black students.
   ``Racism is America's No. 1 problem. This ruling about
Mississippi gives a true portrait of Mississippi, but in any other
state the ruling could have been the same,'' said Henry.
   In his dissent, Judge John Duhe said Mississippi had fulfilled
its legal obligation to open its universities to all students,
regardless of race.
   The lawsuit was filed in 1975 by Jake Ayers of Glen Allen on
behalf of his son, Jake Ayers Jr., a high school student, and 20
other black students. The younger Ayers later attended junior
college but dropped out to join the Air Force.
   Ayers' widow, Lillian Ayers, said she has another son who will
graduate from high school this year.
   ``Hopefully he will benefit from the change,'' Mrs. Ayers said.

<HEAD>Supervisors Back Away From Blocking View of Wright Civic Center</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN RAFAEL, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Bowing to protests from
preservationists, the county has backed away from a plan to build a
box-like jail that would have blocked a view of the only government
building designed by Frank Lloyd Wright.
   The Marin County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday agreed to
consider burying the jail in a hillside next to the Wright-designed
Civic Center.
   Supervisors made the decision after being told by the California
Preservation Foundation that they would ``live with their mistake
forever because the world will not let you forget.''
   The alternative plan would be similar to one rejected by voters
two years ago when they turned down a half-cent sales tax to
finance an underground jail.
   The Civic Center, on which ground was broken in 1960, was
Wright's last commission before his death in 1959 at age 92. The
three-story center, with its long rows of crescent-shaped arches,
low dome and spire, is a landmark for residents and motorists.
   The county is under court order to replace or expand its
overcrowded, 110-bed jail, a 22-year-old building in San Rafael. It
also is running out of time to qualify for $10 million in state
jail-improvement funds.
   About 150 people, who came together under the banner of Save Our
Civic Center, argued at the meeting that a jail could compromise
the center's eventual designation as a national landmark and would
destroy a major work of art.
   Board chairman Robert Roumiguiere instructed the county planning
staff to bring the underground proposal back for consideration in
60 days.

   A 5-month-old girl starved to death
while her parents were on a weekend drinking binge, police said.
   Doris Franklin, 32, and Eddie James Amous, 39, were jailed on
$7,500 bail each on manslaughter charges Tuesday. Amous also was
charged with violating probation and Ms. Franklin with public
intoxication and disorderly conduct.
   The infant, Brittany Franklin, and four siblings, ages 1, 2, 4
and 5, were left in the care of their 11-year-old brother Friday
afternoon. He found Brittany dead in bed Sunday morning, police
said.
   The boy said the baby fell off a bed and hit her head Saturday
night, said Sgt. Fred Clanton. But an autopsy revealed the child
died of starvation.
   Clanton said the couple drank at an unlicensed club Friday
night, all day Saturday and Sunday morning without checking on the
children. The 11-year-old had tried unsuccessfully to feed the
girl, who apparently was malnourished before the weekend, Clanton
said.
   There was food in the house but ``only cereal and stuff like
that _ not the kind of stuff you'd want to give a baby,'' Clanton
said.
   The five surviving children were taken into state custody and
later turned over to their grandparents.
   ``I talked to the mother about noon Sunday and she was crying a
little bit. I'm not sure if it was hearing the baby was dead or
because she got caught,'' Clanton said.

   A police officer aiming for a dog
that had taken after her partner instead shot the officer in both

   The officers were investigating a burglar alarm at a home Monday
afternoon when they were attacked in the back yard.
   Officer Laverne Davis, 29, said she was shooting at a mixed

hit Sgt. Larry Anderson, authorities said.
   Anderson, 44, was treated for the wounds and a dog bite to the
forearm and released from Santa Monica Hospital Medical Center,
said hospital spokesman Ted Braun.
   Ms. Davis was scratched but didn't require treatment,
authorities said.
   The mixed collie shepherd, which allegedly bit Anderson, was
treated for a hip injury at a Santa Monica veterinary hospital. The
retriever was put in temporary quarantine at a shelter.
   Both dogs were up to date on their shots, said shelter
supervisor John Sanchez.
   The dogs' owner, Peter Levin, 19, insisted the animals are
sweet, but will go after people if they're provoked.

<HEAD>Treasury: No Clear Evidence Tax Overhaul Reduced Investment in
U.S.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There is no clear evidence that the 1986 tax
overhaul, which killed a special break for capital gains, reduced
the level of investment in the United States, the Treasury
Department told Congress on Wednesday.
   President Bush has made restoration of the capital gains break a
major initiative of his administration, contending it's necessary
to increase investment.
   At a House Ways and Means Committee hearing on the impact of the
1986 law, Kenneth W. Gideon, assistant secretary of the treasury
for tax policy, said skeptics had predicted investment would
decline and that growth of key industries would be stymied.
   ``The predicted short-run decrease in aggregate equipment
investment has apparently failed to materialize,'' Gideon said.
``Such investment has actually experienced a post-1986-act surge as
a result of technology-driven increases and expenditures on office,
computing and accounting machinery, and an increased growth in
output demanded by other sectors of the economy.''
   It could be that investment might have been higher without the
act, which also ended a special credit for investment while
reducing the corporate tax rate from 46 percent to 34 percent. Or,
it may be too soon to judge, Gideon said.
   ``In any case, there is no clear evidence that the 1986 act
affected the level of investment,'' Gideon said.
   Nevertheless, Gideon and Internal Revenue Service Commissioner
Fred T. Goldberg Jr. renewed the administration's plea for cutting
capital gains taxes.
   ``In order to remain competitive, incentives for savings and
investment must be improved,'' Gideon said.
   Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., said the
administration was offering the wrong solution.
   ``Until the deficit can be significantly reduced, no tax system
crafted by Congress will cure the economic ills of this country,
while the passage of special tax breaks will only create more
economic distortions,'' he said.
   Capital gains, profits from the sale of stock and other
investments, are fully taxed at the same rates applying to wages
and other income. Bush has proposed exempting up to 30 percent of
gains from taxation.
   While Rostenkowski repeated that he will resist any cut in
capital gains taxes, he said the committee will always consider how
to make the tax system simpler.
   The need for more simplification was the central theme of most
witnesses who testified Wednesday.
   ``We are imposing an unacceptable burden on taxpayers and our
system of tax administration,'' Goldberg said.
   Rep. Bill Archer of Texas, senior Republican on the committee
and a foe of the 1986 overhaul, said the new law imposed layers of
complexity even while advocates were proclaiming it as
simplification.
   ``As a lawyer and member of this committee for 17 years, I have
always prided myself on doing my own tax return,'' Archer said.
``Last year I could not do it.''
   Among other judgments on the 1986 act:
   _Proposals to restore a capital gains break threaten the new
law, said Robert S. McIntyre, director of Citizens for Tax Justice,
a labor-backed research organization. ``Tax reform is working _ at
least for now,'' he said. ``The question facing Congress today is
whether reform will be saved or scuttled.''
   _``The tradeoff of certain credits and deductions for lower
statutory rates has contributed to overall efficiency in the
allocation of capital resources and, thus, had a positive effect on
economic growth,'' said Harry Sullivan, senior vice president of
the Food Marketing Institute, speaking for a coalition that
includes 100 of the Fortune 500 corporations.
   _While praising the law for removing 6 million lower-income
people from the tax rolls, William Lucy, secretary-treasurer of the
American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, said
its passage led many states into ill-advised tax cuts, resulting in
reduced services for citizens.
   _Don Fuqua, president of Aerospace Industries Association of
America, said the law, by eliminating a special accounting method,
makes it more difficult for long-term contractors to compete and
threatens efforts ``to keep this nation a leader in technological
development.''
   _Michael J. Miller of the Independent Petroleum Association of
America said that because of a reduction of tax benefits, the 1986
law ``is having a severe impact on an already depressed industry.''

   It wasn't part of the show when
pieces of wood dropped from the ceiling at Walt Disney World's
Haunted House, slightly injuring five people.
   The visitors had just started a ride through the attraction
Tuesday when the machinery that operates the walls and ceiling of a
darkened chamber jolted to a halt.
   Pieces of the ceiling molding fell on an open car containing the
visitors, who were treated for cuts and bruises, Disney spokesman
John Dreyer said.
   The chamber has portraits on the walls and ``stretches'' to
dramatize macabre scenes below each portrait. It is automatically
operated by a system of cables and pulleys.
   ``It got hung up. I don't know how it happened,'' said Dreyer. A
handful of wood pieces ``no heavier than the molding in your
house'' fell, he said.
   The ride was promptly stopped and everyone evacuated while
workers inspected the equipment, Dreyer said.

   State Sen. Jim West proposed marriage to
his girlfriend Wednesday from the Senate floor. She said yes, but
he knew she would.
   West wrote a note to Ginger Marshall, who was watching from the
gallery. He told her he planned to rise on the Senate floor and ask
for her hand but, like all politicians, he wasn't about to ask the
question until he knew the answer.
   Marshall read West's note and nodded yes before he rose to
inform his colleagues that he had just proposed to Marshall.
   She hurried down from the gallery and the two stood for applause
at the front of the Senate chamber.
   ``Why did I do it like this? Because we're in love,'' West said.
   Neither West, 38, nor Marshall, 27, has ever been married. The
couple plan a December wedding.

   You might call it Dial-A-Thief.
   When Stephen Dente of Londonderry heard from his wife that
someone had stolen his pickup, he dialed the truck's phone.
   ``Hello,'' came the reply. Dente was shocked and didn't say
anything. The thief hung up. He called back and the thief answered
again.
   Dente said he told the thief that police were hot on his trail.
The thief left the phone off the hook and Dente said he heard at
least three people talking.
   Dente said he began shouting into the phone and told the thieves
his truck was equipped with an anti-theft radio transmitter that
can be tracked by police.
   Dente said the thieves talked among themselves, then the line
went dead.
   His next call was to police.
   On his third call to his missing truck, he reached a recorded
message saying his phone was not in service either because no one
was in the vehicle or the phone was turned off.
   The truck was stolen Monday and still was missing Wednesday.

   High school students have agreed to end
a five-day boycott of the school cafeteria, which cost the school's
food services company up to $3,500, after the company offered to
give $1,000 a year in scholarships.
   Students at Apponequet Regional High School launched the boycott
in response to a 10 percent increase in the price of a la carte
items such as pizza, hot dogs and ice cream. Prices were raised to
pay for spoiled food and cleanup costs associated with a freezer
that broke down undetected during a weekend in December.
   ``The feeling of the kids is that we don't feel we should have
to pay for something that is not in our control. There should have
been someone there when the freezer broke,'' Student Council
President Beth Brooks said.
   The price increase remains, but students will get seven days'
notice of any new increases, said Peter W. Babbitt, ARA's district
manager.
   In addition, they will be ``more involved in the monthly review
process'' of food service operations, he said. He could not say
exactly what form that involvement would take, however.
   And the company, based in Philadelphia, will offer two $500
scholarships to graduating seniors starting this year, Babbitt said.
   Students voted Tuesday to discontinue the boycott. Most of the
school's 800 students had refused to eat in the cafeteria.
   Babbitt said the boycott cost ARA between $600 and $700 a day.
He expected sales to return to normal starting Thursday.
   ARA Services had asked the Freetown-Lakeville Regional School
Committee to approve the 10 percent price increase last month to
offset a $2,800 food loss caused by the broken freezer. ARA
Services also claimed an additional $2,600 in labor costs for
cleanup for a total $5,400 loss.

<TEXT>
   The insurance industry called Wednesday for
federal help in the wake of last fall's California earthquake,
saying it would be unable to bear the costs of a major tremor.
   ``Insurers cannot finance a catastrophic earthquake,'' Franklin
W. Nutter, chairman of an insurance industry coalition on quake
dangers, told a House Banking subcommittee on insurance.
   ``While it is not possible to predict insured losses from all
events at all locations ... it is safe to say that the (earthquake)
peril presents the industry with a loss of catastrophic
proportions,'' said John P. Drennan, a vice president of Allstate
Insurance Co.
   There is a nationwide threat of earthquakes, said Arch C.
Johnston of the Center for Earthquake Research and Information at
Memphis State University.
   A ``major destructive earthquake in the eastern United States is
the quintessential example of the low-probability-high-consequence
event that invites complacency and defeats mitigation efforts. It
is also the nightmare of the insurance industry,'' Johnston said.
   The long-term solution to quake damage is to design and build
tremor-resistant buildings, Grant C. Peterson of the Federal
Emergency Management Agency told the subcommittee. But he said his
agency is studying possible loss-reduction provisions that could be
included in a federal insurance program if one is developed.
   Drennan said that if the 1906 San Francisco quake ocurred today
insured losses would total at least $3.4 billion, and a repeat of
the 1811-12 tremor at New Madrid, Mo., would mean paying $1.7
billion.
   Nutter, however, estimated insured quake claims in another 1906
San Francisco quake could climb to $13.5 billion, with billions
more in fire losses and bodily injury claims.
   Nutter proposed establishing a federal earthquake insurance
program similar to the government's flood insurance _ backed by
federal money but administered by private companies.
   Any federal insurance program must include requirements that
efforts be made to reduce quake damage, said George Bernstein of
the National Earthquake Hazards Review Program.
   Insurance is an efficient way to reimburse people for their
losses, Bernstein testified, ``but without hazard mitigation, the
guaranty of compensation from insurance will also create an
incentive for irresponsible construction in disregard of known
earthquake hazards.''
   The flood insurance program imposes requirements for house
siting and strengthening to reduce damage, he said.
   ``The earthquake risk may be different, but the principle is the
same.''
   Paying billions of dollars in claims could reduce insurance
company funds to the point where they might have to stop issuing
new policies, Nutter said, adding that if companies were forced to
sell investments to pay claims there could be a severe decline in
the stock and bond markets.
   Nutter proposed establishing a federal corporation that would
organize earthquake coverage, investing premiums in government
bonds as a surplus to pay any claims.
   If the surplus were not sufficient, federal borrowing authority
would be available, he said.
   Nutter also urged that homeowners whose mortgages were federally
insured or held by federally insured institutions be required to
have earthquake insurance. That would widen the base of premiums,
lowering average cost and increasing the surplus available, he said.

<TEXT>
   Conservative Republican lawmakers on Wednesday
questioned the impact on business of legislation guaranteeing the
rights of the disabled.
   Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas and chairman of the Republican Study
Committee Task Force on Competitiveness, said that he and his
colleagues were concerned that the Americans with Disabilities Act
``may be moving too quickly through Congress to explore the impact
it will have on our businesses, on our judicial system and on our
nation's productivity as a whole.''
   Equal Employment Opportunity Commissioner Evan J. Kemp Jr. told
DeLay's group that President Bush ``knows the issues; he knows
everything backwards and forwards in this area'' and fully supports
the legislation.
   Kemp said more than 8 million disabled Americans could be
brought into the work force through the employment-protection
provisions of the law, saving the government $300 billion in
welfare and other payments.
   The bill is also intended to ensure that the nation's 43 million
disabled people have full access to shops, restaurants, lodging and
other public accommodations.
   Kemp was one of several witnesses at a task force hearing on the
legislation, which the Senate passed in September on a 76-8 vote.
   The bill has since cleared one of the four House committees with
jurisdiction and is expected to be passed by the full chamber this
year.
   Critics, particularly small-business interests and bus
operators, contend that definitions in the law are vague and that
its costs are immeasurable.
   Carolyn L. Weaver, a resident scholar at the conservative
American Enterprise Institute, said the act would raise labor
costs, inhibit job formation and possibly lead to ``an undesirable
distribution of gainers and losers.''
   The proposed legislation would phase in employment-rights
provisions over three years but exempt businesses with 15 or fewer
employees. The legislation requires all businesses to provide
``reasonable accommodation'' to disabled patrons unless those
adjustments would create an ``undue hardship.''

<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China's new envoy to Hong Kong greeted the
British colony's elite Wednesday with a speech designed to bolster
confidence as the territory approaches Chinese rule in 1997.
   In his first public appearance since arriving Monday, senior
diplomat Zhou Nan acknowledged that China and Britain have
disagreed on Hong Kong policy.
   ``Though some difficulties have emerged recently, I believe that
both sides share the desire to have them resolved as soon as
possible,'' Zhou said.
   He expressed hope that Britain and China would ``continue to
cooperate sincerely with each other to strive for a brigther future
for Hong Kong.''
   Zhou, 62, is the new head of the Xinhua News Agency's office in
Hong Kong, which functions as China's diplomatic mission to the
colony. He takes the post at a troubling time for the territory,
whose citizens were shaken when Chinese troops brutally suppressed
the pro-democracy movement in Beijing in June 1989.
   The diplomat spoke at a Lunar New Year cocktail reception given
by Xinhua and attended by everal thousand people.
   Britain and China have been at odds on a number of issues
concerning Hong Kong, most prominently the pace of introducing
political change. China's proposals for the post-1997 legislature
have been widely condemned as not democratic enough.
   Beijing also has opposed Britain's plan to offer citizenship to
50,000 Hong Kong residents and their families and has accused the
colonial government of allowing the territory to become a base for
subversion against China.
   Zhou's speech is the second signal in as many days that China
wants to improve relations with Britain. On Tuesday, Premier Li
Peng said Beijing viewed relations with Britain as important and
hoped they would develop.
   In a joint declaration with Britain, China said Hong Kong could
keep capitalism for 50 years after 1997 and enjoy a ``high degree
of autonomy.'' Zhou said China would live up to its obligations
under the agreement.

   The Rev. Jesse Jackson arrived
Wednesday for talks with South African leaders and said he hoped to
see Nelson Mandela freed and ``walking down the streets of
Johannesburg'' before he leaves.
   Jackson gave a thumbs-up sign as he arrived at the airport for
his 12-day visit, ignoring shouts from a handful of white
right-wingers who shouted, ``Jesse, go home!''
   He was protected by two lines of black and white policeman. A
black man started a brief chorus of ``Welcome, Jesse'' among black
airport workers lining the balconies.
   Jackson, granted a visa for the first time since his 1979 visit,
said he hoped to encourage unity among black political factions and
to ``address the unfounded fears of the whites.''
   The American civil rights leader plans to meet President F.W. de
Klerk, Foreign Minister Pik Botha and leaders of the anti-apartheid
movement. He and his wife, Jackie, were greeted at the airport by
African National Congress leader Walter Sisulu, his wife,
Albertina, and church leaders Rev. Allan Boesak and Frank Chikane.
   ``This is a moment in South Africa's history that must be
seized,'' Jackson said. ``If the government moves back, there will
be chaos. If it stands still, there will be tension. But if the
government seizes the political moment and moves forward, we will
see the dawn of a new, free and democratic South Africa.''
   Jackson declined to say whether he had requested a meeting with
Mandela, the ANC leader who is expected to be released soon after
more than 27 years in prison.
   ``I have no commitment from the government to meet him,''
Jackson said. ``I hope to see him walking down the streets of
Johannesburg. The whole world hopes to see him free.''
   In Cape Town, the pro-apartheid Conservative Party vowed to
stage white protests and strikes to drive de Klerk from office and
block his plans to share power with the black majority.
   Koos van der Merwe, chief spokesman for the Conservatives, the
main white opposition party, said de Klerk deceived whites last
week by suddenly legalizing the African National Congress guerrilla
movement and more than 60 other anti-apartheid groups.
   He said de Klerk promised during the September election not to
deal with the ANC until it abandoned violence. ``We will keep the
pressure on him ... until he has no choice but to call a general
election,'' van der Merwe said.
   Under the constitution, which de Klerk wants to replace with one
produced in negotiations with blacks, the president has the sole
power to call a parliamentary election. But if large numbers of
whites joined a general strike, they could bring the government to
a standstill, halt most transportation and close businesses,
schools and hospitals.
   The Conservative Party promised its actions against de Klerk
would be peaceful. But an extreme-right, Nazi-style group called
the Afrikaner Resistance Movement, which has been involved in
violent confrontations with blacks, promised to protest Jackson's
appearances throughout the country during his tour.

   The House approved a $42 million aid package
for Panama today that lawmakers said will help the Central American
country boost its damaged economy.
   The measure, which was approved by a voice vote, also includes
$10 million to help newly emerging democracies in Eastern Europe
prepare for elections.
   Rep. Gerald Solomon, R-N.Y., called the $42 million a way of
``finishing the course that `Just Cause' began. It combines aid,
trade and investment.'' The Pentagon dubbed the Dec. 20 U.S.
invasion of Panama ``Operation Just Cause.''
   The Senate Foreign Relations Committee has endorsed a similiar
package for Panama, and the Senate is expected to approve it
shortly.
   The Senate Finance Committee today waived the normal 45-day
review period and voted unanimously to lift the trade sanctions
imposed two years ago because of Panama's involvement then in drug
trafficking.
   Restoring the most-favored-nation and Caribbean Basin tariff
preferences are part of identical packages approved Tuesday by
House and Senate committees.
   Bush has said he wants to provide as much as $1 billion to
Panama, and intends to introduce legislation later to funnel more
money to the country.
   Several House members objected to rerouting $30 million from
accounts for Africa to Panama, even though the administration has
promised to restore the money later in the year.
   ``We are raiding the African account for the third time in
recent years,'' said Rep. Mervyn Dymally, D-Calif.
   Others said they want the administration to ensure Panama lifts
secrecy restrictions on its banks to prevent drug traffickers from
laundering profits.
   Former President Ronald Reagan imposed the trade and investment
sanctions in March 1988 as part of a U.S. effort to drive Manuel
Antonio Noriega out of office as Panama's leader.
   ``We have a new regime in Panama, one which we expect will be
much more cooperative than the last in helping us in the war on
drugs,' said the finance committee's chairman, Sen. Lloyd Bentsen,
D-Texas.
   Bernard Aronson, assistant secretary of state for inter-American
affairs, told the House panel Panama's economy has declined by 16
percent over the past two years, while unemployment is more than 25
percent. The country's foreign debt has grown to $4 billion,
freezing prospects for new borrowing, he said.
   But he added, ``Panama is not a basket case.'' U.S. aid is
intended ``simply to help them do what they can and wish to do for
themselves.''
   The legislation would provide an immediate $12.5 million in cash
and an additional $10 million in guarantees to rebuild the Panama
City's Chorillo neighborhood, where fires in the wake of the
invasion left 10,000 people homeless.
   The measure also would provide $7 million for emergency public
works and jobs programs; $5.5 million to help agencies of the new
government of President Guillermo Endara prepare budgets, and
reorganize and train workers; $5 million to help looted businesses
reopen their doors; and $2 million to begin training a new police
force and start up a new judiciary.
   In addition, the bill certifies Panama is taking steps to
cooperate with the war on drugs, including combatting trafficking
and money laundering that flourished under Noriega. The statement
would permit Panama to resume receiving favorable trade treatment
and to benefit from the Caribbean Basin Initiative and investment
incentives, aid the administration values at up to $500 million.
   In the next week, the administration will formally ask for an
additional $500 million in cash aid for Panama, including: $185
million for the country's banks to provide liquidity for private
sector lending; $145 million for a government program to generate
investment and create jobs; $20 million for more police training
and judicial reform; $20 million for private sector export
promotion; and $130 million toward clearing Panama's debts to
international development banks to make the country eligible for
new lending.
   Meanwhile, a delegation of protesters including actor Edward
Asner delivered a petition to the White House today calling on
President Bush to ``withdraw the troops now, restore sovereignty to
Panama and make reparations to the civilian victims (of the U.S.
invasion) immediately.''

   A long-orbiting satellite rescued by
a space shuttle crew last month shows some deterioration but not
enough to halt NASA's plans for a permanent manned space station, a
project scientist said Wednesday.
   ``There is nothing here to indicate you can't proceed with the
space station,'' William Kinard told reporters who viewed the Long
Duration Exposure Facility in a sterile room where it is undergoing
preliminary examination after six years in space.
   Kinard reported the 11-ton satellite, sent into orbit to
determine how durable various materials would be in space, was
peppered with thousands, ``perhaps as many as 10,000,'' of tiny
bits of space dust called micrometeoroids.
   He based the estimate on a count of 40 visible hits on one small
section of the LDEF satellite, the size of a small school bus. He
said the largest crater was 5 millimeters in diameter, about
one-fifth of an inch.
   Kinard said several spacecraft materials suffered minor erosion
from the wearing effects of atomic oxygen and ultraviolet
radiation, and that in some instances the micrometeoroid craters
were further damaged by the introduction of these elements.
   He said the crater count enabled researchers to ``establish a
data base on micrometeoroid impacts in space.''
   Because the damage was not excessive, he said, this should
provide confidence for those planning to build NASA's space station
Freedom with assembly of the big manned laboratory slated to start
in orbit in 1995.
   Kinard said the aluminum struts which form the main body of LDEF
``were very intact ... I would fly this spacecraft again.''
Aluminum will be the principal metal used in the space station.
   He said the atomic oxygen erosion of other materials was ``about
what we expected. I don't think it is a real problem for the space
station. It just means they have to use materials not subject to
atomic oxygen erosion, especially on the leading edge.''
   Kinard said there was some discoloration and that foil covering
some experiments had torn.
   ``But that's why we sent it up there, to find out what happens
to materials after a long time in the space environment,'' Kinard
said. ``We're delighted with the condition.''
   LDEF was retrieved from orbit on Jan. 12 by the crew of the
space shuttle Columbia, just weeks before gravity would have tugged
it to fiery destruction in the atmosphere.
   It was brought here Jan. 26, and since then technicians and
scientists have been examining it.
   There are 57 experiment trays containing various test materials
on board. Kinard said these will be removed starting about Feb. 20
for detailed studies by principal investigators.
   The first tray to be removed contains 12.5 million tomato seeds,
which will be distributed to students at various grades around the
country for tests to see how they grow after so long in space.

   An unemployed maintenance man suspected in
the slayings of four family members who were tied up, shot and set
afire in their home died today in a shootout with police, and his
mother was arrested, authorities said.
   State Police said it was not clear whether 33-year-old Anthony
Turner, who was sitting on a bed and holding a shotgun to his chin
when police entered his apartment to arrest him, killed himself or
was slain by police gunfire.
   Authorities carried a warrant charging Turner _ also known as
Michael Kinge _ with murder in the Dec. 22 slayings of Warren
Harris, 39; his wife, Dolores, 41; and their children, ages 11 and
15.
   Authorities also arrested Turner's mother, Shirley Kinge, 54,
and turned over to social workers a 2-year-old taken from her
apartment and believed to be Turner's child.
   State Police Superintendent Thomas Constantine said Ms. Kinge
would be charged in connection with the slayings but he would not
say what charges would be filed.
   ``We are very relieved of course. It's brought a lot of emotion
back, and now it's kind of a reality to me. We are very relieved,
we are very excited, we are very glad,'' said Pat Lake of Manlius,
whose husband, Don, is a brother of Mrs. Harris.
   The Harrises were tied up, shot in the back of the head and
hours later doused with fuel and set on fire in upstairs bedrooms
at their home, set far back from a road on a large wooded lot in
this affluent Ithaca suburb.
   The bodies were discovered the next day after firefighters had
put out the blaze.
   Police have said robbery appears the most likely motive for the
killings. Mrs. Harris ran a country gifts and antiques store just a
few yards from the house. Her husband was a sales director for an
electronics distributor.
   On the day the bodies were found, a man and woman used the
Harrises' credit cards to buy clothing, electronics and diamonds at
malls in suburban Syracuse and Auburn.
   Clerks at those stores helped a police artist draw sketches of
the people who used the cards.
   Maj. Robert J. Farrand said the investigators focused on Turner
as the result of identifications given by people who had seen
composite drawings released by authorities. Farrand said there were
no other suspects.
   Turner had a long criminal history in New York City, including
convictions for burglary and theft with a deadly weapon, police
said.
   Turner was holding a gun to his chin when authorities entered,
said Constantine. The man turned toward police and fired once, and
the three officers returned fire, he said. Constantine said an
autopsy would be performed.

   Three store employees who tried to stop four
people suspected of shoplifting were kicked black and blue, and a
policeman found himself looking down the barrel of a gun _ wielded
by a 2-year-old.
   The merchandise that allegedly wasn't paid for was destroyed in
the melee. The women were jailed.
   Officers said employees of a Marshalls department store reported
the women walked out of the store Monday without paying for some
clothing they were carrying.
   Three male employees chased the women to the parking lot, where
a fight broke out.
   By the time police arrived, the fight had broken up and the
women were in their car.
   Officer Charles Bledsoe said that when he approached the womens'
car he saw a gun being pointed at him from inside.
   Bledsoe discovered the gun was being held by a 2-year-old boy,
who was then disarmed.
   The four women arrested were all from Nacogdoches.
   A spokesman at the Smith County Jail said two were charged with
felony robbery. Municipal Court Judge Diane DeVasto set their bail
at $15,000 each. The third was charged with unlawfully carrying a
weapon and the fourth with theft, and their bail was set at $1,000
each.
   The store employees all suffered bruises on their legs from
being kicked repeatedly, police said.

   Blacks are twice as likely as whites to have
vision problems that cannot be corrected with glasses, according to
a survey of more than 5,300 people over age 40.
   The study's authors could not explain the finding and were ``in
the process of exploring what those reasons might be,'' said James
M. Tielsch, co-author of the study that appears in this month's
Archives of Ophthalmology.
   It was conducted over a four-year period in east Baltimore, a
working-class section, and was designed to provide data typical of
multiracial urban populations in the United States, said Tielsch,
an ophthalmology professors at Johns Hopkins' Wilmer Eye Institute.
   Almost 12 percent of those studied were visually impaired even
though they wore glasses and saw an eye doctor regularly.
   ``This translates nationally to more than 9 million people,''
Tielsch said Tuesday.
   ``The good news is that two-thirds to three-quarters of those
were correctable, that is they could move out of the visual
impairment category just by the provision of the proper pair of
spectacles.''
   The study defined impairment as vision of 20-40 and legal
blindness as vision of 20-200.
   The study's two principal findings were that, ``For both visual
impairment and for blindness, at every age blacks have a higher
proportion of people affected than whites,'' Tielsch said. ``The
second point is that there's a dramatic increase with increasing
age in both the proportion of people affected from visual
impairment and blindness.''
   The study found visual impairment in 2.2 percent of whites and
3.94 percent of the blacks. Of the whites, 0.43 percent were
legally blind, compared with 1.02 percent of blacks.
   Among both race, the researchers projected that more than 3
million people nationwide could see no better than 20-40 even with
the strongest glasses. Of those, more than 890,000 are legally
blind.
   The study found that in the oldest age group, those over 80,
more than 25 percent were blind or visually impaired because of eye
disease, said Tielsch, whose co-author was Dr. Alfred Sommer.
   East Baltimore was chosen because socio-economic conditions of
blacks and whites in the area are similar. The area is poor to
middle class and has a higher rate of rental housing than the rest
of the city and country, the study said.
   ``We chose Baltimore to serve as a model for the rest of urban
America,'' Tielsch said.
   ``It's a credible study by a credible group. They do good
work,'' said Dr. Barbara Klein, an ophthalmology professor at the
University of Wisconsin. ``(The study) was done the right way and
from their credibility it's likely to be quite true.''
   About 50 percent of those interviewed for the study were black.
None of the participants was a resident of a nursing home, hospital
or institution for the blind.
   All the participants were given an eye examination, and about
one-third were given a complete exam at Wilmer.

   Gov. James R. Thompson today signed
legislation allowing riverboat gambling on the Mississippi and
Illinois rivers beginning next year.
   The gambling ``is not designed to make money for the state,''
Thompson said in a statement, ``but rather help local economies by
stimulating tourism and economic development revenues for the
municipalities that want it.''
   The governor also appointed a five-member gaming board to
oversee the floating casinos.
   Supporters say the legislation will give Illinois an edge over
Iowa in the race for tourism dollars. Riverboat gambling becomes
legal in Iowa in April 1991.
   The Illinois measure will provide five licenses, each allowing
two riverboats, for a total of as many as eight floating casinos on
the Mississippi River and two on the Illinois River beginning in
1991.
   The gaming board may issue five additional licenses, for two
riverboats each, in 1992. One such license is designated for the
Des Plaines River.
   In signing the legislation, Thompson urged the Legislature to
correct what he described as minor flaws in the bill.
   Among the recommended changes is a $500 limit on the amount a
person could lose during an excursion. Sponsors of the gambling
legislation said the limit was inadvertently left out of the bill
approved in January.

   Scores of people wounded in nine days of
war between Lebanon's main Christian armies are dying in hospitals
that have no power and little blood, medicine or clean water,
police said Wednesday.
   They said 365 people had been killed and 1,682 wounded since the
battle for supremacy began Jan. 30 between nearly 20,000 soldiers
commanded by rebel Gen. Michel Aoun and the Lebanese Forces militia
of Samir Geagea, which has about 6,000 regulars and an estimated
30,000 reservists.
   Many of the victims have been civilians, some of them Moslems
killed or wounded by shells that strayed out of Christian territory.
   On Wednesday, families in Christian east Beirut searched for
relatives in hospitals where surgeons operated by candlelight.
   Police said food was so short that some people fought over bread
in Christian neighborhoods, where hundreds of thousands of people
have spent a week or more in basements or bomb shelters.
   French Cabinet minister Bernard Kouchner and Rene Ala, the
French ambassador, arranged a 90-minute truce on a single street so
seven ambulances could take seriously wounded people from a
hospital in the Ashrafiyeh district.
   Snipers from both sides fired overhead as the convoy dashed to
evacuate the wounded, who included an 8-month-old baby with a head
wound. They were driven to Beirut airport in the Moslem sector,
where a French jet took them to Paris for treatment, along with
other wounded civilians.
   The French foreign ministry said the plane carried 16 victims
who were transferred to eight hospitals in Paris after their
arrival.
   Meanwhile, mediators representing Maronite Patriarch Nasrallah
Sfeir, the highest ranking Christian prelate in the Christian
enclave, convened a cease-fire committee with representatives from
the two warring factions.
   Christian-controlled radio stations said the meeting lasted six
hours. There was no immediate announcement.
   A police spokesman said Aoun, who has been dismissed as army
commander but refuses to step aside, appeared to be reorganizing
his forces for a major drive against Geagea's besieged strongholds
in the 310-square-mile Christian area north and east of Beirut.
   If Aoun is successful, his control of Christian territory might
be difficult to break even for the 40,000 Syrian soldiers in
Lebanon, with whom Aoun fought a six-month artillery war that ended
in September.
   At a news conference, Aoun blamed the fighting on Geagea and
claimed the United States was using the militia chieftain to force
implementation of a peace plan designed to end Lebanon's
15-year-old civil war.
   Aoun rejects the peace plan because it does not include a
timetable for the withdrawal of the Syrian troops, and he refuses
to recognize President Elias Hrawi, who was elected as part of the
plan.
   Hrawi, Aoun and Geagea are Maronite Cathlics, the Christian sect
that has dominated the government, army and judiciary since
independence from France in 1943. Geagea recognizes Hrawi as
president but has not taken a public position on the peace plan
negotiated last fall at Taif, Saudi Arabia.
   ``The Trojan Horse never said in public he was in favor of the
Taif accord, although he staged his war against the army with
American blessing to enforce implementation of the humiliating
agreement,'' Aoun told the news conference, broadcast by his
station, Radio Lebanon.
   Artillery generally was silent Wednesday, allowing civilians to
emerge from shelters and search for food and missing relatives,
said the police spokesman, whose name cannot be used under standing
regulations.
   ``We received several calls from hospitals asking us to send
patrols to deal with thousands of nervous and worried people
inquiring about missing relatives,'' he said.
   ``Many of them had pictures of their missing ones. Others wanted
to have a look at the bodies or the unconscious wounded. The
hospitals didn't have staff to deal with such cases.''
   He said surgeons operated by candlelight, using water boiled on
kerosene stoves.
   Crowds filled the few open bakeries, and some people who didn't
want to wait ``tried to steal a few loaves,'' he said. ``Fistfights
developed.''
   On Tuesday, Aoun achieved his most significant victory by
ousting the Lebanese Forces from their seven barracks in the hills
of Dbaye on Beirut's northern flank.
   That put him in postiion to attack the remaining militia
strongholds in east Beirut and in Kesrouan, Byblos and Batroun
provinces north of the capital.
   Geagea's men are experienced street fighters, however, and Aoun
cannot claim undisputed mastery of the Christian enclave until he
drives them from east Beirut and Jounieh, a port town north of the
city.
   Two-thirds of the 1 million Christians live in east Beirut,
where the militia is entrenched in the Karantina, Ashrafiyeh and
Ein Rummaneh districts, and in Jounieh, where Geagea has total
control.
   Hrawi has hinted at requesting help from the Syrians, who
support him, but their intervention would need advance
international approval. On Tuesday, Hrawi appealed to Western
nations, the Soviet Union, the United Nations and the Arab world
for help in ending the fighting.
   The Syrian soldiers were deployed in Lebanon in 1976 to quell
civil war fighting. Aoun says they violated their peacekeeping
mandate by siding with the Moslems in the civil war.

   Miss America Debbye Turner said she has
only pity for Miss West Virginia Lisa Bittinger, who didn't make
the top 10 in the finals and then groused about the Atlantic City,
N.J., contest.
   ``I feel sorry for Lisa,'' Turner said during a speech at West
Virginia University on Monday night. ``She missed the point
entirely about Miss America.
   ``The point is, isn't it great that in America a black, a
Korean, a Japanese, a kidney transplant and a 95 percent hearing
impaired (person) can become Miss America and achieve success?''
said Turner, who is black.
   Bittinger's comments after the contest about the ethnic makeup
and physical problems of the winners prompted the state chapter of
the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People to
call for her resignation.
   Turner, 24, is a senior in veterinary medicine at the University
of Missouri.
   Telephone messages left on Bittinger's home answering machine
Tuesday and Wednesday were not returned.
   A magistrate ruled in December that Bittinger was in the right
when she pulled a gun on another woman who had kicked out the
window of her car and pulled her hair in a late-night fight over a
man.

   Singers Willie Nelson, John Mellencamp and
Neil Young are preparing for the fourth Farm Aid concert here April
7, but their reception from the farming establishment may not be
terrific.
   The three called a press conference Tuesday and attacked
corporate interests, slow-to-change government farm policies and
the use of chemicals in agriculture.
   ``We're here to call attention ... to the fact that in order to
farm these days, before you can get a loan you have to poison your
land,'' said Nelson, the chairman of Farm Aid.
   The use of pesticides is contaminating the water and killing
populations of rabbits and horned toads, Nelson said. ``If you
can't drink the water, you shouldn't eat the food,'' he said.
   Young condemned the ``superfarms that poison the land and have
no conscience.'' He also said farmland is being overused because of
corporate pressure.
   ``The land is practically dead,'' said Young. ``In the old days
the farmer used to let the land rest. ... We're losing farms to
this kind of thinking.''
   Lt. Gov. Frank O'Bannon, the state's commissioner of
agriculture, joined Gov. Evan Bayh in appearing at the news
conference but said most Hoosier farmers don't share the musicians'
views on getting rid of farm chemicals.
   ``Most of our production farmers have to look at the bottom line
to stay in business,'' O'Bannon said, ``but they want to do it in
an environmentally sound way.''
   The first three Farm Aid concerts raised more than $12 million,
of which $9 million has been distributed to more than 100 farm
organizations, hotlines, churches and service organizations in 41
states.

   Martial arts movie star Chuck Norris said he
will help a couple of international kick boxing champions pay for
their son's funeral. The teen-ager was killed over the weekend in a
gang-related shooting.
   Sonny Rodriguez, 16, was shot in the chest while riding with
friends Saturday in a car in suburban Sylmar, police said.
   His parents, William ``Blinky'' and Lilly Rodriguez are
champions in kick boxing, an Asian sport that allows the use of
feet as well as fists.
   Norris said this week that he was a family friend and knew the
youth.
   ``He was a real good athlete,'' Norris said. ``Blinky and I
trained together and Blinky was always hurrying off to his son's
football games.
   ``They were a very close family and very religious. I lost a
brother in Vietnam, so I can understand how it feels,'' he said.
   Norris said he will contribute to a trust fund to cover funeral
costs. A benefit kick-boxing event at the Hollywood Palladium also
will help pay for the funeral.
   Three young men pulled up beside the auto in which Rodriquez was
in, shouted gang slogans and one fired a handgun, said Los Angeles
police Detective Steve Fisk. Three suspects have been arrested and
charged, police said.

   The improbable story of a lawyer with no writing
experience ending up writing a hit television series is just what
happened to David E. Kelley, the 33-year-old executive producer and
script writer for ``L.A. Law.''
   ``I knew the character names went in the middle of the page.
That was about it. I was a complete novice,'' Kelley said recently
of the days in 1983 when he decided to write a script.
   He wrote it out in longhand, while working for a law firm in
Boston, then spent $1,200 for a word processor and typed it out
``two fingers at a time.''
   ``I remember thinking all I want out of this is to make back the
money for the word processor.''
   The rest is show biz. His script was optioned to eventually
become the film ``From the Hip,'' which starred Judd Nelson. In the
meantime, the option was enough to get him an agent and an
interview with the people looking for someone with legal experience
to work on what ultimately became NBC's Emmy Award-winning series
on lawyers.

<HEAD>Political Clash in Karachi Kills 41</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police battled Moslem sharpshooters
Wednesday after riots between rival political parties, and the
government said at least 41 people had been killed.
   ``This is terrorism,'' said Qaim Ali Shah, chief minister of
Sindh province. ``Innocent people are being killed.''
   The government clamped a 24-hour curfew on two more districts of
Pakistan's sprawling southern port city of Karachi following a day
of clashes between police and sharpshooters, who fired at random
from their rooftop perches.
   The 41 killings Wednesday raised the death toll to 47 since
Monday, when clashes began between supporters of the governing
Pakistan People's Party and the Mohajir Qaumi Movement,
representing Moslems who emigrated from India after British
colonial rule ended in 1947.
   Most of Karachi's 5 million people belong to the immigrant
party, which is based in the troubled province of Sindh.
   ``Most of the people were killed by MQM activists,'' said a
government spokesman who refused to be identified.
   The Mohajirs blame the killings of two party members on
supporters of the governing party.
   Pakistan's official news agency said 120 people were being held
in connection with the daylong shootings. No charges have been
filed yet.
   Soldiers in jeeps with machine guns patrolled the city, deserted
except for police and militant Mohajirs, who called a 24-hour
strike.
   Some of those killed Wednesday died when police tried to
dismantle a roadblock by Mohajir members, a government spokesman
said. Snipers opened fire on the police, and before the gunbattle
ended, as many as 10 people were dead, police said.
   Angry protesters also attacked police stations demanding the
arrest of several People's Party members.
   Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto condemned the killings and blamed
the Mohajirs, without naming their party.
   In her statement, released from Islamabad, Ms. Bhutto complained
about a ``flagrant breach of assurances by a certain political
group to the government that law and order would be maintained in
Karachi during the strike.''
   The Pakistan Peoples Party is supported by Sindh nationalists,
while the Mohajir Qaumi Movement represents people who immigrated
from India after Pakistan's independence in 1947.
   Hundreds of people have been killed and thousands injured in
ethnic clashes between the Sindh nationalists, who want greater
autonomy, and Mohajirs, who want to be recognized as a fifth ethnic
group.

   President Bush visited a Strategic
Defense Initiative research lab today and declared that a missile
defense shield in space ``makes much more sense than ever before.''
   Bush made the pitch for Star Wars in a speech to what he called
the ``under-appreciated'' staff at Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratories, the nerve center of both the Star Wars research
effort and nuclear weapons work.
   The White House also announced Bush has invited West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl to Camp David on Feb. 24-25 to discuss
East-West issues and the prospects for German unification.
   Later, in a speech prepared for delivery to the Commonwealth
Club in San Francisco, Bush said he will not ``predicate the
defense of our people on promising, but as yet unfulfilled, hopes
for the future.''
   ``Let us not forget that right now the Soviets still have more
than 10,000 strategic weapons. They are modernizing them,'' said
Bush.
   ``I am determined to seek with the Soviets the collateral to
implement a new peace. ... '' said Bush. ``We have shown that
American strength is the catalyst for arms control.''
   ``We must not let impatience, born of euphoria, jeopardize all
we hope to achieve,'' said Bush.
   Bush was beating the drum for his defense budget on a
cross-country trip at the same time the Soviet Communist Party's
Central Committee was meeting in Moscow to renounce its
seven-decade old monopoly on power in the Soviet Union.
   After the Commonwealth Club speech, Bush was flying to Omaha,
Neb., to visit Strategic Air Command headquarters Thursday.
   Bush told the Livermore workers the shift toward democracy and
freedom in the East Bloc ``is a direct result of our ability to
stand firm in the face of threats to peace and stability.''
   ``We're working on a significant reduction in arms. I think
that's what the world wants. I believe in it strongly,'' Bush said.
``But to protect the American people we will settle for nothing
less than the highest confidence in survivability, effectiveness
and safety of our remaining forces.''
   ``Programs like the Strategic Defense Initiative and one of its
most promising concepts, `Brilliant Pebbles', complement our
ability to preserve the peace into the 1990s and beyond,'' Bush
said.
   ``If the technology I've seen today proves feasible _ and I'm
told it looks very promising _ no war planner could be confident of
the consequences of a ballistic missile attack,'' said Bush, who
praised the nuclear weapons workers.
   ``I have a funny feeling that because of the nature of the work,
it is somewhat under-appreciated by the average man on the street
in our country,'' said Bush.
   ``In the 1990s strategic defense makes much more sense than ever
before,'' said Bush, who is asking Congress to boost the Star Wars
research budget by $1 billion to $4.8 billion for fiscal 1991.
Congress cut $1 billion from its budget this year.
   On Tuesday night, in a Los Angeles speech where he was heckled
by AIDS activists and critics of U.S. aid to El Salvador, Bush took
a sharp jab at Democrats who say his proposed $292 billion Pentagon
budget for fiscal 1991 is too fat in view of the diminished Soviet
threat.
   Bush appealed to the crowd to back his go-slow approach to
defense retrenchment.
   ``I'm in a big battle in Congress, and I'd like to have your
support to keep reasonable levels of defense. I'm not going to miss
an opportunity to cut, but I want to do it prudently and I want to
get something from the other side when we do it,'' he said.
   Star Wars is no longer billed as an impregnable shield capable
of blocking any enemy launch of a nuclear missile against the
United States. The favored concept now is the so-called ``brilliant
pebbles'' idea conceived by a team of Livermore scientists to
deploy thousands of tiny satellites or miniature rockets in
low-earth orbit, where they could ram and destroy enemy missiles.
   Bush planned to deliver a foreign policy address before the
Commonwealth Club in San Francisco before departing for Omaha,
Neb., where he will tour the underground headquarters of the
Strategic Air Command on Thursday.
   Several hundred demonstrators, many bearing signs attacking U.S.
military support for El Salvador, jeered, chanted and whistled
outside a Los Angeles hotel where Bush spoke at a $1,000-a-plate
fund-raiser Tuesday night for the California Republican party.
   Bush took note of the ``rapid and welcome change'' around the
world ``as people from Panama to Prague strive for democracy.''
   ``As the nature of the threats to American security change, so
too must our response,'' said Bush. ``Our forces will remain
robust, well-trained, highly professional but geared to the new
array of challenges of the '90s.''
   Earlier, Bush watched an armored Army brigade wage a mock battle
in the Mojave Desert against a training force at Fort Irwin that
emulates Soviet-style tactics.
   Addressing the troops by radio before watching the training
exercise, Bush said, ``The events of Eastern Europe and in the
Soviet Union have changed our strategic defense posture. It is
important not to let these encouraging changes, political or
military, lull us into a sense of complacency. Nor can we let down
our guard against a worldwide threat.''
   Back in Washington, the chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee, Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., kept up the pressure for defense
cuts Tuesday, saying Bush's desire to boost spending on big
strategic weapons programs fails ``to match the new political
realities at home or abroad.''
   This was Bush's third trip as president to California, a state
he won narrowly in 1988. He is hoping to bolster the gubernatorial
campaign of Sen. Pete Wilson, running to succeed fellow Republican
George Deukmejian.

<HEAD>President Urges Rebels To Accept Cease-Fire, Claims Battle Victory</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LUANDA, Angola (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Jose Eduardo dos Santos,
claiming a key battle victory over U.S.-backed rebels, has urged
rebel leader Jonas Savimbi to accept a cease-fire in the nation's
15-year-old civil war.
   Dos Santos, speaking at a meeting of Angolan farmers Tuesday
night, said Savimbi would receive ``humane treatment'' if he
accepted the cease-fire, part of a government amnesty offer to lead
to the rebels' integration into Angola's military, economic and
social structures.
   He said that as part of the deal, candidates independent of the
governing Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola would be
allowed to compete in elections held after the war.
   In previous statements, dos Santos said elections would not end
one-party rule by the Marxist governing party. He also had ruled
out Savimbi's National Union for the Total Independence of Angola,
or UNITA, from running in any elections.
   UNITA officials contacted in Lisbon, Portugal, Wednesday refused
to comment on dos Santos' speech. In the past, Savimbi has rejected
government amnesty and integration offers. He has insisted that a
cease-fire be followed by the formation of a transitional
government to prepare for free, multiparty elections.
   The president claimed victory in a battle for control of the
strategic Mavinga base in southeast Angola, 700 miles southeast of
Luanda.
   In a statement Wednesday, government military headquarters said
the base fell Friday and that 543 guerrillas died in the fighting.
It put government casualties at 55 dead.
   The rebels, however, continued Wednesday to claim they
controlled Mavinga. In a statement from Lisbon, UNITA said its
lines were holding out against intense bombing raids from the
government's Soviet-supplied planes and helicopters.
   A Western diplomat monitoring the fighting from Lisbon said
government troops had captured Mavinga's airstrip but that the
rebels remained in control of their base nearby and were mounting
counter-attacks against government forces.
   Army sources in Luanda said the fall of Mavinga would open the
way for government troops to attack the rebel headquarters at
Jamba, 160 miles futher south.
   The battle for Mavinga is the first major conventional military
confrontation since South Africa agreed to halt support for UNITA
and Cuba began a withdrawal of its troops backing government
forces. Those moves were made in accordance with a 1988 accord
signed in New York.
   Dos Santos claimed the government advance on Mavinga was a
response to UNITA violations of a cease-fire agreement sealed in
June when he met Savimbi in Zaire.
   Peace talks mediated by Zaire's President Mobuto Sese Seko
followed the Zaire agreement, but they broke down last summer as
the cease-fire crumbled amid renewed fighting. Attempts to bring
the two sides back to the negotiating table have failed.
   President Denis Sassou-Nguesso of Congo is due to discuss Angola
with President Bush in Washington later this week. The United
States is UNITA's main backer, supplying the rebels with an
estimated $50 million yearly in military equipment.
   UNITA has been fighting to share control in Angola since the
country gained independence from Portugal in 1975.

   Attorney General Steve Clark withdrew
as a candidate for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination on
Wednesday, one day after being notified that authorities were
looking into his expense accounts.
   ``After much reflection and discussion with my family and
friends, I have reached the conclusion that the mistakes in my
expense records and subsequent news coverage about those mistakes
have virtually destroyed my ability to run an efficient and
effective campaign for governor,'' the statement said.
   Clark also said he would complete his term as attorney general.
   Clark read his statement in less than a minute and then left the
room without answering questions.
   Prosecutor Chris Piazza on Tuesday notified Clark that state
police and auditors were looking into his expenses. Piazza
requested the inquiry in response to news reports that people
claimed by Clark as fellow diners on state expense forms actually
never ate with him.
   Clark apologized and repaid nearly $4,000 to the state, saying
his mistakes were due to sloppy bookkeeping. The attorney general
said the mistakes occurred when he tried to reconstruct how he used
a state-issued Visa card 60 to 90 days after the fact.

   Officers responding to a report of a
street disturbance found former heavyweight champion Muhammad Ali
at the middle of the crowd, police said Wednesday.
   ``When the officers arrived, they found it was just a group of
juveniles talking to a celebrity,'' Capt. Eugene Kyle said.
   Ali, who suffers from a brain disorder, had Floyd Bass,
groundskeeper of Ali's estate near Berrien Springs, Mich., as his
spokesman.
   Bass explained Ali was asked several weeks ago to visit the West
Side home of a teen-age girl who has cancer.
   After visting the girl's home Tuesday evening, Ali decided to
mingle with youngsters in the neighborhood, said Bass.
   ``He likes to surprise people,'' Bass said. He said Ali also
performed magic tricks for the youths before police arrived.
   Ali and officers who responded to the disturbance report then
agreed to play a practical joke on those at the Central Police
Station.
   Cpl. John Collins brought Ali into the station in handcuffs,
claiming he had arrested the ex-fighter.
   After everyone had a good laugh, it was handshakes, autographs
and photographs for the police officers.
   Collins and several other officers then escorted Ali as he
visited several downtown restaurants and night spots. Following the
brief visit to South Bend, Ali returned to his home in Berrien
Springs, said Bass.

   Interstate truck drivers generally
approve of drug testing for themselves and their peers, a survey
shows.
   Richard Beilock, a transportation expert for the University of
Florida's Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences, said
Wednesday his survey of 1,300 drivers in 1989 indicates most
interstate truckers welcome the federal government's new policy of
mandatory drug testing, part of which went into effect Dec. 21.
   Department of Transportation regulations reguire, among other
things, pre-employment drug testing and post-accident testing of
certain companies engaged in interstate commerce.
   The survey showed 66 percent of drivers approve random
drug-testing, while 90 percent support mandatory post-accident
testing.
   It also showed that 84 percent approve of drug tests as an
employment condition, and 76 percent believe a trucker should be
tested if he gives his employers reason to believe he is a drug
abuser.
   ``What this reflects is that the vast bulk of those drivers are
good men and women who are concerned about their own safety, the
public's safety, and their image,'' said Beilock. ``They feel very
bad that they're no longer viewed as knights of the road.''
   The survey was conducted on every trucker who came through
certain state agricultural inspection stations on a specific day.

<HEAD>AFL-CIO President Urges National Health Care Reform</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland spoke
Wednesday of ``a growing wave of fear'' among Americans over
escalating health costs and urged Congress to enact some form of
national health care reform.
   Kirkland joined Washington Gov. Booth Gardner before the Senate
Budget Committee, where there was agreement about the problems of
health care costs but few specifics on what to do.
   ``We have a paradox of excess and deprivation,'' said Sen. Jim
Sasser, D-Tenn., chairman of the committee. ``We spend more on
health than any other nation. ... Yet many millions of Americans
have no access to health care of any kind.''
   Sasser said 32 million Americans have no health insurance and
that there are 21 countries that have a lower infant mortality rate
than the United States.
   Kirkland said rising health care costs have become a major
obstacle in resolving labor contract disputes.
   ``There is in this country a growing wave of fear, well grounded
fear,'' about health care, Kirkland said. ``Fear of ruin _ fear of
physical ruin and fear of economic ruin.''
   Kirkland said the AFL-CIO did not support nationalized health
care or other specific plans for assuring universal access to care.
   ``We are deliberately keeping all options open,'' Kirkland said,
adding that he opposes employers' use of pension fund surpluses to
finance health care benefits except for retirees who are
beneficiaries of those funds.
   Gardner, who will make health care the top priority of the
National Governors' Association when he becomes its chairman this
summer, urged Congress consult the states.
   He said health care costs consume 14 percent of Washington State
revenues, and at current rates of growth will take up 23 percent in
10 years without improving access. Gardner called for reform that
would provide ``universal access to necessary health services,''
combined with controls on costs.
   ``Ultimately we need to make all residents of this country
automatically eligible for health coverage,'' Gardner said.
   Meanwhile, Louis Sullivan, secretary of the Department of Health
and Human Services, told the Senate Labor-HHS appropriations
subcommittee that there should be more emphasis on primary care and
disease prevention.
   ``There's no challenging that at its best the American health
care system has no equal,'' Sullivan said.
   ``But while we have emphasized our high technology with
spectacular results, we have developed a system that is very
expensive and we have also neglected a fundamental bedrock of our
system, and that is providing basic health services to all of our
citizens.''
   Health care spending in the United States this year is expected
to exceed $600 billion, or more than 12 percent of the nation's
gross national product.
   Canada spends about a third less per capita on health care than
the United States while covering all citizens, said subcommittee
chairman Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa.

<BYLINE>If There's a Greater Nebraska, Is There a Lesser?

<DATELINE>LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nebraska might be a great state, but some
of its lawmakers don't think ``Greater Nebraska' is such a great
name.
   They want people to stop using the terms ``outstate Nebraska,
greater Nebraska and lesser Nebraska'' to describe areas of the
Cornhusker state.
   And to make the point they adopted a resolution making such
utterances punishable by a $50 fine _ even though such a resolution
can't be enforced.
   ``I did it mostly for the education,'' said co-sponsor Sen.
Sandy Scofield, who lives in greater Nebraska ... er, oops ... the
Nebraska Panhandle.
   About one third of the state's 1.57 million residents live in
the state two largest cities, Omaha and Lincoln, the state capital.
The two cities are about 60 miles apart on the eastern edge of the
state.
   The terms outstate Nebraska and greater Nebraska are often used
for the vast area outside Omaha-Lincoln. The 1989 Nebraska State
Government Directory is riddled with ``outstate'' listings. And
even Gov. Kay Orr admits to having used the term ``greater
Nebraska.''
   The resolution adopted on a 14-4 vote on Monday calls on
lawmakers, constitutional officers, state employees and
representatives of the state to lead the way in eliminating ``the
imprecise, divisive terms.''
   The use of the term ``greater Nebraska ... implies some part of
the state is lesser Nebraska,'' the resolution says.
   ``It's a serious matter if you live outside of Lincoln or Omaha.
It gets more serious the farther west you go,'' said Scofield, who
lives in Chadron, farther from Lincoln than any of her 48
colleagues in the Legislature.
   Another senator from far western Nebraska, Sen. Dennis Baack of
Kimball, said he views the whole discussion as ``a great geography
lesson.''
   Baack, who thinks the state should be referred to by geographic
areas, said the resolution is ``an effort to make sure people
understand the geography of their own state better. We're all
Nebraskans, I happen to live in and represent the Panhandle.
   ``But you don't have to call us Panhandlers.''

<TEXT>
   Islamic leaders Wednesday castigated
the United States and Soviet Union for the influx of Soviet Jews
into the Israeli-occupied territories as they gathered to mark the
20th anniversary of the Organization of the Islamic Conference.
   Kuwait's emir, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, said Washington
and Moscow were guilty of the ``most dangerous decision against the
Arab world at the turn of the century.''
   ``The Jewish influx emanates from the Soviet Union and flows
under the banner of human rights to settle in the land of their
choice by dint of the new immigration laws in the United States and
Europe,'' the emir said in a speech read by his minister of Islamic
affairs, Khaled Ahmed al-Jassar.
   Al-Sabah is chairman of the Organization of the Islamic
Conference, the umnbrella grouping for the world's estimated 1
billion Moslems.
   Israel has said it expects about 300,000 Soviet Jews to settle
in the Jewish state in the next five years. Restrictions on
immigration of Soviet Jews into the United States have led in part
to the flood into Israel.
   The United States and Soviet Union oppose settling Soviet Jews
in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, saying it is an
obstacle to making peace with Palestinians who are fighting for an
independent nation.
   On Jan. 15, Israel's prime minister, Yitzhak Shamir, caused
widespread protests when he said Israel must hold onto the occupied
lands to deal with the wave of expected immigrants.
   ``The makers of the law talk about the right of Jews to emigrate
and settle where they wish and do not talk about the right of the
Arab person to the soil of his homeland and that of his
forefathers,'' said Al-Sabah.
   The anniversary ceremony attracted a number of officials,
including the foreign ministers of Egypt, Senegal and Gabon.
   The Islamic organization was founded after an Aug. 21, 1969
arson attack at Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa Mosque, one of Islam's holiest
shrines.
   The arson was attributed in Israel to a demented man and
occurred two years after Israel had seized the West Bank and Gaza
Strip from Egypt and Jordan. About 70,000 Jewish settlers live
alongside 1.7 million Palestinians in the territories.
   Saudi King Fahd, in a speech read on his behalf by Defense
Minister Prince Sultan, said the Islamic organization
``crystallized the call for Islamic solidarity and defense of
Moslem rights and interests.''
   The group's headquarters are in the Saudi port of Jiddah, and
Saudi Arabia is the dominant force in the organization.

<TEXT>
   The Vatican secretary of state arrived
Wednesday for a visit officials said will include the
re-establishment of diplomatic ties that were severed by the
Communists 45 years ago.
   Cardinal Agostino Casaroli and Hungarian officials will sign
documents during the five-day visit formally restoring diplomatic
relations broken after the government expelled the Vatican's envoy
in 1945, the Vatican said Tuesday.
   Hungary, in the Soviet bloc mainstream of reforms to establish
Western-style democracy, will be the second Warsaw Pact country to
restore relations with the Vatican. Ties with Poland resumed in
July.
   ``Although the church does not play a direct role in politics,
... by virtue of educating the soul, reinforcing democratic and
social values and shaping moral consciousness, it can play an
important part in the social changes taking place,'' Casaroli told
the Hungarian news agency MTI before leaving Rome on Wednesday.
   Negotiations between the Vatican and Hungary, which has a
Catholic majority, had been going on for months, and both sides had
earlier agreed Pope John Paul II would visit Hungary next year.
   Casaroli planned to celebrate Mass on Thursday at the basilica
in Esztergom, the seat of the Hungarian primate. The square in
front of the basilica will then be renamed after Cardinal Jozsef
Mindszenty.
   A plaque dedicated to Mindszenty is to be unveiled, with interim
President Matyas Szueroes in attendance.
   Thursday marks the 41st anniversary of the sentencing of
Mindszenty on trumped-up charges designed to break the resistance
of the Catholic Church to Communist rule.
   Mindszenty, who became a symbol of church opposition to
communism, was freed from prison by Hungarian revolutionaries
during the 1956 uprising.
   After the revolt was crushed by Soviet tanks, Mindszenty took
refuge in the U.S. diplomatic mission in Budapest, where he stayed
until Hungary agreed to let him leave in 1971. Mindszenty died four
years later in Vienna at the age of 83.
   Hungary's reform-minded leadership has agreed to review the
Mindszenty trial, and he is expected to be cleared of all charges.
   Parliament, which has shed the rubber-stamp role it had held for
decades under the former Communist leadership, enacted a law Jan.
24 that separates the church from the state and grants all
denominations full autonomy.
   Separate legislation is planned on the return of confiscated
church assets.
   Under pressure from the Communist government, the Hungarian
Roman Catholic church agreed on Aug. 30, 1950, to surrender its
autonomy. As in other Soviet bloc countries, a law was subsequently
established that institutionalized state interference.
   The law was annulled Tuesday during a meeting between Premier
Miklos Nemeth and Cardinal Laszlo Paskai, the Hungarian primate,
removing the final hurdle to the restoration of diplomatic ties.

   A brief look at the Communist Party Central
Committee:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>COMPOSITION:
   The Central Committee is made up of leading members of the
20-million member Soviet Communist Party.
   In most recent years, the Central Committee has been made up of
about 300 members, but last year the number was reduced to 251. Two
members have since died.
   Membership includes leading figures of the Soviet Communist
Party from regional party organizations, the national government
and party organizations, and other prominent figures from the
military, arts and sciences.</HEAD>
<HEAD>POWERS:
   The Central Committee is the policy-making body of the party. It
is charged with guiding the party's work between the larger party
congresses that are held every five years. Most major policy issues
are brought before the Central Committee for a policy directive.
   Between congresses, the Central Committee alone has the power to
change the composition of the Politburo, which is responsible for
running the country on a day-to-day basis. It also may change the
party leader.</HEAD>
<HEAD>SELECTION:
   The Central Committee is chosen every five years by the
Communist Party congress. Between congresses, members can be
retired and non-voting members can be promoted to voting
membership. The last congress was held four years ago. The next one
is scheduled for fall.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Article 6 of the Soviet Constitution, which makes
the Communist Party the ``leading and guiding force of Soviet
society,'' is the key to the party's exclusive hold on political
power.
   It is part of the constitution adopted Oct. 7, 1977, by a
special session of the Supreme Soviet under the leadership of the
late Leonid I. Brezhnev. It has been interpreted as ruling out the
creation of competing political parties.
   Article 6 says:
   ``The leading and guiding force of Soviet society and the
nucleus of its political system, of all state organizations and
public organizations, is the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.
The C.P.S.U. exists for the people and serves the people.
   ``The Communist Party, armed with Marxism-Leninism, determines
the general perspectives of the development of society and the
course of the home and foreign policy of the U.S.S.R., directs the
great constructive work of the Soviet people, and imparts a
planned, systematic and theoretically substantiated character to
their struggle for the victory of communism.
   ``All party organizations shall function within the framework of
the Constitution of the U.S.S.R.''

<TEXT>
   In the space of eight months, the hallowed and powerful role of
old-line Communist parties in East Europe has eroded steadily. Here
is a chronology of how their power has waned:
   June 10, 1989 - Under pressure from reformers, the Hungarian
Communist Party and opposition groups agree to negotiate a
multiparty system. On Oct. 7, the Communist Party formally
disbands, reconstitutes itself as the Hungarian Socialist Party and
says it aspires to democratic ideals.
   Nov. 29 - The Czechoslovak Parliament deletes the leading role
of the Communist Party from the constitution.
   Dec. 1 - The East German Parliament removes a constitutional
provision guaranteeing the party's leading role.
   Dec. 29 - The Polish Parliament eliminates a clause in the
constitution that gave a leading role to the Communist Party.
   Jan. 12, 1990 - Interim Romanian President Ion Iliescu declares
that the the Communist Party is outlawed. The order is rescinded
later, but most leading party officials are arrested and the
party's power is broken.
   Jan. 15 - The Bulgarian Parliament votes to abolish the
guaranteed leading role of the Communist Party.
   Wednesday - The Soviet Communist Party Central Committee decides
to recommend an end to the constitutional provision that guarantees
the party supremacy in political life.

   Army Col. Petre Moraru, who was
awaiting trial on charges of complicity in genocide, committed
suicide in his Timisoara prison cell, state television reported
Wednesday.
   Moraru was scheduled to testify in court next week regarding his
alleged role in the desecration of corpses following the violence
in Timisoara, the western Romanian city where the revolution began
last December that eventually toppled dictator Nicolae Ceausescu.
   The newspaper Romania Libera reported corpses were removed from
a hospital in Timisoara on Dec. 18 and cremated, in an alleged
effort to eliminate evidence of atrocities committed against
residents.
   Other members of the Ceausescu regime have testified during
trials that the Communist dictator ordered the army to shoot
demonstrators in Timisoara.
   Ceausescu was executed with his wife, Elena, on Dec. 25, by the
provisional forces that took over Romania and ended his 24-year
rule of the country.

   Clusters of people stood outside the Kremlin in
the cold Wednesday, some from far corners of this vast and diverse
land, wondering what was being decided inside and hoping it would
improve their lot.
   ``We hope there will be changes, but the leaders all seem lost
and now they don't know how to find their way,'' said Georgy
Bogdanov, a lathe operator from Magadan province, 7,500 miles away
in the Soviet Far East.
   The groups of citizens, and the score foreign journalists
waiting with them, shouted questions at all who entered Red Square
through the Spassky Gate next to St. Basil's Cathedral.
   ``Are you from the plenum?'' the crowd would yell. Most were
Kremlin office workers who probably knew no more than their
questioners about how and what President Mikhail S. Gorabachev and
the Central Committee were doing.
   ``I especially came here to see what was going on,'' said Igor
Posnyok, a medical student from Vitebsk in Byelorussia, 250 miles
west of Moscow. ``I heard about the big democracy demonstrations
and wanted to find out for myself what is happening because I
couldn't believe it,''
   On Sunday, about 100,000 people marched 60 abreast to the
Kremlin to demand that the Communist Party give up its power
monopoly and accept other radical reforms.
   Early in the afternoon, participants in the meeting came out
with the news that the Central Committee had approved Gorbachev's
proposal to end the guarantee of Communist power and introduce a
multiparty system.
   ``We must have competition of parties so a person can decide
which one to vote for,'' said Dima Sukhanov, 17, of Moscow.
   Bogdanov, from the Far East, wondered what it all was worth.
``Things are getting worse,'' he said. ``Five years of perestroika
and what of it?''
   Oleg Trifolov, 41, from the Crimean Peninsula on the Black Sea,
spoke in the same vein: ``We the simple people don't see
perestroika, only chaos and disintegration.''

   Israeli soldiers killed an 18-year-old
Palestinian on Wednesday and hundreds of residents of his Gaza
Strip hometown marched in protest.
   Arab reports said at least 13 Palestinians, including a
9-year-old boy, were wounded in other confrontations with soldiers
in the occupied Gaza Strip.
   Ayman Khalil Zakout of Rafah was shot in the stomach and
pronounced dead at the local U.N. clinic, doctors said. The army
confirmed the death and said it was investigating the circumstances.
   Arab reports said hundreds of young Palestinians marched through
Rafah, waving the outlawed green, white, red and black Palestinian
flag and chanting nationalist slogans.
   They shouted ``Death is an honor for us!'' and ``We are ready to
die to liberate Palestine!''
   Zakout's death raised to 653 the number of Palestinians killed
by Israelis in the 26-month-old uprising against Israeli rule in
the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. At least 181 have been
killed by other Palestinians, most on suspicion of collaboration,
and 43 Israelis have died.
   Other members of Zakout's family have been involved in the
uprising. His 16-year-old brother, Balatt, was killed in a clash
with soldiers eight months ago and his mother, Fatimah, was
sentenced to 18 months in prison in August 1988 for belonging to an
illegal Palestinian organization.

<HEAD>High School Seniors Not Versed in Geography, Study Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TAMARA HENRY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   High school seniors have a ``disturbing gap''
in their knowledge of geography, with only 37 percent able to find
Southeast Asia on a world map, a study said Wednesday.
   Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos released the first study of
geography education by the National Assessment of Educational
Progress, which said that the average student could answer just 57
percent of the questions and that the best score among more than
3,000 students tested was 59 percent.
   ``The results show a disturbing gap in our knowledge of
geography: many of our young people do not know as much about our
world as they should know,'' said Cavazos.
   Geography education, as defined by the assessment, includes
knowledge of the physical characteristics of the planet, such as
its topography and climate, as well as the ways that people and
their environment interact.
   More than 3,000 high school seniors from 300 public and private
schools nationwide were asked 76 multiple-choice questions dealing
with such topics as locations, environmental issues, climate and
erosion.
   Among the survey results:
   _On a world map, 87 percent identified Canada; 85 percent
recognized the Soviet Union; 84 percent identified countries in the
Middle East; 72 percent identified petroleum-exporting countries,
and 71 percent located Latin America.
   _Only 37 percent could find Southeast Asia and 37 percent
incorrectly said that India is part of the region. Thirteen percent
said that either Saudi Arabia or Brazil was in Southeast Asia.
   _Only 27 percent could use a map to identify a likely area of
soil erosion. But three-fourths of the students were aware that the
United States is a major exporter of grain.
   _Seventy-nine percent answered questions on the control of acid
rain, 69 percent on pollution from pesticides. Less than two-thirds
were familiar with the concepts of latitude and longitude.
   _Fifty percent knew that the Panama Canal cut the sailing time
between New York and San Francisco because ships no longer had to
sail around the tip of South America.
   ``Some of the results are encouraging, but most are disturbing
and confirm what we already know: An unacceptably high percentage
of American high school graduates have not learned geography,''
said Gilbert Grosvenor, president of the National Geographic
Society, which helped finance the study.
   The results, said Gregory Anrig, president of the Educational
Testing Service, which conducted the survey, show that the nation's
youth cannot fully appreciate ``today's historic events in Eastern
Europe or respond to challenges of the global `greenhouse effect.'''
   Geography is not a priority in most schools, the report said,
pointing to a recent survey of the Council of Chief State School
Officers that found only 18 percent of the states require geography
for high school graduation.
   When it is taught, geography is often integrated into other
courses, such as history, social studies and science, the report
said.
   Keith Geiger, president of the National Education Association,
said geography instruction at the elementary level should become an
integral part of the social science curriculum. At the high-school
level, he said, ``We should teach about the need to balance
environmental concerns with those of business and industry.''
   The National Assessment of Educational Progress, popularly known
as the Nation's Report Card, is a congressionally mandated project
of the National Center for Education Statistics in the Education
Department. It is the only nationally representative and continuing
assessment of what American students know and can do in various
subject areas.

<HEAD>Senate Gives Final Passage To `Excellence in Education Act'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate overwhelmingly approved on
Wednesday legislation providing nearly $1.5 billion to upgrade
education and help the United States cope in an increasingly
competitive world economy.
   By a 92-8 vote, senators passed and sent to the House the
Excellence in Education Act, initially submitted to Congress by
President Bush last spring.
   Final passage came after Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., was thwarted
in attempts to strike from the bill a provision awarding $25
million in federal funds over three years to the recently
established National Board for Professional Teaching Standards.
   Helms and some others argued that the private board _ with
federal money _ would have too great a voice in setting
teacher-qualification standards that ought to be determined at the
state and local level.
   The bill was passed after lawmakers agreed to an amendment by
Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., which said no decisions by the board
could be imposed on private educational institutions or parents who
teach their children at home.
   The board was created in 1987 at the urging of the National
Governors' Association. It is an independent organization governed
by a 64-member board of directors, including representatives of
teachers' unions. Activities so far have been low-key.
   The proposal to authorize $25 million for the board was part of
a wide-ranging education bill estimated to cost close to $1.5
billion over five years. It seeks to combat drugs in public
schools, establish a presidential merit schools program and
increase aid to schools seeking to reduce dropout rates.
   Besides Helms, senators voting against the bill, all
Republicans, were William Armstrong of Colorado, Jake Garn of Utah,
Phil Gramm of Texas; Gordon Humphrey of New Hampshire; James
McClure and Steve Symms of Idaho and Malcolm Wallop of Wyoming.

<TEXT>
   A terrorist attack on a tour bus that killed
nine Israelis and wounded 20 was plotted abroad and carried out by
foreigners, the interior minister said Wednesday.
   Maj. Gen. Abdel-Halim Moussa, who is responsible for internal
security, said his investigators had found clues ``that I hope will
lead us to the full dimensions of the incident'' and those
responsible.
   One of Egypt's most lucrative tourist markets is drying up
because of the attack Sunday. Except for journalists, Israelis are
staying away from Egypt, the only Arab country that has a peace
treaty with the Jewish state.
   Two men armed with automatic weapons and hand grenades attacked
the bus, which carried 31 Israeli tourists, 40 miles northeast of
Cairo. The bus, one of several carrying travelers from various
countries that was touring the region Sunday, was the only one
filled with Israelis.
   Many Israelis have canceled visits to Egypt, and President Hosni
Mubarak's government seems aware of the problem.
   Foreign Minister Esmat Abdel-Meguid said Tuesday in Saudi Arabia
he hoped the attack would not deter Israelis from coming to Egypt.
   In the Wednesday statement distributed by the official Middle
East News Agency, Moussa said: ``It's certain ... that the
perpetrators of this crime are non-Egyptians, and that the plotting
was done abroad.''
   He did not elaborate, but newspaper reports mention a
Palestinian connection. The bus driver, who police sources said had
worked for the bus company less than a month, and the man who
rented the car used by the attackers were said to be Palestinians.
   Sources said most of about 100 suspects detained for questioning
were Palestinians. The sources, who demanded anonymity, said those
questioned included a Palestinian suspected of driving the car the
attackers were in.
   In Cairo, security was increased at the main synogue and
seaports. Airports remained on alert.
   About 100,000 Israelis visited Egypt last year, but since
Sunday, ``Israeli tourists have canceled planned trips up to the
end of the month,'' said Anwar Hilal, an owner of Safaga Tours,
which organized Sunday's bus trip.
   A day after the assault, the only Israelis entering Egypt on the
route the bus had taken were reporters and television crews, said
Hilal's partner, Gamal Galal.
   The number of tourists arriving from the Israeli port of Eilat
through Taba in southern Sinai also has dwindled, they said. The
bus came via Rafah in northern Sinai.
   ``Most tourists coming from Eilat are non-Israeli, but even that
has been affected,'' Hilal said. ``It's the general atmosphere.''
   An Israeli tourist who identified himself only as Ilan, waiting
to board a sightseeing bus in central Cairo, said he and a friend
were the only Israelis to travel overland from Eilat to Egypt the
day after the attack.
   ``Everyone told us not to go, but we mustn't connect this
incident with the attitude of the Egyptian people,'' said Ilan, a
resident of Eilat. ``We're staying on for another week.''
   Only five other passengers, all from Europe, were on the bus
Monday from Eilat.
   ``The buses from Eilat are usually at least half-full, mostly
European _ British, Germans, Swedes,'' said Ruth Eisenstein, tour
leader of the group.
   Ms. Eisenstein, a guide with Israel's Galilee Tours, which works
with Safaga, said most people canceled after news of the attack
spread.
   ``People in Eilat especially feel like each one of them has been
attacked when something like this happens,'' she said.
   Eilat residents remember October 1985, when an Egyptian
policeman in Ras Burka, Sinai, went berserk and fired into a group
of Israeli tourists. Four children and three adults were killed.
   ``I tell them they must come and try Egypt, but they won't,''
Ms. Eisenstein said.

<HEAD>Austria Agrees to Pay $25 Million to Holocaust Victims</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE JAHN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Austria, which for years insisted it was
itself a victim of Nazi Germany, has agreed to pay about $25
million in reparations to Jewish survivors of the Holocaust,
officials said Wednesday.
   Under a plan worked out by the government and the New York-based
Jewish Claims Conference on Austria, the $25 million will be
invested in projects aimed at helping Jewish survivors of death
camps or those forced to flee the Nazi terror in Austria, the
officials said.
   Some government officials said Austria's new willingness to pay
reparations implicitly weakened its traditional argument that it
was itself a victim of Nazi aggression.
   Some Austrian Jews indicated the change of heart was a result of
the uproar over the 1986 election to the presidency of Kurt
Waldheim, when the nation was forced to confront its past.
   Waldheim, secretary-general of the United Nations from 1972 to
1982, has denied that he was involved in war crimes when he served
as a junior officer in the German army in Yugoslavia in World War
II.
   Much of the $25 million will be invested in homes for the
elderly in the United States, Israel and elsewhere catering to
large numbers of expatriate Austrian Jews, although some of the
amount will likely be spent in Austria, said Finance Ministry
spokesman Dietmar Ecker.
   He said the money is to be distributed over the next five years
_ about $4 million this year, $5 million in the three subsequent
years, and $6 million in 1994.
   Austria already pays small pensions to individuals both at home
and abroad deemed to be victims of the Nazis, and it agreed in 1988
to provide them an additional one-time payment of several hundred
dollars. But this is the first time a large sum will be paid
exclusively to Austrian Jews.
   Ecker would not directly comment on whether the move meant
Austria was distancing itself from its historic contention that the
country was the first victim of Nazi Germany, saying only ``this
act should be seen as a signal.''
   But other officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, agreed
that the move weakens the traditional argument.
   Prominent Austrian Jews pointed out that although the Allies
themselves considered Austria the first target of Nazi Germany,
which absorbed its southern neighbor in 1938, the high level of
Austrian support for the annexation was ignored for decades.
   Also ignored was the fact that membership in the Austrian Nazi
party at the end of the war was higher on a percentual basis than
in Germany.
   Many notorious Nazi figures, such as Adolf Eichmann, were
Austrian, as was Adolf Hitler himself.
   ``Earlier governments took the point of view that Austria itself
was a victim and they had no reason to offer reparations,'' Nazi
hunter Simon Wiesenthal said in a telephone interview.
   ``The Waldheim thing left its mark, it forced the Austrians to
deal with their own pasts,'' said Wiesenthal, a prominent Austrian
Jew who lost family members during the Holocaust.
   Weisenthal praised Chancellor Franz Vranitzky, who took office
in 1986, for repeatedly attempting to dispell the myth ``that
Austrians were only victims and not aggressors as well.''
   Paul Grosz, leader of Vienna's Jewish community, said Austria's
willingess to compensate Holocaust victims is not merely a belated
attempt to deal with bad publicity over the Waldheim affair.
   ``This is not reparation for Waldheim, it's reparation for Nazi
crimes,'' he said.
   East Germany, which until now has refused to consider
reparations, is now also reconsidering. The new leadership held
talks with Israeli officials earlier this month on the possibility
of such payments as a way of establishing diplomatic relations.
   The Austrian sum pales in comparison to the more than $40
billion dispensed by West Germany to Jews and Israel under a 1952
agreement.
   But Grosz said the Austrian payment, while it could not begin to
compensate for the genocide wrought on Austrian Jews, seemed
equitable, considering that those who are alive to benefit now
number only about 40,000.
   Some 68,000 Austrian Jews died in Nazi concentration camps
during World War II, and more that 120,000 others were incarcerated
in camps or fled the country. In all, the Nazis exterminated about
6 million Jews.

   Two U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency planes
flying reconaissance, reportedly to provide security for an

devil,'' said Santofimio in Tuesday speech that was published
Wednesday in the newspaper La Prensa.
   He was referring to the U.S. capital's mayor, Marion Barry,
arrested last month on a cocaine possession charge.
   The Colombian Civil Air Authority authorized flights this month
of two Aerocommander aircraft belonging to the DEA. U.S. planes
have been allowed to fly over the country for years to obtain
information about cocaine labs and other drug operations.
   Colombia's attorney general, Alfonso Gomez, said earlier this
week that he ordered an investigation to determine if civil
aviation officials exceeded their authority by granting the planes
permission to fly over the country.
   But the announcement has done little to soften the rhetoric of
Santofimio and other politicians, angered by persistent press
commentaries that the U.S. planes were violating the country's
sovereignty.
   Santofimio is one of several Colombian congressmen whose U.S.
visas were canceled last year. U.S. authorities gave no reason for
their decision, but unconfirmed reports held that the Colombian
officials had been linked to drug traffickers.
   U.S. Ambassador Thomas McNamara said any U.S. aircraft flying
over Colombia are doing so with permission of the country's
government.
   ``The people who are violating airspace are the drug traffickers
flying cocaine into the United States,'' McNamara told reporters at
a Tuesday briefing for the Colombian press. A transcript was
obtained Wednesday.
   Colombian traffickers are responsible for processing and
smuggling 80 percent of the cocaine sold on U.S. streets, according
to U.S. officials.
   The Colombian news media have reported that the DEA planes are
using sophisticated observation equipment to detect missiles or
other weapons that might be used by drug traffickers to try to kill
Bush during his visit. U.S. officials in Bogota have refused to
comment on DEA operations.
   Last month reports surfaced in Washington that the Medellin
cocaine cartel had obtained surface-to-air missiles to try to shoot
down Bush's plane when it arrives on Feb. 15 for the antidrug
summit. The Medellin cartel in phone calls to local media denied
having any missiles.
   The controversy over the aircraft comes less than a month after
the Bush administration recalled a U.S. fleet planning drug
interdiction operations off Colombia's Caribbean coast.
   Bush apparently did not consult with Colombian President
Virgilio Barco until reports of the fleet's movement toward the
Caribbean surfaced in the news media.
   Bush is to meet with Barco and the presidents of Peru and
Bolivia at the antidrug summit in the port of Cartagena, intended
to ratify a plan for greater cooperation.
   Peru and Bolivia are the biggest producers of the coca leaf used
by Colombian traffickers to process the drug. The United States is
the world's largest consumer of cocaine.

<HEAD>Longtime Communist Ally Says It Will Join Opposition</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Agrarian Party, for decades a
powerless partner of the Communists, announced Wednesday that it
will join the opposition.
   The move was another blow to Communist attempts to woo
non-Communist parties into a government coalition pending free
elections in May. The opposition has generally rejected such an
arrangement, saying it would have little influence.
   Agrarian Party leader Angel Dimitrov suggested a union between
his group and the Agrarian Party Nikola Patkov, an organization
that has opposed the Communists since its creation several months
ago.
   In a related development, the head of a group of Communist Party
reformers predicted that the party will split along ideological
lines Feb. 11, when liberal Communists will vote on whether to form
their own party.
   Nikolai Vassilev, a leader of the Alternative Social Alliance,
said he expects two-thirds of the delegates will vote at a special
congress to leave the Communist Party and create a social
democratic party.
   It is not known how many of the country's 980,000 Communist
Party members support the alliance.
   Bulgaria's first free elections since World War II are planned
for May and the Communist Party has been meeting with opposition
groups to carry out some reforms in preparation for the balloting.
   At talks held Wednesday, the Union of Democratic Forces _ an
umbrella group representing opposition groups _ proposed that
parliament be presented with a constitutional amendment that would
bar Communist Party organizations at work places.
   The state news agency BTA said the opposition charged that the
Communist Party's ``wish to preserve its structures until elections
gives it advantages, despite renunciation of constitutional
guarantees about its leading role.''
   The opposition plan also would ban any other political party
from forming organizations at work places, BTA reported.
   The Communists said the issue of the party's role in the economy
would be regulated in a law on political parties now being drafted
and likely to be submitted to parliament in March, BTA reported. It
gave no further details.
   Compared with their East bloc neighbors, Bulgarian Communists
have given up relatively little power.
   Talks between the party and the opposition are to resume Feb.
12, BTA said.

   A legislator said she hopes the state
Senate quickly kills three bills she introduced Wednesday calling
for sterilization of child-support scofflaws and requiring
counseling and spousal consent for vasectomies.
   Sen. Charlotte Pritt, a pro-choice advocate, said she thinks her
bills are as worthless as those requiring that women undergo
counseling and receive consent from their mates before having
abortions.
   Pritt said she introduced the bills at the request of a
constituent who was interested in encouraging lawmakers to think
about repercussions of abortion-curbing legislation.
   ``I hope that none of this legislation is passed,'' she said.
``It is all repressive. If someone feels strongly about something,
it's a legislator's courtesy to offer legislation to be introduced.
The person may not agree with it, but will introduce it for the
sake of dialogue.''
   The bill was referred to the Senate Health and Human Resources
Committee, where Committee Chairman Bob Holliday said he intends to
let it die without having a vote on it.
   ``These are companion pieces to anti-choice legislation that
affects women,'' Pritt said. ``I was asked to put in legislation
that would be comparable but make men responsible for their
actions.''
   Pritt's legislation calls for a court to issue a contempt
citation before ordering a person to be involuntarily sterilized
for falling a year behind in support payments.
   Pritt also introduced a bill that calls for a physician to
counsel the spouse regarding the performance of a vasectomy in
cases in which he is counseling the wife about the performance of a
tubal ligation.
   Her third bill would require a spouse's written consent before a
man could obtain a vasectomy.
   ``Notice is not required if the performance of the vasectomy is
necessary to save the man's life,'' the bill said.
   Several of the anti-abortion measures targeted by Pritt's
package have been introduced by state Sen. Mark Manchin.
   ``My reaction is that I hope we wouldn't get caught up
introducing frivolous companion legislation in order to make the
other side look somehow unimportant,'' Manchin said. ``If these are
sincere bills, with sincere intentions, fine. But if they are
introduced solely to make other bills dealing with the same subject
matter look frivolous or unimportant, I think the approach she's
taking is wrong.''

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A French aid agency reported Wednesday that two
European doctors kidnapped over the weekend in southern Sudan are
being held by the rebel Sudanese Peoples Liberation Army.
   Martin Ruppert, a 28-year-old from the Netherlands, and
Christine Van Haegenoth, a 26-year-old Belgian, are in ``good
health,'' said a statement from the Paris-based Medecins Sans
Frontieres.
   It was the first identification of the assailants who took the
two physicians Friday night from their home in Malakal, a garrison
city on the Nile 370 miles south of the capital Khartoum.
   Medecins Sans Frontieres, or Doctors Without Borders, said talks
are under way with the rebels to free the two doctors, who work for
the non-governmental organization's Belgian branch.
   A spokeswoman for the group in Brussels, Inneke Van Velzen, said
Monday that the doctors may have been kidnapped by the rebels to
treat their casualties from the civil war.
   The rebels led by John Garang, a renegade colonel, have been
fighting the Moslem-dominated government since 1983 for increased
economic and political autonomy for the predominantly Christian and
animist southern half of the country.
   Ruppert and Haegenoth were working on a long-term medical
nutritional program to help the people of Malakal and the
surrounding desert.
   The French section of Medecins Sans Frontieres recently withdrew
its workers from Sudan after unidentified attackers shot down a
plane carrying two of its doctors, a French pilot and a Sudanese
working for the United Nations.
   The Belgian section has pulled out three workers since the
abduction, Van Velzen said.

<TEXT>
   The World Bank will vote Thursday on a $30
million earthquake relief loan to China, its first loan since the
Communist government suppressed a democracy movement in June.
   Bank President Barber B. Conable will present the loan to a
closed-door meeting of representatives of the 151 governments that
own the bank, said spokesman Peter Riddleberger.
   A series of earthquakes hit northern China in October, killing
at least 29 people and destroying 5,000 to 8,000 houses.
   The World Bank is the biggest source of aid to Third World
countries, lending more than $21 billion a year. Riddleberger said
no other loan to China would come up at this session.
   Soon after government tanks rolled into Beijing's Tiananmen
Square, Conable decided to hold back $780 million in loans to China
that had been due for approval. Later, President Bush said he was
asking the bank not to make the loans.
   Conable has said the bank considers only economic conditions
when it grants loans. In June, he withdrew the bank's permanent
representatives in Beijing but they returned within a few weeks.
   He said then that he hoped to resume lending to China soon.
   The United States is the biggest shareholder in the bank, but
does not have a veto power over loans. China and India have been
the biggest borrowers.
   The loan that goes before the board Thursday would be repayable
in 40 years with only nominal interest. The United States is
expected to be represented by its board member, E. Patrick Coady.
   A spokesman at the U.S. Treasury, which is responsible for
relations with the bank, declined to say how Coady would vote.
   The U.S. government's own Export-Import Bank last week made an
unannounced loan of $9.75 million to the China National Offshore
Oil Corp. and was expected to announce another larger loan Friday.

<TEXT>
   The nation's governors pressed Congress and
President Bush on Wednesday to speed the pollution cleanup of
military bases, weapons plants and other federal lands, saying U.S.
environmental laws ``are routinely ignored'' in cases where the
states are hamstrung from enforcement.
   ``If you make a mess you clean it up. We're saying that goes for
the federal government as well as private citizens,'' Idaho Gov.
Cecil Andrus told a Capitol news conference in behalf of the
National Governors Association.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, acknowledged
there is a ``compelling'' need to give states clearer authority to
assess fees and penalties against federal government facilities
where pollution laws are violated.
   ``In Congress we establish national environmental policy. Surely
one of the goals of that policy is to assure that facilities owned
by the federal government avoid contamination of our environment,''
said Mitchell.
   Andrus, co-chairman of the task force that developed the
governors' report, said that while Bush has ``recognized the
problem'' he has proposed too little money for the federal cleanup
effort and has allowed the Environmental Protection Agency to
remain ``hamstrung'' from taking enforcement actions against
federal polluters.
   The governors' report said the extent of pollution on federal
property, ranging from military bases, to weapons plants run by the
Energy Department, to vast lands controlled by the Interior
Department, is so broad that its full scope remains undefined.
   Various government estimates on the cost of cleaning up the
nuclear weapons plants alone have ranged upwards of $100 billion.
   The governors called for an expanded program that would finish
the task over the next 30 years.
   Meantime, the governors said, the Environmental Protection
Agency should be set free to pursue federal as well as private
polluters through civil lawsuits and enforcement actions.
   The agency's ``enforcement powers have been crippled'' by the
Justice Department which has prohibited the EPA from filing
lawsuits or taking unilateral enforcement actions against other
federal agencies, said the report.
   ``The nation's chief environmental watchdog is forced to sit by
as basic environmental statutes and regulations are routinely
ignored at federally owned facilities,'' the report continued.
   Furthermore, the governors complained, state authorities often
have been thwarted in monitoring and taking action against
violators of environmental laws on federal property ``by claims of
national security and sovereign immunity.''
   Andrus, who was Interior Secretary under President Carter,
suggested that Bush could resolve the problems between the EPA and
Justice Department ``with one phone call.''
   Andrus said that the proposed $4.5 billion allocated for various
environmental cleanup efforts on federal facilities under Bush's
fiscal 1991 budget ``is inadequate to do the job.'' He said less
than half is devoted to actual cleanup activities.
   The Environmental Protection Agency lists 1,268 federal
facilities earmarked for priority cleanup efforts and that number
is expected to expand.
   For many years, federal facilities ``have been among the worst
violators'' of federal pollution laws with neither the EPA nor
state agencies able to hold facility managers accountable, the
governors complained.
   The report added that in addition to the highly publicized
violations of environmental laws at atomic weapons plants, fuels,
oil solvents, paints, acids, heavy metals and other hazardous
chemicals ``have been routinely stored and improperly disposed of''
by federal officials over the years.

   The names of 2.6 million parents who owe child
support have been given to the Internal Revenue Service so that any
federal income tax refunds they are due can be used to pay their
obligations, officials said.
   Last year, nearly $452 million was collected by garnishing
federal income tax refunds under the program.
   Parents subject to garnishing are those who owe $500 or more in
child support, or who owe at least $150 in child support and have
children receiving Aid to Families with Dependent Children
assistance.
   The program is considered a cost-effective way to make sure
children are getting the support they are due, said Eunice Thomas,
acting director of the Office of Child Support Enforcement in the
Department of Health and Human Services.
   Under the program, it costs an average of $4.54 per case to
collect an average of $654 for non-AFDC cases and an average of
$562 for AFDC cases, she said.
   The program, enacted by Congress, was begun in 1981 for AFDC
families and expanded in 1984 to other families.

<TEXT>
   Turkey said Greek Christians attacked a
Turkish state television crew Wednesday in an ethnically restive
area of northwestern Greece. The Greek government denied it.
   A Foreign Ministry statement said Greeks attacked the crew in
Komotini, near the Turkish border, where it was covering a bail
hearing for Ahmet Sadik and Ibrahim Sherif, prominent members of
the Moslem ethnic Turkish community.
   Sadik and Sherif were sentenced Jan. 25 to 18 months in prison
each for describing their minority as ``Turkish Moslem'' in
election campaign fliers last year.
   Greece recognizes only the religious identity of its 120,000
ethnic Turks and banned reference to their ethnicity in 1987.
   On Wednesday, a Komotini court refused to release the two ethnic
Turks on bail while their appeal is pending.
   The Foreign Ministry claimed a West German television team and a
West German lawyer representing Sadik and Sherif also were handled
roughly.
   ``It is cause for anxiety that these ugly attacks took place in
front of the Greek prosecutor and policemen,'' it said. ``Greek
authorities have thus shown that they completely disregard
international rules and principles applying to news media
freedoms.''
   Greece's Public Order Ministry said police protected the Turkish
television crew throughout the three days in Komotini ``despite the
fact that neither events nor conditions prevailing these days
warranted any fears.''
   ``Under these circumstances, the claims of the Turkish Foreign
Ministry can only provoke regret at the distortion of the truth,''
the ministry said.
   Three days after Sadik and Sherif were sentenced, Christians in
Komotini attacked Moslems who protested protested the verdict.
Seventeen Christians and four Moslems were slightly injured and
windows were broken in scores of shops belonging to Moslems.
   Greece ordered the Turkish consul in Komotini out of the
country, accusing him of making inflammatory statements, and Turkey
expelled the Greek consul in Istanbul in retaliation.

   A federal judge Wednesday ruled that Atlanta's

   U.S. District Judge Charles Moye ruled that the Metropolitan
Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority did not act arbitrarily. MARTA
contended the ads were political and thus banned by its ad policy.
   The local chapter of the Service Employees International Union
sued Feb. 3, claiming the ban violated freedom of speech. The union
is seeking to win a representation election Feb. 16 and 17 which
will involve about 800 Atlanta-area janitors.
   Moye said MARTA reasonably could be concerned about possible
disturbances on buses because of what he termed the political
aspect of getting people to vote for a union.
   Linda Riggins, president of the local, said union lawyers were
preparing to appeal.
   The organizational drive is part of a 2-year-old campaign to
organize janitors in big downtown office buildings, most of whom
make about $3.75 and hour and receive few benefits.

   White House science adviser D. Allan Bromley
said Wednesday that construction work on the superconducting super
collider should be delayed until industry proves it can manufacture
the specialized magnets required by the massive atom smasher.
   Bromley, director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy
in the White House, told members of the House Committee on Science,
Space and Technology that part of the $318 million requested for
the supercollider in fiscal 1991 will be spent proving that such
magnets can be built.
   ``It is prudence not to move forward until such time that we
have demonstrated that we can make the magnets industrially,''
Bromley said during sharp questioning from members of the house
committee.
   He said $300 million is to be used in 1991 for site preparation
at the supercollider site near Waxahachie, Texas, about 30 miles
south of Dallas. The science adviser said that work will be delayed
until it is proven that the magnets can be built.
   Bromley said the supercollider will require 10,000 magnets made
of superconducting material. So far, he said, it has not been
proven that industry is capable of making such magnets in such
large numbers.
   ``We're pushing technology to the absolute limit,'' he said.
``It will require tons of superconducting material.''
   Bromley said a demonstration of magnet manufacturing is expected
to be completed within a year and said no major site preparation
for the project can begin until then.
   The superconducting super collider is an underground, 53-mile
circular raceway that scientists will use to smash subatomic
particles together at very high velocities. The particles will be
compressed and accelerated by the powerful magnets placed along the
circular tunnel.
   By smashing the subatomic particles, scientists hope to answer
fundamental questions about the nature and origin of matter, a
basic goal in physics.
   Bromley was sharply questioned by several congressmen who
expressed concern about the rising price tag of the super collider.
The device _ to be the world's largest research tool _ was first
said to cost about $5 billion, but the projected cost has crept
upward.
   Rep. Sherwood L. Boehlert, R-N.Y., said the Department of
Energy, which is in charge of the project, has estimated the price
of the collider now at more than $7 billion and the final cost may
be even higher.
   ``Is there a point at which the SSC becomes simply too expensive
to build?'' Boehlert asked.
   ``The simple answer to that is yes,'' said Bromley, but he did
not put an upper limit on the cost.
   In a reference to an expensive toilet facility once built for an
Air Force airplane, Boehlert said the rising cost of the super
collider ``makes a $600 toilet seat look like a bargain.''
   ``Let me approach this from the other end,'' Bromley injected.
When the packed hearing room echoed with laughter, the science
adviser ducked his head and noted, ``that was a singularly
unfortunate expression.''
   ``Well, we'll just flush that out,'' said Boehlert, triggering
another burst of laughter.
   Browley said that the price of the super collider has gone up
because experts have examined the original design and found
``shortcomings.''
   ``The magnets are not perfect,'' he said. ``You run into trouble
if the particles run too slowly. The consensus (of the experts) is
that you must increase the speed of the particles as they enter the
ring.''
   To accomplish this, he said the design of the magnets and the
aperture, where the particles are injected, must be changed. This
raises the cost, Bromley said.

   Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., on Wednesday
endorsed the idea of restributing foreign aid, praising a
Republican proposal to trim aid from some big-ticket countries and
give it to others.
   ``Everything is on the table,'' said Byrd, chairman of the
Senate Appropriations Committee.
   Byrd also said the ``peace dividend'' _ money from cuts in
defense _ will not increase the foreign aid pie.
   ``Our foreign aid budget has taken on a new and suddenly
enhanced importance as an instrument of our goals and policies in
the world,'' said Byrd, remarking on the need to influence changing
event in Eastern Europe.
   ``It no longer can be viewed as a kind of well-heeled junior
varsity lobbyist sport,'' he said of foreign aid.
   In a statement on the Senate floor, Byrd praised Senate Minority
Leader Robert Dole, R-Kan., for proposing to re-allocate foreign
aid by cutting back on the amount of money traditionally given to
five allies: Israel, Egypt, Turkey, the Philippines and Pakistan.
They take up about 80 percent of the U.S. aid budget.
   ``Mr. Dole has done this body a service, and raised the issues
publicly, taken criticism from all sides, sat out on the edge, so
to speak, with his legs dangling over the side,'' Byrd said.
   Dole first suggested in an article in The New York Times that
five countries absorb aid reductions of 5 percent, with the
remainder redirected to Eastern Europe.
   Dole's proposal _ particularly his suggestion that aid to Israel
be reduced _ drew immediate fire from a number of Repubublican and
Democratic senators. Israel, the largest U.S. aid recipient,
receives about $3 billion a year.
   But Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the Senate
appropriations subcommittee that divides up foreign aid, welcomed
the debate.
   While not naming individual countries, Byrd said some of ``our
historic aid recipients can probably take cuts substantially larger
than 5 percent _ somewhere between 10 percent and 20 percent would
be more realistic,'' he said.
   But Byrd disagreed with Dole on the practice of congressional
``earmarking'' _ setting aside certain amounts for various
countries. Dole argued the practice limits the president's
flexibility; Byrd said the practice is a congressional perogative.
   The Bush administration has proposed an aid package of about
$14.8 billion for fiscal 1991, slightly more than the previous year.

<HEAD>GOP Announces Legislative Agenda for `Choice' but No Abortion
Mention</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MERRILL HARTSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   House Republican leaders Wednesday unveiled a
legislative agenda described as giving Americans ``the right to
make the choice'' about their lives. It makes no mention of the
most controversial ``choice'' issue: abortion.
   The national Republican Party has taken a strong anti-abortion
stand, and conservative GOP House members said that wasn't affected
by the legislative-goals list.
   House Minority Leader Robert Michel of Illinois, leadoff speaker
among GOP lawmakers describing the list to reporters, said it had
no overriding theme. He called it ``pretty much boilerplate
Republican dogma.''
   But Rep. Mickey Edwards, a key architect of the document, said,
``If there is a theme _ and we didn't approach it from that area _
it's a theme of empowerment, a theme of giving people the right to
make the choice that is going to affect their life.''
   Rep. Duncan Hunter said the legislative-agenda document referred
to ``choice in education _ using choice in the sense of exercising
freedom rather than choice in abortion, where you limit the freedom
to live of one party. I think you see that common thread throughout
the document.''
   ``I think it very strongly reinforces the traditional Republican
concept that freedom is important and that empowering people to
make their own lives better, by giving them freedoms rather than
restricting them by imposing governmental programs on them,'' the
California Republican said.
   Rep. Vin Weber of Minnesota said that for purposes of dealing
with the abortion, the House Republican leaders draw a distinction
between themselves and the GOP hierarchy, choosing to let the
Republican National Committee confront the issue.
   ``There was never a House Republican agenda that came forward
that included the right to life,'' he said. ``It's been part of our
(national party) platform.''
   ``We basically leave it at that level within the party,'' Weber
said, ``and to the vast majority of right-to-life leaders, that's
an appropriate position for our party to take.''
   Said House GOP Whip Newt Gingrich of Georgia: ``My judgment is
... the Republican Party will be the party which wants to have the
fewest possible number of abortions. The Democratic Party will be
the party which has a very large wing which is capriciously
unconcerned about when abortions occur.''
   But Gingrich also said that ``the Republicans have to accept
that some of our colleagues are going to disagree on an issue which
is profoundly emotional and profoundly important, and we're just
going to have to live within that framework.''
   Republican National Chairman Lee Atwater told GOP leaders last
month the party welcomes pro-choice candidates despite its
anti-abortion stance. And he described internal debate over
abortion as part of the ``growing pains'' of becoming a majority
party.''

<TEXT>
   East German Premier Hans Modrow
said Tuesday that German unification could come about only with the
agreement of neighboring states.
   He spoke at a 10-minute briefing following talks with
Czechoslovak Premier Marian Calfa. He declined to take questions.
   Modrow said German unification was discussed at the talks, but
that they centered on changing and improving economic ties between
the two states, closely linked when they were ruled by hard-line
Communist governments.
   Last fall, peaceful revolutions toppled the hard-line
governments in East Berlin and Prague.
   Modrow said he and Calfa agreed ``that all processes on our
continent, including that of unification of both German states,
should only be completed in a process which respects and preserves
the interests of neighbors and European states.''
   The East German premier last Thursday introduced a plan for
unifying Germany, envisaging it as a neutral state eventually
governed from Berlin.
   Modrow made no other reference to reunification and the subject
was not mentioned in a similarly brief statement from Calfa.
   Calfa said the two sides established working groups to discuss
investment, prices and tourism.
   Under new leadership headed by President Vaclav Havel,
Czechoslovakia has sought to improve ties with East Germany and
West Germany.
   German unification is a sensitive issue in Czechoslovakia, which
was occupied by Nazi Germany during World War II.
   Modrow spoke during a visit to Prague by U.S. Secretary of State
James Baker III.

   Chemist Arthur J. Barry, a pioneer of the
silicon industry, has died. He was 80.
   Barry, who had battled bone cancer for several years, died
Saturday of heart failure, doctors said.
   Barry moved to Tucson in 1973 after a 30-year career in chemical
research with the Dow Corning Corp. of Michigan. He was director of
chemical research for Dow from 1957 to 1971, when he retired.
   At the University of Arizona, he was an adjunct professor of
chemistry who in 1986 won the Distinguished Citizen Award for
service to the school.
   During his years with Dow, he was one of seven scientists
credited with the development of silicon products, now the
foundation of the computer and electronics industry.
   Barry, who specialized in the use of silicon for waterproofing,
registered 66 patents related to this industry.
   Besides his wife, Marjorie, he is survived by two daughters, a
son, and five grandchildren.
   Services were scheduled for Thursday at First United Methodist
Church.

   President Bush on Wednesday defended anew
his decision to attend next week's drug summit in Colombia and
insisted he won't do anything ``stupid or macho.''
   ``It isn't whimsical or a desire to be in harm's way,'' said
Bush. He said he was sure the summit will be secure at the site at
a well-fortified installation cut off from the Colombian mainland
except for one entrance.
   ``I'm not going to do something stupid or macho,'' Bush told the
Commonwealth Club.
   He added, laughing, that he loves the switch in his image.
``This guy they used to call timid is now macho man,'' he said.
   Bush will fly to Colombia and spend several hours at the summit
in Cartagena on Feb. 15 with Colombian President Virgilio Barco and
officials of Bolivia and Peru.
   He said it was important that he do nothing that might even
``inadvertantly'' signal to Barco that he should cut a deal with
his country's drug cartels.
   ``I think we've got good arrangements and I think it is good,
sound anti-narcotics policy to support President Barco, who is
doing an awful lot to protect our kids from the scourge of
narcotics,'' he said.
   Bush also drew applause from the crowd of more than 2,500 when
he said, ``We've condoned things in this country that we should
have condemned long ago in terms of narcotics.''
   Among those joining in the applause was former Secretary of
State George P. Shultz, seated at Bush's right. Shultz created a
stir last fall when he called for legalizing illicit drugs.

<TEXT>
   In one of her first actions as head of the
Health Care Financing Administration, Gail Wilensky is proposing to
centralize the federal operations of Medicaid in their own office,
sources said Tuesday.
   Wilensky's plan is designed to help make Medicaid more
responsive to the states, which share the cost of the program
providing health care for the poor. The federal share of the
program is about $40 billion a year.
   Creating a Medicaid bureau within the Health Care Financing
Administration ``would change the environment within HCFA to permit
Medicaid to get its share of attention,'' said a source close to
Wilensky, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
   ``The point of doing this is to make HCFA more responsive to the
states and to encourage them to find more innovative ways of
dealing with health care access.''
   Medicaid operations currently are handled in several different
offices in Wilensky's domain. Under her these would be centralized
into a single bureau that would report to her. No staff would be
cut.
   Wilensky, who took office on Monday, has presented her plan to
her boss, Louis Sullivan, secretary of Health and Human Services.
   The federal Medicaid bureaucracy coordinates the operations of
56 different Medicaid programs run by the states, the District of
Columbia and U.S. territories.

Committee actions, question and answer session, decoy motorcade

<TEXT>
   President Bush said Wednesday that Star
Wars ``makes more sense than ever'' in light of recent changes in
the Soviet Union and Estern Europe.
   Bush's comments came after he toured the nation's biggest
nuclear weapons research lab, then told a group of business leaders
he wanted to refrain from reacting to the Soviet Central
Committee's apparent endorsement of Soviet leader Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's political reforms.
   ``There's an awful lot to be hopeful for there,'' Bush said.
   But, he added, the ``last thing'' he wanted to do ``when you
have the Central Committee meeting is to try to fine-tune it from
San Francsico or Washington as to how they ought to conduct
themselves.''
   At a question-and-answer session at San Francisco's Commonwealth
Club, Bush was asked how the United States could help Gorbachev
achieve his reforms.
   ``I think we can avoid doing dumb things,'' Bush said.
   He told the business-community audience that the United States
should continue to modernize its strategic weapons programs and the
Strategic Defense Initiative.
   ``This purely defensive concept doesn't threaten a single person
anywhere in the world. God forbid, if it ever had to be used, it
would be used against missiles, not against people,'' Bush said
after touring the nearby Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory,
where the bulk of Star Wars research occurs.
   ``In the 1990s, strategic defense makes much more sense than
ever before,'' said Bush, who has proposed spending $4.5 billion on
the space-based anti-missile system in the fiscal year that begins
Oct. 1.
   ``I would rather be called cautious than reckless,'' Bush said
about his defense policy.
   The president is on a three-day trip to focus attention on his
proposed $292 billion Pentagon budget for fiscal 1991, which
Democrats say gives too much to strategic weapons systems while
closing bases.
   He tempered his proposal for wholesale closing of U.S. military
bases with a vow for federal aid to help the communities and
individuals affected.
   Civilians laid off will get top priority for other Defense
Department jobs and the administration will help communities that
lose bases ``develop powerful new economic assets, new ways to use
old bases.''
   Speaking in a heavily Democratic area where five military
installations would be closed, Bush said: ``There have been no
politics in these proposals.''
   He was applauded when he said: ``Long-standing critics of
defense spending should not turn around and block the closing of a
base in their home districts.''
   In a wide-ranging, half-hour question and answer session after
his speech, Bush:
   _Called proposals for a reunified Germany that would be a member
of NATO ``encouraging.'' The White House also announced that Bush
had invited NATO General Secretary Manfred Woerner to Camp David
this weekend to discuss the re-unification issue. West German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl will meet separately with Bush later this
mounth.
   _Said he didn't think going to Colombia on Feb. 15 for a drug
summit would be dangerous. ``I'm not going to do something stupid
or macho.''
   _Said the Soviet Union could help do more to bring about peace
in the Middle East, including normalizing diplomatic relations with
Israel.
   Several hundred protesters waged a noisy demonstration outside
the San Francisco hotel where Bush spoke, many carrying signs
protesting U.S. policy in Latin America and AIDS policy.
   The Secret Service sent a decoy presidential limousine and
modified motorcade down Ellis Street to confuse the demonstrators,
then hastily drove the president off in the opposite direction for
the airport.
   Bush also was met by demonstrators as he toured the Lawrence
Livermore lab and at a GOP fund-raising dinner Tuesday night.
   The president said he welcomed recent pro-democracy developments
in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union, but that ``we must not let
impatience, born out of euphoria, jeopardize all we hope to
achieve.''
   `We must remain in Europe as long as we are needed and wanted.
... Let us not forget that ... the Soviets still have more than
10,000 (nuclear) strategic weapons. They are modernizing them. They
have deployed two new mobile ICBMs, and their spending on strategic
defense is comparable to their spending on strategic offensive
forces.''
   Bush was briefed on latest Star Wars technology during his tour
of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, which is part of the
University of California but is under an extensive long-term
government contract to do nuclear-weapons research.
   ``If the technology I've seen today proves feasible, and I'm
told it looks very promising, no war planner could be confident of
the consequences of a ballistic missile attack. The technologies
you are now researching, developing and testing will strengthen
deterrence,'' Bush said.
   SDI has been controversial since President Reagan proposed it in
1983 as an impregnable shield capable of blocking incoming nuclear
missiles.
   Congress cut $1 billion this year from Bush's request for a $4.8
billion Star Wars budget; Bush last week asked for a $1 billion
increase for fiscal 1991.
   The president called the latest Star Wars concept, dubbed
brillant pebbles, ``the most promising'' of all SDI programs.
   Thousands of the interceptors would be orbited in clusters on
space stations, firing automatically at any intruding missiles and
ramming them like shot gun pellets.
   Bush's next stop on his three-day tour of defense installations
and Republican fund-raising events was to be Omaha, Neb., where he
will tour the underground headquarters of the Strategic Air Command
on Thursday.

   A committee led by Chancellor Helmut Kohl on
Wednesday began laying the groundwork for German unification after
the Cabinet agreed to seek immediate talks with East Germany on
joining the two countries' currencies.
   Chief government spokesman Hans Klein said Kohl would travel to
Camp David on Feb. 24 to discuss German unity with President Bush.
Government sources also said Kohl and Foreign Minister
Hans-Dietrich Genscher will travel to Moscow on Saturday for talks
with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Kohl advisor Horst Teltschik, speaking on West German television
said the chancellor's message to Gorbachev will be ``to make clear
that the (German) self-determination is advancing because the
people in East Germany are deciding the process and the speed of
self-determination, and no one else.''
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze suggested last
week that that the issue be put to an international referendum.
   Rudolf Seiters, Kohl's chief of staff, said the ``German unity''
committee began its work immediately after its formation Wednesday.
   The panel will examine all the steps necessary for unification,
including creation of a monetary union to make the West German mark
East Germany's currency. Unlike West German marks, East German
marks are not convertible.
   The West German central bank would be responsible for monetary
policy of both states under the monetary union.
   According to Seiters, West Germany plans to discuss
``confederative cooperation'' with East Germany immediately after
East Germany's first free elections, which are set for March 18.
   Seiters said immediate talks on monetary union are necessary
because of the dramatic speed of developments in East Germany and
the continuing exodus of East Germans to West Germany. Kohl on
Tuesday proposed urgent talks on uniting the nations' currencies.
   With an average of 1,800 East Germans leaving the country daily,
66,000 have arrived in West Germany since the start of the year,
adding to more than 340,000 who resettled across the border in 1989.
   The departure of skilled workers, along with strikes and
absenteeism, are driving East Germany's economy to the brink of
collapse, and the influx into West Germany is straining the
country's social services.
   Klein told reporters in Bonn the government would start talks
with the new East German government immediately after the March 18
elections ``on confederate cooperation between the two states in
Germany with a view to their growing together further.''
   ``Decisions will be required even before then,'' Klein added.
``The question of German unity has become a dominant theme. All
political forces (in East Germany) are now committed to this
objective.''
   Klein said the special committee set up to study unification
questions includes Cabinet ministers responsible for the following
areas: Foreign Affairs, Interior, Justice, Finance, Economics,
Education and Labor.
   He said the committee would work on formation of a monetary
union, financial questions, economic reforms, energy and
environment, infrustructure in East Germany, employment and social
welfare systems, legal questions, and foreign and security policy
matters.
   Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann said that after East
Germany's elections, the two nations would begin immediate
discussions on the economic reforms necessary in East Germany.
   Haussmann said a ``German-German economic miracle'' like the one
that made West Germany wealthy is possible as the two countries
draw closer together.
   West German officials have acknowledged it will cost billions of
dollars to rescue East Germany's economy and compensate for losses
of jobs as the country adjusts to a free-market economy, one of the
results of the fall pro-democracy movement.
   The peaceful revolution ended the Communists' monopoly on power,
led to the opening of the country's borders in November, and led to
the scheduling of the country's first free elections in March.
   Three leftist opposition movements agreed to join forces and
campaign as a coalition in the elections, East Germany's official
ADN news agency said Wednesday.
   The three are New Forum, Democracy Now and the Initiative for
Peace and Human Rights, said ADN. New Forum is East Germany's
best-known pro-democracy movement.
   Three conservative opposition groups, including the Democratic
Awakening, have also joined forces for the elections.

<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The tourism minister resigned
Wednesday after accusing the National Salvation Front of using
``dictatorial methods.'' He was the fourth member of the
provisional government to quit.
   The minister, Mihai Lupoi, is an army officer who played an
important role in the revolution that overthrew dictator Nicolae
Ceausescu on Dec. 22 by making the first public appeal by an
officer for soldiers to join the revolt.
   Dan Radulescu, chief of the Front's press and public relations,
said Lupoi had ``proved incompetent'' and ``had no chance of
maintaining his post'' after elections scheduled for May 20.
   ``Lupoi was a mistake of the revolution,'' Radulescu said.
``Such mistakes are inevitable when things happen as quickly as
they did here, and we are now correcting them.''
   Lupoi, a 36-year-old army architect promoted to major after the
revolution, said in an interview he also was resigning from the
military. He said he had encountered hostility in the past month
from Defense Minister Nicolae Militaru, an army general who came
out of retirement.
   His resignation follows those of Silviu Brucan, the Front's
foreign policy expert, Front spokesman Aurel Dragos Munteanu and
its interim vice president, Dumitru Mazilu.
   Brucan said in an interview the Lupoi resignation had no
connection with his and was ``not necessarily politically
significant.'' Some of Lupoi's allegations against the government
``sounded like fantasy,'' Brucan said.
   The National Salvation Front took over after the fall of
Ceausescu, who was executed Dec. 25, and rules by decree. Pressure
has grown for it to become more democratic, and it agreed recently
to share some power with other political parties in a National
Unity Council that would govern until the elections.
   Lupoi said his resignation resulted from ``differences'' with
Prime Minister Petre Roman on personal and professional matters.
   His original letter of resignation, given to Roman on Tuesday
afternoon, contained a sharp denunciation of the leadership's
methods.
   He said his attempt to reorganize the Tourism Ministry was
impeded by ``excessive government bureaucracy ... dictatorial
methods in the relationship between the government and the
ministry'' and ``an improper and ill-defined division of
responsibility between the government and the Front.''
   At a meeting Tuesday evening, Lupoi said, other ministers
accused him of ``trying to take the people into the streets''
against the Front and tried to fire him instead of letting him
resign.
   Eventually, he agreed to submit a more moderate version of his
letter and the resignation was accepted Wednesday morning, Lupoi
said.
   The minister said the Front ``had to accept'' multiparty
democracy ``because of popular demand, but they don't like it.''
   On Wednesday afternoon, 200 people gathered outside the
television headquarters in Bucharest to protest the Front's control
of radio and television.
   They carried signs saying ``We want independent television'' and
``Down with Munteanu, down with Communism.'' Munteanu kept his job
as broadcasting chief after resigning as Front spokesman.
   A report of the protest, the second this week for greater access
to television, was broadcast on the nightly TV news. ``Opinion in
the street is divided on whether TV is truly independent,'' the
report said.
   Merchant marine cadets ended a 31-hour hunger strike in Victory
Square after getting assurances Wednesday night that the government
would remove their academy from military control.
   In a demonstration at the Education Ministry, vocational
students demanded the replacement of many technical high schools
with schools oriented toward the sciences and humanities.

<HEAD>House Members Says Editing `Threatens' Integrity</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of Congress approved a resolution
Wednesday saying that editing changes in the Congressional Record
``seriously threaten the integrity'' of the House.
   The resolution, approved 373-30, came after remarks by Rep. Gus
Savage, D-Ill., were deleted from the official record of House and
Senate proceedings and debate.
   Savage took the floor last week to announce that the ethics
committee had ended its investigation of him and to call the
allegations against him a ``racist attack'' by the news media and
government officials.
   Savage, who is black, attacked the motivations of the three
white Democrats who had complained to the ethics panel: Reps.
Patricia Schroeder of Colorado, Matthew McHugh of New York and
Barney Frank of Massachusetts.
   The ethics committee concluded that Savage made ``improper
advances'' to a Peace Corps volunteer during a trip to Zaire last
March. The committee said that Savage's conduct was contrary to a
House rule on member conduct but recommended no punishment.
   The resolution approved Wednesday, sponsored by Rep. Robert
Walker, R-Pa., has no effect other than to direct the Committee on
House Administration to make recommendations on changes in
procedures for the official recording and reporting of House
proceedings.
   Walker said the editing was suggested by House Parliamentarian
Bill Brown because of House rules prohibiting attacks on other
members.
   Walker said the remarks ``were unparliamentary in nature'' and
should not have been made. But he said the larger issue was whether
the Congressional Record should be edited so that it does not
accurately reflect what is said on the floor.
   Members of Congress frequently exercise their power to rewrite
their spoken remarks before they are officially published in the
Congressional Record, and the House routinely grants speakers the
right to ``extend and revise'' their remarks in print.
   But Walker and Rep. James F. Sensenbrenner Jr., R-Wis., said
that because all House proceedings are recorded on videotape, the
House should make the written record more accurate.
   ``The time has come ... that we address the problem of the
accuracy of the Congressional Record,'' Sensenbrenner said. ``It
should not happen that in the dead of night offensive words get
X-ed out.''
   The resolution cited the editing of Savage's remarks and
``numerous other examples of deletions.''
   ``These omissions seriously threaten the integrity of the
proceedings of the House,'' the resolution said.

that he will not run for a second term, saying he and his wife have
agreed to separate.
   ``It's certainly no time to be running for governor,''
Goldschmidt said at a news conference in his office. ``It will
require giving more of myself than I am prepared to give.''
   The Democratic governor's aides recently denied rumors there
were any problems in the 25-year marriage of Goldschmidt and his
wife, Margie.
   Goldschmidt, 49, was a former Portland mayor and U.S. secretary
of transportation under President Carter. After returning to
Portland in 1981, he headed Canadian operations for the Nike
athletic wear company.
   The governor took office three years ago after winning a
hard-fought race with former Secretary of State Norma Paulus.
   His political career began in Portland in 1970 when he was
elected to the City Commission. Two years later, he was elected
mayor and presided over such projects as the construction of a
light-rail transit system.
   As governor, Goldschmidt's energy and charisma initially earned
him high marks. He started a regional economic development program,
and began a major expansion of the state's prison system. He later
focused more on social services with a Children's Agenda that
focused on providing a wide variety of help to children.
   But critics said the governor's rhetoric sometimes outran his
accomplishments, and he also was criticized for not always
following through on his initiatives.
   In the past year, Goldschmidt has been vexed by persistent
problems, including the January 1989 slaying of Corrections
Director Michael Francke, which remains unsolved. The killing
prompted investigations into alleged corruption in the prison
system.
   He and his wife have two children: Joshua, 20, and Rebecca, 17.

   When officials of the Days Inn hotel chain
planned their annual conference, they didn't have to look far for a
nice place to put up their guests _ they booked a block of rooms at
the Marriott Marquis.
   And when the Atlanta-based Days Inns of America Inc. sought out
a former president to address the gathering, instead of choosing
Georgia native Jimmy Carter, it invited his 1980 opponent, Ronald
Reagan.
   The choice of venue was simple: Days Inns needed about 600 rooms
for the visiting franchise owners as well as space for meetings,
banquets, more than 200 vendor exhibits and the speech by Reagan.
   Days Inns, which caters to a middle-class clientele, doesn't
have a hotel in town with that kind of space.
   ``We have quite a lot to put under one roof,'' said Debbie
Campbell, the chain's vice president for guest services and a chief
planner of the three-day conference which begins Thursday.
   Most of the Days Inns in the Atlanta area are smaller hotels
along interstate highways.
   The downtown Days Inn, just a short walk from the Marriott, has
about 200 rooms. The Marriott has 1,673.
   Ms. Campbell said Days Inns has been holding its annual
conferences at the Marquis for three years, and despite the
competitive nature of the hotel industry sees nothing odd about it.
   ``We wouldn't be there if they didn't provide the service we
need,'' she said. ``It's totally different _ we're not in the
convention business, Marriott is.''
   She said the idea of housing guests at Days Inns and having the
exhibits and other events at a convention center _ for example, the
cavernous Georgia World Congress Center _ was rejected because
organizers wanted everything in one place.
   ``This is the one time all of our licensees gather under one
roof,'' she said. ``We feel we lose people if we go (from a hotel)
to a convention center.''
   Day Inns' booking the gathering at a rival isn't really a
surprise, said Dave Fowler, assistant director for convention
services at the Marriott Marquis. He said several hotel chains,
including Comfort Inn and Quality Inn, have used the larger
convention-oriented hotels for meetings.
   ``It's great for us. We feel flattered that they come here,'' he
said.
   The speech by Reagan on Friday will be his first visit to
Georgia since leaving office. Reagan also was scheduled to address
a state Republican Party function Saturday.
   ``We wanted to do something that was really going to knock their
socks off,'' Ms. Campbell said. ``Who better than Ronald Reagan,
our most recent ex-president?''
   She would not say how much Reagan was being paid for his
appearance.
   Ms. Campbell said previous conferences have featured speakers
from within the company.
   Days Inns, which has a stated goal to ``replace Holiday Inn as
the standard for the middle-class traveler,'' has experienced
dramatic growth in the last decade.
   The chain, with hotels in all 50 states and four countries,
expanded from 290 hotels in 1985 to 951 last year and from 46,594
rooms in 1985 to 120,725 in 1989.
   The chain was bought in November by its largest franchisee,
Tollman-Hundley hotels, in a deal that included a $90 million cash
payment and the assumption of $675 million in debt.

<HEAD>Pentagon: Pay More Attention to Arabian Peninsula</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Pentagon's military leadership has been
told it should focus additional attention on possible regional
threats to the Arabian Peninsula, a senior Defense Department
official said Wednesday.
   The guidelines are in the Defense Planning Guidance, the
long-range planning instructions issued by Defense Secretary Dick
Cheney to help the services prepare their budgets for 1992-'97.
   The document was due last fall, but its release was delayed so
planners could assess the changes that are sweeping the Soviet
Union and Eastern Europe.
   The senior Defense Department official briefed a number of
reporters about the classified document after reports of its
contents surfaced in the media.
   Asked which regional threats are possible against the nations on
the Arabian Peninsula, the official said the document does not cite
nations by name, but he went on to say that ``Iraq and Iran have
significant armed forces.''
   The official, who spoke on condition he not be identifed by
name, contended that contrary to media reports, the document does
not instruct the services to drop the mission of defending Iran in
the event of a Soviet attack, but rather places more emphasis on
the Arabian Peninsula.
   ``Although we are focusing additional attention on the
Peninsula, our policies should continue to consider the contingency
of a Soviet attack into Iran,'' the official quoted from the
document.
   The United States has had contingency plans to counter a Soviet
attack into Iran since the Soviets invaded Afghanistan in 1979.
   The official, queried about the media reports, said the document
takes into account that U.S.-Iranian relations are ``more
problematic than they once were,'' and notes that the United States
isn't capable of mounting a defense in Iran's Zagros Mountains.
   The planning document also instructs planners to assume a
successful negotiation on conventional forces in Europe will cut
Soviet forces there, and that therefore, U.S. forces would have a
``much longer warning time'' about a massive Soviet attack, the
official said.
   The guidance instructs the services to plan for the possibility
that the United States will have to give up more of its bases
overseas and notes that Asian nations such as South Korea will be
expected to assume more of their own defense burden.

<TEXT>
   The first human recipient of an
experimental lung-assist device, a teen-ager suffering from severe
respiratory stress, died Wednesday, 4{ days after the bundle of
fine tubes was implanted in her chest.
   Melicia Harvey, 16, of Arthur City, Texas, who had remained in
critical condition, died at 5:30 a.m. of ``worsening pulmonary
failure,'' said Tim Madden, spokesman at LDS Hospital.
   The experimental IntraVascular Oxygenator, implanted during a
two-hour operation Friday, functioned properly until the girl died,
he said, and the hospital's government-approved implants will
continue.
   ``There were no clinical complications from the use of the
device, which added oxygen to and removed carbon dioxide from the
patient's blood,'' Madden said in a written statement.
   Miss Harvey's identity and details of her condition had been
kept private at her family's request until a Texas newspaper, The
Paris News, identified her and her father, Atrell Harvey II. With
the family's permission, Madden confirmed her identity Wednesday.
   The girl's mother, Edith Harvey, 41, had died of undisclosed
causes on Jan. 31, said Leon Williams, a spokesman for the Maxey
Funeral Home in Paris. He said funeral arrangements for the
daughter were not complete.
   Miss Harvey, whose father is an employee of the Campbell Soup
Co., had been a member of the student council at Frank Stone High
School in Paris, where students were taking Miss Harvey's death
``really, really hard,'' said Linda Bolton, secretary to the
principal.
   The school's 740 students include Miss Harvey's brother and
sister. Bolton said counselors were called in to talk with the
grieving students.
   The IVOX, a 20-inch bundle of hundreds of synthetic tubes about
as fine as human hair, with walls so thin that oxygen and carbon
dioxide can pass through, was designed to give damaged lungs time
to rest and recover.
   It is inserted via the neck or groin into the inferior vena
cava, the large vein that brings blood to the heart.
   Two tubes the diameter of a soda straw are attached to the
bundle of tubes and lead out of the body. One delivers oxygen to
the blood while the other removes carbon dioxide.
   The IVOX was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
in September for temporary implantation in up to 10 humans at LDS
and three other medical centers: Hershey Medical Center at
Pennsylvania State University, the University of Michigan Medical
Center in Ann Arbor and the Los Angeles County-University of
Southern California Medical Center.
   Madden said that in its most severe forms, adult respiratory
distress syndrome is fatal in 90-95 percent of all cases. It has a
variety of causes and is characterized by an inability of the lung
to transfer oxygen to the blood.
   Dr. J.D. Mortensen, chief developer of the IVOX, for a company
called CardioPulmonics Inc., declined to discuss Miss Harvey's
case, but indicated her death wasn't as a surprise to doctors.
   ``Ninety percent of this group (the 10 approved implants) are
expected to die,'' he said.
   Mortensen said that while he and other doctors will spend months
reviewing the case before making a final assessment, early
indications are that the IVOX worked well.
   ``There were no complications,'' Mortensen said. ``It will take
a long time to review the mountain of data we gathered with this
case. From what we know with this case, it (the IVOX) was extremely
successful.''
   He said a second implant will be made.
   ``We're just waiting for the right case, at any one of the
centers,'' Mortensen said.
   Miss Harvey also received conventional treatments, which
ordinarily include mechanical ventilation, antibiotics, and
medications designed to remove excess fluid from the body and
support heart function, he said.
   Madden said no news conferences or briefings were planned.
``There isn't really anything more they (doctors) can or will
say,'' he said.
   Before Miss Harvey died, it was unclear how long doctors
intended to leave the device inside her. FDA guidelines limit
implants to seven days, and Madden had said any further use would
require FDA permission.
   Protocol set by the FDA stipulates that the device be used on
patients requiring 100 percent oxygen who otherwise have no better
than a 10 percent chance of survival.
   The IVOX, developed by Salt Lake City-based CardioPulmonics
Inc., can satisfy as much as half of the body's need for oxygen
delivery and carbon dioxide elimination.
   Mortensen said it isn't an artificial lung but eventually could
lead to one. He has said the initial experiments will involve only
patients with acute lung diseases like pneumonia or smoke
inhalation, not chronic disorders such as cystic fibrosis or
emphysema.

   Three Arizona dentists were indicted Wednesday
on a charge of conspiring to fix patient fees in the first felony
antitrust charge brought against medical practictioners in 50
years, the Justice Department said.
   The indictment, returned by a federal grand jury in Tucson,
Ariz., accused three dentists and their corporations of conspiring
to fix co-payment fees of patients who are members of pre-paid
dental plans.
   Aaron L. Alston, Ronald D. Walker and Richard B. Meyer were
charged with price fixing, a violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act
that carries a possible three-year prison term.
   Alston's professional corporation and Desert Valley Dental Ltd.,
operated by Walker, were also named as defendants in the one-count
indictment.
   ``Price fixing among competitors is a crime,'' said Assistant
Attorney General James Rill, head of the Justice Department's
anti-trust division. ``Doctors enjoy no immunity from this
well-settled rule.''
   The Justice Department said the indictment marked the first time
in 50 years that a felony antitrust indictment had been brought
against a medical practicioner.
   A conviction also carries a fine that is the largest of three
alternatives: $250,000, twice the gain of the defendant or twice
the loss to victims. Corporations could be fined $1 million if that
amount exceeds figures that are twice the gain or loss.

<HEAD>Valenti Says Outlook for Movie Industry is Healthy</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Americans shelled out $5.03 billion at box
offices across the country this past year, making 1989 the most
successful year in motion picture history, the industry's chief
spokesman reports.
   Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Association of
America, recited the glowing figures in a speech to movie
distributors, exhibitors and theater owners attending the annual
ShoWest exposition.
   Valenti said the 1989 box office take was up 83 percent from the
1980 figure of $2.74 billion. The number of admissions increased
10.9 percent during the decade, from 1.022 billion in 1980 to 1.133
billion last year.
   Teen-agers are no longer as significant a force in the industry
as they once were, Valenti said, dropping from 42 percent of the
market in 1980 to 30 percent last year. The over-40 crowd picked up
the slack, accounting for 23 percent of all attendees last year,
compared to 13 percent in 1980.
   ``Thank God the over-40s are going to the movies now,'' Valenti
told reporters before his speech.
   The movie chief said many parts of the country may see $8 ticket
prices ``if inflation continues at 4 to 5 percent a year.'' The
average movie ticket price is now $4.44, Valenti said.
   At the opposite end of the scale, Valenti said there is a
proliferation of discount theaters willing to let patrons in for
peanuts to hawk expensive popcorn and other treats.
   ``Concessions are a major profit center for every theater,''
Valenti said. ``Many theaters make 81 percent profit on their
concessions. A $3 bag of popcorn costs 17 cents, a $2.25 Coke 12
cents.
   ``My guess is that most theaters would let people come in free
if they could'' just to get the movie-goer to buy the inflated
concessions.
   While theater owners make money from the box office and the
concession stand, the film distributor earns only from the dollars
deposited at the ticket window.
   ``The question is whether you can cut your admission costs down
to 50 cents or 25 cents, stripping the distributor of his
revenues,'' Valenti said. ``It doesn't make any sense.
   ``Discount houses are growing very rapidly, enticing people into
theaters,'' Valenti said. ``They don't care about the box office.
They want people to come in to buy the concessions.''
   Valenti said the movie theater industry will continue to thrive
despite television ``if you have a good movie and show it in a
good, clean theater.''
   Movies remain the ``cheapest game in town'' when compared to the
cost of events like professional sports, Valenti said.
   Actor Jimmy Stewart was to present a special tribute to
Universal Studios Tuesday night in honor of their 75th anniversary.
   ShoWest runs through Thursday.

   A prosecutor told jurors Tuesday to listen
to the victim when they deliberate the case of a man accused of
raping a 7-year-old boy, cutting off his penis and leaving him for
dead.
   But a defense lawyer emphasized discrepancies between the boy's
description of his attacker's clothing and speech and those of
defendant Earl Kenneth Shriner.
   Jurors deliberated nearly four hours after receiving the case,
then retired for the night. Deliberations were to resume Wednesday
morning.
   Shriner is charged with first-degree attempted murder and two
counts of first-degree rape.
   Judge Thomas R. Sauriol gave the panel 20 minutes of instruction
on the 6-day-old case and said they could reduce the charges
against Shriner.
   Deputy Prosecutor Barbara Corey-Boulet told the Pierce County
Superior Court jury that the boy's recall has been consistent on at
least one fact: the identity of his attacker.
   ``(The boy) knows who attacked him,'' Corey-Boulet said.
``Listen to the voice of the child.''
   Defense lawyers Lloyde Alton and Dino Sepe called no defense
witnesses, pinning their case instead on an effort to discredit the
boy's testimony.
   The child may have picked Shriner from a photo montage and in
person because of seeing him previously in the neighborhood, Alton
said in his closing argument.
   The boy said his attacker wore a ``green and white jacket with
... shiny material,'' Alton said, holding up Shriner's dull gray
jacket.
   The child also described a fishing hat with hooks. But other
witnesses said Shriner wore a white bicycle helmet that day, Alton
noted.
   And although the boy failed to mention anything unusual in
Shriner's speech, all other witnesses said Shriner had a speech
impediment.
   ``They have focused on one individual and decided this is the
guy,'' Alton told the jury.
   The prosecutor dismissed the failure of the boy, who has turned
8, to remember some details of the May 20 attack. She blamed his
lack of recall on the shock caused by the savagery of the attack.
   She said Shriner lied when he told police blood on his jacket
was from a bicycle accident. Laboratory tests proved the blood
could have been the boy's but was definitely not Shriner's.
   Shriner, 40, has an extensive history of violence against young
people and confinement in institutions for the retarded and
deranged.
   The attack occurred in woods near where the boy lives. Police
who interviewed the boy after the attack said Shriner lured him
into the woods where he placed a yellow strap around his neck,
raped him repeatedly and cut off his penis.
   An inmate in a cell near Shriner's testified that Shriner said
he cut off the boy's penis because he refused to urinate on him.
   Doctors who treated the child at Mary Bridge Children's Hospital
said the body's natural defense mechanisms, which direct blood to
interior organs during times of extreme fear, may have saved his
life.
   The boy has undergone corrective surgery, the cost of which was
covered by a trust fund created with donations following the
heavily publicized attack.
   Media coverage was so wide that the judge went 120 miles north
to Bellingham to pick a jury for the trial in Tacoma.
   The vicious attack galvanized public opinion in the state and
led to a governor's task force addressing the problem of sex
predators. Since the attack, one former sex offender has been
arrested and charged in the deaths of three young boys in the
Portland, Ore., area.
   Police in Lynnwood, a Seattle suburb, and Tacoma have alerted
the public when known sex offenders were released from detention,
and the Legislature is nearing approval of a new law to crack down
on sex predators.

   Attorneys for Exxon Valdez skipper
Joseph Hazelwood on Wednesday attacked testimony by a Coast
Guardsman's wife who says she saw Hazelwood drinking in a bar hours
before the tanker went to sea.
   The testimony by Janice Delozier, whose husband, Mark, was one
of the first Coast Guard investigators to board the ship after it
ran aground, puts Hazelwood at the Pipeline Club more than two
hours before the defense contends he was there.
   The time element is critical in determining how much liquor
Hazelwood might have consumed before taking command of the Exxon
Valdez on March 23, the night it struck a reef, triggering the
nation's worst oil spill.
   Hazelwood, 43, of Huntington, N.Y., is being tried in Superior
Court on a felony charge of second-degree criminal mischief and
misdemanor charges of reckless endangerment, negligent discharge of
oil and operating a vessel while intoxicated. If convicted on all
counts, he could be sentenced to up to seven years, three months in
prison and $61,000 in fines.
   Mrs. Delozier insisted she saw Hazelwood ordering a drink around
1:45 p.m.
   Hazelwood's shipmates have testified they had lunch with him in
Valdez from 12:30 to about 2 p.m., dropped him off in a shopping
center near the bar and didn't see him again until about 4 p.m.
when they had drinks at the bar.
   The ship grounded shortly after midnight, spilling more than 10
million gallons of crude oil into Prince William Sound. The spill
killed thousands of birds, fish and other wildlife and blackened
hundreds of miles of rocky shore.
   Mrs. Delozier came forward about 10 days after the accident to
say she had seen the captain at the Pipeline Club, a Valdez bar.
She said her memory had been prodded by seeing a picture of
Hazelwood in the newspaper.
   ``My immediate reaction was, `Wow, I saw him,''' she testified.
   She recalled going to the club during a lunch break from her
dental assistant's job and said she was drinking coffee when a man
in a peaked hat came in and ordered vodka on the rocks. She said
she's sure it was Hazelwood.
   Mrs. Delozier said she told her husband, who gave her two days
to think about whether she wanted to tell authorities. Later, she
was interviewed by the FBI and Coast Guard, she said, while her
husband stood by and prompted her recollections.
   Defense attorney Michael Chalos vigorously attacked her account,
noting the participation of her husband in the interview. He
focused on her statement that she didn't come forward earlier
because she thought people might find her story ``fishy.''
   ``Why did you think people would think it was fishy?'' asked
Chalos.
   ``Human nature. You know, two Deloziers. My husuband got a lot
of publicity,'' she replied.
   ``Did you want to get publicity?'' asked Chalos.
   ``I didn't want anything to do with it,'' said the witness,
speaking rapidly in a thick Southern accent. ``And then there were
the ever-present questions, `What were you doing in a bar?'''
   Chalos asked ``how come'' Mrs. Delozier hadn't discussed her
recollection with the woman who she says waited on Hazelwood.
   ``There's no `how come' involved,'' snapped the witness. ``I'm
not the town crier.''
   The defense attorney asked if it ever occurred to Mrs. Delozier
she might be mistaken in identifying Hazelwood.
   ``It has occurred to me, sir,'' she said.
   Asked if she tried to verify her identification, she said, ``I
didn't feel I had to.''
   ``But if you had doubts?'' Chalos said before the woman cut him
off.
   ``When did I say I had doubts? I knew who I saw 100 percent,''
she said. ``I wouldn't be sitting here under oath if I had those
doubts.''
   She acknowledged, however, that in an interview with a state
police investigator last week she placed Hazelwood in the bar
between 12:30 and 1:30 p.m. She said she was confused by the
passage of time since the event.

<DATELINE>RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Lutheran World Federation
elected a new president Wednesday at an assembly in southern
Brazil, a spokeswoman said.
   The new leader, Brazil's Gottfried Braqemeier, promised to work
so that ``the cry of the people of Latin America, and all of the
world's oppressed, is heard,'' spokeswoman Paula Voight quoted him
as saying.
   Braqemeier, elected to a six-year term, is president of the
Evangelical Church of Lutheran Confession, the largest Lutheran
church in Latin America, Ms. Voight said.
   She said more than 1,000 Lutherans from more than 60 countries
were participating in the assembly, being held in Curitiba, 505
miles southwest of Rio.
   Early Wednesday, about 100 conference participants sang songs
and marched through Curitiba with a wooden cross to show support
for agrarian reform to benefit Brazil's estimated 12 million
landless peasants.
   Brazil's outgoing president, Jose Sarney, promised an agrarian
reform program after taking office five years ago, but it was
carried out only marginally.
   Amnesty International, the London-based human rights
organization, says more than 800 peasants have died in clashes with
landowners during Sarney's five-year term.
   Voight said conference participants were expected to release
documents supporting less burdensome terms of payment on Latin
America's $400 billion-plus foreign debt before the weeklong

   Twenty alleged mobsters were indicted on charges
including murder, extortion and racketeering after an eight-year
probe of the city's underworld, U.S. Attorney General Dick
Thornburgh announced Wednesday.
   ``These defendants are alleged to be major participants in the
Chicago crime syndicate,'' Thornburgh said at a news conference.
   The government said those indicted by a federal grand jury were
engaged in illegal gambling, high-interest loans and the collection
of ``street taxes'' from other criminals. Several are accused of
using murder and extortion as enforcement tactics.
   The indictments detail the cases of three independent bookmakers
who balked at paying street taxes and were slain. Prosecutors say
they believe the indictments represent a rare solution of
underworld murders.
   ``Obviously, this was a powerful group of individuals,'' said
acting U.S. Attorney Ira Raphaelson, citing what he described as
their ability to operate rackets for years.
   Those indicted, Raphaelson said, operated as the Joseph Ferriola
street crew, a segment of the city's crime syndicate.
   He refused to say how many street crews are believed to operate
in Chicago, how big a role the Ferriola crew played in the mob or
whether the indictments were expected to reduce crime in the city.
   Rocco Infelise, 67, of suburban River Forest, who allegedly
succeeded Ferriola after his death last year, is charged with a
variety of offenses, including murder, racketeering conspiracy,
illegal gambling and tax cheating.
   Also charged with racketeering is Salvatore DeLaurentis, 52, of
suburban Inverness.
   The FBI said Infelise and DeLaurentis were arrested Wednesday at
O'Hare International Airport when they arrived on a flight from
Florida. Of the other 18 defendants, all but one had been taken
into custody.
   The government is seeking forfeiture of the homes of Infelise
and DeLaurentis and $3.7 million in proceeds from alleged
racketeering activities.
   Some of defendants also are accused of conspiring to bribe
public officials in Illinois to protect the street crew and of
planning to bribe officials in Wisconsin.
   Raphaelson said there isn't any indication the Wisconsin plans
were realized or that any Wisconsin officials knew about the plan.
   The indictment alleges that three people were killed because
they refused to pay street taxes _ fees to the syndicate for the
privilege of running criminal activities.
   According to the indictment, Anthony Reitinger was fatally shot
in Chicago in 1975, Robert Plummer was beaten to death in the
Libertyville suburb in 1982 and Hal Smith was strangled in suburban
Long Grove in 1985.
   The 102-page indictment contains 42 counts against the 20
defendants.
   In addition to Infelise and DeLaurentis, those indicted are
Louis Marino, 56, of Palos Park; Robert Bellavia, 50, Addison;
Robert Salerno, 55, Park Ridge; William Jahoda, 47, Itasca; Michael
Sarno, 32, Chicago; Harry Aleman, 51, Oakbrook; Edward Stevenson,
71, Elmwood Park; Robert Covone, 34, Lombard; William DiDomenico,
47, Mount Prospect; Michael Zitello, 35, Brookfield; Robert
Garrison, 54, Libertyville; Thomas McCandless, 56, Northbrook; Paul
Spano, 59, Chicago; Ronald ReRosa, 28, Melrose Park; Frank Maltese,
59, Cicero; James Coniglio, 53, Berwyn; James Nicholas, 47, Hoffman
Estates; and James Damopoulos, 34, Chicago.
   Authorities wouldn't say which one of the defendants remained at
large.

<HEAD>Boy Who Admitted Molesting 64 Children Faces New Charges</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The case of a 13-year-old boy who
authorities say has admitted sexually abusing as many as 64
children in a church nursery is an alarming example of children who
molest children, a researcher said.
   The youth admitted molesting dozens of boys and girls between
the ages of 18 months and 4 years left at a church nursery while
their parents attended services, according to Muskegon County
Juvenile Court documents and Juvenile Court Judge Neil Mullally.
   The alleged incidents occurred between 1985 and 1988 in the
Muskegon County town of Fruitport, 40 miles west of Grand Rapids.
   The boy, identified in court records as David Andrew Hawkey,
pleaded guilty in May to second-degree criminal sexual conduct for
molesting a 4-year-old. The extent of the case became known while
he was undergoing court-ordered therapy, and confessed to molesting
other children.
   ``In too many cases, signs are ignored and adults reduce it to
sex play or experimentation and believe there's nothing to worry
about. ... Then, you hear about something like this,'' said Dr.
Toni Cavanagh Johnson, a researcher in the field of young sex
offenders. She is not connected to the Fruitport case.
   David was charged this week with two counts of first-degree
criminal sexual conduct. He is at a residential treatment center,
and if convicted of the new charges, could be sentenced to remain
in treatment until he is 19.
   Authorities said David was able to name 47 children and provided
descriptions of the rest. Nearly all of the cases have been
corroborated through interviews and medical examinations, the judge
said.
   David was a volunteer at the Fruitport Bethel Baptist Church.
Nursery supervisors were always present but authorities said the
boy molested the children in restrooms or while baby-sitting at
church members' homes.
   The alleged molestations ranged from fondling to rape,
authorities say.
   The boy's parents have refused to comment. David's 17-year-old
brother, Paul, has also been charged with first-degree criminal
sexual conduct for allegedly molesting a 4-year-old boy at the
church in 1988. The elder boy's attorney has denied the charge.
   Johnson is clinical director of the Support Program for
Abused-Reactive Kids at Children's Institute International, a
private non-profit mental health facility in Los Angeles.
   She said she has interviewed 200 children who have molested
other children and ``the majority have been sexually abused and
nearly all of them have been exposed prematurely to sexuality. They
are all extremely confused about sexuality and show an interest in
it far beyond their age.''
   Johnson said it's hard to gauge the severity of the problem
because so few sex offenders under the age of 14 are prosecuted and
little data is available.
   Johnson, who said she has seen children as young as 3 years old
acting out sexual aggression, added that children living in an
atmosphere of violence, promiscuity or neglect appear to be most
prone to becoming sexually aggressive.
   ``Almost all of them have witnessed physical aggression at home;
they seem to have paired sex and aggression in their head,'' she
said in a telephone inteview Tuesday.
   In a 1988 report commissioned by the Michigan Department of
Mental Health, researchers found that 96 percent of all juvenile
sex offenders are male and that the median age was 14. The median
age of their victims was 7.
   In most cases, the older child knows his victim, and uses
threats, coercion or violence to keep the victim from disclosing
the crime.
   In the Fruitport case, the boy admitted he threatened to cut his
victims' heads off with a sword or lock them in the bathroom if
they told their parents, said Juvenile Court caseworker Debra
Jensen.
   Parents gradually became aware of the alleged assaults after
some of the children began complaining of rectal pain, wetting
their beds and recreating the incidents with other children, said
the Rev. Billie Anderson, pastor of the church.

<TEXT>
   The Sandinista-dominated National
Assembly on Wednesday approved amnesty for more than 1,000
political prisoners, pre-empting a key opposition pledge less than
three weeks before elections.
   The Sandinista party predicted it will win the Feb. 25 elections
by a landslide and that the United States, unable to ignore the
results, will move to normalize relations with Soviet-backed
Nicaragua.
   ``A landslide victory will push normalization with the United
States,'' read the headline on a front-page story about the
elections in the Sandinista newspaper Barricada.
   Nicaragua, however, has refused to allow a 20-member U.S.
congressional group named by President Bush to monitor the
elections, and Sen. Richard Lugar said in Washington Wednesday that
the delegation was disbanded. Former President Jimmy Carter heads a
separate observer group.
   President Daniel Ortega, seeking another six-year term, made the
amnesty proposal last week and the National Assembly rubber-stamped
it Wednesday with a 76-4 vote.
   The amnesty covers 1,189 people, most of them accused of taking
part in the U.S.-backed Contra insurgency. About 95 are already out
of prison and under house arrest or restricted by conditional
liberties.
   The amnesty also covers 39 ex-officers of the hated National
Guard that defended Anastasio Somoza's rightist dictatorship, which
the Sandinistas overthrew in 1979.
   The prisoners are expected to be released Friday and Saturday,
said Sandinista lawmaker Danilo Aguirre.
   The government also freed 1,984 political prisoners last April,
but the Permanent Commission on Human Rights, an independent group,
claims at least 4,000 more are held in prisons and jails nationwide.
   Ortega, who has taken pains during the campaign to mend his
often fractious relationship with the Roman Catholic Church, said
he decided to ask for the amnesty at the urging of Cardinal Miguel
Obando y Bravo, the Roman Catholic archbishop of Nicaragua.
   Freedom for political prisoners, ending the military draft and
reviving Nicaragua's shattered economy are key planks in the
platform of Ortega's main opponent, Violeta Barrios de Chamorro,
publisher of the opposition newspaper La Prensa and leader of the
U.S.-backed United National Opposition.
   UNO, a 14-party coalition, is the Sandinistas' main challenger
in the general election.
   The language in the Barricada article lacked the acrimony that
usually accompanies government comments on the United States, and
reinforced a common Sandinista theme of late, a desire for normal
relations.
   Unlike earlier articles, the story was restrained in tone and
referred to the United States by name instead of the usual
``Yankees,'' ``Gringo imperialist aggressors'' and other derogatory
phrases.
   Barricada paraphrased Interior Minister Tomas Borge as saying
the Sandinistas will garner at least 70 percent of the vote in the
elections, placing them ``in unsurpassable conditions for the
government of the United States not only to recognize the results,
but to start normalizing relations with Nicaragua.''
   But while the article's main thrust was one of reconciliation
with the United States _ which supports the Contra rebels and
imposed economic sanctions _ it also suggested the military may not
obey a victorious opposition.
   ``For example, with the existence of (the Sandinista)
revolutionary armed forces, how could officers obey the absurd
orders of those who would become defense and interior ministers?''
Borge said at a meeting Tuesday night with 1,600 Sandinista
activists.
   A $49 million non-lethal aid package to the Contras, approved by
the U.S. Congress last year, will run out shortly after the
elections, and Congress has shown no inclination to renew aid to
the rebels.
   The Sandinistas have thrice expelled U.S. diplomats, accusing
them of inciting violence and engaging in plans to destabilize the
government. The United States has retaliated each time, expelling
as many Nicaraguan diplomats from Washington.
   Political observers and non-U.S. diplomats generally agree that
while the Sandinistas have an impressive campaign machine,
widespread discontent over the economy might give UNO a victory at
the ballot box.

<HEAD>Juries Award More Than $475 Million In 10 Largest Civil Suits in
1989</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY ROGERS</BYLINE>
<HEAD>Associated Press Writer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Juries awarded more than $475 million in damages
in the nation's 10 largest civil lawsuits last year, but some
attorneys say jumbo verdicts are declining as insurers and
corporations lobby for limits on awards.
   The largest verdicts came in cases of medical malpractice,
product liability, wrongful firing, defamation, sexual abuse and
personal injury.
   Half of the judgments were against corporations, three were
against city, county or state governments and agencies, and two
were against individuals, according to the Boston-based Lawyers
Alert magazine.
   The awards were topped by twin verdicts totaling more than $152
million awarded to two factory workers in Baltimore who got lung
disease from exposure to asbestos.
   In the second-largest judgment, New York City's Transit
Authority was ordered to pay $58 million to a 20-year-old man whose
legs were cut off when he fell in front of a subway car.
   ``This shows that if a corporate defendant does something that
offends the American public, they're going to get slammed,'' said
Larry Bodine, publisher of Lawyers Alert. ``These juries are made
up of regular folks, and if a company gets jurors mad at them,
they're going to get creamed.''
   But amid talk of a lawsuit crisis or reform of the tort system,
in which civil actions are brought for wrongful acts, injury or
damage, the number of million-dollar judgments is dropping.
   After peaking at 562 in 1985, the number of million-dollar-plus
awards dropped in 1986 and 1987, the last years for which complete
figures are available, according to Jury Verdict Research Inc.
   ``I think we are seeing the effects of the tort reform movement
(seeking limits on awards) and the impact of advertising by
insurance companies saying that there is a lawsuit crisis,'' said
Tom Harrison, editor of Lawyers Alert.
   William Bailey, counsel for the Insurance Information Institute,
an insurance industry trade organization, said whopping judgments
showed ``the law has gotten carried away.''
   ``Punitive damage awards are getting bigger every year, and they
don't do any good,'' Bailey said. ``They don't alter the
anti-social behavior of companies that we're trying to prevent.''
   But Russ Herman, president of the Trial Lawyers Association of
America, called tort reform ``tort deform'' and said it was an
attempt by corporations to escape accountability for their actions.
   ``This is just another way for corporate America to increase its
profits at the cost of American justice,'' Herman said.
   Herman said most damage suits involved corporations suing each
other.
   Most of the top 10 awards involved individual injury or death,
including:
   _ A $30 million verdict against New York City after attorneys
showed a 7-year-old boy was paralyzed when he fell from a 15-foot
high playground sculpture.
   _ $44 million awarded when a family of four was killed when the
gas tank of their Toyota station wagon exploded in a collision.
   In two suits, plaintiffs were awarded damages for being
wrongfully fired.
   However, just because damages are awarded doesn't mean they are
received, Bodine said. The status of the top 1989 awards wasn't
available.
   ``In many cases, the full amount is never collected,'' Bodine
said. ``The award may be reduced on appeal, or the defendant may
just go belly-up and say, `I don't have the money.'''

   Public schools were closed and several
hundred blacks chanting ``soul power'' and ``I am somebody''
marched on City Hall on Wednesday to protest white leadership of
Selma's mostly black school system.
   The crowd peacefully went to the City Hall council chamber for
45 minutes of prayers and speeches in support of Norward Roussell,
the first black school superintendent in this 1960s battleground of
the civil rights movement.
   Roussell was dismissed last week by the Board of Education, a
majority of whose members are white. But amid protests, the board
reinstated Roussell and he returned to the job Wednesday.
   The board closed all 11 public schools in Selma's 70 percent
black, 6,000-student system Wednesday after racial tensions rose
and there were scuffles between white and black students Tuesday
morning.
   Roussell announced Wednesday afternoon the schools would remain
closed Thursday and until ``we are able to assure the safety and
security of our students and staff.''
   Protest leaders called on the board to extend Roussell's
contract beyond June, when it is set to expire. They also demanded
that blacks be given an equal voice on the school board, and that
board members be elected, rather than appointed by the City
Council, which also has a white majority.
   ``Indeed, we must turn Selma right side up and wrong side out,''
demonstrator Spiver Gordon told the cheering crowd at City Hall.
   Yusef Salaam, a legal services attorney, noted that
demonstrators came peacefully to City Hall on Wednesday. But, he
said, ``there's no telling how we will come tomorrow.''
   The dispute goes back to December, when the six white members of
the 11-member board voted to let Roussell's $80,000-a-year contract
run out in June.
   They cited an evaluation critical of his managerial skills.
Roussell said the evaluation was unsubstantiated, and black protest
leaders said he was being fired because he is black.
   After the December vote, the five black members of the board
announced they were resigning, though they have yet to sign formal
resignation papers.
   The controversy led to periodic school boycotts.
   The protests turned confrontational after the board decided last
week to remove Roussell as superintendent immediately, rather than
waiting until June. Four blacks were arrested on misdemeanor
charges Monday after a melee at Mayor Joe Smitherman's office.
   Rose Sanders, one of the four arrested, was injured. Wearing a
neck brace, with one arm in a sling, she spoke from a wheelchair at
a hospital Wednesday, saying she was hurt when she was carried
bodily from Smitherman's office by police.
   She said she was dragged out of the mayor's office and up the
steps of the Police Department. Smitherman has said the four were
allowed to leave his office however they wanted and that all four
refused to move unless carried.
   Mrs. Sanders' husband, Democratic state Sen. Hank Sanders, said
Wednesday he would use ``any means necessary'' to personally
respond to what he described as abuse of his wife.
   Smitherman said he was working to resolve the school conflict
even though he isn't officially part of the education system. He
said he was a ``readily available symbol'' for black frustrations.
   After the threat of violence forced the closing of two schools
Tuesday morning, the white members of the school board reinstated
Roussell as superintendent and urged the five black members of the
board to resume work.
   The reinstatement came after the interim superintendent, the
Rev. F.D. Reese, a black who is principal of Selma High School,
announced his resignation so Roussell could return to the job.
   Roussell met for two hours Wednesday morning with principals and
his central office staff to discuss ``the safety of our students
and the security of our schools.''
   ``We are in a crisis situation,'' he told reporters. ``The press
is not my priority right now. My priority is getting those kids
back in school.''

   A man with a long record of violence toward
young people was convicted Wednesday of raping, sexually mutilating
and trying to kill a 7-year-old boy during an attack in woods near
the child's home.
   The jury, brought in from 120 miles away because of pretrial
publicity, deliberated 4} hours, after six days of testimony,
before finding Earl Kenneth Shriner guilty of first-degree
attempted murder, two counts of first-degree rape and first-degree
assault.
   Shriner looked frightened when the jury returned the verdict. He
swallowed visibly and bit his lower lip as the guilty announcements
were read.
   The jury also returned two special verdicts finding Shriner used
a deadly weapon in committing the rapes. Under state sentencing
guidelines, that added 8 years to the maximum sentence of 91\ years.
   Deputy Prosecutor James Roche said prosecutors would ask for a
longer sentence under rules allowing a judge to exceed the maximum
term in extraordinary circumstances.
   ``We want to see that he never gets out again,'' Roche said.
   Pierce Count Superior Court Judge Thomas R. Sauriol set
sentencing for March 26.
   Helen Harlow, mother of the boy, said she was relieved by the
jury's decision. ``It's over for me,'' she said. ``The sentencing
is next.''
   The boy's family sighed and wept quietly. Betty Foote, the boy's
grandmother, said the child, now 8, was at school and that his
mother would tell him about the verdict when he came home.
   ``He'll be able to put all this behind him almost immediately,''
Ms. Harlow said.
   Dolores Shriner, the defendant's mother, left the courtroom
quickly but later told a reporter: ``How would you feel if you were
his mother?''
   Jurors signed a form saying they didn't want to speak with the
news media after the trial.
   Prosecutors said Shriner, 40, used threats to lure the boy into
a wooded area near their south Tacoma homes, then raped him orally
and anally, cut off his penis, choked him with a strap or cord
around his neck and left him for dead. A jail inmate testified that
Shriner said he mutilated the boy because the youngster would not
urinate on him.
   Neighbors found the boy, naked, bloody, covered with mud and
practically incoherent, soon after the attack.
   A trust fund established with donations has financed extensive
corrective surgery for the boy, but he faces more operations when
he approaches adulthood.
   Defense lawyer Lloyde Alton did not call any witnesses,
including Shriner, but attacked the boy's identification of his
client.
   In a 24-year history of violent attacks on young people, Shriner
has been confined at Rainier School for the retarded; Western State
Hospital, a mental institution, and the Washington Corrections
Center, but the jury was barred from hearing of his background.
   The jury was chosen 120 miles away in Bellingham because of
pre-trial publicity, which also helped galvanize public sentiment
for tougher laws on sex predators.
   Deputy prosecutor Barbara Corey-Boulet and Alton agreed that the
most compelling evidence was the boy's own testimony.
   Corey-Boulet said the most consistent feature of all the boy's
accounts was his identification of Shriner.
   ``(The boy) knows who attacked him,'' she told jurors. ``Listen
to the voice of the child.''
   Alton said the boy might have picked Shriner from a police photo
montage and later identified him in person as the attacker because
of previous, unremembered encounters in the neighborhood.
   He said the boy's description of his assailant consistently
deviated from descriptions of Shriner offered by other witnesses
before and after the attack.
   The boy said Shriner wore a shiny green and white jacket, gray
pants and a camouflage style fishing hat with fishhooks in it, and
said nothing about Shriner's speech impediment.
   But Alton noted that a bloodstained jacket seized from Shriner
was a dull gray with maroon lining, the pants he was wearing were
blue jeans, he was seen throughout the day of the attack wearing a
white bicycle helmet.
   The attack helped lead to formation of a governor's task force
on sex predators and the Washington Legislature is close to
enacting the task force's recommendations, including longer prison
terms and civil commitment for incorrigible sex offenders.

   A 20-member congressional group named by
President Bush to observe this month's elections in Nicaragua has
been disbanded after members were denied visas by the leftist
Managua government, Sen. Richard Lugar said Wednesday.
   Lugar, an Indiana Republican, said President Bush concurs that
there is no chance for the group to serve its intended function of
determining whether the Feb. 25 balloting is free and fair.
   ``The Nicaraguan government has remained intransigent in
arbitrarily choosing those it wished to observe the election and
making a point of hostility to any official U.S. observers,'' Lugar
said.
   The White House said in a statement it was ``disappointed that
Sandinista stonewalling has brought this about.''
   The visa refusals and other actions ``bring into question the
Sandinista commitment (to free elections). These include continued
violence and coercion against opposition activists; imbalance in
access to the media and the use of state resources to help the
Sandinista candidates,'' said the White House statement, telephoned
to news agencies Wednesday night by spokesman Roman Popadiuk.
   ``Politically motivated delays by the Sandinistas to
disbursement of non-partisan campaign funds to the opposition for
such activities as voter registration and election monitoring have
forced cancellation or curtailment of critical election support
programs.''
   The campaign funds, $9 million, were voted by Congress to help
all parties compete in the elections.
   ``Sandinista actions thus far are troubling but we continue to
remain hopeful that the desires of the Nicaraguan people for full
freedom will prevail,'' said the White House statement, which said
a free and fair election and fulfillment of other Nicaraguan
pledges ``offer the possibility for a stable peace in Nicaragua and
for improved relations with the United States.''
   At the same time, former President Jimmy Carter, who heads a
separate observer group, briefed members of the House and Senate on
his trips to Nicaragua and gave a largely optimistic report about
chances for free and fair elections.
   ``He feels pretty good about it,'' said Lugar, who attended one
of the briefings. Carter believes that so far, ``as a Central
American election goes, this one is probably in the ballpark,'' he
said.
   Carter also is inviting some members of the defunct presidential
observer group to join his team, Lugar said. He said he and Rep.
Anthony Beilenson, D-Ind., the co-chairman of the presidential
group, have declined to go.
   Carter told reporters he hoped that as many as 1,500
international observers would be deployed across Nicaragua at
election time to give as complete a picture as possible of how
fairly the voting is conducted.
   He acknowledged that ``there have been some serious problems,
most of which have been corrected,'' an apparent reference to
violence against opposition supporters early in the campaign season
and to alleged Sandinista foot-dragging in funneling U.S. aid to
the opposition.
   Lugar said he believed the denial of the visas was ``a foreign
policy blunder'' on Managua's part that squandered a chance to help
ease relations between Nicaragua and the United States.
   ``We have a problem back here however this election comes out,''
he said, predicting intense U.S. debate on how to forge a new
relationship with Nicaragua. ``This (election) is a pivotal event.''
   Congressional sources, speaking only on the condition of
anonymity, said the Sandinista government had signaled privately
that three people on the 20-name list were particularly
objectionable: Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., and Sens. John McCain,
R-Ariz., and Connie Mack, R-Fla., all strong supporters of the
anti-Sandinista Contra rebels.

   Police firing birdshot to break up a leftist
campaign march Wednesday slightly wounded presidential candidate
Henry Pease and three others, Pease said.
   Speaking in a radio interview after the incident, Pease said he
was leading a group of supporters of his United Left coalition on a
march through Lima's downtown when police opened fire with
anti-riot shotguns, water cannon and tear gas.
   Witnesses said the marchers tried to cross the Plaza de Armas,
the public square in front of the Government Palace, where
President Alan Garcia lives. The square has been closed off by
police for several months for security reasons as Peru combats a
rebel insurgency.
   Police detoured the marchers down a side street, where the
confrontation occurred.
   Pease said the group was walking ``without disturbing
transportation or anyone.''
   Pease, slightly wounded in the leg by birdshot pellets, was
treated at a local clinic and released. Also slightly wounded in
the incident were two congressional candidates and one of Pease's
bodyguards, Pease said.
   The United Left is a coalition of Marxist parties supporting
Pease in the April 8 presidential elections.
   Public opinion polls show writer Mario Vargas Llosa, candidate
of the center-right Democratic Front coalition, far ahead of other
candidates in the April 8 election.
   Trailing him are Alfonso Barrantes of the Socialist Left
coalition, Luis Alva Castro of the governing center-left Aprista
party, and Pease.
   Garcia is ineligible to run again.
   As part of his campaign Pease visits public markets to speak
with voters. Wednesday's march was intended to end at a popular
market a few blocks from the Government Palace.

<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on Wednesday
praised the Soviet Communist Party's vote to give up its monopoly
on power.
   ``Further than we could ever have thought five years ago,'' Mrs.
Thatcher said. ``A lot still to be done but a great decision, a
great decision.''
   Mrs. Thatcher spoke to reporters outside her 10 Downing St.
office standing alongside the Soviet Communist Party's ideology
chief, Vadim A. Medvedev, who arrived for a six-day visit.
   Medvedev, a member of the Soviet Politburo, flew into London
shortly after the vote in Moscow and said the decision ``opens up a
new page in perestroika.''
   During an hour of talks with the prime minister, Downing Street
officials said, he gave her a long and substantial message from
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev that marked increasingly
close relations between their nations.
   Medvedev heads a seven-member delegation invited by British
lawmakers.
   Perestroika is the term Gorbachev uses for his program of
restructuring the Soviet economy and society.
   Medvedev said perestroika in British-Soviet relations began when
Mrs. Thatcher and Gorbachev first met in 1984, a few months before
Gorbachev became Soviet leader in March 1985.
   ``We set the tone five or six years ago. We set it well.'' said
Mrs. Thatcher.

   AT&amp;T said Wednesday that researchers at its
Bell Laboratories have confirmed the existence of
``quasi-crystals,'' a new and much-debated form of matter that
could be used to improve electronic equipment.
   Scientists in university and private research say X-rays and
other techniques have already helped prove quasi-crystals exist,
but say Bell Labs' research gives the most straightforward
description of the matter.
   Discovered in 1984, quasi-crystals have been the focus of some
of the most intense study in the scientific community along with
superconductivity and cold fusion, say scientists familiar with the
subject.
   Researchers praised Bell Labs' announcement, but said it could
not be considered a breakthrough, as the company claimed.
   Paul Horn, director of physical science at International
Business Machine's Thomas J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown,
N.Y., called the development a ``nice piece of science.'' But he
said, ``It didn't tell us anything we didn't expect.''
   While research has revealed the presence of quasi-crystals in
bulk form, Bell Labs provided the first glimpse of a quasi-crystal
surface, helping refute arguments that previous manifestations were
a quirk of nature, said Lionel Kimmerling, who heads Bell Labs'
materials interface research department in Murray Hill west of
Newark.
   The company used a scanning-tunnelling miscroscope, which is
exact enough to probe individual atoms. Researchers cut atoms on a
plane and used the microscope to move a fine-tipped probe over the
surface. The image of each atom was then projected on a television
screen, said Kimmerling.
   ``It's the first time that people have used a
scanning-tunnelling microscope to get an image of the surface of
the material,'' Horn said. ``It confirms what people believed and
what people had very good evidence for ...''
   The three states of matter are solid, liquid and gas. The solid
state is divided into amorphous _ or unorganized _ solids, such as
glass, and crystal, which includes rocks and metals. The
quasi-crystal _ in this case composed of an alloy of aluminum,
cobalt and copper _ falls in between the two known categories of
solids.
   Bell Labs' finding was published in the Jan. 8 edition of
Physical Review Letters, the journal of the American Physical
Society.
   ``It's definitely in the revolutionary category,'' said
Kimmerling. ``Now we have a new material and we're anxious to find
out what it will do that substances not structured like this cannot
do.''
   The outlook for uses of quasi-crystals is mixed.
   AT&amp;T officials said the material used to make quasi-crystals is
durable, lightweight and can withstand a range of temperatures,
qualities valuable in making electrical fuses and resistors.
   But Kimmerling said any practical uses of the technology are
years away.
   ``I don't think we're ready at this point to say ... this is
where the technological impact is going to be,'' said Earle Ryba,
an associate professor of metallurgy at Penn State University.
   Bell Labs' research also shows quasi-crystals to have an
arrangement of atoms with a pentagon-shaped symmetry, which many
scientists doubted could happen. Perfect five-sided shapes could
not fit together without holes and breaks, but the quasi-crystal
shows pentagons of many shapes and sizes comprising the atoms, AT&amp;T
officials said.
   ``What they have done is provide more direct experimental proof
that this in fact happens,'' said Robert Metzger, a professor of
chemistry and a crystallographer at the University of Alabama in
Tuscaloosa, Ala.
   ``Beforehand, the experimental process used was a long-range
look at the pattern,'' Metzger said. ``Now they have confirmed it
in exact detail.''

   The judge in the assault trial of reputed mob
boss John Gotti interrupted jury deliberations Wednesday evening
amid reports the jurors were fighting among themselves.
   Acting Justice Edward McLaughlin dismissed the jury for the
night, ordering them to return Thursday.
   ``I ask you to continue to listen,'' McLaughlin said. ``You
haven't really been at it all that long.''
   The jury is deliberating assault and conspiracy charges against
Gotti, 49, and co-defendant Anthony Guerrieri, 61.
   They are charged with commissioning the Westies, an
Irish-American gang, to shoot John F. O'Connor, former vice
president of Carpenters Union Local 608, on May 7, 1986. He was
wounded in the buttocks and survived.
   Prosecutors claim Gotti, alleged boss of the Gambino crime
family, arranged the shooting because O'Connor ordered thugs to
trash Bankers and Brokers, a mob-run restaurant that was being
built with non-union labor.
   The judge addressed the jurors after they sent out a note about
6:30 p.m. indicating problems in their deliberations.
   ``I wouldn't know what's going on in there but questioning
somebody's lineage or intelligence is not the way to come to
grips'' with the problem, McLaughlin said.
   ``Jury service is a give and take, as gently as possible,'' the
judge said. ``It's not a contest to see who can get in the most
cutting, triumphant gibe at the end.''
   The jury's note, which the judge read from the bench, said, ``I
feel we have a juror who has brought a previous bias into this
room. Please advise. This juror has indicated he had some opinion
on guilt or innocence before the trial started.''
   Notes to the judge normally are sent out by the jury foreman but
the judge refused to say who had sent it out and who had signed it.
The note didn't contain any reference about anyone's lineage or
intelligence.
   The judge declined to answer reporters' questions about that,
but there was an indication that McLaughlin had heard the reference
about lineage and intelligence from another source.
   Earlier Wednesday, the judge refused a defense motion for a
mistrial based on a report that some jurors would agree to talk to
reporters at a news conference after the verdict, sources said.
   In asking for a mistrial, defense attorney Bruce Cutler said,
``We're concerned that they're more worried about becoming media
stars then in being jurors.''
   The case is based on secretly recorded tapes.
   They include conversations in which Gotti allegedly says,
``We're gonna, gonna bust him up,'' and another on which members of
the Westies gang allegedly say they shot O'Connor as a favor to
Gotti.
   The defense has ridiculed the tapes as inaudible and claims
prosecutors transcribed them to suit their theory that Gotti had
O'Connor shot.
   The prospect of a mistrial arose earlier when one of the 12
jurors was taken to a doctor at midday Wednesday, as jurors broke
for lunch. If that juror were too ill to continue, an alternate
could replace him or her only with the consent of the defense. The
defense almost certainly would object.
   If convicted, Gotti could face 25 years to life in prison as a
persistent felon because of convictions in 1969 and 1974.
   His attorneys contend Gotti is being persecuted because of his
reputation.
   The judge told the jury they could convict the defendants only
if the prosecution proved they arranged the shooting and not simply
because they might be members of organized crime.

   The government said Thursday the Communist Party
will not give up its leading role in society, and that the nation
would descend into chaos without the party in control.
   The strongly worded editorial in the party's official People's
Daily came a day after the Soviet Communist Party voted to end its
constitutional guarantee of power.
   The People's Daily editorial was a rejoinder to events in the
socialist world, although it made no mention of the Soviet Union or
East Europe, where the communist parties of other nations already
have allowed multiparty politics.
   Instead, it attacked Western democracies as being playthings of
the rich.
   China's conservative leaders have suppressed all dissent and
criticism of the Communist Party since calling in the military to
crush the student-led democracy movement in June.
   Leaders reportedly are deeply concerned that events in Eastern
Europe and the Soviet Union could rejuvenate popular opposition to
the government.
   The commentary was pegged to a party document made public
Wednesday that urged the party to pay greater attention to the
opinions of eight tiny and tame ``democracy parties'' allowed to
exist after the Communist takeover in 1949.
   The main thrust, however, was that a Western-style multiparty
system can never be accepted in China, and the Communist Party will
always have a constitutionally guaranteed right to lead the nation.
   ``In China, without the strong leadership of the Communist
Party, new turmoil and wars would surely arise, the nation would be
split, and the people, not to mention state construction, would
suffer again,'' the editorial said.
   It said party rule was ``endorsed and supported by the whole
nation rather than proclaimed'' by the party.
   The ``elite'' who stirred up the ``counterrevolutionary
rebellion'' _ the official term for the student-led pro-democracy
movement _ sought to deprive the party of its leading role, it said.
   ``Some people always think that the parliamentary democracy in
the West is advantageous,'' the editorial said.
   But it said Western democracies were controlled by the rich and
``the broad masses of working people have never had the right to
take part in the administration of state affairs. ... Those who
have more money will have more freedom and have more right to talk
in the democracy. Such democracy means nothing to those who do not
have enough to eat.''
   The editorial called on the party leadership to study the
document released Wednesday, which said China's small political
parties and non-communists should get more legislative and
bureaucratic positions and have a voice in policy-making.
   The party has always stressed the consultative role of its
``united front'' _ the small parties, mass organizations, the army
and regional groups. But the Communists have all leadership
positions and absolute decision-making power.
   The eight small parties have about 300,000 members, most of whom
are leftist intellectuals from pre-1949 days _ many now in their
80s.
   The Communist Party has 48 million members.
   All of the small parties pledge allegiance to Communist Party
rule, and in the past four decades no new parties have been
recognized.

   President Bush said Wednesday he believed a
reunified Germany could remain part of NATO _ perhaps a NATO
somewhat different from today's alliance.
   ``I think it can be managed in such a way that it will not bea
threat to Western Europe or the free world,'' Bush told the San
Francisco Commonwealth Club.
   Meanwhile, Bush invited Manfred Woerner, secretary general of
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and West German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl to meet with him separately on the reunification issue.
   Woerner will visit Bush at the presidential retreat at Camp
David, Md., this weekend, White House aides said.
   Kohl will confer at Camp David later this month with Bush, the
White House announced.
   Bush told his audience that when he heard both Kohl and West
German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher ``talking about a
Germany that remains tied in to NATO in some way _ maybe not the
NATO in exactly the same form it is _ but that's encouraging,''
Bush said.
   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater afterward said in
an elaborating statement that Bush ``meant that Germany would
remain as a member of NATO, but NATO may have a changing mission.''
   The changing mission would involve ``an increased political role
for NATO,'' Fitzwater said.
   Apparently worried that Bush's words might be used by advocates
of a unified Germany outside the western alliance, top officials
hastened to reinforce Fitzwater's footnote during the president's
flight to Omaha, Neb. on Air Force One.
   National security adviser Brent Scowcroft told reporters on the
plane, ``The president said something which could be interpreted as
being ambiguous about Germany remaining a part of NATO. Both
Chancellor Kohl and Foreign Minister Genscher have said a
reunififed Germany ought to be a part of NATO. We strongly support
that view.''
   With White House chief of staff John Sununu at his elbow,
Scowcroft added that the role of the western military alliance may
change. He said ``if the security situation continues to change in
Europe then NATO may take on more of a political character,''
leaving unspoken the notion that the military character of NATO
would be less.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III is now in Moscow,
reportedly carrying the outline of an allied plan on German
reunification.
   One of the major stumbling blocks to union of the two Germanys
is Western insistence that Germany stay in the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization, the alliance forged after World War II to
defend against attack from the communist East Bloc. The Soviets and
its allied states formed the Warsaw Pact in response, but now that
military pact appears to be disintegrating.
   The White House, in a statement, said the Feb. 24-25 visit by
Kohl ``will provide an opportunity for the president and the
chancellor to exchange views about prospects for German
reunification, East-West relations, possibilities for further
progress in arms control, objectives for the Conference on Security
and Cooperation in Europe ... assistance to the emerging
democracies of Eastern Europe and U.S. relations with the European
community.''
   East German Prime Minister Hans Modrow has called for a unified
Germany that would be neutral, siding with neither NATO nor the
Warsaw Pact. Genscher has floated the idea of united Germany in
NATO, with NATO troops barred from what is now East Germany _ where
Soviet troops might remain for a time.
   Baker reportedly was told by Vaclav Havel, the new president of
Czechoslovakia, during a visit to Prague Tuesday thatGerman
neutrality was out of the question.
   Bush administration officials have suggested lately that the
United States might accept a reunified Germany with ``ties'' to
NATO, but not formal membership.

   Florida's former chief tax collector
was charged Wednesday with falsifying records, one day after she
resigned amid allegations she singled out a political opponent of
her husband's for an audit.
   Katie Tucker was charged with one count of official misconduct
for falsifying records, a felony that carries a maximum penalty of
five years in prison and a $5,000 fine, said Florida Department of
Law Enforcement spokesman Mike McHargue.
   ``I've done no wrongdoing,'' Ms. Tucker said after she
surrendered to authorities and was released on her own
recognizance. ``I wish they'd just let me get on with my life.''
   Ms. Tucker, 46, had headed the Department of Revenue since June
1988.
   She resigned her position Tuesday, two weeks after being
suspended for ordering a 1988 tax probe of a political opponent of
her husband, AFL-CIO state president Daniel Miller.
   Ms. Tucker contended the tax probe was intended to be part of a
larger investigation, and was not meant to single out the
businessman.
   According to an affidavit, Ms. Tucker produced a memo dated Dec.
21, 1988, to support her case. Authorities allege that Ms. Tucker
probably wrote the memo during a night visit to her office on Jan.
31. Much of the evidence was found on a cartridge ribbon from a
typewriter, according to the Department of Law Enforcement.

   Twenty gallons of heavy water spilled at the
Savannah River nuclear weapons plant Wednesday, sending a plume of
radioactive tritium into the air, but there was no threat to
workers or area residents, officials said.
   Two workers at the Savannah River Site who were splashed with
the water received small doses of radidation, about the equivalent
of half a chest X-ray, officials said.
   Crews were unable to detect radioactivity at the plant or along
its boundaries, said Dennis Stevenson, manager of health protection
operations for Westinghouse Savannah River Co., which operates the
plant for the U.S. Department of Energy.
   Tritium is a highly radioactive gas used in the production of
nuclear warheads and is manufactured only at the Savannah River
plant.
   The spill occurred at 12:05 a.m. while two workers were
replacing a flange, or connecting joint, on water pipes to heat
exchangers on the K Reactor, one of three reactors at SRS shut down
for safety modifications in 1988.
   About five gallons of water runoff is expected when replacing a
flange, and officials said they were uncertain why 20 gallons was
in the pipe.
   Operations at the plant were back to normal less than eight
hours after the spill, and clean-up was expected to be completed by
the end of the day, said John Patterson, deputy director of
DOE-Savannah River Reactor Restart Special Projects Office.
   The spill was first declared an alert at 2:20 a.m. but was
downgraded to an unusual event at 5:41 a.m., the DOE said. An
unusual event is the lowest of four nuclear emergency classes.
   As the area where the spill occurred was ventilated through the
reactor stack, monitoring equipment detected the tritium release,
which triggered the alert, said Charles Peckinpaugh, deputy general
manager of reactor operations
   A small amount of tritium, 825 curies, was released into the
atmosphere, Stevenson said.
   Based on weather conditions, the projected radiation dose at the
plant boundary was .003 millirem, ``about one-one-thousandth of the
dose you would get from natural background radiation,'' he said.
   One worker was exposed to 10 millirem of radiation, the
equivalent of half the radiation emitted during a normal chest
X-ray, officials said. They said the second worker received about
the same amount of radiation but had no figures.
   About 100 other employees were in the reactor at the time, but
were not evacuated, officials said.
   Patterson said Westinghouse and DOE would conduct a joint
investigation of the incident.
   The K reactor is expected to be the first of the plant's three
reactors to be restarted once safety modifications are completed,
possibly before the end of the year.

   Rock star Billy Idol, who suffered a severely
broken leg and a broken arm in a motorcycle accident, was moved
Wednesday from intensive care to his own room as fans flooded the
hospital with flowers and phone calls.
   ``He's alert, he's talking, but he's still listed as serious but
stable,'' said Idol's publicist, Ellen Golden.
   Idol, 34, was recovering from seven hours of surgery for
compound fractures to the right leg and a broken right forearm
suffered when his Harley-Davidson motorcycle and a car crashed
Tuesday morning.
   The switchboard at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center received more
than 100 calls from fans asking where to send flowers and gifts,
and flowers have already started arriving, said spokesman Ron Wise.
   Idol, who had just wrapped up an album called ``Charmed Life,''
was driving home from a Hollywood recording studio when he ran a
stop sign and sideswiped a car, police said. The car's driver was
not injured.
   It was not clear whether the accident would affect Idol's plans
to release ``Charmed Life'' in late April and launch a concert tour
in July, Golden said.
   Idol, known for his sneer and spiked blond hair, reached stardom
with his 1984 album ``Rebel Yell,'' which produced hit songs
including the title track, ``Eyes Without a Face'' and ``White
Wedding.''

   The Communist Party that for decades swore its red
tide would cover the globe bowed to a very different revolution
Wednesday, agreeing to let alternative political parties compete
for control of the Soviet Union.
   That amounts to an acknowledgement that new political forces
have taken root and no longer is possible or desirable to stamp
them out with past tactics of repression that ranged from mass
murder under Josef Stalin to the arrests and imprisonment preferred
by Leonid I. Brezhnev.
   ``The party does not assume full government authority,'' Vice
President Anatoly I. Lukyanov told a news conference, reading from
notes on the final wording adopted by the party Central Committee.
   ``Its role is to be a political leader with no particular role
to be included in the constitution,'' he said. The party will
propose repeal of Article 6, which guarantees the Communists a
monopoly of power.
   ``There will be a multiparty system; there will be a normal
democracy,'' Svyatoslav Fyodorov, a noted eye surgeon and a
participant, said in an interview on Red Square during a break in
the closed meeting. He called the move ``fantastic.''
   The nearly unanimous vote on the new party platform was a
triumph of political maneuvering for President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev. He packed the meeting of the 249-member committee with
more than 700 other officials, many of them progressives who took
the floor to demand radical reform.
   In two votes, first by the Central Committee and then by all
present, only dissident Communist Boris N. Yeltsin voted against
the platform, which a Central Committee source said also calls for
direct election of the president.
   Yeltsin, who addressed a huge crowd Sunday that marched to the
Kremlin to demand reform, favored an even more radical program that
demanded a virtual apology by the party for decades of totalitarian
rule.
   Gorbachev has struggled nearly five years to transform the
Soviet Union into something resembling a modern democracy. He
dropped his long-standing public opposition to alternative
political parties only three weeks ago in Lithuania, so it was a
surprise when he proposed Monday that the policy be put into law.
   Asked if Gorbachev got his way, Brent Scowcroft, President
Bush's national security adviser, said in Washington, ``Well it
seems that way. The outcome (is) pretty much based on the proposals
that Gorbachev introduced in the Central Committee.''
   Gorbachev's close Politburo ally, Alexander N. Yakovlev, said at
the news conference Wednesday the move had been under consideration
for some time.
   ``You don't really need much acumen to realize that if we are
venturing on the path of democratization of the country, it is
bound to affect all socio-political movements,'' Yakovlev said.
   ``If we were to say in 1985: Come on folks, go ahead and set up
154 parties, I can imagine the mess it would have brought about,''
he said.
   Yakovlev said the Soviet leaders had to reckon with their
nation's history, including its democratic and anti-democratic
cultures.
   Unlike Eastern Europe, where alternative political groups have
existed for years and quickly became genuine opposition parties,
the Soviet Union has no national alternative to the Communists. The
party also has great financial resources and controls much of the
press.
   Because of those factors, voters are unlikely to oust the
Communists from their actual power monopoly immediately, except in
regions like the Baltic republics that have strong local political
movements.
   Constitutional changes must be approved by the Supreme Soviet
legislature, which convenes next Wednesday, and the larger Congress
of People's Deputies. The Congress is to meet in the spring, but
could be called into special session.
   At its last meeting in December, the Congress heeded Gorbachev's
plea for delay and blocked an effort by reformers to repeal Article
6 of the constitution.
   The Soviet Union already is in the midst of campaigning for
local and regional elections spread over the next three months, and
the Central Committee decision could cause a frenzy of organizing.
   ``We Communists are not going to surrender our positions. Just
as any party in the world, we shall be waging a struggle for our
rights,'' Politburo member Vitaly I. Vorotnikov told visiting
Brazilian legislators, the official news agency Tass reported.
   Yakovlov said: ``This does not mean the political situation is
out of control. This does not mean that we cannot lead the people.''
   Instead, he said, it puts the party back in front, leading the
way to democratic reform.
   He acknowledged the Central Committee argument was stormy, but
said the final version was essentially Gorbachev's.
   ``A large portion'' wanted to retain Article 6 and others
favored barring certain kinds of parties, he said. Yakovlev said
the final platform called for banning only groups that condone
ethnic strife or violent overthrow of the government.
   The Central Committee also decided to advance the date of the
next party congress from October to the end of June.
   For the first time, delegates will be elected by the nation's 20
million Communists, not chosen by the leadership.
   Yakovlev said the congress would elect a new Central Committee
and could either choose the party leader, now Gorbachev, or let the
rank-and-file do so.
   Reformers see the committee as the bastion of conservatives wary
of Gorbachev's program. The congress would give Gorbachev another
chance to alter the committee.
   Pavel Zinoviev, party chief for the Kamchatka Peninsula in the
Soviet Far East, said the committee recognized a small loyalist
faction of Lithuanian Communists as the true party in the Baltic
republic.
   He told reporters the Central Committee appealed to a larger
group of Lithuanian Communists who declared themselves independent
to return to the fold before the Congress, implying they could not
send delegates otherwise.
   Officials at the news conference indicated the platform made no
change in the party's opposition to private land ownership.

   A brawl broke out during a live television debate
between a Jewish leader and a member of an extreme right-wing
organization, and the scene was rebroadcast repeatedly Wednesday.
   The fight, which interrupted the weekly ``Ciel Mon Mardi''
public affairs program Tuesday, began when a spectator clambered
onstage and slugged Olivier Mathieu of the right-wing National
French and European Party.
   Mathieu had been debating the state of the far-right in France
with Jewish leader Jean-Pierre Pierre-Bloch, president of Licra,
the French acronym for the League Against Anti-Semitism and Racism.
   After Mathieu was attacked, a free-for-all broke out among other
spectators and participants for about two minutes before host
Christophe Dechavanne reimposed order.
   Mathieu left the stage and the debate continued on the show,
which is broadcast over national network TF-1.

<HEAD>New Honduran President Says No Permanent U.S. Bases</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Rafael Leonardo Callejas
on Wednesday described relations with Washington as ``excellent''
but said he will not allow the United States to have a permanent
base in Honduras.
   The United States has conducted joint military maneuvers with
Honduras since 1954 and has stationed 1,200 men at Palmerola air
base since 1984 on a rotating basis but has no permanent
installation.
   ``The position of my government is very clear. We are not
willing to establish permanent U.S. military bases in our
territory,'' Callejas said at a news conference.
   Callejas, who took office Jan. 27 after winning elections in
November, emphasized: ``All of this is framed in the Honduran
government's foreign policy.''
   For two years, Washington has been pressuring Honduras to sign
an agreement that would allow improvements at Palmerola, 50 miles
northeast of Tegucigalpa.
   ``We will not negotiate with the United States about installing
permanent bases,'' Callejas said. ``Military maneuvers between the
United States and Honduras have a temporary, not permanent,
character.''
   The United States and Honduras have had joint military maneuvers
for 26 years. Since then, more than 100,000 U.S. soldiers have
participated in 80 maneuvers with the Honduran army's 22,000 men.
   ``These operations serve to improve the defensive capacity of
our army and our national security,'' Callejas said. ``Relations
between the United States and Honduras remain unchanged and
excellent.''
   During the campaign last year both Callejas and the candidate of
the governing Liberal Party, Carlos Flores, were U.S.-trained
engineers with relatively conservative economic views and pro-U.S.
foreign policies but opposed to making Palmerola a permanent U.S.
base.

<HEAD>Pinochet to Remain Army Chief `As Long As Necessary'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Augusto Pinochet said Wednesday
he will remain as army commander ``as long as necessary'' after
relinquishing the presidency next month because of the threat of
the ``Marxist germ.''
   Pinochet told a group of women in Iquique, 1,150 miles north of
the capital, that the danger of Marxism has diminished as a result
of the democratic changes in eastern Europe.
   But, he added, ``We still have to be careful, because this
threat can persist. The Marxist germ is the danger, and women must
always be alert.''
   Pinochet is in Iquique as part of a nationwide farewell tour he
organized under the motto, ``Mission accomplished.''
   He told the women that some leftist exiles who have recently
returned from exile are planning to kill him.
   ``They have returned with hatred, and I understand that,'' he
said. ``They want to kill me, and I also understand that. They say
they have sentenced me. I thank them for the information, but I
know things are like that, and I am not afraid.''
   Pinochet survived an assasination attempt in September 1986, but
six of his bodyguards were killed.
   Several leftist guerrillas who participated in that attack
escaped from a Santiago prison last week and one, Victor Diaz Caro,
sent a recorded tape to local newspapers saying ``the death
sentence of Pinochet is still pending.''
   Pinochet, who seized power in a 1973 coup that toppled elected
Marxist President Salvador Allende, is scheduled to relinquish the
presidency on March 11 to Patricio Aylwin, a centrist leader who
won a landslide election victory in December.
   Pinochet was obliged to call the election after losing a
referendum in October 1988 on a military proposal to extend his
rule until 1997.
   The 74-year-old general called the 1973 coup ``not only a
national victory, but a world victory. We were the first ones to
defeat Marxism, and we now see that our desires and aspirations are
the same desires and aspirations of the (Eastern) European peoples,
who are throwing away the Communist yoke.''
   The 1980 constitution written by his military regime allows
Pinochet to remain as head of the powerful 65,000-men army for
eight more years after stepping down from the presidency.
   He has vowed to stay, dismissing a plea by Aylwin to retire.
   In a face-to-face meeting last December, Aylwin told Pinochet
his continuation as army chief would be ``inconvenient, both for
the army and for the country.''
   Pinochet replied that, as head of the army, he would be ``the
best guarantee for the stability'' of the Aylwin government.
   ``I`m going to continue always to your service, until the end of
my days, as long as I can,'' Pinochet told the women in Iquique.
   Pinochet said he may soon move his residence, and probably the
army command headquarters, to Iquique, and establish the first army
corps.

   A federal jury on Wednesday convicted
a Florida attorney in the 1988 disappearance of a Jackson
multimillionaire's wife.
   The jury found Newton Alfred Winn, 65, guilty of one count each
of conspiracy to kidnap, extortion and perjury around 6 p.m. after
about 3{ of deliberations.
   Winn sat impassively as the jurors were polled.
   In closing arguments earlier in the day, the prosecution said
the St. Petersburg, Fla., attorney blamed his financial woes on
Annie Laurie Hearin's husband.
   ``He had a motivation of revenge,'' Assistant U.S. Attorney
Patricia Bennett said after telling jurors jury how and why the
government claimed Winn abducted the woman on July 26, 1988.
   Defense attorneys said the government has the wrong man. John
Collette, one of Winn's attorneys, said an appeal was likely.
   Winn is accused of conspiracy in having a ransom letter mailed
from Atlanta on Aug. 11, 1988. He also is charged with extortion
and lying to a federal grand jury about his knowledge of the case.
No one has been charged with actually abducting Mrs. Hearin.
   The 74-year-old Mrs. Hearin, wife of Robert Hearin, hasn't been
seen since she disappeared from her Jackson home following a bridge
party with friends. Doctors have said the woman had a health
problem that required daily medication.
   After the verdict was read, the woman's son, Robert Hearin Jr.
said the family had been informed that the search for Mrs. Hearin
was still active.
   ``The investigation into whatever happened to my mother is
continuing, and on that basis, I am pleased with the result reached
today.''
   U.S. District Judge Tom S. Lee gave final instructions to the
jurors, explaining each of the three counts of the indictment
against Winn.
   On hand for instructions and final arguments were two key
government witnesses: Don Ward, who once worked for Winn; and
Marilyn Taylor, who describes herself as a one-time lover of the
defendant and who has testified that she mailed a letter which
prosecutors say was a ransom note.
   A splattering of blood was found on the front door of the Hearin
home along with another ransom note demanding that Hearin reimburse
12 individuals, including Winn, for losses they suffered in
dealings with School Pictures of Mississippi Inc., a firm in which
Winn was once a primary stockholder.
   Winn ``blamed Mr. Hearin for all of his problems with School
Pictures,'' Bennett said.
   ``This case is about the kidnapping of Annie Laurie Hearin,''
Bennett said. ``This case is about this defendant conspiring to
kidnap her. This case is about this defendant causing a letter to
be mailed from Atlanta for the return of Mrs. Hearin. This case is
about this defendant. . . lying under oath.''
   Defense Attorney Ed Marger, describing the case as having a
``Perry Mason scenario,'' charged that the government based its
case on questionable witnesses and physical evidence that
prosecutors later attempted to downplay.
   During seven days of testimony, jurors were treated to a soap
opera-style plot that included a two-state love affair between
Winn, 65, and Taylor, 29, of De Land, Fla. Taylor testified she
disguised herself and mailed the ransom note, and said she and Winn
once plotted to kill her former husband, Mark Phillips.
   In his closing arguments, Marger repeatedly attacked the
credibility of Taylor, who testified after receiving immunity from
prosecution.
   He also said tapes of converstions between Winn and Taylor made
by the FBI and introduced into the trial revealed nothing other
than the defendant saying such things as, ``I don't know what you
are talking about.''
   Marger said: ``The truth is what this case is all about, but so
is proof.''

   Congressional Democrats are raising images of
democratic reforms in Eastern Europe and the U.S. civil rights
movement to pressure President Bush into backing a House-passed
bill easing voter registration.
   Over the objections of the White House and some other top
Republicans, the House approved the legislation 289-132 on Tuesday
and sent the measure to the Senate. Sixty-one of the chamber's 175
Republicans broke with party leaders to vote for the proposal.
   The so-called motor voter bill requires states to include voting
registration forms with drivers' license applications and to
establish procedures to sign up voters by mail and at numerous
government offices. It would take effect in January 1993.
   States would have to search voting lists at least once every
four years for people who have moved or have registered
fraudulently. The federal government would provide up to $50
million to help states pay for the new procedures.

   U.S. District Court Judge Paul Rosenblatt threw out the law on

   ``I am happy the courts ruled it unconstitutional,'' Mrs.

   Backers of the measure said the Democratic governor should

   The former president of the Southern Baptist
Woman's Missionary Union has endorsed a moderate candidate for the
denomination's presidency and said she's willing to run as his vice
president.
   Carolyn Weatherford Crumpler, who for 15 years headed the WCTU
until last year, endorsed the Rev. Daniel Vestal for the top post
from the pulpit of his church in suburban Dunwoody, and said she
was ready to run with him.
   Fundamentalists have won the presidency of the 14.8
million-member denomination for the past decade, achieving
majorities among trustees of the denomination's institutions and
agencies.
   Mrs. Crumpler, married last summer to a Cincinnati pastor after
she left leadership of the women's organization, said she is
concerned because a ``takeover'' group has muzzled denominational
executives and the denomination's news agency, Baptist Press.
   Vestal, who narrowly lost the presidency last year to the
fundamentalist incumbent, the Rev. Jerry Vines, said he had asked
Mrs. Crumpler to work with him and seek the vice presidency to
bring reconciliation to the faction-torn denomination.
   Its annual convention comes this June in New Orleans.

   Several Roman Catholic scholars have
criticized a Vatican-issued draft of a proposed universal catechism
that has been distributed to bishops for their reactions.
   Following a symposium, the scholars told a news conference there
were serious deficiencies in the document, particuarly in failing
to make distinctions between essential truths of faith and
peripheral elements.
   The 430-page document is intended as a comprehensive summary of
Catholic beliefs.
   Lawrence Cunningham, a theology professor at the University of
Notre Dame, said one of the document's ``most glaring weaknesses''
is that it ``suffers from what computer people would call an
`information overload''' lacking guidance on ``what's more
important and what's less important.''
   Bishops are supposed to submit responses by May 31. Bishop
Rayumond F. Lucker of New Ulm, Minn., who participated in the
symposium, said, ``I'm hoping there will be substantial changes.''

<HEAD>Protestants Credit Mom For Faith But It's Found Limited</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>

   Ask 10,000 people what or who had the most
positive influence on their religious faith, and the most likely
answer for every age group, men and women, boys and girls, is ``my
mother.''
   That _ which traditional sentiment always has assumed _ is among
the findings of one of the largest, most comprehensive studies ever
made of faith and its development among Americans.
   A full report of the 3{-year study won't be disclosed until a
national conference March 24-27 in St. Louis, but some of its
conclusions are being circulated and discussed.
   While it turned up numerous previously indicated conditions,
some of them, when laid out in hard, overwhelming statistics, come
as a bit of a shocker.
   One of these is that only a third of U.S. Protestants have what
is termed an ``integrated faith'' that embraces both basic beliefs
and their practical implications in life.
   Another somewhat surprising conclusion is that what matters most
in building mature faith is not the commonly emphasized classes for
the young _ important as they are _ but adult Christian education.
   Further, this most important stage of learning is found to be
widely neglected in the churches.
   The huge, landmark study, involving completion of 374-question
questionnaires by 10,000 church people bringing out information
never available before about beliefs and values, was made by the
Search Institute of Minneapolis.
   It was sponsored by six mainline Protestant denominations
through a grant from the Lilly Endowment, Inc.
   Titled ``Effective Christian Education: A National Study of
Protestant Congregations,'' the project also probed the methods,
programs and activities of congregations in conducting educational
work.
   In addition, trained observers visited 54 congregations with
exceptionally strong educational programs to examine and describe
the techniques that are getting results.
   Peter Benson, president of the institute that made the study,
said it found ``that faith is not particulary well-developed'' in
many church members, and programs to develop it are ``less than
effective.''
   ``Unless this issue is faced head-on in the early '90s, members
will increasingly drop away or seek spiritual nurture elsewhere,''
he writes in The Lutheran, organ of the Evangelical Lutheran Church
in America.
   It and other denominations involved in the study have been
declining in membership for about 20 years.
   The others are the United Methodist Church, Presbyterian Church
(U.S.A.), United Church of Christ, Episcopal Church and Christian
Church (Disciples of Christ).
   In the study, faith was examined in two basic dimensions, one
called ``vertical,'' involving personal relationship to God, and
the other ``horizontal,'' involving active commitment to social
service and justice.
   About a third of church members scored low on both dimensions,
reflecting an ``undeveloped faith'' both in belief and in
translating it into action.
   Another third showed a one-dimensional faith, usually holding
firm beliefs but not seeking much application in life.
   Only a third were found to have a balance of both dimensions, a
mature ``integrated faith.''
   ``There is evidence of great hesitance to connect one's faith to
one's community, work or politics,'' writes Benson. ``Combine this
with the reluctance to talk about one's faith and it seems that
many adults hold a private faith.
   ``They are unsure how to go public in words or actions.
   ``For many, faith lies dormant, waiting for nudges,
inspirations, revelations and personal experiences to help it
develop. It is private and quiet, more in the head than the heart
and hands and feet, uncomfortable in its dormancy but afraid to let
go.''
   Despite the two-thirds found with one-dimensional or undeveloped
faith, the study found that the proportion of those with a mature,
integrated faith increases with age, from youth onward.
   Also women were found to have a higher faith level than men.
   The study also found that growth in mature faith depended not so
much on the warmth and friendliness of a congregation, but on the
degree to which it challenges thinking and encourages questions.
   Of such stimulating programs, Benson writes:
   ``Members are challenged to think, discuss, debate and even
argue about the stuff of faith, including values, theological
issues, politics and Scripture. There is active intellectual
engagement.''
   Benson and Carolyn H. Eklin, the institute's director of survey
services, said one reason church members rarely named Christian
education as significantly influencing them is they've had so
little of it.
   In a year's time, adults average a total of no more than 11 to
20 hours in Christian educational efforts.
   Consequently, it scarcely got a mention when people were asked
to choose, among 30 potential influences, the five with the most
postive impact on their faith.
   Below the top-ranked ``my mother,'' men ranked their spouse,
father, pastor and worship services, while women listed God's
presence, worship, prayer, and last, their father.

   Tucked away in President Bush's budget there's
a proposal that would give the White House power to trim and tailor
federal spending and tax bills with itemized vetoes. It isn't going
to happen.
   But it revives a handy,standby issue for the Republican
administration. Bush and Ronald Reagan have been campaigning for
years for changes in the way the government decides how much to
spend and how to spend it.
   ``Earlier in our history there was an unwritten law that the
annual budget should be balanced except in time of war or
depression,'' according to the new Bush administration budget.
``That law is no longer honored, and only a change in the
Constitution is likely to assure a return to habitually balanced
budgets.''
   Bush wants a balanced budget amendment and another to give
presidents the power to veto specific items in an appropriations
bill without rejecting the whole bill. His budget says that also
should apply to bills that authorize federal programs with
automatic spending provisions.
   And he wants presidents to have the same authority over revenue
measures, which means tax bills.
   All of that would change the balance of legislative power. Item
vetoes could be overridden by two-thirds votes in both houses of
Congress. But a congressional majority could no longer force a
president to accept something he doesn't want in order to get
things he seeks. That's the kind of forced compromise that goes on
every session, and it may indeed be one of the reasons the federal
budget has been balanced only once in the past 30 years. But it
also would cede powers that no Congress is likely to yield to the
executive branch. That goes double for a Democratic Congress in the
era of Republican presidencies.
   ``The president, as representative of the general interest,
should have the power to strike from legislation provisions that
reflect only narrow local or special interests,'' the
administration argues. The Democrats aren't about to accept the
premise that the president represents the national interest while
Congress caters to parochial, special interests.
   Not that it isn't true at times. But so is the reverse. And the
debate about which are special and which are national interests is
part of the political process.
   Forty-three state governors have the line-item veto power Bush
wants bestowed on presidents. But state laws vary, and most of them
provide ways to settle differences on veto targets through
reconsideration and compromise.
   The White House said last fall that Bush might try to exercise
the power without a change in the law or the Constitution, just to
see if it would work. Democrats replied that they would challenge
any such action in court.
   The Supreme Court never has addressed the question directly, but
it did rule in 1975 that Richard M. Nixon had exceeded his
authority when he refused to spend funds Congress had appropriated
for state water pollution projects.
   The Bush budget seems to concede that it can't be done under
current law, saying that ``the time has come to amend the
Constitution and achieve this change.''
   The balanced budget amendment doesn't quite match its name; the
version the administration pushed during the Reagan years would
make deficits more difficult, but would not necessarily end them.
It would require three-fifths votes of both House and Senate to
approve deficit spending except in time of war.
   Reagan made the balanced budget amendment a major, repeating
issue during his two terms while federal deficits were soaring.
   The Senate approved it once, and came close a second time, both
while Republicans held the control they lost in the 1986 elections.
Reagan never could get it to a House vote.
   Bush advocates a balanced budget amendment with a built-in
renewal of his central campaign pledge: ``It should include
safeguards against achieving the balance through higher taxes.''
   Forty-nine states require balanced budgets; Vermont is the lone
exception. The requirement is written into 42 state constitutions;
the rest have balanced budget laws. State rules and enforcement
provisions vary widely.
   In a study published by the conservative Heritage Foundation,
budget analyst Stephen Moore says the federal government should
enact state-style spending and deficit restraints because the
states have demonstrated that they can work.
   A 1985 law requires automatic spending cuts if the government
fails to meet deficit reduction goals, but both Congress and the
administration have used loopholes and gimmicks to meet the target
estimates. And actual deficits have exceeded the limits every year
anyhow.
   Nevertheless, Moore said, that law has helped restrain deficits,
and the other measures would serve the same purpose.
   ``The federal budget process suffers from too little discipline,
not too much,'' he said.

<HEAD>Move Over, Flintstones, ``The Simpsons'' Have Arrived</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SCOTT WILLIAMS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``The Simpsons,'' five pop-eyed suburbanites
with funny overbites and bad hair, could become America's favorite
TV family _ and the biggest prime-time cartoon hit _ since ``The
Flintstones.''
   ``Unquestionably, Fox has a hit of the first magnitude,'' said
David Marans, media research chief for J. Walter Thompson
advertising. It even could outshine Fox's other hit, ``Married .. .
with Children,'' he said.
   The Fox Broadcasting cartoon series, shown on Sunday nights, is,
as the Monty Python gang used to say, something completely
different.
   Homer Simpson is an accident-prone supervisor at the local
nuclear power plant, Martha is his unenlightened hausfrau, Lisa is
a Good Little Girl, Bart is a pre-teen rebel and Maggie, well,
Maggie sucks on her pacifier.
   They bear no resemblance to those Stone Age suburbanites Fred
and Wilma Flintstone, who came to prime time in 1960 from
Hanna-Barbera Productions and stayed for six years, then lived on
through syndication.
   The Simpsons blunder through a surreal suburbia with a vague
sense that Something is Wrong in the Republic, a key theme of their
creator, ``Life in Hell'' cartoonist Matt Groening (rhymes with
``complaining,'' as he has noted).
   Not everyone is comfortable with its satire of American culture,
but it's well-animated, with colors that glow and dazzle, and the
cutting humor underlines a basic affection for things Simpsonian.
It is clever writing.
   It's also clever programming, said Betsy Frank, a senior media
analyst for the giant Saatchi and Saatchi advertising conglomerate,
because it appeals to the young, hip audience that Fox so very much
wants to attract.
   Ms. Frank said Fox deserves its reputation for taking risks with
``The Simpsons'' and other unconventional programs.
   ``Granted, they had not a lot to lose,'' she said, ``but this is
certainly a risk that's paid off for them.''
   ``The Simpsons'' began Dec. 11 as the No. 1 show in its early
prime-time Sunday slot in the key demographic groups of adults 18
to 49, teen-age boys and girls, and children, said Fox
Entertainment Group president Peter Chernin.
   ``The only thing it wasn't No. 1 in was adults 55 and over,''
Chernin said. ``I think this looks like a big hit show.''
   The show's Christmas special helped lead Fox to its
highest-rated Sunday evening. On Feb. 4, ``The Simpsons'' beat
competing ABC and NBC sitcoms in its time period, finishing a
distant second to CBS' ``Murder, She Wrote,'' which is aimed at
older viewers.
   ```The Simpsons' has done better among men 18 to 49 than such
notable hits as `Golden Girls,' Bill Cosby, `L.A. Law' and `60
Minutes,''' Marans said. ``What's really impressive about this is
that Fox isn't available in about 12 percent of the country.''
   ``I don't think we expected to do quite this well,'' Chernin
said.
   Indeed, it's heady stuff for a company that, as he put it, ``had
trouble premiering a show to a 10 share,'' 10 percent of the
audience in a given time period.
   Running against the Jan. 28 Super Bowl blowout, ``The Simpsons''
had a 17 share, and it consistently has placed in the high teens or
low 20s. ``I would be thrilled if it keeps at the same level,''
Chernin said.
   ``The Simpsons'' began life as ``bumpers,'' brief segments that
cushioned the commercials, on ``The Tracey Ullmann Show,'' but it
was announced last March that the cartoon family would venture out
on its own.
   John Rohr, a programming consultant for Blair Television, which
represents 145 television stations, said it's too early to tell
whether ``The Simpsons'' is a hit. ``I think that it's still being
sampled,'' he said.
   ``I am encouraged by the numbers,'' Rohr said. ``Certainly you
feel a lot better seeing big numbers early on than you do by seeing
small numbers.''
   Several major animation houses _ most notably the Disney Studios
and Hanna-Barbera _ have prime-time animation projects in the
works, but are not discussing them.
   ``When a program is extremely innovative, you run the risk that
it's going to peak,'' Ms. Frank said, citing ``Miami Vice,'' the
pastel-hued police drama that built an audience in its first two
seasons, then steadily declined.
   ``As long as the writing stays good,'' she said, ``I can't see
why it wouldn't perform like any good situation comedy, because
that's absolutely all that it is _ a situation comedy that happens
to be animated.''

   The trouble with many young TV executives is
that they revert to their happy childhood memories when the ratings
dragon roars. Bring back the old shows, they think, and the bad
dragon will go away.
   This might explain why CBS, which will unleash a new ``Love
Boat'' movie Monday and plans a TV movie based on the ``Green
Acres'' series, is offering a TV movie tonight about the Brady
bunch of yesteryear, ``The Bradys.''
   This all-American clan already has been in two series and one
short-lived variety series. Isn't that enough? Nooo. They had a
Christmas movie two years ago and it made the ratings dragon go
away. Ergo, here we go again.
   True, knocking ``The Bradys'' is like drop-kicking a wounded
butterfly. But tonight's two-hour premiere of their new Friday
series is so dim it's not even suitable for goofing on. But it does
show the passage of time.
   Middle-class Mom and Pop (Florence Henderson and Robert Reed of
the original cast), parents of six children, now are grandparents.
Their kids are all grown, most are middle-class and all have
problems of their own.
   Oh drat, we gave away the plot.
   However, those who decide to practice tuba tonight instead of
watching this show should know they'll miss its major crisis, which
occurs because Bobby the Youngest (Mike Lookinland) is a rookie
race-car driver.
   He's facing The Big Race, the Nashville 500. Most of the family
is watching, in person or via TV. His disc jockey sister (Susan
Olsen), in Nashville to broadcast the race for her station, urges
listeners to ``Root along with me! Yayyyyyy, Bobby!''
   Bobby gets in his stock car. The starter says ``Gentlemen, start
your engines.'' Then the track announcer says, ``And there's the
famous call for `Gentlemen, start your engines.''' All this means
the race will begin.
   A few laps, then it's uh-oh time, screeching tires, crunching
metal. There's a pause in the action. The track announcer says
``Boy, this is a full-course yellow.'' A little Brady asks, ``Is
Uncle Bobby going to be okay?''
   Later, Uncle Bobby, in his hospital bed, also wonders. He asks
his anxious parents, ``Mom, Dad ... am I going to walk again?''
   Only time and therapy will tell. But at least it draws the
family together to gently illustrate the problems of the disabled,
resolve lesser crises that have been brewing, and provide a sure
cure for insomnia.
   There are many lesser crises to pick from. The one that stands
out seems to have become Topic A in shows about thirtysomething
married couples _ the desire of yuppie wives to have a baby before
it's Too Late.
   Here, the wife is Jan (Eve Plumb), an architect wed to Phillip
(Ron Kuhlman), a college professor. Every time she ovulates, she
summons him and they rush home and hop into bed. But no baby.
   Not even a romantic sea voyage does the trick. This lovemaking
by the numbers gets kind of grim for him, even though she smiles a
lot. He asks if there cannot be just a bit more romance. She smiles
and says this:
   ``Phillip, we tried romantic even on the ship. No baby. Now's
the time for persistence. Remember _ the tick, tick, tick of that
old biological clock.''
   The show might have been better had one of Bobby's lines gone to
Jan's sex-wearied husband, who could ask his parents-in-law: ``Mom,
Dad ... am I going to walk again?''
   But let us count our blessings, even though we're no good at
fractions. The Bradys aren't entirely whitebread now. Bobby's chief
mechanic in tonight's show is black. One character who probably
will marry into the family is Jewish. And a little Korean girl
joins the cast at the finale, which also features a wedding because
TV executives thinking weddings increase ratings. This one includes
singing by Henderson.
   On the bright side, she doesn't sing ``Feelings.''
   We know you'll want to tune in for next week's episode of ``The
Bradys,'' in which the crisis is the city's plan to run a freeway
right through Ma and Pa Brady's posh suburban neighbhood. You may
root for the freeway.

<HEAD>Jamaicans Told To Tighten Their Belts</HEAD>
<HEAD>By ROBERT GLASS</HEAD>
<HEAD>Associated Press Writer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While the moneyed people from elsewhere
crowd their beaches and resorts, Jamaicans are being told by the
year-old government of Prime Minister Michael Manley to tighten
their belts.
   Manley is imposing harsh austerity measures to satisfy Western
creditors and cope with Jamaica's crippling $4.3 billion deficit.
   The measures include a 19.5 perscent increase in the price of
basic foodstuffs like flour and cornmeal, an average 32.5 percent
rise in electricity rates and a 50 percent surcharge on dozens of
luxury items such as Christmas tree lights and TV satellite dishes.
   The government also devalued the Jamaican dollar by 7.1 percent,
to 7 per U.S. dollar from 6.50, to dampen demand for imports and
ease a chronic shortage of foreign exchange.
   It was the latest round in a series of price rises and monetary
controls, including higher interest rates, imposed by Manley since
returning to power in a landslide election victory Feb. 9, 1989.
   His repeated manipulation of the economy, which officials
acknowledge has hurt the poor most, has cut into his popularity.
   A poll late last year by political analyst Carl Stone, who has
accurately predicted election outcomes since the 1970s, indicated
that 52 percent of Jamaican voters were not satisfied with Manley's
People's National Party government, 40 percent were satisfied and
the remainder were undecided.
   Columnist Byron Buckley, writing in the Sunday Gleaner, an
independent weekly, accused the prime minister of failing to follow
through on his party's election campaign slogan to ``put the people
first.''
   ``Never before in the nation's history has a newly elected
government proceeded so quickly to renege on the basic tenet of the
election platform,'' Buckley wrote.
   Jamaican business and political leaders said, however, that in
his first year Manley has thoroughly lived up to his pledge to
abandon the radical socialism of his previous two administrations
in the 1970s. In those years, Manley appropriated private farms,
heavily taxed business and forged close ties with Cuba's Fidel
Castro, antagonizing the United States and Western investors and
pushing Jamaica to the edge of economic collapse.
   Many say the cost-cutting, free-enterprise regimen of Manley's
new social democratic administration is barely distinguishable from
that of his predecessor, the conservative Edward Seaga of the
Jamaica Labor Party, who during the eight years in office was
regarded as former President Ronald Reagan's closest ally in the
Caribbean.
   ``It was amazing, I never thought he could do it,'' Anthony
Barnes president of the influential Jamaica Manufacturer's
Association, said of Manley's political conversion. ``As a
businessman, I unhesitatingly say that I find the new Manley a very
refreshing individual.''
   Indeed, Barnes said, Manley's government has been ``a lot more
responsive and a lot more willing to listen to the productive
sector.''
   ``I consider it to be a major and significant difference between
the two leaders,'' Barnes said.
   In foreign affairs, Manley has fostered good relations with the
Bush administration and assumed a high profile in the drug war,
winning United Nations approval for a proposed global
anti-narcotics strike force.
   Barnes and others said the Manley administration still appears
to be feeling its way and has not yet demonstrated the decisiveness
and managerial competence of the Seaga team.
   ``There is an image problem with this goverment that they may
not have the discipline to handle the really difficult problems,''
Barnes said.
   The opposition doesn't see it that way.
   ``You get the impression that this government is in a quandary
and doesn't know what it's doing,'' said Bruce Golding, chairman of
Seaga's Jamaica Labor Party. ``Ineptitude is perhaps an appropriate
team to use.''
   In a speech Jan. 28 preparing the nation for the
belt-tightening, Manley said he was being forced to take the action
under terms of a 15-month agreement with the International Monetary
Fund. The agreement, which went into effect Jan. 1, provides a $108
million loan and was required for negotiations with commercial
banks on rescheduling of $400 million of Jamaica's foreign debt and
for any new loans from the World Bank and European and Caribbean
lending agencies.
   The government contends it has been forced to make repeated
economic adjustments because of pressure arising from Jamaica's
foreign debt, which doubled during Seaga's years.
   With 2.4 million people, Jamaica has one of the world's largest
per capita debts, brought on mainly by soaring oil prices in the
1970s and the near-collapse of the Jamaican bauxite industry in the
1980s.
   Nearly 50 cents of every dollar coming into the Treasury is used
to pay interest on the debt. In addition, Jamaica imports 100
percent of its energy needs, mostly oil, which must be paid for in
U.S. dollars.
   Without the IMF agreement, Manly said in his speech, ``Jamaica
would be in serious trouble in four weeks or less.'' He added that
it was a matter of ``nothing less than self-preservation.''
   The new austerity measures had long been expected and immediate
criticism was subdued. The government avoided any immediate rise in
gasoline prices, which was the trigger for widespread civil unrest
in 1985.
   To further soften the blow, the government amended its
wage-price guidelines to allow unions to negotiate for pay raises
of 12.5 percent, up from the previous 10 percent.

<HEAD>Firings High Among Baptist Pastors; Half of Victims Quit Ministry</HEAD>
<NOTE>With Laserphoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Congregations hold a potential ax over the careers of Baptist
pastors and many times, swing it. Often it's a shock to the victim.
He hadn't foreseen it. But he's out by choice of his flock.
   Such terminations have become a painful problem in the big
Southern Baptist Convention, hundreds of whose pastors are
summarily fired each year by disgruntled congregations.
   ``It's personally and professionally shattering for the
minister,'' says the Rev. Ernest O. White, director of the Dehoney
Center for Study of the Local Church. ``It's traumatic for him and
his family.
   ``It's also detrimental to the church. The name of Christian
faith is scarred by that kind of thing.''
   However, unlike most major denominations, Baptists in their
organizational system stress the autonomy of local congregations,
free to hire or fire their pastors at will, without intervention.
   ``Our polity declares that the pastor must be reasonably
pleasing to the congregation,'' White said in an interview. ``This
places some limits on the pastor in confronting controversial
subjects.''
   In Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox and United Methodist
churches, bishops designate pastors. In the United Church,
Lutheran, Presbyterian and Episcopal churches, it's a mutual
procedure of congregations and overseeing entities.
   But for Baptists and various independent-style churches, it's
solely up to the local congregation to pick or oust a pastor, and
Baptist studies have found that the toll of dismissals is immense.
   A 1988 study found that more than 2,100 pastors were fired
during an 18-month period. That means 116 ministers were fired each
month, a 31 percent increase over the rate found in a 1984 study.
   ``Most every one of them is a tragedy in our view of the
experience,'' said White, whose center recently did a special study
of such firings in Missouri.
   ``It's detrimental both to the church and the ministers.''
   The 14.8 million-member denomination, the country's largest
Protestant body, has about 37,000 local congregations.
   White said the center's Missouri study found that about half the
ousted pastors eventually find other pulpits, but the other half
are lost to the ministry and go into other kinds of work.
   ``After they've had their dream of being a minister, after four
years of college and three years of seminary, they get busted,'' he
said. It's also after an average five years in the ministry, the
study found.
   White, who teaches preaching at the Southern Baptist Theological
Seminary in Louisville, Ky., where the study center is situated,
said the blame can lie with either side.
   However, he said ``many congregations have a kind of conflict
mentality that repeat these firings.'' They often are engineered
``by factions and power groups that want to control the church more
than by leadership of the pastor.''
   Some other congregations have a ``winning coach'' view that
causes the trouble, he said. ``If the church isn't growing
numerically, or winning, then get rid of the leader and get another
one.''
   They see ``expansionism as the only criteria of validity,'' even
in areas not conducive to expansion, he said, and put all the
responsibility for it on the pastor, rather than seeing the
congregation's part in the task.
   The study found that most ousted pastors have full seminary
training and in their seminary idealism couldn't ``conceive the
possibility that life in the parish would be rough and tumble,''
White said. ``But politics in the churches is not too different
from politics in the courthouse.''
   Pastors also can sometimes be at fault in being either ``too
authoritarian or too self-effacing and paralyzed in their
leadership,'' he said. ``These are ditches on either side of the
road.''
   Also, most ousted pastors, apparently not adequately sensitive
to member attitudes, weren't even aware of a problem in advance, he
said. ``The first time they knew they had a problem is when they
were asked to resign.''
   White, 60, a pastor himself for 32 years, said the relationship
between a pastor and congregation is somewhat like a marriage and
the partners need to get better acquainted before sealing their
pact.
   To try to ease the problem, state directors of missions are now
sometimes invited by congregations to intervene in difficulties
about the pastor and seek a solution, he said.
   ``This is one of the hopeful signs,'' White said.
   He himself often serves as a consultant-adviser in such
situations. But such interventions can only be at invitation of
congregations, and that usually comes when the situation has
deteriorated too far to repair.
   Such intervention by regional ministers to forestall and mediate
such conflicts has become customary procedure in another
denomination whose policy provides congregational autonomy _ the
Christian Church (Disciples of Christ).

   Several Roman Catholic scholars have
criticized a Vatican-issued draft of a proposed universal catechism
that has been distributed to bishops for their reactions.
   Following a symposium, the scholars said at a news conference
that there were serious deficiencies in the document, particuarly
in failing to make distinctions between essential truths of faith
and peripheral elements.
   The 430-page document is intended as a comprehensive summary of
Catholic beliefs.
   Lawrence Cunningham, a theology professor at the University of
Notre Dame, said one of the document's ``most glaring weaknesses''
is that it ``suffers from what computer people would call an
`information overload,''' lacking guidance on ``what's more
important and what's less important.''
   Bishops are supposed to submit responses by May 31. Bishop
Rayumond F. Lucker of New Ulm, Minn., who participated in the
symposium, said, ``I'm hoping there will be substantial changes.''

   Chicago Catholic Women, an organization
advocating fuller women's rights in Roman Catholicism, has urged
the church to open its all-male priesthood to women and creation of
a new seminary system to train them.

   The former president of the Southern Baptist
Woman's Missionary Union has endorsed a moderate candidate for the
denomination's presidency and said she is willing to run as his
vice president.
   Carolyn Weatherford Crumpler, who for 15 years headed the WMU
until last year, endorsed the Rev. Daniel Vestal for the top post
from the pulpit of his church in suburban Dunwoody, and said she
was ready to run with him.
   Fundamentalists have won the presidency of the 14.8
million-member denomination for the past decade, achieving
majorities among trustees of the denomination's institutions and
agencies.
   Mrs. Crumpler, married last summer to a Cincinnati pastor after
she left leadership of the women's organization, said she is
concerned because a ``takeover'' group has muzzled denominational
executives and the denomination's news agency, Baptist Press.
   Vestal, who narrowly lost the presidency last year to the
fundamentalist incumbent, the Rev. Jerry Vines, said he had asked
Mrs. Crumpler to work with him and seek the vice presidency to
bring reconciliation to the faction-torn denomination.
   Its annual convention is scheduled for June in New Orleans.

   Beyond disagreements over slavery, it was a vicious campaign,
with Lincoln subjected to endless personal attacks from Southern
newspapers.
   ``He has most unwarrantly abused the privilege, which all
politicians have, of being ugly,'' the Houston Chronicle sneered,
commenting on Lincoln's thin, pock-marked face and unruly hair. ``A
horrid looking wretch he is,'' added the Charleston (S.C.) Mercury,
``sooty and scoundrelly in aspect, a cross between the nutmeg
dealer, the horse dealer and the night man.''
   But Lincoln, who would soon follow the advice of little Grace
Bedell of Westfield, N.Y., and grow a beard, said nothing, making
no formal speeches during the campaign. And thanks to the
Democratic split, he easily won the election while receiving only
40 percent of the votes.
   By his inauguration in March 1861, however, seven Southern
states had already seceded and rumors of an assassination attempt
had forced him to alter travel plans the previous month. In his
inaugural address, Lincoln pleaded for a peaceful settlement to the
slavery issue:
   ``We must not be enemies. Though passion may have strained, it
must not break our bonds of affection. The mystic chords of memory,
stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave, to every
living heart and hearthstone, all over this broad land, will yet
swell the chorus of the Union, when again touched, as surely they
will be, by the better angels of our nature.''
   On April 12, the Confederates opened fire on Fort Sumter in
Charleston harbor and captured it two days later. Lincoln, vowing
to ``repel force by force,'' called for a militia of 75,000 and
ordered a blockade of Southern ports. The Civil War had begun.
   ``Except in respect to military matters, Lincoln was not the
kind of president we expect today,'' Fehrenbacher said. ``He didn't
give leadership in domestic affairs because he didn't think that
was his job. The Whigs had been opposing the `dictatorship' of
(President) Andrew Jackson. They believed that was the leadership
of Congress. He took the leadership role in war, and also in
regards to emancipation.''
   With typical caution, Lincoln dismantled slavery. In 1862, he
drafted the Emancipation Proclamation, but waited for a Union
victory before officially issuing it on Jan. 1, 1863.
   ``What good would a proclamation for emancipation from me do,
especially as we are now situated,'' he worried. ``I do not want to
issue a document that the whole world will see must necessarily be
inoperative, like the Pope's bull against the comet! Would my word
free the slaves when I cannot even enforce the Constitution in the
rebel States?''
   The turning point in the Civil War came that summer, outside
Gettysburg, Pa. For three days one of the war's bloodiest battles
was fought. Nearly 50,000 soldiers were killed and the Confederate
Army of Northern Virginia was forced to retreat.
   In November, Lincoln was a last-minute invitee to the dedication
of the Civil War Cemetery in Gettysburg. The Gettysburg Address,
under 300 words long, was a modest prayer that, despite the war,
``government of the people, by the people and for the people, shall
not perish from the earth.''
   Ironically, Lincoln predicted in the same speech, ``The world
will little note, nor long remember what we say here.''
   ``It's quite obvious that he realized this was an occasion that
something important could be said about the meaning of war and the
meaning of America,'' Fehrenbacher said. ``He saw it a new birth of
freedom, and it's obvious he gave a great deal of thought to what
he was saying.''
   The Republican Party overwhelmingly chose Lincoln as its
candidate in the 1864 elections. The Democrats selected Gen. George
B. McClellan, whom Lincoln had dropped as commander-in-chief of
Union forces in 1862.
   With the Union deadlocked on the battlefield, Lincoln seemed
sure he would lose, even writing a ``Memorandum of the Probable
Failure of Re-Election'' on Aug. 23. But he easily won in November.
   ``With malice towards none; with charity for all; with firmness
in the right ... let us strive to finish the work we are in,''
Lincoln urged at his inaugural in March 1865, hoping for a peaceful
way to ``bind up the nation's wounds.''
   Once victory seemed assured, Lincoln's thoughts moved beyond
winning the war and focused instead on reconstruction, the subject
of his last speech, given on April 11, two days after Gen. Robert
E. Lee's surrender at Appomattox.
   On April 14, while attending a play at the Ford Theatre in
Washington, Lincoln was shot in the head by actor John Wilkes
Booth, who cried out ``Sic Semper Tyranus'' (``Thus Ever to
Tyrants,'' the motto of Virginia). He died the following morning.
   Lincoln had long worried about death, thinking, speaking and
even dreaming of his assassination. In his early 50s, he was
already referring to himself as an old man, and he reflected on
mortality in an 1862 letter to young Fanny McCullough, whose father
was killed in battle:
   ``In this sad world of ours, sorrow comes to all; and, to the
young, it comes with bitterest agony, because it takes them
unawares. The older have learned to ever expect it. I am anxious to
afford some alleviation of your present distress. Perfect relief is
not possible, except with time.
   ``... The mrobably would have continued as a writer,
Fehrenbacher said.
   ``In the presidency he was increasingly concerned with the art
of writing. That shows in his best works, and that's one more thing
that John Wilkes Booth took away from us.''

<HEAD>The Grammys Honor Nat King Cole's Unforgettable Voice</HEAD>

   His voice was unforgettable. His songs took us
down memory lane, Route 66 to be exact, to those lazy, hazy, crazy
days of summer. And if you were lucky, his ballads recalled the
very thought of you.
   Nat ``King'' Cole was loved for sentimental reasons. During
World War II, his love songs offered a warm balm for soldiers away
from home, allowing them to make believe they were home with their
sweethearts.
   The National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences will honor
Cole with a Lifetime Achievement Award during its Grammy
presentation on Feb. 21, six days after the 25th anniversary of his
death at age 45 from lung cancer.
   During his 23 years with Capitol Records, until 1964, Cole
recorded hundreds of songs, and many went on to become industry
standards: ``Unforgettable,'' ``The Christmas Song,'' ``Route 66''
and ``Ramblin' Rose.''
   Cole's voice was a lovely work of art _ a beguiling Mona Lisa of
sound _described as everything from three parts fog to one part
frog; a pussy willow; and a breathy swatch of velvet.
   Lore has it that he began his career as a crooner by accident. A
tipsy customer at a small Hollywood bistro where he was playing
piano insisted he sing ``Sweet Lorraine'' and, to keep the drunk
quiet, Cole obliged.
   Once he began singing, however, he quickly became a fluent
vocalist, changing styles and rhythms with ease, weaving together
sets that easily combined swinging bebop hits and honey-coated love
songs.
   His wife, Maria Cole, said it was his voice that truly launched
him.
   ``He never would have been the international figure he became if
he hadn't been singing,'' she said in an interview. ``I know in my
heart he wanted it. He liked the attention.''
   Born in 1919 to a Baptist minister in Montgomery, Ala.,
Nathaniel Adams Coles grew up in Chicago's South Side. He later
dropped the ``s'' from his last name and added his nickname, King.
   At the age of 4, he was able to pluck out the tune ``Yes, We
Have No Bananas'' on the piano and later played the organ in his
father's church. When he was 14, he organized a 14-piece band, and
made himself piano player and leader.
   ``I was always crazy about show business,'' Cole once said,
``and I was particularly crazy about bands. Why, I used to stand in
front of the radio and lead bands all the time.''
   After high school, he worked with several bands without great
success until 1937, when he got hip, took a timely trip and motored
West.
   It was in California that he formed the King Cole Trio _ a
piano, a guitar and bass _ playing gigs for $75 a week. With Cole
on the piano, Oscar Moore on guitar and Johnny Miller on bass, the
trio generated a following and began to tour.
   In New York in 1946, already married to Nadine Robinson, Cole
met the then Maria Ellington, a striking beauty who was rehearsing
for a show at the chic Club Zanzibar.
   ``It's terrible, I feel funny when I tell this story because I'm
usually so doggone dignified. But he did say it. He said, `Boy, if
she looks as good from the front as she does from the back,''' the
second Mrs. Cole recalled, breaking off in a peal of laughter.
``And then, of course, I ignored him. He didn't interest me.''
   Cole persevered, sending her tickets a boxing match, which he
couldn't attend because of a gig. But a few weeks later he took her
to a horse race and the romance got past the starting gate. He
divorced his first wife, and he and Maria were married a year
later. During their 15-year marriage, they had five children:
Carol, Natalie, Kelly and identical twins Timolin and Casey.
   Cole, an ardent babeball fan, named his last child for the late
manager Casey Stengel.
   ``He was basically introverted,'' Mrs. Cole said, ``except for
when he talked about music and baseball. But those things he knew!
And he knew he knew them! There was no holding back when it came to
either one.
   ``That was wonderful that I loved sports because I would have
been home a lot by myself.''
   Natalie, a Grammy winner, remembers her father's passion for
racing around in his sports car.
   ``He liked to go for drives,'' she said in an interview. ``He
had a sports car, a Jaguar, and I think I was the only one that
would get in with him _ he was a fast driver.''
   As far as musical influences, Natalie recalled her father
singing children's songs. ``He didn't go around the house singing
`Mona Lisa,''' she said. ``They were children's songs, fun songs.
And those are the songs that I remember, and those are the songs
that I've passed on to my son.''
   She then launched into one: ``Oh Mary Mac, Mac Mac ... all
dressed in black black black, with silver buttons, all down her
back back back.''
   Not all of her associations with her father, however, are as
warm.
   ``For me, I didn't really feel like I was in his shadow until I
chose (singing) as my career. And then all of the sudden it loomed
up as something pretty intimidating and overwhelming.''
   Natalie wanted to be recognized for her own talent, and not just
for being the namesake of Nat King Cole.
   ``For a long time I really wished I could change my name,'' she
said. ``It's been since about six years ago that I really have been
able to carry it gracefully and hopefully in a way that is proud
and becoming to his flesh and blood.''
   In 1956, Cole started his own network television show, ``The Nat
King Cole Show'' on NBC. But national advertisers were leary about
backing a show hosted by a black man, the first of its kind, and
the program was eventually forced off the air.
   ``Madison Avenue is afraid of the dark,'' Cole concluded.
   Cole also appeared as the blues composer W.C. Handy in the movie
``St. Louis Blues,'' and had a role in the Jane Fonda film ``Cat
Ballou.''
   ``He was full of humor,'' Mrs. Cole said. ``Many people don't
know this. He was very funny. He'd make dry, wonderful remarks. .. .
   ``He was a fun man to be with. I had a wonderful life. I miss
him more now that I'm older, so I'm just very happy that he's
getting his due.''
   Her favorite Nat ``King'' Cole song? ``Our Love Is Here to
Stay.''

<HEAD>Rap Has Gone Establishment, But Is It Here To Stay?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BAUDER</BYLINE>

   Rap music's come a long way from the days of parties in the
South Bronx, when disc jockeys manipulated records in a frantic
competition to see who could keep people on the dance floor te
longest.
   Now it seems rap is everywhere, and is firmly established as a
music category at the annual Grammy Awards, which will be held Feb.
21.
   That makes Grandmaster Flash proud, even though this pioneer
barely has time to pause from his producing chores to reflect on
rap's rapid rise.
   ``I'm a little shocked, but then again I'm happy because I knew
it was an appealing form of music,'' said Flash, one of a handful
of deejays credited with creating rap in the mid-1970s. ``But to
what magnitude it would reach was a mystery to me.''
   Rappers sell millions of records, but their names and music are
as bewildering to a generation of Americans over age 21 as John,
Paul, George and Ringo were more than 25 years ago.
   It's a veritable alphabet soup of stars. There's LL Cool J and
Kool Moe Dee. There's NWA, Heavy D, Ice-T and Run-DMC. There's
Young MC and MC Lyte, DJ Jazzy Jeff and D-Nice. There's Salt 'n'
Pepa, Flavor Flav and the Fat Boys.
   ``The groove is good. You can dance to it,'' said LL Cool J,
updating the line teen-agers have used to praise records on
``American Bandstand'' since before he was born.
   Like Bob Dylan in the 1960s, rap's opened the door to many
artists who aren't conventional singers but have something to say.
Because of rap, the beat has overshadowed the melody as the primary
element in many pop songs. To the chagrin of many, rap popularized
the technique of ``sampling'' old sounds in new music.
   Rap also has emphasized differences _ political, racial, musical
and generational _ still alive in music and society as a whole.
   Flash, the moniker of Joseph Saddler, spun disco records at
clubs and parties in the South Bronx. He and fellow deejays used
turntables and records the way other musicians used guitars and
keyboards. Eventually, some dejays started ``rapping'' or talking
through microphones over the music.
   ``Hip-hop'' and breakdancing became hot styles. Rap records,
many released on independent labels, became hits through word of
mouth and play in dance clubs. ``The Message,'' a 1982
state-of-the-ghetto report by Flash and his band, the Furious Five,
was an early landmark.
   Rap technicians quickly learned to mine old records for new
sounds. Now it's a popular practice. Janet Jackson's hit, ``Rhythm
Nation,'' uses a passage directly lifted from an old Sly and the
Family Stone record. Jailed soul star James Brown has reached a
whole new generation of listeners because of old passages
``sampled'' in new rap songs, says LL Cool J.
   Some artists are flattered by the new attention, others so angry
they launch lawsuits.
   Many pop music fans say rap has claimed the mantle of innovation
that rock music earned in the 1960s.
   ``It can actually stand on its own legs now, where at one point
it was understood to be a fad,'' Flash said. ``It was just
considered in its own little category. From a technical and
creative point of view, I always knew that this could intertwine
with various forms of music _ your jazz, blues, rock and pop.''
   Another fan is 38-year-old William Adler. He's admittedly a
little biased, since his job at Rush Artists Management involves
steering the careers of rap artists such as Public Enemy and LL
Cool J.
   ``To me, it's the most thrilling rock 'n' roll being made
today,'' Adler said. ``Do I want a big beat? It's there. Do I want
rebellion? It's there. Do I want wit, do I want sex, do I want
social engagement, do I want nonsense? All there. And it delivers
it to me in greater measure than any other comparable musical form
right now.''
   Rap styles are as diverse as music itself.
   DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince are good-natured pop stars,
with such novelty songs as ``I Think I Can Beat Mike Tyson,'' and
the teen anthem ``Parents Just Don't Understand.'' The aptly named
Fat Boys have made duets with the Beach Boys and Chubby Checker.
   Artists such as NWA and Public Enemy are on the other end of the
spectrum, with blunt lyrics that pick up where ``The Message'' left
off. A controversial NWA song about black attitudes toward police
left law enforcement on edge. Public Enemy, with its recent single,
``Welcome to the Terrordome,'' has opened a Jewish-black rift.
   Many rappers are simply braggarts claiming to be the biggest,
the baddest, the best. That, in turn, has brought complaints of
sexism and the calculatedly contrary stance of artists such as the
female Salt 'n' Pepa and the 1960s-influenced De La Soul.
   Rap and rock have also forged an interesting alliance. They were
thought to be contrary camps, until Run-DMC's hugely influential
remake of Aerosmith's ``Walk This Way'' broke down barriers in 1987.
   High ratings for MTV's ``Yo! MTV Raps!'' show also indicate that
rap is not just music for black teen-agers.
   ``Black America is not hooked up for cable, I'm sorry,'' Adler
said. ``It's a suburban phenomenon. So you know who the audience is
for `Yo! MTV Raps!'''
   The Grammys created a new category last year to honor rap music.
But several of its stars boycotted the awards because the rap
Grammy wasn't presented on prime-time television.
   Also, although Tone Loc's sly homage to sex, ``Wild Thing,''
last year became the biggest-selling single since ``We Are the
World,'' it never made it to No. 1 on the Billboard singles charts
because some Top 40 radio stations won't play rap. No rap single
has ever reached No. 1 on the Billboard pop charts.
   Some rappers say racism has a lot to do with that. But that
doesn't explain the so-called ``black'' radio stations that also
resist rap in favor of the soul sounds of the '60s and '70s.
   Occasional violence at rap concerts has given communities
jitters and caused some cancellations. Rappers say it's not the
music that causes trouble, but some fans who are gang members.
   Some rappers are worried about too much rap, not too little.
They wonder if rap will go the way of disco and collapse under the
weight of too many mediocre records. Russell Simmons, founder of
Def Jam Records, complains that major record labels are signing too
many bad rap acts in their attempt to find new stars.
   But radio resistance hasn't stopped rap from seeping into
mainstream culture. Advertisers looking for a youthful market know
rap sells. Rap was incorporated into the work of several Top 40
musicians through the 1980s, from Blondie's ``Rapture'' in 1980 to
Billy Joel's ``We Didn't Start the Fire'' in 1989.
   ``There's nothing wrong with that,'' LL Cool J said of the
competition with Joel, suburban Long Island's favorite white son.
``I like it. That just shows that people are opening up. If an
artist like Billy Joel does something like that, maybe people will
listen to a little guy like LL Cool J.''

   Now that they've won their freedom, what does
the future hold for the people of Eastern Europe? Hard times are
ahead it seems. To make economic reforms work in the new
democracies will require a lot of personal sacrifice and extensive
aid from the West.

<TEXT>
   In Eastern Europe, ideology has
once again come face-to-face with hard reality. Making a revolution
is often easier than fulfilling its goals.
   After overthrowing four decades of rigid Communist rule, the
people of Eastern Europe are facing enormous problems.
   The years of centrally planned systems and Communist
mismanagement have left East European economies in such ruins that
a lot of help from the West and plenty of sacrifices of their own
will be necessary before the countries can stand on their own feet.
   While the problems are gigantic and many people are pessimistic,
the pro-democracy drive received a tremendous boost when the Soviet
Communists on Wednesday approved President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
proposal that the party give up its monopoly on power.
   The decision closed the circle that began with Gorbachev's
policies of glasnost and perestroika that allowed East European
countries to go their own way.
   But it will take years before the economies of East European
countries are sound and competitive. During the adjustment to a
free-market system, the governments will have to deal with
unemployment, bankruptcies, inflation and massive debts, even an
atrophied work ethic.
   Experts say the environmental woes of several East European
countries are bordering on catastrophe and will take years and
billions of dollars to clean up.
   An accelerating exodus of skilled workers averaging about 1,800
a day, strikes and absenteeism are driving East Germany to the
brink of economic collapse.
   More than 400,000 East Germans have resettled in West Germany in
a year. West Germany, struggling to cope with the rate of new
arrivals, has been forced to step in to try to bail out the
faltering neighbor with infusion of aid and plans for a quick
monetary union. Unification may come faster than anyone anticipated.
   Poland owes $40 billion to Western creditors, Hungary and
Yugoslavia about $20 billion each. Yugoslavia's inflation rate is
more than 1,500 percent annually.
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa acknowledges the shock-therapy
plan to tame the inflation and transform Poland into a free-market
economy is painful and says it needs a lot of Western aid.
   ``We are like a car with four wheels running in different
directions, moving fast but slipping backward. Nothing can be done
from inside the car,'' Walesa told a reporter in Gdansk recently.
   He said foreign aid already promised is insufficient.
   ``It is too slow and too little,'' he said. ``This is why I see
this (reform plan) as blacker and blacker. We cannot reform our old
system within our own means. This is impossible without outside
help.''
   Poland was the forerunner in the democratic transformation when
it became the first East European country to get a non-communist
government. In 1990, many eyes will be on Poland again to see the
progress of its economic recovery.
   The plan, which went into effect on Jan. 1, decontrolled prices,
foreign exchange and centrally allocated industrial inputs. It is
based on a restrictive budget policy designed to bring down
inflation within six months and is coupled with tight wage policy.
   It is the most radical, daring economic reform program ever
attempted in Eastern Europe.
   ``The course of our reforms is giving stimulation to the changes
in other countries of the region. The failure of the efforts could
make more difficult the evolution occurring in Central and Eastern
Europe,'' Polish Premier Tadeusz Mazowiecki told Parliament on Jan.
18.
   Yugoslavia's similar plan includes a six-month wage freeze,
strict monetary controls, closing down of unprofitable companies
and liberalized imports to provide more competition to domestic
industries. The dinar was made convertible at a fixed rate to the
West German mark.
   Both Poland and Yugoslavia were advised on their programs by
Jeffrey Sachs, a professor of economics at Harvard.
   Although the wage freeze already has triggered a fresh wave of
strikes in Yugoslavia, Sachs predicts they will gradually cease as
cheaper imports bring down domestic prices.
   The political focus will be on free elections that are scheduled
throughout the region this year.
   Also, Poland and Czechoslovakia have asked the Soviets to
withdraw their troops from the two countries and Budapest has
requested an accelerated pace of the pullout from Hungary.
   Free parliamentary elections are scheduled in East Germany,
Hungary, Romania and Czechoslovakia, and local elections in Poland
are expected to be moved up to April.
   In the Soviet Union, all 15 republics will hold local elections
that will offer a choice of candidates for the first time. Bulgaria
is also expected to hold free elections although the date has not
been fixed.
   In non-aligned Yugoslavia, the Communists are expected to
compete with other groups in parliamentary elections that could
take place as early as April.
   Although it broke away from the Soviet bloc in 1948 and for
years followed its own model of more liberal communism, Yugoslavia
has fallen behind in the pace of political reforms going on in
other East European countries.
   Like the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia is a country of a delicate
ethnic balance and different republics where nationalist feelings
could jeopardize the transition to democracy.
   The Baltic states in the Soviet Union are pushing for
independence, strong nationalist movements have emerged in Georgia
and Moldavia, which borders Romania. The Communist Party of
Lithuania has broken with Moscow.

   Moscow sent thousands of soldiers to halt the civil war between
Christian Armenians and Moslem Azerbaijanis and quell an uprising
in Azerbaijan.
   The Western-most Yugoslav republic of Slovenia is also toying
with secession and its Communists have broken away from the
national party organization after a deep split between reformers
and hard-liners.
   A 10-year drive for more autonomy by the ethnic Albanians, most
of them Moslems, in the southern province of Kosovo exploded in
another round of violence at the end of January that killed nearly
30 people.
   Neighboring Albania remains the last bastion of Stalinism in
Eastern Europe, but is showing cautious signs of emerging from its
self-imposed isolation. Reports in Yugoslav and Greek newspapers of
recent disturbances in Albania have been strongly denied by Tirana.
   Thousands of Bulgarians have demonstrated against restoring the
rights of Moslem ethnic Turks.
   Such outbreaks of dangerous nationalism and ethnic fighting are
reviving fears of instability that once made the Balkans the powder
keg of Europe. They could sap the energies needed for an orderly
transition to democracy and take precious time away from pressing
economic problems.
   The Communists have lost their constitutionally guaranteed
monopoly on power in East European countries, but they still have
powerful assets that give them an organizational advantage over the
opposition in the campaigns leading to the elections.
   While getting rid of the old, Stalinist leaders, the Communists
have reorganized themselves, changing their names in some cases,
and are not going to give up without a fight at the ballot box.
   In East Germany, the Communists tried to seize on the alleged
rise of right-wing extremists to drum up support. But the party is
losing members and is unlikely to get a significant number of votes
in the March 18 elections.
   The disorganized, fractured and inexperienced opposition has
realized the problem and different groups are forging alliances as
the country stumbles toward the elections.
   Ulrich Stockman, a leader of the Social Democratic Party, says
it is hard to organize people politically after 40 years of apathy
under Communist rule.
   ``People have felt lost, with all these new parties coming up
all the time,'' after decades of political unawareness, Stockman
said.
   But the East German parties are receiving extensive
organizational and campaign aid from their West German counterparts
and a poll in early February predicted the Social Democrats would
win 54 percent of the vote, with the Communists a distant second at
12 percent.
   Krisztina Bokor, a 50-year-old Budapest manager, recently
expressed some of the pessimism building up in the wake of
revolutionary euphoria in Hungary.
   ``The elections will be characterized by apathy,'' she said.
``Most people are apolitical because there is no real motivation to
get them to become involved.''
   ``The country has no political culture. I do not expect any
positive changes to come about in my lifetime. Not in that of the
next generation,'' Mrs. Bokor said.
   Mrs. Edit Somlai, a 29-year-old Budapest teacher, said the
country was moving toward democracy, ``but unfortunately it won't
bring a better economic situation in our lifetime.''
   Unlike Poland or Czechoslovakia, East Germany's pro-democracy
movement lacks charismatic leaders that could unite the mushrooming
groups. In Hungary, opposition groups also are bickering, weakening
their election prospects.
   But a democratically elected government in East Germany can
count on West German aid to prop us its economy.
   For all the problems facing Eastern Europe, they pale in
comparison with those confronting Gorbachev.
   Perestroika and glasnost have been a huge success for
Gorbachev's image abroad. But at home, the stores are empty.
   Food rationing continues in most parts of the vast country, with
monthly ceilings on the amounts of tea, meat, sugar, matches and
other staples that Soviets can buy.
   Party conservatives fought Gorbachev's proposal for abandoning
the Communists' constitutionally guaranteed monopoly on power and
opening the way for a multiparty system.
   The provision already had been struck from the constitution in
Lithuania in favor of a multiparty system and Latvia's legislature
has moved to do the same.
   Gorbachev wants to advance the 28th national party congress from
October to June or early July and the Communists' future role is
likely to be its major topics.
   In the local elections, voters will be able to choose between
several candidates. Voters in many areas are expected to reject
Communist candidates in favor of nationalists, populists and
maverick Communists not backed by the local party potentates.

   The fliers with Jacob's smiling face
are yellowing, the ribbons bearing his name are tattered, the tips
to investigators are dwindling. Time fades almost everything _
except hope.
   Hope is what guides and drives Patty and Jerry Wetterling, from
what they do and say to how they think and pray. For almost four
months, they've prayed that their abducted son, Jacob, will return
home.
   Theirs is a story with a beginning and a middle, but no end.
   ``Every day, you're suspended,'' Mrs. Wetterling says. ``There's
no meaning to days and nights and weeks. Some people call and say,
`It's been seven weeks, it's been eight weeks.' After five minutes,
it was too long. ... It's painful to me every morning when I wake
up and he's not here. It's wrong.''
   A masked gunman grabbed Jacob Wetterling, 11, as he, his brother
and a buddy rode back from a convenience store. The abductor
ordered the two other boys to run or he'd shoot, then disappeared
into the darkness with Jacob _ less than a half-mile from the
family's home.
   No night will ever seem longer, no feeling more helpless. A
missing child, a stunned family. Then days of helicopters, dogs and
the National Guard scouring the fields. Patty and Jerry were afraid
they'd find something, and afraid they'd find nothing.
   Fears have since turned to frustration. Jacob's name is no
longer a staple of the local news. The family's 24-hour police
guard left weeks ago. The 70-member investigative team has shrunk
to about a dozen.
   Wetterling, 41, a chiropractor, is back at work. The three
children are back in school. But skating, fishing and football
outings have been replaced by efforts to keep the story alive,
fund-raisers and plans to mark Jacob's 12th birthday Feb. 17.
   ``We're not ready to pull together as a family of five and go
on,'' says Mrs. Wetterling, 40. ``That's not right yet for us.''
She pauses, then adds: ``I don't ever want that to happen.''
   For the Wetterlings, it's not if Jacob will return, but when.
Hope is their theme. Tens of thousands of ``Jacob's Hope'' hats,
white ribbons, signs, buttons and T-shirts have been distributed
nationwide. The words adorn a candle atop City Hall and a sign in
front of the family home in this quiet central Minnesota town of
3,200.
   ``We choose to remain hopeful because we believe we're going to
get Jacob back,'' Mrs. Wetterling says. ``Kids do come home after a
very long time.''
   Of nearly 24,000 missing children reported to the National
Center for Missing and Exploited Children in a 5{-year period
ending in December, abductions by strangers accounted for less than
4 percent. Most other disappearances involved family members or
were runaways.
   Despite the ``public sense these cases are doom and gloom,''
about 60 percent of children in long-term stranger abductions are
found alive, said Ernie Allen, the center's president.
   One of the most publicized, Steven Stayner, disappeared in
California at age 7 in 1972 and surfaced in 1980 at a police
station about 200 miles away with a 5-year-old boy his abductor had
snatched. Stayner was killed in a motorcycle-car accident last year.
   But others remain haunting mysteries: Johnny Gosch, the
12-year-old Iowa paperboy, gone since 1982; Etan Patz, the
6-year-old New Yorker last seen walking to a school bus stop almost
11 years ago.
   Investigators in the Wetterling case have logged about 20,000
calls, tips and potential suspects since the Oct. 22 abduction.
They've released sketches of a 40-to 50-year-old man who last year
kidnapped, sexually assaulted, then released a boy 10 miles away,
and another of a man with a menacing stare spotted in the store the
same day Jacob was there.
   Investigators believe there's a good possibility they're the
same man and consider him one of their stronger suspects.
   Corporations, famous athletes and hundreds of everyday people
also have joined the search. A local pharmacist called dozens of
folks in different area codes with the Wetterlings' phone number in
case Jacob got free and didn't know about long distance or wasn't
sure where he was.
   A volunteer office, including people who don't even know the
family, directs the publicity effort. ``I came just because I'm a
mom,'' says worker Pat Feldhege. ``It's pretty hard to resist
Jacob's smile.''
   More than 50 million fliers _ most sent by a direct-mail
marketing company that regularly features missing children _ have
been distributed and posted in train stations, truck stops,
airports and malls. It's a cruel reality for a woman who couldn't
bear to see missing kids on milk cartons.
   ``I don't want him to be a poster child,'' Mrs. Wetterling says.
``We've become symbolic and I don't want to appear ungrateful or
angry ... (but) I'm not satisfied with that. ... I'm just a mom who
wants her kid.''
   Jacob's parents travel the country, making TV and radio
appearances, patiently and articulately answering questions, baring
their souls to America in hopes of finding their boy.
   Sometimes they meet parents of other abducted children. It's no
solace to Mrs. Wetterling.
   ``I think it shouldn't happen to anybody, much less a group of
people, and I especially don't want to be around a group of people
who've been doing this for years,'' she says. ``It's not comforting
to know somebody else is going through hell.''
   The Wetterling house is filled with signs of Jacob, a
sixth-grader with a budding interest in the trombone, a passion for
sports and, his family says, a keen sense of fairness.
   His orange parka hangs in his closet, his hand-drawn picture of
a Teen-age Mutant Ninja Turtle and posters of the Detroit Pistons'
Isiah Thomas and the Chicago Bears' Neal Anderson line his walls.
His dog, named after football player Marcus Allen, pads around
waiting for his pal.
   As weeks turn to months, the house has been decorated with
balloons, inspirational poems, letters and cards from strangers,
paper birds from schoolchildren, a hand-scrawled message ``We Won't
Give Up,'' and a note from his 8-year-old sister, Carmen: ``We are
so sorry. ... Evrybuty cry'd very hard. I love you. ...''
   Carmen was ``really upset that Santa Claus didn't bring Jacob
any toys,'' Mrs. Wetterling says. ``I told her he didn't bring them
here. `Maybe he found Jacob, or maybe he's waiting until we find
Jacob.'''

   Trevor, 10, who was with Jacob that night, thinks of his
brother, too. When he recently got a baseball player's autograph,
he collected an extra one. He often sleeps in his parents' room and
didn't want to return to school.
   ``I said there's a law that says kids have to go to school and
he said, `Even when your brother's missing?''' his mother recalls.
``I didn't know what to say to that.''
   The Wetterlings say attending Trevor's hockey games is a sad
reminder of Jacob's love of the sport and skill as a goalie.
   But some tasks are grimmer. Jerry had to check to see if Jacob
was in pornographic pictures police recovered in an impounded car
in Minneapolis.
   Both Wetterlings are involved in the community: Patty once was
PTA president, Jerry led the Chamber of Commerce and a local NAACP
chapter. Now, finding Jacob is their work.
   ``At one point, I started getting more numb,'' Mrs. Wetterling
says. ``I actually felt kind of good because ... maybe he's gotten
to feel more numb and then he wouldn't feel so lost or alone or
afraid or pained.''
   ``Whatever's going on, he's just not feeling much of it,'' her
husband says. ``I feel that's what he's had to do to survive.''
   The Wetterlings say they don't think of the ``what ifs.''
   ``I'm not unrealistic, but I can't function if I think about all
the bad stuff,'' Jacob's mother says. ``If I get down, lots of
times I'll go find a group of kids because kids symbolize hope.''
   Dan Carle, a friend who counsels the Wetterlings, says the
family displays no vindictiveness. ``They seem to have a quality of
being able to forgive ... to hope,'' he says. ``There's a spiritual
dimension to this family deeper than I understand.''
   Jerry is an idealist, Patty an optimist. That hasn't changed.
   ``I have always been the type of person that if there's a 5
percent chance of doing something, I want to be in that 5
percent,'' she says. ``If there's one chance in a million that
Jacob can still come home, I want Jacob to be the one.''

   They live with a double agony: loss and uncertainty.
   Parents of abducted children share the painful anxiety that
comes with not knowing if or when they'll ever see their sons and
daughters again.
   Here are three families who have endured the worst, but hope for
the best:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Mike and Maddie Misheloff recently marked the saddest milestone
of their lives: the first anniversary of their daughter's
disappearance.
   Ilene Misheloff, 13, vanished in mid-afternoon on Jan. 30, 1989,
walking home from school in Dublin, Calif.
   ``We try to keep on going, keep the publicity going, to not get
too up or down about anything,'' Misheloff said. ``We have not
given up hope. We refuse to give in to despair.''
   On the anniversary of Ilene's disappearance, the Misheloffs led
more than 500 people in a candlelight vigil, walking along the
route their daughter is believed to have taken that day in the
community 45 miles southeast of San Francisco.
   The Misheloffs and their two sons, one of whom is Ilene's twin,
have struggled with a jumble of emotions this past year.
   ``Frustrated, yes, that we haven't found her,'' Misheloff said.
``Very scared what she has gone through and what she is undergoing.
Angry? No. I don't know who to be angry at. I can't get angry at
the world. I can't be cynical at the world because of the actions
of one crazy person or maybe a few crazy people.''
   Though the family is ``coping as best as possible,'' Misheloff
said Ilene's twin didn't want to celebrate his 14th birthday and he
and his wife can't bear to visit the ice rink where their daughter
practiced competitive skating.
   When a TV program showed a tape of her skating, he said, ``I
could hardly keep control of myself.''
   Misheloff, a microchip engineer, says he has put his career on
hold because ``Ilene is our No. 1 priority.'' The couple won't go
anywhere they can't be reached by phone or leave town for a
vacation.
   ``I can't conceive of this lasting for another year,'' he said.

   David Collins devotes his days to helping parents of missing
children. It's a gut-wrenching ordeal he knows about firsthand.
   His son, Kevin, disappeared Feb. 10, 1984, in San Francisco. The
coach who was supposed to give the 10-year-old a ride home with
other children didn't notice he was missing. He was last seen at a
bus stop.
   His father formed the Kevin Collins Foundation for Missing
Children, which has worked with more than 100 families of abducted
children. He travels to their homes, helps get fliers distributed
and, he said, ``I listen a lot.''
   Collins said he has gone through different stages since 1984.
   ``The first six months, you're looking at every bus, every car,
you're really paranoid about the whole thing,'' he said. ``Your
nerves are shot. ... I was working 16, 17 hours a day (searching).
   ``After the second year, things die down, the public becomes a
little less interested ... the leads stopped coming,'' he said.
   Collins said he no longer thinks of Kevin every day, but vividly
remembers his last week at home and how his son, who suffered from
dyslexia and was taunted at school, was ``just coming into his
own.''
   ``He had gotten his first `A' on a test,'' Collins recalled.
``He came running in, he showed it to me, he gave me a kiss. He'd
been through a lot ... and he was at his peak.''
   A picture of Kevin, the sixth youngest of nine Collins siblings,
was once on Newsweek's cover for a story on missing children.
   The family attends church on Kevin's birthday and, every
Christmas, puts his stocking out.
   ``The ache is always there,'' Collins said quietly. ``It never
goes away.''

   Noreen Gosch last saw her son, Johnny, as a freckle-faced boy of
12 heading off on his paper route. If he's still alive, he's a man.
   ``I have a real difficult time even comprehending what this boy
of 20 might be like,'' she said. ``To me, he's still 12. All those
years have been robbed from us. The clock stopped.''
   Since Johnny disappeared from West Des Moines, Iowa, on Sept. 5,
1982, his family has raised tens of thousands of dollars to hire
investigators, made hundreds of speeches and pushed for laws to
require immediate police searches when children are reported
missing.
   They've been victimized, too: One man tried to swindle them and
phone solicitors falsely claimed they were collecting money on
Johnny's behalf.
   Mrs. Gosch said it took almost five years before family life got
back to normal. Her heart and stomach pains have subsided. But her
memories of Johnny haven't dimmed.
   ``You might hear a song on the radio that might be your child's
favorite or pick up something your child gave you or you gave
them,'' she said. ``The minute you see it, touch it, feel it or
hear it, it just floods back like the child is here.''
   When she recently posed for a photograph for a story on Johnny,
she was asked to hold one of his belongings. ``The minute I touched
his jacket, I could picture the night we bought it at the store. I
could hear him say, `Oh, mom, I really love it.' It was like
reliving the experience.''
   The Gosches, who have two other grown children, remain hopeful.
   ``We know that some day this case is going to be solved,'' she
said. ``I want to know if he's alive, of course. If his life has
been taken, we can deal with it, but we want to know. ... I really
thought we would have some answer by now.''

   Lattie McGee was only 4, but he knew as much
about torture as any concentration camp inmate or prisoner of war.
His prison was a dark closet in his family's South Side apartment,
where he often was hung upside down, bound and gagged, for hours.
   Lattie liked to play with his toy cars, dance silly with his
brother, watch cartoons and romp in the mud outside when the
weather was warm.
   But Lattie's joyous childhood vanished the summer of 1987, a
summer of torture. Testimony about the agonies he endured shocked
prosecutors, defense attorneys and even the judge.
   Lattie's mother and her live-in boyfriend, who said he beat
Lattie and his brother because he thought they were homosexual, are
to be sentenced Thursday by Cook County Criminal Court Judge
Michael B. Getty.
   Getty called Lattie's death ``the most heinous, brutally
sadistic torture and murder ... that I have ever heard in my 6{
years as a judge, my over 10 years as a prosecutor, or indeed my 51
years on this Earth.''
   Lattie was starved, burned with a hot iron, stuck with pins and
needles, singed with cigarettes, beaten with a tree branch, hair
brush, belt and hands, scalded with steaming water, and tied up
with a clothesline, rope and tights for 2{ months that summer,
court testimony showed.
   A severe blow to his head in August was the eventual cause of
death, but his emaciated body, scarred from head to foot, was so
infected from untreated wounds that he likely would have died a
short time later, a pathologist from the county medical examiner's
office testified.
   Lattie's torture, death and the criminal convictions are more an
exception than the rule, said Dr. Demetra Soter, coordinator of the
Pediatric Trauma Unit at Cook County Hospital.
   Abuse cases often are not prosecuted until the victim is killed
because ``people in high levels of position can't believe that
people torture children,'' she said. ``Hopefully, with people
seeing stuff like this, they'll start to believe that it really
happens.''
   Lattie's was one of 40,278 reported cases of child abuse or
neglect in Cook County in 1987 and one of 38 reported deaths, said
David Schneidman, a spokesman for the state Department of Children
and Family Services. Statewide, there were 91,723 cases and 54
deaths, he said.
   The numbers are worse for 1988, the most recent period for which
statistics are available. In Cook County, 54 of the 42,564 reported
abuse or neglect cases ended in death, Schneidman said. Statewide,
91,723 cases of abuse or neglect and 98 deaths were reported.
   The night before Lattie died, his mother's boyfriend, Johnny
Campbell, taped potato peels over the boy's eyes and hung him in
the closet, court records show.
   When Lattie was taken down the next day, Aug. 14, 1987, and
asked for water, Campbell told him to act like a man and get it
himself. Lattie tried, but, sapped of strength, failed. Campbell
punched him in the head, the records show.
   When Lattie didn't move, his mother called an ambulance. He was
pronounced dead on arrival at South Shore Hospital. Lattie weighed
26 pounds, the size of a normal 1-year-old.
   Dr. Shaku Teas, the pathologist who did the autopsy, was asked
by a prosecutor if she found anything remarkable about his injuries.
   ``Everything was remarkable,'' she said, describing his injuries
in gruesome detail as photographs of his body were shown in court.
   His pelvis had been broken several days before he died, and two
of his ribs had been snapped several weeks earlier, Ms. Teas
testified.
   Campbell, 40, pleaded guilty Dec. 6 to murdering Lattie and
beating the boy's brother, Cornelius Abraham, now 8. His attorney
says Campbell is psychotic.
   On Jan. 11, Getty convicted the children's 28-year-old mother,
Alicia Abraham, on the same charges; she acknowledged never
reporting the torture of her children but said she did not abuse
them herself.
   Prosecutors have urged Getty to order the pair executed for what
Assistant State's Attorney James Bigoness called ``a truly
abominable crime.''
   ``It's probably one of the ugliest cases you will ever see,''
said Clyde Lemons Jr., Ms. Abraham's attorney, who argued that she
was guilty of bad judgment but was not a murderer.
   Lavonne Steger, 18, whose parents cared for Ms. Abraham as a
child when her own parents died, still cries when talking about
Lattie. She considers Ms. Abraham her sister and often played with
the children when they were brought over for a visit.
   Cornelius liked to play basketball and read. Lattie was a quiet
boy with shining dark eyes and a sweet smile.
   ``He liked to go outside and play in the mud,'' Miss Steger said
in a telephone interview, her voice at times choking with emotion.
Other days, ``He just liked to watch cartoons and play with his
cars. He was happy.''
   Lattie was the second child born to Ms. Abraham. A small, stocky
woman, she dropped out of South Shore High School when she became
pregnant with Cornelius and had Lattie two years later. She never
married the boys' father, Lattie McGee Sr., an attendant at the
county's home for juvenile delinquents. The two were together five
years until splitting up in 1984, and she had two more children
with another man.
   McGee, who now has Cornelius, could not be reached to talk about
the case. Calls to his home went unanswered or were disconnected
when a reporter called.
   Unemployed and on public aid, Ms. Abraham was accused of neglect
in 1985 after state authorities found her living in a filthy
apartment with no furniture. Her sons slept on the floor and were
inadequately fed, court records show.
   Ms. Abraham underwent counseling. After months of supervision,
state investigators determined the situation had improved.
   But then she met Johnny Campbell, a short, fine-boned man with
powerfully muscled arms who said he was a Vietnam veteran and
ex-steel worker who'd been fired for alcohol and drug abuse.
   In early 1987, Campbell moved into the small apartment Ms.
Abraham shared with her four children on the top floor of a tidy
six-story brick apartment building in the South Shore district, a
black, mostly middle-class neighborhood along Chicago's southern
lakefront.
   Lattie's father, who kept in touch with his boys and has
attended court proceedings, last saw them in early June 1987 when
Cornelius graduated from kindergarten, Bigoness said. Both children
appeared healthy.
   Things quickly changed.

   The children were not allowed to go outside all summer, court
records show. Andrea Harbin, a neighbor, testified she heard the
boys crying ``mostly every day.''
   Their apartment, No. 612, had no furniture except a sofa. The
older boys' bedrooms were closets, their beds were cardboard, and
they were fed ``about once a week,'' Cornelius testified.
   In haunting testimony, the boy said ``J.G.'' had twice tied him
up with a rope and hung him upside down in the closet, once for two
days. He showed the judge scars on his shoulders he said were from
Campbell's burning cigarettes.
   Cornelius said Campbell had taken a hot iron and ``put it on my
brother's chest and he put that iron on my butt.''
   The boy said his mother was ``in the living room watching TV''
at the time.
   He told about seeing Campbell throw a screaming Lattie into a
bathtub of hot water, scrubbing the boy's skin with a rag ``and his
skin started peeling off.''
   He told of seeing Campbell tie Lattie's wrists to his ankles and
hang him upside down in the closet. Once, Cornelius said, his
mother helped tie up Lattie.
   Campbell had prior battery convictions and a history of mental
problems and said he drank a fifth of alcohol a day and often
free-based cocaine. He told authorities he beat the children
because he thought they were gay.
   ``I saw what they were doing. They were doing things like
swishing their butts and screaming like little girls, and snapping
their fingers ...,'' he told a psychiatrist in an interview
included in court records.
   ``I wanted to put him in the cupboard so he wouldn't do these
things,'' Campbell said. ``I figured that the pin holes would make
him stop.''

<HEAD>Downtown Resorts Cooperating to Lure Tourists to Casino District</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURA MYERS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RENO, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Competition has given way to cooperation for
Reno's hotel-casino owners, who hope to breathe new life into the
city's sluggish gaming business by building new shopping
attractions downtown.
   ``I remember when casinos, through checkerboarding, would hang
onto a little piece of property downtown just to prevent another
casino from building,'' said Buddy Frank, director of marketing and
advertising for the Fitzgeralds Group hotel-casinos.
   ``That doesn't happen anymore,'' he said.
   Patrick Cruzen, president of Reno's Flamingo Hilton
hotel-casino, agreed.
   ``I think part of the attitude of cooperation is people coming
together and saying, `If we really want to make this city grow then
we have to work together,''' he said.
   That attitude is focused today on development sites around the
Rio Grande Railroad's downtown tracks. Rio Grande decided to sell
the plots, which haven't been touched for 121 years, after a merger
with another railroad a few years ago.
   Fitzgeralds, Flamingo Hilton and two other casino groups have
purchased land bordering the tracks from Rio Grande in the past
year. They plan to spend millions to build retail shopping
facilities, parking and, in one case, more casino space, to lure
tourists who want other diversions to go with their blackjack and
slot machines.
   ``A large percentage of people who come here really want to go
shopping,'' said Pete Claudianos III, vice president of Sands,
which bought one of the development sites. ``Now, our customers are
having to ask how to get a city bus or a cab to Reno's malls.''
   The development sites straddle railroad tracks that cut through
the heart of the downtown casino district, home to almost all of
the city's more than 30 gaming houses.
   Tourists face steep odds of finding much to do other than gamble
downtown, though. J.C. Penney Co. has a store there along with F.W.
Woolworth, but they're joined by an array of small souvenir shops,
jewelry stores and pawn shops.
   Most of the city's 250,000 or so residents live outside the
downtown area and shop at two big suburban malls or other outlying
commercial areas.
   ``The few stores we do have downtown have real limited
selections and aren't the best of retail,'' Frank concedes.
   So Fitzgeralds has teamed up with a gaming competitor, Eldorado,
to buy a 2.32-acre parcel. They would like to build a retail mall
on the site that could include specialty shops, recreational and
sports facilities, a restaurant and parking, Frank says.
   ``We're in the process of doing public opinion polls right now
and don't have any firm plans, but it looks like the best thing for
that property is to develop non-gaming uses for it,'' Frank said.
   ``We're even talking about building skyways to connect the four
casino properties around the railroad tracks and keep people in the
area,'' he said.
   John Metzker, chairman of Fitzgeralds' Group, said two
feasibility studies should be finished by late March, allowing
final plans to be drawn.
   ``I view this development as mandatory if we want to continue
advancing our community,'' he said.
   The city could use a shot in the arm. Reno is the state's No. 2
tourist attraction after Las Vegas, attracting more than 7 million
visitors last year, according to the Reno-Sparks Convention and
Visitors Authority.
   But casino revenues have been sluggish, showing single-digit
growth in recent years compared with double-digit gains in southern
Nevada. And unlike Las Vegas, where a building boom has spawned
several new casinos, Reno hasn't seen a new casino go up in years,
although there has been a little expansion of existing facilities
in the last two years.
   The Sands has purchased a parcel the size of half a city block
adjacent to a hotel it is constructing. The company plans to build
a shopping center on the site with 40 specialty stores on two
levels and 1,000 parking spaces on upper floors, Claudianos said.
   The resort needs city approval for the development but could
finish the shopping center in 1991, he said.
   A block from the Sands parcel, the Flamingo Hilton has bought a
1.6-acre lot on which it plans to raise a 26-to-28-story,
1,100-room hotel and casino. Plans also call for a health spa,
outdoor pool and two restaurants at the site.
   The project is estimated to cost $80 million to $100 million and
take 22 months to complete, Cruzen said. The resort has obtained
government approval but its board of directors still must approve
the plans before construction can begin this spring, he added.

<HEAD>Creditors Want Hearings Delayed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN NOLAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Creditors of the Federated and Allied
retailing chains want a federal bankruptcy judge to delay hearings
scheduled this week on the companies' financing plans to operate
under Chapter 11 reorganization.
   A delay could threaten $700 million in bank financing the two
department store chains have arranged, which in turn could make it
difficult to keep store shelves stocked and cash registers ringing
while the companies try to sort out their debt problems under
bankruptcy court protection.
   The creditors filed the objections Monday and Tuesday with U.S.
Bankruptcy Judge J. Vincent Aug Jr. He has scheduled a hearing
Thursday to consider Federated Department Store Inc.'s financing
proposal and Friday on Allied Stores Corp.'s proposal.
   ``The primary objection is the lack of time we've had to
evaluate the structuring and financing of the proposal,'' said
Chicago lawyer Lewis Rosenbloom, representing unsecured creditors
of Federated.
   The creditors also said they need more information to assess the
proposed financing plans and how they would affect the long-term
business and financial prospects of Allied and Federated.
   The two Cincinnati-based companies represent the 260-store U.S.
retailing operations of Toronto-based Campeau Corp. Together they
employ about 100,000 people.
   Rosenbloom said Tuesday the creditors asked Aug to grant a delay
of at least 30 days to satisfy their concerns about how loans to
Federated and Allied would be structured and whether they might
hurt the companies' abilities to obtain loans from merchandise
suppliers or middlemen.
   Aug gave interim approval for the financing approvals on Jan.
25, and he told creditors' lawyers then that he intends to reach a
final decision on the financing as quickly as possible to help
ensure that Federated and Allied can continue operations to the
long-term benefit of creditors.
   The proposals include agreements under which Federated
negotiated a $400 million line of credit and Allied obtained
agreements for $300 million in financing.
   Lawyers for the Citibank-led consortium guaranteeing Federated's
financing said the alliance is committed to providing the financing
only if approval is obtained by Feb. 14. After that, the commitment
expires and there is no guarantee that banks could be found to
participate in a new agreement, said Harvey Miller, a lawyer for
Citibank.
   Miller said about 60 percent of the consortium's banks are
foreign and their managers do not necessarily understand the
bankruptcy reorganization procedure.
   Federated and Allied filed Jan. 15 for protection from creditors
under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Act while they develop a
plan to reorganize their finances. It was the largest such filing
in American retailing history.
   The companies are struggling under $7.5 billion in debt, most of
it accumulated when Campeau bought Federated in 1988 and Allied in
1986.
   Allen I. Questrom, the former Federated vice chairman hired
Friday from the Neiman-Marcus retailer as the new chairman and
chief executive officer of Federated and Allied, met Tuesday with
managers at the companies' Cincinnati headquarters. The bankruptcy
court last week approved the hiring of Questrom under a five-year
contract that will pay him $1.2 million annually.

<HEAD>BAT To Open Bidding For Field's and Saks Retail Chains</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Loyal customers and an upscale image make
Marshall Field and Co. attractive to those hoping to buy the
department store chain from BAT Industries Inc., retail analysts
say.
   ``Most Chicagoans fit it into their shopping on Sunday,'' said
George Rosenbaum, president of the Chicago-based research firm Leo
J. Shapiro Associates Inc.
   ``It's a store that doesn't have to win customers but a store
that can expand its business by selling more to customers it
already has,'' he said.
   At least half a dozen parties, including Field's management, are
expected to join the bidding for the 135-year-old retailer, which
has 24 stores in four states.
   The process begins Thursday when the investment firm Goldman
Sachs &amp; Co. hands out confidential prospectuses to would-be bidders
for both Field's and the larger Saks Fifth Avenue chain, according
to a spokeswoman for Batus Inc., a subsidiary of BAT headquartered
in Louisville, Ky.
   London-based BAT, Field's owners since 1982, hopes to announce
the winning bid sometime in May, the spokeswoman said Tuesday.
   Observers have estimated Field's will fetch $600 million to $1
billion.
   BAT shareholders in October approved a plan to sell the
company's U.S. retailing operations as part of a restructuring
designed to thwart a $21.7 billion hostile takeover bid led by
Anglo-French financier Sir James Goldsmith.
   Field's Chairman Philip B. Miller and May Department Stores Co.
have said publicly that they want to buy Field's. Others reportedly
interested in the chain include Dillard Department Stores Inc.,
Dayton Hudson Corp., JMB Realty Corp. and several U.S. investment
firms representing foreign money.
   The winner will get a thriving, determinedly upscale chain that
commands 15 percent of the crowded Chicago retail market despite
stiff competition from Bloomingdale's, Nieman-Marcus, Saks and
others.
   Retail analyst Robert F. Buchanan of Alex. Brown &amp; Sons Inc. in
Baltimore said the availability of Field's and Saks represent a
``brilliant opportunity'' for someone to become a clear leader in
the high-priced end of American retailing.
   ``There's going to be a lot of growth there in terms of buying
power through the end of this century,'' he said. ``It's going to
be a very fertile area of retailing.''
   Miller, who moved to Field's from the president's office of
Nieman-Marcus in 1983, has engineered a financial turnaround at
Field's, overseen an extensive remodeling of the company's flagship
store on State Street and expanded its reach into Ohio and Texas.
The company also has stores in Wisconsin.
   The prospective bid by Miller, in conjunction with a yet-to-be
identified partner or partners, has generated a good deal of
excitement here, fueling hopes that Field's will be returned to
local ownership.
   Miller declined to comment on the bidding but in an October
interview with the Chicago Tribune, he pledged to fight for control
of Field's.
   ``The worst scenario would be to have someone come in here and
treat it like any old department store and have it become just
another store,'' Miller said. ``This is clearly not what Chicago
wants or deserves.''
   In the interview, Miller said that under his leadership, Field's
annual sales have gone from about $650 million to more than $1.1
billion and annual profit has doubled to an estimated $90 million
in 1989 from $45 million in 1983.

   As heads roll during a recession on Wall Street,
highly paid professionals are searching for new jobs out of fear
their departments will be the next to get the ax.
   ``At all levels people are more willing to sit down and think
about what their options are,'' said Joan Zimmerman, executive vice
president at the executive search firm GZ Stephens Inc., which
places Wall Street executives.
   Headhunters report that resume and phone inquiries about
locating new jobs have zoomed in recent months. Amid growing
paranoia, Wall Street professionals are keeping their ears to the
ground for word of openings _ often for less money.
   ``A year ago, people still had this idea it was a God-given
right they make $300,000 a year. It's not the case (anymore),''
said Erica Henner, president of Henner Associates Inc., a
Chicago-based executive search firm.
   Since the October 1987 stock market crash, the securities
industry has lost about 35,000 jobs nationwide. In New York, Wall
Street employment is down to 145,000 from a peak of 163,000,
according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.
   Merrill Lynch &amp; Co., the nation's largest securities firm, is
cutting more than 3,000 jobs. No. 2 Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.
slashed 800 positions in December and has extended cuts into its
elite investment banking corps.
   ``People are going on more interviews than they were before,''
said a 26-year-old executive at a major Wall Street firm. ``You
just don't know. The cutbacks keep coming.''
   Following the roaring '80s that turned Wall Street into a river
of money, investment firms are damming up expenses, from fancy
dinners and travel budgets to unproductive workers and entire
departments.
   Personnel traditionally accounts for as much as 60 percent of
expenses at Wall Street firms, and industry officials said firms
are seeking to trim such costs through layoffs, lower salaries and
reduced bonuses.
   ``For the average guy there's some degree of panic and a lot of
caution,'' said Steven Littman, managing partner at the executive
search firm E.J. Rhodes Associates Inc.
   ``People are concerned about the stability of their future,''
said Littman, whose firm is receiving about five times as many
calls and resumes as six months ago. ``Business heads are falling,
things are changing and people are concerned about what's going to
happen over the next year or two.''
   Some Wall Street firms are taking advantage of the insecure
environment to upgrade departments by luring away talented
deal-makers, often for less money than in the mid-'80s.
   Lower 1989 bonuses have made some executives take job offers
more seriously, although the most sought-after still command higher
compensation when they jump firms.
   After reducing bloated sales and trading forces last year, the
latest cuts are in investment banking, which thrived on
multimillion-dollar fees in the takeover-mad 1980s but has fallen
on hard times with dwindling merger activity. Unlike the
money-driven '80s, many Wall Street pros are concerned about
quality of life and company stability. Investment bankers, for
instance, are joining second-tier or foreign-owned firms that
haven't had to shrink because they didn't expand with the reckless
abandon of major firms, recruiters said.
   ``There seems to be less loyalty these days. I think people are
concerned about their own welfare and not the firm's welfare,''
said Gary Goldstein, president of The Whitney Group, an executive
search firm.
   Brokerages also have scrapped computer development projects,
cutting programmers and technicians, while back-office workers who
process trading paperwork have been laid off as trading volume
declines.
   ``Since two years ago in October, our business has decreased
drastically,'' said Jack Talabisco, president of Botal Associates
Inc., a data processing search firm that now places about 10 people
a month compared with 40 in 1986-87.
   Jim Zamparelli, president of Cross Personnel Agency Inc., said
Wall Street firms are hiring more part-time back-office workers,
saving money on salaries and benefits. He said his firm gets 50 to
75 resumes daily.
   Despite the layoffs, times aren't that tough for executives who
still have jobs. Recruiters said investment bankers with several
years' experience are pulling in around $200,000 a year, down from
$400,000 or more in 1986-87. But drumming up business isn't easier.
   ``You know that if you're lucky enough to stay you're going to
be working harder for less pay,'' said a 28-year-old former vice
president whose job was eliminated in a reorganization at a major
firm late last year.
   He added that after several years of six-figure earnings,
``Learning to live on $50,000 a year is not that difficult.''

   Like other slumping Wall Street firms, Salomon
Inc. said its securities business was barely profitable in the 1989
fourth quarter while its commodities division recorded a loss.
   The first-tier Wall Street firm Tuesday said it managed to turn
a $68 million quarterly profit because of a strong performance by
its Phibro Energy oil refining and trading subsidiary, which
apparently benefited from a strong rise in oil prices during the
period.
   The earnings ended an up-and-down year for the securities giant,
which reported a record $28 million first-quarter loss, followed by
a record $253 million second-quarter profit and $177 million
third-quarter gain.
   In a year of weak performances across Wall Street, Salomon fared
better than some firms.
   Although Salomon didn't disclose details of its securities
trading, analysts said the firm absorbed large fourth-quarter
losses stemming from the stock market's Oct. 13 mini-crash and
declines in the value of its junk-bond portfolio.
   ``You put it all together and it was not a bad year'' compared
to the rest of the industry, said analyst Lawrence Eckenfelder of
Prudential Bache Securities Inc. ``But I certainly think investors
like to see more consistency.''
   Salomon took a beating during the market drop because it held
300,000 shares of UAL Corp., the airline company whose stock price
plunge after a takeover deal collapse that sparked the market
sell-off, Eckenfelder said.
   In addition, Salomon's $500 million portfolio of high-yield debt
securities was reduced in value because of a steady decline in the
junk-bond market beginning in September, he said.
   For the period ending Dec. 31, Salomon reported earnings of 42
cents a share. That compared with a loss of $38 million, or 42
cents a share, in the same 1988 quarter. Quarterly revenue rose to
$2.51 billion from $1.81 billion.
   Salomon's pre-tax earnings for the quarter totaled $81 million,
down sharply from $233 million in the 1988 period. Its Salomon
Brothers securities division reported $1 million in pre-tax
earnings and the energy segment $125 million, but commodities
recorded a $45 million loss.
   In the 1988 quarter, the securities segment made $81 million
before taxes and the commodities division $10 million. The energy
group reported quarterly pre-tax profits of $142 million a year
earlier.
   A $180 million after-tax charge to cover the cost of shifting
capital from Switzerland to the United States gave Salomon a net
loss in the 1988 quarter.
   For the full year, Salomon reported earnings of $470 million, or
$3.20 a share, up 68 percent from $280 million, or $1.63 a share,
in 1988. Revenue rose to $5.76 billion from $3.63 billion.
   Overall pre-tax earnings totaled $740 million, down from $753
million in 1988.
   The securities group made $490 million before taxes in the full
year, about level with $485 million in 1988. Salomon said lower
investment banking revenue, reflecting slower merger activity and a
drop in securities underwriting, was offset by revenue growth in
equities, government bonds and foreign exchange trading.
   The commodities division reported a pre-tax loss of $117 million
in 1989, compared with a $48 million profit in 1988. Salomon
attributed the loss to costs associated with discontinued
operations and first-quarter trading losses in non-ferrous metals.
   The energy segment made $367 million before taxes last year, up
from $220 million in 1988.

   The board of beleaguered Pan Am Corp. is still
considering possible combinations with several airlines, but no
decisions were made at its latest meeting, sources say.
   The airline's board of directors met Tuesday amid speculation
that it was ready to disclose a deal, possibly with Northwest
Airlines. The board finished for the day with no announcements,
however.
   The board held a regularly scheduled meeting Tuesday morning
that ended around noon EST, Pan Am spokeswoman Pamela Hanlon said.
She declined any further comment on the meeting and said Pan Am
didn't plan any announcements.
   Northwest spokesman Doug Miller in Eagan, Minn., said the
company, the nation's fourth-largest airline, would have no comment.
   Pan Am Chairman Tom Plaskett reiterated to the directors that
the airline must combine with another carrier to ensure its
survival. Northwest was mentioned as a possibility, as were other
airlines, said a source close to the situation, who asked not to be
identified.
   The directors were not asked to make any decisions, the source
said.
   William F. Genoese, director of the Teamsters' airline division,
said over the weekend that Pan Am management had leaked word that a
major announcement, probably a deal with Northwest, would come out
of the board meeting.
   Genoese said Tuesday that Pan Am still was trying to work out
``some sort of a merger arrangement'' with the larger Northwest. A
deal under discussion would cut Pan Am, the nation's eighth-largest
carrier, to one-third its size, Genoese said in a telephone
interview.
   He said Pan Am is seeking a joint marketing arrangement with
Northwest for the next five years, with the two carriers continuing
to operate independently under the umbrella of NWA Inc.,
Northwest's parent. After five years, ``a full merger might be put
into effect,'' Genoese said in a statement.
   ``Pan Am faces bankruptcy,'' the statement read. ``It is trying
to structure a business plan that would satisfy Northwest's
management and would also satisfy the banks, which would have to
provide financing.''
   Genoese said he was scheduled to meet with Plaskett on Thursday.
Ms. Hanlon would not confirm or deny that such a meeting was
planned.
   Pan Am shares finished down 12{ cents at $3.62{ a share on the
New York Stock Exchange. The stock surged 25 percent on Monday in a
rally market watchers attributed to Genoese's weekend comments.
   The two airlines have held discussions recently, but ``We're a
long way from a Northwest-Pan Am deal,'' said one source familiar
with the talks.
   Airline analysts cited rumors that, short of merging with
Northwest, Pan Am might sell some of its prized trans-Atlantic
routes or other assets to the carrier.
   New York-based Pan Am has lost nearly $2 billion since 1981 and
is saddled with $841 million in debt.
   Last February, Plaskett said the airline needed to merge with
another carrier in order to survive. Pan Am offered about $3.3
billion last May for NWA, but was outbid by a $3.65 billion offer
from a group led by investor Alfred Checchi.
   ``They have to do something one of these days,'' said Louis
Marckesano, an airline analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. in
Philadelphia. ``It probably would take some time to resolve.''

<HEAD>Lotus Opens Copyright Case, Shows Duplicate Systems</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JONATHAN YENKIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Three video screens sitting in a federal courtroom
became the first key witnesses in Lotus Development Corp.'s
copyright suit against two competing software companies.
   As Charles Sullivan, a Lotus product marketing manager, punched
out financial tables, first using the Lotus 1-2-3 spreadsheet
program and then the programs from the two competitors, the court
was faced with nearly identical images on each screen.
   Lotus is trying to prove that Paperback Software International,
of Berkeley, Calif., and Mosaic Software of Cambridge, copied its
popular 1-2-3 program.
   The case does not focus on the inner codes of the programs,
which experts agree fall under copyright protection, but instead
concentrates on the keyboard commands associated with the programs
and how the images appear on the screen.
   Lotus contends those elements _ known as the user interface _
signify the expression of an idea and are thus protected under
copyright laws. Legal experts, however, say this area of the law is
unclear.
   On Tuesday, Lotus representatives spent more than three hours
presenting computer displays as they opened their case. Three video
screens were installed so people in the courtroom could watch the
results of each command. U.S. District Judge Robert E. Keeton,
meanwhile, had his own private screens to monitor the proceedings.
   There were a few technical glitches, such as when one screen
broke down for several moments, forcing the judge to share his
screens with defense attorney Paul Gupta.
   Sullivan gave the court a basic lesson in organizing a
spreadsheet, placing sample financial results in various columns
and rows.
   He also demonstrated more complex functions, such as setting up
graphs and mortgage rate charts.
   ``I've done this 10,000 times before'' for prospective
customers, Sullivan said during a break. ``Obviously I've never
done it here before.''
   Sullivan then performed the same basic functions on the two
other screens, setting up a financial chart using Paperback
Software's VP-Planner program, and then with Mosaic's Twin Classic
program.
   Sullivan went through similar sequences of keystrokes and
commands, and the result was three screens sitting side by side,
showing identical arrangements of columns and rows for the 1-2-3,
VP-Planner and Twin Classic programs.
   The only significant difference between the two displays was
that the Lotus program had a menu of options _ such as ``file,''
``copy,'' and ``edit'' _ at the top of the screen, while the other
two programs had the menu at the bottom.
   In contrast, Lotus demonstrated another competing program,
Microsoft Excel, which required different commands.
   ``Basically I created the same spreadsheet as I did on 1-2-3,
but did it in a totally different manner,'' Sullivan said.
   But Gupta, representing Paperback Software, said after the
hearing that the comparison with Microsoft Excel was unfair because
that program operates on different types of hardware.
   Gupta planned to elaborate his points when he cross-examined
Sullivan on Thursday, when the attorneys also are scheduled to
present their opening arguments.
   Gupta contended that Tuesday's hearing demonstrated
``instructions for a machine rather than the expression of an
idea.''
   But in its court affidavits, Lotus countered that assertion,
saying the system of commands and screen images were the product of
careful thought.
   Mitchell Kapor, who was Lotus' founder and co-author of 1-2-3,
outlined in one affidavit how he helped develop the program and
decided upon each element.
   ``The choice of words selected to represent commands and their
organization in the menu tree, I believed, would be critical to the
success of the user interface, especially for the novice user,'' he
said.
   Lotus also provided statements from Bernard Galler, a professor
of electrical engineering at the University of Michigan, who said
the ``creation of the user interface requires the software
developer to make subjective choices, decisions and judgments.''
   Galler said the 1-2-3 program ``reflects one of many possible
models'' for spreadsheets, but the VP-Planner and Twin programs
virtually duplicate Lotus' product.
   Court affidavits filed by the defense included statements from
James Stephenson, the designer of VP-Planner.
   Stephenson said he was working on his program, and was taking an
approach similar to Lotus', before the commercial release of 1-2-3
in January 1983.
   But as the Lotus program grew in popularity, it became apparent
to Stephenson that his product, which was introduced in October
1985, should be compatible with 1-2-3.
   ``VP-Planner could not offer the functional attribute of macro
compatibility unless keystrokes entering the same letters or moving
the cursor to the same location would bring about the same
functional result as in Lotus 1-2-3,'' he said.

   A Hong Kong investment firm's battle for a
seat on the board of Cummins Engine Co. has moved to the nation's
capital with both sides seeking the hearts and minds of Congress.
   Industrial Equity (Pacific) Ltd., through its parent, New
Zealand's Brierley Investments Ltd., asked Rep. John D. Dingell,
D-Mich., to stay out of the fray until the outcome of a federal
lawsuit by Cummins.
   That request was included in a filing with the Securities and
Exchange Commission. Dingell has asked the SEC to review IEP's
dealings with Cummins.
   Dingell is chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee,
which oversees the securities industry _ particularly the SEC, its
federal regulator.
   Late last month, Indiana's congressional delegation wrote
Dingell asking him to request an SEC review of IEP's investment
activities with U.S. companies, including Cummins. IEP owns a
15-percent stake in the company.
   Without making specific allegations, the letter to Dingell said
``if IEP treats Cummins as it allegedly has several other U.S.
companies, a strong American business could be dismembered.''
   The congressional letter went on to describe IEP as ``a Hong
Kong corporate raider'' and ``an entity with a history of
greenmail.''
   Greenmail is the payment made by a company to buy back its own
stock _ at above-market prices _ from an unwanted suitor.
   But Brierley Chairman Bruce A. Hancox, in a letter of his own to
Dingell, said the Indiana delegation have been misled by ``false,
baseless and libelous allegations.''
   ``Cummins would have you believe that we invest for `short-term
plunder rather than long-term growth.' That is simply not so,'' he
wrote.
   Dingell asked the SEC and the Federal Trade Commission, which
oversees antitrust matters, to review the IEP actions, an Energy
and Commerce Committee staffer said.
   The staffer said the committee had not seen Hancox's letter, and
therefore could not comment.
   Cummins filed its suit against IEP at federal court in
Indianapolis last month after IEP sought a seat on Cummins'
15-member board.
   ``As one of 15 directors and the only non-U.S. director, I doubt
I would have posed a threat to corporate policy,'' Hancox said in
his letter to Dingell.
   In another filing with the SEC on Monday, IEP said it was
re-evaluating its Cummins holdings.

<DATELINE>ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Casino industry officials are trying
to put the best face on figures showing Atlantic City suffered the
first decline in visitors since gambling was legalized in 1978.
   ``This may just be a temporary hiatus or dip,'' said Steve
Richer, the president of the Atlantic City Convention &amp; Visitors
Bureau.
   Richer and industry analysts on Tuesday described the 3 percent
drop in annual visitors as the inevitable leveling-off of the
casino boom.
   ``I don't think it's drying up,'' said John Uphoff, a casino
analyst with Raymond James &amp; Associates in St. Petersburg, Fla.
``It's kind of getting a second wind, if you will.''
   The figures compiled by Anthony Marino, an Atlantic City
Expressway executive, show that 32.1 million people visited the
seaside resort last year, down from 33.1 million in 1988. The
number had risen steadily since the 7.0 million recorded in 1978,
the year Atlantic City's first casino opened.
   Blair Learn, a spokesman for the convention bureau, said the
figures include many repeat visitors. The actual numbers of people
who came last year range between 5 million and 6 million, Learn
estimated.
   Uphoff said the drop probably could be attributed to the opening
in November of Steve Wynn's Mirage casino in Las Vegas, Nev.
   In addition, he said potential visitors might be awaiting the
opening of Donald Trump's Taj Mahal casino _ to be the world's
largest _ this spring in Atlantic City.
   Uphoff predicted Atlantic City would rebound this year with the
introduction of the Taj Mahal and the ``lottery-type'' excitement
generated by a linked multi-casino progressive slots system known
as ``Megabucks.''
   The statistics show a 12 percent decline in the number of people
reaching the city by bus, a development Richer said he welcomed
because bus passengers typically stay for less than a day and do
not spend money outside the casinos. That compares poorly to Las
Vegas, which Richer said the average visitor stay is 2.7 days.
   Car travel rose last year from 17.8 million to 18.3 million and
air visitors increased from 440,000 to 523,000.
   The Casino Association of New Jersey, an industry trade group,
said the modest 2.6 percent growth in casino gross profits in 1989
and a peaking of drive-in customer levels point to a need to boost
air service to the city.

   An agreement with the federal government
to build a $660 million, clean-burning coal generator marks a step
toward easing the acid rain associated with high-sulfur coal, a
utility company executive says.
   American Electric Power Service Corp. announced Tuesday the
agreement with the U.S. Department of Energy to build a generator
that will have sharply reduced emissions of the substances that
cause acid rain.
   American Electric Power Co., AEP Service's parent company, is
the nation's largest buyer of coal.
   The project is part of the DOE's $5 billion Clean Coal
Technology Program, which aims to develop coal-burning generating
plants that reduce emissions of sulfer dioxide and nitrogen oxide
by as much as 95 percent compared with existing plants.
   The DOE has agreed to pay $185 million of the cost of building a
Pressurized Fluidized Bed Combustion Unit at American Electric
Power's 40-year-old Philip Sporn plant in New Haven, W.Va., the
utility said in a news release.
   ``Our goal is to demonstrate that PFBC is capable of helping the
nation meet its environmental goals more effectively than current
technology,'' said James J. Markowsky, senior vice president and
chief engineer of AEP Service, the management and technology arm of
American Electric Power.
   The project was outlined in a report by the DOE to Congress
Tuesday. Government funds for the plant can be granted following a
30-day congressional review, the department said.
   Pressurized fluidized bed combustion technology will allow the
Sporn plant to burn high-sulfur coal cleanly and boost the plant's
electric output, the DOE said. The project will replace two
conventional coal-fired boilers.
   The technology could be critical for American Electric Power,
which relies largely on coal to supply power to 7 million customers
in seven Midwestern and Appalachian states. Clean air legislation
pending in Washington could force the utility to cut its emissions
sharply in coming years.
   The project also has implications for the region's coal
industry, which mainly produces coal with a high sulfur content.
   A fluidized bed system captures acid-rain causing pollutants
inside the coal boiler as part of the combustion process.
   To capture sulfur gases, limestone is mixed with crushed coal
and fed into the boiler. As the coal burns, sulfur pollutants are
absorbed by the limestone and removed as solids from the bottom of
the boiler, the DOE said.
   Boilers using the process can burn coal at a lower temperature
than conventional boilers, which reduces nitrogen oxide emissions.
   When the refitting is finished, the Sporn plant will be the
world's largest pressurized fluidized bed plant, with a capacity of
330 megawatts. With conventional equipment, the Sporn plant
produced a maximum 300 megawatts of power, the DOE said.
   Testing at the Sporn plant is to begin in the summer of 1996.
The plant is jointly owned by the Ohio Power Co. and the
Appalachian Power Co., both wholly-owned subsidiaries of
Columbus-based American Electric Power.
   American Electric Power said it will begin operating a 70-watt
pressurized fluidized bed plant this year at Brilliant designed to
test the technology.
   The utility cautioned that its efforts to commercialize the
clean-burning technology could be hindered if Congress enacts clean
air legislation requiring utilities to fit scrubbers on existing
plants or retire plants early. It said it doesn't have the
resources to pursue both strategies.

   Mailing a love letter, paying the phone bill
and chewing out your congressman likely will cost more next year _
postage rates appear headed up again.
   The Postal Service is poised to launch the long, complex process
of raising prices on March 6.
   Postmaster General Anthony M. Frank says a 30-cent stamp seems
likely for first class mail in 1991, although the final price could
be from 28 cents to 32 cents. First class postage rose to the
current 25-cent rate on April 3, 1988.
   If things follow the normal course, the new charges would take
effect about 11 months after the filing, or in February 1991.
   Frank doesn't expect the new proposed raise to play well.
   Noting a 5-cent increase would be a 20 percent raise,
substantially above the 14 percent he projects that consumer prices
will have risen from 1988 to 1991, Frank said recently he was
``committed to paying back to the American people that 6 percent''
difference.
   To do that, he has pledged to keep future increases below the
inflation rate and said Tuesday, ``We may very well be able to hold
increases in rates after the 1991 adjustments to one more increase
in the balance of this century.''
   The Postal Service managed to operate about $404 million in the
black for the first quarter of this fiscal year, but the agency
expects a record $1.6 billion deficit for the full year ending
Sept. 30. The postal service is required to break even over the
long run.
   Frank has cited a number of reasons for the planned 1991 rate
increase.
   ``We were required in 1988 and 1989 to contribute $800 million
to deficit reduction even though we don't use a penny of tax money.
Health benefit costs are out of control _ a problem we share with
the private sector,'' he said.
   The first official step in raising rates will be taken March 6,
when the Postal Service's board of governors is to vote on the
proposed increase.
   The independent Postal Rate Commission then will ask for comment
_ that should produce tons of reports and appeals from various
interest groups _ and hold lengthy hearings before making its
recommendation.
   It then will be up to the Postal Service board to put the new
rate into effect.
   Frank's comments came in a Jan. 25 speech to the Economic Club
of Indianapolis. The Postal Service made a text of his remarks
available Thursday.
   Frank has said he wants to lengthen the period between rate
increases, but his efforts have been complicated by federal budget
woes. The Postal Service was separated from the federal government
in 1971 and its tax subsidies were eliminated.
   It was returned to the federal budget in the 1980s, when the
agency was showing a surplus. It then was taken back off the
federal budget, but was also required to take over some retirement
and medical payments for employees of the former U.S. Post Office,
at a cost of millions of dollars.
   While public attention focuses on the rates for first class
mail, the rate increase will cover all classes. Details on the
other proposed increases are not yet available, although those
increases are expected to spark opposition from advertisers,
charities and publishers of magazines and newspapers.
   Here is a rundown of the cost of mailing a first-class letter
since 1863, when the first flat rate was created at 2 cents per
half-ounce. In 1885 prices were set to cover a full ounce.
   July 1, 1885 _ 2 cents
   Nov. 3, 1917 _ 3 cents
   July 1, 1919 _ 2 cents
   July 6, 1932 _ 3 cents
   Aug. 1, 1958 _ 4 cents
   Jan. 7, 1963 _ 5 cents
   Jan. 7, 1968 _ 6 cents
   May 16, 1971 _ 8 cents
   March 2, 1974 _ 10 cents
   Dec. 31, 1975 _ 13 cents
   May 29, 1978 _ 15 cents
   March 22, 1981 _ 18 cents
   Nov. 1, 1981 _ 20 cents
   Feb. 17, 1985 _ 22 cents
   April 3, 1988 _ 25 cents

   The dollar was mixed in quiet trading early today
as European markets awaited the outcome of the Soviet Union's
Communist Party Central Committee meeting. Gold prices fell.
   Foreign currency dealers predicted the dollar would come under
pressure as soon as attention shifted from political factors to
economic ones.
   ``As soon as (Soviet President Mikhail) Gorbachev demonstrates
he has the internal situation under control, the dollar reverts to
its economic context,'' said a trader in Milan, Italy.
   ``In the economic context we have inferior interest rates
against the (West German) mark, limited economic growth and
inflation not really under control.''
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar rose 0.20 yen to a closing 145.10 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at a higher rate of 145.35 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Tuesday's
prices, included: 1.6570 West German marks, unchanged; 1.4798 Swiss
francs, up from 1.4770; 5.6422 French francs, up from 5.6405;
1.8710 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8680; 1,234.00 Italian lire, down
from 1,235.00; and 1.1892 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1874.
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost
$1.7022 to buy one pound, compared with $1.7015 late Tuesday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $419.50 a troy ounce,
down from $420.85 bid late Tuesday. At midmorning, the city's major
bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $419.90.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $419.90, down from $420.75 bid late
Tuesday.
   Gold in Hong Kong fell $1.72 to close at a bid $417.75.
   Silver fell in London to a bid price of $5.29 a troy ounce, down
from Tuesday's $5.31.

   The Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index plunged today
as government bond prices slumped, while the dollar edged up
against the Japanese yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 364.96 points, or 0.97
percent, closing at 37,301.87. It had gained 35.42 points Tuesday.
   ``The poor performance in the (Japanese) government bond market
made stock investors, especially institutional ones, step off to
the sidelines,'' said Kozo Hasunuma, a dealer with Yamaichi
Securities Co.
   While dealers made position adjustments, other investors sold
spot issues to collect profits from the price spread between the
future and spot markets, Hasunuma added.
   The Nikkei began falling as soon as Wednesday's trading opened
amid uncertainties over the U.S. government bond auction and the
Soviet Communist Party Central Committee meeting, said a Nomura
Securities analyst, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   He said many market participants expected Soviet leader Mikhail
S. Gorbachev's performance in the meeting to lead to further
reforms and stability, but ``they can't wipe out all the
uncertainties.''
   Meanwhile, Japanese reportedly bought 30-35 percent of the
three-year U.S. government bonds auctioned on Tuesday, but
uncertainties remained over the two remaining days of bidding for
10- and 30-year bonds.
   In currency dealings, the dollar closed at 145.10 yen, up 0.20
yen from Tuesday's 144.90-yen close. It opened at 145.18 yen, and
ranged between 145.03 yen and 145.34 yen. The dollar had fallen
0.70 yen on Tuesday after a five-day rise totaling 2.38 yen.
   ``The dollar-yen dealing was inactive in the absence of fresh
market-affecting news,'' said Kenzo Shinomiya, a trader with Fuji
Bank.
   Traders said investors were buying West German marks in
anticipation that Gorbachev's initiatives in the Soviet party
meeting would help maintain stability in Eastern Europe, expected
to benefit West German companies.
   Shinomiya said the currency market reacted positively to
Japanese purchases of three-year U.S. government bonds, but
Japanese investors were expected to buy fewer of the 10- and
30-year bonds. This would reduce demand for dollars to pay for the
bonds.

   World demand for oil is projected to increase in
the 1990s, but the OPEC nations will need financial help to meet
that need and avoid another oil crisis, the organization's general
secretary says.
   In an address to some 400 international energy industry
executives, Subroto said Tuesday the 13 members of the Organization
of Petroleum Exporting Countries will have to increase production
capacity to meet the projected demand for oil in this decade.
   While world demand for oil is projected to rise in the 1990s,
non-OPEC supply is expected to fall, Subroto said during a two-day
meeting on oil and gas strategies in the 1990s.
   Subroto said research by OPEC also indicates an oil crisis would
``come at the point when our organization no longer has the
production capacity to meet the rising level of demand.''
   ``Thus, there is a requirement to expand OPEC production
capacity rapidly,'' Subroto said.
   But such an increase will cost money, he said, and OPEC members
would financial assistance from non-OPEC parties in the
international oil market.
   ``We are, simply, talking about a level of expenditure well in
excess of our financial capabilities as a group of 13 developing
countries,'' said Subroto, who is from Indonesia.
   ``If we wish to avoid a crisis, we have no alternative course to
follow, for without an adequate _ and rapid _ expansion of
production capacity, there will sooner or later be a tightening of
supply and a rapid rise in prices, followed by years of severe
fluctuations in market behavior and considerable wastage of our
finite oil reserves,'' he said.
   But Subroto said the amount of money needed to raise production
capacity is ``indeterminable at this stage, and this requires a
detailed study in its own right.''
   He also called for increased communication, cooperation and
mutual trust and respect between OPEC members and non-OPEC parties.
   ``The atmosphere of confrontation, which for so long
characterized relations between OPEC producers and the consuming
countries, must be put firmly behind us,'' he said.
   In addition, he cautioned against implementing protectionist
measures on oil products.
   ``The introduction of discriminatory import levies and extra
taxes on oil products, to protect high-cost domestic energy
industries, or to reduce budget deficits, would make the goods of
such a country less competitive in international markets,'' he said.
   Meanwhile, the International Energy Agency estimated Tuesday
that OPEC slashed oil production last month but not enough to meet
its promised goal.
   The agency said the OPEC nations produced about 23.3 million
barrels of crude oil a day in January. That was about 700,000
barrels below December's peak levels but still well above the
22-million-barrel limit OPEC pledged late last year.
   OPEC ministers agreed in November to cut daily production to 22
million barrels for the first half of 1990. Although the ceiling
was 20.5 million barrels a day in the final quarter of 1989, actual
production had reached 24 million barrels a day in December boosted
by excess flow from Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab
Emirates.
   Analysts had expected OPEC members to rein in production even
more in January to try to meet the new limit, which was intended to
boost oil prices.

   The operators of a pesticide unit in a
highly populated valley have promised to notify officials of deadly
gas leaks after a release of of methyl isocyanate renewed debate
over chemical plant safety.
   The small amount of methyl isocyanate, the same gas that killed
3,500 people at Bhopal, India, escaped from Rhone-Poulenc's
Institute plant on Friday and injured seven contract workers. Plant
management thought the leak was of little significance and did not
report it until Monday.
   ``In the area of getting information to the public, it's very
clear that we misjudged the situation,'' plant manager Ron Bearer
said Tuesday at a special meeting called by Kanawha County
officials. ``To correct this situation in the future ... all
releases of acutely toxic materials, no matter how small, will be
communicated.''
   The Occupational Safety and Health Administration is
investigating to determine why workers were injured. Rhone-Poulenc,
which shut down the unit last Wednesday for a scheduled week of
maintenance, said it now would be closed indefinitely.
   Mark Wolford, Kanawha County's emergency services director, said
the county rather than the company would determine whether the
Kanawha Valley's 250,000 residents should be notified.
   ``When there is a product that is leaked that would impact on
the health of the community, we have to let the people know,''
Wolford said. He added, however, that the county also must not go
overboard with its alerts.
   The Rhone-Poulenc plant is a former Union Carbide operation and
includes the only true sister unit to a Carbide unit that leaked in
Bhopal in December 1984.
   In the five months after the Bhopal leak, Union Carbide shut
down the unit at Institute and installed millions of dollars worth
of safety equipment to prevent leaks. It sold the unit in December
1986.
   During a routine maintenance operation Friday, plant workers
trying to jar a stuck pipe lowered vacuum pressure designed to keep
the gas from escaping into the atmosphere. When they loosened the
pipe, a gust of methyl isocyanate blew past them.
   Bearer said it won't happen again.
   ``They were given the leeway to adjust the vacuum as required,''
he said. ``What we are doing now is going through and changing
those procedures. Clearly, we want to maintain a vacuum on there.
It's very important. It's a change that has to be made.''
   The Institute plant is 10 miles west of Charleston along West
Virginia's 15-mile-long Chemical Valley, which includes a string of
two dozen chemical plants.
   Methyl isocyanate is an ingredient in agricultural pesticides,
primarily the popular Temik. Rhone-Poulenc usually has 200,000
pounds on hand to convert to intermediate compounds, Bearer said.
   Union Carbide said the Bhopal leak occurred after saboteurs let
water into a storage tank, setting off a reaction. The Indian
government accused Carbide of shoddy workmanship. The parties
agreed to a $470 million settlement that a new Indian government is
seeking to void.

   Campeau Corp. is dismantling the
Cincinnati-based subsidiary that was to develop new shopping
centers around Federated and Allied department stores owned by
Campeau.
   Campeau Development Corp., created in September 1988, was to
build as many as 100 shopping centers, mostly joint ventures with
the Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. of Youngstown, Ohio.
   Federated Department Stores Inc. and Allied Stores Corp., based
in Cincinnati, filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11
of the U.S. Bankruptcy Act on Jan. 15 listing $7.5 billion in
liabilities.
   Federated Stores Inc., the holding company Toronto-based Campeau
formed for the retailers, has scuttled development plans, according
to FSI spokeswoman Carol Sanger.
   ``The CDC's function will be disbanded in three to six months,''
she said.
   Dissolving the developer will affect about 10 employees, but FSI
doesn't know whether it will lay them off or transfer them to new
posts, Ms. Sanger said.
   Campeau Corp. (Canada) will assume CDC's list of projects, which
includes a $400 million venture in downtown Columbus, Ohio, Ms.
Sanger said. The group's largest project was the $750 million
Boston Crossing project where an office, hotel and retail complex
was planned.

   The first joint manufacturing agreement between
two of the nation's Big Three automakers began like ``the mating of
porcupines,'' a Chrysler official said.
   Chrysler Corp. and General Motors Corp. announced the formation
Tuesday of New Venture Gear Inc., a Troy, Mich.-based company
operating two plants in New York state and Indiana.
   Big Three automakers have been involved in joint research
projects before, but never a manufacturing business.
   ``It began as if it were the mating of two porcupines,''
Chrysler Vice Chairman Gerald Greenwald said at a news conference.
``The agreement begins a new era for the American automobile
industry.''
   Greenwald and GM Executive Vice President William Hoglund said
no other joint venture between the two automakers or with Ford
Motor Co. was in the works.
   ``It has taken some time to bring us this far,'' Greenwald said.
   Each of the Big Three has joint vehicle manufacturing agreements
with other automakers, mainly Japanese. The GM-Chrysler
transmission proposal sailed through federal antitrust review,
prompting some critics to complain that the government wasn't
taking a strong enough role in regulating big business.
   Chrysler will own 64 percent and GM will own the rest of New
Venture Gear, which will have its headquarters in Troy. The new
company will operate plants in Muncie, Ind., and Syracuse, N.Y.,
and make manual transmissions and components.
   The Muncie plant now is operated by GM's Hydra-matic Division
and the Syracuse factory is run by Chrysler's Acustar subsidiary.
Combined, the factories employ about 3,100 people.
   The Muncie plant has been operating at about 40 percent capacity
recently and was in danger of closing, putting its 1,100 employees
out of work, said Tom Zimmer, general manager of GM's Hydra-matic
Division.
   The Syracuse plant was working at full capacity. Officials said
New Venture Gear was formed to fill out the Muncie plant's capacity
and ease the pressure on the Syracuse plant. No layoffs are
expected because of the joint venture.
   Jointly produced elements for manual car and truck transmissions
will roll off the lines next year.
   Representatives of both companies first met in April 1988, said
Zimmer. GM and Chrysler signed letters of intent to form the joint
venture last October.
   David Zimmer, president and chief executive officer of New
Venture Gear, said the current contracts between the two automakers
and the United Auto Workers union would remain in effect at the
plants until Sept. 14, when the union's agreements with each of the
Big Three end.
   David Zimmer, no relation to Tom Zimmer, said the company
planned to negotiate its own contract with the UAW.

<TEXT>
   The West German government today created a
committee to prepare for eventual German reunification and agreed
to pursue immediate talks with East Germany on using a single
currency.
   Rudolf Seiters, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's chief of staff, said
the select committee began its work today under the chancellor's
leadership. Other panel members include Cabinet ministers in Kohl's
government.
   Seiters said the panel will examine all the steps and decisions
necessary for unification, including creation of a monetary union,
East German economic reforms and legal questions, as well as issues
of foreign policy and security.
   West Germany will discuss ``confederative cooperation'' with
East Germany after East Germany's first free elections on March 18,
Seiters said.
   He made the announcement after Kohl's Cabinet met to hear the
chancellor's proposal for urgent talks with East Germany on uniting
the two nations' currencies, which would be a giant leap toward
reunification. A monetary union would make the West German mark
East Germany's currency and turn over much of East Germany's
economic sovereignty to West Germany and its central bank.
   Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann said a ``German-German
economic miracle'' like the one that made West Germany wealthy is
possible as the two countries draw closer together, but that much
work needs to be done.
   Kohl, under domestic pressure to relieve the influx of thousands
of East Germans seeking better jobs and housing in the West, said
Tuesday: ``People in East Germany must see now that citizens of
West Germany are ready to help.''
   Nonetheless, new signs are emerging that both German states may
have to make huge sacrifices to rescue East Germany's ailing
economy.
   A newspaper quoted officials as saying that under reunification,
West Germany would have to pay billions to salvage East Germany's
economy.
   In East Berlin today, three leftist opposition movements agreed
to join forces and campaign as a coalition for East Germany's March
18 elections, said the ADN news agency. The three are New Forum,
Democracy Now and the Initiative for Peace and Human Rights, said
ADN. New Forum is East Germany's best-known pro-democracy movement.
   Three conservative opposition groups, including the Democratic
Awakening, also have joined forces for East Germany's first free
elections.
   Also today, authorities said ousted East German Communist Party
leader Erich Honecker, who faces charges of high treason, will be
tried together with three of his former lieutenants before the
country's Supreme Court next month.
   Lother Reuter, deputy attorney general, said the four face
charges including ``blatant human rights violations,'' ``complete
hindrance of media freedom'' and ``deformation of the people's
economy.''
   Kohl said details for talks with East Germany on reunification
would be worked out when Premier Hans Modrow of East Germany visits
Bonn next week.
   Kohl did not give a deadline for the monetary union, but
government sources said on condition of anonymity that Kohl shared
Finance Minister Theodor Waigel's view that it should come before
the end of the year.
   The newspaper Bild said Waigel wants East Germans to be able to
exchange their currency for West German marks at a 1-1 ratio. The
current official rate is three East marks for one West mark.
   But Waigel also expects the process of creating a free-market
economy in East Germany will result in a huge loss of jobs until
new positions under new economic conditions can be created, Bild
reported.
   According to Bild, Waigel is proposing that West Germany pay out
unemployment benefits to East Germans left jobless by economic
overhaul and has estimated that would cost $6 billion annually.
   Helmut Geiger, head of the West German Savings Bank Association,
said monetary union would cost the West Germans a ``double-digit
billion-mark sum.''
   He said that would probably lead to tax increases in West
Germany, higher budget deficits and an end to talk of shorter work
weeks.
   The head of West Germany's central bank, Karl Otto Poehl, also
has voiced reservations about a speedy monetary union.
   East German officials, while acknowledging that sharing the same
currency could ease some immediate problems, generally have
resisted such a move because of fears that it would erode the value
of East German savings.
   They also fear that unprofitable, state enterprises would have
to close, forcing large layoffs.
   An accelerating exodus to West Germany, strikes and absenteeism
are driving East Germany's economy toward the brink of collapse.

   The stock market was broadly lower in early
trading today, pressured by ongoing concerns about this week's
Treasury's refunding.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was down 20.27 points to
2,586.04 at 10 a.m. EST, 30 minutes after the opening bell.
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a margin of nearly 5
to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange, with 835 issues down, 178 up
and 378 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 24.08 million shares.
   Analysts said weakness in the bond market kept stocks under
pressure. The market's worries stem from the Treasury's quarterly
refunding auction and whether yields will have to be forced higher
to attract Japanese investors.
   The three-day auction, which began on Tuesday, comprises $30
billion in notes and bonds. Tuesday's refunding included $10
billion of three-year notes. Today's refunding will include $10
billion in 10-year notes and the final part on Thursday will
comprise $10 billion of 30-year Treasury bonds.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was
down 1.47 at 180.86.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index stood at

   On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average fell 16.21 to

<HEAD>Is New England a Flashback To Texas?</HEAD>

   In June 1988, U.S. Comptroller of the Currency
Robert L. Clarke told banks that aggressive uncontrolled expansion
can lead to deep trouble.
   ``Growth for growth's sake, or growth without the resources to
back it up, is a highly risky strategy because it leaves the bank
exposed when the economy turns down,'' he said.
   Those words read like an epitaph for the Texas banking industry,
where eight of the 10 largest holding companies were failing,
crushed by awesome credit losses during a bust in the oil economy.
   But up in New England, Clarke's message was a prophecy of things
to come.
   Banks caught in the euphoria of a construction boom have watched
the economy turn sour. The real estate market has tumbled, giving
banks a staggering amount of bad loans and putting one of the
region's largest banks _ Bank of New England Corp. _ in a fight for
survival.
   These troubles echo the story in Texas, but analysts say New
England should not have a repeat performance, even though bankers
apparently failed to learn from mistakes made in the Southwest.
   ``I suppose they thought it could happen to dumb Texans, but not
happen to wise, conservative Yankees,'' said L. William Seidman,
chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. ``Poor management
shows up when the economy goes bad.''
   The New England banking industry in recent months has resembled
an infirmary's list of wounded.
   Among the nine states that showed the biggest increases in
troubled real estate loans from December 1988 to last September,
six were in New England, industry estimates show.
   Bank of Boston Corp., the region's largest bank, reported a
record $125 million loss for the third quarter of 1989, and for the
year it had a 78 percent drop in earnings.
   Bank of New England said osses in 1989 should surpass $1
billion, and it is trying to sell $6 billion in assets.
   Analysts say Bank of New England has been one of the biggest
victims of the regional real estate slump, since it competed
aggressively to make construction loans earlier in the 1980s,
sacrificing sound credit policies in order to build its empire.
   The eagerness shown by Bank of New England and other banks to
lend their money for construction projects is one of the biggest
similarities to what happened in Texas, experts say.
   The economies in both regions had been robust; in Texas the
driving force was oil and energy while in New England it was
largely the high-tech and defense industries.
   The growth in these economies fueled rapid buildups in office
space and housing, providing a quick avenue for banks to boost
assets by making construction loans. In both cases, however, this
led to excessive speculation by developers, which resulted in
overbuilding.
   Thus, as the Texas economy, and then the New England economy,
began to slide, building projects had trouble finding tenants,
developers couldn't make loan payments, and the banks lost money.
   ``It was one big party,'' said Gerard Cassidy, a banking analyst
with Tucker Anthony Inc. in Portland, Maine. ``Then the party
stopped, and now the hangover started.''
   ``There were projects built that should have never been built,
no question,'' said Leo Spang, senior vice president of commercial
real estate at Shawmut Bank in Boston.
   But Spang said the trouble is more manageable in New England,
partly because the economy is more diversified and there simply was
much less speculation.
   Analysts agree with that assessment, and they say New England
should not experience the flurry of bank closings similar to what
occurred in Texas.
   ``The Texas debacle was so much greater in size and magnitude,''
Cassidy said. But he added: ``There are too many similarities to
rule out that New England will become another Texas.''
   Banks in Texas and in New England each made the same mistake in
judgment, said Alex Sheshunoff, president of Sheshunoff &amp; Co., a
banking information and consulting firm in Austin, Texas.
   ``They underestimated the capacity of builders to overbuild,''
he said. ``As the phrase goes, `The demand was for a million square
feet of space, and 10 developers went out and built it.'''
   Some banks in New England showed more restraint.
   Fleet-Norstar Financial Group Inc. in Providence, R.I., for
example, quit making loans for condominiums about three years ago,
said Robert Lougee, a company spokesman.
   The condo market, in particular, has been a major source of
troubled loans, but at Fleet-Norstar ``there were obviously some
who saw overdevelopment going on,'' Lougee said.
   He noted, however, that banking officials foresaw a downturn in
the real estate market based on their own experiences, not on any
lessons from Texas.
   ``It's sort of the history of finance,'' said Robert Litan, a
banking expert with the Brookings Institution in Washington. ``No
one learns from the last disaster, especially when they didn't have
any part in it.''
   The federal government, though, appears to have learned from the
Texas experience, and analysts say regulators have been more swift
to crack down on New England banks.
   ``Here it's taking (regulators) only several weeks to realize
what's going on,'' said Mas Kakutani, a banking analyst with
Moody's Investors Service Inc. in New York. ``The deterioration of
New England banks has been more severe than anything we saw in
Texas, in terms of quickness.''
   ``We are certainly trying to reflect some of the lessons learned
from Texas,'' said Seidman at the FDIC.
   Seidman said regulators were taking a cautious look at New
England before the serious problems surfaced, and he said officials
in the future will pay closest attention to banks that grow the
fastest.
   ``Once bitten, twice shy,'' he said.

<HEAD>Existing Home Sales Rose in Last Quarter of 1989</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: CORRECTS 6th graf, The Realtors, to make increase of 4.3

   Sales of existing homes, responding to lower
interest rates and weaker prices in some areas, rose 2.1 percent
during the fourth quarter of 1989 but were still down 4.3 percent
for the year as a whole, a real estate trade group said today.
   The National Association of Realtors said sales totaled a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.85 million units during the
October-December period.
   Sales for the year, which were buffeted in the first half by
double-digit mortgage interest rates, fell to 3.78 million units
from 3.95 million in 1988. After rates peaked in March and dropped
into the single digits in July, sales perked up in the final two
quarters.
   Realtors President Norman D. Flynn said the 1990 housing market
is expected to be much like 1989 _ strong in some areas, average in
others and sluggish in parts of the nation where the economy is
weak.
   Sales include single-family detached homes, town houses,
apartment condominiums and cooperatives.
   The Realtors said the national median price of existing homes
rose 4.6 percent to $92,800 during the fourth quarter of 1989 and
were up 4.3 percent, to $93,100, for the year. The median means
half of the homes cost more and half cost less.
   Honolulu had the highest fourth-quarter median price for a home,
$280,900, compared with $47,200 in Peoria, Ill.
   Twenty-nine states had sales increases in the fourth quarter,
ranging from a 0.9 percent gain in Hawaii to a 30.5 percent hike in
Vermont.
   Only the Northeast and the Midwest posted sales growths below
the national average of 2.1 percent in the October-December period.
Sales were down 2.6 percent in the Northeast to an annual rate of
701,000 units while they rose 1 percent to 1.04 million units in
the Midwest.
   Sales were up 2.8 percent to an annual rate of 1.45 million in
the South and 8.2 percent to 660,000 in the West, the Realtors said.
   The West also had the biggest jump in median prices, a 9 percent
advance to $141,600, in the fourth quarter 1988. It was followed by
gains of 5.9 percent to $71,700 in the Midwest, 4.3 percent to
$83,100 in the South and 0.9 percent to $144,000 in the Northeast.
   In addition to Hawaii, three other Western areas held the top
median prices in the quarter. The San Francisco Bay area was second
with a $260,600 median price, followed by Orange County, $247,900,
and Los Angeles, $217,000.
   For the decade, median existing home prices rose 49.7 percent,
from $62,200 to $93,100.

   Stock prices bounced back from earlier lows but
remained mixed as investors continued to focus on today's Treasury
refunding.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 1.57 points to
2,607.88 at 11 a.m. EST. The blue-chip indicator was 20.27 points
lower an hour earlier.
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a margin of about 9 to
5 on the New York Stock Exchange, with 737 issues down, 404 up and
515 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 56.94 million shares.
   Analysts said blue-chip stocks were reviving, led by sharp gains
in IBM issues, although weakness in the bond market continued to
pressure stocks.
   ``The trend is back to more positive,'' said Dennis Jarrett,
technical analyst for Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. ``People are starting
to discount what's going on with the refunding.''
   The market's worries stem from the Treasury's quarterly auction
and concerns about whether yields will have to be forced higher to
attract Japanese investors. Although Tuesday's $10 billion auction
of three-year notes was considered successful, analysts said
concerns persisted that Tuesday's activity might run out of steam
for today's $10 billion sale of 10-year notes.
   The final auction on Thursday will comprise $10 billion of
30-year Treasury bonds.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was
down 0.24 at 182.09.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index was off
0.13 at 354.61.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Advance In Early Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices were slightly
higher in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade,
reflecting stronger cash markets for soybeans and improved foreign
demand for U.S. grains.
   Broadly underpinning the gains were reports that Communist Party
leaders in the Soviet Union have approved sweeping political
reforms recommended by their leader, Mikhail Gorbachev.
   The Soviets' swing toward democracy is seen as increasing the
chances the United States will grant most-favored-trade status to
the Soviet Union, which could lead to bigger grain deals with the
United States.
   A slowdown in farmer selling is helping to boost soybean
futures, as is an increase in soybean meal demand in Europe,
analysts said.
   Signs of stronger export demand for corn are helping corn prices
while wheat is gaining amid indications of a sale of U.S. wheat to
Egypt.
   In early trading, wheat futures prices were \ cent to } cent
higher with the contract for delivery in March at $3.83{ a bushel;
corn was unchanged to } cent higher with March at $2.38{ a bushel;
oats were { cent to 1 cent higher with March at $1.36 a bushel;
soybeans were 1 cent to 1} cents higher with March at $5.64{ a
bushel.
   Cattle futures were narrowly mixed in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange while pork futures were mostly higher.
   Live cattle futures were .20 cent lower to .15 cent higher with
February at 79.50 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent lower
to .05 cent higher with March at 82.72 cents a pound; live hogs
were .18 cent lower to .30 cent higher with February at 49.02 cents
a pound; frozen pork bellies were .03 cent to .25 cent higher with
February at 50.70 cents a pound.
   Cattle futures settled mixed on Tuesday; pork bellies were
mostly lower.

   Georgia Gulf Corp. said Wednesday it scheduled a
meeting April 19 for shareholders to vote on a recapitalization
plan intended to discourage a takeover by Texas investor Harold C.
Simmons.
   NL Industries Inc., a Houston-based chemical supplier controlled
by Simmons, has launched a $1.1 billion tender offer for Georgia
Gulf despite the proposed recapitalization.
   The Atlanta commodity chemical maker said shareholders of record
Feb. 18 will be eligible to vote on the proposal, valued by the
company at $55 a share. NL's offer is $45 a share.
   Georgia Gulf stock was up 25 cents a share to $41.75 in early
New York Stock Exchange trading today.
   In January, Georgia Gulf announced the recapitalization proposal
after months of speculation over Simmons' intent. He owns about 9
percent of Georgia Gulf and had indicated an interest in boosting
the value of his investment.
   The proposed recapitalization had been regarded by Wall Street
analysts as a move to placate Simmons by paying a special dividend
of more than $50 a share. A recapitalization generally involves a
company borrowing a large sum of money to pay shareholders a
special dividend or to expand the company.
   Georgia Gulf Chairman James R. Kuse earlier this week appealed
to stockholders to delay making a decision on NL's buyout offer
until the company's management reviews the bid and makes a
recommendation.

<NOTE>Eds: New material, editing throughout with today's testimony.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chairman of the Senate Agriculture
Committee criticized the Bush administration today for not
recommending specific price support levels and other spending
details in its 1990 farm bill proposal.
   ``We can't write a farm bill without an idea of what the
administration wants,'' Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., told Agriculture
Secretary Clayton Yeutter at a hearing of the agriculture
committee. ``I want specifics.''
   Yeutter said he would immediately start negotiations over
spending with the committee if Leahy desired. But he said he
thought such talks should be in a private setting, instead of a
public hearing.
   ``The administration will not declare today what it's position
is on target prices,'' said Yeutter.
   He noted that the fiscal 1991 budget called for $10.2 billion
overall for target prices, but would not say how the money should
be distributed. He also refused to suggest target price amounts for
the other four years of the five-year farm bill.
   Leahy said the administration was putting Congress in a ``damned
if you do, damned if you don't position'' on spending.
   Yeutter said he preferred to work it out with the committee so
he would not be alone in sticking out his neck.
   ``I want to make sure there are 20 necks there instead of just
one,'' he said.
   ``This document doesn't deal with budget, it deals with
policy,'' Yeutter told a news conference Tuesday in unveiling
proposals for the 1990 farm bill.
   ``I see no reason why we should not be able to provide net farm
income that would give a very satisfactory standard of living to
farmers even though the federal contribution will decline,'' he
said.
   Leahy said there were positive aspects in Yeutter's proposals,
such as planting flexibility and emergency food aid programs.
   But, he said, ``the administration still refuses to actively
help farmers cut pesticide and chemical use.''
   Shortly before Yeutter unveiled his proposals, 11 national
consumer and environmental groups released a report outlining
certain environmental objectives they want incorporated into the
next farm bill.
   ``The public is demanding that we protect our environment and
safeguard our food supply,'' said Sen. Wyche Fowler, D-Ga., an
Agriculture Committee member who spoke at a press conference with
the coalition.
   He said the nation needs ``a stronger and less begrudging
commitment to integrated pest management, low-input farming and
other promising alternatives in USDA research and extension
programs than we have seen up to now.''
   Leahy said in a statement that proposals by the organizations
``will be an important part of the debate over the 1990 farm bill
and will be taken seriously.''
   The groups offered suggestions for preserving water quality,
wetlands and fertile soil and promoted incentives for
``sustainable'' agriculture, a farming method that avoids extensive
use of chemicals.
   Yeutter also offered groundwater proposals and said the planting
flexibility he would like in the new legislation should please
those promoting sustainable agriculture, which uses crop rotation
among other methods to protect the environment.
   House Agriculture Committee Chairman Kika de la Garza, D-Texas,
played down the importance of the administration proposals. He and
Rep. Edward Madigan, R-Ill. introduced their farm bill Monday.
   De la Garza said the administration proposals ``may have an
impact as we deliberate our bill. There are no items in our bill
and the administration proposals that cannot be worked out.''
   Highlights of Yeutter's recommendations include:
   _A ``normal crop acreage'' concept to allow farmers to plant
crops based on market demand without loss of farm program benefits.
It would define crops that could be substituted for program crops,
authorize crop-specific acreage reduction programs and provide
authority to plant on idled acres in exchange for giving up
specified deficiency payments.
   _Replacing crop insurance with a new crop disaster resistance
program patterned after the ad hoc disaster legislation passed in
1988 and 1989 following the drought. It would eliminate need for
such ad hoc bills, Yeutter said.
   _A grain reserves and stocks policy based on annual contracts
that give the farmer more say in when stocks should be released
into the marketplace.
   _Making the trigger for acreage reduction programs more
consistent with market and farmer needs.
   _Extending the loan rate formula for wheat and feedgrains to
upland cotton, extra longstaple cotton and rice. The 1985 loan rate
formula for soybeans also would be extended.
   _Incentives to use perennial cover crops on set-aside acreage as
a means to naturally improve soil fertility.
   _Methods for cutting down fraud in use of food stamps; grants to
organizations that test innovative ways to get food stamps to the
homeless.

<HEAD>Anheuser-Busch Income Falls on Price Discounts But Firm Picks Up
Market Share</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Anheuser-Busch Cos. Inc. said Wednesday its
recently announced discount program held fourth-quarter earnings to
a 2 percent increase, but the move helped the company improve its
share of the national beer market share by a full point.
   Earnings for the fourth quarter were $128.1 million, or 45 cents
per share, on sales of $2.49 billion, compared with earnings of
$125.5 million, or 44 cents per share, on sales of $2.37 billion in
the same period a year ago.
   August A. Busch III, chairman and president, said that as a
result of the price discounting program, beer sales grew by 2.2
million barrels in 1989, widening the company's lead over its
nearest competitor by 700,000 barrels and increasing its market
share by one point to 42.1 percent.
   ``Our volume increased by 2.8 percent, reaching a total of 80.7
million barrels during the year,'' said Busch. ``Our growth rate
gave us a larger volume and market share increase than any other
brewer.''
   Busch acknowledged that fourth quarter earnings were affected by
the discounting program, but he said increases in sales to
retailers were encouraging.
   ``We anticipate that our long-term market share growth strategy
will ultimately pay off in an even stronger market position and in
higher earnings for the company and its wholesalers,'' he said.
   Earnings for the full year reached $767.2 million, or $2.68 per
share, on sales of $10.28 billion, up from earnings of $715.9
million, or $2.45 per share, on sales of $9.71 billion in 1988.
   Busch said the company's goals in the next five years are to
increase beer wolume to achieve a 50 percent market share and to
further expand its non-beer profit base with additional investments.
   Anheuser-Busch, the world's largest brewer, has led the industry
in sales every year since 1957.

<HEAD>Locking In Dividends</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While many conservative investors are chasing
interest rates in the bond and CD markets, a lesser publicized
group is loading up on corporate dividends.
   Surprisingly, the dividend rates of some pretty solid companies
equal and sometimes exceed rates available from bonds and
certificates of deposit.
   Among them: General Motors and Ford Motor at better than 7
percent, Manufacturers Hanover Bank at about 10, Great Northern
Iron about 9, Perkins Family Restaurants at 8, Occidental
Petroleum, nearly 9.
   Lesser known, but often higher paying, are several investment
trusts. For example, the Massachusetts Financial Service's
Multimarket Income Trust and the Hancock Investment Trust both
offer about 10 percent.
   Meanwhile, U.S. Treasury debt securities, super-safe
investments, generally are in the range of about 8.5 percent,
high-grade corporate bonds about 9 percent or slightly more, and
tax-exempts around 7.
   While some advisers recommend locking-in the current yields on
bonds before _ and if _ they rise in price, the same advice can be
given for dividends. Stocks too can rise, sometimes sharply, adding
to the investor's total return.
   In fact, based on long-term records, some stocks paying high
dividends may also be underpriced. General Motors, for example, is
selling at between six and seven times earnings, and Ford only four
times, well below market averages.
   The reason dividends get overlooked has a good deal to do with
the changing nature of the market. Decades ago, the level of
dividends was often the primary consideration among investors. That
was before the go-go days.
   In the past two decades, market advisers have tended to
emphasize short-term price performance _ to look for takeover
candidates, for stocks that might rise with the introduction of new
products, for companies with sudden earnings increases. In such an
atmosphere, long-term dividend prospects count little.
   Rather pallid looking dividend payments didn't help, especially
in the stock market boom following the early-1980s recession. In
1978 and 1979, dividends averaged 6 percent, but since 1986 they've
averaged under 4 percent.
   Averages always permit exceptions, however, and included in the
exceptions are companies that appear underpriced by long-term
standards. Should they rise in price, there is a chance the
dividends might even increase.
   However, even if the dividends do not increase, the price of the
stock might.
   International Business Machines, for example, offers a dividend
yield at just under 5 percent. It is also selling at 15 times
earnings, well below its norm. Should it return to form, current
owners would have locked in both a solid dividend _ plus a hefty
return from the appreciated value of their stock.
   Nobody knows what the future holds, but there is a sense in Wall
Street and other investment centers that the emphasis might return
to longer-term performance and that investors might be ready to
re-emphasize fundamentals.
   If so, it is possible that you might hear ordinary investors
listening for tips about overlooked companies with solid earnings
and solid dividends. In short, what investors used to look for
before the swingers moved in.

<HEAD>Electronic Filing Speeds Refund Process, But You Pay Extra</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIVIAN MARINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If you're tired of waiting the usual six to
eight weeks for your income tax refund, Uncle Sam will gladly let
you cut in line, but the privilege costs money.
   The Internal Revenue Service has expanded its electronic tax
filing system nationally this year, allowing anyone due a refund _
or about 70 percent of the 110 million expected returns _ to file
directly into the government's computers. Those owing money can't
participate.
   Last year, 36 states were plugged into the system, up from 14
states the previous year and three cities when it was first tested
in 1986.
   The IRS says the high-tech approach will save an over-burdened
agency about $200 million in processing costs over 10 years and
substantially reduce errors. That will mean speedier refunds for
taxpayers filing electronically _ about three weeks, vs. the usual
six to eight weeks from filing the old-fashioned way by mail, tax
experts say. Those choosing to receive their refund through direct
bank deposit can expect the money in about two weeks.
   But like anything else the taxpayer must pay for this
efficiency. Many accountants warn that unless you're expecting a
refund well into four figures, it may not be worth it.
   ``The economics are clearly not there for some people,'' said
Stephen Corrick, a tax partner for the accounting firm Arthur
Andersen &amp; Co. ``It's also not for people with complicated
returns.''
   The IRS's embrace of pre-approved electronic filing has spawned
a new type of accounting service that will transmit your return via
computer for a fee. Individuals can't use personal computers to
file directly on their own yet.
   Filing fees range from around $20 to $50, with costs usually
lower for individuals whose returns are prepared by the same
services. Many companies will advance you the return within days
for an additional $30 to $35 fee.
   For those needing money in a hurry or without available credit
lines it may be worth paying the added expense.
   ``(But) you have to ask yourself what is the time value of the
interest associated with my getting the refund,'' said Richard H.
Lager, a managing partner with the Grant Thornton accounting firm.
   For example, if you invested a $1,000 refund check in a money
market account at 9 percent interest, that interest compounded
annually would amount to only $7.50 a month. It's probably a lot
cheaper to get a one-month cash advance from your credit card _
even at the 18 percent interest _ than to pay the fee of the
electronic filer, Lager said.
   Kansas City, Mo.-based H&amp;R Block Inc. is clearly the largest of
the nation's tax preparers to participate in the program. Last year
it filed 70 percent of the 1.2 million returns sent electronically,
said Harry Buckley, president of H&amp;R Block's tax preparations
division.
   In addition, niche companies, such as San Diego, Calif.-based
InstaTax, have set up thousands of storefronts nationwide in which
consumers can fax their forms to a data processing center, which,
in turn, enters the return immediately on a computer connected to
the IRS.
   Customers who use these services still have to send out a short
form, which is their proof of signature, and attach their their W-2
forms and other documentation.
   Some electronic tax filing services accept floppy disks or
direct transmission from an individual's personal computer.
Store-bought programs such as McInTax will do the arithmetic.
   PC-users may some day be able to file directly on their own, but
IRS spokesman Frank Keith that's a long time away since the
technology is not quite there yet.
   This year, though, the IRS is working with a handful of banks in
the Boston area testing how taxpayers who owe money can file
electronically and have the amount deducted from their accounts,
Keith said.
   For now, the IRS is promoting its refund electronic filing
system, offering lists of accountants and companies hooked into its
computer for those calling a toll-free number.
   As of Feb. 1, the IRS received 608,350 electronic returns, about
8 percent of all the returns received so far. Keith says the agency
predicts it will get at least 2 million electronic return this tax
season, up from 1.2 million for 1989. Only 25,000 were received
when the program began four years ago.
   By the end of the century, the IRS predicts that at least 30
percent of all returns will be electronically, Keith said.
   --- EDITORS NOTE: The IRS toll-free number is 1-800-424-1040.

   Prices fell in a roller coaster session on
London's Stock Exchange Wednesday on uncertainty over the outcome
of the ongoing U.S. Treasury bond auctions.
   Wall Street opened on weak footing and continued lower
throughout most of the London afternoon. Later, a mid-session
reversal took New York prices higher and pulled London equities up
from their session lows.
   ``We've got a return of the roller coaster days of a few weeks
ago,'' said one director at a large U.S. brokerage firm.
   Commentators said investors were unsettled by weakness in the
West German bond market.
   Some worried that Wednesday's auction of 10-year Treasury bonds
would be turbulent. The auctions end Thursday.
   At the London closing, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange
100-stock index was down 13.7 points, or 0.6 percent, at 2,307.4,
well above its session low of 2,299.1 but down from a midmorning
peak of 2,320.6.
   Volume amounted to a light 368.1 million shares, compared with
407.8 million shares Tuesday.

<HEAD>If There Is A Peace Dividend, Give It To The People</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There is no peace dividend yet and there may
never be one, but proposals for spending it already are being
offered by individuals and groups with a cause.
   Now comes an original one: Don't spend it. Give it back to the
people.
   The proposals to spend the dividend, some say, are examples of
the urgency with which advocates, activists, elected officials and
supporters of big government promote private agendas at the
public's expense.
   As imagined, the peace dividend would result from a quick
cutback in the United States defense budget as world tensions ease,
freeing billions of dollars for use elsewhere.
   But it will never exist, says economist Stuart Butler, ``so long
as Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union remain in turmoil and so
long as there is no consensus in the United States regarding future
defense needs.''
   In spite of this, Butler and his Heritage Foundation colleagues
said they found advocates of various programs already holding news
conferences to propose ways in which to spend the money. Therefore,
they offer theirs.
   Butler, director of domestic policy studies at Heritage, a
conservative think tank, proposes 11 tax cuts totaling more than
$107 billion a year in relief. Each member of Congress was
scheduled to receive a copy this week:
   1. Reduce the tax burden on the elderly by eliminating the
Social Security earnings test.
   Currently, Americans between ages 65 and 69 who earn more than
$9,360 are required to give up $1 in Social Security benefits for
every $3 they earn.
   ``This is an effective 33 percent tax on earnings, on top of all
the other federal, state and local taxes that are deducted,''
according to the paper. The effect, it says, is to drive such
people out of the work force.
   2. Index the Social Security benefits tax for inflation.
   3. Roll back Social Security payroll taxes and return Social
Security to pay-as-you-go financing. This is the proposal already
put forth by Sen. Daniel Moynihan, D-N.Y.
   4. Increase the personal income tax exemption to $6,300 for each
child under 18 years of age, from its current level of $2,000.
   Commentary: If the tax burden on families were reduced, ``most
families could meet their children's needs according to their own
priorities and would not need new government programs.''
   5. Provide tax credits to households to cover medical expenses
and health insurance premiums.
   6. Provide tax incentives for the purchase of long-term care
insurance.
   7. Designate 100 federal enterprise zones to spur economic
development in the inner cities.
   8. Reduce the capital gains tax.
   9. Expand the Earned Income Tax Credit, or EITC.
   The EITC is a tax credit for low-income workers with children.
Butler and staff maintain that when combined with other welfare
programs, an expanded EITC might lift a single mother from poverty
even if she earned the minimum wage.
   10. Provide a toddler tax credit.
   The Heritage analysts say the current child-care crisis, as it
is sometimes termed, could be solved by giving money directly to
parents so they could determine how best to care for their children.
   11. Restore IRA eligibility to all individuals.
   The 1986 Tax Reform Act sharply curtailed the number of people
who could qualify for Individual Retirement Accounts, in which
savings accumulate free of taxes.
   Says Butler: Remind your representatives in Congress that
dividends are normally paid to investors (the people) not kept by
the corporation (Congress).

<HEAD>Helicopter Company Announces Layoffs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MESA, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Co. will lay off
more than 10 percent of its employees by Feb. 23 because of reduced
defense spending by the government, company president William P.
Brown announced today.
   The move will involve about 400 workers each at the company's
base plant here and at its California Manufacturing Center in
Culver City, Calif. The company employs 5,900 in Mesa and 1,650 in
Culver City.
   ``We must reduce our workforce to meet the reality of our
delivery schedule with the U.S. Army,'' Brown said in a prepared
statement.
   The plant here has been producing Apache helicopters for the
Army at the rate of 10 per month. Brown said that number would be
reduced to six a month in June under a contract which ends in
mid-1993.
   He said the company still has good prospects of international
sales of Apaches.
   The other step in the company's retrenchment is elimination or
delay of discretionary spending, Brown said.
   That means postponing a proposed expansion here to accommodate
production of the new MDX and MD-520N and MD-530N helicopters. The
expansion was scheduled to begin last month, but Brown said the
plan had been put on hold.
   Other casualties of the moratorium on non-critical spending will
include employee travel, participation in industry trade shows and
replacement of non-essential equipment.
   ``Competing in world markets, particularly with reductions in
defense spending, requires strong measures to be taken,'' Brown
said. ``McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Co. continues to be an
industry leader in financial strength as well as in the quality of
the products we produce.''

   The U.S. dollar finished mixed against major

   Gold prices rose.
   A lack of market-moving news made dealers reluctant to trade
heavily and kept the dollar within a narrow range.
   Dealers said the developments in Moscow, with Soviet President
Mikhail Gorbachev winning Communist Party support for his sweeping
reforms, had already been factored into the foreign exchange
markets.
   ``There just isn't any trend,'' said a trader at a large
Frankfurt bank. ``It's very difficult to make money.''
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose to a closing 145.10 Japanese yen from
144.90 yen at Tuesday's close. Later, in London, it rose to 145.45
yen.
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.6995 from $1.7015 late
Tuesday.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday's
levels were: 1.6545 West German marks, down from 1.6570; 1.4805
Swiss francs, up from 1.4770; 5.6335 French francs, down from
5.6405; 1.8650 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8680; 1,234.50 Italian
lire, down from 1,235.00; and 1.1932 Canadian dollars, up from
1.1874.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $423 a troy ounce
from $420.85 bid late Tuesday. In Zurich, the metal rose to a
closing bid of $422.25 from $420.75 bid late Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.72 to close at a bid of
$417.75 an ounce.
   Silver bullion rose in London to a late bid price of $5.38 a
troy ounce, up from $5.31 bid late Tuesday.

<HEAD>Some Venture Capitalists Invest In Broccoli, Cruise Ships</HEAD>
<HEAD>Graphic planned</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARIANN CAPRINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   When Jack Hesse talks about ``seed'' capital, he means, well,
seeds.
   Broccoli seeds. Onion. Carrot. Corn.
   Most venture capitalists use ``seed capital'' to describe money
invested in a range of risky startup companies to help them sprout
a product.
   Hesse, who heads the Boston-based Plant Resources Venture Fund,
is one of a growing number of venture capitalists to concentrate
investment on just one industry.
   So-called focused funds may target only chemicals, or retailing,
or biotechnology, or entertainment, for example. In Hesse's case,
it's agribusiness.
   Focused funds evolved partly because of disappointment in the
mixed performances of much broader venture capital funds in recent
years.
   ``In the 1980s there were too many plain-vanilla funds using the
same (investment) strategies,'' said Mark Radtke, a vice president
at the Boston-based investment firm Advent International Corp.
``But to perform well, you must have a competitive advantage.''
   Because managers of focused funds usually have extensive
experience in the industry they invest in, they are better equipped
to spot innovation and far more likely, many say, to back startups
than large, diversified venture capital companies.
   Charlie Bass holds a Ph.D. in electrical engineering and has
founded and run a handful of telecommunications companies. His
4-month-old Bass Associates Inc. in Palo Alto, Calif., invests
strictly within that industry.
   Bass recently pumped money into Racotek Inc., a mobile radio
startup in Minneapolis that links truck radios with personal
computers.
   ``The large, general-purpose funds are both less able and less
willing to play in these early-stage, specialized markets,'' Bass
said.
   In addition, they ``don't have as much time to do hands-on work
with smaller companies,'' said Larry Coleman, president of Franklin
Venture Capital Inc. in Nashville, Tenn.
   Coleman, a former executive of Hospital Corp. of America and a
biochemist-immunologist by training, invests in medical product and
service companies. In less than three years, his $18 million fund
has invested in 16 companies, more than half of them startups.
   A year ago Coleman backed Flying Nurses Inc., a nurse staffing
startup in Dallas that has grown more than tenfold in both revenue
and income, he said.
   Proponents of focused funds say it's much too early to judge
their success rate. Nonetheless, some venture capital experts say
the focused strategy is flawed because it's so narrow.
   ``Are there enough deals that are good financial investments and
fit in a particular sector?'' Radtke said. ``The more focused you
are, the harder it can be to generate deals.''
   Focused fund managers Don Phillips and Cece Smith dispute that
argument. They say they review 600 to 700 business plans a year
before picking the four or five choicest prospects.
   Phillips is a former chief executive of Pearle Health Services,
which runs a chain of eye-care centers. He and Smith, another
ex-Pearle executive, formed Phillips-Smith Specialty Retail Group,
a Dallas-based fund that invests only in innovative retailers,
mostly startups.
   After three years, the group has $70 million under management,
making it a startup success in its own right.
   Despite the success stories, the venture capital business is in
flux. The amount of venture money invested over the past few years
has varied between about $3 billion and $4 billion. But the amount
of new money raised for venture capital funds has fallen.
   Last year, for example, private venture funds raised an
estimated $2.4 billion, down 43 percent from the 1987 peak of $4.2
billion, said Venture Economics Inc., a Needham, Mass.-based
research concern.
   ``The money is declining, and there's probably some
consolidation going on,'' said Tom Baruch, a partner of Chemicals
and Materials Enterprise Associates in Boston. ``People with
special expertise will be sought out.''
   Baruch enticed corporate giants including 3M, Exxon and Ford
Motor Co. to contribute at least $3 million apiece to a fund
investing in materials technologies. ``They see it as an
opportunity to get a window on new technologies,'' he said.
   Focused funds are crossing international boundaries.
Representatives of Advent Western Pacific Management, for example,
have been visiting financial institutions in the United States and
Asia, seeking $35 million to be funneled into Australia's tourism
industry.
   The Melbourne-based fund already has raised $8 million, part of
which has financed cruise ships that tour Sydney harbor and the
Murray River. The fund also has an equity stake in the Sydney
aquarium and theme park.
   Venture capitalists are maverick and often eccentric
businesspeople whom entrepreneurs turn to when banks reject their
loan applications. Typically, money is exchanged for a stake in the
company and, perhaps, a seat or two on its board of directors.
Rather than take a passive role, venture capitalists nurture a
company, often forming close ties with the entrepreneurs.
   The big payoff theoretically comes when venture capitalists
either sell a company or take it public in a stock offering.
Returns can be astronomical.
   But the ability to divest a company largely depends upon the
prevailing mood in the marketplace. This can put focused funds at a
special disadvantage.
   ``You are at the mercy of what the stock market is saying about
the industry,'' Radtke said. ``You don't have complete control over
what the background economy is going to be when you want to exit
these companies.''
   An inability to divest a company ``is definitely an issue,''
said Bass of Bass Associates. ``It puts an added premium on working
in a robust segment of the market.''
   It is too early to measure the success of focused funds against
their diversified counterparts.
   Funds younger than three years old are still investing and
probably have no returns. ``They're like a child,'' said Stephen
Piper of Venture Economics, ``you don't know if they'll grow up to
be a criminal or the president.''

   Stock prices rallied in moderate afternoon
trading, helped by program trading and a sharp boost in technology
stocks.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 30.63 points to
2,636.94 at 2 p.m. EST. The blue-chip indicator was down 0.45 point
at noon and more than 20 points shortly after the opening bell.
   Advancing issues overpowered losers by a margin of about 7 to 5
on the New York Stock Exchange, with 815 issues up, 571 down and
481 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 123.61 million shares.
   Analysts said high technology stocks helped revive the blue chip
sector after a morning lull. Weakness in the bond market had
pressured stocks in earlier trading.
   ``IBM is leading on the upside,'' said Dennis Jarrett, technical
analyst for Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. ``It's just a case where people
expect the market to pop.''
   Analysts attributed the market's earlier weakness to ongoing
worries about the Treasury's quarterly refunding and concerns about
whether yields would have to be forced higher to attract Japanese
investors. Foreign investors, particularly the Japanese, are an
important source of funds into U.S. credit markets.
   The three-part auction, which started Tuesday with the sale of
$10 billion in three-year notes, continued today with the sale of
$10 billion in 10-year notes. The final auction on Thursday will
comprise $10 billion of 30-year Treasury bonds.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was
up 1.51 at 183.84.
   At the American Stock Exchange, the market value index was 1.06

<HEAD>Times Mirror Says Earnings Dropped 23.5 Percent in Fourth Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Times Mirror Corp. posted profit declines of
23.5 percent for the fourth quarter and 10.2 percent for the year,
due in part to lower earnings at many of its Eastern newspapers and
in its consumer magazines and broadcast TV operations.
   The big communications and publishing company said Wednesday it
earned $74.1 million, or 57 cents per share, in the
October-December quarter, compared with $96.8 million, or 76 cents
per share, in the same period in 1988.
   Revenue rose 1.1 percent for the quarter, from $925 million to
$935 million, despite the fact that the quarter included six fewer
days of newspaper operation than the same period of 1988.
   Fourth-quarter 1989 results reflected a loss provision of 6
cents per share on the expected sale of newspaper press equipment.
The comparable 1988 earnings included a gain of 1 cent per share
from asset sales. Excluding those factors, per-share earnings would
have declined 16 percent, from 75 cents to 63 cents, Times Mirror
said.
   For the year, Times Mirror reported earnings of $298 million, or
$2.30 per share, compared with $332 million, or $2.58 per share, in
1988. Revenue rose 5.5 percent to $3.52 billion from $3.33 billion.
   Excluding net gains of 5 cents per share in 1989 and 31 cents
per share in 1988, yearly per-share earnings would have fallen by 1
percent, from $2.27 to $2.25, the company said. Timberlands and
other assets were sold in 1988; a gain from selling timberlands in
1989 was offset to some extent by the fourth-quarter loss provision
on the expected sale of the press equipment.
   ``1989 was a year of mixed results,'' Times Mirror Chairman
Robert F. Erburu said. ``Most of our Eastern newspapers, our
consumer magazines and our Broadcast Television group experienced
difficult operating conditions.''
   However, he said, results were impressive from Times Mirror's
flagship newspaper, the Los Angeles Times, and Times Mirror's
cable-TV operations and publishing companies.
   For the full year, earnings improved at the Los Angeles Times,
the Baltimore Sun newspapers and The Morning Call of Allentown,
Pa., Times Mirror said. But Newsday's profit was sharply lower, and
results at The Hartford Courant and the company's southern
Connecticut newspapers also declined.

   Police may like Kip Fuller for keeping drunks off
the road, but they're not too happy that he helps speeders outwit
radar traps by turning cars into ground versions of a Stealth
bomber.
   Fuller invented the Guardian Interlock, which deactivates a
car's ignition system if the driver can't pass an alcohol
breathalyzer test. They are used by law enforcers in at least 18
states.
   The Denver inventor's latest innovation is known as a stealth
car bra, so named because it resembles a brassiere strapped to the
front of a vehicle.
   Made of radar-absorbing carbon fibers, the bra enables a car to
fool police radar until it reaches close range, permitting drivers
to spot the trap and slow down before their speed is clocked.
   ``I'm not anti-government,'' said Fuller, 33. ``I try to develop
products that assist the government in doing its job.''
   But how does a stealth car bra help the government?
   Fuller smiled. ``It keeps them on their toes.''
   His idea for the Guardian Interlock stems from his conviction
for driving under the influence at age 19. Afterward, Fuller
recalled in an interview, he asked himself why someone hadn't
thought of a product that would help prevent drunk driving.
   ``The `why' part of that question got me thinking about a method
of prevention. It sure would have helped me back then,'' he said.
   To start a car equipped with the Guardian Interlock, a driver
must breathe into a mouthpiece attached to an alcohol sensor for 4
seconds. If the driver's alcohol level is above the level deemed
safe, the ignition remains locked.
   Judges around the country are ordering convicted drunk drivers
to buy and install the $300 system in their vehicles as an
alternative to paying fines or serving jail time, Fuller said.
   Fuller's stealth car bra also resulted from experience.
   ``Honestly, I was a little tired of getting speeding tickets.
But more than that, I believe the government uses radar technology
to generate revenue. The public has a right to defend itself if the
government uses clandestine methods,'' Fuller said.
   Radar, he said, often gives inaccurate readings because the beam
from a radar gun spreads like the light from a flashlight. Stealth
technology forces a police officer to wait until the vehicle is
closer to get a speed reading, improving a driver's chances of
spotting the officer and slowing down first.
   ``The bra protects drivers from unfair readings that result in
unjustified speeding tickets,'' he said.
   The bra, which starts at $299 depending on the auto make and
model, is custom-made to fit most domestic and foreign cars.
   Fuller's creations have gained him national and international
recognition. As president and founder of Innovisions Research Co.,
he has combined inventiveness and marketing savvy to create a
growing business.
   Innovisions Research, in operation just over a year, employs
seven people full-time and makes use of about 20 subcontractors.
Revenue for 1990 is projected at around $2 million, Fuller said.
   Fuller's career as an inventor _ or innovator, as he prefers to
be called _ began when the drums he made from chlorine cans won
second prize at a third grade school fair.
   ``Inventing was a way of getting things my parents or I couldn't
afford,'' he said.
   Fuller's first commercial success, or so he thought, came at age
22. A sports fanatic, he designed a fold-away trailer to haul his
motorbikes and other equipment too large to fit in compact cars.
Only after taking out a second mortgage on his home to finance the
venture did he realize he was losing $25 per trailer because of
distribution problems. Still, he was undeterred.
   ``An idea has very little value until it's proven to be a
commercial success,'' Fuller said.
   His first financial success came was the Servitron Robot, a
vinyl, 4-feet-tall, remote-control toy that serves drinks at
parties. It racked up nearly $3 million in sales its first year.
   The mechanical influx of cash made it possible for Fuller to
develop and market other creations: orthopedically designed pants
for skiers with bad knees; a condo for cats; handles for skis, and
mitts for ice-scrapers.
   ``I just look at different areas objectively. Sometimes people
in a specific industry are so close to the subject that they can't
see the areas where improvements or additions are necessary. I try
to remain the observer so I don't get too wrapped up in a
product,'' Fuller said.
   One of Fuller's latest demonstrations of technological
shrewdness is an electronic alarm that guards parking spaces. Set
at the front end of a parking space, Park Guard 1000 uses
ultrasonic waves to detect unidentified vehicles that come within 5
feet of the alarm. A voice message then is triggered: ``Warning!
Reserved Parking! Please move your car or it will be towed.'' If
the vehicle is not moved, a shrill alarm sounds.
   Fuller said his inventions serve two functions _ they are fun,
like his Aqua Tunes, which allows lap swimmers to listen to music
while they swim, or they provide a public service, like the
Guardian Interlock.
   Although he now enjoys a comfortable life because of his
business success, Fuller said his ideas are largely a result of
working for himself and avoiding a dreary 9-to-5 job.
   ``That's why most adults aren't so creative,'' Fuller says.
``Who has the time to create? I'm lucky. I get to make the time.''

   Grain futures prices closed mostly higher
Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade, paced by moderate gains in
soybeans amid signs of tighter supplies and worsening growing
conditions in South America.
   Farmer selling of soybeans has been slow recently and analysts
noted some movement of beans out of deliverable positions against
the March futures contract.
   The movement indicates that the prices that both soybean
crushers and Gulf Coast shippers are paying are high enough to
cover the costs of transporting the beans to them, said Anne Frick,
senior oilseeds analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. in
New York.
   Broadly underpinning the gains in all markets were reports that
Communist Party leaders in the Soviet Union have approved sweeping
political reforms recommended by their leader, Mikhail Gorbachev.
   The nation's swing toward democracy is seen as increasing the
chances the United States will grant most-favored-nation trade
status to the Soviet Union, which could lead to bigger grain deals
with the United States.
   At the close, wheat futures were { cent lower to 1} cents higher
with the contract for delivery in March at $3.82} a bushel; corn
futures were 1 cent to 1\ cents higher with March at $2.39 a

   The stock market snapped out of an early
depression to close sharply higher, helped by program trading and a
rally in blue-chip stocks.
   ``It's a blue-chip rally,'' said Brad Weeks, head of equity
trading for Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette.
   The market opened sharply lower in what analysts said was a
response to weakness in the bond market due largely to worries
about the Treasury's quarterly refunding. The Dow Jones industrials
were down more than 20 points shortly after the opening bell.
   Analysts said a rally in high technology stocks, along with
heavy bouts of computerized program trading, helped revive the blue
chip sector before midday.
   Stocks retained their upward momentum in the aftermath of the
Treasury's sale of $10 billion in 10-year notes despite continued
weakness in the bond market.
   ``It looks like the refunding is going well,'' said Weeks.
``Reports are the Japanese bought about 25 to 30 percent of the
notes.''
   The three-part auction, which started Tuesday with the sale of
$10 billion in three-year notes, culminates on Thursday with the
auction of $10 billion in 30-year Treasury bonds.
   Worries about the refunding have plagued the bond market and
depressed stock prices in recent sessions. In particular, investors
were concerned that yields would be forced higher to compete
against overseas rates and attract Japanese investors. Foreign
investors, particularly the Japanese, are an important source of
funds into U.S. credit markets.
   Despite the rally, which some observers attributed to technical
factors, some Wall Street analysts said underlying market
fundamentals remained bearish and predicted a continued short-term
downtrend in the market once the refunding is over.

<TEXT>
   Companies that provide telephone operator
services for travelers were warned Wednesday that they may face
stiff government regulation because of widespread complaints they
are picking the pockets of unwary callers _ including members of
the U.S. Senate.
   Sen. Alan Dixon, D-Ill., said the Federal Communications
Commission, which last year issued rules to govern alternative
operator services companies, is receiving 150 complaints a month
from angry callers who feel they're being overcharged or not being
allowed to use the long-distance carrier of their choice.
   The operator companies contract with hotels, hospitals, airports
and other public institutions to handle ``dial O'' calls on
long-distance lines leased from a major carrier. The operator
companies pay a commission to the premises owner.
   Dixon, testifying before a Senate subcommittee considering two
bills that would crack down on alleged abuses and possibly regulate
prices, noted that under the FCC rules five major AOS companies
were to identify themselves and allow callers, upon request, to
reach their own long-distance carrier.
   ``I submit to you that this not being done, and our constituents
continue to fall prey to these unscrupulous practices,'' Dixon told
the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation telecommunications
subcommittee.
   He said callers were getting bills from a city where they never
were, resulting in two charges for one call _ often well in excess
of rates charged by American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co., MCI or US
Sprint, which actually carry the calls for the operator service
companies.
   Dixon said a staff survey of four Washingon hotels and one
restaurant served by the operator companies found violations of the
FCC rules, particularly that signs be placed on phone informing
callers of the name of the service provider.
   Dixon told of being charged $16 for three calls from operator
services companies that would have cost $7 using a pre-subscribed
long-distance carrier.
   That prompted subcommittee Chairman Sen. Daniel Inouye,
D-Hawaii, to acknowledge that he too had had a bad experience with
one of the alternative operator service companies last month.
   Inouye said that when such things occur to a subcommittee
chairman ``some action can be expected.''
   Representatives of the companies and the chief telephone
regulator at the FCC, Richard Firestone, said complaints have
dropped by half since the FCC rules went into effect.
   The company officials said they are beginning to police
themselves after a period of ``growing pains'' and that they soon
will have the technical capability to connect callers with all
long-distance companies.
   The companies have flourished since the breakup of AT&amp;T opened
competition in the $12 billion market for assisted telephone calls.
Critics say the commission system gives the operator companies no
incentive to hold down prices.
   Dixon's bill would deny commissions to any institution that did
not allow phone users to reach the long-distance carrier of their
choice. If a company continued to serve a facility that blocks
calls, the operator companies would not be allowed to charge more
than the lowest rate available from other long-distance companies
for the same call.
   Dixon's bill also would prohibit a alternative-operator company,
when it cannot complete a call, from handing off the call without
warning to another long-distance company. That results in two bills
_ one of which is from a location where the customer never was.
   Sen. John Breaux, D-La., has introduced a bill identical to a
measure passed by the House last year. His bill incorporates the
FCC rules and requires that the companies file prices for approval
by the FCC.

   Negotiations to relieve the crushing debt
burden on Third World countries should progress more smoothly now
that Mexico and its creditor banks have signed a debt reduction
agreement, a senior Bush administration official predicted
Wednesday.
   ``The strengthened debt strategy is very much alive and well,''
Treasury Undersecretary David C. Mulford, architect of the
administration debt plan, told the House Banking subcommittee on
international development.
   The Mexican agreement signed Sunday in Mexico City is the first
under the administration's year-old Brady plan, named after
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady.
   The strategy emphasizes reducing a borrowing country's debt and
the interest it must pay, in contrast with the Reagan
administration strategy that sought to provide new loans in return
for economic reforms by the borrowers.
   Mulford acknowledged that 10 months had passed since the start
of talks between Mexico and representatives of its 450 creditor
banks. But, he said, the pact eased the way for agreements by other
countries.
   Banks now accept that they must reduce the debt of developing
countries and the borrowing nations have a more realistic
expectation of how much relief they can get, he said.
   ``The banks at the time of the Mexican negotiation were in the
early phase of coming to terms with the elements of the strategy.
... The principles of debt reduction and debt service reduction are
now established and I sense a greater flexibility at this point on
the part of banks,'' Mulford said.
   Costa Rica and the Philippines both have reached agreement in
principle on new financing packages and Venezuela and Morocco are
actively negotiating with banks, he said.
   However, Delegate Walter E. Fauntroy, D-D.C., chairman of the
subcommittee, said, ``The pace of negotiations clearly needs to be
speeded up if ... countries ... are to receive relief within a
reasonable period.''
   Rep. Joseph Kennedy, D-Mass., said the debt pact, while moving
in the right direction, did not provide the Mexican government with
enough relief to revive its economy.
   But Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, said the Mexican deal, compared with
other relief packages for foreign countries, was surpassed only by
the Marshall Plan aid to Europe after World War II.
   ``It's always easy to say a good program isn't good enough. ...
The fact of the matter is this agreement ... has to be seen as
truly historic and monumental,'' Leach said.
   Mulford said the agreement reduced Mexico's overall foreign debt
from $95 billion at the end of last year _ half of it owed to
foreign banks _ to about $80 billion by March 1. From 1989 to 1992,
Mexico's annual interest payments will be reduced by about
one-third, to $1.5 billion. Principal payments will be $6.7 billion
less over the period.
   Mexico also will get about $1.5 billion in new loans from banks.
Mulford said that proved ``new bank lending and debt reduction can
co-exist in the same financing package.''

<HEAD>Yields at Closely Watched Auction Rise To Highest Level Since May</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Yields on 10-year Treasury notes rose in
Wednesday's auction to the highest level since last May as the
government's quarterly refunding reached its midpoint.
   The average yield was 8.59 percent, up from 7.94 percent at the
last auction on Nov. 13, 1989.
   It was the highest rate since 10-year notes averaged 9.18
percent on May 10. The notes will carry a coupon interest rate of
8{ percent with each $10,000 in face value selling for $9,940.40.
   A total of $10 billion in notes were sold out of bids totaling
$23.9 billion.
   The refunding continues Thursday with the auction of $10 billion
in 30-year bonds.
   In Tuesday's auction, the Treasury sold $10 billion of
three-year notes with an average yield of 8.43 percent, up from
7.77 percent at the last three-year auction Nov. 9 and the highest
since such notes averaged 9.12 percent last May 9. Bids totaled
$34.1 billion.
   The notes and bonds are regularly sold at auctions held four
times a year to replenish the government's coffers.
   In announcing this week's auctions, Treasury Undersecretary
Robert Glauber said $18.1 billion would be used to refund privately
held notes maturing on Feb. 15 and to raise about $11.9 billion in
cash.
   In addition, the Treasury sold $7.7 billion in three-month bills
and $7.6 billion in six-month bills at its weekly bill auction
Monday. It also plans to sell $9.5 billion in one-year notes
Thursday.

   The dollar closed higher against major
currencies in domestic trading Wednesday but the West German mark
continued holding center stage on world foreign exchange markets.
   Gold prices declined in U.S. dealings but moved mostly higher
abroad.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery settled at $418.10 a troy ounce, $3.20 lower than
Tuesday's close. Republic National Bank in New York quoted an ounce
of gold bullion at $418.10 as of 4 p.m. EST, down $2.60 from
Tuesday's late bid.
   The dollar has been playing a supporting role to the mark lately
because reforms in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe are expected
to benefit the West German economy, said Keith Raphael, second vice
president of foreign exchange at Chase Manhattan Bank.
   Meanwhile, negative sentiment toward the dollar has prevailed
amid speculation that a softening U.S. economy will be accompanied
by interest rate declines. Lower U.S. rates would reduce returns on
dollar-denominated investments, tending to curb demand for dollars.
   Regardless, the dollar managed to gain against its foreign
counterparts in what U.S. dealers described as a technical rebound.
Overseas, the dollar turned in a mixed performance.
   Dealers said developments in Moscow, with Soviet Communist Party
leaders agreeing to give up their monopoly on power as proposed by
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, already had been factored into
foreign exchange markets.
   A lack of market-moving news made dealers reluctant to trade
heavily and kept the dollar within a narrow range.
   The dollar began its trading day in Tokyo by rising to 145.10
Japanese yen from 144.90 yen at Tuesday's close. Later in London,
it rose to 145.45 yen. At the end of New York's trading day, the
dollar was quoted at 145.60 yen, up from 145.245 yen Tuesday.
   The dollar ended the day in New York at 1.6580 West German
marks, up from 1.65605 marks on Tuesday and from the 1.6545 closing
level Wednesday in Europe. In London, the British pound fell to
$1.6995 from $1.7015 late Tuesday and to $1.6960 from $1.7030 in
New York.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Tuesday's
late quotes, included: 1.4890 Swiss francs, up from 1.4763; 5.642
French francs, up from 5.64; 1,236.50 Italian lire, up from
1,233.50; and 1.19455 Canadian dollars, up from 1.18755.
   Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with Tuesday's levels,
included: 1.6545 West German marks, down from 1.6570; 1.4805 Swiss
francs, up from 1.4770; 5.6335 French francs, down from 5.6405;
1.8650 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8680; 1,234.50 Italian lire,
down from 1,235.00; and 1.1932 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1874.
   Gold bullion prices were mixed while silver rose.
   In London, gold rose to a late bid of $423 a troy ounce from
$420.85 bid late Tuesday. In Zurch, gold rose to a closing bid of
$422.25 from $420.75 bid late Tuesday. Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold
fell $1.72 to close at a bid of $417.75 a troy ounce.
   On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current delivery ended
at $5.311 a troy ounce, up from Tuesday's settlement of $5.306.
Silver bullion rose in London to a late bid of $5.38 a troy ounce
from $5.31 bid late Tuesday.

   Oil prices finished mixed in light, featureless
trading Wednesday.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the March contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the key grade of U.S. crude oil, fell 19 cents
to end at $22.32 per barrel. Crude contracts for delivery in April,
May and June also declined, but later months rose.
   Among refined products traded on the exchange, the March
contract for regular unleaded gasoline fell 0.68 cent to 61.20
cents a gallon. Other contract months also retreated.
   No. 2 heating oil for March delivery declined 0.30 cent to 55.89
cents a gallon, but later contract months rose.
   Analysts said prices zig-zagged erratically through the session
without any fresh market developments to influence them.
   ``The market told you nothing today about its overall
direction,'' said Michael Hiley, a vice president at Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc.
   After the market closed Tuesday, the American Petroleum
Institute released a weekly report that showed sharp increases in
inventories of both crude and refined products. For the week ended
Feb. 2, crude inventories rose 7.7 million barrels to 351.1
million; heating oil stocks rose 4.5 million barrels to 121 million
barrels; and gasoline stocks rose 4.7 million barrels to 231.4
million barrels.

   The stock market surged Wednesday after
recovering from an early slump prompted by concerns about the
Treasury's refunding auction.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials jumped 33.78 points to
end at 2,640.09.
   Advancing issues overpowered losers by a marin of about 5 to 3
in nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks,
with 941 issues up, 567 down and 443 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 186.71 million
shares, up sharply from 134.07 million in the previous session.
   The market opened lower in what analysts said was a response to
weakness in the bond market, reflecting worries about interest
rates and the Treasury's quarterly refunding. The Dow Jones
industrials were down more than 20 points shortly after the opening
bell.
   ``Investors were almost waiting for the market to go lower so
they could get some good bargains,'' said Michael Metz, technical
analyst with Oppenheimer &amp; Co. ``As soon as that happened they all
came into the market at the same time and that sparked a rally.''
   High technology stocks, which lead the advance, helped revive
the blue chip sector before midday. Bouts of computerized program
trading fueled the upward move once the rally got under way,
traders said.
   Stocks retained their upward momentum in afternoon trading after
what appeared to be a good turnout for the Treasury's sale of $10
billion in 10-year notes. Bond prices rallied in the aftermath of
the auction and were up fractionally late in the day.
   ``It looks like the refunding is going well,'' said Brad Weeks,
head of equity trading for Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette. ``Reports
are the Japanese bought about 25 to 30 percent of the notes.''
   The three-part $30 billion auction, which started Tuesday with
the sale of $10 billion in three-year notes, ends on Thursday with
the auction of $10 billion in 30-year Treasury bonds.
   Worries about the refunding have plagued the bond market and
depressed stock prices in recent sessions. In particular, investors
were concerned that yields would be forced higher to compete
against overseas rates and attract Japanese investors. Foreign
investors, particularly the Japanese, are an important source of
funds into U.S. credit markets.
   Despite the rally, some Wall Street analysts said underlying
market fundamentals remained bearish and predicted a continued
short-term downtrend in the market once the refunding is over.
   ``The real problems are floundering profits and rising interest
rates which are deadly for the stock market,'' said Larry Wachtel,
equities analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   ``When the refunding is out of the way then the problems will
reoccur,'' said Weeks. ``People will start talking of poor
corporate earnings again and about what might happen in the first
quarter and the market will go down again.''
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 220.5 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market rose $31.638 billion, or 0.99
percent, in value from Tuesday.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks added
1.98 to 184.31.
   Among actively traded issues on the NYSE, IBM jumped 2&lsqb; to 103&lsqb;,
Haliburton rose 3 to 45&rsqb;, AT&amp;T gained { to 40 and General Electric
added | to 62|.
   Among other computer stocks, Compaq Computer rose 4} to 86&lsqb;,
Digital Equipment advanced 1~ to 79&lsqb; and Hewlett Packard increased

   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index finished 5.30 higher at
385.39, and S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index rose 4.09 to 333.75.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market rose
2.80 to 426.79. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 356.35, up 1.61.

<HEAD>Soybean Futures Rise on Signs of Stronger Demand</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices rose moderately Wednesday on the Chicago
Board of Trade amid signs of stronger demand and drier growing
conditions for the South American crop. Most grain futures also
advanced.
   On other commodity markets, gold futures retreated; energy
futures were mixed; and livestock and meat futures were mostly
higher.
   Soybean futures settled 3{ cents to 5 cents higher with the
contract for delivery in March up 5 cents at $5.67} a bushel.
   Wheat futures settled { cent lower 1} cents higher with March at
$3.83 a bushel; corn futures were 1\ cents to 1} cents higher with
March at $2.39 a bushel; oats were 1\ cents to 1} cents higher with
March at $1.37\ a bushel.
   The soybean rally occurred on light trading volume and was not
remarkably strong compared with the market's permitted daily limit
of 30 cents.
   Yet the 5-cent gain represented the market's sharpest upward
move since Jan. 29, when it staged a reversal that many analysts
interpreted as a sign that soybean prices had bottomed.
   March soybeans rose 4{ cents on Tuesday.
   Analysts said some of Wednesday's buying probably reflected a
growing belief that the market is indeed heading higher. Also, the
day's little news was bullish.
   Anne Frick, senior oilseed analyst with Prudential-Bache
Securities Inc., noted that farmer sales of soybeans have slowed
recently and that some owners of physical soybeans have been moving
them out of deliverable positions against the March futures
contract.
   The movement indicates that the prices that both soybean
crushers and Gulf Coast shippers are paying are high enough to
cover the costs of transporting the beans to them, Ms. Frick said.
   Furthermore, the weather has turned drier in Southern Brazil, a
prime soybean-growing region, after good rains last week, which may
have prompted some buying.
   Analyst Walter Spilka of Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co., said
active buying of soybean and corn futures by Cargill Inc., a large
grain merchant, sparked speculation of new export sales of those
commodities.
   Reports that Spain was bidding 50,000 metric tons of U.S.
soybeans took traders by surprise and also helped the rally, Spilka
said.
   ``If you want a bottom line to this whole thing, prices have
fallen enough in the near term to stir a little export interest, at
least on a short term basis,'' he said.
   Gold futures sank on New York's Commodity Exchange on selling
related to a strong late rally in the stock market.
   Gold settled $3.20 to $3.50 lower with February at $418.10 a
troy ounce; silver futures finished 0.1 cent 0.5 cent higher with
March at $5.336 a troy ounce.
   Petroleum futures finished mixed with bullish chart signals
offset by Tuesday's weekly American Petroleum Institute inventory
report, which showed larger-than-expected U.S. supplies of crude
oil and refined products.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 19 cents lower to 10
cents higher with March at $22.32 a barrel; heating oil futures
finished .30 cent lower to .50 cent higher with March at 55.89
cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .20 cent to .95 cent lower
with March at 61.20 cents a gallon.
   Cattle futures ended mostly higher on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange in a technical rebound after Tuesday's decline. Pork
futures rose amid expectations for stronger cash markets.
   Live cattle futures finished .03 cent lower to .37 cent higher
with February at 79.27 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .12 cent
lower to .20 cent higher with March at 82.55 cents a pound; live
hogs were .03 cent lower to .48 cent higher with February at 49.15
cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were unchanged to .28 cent
higher with February unchanged at 50.50 cents a pound.

   Trans Ocean Airways, an international air

bankruptcy protection and was ordered to liquidate all its assets.
   Bankruptcy Judge Donald Boe of Opelousas, La., ordered
liquidation Tuesday after owners of three planes petitioned the
court to terminate their contract with Trans Ocean.
   Trans Ocean allegedly defaulted on its lease payments for three
planes and was ordered to return them to Aviation Sales Co. of
Miami.
   Roy Holleman, president of the Iberia Industrial Development

Parish. Trans Ocean employed 600 people, including 115 in New
Iberia. Its fleet included McDonnell Douglas DC-8s and Boeing 727s.

<HEAD>Ashton-Tate Posts $1 Million Loss in Fourth Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TORRANCE, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Software maker Ashton-Tate Corp., still
suffering from a recall of its flawed dBase IV computer program, on
Wednesday reported a fourth-quarter loss of $1 million.
   The loss for the October-December quarter, equivalent to 4 cents
a share, compared with a net profit of $13.4 million, or 51 cents a
share, in the fourth quarter of 1988.
   Fourth-quarter revenue fell 29 percent to $62.1 million from
$87.3 million. Ashton-Tate's fiscal year used to end on Jan. 31. As
of 1989, the company changed to a calendar year ending Dec. 31.
Therefore, its latest results are compared with results for the
period ended Jan. 31, 1989.
   For the year ended Dec. 31, Ashton-Tate lost $28.6 million, or
$1.09 a share, compared with a net profit of $47.7 million, or
$1.83 a share, in the year ended Jan. 31, 1989. Annual revenue fell
by 14 percent to $265.3 million from $307.3 million.
   The dBase programs are Ashton-Tate's core products. The dBase IV
version, designed to help small businesses and office work groups
track data, was released in October 1988, then had to be pulled off
the market when Ashton-Tate was besieged with complaints about
glitches.
   Since then, Ashton-Tate has been forced to lay off 15 percent of
its work force and has shown big losses as it struggles to bring to
market an improved version of dBase IV known as dBase IV 1.1.
   The latter program is nearing the end of an extensive
pre-release series of tryouts with software developers, corporate
users and distributors. Ashton-Tate Chairman Edward M. Esber Jr.
said reaction to it has been good.
   ``We believe that the worst is behind us,'' he said in a
conference call with reporters Wednesday.
   Asked about the chance of additional layoffs or if Ashton-Tate
might be a takeover target, he said: ``No company can honestly give
you assurances on either one.''
   But he added, ``We do not plan any layoffs at this time and plan
to remain independent.''

   Hewlett-Packard Co. and Oki Electrical

build a $40 million printed circuit board plant in Puerto Rico.
   The deal calls for construction of a 115,000-square-foot plant

   Two hundred employees will work at the plant, which will make
boards for computer products in HP's Puerto Rican operations. Oki's
share of output will be sold on the open market.
   Hewlett-Packard, based in Palo Alto, is an international
manufacturer of computer and measurement products with 95,000
workers and revenues of $11.9 billion in 1989.
   Oki makes telecommunications and information processing devices.
It has 20,000 employees and posted revenues of $4.2 billion in 1988.

<HEAD>Bill Would Expand, Lease Nation's Oil Reserves</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Capacity of the nation's Strategic Petroleum
Reserve would be expanded from 750 million to 1 billion barrels of
crude oil under legislation introduced Wednesday by Sen. J. Bennett
Johnston.
   Johnston, D-La., said his bill also would provide for the
leasing rather than the purchase of crude oil to fill the vast
Louisiana and Texas underground salt domes where the emergency oil
is kept.
   The Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, of which
Johnston is chairman, has scheduled hearings Feb. 27 on the
legislation.
   Johnston said 150 million of the additional 250 million barrels
of crude would be stored in one of several Louisiana sites being
considered. The balance would be put in one of three possible Texas
locations.
   Johnston quoted industry sources as saying the Louisiana
expansion could result in up to 1,000 construction jobs, several
hundred permanent hirings and an economic impact ranging from $400
million to $500 million.
   He said expansion of the reserve was needed because its original
intended capacity was 1 billion barrels and numerous studies have
supported that capacity.
   ``The message from DOE is: `Don't worry, be happy' with a
smaller SPR, a weaker insurance policy and a shorter lifeline for
this country if oil supplies are threatened,'' Johnston said in a
news release, referring to the U.S. Department of Energy.

<HEAD>Analysts Welcome Reported Resignation of Apple's `Visionary'</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 6th graf, `Later Wednesday ...' with 3 grafs to UPDATE
with report that employees told of Gassee's departure in a memo.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Analysts generally welcomed a report
Wednesday on the imminent departure of Jean-Louis Gassee, Apple
Computer Inc.'s flamboyant new-product developer, who often was
touted as the visionary for the personal computer maker.
   Gassee once was considered a possible successor to John Sculley,
Apple's chairman and chief executive officer. His reported
resignation comes during a tumultuous reorganization of the
company, which has suffered declining sales for a year.
   ``It appears that the speed with which new products were being
kicked out the door is the major complaint against Gassee, and to
the extent that this is an attempt to correct this very serious
problem, the resignation is both good and bad news,'' said Abigail
Christopher, an analyst at International Data Corp., a
high-technology research firm in Framingham, Mass.
   ``They've got to make a change. It's painful, but it's got to be
done,'' said Paul Gillin, executive editor of Computerworld, an
industry newsweekly. ``In the long term it's going to be positive
because what Apple needs is a shakeup.''
   Gassee, 46, who has headed the Cupertino-based company's
new-product development for five years, will leave the company
within the next few weeks, according to a report Wednesday in The
Wall Street Journal.
   An industry source who used to work at Apple, speaking on the
condition of anonymity, told The Associated Press some Apple
employees were notified of the resignation in a memo on Tuesday.
   However, Apple officials said Gassee's departure was far from
certain.
   ``No announcement has been made,'' said Apple spokesman
Christopher Escher. ``And Jean-Louis Gassee continues as the
president of Apple products. Obviously, because of recent
organization changes, Jean-Louis Gasee has been in discussions with
John Scully for some time regarding Jean-Louis' future role within
Apple.''
   Escher declined to comment further.
   Apple's stock lost $1.50 a share to close at $33.25 Wednesday in
national over-the-counter trading.
   The report of Gassee's departure follows by a week the
resignation of Allan Z. Loren, who headed Apple's domestic sales
and marketing division, the company's largest.
   The same day Loren's departure was disclosed, Apple named
Michael H. Spindler, the company's chief of European operations, to
the new post of chief operating officer. It gave Spindler
supervision of the domestic operations as well as two departments
that had been under Gassee's oversight since 1988, product
marketing and manufacturing.
   The Journal reported Sculley had pressured Gassee to accept a
demotion.
   Since the 1985 departure of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs, Gassee,
who once headed the European operations, concentrated on improving
the technical depth of Apple's Macintosh.
   Under his direction, Apple introduced an updated version of the
original Macintosh, called the SE, and a redesigned version called
the Macintosh II, Apple's first machine with a color monitor and a
full range of add-on options.
   But Gassee was criticized for failing to introduce new
low-priced models and for the company's portable computer, which
many of the company's legions of stalwart users complain is bulky,
slow, expensive and difficult to read.
   Gassee's departure will leave a ``giant hole'' in the management
of the company, said Bruce Lupatkin, an Apple analyst at Hambrecht
&amp; Quist, a San Francisco brokerage.
   But while it will be difficult to replace the colorful Gassee _
who often wore an earring and once cursed at a reporter's question
during a news conference _ Lupatkin said it would not be impossible.
   ``Since Jobs' departure (in 1985), he had been promoted as the
individual responsible for the company's vision, but if you look at
what's he's delivered, I don't think there's a great loss in
vision,'' Lupatkin said.
   Peter Rogers, an Apple analyst with Robertson Colman Stephens in
San Francisco, was more blunt: ``It's difficult to exalt him.''
   In its latest quarter, Apple suffered an 11 percent decline in
profit from the comparable period a year earlier. It was the third
consecutive quarter the company reported a decline in both revenues
and profit from the previous year, with most of the problems
centered in Loren's division.
   As a result, Apple, which had revenues of $5.3 billion in 1989,
said it would cut employment by 5,500, mostly through attrition and
reassignment, but would not rule out the possibility of layoffs. It
also froze salaries for six months and made other cutbacks.
   Rogers said Apple, the world's No. 2 personal computer maker
after International Business Machines Corp., needs to replace
Gassee quickly and smoothly.
   ``More than the loss of the man himself, Apple doesn't need a
lot more turmoil,'' Rogers said.
   Many industry observers fear the personnel changes and the
possibility of layoffs are damaging morale at the company, which
once was famed for its collegial operations.
   Besides losing sales, Apple faces a critical year in 1990 from
major competitors who will be introducing or improving their own
graphical interface products, the programs that use symbols to
allow the user to tell computers what to do.

   Playboy Enterprises Inc. earned $500,000 during
the second quarter of its fiscal 1990, about one-third of the
company's profit for the same period a year earlier.
   Playboy said its publishing group, which produces Playboy
magazine, showed a decline in revenue and earnings during the three
months ended Dec. 31. Profits were boosted in the year-earlier
quarter by $2.1 million in revenues generated by the sale of a
portion of the company's collection of LeRoy Neiman paintings.
   The $500,000 profit, or 5 cents a share, came on revenues of
$45.5 million. For the same period a year earlier, net income was
$1.5 million, or 16 cents a share, on revenues of $48.5 million.

<HEAD>Ford Prepares to Fire Picketing Mexican Workers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co. on Wednesday told
employees who have picketed a plant in Mexico for almost a month
that they will be fired if they don't return to work.
   The Cuautitlan plant, about 15 miles north of Mexico city, was
closed by Ford on Jan. 8 after armed thugs entered and beat and
shoot several workers. One of the nine injured workers died the
next day.
   Workers have picketed the plant since the closure, charging some
union officials are corrupt and pro-management.
   The company called picketers back to work on Jan. 30, but most
refused to return, demanding assurances from the Mexican Labor
Federation that union members would be able to elect their own
leaders.
   Of about 3,800 workers, more than 1,300 are back on the job,
said Al Chambers, North American communications manager for Ford.
Under Mexican law, Ford can terminate any worker who accumulates
more than three unexcused absences over a 30-day period and the
company is taking steps to do so.
   ``The company is advising that workers that under Mexican law
they can terminated,'' Chambers said Wednesday from company
headquarters. ``By today there should be an estimated 300 to 400
workers who have been notified of their termination.''
   He said Ford asked the federation for help in finding
replacement workers.
   Authorities are holding 10 men on homicide and criminal
conspiracy charges in connection with the Jan. 8 incident. The
state attorney general has ordered the arrest of union local head
Hector Uriarte for masterminding the violence.
   Picketers say Uriarte was imposed by the powerful federation,
which has controlled the union for more than 20 years.
   The protestors also demand that Ford pay back-wages for lost
time and guarantee plant security. They say Ford has acted in
unison with the federation, providing company clothes to the thugs
who entered the plant.
   The plant is turning out about 40 vehicles a day. Under normal
conditions, the Cuautitlan plant turns out 450 cars and trucks
daily for the Mexican market.
   Ford's production of 1,300 four-cylinder engines daily at its
plant in the Chihuahua City in northern Mexico, has also been set
back by a collective bargaining contract strike initiated Feb. 1.
The plant's production is mostly for export to Canada and the
United States.

<HEAD>Judge Adds $46 Million to Patent Judgment Against Mattel</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge has ordered $46 million in
interest added to the $24 million judgment won in an inventor's
12-year court fight with toymaker Mattel Inc. over its ``Hot
Wheels'' toy cars, the inventor's lawyer said Wednesday.
   U.S. District Judge Charles Kocoras refused Mattel's motion to
overturn the November judgment in the patent-infringement case or
grant a new trial. He also refused to triple the damages awarded to
New Jersey inventor Jerome Lemelson or to force Mattel to pay
lawyer's fees for the plaintiff.
   But in his final order, entered late Tuesday, Kocoras did set
out the procedure and percentages to be used in setting the amount
of interest Mattel must pay.
   Lemelson's attorney, Gerald Hosier, said it works out to $46
million _ making the total judgment about $70 million.
   Mattel said in a statement Wednesday that it will appeal the
patent infringement decision and is confident it will prevail.
   Lemelson, 66, a prolific inventor from Princeton, N.J., with
more than 400 creations to his credit, sued Hawthorne, Calif.-based
Mattel in 1977 for ``willful'' infringement on his patent for a
flexible track that is part of the company's ``Hot Wheels'' toy car
system.
   In its statement, Mattel said there are differences in its track
from the patent, and a similar product previously existed.
   Hot Wheels brought Mattel $545 million in sales between 1972 and
1986 and is the company's most popular offering after Barbie dolls.
   Lemelson, who got his patent for the track in 1969, said he
filed papers on his creation with the U.S. Patent and Trademark
Office in the mid-1960s, some time before Mattel's 1968
introduction of Hot Wheels.
   The case was filed in Chicago because its courts have a
reputation for finding in favor of inventors.

<HEAD>Helicopter Company Announces Layoffs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MESA, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Co. said
Wednesday it will lay off 800 employees and postpone a $20 million
expansion planned for its commercial helicopter line because of
reduced U.S. military spending.
   The company also threw a blanket prohibition on discretionary
spending such as employee travel and replacing non-critical
equipment.
   ``A number of elements have made these steps necessary,''
company president William P. Brown said.
   ``Competing in world markets, particularly with reductions in
defense spending, requires strong measures to be taken,'' he said
in a statement. ``McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Co. continues to be
an industry leader in financial strength as well as in the quality
of the products we produce.''
   His statement mentioned participation in trade shows as a
casualty in the retrenchment. Ironically, Brown and other top
officials could not be reached for comment because they were
attending a helicopter show in Dallas.
   Brown said the permanent layoffs will affect about 400 workers
at the base plant here and another 400 at the company's California
Manufacturing Center in Culver City, Calif. The layoffs will begin
Feb. 21, and the last day of work for those affected will be Feb.
23, he said.
   The company plans to host an employment fair to try to help
employees find new work in other ways, Brown said.
   Together, the layoffs affect more than 10 percent of the
company's workforce. The company, the helicopter-making subsidiary
of McDonnell Douglas Co. of St. Louis, employs 5,900 in Mesa and
1,650 in Culver City.
   McDonnell Douglas Helicopter laid off 450 Apache workers and
reduced part-time and contract work last May.
   About 3,200 production workers here manufacture the Apache.
   ``We must reduce our workforce to meet the reality of our
delivery schedule with the U.S. Army,'' Brown said.
   The plant has been producing the $9.9 million Apache for the
Army at the rate of 10 per month. Brown said that would be reduced
to six a month in June under a contract which ends in mid-1993.
   In addition, the company recently wrote off $137 million on
helicopter programs after re-estimating material costs of several
government contracts. The writedown contributed to a $17 million
operating loss in the fourth quarter of last year.
   Brown said the company retained hopes of strong international
sales of Apaches.

<HEAD>January Inflation 79.2 Percent; Feb. Figure May Not be Much Less</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Inflation was 79.2 percent in
January, pushing up the cost of living a hyperinflationary 8,164
percent over the past 12 months, according to the official National
Institute for Statistics and Census.
   Also Wednesday, the austral slipped 15.5 percent against the
U.S. dollar, falling to a rate of 2,960 to the dollar from
Tuesday's closing rate of 2,500. The plunge since last Friday's
closing rate of 1,990 to the dollar amounts to 32.8 percent.
   Bankers and analysts say the expansion of the money supply by
the Central Bank is fueling inflation and pushing investors to get
rid of their australs by buying dollars.
   The Central Bank, in need of funds to cover the national budget
deficit and to pay off bonds that are falling due, printed 1.3
trillion australs ($439 million at Wednesday's rate) in January, an
amount equivalent to 35.5 percent of the money supply.
   The government's inability to control inflation, the fiscal
deficit and the austral's value prompted International Monetary
Fund negotiators on Tuesday to withhold payment of the $230 million
second installment of a $1.4 billion loan approved last October.
   ``I can't claim things are going well because that would be
lying,'' President Carlos Menem told reporters. But he insisted the
economic situation was stabilizing, and the government will not
reimpose exchange controls to prop up the austral.
   The cost of living rocketed to 197 percent last July, the month
Menem took office. It gradually fell to single digits before
increasing six-fold last December to 40 percent.
   Inflation in 1989 was 4,923 percent. Inflation for the 12 months
between February 1989 and January 1990 was 8,164 percent.
   Private economists say triple-digit wage increases recently
approved by the government, and triple-digit hikes in public
service rates, are likely to push up the cost of living by at least
60 percent in February.

<HEAD>Crazy Eddie Founder Asserts Fifth Amendment on Bringing Back Funds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL J. WAKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eddie Antar's lawyers said he refuses to
repatriate $52 million because it might incriminate him, but a
judge said the reclusive founder of Crazy Eddie Inc. would have to
come to court himself if he wants to exercise his Fifth Amendment
rights.
   The Securities and Exchange Commission says it wants the money
brought back to this country in case it wins its insider trading
case against Antar. U.S. District Judge Nicholas H. Politan last
month ordered the money to be placed in the care of a trustee in
the United States.
   The judge rejected arguments Wednesday that the mere act of
repatriating the money could be seen as an admission of guilt, and
hence a violation of Antar's Fifth Amendment right against
self-incrimination.
   After his ruling, attorney Jack Arseneault said his client
refused to send back the money, and offered a sworn statement by
Antar asserting his right against self-incrimination. Politan was
not satisfied.
   ``I think I got to see his body,'' said the judge.
   Antar is believed to be living in New York City.
   Later in the day, Politan issued an order requiring Antar to
respond at 9:30 a.m. Thursday to why he should not be held in
contempt of court. Antar is expected to respond by pleading the
Fifth, which will then give his lawyers the opportunity to appeal
the contempt and repatriation orders to the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals.
   Without a contempt hearing, said Arseneault, Antar probably
could not appeal the repatriation order.
   The SEC sued Antar and other top officials of the chain for
insider trading. Antar allegedly directed a ``massive financial
fraud'' to artificially boost the company's income, enabling him to
sell his stock at falsely high prices and reap millions of dollars
in illegal profits.
   The SEC says Antar transferred the proceeds to bank accounts in
Israel and Grand Cayman Island in 1987.
   Through his attorneys, he has denied the charges.

   It looks as if it'll cost a nickel more to
mail a letter next year.
   The increase, which would be the first since 1988 and the
largest ever, will be before the Postal Service Board of Governors
when it meets March 6. If things follow their normal course, rates
would go up in February 1991 _ 11 months after the process begins.
   There have been proposals to raise the first-class rate to 28
cents to 32 cents for the first ounce, but Postmaster General
Anthony M. Frank sees 30 cents as the most likely.
   And he doesn't expect the raise to play well.
   Noting that a five-cent increase would be a 20 percent raise,
substantially above the 14 percent he projected that consumer
prices will have risen from 1988 to 1991, Frank said recently that
he was ``committed to paying back to the American people that six
percent'' difference.
   To do that, he has pledged to keep future increases below the
inflation rate and said Tuesday that ``we may very well be able to
hold increases in rates after the 1991 adjustments to one more
increase in the balance of this century.''
   That, he told the Postal Service board, ``would be no small
achievement.''
   Assuming the Postal Service board begins the process of raising
rates for all classes of mail, the independent Postal Rate
Commission will then ask for comment _ that should produce tons of
reports and appeals from various interest groups _ and hold lengthy
hearings before making its recommendation.
   It will then be up to the Postal Service board to put the new
rate into effect. Only once since the rate commission was created
in 1971 has it proposed a lower increase than the board had asked
for. In that case, the board overruled the recommendation and did
what it had proposed.
   While public attention focuses on the cost of sending a
first-class letter, the real battles occur over second- and
third-class charges.
   Advertising firms, charities and publishers of magazines and
newspapers inundate the rate commission with pleas to hold down
their portions of the overall rate hike.
   Although the Postal Service managed to post a $404 million
surplus in the last three months of 1989, the agency expects a
record $1.6 billion deficit for the fiscal year that will end Sept.
30. The outcome of contract negotiations this summer could make the
deficit even worse.
   Frank, addressing postal costs in remarks late last month, also
noted that the Postal Service was required in the last two years
``to contribute $800 million to deficit reduction, even though we
don't use a penny of tax money,'' and that ``health benefit costs
are out of control _ a problem we share with the private sector.''
   Frank's comments came in a Jan. 25 speech to the Economic Club
of Indianapolis. The Postal Service made a text of his remarks
available Thursday.
   The Postal Service was separated from the federal government in
1971 and tax subsidies were eliminated. It was later returned to
the federal budget _ at a time the agency was showing a surplus.
   Subsequently the Postal Service was taken back off the federal
budget, but was also required to cover some retirement and medical
payments for employees of the old U.S. Post Office Department. That
expense has added millions of dollars to the service's annual costs.
   Here is a rundown of the cost of mailing a first-class letter
since 1863, when the first flat rate was created at 2 cents per
half-ounce, together with the average Consumer Price Index for the
year shown. The CPI figures take the 1982-1984 average as 100. CPI
figures are unavailable for years before 1947.
   1885 _ 2 cents per ounce.
   1917 _ 3 cents.
   1919 _ 2 cents.
   July 6, 1932 _ 3 cents.
   Aug. 1, 1958 _ 4 cents, CPI 28.9.
   Jan. 7, 1963 _ 5 cents, 30.6.
   Jan. 7, 1968 _ 6 cents, 34.8.
   May 16, 1971 _ 8 cents, 40.5
   March 2, 1974 _ 10 cents, 49.3
   Dec. 31, 1975 _ 13 cents, 53.8

<TEXT>
   A group of the nation's largest cable television
system operators and a subsidiary of General Electric Co. are near
agreement on a joint venture that would test the viability of
delivering programming directly to customers via satellite, a
source familiar with the talks said Wednesday.
   The joint venture would include up to nine parties including the
cable giants Tele-Communications Inc., American Television and
Communications Inc. and Comcast Corp., according to the source who
spoke on condition that he not be identified.
   He said the deal could be announced as early as Thursday if
there are no last-minute hitches.
   The venture is being viewed as a test of a service that could
augment programming delivered by existing cable TV systems, freeing
up channel capacity on the systems, as well as a way to deliver
programming to rural areas not already served by cable.
   Recent reports in trade journals have indicated that the venture
would make use of GE's existing Satcom K1 Ku-band satellite for the
service.
   A report in Satellite Business News on Jan. 24 said the joint
venture would invest $100 million in research and development and
said it will take about 1 million subscribers to make the service
viable.

   Thirteen shareholders were elected to the
board of Freddie Mac on Tuesday at the company's first shareholders
meeting.
   Freddie Mac's voting stock, once owned exclusively by savings
and loans, began trading publicly for the first time last year. S&amp;L
legislation enacted in August provided for an 18-member board to

   The company finances about one in eight of U.S. homes, primarily
by purchasing mortgages from lenders and repackaging them into
securities for sale to investors.
   In addition to naming Leland C. Brendsel, Freddie Mac's
president and chief executive officer, to the board, the
shareholders named him the board chairman.
   The other new board members are:
   John C. Etling, General Reinsurance Corp.'s president; David W.
Glenn, Freddie Mac's executive vice president; George D. Gould,
former Treasury undersecretary; Barbara C. Jordan, a former member

spy agency in the savings and loan crisis.
   Rep. Frank Annunzio, chairman of the House Banking Committee's
financial institutions subcommittee, asked Webster in a letter
Monday to meet with the panel about a story in last Sunday's
Houston Post linking loans from 22 failed thrifts to people with
ties to organized crime or the CIA.
   ``The allegations relating to the involvement of the Central
Intelligence Agency, its employees, or individuals associated with
the agency, are serious and troubling,'' Annunzio, D-Ill., said in
the letter.
   The Houston newspaper said its sources suggested the CIA may
have used part of the proceeds from S&amp;L fraud to help pay for
covert operations that Congress was unwilling to support publicly.
   Meanwhile, Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said he has asked
Justice Department investigators to determine ``if there is any
shred of credibility due the article'' linking the CIA to failed
thrifts.
   Thornburgh, appearing on a National Public Radio listener
call-in program, said the inquiry was triggered by the newspaper
account. The attorney general stressed that he had no independent
information.
   A CIA spokesman has denied that the agency used S&amp;L funds to
finance covert activities.

<HEAD>Court Chides DeSoto But Upholds Poison Pill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Delaware court on Tuesday upheld DeSoto Inc.'s
``poison pill'' takeover defense but chided the company's directors
for failing to seek the best value for shareholders.
   DeSoto officials declined comment on the Chancery Court ruling.
   But New York investor William Spier, who is heading a hostile
takeover bid for the Des Plaines, Ill.-based paint-and-chemical
maker, said the ruling left DeSoto with few choices.
   ``DeSoto must now accept our $50 (a share) offer or provide
greater value to its stockholders,'' Spier said in a statement
issued by his takeover vehicle, Sutton Holding Corp.
   The court ruled that DeSoto had not taken steps necessary to
assure maximum shareholder value after rejecting Sutton's $300
million offer in November.
   DeSoto has been fending off Sutton with a shareholder rights
plan, known as a poison pill, that increases the number of
outstanding shares, thus making a takeover prohibitively expensive.
   Sutton had asked the Delaware court to strike down the poison
pill, but the court upheld the takeover defense.
   DeSoto also is seeking a buyer for its paint business, the core
of its operations. DeSoto says it no longer wants to compete in the
paint business but Sutton contends the proposed sale is a
desperation move designed to avoid a takeover.
   Last week, Sears, Roebuck and Co. said it was canceling its
contract with DeSoto, which has supplied paint to the retail giant
for 80 years, because of DeSoto's decision to sell its paint
operations.

   A pesticide plant that built public
confidence by installing safeguards and promising full disclosures
voided that trust by waiting three days to announce a leak of a
chemical that had killed 3,500 people in India, a county official
said Tuesday.
   Kanawha County commissioners called Rhone-Poulenc managers to
their offices to ask why Friday's one-ounce leak of methyl
isocyanate wasn't disclosed until Monday.
   At Tuesday's meeting, the plant's manager, Ron Bearer,
apologized and said the unit that leaked would remain closed
pending a safety review.
   ``In the area of getting information to the public, it's very
clear that we misjudged the situation,'' Bearer said. ``To correct
this situation in the future ... all releases of acutely toxic
materials, no matter how small, will be communicated.''
   The MIC unit had been shut down and Friday's leak occurred
during routine maintenance.
   The Occupational Safety and Health Administration said it would
investigate whether any laws were violated in the incident, which
injured seven.
   ``We've worked from the county commission's end with the people
at the plant to build up public confidence in the Institute area,''
county Manager Ron Gregory said. ``In one day, with one ounce of
MIC, they have destroyed that.''
   The letters ``MIC'' cause fear among many in West Virginia's
Chemical Valley, a concentration of two dozen chemical plants along
a 15-mile stretch of the Kanawha River. The Institute plant, 10
miles west of Charleston, is a former Union Carbide operation that
contains the only true sister unit to a Carbide operation at
Bhopal, India.
   A December 1984 leak at Bhopal killed more than 3,500 and
injured tens of thousands more. Engineers retooled the Institute
MIC unit afterward and installed millions of dollars worth of
safeguards. The plant was sold to Rhone-Poulenc in late 1986.
   Bearer, named the plant's manager just two weeks ago, said
Monday the company didn't have to inform the county about Friday's
leak because it involved less than a pound of material, none of
which would have escaped the plant.
   The chemical, used in agricultural pesticides, is so potent that
the amount in Friday's leak can injure eyes of workers 100 yards
away.
   Federal regulations require disclosure only if the incident
involves more than a pound of material or if there is a potential
for health threats beyond the plant border.
   Gregory said that when the chemical is MIC, stricter rules must
apply.
   ``Any situation where you don't tell the public what's
happening, the worst comes to mind,'' Gregory said. ``They alarmed
the public. If they would have announced on Friday that we had a
one-ounce leak of MIC, I don't think they would have had this
problem.
   Gregory said the Rhone-Poulenc plant had three minor incidents
Friday. Full details of two were called in to emergency service
personnel in Charleston.
   About the MIC leak, ``their planner did call the metro 911
operation and said, `We have a problem with a little vapor
escape,''' Gregory said. ``Two minutes later, they called back and
said, `All clear.'
   ``Not once did they mention it was MIC,'' Gregory said.
   The seven workers injured were employed by a Houston
construction contractor. The Rhone-Poulenc employees working on the
MIC unit weren't injured, Bearer said.
   Paul Pribyl, manager for Brown &amp; Root Construction said it is
plant policy to notify personnel when potentially hazardous work is
being done nearby. ``For some reason it wasn't followed in this
instance. There was some sort of breakdown in communications,'' he
said.
   In August 1985, Union Carbide officials waited 20 minutes to
notify emergency officials about an aldicarb oxime and methylene
chloride leak that injured 135.
   Union Carbide said the Bhopal leak occurred after saboteurs let
water into an MIC storage tank, setting off a reaction. The Indian
government accused Carbide of shoddy workmanship. The parties
agreed to a $470 million settlement that a new Indian government is
seeking to void.

<HEAD>Halliburton Reports Rise in 1989 Net Income</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Halliburton Co. reported its net income quadrupled
in the fourth quarter of 1989 as its oil patch services recovered.
   The company on Tuesday reported fourth quarter net income was
$45.7 million, or 45 cents a share, up from $11.8 million, or 11
cents a share, in the same period a year earlier.
   Operating income on oil field services and products totalled
$66.5 million in the latest quarter, compared with $800,000 a year
earlier.
   The division benefitted from an upturn in oil exploration and
development spending sparked by the rise in oil prices during the
period, Halliburton said.
   Operating income in engineering and construction services rose
to $18.5 million from $8.8 million, while insurance services fell
to $5.7 million from $7.9 million.
   Net income in all 1989 was $135 million, or $1.27 a share, up 44
percent from $93.6 million, or 89 cents a share, in 1988.

<HEAD>Austral Plunges Another 14.8 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The fall of the austral
accelerated Tuesday as Argentina's currency plunged by 14.8 percent.
   At the close of the business day, Argentines were paying 2,500
australs to buy one U.S. dollar, compared with 2,130 australs on
Monday and 1,990 last Friday.
   Analysts said the decline stemmed from the printing of unbacked
currency by the country's central bank. Inflation soared by 40
percent in December and is projected at 70 percent for January and
February.
   In part because the government failed to meet economic targets
promised earlier, an International Monetary Fund negotiating team
decided to withhold disbursement of $230 million this month to
Argentina. That sum would have been the second payment of a $1.4
billion loan approved last October.

<HEAD>Dealer Awarded $7.8 Million From Toyota</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An attorney for a dealer who was awarded $7.8
million from Toyota's American distributors says he is considering
a class-action suit over the companies' method of alloting cars to
dealers.
   ``I think this case will make a lot of dealers at least consider
they might want to do something,'' said James Brandenburg. ``Quite
frankly, I've already had dealers contact me about a class-action
suit on behalf of Toyota dealers across the country.''
   A U.S. District Court jury made the award to Pappas Toyota of
St. Charles Friday. Pappas contended in the three-year-old suit
that he was unfairly treated by Toyota Motor Distribution and
Toyota Motor Sales, both of Torrance, Calif.
   Brandenburg said the jury found Toyota had acted in bad faith
between 1982 and 1987 in allocating cars and trucks to Pappas,
resulting in lost sales for the dealer. The key witness for Pappas
was a University of Arizona faculty member who did a lengthy study
of Toyota distribution.
   Brandenburg said the so-called ``turn and earn'' system that
required dealerships to earn new cars by selling the ones on their
lots violated the contract between the dealer and the company,
which allowed the dealer to order whatever vehicles he desired.
   Jonathan Ries, an attorney for Toyota, said he was disappointed
by the verdict and is considering filing an appeal. He said Toyota
treated Pappas fairly.
   It was not the first time the issue has been tried in court.
   Brandenburg said he represented Jim Lynch Toyota in 1986 when
Lynch won $2 million in a similar lawsuit.
   The money awarded to Pappas represented the amount that the
dealership would have made had it been able to take delivery on
more vehicles from 1982 through 1987, Brandenburg said.
   Toyota has about 1,000 dealers in the United States.

<HEAD>Forbes' Forecast: Banner Decade After Shaky 1990</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RENO, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The 1990s will be a banner economic decade for
America despite a shaky beginning, the president and deputy editor
of Forbes Magazine predicted.
   ``It's going to be choppy in 1990, but after that we should have
what could be one of the best decades of this century,'' Malcolm
``Steve'' Forbes Jr., said Tuesday. ``I think that by the year's
end the economy will start to pick up.''
   Forbes, in Reno to promote a special Nevada advertising section
in his magazine, said Congress' failure to cut the capital gains
tax and instability in the value of the dollar are holding back an
economic boom in the United States.
   ``All of these things are reversible,'' said Forbes, who has won
four awards for economic forecasting from USX Corp.
   ``The key is the capital gains tax cut. That needs to pass to
get things going,'' he said.
   ``If we can avoid raising taxes, bashing the dollar or getting
into a trade war we should do well,'' he added.
   Forbes, a Republican, said people shouldn't worry about the
federal budget deficit because it amounts to only about 2 percent
of the country's gross national product. He also said the nation's
intractable trade deficit isn't a worry because it leads to growing
foreign investment in this country.
   ``People forget that for the first 100 years of this country
there was a trade deficit,'' Forbes said.

<HEAD>American Cyanamid Reports 37 Percent Drop in Fourth Quarter
Earnings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WAYNE, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Cyanamid reported a 37 percent drop
in fourth quarter earnings, blaming most of the drop on losses
suffered by a foreign subsidiary.
   The Wayne, N.J.-based biotechnology and chemical company
reported fourth quarter earnings of $38.5 million, or 41 cents a
share, compared with $60.8 million, or 65 cents a share, in fourth
quarter 1988.
   Unauthorized borrowings and previously unreported losses at an
overseas subsidiary reduced earnings by about $24 million, or 25
cents a share, the company said in a statement.
   Fourth quarter sales were $1.15 billion, up 4 percent from $1.10
billion a year earlier.
   Net earnings in 1989 were $292 million, or $3.12 a share,
compared with $295.6 million, or $3.16 a share in 1988.
