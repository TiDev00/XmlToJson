<TEXT>
   Here is the 250-163 roll call Tuesday by which
the House voted to withhold 50 percent of El Salvador's $85 million
in annual military aid. The largely symbolic vote was on an
amendment to a bill that was later defeated.
   A ``yes'' vote is a vote to withhold 50 percent of El Salvador's
military aid.
   Voting yes were 219 Democrats and 31 Republicans.
   Voting no were 28 Democrats and 135 Republicans.
   X denotes those not voting.
   Present denotes those who voted they were ``present'' at the
time of the vote but did not vote ``yes'' or ``no'' on the issue.
   There are two vacancies in the 435-member House.

<TEXT>
   Alexander Dubcek, ousted from power by the Soviet
22 years ago in Czechoslovakia, on Monday said Lithuanians should
negotiate their independence with Moscow and that neither side
should provoke the use of force.
   Dubcek, one of three senior officials in the Czechoslovak
government, ended a four-day official visit, his first since 1968,
with a meeting with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   He told a news conference that time and patience were needed to
resolve the impasse between the Kremlin and the breakaway Baltic
republic, which declared independence March 11.
   Dubcek said the Lithuanian declaration was ``something that
happened in such a way that solution is not possible today, but
will be possible tomorrow.''
   Although every nation has the right to self-determinaion, he
said, Lithuania and the Soviet Union should look for ``optimum
solutions and compromise to settle the issue and arrive at a
transition period during which emotions die down.''
   Both sides, Dubcek aid, ``should not lose patience, and avoid
any possible conflict.''
   As leader of the Czechoslovak Communist Party, he led the
``Prague Spring'' movement in 1968 and ran afoul of the Soviet
hardliners who ordered Warsaw Pact forces to invade on Aug. 21 that
year.
   Tass quoted Gorbachev as discussing the invasion with Dubcek.
   ``That action had a negative effect on the development of the
Soviet Union itself, led to a freeze of planned reforms and slowed
down the natural development of progressive processes and pushed
the country to the blind alleys of stagnation,'' Gorbachev said.

   The Mel Gibson-Goldie Hawn comedy ``Bird on a
Wire'' soared at the box office, finishing on top with ticket sales
of $15.3 million.
   The Univeral Pictures release averaged $7,890 per screen over
the weekend, more than double that of the other new summer film,
``Cadillac Man,'' according to figures released Tuesday by
Entertainment Data Inc.
   ``Cadillac Man,'' starring Robin Williams as a used car salesman
dodging love gone bad, debuted in second place with $6.7 million.
The poorly reviewed comedy should disappear soon as a wave of other
holiday titles arrives.
   In third was the Richard Gere-Julia Roberts comedy ``Pretty
Woman,'' with receipts of $6.3 million. Fourth were the
pizza-eating ``Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles,'' with $3.3 million.
``Ninja Turtles'' has grossed more than $114 million.
   Here are the top movie ticket sales for Friday through Sunday as
tallied by Entertainment Data, with distributor, weekend gross,
number of theater screens, average per screen, total gross and
number of weeks in release.

   Fast food is getting faster with a computerized
device introduced Monday that turns customers into order takers,
isn't rude and _ like regular clerks _ even asks if they wouldn't
like a soda with their fries.
   The ``8470'' computer would give customers more control over
their orders and increased employee efficiency amid a troubling
labor shortage, said officials at IBM, which developed the product,
and a fast-food chain that recently began using it.
   If a customer orders a sandwich and salad, for example, but no
soft drink, the screen illuminates a printed message saying,
``Would you like a refreshing soda?''
   As the customer places the order, it appears on similar screens
in the kitchen area, eliminating the need for clerks to shout or
walk orders back to the cooks.
   The system is designed for one clerk to handle two terminals for
two lines of customers.
   Bilingual versions are also available, IBM officials said in
unveiling the system at the National Restaurant Association's
international trade show.
   ``We think it's fantastic,'' said Mark Eagleton, vice president
of a branch of The Bailey Co., which manages about 60 Arby's roast
beef restaurants in five states. Bailey, based in Lakewood, Colo.,
is an independent Arby's franchisee and has installed eight of the
devices in its stores.
   Eagleton said the system ``has improved service times by about
20 seconds (per order); it's improved the accuracy of the orders.
It's increased our capacity for sales by allowing us to serve more
customers with the same amount of employees.''
   And, he said, ``customers buy more.''
   ``We've seen our average check ... go up between 9 cents and 40
cents (an order) per store,'' he said.
   Arby's is IBM's first client, with about 20 restaurants around
the country using the device. Eagleton says it's being used in
eight of his Arby's and will be installed in all new or remodeled
Arby's managed by his company.
   IBM also introduced a notebook-sized, radio-controlled order
board for use by clerks at drive-ins. The clerk intercepts
customers before they reach the pickup window and punches in the
order. It then appears on a screen in the kitchen and is ready by
the time the driver arrives at the window.
   It's being used in about 30 Wendy's hamburger restaurants
nationwide but also could be used in sit-down restaurants, said IBM
spokeswoman Cindy Beck.
   The devices come as the industry faces a shrinking work force,
Eagleton said.
   ``We're having a shortage of workers thoughout the '90s and if
we can automate more so that whatever workers we do have can be
used more effectively, it's going to have a substantial impact,''
he said.

   From Africa to Latin America to Eastern
Europe, Moscow's domain is crumbling.
   Soviet troops have left Afghanistan. The Marxist regime in
Nicaragua is history. Ethiopia and Mozambique are veering from
their rigid pro-Soviet ideologies.
   Not to mention the disintegration of the Iron Curtain.
   The speed of it all has taken Mikhail S. Gorbachev by surprise
and dramatically altered his stance as he heads into next week's
Washington summit meetings with President Bush.
   Soviet leaders and American presidents have met since Nikolai
Bulganin and Dwight Eisenhower gathered with the leaders of Britain
and France in 1955, 10 years after Josef Stalin won territorial
concessions at Yalta that some said helped tighten the Soviet grip
in Eastern Europe.
   For decades after Bulganin and Eisenhower met in Geneva, Moscow
widened its circle of influence, becoming, to Ronald Reagan in
1983, the ``evil empire.''
   How quickly things change. In less than a year:
   _ Poland and Hungary have held free elections, resoundingly
defeating candidates who represented the status quo.
   _ Czechoslovakia's Parliament elected dissident playwright
Vaclav Havel as president, replacing Communist Gustav Husak.
   _ Bulgaria's head of state, Todor Zhivkov, resigned.
   _ Nicolae Ceausescu was executed in Romania.
   _ East Germany dissolved its communist government and opened the
Berlin Wall. It is headed toward reunification with West Germany.
   Within the Soviet Union, Gorbachev's power is threatened by
ethnic and economic nationalists.
   He has been jeered by crowds in Red Square. He has been
criticized within the Communist Party for being too fast, or too
slow, in remaking the Soviet political and economic systems. He has
dispatched troops to quell ethnic violence.
   He has beseeched Lithuania, unsuccessfully, not to declare
itself independent. He is trying to cajole two other Baltic
republics, Latvia and Estonia, not to follow the Lithuanians.
   Gorbachev has applied increasing economic pressure to Lithuania
to rescind its declaration and President Bush has said the standoff
between Moscow and the Baltic republics ``certainly puts some
tension'' on the summit.
   In all, Gorbachev will go into the summit with less of a power
base than any of his postwar predecessors.
   ``It puts Gorbachev in a weakened position in which he basically
has to, in effect, ask the West for its indulgence as he tries to
ride out the crises,'' said Michael J. Sodaro, a George Washington
University political scientist and an expert on East Germany.
   ``On the other hand,'' Sodaro added, ``it puts the West in a
position in which we don't really want to take excessive advantage
of Gorbachev's internal problems for fear that there might be a
conservative backlash and Gorbachev would be deposed. He recognizes
that the West has an interest in his continuation in power.''
   Observers said they are sure that Gorbachev, in introducing
relative freedom of expression and political action to the Soviet
domain, did not anticipate the results.
   ``He came to power dealing with not only the problems left to
him by a Communist regime that has failed but by Russian history,''
said Arthur A. Hartman, U.S. amassador to Moscow from 1981 to 1987.
``I can't believe he didn't know he would have to deal with those
problems. On the other hand, I don't think he predicted exactly the
way things have gone.''
   Janusz Bugajski, an Eastern European specialist at the Center
for Strategic and International Studies, said, ``I don't think
there was any preplanning for what happened in Eastern Europe.
There was no blueprint. I think what happened was that Gorbachev
became educated during the late '80's as far as the likelihood of
some major revolution.''
   Sodaro said, ``I think even the most farsighted advisers to
Gorbachev were stunned by the rapidity of the dissolution of
Communism in Eastern Europe and East Germany.''
   The suddenness of those events, he added, is affecting the
attitude of Kremlin leaders toward developments in the Baltic.
   ``I don't think they want as rapid a disintegration of the
remaining part of the empire,'' Sodaro said.
   ``I think Gorbachev from the outset wanted to purge the Soviet
system from the vestiges of Stalinism, and certainly the
acquisition of the Baltic states can be chalked up to Stalin,''
said Sodaro. ``I think in the back of his mind he and his advisers
would have to expect this would happen. But I don't really think
that he intended from the outset to preside over the disintegration
of the Soviet empire.''

<TEXT>
   On this island where fantasy has long
dictated policy, reality is taking hold and may help improve
relations with China and stimulate democratic change at home.
   The myth has long been that the ruling Nationalist Party, which
retreated to Taiwan after losing a civil war to Communist forces in
1949, is still the legitimate government of China.
   That myth has long been used to justify the party's policy of no
official contact with the rival government in Beijing. It also has
long been used to justify the party's monopoly on political power.
   But events of the past week, culminating in the inaugural
address of President Lee Teng-hui on Sunday, indicate the days of
fantasy are drawing to a close.
   Lee was sworn in for a six-year term after being elected by the
electoral college and stressed his commitment to democracy.
   The Nationalist government still calls itself the ``Republic of
China'' and says reunification with the Chinese mainland is the
ultimate goal.
   But on Wednesday, Hau said something no top official had
previously acknowledged in public: The reality is that China today
is ``one country with two governments.''
   In his inauguration speech, Lee urged markedly improved
relations with Beijing and ``channels of communication'' that could
eventually lead to talks on reunification.
   In effect, Lee signaled a desire to end the 40-year-old
hard-line policy toward the Chinese Communists known as the ``three
nos'' _ no official contact, no negotiations and no compromise.
   There is a catch. The Nationalists want Beijing to renounce the
threat of force against Taiwan, end its policy of isolating Taiwan
diplomatically and scrap one-party Communist rule.
   China on Monday rejected such preconditions, saying Lee was
``ignoring the universally accepted fact that the People's Republic
of China is the sole legitimate government representing all Chinese
people.''
   While Taiwan does not expect an immediate breakthrough, its
leaders hope relations will improve as civilian and business
contacts expand. Indirect trade across the Taiwan Straits was $4
billion last year, and Taiwan residents made 1 million visits to
the Chinese mainland since such travel was first allowed in late
1987.
   ``We want gradually to expand our contact by peaceful ways,''
government spokesman Shaw Yu-ming recently told foreign
journalists. ``We have to move in measured steps. ... It's not a
very action-packed kind of approach.''
   Lee also said he wanted to quickly scrap the 1947 ``Mobilization
for the Supression of the Communist Rebellion.''
   Not only would this mean Taiwan would no longer view the Beijing
government as a rebel group, but it would also lift temporary legal
provisions that have guaranteed the Nationalist Party a lock on
power.
   Under the provisions, the Legislature and electoral college are
dominated by Nationalists, elected on mainland China before the
civil war defeat. The theory is they cannot be replaced until their
constituencies are recaptured and new elections held.
   But the mainland-elected parliamentarians are dying fast and the
island's 20 million people, 85 percent of whom are native
Taiwanese, want a greater say in government.
   Lee on Sunday gave a two-year timetable for replacing the
provisions with constitutional amendments that would establish ``a
great model of political democracy for all times.''
   He also stressed the importance of securing fair competition
among political parties, indicating an understanding that future
legitimacy must come from the people.
   Still, the promise of greater democracy is viewed skeptically by
many students and opposition party members. They view Lee's
decision to nominate the country's only four-star general as
premier a step back toward the Nationalists' authoritarian past.
   But the nomination of Defense Minister Hau Pei-tsun also is
viewed less sinisterly as an attempt by Lee to shore up his support
among party elders and to crack down on rampant corruption and
crime.
   Government spokesman Shaw said military rule or a return to
authoritanism would be impossible.
   ``Nobody in this land, no party, no group ... no individuals,
can turn the clock back,'' he said. ``Military rule, military
dictatorship or even authoritarian-type of politics cannot ... be
accepted by our people.''

   ``Twin Peaks'' returns to ABC's fall schedule
despite slipping ratings in a ``bold experiment'' to lure viewers
back to the tube on Saturday nights, the network's entertainment
chief says.
   ``When you think about it, the idea grows on you,'' Robert A.
Eiger told a gathering of network advertisers Monday.
   ``One, there are a lot of young adult viewers home on Saturday
night with nothing to watch so they go out and rent videotapes. And
two, we think this show can prosper when we move it away from that
real tough `Cheers' competition on Thursday night.''
   NBC, revealing its fall schedule later in the day, went for the
laugh track with six situation comedies among nine new shows. That
makes 17 sitcoms on NBC next fall, its most ever.
   ABC opens its Saturday night gamble with the Western ``Young
Riders,'' followed by the critically praised Vietnam series ``China
Beach'' and then ``Twin Peaks,'' the moody drama created by film
director David Lynch.
   ``We're going for the gold with three special programs in an
all-out attempt to change the perception of Saturday night
television,'' Eiger said.
   ``Twin Peaks'' will debut with a two-hour movie and will take
less of a serial approach, more akin to ``Hill Street Blues,'' he
said.
   NBC's hourlong series are ``Signs of Life,'' a
patient's-eye-view ``reality'' program about medicine; ``Law and
Order,'' about criminal justice from arrest through trial, and the
musical comedy ``Hull Street High.''
   The network, which just won the prime time ratings for the fifth
consecutive season, renewed ``Grand,'' ``Wings'' and ``Carol &amp;
Co,'' but axed 4-season-old ``ALF,'' ``227,'' ``Baywatch,'' ``My
Two Dads'' and `Mancuso FBI.''
   Two of NBC's new sitcoms are based on movies, ``Parenthood'' and
``Ferris Bueller.'' The others are rap-driven ``Fresh Prince of Bel
Air,'' ``The Fanelli Boys'' and ``Working It Out,'' which co-stars
Jane Curtin, formerly of CBS' ``Kate &amp; Allie,'' playing a divorced
person.
   ABC, with six new shows, also offers a musical hour in Steven
Bochco's ``Cop Rock,'' an intriguing combination of police action
and Randy Newman's music reminiscent of the PBS hit ``The Singing
Detective.''
   ABC dropped six low-rated series: ``Elvis,'' tales of the King
when he was a youth, ``Brewster Place,'' with Oprah Winfrey,
``Capital News,'' ``The Marshall Chronicles,'' `H.E.L.P.'' and
``Sunset Beat.''
   CBS' schedule may come out later this week or early next week, a
spokesman said. Fox Broadcasting said it will release its lineup
May 29.
   ``Twin Peaks,'' a tangled saga of sex, lies and death in the
Northwest, was this season's most talked-about series. It started
strong on April 8, winning with a 21.7 rating, but has lost more
than 50 percent of its viewers.
   Its season finale Wednesday should have high ratings because it
resolves the murder of high school beauty queen Laura Palmer, a
mystery that prompted ``I Killed Laura Palmer'' T-shirts in
California.
   Last Thursday's show gave the series its lowest Nielsens to date
_ a 10.6 rating and a 17 percent audience share. Each ratings point
represents 921,000 homes.
   Other ABC renewals include the high-rated ``Roseanne'' and
``thirtysomething,'' ``Life Goes On'' and ABC News' ``PrimeTime
Live'' and ``20-20.''
   Three of the new series on ABC's roster are sitcoms _ ``Baby
Talk,'' based on the hit movie ``Look Who's Talking''; ``Going
Places,'' about four young adults in Los Angeles working on their
first TV show _ a ``candid videos'' series; and ``Married People,''
about three generations of couples sharing a brownstone in New York.
   Capitalizing on its top-rated ``America's Funniest Home
Videos,'' ABC also will have ``America's Funniest ... Part II.''
   James Earl Jones, whose ``Paris'' police series on CBS flopped a
decade ago, will try again in a new hourlong ABC series,
``Gabriel's Fire,'' playing an ex-convict working as a private
investigator for a defense attorney.

   Daffy Duck, Porky Pig, Wile E.
Coyote and 130 ``Looney Tunes'' short cartoons starring the
animation heroes will return to movie theaters across the nation,
it was announced Monday.
   The 5- to 7-minute cartoons will be shown for one year before
most feature films in the 1,700 screens of AMC Theatres, said Ed
Durwood, president of AMC Entertainment.
   ``Looney Tunes'' have not been shown in regular national
screenings in 20 years.
   The shorts will debut in Los Angeles this week with additional
theaters to be added Friday and throughout the summer, he said.
   ``We will take great pains to rotate the mix so that by the end
of a year, all cities should have seen all 130 titles,'' Durwood
said. ``We want to give people a reason to come to the theaters. We
want the movie-going experience to be a little nicer.''
   A few serious dramas and some animated films will be shown
without the ``Looney Tunes'' trailers, Durwood said.
   The upcoming ``Dick Tracy,'' which Disney is distributing with a
new ``Roger Rabbit'' animated trailer, will also be shown without a
``Looney Tune'' short.

   The last ``Newhart'' aired Monday night, the
184th episode of the long-running CBS situation comedy, and it
closed with a surprise ending, of sorts.
   As innkeeper Dick Loudon, comedian Bob Newhart presided over the
Stratford Inn for eight seasons, a frustrated pillar of reason
among various rustics, zanies and spoiled yuppie brats afflicting
the town of Stratford, Vt.
   In Monday's episode, the townspeople sold their town _ lock,
stock and barrel _ to a Japanese businessman who erects ``the
luxurious, 5,000-room Tagadachiville Hotel.'' Dick is the only
holdout, of course.
   Flash forward five years: The inn is a hazard on the 14th
fairway of the hotel's golf course, and, as golf balls batter the
inn's clapboards, Dick's wife Joanna, (Mary Frann) scurries about
in black wig and kimono.
   Their Japanese maid is thoroughly spoiled and their handyman
always wears a suit and tie. Dick is depressed. Just when things
look their worst, the townspeople return for their five-year
reunion.
   The returnees include Larry (``Hi, I'm Larry and this is my
brother Darryl and my other brother Darryl.'') and his perpetually
silent brothers. They bring their talkative wives, Rhonda, Sada and
Zora.
   Darryl and Darryl spoke! They told their wives to be quiet.
   Stehpanie and Michael Harris (Julia Duffy and Peter Scolari)
returned with their spoiled daughter, as do Jim (Thomas Hill) and
Chester (William Lanteau).
   As the townspeople settle in, Dick is hit on the head by a golf
ball and wakes in the bedroom of Chicago psychotherapist Bob
Hartley, the bemused hero of Newhart's 1972-78 first sitcom on CBS,
``The Bob Newhart Show.''
   Bob Hartley wakes his wife, Emily, (Susanne Pleshette), and
tells her of the terrible dream he had.
   A television station in Schenectady, N.Y., that cut off part of
the last scene for a news update was so deluged with calls that it
ran seven seconds of ``Newhart'' at the end of its newscast.
   WRGB-TV in upstate New York cut off the show because it ran
overtime, said Gary Whitaker, the news director. The network had
warned local stations the show would run two minutes overtime, he
said.
   ``Newhart'' was the comedian's third incarnation on network TV.
First there was ``The Bob Newhart Show'' on NBC in 1961-62, a
variety show which won the Emmy and Peabody awards. Then there was
``The Bob Newhart Show'' sitcom on CBS. Then ``Newhart'' began in
1982.
   As the actor-comedian already has observed, they're thinking of
calling his next CBS series ``The.''

   Paul Newman has developed five new varieties of
salad dressing for Burger King and will be seen in the fast-food
chain's TV commercials beginning today.
   The ads feature clips of Newman undressing in such films as
``The Sting,'' ``The Prize'' and ``Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,'' and
advise viewers: ``For years, you've seen Paul Newman undressing.
Now you can see Paul Newman dressing.''
   Burger King will offer the new dressings alongside the actor's
original Newman's Own Oil &amp; Vinegar at its 6,000 restaurants.
   ``This all-natural product will help `shake up' awareness of our
salad line,'' said Gary Langstaff, executive vice president of
marketing for Burger King.
   Newman donates profits from his food company to charity.

   Peter Yarrow of Peter, Paul and Mary says the
folk group's sing-along ``Puff the Magic Dragon'' has two meanings,
and neither is about drugs as once rumored.
   ``It's ostensibly a song about the moment of loss of innocence.
When that moment occurs, it is sad indeed,'' the singer told 300
Augsburg College graduates. ``But it's about something else. It is
about the loss of our ideals.''
   In his commencement speech Sunday, Yarrow spliced folk songs
with comments on the need for global thinking and the power of the
individual to bring about change.
   Yarrow is affiliated with the college's Center for Global
Education, which arranges for educational travel to the Third World.
   ``If you want to, we can make history together,'' he said. ``If
you acknowledge there is suffering, think globally, act globally.
If there is a single lesson from the '60s, it is the belief in our
own capacities as individuals. We all matter.''

   Music publisher Don Kirshner, best known for
his TV rock show, hits the radio airwaves this weekend with the
first installment of a 35-hour rock revue.
   His first radio project, ``DK-35,'' will air in 15 installments
on more than 200 stations nationwide and will include conversations
with music stars.
   Among them: Roy Orbison, who in an interview just before his
death in 1988 spoke about meeting a then-unknown John Lennon.
   ``Basically, I'm doing firsthand experiences,'' said Kirshner,
56. His career in music began in 1955 when he met Bobby Darin, who
later recorded ``Dream Lover'' and ``Queen of the Hop.''
   ``Don Kirshner's Rock Concert'' came to television in 1972 and

Billy Joel to the Police along with comics Billy Crystal, Arsenio

<HEAD>Oyster Outlook Bleak For Galveston Bay Because of Flooding</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL GRACZYK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SMITH POINT, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rainwater funneling into salty
Galveston Bay from the flooded Trinity River is muddying the
outlook for the Texas oyster industry.
   In Louisiana and five other Texas bays on the Gulf of Mexico,
the crop is expected to be good and retail prices could drop from
the current level of $4.50 to $5 a pound, said Ben Nelson, an
oyster harvester and exporter.
   But he said 90 percent of the crop in Galveston Bay will be
killed _ 100 percent if the fresh water runs into the bay through
July.
   ``There will be little to none,'' said sister-in-law Doris
Nelson, who with her husband operates three boats on the bay and
ships oysters as far as the East Coast. ``It was already kind of
bleak and we're just struggling to come back from last year's
flood. Now it looks like this year is going to be taken away too.''
   Officials are expecting large releases of fresh water to
continue down the Trinity well into the summer as the torrential
rains of several weeks ago more than 200 miles to the north
continue to drain into Galveston Bay.
   The high waters that have inundated thousands of acres of
cropland and displaced hundreds of residents now threaten the
livelihoods of the oyster harvesters.
   ``They have lots to fear, based on the amount of water that's
projected to come,'' said Sammy Ray, former professor of marine
biology at Texas A&amp;M University in Galveston. ``With this coming
down, probably a large number of oysters will be lost. When the
water warms up and when they open, they lose whatever body salt
content they have.
   ``And when they get completely fresh, they blow up like a
balloon. They're dead.''
   Last year, hurricanes and a tropical storm dumped fresh water
into the bay and ruined last year's oyster crop.
   ``My guesstimate is that it's pretty much going to wipe out the
oyster harvest this year,'' said Gil Moody, marketing specialist
with the Texas Department of Agriculture. ``In the short term, it's
a disaster for fishermen. There are 560 oyster dredges that work
Galveston Bay, and it pretty much puts them out of business.''
   Compared with the $600 million shrimp business in Texas, the
oyster industry is small.
   ``But $12 million is not to be laughed at,'' said C.E. Bryan,
regional director of the state Department of Parks and Wildlife.
``It's the livelihood of 1,100 people.''
   The news is not all bleak if there is no serious flooding next
year. Fresh water kills oyster predators like crabs, eels,
starfish, stingrays, snails and fungus that thrive in highly salty
water.
   ``The oyster population could come back and quite often they
have bumper crops three or four years following,'' Ray said.

   The last time New Mexico tinkered with its
election system, Democrat Bruce King in 1970 became the state's
first governor in more than 50 years to be elected to a four-year
term.
   Twenty years later, New Mexico again has changed the rules and
King is among eight candidates hoping to become the state's first
governor to be eligible to serve two consecutive four-year terms.
   The chance to serve eight straight years has attracted four
Democrats and four Republicans to the June 5 gubernatorial
primaries, the largest field in 16 years. Republican Gov. Garrey
Carruthers was not eligible to run.
   ``I thought it would be a real opportunity to have an agenda and
get something accomplished, because you'd be the first governor in
a long, long time not to be a lame duck,'' said Democratic hopeful
Paul Bardacke, an Albuquerque lawyer. ``One four-year term has been
very bad for this state, because we haven't developed any
continuity in government.''
   New Mexico's governors were limited to two consecutive, two-year
terms until 1970. For the next 20 years, they were elected to
four-year terms but incumbents could not seek re-election.
   This year's Democratic primary has been largely a battle between
Bardacke and King, a 66-year-old rancher and businessman who offers
voters the experience he gained in eight years as governor.
   Four GOP contenders, meanwhile, are hoping to become the first
Republican governor to succeed a GOP incumbent since 1920.
   King, who served longer than anyone else in the state's history,
was elected to his first four-year term in 1970 and to his second
in 1978.
   In the Democratic field, King led Bardacke in the most recent
Albuquerque Journal poll by roughly 48 percent to 25 percent. But
pollster Brian Sanderoff said the primary's outcome still could
hinge on undecided Democrats who are unlikely to vote for King.
   Bardacke, 45, a former attorney general, is urging Democrats to
seek new ideas and ``choose the future.'' He has attacked King's
record, accusing him of cronyism, citing financial problems and
questioning his ability to muster fresh ideas with a staff largely
recycled from his 1979-82 term.
   King responded with a flurry of position papers outlining
far-reaching programs in areas such as education, the environment
and crime, but Bardacke has questioned how King would pay for
scores of new initiatives.
   King says state revenues have nearly doubled since he was last
governor, to almost $2 billion this year, and that ``what they need
is someone to manage the amounts of money they have.''
   The two other Democrats are former Supreme Court Chief Justice
Tony Scarborough and lobbyist and former state economic development
chief Bob Gold.
   The two top GOP contenders are Frank Bond, a former state
legislator and former chairman of the Commission on Higher
Education, and Les Houston, the state Senate Republican leader.
   The Journal's May poll showed the GOP race to be a virtual dead
heat between the two, with each drawing about one-fourth of the
Republican support and 40 percent undecided.
   Bond, 46, has drawn much of incumbent Carruthers' party support.
He figures none of the other three Republicans candidates, all from
Albuquerque, will claim a majority of that city's GOP vote, which
accounts for nearly 40 percent of the state's Republicans.
   Houston, who was a Democrat until 1986, has formed a
conservative coalition in the Senate and is counting on
conservative Democrats to help him win in November.
   Also running in the GOP primary is former Albuquerque Mayor
Harry Kinney, who has campaigned on a plan to establish
mega-landfills for the nation's solid waste. The other Republican
candidate is state Sen. James A. Caudell, who co-sponsored the 1986
two-term amendment in the Legislature.

   OK, tourists, you've seen the top of the
Washington Monument and gotten foot blisters at the Smithsonian.
It's time to get off the sightseeing bus and discover some obscure,
quirky monuments that the guidebooks don't bother to mention.
   Here, free of charge, is a list of milestones on the road less
traveled by visitors to the nation's capital:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>The Temperance Fountain</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   A miniature temple supported by four granite columns and topped
by a bronze water crane, symbolizing the purity of water over
liquor, this unusual drinking fountain is situated across
Pennsylvania Avenue from the National Archives. Ironically, it once
stood outside a liquor store.
   The fountain was donated to the city in 1880 by Dr. Henry D.
Cogswell, a San Francisco dentist who hoped passersby would quench
their thirst with water instead of booze. Its canopy is inscribed
with good Victorian virtues _ Faith, Hope, Charity, Temperance _
and its entwined dolphins still spout cooling water, but the horse
trough is gone.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>The ``Air Mail'' Monument</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   On the edge of the Potomac River, beside a jogging and cycling
path midway between the Lincoln and Jefferson memorials, is a large
boulder with a plaque marking the site of the landing strip where
the world's first airmail flight began on May 15, 1918, carrying
150 pounds of mail to Philadelphia and New York.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>The Rawlins Statue</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   This is probably the most-traveled statue in Washington. This
memorial to Civil War Gen. John A. Rawlins moved four times around
the city _ and was bumped to make room for a statue of Benjamin
Franklin, a government building and a public toilet _ before it
returned to its original site in a park near George Washington
University. A proposal to move the statue to Rawlins, Wyo., one of
the general's former campsites, was vetoed.
   Rawlins was aide-de-camp to Gen. Ulysses S. Grant. Historians
say Rawlins distinguished himself by persuading the Union commander
to quit drinking to excess during the war years.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>The Maine Lobsterman</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The Camp Fire Girls of Cundys Harbor, Maine, led the campaign to
install this $30,000 statue, a replica of one that appeared at the
1939 New York World's Fair, in a small park on the Washington
waterfront near Maine Avenue. It shows a dour-looking man kneeling
to fondle his favorite crustacean.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>The Penguin Fountain</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   In front of Walter Reed Army Hospital, off upper 16th Street
N.W., is a huge urn guarded by four penguins spitting water into
the air as they stand on pedestals decorated with cobras. The
fountain is a widow's memorial to Col. John Van Rensselaer Hoff, a
prominent figure in the Army Medical Corps. The penguins and cobras
are believed to symbolize Hoff's service in the Arctic and the
Philippines.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Nuns of the Battlefield Monument</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Civil War nuns _ not fighting nuns but nursing nuns _ are
honored by this large bronze relief panel erected in 1924 by the
ladies' auxiliary of the Ancient Order of the Hibernians. After it
was installed at a downtown intersection near Connecticut Avenue,
the sculptor had a fight on his hands. He filed a $45,000 lawsuit
against the ladies for alleged non-payment.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Japanese Pagoda</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Nestled in a grove of Japanese cherry trees near the Tidal
Basin, this 3,800-pound, nine-tiered sculpture from the mayor of
Yokohama caused much consternation when it arrived in 1957. It was
shipped in pieces in five wooden crates, without any instructions
for assembling it. Experts from the Library of Congress helped
solve the puzzle.

<HEAD>Economic Seers Say No Recession But Weak Growth On The Way</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's top economic forecasters, who
just a year ago were predicting a recession this year, now say the
economy will avoid a decline through 1991 and set a new record for
business expansion.
   The latest survey of 68 professional forecasters by the National
Association of Business Economists found 82 percent saying the
economy would continue to advance slowly through the end of next
year.
   That reversed the findings of a similar poll last May that found
63 percent of the economists believing a recession would occur this
year. Ninety-six percent of those polled for the current survey now
rule that out.
   If growth continues through 1991, the expansion will have lasted
109 months, topping the previous record when the economy grew 106
months during the Vietnam war years from February 1961 to December
1969.
   The current expansion began 90 months ago in November 1982 at
the end of the last recession.
   The survey was conducted in April and May.
   But despite seeing no recession, the forecasters do not foresee
strong economic growth either.
   ``The outlook for 1990 is for slower economic growth than in
1989,'' when the economy advanced 3.0 percent, the survey found.
``Weaker increases in real consumption and business spending on
plant and equipment combine with a smaller improvement in the trade
deficit to cause much of the slowdown.''
   The economists also predict unemployment to rise from 5.2
percent in 1989 to 5.4 percent this year. Automobile sales will
fall from 9.9 million last year to 9.6 million this year. Housing
starts will remain unchanged at 1.39 million.
   Overall, the forecasters said the economy as measured by the
gross national product would grow 2.0 percent this year and 2.4
percent in 1991. The GNP is the total output of goods and services.
   At the same time, the forecasters said inflation, which rose 8.1
percent in the first quarter, reflecting in part weather-related
jumps in food and energy prices, will drop to an annual rate of 3.7
percent in the final nine months of the year. That would make the
1990 inflation rate 4.7 percent, down from 4.8 percent in 1989.
   On the twin deficits, the economists said trade would fall from
a $53 billion imbalance in 1989 to $44 billion this year while the
federal budget gap would continue to widen.
   The economists forecast a budget shortfall of $154 billion in
the fiscal year ending Sept. 30 and $135 billion in fiscal 1991.
   The Gramm-Rudman balanced budget law sets deficit targets of
$100 billion this year and $64 billion in 1991. The actual deficit
for fiscal 1989 was $152 billion.
   Interest rates, which are blamed for the current economic
sluggishness, are projected to remain near their current levels
this year before declining slightly in 1991, the forecasters said.
   Rates for 90-day Treasury bills will edge down from 7.9 percent
in June 1990 to 7.8 percent at year's end and 7.7 percent by the
end of 1991, they predicted. Rates for 30-year Treasury bonds will
fall from 8.7 percent next month to 8.6 percent in December and 8.4
percent at the end of 1991.

<HEAD>Middle East Shooting Sprees Blamed On Lack Of Peace Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States says the lack of a Middle
East peace process played a role in the violence that flared in
Israel after an allegedly deranged Israeli gunman killed seven
Palestinian workers.
   State Department deputy spokesman Richard Boucher deplored the
initial killings as ``a horrible senseless act of a madman.''
   But he was critical of the force with which the Israeli army
cracked down on subsequent Arab rioting, leaving an additional 10
Palestinians dead and at least 94 wounded.
   ``We see that as another sign that there must be a peace
process,'' Boucher told reporters.
   ``In the absence of a peace process the potential for this kind
of senseless violence and spiraling responses afterwards goes up,''
he said.
   ``We regret the violence that occurred after this incident,''
Boucher said and added:
   ``We're disturbed by the number of casualties inflicted by the
Israeli army.''
   The Bush administration has been striving for months to get
talks underway in Cairo between Israel and representatives of
Palestinian Arabs.
   But Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, objecting to some of
the provisions, refused to endorse the plan.
   The Israeli government collapsed in the midst of the controversy
and neither Shamir nor Labor Party Leader Shimon Peres has been
able to form a new government.
   The suspect in the slayings, Ami Popper, appeared in Israeli
court on Monday and was ordered to undergo psychiatric evaluation.
Police said Popper was suicidal after breaking up with his
girlfriend.
   Although Boucher was critical of the apparent lack of restraint
displayed by Israeli forces, he commended the actions of Jordanian
authorities responding to the shooting of French tourists, an
incident apparently triggered by the Israeli slayings.
   Eight French tourists and a Jordanian bystander were wounded in
the attack.
   Jordanian police acted quickly to protect foreign tourists and
to contain protest demonstrations at a Palestinian refugee camp,
Boucher said.
   ``I think these were valuable steps,'' he said.

<HEAD>Safety Board Recommending Mandatory Infant Seats</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: NTSB meeting begins 9 a.m. EDT; prenoon lead expected</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parents would have to get small children their
own airline seats and use approved restraints rather than carry
them free on their laps, under a recommendation being considered
today by the National Transportation Safety Board.
   Whether all seats must be paid for would be up to airlines,
which have indicated they would still give available seats to
children under 2 years old. But a family traveling to see grandma
and grandpa might not want to take the chance that a free seat will
be there when they board.
   The NTSB scheduled a vote on the recommendation today. Even if
approved by the safety board, the proposal would have to clear the
Federal Aviation Administration before going into effect.
   The FAA has questioned the safety benefits of mandatory infant
seats and proposes only to require that airlines allow their use
when a passenger provides one. The agency has said, however, it
would consider proposals for a stricter rule.
   The airline industry's Air Transport Association reversed its
earlier opposition to mandatory seats in February, petitioning the
FAA for a federal rule requiring them.
   The independent safety board's recommendation also adds to
support by consumer safety groups, flight attendants and others for
increased protection of children aboard commercial airliners.
   Some travel agents oppose the measure, saying it would add to
the cost of flying for young families and possibly force them to
travel by automobile on shorter routes. They say automobile travel
poses greater risks per mile than flying.
   Most carriers already allow infant seats to be used, giving the
child free passage if an empty seat is available for strapping in
the restraint. But when there are no empty seats, babies may still
be boarded without an assigned seat.
   Under a rule making infant seats mandatory, no child of any age
would be allowed on the plane without an assigned seat.
   FAA officials have said they are concerned about the burden a
mandatory rule would put on travelers when the number of children
killed in airplane crashes is low.
   A Harvard Medical School statistical study in the early 1980s
theorized that three infants might be saved over five years if all
children used safety seats on airliners. Estimates of the number of
infants flying range from 5,000 to 10,000 a day.
   ``We don't think there is any safety justification for either
requiring the airlines to give up a seat for free or for requiring
a parent to purchase a seat if they don't want to,'' said FAA
spokesman Fred Farrar in February.
   Concern over infant safety aboard airliners increased with the
death of 23-month-old Evan Tsao in the July 19 crash of United
flight 232 in an Iowa corn field.
   The boy's mother, Sylvia Tsao, was among survivors of the crash
that killed 112 people. Proponents of the seat rule say the boy,
who died of smoke inhalation, might have lived if he had been
strapped in next to his mother.

<HEAD>Tailor-Made Antibodies Reverse Lethal Skin Cancer</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tailor-made antibodies can dramatically
reverse spreading melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer, when
injected directly into the tumors, researchers say.
   The work, though still in its preliminary stages, suggests that
it may be possible to stop the disease by harnessing the body's own
built-in defenses.
   Antibodies are among the body's principal weapons for fighting
off a variety of foreign invaders, including cancer. In this case,
scientists crafted human antibodies in the test tube that were
specifically targeted against the cancer. Then they injected them
into cancerous growths on victims' skin.
   ``The lesions dry up and regress,'' said Dr. Donald Morton,
director of the John Wayne Surgical Oncology Clinic at the
University of California, Los Angeles.
   In initial studies, Morton and colleagues gave the injections to
28 people whose melanoma came back after initial surgery. In 18 of
them, the shots caused partial or complete disappearance of the
growths.
   The doctors injected three different kinds of antibodies. Each
recognizes a different chemical structure that is unique to cancer
cells.
   The antibodies latch onto these chemical structures, marking the
cancer cells for destruction by other patrolling white blood cells.
To the researchers' surprise, they found that the cancer patients
began making more of these antibodies on their own.
   ``We are actually stimulating immunity with this treatment,''
said Morton. ``We don't know why, but it is happening.''
   Morton presented his findings Monday at the annual meeting of
the American Society of Clinical Oncology.
   ``I was quite impressed by the response rate,'' commented Dr.
Carol Westbook of the University of Chicago. ``It appears to be a
promising treatment that warrants further investigation.''
   However, Dr. Bruce Cheson of the National Cancer Institute
cautioned that melanoma is particularly hard to study. The course
of the disease can be difficult to predict, and the cancer may go
away for reasons that have nothing to do with the experimental
treatment.
   Melanoma is curable in about 90 percent of cases when it is
caught early. However, it is fatal if it progresses and spreads
throughout the body.
   Melanoma, like other, less dangerous forms of skin cancer, can
result from over-exposure to the sun, and people with light
complexions or irregularly shaped moles are at highest risk.
   An estimated 27,000 new cases will be diagnosed in the United
States this year, and the disease is believed to be increasing at a
rate of 3 percent or 4 percent a year.
   Among other research presented at the meeting:
   _The acne drug Accutane appears to significantly reduce the risk
of second cancers in people who undergo treatment for
smoking-related tumors of the mouth and throat. In a comparison
study on 100 people, Dr. Waun K. Hong of M.D. Anderson Cancer
Center in Houston presented evidence that the drug, a synthetic
form of vitamin A, suppresses abnormal growths from turning
cancerous.
   Also on Monday, medical experts advising the Food and Drug
Administration said stronger efforts are needed to make sure women
do not use Accutane during pregnancy because it can cause birth
defects. The advisory committees rejected the advice of some within
FDA who want Accutane withheld from all women to eliminate any risk
of birth defects from the drug.
   _Granulocyte colony stimulating factor, a genetically engineered
substance that speeds up production of white blood cells, can
offset a major side effect of cancer treatment. Often people
receiving chemotherapy must stop their medication because the drugs
lower their blood counts, leaving them open to infection.
   Dr. Jeffrey Crawford of Duke University Medical Center tested
the growth factor on 126 lung cancer patients and found that it
reduced low blood counts and infected-related fever by 44 percent.
   _A study by Dr. Charles G. Moertel and others from the Mayo
Clinic helps doctors handle the dilemma of how to treat colon
cancer patients whose tumors have spread through the bowel wall but
have not visibly invaded the lymph nodes. Since three-quarters can
be saved with surgery alone, doctors are reluctant to offer
chemotherapy.
   The new study found ways of identifying the 25 percent whose
tumors are highly likely to spread. Moertel found that those whose
tumors have unusual genetic characteristics or have perforated the
bowel would probably benefit from chemotherapy.

   If you want to learn the ``zucchini method'' of
playing the piano or need sheet music to ``Furry Lice'' by
Beethoven, the Carl Fischer store is the place to go.
   Customers who fracture the language and the lyrics don't deter
the music-trained salesclerks _ but it helps if they can hum a few
bars.
   ``It's better than when they tell you they're looking for a
certain music book and all they know is that it's green,'' said
Larry Heidel, floor manager at Carl Fischer, which stocks 610,000
titles and bills itself as the world's largest music store.
   Just before closing time Monday, Heidel and two salesmen stood
at the counter as a young woman sang, ``I love you,'' then dropped
off into a hum.
   She was the fourth hummer of the day at Fischer, where singing,
whistling and tapping on the counter are an acceptable substitute
for knowing the name of what you want.
   ``A lot of them are just like your average Joe who takes his
first piano lesson and his teacher tells him to get something but
he doesn't write it down,'' said salesman Tom Potter. ``Or people
hear something on the radio and don't catch the title.''
   Then there's that business about music being the universal
language of mankind. ``A lot of times titles are in foreign
languages _ and people somehow put them into English,'' Heidel said.
   A customer once asked for ``Christmas Intruder'' when he wanted
``Christmas Intrada.'' Another requested ``Furry Lice'' instead of
``Fuer Elise.''
   ``Wash it Off'' was really ``Wachet Auf'' by Johann Sebastian
Bach, and the ``zucchini method'' of piano playing is the Suzuki
method.
   Once the goal is clear, salesclerks may have to search through
an inventory that would stretch a mile high if stacked. It includes
everything from classical to gospel to heavy metal.
   The business named after its founder was started in 1872 in New
York. It opened its Chicago store in the 1920s when Wabash Avenue
was the city's music row and was filled with piano stores, music
publishers and other establishments that catered to musicians and
music lovers.
   The Chicago store is the company's largest, Boston and New York
have the others and headquarters is in New York.
   Printed music is Fischer's specialty. The department that sells
guitars, metronomes and refrigerator magnets in the shape of
clarinets is just a sideline.
   Fischer employees _ including Heidel the symphonic trombone
player and Potter the tenor _ are one of the company's strengths.
   ``There's no way you could train people to do this. It couldn't
replace the knowledge and devotion that these people have,'' said
Gary Sigurdson, vice president and general manager and a former
symphony musician.
   A sense of humor helps, too.
   ``Some people can't carry a tune,'' said Potter, a tenor with
the Chicago Symphony Chorus who works part time at Fischer.
   ``If I worked part time as a waiter and heard people sing like
that, I might have thrown a pie in their face,'' said Potter, who
claims to have a 70 percent success rate at figuring out what a
customer wants from the barest and bizarrest of clues.
   Potter said one of the most often requested songs in the past
year has been ``Wind Beneath My Wings'' by Bette Midler.
   Or, as one customer called it, ``The Wind Beneath My Legs.''

<HEAD>Agriculture Secretary Says Japan Trying To Have It Both Ways On
Trade</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Japan can't have it both ways, defending a
closed-door import policy while advocating liberalized global
trade, says Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter.
   ``Japan cannot insist upon one set of rules for goods and
services where it is internationally competitive, and another set
of rules where it is uncompetitive,'' Yeutter said in a letter to
Tomio Yamamoto, Japanese minister of agriculture, forestry and
fisheries.
   Yeutter predicted April 9 that Japan would dismantle its rice
import ban by the end of this year, when the Uruguay Round of trade
talks is scheduled to conclude.
   The talks are being held under the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade, with an objective of reducing or eliminating world trade
barriers.
   Yeutter's May 18 letter to Yamamoto, which was released on
Monday, was directed at the minister's recent remarks in Tokyo
accusing Yeutter of meddling in Japan's internal affairs.
   Yamamoto was reported to have angrily reacted to Yeutter's
flat-out prediction that Japan would open its door to rice imports.
   ``After working so hard over the past three years to manage this
issue in a non-confrontational way, I am personally offended and
deeply distressed to read that I am, nonetheless, accused of
interfering in Japan's internal policy,'' Yeutter wrote.
   Yeutter recalled that as U.S. trade representative in the Reagan
administration he twice rejected petitions from the U.S. rice
industry for ``Section 301'' retaliation against Japan's
restrictive import policies.
   ``Your comments seemingly indicate that Japan is not prepared to
liberalize its rice market in the Uruguay Round,'' he told
Yamamoto. ``If that is the position of your government, then I
erred in rejecting those Section 301 petitions.''
   Further, he said, Japanese government officials ``repeatedly
assured me that Japan was prepared to negotiate on its agricultural
import restrictions, including rice, if the United States and other
nations were also prepared to negotiate on their agricultural
import restrictions and other distortive trade practices.''
   Yeutter said Japan ``agreed conceptually'' to do that when
Yamamoto's government concurred in the launching of the Uruguay
Round.
   At a 1989 midterm review in Montreal, Japan agreed to negotiate
``substantial progressive reductions in agricultural support and
protection,'' he said.
   ``Recent comments by Japanese officials that Japan will never
liberalize its rice market are contrary to all the commitments that
have been made by your country during the Uruguay Round process,''
Yeutter said.
   Yeutter expressed hope that he and Yamamoto could get together
soon to talk more about the rice issue.

   An Agriculture Department report says a
dramatic increase in wheat production this year will help rebuild
U.S. stockpiles and probably will mean stiffer regional competition
for some export markets.
   Total wheat output has been projected at more than 2.69 billion
bushels, a rise of more than 650 million bushels from the
weather-reduced 1989 harvest.
   It would be the biggest year-to-year increase on record, besides
resulting in the nation's third-largest wheat harvest, the report
said Monday. Winter wheat alone is forecast at 2.09 billion
bushels, up 44 percent from 1989.
   As a result of the larger crop, lean stockpiles are expected to
increase by June 1, 1991, to about 765 million bushels from an
estimated 442 million bushels this June 1.
   Wheat prices received by farmers in 1990-91 are forecast at
$2.90 to $3.30 per bushel, down from an average of $3.71 in 1989-90
and $3.72 in the 1988-89 marketing year.
   ``The 1990-91 price relationships and competition across classes
(kinds) of wheat may change dramatically from 1989-90,'' the report
said. ``Supplies of hard red winter wheat will be up sharply,
resulting in more competition with hard red spring for the hard
wheat market.''
   Hard red winter wheat is concentrated in Kansas and other parts
of the central and southern Great Plains, while hard red spring
wheat is mostly in northern areas. White wheat is grown mainly in
the Pacific Northwest, and soft red winter is raised in the eastern
third of the country.
   ``Larger crops and reduced imports are expected in South Asia,''
the report said. ``This will mean that the larger U.S. white wheat
crop will have to compete with soft red winter for export markets
such as Egypt that take both classes of wheat.''

   Pumpkin muffins, old-fashioned rice pudding,
pork in peanut butter sauce, and stove-top tamale pie are some of
the items in a new American Indian recipe book released by the
Agriculture Department.
   About 70 traditional and non-traditional recipes are included in
the 100-page, spiral-bound cookbook.
   Betty Jo Nelsen, administrator of the department's Food and
Nutrition Service, said Monday the book was developed to help
Indian families on reservations who get federal commodity donations.
   Indians and those working with them ``sent us some great recipes
using USDA commodity foods,'' she said.
   ``From the recipes we received, we picked the ones for this book
that taste good, use commodities for at least half the ingredients,
use few pots and pans, and are quick and easy to make,'' Nelsen
said.
   Although it is not a diet book, many of the recipes use less
sugar, salt and fat than the original recipes called for, she said.
   State agencies and tribal organizations are responsible for
distributing to Indian households participating in the commodity
program.

<HEAD>Tobacco Exports Threaten Health in Developing Nations: Koop</HEAD>

   U.S. tobacco sold overseas is often targeted at
women and the young, carries no warning labels and threatens the
health of people in developing countries, former Surgeon General C.
Everett Koop says.
   ``Export of tobacco products is a moral outrage,'' Koop said at
the World Conference on Lung Health meeting on Monday.
   While smoking in the United States dropped 5 percent last year,
American tobacco exports rose 20 percent, Koop said. About 100
billion cigarettes were exported last year, he said.
   From 1971 to 1981, cigarette smoking increased in Asia and Latin
America by 30 percent more than the population increase, Koop said.
   ``There is no sense in planning for the long-term economic
health of a foreign society and providing that society with foreign
aid on the one hand, if the physical health of the people of that
society is fundamentally endangered during that same long term,''
Koop said.
   Koop's comments were bolstered by those of the health officials
from developing countries.
   Dr. Judith MacKay, director of the Asian Consultancy on Tobacco
Control in Hong Kong, said, ``For every smoker that stops in
Boston, two more start in Beijing.''
   The Bush administration is negotiating with Thailand to seek
openings for the tobacco trade. Like other Asian countries,
Thailand has a state monopoly on tobacco products.
   A recent General Accounting Office report said the negotiations
were at odds with the administration's stated policy of promoting
good health.
   Andy Copenhaver of the U.S. Cigarette Export Association in
Washington said allowing American tobacco companies to market their
products in Asia would not increase the number of smokers.
   Asian countries such as Japan, Korea and Taiwan have opened up
to foreign tobacco companies only in recent years. Since then,
smoking rates there have either declined or increased at the same
rate as before, Copenhaver said.
   MacKay said estimates of how much smoking costs developing
nations in health care, insurance and lost wages were not available.
   Dr. Carlos Alvarez Herrera, president of the Latin America
Coordinating Committee on Smoking Control in Argentina, said
tobacco companies are entrenched in Latin America.
   Tobacco advertising ``is everywhere, at all times, theaters,
opera houses, many sporting events, popular concerts,'' Herrera
said. ``We cannot compete with their public opinion.''

<HEAD>Motorsports Fans: Potential Drunken Drivers or Respectable
Citizens?</HEAD>

   A new study says that beer company sponsorship
of motorsports races encourages drunken driving by fans, including
young men with ``long shag haircuts'' and women with tight pants
and braces.
   Beer industry supporters called the study elitist nonsense.
   Breweries spend $50 million a year to link beer and fast cars
``in a carefully crafted effort to promote beer, especially among
working class youth and young adults who are part of the `car
culture,''' said the American Automobile Association report
released by a coalition of safety and health groups Monday.
   In dueling news conferences at the National Press Club, the
coalition and the Beer Institute painted sharply differing images
of the motorsports crowd.
   The fans at one beer-sponsored event at San Francisco's Cow
Palace included ``teen-agers and young men with long shag haircuts,
spotty complexions, work boots and denim pants; young women with
tight pants, braces and hair-sprayed bouffant hairdos,'' said the
study.
   ``Racing fans are overwhelmingly adult,'' said Less Richter of
the National Association of Stock Car Auto Racing, who spoke at the
beer industry event. ``They are employed, they are respectable
citizens and they are too intelligent to believe any of the
nonsense promoted in this booklet.''
   The 92-page AAA report concluded that brewers target blue-collar
youth by sponsoring motorsports racers and events across the
country. Youth in that class are the most likely to drive drunk,
said the report, which was based on previous studies, observation
of 14 events and interviews with 60 high school students.
   The report offered no new scientific evidence of a link between
drunken driving and beer ads or sponsorship of racing events. But
researcher David Buchanan, coauthor, said it documents the way beer
companies dangerously link beer and fast cars in the minds of
racing fans.
   The Beer Institute said the research was faulty. One participant
at the news conference, United Auto Workers union legislative
director Dick Warden, characterized the coalition's view as
``elitist and condescending'' against blue-collar workers.
   Institute president James Sanders said 98 percent of racing
enthusiasts are over 21 years old and the typical fan ``is an
attractive customer for nearly any type of consumer product.''
   At the coalition news conference, chairman Alexander Wagenaar
was flanked by an ad showing a race car through a glass of Miller
beer and a Coors T-shirt emblazoned with a picture of a big-wheeled
``monster truck.''
   Wagenaar released copies of scolding letters to beer company
executives and announced an effort to help drivers gain non-beer
sponsors.
   The groups announced symbolic sponsorship of two relatively new
race drivers: Michael Schriefer of Manhattan Beach, Calif., and
Randi Lynn Hubbard of Aberdeen, Washington. In lieu of the several
hundred thousand dollars sponsors often provide, both received
stickers reading ``Drive Alcohol-Free'' to post on their vehicles.
   Ms. Hubbard said she has built her own ``monster truck'' but has
been excluded from some competition sponsored by alcohol and
tobacco companies because she uses her truck to campaign against
the use of restricted substances by youth.
   ``I'm not going to change my mind,'' said the mother of three
teen-age daughters. ``I'm going to continue to tell kids that
drinking and driving is unsafe.''
   Wagenaar said the coalition, formed in January to promote a
nationwide campaign against drunken driving, includes 100 safety
and health groups.

<HEAD>De Klerk Trip Stirs Hopes Of End To South Africa's Isolation</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President F.W. de Klerk's tour
of Europe has thrilled whites here, who hope decades of
international isolation may be ending. But it has dismayed blacks,
who fear it may harm the anti-apartheid cause.
   ``It is wonderful to go to Europe with the knowledge that South
Africa is busy taking its rightful place in the international
community,'' de Klerk said before departing May 11 on his
nine-nation trip, which runs through May 26.
   De Klerk's foreign tour is the most successful by a South
African leader since World War II, and it has dominated the local
media. TV and radio have followed every development, and newspaper
front pages are filled with long accounts of the president's
activities.
   ``The Iron Friendship,'' boomed a banner headline in The Sunday
Times after de Klerk held talks with British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher. ``Red Carpet For F.W. In Paris,'' proclaimed The
Citizen after de Klerk met French President Francois Mitterrand.
   For white South Africans, frustrated by decades of enforced
international isolation, de Klerk's warm reception in Europe seems
like a dream come true. Descended from Europeans, white South
Africans value their ties with Western nations and fret over their
country's poor reputation because of apartheid.
   De Klerk has raised hopes around the world that apartheid is
about to end, and his cordial treatment in Europe has stirred hope
among whites here that West European and other nations may ease or
lift economic sanctions, and help boost the stagnant South African
economy.
   ``My general impression is that Europe is ready to take specific
steps, is really ready to do this re-evaluation,'' de Klerk said in
London.
   Since assuming power last August, de Klerk has made major
reforms. He released black leader Nelson Mandela and legalized
black opposition groups. He has committed the government to ending
white-minority rule and sharing power with the 28-million black
majority.
   Those reforms and the South African leader's pragmatic style
appear to have impressed European leaders. France, Britain and
other nations have expressed cautious optimism that South Africa
stands on the verge of historic change.
   British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said the European
Community was considering reductions in sanctions to help the
reform process in South Africa.
   ``We need to consider how we pinpoint the signals ... so we can
give encouragement,'' Hurd said.
   The 12 European Community countries have banned imports of iron,
steel and gold coins from South Africa for more than three years,
and also banned new investments in South Africa.
   But the prospect of a reduction in sanctions has alarmed the
African National Congress, already concerned about the way de Klerk
has been received.
   The ANC, the main black nationalist group, insists sanctions
must be maintained to ensure the white minority government meets
its commitment to end apartheid.
   ``The warmth of his (de Klerk's) reception here is not a good
sign for us,'' said Sisa Ngombane, an ANC representative in Europe.
   The talk of easing sanctions ``is not a welcome development.
This is a move by de Klerk to bust sanctions. I think the wrong
signals are being given to him at this stage,'' he said.
   Mandela will attempt to offset some of de Klerk's triumph when
he tours Europe next month. He is likely to urge leaders not to
make any concessions on sanctions.
   South African newspapers have said Mandela also will be trying
to diminish de Klerk's newfound prestige. De Klerk and Mandela are
likely to be competing for attention on back-to-back visits to the
United States in June.
   De Klerk's current journey offers a sharp contrast to the last
major overseas tour by a South African president. Former President
P.W. Botha was shunned by some heads of state when he toured seven
West European nations in 1984.
   Yet de Klerk is under pressure to produce something more
substantial from his trip than good feelings. South African
officials say they need concrete economic and political concessions
to help deflate right-wing white opposition to ending apartheid.
   De Klerk ``deserves something more tangible than kind words as a
reward,'' said Foreign Minister Pik Botha.

   Disheartened by U.S. reluctance to allow the
export of supercomputers to Israel, scientists in that country are
researching a new system more powerful than anything the United
States has, Israeli university officials say.
   Three Israeli institutions have applied for licenses to buy Cray
and IBM supercomputers, but the permits have been delayed out of
U.S. concern that Israel might use the fast-computing systems to
develop nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles.
   U.S. government agencies have been considering the applications
for almost two years but thus far have refused to grant the permits.
   ``The writing's on the wall,'' said Maia Hauser, the U.S.
spokeswoman for Technion, Israel's leading high-tech university.
``We'll have to go it on our own.'' The university is asking
supporters in the United States to raise funds for an alternative
to the U.S. computers.
   Technion applied in 1988 for a Cray-2 computer for scientific
and engineering research. The Weizman Institute of Science and
Bar-Ilan University also have pending license requests.
   The Commerce Department, which has final say on the licensing,
is banned by law from discussing supercomputer applications.
   Israel has set up a government committee to investigate the
feasibility of researching so-called ``parallel processing,'' said
Technion Vice President Brian Silver.
   In most computers, no matter how powerful, computation proceeds
as one calculation at a time, known as ``serial processing.''
   In some problems, multiple results might be calculable
independently of each other, and a ``parallel processing'' machine
is designed to save time by doing those independent calculations
simultaneously.
   U.S. and West German scientists have developed some parallel
processing computers, and some very specialized machines are
available.
   Israel would have gone into such research anyway because that is
the wave of the future in supercomputers, but the U.S. hold on the
supercomputers has given the project a strong push, Silver said.
   ``There's not much difficulty in us producing them within
several years if we decide to,'' said Silver.
   Technion scientists already have begun theoretical research into
parallel computing and laboratories are being set up to conduct
experiments, he said.
   Technion also has discussed buying a sophisticated West German
computer, which uses applications of parallel computations, to
serve as a basis for a future Israeli supercomputer, he said.
   Supporters of the sale of supercomputers to Israel note that
Saudi Arabia, which is technically in a state of war with Israel,
has been allowed to buy two Crays from the Minnesota-based CRAY
Research Corp.
   But U.S. officials say those computers went to Saudi Arabia's
oil company for use in seismic research, noting that the Saudis do
not have an indigenous nuclear weapons program which could benefit
from the machines.
   India, which is known to be developing nuclear weapons, has
bought one supercomputer for weather predictions, and has a pending
request for another.
   Israeli officials say that preventing Israel from buying
supercomputers will not stop the development of nuclear weapons.
Israel is known to have developed such arms on its own without
supercomputers.
   Silver said Technion had agreed to submit to inspections on the
Cray system to make sure it was not used for military purposes, but
opponents of the sale say computer use is difficult to monitor.

<HEAD>Bush Has Decided to Extend Favored Trade Status to China,
Officials Say</HEAD>

   President Bush plans to renew China's
most-favored nation trading status for another year, even though
the decision is sure to provoke another round of criticism in
Congress, administration officials said Monday night.
   The president is expected to tie the annual renewal to a
provision giving him the option of withdrawing the privileged
status quickly if he so choses, based on China's human-rights
performance, said officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
   Bush's chief spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said Monday night no
decision on the issue had been made. Bush must act by June 3.
   But sources said Bush would rather confront the issue _ sure to
touch off another round of criticism in Congress _ now rather than
wait until the deadline, which is only one day before the first
aniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre.
   The president would also like to clear the boards of the
decision before the May 31-June 3 summit with Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the officials said, speaking on the condition
of anonymity.
   Although Bush has recently voiced disappointment with China's
performance in the aftermath of the crackdown, he decided that
depriving China of most-favored-nation status would be too drastic
a step, the officials said.
   Bush himself at a news conference last week expressed
reservations about stripping China of the trade benefits for fear
that it would harm the economy of Hong Kong.
   Some $8.5 billion worth of China-made goods are re-exported to
the United States each year. Hong Kong officials have claimed that
revocation of China's most-favored-nation status would make these
goods subject to tariffs of up to 70 percent.
   Most-favored-nation status entitles nations to the lowest rate
of tariffs and other trade benefits that are available to the
United States' major trading partners.
   However, some nations, including the Soviet Union, have been
denied most-favored-nation treatment because of their human-rights
policies.
   Congress can act to block Bush's decision, but it seems unlikley
that it could muster the two-third majorities needed to overturn
his action.
   Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., who returned to Washington with Bush
Monday evening on Air Force One, said a decision to renew
most-favored-nation status would likely be upheld by Congress,
despite some grumbling.
   ``It's not as emotional an issue as the student visas one,''
Wilson said.
   He was referring to Bush's veto last winter of a bill to extent
the visas of Chinese students in the United States. After a heavy
lobbying campaign, the president won that battle in a close vote
that sustained his veto.
   China's vice minister of trade has said his country could lose
almost a fourth of its $43 billion worth of annual exports if the
United States does not renew China's most-favored-nation trade
status.
   The vice-minister, Shen Jueren, estimated the loss at $10
billion worth of exports, which would be the great bulk of China's
$12 billion in shipments to the United States, from the effect of
price increases caused by an increase in the average tariff from 9
percent to 50 percent.
   China's leading exports to the Untied States are clothing, shoes
and toys. The United States ships China about $5.7 billion worth of
goods each year, led by wheat, aircraft and fertilizer.
   China would revoke its most-favored-nation designation of the
United States in retaliation, Shen said.

   Senate Republicans are waging rhetorical
warfare against a Democratic proposal they say would effectively
rule out capital punishment in the United States.
   Sen. Orrin G. Hatch, R-Utah, assailed a Democratic provision in
the crime bill that would permit those sentenced to death to use
statistical evidence to argue they were the victims of race
discrimination.
   Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., said the provision, sponsored by
Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., ``is based upon the premise that
the death penalty is currently imposed in a racially biased
manner.''
   In advance of Monday's opening of Senate floor debate on a
wide-ranging crime bill, conservatives argued that Kennedy's
proposal amounted to an indirect attempt to outlaw capital
punishment.
   The overall package would authorize the death penalty for 30
federal crimes, including presidential assassination. But
prosecutors seeking to carry out a sentence would have to show it
wasn't being done in a racially discriminatory fashion.
   The Office of Management and Budget said Monday that, if
enacted, the provision would have the effect of setting up ``an
irrefutable presumption of `discrimination' based on a failure to
achieve specific numerical proportions in the imposition of the
death penalty.''
   Thurmond said ``a majority of our nation's blacks support the
death penalty.'' And he cited Justice Department statistics saying
that 19 of every 1,000 whites convicted of murder are sentenced to
death, compared with 12 of every 1,000 blacks convicted.
   Meanwhile, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Sen.
Joseph Biden, D-Del., accused the Bush administration of playing
politics with the crime bill.
   Biden said he was disturbed about recent accusations by
President Bush and Vice President Dan Quayle that the Senate has
not moved aggressively in the law enforcement arena.
   ``We have heard, in my view too often, a lot of rhetoric
suggesting that the president's crime bill has been languishing in
the Senate since last May and I think it's time to set the record
straight,'' Biden said. He noted that some elements of the Bush
package already have been passed, including the 1988 bill allowing
the death penalty for murders committed by drug kingpins.
   Bush, in a speech to a law enforcement audience in Portland,
Ore., Sunday, accused Congress of spawning ``weak imitations'' of
his proposals to attack crime after allowing them to languish for a
year.
   ``We must reject those who soft-pedal the need to be hard on
crime,'' Bush said. He accused lawmakers of sitting on key
anti-crime proposals, although the president did acknowledge that
Congress agreed to his request for more federal law enforcement
officers, prosecutors and prisons.
   Biden maintained that Congress not only passed key elements of
the original Bush package, but that lawmakers ``strengthened it,
made it stronger.''
   On the remaining issues such as capital punishment and the
length of time prisoners have for filing federal appeals, he said,
the administration seems to have no interest in negotiating with
Democrats.
   ``Congress got to work on this proposal right away,'' Biden
said. ``Just four months later, the full Senate had passed every
single request in the second part of the president's crime package
_ that is, the funding for law enforcement, the teeth _ the portion
that will and has begun to make a difference in terms of making the
streets safer for Americans.''
   ``So I think we should kind of hopefully put aside this sort of
partisan banter,'' the senator said, ``and hopefully not hear about
how the president's crime bill has been left to languish on Capitol
Hill.''
   ``The time to play politics on this kind of issue is over,''
Biden said.

   Medical experts say stronger efforts are
needed to make sure women do not use the acne drug Accutane during
pregnancy because it can cause birth defects.
   The drug that offers hope to people suffering from a severe,
disfiguring form of acne also can cause serious birth defects in
one out of four cases where the mother used Accutane during
pregnancy, officials say.
   Experts on two committees advising the Food and Drug
Administration agreed Monday that the manufacturer,
Hoffman-LaRoche, has alerted physicians and patients to the birth
defect risk. But the committees recommended that more be done to
get the word out.
   Hoffman-LaRoche officials said they were pleased with the
recommendations, two of which were similar to additional warnings
the company had announced earlier in the day.
   The FDA advisory committees rejected the advice of some within
the agency who want Accutane withheld from all women to eliminate
any risk of birth defects from the drug.
   The committee actions came as other physicians were reporting
that Accutane can significantly block the growth of new tumors in
people being treated for smoking-related cancer of the mouth and
throat.
   Accutane has been on the market since 1982 to treat what is
called severe recalcitrant cystic acne.
   In September 1988, Roche Dermatologics, a division of
Hoffman-LaRoche, began a program aimed at educating physicians
about the importance of having patients avoid pregnancy during
Accutane treatment.
   Roche officials say 86 cases of birth defects have been reported
to the company as being associated with Accutane since the drug was
first marketed.
   But David Graham, an FDA medical epidemiologist, said that
number represents only about 10 percent of the number that actually
occur. He estimated that since 1982, nearly 1,000 babies have been
born with birth defects associated with Accutane.
   Graham also estimated that 90 percent of the women using
Accutane do not have the severe form of acne for which the drug is
intended. They could be treated with other drugs without the kind
of risk Accutane poses, he said.
   Accutane was prescribed last year for about 65,000 women of
childbearing age. Graham said less than 4,000 women are estimated
to have the severe form of acne that requires Accutane treatment.
   The overprescribing exposes tens of thousands of women to the
possibility of a malformed child if they become pregnant while
being treated, he said.
   Graham said one study found that women using Accutane underwent
twice as many abortions as women not using the drug.
   Roche's pregnancy prevention program ``has failed to achieve its
objective,'' he said. ``The only way to eliminate exposure is to
eliminate use of this (drug) by women.''
   However, Robert Armstrong, director of medical affairs for Roche
Dermatologics, said Graham's estimates were based on shaky
assumptions.
   He also said that no one is sure how many women have the severe
acne. But he said he was sure the number of congenital
malformations that result from Accutane are not as large as Graham
believes.
   ``If there were that many out there, they would be noticed and
reported,'' Armstrong said.
   The advisory committees recommended that the company emphasize
the importance of a pregnancy test before a patient starts using
Accutane. It also recommended a way for patients to return any
unused Accutane at the end of treatment.
   The company said it was undertaking similar measures.
   The panels also said forms to record patient consent, now
available in English and Spanish, should be available in more
languages, and physicians should be encouraged to refer Accutane
patients for contraception counseling.

   Auto industry lobbyists are working to head
off attempts to toughen smog controls in the House clean air bill,
including a requirement to build 1 million non-gasoline powered
cars a year.
   The proposal, being pushed by Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., is
expected to provide the most fireworks when the air pollution
control bill comes up for floor votes on Thursday.
   The sweeping legislation is the first strengthening of federal
clean air laws in 13 years and imposes new curbs on acid rain
pollution, industrial toxic releases and smog-causing emissions
from industry and automobiles. It is expected to cost more than $21
billion a year when fully implemented.
   The Senate approved a similar measure in April.
   The House began debate on the clean air bill Monday, while
closed-door talks continued in an effort to work out compromises on
some of more than a half-dozen proposed amendments.
   Agreements were reached on several amendments, including a
measure aimed at curbing pollution over national parks and
requiring a cleaner gasoline blend in smog-troubled urban areas,
according to participants in the talks.
   But sources involved in the closed-door discussions said late
Monday it was all but certain that Waxman's alternative fuel car
amendment would be left for a showdown on the House floor.
   Waxman's amendment calls on automakers to produce non-gasoline
powered automobiles for sale in the nine U.S. cities with the
highest air pollution. The cities are Los Angeles, San Diego,
Houston, Chicago, Milwaukee, Baltimore, New York, Philadelphia and
Hartford, Conn.
   Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., chairman of the Energy and Commerce
Committee, who has been protective of auto interests, is strongly
opposed to the production mandate.
   He said Monday he considered ``all the really important
environmental issues'' to be already resolved and suggested those
remaining in dispute represented little more than a difference of
viewpoint among congressmen.
   Waxman said his measure differed little from a proposal offered
by President Bush a year ago, which the White House later backed
away from following strong auto industry opposition.
   The amendment calls for automakers to produce 500,000
alternative fuel cars for sale in the nine cities by 1994 and
double that number by 1996. The cars would cut auto emissions in
those cities by 75 percent by the end of the decade, according to
Waxman.
   Auto industry lobbyists have argued for weeks that the mandate
would push alterative fuel cars onto the road too quickly, saying
they may be forced to make cars they can't sell.
   ``Until we know how to produce these vehicles in volume you run
the risk of killing the program by forcing it onto (the public) too
quickly,'' said William Ball, a lobbyist for General Motors Corp.,
in an interview Monday.
   Daniel Weiss, a lobbyist for the Sierra Club, scoffed at
suggestions by the automakers that they might not be able to sell
the vehicles. If required to do so, the automakers will find ways
to market the vehicles, perhaps ``promote them as `Big Green
Machines,''' he said.
   Democrats and Republicans in the House agree that the major
components of the clean air bill that passed the Energy and
Commerce Committee 42-1 in April are likely to stay intact on the
House floor.

<HEAD>Many Elderly Skip Meals, Survey Shows</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Most elderly Americans know they need a
sensible diet to stay healthy, but one in five say they skip at
least one meal a day, according to a survey released today.
   The survey also found that 45 percent of senior citizens take
multiple prescription drugs, which can affect appetite or
absorption of nutrients.
   Also, one out of four surveyed had a household income under
$10,000 a year.
   Yet, while about 85 percent said a healthy diet plays an
important role in preventing and recovering from illness, only 18
percent said they worried a lot about a proper diet and more than a
third said they don't worry at all.
   The survey was released by the Nutrition Screening Initiative, a
five-year project launched by a coalition of medical, health care
and aging groups.
   ``Nutrition is one of the important vital signs, just as blood
pressure or pulse,'' said Dr. Gerald Keller, an official of the
American Academy of Family Physicians, a leader of the coalition.
   ``The fact is, however, America has not effectively incorporated
routine nutrition screening and care into the nation's system of
health care delivery,'' he said.
   The initiative will focus first on the elderly, who face a
disproportionate nutritional risk for a variety of reasons.
   Many live alone and tend not to cook, while others have reduced
appetite and sense of taste, sometimes because of the medications
they take, said Paul Kerschner, senior vice president of the
National Council on the Aging.
   The initiative will include efforts to educate health care
professionals, administrators and policy makers about the need for
proper nutrition, plus media campaigns aimed at the elderly and
those who care for them.
   The survey was conducted by Peter Hart Research Associates Inc.
A sample of 802 people over age 65 was polled by telephone Feb.
7-16.

<HEAD>Barry Wants Separate Trial On New Charges</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor Marion Barry says he is ready to go to
trial next month on drug charges, but is asking a judge to keep six
new charges against him a separate matter.
   Barry ``is handicapped by the lateness of the new charges'' and
by the government's refusal to disclose details of the charges, his
lawyers said in court papers Monday.
   The mayor was indicted May 11 on a charge of conspiracy and five
counts of cocaine possession. The six new charges were added to
eight previous ones brought Feb. 15.
   The June 4 trial would include all 14 charges.
   Barry said he wanted to go to trial June 4 as scheduled on the
eight earlier charges _ five misdemeanor counts of cocaine
possession and three felony perjury charges _ while handling the
six new charges as a separate matter.
   The government has refused to disclose names of alleged
co-conspirators or to give the place, time and witnesses involved
in the new charges, Barry's lawyers said.
   ``Given the government's reluctance to deliver the information
and the shortness of the time until trial, it may be highly
disadvantageous'' for Barry to proceed to trial on the new charges,
the court papers said.
   Barry was charged in the February indictment with five counts of
cocaine possession and three felony charges of lying to a federal
grand jury in connection with his alleged involvement with drugs.

<HEAD>Government Strips Communists of Property, Building Use</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government has announced it
will strip the Communist Party of all the property it was granted
use of during the past four decades.
   The decision Monday followed a move three days earlier to freeze
ownership of all buildings and other fixed assets owned by the
Communists, who were ousted from power in a peaceful revolution
last year.
   The moves were likely to be highly popular in Czechoslovakia,
where up to 100,000 people have attended recent street rallies
calling for the Communists to give up their property and urging a
ban on the party in upcoming free elections.
   Kvestoslava Korinkova, head of the government's Inspection
Commission, said all contracts for property used by the Communists
will be declared null and void on June 1, a week before the
country's first free elections in more than 40 years.
   ``Such contracts were very often made under strange
circumstances,'' Ms. Korinkova said.
   She said the property would be turned over to educational,
cultural, health and other institutions, or to other political
parties.
   She did not say how many buildings would be affected, but she
estimated the total value at $306 million.
   Last Friday, parliament froze $281 million in fixed assets of
the Communist Party pending investigation of each acquisition.
   Korinkova said the acquisitions would be considered legal only
if made before Nov. 17, 1989, the start of the popular revolt
against Communist rule, and only if paid for from party dues.

<HEAD>Government Agrees to Pay Noriega Attorneys</HEAD>

   U.S. taxpayers will foot Manuel Noriega's legal
bills until $20 million of his frozen assets are confiscated or
released, under a deal that averts disclosure of secret U.S.
payments to the fallen dictator.
   Before the deal was reached Monday, Noriega's lawyers had
threatened to quit the drug trafficking case because they hadn't
been paid. Prosecutors froze the former Panamanian leader's assets,
contending they were illegally obtained.
   In agreeing to cover Noriega's legal fees, the government headed
off a confrontation over $11 million in U.S. intelligence agency
payments he claims to have received over several decades.
   Noriega's lawyers had been trying to force the government to
produce secret records of those payments to show Noriega had
legitimate sources of income other than drugs. But on Monday, the
defense agreed to drop the subpoenas when the deal involving
Noriega's legal fees is formally approved.
   The U.S. government ``wanted to avoid litigation that would get
into matters having to do, certainly, with classified information,
with payments by our government and other governments to Noriega,''
defense attorney Jon May said.
   U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen told U.S. District Judge William
Hoeveler that the government agreed to cover the legal bills ``to
assure Mr. Noriega receives a fair trial.''
   The long and complex nature of the case made it possible for the
prosecution to invoke a federal law allowing the unusual
arrangement, he said.
   Noriega, who was in court in his general's uniform, agreed to
sign affidavits declaring he was indigent and promising to repay
the government if his assets are released.
   ``It can't be said that the American taxpayer is paying for
this, because all the funding for the general's legal fees will
come out of the seized assets,'' said chief defense attorney Frank
Rubino.
   Defense attorney Steven Kollin has estimated Noriega would need
$5 million to properly defend himself. The defense contends
prosecutors have spent $12 million so far and are prepared to spend
$25 million more to convict Noriega.
   Hoeveler gave his blessing to the agreement, but it is subject
to approval by Chief U.S. District Judge James King. A hearing was
set for Thursday.
   The U.S. government has frozen 27 Noriega accounts around the
world valued at $20 million.
   Defense attorneys had subpoenaed records from the CIA, Drug
Enforcement Administration and other agencies for evidence of
payments to Noriega during the period he is said to have been a
U.S. intelligence agent.
   Prosecutors acknowledge the United States paid Noriega. But
``the amount is substantially less than that offered by the defense
counsel,'' said Diane Cossin, spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's
office. She would not elaborate.
   Prosecutors submitted a list of payments to the judge Monday but
insisted it be kept secret.
   Noriega was indicted in 1988 on charges of taking $4.6 million
in bribes from the Medellin cartel to protect cocaine smuggling
into the United States.
   He turned himself in to U.S. authorities Jan. 4, two weeks after
the invasion of Panama. He is being held at the federal
Metropolitan Correctional Center outside Miami.

   The T-shirts are out, the vodka billboards
are coming down and the bids to take Mikhail Gorbachev fishing or
bear-watching don't seem to stop.
   ``Everybody's got an angle. No doubt about that,'' says Vern
Freeh, vice president of international affairs for Minnesota-based
Land 'O Lakes Inc., a food processing and farm supply cooperative.
``We all want to meet him.''
   Since it was announced last week that Gorbachev will spend six
hours in Minnesota on June 3, Gov. Rudy Perpich's office has been
swamped with requests to meet the Soviet leader. Hundreds of people
have offered gifts or tributes, and entrepreneurs quickly kicked in
with T-shirts and a ``Tell it to Gorbachev'' hotline.
   Gorbachev wants to spend two hours talking with agricultural and
business leaders to build on longstanding economic ties between the
Soviet Union and Minnesota.
   Perpich said Monday that a final intinerary has not been
determined but that Gorbachev's visit will probably include an
address at a rally at the Capitol in St. Paul.
   The rest of his six-hour visit remained up for grabs. At least
that's what the callers hoped.
   ``We've been receiving hundreds of phone calls every day,'' said
Eileen Biernat, a Perpich aide.
   An Ely man who can call black bears out of the woods to meet
with tourists offered to summon bears so Gorbachev can have his
picture taken with them. And the Breezy Point City Council thinks
Gorbachev would enjoy an hour or two of walleye fishing.
   Other suggestions:
   _In Minneapolis, Urban League President Gleason Glover wants
Gorbachev to meet with Minnesota's minority leaders. Foreign
dignitaries, Glover said, rarely make contact with U.S. minority
groups.
   _Duluth officials plan to ship 173 old voting machines to
Petrozavodsk, Duluth's Soviet sister city, to replace its paper
ballots. Duluth replaced the machines last year with a computerized
system.
   _For $10, Minnesotans can dial a 900 telephone number for
updates on the Gorbachev visit and to tape messages for the Soviet
leader.
   Among those hoping to profit on the hoopla in Minnesota are
T-shirt makers. Morton Rykiss of Diversified Arts said his company
has five designs, including one reading ``Hugs to the kids in
Russia from the kids in Minnesota, with love.''
   The distributor of Minnesota-made Karkov vodka announced Monday
that it would remove billboards in the Twin Cities that show a
likeness of Gorbachev holding a bottle of Karkov under the caption
``The Party's Over,'' a reference to the Communist Party's troubles.
   Some Minnesotans felt the billboards, which went up before
Gorbachev's visit was announced, would insult the Soviet leader.
   ``We never imagined this much controversy and we certainly
didn't imagine this much press,'' said Gerry Schmitt, a partner and
creative director of Minneapolis ad agency Schmitt &amp; Sloan. ``We
set out to create a brand awareness for Karkov, and one way or
another, it has.''
   Out West, Gorbachev can expect a mixed reception when he arrives
for a visit to Stanford University and the San Francisco Bay area
June 3-4.
   The Soviet Jews Bay Area Council will hold protests at Stanford
and in the city to complain about ``the unchecked rise of
anti-Semitism'' in the Soviet Union, said spokesman Marshall Platt.
Estonians, Latvians and Lithuanians are preparing protests to
demand the independence of the Baltic states.
   Others are planning a warmer welcome. Opera singers want to
serenade the Soviet leader, a school is eager to put on a play for
him and businessmen hope to get close enough to whisper a few words
about terrific deals.
   ``Some people are calling up asking to buy tickets, but there
are no tickets for anything yet,'' said Mary Bartlett of Stanford's
office of public affairs.

<HEAD>Researchers See No Peace Dividend Yet</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Global military spending barely
declined last year and the public has gleaned no ``disarmament
dividend or peace prize'' from the thawing of the Cold War, arms
researchers reported.
   In its annual yearbook, released Monday, the Stockholm
International Peace Research Institute also reported that 26
developing countries have acquired ballistic missiles capable of
delivering nuclear, chemical or biological warheads.
   The proliferation of these superlethal missiles ``has created a
new fear of arms races among emerging regional powers,'' said the
institute, commonly called SIPRI.
   The 700-page report said, however, that cash-strapped Third
World countries bought fewer weapons and spent less money in 1989 _
about $16 billion _ than at any time since 1976.
   In 1989, ``the prospects for lasting peace have considerably
improved, particularly in Europe. But peace has not yet broken
out,'' said Walter Stuetzle, director of the 24-year-old research
institute.
   SIPRI, which is financed by the Swedish government, tracks
developments in global arms traffic, military conflicts and
disarmament initiatives.
   Stuetzle, a former West German undersecretary of defense, told a
news conference that the U.S.-Soviet strategic arms treaty under
negotiation would not reduce nuclear arsenals enough to have an
impact on military capabilities.
   U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard Shevardnadze announced after talks in Moscow
Saturday that major progress had been made that may allow a treaty
to be initialed at a summit next week and signed before year's end.
   ``There is still room for drastic reductions,'' Stuetzle said.
The treaty ``has no military relevance when you talk about
deterrence or perception.''
   In its report, SIPRI said $950 billion was spent worldwide on
defense last year, a 2 percent drop from the previous years.
   ``After the dizzying heights of the 1980s, global defense
spending began to fall in 1989. The decline was modest, however,''
and was due more to tight budgets and technology advances than to
peaceful intentions, it said.
   The United States and the Soviet Union trimmed military spending
by about 2 percent, but NATO's European members kept their defense
budgets stable. In East Europe, cuts were announced, but won't be
felt until next year.
   ``Neither the political will to pursue reductions beyond this
level nor the reward in the form of a disarmament dividend or peace
prize are forthcoming,'' it said.
   Though arms control prospects looked bright, ``performance did
not match up to promises'' in reducing military spending, it said.
   The report also made these points:
   _ The number of wars and major regional conflicts fell last year
to 32 from 35, the fewest in three years. In addition, about 75
lesser conflicts were waged, defined as involving fewer than 1,000
deaths.
   _ The Soviet Union led the world in arms exports last year,
though the value shrank to $11.6 billion from $12.5 billion the
previous year and from $14.7 billion in 1987. Nearly three-fourths
were sold to Third World countries. U.S. arms exports totalled
$10.7 billion, and about 76 percent went to industrial nations.
   _ India, for the third successive year, was the world's largest
arms importer, spending $3.8 billion. Japan was second, spending
$3.1 billion.
   _ The cost for destroying chemical weapons will be enormous,
even for those countries like Belgium and Denmark still keeping
75-year-old stocks from World War I. The United States must spend
$3 billion, while the Soviet Union still lacks the technology to
safely demolish its arsenal.

   Rep. Bill Schuette said he was visiting his
district town of Mount Pleasant, Mich., on Friday when a woman
walked up to him.
   ``I have my `Keep the Pledge' button on,'' said the Republican,
who is challenging Democratic Sen. Carl Levin in this fall's
election. ``And she comes in, puts her finger on the button and
says, `Way to go, Bill, keep it up.'''
   Schuette is one of many Capitol Hill Republicans sporting ``Keep
the Pledge'' buttons these days. It's a plea to President Bush to
not abandon his ``no new taxes'' campaign promise during budget
negotiations with Congress.
   But the buttons _ and the voters' sentiments they elicit _ also
are an example of a very real external pressure on the White House
officials and congressional leaders who are trying to forge a
fiscal 1991 budget deal.
   This is an election year. And the closer the talks drag to
primaries and to Election Day, the more reluctant lawmakers will be
to agree to tax increases or deep spending cuts. The third session
is set for today.
   ``There's a serious problem with trying to do this in an
election year,'' House Budget Committee Chairman Leon Panetta,
D-Calif., one of the negotiators, said last week. ``Both parties
have already begun to posture on the issues.''
   Democratic feelings are still ruffled by White House Chief of
Staff John Sununu's comments before the bargaining even began that
Bush would never seriously consider raising taxes.
   Sununu's remarks were later disavowed by White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater, who reiterated that everything _ including new
taxes _ was negotiable.
   But Democrats remain angry _ and poised to strike back.
   Last week, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee sent
six pages of ``talking points'' to Democratic House candidates
listing arguments they could make against tax increases enacted
during the Reagan-Bush years. Included was a full page entitled,
``The Sununu Tax Crunch,'' listing 10 tax boosts Sununu presided
over while governor of New Hampshire.
   ``Sununu, who has spent the past week reiterating Bush's `no new
taxes' lie, raised taxes 10 times while he was governor of New
Hampshire,'' the paper said.
   Further adding to the political decibel level were three
Democratic congressmen. They called a news conference last Thursday
to criticize Bush for not making a nationally televised speech
detailing the deficit problem and his proposal to address it.
   The president isn't about to do that now, before even having a
chance to bargain with Democrats. But that didn't stop the
lawmakers from using the opportunity to attack Bush.
   ``Sometimes one has to use that bully pulpit for leadership,''
said Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.
   Republicans are not sitting mute, either.
   Eighteen GOP senators sent a letter to Bush promising they would
oppose any budget deal that includes new taxes. And Schuette has
collected more than 40 signatures from House Republicans for a
letter asking Bush to reject any package with tax increases.
   ``The Republican Party stands for the working men and women of
this country and has consistently opposed efforts to raise taxes,''
the note says.
   None of this has made the work of the budget negotiators any
easier.
   ``We're trying to walk through it, and you have the Hatfields
and the McCoys firing shots over our heads,'' said Panetta last
week.
   The negotiators have such a complicated task that their sessions
are expected to last weeks and perhaps months.
   ``One conferee was heard suggesting we could get it done by
December,'' said Rep. Bill Frenzel of Minnesota, ranking Republican
on the House Budget Committee and a participant in the talks.
   In the end, the onset of the campaign season could actually end
up speeding the negotiators' task. The bargainers know that the
sooner they finish their job, the easier it will be to line up a
majority of votes in the House and Senate to enact whatever budget
pact emerges.
   But for now, the prospect of the upcoming elections does little
but complicate the already problematic task of reaching a budget
compromise.

<HEAD>Top Salvadoran Military Commanders Linked to Human Rights Abuses</HEAD>

   Nearly all of El Salvador's top military
commanders have been in charge of units linked to human rights
abuses, according to a study released on the eve of a House battle
over cutting U.S. military aid.
   Fourteen of the country's 15 senior military officials have
commanded units documented to have killed civilians, tortured
prisoners, kidnapped citizens or covered up such abuses, found a
study by the Arms Control and Foreign Policy Caucus.
   The report did not seek to establish direct participation in
human rights crimes by the officers, who include Chief of Staff
Col. Rene Emilio Ponce. But it said the group's rise to power at
least illustrates a striking lack of accountability in the
country's military.
   Caucus chairman Rep. Howard Berman, D-Calif., said the results
call into question a United States policy which has provided nearly
$4 billion in aid to El Salvador over the past decade, one-fourth
of that directly to the military.
   ``When we got involved in El Salvador, we gambled that we could
reform the El Salvadoran military,'' Berman told a news conference.
``This report makes it tragically clear that this gamble failed.''
   The caucus, a group of members of the House and Senate who have
opposed U.S. policy toward El Salvador for years, issued its report
a day before the House was to begin a battle over whether to cut
the $85 million in annual U.S. military aid in half this year and
next. The cut would include new conditions to pressure the
government and leftist rebels to reach a negotiated peace.
   The amendment being considered today was part of a bill
authorizing new economic aid for the new democratic governments in
Panama and Nicaragua.
   Democratic proponents of the aid cut predicted they would
narrowly win that vote, which they hope will be a strong signal to
both the Salvadoran government and to the Bush administration that
U.S. policy is headed for a sharp turn.
   Opinion on Capitol Hill has turned increasingly against the
Salvadoran military since the murders last Nov. 16 of six Jesuit
priests, their housekeeper and her daughter. Nine military
personnel have been charged in the murders, but there is widespread
skepticism about whether the killers will ever be brought to
justice.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, in private meetings with
congressional opponents of the administration's policy, has agreed
some conditions should be imposed on new U.S. aid. But he has
objected to linking the issue to the Panama-Nicaragua aid bill.
   In a speech Monday to corporate executives, Deputy Secretary of
State Lawrence Eagleburger suggested the link could delay
consolidation of the new democracies.
   ``I personally think it is outrageous,'' Eagleburger said. ``I
am not here to bash the U.S. Congress, but there are some in that
body that deserve it.''
   The report also found that 12 of the 15 top-ranking officers
were 1966 graduates of the country's military academy and part of a
large class whose personal loyalties take precedence over the rule
of law.
   ``Many officers have detailed knowledge of each others'
questionable business practices,'' information which can be used to
blackmail others into stonewalling human rights investigations, it
said.
   One U.S. official told congressional investigators that after
the Jesuit killings ``a lot of officers knew something was up and
they didn't come forward ... They are a tight group.''
   And a U.S. Embassy official interviewed in El Salvador told
investigators that 5 to 15 percent of the military is made up of
``ghost soldiers'' who do not exist, but whose pay is funneled to
commanders.

   Anybody can roll around the capital in a
dark-windowed limousine, but what it costs depends on who you are.
A teen-ager on the way to the prom can end up paying six times more
than an aging big shot.
   That's age discrimination, say three area high school students
who filed complaints with local government consumer officials.
   Teenagers are charged the most, even though limousine service
managers say they're often the best behaved _ they don't drink and
they tip well because it's not their money.
   Adults pay roughly $60 an hour for a chauffeur-driven limousine
and the customer determines how long the rental will last; teenaged
prom-goers pay a lump sum of about $400 for a minimum of six hours.
   Kearney C. Francis, 16, said she called 30 area limousine
services, wanting a chauffeur to drive her and her friends to a
restaurant, then around the city for a quick tour, and then to the
prom, where they would find their own way home _ all in all, a
three-hour job.
   Francis says she discovered such an order was impossible to
fill. The companies she contacted all asked her if she was renting
the limousine for a prom. They then told her she must rent it for
at least six hours and pay the lump sum up front.
   ``I asked them why it was different for a prom, and I never
could get a straight answer,'' she said.
   ``During prom time, that's the way all the companies do it,''
said Senora Pyles of Ritz Limousine in Capitol Heights, Md., who
told Francis she would be charged $375 for six hours and could not
rent it for a shorter period.
   Asked if a couple wanting a sightseeing tour would be charged
the same, Pyles said no. ``We'd go out of business if we charged
you a six-hour minimum,'' she said.
   Andrea DelVillar, office administrator of Congressional
Limousine in Bethesda, Md., says the students are paying for the
``motherly approach.'' For $432 _ and a six-hour minimum, all paid
up front _ the students don't have to worry about paying the tax
and the tip and have an evening of ``promptness and worry-free
driving.''
   Congressional Limousine, unlike many other services, however,
includes sparkling wine and flowers in their prom packages.
   Francis says all customers, not just students, should be free
from worrying about good service. ``Taking care of your patrons
should be part of your service, not something you pay extra for.''
   DelVillar says adults also are charged a six-hour minimum on
weekend nights but acknowledged ``if it's a young voice on the
phone, I'll say, `is this for a prom,' and then discuss the package
with them.''
   But Keith Shifrin, a classmate of Francis, said he called a few
limousine services twice _ first, saying he was arranging a prom
date, then again saying he wanted a limousine for a sightseeing
tour with his wife.
   The prom calls received quotes of package deals; the tour calls
received quotes of $59 to $65 an hour with no set minimum.
   Finally, Francis said her father, Leslie Francis, called Arrive
in Style limousine service and negotiated a three-hour package for
$180, no questions asked.
   Pat Bowie of Arrive in Style said, however, his company does ask
teenagers if they are reserving a limousine for the prom, and ``we
keep a list of all the prom nights in the area.''
   Arrive in Style then charges $395 with a six-hour minimum.
``It's just a business decision, since most of your proms run five
to 12 hours.''
   Judy Doctor, manager of consumer education at the Montgomery
County, Md., Office of Consumer Affairs, said she had received
Francis's complaint, which she filed along with Stefanie Felrice
and Miriam Plotkin, and the county would begin investigations for
discrimination and possible violations of the county's Consumer
Protection Law.

   Band director George Foreman raised his
hands and let them drop in a quick downbeat, summoning a brassy
musical flourish from about two dozen trumpet, trombone and tuba
players.
   The martial melody and its bouncy rhythm conjured a nostalgic
picture from the turn of the century, when thousands of brass bands
performed on weekends at community parks all across the country.
   But the fanfare being played at a recent rehearsal of The
Advocate Brass Band was newly written. And some music observers say
the 3-year-old group and its music are part of a slow but steady
revival of brass bands.
   The band is preparing to play host for the Great American Brass
Band Festival June 16-17. The festival will be held at the city
park in this central Kentucky town known for its antique charm and
Victorian-style homes.
   This night, however, the musicians were getting ready for the
debut performance of the newly composed ``The Advocate-Messenger
March.''
   The song, in the tradition of newspaper anthems such as ``The
Washington Post March,'' is named for the local daily paper, the
band's sponsor. The group has a large collection of rarely heard
marches named for a wide array of American papers.
   As many as 20,000 people are expected for the festival, which
will include a balloon race, buggy rides and displays of antique
cars and bicycles.
   ``We want to capture the nostalgia of a concert in the park,''
said Foreman, co-chairman of the festival and managing director of
the Norton Center for the Arts at Centre.
   Through much of the 19th century and into the 1920s, the brass
band was a familiar part of the American town. The bands played at
political rallies, parades, parties and concerts.
   Harper's magazine in the 1880s reported that there were 10,000
brass bands in the United States, Foreman said.
   Brass bands began to decline, Foreman believes, because World
War I took away many of the musicians and the advent of radio and
phonographs ``gave people other entertainment opportunities.''
   Paul Droste, president of the North American Brass Band
Association, said there are about 60 brass bands in the country.
The association was formed in 1983 when the bands began to rebound
after nearly dying out in the 1950s.
   Droste, a music professor at Ohio State University, is also
director of the Brass Band of Columbus, a British-style band that
has been named champion of the association four times in the past
five years.
   The Columbus band is expected to be among eight bands at the
non-competitive Danville festival. Among the other groups will be
Dejan's Olympia Brass Band of New Orleans. The seven-piece band has
performed at Mardi Gras, jazz funerals, in movies and on television.
   ``It's a unique musical approach,'' Harry Mayronne, Olympia
Brass Band business manager, said of the festival. ``We're excited
about playing in it. It's exploring all areas of brass band music.''
   Another is Mr. Jack Daniel's Original Silver Cornet Band of
Lynchburg, Tenn., which has played at the White House, Lincoln
Center and three public TV specials.
   The Advocate Brass Band started in 1987 when the Danville
Advocate-Messenger asked Foreman if he would put together a band to
play at an old-fashioned political stump rally it was sponsoring.
   ``When it was over nobody cared much about the speeches,'' said
Mary Schurz, publisher of the newspaper. ``But they loved the
band.''
   The newspaper decided to sponsor the band. It purchased uniforms
for the members to wear during its six public performances each
year.
   There are several college and high school band directors, an
optician, stockbroker and a space systems engineer in the 25-piece
band. Vince DeMartino, a nationally known trumpeter, plays cornet.
   ``I think this is what communities are all about by providing
music and entertainment and a musical experience for ourselves,''
said DeMartino. ``It's great enjoyment for me. It's great
relaxation and a non-pressure situation.''

   Justice Louis Peck says he feels like a
condemned man who has won a reprieve _ the right not to be forced
into retirement at 70.
   A federal appeals court in New York ruled Monday that the
71-year-old Vermont Supreme Court justice could remain on the bench.
   Peck had been placed on retirement status by the court's
administrator, Thomas Lehner, and his last day on the job was
marked in for June 30, 1989.
   Vermont's Constitution requires all judges to retire at age 70,
but Peck would have none of it, and he filed an age discrimination
complaint.
   ``I feel like a condemned man who has had a reprieve,'' Peck
said after the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a federal
judge's ruling in his favor. ``Personally it is very satisfying.''
   However, Peck said he may retire anyway.
   Lehner said he had no immediate comment.
   The ruling settles the Peck case but not the mandatory
retirement issue.
   Two other federal appeals courts, the 8th Circuit based in St.
Louis and the 1st Circuit in Boston, have ruled against judges
wanting to stay in their jobs despite retirement provisions in
their states.
   ``Obviously Congress has not made its intention clear if the
courts disagree,'' said William Gray, who represented the state of
Vermont against Peck.
   Gray said the state has not decided whether to appeal to the
U.S. Supreme Court.
   At issue was whether the federal Age Discrimination and
Employment Act applied to appointed state judges.
   Vermont argued that judges fit one of the exceptions _
``appointees on the policymaking level'' _ and that Congress should
not tell states how to set up their courts.
   On the first argument, the appeals court said appointed state
judges do not fall under the exception. On the second argument, the
judges said Vermont had failed to show the federal law trampled on
the rights of the states.
   Peck was appointed to the five-member Supreme Court bench in
1981. His term expires in 1993.

   An increase in Stormie Jones' medication
quieted doctors' fears that the world's longest surviving
heart-liver transplant patient was rejecting her second donor liver.
   ``Her condition's excellent. She just needed an adjustment in
her medication,'' said Dr. Robert D. Gordon, transplant surgeon at
Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh.
   The 12-year-old from White Settlement, Texas, returned to
Pittsburgh on Sunday after tests showed high liver enzyme levels _
a sign of possible organ rejection. She had been taking the
Japanese drug FK-506 since her last operation, on Feb. 20.
   Stormie will receive higher doses of FK-506 intravenously until
she is discharged, probably within a few days, and will take the
drug orally when she goes home, Gordon said Monday.
   ``When you're using a new drug you're a little sensitive to
toxicity, over-sensitive perhaps. We now realize we lowered our
dosages a little too much,'' he said.
   Modifications in dosages also will be made for many of the 400
transplant patients currently taking FK-506. The Food and Drug
Administration approved the drug for use only at Children's and
nearby Presbyterian-University Hospital.
   ``I think we've been making that error systematically over the
last few months,'' Gordon said.
   In 1984, Stormie received the double transplant to control a
congenital condition that left her cholesterol levels 10 times
higher than normal. She received a new liver this year after
hepatitis damaged her first donor liver.
   The surgeon said Stormie this time had a mild rejection episode,
which he said is not uncommon the first few months after a
transplant.
   ``We're not alarmed,'' he said. ``We don't think this liver is
in jeopardy or that she's looking at another transplant.''
   That's good news for Stormie, who has been awaiting a party for
her 13th birthday on May 31, said her mother, Lois ``Suzie''
Purcell.
   ``Thirteen is a very special time in someone's life,'' she said.
``She's excited. She's running around all over the place.''

<TEXT>
   A group of revolutionaries who helped
topple dictator Nicolae Ceausescu have come up with an unorthodox
offer for Communist Party members to buy a way out of their
political past.
   For just one leu (less than one cent), Communists can buy a
certificate saying the holder no longer wants to be a member of the
hated party or its youth branch.
   The anti-Communist group ``21 December,'' whose 2,200 members
all fought in the December revolution, have decided to put aside
the first 100 forms for the use of Romania's new leadership.
   ``We expect President (Ion) Iliescu to be on top of the list''
organization president Alexandru Nacu said Monday. Iliescu, the
former Communist official who leads in early returns from Sunday's
elections, fell out with Ceausescu in 1971 and was demoted.
   The Romanian Communist Party never formally dissolved, but
nobody claims membership anymore. All party property has been
assigned to different organizations. But the party still legally
exists.
   Before the revolution, there were some 3.7 million Communist
Party members and about 4 million young Communists.
   ``We fought against communism in University Square in December
and we continue to do so. Therefore, we believe we are morally
entitled to certify the dissolution of the Romanian Communist Party
when it happens,'' said Lucian Mihai, the organization's legal
expert. He referred to a downtown Bucharest square.
   The December 21 group wouldn't predict when that might happen.
   But the certificates could turn out to be quite lucrative for
the group. It plans to declare the two organizations dissolved only
when enough certificates have been issued to cover at least half of
the Communist membership.
   At a news conference Monday launching the new plan, the group
sold at least five certificates, including one to its leader, Nacu.

   A lawyer has been suspended for refusing to
appear before a grievance committee investigating his conduct in
the Tawana Brawley case.
   Alton H. Maddox, 44, represented the black teen-ager, who was
found by a grand jury to have concocted a tale of rape at the hands
of a gang of whites.
   In 1988, Attorney General Robert Abrams filed complaints with a
judicial panel accusing Maddox of making baseless allegations
against officials and investigators.
   Robert H. Strauss, chief counsel for the committee, said the
suspension imposed Monday will remain until Maddox agrees to
cooperate. Maddox has repeatedly refused to respond to the
complaints or testify, the panel said.
   Maddox charged that the suspension was an attempt by Abrams to
punish him for his ``vigorous and zealous'' representation of Miss
Brawley. The case raised racial tensions in New York City in
1987-88.
   ``This was expected. We knew that Mr. Abrams had to have his
way. This is a prosecutorial vendetta,'' Maddox said. ``I will not
be taking it lying down. This won't be lowering the racial
temperature in his town.''
   Abrams' office refused to comment on the suspension.
   Miss Brawley's advisers _ Maddox, lawyer C. Vernon Mason and the
Rev. Al Sharpton _ had told her her not to cooperate with the
investigation of her charges on the grounds it was part of a racist
cover-up. They also accused some public officials of taking part in
the alleged rape or covering up what happened.

   The dollar fell against the Japanese yen Tuesday,
while the key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange gained moderately,
the first advance in three trading days.
   The dollar closed at 152.40 yen, down 0.85 yen from Monday's
close of 153.25 yen. After opening at 153.36 yen, the dollar ranged
between 152.30 yen and 153.36 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues rose 173.25
points to close at 31,938.30 points. Tuesday's advance followed a
248.67-point decline on Monday and a 47.88 point-slip last Friday.
   In the bond market, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds inched down to 87.34 points as of 3 p.m.
(2:00 a.m. EDT), down from Monday's close of 87.39. The yield stood
at 7.095 percent, up from the previous day's 7.085 percent.
   Currency dealers said the dollar opened slightly higher
following its overnight upswing in New York, where it finished at
153.73 yen, up from 153 yen Friday.
   ``The dollar weakened as it was affected by cross-trading''
between the yen and the West German mark, said Kozo Yoshida, a
dealer with Mitsui Taiyo Kobe Bank.
   Yoshida said otherwise there was no major market-affecting news.
   The yen's rebound triggered an upswing in stocks, dealers said.
   ``Share prices as a whole dropped in early trading on
index-related selling, but the yen's recovery against the dollar
encouraged many investors,'' said Yu Yoshida, a stock analyst with
Yamaichi Securities.
   In the bond market, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bond edged higher to 87.33 from Monday's close
of 87.09. That lowered the yield to 7.10 percent from 7.15 percent.

   Jim Henson's admirers gave him the whimsical,
colorful send-off he wanted, complete with songs, dance and, of
course, the Muppets.
   ``We had such great silly fun together,'' said Frank Oz, who
played Bert to Henson's Ernie, and Miss Piggy to his Kermit the
Frog. ``The best thing is when you watched Jim laugh until he
cried.''
   Thousands took part in the tribute to the master puppeteer
Monday at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine. Henson died
Wednesday of pneumonia at 53.
   The happy songs, happy words and a Dixieland band were in
accordance with wishes Henson expressed in letters to his family,
written four years ago and opened after his death. Henson had asked
that mourners not wear black.
   The funeral service program contained a quote from Henson:
``Please watch out for each other and love and forgive everybody.
It's a good life, enjoy it.'
   An organist opened with a mournful rendition of the theme from
``Sesame Street,'' which used the Muppets to entertain and educate
children worldwide.
   Then a band strolled in playing ``Please Release Me,'' followed
by ministers, a red-and-white robed church choir and family members.
   ``There is no question about Jim Henson's great artistry and the
extent to which we have all been touched by it,'' Harry Belafonte
said. ``Greater than his artistry was his humanity.''
   Mourners fluttered colorful butterflies atop metal stems as
Belafonte and three back-up singers sang ``Turn the World Around,''
a song he wrote and Henson used.
   The mourners again fluttered their butterflies while listening
to a recording of Henson as Kermit singing ``Rainbow Connection''
from ``The Muppet Movie.''
   Big Bird, a character played by Caroll Spinney, sang, ``It's Not
Easy Being Green,'' a number usually done by Kermit. Afterward, Big
Bird looked heavenward, said, ``Thank you, Kermit,'' then slowly
walked away, head hung low.
   The 5,000-seat cathedral was nearly full and lined with colorful
floral arrangements, some with animal figures in them. At the
entrance was a gallery of photos with Henson, his family and
``Sesame Street'' characters.
   ``He's stayed with us long enough to give us certainly all we
need, if we're strong enough to carry on,'' said Henson's widow,
Jane, who stood with their five children to address the
congregation.
   Her advice to the mourners was, ``Enjoy life to the fullest. He
always did, but always with a little pain, a little sorrow that
gave it richness.''
   Henson's son Brian read excerpts from his father's letters.
   ``Don't feel bad that I'm gone,'' Henson wrote to his children.
``It will be an interesting time for me. ... I look forward to
seeing all of you when you come over.''

   Operation Rescue declared no court will deter
its members from blocking abortion clinics in New York, Boston or
Atlanta.
   The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday allowed a permanent ban on
Operation Rescue demonstrations that blocked access to abortion
clinics in the New York area. It was the third legal setback in two
weeks for the anti-abortion group.
   The justices, without comment or any recorded dissenting vote,
left intact a federal judge's order barring Operation Rescue
members from interfering with women entering the clinics.
   ``Our sole purpose is to stop these women from taking their
children in,'' said Operation Rescue spokesman Bob Jewitt. ``If we
can save a child, we will do that, we will continue to do that.
Injunctions won't stop us.''
   Abortion rights advocates acknowledged the difficulty of
stopping the protests.
   ``I know they will not go away,'' said Diana M. Gurieva,
president of Planned Parenthood of New York City. ``But the
decision will strengthen the resolve of law enforcement and the
lower courts to at least punish these people appropriately.''
   Last week, the high court voted 5-4 to leave intact a similar
ban on Operation Rescue blockades at clinics in Atlanta. Also
Monday, Massachusetts Attorney General James M. Shannon secured a
court order barring anti-abortion groups from obstructing access to
clinics in that state.
   The court's order in the Atlanta case was preliminary, in a
dispute that reached the justices as a request for emergency help
before Georgia courts had finished studying the controversy.
   Randall Terry, founder of Operation Rescue, said in a statement
that ``no court can prohibit us from rescuing babies.''
   ``These judges have joined the heritage of Nazi judges who
sanctioned the murder of the innocent. The day of judgment will
hold terrifying consequences for them,'' he said.
   Auxiliary Bishop Austin Vaughn, a suburban New York cleric who
rebuked Gov. Mario Cuomo for supporting abortion rights, said he
wondered how Martin Luther King Jr. ``would have reacted to an
order that told him it was illegal to continue his civil
disobedience.''
   Bill Baird, who operates two Long Island abortion clinics,
called the Supreme Court decision ``a tremendous victory that
recognizes women have the right to go in a building.''
   ``But I'd like to see the courts go further and assign federal
marshals to escort women in, just as they escorted blacks into
buildings in the 1960s,'' he said.
   He said he doubted the court's announcement would end harassment
outside clinics. ``You're dealing with religious zealots here.''
   Molly Yard, president of the National Organization for Women,
said she ``couldn't be more pleased'' with the ruling, but she also
warned abortion rights supporters not to get too optimistic.
   ``This is the only victory we've had since Webster,'' she said,
referring to the Supreme Court ruling last summer that gave states
more room to restrict abortion.

   A federal judge has demanded prosecutors
disclose who approved the alleged kidnapping of a Mexican doctor
charged in the murder of U.S. drug agent Enrique Camarena.
   U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie asked for the information to
be divulged at a hearing scheduled for Friday on the manner in
which Dr. Humberto Alvarez Machain was brought to the United States
for trial.
   Witnesses said the 42-year-old gynecologist was abducted April 2
from his office in Guadalajara at the behest of the Drug
Enforcement Administration.
   The affair has strained relations between the United States and
Mexico. President Carlos Salinas de Gortari said Mexico's
sovereignty had been violated.
   At a conference Monday, the judge told prosecutors: ``I'd like
to know the highest level of authority who authorized this.''
   The judge has delayed the trial pending the outcome of the
hearing.
   Camarena, 31, was kidnapped off a Guadalajara street in 1985.
Testimony at the trial of three men in 1988 revealed that he was
tortured and interrogated by drug lords before being slain along
with his pilot. Their bodies were found on a ranch 65 miles outside
Guadalajara.
   Prosecutors maintain that Alvarez administered drugs to revive
Camarena so the agent could tortured further before he was slain.
   Three Mexicans and a Honduran are on trial for their alleged
roles in the murders of Camarena, the pilot and two tourists who
prosecutors said were mistaken for drug agents.
   Outside court, Alvarez' lawyer, Robert Steinberg, said he would
call four or five witnesses at the hearing. Among them, he said,
will be Antonio Garate Bustamante, a former Mexican police officer
who has said he arranged the doctor's abduction at the behest of
the DEA.
   DEA officials have vowed to capture and prosecute every person
involved in the Camarena murder.
   Steinberg said he would argue that Rafeedie has no jurisdiction
over the Alvarez matter and should either send it to the World
Court for resolution or return the doctor to his native Mexico.
   ``Give it to the Mexican authorities and let them prosecute it,
if they wish,'' the attorney said.

<HEAD>Trinity Reaches Record Levels in Texas; Floodwaters Recede in
Louisiana</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LIBERTY, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The rain-swollen Trinity River hit its
highest level here in 48 years, but the vast amounts of water being
released into the river through the floodgates of Livingston Dam
dropped.
   After four days of letting a record 100,800 cubic feet per
second of water roar through the dam, engineers reduced the amount
Monday to 98,400.
   The releases, dictated by the rising water, have flooded
thousands of acres below the dam. Normally, 8,000 to 9,000 cfs pass
through the dam, about 45 miles north of Liberty and 65 miles north
of Houston.
   The Red Cross planned to open disaster centers today to help
victims in the seven Texas counties flooded since the Trinity began
rising.
   Elsewhere, tornadoes touched down in Kentucky, floodwaters
receded in hard-hit Arkansas and Louisiana, and federal emergency
workers were assessing storm damage today in Indiana.
   Heavy flooding since April 15 has been blamed for 13 deaths in
Texas and one in Oklahoma. Flooding and storms elsewhere have
killed two people in Illinois and one in Missouri, a woman who
apparently was swept away by floodwaters at Jefferson City on
Thursday.
   In northwestern and central Louisiana, the Red River continued
to fall. Gov. Buddy Roemer said he would ask for federal aid for 11
parishes where crops were destroyed by flooding.
   In Texas, where 41 counties have been declared eligible for
federal disaster funds, officials said the Trinity appeared to be
stabilizing.
   Late Monday, the Trinity was at 29.83 feet in Liberty,
surpassing the previous record depth of 29.51 feet in 1942, said
Jim Mitchum, coordinator of the Liberty County emergency management
office.
   Rising waters on Monday crested over a 6-foot dike built around
the home of Howard Pipkins. In the past two weeks the home, which
had been remodeled after it filled with two feet of water last
summer, had become an island.
   ``I hate to see that happen,'' said Mitchum. ``He worked real
hard to get that house from getting water. He was talking earlier
about jacking up the house in case it broke.''
   The Red Cross estimated 4,600 homes have been affected by
flooding in the seven-county area. Spokesman Bill Barron said 500
people have stayed at Red Cross shelters since the Trinity began
rising more than a week ago. The agency also has distributed more
than 9,000 meals from shelters and mobile kitchens.
   Residents and merchants in Hot Springs, Ark., began cleaning up
from a 24-hour deluge of 13 inches of rain over the weekend.
   City officials estimated damage to businesses and public works
at $5.3 million. Not counted was damage to 136 homes in the town of
23 hot springs.
   Hot Springs National Park Superintendent Roger Giddings said
pumps that distribute the thermal waters to seven bath houses and
three hotels were knocked out by the flooding and would not be
working for at least a week.
   But a rally was planned for Thursday to spread the message the
resort is prepared to receive Memorial Day visitors as usual.
   Legislation was introduced Monday in Washington to provide
emergency disaster payments to farmers hit by flooding in
Louisiana, Arkansas and Texas.
   Twisters touched down Monday evening in seven Kentucky counties.
The worst damage appeared to be at Richmond, where a bar, a
storehouse and several other buildings were destroyed or heavily
damaged. One person was reported injured.

<TEXT>
   A dispute over the Hatfield town bell
appears to have rung to a close with a judge's ruling that the
hourly tolling must cease.
   The ruling was met with relief by a pair of newcomers living
next door to the bell and with dismay by townsfolk who had argued
the chiming was a treasured part of the New England character of
the 320-year-old farm community.
   ``A certain part of the heritage of the town has been
disrupted,'' Selectman Thomas Hurley said Monday after Superior
Court Judge John F. Murphy ordered that the 92-year-old bell be
stilled between 9 p.m. and 7 a.m.
   Selectman Chairman George Zgrodnick Jr. said the ruling would
mean turning off the bell permanently because the town can't afford
an automatic timer. The bell was sounded Monday night but was to be
turned off this morning.
   Richard and Pamela Carnall, who had moved from nearby
Northampton in 1988, had claimed the chiming was keeping them up at
night.
   After selectmen refused to stop the chiming, the couple sued the
town. A jury May 14 declared the bell a nuisance but decided that
only Mrs. Carnall was injured by its ringing and that the couple
was not entitled to damages.
   Based on the ruling, the Carnalls asked the judge to silence the
bell at night
   W. Michael Ryan, the Carnalls' lawyer, said the ruling actually
recalls an old tradition of ringing the bell at curfew. ``We've
ended a 20th-century tradition and revived a colonial-Federalist
era tradition,'' he said.
   The Carnalls had earlier offered to pay for a timer, but the
offer has been withdrawn, Ryan said.
   The Carnalls were unavailable for comment Monday, Ryan said.
   When the Carnalls bought their 19th-century house across from
the First Congregational Church, the bell was not working. But six
months later it was fixed. The couple, who have a young daughter,
complained the bell deprived them of sleep.

<HEAD>Hancock, Loeb for Business Journalists Announced</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Business journalists from The Wall Street Journal, The
Washington Post and The Associated Press were among those honored
with prizes for excellence in two contests.
   Winners were announced Monday for both the John Hancock and
Gerald Loeb awards for 1990. Both contests honor work that furthers
public understanding of business issues.
   The prize-winning work ranged from the savings and loan scandal
to personal finance to the workings of the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
   Heading the list of seven Hancock winners was AP writer Vivian
Marino, winner in the syndicated and news service category for a
series on people and their finances. The stories covered topics
ranging from selling a home to filing for personal bankruptcy. It
was the third consecutive Hancock award and the 10th overall for
the AP in the 23-year history of the contest.
   Also winning Hancocks were:
   _Dana Rubin of Texas Monthly magazine, in the general-interest
magazine category, for ``The Day Leroy Died,'' a piece exploring
the collapse of a small rural town's uninsured bank.
   _Johnnie L. Roberts of The Wall Street Journal, in the financial
newspaper or magazine category, for articles on the reliability of
Dun &amp; Bradstreet credit reports.
   _Rick Atkinson and David Maraniss of The Washington Post, in the
category for newspapers over 300,000 in circulation, for a series
on the S&amp;L crisis, titled ``The $150 Billion Calamity.''
   _Rebecca Smith of The Tribune in Oakland, Calif., in the
category for newspapers between 100,000 and 300,000 circulation,
for a series on the thrift crisis, titled the ``S&amp;L Debacle.''
   _Bill Lazarus of the Star-Tribune in Caspar, Wyo., in the
category for newspapers under 100,000 circulation, for articles
examining the regulation of insurance in Wyoming.
   _Alex Beam of The Boston Globe, among financial columnists, for
columns analyzing topics such as the decline of Massachusetts'
Route 128 technology belt and the troubles of Wang Laboratories.
   Winners in each category receive $5,000 cash.
   Leading the Loeb winners in the large newspaper category
(circulation over 400,000) were David Vise and Steve Coll of The
Washington Post for ``The Man From Wall Street: John Shad's Reign
at the SEC.'' Earlier this year, Vise and Coll also won a Pulitzer
Prize for their reporting on the SEC.
   Other Loeb winners were:
   _In the medium-sized newspaper category (circulation over
150,000), Jerry Kammer, Andy Hall and a team from The Arizona
Republic for coverage of the collapse of Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan.
   _In the small newspapers category (circulation under 150,000),
Gary Belsky and Phyllis Furman of Crain's New York Business for
``Calculated Madness: The Rise and Fall of Crazy Eddie Antar.''
   _Among magazines, Peter Brimelow and Leslie Spencer of Forbes
for ``The Best Paid Lawyers in America.''
   _In the commentary category, L. Gordon Crovitz of The Wall
Street Journal for his columns on alleged prosecutorial abuses of
the racketeering law.
   _In the deadline reporting category, Kathryn Harris and Paul
Richter of the Los Angeles Times for coverage of the Time-Warner
merger.
   The judges also gave an award of special recognition, outside
the established categories, to Richard McCord of The Green Bay
(Wis.) News-Chronicle. McCord's series ``It's Now or Never'' told
the story of the News-Chronicle's struggle to survive as an
independent paper.
   A prize of $1,000 is given in each Loeb category. The awards
were established in 1957 by the late Gerald Loeb.
   The Hancock prizes are awarded by John Hancock Financial
Services of Boston. The Loeb contest is administered by the John E.
Anderson Graduate School of Management at the University of
California, Los Angeles.

   Michael Jordan and other pro basketball players
are getting inner-city youngsters hooked on math.
   Actually, it's free-lance writer Rich Share who uses Jordan's
shooting percentages and other statistics to teach the basics to
high school students struggling in math.
   Share, who holds a teaching degree from Northern Illinois
University, tutors 20 to 30 students three days a week at Dunbar
High School in a poor South Side neighborhood.
   ``You might say kids are getting too much sports, but you use
whatever works _ and sports works,'' he said. ``This is 6th or 7th
grade material, and I'm dealing with freshmen and sophomores. At
first 70 or 80 didn't get it right. Now, I'd say 80 percent can.
And they are attentive. There are no troublemakers.''
   To really bring examples home, he marches his students outside
to shoot baskets.
   ``The kids shoot free throws then figure out the percentages.
They really enjoy it. If you shoot two of seven that's 29 percent.
You'll remember that because that's what you shot,'' he said.
   Results have been so impressive Dunbar Principal Floyd Banks
plans to use a manual Share wrote for all freshmen needing remedial
help next year.
   ``This is a way to challenge these kids' interest into sports
into something constructive, especially those who haven't been able
to grasp the basics in elementary school,'' Banks said.
   Share uses basketball because ``it's my favorite sport and it's
their favorite sport.''
   ``They're always talking about basketball,'' he said. ``Also,
unlike baseball or football, the basketball season starts at the
start of the school year and ends at end of school year.''

<HEAD>U.S. Backs Multinational NATO Forces, Cheney Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NATO should consider revamping its
military structure by using multinational forces as U.S. troop
levels in Europe are reduced, U.S. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney
said today.
   Cheney, taking part in his second NATO defense ministers'
meeting in two weeks, said the Western alliance must adapt if an
East-West conventional arms pact is reached and the threat of war
against the Warsaw Pact recedes.
   ``If all present, positive trends continue ... then we can
contemplate new ways of doing business,'' Cheney told reporters
aboard his plane en route to Brussels.
   ``I think, based on a first look, the notion of a multinational
force has some appeal,'' Cheney said. ``I think it's worth
pursuing.''
   Cheney arrived in Brussels today for a two-day meeting of NATO
defense ministers to discuss the alliance's future military posture.
   The ministers are holding a series of discussions in advance of
a summit of NATO leaders in July. President Bush proposed the
summit as a way to discuss changes in the role of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization in light of the upheaval sweeping
Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.
   The defense ministers' meeting comes at a time when German
unification is advancing rapidly and pressure is growing in
Washington for sharp cuts in military spending and reductions in
the 300,000-strong U.S. force based in Europe.
   Using multinational forces in NATO could offer cost savings and
ease nationalist sensitivities, particularly in West Germany where
most NATO troops are stationed, said a senior defense official
traveling with Cheney.
   Such forces could also help blunt any drive to take a unified
Germany out of NATO.
   ``One way to emphasize the multilateral nature of the NATO
alliance is to have units that are composed of troops of various
nations,'' Cheney said. Such a plan would also ``emphasize the fact
that (Germany) is not treated any differently than anyone else.''
   As an example, Cheney said a multinational corps could be formed
with three divisions each from a different nation. A U.S. division
is made up of about 15,000 to 18,000 soldiers.
   At present, NATO land forces defend territory under a so-called
``layer cake'' formula by which an army from an allied nation
defends a certain sector.
   U.S. forces, for example, are stationed primarily in southern
and central West Germany, while French and British forces defend
other regions.
   With the elimination of the border between East and West
Germany, such a system would have to be revamped.
   Under a multinational system, U.S., German or British soldiers
could be dispersed among several nations, said the senior defense
official. He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Soldiers of multinational units could be based in Britain or
Canada for training exercises, the official said.
   Such an arrangement, for example, could help reduce complaints
among the West German public. West Germans have grown increasingly
irritated with NATO military exercises and accidents caused by
low-flying aircraft.
   ``Today, there is the sense that Germany is singled out because
the majority of troops are on their soil,'' the official said.
   But the official cautioned that setting up multinational forces
poses many problems, including language barriers and varied weapons
systems.
   He said he expected the defense ministers to propose a study of
the multinational force concept during their two-day session.
   ``Mainly, they are trying to ask themselves, `How should NATO
look in this new environment in Europe?''' the official said.

<HEAD>Dollar Mostly Firmer in Europe, Gold lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar was mostly firmer this morning against
the major currencies in busy trading in Europe.
   Gold prices were lower.
   Foreign exchange dealers said the West German mark weakened amid
domestic political uncertainties and sentiment favored the strong
British pound among European currencies.
   They said the mark was being hurt by the reluctance of the West
German opposition Social Democrats to back rapid German
unification, largely because of concern over the social and
economic costs.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends before European markets open, the
dollar fell by 0.85 yen to a closing 152.40 yen from Monday's close
of 153.25.
   In London Tuesday morning the dollar was quoted lower at 152.05
yen.
   One British pound cost $1.6897 in London, cheaper for buyers
than Monday's late $1.6917.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Monday:
   _1.6665 West German marks, up from 1.6630
   _1.4215 Swiss francs, down from 1.4225
   _5.6155 French francs, up from 5.6060
   _1.8724 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8692
   _1,225.00 Italian lire, up from 1,222.75
   _1.1760 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1793
   Gold bullion prices were lower after an overnight rise in the
value of the dollar and a stock prices rally on Wall Street.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $372.50 a troy ounce. At
mid-morning, the major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of
$372.40 down from $373.25 bid late Monday.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $372.60, down from $373.50 late
Monday.
   Gold in Hong Kong closed at a bid $373.58, down from Monday's
closing $374.08.
   Silver bullion was trading in London at a bid price of $5.12 a
troy ounce, down from Monday's late 5.14.

   Welders scrambled over a six-ton steel ape
hanging onto a replica of a New York City bridge, sending sparks
flying six stories down.
   And families with baby strollers sauntered by, seemingly
unperturbed as technicians fine-tuned King Kong, Jaws and other
attractions and builders hurried to complete Manhattan and San
Francisco street facades.
   Universal Studios Florida opened its doors to the public for the
first time Monday, giving about 10,000 visitors a preview of the
latest entertainment park.
   The big attraction Monday was the E.T. Adventure, featuring the
extra-terrestrial creature that starred in the Steven Spielberg
movie.
   E.T. got the approval of 5-year-old Gemma John, of West
Yorkshire, England. ``He's nice. He smiled,'' said Gemma, who waved
and smiled back shyly.
   The $600 million park features acres of film-production sound
stages along with gigantic high-tech rides and shows. It is easing
into full operation with a break-in period before its official June
7 opening.
   ``It's painstaking work,'' says Jay Stein, Universal's top
executive. ``We've got a lot of gnawing, aggravating things and
problems to resolve, last-minute things that, no matter how well it
all checks out in testing, have to be changed and fixed and
fine-tuned.''
   For instance, how much of a banana breath do you give the
six-story-tall ape on New York's Queensboro Bridge that's
manhandling an aerial tramway car filled with 50 terrified
customers?
   Has the ``hydraulics guru'' got the right timing and tilt on the
pontoon boat that the great white shark crunches his jaws into?
Does the boat's stern lift up as soon as it should, or as far as it
should, giving the wide-eyed passengers just the right amount of
thrill?
   Less than half of the shows and rides are in operation at the
444-acre theme park and working studio. But Universal executives
say everything is on schedule for the inaugural of the tourist
rival to the Disney-MGM Studios.
   Attendance is being held to 10,000 to 12,000 people per day
until the park officially opens.

   A fire burned for 30 minutes at the Rocky
Flats nuclear weapons plant, and officials said there was no
release of radioactive materials.
   The fire late Monday was contained to one room of a plating
laboratory and posed no threat to public health or safety, said
Jeff Schwartz, a spokesman for EG&amp;G, managers of the U.S.
Department of Energy plant.
   One person who suffered minor eye irritation due to smoke was
treated by the plant's occupational health department and released,
Schwartz said.
   The fire appeared to be electrical in origin and involved
plastic materials. It occurred in Building 444, a non-plutonium
production building, he said.
   The fire was detected at about 8:50 p.m. Firefighters from the
Rocky Flats fire department and the building's sprinkler system
extinguished the fire by 9:20 p.m.
   As a precautionary measure, the plant's emergency operations
center was activated and all employees in the building were
evacuated until 11:45 p.m.
   Federal investigators searched the plant in June 1989 looking
for evidence of illegal dumping and incineration of hazardous
wastes.
   Plutonium operations at Rocky Flats are presently shut down.
Officials have announced preliminary plans to resume productions in
mid-June.

<HEAD>Judge Vows to Protect Minority Teachers in Desegregation Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANA KENNEDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Boston's public school system must maintain
court-ordered racial hiring guidelines and not base proposed
teacher layoffs solely on seniority, a judge has ruled.
   U.S. District Court Judge Arthur W. Garrity said Monday the
school system must still achieve a teaching and administrative
staff of at least 25 percent blacks and minorities after the court
ends its involvement in Boston school desegregation.
   Garrity made his remarks during a hearing on his plan for a
final judgment that would end litigation in the long-running case.
   In 1974, Garrity ordered the citywide busing of black and white
children to integrate the city's schools. The move sparked several
years of busing-related violence.
   Garrity said his final order in the case, to be issued at an
undetermined date, will ensure that the quota remains in effect
until minority teachers have achieved enough seniority to protect
them from immediate layoffs.
   Several hundred city teachers are expected to be laid off
because of budget cutbacks. If minority quotas are eradicated,
black teachers fear they will be among the first to go because they
have little seniority.
   According to the Boston Teachers Union contract, layoffs are
made solely on seniority. The union has fought the continuation of
the minority quota system.
   Garrity told the hearing that he wanted to end the court's
direct involvement in the case because of a new school assignment
plan implemented last year. It goes into effect in September.
   ``The principle reason for ending the involvement is that we
don't have a plan anymore,'' he said. ``The controlled choice plan
is in effect. But it's not the court's plan and we shouldn't be
involved.''
   Garrity monitored the city's compliance with the desegregation
order until 1987, when a federal appeals court ruled that the
schools were finally desegregated and gave control over student
assignment back to the School Committee.

<HEAD>Police Advise Visitors to Stay Out of Georgetown on Weekend Nights</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Visitors should stay out of the city's
Georgetown section on weekend nights because of growing crowds and
the inability of police to provide special patrols, the police
department's chief spokesman says.
   ``I advise people to avoid Georgetown if they can,'' Lt.
Reginald Smith said Monday. ``A large number of people migrate to
that area on weekends and that is an ongoing concern for us.''
   Georgetown, which has one of the Washington area's most popular
nighttime entertainment districts, has long been plagued by
occasional street crime, primarily robberies.
   Gary Hankins, chairman of the labor committee of the Fraternal
Order of Police, said Monday that five police officers were injured
in confrontations with groups of young men last weekend.
   The weekend was supposed to mark the beginning of special
anti-crime patrols in Georgetown, including the deployment of more
than 40 additional officers and the use of a special mobile
headquarters to expedite booking of those arrested.
   No additional officers were added to the usual deployment of
six, and the mobile headquarters was not present because of cuts in
the police budget. Police Chief Isaac Fulwood announced last week
that the patrols would be curtailed, due to $4 million in cuts to
the police overtime budget.

detach, posing a potentially fatal choking hazard.
   The Consumer Product Safety Commission said Monday there have
been no known deaths or injuries caused by the toys, all of which
contain music boxes.
   The CSPC said the toys have wind-up keys protruding from their
backs and a small white tag sewed to the side or bottom that reads:
``The San Francisco Music Box Company, Emeryville, Ca., Reg. No.
PA-2642 (RC) All New Materials Made In China.''
   Approximately 2,866 of the stuffed animals were distributed
nationwide from December 1988 through June 1989, the CSPC said.
   The names of the animals, their model numbers and the song
played by the music box are:
   _White Jointed Bear, 55-0046, ``You Are My Sunshine.''
   _Beige Jointed Bear, 55-0061, ``Don't Let Me Go.''
   _Beige Small Jointed Bear, 55-0038, ``It's A Small World.''
   _Pink Bear, 55-0079, ``A Baby's Lullabye.''
   _Pink Monkey, 55-0095, ``Zip-a-dee-doo-daa.''
   _Beige Articulated Santa Bear, 55-0368.

<HEAD>Prison Population Grows 12 Percent in One Year</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The number of inmates in state and federal
prisons grew a record 12 percent last year to 703,687 prisoners,
according to a Justice Department study.
   The inmate population increased 76,099 last year from a 1988
prison population of 627,588 held in state and federal facilities,
said the study by the Bureau of Justice Statistics released Sunday.
   The nation's prison population has more than doubled in the last
decade, from 373,866 inmates in 1980 to 703,687 last year, said the
study.
   Only three states _ Kansas, North Dakota and Alaska _ reported
decreases in prison populations last year. The biggest proportional
increase occurred in Rhode Island, where the number of inmates
jumped 30.1 percent, followed by Colorado, with a 26.9 percent
increase.
   South Dakota had the third highest percentage increase _ 25.2
percent _ and Utah ranked fourth with a 21.3 percent jump.

<HEAD>New Indian Museum Director Hopes To Change Native American Image</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Museum of the American Indian
will be a new type of institution that forever alters the image of
native Americans, according to the New Mexico lawyer selected as
the museum's first director.
   ``My highest aspiration for the National Museum of the American
Indian is that it will reanalyze, redirect and, in many cases,
reformulate entirely the concepts and presentations of the past
concerning Indian culture,'' W. Richard West Jr. said Monday.
   West, of Albuquerque, N.M., and a member of the Cheyenne-Arapaho
tribes, becomes the museum's director effective June 1, the
Smithsonian Institution announced at a news conference Monday.
   West outlined his vision for the museum as a multi-cultural
facility that will reach out, without paternalism or condescension,
to native Americans throughout the hemisphere.
   West, 47, a partner and president of the Indian-owned law firm
of Gover, Steton, Williams &amp; West, has no direct experience running
museums. However, a news release from the Smithsonian stressed his
administrative and fund-raising abilities, and noted he was a
founding member of the Smithsonian's Cultural Education Committee.
   West is also the son of American Indian artist Walter Richard
West Sr. and from 1975 to 1980, was coordinator and treasurer of
the Native American Council of Regents of the Institute of American
Indian Arts in Santa Fe, N.M.

<HEAD>Government Approves Bacteria Treatment for Bladder Cancer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration has approved
use of a live but weakened bacteria to treat a type of bladder
cancer.
   The product, Bacillus Calmette Guerin Live, or BCG Live, was
approved Monday to treat bladder cancer referred to as ``carcinoma
in situ.'' This type constitutes 20 percent to 30 percent of the
45,000 cases of bladder cancer detected in the United States each
year, the FDA said.
   The treatment calls for the bacteria to be administered directly
to the bladder through a catheter to attack the cancer cells on the
lining of the organ. The inflammation that results eliminates many
of the cancer cells.
   Studies sponsored by the National Cancer Institute found that 74
percent of patients with carcinoma in situ of the bladder responded
to BCG treatment. Of those, the median time for recurrence of the
cancer was four years, the FDA said.
   The product is made by Connaught Laboratories Ltd. of
Willowdale, Ontario, Canada. It will be marketed under the trade
name Theracys.

   New York has won back next year's Grammy Awards
from Los Angeles and plans four days of musical events surrounding
the ceremony in February at Radio City Music Hall.
   ``You can be sure that we will roll out the red carpet, sound
the trumpets and have the bands playing to welcome each and every

   ``New York City certainly knows how to put on a party,'' he said.
   The Grammys honor the top performers in the recording field.
   Los Angeles, which played host to the awards this year, was
competing with New York for the 33rd annual ceremony, which Dinkins
estimated will give a $30 million boost to New York's economy.
   Michael Greene, president of the National Academy of Recording

``feels like the place you would like to award excellence.''

   Hundreds of radical students yelling
``Drive out Yankees!'' clashed with police today at two
universities in the southern city of Kwangju.
   Police in Kwangju also fired tear gas to disperse dozens of
students who burned a U.S. flag.
   In Seoul, radicals vowed to stage a week of anti-American
protests, and eight militant students were arrested after unfurling
an anti-American banner in front of the U.S. Embassy.
   In another development, union workers at Hyundai Motor Co.
rejected a proposed new labor contract today, dashing hopes for a
quick end to a 7-day-old strike at South Korea's largest automaker.
   Recent labor unrest has compounded the troubles of President Roh
Tae-woo's government, which has been beset by violent protests by
radical students.
   At Kwangju's Chonnam University, about 500 students hurled rocks
and firebombs at riot police, who responded by firing hundreds of
volleys of tear gas during a two-hour clash. About 800 students at
Chosun University lobbed rocks and firebombs as they fought police
for hours on streets outside the campus.
   There were no immediate reports of injuries. Since Friday,
Kwangju has been the scene of repeated clashes marking the 10th
anniversary of a pro-democracy uprising that was brutally
suppressed by troops.
   In Seoul, meanwhile, about 100 students attacked a police
substation in the southern part of the capital with firebombs
today, the South Korean news agency Yonhap reported. The police
drove them off by firing blanks from automatic weapons.
   The National Council of Student Representatives sent the eight
students to the U.S. Embassy to deliver a letter demanding that
Washington apologize for allegedly condoning the military crackdown
on the 1980 Kwangju uprising. The United States has repeatedly
denied the allegations.
   By official count, 200 citizens were killed and at least 1,700
wounded in the 10-day uprising. Many Kwangju residents claim the
toll was higher.
   After unfurling their banner, which also demanded a U.S.
apology, the students scuffled with Korean riot police on guard
outside the embassy and were taken away.
   Radical student leaders vowed at a news conference at Seoul's
Hanyang University that they would stage anti-American protests
until May 27. The student leaders said their open letter to the
U.S. Embassy also demanded that the United States withdraw the
43,000 U.S. troops stationed in South Korea and stop pressuring
Seoul to open its markets to American imports.
   National police ordered increased security at the embassy and
other U.S. facilities.
   Radical students also said today they would stage protests while
Roh is visiting Japan later this week.
   Roh's government has been holding talks with Japan over the
wording of an apology it wants for Japan's treatment of Koreans
during its colonial rule.
   The students said Roh should stop begging for an apology, and
that his visit would deepen South Korea's economic dependence on
Japan.
   In a separate protest, about 100 elderly Koreans tried to push
their way through riot police guarding the Japanese Embassy in
Seoul to press demands that Japan apologize and fully compensate
for its actions during its 1910-1945 colonial rule.
   Elderly Koreans have staged daily protests near the embassy for
the last week, asking Roh to cancel his visit, scheduled Thursday
through Saturday.

   Armed worshipers clashed at a
church service, stabbing one priest to death and wounding a second,
a report said today.
   The independent South African Press Association said Rev. Tommy
Velebhayi, 48, was killed Sunday at the Apostolic Church of Africa
in Zwelitsha. Zwelitsha is in Siskei homeland, on the South
Africa's southeastern coast.
   A second priest, the Rev. L. Nkcanka, was seriously wounded in
the fight, the news agency said. Police said they arrested two
people.
   The clash erupted when worshipers from one group tried to stop a
rival group led by Velebhayi from entering the church, the report
said.
   The news agency said the congregation had been split for about a
month over a leadership disagreement. It said one faction was
trying to break away and form a new church.

<HEAD>U.S. Ambassador to Italy Says Controversy is Behind Him</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LISA PERLMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Before his confirmation as U.S.
ambassador to Italy last year, Peter Secchia's penchant for crude
language earned him the nickname ``ambassador of dirty words'' in
Italian newspapers.
   Now, they're calling him ``Cousin Pete.''
   Secchia returned to his Grand Rapids home over the weekend with
about 20 Italian business leaders for a four-day conference aimed
at forging business partnerships between Michigan and Italy.
   Among the remarks for which Secchia was criticized: His August
1988 comment that he knows ``what sodomy is because that's what
Democrats are always doing to me.''
   On Monday, he recalled in a speech to about 600 members of the
Economic Club of Grand Rapids the monthlong holdup in the U.S.
Senate's confirmation of his appointment.
   ``One year ago today, our president went to Rome on an
unofficial visit without me,'' he said. ``It hurt and it hurt
deeply.''
   But Secchia gave himself high marks for his work in Italy so
far, saying in an interview after his speech that he ``was amazed
at how fast (the controversy) went away. ...
   ``A few cuss words here, a few gestures there, in Italy, they
don't care. I imagine I benefited from that philosophy.''
   Secchia, 53, said he has devoted much of his time in Italy to
promoting U.S. business interests. He encouraged local business
leaders to explore potential partnerships in Europe.
   ``Italy isn't only gondolas and pizza, Roman ruins, leaning
towers, music and wine. Italians are masters at applied technology
and traditional industries,'' the former businessman said. ``Europe
is our future market and Italians should be our business partners.''
   Secchia also encouraged business leaders to learn the languages
and cultures of the countries with which they would like to explore
partnerships.
   He said he has had some problems himself in learning to speak
Italian.
   ``I'm having trouble with the verbs and prepositions _ just like
I did in English,'' he joked. ``But they haven't taught me any cuss
words.''

<HEAD>Switch in Names Sought in Dispute over Birthplace of Hamburger</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Residents who maintain that their Wisconsin
community is the hamburger's birthplace are asking Hamburg, N.Y.,
to change names with their town.
   ``We just think it's appropriate that we become Hamburg,'' said
Tom Duffey, honorary burgermeister of Seymour.
   Duffey and his Home of the Hamburger Inc. organization contend
the first hamburger was developed at a local fair in 1885.
   He said Hamburg should accept the name change because he
contends their claim to being the hamburger's birthplace is false.
He said switching the name to Seymour would be fitting because a
former New York governor was named Horatio Seymour.
   Home of the Hamburger Inc. grilled a 5,250-pound hamburger last
year as part of its effort to promote the claim of Seymour, about
10 miles west of Green Bay.
   Hamburg Mayor Richard Hansen said he had not seen the letter
from Duffey requesting the move, but would not agree to a change in
names.
   ``We believe very strongly that we're the home of the
hamburger,'' he said. ``We take great pride in that. I don't care
what Seymour has to say.''

   North and South Yemen merged their
impoverished nations of tribespeople into a unified Republic of
Yemen today, and the new country stood on the brink of oil wealth.
   Gen Ali Abdullah Saleh, president of the unified state, raised
the new country's red, white and black flag atop the portside
presidential council building.
   The Aden Coast Guard fired several cannon shots, and ships
hooted their horns as the flag went up.
   The united Republic of Yemen has newly discovered oil field
reserves estimated unofficially at 2 billion barrels.
   At a later rally, attended by 2,000 people, Saleh said the
united nation would remain committed to all treaties that either of
the Yemens had concluded.
   ``The Republic of Yemen will be a factor for stability and
security in the Arabian Peninsula and the Gulf region and a strong
bastion for the Arab nations, the Arab League and joint Arab
action,'' he said.
   Saleh said Yemen would work for development and progress,
pledged to ``an opening up, economically, culturally and socially
... in line with the spirit of the age,'' Saleh said.
   Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat was the
only Arab leader to attend the ceremony in Aden.
   The 48-year-old Saleh, president of North Yemen since 1978, was
elected to head the five-man council that will rule the new state
at a meeting of senior leaders from the two Yemens held before the
flag-raising ceremony.
   Ali Salem al-Beidh, secretary-general of South Yemen's ruling
Yemen Socialist Party, was elected vice-president.
   The council named Heider al-Attas, the president of formerly
Marxist South Yemen, prime minister and asked him to form a Cabinet.
   On Monday, North Yemen's pro-Western Parliament approved a plan
by Saleh to merge with Socialist South Yemen.
   North Yemen radio reports said the 159-member Shura Council, or
parliament, had ``agreed with a sweeping majority'' to merge the
Yemens, which are among the world's least developed states. San`a,
the North Yemeni capital, is to serve as capital of the newly named
Yemen Republic.
   South Yemen's parliament, the Supreme People's Council, also
held a special session Monday to approve unification of the two Red
Sea nations.
   It was the second such union between two Arab states in this
century. In the 1950s, Egypt and Syria joined as the United Arab
Republic, but the merger collapsed after three years because of
internal squabbling.
   The new state binds 11 million people _ 9 million from the north
and 2 million from the south.
   South Yemen became the Arab world's only avowedly Marxist state
after it gained independence from Britain in 1971. But it began to
reform as democratic changes swept through the Soviet Union and
Eastern Europe.
   The two Yemens are poor and undeveloped; labor unrest in South
Yemen has been aggravated in recent months as Western goods were
transported from North Yemen to the south.
   Strikes mushroomed in most government offices and factories in
South Yemen.
   The merger bid has been outwardly promoted by oil-rich nations
on the Arabian Peninsula such as Saudi Arabia, which is eager to
snuff out Soviet influence.
   Scores of Cuban and East German military experts are said to
have left Aden, the capital of South Yemen, in recent months. A
friendship pact entitles the Soviets to maintain as many as 18,000
troops in the port city, but the extent of their deployment is
unknown.
   The merger was originally planned for Nov. 30. But in recent
days there had been pressure to speed up the schedule so the two
Yemens can attend an emergency Arab summit on May 28 in Baghdad,
Iraq, as one state.
   The new flag is similar to the black, white and red one of North
Yemen, but without the stars.
   A draft agreement on unification was agreed to by leaders of
both nations on April 22 in the city of Taiz, halfway between Aden
and North Yemen's capital of San`a.
   A planned transition period of 2{ years coincides with the
remainder of the five-year terms for both legislatures.

<HEAD>Deng Says Students Not Entirely to Blame For Pro-Democracy
Protests</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senior leader Deng Xiaoping blamed poor party
leadership as the root cause for last year's pro-democracy
demonstrations, West German sources said today.
   The new Communist Party chief, Jiang Zemin, says he cannot rule
out more such demonstrations this year, the sources said, speaking
on condition of anonymity.
   The comments came in talks with Monday with former West German
Chancellor Helmut Schmidt, they said.
   The sources said Deng and Jiang took a generally conciliatory
stance toward students who took part in the pro-democracy
demonstrations, which were crushed by the military in June.
   Deng, China's 85-year-old patriarch, said poor party leadership
was the root cause of the popular drive for democratic reform.
Then-party chief Zhao Ziyang, Deng's protege, was purged in June
for being sympathetic to the student movement. Since then, many of
Zhao's followers have been jailed or lost their jobs in a sweep
against the ideologically suspect.
   Schmidt told Deng that China suffered a serious loss of prestige
when the military killed hundreds, perhaps thousands, in ending the
democracy movement, and that the West had no other choice but to
downgrade relations with China.
   The sources said Jiang told Schmidt the possibility of new
demonstrations could not be excluded. He said ``hostile forces''
are trying to make use of anniversaries of events during the
demonstrations last May and June.
   Jiang said China has built up its riot police, which is now
better-equipped with non-lethal weapons.
   Luo Gan, secretary-general of the State Council, also told
Schmidt that only police forces, not the military, would be used to
put down any future political unrest.
   The sources also disclosed Schmidt had recently exchanged
letters with Zhao, who has not been seen since an emotional meeting
with student hunger strikers on Tiananmen Square on May 19, 1989.
He is being held under virtual house arrest in Beijing.
   The contents of the exchange were not disclosed, but it was the
first known incident of Zhao being able to communicate with the
outside world.
   Deng's meeting with Schmidt was not mentioned by the Chinese
press today, although the Jiang-Schmidt talks were reported on the
front page of the party's official People's Daily.
   Deng retired from his last official post, as head of the state
Central Military Commission, in March, and the absence of press
coverage of the Schmidt meeting and a meeting on May 13 with
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak are an apparent attempt to
emphasize he is now a private citizen.
   Deng, however, is still regarded as China's most powerful man,
with final say over major policy decisions.
   The sources quoted Schmidt as saying Deng, who is frequently
rumored to be seriously ill, appeared to be in better health than
at their last meeting two years ago.
   Also today, a Chinese provincial newspaper's editor and
Communist Party secretary, now in the United States, has been
expelled from the party for ideological mistakes, his former paper
reported Tuesday.
   The expulsion of Cheng Kai, former editor of the Hainan Daily,
was the latest in a series of expulsions of reformists from party
ranks since the student pro-democracy movement last year.
   The Hainan Daily's brief, front-page report on Cheng did not
explain what ideological mistakes he made.

<TEXT>
   A pilot trying to become the first
aviator to fly around the world in a float plane got tangled in
some Soviet red tape on the second day of his voyage.
   Tom Casey, 53, began the trip from his hometown of Seattle and
reached Anchorage Monday, but he still hadn't received permission
to fly over the Soviet Union.
   He won't leave for his next stop in Nome until he gets the
go-ahead from Soviet authorities, he said.
   ``There seems to be some kind of problem _ I'm not sure what _
and I hope it's not going to be long,'' Casey said. ``They said it
had to do with technical difficulties with the airplane.''
   Casey is flying a single-engine Cessna equipped with pontoons
that allow it to take off and land only on water.
   Casey had submitted a flight plan to Soviet officials ``from
Nome to wherever they'd like me to go. I told them I wanted to go
from Nome, Alaska to Helsinki.''
   He suggested a route consisting of 500-mile legs between places
where he can land his plane called ``Liberty II,'' on water near an
airport.
   The voyage is timed to get Casey back to Seattle in time for the
opening ceremonies of the Goodwill Games on July 21. His departure
from Seattle on Sunday marked the 63rd anniversary of the beginning
of Charles A. Lindbergh's first solo trans-Atlantic flight.
   Casey's proposed 27,000-mile route roughly retraces the 1924
path of the first globe-circling flight by a pair of Douglas World
Cruisers, Casey said.
   ``I'm working out an alternate plan right now, through the
Aleutian chain through Attu, towards Japan. But I still need one
stop in the Soviet Union, in the Kuril Islands,'' he said.
   Casey and his project coordinator in Seattle, Dan Hood, planned
to contact Soviet air traffic officials today.
   His flight so far through Alaska, Casey said, was ``the way it's
always been _ beautiful.''
   He said he spent years flying in Alaska as a bush pilot.
   ``One main reason I'm doing this is I'm trying to promote the
safety and versatility of general aviation, especially in the Lower
48,'' he said.
   ``The only place that's left doing what aviation was originally
designed for is Alaska. Up here, flying is almost like driving a
car. You don't get all the problems that make flying difficult in
the rest of the United States. Up here it's survival. It should be
shown it's a very, very safe form of transportation.''

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Max Wall, whose stage talents took him from music
hall comedy in the plays of Samuel Beckett to acclaim as a serious
actor, died today after a fall. He was 82.
   Wall fell at Simpson's Restaurant in central London Monday
afternoon, said his agent, Joan Prichard. He never regained
consciousness and died early this morning at Westminster Hospital
from a fractured skull.
   He became famous for his ``Professor Wallofsky'' character, a
double-jointed eccentric whose bizarre walk was said to have
inspired John Cleese of the Monty Python Flying Circus, the comedy
troupe.
   Wall was born Maxwell George Lorimer in south London on March
12, 1908 into a family of entertainers, and made his first stage
appearance as a baby in a kilt. At 14 he played Jack in Mother
Goose, with a traveling pantomime, and in 1925 he landed his first
London stage role, as a dancer.
   After appearing on Broadway in 1932, in Earl Carroll's Vanities,
he brought his madcap humor and dancing skills to many musicals and
stage comedies in Britain. He made his first radio show in 1940.
   Wall's career went into decline after the breakup of his first
marriage, and he was reduced to working obscure north England
nightclubs. He married and divorced twice more. His fortune
dwindled to bankruptcy.
   But his career was resurrected when his comic talents and clown
face, having reputedly attracted the attention of Beckett, landed
him parts in the Irish playwright's ``Waiting for Godot,'' and
``Krapp's Last Tape.''
   Wall played an unforgettable Archie Rice in a 1974 revival of
John Osborne's ``The Entertainer,'' a role already immortalized by
Laurence Olivier.
   Despite bouts of sciatica, Wall continued acting into his late
70s, including a role in John Arden's ``Sergeant Musgrave's Dance.''
   He took occasional film parts, including the sinister Jeremiah
Flintwich in the 1987 version of ``Little Dorrit.''
   Wall and his first wife, Marion Pola, had five children.

   The carcasses of 16 wild elephants
killed by gunfire were found in a sanctuary in eastern Sri Lanka,
the government said today, and it blamed Tamil rebels for the
killings.
   The dead elephants were found in the first two weeks of May in
Kumana jungle, a wildlife and bird sanctuary 130 miles east of
Colombo.
   The eastern and northern regions of Sri Lanka, where most of the
minority Tamil population lives, have been under the virtual
control of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam rebel group since
March.
   A statement by the Information Department said the Tamil Tigers
were illegally chopping down trees, killing deer and wild buffaloes
and setting up an explosives factory in Kumana.
   It said the elephant killings were under investigation but that
the slaughter was ``probably an act done by the Liberation Tigers
of Tamil Eelam to protect the laborers cutting trees.''
   A rebel spokesman denied the allegation, saying it was made to
``tar our image.'' He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Hunting wildlife in Sri Lanka is banned, and killing elephants
can carry long prison sentences.
   The Kumana killings, the single largest slaughter of elephants
in the island in recent years, has caused an uproar among
conservationists and lawmakers.
   Sri Lanka's population of wild elephants has declined from 7,000
a decade ago to 2,000.
   The rebels moved into eastern and northern Sri Lanka after
forcing the evacuation of Indian peacekeeping troops who arrived in
1987 under an India-Sri Lanka accord, intending to disarm the Tamil
Tigers and smaller secessionist groups.
   The Tamil Tigers refused to disarm, however, and the Sri Lankan
government eventually demanded that the Indian troops withdraw.
   The rebels began their independence campaign in 1983.
   The Tamils accuse the Sinhalese majority of discriminating in
jobs, education and the use of Sinhala language. At least 11,000
people, including 1,100 Indian soldiers, have been killed in the
rebellion.
   Tamils make up 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million people.
Sinhalese comprise 75 percent and control the government and the
military.

<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II has called a three-day
meeting next month to help prepare for an unprecedented
European-wide gathering of Roman Catholic bishops, the Vatican said
today.
   The Vatican said the June 5-7 gathering would be to lay the
groundwork for next year's synod, which is aimed at spreading the
church's message across the continent.
   The pope announced plans for the European synod, or meeting of
bishops, when he visited Czechoslovakia last month in his first
papal trip to Eastern Europe outside his native Poland.
   The pope's visit to Prague was to underscore Vatican support for
the emerging democracies of Eastern Europe, once dominated by
communism.
   Today's brief announcement of the June preparatory meeting said
invitations were made to the heads of Europe's national bishops
conferences, bishops representing dioceses outside the conferences,
Vatican officials and several Eastern Rite representatives.
   No exact date or site has been announced for the synod, though
such gatherings are traditionally held at the Vatican.
   Shortly after the pope's return from Czechoslovakia, a senior
Vatican official said he hoped prelates from all regions of Europe,
including the Soviet Ukraine and Albania, will be able to
participate in the synod next year.
   The Ukraine Catholic church, suppressed under Josef Stalin, is
still not legal in the Soviet Union. In Albania, all religion has
been outlawed.

<HEAD>Idaho Primary To Nominate Hopefuls for U.S. Senate, Governor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>

   Idaho's attorney general hoped to garner votes in the southern
and eastern parts of the state today in his underdog effort to win
the Republican U.S. Senate nomination over a veteran congressman.
   The three-way Republican race for the right to a long-shot bid
at stopping Democratic Gov. Cecil Andrus from claiming an
unprecedented fourth term seemed to have narrowed to state Sen.
Rachel Gilbert and former Majority Leader Roger Fairchild.
   Late campaign polls showed a large share of GOP primary voters
still undecided. And stockbroker Milton Erhart, the only
gubernatorial candidate with an abortion-rights position, needed a
heavy turnout fueled by abortion backers to have any chance of
overcoming limited statewide name recognition.
   Attorney General Jim Jones, who spent only a few thousand
dollars in radio commercials, said: ``I think a small to average
turnout would be helpful to me. A larger turnout would be a
response to a mass-media campaign like (U.S. Rep. Larry) Craig has
conducted.''
   State election officials predicted an average turnout for a
statewide primary of 30 percent to 35 percent.
   For his part, Craig, a solid favorite to succeed retiring
Republican Sen. James McClure, took nothing for granted. He greeted
voters in the Boise and Nampa-Caldwell areas before casting his own
vote later in the day.
   ``I think it will be a good win, a strong win,'' said the
five-term lawmaker, who hopes to become Idaho's third consecutive
1st District congressman to win a U.S. Senate seat.
   Craig benefited from the campaign organization that helped
McClure win three Senate terms.
   He outspent Jones 10-1, forcing his opponent to concede defeat
in the more Democratic 1st District of northern and western Idaho
and concentrate on the conservative southern and eastern 2nd
District where Craig had never run before.
   Boise businessman Ron Twilegar, the former state Senate
Democratic leader, was the heavy favorite to win his party's
nomination over political newcomer David Steed.
   In the campaign's final weeks, Steed has forced Twilegar to
defend himself against charges of financial impropriety in a
federally backed venture capital company he ran.
   The Senate seat, one of just three nationwide this year in which
no incumbent is running, has been held by Republicans for all but
eight years this century.

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nelson Mandela today called
the police killing of seven blacks a ``massacre'' and warned that
efforts to end apartheid will collapse unless the government ends
violence by the security forces.
   The African National Congress leader's comments came two days
after police opened fire on protesters at Welkom in the Orange Free
State. He said Sunday's killings cast doubt on the white
government's commitment to its promises of major reform.
   ``The government must not talk of negotiations and peace and
expect us to join in. The massacre of innocent people is
inexcusable,'' Mandela said on his return from a visit to Zimbabwe.
   Police commanders said Welkom was tense but quiet today as armed
police patrolled the area.
   Welkom has been the scene of several bloody confrontations
between blacks and right-wing whites opposed to government plans to
abolish apartheid and end white-minority rule. Extremists have
formed paramilitary ``white defense'' groups in the area.
   Police said they were forced to open fire Sunday when hundreds
of black protesters attempted to march from Welkom's black township
to the white town.
   Mandela said the government must curb the security forces and
end a growing wave of violence that has claimed hundreds of lives
in recent months.
   ``The responsibility to end violence is that of the
government,'' he said.
   The ANC and the government of President F.W. de Klerk are
engaged in talks on ending white-minority rule and sharing
political power with South Africa's black majority. Mandela
threatened to call off the talks when police killed black
protesters in March, but he later relented.
   Meanwhile, another black leader, Mangosuthu Buthelezi, urged
Mandela today to meet with him to find ways to end violence in
Natal Province, where several thousand blacks have died in fighting
between Buthelezi's Inkatha group and ANC-backed groups.
   ``I can think of no two leaders who could make a greater impact
in standing together to shame violence than Mr. Mandela and
myself,'' Buthelezi said.
   A previous plan for talks in March between Buthelezi and Mandela
collapsed after protests by some ANC leaders who did not want any
dealings with Inkatha.
   The ANC and Inkatha have a number of leadership and political
differences. Inkatha favors a more conservative plan for South
Africa after white-minority rule ends.

   Yasser Arafat, chairman of the Palestine
Liberation Organization, is seeking permission to attend an
emergency U.N. Security Council session in New York, but U.S.
officials said today no decision has been made on granting him a
visa.
   Arafat made an indirect request for an entry visa in a letter to
U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar, expecting it would
be passed on to the State Department, which denied him a visa two
years ago for a similar Mideast debate.
   U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said no
decision had been made. They said the situation is ``hypothetical''
because he has not made a formal request. It could remain so if the
State Department passes word back to the PLO that the visa request
would be denied.
   Arafat, speaking Monday in Baghdad, Iraq, appealed to President
Bush to pressure Israel to stop what the PLO chairman described as
``atrocities'' against Palestinians.
   Arafat rejected Israeli claims that the lone Israeli gunman who
shot and killed seven Palestinian workers near Tel Aviv Sunday was
mentally unbalanced. He accused Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of
planning ``a criminal scheme against the Palestinians and the
intefadeh.''
   Intefadeh is the Arab name for the revolt against Israel's
control of the West Bank and Gaza, which were surrendered by Jordan
and Egypt in their war against Israel in 1967.
   ``We appeal to President Bush this time not to let the
Palestinian people down and to refrain from protecting the Israeli
crimes,'' Arafat said at a news conference.
   Arafat asked the United States not to use its veto to kill
whatever resolution condmening Israel migh be adopted by the
Security Council at the request of the PLO.
   If Arafat is allowed to attend the U.N. session in New York, it
would elevate the PLO's stature at a time when Israel is under
pressure for using force to try to stem a violent uprising by
Palestinian Arabs on the West Bank and in Gaza.
   When the Reagan administration declined to permit Arafat to
attend a U.N. General Assembly session in November 1988, the debate
was shifted to Geneva. A month later, in a reversal of policy, the
administration opened talks with the PLO.
   Arafat, acceding to U.S. instructions, had by then publicly
renounced terrorism and said he recognized Israel's right to exist.
However, the PLO covenant still calls for dismantling the Jewish
state.
   If the visa is granted, Arafat would have an opportunity to take
charge of PLO demands that the Security Council condemn Israel for
its treatment of Palestinian Arabs.
   The State Department in March reported to Congress that the PLO
was adhering to its commitment renouncing terrorism. Nearly 30
border and rocket attacks were launched by Palestinian groups
against Israel since December 1988. But, the report said, ``we have
no evidence in those cases or any others that the actions were
authorized or approved by the PLO Executive Committee or by Arafat
personnaly.''
   In denying the PLO's application for a visa in 1988,
then-Secreretary of State George P. Shultz said ``the U.S.
government has convincing evidence that PLO elements have engaged
in terrorism against Americans and other targets.''
   Shultz said then that Arafat ``knows of, condones and lends
support to such acts'' and is ``an accessory to such terrorism.''
   A month later, Schultz took the lead in opening U.S. talks with
the PLO, which are continuing in Tunis, the PLO headquarters.

<TEXT>
   NATO defense ministers met today to
take a hard look at the military strategy that guided the Western
alliance during the Cold War years but now may be outdated.
   The North Atlantic Treaty Organization's key two-day meeting was
to review what U.S. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney called ``new ways
of doing business'' in an era of reduced East-West tensions.
   On Monday, West European defense ministers, meeting separately
at the alliance headquarters in Brussels, urged NATO to ``adapt to
the changing security environment.''
   The ministers said it was ``of crucial importance'' to decide
what level of defense was needed in a changing world.
   ``We consider that discussion in the alliance on these issues is
timely,'' the ministers said in a statement at the end of their
talks.
   They also said West European countries must prepare to pay more
in common defense costs as the United States moves to substantially
reduce its military presence in Europe.
   As an example of new NATO strategy in response to the impending
unification of Germany, Cheney raised the idea of a NATO corps with
divisions from different nations.
   Such a force would also ``emphasize the fact that (Germany) is
not treated any differently than anyone else,'' he told reporters
aboard his flight to Brussels.
   ``If all present, positive trends continue ... then we can
contemplate new ways of doing business,'' Cheney said.
   Less than two weeks ago, the NATO defense ministers held a
meeting of the alliance's Nuclear Planning Group in Kananaskis,
Canada, and agreed that there was a ``diminishing need'' for
battlefield nuclear weapons in Europe.
   Their current meeting, this time as the Defense Planning
Committee, is part of a series of discussions among high-level NATO
officials that will culminate in an early July summit between
President Bush and the other alliance leaders.
   NATO is under pressure to move toward a political, rather than a
military, role in an era of reduced East-West tensions.
   ``I think everybody accepts that business as usual is not
possible,'' said a NATO diplomat, discussing the meeting on
condition of anonymity.
   The defense officials were expected to take a look at the actual
threat now posed by the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact; the status of
conventional arms reduction negotiations in Vienna, Austria;
shrinking military budgets, and the increased use of multinational
forces.
   They also will likely discuss their strategy of forward defense,
brought into question by the prospect of a united Germany.
   Forward defense refers to the stationing of troops to defend the
front line during an attack. The idea is to defend territory at its
border and not give up any land to invading soldiers. The border
between East and West Germany, soon to be erased, is now considered
part of the front line.
   The ministers will likely call for studies of some of these
issues as they review their future strategy.
   ``There are many things which have been done for 40 years in a
certain way which need to be revisited,'' said the NATO diplomat.
   The ministers were considered certain to scrap a guideline, in
effect since the late 1970s, that called for increasing military
spending by 3 percent annually.
   Many countries have failed to meet that goal in recent years.
With easing tensions, even fewer will hit the target now. Some
countries, like Greece and Turkey, may keep spending up because of
regional problems rather than fears of Soviet aggression.
   The ministers also will be asked to endorse defense plans based
on an assessment of the current military threat posed by the Soviet
Union, said a senior NATO official, also on condition of anonymity.
   He said the alliance needs to adopt ``a degree of prudence''
because of the uncertainty of the political upheaval in the East
bloc. But he said it also needs to be flexible to respond to future
changes.
   All 16 NATO nations except France are represented at the
meeting. France is not a member of the alliance's integrated
military structure. Iceland, which has no armed forces, attends as
an observer.

<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Nearly 2 million workers nationwide staged
a 24-hour strike today to protest government economic austerity
measures, shutting down transportation and businesses.
   Rallies were held throughout the country to denounce price
increases and the abolition of inflation-linked wage increases for
civil servants, measures that were adopted after Premier
Constantine Mitsotakis took office in April 8.
   It was the second general strike this year, and labor officials
said there could be more.
   Athens International Airport, the main gateway to Greece, was
brought to a standstill when control tower and airline employees
stayed off the job from 7:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. Only airlines with
their own ground crews in Athens resumed flights after the air
traffic controllers returned to work.
   Public transportation in major cities, banks and many businesses
were closed down. Ferry service to the nearby islands was disrupted
and Piraeus, the nation's key port, offered limited services.
   The strike was called by the General Confederation of Greek
Workers, the civil servants union, ADEDY, and smaler labor groups
across the country. The organizations claim a combined membership
of 1.85 million workers.
   ``The strike was a great success,'' Dimitris Hadzisokratis, a
member of the workers confederation, said in a telephone interview.
``We are totally satisfied.''
   He said, however, that talks today with National Economy
Minister George Souflias had been disappointing.
   ``The minister said that the government was not prepared to
negotiate. ... More labor action will follow,'' he said.
   Labor Minister Aristides Kalatzakos said the strike would only
hurt Greece's economy.
   ``With today's strike ... it is estimated that 16 million hours
of precious work time, and over 14 billion drachmas ($86 million)
are being sacrificed in the general attempt to overturn the
government's economic policy,'' he said in a radio interview.
   Greece faces 20 percent inflation this year and a $2 billion
budget deficit. Some economists say the deficit could reach $4
billion and prompt the International Monetary Fund to step in and
force the country to take tougher measures.
   Premier Mitsotakis, who was elected April 8, has been visiting
European capitals to win support and investments for Greece's
recovery. He has said he would rather fall from office than tone
down the austerity measures.
   Trade unions, spurred by gains during the eight-year socialist
government that ended last June, say the austerity measures have
seriously hurt the average worker's buying power.
   The measures include large increases in the basic costs of
services and goods, ranging from 20 percent for bus fares to 300
percent for water.
   ``We do not care whether the government remains in power or
falls,'' the secretary general of the worker's conference, Dimitris
Kostopoulos, told a rally in Athens.
   ``Our concern is that the workers do not fall victim to capital
and also that the law of the jungle does not prevail,'' he said.
   The last general strike was staged in January to pressure the
coalition government in power at the time to uphold a promise that
living standards would not be affected by austerity measures at the
time. Those measures proved ineffective, however, and the economy
deteriorated further.

<TEXT>
   A packet marked ``nuclear triggers'' sent to the
Iraqi Embassy contained harmless electronic components used in home
appliances, the Foreign Office said today.
   Iraqi diplomats said the packet, received in the embassy mail
last week, was ``another campaign'' against their country and an
attempt to strain British-Iraqi relations.
   But the Foreign Office said the episode appeared to be ``the
work of a hoaxer.''
   ``These devices are widely available in hardware shops and have
a range of domestic appliance use,'' a spokesman said on condition
of anonymity. ``They would not require an export license and do not
have a nuclear weapons application.''
   The spokesman said the Iraqis had not handed over the envelope
in which they said the devices arrived and it was impossible to
trace where the letter was mailed.
   The Foreign Office had the 28 small devices examined by Defense
Ministry experts after the Iraqis handed them in.
   In March, British authorities working with the United States
seized a consignment of U.S.-made capacitors at Heathrow Airport.
U.S. prosecutors said the devices were powerful capacitors for
detonating nuclear warheads.
   Iraq maintained they were destined for use on a non-nuclear
university laser project.
   Britain subsequently expelled Iraqi Airways executive Omar
Latif, arrested in connection with an alleged plot to smuggle the
nuclear triggering devices.

<TEXT>
   Three teen-agers appeared in court here
today for painting anti-Semitic graffiti on the walls of a Jewish
cemetery in this community in eastern France.
   Two were paroled by the juvenile court after being formally
charged with vandalism and racial injury, and the third was freed.
The two charged were told not to meet withone another or carry
weapons.
   The youths, who reportedly told police that they were inspired
by hatred for ``foreigners,'' were accused of painting ``Long live
Hitler and Dachau'' on the walls of a Jewish cemetery on May 4.
   That was a week before mourners discovered that 34 graves had
been defiled and a corpse mutilated at the Jewish cemetery at
Carpentras in southern France.
   The Carpentras incident outraged France and set off nationwide
demonstrations against a perceived rise in racism and anti-Semitism.
   There has been a wave of incidents involving desecration of
Jewish cemeteries or synagogues in other countries as well. In
Hungary, the daily newspaper Nepszabadsag reported today that 14
tombstones were damaged at a small Jewish cemetery in the town of
Sopron, 150 miles from Budapest.
   Interior Minister Pierre Joxe and other politicians have accused
Jean-Marie Le Pen, leader of the far-right National Front, of
creating an ``atmosphere of racial hatred'' that set the stage for
the Carpentras desecration.
   Le Pen, in an interview today with the daily newspaper Le
Quotidien de Paris, termed Joxe's behavior ``Stalinist,'' saying
the minister was accusing him of crimes without conducting an
investigation.
   Le Pen also responded angrily to a decision by authorities in
his hometown of Trinite-sur-Mer, who decided Monday not to allow
him to host a meeting of extreme-right European leaders there next
month.
   Municipal councillors in the Atlantic coast town of 56,000
people said they were tired of being associated with Le Pen.
   ``This decision, made under pressure from the media and
political parties, runs contrary to the fundamental principle of
free assembly guaranteed by our constitution,'' Le Pen said today
in a communique.
   Meanwhile, the weekly newsmagazine Le Meilleur posted a $43,000
reward for information leading to the arrest of whose who
desecrated the cemetery at Carpentras.
   ``When honor and justice demand, it's normal to use all means to
bring out the truth,'' said the magazine's editor, Alain Ayache.
   Police arrested six skinheads in connection with the crime
shortly after the Carpentras desecration was discovered May 10, but
they were released soon afterward.
   In another incident, prosecutors in Strasbourg, 300 miles east
of Paris, ordered psychiatric care for two skinheads arrested
Sunday for painting anti-Semitic slogans on a synagogue.
   A police patrol came upon the two in the process of daubing the
slogans on the walls. A search of their residences turned up
neo-Nazi literature, knives, clubs and other weapons, police said.

   Two generals and 19 other officers
were arraigned today before a military court for their alleged
roles in last December's abortive coup attempt against President
Corazon Aquino.
   They were the first defendants to stand trial in the Dec. 1-9
uprising, the bloodiest attempt to oust Mrs. Aquino since she took
office in the 1986 ``people power revolution'' against the late
President Ferdinand Marcos.
   Also today, police defused powerful bombs outside the
headquarters of two banks in the financial district and officials
said the explosives, timed to explode during morning rush hour,
could have destroyed both buildings.
   Brig. Gen. Marino Filart, chief of the police Capital Command,
said the bombs could be part of an urban terror campaign to pave
the way for a new coup attempt against Mrs. Aquino. No group
claimed responsibility.
   Share prices tumbled 24.18 points today on The Manila Stock
Exchange because of fears of political instability and the
country's dim economic prospects.
   The defendants stood at attention as prosecutors read the
indictments, and the session then was adjourned until next Tuesday.
Defense lawyers had requested the time to allow their clients time
to study their pleas.
   Each officer was charged with 21 counts of murder and 51 counts
of frustrated murder, in addition to mutiny and rebellion.
   At least 113 people were killed and more than 600 others injured
during the coup attempt, the sixth bid to unseat Mrs. Aquino. More
than 2,200 of the estimated 3,000 mutineers are in military custory.
   If convicted on all charges, the officers face sentences of life
imprisonment.
   Defendants included Brig. Gen. Marcelo Blando, former commander
of the 7th Infantry Division, and Brig. Gen. Jose Commendador,
former chief of the 2nd Air Division of the Philippine air force.
   The other defendants were two navy captains, one colonel, seven
lieutenant colonels, three majors, five army captains and one air
force lieutenant.
   Meanwhile, the commander of U.S. forces in the Pacific said
today he is optimistic that U.S. and Philippine officials will
reach a new agreement on continuing American military presence in
the Philippines.
   Last Friday, American and Philippine negotiators agreed to
continue talks at an unspecified date on whether to renew a lease
that expires in September 1991 on Clark Air Base, Subic Bay naval
base and four smaller installations.
   Rafael Alunan, spokesman for the Philippine panel, said the next
round could begin in three to four weeks.
   ``I am very optimistic that we will reach an agreement with
continued presence in the Philippines,'' Adm. Huntington Hardisty
said.
   Opposition to the bases is growing because many Filipinos view
them as an infringement on national sovereignty. There are 40,000
U.S.troops, Defense Department civilians and military dependents
living in the Philippines.
   Philippine officials said today U.S. negotiators urged stepping
up patrols by Philippine troops outside the bases, after suspected
Communist rebels killed three Americans near the bases this month.
   Marine Gunnery Sgt. John Fredette was slain May 4 near Subic
naval base, and two American airmen were shot dead on May 13 near
Clark. Communist rebels took responsibility for the May 13 killing
but not for Fredette's murder.

<HEAD>Willie Nelson's Cowboy Channel Reflects Niche-Seeking in Cable TV</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC RICE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Willie Nelson, the scruffy king of country music,
is carrying a business card these days. And some who cherish his
outlaw image may cringe because it lists him as a corporate
chairman of the board.
   Nelson is heading up one of the latest entries in cable
television's entertainment channel boom. His station is the Cowboy
Channel and, yes, he really is chairman of the Cowboy Television
Network Inc.
   ``Chief cook and bottle washer,'' was how Nelson described his
duties during a brief interview Monday at the National Cable
Television Association's annual convention.
   Nelson was just one of several celebrity attractions at the
three-day convention. But unlike the athletes, movie stars and a
Playboy Playmate of the Year signing autographs for the crowd,
Nelson also was there on business.
   He's trying to drum up support among local cable systems for his
new network, which will feature cowboy movies and country music
when it begins telecasts in November.
   ``Traveling around the country and around the world, at 2
o'clock in the morning or 2 o'clock in the afternoon it's very
difficult to find what I like to see, which is a good Western movie
or some good music,'' Nelson said. ``That's exactly the reason I
got into this.''
   Like many cable TV newcomers, Nelson's channel probably won't
appeal to everyone, and that's no mistake.
   Cable is narrowing its target audiences with an abundance of
special interest stations, and that specialization will dictate how
cable is sold and delivered in the future, experts say.
   Cable always has been an outlet for specialized programming like
all-sports ESPN and all-news CNN, but newcomers are narrowing the
approach even more, with these new stations on display at the show:
   _ In Court Television, for legal junkies, offers live coverage
of noteworthy trials, from U.S. courtrooms as well as from abroad.
   _ The Golden American Network, ``for viewers that weren't born
yesterday,'' features entertainment for an older audience, with
such veteran stars as Steve Allen, Morey Amsterdam, Shirley Jones
and Monty Hall.
   _The Sci-Fi Channel will show science fiction and fantasy
programs.
   _ The Comedy Channel, launched in November, and its new
competitor HA! have non-stop comedy.
   ``The challenge is to find large enough niches,'' said John
Malone, president of Tele-Communications Inc. of Denver, at a panel
discussion Monday on the future of cable.

   Islamic militants set off 11 bombs and
youths fired bullets in the air to honor Kashmir's top Moslem
clergyman, who was buried today as 300,000 mourners wailed and
screamed.
   Security forces kept their distance, apparently to avoid a
recurrence of Monday's violence when paramilitary police shot and
killed at least 58 mourners.
   Maulvi Mohammad Farooq, a recent convert to the Kashmir
independence movement, was slain Monday by three unidentified
gunmen.
   A few hours later, security forces fired on a huge crowd that
defied a curfew and carried Farooq's body six miles to his office.
Witnesses and official sources said 58 people were killed and 300
were wounded. The witnesses said the gunfire was unprovoked, but
some officials said the security forces were returning fire from
Moslem militants.
   As massive crowds, nearly one-third of Srinagar's population,
gathered again today, the government withdrew all security forces
along the route of the funeral procession, which wound its way from
Islamia College to Martyrs Cemetery on the outskirts of Srinagar.
   Farooq's rose-covered coffin was in a truck at the head of the
mile-long procession. It took four hours to travel the four miles
to the cemetery.
   Thousands of men and women, weeping, beating their chests and
waving at the crowd, lined the streets. Boys fired pistols and
revolvers in the air.
   ``Farooq's blood will bear fruit. We will attain independence,''
they shouted.
   As the funeral cortege reached Martyrs Cemetery militants set
off 11 bombs at the far end of the adjoining prayer ground.
   The crowd seemed to be expecting the blasts and bowed their
heads. Then they screamed independence slogans.
   Farooq's son Umar announced over loudspeakers that his father's
last wish was for ``Kashmiris to unite in the fight for
independence.''
   Forty to 50 militant youths fired Kalashnikov rifles and
revolvers in the air after Umar Farooq's announcement. The firing
continued for 10 minutes until the coffin was in the ground.
   The crowd dispersed after the burial.
   Some of Farooq's aides blamed his killing on right-wing Hindus,
while government officials accused Moslem militants who thought
Farooq was too moderate.
   Supporters or representatives of several militant groups,
including the Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front and the Hezbul
Mujahedeen, took the microphone at Islamia College to tell mourners
they were not responsible.
   ``This has not been done by any militant,'' one speaker said.
   Farooq's prominence in the troubled valley had been eclipsed by
Moslems fighting for an independent nation. After the crackdown
began on Jan. 20, he joined the demand for independence. Before
that, however, Farooq had urged a political settlement of the
problem.
   At the United Nations Monday, Secretary-General Javier Perez de
Cuellar said he was ``shocked and saddened'' by the assassination,
and he appealed for restraint by all sides.
   Because the violence and independence drive have heightened
tensions between India and neighboring Pakistan, and Perez de
Cuellar has been careful in his statement not to take sides.
   Today, India's regular army troops were standing by in Srinagar
but were not deployed on the streets, which were guarded by
paramilitary police forces.
   ``We are keeping watch over the situation,'' said Hamidullah
Khan, chief secretary of law and order for Jammu-Kashmir. He was
contacted by telephone in Srinagar.
   Monday's shootings pushed the death toll in the Kashmir Valley
to about 460 since Jan. 20, when the government began its harshest
crackdown on a violent separatist campaign of bombings, kidnappings
and assassinations.
   The majority of those killed have been Moslem militants or their
supporters, shot during anti-Indian demonstrations or while defying
the curfews that have become a way of life in Srinagar.
   The secession movement has flared on and off since 1947, when
India and Pakistan were partitioned along religious lines upon
independence from Britain.
   Both India and Pakistan claimed the territory.
   Initially, most secessionist groups sought to join Kashmir with
Moslem Pakistan, but in recent years the most militant groups have
demanded unconditional independence.
   Two Indian-Pakistani wars _ in 1948 and 1965 _ failed to resolve
the Kashmir question. The region is split between the two nations
along a contested frontier.
   The western part of Kashmir went to Pakistan, while the eastern
part became part of India's Jammu-Kashmir state. It is the only
Moslem majority state in India, where 82 percent of the population
of 880 million is Hindu.
   In Jammu-Kashmir, Moslems comprise 64 percent of the 6 million
inhabitants. Hindus, living mostly in the Jammu region, form 32
percent.

   The death toll reached 68 in the
sinking of a passenger ship 1,000 miles northeast of Jakarta, a
report said today.
   The official Antara news agency said it was unclear how many
people had been aboard the vessel, the Macoli, which sank Sunday
night in heavy seas off East Kalimantan province.
   The report said at least 141 people were rescued, including some
infants.
   Originally it was thought that the ship was carrying 133 people.
But Antara quoted a Tarakan Port Authority official as saying
authorities believed the ship carried at least 209 people. Its
capacity was 110 passengers.
   The ship was en route to Tarakan from Nunukan, both in East
Kalimantan.

<HEAD>Census Taker Suspended for Reporting Suspected Drug User</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A census worker has been suspended for
violating the U.S. Census Bureau's tradition of confidentiality
because he informed the police that a resident he questioned
appeared to be using marijuana.
   The bureau's Cedar Rapids office said Stephen Larson should have
informed his superiors and let them decide whether to inform the
police. Larson said he was told Monday he was being suspended
pending an investigation.
   Tom Moss, the district office's director, said census
enumerators make assurances that ``nothing will come out of this to
anybody other than the Census Bureau.''
   Police, who took no action on Larson's complaint, said today
that the census taker's only mistake was telling a reporter about
his report.
   While on the job in early May, Larson said he was greeted with a
cloud of marijuana smoke when a tenant opened his door. He said he
completed the census form with the resident, who was cooperative,
and later went home and reported him to police.
   ``I did what I thought was right at the time,'' Larson said.
``But according to them (his bosses), you can't even notify the
police when you witness a murder going on if it occurs in a house
you're doing for the census.''
   Moss said confidentiality does not take precedence over
criminality, or even suspected criminality.
   ``I am not saying there is a higher priority on confidentiality
over anything, even a suspicion,'' said Moss. ``I'm simply saying
that whatever our people can do we must keep the confidentiality we
promised people. We promised the public that we won't tell.''
   Sgt. Glenn Fox of the narcotics division in Cedar Rapids said
Larson waited until late at night to make his report. ``By then,
there was so little information, we couldn't have acted anyway. We
added it to our intelligence file and that was it,'' Fox said.
   Fox said he can understand the Census Bureau's insistence on
confidentiality, ``but I admire the guy for standing up for what is
right.''
   ``The mistake he made, and no offense, he should never have told
the news media about it. We'd never have told anybody if he
hadn't,'' he said.

<HEAD>Three People Deliver Suspect to Police at Gunpoint</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WICHITA, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police have yet to decide whether to
prosecute three people who forced a naked suspect at gunpoint into
a car trunk for a 200-mile drive to Wichita.
   But they did charge the suspect, 24-year-old Darrel Hartley, on
Monday with molesting his former girlfriend's teen-age daughter.
   Police say Hartley was delivered to them by the ex-girlfriend
and two of her friends.
   Hartley was charged in Sedgwick County District Court with two
counts of indecent liberties with a child and is being held in
Sedgwick County Jail in lieu of $5,000 bond.
   Police Lt. Mike McKenna said Hartley was arrested early Sunday
after the man's former girlfriend, 45, and two male companions
drove to Sublette on Saturday night and confronted Hartley.
   McKenna said the woman told police that she and Hartley had been
living together in Wichita when, in January, he had sexual
intercourse with her 13-year-old daughter.
   ``They took him into custody at gunpoint, ordered him to
undress, tied him up, put him in the trunk of the car and drove
back to Wichita,'' McKenna said.
   He said the drive takes ``a ood four hours.''
   When the trio got to Wichita at 1 a.m. Sunday, McKenna said,
they took Hartley to the woman's house, gave him back his clothes
and called police.
   Police interviewed Hartley, then took him downtown and booked
him.
   McKenna said the woman and her friends were questioned and
released, and the gun was turned in as evidence.
   ``They're not being charged at this time,'' he said. ``We'll
discuss that with the district attorney.''

   Gov. Bob Martinez jokingly described
himself as a ``straight shooter'' today after submitting a urine
sample to kick off his push for a drug-free workplace.
   Martinez was the first of about 45 people in the governor's
office scheduled to submit to the drug tests. Under the mandatory
program, opposed by some state workers, tests producing positive
results will be followed by a more detailed confirmaton test.
   Employees in the governor's office were notified in January they
would be subject to the $36 test, said press secretary Jon Peck.
The governor's executive order March 26 served as a 60-day notice
to workers.
   Results of his tests will be available by June 1, but won't be
made public, his office said.

   The presidents of Estonia and Latvia met today
with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to discuss moves they
have taken toward independence, an Estonian spokesman said.
   In Lithuania, the parliament met to consider a new offer to the
Kremlin aimed at breaking the republic's impasse with Moscow over
its March 11 declaration of independence, a parliamentary spokesman
said.
   A strike by pro-Moscow forces in Estonia went into its second
day, with workers at two more plants joining the protest against
the republic's independence drive, a strike committee spokesman
said.
   The Tass news agency said the strike has spread to coal mines,
shipyards and the Krengolmskaya manufacturing mills, the republic's
largest light industry enterprise.
   Tass said 21 industrial businesses were on strike.
   Finnish radio reported a strike among members of Estonia's
ethnic Russian minority had prompted the owners of the Baltic ferry
boat ``Georg Ots'' to suspend service between the Finnish capital
of Helsinki and Tallinn, the Estonian capital.
   The three Baltic republics _ Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia _
were forcibly annexed by the Soviet Union 50 years ago, and all are
in varying stages of efforts to break free of Moscow's control.
   Presidents Arnold Ruutel of Estonia and Anatoly Gorbunov of
Latvia met this morning with members of Gorbachev's Federation
Council, an advisory body on the nation's republics and
nationalities, said Andrei Birov, a spokesman for the Estonian
mission in Moscow.
   The two Baltic officials met later with Gorbachev, another
Estonian spokesman said. No details of either meeting were released.
   Last week, Lithuanian Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene met
with Gorbachev, who urged her to persuade the republic's parliament
to suspend its declaration of independence.
   An assistant U.S. Commerce Department secretary said today the
Bush administration ``hopes the Soviet Union will end its economic
blockade of Lithuania and begin a productive dialogue with the
Lithuanian people.''
   The official, Thomas J. Duesterberg, was in Moscow for talks
with Soviet trade officials.
   In Vilnius, the Lithuanian capital, legislators were debating
measures on holding the economy together in the face of the Kremlin
economic blockade as well as what approach to take toward Moscow
regarding the independence declaration, a spokesman for the
parliament's information bureau said.
   Debate continued through the afternoon, without any resolutions
being passed, he said.
   So far, lawmakers have refused to suspend the independence
decree, but have offered to consider rescinding other measures
aimed at implementing the declaration.
   The Lithuanian economy is feeling squeezed by the cutoff of oil,
natural gas and other raw materials imposed by Moscow more than a
month ago.
   Lithuanian parliamentary spokeswoman Rita Dapkus said Monday
that total industrial, construction and transportation layoffs have
topped 12,100, not counting taxi and bus drivers who have been
idled by the resulting shortage of gasoline.
   In the agricultural sector, the embargo has forced the shutdown
of 712 enterprises, or 60 percent of the republic's total, Ms.
Dapkus said.
   Lithuanian Vice President Ceslovas Stankevicius said townspeople
may be evacuated to the countryside to conserve energy and food.
   ``I cannot say how long we can survive this situation, but the
Lithuanian people are ready to suffer this anti-humanitarian act,''
he told a seminar on Baltic independence in Stockholm, Sweden.
   The economic embargo was imposed on Lithuania after it refused
to rescind some of its pro-independence laws.
   On May 14, Gorbachev decreed that steps toward independence by
Latvia and Estonia violated the Soviet constitution, but he has not
taken any punitive action against those two republics.
   In Tallinn, the striking workers demanded that Ruutel resign and
the parliament rescind laws challenging Soviet authority, said
Viktor Tsunya, a member of the anti-independence Russian Strike
Committee.
   Tass said the workers want pro-Moscow legislators to meet to
consider setting up an alternate government.
   Estonian Prime Minister Edgar Savisaar told local radio that the
strike ``will not do serious damage to the Estonian economy'' and
that measures were being taken to solve any problems created by the
work stoppage.
   The strike, which began Monday in the form of political meetings
at plants and factories, is being carried out mostly by
Russian-speaking workers who are against any break with Moscow.
   Sixty-five percent of the republic's 1.8 million population is
Estonian. Russians comprise 28 percent, with Ukrainians and
Byelorussians making up the rest.
   Russians and other ethnic minorities in all three Baltic
republics complain that they are discriminated against as a result
of the independence movements.

   Prague's former Communist Party
boss was charged with abuse of power today, becoming the first
Communist to face trial following last year's peaceful revolution,
the official CTK news agency said. Miroslav Stepan is accused of
using his position as the city's Communist Party chairman to
suppress growing public dissent in 1988-89. If convicted, he could
face up to 10 years in prison.
   According to the charges, at a meeting of the Prague security
council on Oct. 28, 1988, Stepan told police chief Bohumil Carda to
use water cannon and tear gas to stop demonstrations.
   ``These means were then indeed used, although the security
council has authority only to take measures to protect the state,''
CTK quoted a statement by the prosecutor as saying.
   Stepan has been held in custody since Dec. 23, 1989, pending an
investigation into whether he played a role in the bloody police
crackdown on students last Nov. 17.
   The crackdown provoked a wave of protests that toppled the
hard-line Communist regime of Milos Jakes.
   ``The result of our investigation so far does not indicate that
the police ... intervention was based on the initative of Mr.
Stepan,'' the prosecutor's statement said. It did not say when
Stepan would be tried.

<HEAD>New Government Will Seek Talks On Withdrawal from Alliance</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALEX BANDY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hungary's new premier said today his
government will seek to negotiate the country's withdrawal from the
Soviet-led Warsaw Pact.
   Jozsef Antall's elected government is to be sworn in next week,
and he outlined his programs to Parliament today.
   The new government faces serious economic problems. Inflation is
in double digits, unemployment is rising and Hungary has a $20
billion foreign debt, the highest per capita in Eastern Europe.
   Antall, who wants to restore free enterprise, promised
anti-inflation measures and better social welfare and education,
but did not explain how this would be financed. He said a more
detailed program would be outlined soon.
   He also said he hoped Hungary could join the European Community
in the next decade, and said his government intends to ``dismantle
the system of repression'' and ``inaugurate the system of liberty.''
   The Communist Party, which ruled Hungary for decades, revamped
itself in advance of Hungary's free elections last March and April,
but nonetheless was overwhelmingly defeated.
   On withdrawal from the Warsaw Pact, Antall said Hungary would
take into account ``the international situation, our neighbors'
positions, and the Hungarian armed forces' state of preparedness.''
   Parliament's foreign affairs committee has urged swift talks
with the Soviet Union and the five other Pact members on Hungary's
possible withdrawal.
   Antall stressed, however, that withdrawal would come in the
context of new security arrangements for all of Europe.
   The state news agency MTI earlier quoted Gyula Horn, the
outgoing foreign minister, as warning that withdrawal from the pact
would hinder ongoing talks on reducing conventional arms in Europe.
   The talks in Vienna by the Warsaw Pact and the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization aim at an initial agreement on reducing
conventional forces and weapons later this year.
   Horn was quoted as saying a Hungarian withdrawal from the
alliance would force the Warsaw Pact to make unspecified ``new
calculations.''

<HEAD>Police Arrest Man Under Anti-Terrorist Law, Seize Automatic
Weapons</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police seized loaded automatic weapons from a car
after a chase in north London early today and arrested the driver
under an anti-terrorist law, police and witnesses said.
   The seizure, following Irish Republican Army bombings of two
British army offices in London last week, raised speculation that
police had intercepted an IRA unit shifting arms in the capital.
   A police statement said a patrol car began chasing the suspect
car at about 3 a.m. in Tottenham in north London. The driver
eventually pulled over and was caught as he tried to flee, police
said.
   Scotland Yard, London's police headquarters, warned that another
terrorist suspect was probably driving behind the arms car and had
gotten away. They put out a general alert.
   Scotland Yard said only that ``weapons'' were seized and the
driver was being held under the Prevention of Terrorism Act. It
allows police to hold suspects for up to a week without charge.
   Witnesses said police hauled several loaded submachine guns from
behind the driver's seat of the battered green Cortina.
   Police at the scene said at least two Soviet-made AK-47 rifles
were seized.
   In Belfast, Northern Ireland, youths hurled a homemade bomb at a
British army patrol in a Roman Catholic district on Monday night,
wounding one soldier, the army reported. A bus driver was hurt in a
separate attack with gasoline bomb, police said.
   The government says it believes the IRA bombings in London last
week were the start of a summer offensive in Britain by the group.
   A sergeant was killed and another man wounded Wednesday when a
bomb blew apart their vehicle at an army recruiting center in
Wembley, north London, a few miles from Tottenham.
   Two days earlier, an IRA blast at an army education office at
Eltham, southeast London, injured seven civilians.
   The IRA is fighting to end British rule in Northern Ireland and
unite the Protestant-dominated province with the Republic of
Ireland, which is overwhelmingly Roman Catholic. The organization
is banned throughout Ireland and the United Kingdom.

   The Senate Agriculture Committee voted Tuesday
for a bill that would require that fish processed as food be
inspected in much the same way as meat and poultry.
   ``Currently, less than 12 percent of American seafood undergoes
some kind of inspection or grading,'' said Sen. Patrick Leahy,
D-Vt., chairman of the committee. ``Only 7 percent of almost 2,000
seafood processors nationwide participate in these voluntary
inspection programs.''
   Meat and poultry undergo rigorous inspection by the Agriculture
Department.
   A consumer advocate who has been campaigning since 1986 for
similar standards for fish praised the bill, but said it was
missing two essential features.
   Ellen Haas, founder of Public Voice for Food and Health Policy,
said she hoped to see an amendment added on the Senate floor that
would require fishing boats to be inspected.
   She also said she was disappointed the committee removed
whistle-blower provisions in the bill that would have protected any
employees of inspection programs who call attention to alleged
misconduct or deficiencies.
   ``They are the insurance of a program with integrity,'' said
Haas. ``Senator Leahy said he is committed to fight for it on the
floor.''
   Haas said the bill is strong as it stands, but gives a great
deal of responsibility to the industry.
   Similar legislation is pending in the House, but has not yet
been approved by the agriculture committee there.
   Under the Senate bill the Agriculture Department would:
   _set standards for processing fish.
   _determine sources of potential contamination.
   _require prevention and cleanup procedures for contaminated
areas.
   _assure through inspections that fish and food made from fish
are processed under sanitary conditions.
   The Food and Drug Administration, which administers the limited
fish inspection program that exists, would continue to decide the
level of contamination that is considered harmful.
   The commerce secretary would be authorized to close waters that
are considered too contaminated for safe fishing.
   Imported fish would have to comply with all the standards set
for fish harvested domestically.
   Grants totalling $2 million would be provided each year to
educate fish processors on proper handling methods.

   East German border soldiers apprehended a
U.S. citizen Tuesday after he ran through a Berlin Wall border
crossing and lay down in the street, blocking border traffic, an
army spokesman said.
   The man bolted from the West Berlin side of the remains of the
wall and through the passport control checkpoint known as
Checkpoint Charlie, an East German army spokesman said.
   Foreigners are required to show their passports when crossing
between the Germanys.
   The American then lay down in the street and blocked traffic
until East German soldiers took him away and turned him over to the
city's medical service, the army spokesman said.
   He was identified as John Runnings of Seattle.
   The spokesman referred to the man as a ``special personality''
who has done similar things in the past two years.
   He said the American apparently has been living in West Berlin.

<HEAD>Newspaper Says Secret Police Tried to Eavesdrop on Pope</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secret police under the previous Communist
regime bugged the Jasna Gora monastery at Czestochowa just before
Pope John Paul II's 1979 pilgrimage, a newspaper reported Tuesday.
   Vatican security officials discovered the eavesdropping devices
and gave the pope another room, Solidarity's Gazeta Wyborcza
newspaper said.
   The disclosure follows earlier reports by the Solidarity-led
government that the now-dissolved Security Service eavesdropped on
hotel rooms, foreign journalists and Solidarity offices.
   The Security Service was disbanded after Solidarity Prime
Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki took power in September. It once had an
entire department devoted to monitoring the Catholic Church.
   The listening devices at the shrine in southern Poland, which
shelters the revered Black Madonna icon, were installed during an
expansion of the monastery's electrical system in preparation for
the pope's visit, the paper said.
   Vatican officials inspecting the rooms tipped off the Rev. Jozef
Platek, then head of the 600-year-old monastery, to the electronic
listening devices. Platek assigned the pope to another room.
   According to the article, the monastery also mysteriously
developed plumbing problems before the 1979 papal trip and a
subsequent visit _ an apparent effort to allow a plumber to gain
access to the papal quarters.
   When the monastery fired its plumber, the Interior Ministry
pressed for his rehiring, the paper said.
   Gazeta Wyborcza writer Dariusz Fedor said the story was based
mainly on interviews with confidential sources.
   The Polish-born pope's 1979 visit was the first by a Catholic
primate to an East bloc country. It attracted huge crowds and is
credited with inspiring the Solidarity movement born the next year.
   The Jasna Gora shrine became legendary in Poland after it
withstood a determined Swedish siege in 1655.

<TEXT>
   The superintendent of Yellowstone National
Park says a new study that maintains the return of wolves to the
park will have little impact on other wildlife is the most thorough
look yet at the proposal.
   But U.S. Rep. Ron Marlenee, R-Mont., calls it ``poppycock,''
adding that the 586-page report shipped to Capitol Hill on Monday
says exactly what the National Park Service and the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service _ proponents of the wolf recovery proposal _
wanted it to say.
   U.S. Sen. James McClure, R-Idaho, is expected this week to
introduce legislation calling for wolves to be transplanted to
Yellowstone as well as the Frank Church-River of No Return
Wilderness in central Idaho.
   The study, put together with comments from wolf experts
worldwide and researchers from three universities, predicts little
impact on wildlife or livestock near Yellowstone if wolves are
returned.
   However, it speculates that some wolves would head beyond
Yellowstone's boundaries and have to be controlled by one means or
another to protect livestock interests.
   Although some critics of the recovery plan fear wolves would
decimate Yellowstone's big game herds, the study said the available
prey was at least five times greater than that which 100 wolves _
the ideal recovery population _ would be expected to reduce or even
limit.
   Bryce Dustman, press secretary for U.S. Sen. Conrad Burns,
R-Mont., said he wasn't surprised by the report's claim that wolves
would have little effect on wildlife or livestock.
   He said ``it jumped out at him'' that the Park Service and Fish
and Wildlife Service wrote a study saying the wolf wouldn't have a
detrimental effect on livestock or big game.
   Barbee acknowledged the Park Service supports the wolf's return,
but said the two agencies didn't manipulate the report's contents.
   McClure's proposal is expected to call for three breeding pairs
of wolves to be transplanted into the two core areas and protected
within those areas.
   The wolves would not, however, be protected outside those areas
and would be managed under state law rather than the federal
Endangered Species Act.

<HEAD>Thatcher Urges End to Sanctions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said Tuesday that
economic sanctions against South Africa should be lifted because
President F. W. de Klerk's reforms have made them ``almost
irrelevant.''
   Answering a question in Parliament from a pro-South African
lawmaker, Mrs. Thatcher issued her most forthright call so far for
waiving sanctions.
   It came four days after de Klerk met Mrs. Thatcher in England
during the South African president's nine-nation tour of Europe.
   Praising de Klerk's ``integrity and courage,'' Mrs. Thatcher
said he had made reforms ``which are irreversible, which will bring
an end to apartheid'' and lead to a democratic government on a
non-racial basis.
   ``I believe that there is no place now for sanctions and ...
indeed they are almost irrelevant,'' she said. ``Those people who
want South Africa to have a prosperous economy should not support
sanctions in any way.''
   Mrs. Thatcher has been consistently at odds with Britain's
partners in the 49-nation Commonwealth and the 12-member European
Community in opposing sanctions.
   In February, after de Klerk released black leader Nelson
Mandela, Mrs. Thatcher acted alone and lifted some minor
restrictions.
   Britain now appears determined to press the Community at
meetings next month to ease sanctions. The main European Communisty
embargoes are bans on the purchase of South African coal, steel and
gold coins, and on new government investment.
   De Klerk was in Switzerland on Tuesday, where he voiced
confidence that support for his reform policies will lead to the
lifting of sanctions, perhaps before the end of the year.
   De Klerk spoke to reporters after meeting with members of the
Swiss Cabinet.
   He warned that failure to recognize that his country is
``inexorably on the road to a new South Africa'' would ``play into
the hands of the radicals, of those who do not want a peaceful
solution.''
   ``The time has come for the world to take off its apartheid
glasses,'' he said. ``We are aiming at a situation where there
won't be any underdogs in South Africa.''

<TEXT>
   Radicals armed with firebombs and
rocks fought police and burned a U.S. flag in Kwangju on Tuesday,
and students in the capital declared a week of protests against the
U.S. presence in South Korea.
   Police tightened security at U.S. facilities and arrested eight
radical students who tried to deliver a letter to the U.S. Embassy
in Seoul.
   Shouting ``Drive out the Yankees!'' the protesters unfurled an
anti-American banner that demanded the U.S. apologize for South
Korea's bloody suppression of a 1980 civil uprising in Kwangju.
   Also in Seoul, police fired 23 blanks from an M-16 rifle at
about 100 students who threw firebombs at a police station.
   At a news conference in Seoul, student leaders said they would
stage anti-U.S. protests through Sunday.
   ``We are asking for a formal U.S. apology'' over the suppression
of the Kwangju uprising, said a statement by radical students, who
are a loud minority on South Korean campuses. It also accused the
United States of supporting dictatorships in South Korea and
demanded an apology for that.
   ``Unless our demands are met, the United States will be
punished,'' the statement warned.
   The student leaders said they would ``seek the spread of
anti-U.S. feeling among Koreans through various means during the
period and unveil the true character of the United States.''
   In Kwangju, 155 miles south, groups of 100 to 500 students
staged violent anti-U.S. protests in the city center after burning
a U.S. flag. Police firing tear gas chased the protesters into
alleys and sidestreets.
   The scattered street protests in Kwangju died down after
nightfall. Police did not say how many people were injured or
arrested.
   The open letter to the U.S. Embassy demanded the United States
withdraw its 43,000 troops stationed in South Korea, remove nuclear
weapons positioned here, and stay out of Korean politics.
   Radicals have staged violent anti-government, anti-U.S. protests
to mark the 10th anniversary of the Kwangju uprising, the bloodiest
in modern Korean history.
   By official count, 200 citizens were killed in the 10-day revolt
that began on May 18, 1980. Despite repeated denials by the United
States, many citizens feel that Washington condoned the Korean
military suppression.
   At a hospital morgue in Kwangju, about 500 militants brandishing
metal pipes guarded the body of a student activist who suffered
fatal head injuries when he jumped from a train to avoid police
checkpoints.
   The 21-year-old student, Shin Jan-ho, died Saturday, as about
20,000 students from across the nation gathered for a rally marking
the Kwangju anniversary.
   About 150 students staged an anti-U.S. sit-in Tuesday at Korea
Aviation College, 18 miles north of Seoul, when 20 U.S. military
helicopters landed on the college's airstrip.
   The protesters shouted ``Withdraw U.S. troops'' and marched
around the helicopters, but there were no incidents, the Yonhap
news agency said. U.S. helicopters occasionally use the airstrip
for training.

   Rescue workers continued to dig for bodies in the debris of
homes and roads that were torn up and collapsed under the onslaught

   Entire suburbs have been cut off from the rest of the city by

   Police on Tuesday called off a
two-month search for two wallabies that have been running wild on
the outskirts of this Dutch town for two months.
   ``It can't do any harm to let them live up in the dunes,''
Deputy Commander J. N. Boer of the National Police told The
Associated Press after abandoning the search. ``Besides, we have
better things to do.''
   The wallabies are relatives of the kangaroo and are also native
to Australia. They were the pets of a local resident until they
hopped over his fence.
   Police were concerned the sight of two 20-inch-high wallabies
hopping down the highway might cause a traffic accident. They even
called in a helicopter to ferret out the marsupials.
   The wallabies eluded searchers.
   ``Last Thursday I was called to a house on the edge of a meadow
where a kangaroo was unassumingly eating grass in the backyard,''
veterinarian Erik van der Kamp told the AP.
   Attempts to tranquilize the animals with dart guns have failed
because the animals draw crowds of local children wherever they
appear.
   Police said the owner had refused to cooperate in capture
attempts. Repeated telephone calls to his home were not answered.
   ``There's no law against letting your pet kangaroos roam free,
but he will be responsible for whatever might happen,'' said Boer.

<TEXT>
   Riding double on motorcycles was
declared illegal Tuesday in the city of Medellin in an effort to
stop drive-by killings that have become common in the drug-infested
city.
   President Virgilio Barco, worried about a wave of violence prior
to Sunday's presidential election, canceled a trip to Peru where he
was to have attended a regional presidential summit Tuesday.
   The new law regarding motorcycle riders was imposed a day after
the slaying of Sen. Federico Estrada Velez of the governing Liberal
Party. Police in Medellin said two men on a motorcycle were
responsible for the murder.
   Killers hired by drug traffickers often travel in pairs on
motorcycles to carry out a job: one drives, one shoots, then both
disappear rapidly into traffic.
   The 63-year-old politician and his driver were shot to death at
a Medellin traffic light Monday.
   Condemning Estrada's assassination and a series of recent bomb
attacks, Barco said he would not attend a presidential summit in
Peru to discuss regional integration among Colombia, Venezuela,
Peru, Ecuador and Bolivia.
   In a nationwide televised speech Monday night, the president
called for national solidarity to fight violence.
   ``Violent people must be confronted by an invincible army of 30
million Colombians of good will,'' he said.
   In the last 10 days, five car bombs have exploded in three
Colombian cities, killing 28 people and injuring about 300.
   On Monday, a powerful bomb was defused shortly before it was set
to go off in front of a school where Barco's two granddaughters
attend classes. One of the girl's bodyguards found the bomb.
   The Bogota daily El Tiempo said the fuse had 60 seconds left
when it was defused.
   Colombia has been hit by a wave of bombings and assassinations
since August, when Barco declared war on drug traffickers and
resumed extraditions to the United States.

<HEAD>Boys Digging For Worms Unearth Rare Baseball Card</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   They were only digging for worms, but
three boys came up with pay dirt instead when they found what
appears to be a rare Honus Wagner baseball card dating back to the
early 1900s.
   The card featuring the Pittsburgh Pirates' Hall of Fame
shortstop, also known as ``The Flying Dutchman,'' was found dry and
in good condition, with the colors still bright and corners neat
and square, said Arlo Quint, 12.
   The boys raced to a collectors shop and compared the card
against a reprint, and it appeared to be genuine, the boy said
Tuesday.
   ``I can't believe it,'' said Quint, who found the card Monday.
   If proven authentic, it could be worth $10,000 or more, an
expert said.
   The boy said he will probably sell the card and share the
profits with his family and Chris Deck and Eric Love, both 13, who
were looking for fishing worms with Quint when he unearthed a
small, bent tooth-powder can that also contained three other cards.
   Quint said the boys can't make out whose pictures are depicted
on the other cards. Wagner, a baseball legend who played for the
Pittsburgh Pirates from 1897 to 1917, posted a .329 lifetime
batting average.
   Quint has been collecting baseball cards since he was 5 and has
about 5,000 cards in his collection.
   A Wagner card ``in real good shape'' is worth $100,000, said
Brad Shaw of the Fuss-Budget Sportscards Center in Augusta.
   ``Even one in rough shape is worth $10,000 to $15,000,''
although it could fetch more at auction, Shaw said Tuesday.
   The card discovered by Quint was thought to have been
distributed in 1909 by the Piedmont Tobacco Co.
   Wagner, a teetotaler who did not smoke, demanded that the
tobacco company cease publishing his card because he said it
implied an endorsement. Shaw said no more than 50 Wagner cards
remain intact.
   Coincidentally, another Honus Wagner card was discovered about
30 miles away in Stockton Springs about a month ago.

   The first person to successfully receive an
artificial heart as a bridge to transplant of a human heart has
received a second artificial heart implant, University Medical
Center officials said today.
   Michael Drummond, 30, of Phoenix received the Symbion J-7-70
device during a five-hour, 15-minute operation Monday night,
hospital officials said. Drummond was in critical but stable
condition, normal for recovery from heart surgery, hospital
spokeswoman Jan Howard said today.
   Drummond had been on a list for a heart transplant since
Thursday, but doctors said the artificial device was decided upon
Monday afternoon after an attempt to put Drummond on a ventilator
critically lowered his blood pressure.
   Dr. Jack G. Copeland, head of the hospital's heart transplant
and artificial heart programs, determined that an artificial heart
support device was Drummond's only chance to survive to a new heart
transplant, the hospital said. Copeland led the surgical team in
the operation.
   Drummond was the first person to successfully undergo a
bridge-to-transplant and recover from a subsequent heart
transplant. He was also the youngest man to receive an artificial
heart device when he had the Jarvik-7 artificial heart implanted
Aug. 29, 1985.
   Drummond suffered a stroke, but recovered and received the heart
of a 19-year-old Texas man nine days later.
   He went through several rejection episodes, but recovered and
returned to work as a grocery store assistant manager until several
recent illnesses.
   The Jarvik-7 Drummond received later was donated to the
Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush said Tuesday the United States
``must do all we can'' to encourage free market development across
Latin America to consolidate democratic gains in the region.
   Calling Cuba the hemisphere's lone holdout, Bush said, ``We are
closer than ever before to the day when all the people of the
Americas, North and South, will live in freedom.''
   The events of the past year _ including the demise of
dictatorships in Panama, Nicaragua, Chile and Paraguay _ have
``strengthened our desire to forge a new partnership with the
growing forces of freedom in Latin America,'' he said.
   Bush, addressing a U.S. business group interested in promoting
Latin trade, said, ``We in the U.S. must do all we can to ensure
the future of free markets in the Americas, because our nation has
a stake in the economic health of this hemisphere.''
   Two-way trade between the United States and Latin America last
year topped $100 billion for the first time, he said.
   ``Our challenge is to consolidate democracy and accelerate
development,'' Bush told the Council of the Americas.
   On this anniversary of Cuban independence from Spain, Bush took
a slap at Fidel Castro's ``isolated'' island, which he called ``out
of step with the democratic tide.''
   ``Let me say with certainty that even in Cuba, the dream of
democracy can only be pushed back a little, only deferred. It will
never be destroyed,'' Bush said.
   Many Latin nations have held free elections in the past year,
including Nicaragua, where Sandinista President Daniel Ortega lost
to opposition leader Violetta Chamorro, and Chile, where the
military dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet ended after 17 years.
   ``All across the Americas, today more people live under freely
elected governments than ever before,'' said Bush.
   ``The U.S. is engaged as never before in the future of this
hemisphere,'' he said.
   Bush also made a pitch for his $720 million emergency aid
package for Panama and Nicaragua.
   ``Finally, it appears the Congress may act this week on this
vital measure,'' said Bush, who first sought the money in March.
``Let me say to the Congress: The fate of freedom rests in your
hands. Do the work of democracy and pass this emergency aid package
now.''
   The Council of the Americas, founded by banker David Rockefeller
in 1965, consists of nearly 200 U.S. companies with interests in
Latin America and the Caribbean.

   Victorious presidential candidate Ion
Iliescu today offered to form a coalition with losing parties, but
one opposition leader ruled out the idea and another said he
planned to challenge the vote.
   Hundreds of angry anti-goverment demonstrators camped out in
downtown Bucharest today chased Sever Georgescu, a senior
government official, and forced him to seek shelter in a hotel.
   The government sent Georgescu to speak to 24 hunger strikers,
and as he left, protesters surrounded him, shouting: ``You thieves,
you stole the revolution!'' and ``We want free elections!'' He
escaped unharmed.
   State radio urged the public to help police find people who were
circulating leaflets calling for a demonstration against voting
fraud. In language reminiscent of former leader Nicolae Ceausescu's
terms for opponents, the radio described the protest organizers as
``bad-intentioned elements.''
   At least two Western European observer groups today questioned
the legitimacy of Iliescu's victory in Romania's first democratic
elections in a half-century, and the head of one group said Western
governments should refrain from granting aid to Romania.
   With 12.6 million ballots counted by this afternoon, Iliescu of
the National Salvation Front had about 86 percent of the vote in
the three-way presidential contest, according to the Central
Electoral Bureau.
   Radu Campeanu of the National Liberal Party had 10.2 percent and
Ion Ratiu of the National Peasants Party had 3.8 percent. More than
85 percent of the 16 million eligible voters cast ballots.
   Iliescu, the interim president, had been heavily favored to win
the election. The charismatic 60-year-old is credited with helping
overthrow Ceausescu in December and implementing measures to help
the large peasant and working classes.
   Iliescu and the Front are likely to become the first
ex-Communists in Eastern Europe to triumph in the region's current
multiparty elections.
   He told the French TV network TF-1 that he would support an
investigation into the election. He said any examination would show
the Front had won fairly.
   Iliescu said he would seek to form a coalition with the defeated
opposition parties and would offer his opponents representation in
the government based on their electoral showing.
   ``I would like to know what he's talking about,'' Ratiu told The
Associated Press when asked about the possibility of a coalition.
``I haven't had any approach from anybody.''
   Campeanu ruled out a coalition with the Front, saying minority
views could not possibly be heard in a government overwhelmingly
dominated by one party.
   Ratiu made the fraud charge as early results showed him lagging
far behind Iliescu, a former Communist, in the voting for president.
   ``We will contest the election if this is the sort of result
that we get,'' Ratiu told a news conference. ``We will ask for them
to be considered null and void. We will ask for new elections.''
   A National Liberal Party official also claimed the election was
marred by fraud.
   ``We will demand the outcome of these elections be declared
void,'' said Sorin Botez, the party's foreign relations secretary.
   ``The Front has won the elections but apparently it definitely
alienated several million voters,'' the Romania Libera newspaper
said in an editorial.
   It said the country had lost the chance to have ``a genuine
political opposition in Parliament.''
   In the race for seats in the two-chamber parliament, Electoral
Bureau results based on 12.6 million votes gave the Front about 68
percent, the Liberals about 7.3 percent, the Peasants 2.2 percent,
the Ecological Movement 2.5 percent.
   The Hungarian Democratic Union received about 7.3 percent,
apparently winning broad allegiance from Romania's 2 million ethnic
Hungarians. The other votes went to tiny parties.
   The official U.S. government observer, Gov. Garrey E. Carruthers
of New Mexico, called the poll ``a good election'' and ``a very
giant step toward democracy.''
   But Austrian parliamentarian Andreas Khol, general secretary of
the European Democratic Union, disagreed. ``These were a big step
toward free and democratic elections, but they were no free and no
democratic elections,'' said Khol, whose conservative political
group also is supported by Britain and West Germany's governing
parties.
   The European Parliament observer delegation said the results
could be accepted but the contest could not be viewed as a normal
election by Western standards.
   ``If the results are confirmed this doesn't seem to be the
result of a pluralist system and this worries me,'' said Adelaide
Aglietta, a lawmaker from Italy's Green Party.
   Various observer groups reported instances of ballots
pre-stamped for Iliescu, Front members accompanying elderly voters
into the booth, non-registered voters casting ballots and
individuals voting several times.

   Police battled hundreds of protesters outside
the U.S. Consulate today and troops killed a Palestinian in the
Gaza Strip amid new rioting over the massacre of seven Arab
laborers by an Israeli gunman.
   In Jordan, Palestinian protests broke out nationwide, and two
people were reported killed and 23 injured. Demonstrations
protesting the Israeli killing were held in the capital of Amman,
the cities of Irbid and Zarqa and the Baqaa refugee camp. A
Jordanian government official acknowledged only one death.
   At least 14 Palestinians were wounded by troops in clashes in
the Israeli-occupied Gaza Strip, including a woman five months
pregnant who was hit in the stomach with a plastic bullet, Arab
hospital officials said.
   Another Palestinian died of wounds suffered in an earlier clash,
bringing to 12 the number of Arabs killed since Sunday's massacre.
The number of Palestinians injured by troops since Sunday reached
at least 826.
   Throughout the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Palestinians closed
shops and schools and stayed home from jobs in Israel for a third
day to protest Sunday's slayings in which an Israeli gunman lined
up 50 Arab laborers and opened fire, killing seven.
   The army extended a curfew on the Gaza Strip, home of the slain
workers, and most of the West Bank to quell angry protests. About
1.5 million Palestinians were confined to their homes by the
curfews.
   In Israeli-annexed Arab east Jerusalem, police fired tear gas
today to break up a protest by about 200 Palestinians, mostly
women, who carried black flags of mourning and chanted pro-PLO
slogans as they marched to the U.S. consulate.
   The protesters were led by three Arab members of Parliament,
Greek Catholic Archbishop of Jerusalem Lufti Laham and Sheik Hamad
Jamal, a Moslem leader.
   Arab legislator Abdel Wahab Darousha complained police acted too
quickly in firing tear gas. ``It was a brutal action by police.
There was no need for it,'' he said.
   Sheik Jamal defended the violent protests throughout the
occupied lands. ``In the name of the Palestinian nation, in the
name of the stone throwers ... I say to the occupiers, get out of
our land,'' the gray-robed preacher told reporters.
   In Jerusalem, Arab youths trapped a police jeep in a hail of
rocks, but no one was hurt. In the Jewish quarter of the walled Old
City, assailants hurled a firebomb into an apartment, gutting one
room but causing no injuries.
   In Gaza City, troops firing on Palestinian stone throwers
fatally shot 18-year-old Ahmed Musabeh in the chest, said officials
at Shifa Hospital who examined the body.
   Musabeh's pregnant 23-year-old sister, Samira, was in stable
condition after being shot in the stomach, the Shifa officials
said. The fetus was unharmed, they said.
   Earlier today, Naji Moussa Abu Sabala, 22, died at Israel's Tel
Hashomer Hospital after being shot twice in the head by troops in
clashes late Monday in Gaza's Rafah refugee camp, Arab reporters
said.
   The deaths today brought to 707 the number of Palestinians
killed during the 29-month-old uprising. An additional 216
Palestinians have been slain by fellow Arabs, most on suspicion of
helping Israel. Forty-three Israelis have also died in the violence.
   Many of the 800,000 Arabs living inside Israel returned to work
and studies today after staging protests and a one-day solidarity
strike Monday with their Palestinian brethren in the occupied lands.
   Israel army radio reported that Arab youths erected stone
barricades and burned tires in northern Israeli towns and villages.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir today rejected claims by
Palestinian leaders that his hard-line policies encouraged attacks
on Arabs by treating Jewish vigilantes leniently.
   ``Anyone wishing to see in this mad murder an expression of
Israeli government policy and intentions is maliciously and
viciously distorting the picture,'' Shamir told reporters after
meeting with legislators of his right-wing Likud bloc.
   Shamir said his government would pursue peace efforts. ``We
don't want to live by our sword, but we shall not be quick in
throwing it out as long as it allows us to live in security.''
   On Monday, deputy U.S. State Department spokesman Richard
Boucher criticized Israel's role in the violence, saying that the
absence of a peace process was to blame for the killings. He also
complained about the number of casualties caused by the Israeli
army.
   Meanwhile, the suspect in Sunday's massacre, 21-year-old Ami
Popper, underwent psychiatric evaluation. Authorities have
characterized him as ``deranged'' and upset by an unhappy love
affair.
   The army said Popper had been dishonorably discharged from the
military after completing 17 months of the mandatory three-year
active duty service. He served four months in military lockups for
disciplinary violations and being absent without leave.

<HEAD>Safety Board Wants All Children Secured On Airliners</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The National Transportation Safety Board
recommended Tuesday that children now flying free in parents' arms
be required to sit in separate safety seats on airliners.
   ``All objects must be secured during takeoff and landing,
including coffee pots and luggage,'' said board chairman James
Kolstad. ``And yet infants, our precious children, are not.''
   The proposal, approved 4-0 by the NTSB, does not deal with who
will provide the seats or whether children will pay fares. But if
such a regulation takes effect, airlines are expected to require
that parents generally lug along an infant seat _ like the ones
required in cars _ and buy a ticket if they want to be guaranteed
passage for the child.
   When planes aren't full, the airlines are expected to continue
to allow infants to fly at no charge.
   The recommendation now goes to the Federal Aviation
Administration which has resisted a mandatory rule on the grounds
that the 5,000 to 10,000 youngsters under 2 years old who fly in
adults' laps each day are not at great risk. The FAA is not
required to follow NTSB recommendations and sometimes doesn't.
   Under the NTSB proposal, parents who arrive at the gate of a
fully booked flight with an unticketed baby would not be allowed to
take the child aboard. They also could be denied passage with any
small child, with or without ticket, if they are not carrying an
approved car seat.
   The FAA has said it will consider mandatory restraints but has
proposed only to require that airlines allow seats on board if
passengers chose to use them _ a practice now followed by most
airlines.
   The airline industry, flight attendants union, consumer safety
groups and some members of Congress all have called for mandatory
restraints.
   Some travel agents are among opponents of the measure who say it
would add to the cost of flying for young families and possibly
force them to travel by automobile on shorter routes. They say
automobile travel poses greater risks per mile than flying.
   A Harvard Medical School statistical study in the early 1980s
theorized that three infants might be saved over five years if all
children used safety seats on airliners.
   But two recent crashes in which unrestrained infants were killed
have led to more support for mandatory restraints. Two of the five
unsecured children aboard United Flight 232 that crashed in Iowa
last July died, and at least one unseated child was killed aboard
the Avianca airliner that crashed in New York in January.
   The NTSB proposal would prevent children under 40 inches or 40
pounds from flying without car seats approved for airliner use.
   The safety board proposal, in keying on size and weight of the
child rather than age, also could lead to required seats for small
children older than 2 who now are allowed to use ordinary seat
belts, said board senior investigator Nora Marshall.
   The board also called for a study to develop a more effective
restraint for children just over 40 pounds or 40 inches tall who
may not be fully protected by ordinary seat belts.
   ``It seems time to provide protection for those children who up
until now have been unprotected,'' said Kolstad after the board
vote.
   Asked if the possible increased cost for travelers could be
justified, Kolstad said, ``I don't think the cost of protecting an
infant's life is too much to ask.''
   He said the practice of allowing infants to fly in parents' laps
is ``a hole in the law ... an oversight we think needs to be
corrected.''

   Police trying to disperse demonstrations by
tens of thousands of Palestinians today killed a 14-year-old boy in
a northern city, witnesses said. A hospital said a man was killed
at another rally.
   Government officials acknowledged only one death.
   At least 23 protesters were reported wounded in the nationwide
demonstrations that protested the killing of seven Palestinian
laborers Sunday by an Israeli gunman near Tel Aviv.
   In the Baqaa refugee camp northwest of Amman, about 7,000
Palestinians clashed with riot police, burned tires and blocked
highways following a police crackdown on protesters the night
before.
   One resident said at least 13 people were wounded and that at
least eight armored vehicles entered the camp, firing live
ammunition in the air in an attempt to disperse demonstrators.
   An official at Jordan University Hospital near Amman said Majed
Hubeid, 19, died of gunshot wounds minutes after he was brought to
the hospital from Baqaa. Relatives also reported he died, but the
Interior Ministry did not acknowledge the death.
   Security officials in Irbid, 45 miles north of Amman, said
police attempted to disperse 15,000 demonstrators who were trying
to reach nearby Yarmouk University.
   Residents reached by telephone, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said a 14-year-old boy was shot and killed by police. It
was not immediately clear whether the boy was Palestinian.
   The demonstrators, mainly youths, marched through the city and
tossed firebombs at police, who in turn fired back with live
ammunition, witnesses said.
   The security officials, who cannot be named under police rules,
said at least 10 people were injured and one said he saw several
with ``blood on their bodies or their faces.''
   Police sealed off all roads leading to Zarqa, 18 miles north of
Amman, Zarqa, where at least 10,000 Palestinians staged protests.
   The six major Palestinian refugee camps around the country
staged a day of mourning and all businesses and shops were closed
in support of a Sunday call by the underground leadership of the
Palestinian uprising in the Israeli-occupied territories.
   In Amman, at least 20,000 Jordanian students, including Islamic
fundamentalists, demonstrated on the Jordan University campus
protesting Israeli killings of Palestinians.
   Roughly half of Jordan's 3.1 million people come from
Palestinian families who fled or were driven out of the homeland
during the 1948 and 1967 Arab-Israeli wars.
   Hospital officials in Amman said four French tourists wounded in
an attack by a Palestinian Monday were recovering and were likely
to be discharged within days.
   The Palestinian boarded a tour bus with a dagger and pistol and
shot or stabbed 10 people, police said. They said he was out to
avenge the deaths of the seven Palestinians in Israel, but did not
elaborate.

<TEXT>
   Members of the United Auto Workers won't
ratify new contracts this fall unless they include cost-of-living
protection for retirees' benefits, a local union leader warns.
   But about 2,000 delegates attending a three-day UAW bargaining
convention today rejected an effort this morning to call for such
inflation adjustments in a resolution.
   A procedural motion to introduce the resolution fell short of
the needed 329 votes on a show of hands.
   Alex Wassell of Local 1776 in Willow Run, Mich., said he was
disappointed that his move didn't work. He said he didn't believe
UAW President Owen Bieber's statement that the issue would be
carried to bargaining tables this summer anyway.
   In his opening speech Monday, Bieber outlined a five-point
bargaining plan for contracts to be negotiated this summer with
General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. It called
for inflation protection for hundreds of thousands of retirees, but
Bieber declined to say exactly how retiree benefits should be
protected.
   He said: ``I can tell you absolutely that we will achieve the
goals we all share of improving current benefit levels and ensuring
that those gains are protected against inflation in future years.''
   For the first time in 11 years, UAW contracts with the Big Three
expire at the same moment _ midnight, Sept. 14. Contract talks
begin after Independence Day.
   In the past, company executives and union officials have said
cost-of-living adjustments, or COLAs, could be extremely expensive
and could trigger benefit cuts for active workers. COLA backers say
lump-sum payments have been eaten up by inflation.
   Jerry Melillo, a local president at Ford's Cleveland engine
plant, warned, ``We have to come back with COLA in '90 to get
ratification of the agreements.''
   Inflation protection for retirees is attracting more attention
in the union for several reasons. The average age of UAW members at
the Big Three automakers is about 45, and many workers are
approaching retirement.
   Also, there are nearly as many retirees as active workers. The
UAW contracts with the Big Three cover about 500,000 workers.
   Bieber ticked off a list of priorities. Topping the list, as
expected, is job and income security, followed by wage and benefit
increases, maintenance of health care benefits, help for retirees
and more responsible management.

   The Army used an awards ceremony at
Fort Bragg to take the wraps off a secret, barge-based helicopter
unit that has been operating in the Persian Gulf for 2{ years.
   The unit, Task Force 118, will soon become part of the 82nd
Airborne Division, said Lt. Col. Ed Hughes, the unit's commander.
   ``We're glad we can talk about it now,'' Hughes said.
   Twenty-five members were honored Monday for their roles in
creating the unit, developing its equipment and for action in the
Persian Gulf against Iranian gunboats.
   Chief Warrant Officer Gregory Hunter Odum was responsible for
creating or finding much of the sophisticated equipment used by the
unit in its secret missions, Hughes said.
   Odum said most of the equipment was modified from what is
normally used by the military, although some was bought
commercially. The commercial equipment included an underwater
breathing bottle and 30-foot caving ladders, light aluminum roll-up
wire ladders that can be suspended below a helocpter and used for
picking up downed crews.
   ``The unit uses heavily modified OH-58D helicopters _ the most
sophisticated and advanced helicopter in the Army today,'' Odum
said.
   Originally designed as a light, unarmed scout helicopter, the
OH-58 was upgraded in the mid-1980s with improved night observation
equipment that gives the helicopter a distinctive ball on top of
the rotor.
   The armed version of the helicopter was developed in less than
four months when the Navy asked for help escorting tankers in the
Persian Gulf. The Navy's shipboard helicopters do not have
comparable night-fighting equipment.
   In addition to 2.75-inch rockets, the armed OH-58D can carry
pods on pylons on each side the helicopter that are armed with
Hellfire air-to-surface missiles, Stinger anti-aircraft missiles or
.50-caliber machine guns, Odum said.
   The two-man flight crews fly almost exclusively at night with
night-vision equipment and mostly over water _ the most difficult
conditions to fly with night-vision equipment.
   ``We had to keep our guys rotated out regularly to reduce the
stress,'' Odum said.

   Here are some facts and figures on the Republic of Yemen, which
was created Tuesday by the merger of North Yemen and South Yemen:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE LAND _ Yemen spans 203,645 square miles on the southwestern
edge of the Arabian Peninsula and has borders with Saudi Arabia and
Oman. The country controls the Bab al-Mandab strait, the strategic
gateway to the Red Sea. The north is mainly mountainous, with a
narow coastal strip on the Red Sea. The south has a sandy coastline
along the Gulf of Aden backed by barren mountains.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE PEOPLE _ Yemen has 11 million people. They are mainly
tribal, and the main religion is Sunni Islam. A few hundred Jews
live in the north, and there are small communities of Christians
and Hindus in the south.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   THE ECONOMY _ Yemen is among the poorest nations in the world,
but newly discovered oil reserves could change that. Unofficial
estimates say the reserves could amount to as much as 2 billion
barrels.
   The south depended heavily on aid from the Soviet bloc, but the
collapse of communism in eastern Europe apparently prompted the
south to drop its Marxist policies and agreed to a merger. The
major activities in the south are the refinery of Aden, the city's
port and fishing.
   Money from millions of Yemenis working outside their country,
mainly in the oil-rich gulf, and from foreign aid helped prop up
the economy of the conservative pro-Western north for years.
Farming is the main activity in the region, and crops include
wheat, sorghum, coffee, tobacco and cotton.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   HISTORY _ By merging, the north and south regained their former
status as part of ancient Arabia Felix and the kingdom of Sheba
that lasted for 800 years until the 2nd century B.C.
   For the next 800 years it was ruled by the Himyarites, one of
the earliest Arab tribes, then by Ethiopians and Persians until
Islam arrived in the 7th century.
   In 1517 South Yemen became part of the Ottoman Empire. Britain
seized Aden in 1839 and the surrounding territory later became a
British protectorate.
   Aden won independence in 1967 after a terrorist campaign, and
South Yemen became the Arab world's only self-proclaimed Marxist
state.
   The northern country, the Yemen Arab Republic, was established
in 1962 after an Egyptian-backed revolution ousted the Saudi
Arabian-backed imam.

   Prosecutors asked a judge today to change the
wording of an indictment against an art gallery displaying Robert
Mapplethorpe photographs so it would conform to obscenity standards
set by the U.S. Supreme Court.
   Hamilton County Municipal Judge David Albanese said he would
consider the request and would see the exhibit before it closes
Saturday at the Contemporary Arts Center.
   Frank H. Prouty Jr., the senior assistant city prosecutor, said
the city wants the indictment to specify that photographs in the
exhibit include ``a lewd, graphic exhibition of the genitals.''
   That wording would make the indictment conform to a Supreme
Court decision establishing criteria for obscenity.
   The 175-photo exhibition includes five photos of sex acts and
two photos of nude children. The indictment, issued on April 7,
refers to the two children's genitals only as being exposed.
   H. Louis Sirkin, the art gallery's lawyer, said he will oppose
the city's request because the judge should not have the power to
alter a grand jury's indictment.
   Sirkin has asked the judge to dismiss the charges, arguing that
Mapplethorpe's photographs are legitimate works of art. He also
contends that authorities unfairly singled out the gallery and its
director for prosecution.
   The gallery and director Dennis Barrie are charged with
pandering obscenity and using children in material involving
nudity, both misdemeanors.
   If convicted, both face $6,000 in fines, and Barrie faces six
months in jail.
   More than 67,000 people have seen the exhibit since it opened
April 6 with a showing to members only. It opened to the public the
next day, when the indictment was returned.
   Sirkin raised his arguments against the charges in motions filed
Friday.
   He called Ohio's obscenity statute vague, and said grand jurors
may not have been told that the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that
pictures found to have artistic value can't be ruled obscene.
   ``For any one of the issues raised in the motions, I think the
case should be dismissed,'' Sirkin said. ``I think the most
important are the selective prosecution and the motion to dismiss
based on lack of prior judicial determination of probable cause.''
   Sirkin's motion notes that prosecutors took no action against
Cincinnati's Taft Museum for earlier displaying some of the
pictures mentioned in the indictment.
   The photographs also are available in books at the Hamilton
County library and at the University of Cincinnati, the motion
says. It also notes that the Tyler-Davidson Fountain, a downtown
landmark, includes a statue of a nude boy.

   Sitting Bull's buckskin tobacco pouch is
being sent to Montana, the Sioux chief's home.
   Jackson resident George Turpin, who inherited the pouch from
family members who lived in Montana in the late 19th century, has
agreed to donate it to the Montana State Historical Society Museum
in Helena.
   The 80-year-old man said he's happy to get the bag off his hands.
   ``I'm ready to stop thinking about Sitting Bull. I've started
dreaming about that Indian,'' he said Tuesday.
   The pouch, decorated with tiny, colorful beads, was given by
Sitting Bull to Molly Bailey, the wife of Turpin's
great-great-uncle, Will Bailey.
   Sitting Bull was the victor of the Battle of the Little Bighorn
in 1876.
   Museum curator Kirby Lambert said the pouch will be added to the
Native American section of its permanent ``Montana Homeland''
collection.

   Congress is going after the gasoline in your
car's fuel tank as lawmakers try to clean up the nation's
smog-clogged air.
   What the fuel of the future will be is unclear, but one thing
seems certain: Something other than conventional gasoline will run
the car of the late '90s.
   Tougher auto pollution controls that will be included in clear
air legislation now before Congress for the first time not only
requires new control technology on automobiles, but demands that
oil companies change the chemistry of their gasoline so the fuel
burns cleaner.
   Smog-causing pollutants will be reduced, as will toxic emissions.
   The bills also are being crafted to open the way for an array of
gasoline alternatives, including alcohol fuel blends such as
methanol and ethanol and in some cases pure methanol, compressed
natural gas or propane.
   Proponents of the various fuels are lobbying intensely for
provisions that might give them an edge.
   The oil industry has spent $1 million in recent months for a
thus-far unsuccessful effort to thwart provisions that could
require ethanol blended gasoline in some of the largest cities that
account for more than a fifth of the nation's gasoline market.
   The legislation already approved by the Senate and a similar
version coming to a vote this week in the House will require that
gasoline meet tougher emission standards.
   The petroleum industry hopes to meet those requirements by
reworking the gasoline's chemistry so that aromatics, the chemicals
that boost octane, are replaced by cleaner additives.
   Some oil companies, including ARCO and Shell, already have begun
selling reformulated gasoline in some limited markets.
   Some members of Congress say that doesn't go far enough.
   A compromise agreement announced in the House this week requires
even cleaner fuels to be sold in areas with serious smog problems.
   The provisions, similar to one in the Senate bill, require
reformulated gasoline to have a certain oxygen content _ likely to
be achieved by adding ethanol _ if it is sold in nine cities with
the greatest smog problems and in 44 cities with excessive levels
of carbon monoxide during some months of the year.
   ``It will not ony clean up the nation's air but give credibility
to the growing ethanol industry,'' said Rep. Bill Richardson,
D-N.M., sponsor of the amendment.
   Some estimates say the provisions could more than double the
demand for ethanol, which is made from grain.
   The oil industry argues the government should not impose a
recipe for motor fuels and has vigorously fought not only efforts
to require the use of ethanol, but also methanol, another
alternative fuel derived from natural gas.
   Automakers say they are developing cars that run on methanol
blends, a mixture of as much as 85 percent methanol and 15 percent
gasoline.
   However, both the auto and oil industries are opposed to pushing
too quickly the sale of vehicles that burn only fuels other than
gasoline.
   The House this week will consider an amendment to the clean air
bill by Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., that would require automakers
by 1997 to build 1 million cars a year powered by a fuel other than
gasoline and sell them in the nine cities with the worst smog
problems.
   Those cities are Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, San Diego,
Philadelphia, Baltimore, New York City, Hartford, Conn., and
Milwaukee.
   President Bush made a similar suggestion a year ago, but the
White House backed away from the production mandate under intense
pressure from the auto industry. Attempts to impose such a mandate
failed in the Senate, but both environmentalists and auto lobbyists
say the House vote could be close.
   The aim is to cut total smog-causing emissions from those cars
by 75 percent, a requirement the auto industry says can only be
achieved by making cars that run either entirely on methanol or on
compressed natural gas.
   The automakers have vigorously fought a production requirement
for alternative fuel cars, fearful that consumers may not buy them
because of concern about reliability and the availability of fuels.
   ``We're talking about 30 or 40 percent of the vehicles sold (in
the nine cities). ... It's a preposterous notion,'' said Robert
Liberatore, a lobbyist for the Chrysler Corp.
   Oil companies fear losing market share in a $100 billion annual
gasoline business to the natural gas industry if the Congress
requires production of cars that can't meet emission standards by
burning even reformulated gasoline.

   The House voted 403-20 today for legislation
prohibiting discrimination against disabled Americans.
   The Americans with Disabilities Act goes to House and Senate
negotiators after the Memorial Day recess to work out the one major
difference in the two versions.
   The difference is a House amendment, passed 199-187 last week,
to let employers re-assign AIDS-infected workers to keep them from
handling food.
   Opponents say the amendment would allow discrimination against
one group of people despite overwhelming medical evidence that AIDS
is not transmitted through such casual contact.
   President Bush has urged speedy passage of the bill, aimed at
doing for disabled Americans what the Civil Rights Act of 1964 set
out to do for blacks and other minorities: guarantee access to
jobs, businesses, services, transportation and telecommunications.
   Supporters say at least one American in six _ 43 million _ is
disabled.
   Prior to passage, the House 227-192 to defeat an amendment
limiting the remedies disabled workers could seek from employers
who willfully discriminate. The White House supported that
amendment.
   Among key provisions of the bill:
   _Discrimination in hiring and on the job would be prohibited.
The requirement would be phased in over two to four years,
depending on the size of the company. Companies with fewer than 15
employees would be exempt.
   _Hotels, restaurants, shopping malls, drug stores, and business
and professional offices, along with any other ``public
accommodation,'' would have to make themselves accessible to
disabled people. Accessibility includes structural adjustments,
such as wheelchair ramps and widened doors, and services.
   _Transportation, public and private, would have to be made
accessible. Fixed-route bus systems would have to be accessible for
people with wheelchairs. Special facilities would be available for
people with other disabilities who cannot use regular transit.
Amtrak, Greyhound, and commuter rail systems are covered.
Timetables for implementation vary according to system.
   _ People with speech and hearing impairments would have access
to telephone service by means of relay services. These services
would have to be provided by phone companies within three years.

   Firefighters went on strike Tuesday
afternoon for higher wages, briefly stopping cars and taxis trying
to enter the city, witnesses said.
   The walkout followed similar strikes in the past week by
soldiers and police, who returned to work only after being promised
better pay.
   Salaries for state employees have been frozen for eight years as
President Felix Houphouet-Boigny's government struggles to pay
bills.
   In March, Houphouet-Boigny, Africa's longest-serving president,
tried to impose wage cuts and new taxes. Violent protests forced
the withdrawal of the measures, and the president had to give in to
demands to permit opposition parties.
   Last week, mutinous soldiers occupied the nation's international
airport for eight hours to demand better pay. Police demonstrated
Monday, also demanding improved pay and working conditions.
   Other workers, including bus drivers and shipyard employees,
have also gone on strike.

   A woman who accused journalist Hunter S.
Thompson of sexual assault leveled allegations of drug abuse
against the writer during a court hearing today.
   The testimony from Gail Palmer-Slater, 35, came during a
pretrial hearing for Thompson, who faces five felonies and three
misdeamor charges.
   Ms. Palmer-Slater, of Port Huron, Mich., testified that she saw
Thompson plunge his nose into a pile of white powder at his
secluded mountain home and later boast of a ready supply of cocaine.
   She testified Thompson never offered her drugs and admitted
under cross-examination that she had no proof the white powder
actually was cocaine.
   Thompson was fidgety during the morning testimony and at times
leaned over to one of his attorneys and whispered loudly, ``Bull,
that's bull.''
   Thompson, 53, was charged after the alleged sexual attack in
February prompted a two-day search of his home that turned up
narcotics and dynamite.
   His fight against the charges was expected to hinge on questions
about the validity of the the extensive search.
   The writer whose chronicle of the Hell's Angels, accounts of
political campaigns and shark hunts in Hawaii vaulted him to
literary stardom in the 1960s and 1970s, pleaded innocent to the
three misdemeanor charges April 9.
   At the hearing, Pitkin County District Judge Charles Buss was to
evaluate evidence behind the five felony charges, including three
drug possession counts, one charge of using cocaine and one charge
of possessing explosives.
   Thompson's defense was expected to question the validity of the
extensive search.
   The misdemeanors include third-degree sexual assault,
third-degree simple assault, and possession of marijuana.
   The charges stem from a complaint by Ms. Palmer-Slater, a
businesswoman and former X-rated movie actress, who claimed
Thompson threw a drink at her, twisted her breast and shoved her
during a visit to his home on Feb. 21. She contended that he became
angry when she refused to conduct a business discussion in his hot
tub.
   Thompson claims he never assaulted the woman. He told reporters
the woman was drunk and allegedly was pressuring him to have sex
with her when he pushed her away.
   Searches Feb. 26 and Feb. 27 resulted from her complaint. Police
say they found a small amount of cocaine, more than an ounce of
marijuana, 39 LSD tablets, the tranquilizer diazepam, four sticks
of dynamite and several blasting caps.
   Thompson, who lives in nearby Woody Creek, could receive a
maximum of 16 years if convicted of all eight charges, Deputy
District Attorney Charles McCrory has said. The writer is free on
$2,000 bond.
   ``I stand for everything they don't like,'' Thompson said as he
left the courthouse April 9. ``It's a witch hunt.''
   Supporters who created the Hunter S. Thompson Legal Defense Fund
bought a full-page advertisement the same day in the Aspen Times
Daily that reads: ``Beware. Today: the Doctor. Tomorrow: You.''
   Thompson, whose lifestyle and exploits inspired the character
Duke in the ``Doonesbury'' comic strip, ran unsuccessfully for
Pitkin County sheriff in 1970.
   His news columns, magazine articles and books are written in a
style dubbed ``gonzo journalism,'' because they include seemingly
exaggerated accounts of his own rowdy behavior brought on by drug
and alcohol abuse.

   About 300,000 wailing mourners Tuesday
buried Kashmir's senior Islamic cleric, whose assassination
prompted some of the worst violence in the 40-year-old Moslem
secessionist movement.
   Maulvi Mohammad Farooq, the most influential opponent to Indian
rule of the mostly Moslem state, was slain Monday by three
unidentified gunmen in the Kashmiri capital, Srinagar.
   A few hours later, security forces fired on mourners who defied
a curfew to carry Farooq's body from the hospital. The gunfire
killed 58 people and wounded 300.
   Gunbattles between security forces and militants, sniper fire
and bomb blasts have become a way of life in Kashmir since India
launched a crackdown on Moslem secessionists Jan. 20. About 460
psince then, including 49 people shot by security
forces during eople have died a March 1 pro-independence march.
   All security forces were withdrawn along the route of the
funeral procession, apparently to avoid a recurrence of Monday's
violence.
   Massive crowds gathered at Islamia college, where Farooq's body
was kept overnight. More joined en route and nearly one-third of
Srinagar's population reached the Martyrs Cemetery on the city's
outskirts.
   Farooq, 45, suffered 15 bullet wounds in the assassination.

<HEAD>Bush's Expected Renewal of China Benefits Draws Democratic Rebuke</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush's expected call for renewal of
major trade benefits for China brought sharp rebukes Tuesday from
lawmakers objecting to China's human-rights policies.
   Republican leaders braced for a major new China-policy battle
after Bush told them he planned to act within the next day or two.
   ``I'm not sure I'd like to have that vote come up this
afternoon,'' House Minority Leader Bob Michel, R-Ill., said he told
the president at a morning White House meeting.
   Bush narrowly won a bruising veto fight with Congress last
winter over a bill extending visas for Chinese students.
   Michel, who supports extension of the most-favored-nation trade
benefits, said he believed the administration could overcome any
attempt by Congress to block such a move, since that would take
two-thirds majorities of both the House and Senate. But, he added,
``We haven't really taken a good temperature of the House, yet, on
that.''
   Senior administration officials, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity, said Bush would propose a one-year extension of the
most-favored-nation preferential tariff treatment for Beijing
within the next few days.
   The declaration would contain ``some conditions'' spellins Republic
will ever be satisfied by anything he does.''
   Not all Republicans supported Bush's apparent decision to renew
trade benefits.
   Rep. Mickey Edwards, R-Okla., chairman of the Republican Policy
Committee and one of the GOP members who met with Bush Tuesday,
said he's opposed to extension of most-favored-nation status for
China.
   ``I know the president thinks he has good reason ... but I'm
bothered by the idea of granting special treatment'' to China, he
said.
   Edwards said China has ``cracked down more, not less'' on human
rights since Tiananmen Square.
   Administration officials and GOP leaders said that they did not
think that a battle over the most-favored-nation issue would be as
emotional as last winter's fight _ ultimately won by Bush _ over
Chinese students.
   By a single vote, the Senate sustained Bush's veto of a bill to
extend the visas of Chinese students in the United States. Bush
argued that he was offering the Chinese students the same safe
haven through administrative actions.
   On Tuesday, the Independent Federation of Chinese Students and
Scholars asked Bush to suspend China's most-favored-nation status
to demonstrate U.S. ``commitment to democracy and human rights in
China.''
   A letter signed by three students in the group said, ``We hope
you will agree with us that the United States cannot continue
`business as usual' relationships with the current regime.''
   The federation says it represents some 40,000 students at more
than 200 universities in the United States.

<HEAD>Even If Fleet Cut, Shipbuilding Budget May Be Stable</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Navy's shipbuilding budget would have to
remain at its current level of about $11 billion annually for the
service to maintain a pared-down fleet of 488 ships, congressional
analysts said Tuesday.
   Members of the Congressional Budget Office told a Senate panel
that the Navy's publicly stated goal for 1990 is 547 ships,
including 14 aircraft carriers, four battleships and 34 ballistic
missile submarines.
   But recent published reports said civilian and military leaders
drafted spending plans that suggest 488 ships, including 12
aircraft carriers.
   Such a fleet ``would require a shipbuilding budget that, on
average, stays constant at today's level in real terms,'' Robert
Hale told the Senate Armed Services subcommittee on projection
forces and regional defense.
   The shipbuilding budget for 1990 totals $11.4 billion, the CBO
said.
   The Navy's proposed cut in its fleet comes in response to
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's orders to the service chiefs to cut
spending by 2 percent below the rate of inflation in each year from
1992 to 1997.
   Reductions in the fleet creates a need for the Navy to
reconsider its missions, the CBO said.
   ``If it has fewer ships, the Navy could reduce capability to
perform each of its missions proportionately,'' Hale said. ``That
might mean proportional reductions in submarines that provide
strategic deterrence, ships that provide power projection by
attacking targets on land and ships that provide sea control.''
   Questioned by lawmakers about the Navy's priorities, Gerald
Cann, an assistant secretary of the Navy, declined to provide
specifics but noted Cheney's current review of the planned purchase
of the Seawolf SSN-21 submarine and the DDG-51 guided-missile
destroyer.
   Cann also said the negotiations on the services' spending plans,
submitted to Cheney on May 1, will ``address the character and size
of the Navy.''
   ``When all is said and done, we are still a maritime nation,''
Cann said.

<HEAD>Relocating an Embassy Proves Difficult for U.S. in Kuwait</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States wants a new,
attack-proof embassy compound in Kuwait, but acquiring one is
turning out to be a diplomatic headache.
   The present compound, bounded by a hotel and the waters of the
Persian Gulf, has been deemed a security risk. Also, the landlord
does not want to renew the lease.
   But replacing it could cost $32 million for the land alone _ a
price tag that is raising eyebrows in Washington. Relocation
efforts are further complicated by Kuwait's ban on real estate
purchases by foreigners.
   The compound, which contains the ambassador's residence and the
embassy, was fortified after Shiite Moslem terrorists rammed a
bomb-laden truck into its gates in December l983.
   Despite safeguards including concrete blockades and a high
barbed-wire fence that is electrified at some points, security is
``not exactly airtight,'' said an Arab diplomat, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   The site was rented in the early 1950s from a landlord who is a
ruling emir of one of the gulf states, according to sources. Now a
boom has driven the land's value up to an estimated $13 million,
and the landlord has given notice that the lease will not be
renewed when it expires in 1995.
   Some lawmakers say even if the lease weren't coming up, security
concerns alone would justify a new mission.
   Rep. Mervyn Dymally, D-Calif., chairman of the House Foreign
Affairs subcommittee on international operations, recently traveled
to Kuwait.
   He told a congressional panel the compound is a ``ripe target
for terrorist activities'' and that he would have had a clear shot
at the No. 2 embassy official from his hotel room.
   Kuwait is significant to the United States on several counts,
and the embassy's job reflects that. Its staff of 80 people _ about
half of them military _ is the second-largest U.S. diplomatic
mission in the Persian Gulf region, after Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.
   Kuwait is involved in an issue of key importance to the United
States, that of Western hostages in Lebanon. The release of 15
pro-Iranian convicts held in Kuwaiti jails is one of the
pro-Iranian kidnappers' demands.
   The 15 were jailed for their role in bombings of the U.S. and
French embassies, along with the international airport and other
public utilities in Kuwait, in 1983.
   In addition, five Kuwaiti oil tankers fly the American flag, a
protection extended to 11 of Kuwait's 22 U.S.-registered tankers
during the Iran-Iraq war, when attacks on gulf shipping were made
by both sides.
   Kuwait is also a major oil supplier, and an importer of
U.S.-build warplanes and military hardware.
   Whenever possible, the State Department prefers to own rather
than rent embassy compounds. But technically, no foreigners are
allowed to buy real estate in Kuwait, under laws that took effect
after independence in 1961.
   Diplomats reached by telephone in Kuwait said it was not clear
if the government would bend the rules and grant the Americans
dispensation to buy land. Even if they do, the State Department
says land costs in Kuwait are among the world's highest, and the
necessary 14 acres would run about $32 million.
   Despite the obstacles, negotiations are apparently still in
progress.
   State Department lawyers and other experts have been quietly
traveling to Kuwait to check out prospective property and work on
other details.
   Through it all, the embassy is maintaining a diplomatic silence.
Embassy public affairs officer Alberto Fernandez declined to make
any statement.
   ``We're not allowed to comment on these matters,'' he said.

<HEAD>Minorities Underrepresented in Peace Corps, Congress Told</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MERRILL HARTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Peace Corps, nearly 30 years after its
founding by President John F. Kennedy, suffers from lingering
perceptions it is a white middle-class institution, Congress was
told Tuesday.
   Only about 7 percent of the agency's roughly 6,300 volunteers
are minorities, a congressional investigative agency found. And
through 1988, no minorities held any of the top 20 management jobs
at the agency.
   ``Efforts to improve the Peace Corps' minority profile in the
past have been short-lived and costly,'' the General Accounting
Office said. It called for a long-term strategy to correct the
problem.
   The underrepresentation of minorities in the Peace Corps has
made it difficult for the agency to teach foreign peoples about the
racially diverse American culture, the study said.
   Congressional researchers acknowledged, however, that the Peace
Corps ``has historically experienced great difficulty attracting
sufficient number of minorities to serve as volunteers.''
   Part of the problem stems from the lower economic status of
blacks and other minorities, the study said, who ``believe that
they cannot afford to volunteer two years of their lives to Peace
Corps service.''
   But it said that minorities also ``tend to see the Peace Corps
as a white middle-class organization.''
   Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., chairman of a House Government
Operations subcommittee examining the Peace Corps program, said the
agency ``must work toward better portraying the United States to
the people of the beneficiary countries by providing opportunities
to ethnic and racial groups which would represent the amalgamation
of our many rich cultures.''
   The GAO report, released as the House panel held a public
hearing, also said the agency was failing to meet a 1985
congressional mandate to build its volunteer force to 10,000.
   During its heyday, the Peace Corps in the mid-1960s had a
volunteer force as high as 16,000 and a $114 million annual budget,
but the agency was given less money and saw its volunteer force
shrink to 5,000 at the start of the 1980s.
   By this fall, the GAO report said, the agency expects to have
6,700 volunteers in 76 countries.
   Several lawmakers noted that President Bush sought a 9 percent
increase in the agency's fiscal 1991 budget. But they said more
will be needed if the Peace Corps is to move people swiftly into
Eastern Europe while continuing a heavy presence in Third World
nations.
   ``If we expect the Peace Corps to meet the challenges and
increasing responsibilities ahead, then we need to ensure that the
appropriate resources are available for the agency to realize its
goals,'' said Conyers.
   Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., a former Peace Corps volunteer
who appeared as a witness before the subcommittee, said the agency
has received requests for volunteers from Hungary, Poland,
Czechoslovakia, Romania and East Germany.
   ``The Peace Corps needs the resources to respond to these
requests from Eastern Europe,'' he said, ``but it cannot rob other
parts of the world to accommodate an area of the world to which the
Peace Corps has not previously been invited.''

   Mary Nelson wept Tuesday at the grave of
her best friend Casey, near the tombs of Miss Kitty, Snowball and
nearly 20,000 other dear departed pets.
   Nelson and other animal lovers gathered at the Bonheur Memorial
Park cemetery for the unveiling of the Tomb of the Unknown Pets,
honoring the thousands of stray or abused pets that die every year.
   The tomb is marked by a fountain and a bronze plaque that reads:
``The Unknown Pets. For the Millions of Lost and Abandoned Pets A
Final Resting Place.''
   Jerry Rosenbaum, Bonheur's operator and caretaker, devised the
idea of the tomb and planned the unveiling to coincide with Be Kind
To Animals Month.
   Pets of all sorts have been buried in the 12-acre cemetery,
including goldfish, police dogs, horses and Mary Ann, an elephant
given to the city of Baltimore in 1925.
   The grounds are dotted with eternal flames lit in remembrance,
as well as flowers, squeaky toys and statues of dogs and cats.
   At the unveiling of the tomb for the unknown, spectators also
remembered their own.
   ``He was born in my hands and he died in my hands. He was truly
my best friend,'' a tearful Nelson said of Casey, a champion boxer,
who was buried in August under a rose-colored marble headstone.
   Joyce Williams, whose mutt Dixie was buried at Bonheur just a
few weeks ago, took the day off from work to pay her respects.
   ``Our babies were all grown up. We didn't have anymore little
children. He was our baby,'' Williams said, wiping away tears.
   Bonheur cemetery, 10 miles southeast of Baltimore, was named for
Rosa Bonheur, a 19th century artist who painted and sculpted
animals.
   Inscriptions on the gravestones remember well-loved pets with
words like, ``Our precious baby'' and ``A gift from God. We will
always miss you.''
   ``Pets are strictly buried for love,'' said Rosenbaum, who took
over the cemetery's lease six years ago and runs it with his wife,
Winnette. ``The pets are here for the people to be happy, to live
their memories.''
   ``Pets give you an unconditional love, not because of what you
have, but because you are you,'' he said. ``This is a quiet place
where they can forget about their work and their problems and
remember their pets.''
   Human interments were first allowed at Bonheur in 1977, and
about 100 plots have been reserved by people who want to rest close
to their pets, Rosenbaum said.
   Elizabeth Kirk, president of the local chapter of the Animal
Welfare League, has buried 18 of her pets at Bonheur, and reserved
a place for herself.
   ``People just don't seem to realize that animals and children
are alike,'' said Kirk, who brought along two dogs she adopted.
``They trust in the larger human to take care of them and not abuse
them.''

<HEAD>China Buys More Subsidized Wheat</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Bush-China, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   China has bought an additional 399,350 metric
tons of U.S. wheat under a price subsidy program, the Agriculture
Department said Tuesday.
   Christopher E. Goldthwaite, acting general sales manager for the
department's Foreign Agricultural Service, said seven private
exporting companies made the deals under the department's Export
Enhancement Program, or EEP.
   Delivery of the wheat is scheduled for July and August, he said.
   The sales were part of 2 million tons authorized China under EEP
on May 2. Previous allocations had been exhausted except for 5,050
tons.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels
of wheat. The latest sales would be about 14.7 million bushels. At
current prices estimated by USDA at around $3.36 per bushel, the
wheat would have a farm value of around $49 million.
   Under EEP arrangements, private exporters can sell U.S.
commodities at reduced prices to meet foreign competition in
selected overseas markets and then collect free government
surpluses of grain or other commodities as bonuses, or subsidies.
   Goldthwaite said the latest subsidies averaged $11.20 per ton,
or about 31 cents per bushel.
   The subsidized sales were handled by Louis Dreyfus Corp.,
155,000 tons; Alfred C. Toepfer International Inc., 50,000;
Tradigrain Inc., 49,750; J. Aron and Co., 45,000; Continental Grain
Co., 39,600; Bunge Corp., 30,000; and Ferruzzi U.S.A. Inc., 30,000.
   With the latest sales, China has bought about 1.4 million tons
of U.S. wheat for delivery in the 1990-91 wheat marketing year that
will begin June 1, compared with 5.7 million tons in 1989-90.

<HEAD>Union Makes Return-to-Work Offer</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Striking Greyhound drivers offered to return
to work Tuesday in a legal maneuver that could make the company
liable for $10 million a month in back pay.
   Greyhound called the offer ``part of the game'' in the
3-month-old strike and said it did not expect to immediately rehire
striking union drivers.
   The union's return-to-work offer stems from a ruling last week
by the chief investigator for the National Labor Relations Board,
who authorized the filing of unfair labor practice charges against
Greyhound.
   If upheld, the charges would mean that Greyhound would have to
give union members back then workers
with infectious diseases so they wouldn't be allowed to handled
food.
   Opponents said the amendment was a setback for AIDS sufferers,
who are protected under the Disabilities Act. The bill already
exempts from protection anyone whose disease endangers others. AIDS
is spread through intimate sexual contact or by contaminated
hypodermic needles or by blood.
   Among key provisions of the bill:
   _discrimination against the disabled in hiring and on the job
would be prohibited. The requirement would be phased in over two to
four years, depending on the size of the company. Companies with
fewer than 15 employers would be exempt.
   _Hotels, restaurants, shopping malls, drug stores, and business
and professional offices, along with any other ``public
accommodations,'' would have to be accessible to disabled people.
Accessibility includes structural adjustments, such as wheelchair
ramps and widened doors, and services.
   _Transportation, public and private, would have to be
accessible. Fixed-route bus systems would have to be accessible for
people with wheelchairs. Amtrak, Greyhound, and commuter rail
systems are covered. Timetables for implementation vary according
to system.
   _Speech- and hearing-impaired people would have access to
telephone service by means of relay services. These services would
have to be provided by phone companies within three years.
   Voting against the bill were:
   Reps. Bill Archer, R-Texas; Richard Armey, R-Texas; Joe Barton,
R-Texas, Herb Bateman, R-Va.; Dan Burton, R-Ind.; Jim Cooper,
D-Tenn.; Philip Crane, R-Ill.; William Dannemeyer, R-Calif.; Tom

   Hundreds of Hezbollah members burned
effigies of the Israeli prime minister as well as the U.S.,
Jordanian and Saudi Arabian leaders to protest the weekend slaying
of Palestinian laborers by an Israeli.
   With shouts of ``the spiteful America is the cause of the
world's misfortunes!'' the crowd wound its way past garbage piles
in the dusty alleys of Beirut's southern suburbs.
   The pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, is believed to be
the umbrella group for extremist Shiite Moslem factions who hold
most of the 16 foreign hostages in Lebanon.
   The march came three days after an Israeli gunman killed seven
unarmed Palestinian workers near Tel Aviv.
   An Israeli judge ordered psychiatric tests for the suspect, Ami
Popper. Israeli police said the gunman was ``deranged'' and upset
over a breakup with his girlfriend, but Arabs accused the Israeli
government of creating an atmosphere that led to the slayings.
   ``Both the Zionist entity and world arrogance committed the
massacre in the name of a madman,'' said Hezbollah cleric Sheik
Naim Kassem.
   The demonstration was led by a group of boys, aged eight to 13,
carrying pictures of Iran's late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini pasted
on pieces of cardboard. They also carried colorful flags inscribed,
``We are at your disposal, oh Khomeini.''
   Schools and businesses in the Palestinian refugee camps in the
southern ports of Sidon and Tyre went on strike to protest the
killings.
   About 125 Palestinians visited the International Committee of
the Red Cross in Tyre and asked the organization to relay a message
to U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar. The message
demanded ``intervention by the ICRC and the U.N. to stop the
massacres committed against our people in the Occupied
Territories.''
   In Beirut, the marchers burned cardboard effigies mounted on
wooden poles depicting President Bush, Jordan's King Hussein, Saudi
Arabia's King Fahd and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev took another step toward
dialogue with the Baltics on Tuesday by meeting with the Estonian
and Latvian presidents, but he stuck to his hard line against
independence, reports said.
   Lithuania, struggling with an economic blockade the Kremlin
imposed to weaken its independence campaign, said gasoline sales
for private cars would be banned as of Wednesday.
   The Soviet president, who met last week with Lithuania's prime
minister, sat down for 20 minutes with presidents Anatoly Gorbunov
of Latvia and Arnold Ruutel of Estonia, the Estonian News Service
reported.
   Gorbachev reportedly told the Latvian and Estonian leaders the
same thing he told Lithuania's Kazimiera Prunskiene: the Baltic
republics must either suspend or revoke their declarations of
independence.
   The Estonian News Service, an independent information agency,
quoted Ruutel as saying there was a common understanding of the
need for dialogue, but he characterized the meeting as
``unpleasant'' for both sides.
   He did not elaborate but told Interfax, another independent news
service, that each side stuck to its opinion and refused to budge.
   Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia are in varying stages of efforts
to restore the independence they enjoyed before the Soviet Union
forcibly annexed them 50 years ago. The Kremlin has declared the
independence declarations illegal. It imposed a blockade of oil,
gas, and other supplies on Lithuania, which led the independence
movement with its March 11 declaration.
   At the Kremlin meeting Tuesday, Gorbachev repeated his view that
the Baltics' independence declarations violate the Soviet
Constitution, the Estonian report said.
   Elsewhere in the Kremlin, a Lithuanian legislator told one of
the two chambers of the Supreme Soviet that the blockade against
his republic is ``not only immoral but illegal.'' Eduardas Vilkas
said the sanctions had cost Lithuania a quarter of a billion rubles
in lost production but had also cost the Soviet Union several
billion rubles in Lithuanian products it did not receive. He
demanded the blockade be lifted and his republic be compensated.
   Legislators in Lithuania debated measures on holding the economy
together during the blockade as well as an approach toward Moscow,
the parliament's information bureau reported. No decisions were
made.
   So far, Lithuanian lawmakers have refused to suspend the
independence decree but have offered to consider rescinding other
measures aimed at implementing the declaration.
   Starting Wednesday, gasoline will be sold in Lithuania only for
ambulances, police cars, fire trucks, food trucks, armored cars,
hearses and agricultural equipment, Algirdas Brazauskas, head of
the government's anti-blockade committee, told parliament. Some gas
will be available for limited public transport, Brazauskas said.
   Private cars had been limited to 2{ gallons a month.
   Brazauskas also announced what he called ``one of the most
difficult decisions in these days,'' that small oil- and coal-fired
power plants would be closed starting Thursday because of the fuel
shortage.
   At a seminar in Stockholm on Baltic independence, Lithuanian
Vice President Ceslovas Stankevicius said townspeople may be
evacuated to the countryside to conserve energy and food. He said
22,000 people had lost their jobs because of the month-old embargo.
   A strike by pro-Moscow forces in Estonia was in its second day,
with workers at two more plants joining the protest against the
republic's independence drive, a strike committee spokesman said.
   The Tass news agency said the strike spread to coal mines,
shipyards and the Krengolmskaya manufacturing mills, the republic's
largest light industry enterprise.
   Tass said 21 businesses were on strike.
   The strikers demanded Ruutel resign and the parliament rescind
laws challenging Soviet authority, said Viktor Tsunya, a member of
the anti-independence Russian Strike Committee.
   Tass said the workers want pro-Moscow legislators to set up an
alternate government.
   Finnish radio reported a strike among members of Estonia' ethnic
Russian minority had prompted the owners of the Baltic ferry boat
``Georg Ots'' to suspend service between the Finnish capital of
Helsinki and Tallinn, the Estonian capital.
   An assistant U.S. Commerce Department secretary said the Bush
administration ``hopes the Soviet Union will end its economic
blockade of Lithuania and begin a productive dialogue with the
Lithuanian people.''
   The official, Thomas J. Duesterberg, was in Moscow for talks
with Soviet trade officials.

   The hard-line policies of Prime Minister
Yitzhak Shamir have created an atmosphere of hatred that incites
anti-Arab violence such as the slaying of seven Palestinian workers
by an Israeli, Palestinians say.
   They charge that Israel's ``iron fist'' handling of the
29-month-old Palestinian uprising, and the government's failure to
begin peace talks, have increased anti-Arab sentiment.
   In addition, Israelis who attack Palestinians face lenient
punishment, Palestinian leaders said.
   ``There is no doubt that the Israeli government led by Shamir
... leads to such catastrophe,'' pro-PLO leader Faisal Husseini
said after the slayings Sunday of seven unarmed Palestinian workers
by an Israeli civilian. ``The atmosphere created by such a
government is responsible.''
   But Shamir and his supporters have said Sunday's violence was
the act of a deranged man. They also accused Palestinian extremists
of using the massacre to rekindle the flagging rebellion against
Israeli rule of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   ``Anyone wishing to see in this mad murder an expression of
Israeli government policy and intentions is maliciously and
viciously distorting the picture,'' Shamir told Parliament members
from his right-wing Likud bloc at a meeting Tuesday.
   He pledged that his government would pursue peace efforts in the
Middle East but said: ``We don't want to live by our sword, but we
shall not be quick in throwing it out as long as it allows us to
live in security.''
   Shamir has headed a caretaker government since the Likud-Labor
Party coalition collapsed March 15 over Labor's insistance on
negotiations with the Palestians.
   Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's deputy foreign minister, said the
U.S. State Department's call for restraint in handling the
Palestinian riots that followed the massacre was ``understandable
but unwarranted.''
   ``I think the U.S. government and American people understand
that this was a tragedy we had nothing to do with and that we are
doing everything we can to restore tranquility,'' Netanyahu said.
   He accused the Palestine Liberation Organization and other
Palestinian groups of ``fanning the flames and sustaining the
violence.''
   Thirteen Palestinians have been killed by Israeli troops in
three days of rioting, most in the occupied Gaza Strip. More than
800 others have been injured.
   Their deaths raised to 708 the number of Palestinians killed by
Israeli soldiers or civilians since the start of the uprising in
December 1987. Forty-three Israelis have died in the violence.
   Ami Popper, 21, a cashiered Israeli army soldier has been
arrested for Sunday's fatal shootings of seven Gaza workers in
Rishon Lezion near Tel Aviv. An Israeli court ordered that he
undergo psychiatric observation.
   Saeed Kanaan, a leading pro-PLO businessman from the West Bank,
said the violence that followed the Rishon Lezion killings was not
orchestrated by Palestinian leaders.

   Graduation rehearsal should have been
held Tuesday, but instead more than 180 high school seniors
attended a memorial service for an assistant principal slain
earlier in the week.
   ``We're all hurt by it, all disgusted by it, all angry,'' senior
Marie Green said tearfully as she left the gathering.
   The students from this rural community of 2,800 gathered at
Hickman County High School to mourn the death of Ron Wallace, 41,
who will be buried Thursday. Wallace, whose daughter is among the
1990 graduates, also was the school's athletic director.
   Donald Givens, a 50-year-old science teacher at the school, was
charged Sunday night with first-degree murder. He also was charged
with aggravated arson for allegedly setting a fire to cover up the
crime.
   Authorities said Wallace walked in on Givens on Sunday morning
as Givens was preparing to blow up the school.
   Classes for the 850 students have been suspended for the rest of
the year. An exam schedule remained posted Tuesday on a wall in a
classroom near the school auditorium. The flag outside the school
was at half-staff.
   The graduation rehearsal was reset for Friday prior to the
formal exercise later that day.
   Reporters were barred from Tuesday's gathering in the
auditorium, where a partition was set to hide a stage curtain
burned when three fires were set Sunday.
   Afterward, students said school officials encouraged them to
discuss their feelings with teachers and to get together to share
their grief.
   Principal Rick Brewer addressed the group and ``ended up crying
himself,'' senior Tina Barnes said.
   Before the service, Brewer met with teachers and urged them to
carry on for the sake of the seniors despite the upheaval.
   ``What has to happen is that we make this work from here on,''
he told them. ``Everything that Ron was part of can not come to a
stop.''
   Givens remained in the Hickman County Jail where he is held
without bond.

<HEAD>Actress's Ranch To Be Part Of New National Park</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A ranch owned by actress Greer Garson would be
combined with the 385-acre Pecos National Monument to make a new
national park near Sante Fe, N.M., under legislation approved
Tuesday by the House.
   The legislation, which passed 415-0, also would preserve about
15,000 ancient Indian rock carvings by creating the Petroglyph
National Monument, near Albuquerque, N.M.
   Garson's 5,500-acre Forked Lightning Ranch went on sale after
the death of her husband, Texas oilman E.E. Buddy Fogelson.
Environmentalists and residents of the area became involved when
she began transactions with a developer who wanted to commercialize
the area.
   ``It's extremely important that we act quickly,'' said Rep. Bill
Richardson, D-N.M., during debate on the bill.
   Garson, 77, won an Academy Award in 1943 for the film ``Mrs.
Miniver'' during a career that spanned about 40 years on stage and
in the movies.
   She and her husband, who died last year, made their home at the
ranch and in Dallas, Texas.
   Richardson said one prospective buyer of the ranch wanted to
build a huge commercial complex, including a resort, shopping mall,
air strip, convention center and private hunting reserve, on the
land.
   ``Although Mrs. Fogelson has decided against selling to these
developers the land remains on the open market,'' said Richardson.
``Any development would pose a serious threat to the existing
national monument.''
   The monument was established in 1965 and preserves the ruins of
the nearly 600-year-old Pueblo of Pecos and two Spanish missions
from the 17th and 19th centuries.
   The legislation has the support of the Bush administration.
   It was attached by the House to a bill already passed by the
Senate which would make a national monument of ancient Indian rock
carvings, known as petroglyphs.
   The 15,000 petroglyphs are part of the Las Imagines National
Archeological District on Abuquerque, N.M.'s West Mesa escarpment.
   Lawmakers say the drawings are threatened by urbanization and
vandalism, and hundreds have already been destroyed.
   Aquisition of the land where the petroglyphs are located would
cost about $90 million. State and local governments have pledged
$30 million, said Rep. Robert Lagomarsino, R-Calif., a member of
the House Interior Committee.

<TEXT>
   African National Congress
leader Nelson Mandela accused the South African government Tuesday
of massacring demonstrators and causing black-on-black violence.
   Mandela also charged the government with defaming his wife,
Winnie, in a murder and assault trial involving one of her former
bodyguards, and said the ANC is not satisfied with reforms
introduced by President F.W. de Klerk.
   Mandela, speaking to reporters after returning from an
eight-nation African tour, said de Klerk has no control over the
police force. He accused police of ``slaughtering'' black people
involved in political demonstrations.
   He alleged it was government policy to keep ANC supporters
fighting members of the Inkatha political organization in Natal
province, where more than 5,000 people have died in the past five
years.
   ``It is quite clear that the government does not want this
violence to end,'' Mandela said. ``If the government continues to
massacre our people while they are talking of negotiations, that we
cannot permit. We will have to address that question specifically
in relation to whether these negotiations shall continue.''
   De Klerk is hoping to begin formal talks with black leaders on
constitutional changes that would give the black majority a voice
in national affairs _ something denied them under the current
system of apartheid.
   Since taking office in August, de Klerk has made a number of
reforms, including legalizing the long-banned ANC; freeing Mandela
from a life prison term; and ending segregation of beaches and
hospitals.
   Mandela said the ANC is not satisfied.
   ``We have got basic demands,'' he said. ``The most basic of
these is the demand for everybody to have the right to determine
his own affairs.''
   Mandela said the government has deliberately besmirched his
wife's name by linking her to the alleged crimes of one of her
former bodyguards, Jerry Richardson, but not charging her.
   Richardson is charged with murder, kidnapping, attempted murder
and assault. Eight other bodyguards are facing lesser charges in
separate trials.
   Three men have testified in court that Winnie Mandela whipped
them, beat them allowed her bodyguards to keep them captive in her
home and assault them in December 1988 and January 1989. One of the
alleged victims, 14-year-old black activist Stompie Seipei
Moeketsi, was found dead Jan. 6, 1989.
   Mrs. Mandela denies wrongdoing and has not been charged with a
crime.
   ``When my wife is not charged and the whole case centers on her,
she has no way of defending herself,'' Mandela said.
   But Mandela said he was not calling on the government to
prosecute his wife.
   ``I am saying that the way the case has been conducted is
intended to defame my wife without her having the opportunity to
defend herself,'' he said.
   It was the first time Mandela had spoken publicly on the matter
in South Africa since he was freed Feb. 12 from a life prison term
for sabotage and plotting the overthrow of the white-minority
government.

   Visitors rode home with E.T. while
technicians tinkered with King Kong and other exhibits Tuesday at
the new Universal Studios Florida.
   A three-week break-in period got under way with a low-key public
opening Monday, when about 10,000 people showed up.
   ``We're operating at roughly half-speed and half-price,'' said
Universal's top executive, Jay Stein.
   The $600 million complex, featuring film production and
large-scale, high-tech rides and shows, plans its official opening
June 7.
   ``We knew that everything was not going to be ready, yet we
desperately need the operating experience,'' Stein said after the
first paying customers toured the 444-acre park. ``You've got to
let these people perform in front of a paid _ as opposed to a free
_ audience.''
   Universal began testing its rides and shows with small crowds of
invited guests early this month before throwing open its gates
Monday.
   Some of the big attractions such as King Kong, Jaws and
Ghostbusters are still being completed and checked.
   Families with baby strollers mingled with construction workers
along some of the Manhattan and San Francisco street sets. Behind
the scenes, welders scrambled over a six-ton steel ape hanging onto
a replica of New York's Queensboro Bridge.
   Technicians fine-tuned the six-story-tall King Kong, the massive
1906 San Francisco Earthquake set and other attractions, while
builders hurried to complete facades.
   Divers and workers in small boats tried to right a trawler used
in stunt work that, to the bemused curiosity of many visitors,
accidentally flipped over on its side in a lagoon.
   ``It's painstaking work,'' Stein said. ``We've got a lot of
gnawing, aggravating things and problems to resolve, last-minute
things that _ no matter how well it all checks out in testing _
have to be changed and fixed and fine-tuned.''
   E.T., the extra-terrestrial creature that starred in the Steven
Spielberg movie, is the star of the show so far. The ride sends
guests on an intergalactic bike ride to E.T.'s endangered home
planet.
   The creature got the approval of 5-year-old Gemma John of West
Yorkshire, England, who was right up front when it ambled out
during dedication ceremonies.
   ``He's nice. He smiled,'' said Gemma, who waved and smiled back
shyly.

   A railroad strike in northwestern Poland
spread Tuesday, and the government ordered the army to transport
people and food.
   The strike began Sunday, and the Solidarity-led government of
Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki continued to appeal to rail
workers to return to work.
   The Solidarity leadership met in Gdansk to draft a response to
the strike, organized without the union's endorsement.
   The government has rejected negotiations because the strikers
are not operating through their unions. It also said that giving in
to their pay raise demands could scuttle post-Communist Poland's
economic reforms.
   Strikes were reported Tuesday at eight key depots, including
Slupsk and Koszalin, near the Baltic coast. There were warning
strikes and support actions in other provinces but precise numbers
of those who walked off the job were not immediately available.
   The workers began striking Sunday night in support of more than
three dozen colleagues on fasts. Some of the hunger strikers have
been fasting since May 10. Three were reported to have been
hospitalized, and others joined the protest Monday, PAP said.
   A team of doctors dispatched Tuesday by the Ministry of Health
was under orders to hospitalize any other workers whose health was
in danger.
   Only one rail route was open to Poland's busiest port in
Szczecin, and mail lines were paralyzed. More than 160 local
trains, 47 freight trains and 14 long-distance passenger trains
were canceled Monday, the official PAP news agency reported.
   The government decided to use the military to transport goods,
especially perishables, according to news reports.
   The army and the railway authority were also directed to
organize alternative bus and truck transport for passengers and
goods, PAP said.
   The strike was the most serious labor unrest since the
pro-democratic reforms, which included unpopular austerity
measures, went into effect on Jan. 1. The reforms have reduced
buying power by 40 percent and cut subsidies to state-owned
enterprises, including railroads.
   Labor Minister Jacek Kuron met late Monday with national railway
authorities, and news reports said it was agreed that no government
money was available to raise average pay of $79 per month. That is
close to the national average but less than the pay in many
industries, the news reports said.
   The strikers are demanding their salaries be raised to 110
percent of the national average, or another $8 this month, but
these figures are adjusted monthly to keep up with inflation.
   The government, in trying to control inflation, has rejected pay
or benefit increases that cannot be supported by the budgets of the
enterprises or the government.
   The strike represents a challenge to Solidarity, which has been
trying to define its role in society _ whether it should focus on
serving as a trade union backing workers or a political party
supporting the government.
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa reiterated his contention that the
government his movement created was moving too slowing with reforms
and failing to win the understanding of working Poles.
   The Slupsk strike committee spokesman, Jerzy Sadka, said the
workers support Mazowiecki and do not consider their action
political. ``We are involved in purely worker, and thus trade
union, issues and we protest against pulling us into political
affairs,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   A proposed move toward a global ban on high
seas drift-net fishing won approval Tuesday from the Senate
Commerce Committee and the backing of the environmental group
Greenpeace.
   ``This legislation sends a clear signal to those using drift
nets that the senseless destruction of marine life for profit must
end,'' said Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., a member of the panel.
   Gorton and Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, cosponsored the amendment
to the Magnuson Fishery Management and Conservation Act calling for
an end to high seas drift-net fishing by June 1992.
   ``Today's action will increase pressure on the governments of
Japan, Taiwan and South Korea to put an end to their high seas
drift-net fleets,'' Stevens said.
   Gorton said the drift nets _ some stretching as long as 35 miles
_ are ``environmentally devastating.''
   Greenpeace spokesman Alan Reichman of Seattle said the nets
cause large kills of dolphins, porpoise, northern fur seals and
seabirds. The fleets also intercept North American salmon and
threaten the viability of albacore tuna and red flying squid
stocks, he said.
   ``The drift-net provisions would provide new leverage to gain a
global ban on this destructive fishing technology which is
threatening ocean environment,'' Reichman said.
   The measure establishes a congressional goal of gaining a global
moratorium on high seas drift-net fishing through a resolution the
United Nations General Assembly approved in December. That
resolution calls for the moratorium on large-scale drift-net
fishing to go into effect next year.

<TEXT>
   Boris N. Yeltsin won applause from Russian
congressional deputies on Tuesday with a call to wrest control of
the republic _ the Soviet Union's largest _ from the Kremlin.
   Yeltsin, a rival of Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, is
seeking the presidency of the republic, which includes Moscow, 52
percent of the nation's population and three-quarters of its land.
   He told the Russian Congress the top-heavy Soviet political
system ``continues to cling to life though its time has passed, and
has hurt Russia most of all.''
   Yeltsin's sovereignty proposal for the republic resembles
measures passed by the three secessionist Baltic republics in the
beginning of their independence drives.
   Under it, the republic would have final say over whether Soviet
laws and decrees are valid on its territory, which stretches from
the Baltic Sea to the Pacific Ocean. The Russian republic embraces
11 time zones and the vast oil, gas, mineral and gold reserves.
   Congress was expected to vote on various sovereignty proposals
Wednesday or Thursday, then turn to nominations for president. The
president is chosen by the Congress rather than in general
elections.
   Yeltsin is running against Russia's premier Alexander Vlasov and
several others. He has said he believes about one-third of the
Congress' 1,059 deputies support him.
   A Yeltsin victory could mean a loss of face for Gorbachev, whose
policies are frequently and stridently criticized by Yeltsin.
Yeltsin is a leader of the Democratic Russia bloc that made major
inroads into local and republic councils in March elections.
   The sovereignty plan outlined by Yeltsin would involve allowing
republics and businesses to set trade contracts freely among
themselves rather than having to go through the central government.
   Other deputies offered more extreme proposals. Irina Zalevskaya,
a newspaper editor from the Ural Mountains city of Perm, declared
that Russia must break from the Soviet Union if it wants true
control over its own affairs.
   ``Full sovereignty requires the republic's secession from the
Soviet Union,'' she said. Russia should eventually seek U.N.
membership, form its own army and set up embassies in the other 14
republics, she said.
   Her vehement speech won hearty applause.

   Violent crime in Georgetown, the city's most
exclusive neighborhood, has increased to the point where
shopkeepers say they spend more time protecting their customers
than selling them goods.
   District of Columbia police warned visitors Monday to stay away
from Georgetown on weekend nights because, with reduced budgets,
they could not promise to prevent the violence that rocked the
trendy nightclub strip over the weekend.
   Police said there was one incident in which a crowd of men
attacked an officer trying to make an arrest, and a police union
spokesman said five officers in all were hurt in confrontations
during the weekend.
   Fifty officers, instead of the usual six, were supposed to have
been patrolling the area and a mobile headquarters was to have been
set up as part of a special summer anti-crime effort. But police,
citing budget cuts, said there wasn't enough money.
   Police Chief Isaac Fulwood on Tuesday reinstated the weekend
summer anti-crime patrols. But shopkeepers said extra police will
not repair the changing nature of Georgetown.
   ``It's not just police that are needed,'' one shoe store owner
said. ``It's a whole different kind of person than the kind that
used to shop here. It's too many young kids with nothing to do.''
   Area residents say robberies and muggings have been on the
increase for some time. And shopkeepers and residents said Tuesday
they are mourning the loss of the neighborhood they sought out for
its history, vibrancy and elegance.
   Georgetown, once a separate city, still has cobblestone streets,
small row houses and sprawling mansions. It has been populated by
Kennedys, Cabinet members and the city's most famed socialites and
diplomats, and is home to the city's most prestigious university.
   But the old antique and rare book shops are gradually being
replaced with national chain clothing stores, and the nightclub and
restaurant strip is thriving.
   With those changes have come increasing numbers of youths either
too young or too broke to shop or dine. Shopkeepers say those
people have begun preying on the customers, who are beginning to
stay away.
   ``We're definitely getting a security guard,'' said William
Myers, manager of Hats in the Belfry, which stays open until 10:45
p.m. ``We get rowdy people and I'm getting tired of chasing
shoplifters down the street.''
   ``I'm beginning to second guess whether I want to stay,'' said
the manager of a sports clothing store, who asked not to be named.
``I would have to see major changes. If I got an offer to get out,
I'd take it.''
   ``The last thing I want to hear is that the police are giving up
on this area,'' he added. ``I spend more time being a policeman
now, chasing riffraff and shoplifters out than I do selling. That
hurts.''
   Mehdi Mokhtari, owner of Shoe Inn, said he has chased out
children with ``wads of cash crumpled in their hands.'' They came
back later, he said, and sprayed his tiny store with a
foul-smelling aerosol, which kept customers away for hours.
   David Friedman, a longtime resident who owns Susquehanna
Antiques, says his store will be replaced this year with an
``upscale _ I hate that word _ clothing store.'' He said even the
``old Georgetown types'' no longer think of the neighborhood as a
place to find fine furniture and head for New York or Boston
instead.
   Others, however, say Georgetown has faced such phases
periodically through its history, especially in the late 1960s and
early 1970s with race riots and hippies and will survive this trend.

   The U.S. government said Tuesday it hoped the
unfication of North and South Yemen would contribute to Middle East
stability.
   State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler said the
department would also review its listing of South Yemen as a
country that supports terrorism, but she wouldn't preduct what
action the United States would take.
   ``We welcome this declaration as a measure that could improve
stability and security in the region,'' she told reporters.
   The United States accused South Yemen of engaging in terrorism
by allowing terrorist organizations to maintain facilities there
and by providing refuge for airline hijackers.
   ``We were just notified of this at 5 a.m. this morning,'' Ms.
Tutwiler said of the unification. ``Obviously it has not changed
that South Yemen is on the terrorist list in the hours that this
has taken place.''
   North Yemen President Ali Abdullah Saleh met with President
George Bush at the White House last January and discused his
proposals for unity with the south.
   The United States resumed diplomatic relations with South Yemen
last April 30 after a break of nearly 21 years.

   Leaders of the three Baltic states
appealed Tuesday to the United States and Europe for diplomatic
recognition and economic help for their independence-minded
republics.
   With an apparent eye to the upcoming superpower summit, they
also called on President Bush to suggest that the Kremlin begin
negotiations with the three republics on independence.
   The call, which came at the end of a two-day seminar on Baltic
independence, was signed by Estonian Foreign Minister Lennart Meri,
Latvian Vice President Dainis Ivans and Lithuanian Vice President
Ceslovas Stankevicius.
   The two-day seminar was arranged by Sweden's Institute of
Foreign Affairs. A panel of representatives of the three Baltic
republics and the Soviet Union were among about 150 participating
diplomats, government officials and international law experts.
   Earlier, Lithuania's vice president said some city and town
dwellers may be evacuated to the countryside to conserve energy and
food.
   Moscow imposed a blockade of oil, natural gas and raw materials
a month ago to force the republic to back down on its March 11
declaration of independence. Stankevicius said by the latest count,
22,000 people were out of work because of the embargo. ``I cannot
say how long we can survive this situation,'' he told the seminar.
``It is a threat.''
   He said Lithuania is establishing direct economic ties with
other Soviet republics and towns outside Lithuania to get around
the blockade.
   ``We are ready to supply food in exchange for raw materials,''
he said.
   Meri, of Estonia, said his republic ``has made arrangements to
receive workers from Lithuania'' and that Latvia was taking similar
steps.
   In Lithuania, legislators said gasoline sales to private cars
would be banned as of Wednesday because of shortages caused by the
Kremlin sanctions. Private cars had been limited to 2{ gallons of
gasoline a month.
   The Baltic leaders in Stockholm appealed to the 35 countries in
the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe to include
their republics in economic assistance programs. The United States,
Canada and all European countries except Albania take part in the
CSCE.

<HEAD>EPA Reviewing Report On Link Between Cancer And Electrical Power

<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An Environmental Protection Agency study still
under scientific review suggests that there is increasing
scientific evidence of a link between heavy electrical currents and
some types of cancer.
   The study, an EPA official said Tuesday, shows that research
over the last decade has established at least a tentative
connection between leukemia and some other cancers, and the slowly
varying magnetic fields created by powerful alternating electric
currents.
   Richard Guimond, director of EPA's Office of Radiation, said the
report has no original research, but rather is a review of a
variety of scientific studies of the human body effects of
long-term exposure to magnetic fields created by power lines.
   At one time, he said, studies showed no link between electrical
current and human cancer. The new report, however, said Guimond,
``suggests that there is in fact stronger and stronger evidence
being developed as more and more of these studies are done.''
   ``Over the past 10 years studies have been developed that show
evidence of links'' between cancer and electrical current, he said.
Guimond said the EPA review ``tries to analyze all of those studies
to determine if there is a weak link, a strong link, no link.''
   After the report is reviewed by a group of scientists, it will
be available for public review sometime this summer, probably in
July, he said.
   Until then, he said, ``We can't say that it is final and what
the final conclusions are going to be.''
   He said an independent panel will review work done by EPA
staffers ``to assure that our methodology is correct ... and to
give us some advice as to whether or not our evidence is strong
enough to declare that this (long term exposure to magnetic fields)
is a probable human carcinogen or not.''
   There have been more than two dozen studies by various
organizations and scientists on the possible link between illness
and the electromagnetic fields created any time an electrical
circuit is energized. Though there have been findings suggestive of
a cancer effect, the link has not been universally accepted by
scientists.
   A new understanding in recent years of how individual cells can
be affected by even very low levels of electromagnetic radiation,
however, has caused a closer look at a possible link between
electrical currents and cancer.
   For instance, a 1987 study in Denver claimed that children
living near electric power lines were 1.7 times more likely to
develop leukemia than Denver children living away from power lines.
Other studies in recent years have suggested there is a higher
incidence of leukemia and brain tumors among people exposed to
electrical fields on the job. These would include electrical power
line and telephone line workers.
   Other studies have shown that even very low levels of
electromagnetic radiation, such as from ordinary household
applicances, can affect specific cells, but whether or not these
cells are actually injured remains a controversial question.
   All households, and almost all power lines, use alternating
current, changing direction 60 times a second and producing an
electromagnetic field varying at the same frequency. Only a handful
of very high power transmission lines use direct current, which
produces a steady magnetic field.

   The American Red Cross received a record
$165 million in donations in 1989 but spent $151 million, three
times more than the record.
   ``It was a tremendous year for helping others,'' said Red Cross
Chairman George Moody at the organization's annual convention in
Orlando.
   Most of the money, $127 million, was spent on victims of
Hurricane Hugo in the Southeast and the California earthquake,
Moody said Tuesday.
   Last year was the most expensive year of disasters in the Red
Cross' 109-year history, Moody said.
   Focusing on Hugo and the California earthquake, Moody said more
than 21,000 volunteers helped serve 12.7 million meals, shelter
almost 180,000 people and give financial assistance to 143,000
families.
   During the convention, the organization conducted a series of
workshops for workers and volunteers on topics such as
disaster-preparedness, blood donations, famines in Africa and
AIDS-education programs.
   A new Spanish-language AIDS video was unveiled at the
conference. It will be used along with other materials to help in
AIDS education courses among Hispanics, Red Cross spokeswoman Diane

<TEXT>
   Parliament's Finance Committee said Tuesday it
approved spending $20.5 million to improve Jewish settlements in
the occupied territories at the request of Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir.
   The decision came Monday after a plea from Shamir, who asked the
committee in a letter to allocate the funds to the Housing
Ministry. A copy of Shamir's letter was obtained by The Associated
Press.
   Shamir asked that the money be used to develop settlements and
roads beyond the Green Line, which divides Israel from the
territories it captured in the 1967 Middle East War. A Shamir
spokesman insisted the money would be used only to improve existing
settlements, not build new ones.
   Two new settlements established by Shamir's caretaker government
have sparked protests from the United States, which says
settlements in the occupied areas are an obstacle to peacemaking.
   Shulamit Aloni, a Finance Committee member and left-wing
legislator, condemned the decision to allocate the money.
   ``This decision was passed by a completely insane system at a
time of political unrest,'' Aloni said. He said it could hurt U.S.
aid to Israel and endanger Soviet Jewish emigration.
   Thousands of Soviet Jews are expected to immigrate to Israel
this year, and there is concern in the Soviet Union and among Arab
countries that some could settle in the occupied lands.
   Israel denies it has a policy of steering immigrants to the
occupied territories.
   A report by an Israeli diplomat in Washington released Tuesday
in the daily Haaretz supported Aloni's claims.
   Yoram Ettinger, aide to deputy Foreign Minister Benjamin
Natanyahu, said the U.S. Congress appeared to be less motivated to
maintain strategic cooperation with Israel and more inclined to
support Palestinians in their struggle for statehood, Haaretz
reported.
   The Arab states see any settlement move as an attempt to push
out Palestinians from the occupied territories.
   Government officials insisted that the money approved by the
Finance Committee would not be used to form a new Jewish presence
in the occupied West Bank or Gaza Strip.
   ``We are talking about already existing settlements, not forming
new ones,'' Shamir's spokesman Avi Pazner said.
   The allocated money included $2.5 million to ``strengthen'' new
settlements and $3 million for developing and expanding existing
settlements.
   A separate sum of $2.5 million was allocated to purchase
prefabricated houses and strengthen settlements in the West Bank.
   Ariel Weinstein, who represents Shamir's Likud bloc on the
Finance Committee, said the government decided on a policy of
settling the occupied territories and they should be treated as any
other Israeli town.
   ``They need new roads, schools. Nobody thinks the government can
decide not to fulfill these needs,'' Weinstein said.
   In Egypt, President Hosni Mubarak warned Tuesday that settlement
of Soviet Jewish immigrants in Israeli-occupied lands threatens
``new bloody confrontation'' in the Middle East.
   He spoke at the opening session of Socialist International, a
non-governmental grouping of 89 socialist parties from 47 countries.

<HEAD>Student Massacre Reported In Zaire</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A reliable Belgian newspaper reported
Tuesday that more than 50 students opposing the Zairian government
had been killed by soldiers in the southeastern Zairian city of
Lubumbashi.
   A Belgian official, who requested anonymity, said there were
deaths but declined to elaborate. Belgium, the former colonial
power in Zaire, said its ambassador to Zaire had gone to Lubumbashi
to get information.
   Official sources in Zaire said 14 students had been injured when
soldiers were called to separate rival groups of students.
   Colette Braeckman, a reporter for Brussels daily Le Soir, quoted
a Belgian professor from Lubumbashi University who was present at
the time of the killing.
   The professor, who requested anonymity, was quoted as saying
that a special commando unit of President Mobutu Sese Seko's
personal guard flew to Lubumbashi May 11 and killed more than 50
students who had expressed their opposition to Mobutu's regime two
days before.
   He was quoted as saying the opponents had seriously injured some
alleged security agents.
   The source said the special commando attacked anti-Mobutu
students while they slept in their campus dormitories, cutting
their throats with knives or broken bottles, setting bedrooms afire
and throwing bodies through windows. The professor added some
bodies were removed by the soldiers.
   He added Belgian professors were asked to ignore the massacre.
Some of them returned to Belgium, he was quoted as saying.
   On Saturday, Belgian Foreign Minister Mark Eyskens expressed
concern about ``the serious incidents which took place on
university campuses'' and called on Zaire authorities to respect
human rights.
   The official Zaire news agency Azap criticized the Belgian
foreign minister's statement, claiming soldiers had been called to
separate rival groups of students.
   The U.S. State Department said in its annual human rights report
that security organizations regularly harass, detain and physically
mistreat opponents. Several leading House Democrats have urged the
United States end aid to Mobutu, who has ruled since 1965.

<HEAD>Democrats Call For Aid to International Ozone Effort</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of 11 Senate Democrats, challenging
President Bush, introduced legislation Tuesday that would authorize
money to help developing nation's phase out chemicals that damage
the ozone layer.
   The Bush administration refused last month to go along with
international efforts to help developing countries curtail the use
of such chemicals as chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs, that are
damaging the ozone layer.
   The ozone layer protects the Earth from ultraviolet radiation.
   Under a plan floated by several European countries at a
conference in Geneva, $100 million would be provided by industrial
nations over three years.
   But the assistance plan reportedly was opposed by John Sununu,
White House chief of staff, and Richard Darman, director of the
Office of Management and Budget.
   Legislation introduced in the Senate on Tuesday would authorize
the spending of $25 million annually for the assistance program
over the next three years. It was not known Tuesday whether efforts
would be made to specifically earmark money for such assistance in
approprations legislation.
   ``We cannot accept the adminstration's preference for
environmental negligence and we will not allow the United States to
become an environmental outcast,'' said Sen. Al Gore, D-Tenn., one
of the sponsors.
   The other co-sponsors of the legislation were Senate Majority
Leader George Mitchell of Maine and Sens. Claiborne of Rhode
Island, Patrick Leahy of Vermont, Timothy Wirth of Colorado, John
Kerry, of Massachusetts, Max Baucus of Montana, Joseph Biden of
Delaware, Brock Adams of Washington, Alan Cranston of California
and Dale Bumpers of Arkansas.

<HEAD>Big Iliescu Win Raises Fears About Romanian Democracy</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Interim President Ion Iliescu defeated
the opposition in Romania's election by such a large margin that
fears were raised Tuesday in his own party about entrenching
democracy in this former Communist bastion.
   Iliescu captured 85.9 percent of the vote in the three-way
presidential race with nearly all ballots counted. His National
Salvation Front party had more than two-thirds of the seats in the
two-chamber Parliament.
   The 60-year-old former Communist Politburo member had been
expected to win Romania's first multiparty election in 53 years
last Sunday, but his overwhelming victory astonished many Romanians
and foreign observers.
   Iliescu says he wants to turn Romania into a Swedish-style
social democracy and that he will seek a coalition with the
opposition.
   But his two opponents said they will seek to nullify the
election on grounds of fraud and indicated it was unlikely they
would join a national unity government.
   A monthlong protest by anti-Communist demonstrators in downtown
Bucharest's University Square flared into what almost became a
violent confrontation with government officials who tried to
establish a dialogue. At least 4,000 protesters filled the square
Tuesday night, shouting the election was a fraud.
   Silviu Brucan, the Front's power behind the scenes and one of
its campaign organizers, said the turnout of more than 85 percent
meant Romanians ``have passed magna cum laude the first class in
democracy.''
   But he said the Front's share of the vote was too high.
   ``This is no good for democracy because I stick to my statement
that a strong opposition is essential in a democracy, particularly
at a time when that democracy is in the making,'' he said.
   Iliescu, who announced Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu's
execution at the climax of December's revolution, capitalized on
his personality and his grassroots support from industrial workers
and peasants.
   In an editorial, the outspoken independent daily Romania Libera
said: ``The Front has won the elections but apparently it
definitely alienated several million voters and the country has
lost a chance, the chance to have a genuine political opposition in
Parliament.''
   Some foreign diplomats and observers monitoring the election
said the Front's control of Parliament means it could overwhelm the
process of writing a new constitution, which is to take place
within 18 months.
   ``If the results are confirmed, this doesn't seem to be the
result of a pluralist system and this worries me,'' said Adelaide
Aglietta, a lawmaker from Italy's Green party, who was an observer
for the European Parliament.
   ``I think people here were not helped to understand exactly what
democracy means. They still think that other political parties are
the enemies, and they haven't understood what a political dialogue
in a democracy is,'' she told a news conference.
   Andreas Khol, leader of the European Democratic Union observer
group, drawing together Western Europe's powerful conservative
parties, said in Vienna the election did not give Iliescu or the
Front the legitimacy of new governments in Hungary or Poland.
   He said it was an important step toward democracy but did not
express ``the free will of the Romanian people.''
   Khol said Western governments should refrain from granting
Romanian aid and leave any help to private firms.
   But Robert Waring, a British lawmaker from the socialist Labor
Party, called the election ``free and fair'' and said: ``When we
get back we will tell the (British) government please, please help
Romania with credits for investments to see that industries are
re-equipped.''
   With 13 million ballots counted Tuesday night, Iliescu had 85.9
percent of the vote, Radu Campeanu of the National Liberal Party
had 10.3 percent and Ion Ratiu of the National Peasant Party 3.8
percent, according to the Central Electoral Bureau.
   More than 85 percent of the 16 eligible million voters cast
ballots, authorities said.
   In the Senate race, the Front won 68.17 percent, the Liberals
6.46 percent, the Peasants 2.27 percent, the Ecological Movement
2.45 percent.
   In the lower Chamber of Deputies, the Front got 67.30 percent,
the Liberals 6.0 percent, the Peasants 2.31, the Ecological
Movement 2.69 percent.
   The Hungarian Democratic Union, apparently winning broad
allegiance from Romania's 2 million ethnic Hungarians, emerged as
the largest opposition party in Parliament, taking 7.41 percent in
the Senate and 7.43 percent in the Chamber of Deputies.
   The other votes for the 506 parliamentary seats went to tiny
parties.
   Justice Minister Teofil Pop was mobbed by protesters and
government Secretary-General Sever Georgescu was grabbed by the
collar when they visited 24 hunger strikers in University Square
Tuesday night. Both had to flee.
   The hunger strikers want a ban on former Communist officials
holding public office for 10 years.

   Experiments have shown for the first time that
human blood cells carrying foreign genes will zero in on tumors,
opening a new strategy for treating cancer, researchers said
Tuesday.
   The preliminary study, conducted on seven patients, is the first
approved attempt at human gene therapy _ inserting potentially
helpful genes inside the body in places where nature failed to put
them.
   The experiment was intended to show that the approach was
possible. Physicians introduced a bacterial gene that had no effect
on the patients' cancer.
   Soon, however, they plan to equip patients' blood cells with a
gene that delivers a powerful natural cancer-killing substance
known as tumor necrosis factor. The researchers hope that will cure
the disease by blitzing the tumor with extremely high levels of
toxic proteins.
   ``This is the first study in which foreign genes have been
introduced into humans with survival of those cells,'' said Dr.
Steven A. Rosenberg. ``This is meant to pave the way to introducing
genes that can improve the survival of cancer patients.''
   His pilot study showed that not only did the cells survive, they
homed in on tumors and produced a foreign protein there.
   Rosenberg outlined his results at the annual meeting of the
American Society of Clinical Oncology. A more detailed report is
scheduled to be published in the New England Journal of Medicine.
   Dr. Robert Young of Philadelphia's Fox Chase Cancer Center noted
that while biologists have isolated genes that make potentially
useful substances, transferring that knowledge from the petri dish
to cancer patients has been difficult.
   ``The introduction of foreign genes and transferring them into
human cells and putting them back into humans is an extremely
important observation,'' Young said of Rosenberg's work. ``The
potential of doing this and asking therapeutic questions is now
possible.''
   Rosenberg, a National Cancer Institute researcher, developed a
cancer treatment known as adoptive immunotherapy intended to
harness the body's own cancer-fighting chemicals to control the
disease.
   His first results, using the protein interleukin-2, attracted
wide attention when they were announced five years ago. Follow-up
research showed only a small minority of patients, perhaps 5
percent to 10 percent, respond with complete reversal of the
disease.
   The latest work is an attempt to boost the power of those
natural chemicals by delivering them directly to the tumor. At
Tuesday's meeting, Rosenberg described the results of experiments
over the past year on his first five patients.
   First, doctors removed so-called tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes
from each patient. Those are cancer-hunting white blood cells that
had invaded the tumors of patients dying of melanoma, a form of
skin cancer.
   Then, doctors isolated a gene that gives bacteria the ability to
resist the antibiotic neomycin. They put that gene into a crippled
virus, which in turn carried it into the patients' white blood
cells.
   Finally, they multiplied the blood cells in test tubes with
interleukin-2, a growth hormone, injecting 200 billion of those
cells into each patient.
   Because the cells carried a bacterial gene, doctors could track
them through the patients' bodies. They found that the manipulated
cells persisted in the blood for up to 189 days.
   They performed biopsies on two patients and found the cells in
the tumors, making the bacterial protein, 64 days after the
injections.
   All of the patients treated were expected to die within three
months. Two of them responded well to the boosted levels of
tumor-infiltrating cells, and the melanoma has disappeared in one
completely for 10 months.
   Rosenberg said the experiment worked just as his team had hoped.
   ``There were no suprises in this,'' he said. ``I am looking
forward to trials that hopefully will help cancer patients.''
   He said he and colleagues had already succeeded in inserting the
gene that makes tumor necrosis factor into human blood cells. Those
cells make 100 times higher levels of the protein than are
ordinarily present.
   Rosenberg said he hoped to win approval within a few months from
several regulating committees so he can try the next step on
melanoma patients.

   About 70 Kuwaiti University professors staged a

said was an assault on the constitution.
   In a statement, they condemned as ``a violation of the Islamic

elected Parliament, dissolved in 1986, with a partially appointed
body.
   The professors called the recently decreed interim Parliament,
with 25 of its 75 members selected by the Emir of Kuwait, Sheik
Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, ``a bolt of lightning on the heads of
those who uphold the constitution.''
   They short of calling for a boycott of the June 10 parliamentary

   Parliament was dissolved in 1976 and 1986 in the name of public
interest after vitriolic attacks by the deputies against government
ministers.

<HEAD>Iraqi Official Claims Western Attack Behind Fears of `Super Gun'</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iraq and the Palestine Liberation
Organization claimed Tuesday that Western allegations about a
``super gun'' said to be able to launch nuclear weapons at Israel
were a prelude to an attack against Iraqi installations.
   But Arab diplomatic sources, requesting anonymity, also said
Tuesday that Iraq was behind a conciliatory message to be sent to
the United States and Soviet Union at their summit May 30.
   Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz and the PLO's political department
chief, Farouk Kaddoumi, linked Western charges about an Iraqi
weapon to the influx of Soviet Jews into Israel, and the weekend
killing of seven Arab laborers near Tel Aviv.
   An increase in Jewish immigrants in Israel is seen as a threat
to Arab settlers in Israeli-occupied territories. The two officials
said these were anti-Arab developments that could lead to an attack
on Iraq.
   ``There's no doubt that this political and propaganda campaign
... is a prelude for a strike against our technological and
scientific installations,'' Aziz told the Arab foreign ministers.
   They spoke at the inaugural session of an Arab foreign ministers
meeting at the Al-Rashid Hotel. The meeting convened to prepare for
a special summit of Arab leaders in Baghdad set for May 28.
   The summit was called by PLO chairman Yasser Arafat to discuss
the emigration of hundreds of thousands of Soviet Jews to Israel.
Iraq asked that its confrontation with the West be included on the
agenda.
   ``Jerusalem is calling you, O leaders of the Arab world,'' said
banners flying in the streets of the Iraqi capital. Others said,
``Arab unity is the shield against threats to our scientific
development.''
   But efforts to achieve the long-sought unity suffered a setback
Tuesday when Syria and Lebanon failed to show up.
   Damascus had said it would not attend a summit in Iraq, its main
Arab foe. Lebanon, two-thirds of its territory under control of
40,000 Syrian troops, had said it would participate if all other
Arabs did.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein brushed aside the feud with
Syria, ruled by a rival wing of the Arab Baath Socialist Party. He
sent an envoy to Damascus on Monday to persuade President Hafez
Assad to change his mind, but Assad refused.
   Arafat had insisted the Arab meeting be held before the May
30-June 3 superpower summit between President Bush and Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in Washington.
   Arab diplomatic sources, insisting on anonymity, said the Arab
leaders would send a message, drafted by Iraq, to Bush and
Gorbachev.
   It urges Bush and Gorbachev to work for reviving Arab-Israeli
peace initiatives and to curtail Jewish immigration to Israel. The
letter requests that the United States and Europe open their
borders to some immigrants.
   The message also reassures Washington and Moscow that Iraq's
scientific and technological projects were for peaceful purposes.
   Britain said in March it confiscated a shipment of 40 electronic
capacitors destined for Iraq. The devices can be used to trigger
nuclear weapons.
   Shortly after, Britain impounded steel tubes it said was part of
a giant gun. Greece, Turkey and Italy later said they seized
shipments that may have been components of the gun.

<HEAD>Bush Signs Biological Weapons Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush on Tuesday signed into law a
bill making it illegal to develop and possess biological weapons.
   ``I call upon the leaders of all nations to join us in our drive
to rid the world of biological and chemical weapons and to do
everything in their power to stop the proliferation of these
weapons of mass destruction,'' Bush said in a statement.
   Praising Congress for passing the legislation, Bush saluted the
leadership for its commitment ``to our shared goal of destroying
forever the evil shadow these weapons have cast around the world.''
   The measure puts into effect a 1972 treaty against biological
weapons.
   Biological weapons are harmful forms of bacteria, viruses, fungi
or naturally occuring toxins that could be directed at an enemy. A
biological weapon could be unleashed on an unsuspecting public by
using it in a liquid to contaminate water or in an aerosol that is
dropped by bomb.
   In 1925, the Geneva Protocol banned the first use in war of
biological and chemical weapons, but did not address the
development, production, possession or transfer of the weapons.
   Forty-four years later, President Nixon ordered the Defense
Department to destroy its arsenal of biological weapons. The United
States then spearheaded the fight for an international ban on
production and possession of them.
   On April 10, 1972, in Washington, Moscow and London, 111
countries signed the Biological Weapons Convention, which prohibits
production and possession of the weapons.

Official</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   East Germany on Tuesday accused a former top
Communist official of squandering government money, the first
formal criminal charges to be brought against a member of the old
regime.
   Also Tuesday, lawmakers from the ruling coalition called for the
resignation of Interior Minister Peter-Michael Diestel for trying
to use an ex-Communist spymaster as an adviser and for failing to
fully dismantle the former government's system of police informers.
   Peter Przbylski, a spokesman for the federal prosecutor's
office, said Werner Krolikowski, 61, a member of the former
Communist Party's ruling Politburo and a deputy prime minister,
faces trial in an East Berlin city court on charges of abuse of
trust.
   No trial date has been set, he said.
   The charge carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison.
   Krolikowski has been under house arrest since authorities began
investigating past abuses of the former regime early this year.
   He has been accused of using his powerful position to build
homes with swimming pools for his son. Przbylski said the
properties were worth in excess of $600,000.
   Although he is the first former top official to be charged with
a crime, he may also be the last. Several members of the aging old
guard are not expected to see the inside of a courtroom.
   Former Communist Party leader Erich Honecker, 88, and several
other officials ousted in last October's pro-democracy revolt are
under investigation for abuse of power, corruption and other
charges, but many of the charges have been dropped.
   Honecker is in a Soviet sanitorium in East Germany and is
reported seriously ill.
   Diestel, a member of the coalition government that replaced the
Communists, has come under increased fire for what critics say is
his unwillingness to purge his interior ministry of police linked
with the old regime.
   On Tuesday, lawmakers from his own political party called for
his resignation.
   ``He has not smashed the old structure of the Ministry for State
Security,'' said Juergen Schwarz, a spokesman for the German Social
Union delegation in Parliament.
   Schwarz said a majority of lawmakers believe that ``the mistrust
is pronounced and his resignation is urged.''
   Diestel said he was ``surprised and troubled'' by the call for
his resignation.
   Members of Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere's Christian
Democratic Union have also called for Diestel's resignation.
   West German and East German lawmakers have joined in sharply
criticizing Diestel for trying to bring in former Communist
spymaster Markus Wolf, who is wanted in West Germany, to help with
the dissolution of East Germany's notorious Communist secret police.
   Critics say Diestel still has hundreds of members of the former
secret police on the payroll and has shown little enthusiasm for
investigating past crimes of the much-feared security network.

   A treaty to sharply reduce U.S. and Soviet
troops in Europe is unlikely to be concluded by the end of the year
unless a half-dozen thorny issues are settled this summer, a senior
Bush administration official said Tuesday.
   Soviet concerns about German unification and about the
reliability of its Warsaw Pact allies are leading reasons for the
setback, the official said at a White House briefing.
   President Bush predicted a year ago that the treaty would be
completed within six to 12 months. It would be signed by 35 nations
at a summit meeting in Paris.
   Since then, however, most of the Soviet allies in the Warsaw
Pact have replaced hard-line governments with more moderate
regimes. West Germany and East Germany are on track to unify this
summer.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III was unable to overcome the
slump in troop negotiations during four days of talks last week in
Moscow. But he reached agreement with President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev and Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze to cut U.S.
and Soviet nuclear-tipped cruise missiles and to end production of
chemical weapons.
   Bush and Gorbachev are expected to act on both agreements at
their summit meeting in Washington May 31-June 3.
   Before the slow-down, the United States and the Soviet Union
agreed last December on new troop levels in Europe _ 195,000 for
each in Central Europe and an additional 30,000 U.S. troops in
Western Europe.
   To get down to that ceiling, the Soviets would have to pull some
400,000 troops back behind their borders; about 100,000 Americans
would come home.
   The treaty also would set limits on battle tanks, artillery,
armored combat vehicles, combat aircraft and combat helicopters,
requiring cutbacks in all categories.
   The purpose of the treaty is to reduce East-West tensions across
the vast expanse of Europe _ from the Atlantic in the West to the
Ural Mountains in the Soviet Union. The negotiations technically
are being conducted by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and
the Warsaw Pact. But the negotiators, in Vienna, take their cues
from the United States and the Soviet Union.
   The official said there is disagreement over aircraft, tanks,
troop limits, how weapons would be destroyed and over safeguards
against cheating.
   He said the Soviets did not engage in ``serious'' negotiations
with Baker on these issues in Moscow. But the official stressed the
slow-down had deeper causes _ what he called ``the dissolution'' of
the Warsaw Pact and concerns about German unification.
   ``If we don't have substantive agreement by this summer it will
be hard to have a treaty by the end of the year,'' he said.
   That would mean postponing the Paris summit of NATO, Warsaw Pact
and neutral nations, as well, the official said.
   Having lost some 20 million people _ some estimates are as high
as 26 million _ in World War II, the Soviets are apprehensive about
confronting a powerful German army while their own troops and tanks
are being scaled back.
   Also, the Warsaw Pact countries that stood between Germany and
the Soviet Union are drifting away.

   Two members of Congress called on the Bush
administration on Tuesday to use its authority to lift immigration
restrictions on people infected with the AIDS virus.
   The administration says only Congress can change the
restrictions. But Reps. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., and J. Roy Rowland,
D-Ga., said that according to a legal opinion from the General
Accounting Office, the administration has the power to modify the
AIDS exclusion policy.
   ``The policy should be changed now,'' Waxman said.
   A statement issued by the Department of Health and Human
Services said that officials read ``with interest'' the GAO legal
opinion, but still hold to the administration's view.
   The administration has maintained it lacks the authority to lift
the restrictions because they were ordered by Congress. In 1987,
Congress directed the president to add infection with the AIDS
virus to a list of diseases used to bar entry to the United States.
   ``The administration continues to believe that the issue of
amending or reversing this recent congressional mandate, imposed on
the president by a vote of 96-0 (in the Senate), rests with the
Congress,'' the statement said.
   Officials at the federal Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta
in March recommended that infection with the AIDS virus be removed
from the list.
   Rowland and Waxman introduced a bill last month that would give
federal health officials authority over the list of contagious
diseases.
   But in view of the GAO opinion, Waxman said, ``the question is
now plainly before the president.''
   The department's statement said the extent of the
administration's power was that the attorney general could grant
waivers to aliens infected with the AIDS virus for temporary visits.
   In that regard, the administration announced last month a new
10-day visa for foreigners attending certain White House-approved
conferences in the United States. Travelers with the visa do not
have to reveal whether they are infected with the AIDS virus.
   The action was taken in response to criticism from international
organizations that have said they will boycott an international
conference on AIDS in San Francisco next month.

   Leonard Bernstein canceled his
appearance at Friday's opening gala at the Spoleto Festival U.S.A.
because the composer is recovering from pneumonia, festival
organizers announced Tuesday.
   ``We're all shocked. We only heard about it yesterday. He is a
very sick man and he absolutely can't come,'' said Gian Carlo
Menotti, the Pulitzer prize-winning composer who founded the
American festival in 1977.
   Bernstein, 71, was to have conducted Beethoven's Symphony No. 7
in a concert opening the 14th festival and celebrating Charleston's
recovery from the ravages of Hurricane Hugo. The event has been
sold out for weeks.
   ``People who love music will come anyway,'' Menotti said.
``People who want to look at some rare star will probably want
their money back.''
   During the festival's second year, in 1978, the composer of
``West Side Story'' was scheduled to conduct three concerts. He
withdrew because his wife, Felicia, was critically ill with cancer.
She died in June of that year.
   ``This time it is the doctor's orders pure and simple,''
Bernstein wrote in a letter to Menotti, even offering to provide a
written doctor's excuse.
   ``I am in the process of recovering from a brush with pneumonia
and a complete week's rest has been imposed upon me,'' the
conductor said in a statement issued in New York.
   More than 2,700 purchased tickets for the opening gala, paying
as much as $150 for seats which includes a formal dinner following
the concert.
   Festival officials said they would not refund tickets prior to
the concert.
   Menotti, saying ``our specialty is miracles,'' announced the
festival will instead stage a concert featuring mezzo-soprano
Tatiana Troyanos, 18-year-old violinist Midori and conductor Julius
Rudel.

   State health officials have no explanation
for a mystery illness which has stricken at least seven children
and possibly many others, prompting hundreds of calls from worried
parents.
   ``We are in for the long haul,'' Dr. Dennis Perrotta, the Texas
Department of Health's director of epidemiology in Austin, said
Tuesday. ``This is going to be a tough one.''
   The disease causes high fevers, debilitating joint pain, sore
throats and rashes. It has been confirmed in seven children between
the ages of 3 and 12. Some of the children have been hospitalized
for up to a month.
   So far, none of the cases has been fatal and victims seem to
make a full recovery, said Dr. Jeffrey W. Jundt, who has treated
the seven confirmed cases.
   State health officials said Tuesday they have gotten 200 to 300
calls from concerned parents and others since word first surfaced
in newspapers during the weekend. Investigators from the Centers
for Disease Control in Atlanta have been called.
   Jundt, an arthritis specialist at Scott &amp; White Memorial
Hospital and Clinic in Temple, said the seven confirmed cases
appeared in rural east and central Texas.
   The ailment has been dubbed ``Palestine Fever,'' after the East
Texas town in which the three earliest cases surfaced starting in
March. Palestine is about 100 miles southeast of Dallas.
   ``We traveled to Temple and Palestine and talked to the
physicians and visited with the some of the families,'' Perrotta
said. ``We have corroborated what Dr. Jundt has told us. We have
not been able to come up with the answer. It does look like there
are more cases.''
   He said the department would probably complete an exposure
questionnaire by Wednesday and begin collecting more followup
information by the week's end.
   The treatment involves aspirin and antibiotics, Jundt said.
   He sees a similarity between this ailment and Lyme disease, a
tick-borne illness. ``Lyme disease had been going on for a long
time,'' Jundt said. But it wasn't recognized until a cluster of
cases at Lyme, Conn., raised a question, he said.
   ``There's a possibility this disease has been around for a
while,'' he said.
   One patient, 11-year-old Michael Sharp of Copperas Cove, lost 21
pounds in the seven weeks he suffered from the ailment.

<HEAD>Former Laos Soldier Faces Deportation on Drug Charge</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ELK RIVER, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Laotian man who used opium to treat an
18-year-old war wound faces deportation proceedings under a federal
law his attorney says wasn't intended for cases like his.
   Chao Yang, 38, says he began smoking opium as a painkiller in
1972 after his knee was shattered by a bullet during a battle with
North Vietnamese soldiers in Laos.
   Still using crutches, Yang is in custody at Sherburne County
Jail, waiting to see if the government wants to deport him because
he shipped opium through the mail.
   He was admitted to the country seeking political asylum, and the
decision on his application has yet to be made.
   Attorney Sam Myers said Yang faces deportation proceedings
because of a 1988 law that Congress enacted to crack down on
foreign drug kingpins.
   ``I think everyone was surprised, because I don't think anybody
realized this would be the effect of the law,'' Myers said.
   Myers said the government agrees Yang is not a drug dealer.
   In Laos, ethnic Hmong people have cultivated opium for
generations, and many used it the way Westerners use
over-the-counter painkillers.
   When he emigrated to the United States in 1985, Yang, who is
Hmong, tried legal medications.
   ``He went to St. Paul-Ramsey (Medical Center) and all they gave
him was Tylenol. Geez, that didn't do any good,'' Myers said. Yang
went back to opium.
   After his arrest in April 1989, Yang was convicted on drug
charges and served six months in a federal medical prison in
Rochester. When he finished his sentence last month, he planned to
return to his wife and two teen-age daughters in St. Paul.
   But under the Omnibus Crime and Control Act of 1988, Yang was
held without a court hearing by the Immigration and Naturalization
Service. The law was designed to prevent foreign citizens convicted
of drug offenses from fleeing automatic deportation efforts.
   Myers said Yang is not a flight risk.
   Complicating the case is a Washington order barring the
immigration service from sending immigrants back to Vietnam,
Cambodia or Laos because many fled political persecution and face
prison or death if they return.
   Myers said he will challenge the constitutionality of the act's
provision that allow detention without a bail hearing. Yang's
deportation hearing was scheduled for July 25 in Minneapolis.
   ``If one is looking for a bad guy here, it's Congress,'' Myers
said. ``Because Congress passed a law that allowed for no
exceptions, and any time you pass a law with no exceptions, you're
just begging for injustice.''

   Thunderstorms battered the Texas Gulf Coast with rain, hail and
a tornado Tuesday, while the northeast was chilled with a record
cold snap.
   In Arkansas, where torrential weekend rains produced serious
flash flooding, the Ouachita River was significantly above flood
stage early Tuesday and near crest at Arkadelphia in the
south-central part of the state.
   The degree of flooding is expected to decrease significantly as
the crest moves downstream.
   Snow fell across northern Maine at noon, and the morning was
unseasonably cool in much of New England and eastern New York.
   Rainshowers extended over the central coast of New England.
   Showers also were scattered over northern Minnesota, eastern
North Dakota, southeastern South Dakota and northeast Nebraska, and
from southwest Washington across western Oregon and northern
California.
   Showers and thunderstorms reached from central Virginia across
West Virginia, northwestern North Carolina, northeast Tennessee and
eastern Kentucky. There also were storms over the northern and
central portion of the Florida peninsula and the Florida panhandle.
   And storms hit the lower and central Gulf Coast in Texas, where
a tornado touched down west of Port O'Connor at about noon. Small
hail and almost two inches of rain fell at nearby Palacios between
2 p.m. and 3 p.m. EDT.
   Heavier rainfall during the six hours ending at 2 p.m. EDT
included 1.28 inches in Victoria, Tex., an dan inch at Cape
Hatteras, N.C.
   A cold front moved across the Pacific northwest, south-central
Oregon and the northern coast of California toward the Pacific
Ocean.
   The colder temperatures were expected to bring snow to the
mountains of northern California.
   The forecast for Wednesday included rain from northern
California to the northwest, showers from the central to the
northern Rockies and for New York, New England, Wisconsin and
eastern Nebraska.
   The low temperature for the nation Tuesday morning was 31
degrees at Cutbank, Mt. Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m.
EDT ranged from 34 degrees at Houlton, Me., to 96 degrees at
Phoenix, Ariz.

<HEAD>Amnesty Says Pakistan Human Rights Record Improving</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Amnesty International said Wednesday that
Pakistan's human rights record has improved under Prime Minister
Benazir Bhutto, but abuses reportedly persist, including torture,
rape and whippings.
   The report by the worldwide human rights group said 2,029 death
sentences were commuted after Mrs. Bhutto took office in October
1988, thousands of prisoners were freed, and compensation was
promised for torture victims.
   But Amnesty said ``scores of people were reportedly tortured in
police stations last year, including at least eight women who were
allegedly raped. Torture in prisons has decreased but is still
likely to recur as those responsible have not been brought to
trial.''
   The allegations appear in the summary of a memorandum submitted
to the Bhutto government following an Amnesty visit to Pakistan
last summer.
   It said ``whipping remains as a punishment for certain crimes;
fetters are used in prisons; imprisonment on religious grounds
continues.''
   Also, special courts ``which do not conform to international
standards for fair trials can impose the death penalty and try
certain political offenses.'' ``The government has taken some steps
to monitor police abuses by setting up a body to monitor police
atrocities,'' the report says.
   But it calls for further safeguards including strict limits on
incommunicado detention; prompt access to lawyers, doctors and
relatives; prompt referrals to magistrates; independent
investigations of torture allegations; and special measures to
protect detained women and children.
   It said whipping, amputation and stoning to death, introduced by
the previous government of the late President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq,
remain on the law books and that two public floggings took place
last year.
   ``Fetters are still used on prisoners, including children.''
   While thousands of prisoners jailed under Zia's martial law were
released, ``several hundred martial law convicts remain imprisoned,
including possible political prisoners.''
   The report says special anti-terrorism courts are increasingly
used in Sind Province, where internal violence has left thousands
dead in the past years. The courts fail to meet international
standards for fair trial because they presume the defendant guilty
in certain circumstances, it said.

   Romania's newly formed government tolerated
violence and voter intimidation before last Sunday's national
elections, the co-leader of an international observer team said
Tuesday.
   Sen. Joseph Lieberman, D-Conn., just back from Bucharest after
monitoring Romania's first free elections in 53 years, said the
United States should supply humanitarian aid immediately. But he
said further aid should be conditioned on the new government's
ability to move toward democracy.
   ``There was a lot of unfairness in the pre-election process,''
Lieberman told reporters. ``Some of it was intentional by the
government party and some of it was unintentional.''
   A problem facing the opposition parties, he said, was a lack of
time to organize a campaign against the governing party, which
dominated media outlets.
   ``What happened on Sunday was a significant step forward toward
democracy but there is a lot more to be done,'' Lieberman said.
``They've come a long way; they deserve some help. But they also
need some pressure to continue to move toward more human rights,
more political freedom, and greater recognition of the rights of
minorities, particularly Hungarians.''
   According to results reported Tuesday, interim President Ion
Iliescu defeated the opposition in Romania's election with 85.9
percent of the vote.
   The victory was expected but the margin was large enough to
worry some observers and even some in Iliescu's own party about the
goal of establishing a true democracy with a strong opposition
party.
   Iliescu's two opponents said they will seek to nullify the
election on grounds of fraud and indicated it was unlikely they
would join a national unity government. And at least 4,000
protesters filled Bucharest's University Square shouting that the
election was a fraud.
   Lieberman, who said the Romanian capital was still riddled with
bullet holes from the fighting that led to the overthrow of
dictator Nicolae Ceausescu, said ``violence and intimidation'' were
reported by members of the opposition parties. But he said the
reports of telephone harassment and even some beatings could not be
linked conclusively to the Iliescu government.
   ``While I could not conclude that the government party and the
president himself had anything directly to do with that violence
and intimidation, the president did not go out of his way to
condemn it,'' Lieberman said, ``and I think that contributed to an
unfortunate atmosphere there.''
   Lieberman said the United States should provide training and
emergency aid, particularly for babies in Romanian orphanages, many
of whom have suffered from a lack of medical care.
   ``But we ought not to write a blank and permanent check to the
government,'' he said. ``Long-term funding should be made
contingent upon continued movement toward democracy.''
   Lieberman was one of three co-leaders of a 60-member
international delegation sponsored by the National Democratic
Institute for International Affairs. The group is chaired by former
Vice President Walter Mondale and includes many prominent Democrats
among its senior advisers.

   Zsa Zsa Gabor's Rolls-Royce had no star
appeal for bidders at the annual Bennett Investor Auction, who
offered less than half the value.
   ``Perhaps the right-wing audience didn't respond to it,'' Terry
Cooper, spokesman for the auction, said Monday.
   Auctioneers said the actress was driving the Rolls when she had
her renowned run-in with a Beverly Hills motorcycle policeman. A
California jury convicted her of charges alleging she slapped the
officer after he stopped her.
   The Rolls drew a $23,000 bid, too low to bring a sale, Cooper
said. Appraisers estimated the Rolls was worth more than twice
that, he said.

   Stormie Jones, the world's longest surviving
heart-liver transplant patient, was released from a hospital
Tuesday and doctors said a mild episode of liver rejection appeared
to be under control.
   ``We're out of the hospital and are staying with friends,'' said
Stormie's mother, Lois ``Suzie'' Purcell.
   ``She's doing better. ... They know she doesn't like to be in
the hospital, so they are trying to make it as comfortable for her
as possible.''
   Stormie could return to her White Settlement, Texas, home within
a few days, possibly by May 31, her 13th birthday, Mrs. Purcell
said.
   Stormie returned to Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh on Sunday
after routine tests showed high liver enzyme levels, a sign of
possible organ rejection.
   Further tests revealed the rejection was moderate and could be
controlled with increased doses of an experimental anti-rejection
medication Stormie has taken since November, said hospital
spokeswoman Sue Cardillo.
   Doctors do not think Stormie will need a third liver transplant.
   Stormie takes FK-506, which the Food and Drug Administration
approved for use only at Children's and nearby
Presbyterian-University Hospital.
   She received the drug intravenously in the hospital and will
resume taking it orally.
   Dr. Robert D. Gordon, transplant surgeon at Children's, said
Monday, ``When you're using a new drug you're a little sensitive to
toxicity, over-sensitive perhaps. We now realize we lowered our
dosages a little too much.''
   Modifications in dosages also will be made for many of the 400
transplant patients currently taking FK-506. ``I think we've been
making that error systematically over the last few months,'' Gordon
said.
   In 1984, Stormie received the double transplant to control a
congenital condition that left her cholesterol levels 10 times
higher than normal.
   She returned to Pittsburgh for a second liver transplant,
performed early this year, after hepatitis damaged her first donor
liver.

   White House and congressional negotiators
moved toward a consensus on Tuesday that they must find about $500
billion in new taxes and spending cuts over the next five years to
balance the budget, participants said.
   At the third round of high-level deficit-reduction talks in the
Capitol, the Bush administration also unveiled a new, higher
estimate of the costs of rescuing the savings and loan industry.
The administration now says the bailout could cost as much as $61
billion next year, participants said, about $11 billion higher than
previous estimates.
   Democrats and Republicans remained divided over precisely how
much savings would be needed to balance the budget within five
years. Democrats said $500 billion or more was necessary, citing
estimates by the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office.
   Republicans said the total necessary could be between $400
billion to $500 billion. They relied on projections by the White
House's Office of Management and Budget, which until now has been
saying that an improving economy will allow the budget to be
balanced by 1995. OMB presented figures Tuesday showing that unless
action is taken, the budget would still be $32 billion in the red
in 1995.
   Nonetheless, both sides emerged from their meeting having
narrowed their differences somewhat over the size of the deficit
problem the government faces. They also spoke optimistically about
their prospects for finding a solution.
   ``The future looks very good to me in terms of us being able to
get it done,'' said Sen. Pete Domenici of New Mexico, ranking
Republican on the Senate Budget Committee.
   ``There's no consensus yet, but I don't think we'd characterize
the meetings as containing any sharp disagreements,'' said Senate
Budget Committee Chairman James Sasser, D-Tenn.
   Negotiators did not discuss proposals for how budget savings
would be achieved, a stage that participants say is weeks away.
Tuesday's three-hour session was dominated by technical discussions
by White House and congressional budget experts about how large the
federal deficit appears to be.
   ``We're continuing to define the problem,'' Sasser said.
   Participants said the administration's new estimated costs of
the savings and loan bailout remained uncertain. House Budget
Committee Chairman Leon Panetta, D-Calif., called the $61 billion
figure ``a real hit-and-miss number.''
   Before Tuesday's meeting, Sasser said he believed Social
Security benefits should be off-limits as negotiators search for
ways to shrink next year's federal deficit.
   Sasser, in stating his opposition to paring Social Security
payments, raised an issue nearly as politically sensitive as the
question of new taxes.
   Members of both parties are reluctant to antagonize the nation's
39 million retirees who receive Social Security benefits.
Republicans lawmakers in particular have been cautious on the issue
ever since they backed an effort to limit benefits in 1985 from
which then-President Reagan eventually backed away.
   Sasser conceded that negotiators would ``talk about everything,
but said it would be unfair to turn to Social Security for deficit
reduction.
   The payroll tax paid by workers and their employers has been
boosted this year, he said, noting that the Social Security system
is running an annual surplus of tens of billions of dollars.
   ``I don't see the equity in that,'' Sasser said of benefit
cutbacks.
   Social Security is expected to cost the government about $265
billion next year, about one-fifth of the total budget. Advocates
of trimming benefits as part of a deficit-reduction package argue
that it comprises too large a portion of the budget to ignore.
   The retirement system is expected to run a $74 billion surplus
next year as it builds up a cushion to pay for retiring baby
boomers in the next century. The payroll tax rate edged up by 0.14
percent in January to 7.65 percent.
   It's likely to be several meetings before budget negotiators
begin swapping proposals about cutting the deficit for the next
fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1. The opening discussions have
focused on technical issues.
   The goal of the talks is to find ways to reduce the 1991
shortfall to $64 billion, the target set by the Gramm-Rudman
deficit-reduction law.
   If the budget gap exceeds that amount by $10 billion, the law
triggers whatever spending cuts are necessary to lower the gap to
$64 billion.
   The White House has been increasing its projection of the 1991
deficit since January, when it said a $100 billion shortfall was
likely.
   Last week, the administration estimated the shortfall at between
$123 billion and $138 billion. That excluded the costs of shoring
up the savings and loan industry, which could have a $50 billion
pricetag.
   The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office estimates a 1991
budget gap between $149 billion and $159 billion. With the thrift
bailout, the gap could grow to as much as $246 billion, CBO said.

<TEXT>
   North and South Yemen joined Tuesday to
become one nation, the Republic of Yemen, an impoverised country
sitting on newly discovered oil reserves.
   Gen. Ali Abdullah Saleh, the president of the unified state,
raised the new country's red, white and black flag atop the
portside Presidential Council building at noon.
   The Coast Guard fired several cannon shots, and anchored vessels
blew their whistles.
   The republic is poor but has recently located oil reserves
unofficially put at 2 billion barrels. The nation sits on the
strategically located Bab al-Mandab, a strait at the southern
outlet of the Red Sea into the Indian Ocean.
   Saleh said at a rally that the republic will honor all treaties
either of the former countries concluded.
   About 2,000 people attended and interrupted Saleh's address
several times with loud applause.
   ``The Republic of Yemen will be a factor for stability and
security in the Arabian Peninsula and the gulf region and a strong
bastion for the Arab nations, the Arab League and joint Arab
action,'' Saleh said.
   ``The Republic of Yemen will extend its hand to all states for
fruitful cooperation in fulfilling our national duties, led by
those toward the Palestinian people,'' he added.
   Palestine Liberation Organization Chairman Yasser Arafat was the
only Arab leader who attended the ceremony. He delivered a brief
congratulatory message.
   Arab foreign ministers meeting in the Iraqi capital, Baghdad, to
prepare for an Arab summit hailed the unification.
   Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal said it would
improve ``the stability of the region.''
   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler
said the United States welcomed the union and will review its
listing of South Yemen as a country that supports terrorism.
   ``We welcome this declaration as a measure that could improve
stability and security in the region,'' she told reporters.
``Obviously it has not changed that South Yemen is on the terrorist
list in the hours that this has taken place.''
   Saleh met with President Bush at the White House last January
and the United States resumed diplomatic relations with South Yemen
last April 30 after a break of nearly 21 years.
   The merger was approved Monday by the parliaments of the former
countries. It was pushed through several days earlier than planned
so the Yemens could attend the Arab summit as one nation.
   The new nation has 11 million people _ 9 million from the north
and 2 million from the south _ and is one of the poorest countries
in the world.
   South Yemen became the Arab world's only Marxist state after it
gained independence from Britain in 1967.
   Although it received aid from the Soviet Union, the south's
economy had languished for 20 years, and there had been widespread
labor unrest in recent months. Some Arab diplomatic sources said
the south endorsed unity mainly because of the democratic reforms
sweeping Eastern Europe.
   Scores of Cuban and East German military experts are said to
have left the south in recent months. A friendship pact entitles
the Soviets to maintain as many as 18,000 troops in Yemen, but the
extent of their deployment is unknown.
   San`a will be the capital of the new state, and Aden the main
commercial center. San`a was formerly the capital of the north and
Aden the capital of the south.
   Saleh, 48, was elected president of the five-man Presidential
Council that will rule Yemen.
   Ali Salem al-Beidh, the secretary-general of the socialist party
that had ruled the south, was elected vice-president.
   The three others on the Presidential Council are Salem Saleh
Mohammed, al-Beidh's deputy; Abdul-Aziz al-Arashi, a lawmaker from
the north; and Abdul-Aziz Abdul-Ghani, the former prime minister of
the north.
   A planned transition period of 2{ years coincides with the
remainder of the five-year terms for the legislatures of the former
nations.
   It was the second such union between two Arab states in this
century. Egypt and Syria joined for three years as the United Arab
Republic, but the merger collapsed in 1961 with Damascus accusing
Cairo of betrayal and of wrecking its economy.

   Hundreds of demonstrators chased a
high-ranking government representative into a downtown hotel
Tuesday evening, forcing him to abandon his attempt to hold a
dialogue with hunger strikers.
   Anti-communist protesters have occupied University Square and
blocked the capital's central intersection since April 22.
   On Tuesday, the government made its most determined effort to
date to establish a dialogue with the demonstrators.
   Justice Minister Teofil Pop and Sever Georgescu, the
government's secretary general, were sent to speak to 24 hunger
strikers, some of whom have been without food for more than three
weeks.
   Six of the hunger strikers passed out but were revived Monday.
   The demonstrators _ who numbered at least 4,000 Tuesday _ and
hunger strikers have been demanding the exclusion from politics of
former Communists, such as interim President Ion Iliescu. The
protesters now also are charging that Sunday's election was
fraudulent. They are demanding a televised dialogue with Iliescu
and Prime Minister Petre Roman.
   Iliescu and his National Salvation Front won resounding
victories in Sunday's elections. They have dominated political life
here since dictator Nicolae Ceausescu was deposed and executed in
the December revolution.
   The hunger strikers had not been informed of the delegation's
impending arrival, but news media were notified and dozens of
journalists converged on the crowded tent encampment in the square.
   ``We have had enough of the BBC and the Americans, who
acknowledged the government,'' said Dumitru Dinca, a spokesman for
the Anti-Totalitarian Front protest group. ``We shall do justice by
ourselves, without either the Russians or the Americans.''
   When Georgescu arrived he was surrounded menacingly by a
fast-growing crowd of people who took him for Interior Minister
Mihai Chitac, whose resignation has been demanded by the protesters.
   The crowd grew increasingly vocal and violent. Then one
protester grabbed Georgescu by the collar, forcing him to flee into
the Intercontinental Hotel.
   He left the hotel through a back door as hundreds of whistling,
booing protesters berated him and shouted: ``You thieves stole the
revolution!''
   Pop continued talking with the hunger strikers without being
disturbed. But as he tried to leave he, too, was surrounded by
angry demonstrators and had to be protected by hunger strikers as
he plowed his way to his official car.
   The government later released a statement saying its
representatives ``were unable to hold a dialogue with the hunger
strikers because of the aggressive intervention of some people .. .
who, through their violence, gave their political demands a
profoundly undemocratic character.''
   ``These people are violating the laws of the country both in
their political actions and in their physical aggression against
the representatives of the government ... in violation of the
elementary laws governing public peace and order.''
   Iliescu called for the square to be ``cleaned out'' last week,
but the goverment chose to tolerate the demonstration through the
election.

   British Defense Secretary Tom King on
Tuesday raised the possibility that negotiators would fail to wrap
up an accord this year to slash troops, tanks and other non-nuclear
weapons in Europe.
   ``We haven't got (an) agreement yet and ... we aren't sure when
we're going to get one,'' King told reporters at a meeting of the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   Western officials have complained in recent weeks that the
Soviet Union has slowed progress in reaching a conventional arms
treaty, although they have said they were optimistic a deal could
be struck in the fall.
   The West has insisted an agreement must be reached before the
holding of a summit of leaders of the 35 nations that form the
Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe. The Soviets have
urged the conference be held this year.
   The key two-day NATO meeting was to review what U.S. Defense
Secretary Dick Cheney called ``new ways of doing business'' in an
era of reduced East-West tensions.
   On Monday, West European defense ministers, meeting separately
at the alliance headquarters in Brussels, urged NATO to ``adapt to
the changing security environment.''
   As an example of new strategy in response to the impending
unification of Germany, Cheney said a NATO corps could be formed
with divisions from different nations.
   Such a force would also ``emphasize the fact that (Germany) is
not treated any differently than anyone else,'' he told reporters
aboard his flight to Brussels.
   King, who met with high-level Soviet officials in Moscow last
week, said there was ``certainly a risk'' that a conventional arms
agreement would not be reached this year.
   ``We're not happy about it,'' he said. ``We want to see an early
resolution. There's no change in our position.''
   West German Defense Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg told reporters
in a separate news conference that the arms talks have become more
complicated.
   Negotiators for the 16 NATO nations and the seven members of the
Soviet-led Warsaw Pact have been bargaining in Vienna to try to
bring both sides to equal ceilings in main battle tanks, armored
combat vehicles, artillery, troops, combat aircraft and combat
helicopters.
   The two sides are still trying to agree on a ceiling for combat
aircraft and on measures to verify compliance with the accord.
   King said the Kremlin was concerned about the talks in light of
the political upheavals in its one-time staunch Warsaw Pact allies.
   ``There's no doubt there are worries,'' he said.
   He said it was unclear whether the Soviets were dragging their
feet as a bargaining ploy or not. But he said they appeared to be
placing more emphasis on the international talks on German unity.
   He said the Soviets appeared to feel there would not be ``any
great embarrassment'' if there were a delay of a few months.
   A key clause of the proposed deal _ called the sufficiency rule
_ would limit the holdings of any one country to a certain
percentage of the overall number of tanks, artillery and other
equipment.
   The Soviets, however, argue that countries like Czechoslovakia,
Hungary and East Germany are not as tightly bound to the Kremlin as
they once were and East Germany may soon be joining West Germany to
form a united country.

   Prosecutors sought Tuesday to modify charges
against an art gallery being prosecuted for obscenity for
exhibiting photographs by the late Robert Mapplethorpe.
   At a hearing originally called on a request by the Contemporary
Arts Center to dismiss the charges, Hamilton County authorities
asked to reword an indictment to conform to wording in a U.S.
Supreme Court ruling on obscenity.
   The wording is one of the grounds on which the art center is
seeking to have the charges dismissed. Hamilton County Municipal
Judge David Albanese set a hearing for Thursday to review the
prosecution request.
   The judge said he planned to visit the 175-photograph exhibit,
which closes Saturday, before ruling on the request to dismiss the
charges.
   Such conservative lawmakers as Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., and
Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., have attacked the National
Endowment for the Arts for supporting Mapplethorpe's exhibition.
   Gallery director Dennis Barrie and the gallery are charged with
pandering obscenity and using children in material involving
nudity. If convicted, they would face $6,000 in fines. Barrie also
would face six months in jail.
   The charges concern seven photos, five of homoerotic acts and
two with nude or nearly nude children.
   Senior assistant city Prosecutor Frank H. Prouty Jr. said the
city wants the indictment to specify that photographs of two nude
children in the exhibit include ``a lewd, graphic exhibition of the
genitals.''
   The indictment issued April 7 says the exhibition includes ``a
photograph of a minor male child ... with his genitals exposed, and
a photograph of a minor female child ... with her genitals
exposed.''
   Prouty also asked to add a phrase to the indictment to allege
that five pictures of sex acts in the exhibit are obscene as
defined by the Supreme Court's ruling in Miller vs. California.
   In the 1973 decision, the Supreme Court said that in order to be
obscene, material must violate community standards, depict clearly
offensive sexual conduct and lack artistic value.
   H. Louis Sirkin, a lawyer for the art gallery, said he will
oppose the city's request, contending the judge should not have the
power to alter a grand jury's indictment. ``It has to come from the
grand jury,'' he said.

<HEAD>Boesky Gives First Public Testimony in Wall Street Scandal</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ivan F. Boesky calmly admitted Tuesday that he
paid for inside information with briefcases full of cash as Wall
Street's most celebrated felon gave his first public testimony
since his 1986 plea bargain.
   Testifying against former friend John A. Mulheren Jr. on
securities fraud charges, Boesky recounted the crimes he committed
with other players in Wall Street's insider trading scandal _ such
as Dennis Levine, formerly with Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., and
investment banker Martin Siegel.
   ``Did you understand you were committing a crime when you traded
on inside information from Dennis Levine?,'' asked Assistant U.S.
Attorney Scott Gilbert.
   ``Yes,'' Boesky said in a firm and loud voice.
   Boesky, center of the biggest insider trading crime scandal in
Wall Street history, made his entrance through a back door of
Manhattan federal court, where he faced Mulheren and a packed
courtroom. It was Boesky's first public appearance since he was
released early from a three-year prison term last month.
   Clean-shaven, white hair cropped short, Boesky wore a charcoal
gray suit, white shirt and dark tie. Mulheren, a well-known and
eccentric speculator who wears casual clothes, sat at the defense
table several yards away.
   Boesky testified that he received inside information about
proposed takeover attempts from Levine and Siegel, and that he had
agreed to pay them up to five percent of his firm's profits for
their help.
   He said he never gave Levine any money. Siegel, however,
recieved a total of $800,000 in three cash deliveries, Boesky said.
   ``It was assembled by a colleague out of my personal accounts,
put into a briefcase and handed by an intermediary to Mr. Siegel,''
Boesky said.
   A fourth cash delivery to Siegel was canceled when he recieved
word about a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into
Levine's dealings, he said.
   Levine, the first to implicate Boesky, pleaded guilty to felony
charges in June 1986 and agreed to cooperate with prosecutors.
Seigel also pleaded guilty to securities fraud-related counts and
is awaiting sentencing.
   Boesky is the government's main witness against Mulheren on
charges of stock manipulation and other securities fraud
violations. His testimony was expected to be the high point of the
trial.
   The two once were close friends but Mulheren became enraged when
he learned Boesky had implicated him in wrongdoing a few years ago.
At one point Mulheren allegedly plotted to assassinate him with an
assault rifle. Weapons charges against Mulheren were subsequently
dropped.
   Boesky, who avoided eye contact with Mulheren, described
Mulheren as a business associate and friend, who once helped save
his trading company from collapse.
   He said Mulheren was one of his few friends with whom he shared
the information he received from Levine and Seigel, although he
never revealed its source.
   Mulheren, 40, is accused of manipulating one stock price and
concealing ownership of other stocks to help Boesky cheat on his
taxes and evade federal securities laws.
   For example, Boesky said that in July 1985, Mulheren's firm,
Jamie Securities, bought 330,000 shares of Unocal Corp. stock that
he held, with the understanding Boesky would compensate him for any
losses in the stock's value. Boesky's testimony is expected to take
days. He returns to the witness stand on Wednesday.
   When asked during the lunch break for his reaction to Boesky's
testimony, Mulheren said, ``Not much excitement.''
   Boesky paid $100 million in penalties and pleaded guilty to one
felony to settle the biggest insider trading case ever. In exchange
he gave government investigators incriminating information about a
number of others.
   The biggest victims of Boesky's information were the now-defunct
investment banking company Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and its
junk-bond trading specialist Michael Milken. Both have pleaded
guilty to numerous fraud charges that include fines with a combined
total exceeding $1 billion.
   Mulheren is charged with 41 counts of conspiracy, securities
fraud, mail fraud and violating federal record-keeping laws. He
faces a maximum five years in prison and $250,000 fine on each
count.

<HEAD>House Panel Approves Dairy Support Program</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House Agriculture Committee voted Tuesday
to establish a national dairy program that guarantees farmers
$10.10 per hundred pounds of milk as long as surpluses stay below 5
billion pounds.
   The section of the 1990 farm bill differs from a plan approved
earlier by the panel's subcommittee on livestock, dairy and poultry.
   That proposal included producer assessments and set up a
two-tiered price support system that would have given farmers one
price for the bulk of their milk and a lesser price for the amount
considered excess by the government.
   Rep. Charles Stenholm, D-Texas, chairman of the subcommittee,
said the bill brought before the full committee was changed because
so many people in Congress and the industry disagreed with the
original plan.
   ``This is an effort to allow everyone to have an opportunity to
have their opinion heard,'' said Stenholm, who presented the new
plan with Rep. Steve Gunderson of Wisconsin, the ranking Republican
on the subcommittee.
   ``This is a dairy support program to provide stability to
producers,'' said Gunderson.
   The two lawmakers successfully fought off amendments offered in
committee that would have further redesigned the dairy program.
   The government traditionally has supported dairy farmers by
setting a price it will pay for storable dairy products, such as
cheese, butter and non-fat dry milk, that aren't bought by
processors in the open market.
   However, overproduction has been an expensive problem for the
government that lawmakers have been trying to correct.
   The plan adopted by the committee Tuesday would maintain for the
next five years the current price of $10.10 per hundredweight of
milk, if surpluses bought up by the government are between 3.5
billion and 5 billion pounds. If surpluses fall below 3.5 billion,
the government would pay $10.55 per hundredweight.
   However, if dairy farmers produce between 5.01 billion and 7
billion pounds more than the market will bear, the government will
pay only $9.85 to $9.60 per hundredweight.
   If more than 7 billion pounds of surpluses result in any one
year of the five-year farm bill, the Agriculture Department would
be authorized to establish an inventory management program.
   Stenholm emphasized that the price support system does not
include assessments or a rigid quota system. These portions of the
earlier version of the bill were considered its main problem.

<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Argentine First Lady Zulema Menem
told a federal judge Tuesday she has received telephoned threats
warning that she would be killed unless she ``stopped talking.''
   Judge Remigio Gonzalez Moreno interviewed Mrs. Menem at her
private residence and told reporters she informed him regarding two
threats allegedly made by an anonymous male caller who warned her
``not to make any more statements.''
   Gonzalez Moreno was named to investigate after Mrs. Menem
reported receiving the threats last month at the official
presidential residence in the Buenos Aires suburb of Olivos.
   Mrs. Menem often has made public statements highly critical of
political and economic policies by her husband, President Carlos
Menem, who was inaugurated July 8. She also has charged her husband
is surrounded by corrupt and untrustworthy aides and advisors.
   Menem, 59, a former provincial governor and member of the
labor-based Peronist party, has surprised many Argentines by
advocating replacement of the country's inefficient,
state-controlled economy with a free-market economy in the hopes of
ending four decades of inflation and economic stagnation.
   Mrs. Menem, 46, maintaining friendships with several of her
husband's political foes, has adhered to a more traditional
Peronist view, questioning in public her husband's policies and the
effect they will have on workers, retirees and the poor in this
nation of 32 million residents.
   She charged in January that the telephones at the presidential
residence had been tapped and her outgoing calls blocked in what
she described as an effort to ``isolate'' her. That charge also is
under investigation by a federal judge.
   Argentine media reported last week that Menem had moved out of
the residence and would seek a legal separation or divorce from his
wife. The couple, married 24 years but reported for years to have
been estranged, has two children, daughter Zulema Eva, 19, and son
Carlos, 21.
   Menem and his wife have refused comment on the report.

<HEAD>NATO Defense Chiefs Approve Use of Multinational Forces</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Military Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and
other NATO defense chiefs on Tuesday backed using their soldiers to
form multinational armies in Europe to keep NATO solidarity alive.
   The proposal, if enacted, would result in an overhaul of the
40-year-old pact's military structure.
   Supporters say it is aimed at producing renewed political
support for the alliance among member nations as they face the
evaporation of the Warsaw Pact and as they prepare to welcome a
unified Germany into their ranks.
   ``Given the changing threat, there is no alternative,'' said
Cmdr. Stefan Lang, a spokesman for the West German defense
ministry. ``Existing forces will be hollowed out and we have to
reconfigure them.''
   Gen. Vigleik Eide, who serves as chairman of the alliance's
Military Committee, formally declared NATO's primary military foe
conquered at the morning session, telling reporters, ``It is our
clear assessment that the threat from a united Warsaw Pact no
longer exists.''
   But the Norwegian general cautioned the Soviet Union, despite
its economic and political turmoil, still wields forces that are
``very impressive'' and continues to modernize its forces.
   Given chances for reduced troop levels in Europe with the
completion of a proposed East-West accord on conventional forces
and prospects for sharp cuts in U.S. troops based in Europe, the
idea of using multinational military units in NATO nations has
garnered support among the defense ministers, Lang and other NATO
officials said.
   The proposal was discussed as the ministers began a two-day
session to review the pact's military strategy at this time of
reduced East-West tension.
   During their conferences, the ministers also agreed to take a
thorough look at their military strategy that has guided the
alliance through the Cold War years.
   ``We reached agreement on that,'' said Britain's defense chief
Tom King. ``We're keen to see (it) go ahead.''
   Italian Defense Minister Mino Martinazzoli said the study must
be ``daring.''
   The officials said the study should take a look at the whole
range of military practices that NATO has followed for many years,
including exercises, conventional and nuclear weapons and the
deployment of forces along the front line _ which has been put in
question by prospects of a unified Germany.
   The ministers also agreed in their closed-door talks to scrap
the defense spending guideline that calls for an annual 3 percent
increase.
   NATO officials said they would also like to bring France _ which
is outside the joint military structure _ into the alliance's
defense planning.
   Cheney, speaking with reporters en route to Brussels, backed the
idea of building multinational forces.
   At present, NATO land forces defend territory under a so-called
``layer cake'' formula by which an army from an allied nation
defends a certain geographic sector.
   With the elimination of the border between East and West
Germany, such a system would have to be revamped.
   ``If all present, positive trends continue ... then we can
contemplate new ways of doing business,'' Cheney said.
   ``I think, based on a first look, the notion of a multinational
force has some appeal,'' Cheney said. ``I think it's worth
pursuing.''
   Using multinational forces in NATO could offer cost savings and
ease nationalist sensitivities, particularly in West Germany where
most NATO troops are stationed, said a senior defense official
traveling with Cheney.
   Such forces could also help blunt any drive to take a unified
Germany out of NATO.
   ``One way to emphasize the multilateral nature of the NATO
alliance is to have units that are composed of troops of various
nations,'' Cheney said. Such a plan would also ``emphasize the fact
that (Germany) is not treated any differently than anyone else.''
   As an example, Cheney said a multinational corps could be formed
with three divisions each from a different nation. A U.S. division
is made up of about 15,000 to 18,000 soldiers.
   Soldiers of multinational units could be based in Britain or
Canada for training exercises, the official said.
   Such an arrangement could help reduce complaints among West
German citizens. West Germans have grown increasingly irritated
with NATO military exercises and accidents caused by low-flying
aircraft.
   But the official cautioned that setting up multinational forces
poses many problems, including language barriers and varied weapons
systems.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Advisers Approve Radical Plans for Economy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mikhail S. Gorbachev's presidential council of
advisers approved a plan Tuesday that would double food prices next
year and introduce other radical reforms to ease the Soviet Union
into a market economy by 1995.
   The council stressed the need to help the poor survive the high
prices by introducing compensation and indexing, the official news
agency Tass reported.
   The government plan will be presented to the Supreme Soviet
legislature on Thursday by Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, Foreign
Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov told reporters.
   An accompanying resolution decrees that prices on bread, so
cheap some of it is used to feed cattle, will be raised as early as
July to offset higher grain prices. But it also calls for immediate
compensation to help poor people buy bread, their main staple.
   The resolution also says new laws are needed on free enterprise,
anti-trust, foreign investment, income indexing, employment,
banking and customs. It requires the laws be ready for passage in
September.
   The program is designed to rescue an economy plagued by huge
shortages, strikes and ethnic conflicts.
   While outlining major price increases and other reforms, the
report emphasized the need to control inflation, unemployment and
other social ills.
   The government will continue to regulate the cost of basic
foodstuffs, including meat, bread and cooking oil, a draft of the
planned reforms said. The reforms would stagger the cumulative
shock over five years instead of the two discussed earlier.
   Soviet officials are wary lest abrupt increases in food prices
set off riots and strikes, like those that toppled Polish Communist
governments in the 1970s and 1980s.
   The plan is far more radical than the government program
presented in December to the Soviet Congress, the Supreme Soviet's
parent parliament. But it falls short of the free-market measures
in Poland that led to a spurt of rapid inflation the past six
months.
   The earlier plan basically called for three more years of a
centrally planned economy, but sentiment is growing that faster
steps are needed to improve production and distribution.
   A report by Ryzhkov on the revised plan said, ``The negative
effect of political instability, strikes and inter-ethnic conflicts
is growing ever stronger.'' It asked workers to refrain from
striking.
   A parliamentary opposition group attacked the proposed program
and plans to present an alternative economic blueprint advocating a
market economy.
   The independent news service Post-Factum quoted Siberian
economist Gennady Filshin as saying, ``This is just another ploy to
intimidate the people with the idea of a free market and
consolidate its own positions.''
   The Kremlin's new readiness to take harsh measures become more
understandable in the light of disturbing figures on current
economic performance. In the first quarter of 1990, cash incomes
grew by 13.4 percent while the gross national product declined, the
report says.
   Up to April, political strikes and inter-ethnic conflicts led to
the loss of 9.5 million man-hours, compared to 7 million man-hours
lost in all of 1989.
   Prices in state stores for many basic foods presently are low.
Potatoes cost as little as 8 cents a pound and beef $1.80 a pound.
   But the Soviet economy is plagued by shortages, with commodities
rationed in some regions and beef at about $16 a pound at free
prices in farmers' markets and new potatoes at up to $8 a pound.
   About 290 million people live in the Soviet Union.

   U.S. and European television programs will be
broadcast to the Soviet Union by the end of the decade to satisfy
viewers who are tired of watching politics, a Soviet official said
on Tuesday.
   The Western programs will be transmitted via satellite and the
number of national televsion stations will be raised from two to
five, said Mikhail Nenachev, president of the State Committee for
Broadcasting.
   ``There is no political problem'' with Western programs, he told
reporters at the Media Summit, a conference of broadcast
specialists and policy makers from Europe and the United States.
   ``As far as European and U.S. programs are concerned, we are
working very hard to receive them in the Soviet Union,'' he said.
``But because of technical difficulties, I do not think we will
have it (on a large scale) in the near future.''
   He said Soviets are bored of watching the often televised
political debates and are hungry for European and American movies,
television shows, music and youth programs.
   ``In these days of `glasnost' and `perestroika,' our television
uses most of its time for political items. It's too much,'' he
said. He was using the two Russian words for President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev's system of political reforms.
   ``We forgot about culture, news and music. We want to make it
more balanced,'' Nenachev said.
   He said Soviet television also wants to show a European music
channel and will add three more national stations. Channels for
``alternative companies'' such as trade unions or youth groups are
also under study, Nenachev said.
   But private stations are still out of the question.
   ``We are not ready for that,'' he said.
   To accommodate the increase in channels and broadcast time, the
Soviet Union plans to launch 10 commercial satellites over the next
three years.

   ``Gonzo'' journalist Hunter Thompson was
ordered Tuesday to stand trial on drug and explosives charges after
a hearing featuring some low-key antics by the celebrity defendant.
   Mesa County District Court Judge Charles Buss ruled there was
sufficient evidence to try the author of such books as ``Fear and
Loathing in Las Vegas'' on five felony charges of possessing drugs
and possessing and storing explosives illegally.
   The judge threw out charges of cocaine use in the case, which
stemmed from complaints by a woman who also alleged Thompson
assaulted her in his home in February. Misdemeanor assault charges
weren't considered Tuesday.
   Thompson, 53, figeted throughout the hearing and at times
muttered under his breath, ``That's bull'' or ``Ah, come on,''
particularly during testimony by his accuser.
   She is Gail Palmer-Slater, 35, of Port Huron, Mich., a business
entrepreneur and former porn film producer who had written Thompson
several weeks earlier saying she wanted to meet him.
   The case began when she complained to Pitkin County authorities
that she had been sexually assaulted while visiting Thompson. She
said Thompson threw a drink at her, twisted her breast and shoved
her during the visit.
   Her complaint led to a two-day search in which authorities found
LSD, cocaine, Diazapam, and marijuana and four sticks of dynamite
at Thompson's house.
   Thompson, father of so-called ``gonzo journalism,'' has written
books on subjects as diverse as political campaigns and the Hell's
Angels, dwelling as much on the drug-drenched antics of the writer
as on the subject at hand.
   At the noon break Thompson, the inspiration for the Duke
character in the ``Doonesbury'' comic strip, left the courthouse
followed by photographers and reporters and at one point stopped to
pose.
   ``Let me do a Nixon,'' he said, stopping to raise his arms and
flash a V-for-victory signal with both hands.
   Later, asked to comment on the ruling, he growled, ``Today's pig
is tomorrow's bacon.''
   Protesters outside 99-year-old courthouse waved signs saying,
``When the going gets weird, the weird go to jail.'' Another read,
``Today the doctor, tomorrow you,'' in an apparent reference to a
search of his home that Thompson has called excessively thorough.
   Thompson denies assaulting Palmer-Slater, maintaining she was
drunk and pressuring him to have sex with her when he pushed her
away.
   Hal Haddon, Thompson's attorney, argued the drugs couldn't be
proven to belong to Thompson because he has so many visitors. He
said the explosives didn't belong to Thompson, but to someone who
used them to blow up beaver dams, stumps and other obstacles to
irrigation water.
   Trial was tentatively set for June 25.

<HEAD>Mexican President Agrees to Seek Free-Trade Pact With U.S.</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Carlos Salinas de Gortari accepted
Senate recommendations Tuesday to seek a free-trade agreement with
the United States, but economists and advisers said such a pact
isn't likely to occur soon.
   The U.S.-Canada free-trade initiative, proposed in 1985 and
begun in January, wasn't signed into law until last year.
   ``The recommendations will be the framework in which ... my
administration will carry on Mexico's trade negotiations,'' Salinas
told 55 senators at the presidential residence.
   Meanwhile in Washington, President Bush told a U.S. business
group interested in promoting Latin American trade, ``We in the
U.S. must do all we can to ensure the future of free markets in the
Americas because our nation has a stake in the economic health of
this hemisphere.''
   Mexican Commerce Department adviser Jaime Zabludovsky denied
reports that a partial free-trade agreement would be signed when
Salinas and Bush meet June 10-12.
   Salinas said he would study Senate recommendations with an eye
toward integrating Mexico, which has about 85 million residents, in
the changing economic world.
   ``Mexico will not be left out of the new world configuration.
The speed of the changes requires decisive answers on all fronts,
in all markets,'' he said.
   The Senate recommendations also advise Salinas to take advantage
of Mexico's strategic location next to the United States to expand
trade with Pacific rim countries and Europe.
   ``We have given the president a broad mandate in all foreign
trade relations,'' said Senate Foreign Relations Committee
chairwoman Blanca Esponda.
   The 64-member Senate is the only authority that must approve
presidential agreements with foreign countries.
   Its recommendations were based on trade strategies proposed by
academics, entrepreneurs and politicians, sponsored by the Senate
at Salinas' request.
   ``The majority of the participants said that one of the main
advantages of free trade agreement between Mexico and the United
States, would be a greater flow of foreign investment to Mexico due
to the unbridled access to the U.S. market that Mexico would
have,'' Senate president Maximiliano Silerio Esparza said in
reading its recommendations to Salinas.
   The recommendations were based on hopes of permanent access to
the U.S. market and lowering U.S. trade barriers on agricultural,
textile and cement products, Silerio Esparza said.
   He said the recommendations include a transition period to let
Mexican industry change to survive an onslaught of American goods
onto the Mexican domestic market.
   Until recently high Mexican tariffs kept out many American goods
or made them more expensive than similar Mexican products. Because
of a lack of foreign competitition, the prices of Mexican products
were in some cases artificially high.
   Mexican industry began feeling the pressure from lower-priced
imports after Mexico joined the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade in 1988.
   Silerio Esparza noted some participants in the trade strategy
forums opposed closer commercial ties with the United States on the
grounds they would promote dependence, a topic of particular
concern in Mexico.
   Salinas agreed to Senate recommendations that Mexico stop short
of seeking an economic union with the United States of the type
planned by Europe for 1992.
   He said such union ``is not compatible with the national
objectives of sovereignty that we will always defend.''
   In campaign speeches leading up to July 1988 presidential
elections Salinas opposed a free-trade agreement with the United
States. But the U.S.-Canada agreement and the pending European plan
have posed new threats of competition to Mexico's export market.

<TEXT>
   About 500 anti-apartheid demonstrators
formed a human chain around the foreign ministry on Tuesday to
protest an upcoming visit by South African President F.W. de Klerk.
   The protesters formed a line from Madrid's main square to the
foreign ministry and chanted slogans equating Socialist Prime
Minister Felipe Gonzalez with de Klerk.
   The South African leader is scheduled to arrive Thursday as part
of a nine-nation European tour and will meet with Gonzalez and King
Juan Carlos before leaving the same day.
   Foreign Minister Francisco Fernandez Ordonez and other top
diplomats said they do not plan to lift economic and cultural
sanctions against South Africa during the visit. The sanctions were
imposed to protest against South Africa's system of racial
discrimination.
   One top diplomat said Spain would not change its sanctions
``until the normalization in that country was irreversible.''
   The diplomat also said the leader of the African National
Congress, Nelson Mandela, had accepted an invitation to visit
Spain, but said a date has not yet been set.
   De Klerk's won cautious international approval for his February
decision to release Mandela and other political prisoners. He also
legalized many black political groups such as the ANC and reformed
certain racial laws.
   De Klerk's European trip is the most extensive by any South
African leader since the National Party took power in 1948 and
instituted the system of apartheid.

   Miramax Films said Tuesday it would sue the
Motion Picture Association of America in hopes of getting the ``X''
rating rescinded for ``Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!''
   A statement issued by Miramax said the suit, to be filed
Wednesday in New York, accuses the MPAA of being ``motivated by a
prejudice toward foreign films and a prejudice toward independent
distributors as well as a bias in favor of films released by major
studios.''
   Asked to comment on the announcement late Tuesday, MPAA
officials in Los Angeles referred calls to the organization's New
York office, which was closed.
   ``Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!'', in which a lovesick man kidnaps a
fading movie star, was directed by Spanish filmmaker Pedro
Almodovar. The director also made the offbeat comedy ``Women on the
Verge of a Nervous Breakdown,'' which in 1989 received an Academy
Award nomination for best foreign film.
   The MPAA doesn't publicly announce a reason for giving the
rating, which means no one under 17 is permitted to see the movie.
But a passionate lovemaking scene is believed the reason.
   On April 24, Miramax appealed the decision to the MPAA's Rating
Appeals Board, which upheld the rating on a 6-6 vote. The suit
alleges the decision was arbitrary and capricious.
   In 1968, the MPAA and the National Association of Theater Owners
devised the voluntary system under which filmmakers submit their
movies to be rated.
   Filmmakers, have the option of releasing a film unrated, and
that was done with ``Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!''
   Amanda Marashinky, a publicist at Miramax, noted that many
theaters won't show X-rated or unrated pictures and that many
newspapers won't accept advertising for them.
   ``I think a lot of people have brought up the fact that it isn't
really voluntary,'' Marashinsky said.
   In the past few months, ``Wild Orchid,'' ``Henry: Portrait of a
Serial Killer,'' and ``The Cook, the Thief, His Wife &amp; Her Lover,''
another Miramax film, have also been rated ``X.'' Last year, the
Miramax film ``Scandal'' was rated ``X'', but reduced to ``R''
after an orgy scene was recut.
   Marashinsky said the distributor is seeking an ``R'' rating for
the film, meaning that no one under 17 would be permitted in the
theater without being accompanied by an adult.
   ``Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down'' opened May 4 in New York and Los
Angeles and is also being shown in theaters in Miami and Fort
Lauderdale, Fla. Marashinsky says the film, which opens wide on
Friday, has grossed $250,000.

<HEAD>Cosby Angers Some Black Graduates of Notre Dame</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Bill Cosby, invited to address black
graduates at the University of Notre Dame, drew anger and tears
when he publicly criticized a football player for failing to attain
a 3.0 grade-point average.
   ``I was in shock,'' Kenneth B. Durgans, director of minority
student affairs, said Tuesday. ``I understood the underlying
message, but he was really off-base.''
   Cosby's remarks, made Sunday before about 300 people, mostly
black graduates and their guests, went largely unnoticed beyond the
room until those present voiced their anger this week.
   A spokesman for Cosby in Los Angeles, David Brokaw, couldn't
immediately provide comment from the entertainer.
   Cosby delivered an upbeat and humorous speech at the
university's commencement later Sunday. The earlier, smaller group
had expected a message of challenge and congratulations.
   ``He said essentially that if you do not give 100 percent of
your effort and attempt to exploit your potential each and every
day, that you're compromising,'' said William P. Sexton, vice
president of university relations, who attended the meeting. ``And
when you do that, you get into a habit, and it's a habit that's
hard to break.''
   ``When we left there, he said, `I cannot be party to celebrating
any result that has not been part of the very best effort to reach
excellence,''' he said.
   ``The unfortunate thing was it became personal,'' Sexton said.
``I badly regret some of the folks there found it too tough.''
   Robert Price, a 22-year-old architecture student and member of
the campus Black Cultural Arts Council, said at first he thought
Cosby was joking.
   ``I was saddened by the whole thing, really unimpressed,'' said
Price. ``I was utterly insulted. The person sitting next to me was
in tears.''
   Durgans and Price said Cosby singled out football tackle Dean
Brown.
   ``He asked him, `What's your (grade average),' and he said
`2.5,''' said Price. ``(Cosby) said `that's nothing.'''
   During the exchange that followed, Brown began crying, and Cosby
brought him onto the auditorium stage, Price said, adding that
Brown tried to explain to the actor-comedian his difficulties in
balancing studies and football.
   No one answered the telephone at Brown's dormitory Tuesday and
college officials were unable to provide his whereabouts.
   Another student came to Brown's defense and began arguing with
Cosby, then walked out, said Price.
   ``In all fairness to (Cosby), he had a rationale,'' said
Durgans. ``I think a majority didn't agree with how he dealt with
his rationale.''
   In Los Angeles, Cosby spokesman Brokaw noted that Cosby has
donated millions of dollars for black higher education, and has
criticized alumni of black colleges for not helping more.

<HEAD>Minister Who Resigned Says Quebec Moves toward Sovereignty</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with later comments by Bouchard,
details, reaction. No pickup</NOTE>
<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lucien Bouchard followed up his resignation from
the Cabinet by quitting Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's
Conservatives on Tuesday and declaring that he thinks Quebec's best
bet is sovereignty, in association with Canada.
   Mulroney, struggling to stem the damage to his government caused
by the defection of his old friend and close political ally,
admitted in the House of Commons that the future of the Meech Lake
accord is in serious doubt.
   The proposed constitutional amendment would give all 10
provinces special powers and recognize Quebec as a ``distinct
society'' within Canada. By law, all 10 provinces must ratify Meech
by June 23 or the proposal will expire.
   Bouchard, the former environment minister, opposes any change to
the 1987 accord. Recommendations for change are now before the
government.
   Bouchard campaigned for an independent Quebec in 1980 before
joining Mulroney and the Tories. The 1982 constitution instituted
in Canada did not recognize the largely French-speaking province of
Quebec as a ``distinct society.'' The Meech Lake proposal remedies
that omission.
   About 6.7 million of Canada's 25 million people live in Quebec.
   The constitutional dispute over the accord has revived
independence talk in Quebec.
   Bouchard, who was Mulroney's chief lieutenant in Quebec, told a
news conference Tuesday he thinks Quebecers must act because the
country isn't functioning well.
   ``I believe that the solution is sovereignty-association,'' he
said. ``It's a term that's never been properly defined. English
Canadians refer to separatists, this is a cold term. We have to
remake the country.''
   In the Commons, Mulroney fervently defended Meech, saying it was
simply designed to welcome Quebec back into the Canadian family.
   Mulroney told Commons last-minute efforts to rescue the Meech
Lake accord are not going well.
   ``I am advised that the progress has not been substantial,'' he
said.
   In his speech to Commons later, Bouchard advised Quebec Premier
Robert Bourassa not to attend any conference of Mulroney and the 10
provincial premiers to hear a committee report on changes.
   He said if Bourassa boycotts such a conference, ``he will have
not just my support but that of all Quebecers.''
   Bouchard told reporters if his resignation means stopping a
compromise that dilutes Meech Lake, ``I will have done something
very important.
   ``If my resignation helps some individuals to be realistic in
what they are doing and to realize once again that it's Meech all
or nothing, my resignation will have powerfully served the will of
the people.''
   Sen. Lowell Murray, Mulroney's personal Meech Lake emissary,
said Bouchard's departure may have scuttled the idea of an
11th-hour meeting of Mulroney and the 10 premiers to save
Mulroney's cherished constitutional agreement.
   ``Lucien Bouchard's letter of resignation raises the question of
whether it's worthwhile to do this,'' Murray said.
   In his letter of resignation, Bouchard scoffed at ``those who
would attempt, hopefully in vain, to convince Quebec to come to a
conference that is booby-trapped in order to wrest from it ultimate
concessions that could only be humiliating.''
   The cracks in Meech and in Mulroney's party spread Tuesday.
   Gilbert Chartrand, Tory member of parliament for Verdun-Saint
Paul, announced he was quitting the party, too, saying he was
unable to toe the party line and would be ashamed if he didn't
speak up against proposed changes to Meech.
   The Charest report, prepared by a special committee led by
Quebec Tory Jean Charest, produced 23 recommendations last week in
hopes of producing a Meech-saving compromise in the face of
opposition by some provinces. It would have the federal prime
minister and the provincial premiers state firmly that recognition
of Quebec as a distinct society does not supersede the Charter of
Rights. It says the federal government should be allowed to promote
as well as protect linguistic duality.
   Bouchard vehemently opposes the report.

   Four teen-agers were indicted Tuesday on
charges of sexually assaulting a mentally retarded girl more than a
year ago.
   Charged were twins Kevin and Kyle Scherzer, 19, Peter Quigley
and Richard Corcoran Jr. with aggravated sexual assault.
   Prosecutors allege that the Scherzers, co-captains of the high
school football team, Quigley and Corcoran assaulted the girl with
a broomstick and a miniature baseball bat, while nine others
participated or watched.
   Defense lawyers don't contest what occurred, but say the girl
consented. Lawyers for Quigley and Corcoran deny that their clients
were actual participants.
   Essex County Prosecutor Herbert H. Tate Jr. has said the girl,
now 19, is mentally retarded, with an IQ is between 49 and 67.
   The four were arrested last May, more than two months after the
March 1, 1989, incident, which took place in the Scherzers'
basement in Glen Ridge, an affluent suburb 15 miles west of New
York City.
   They have been free on bail pending a grand jury investigation.
   The indictment also charges another teen-ager, John Maher, with
conspiracy for allegedly asking the victim, identified as M.G., to
return to the basement the next day.
   It charges Mari Carmen Ferraez, 19, with witness tampering for
allegedly contacting the victim in an attempt to have her change
her story.
   And it names, as unindicted co-conspirators, three juveniles
under arrest in the case and a fourth who has not been charged,
Tate said.
   Prosecutors have asked that the three juveniles charged be tried
as adults; no ruling has yet been made on that request.
   Tate said the grand jury investigation took so long because of
the large number of people involved and discovery of the taped
conversation between Ms. Ferraez and M.G. Also slowing the
indictment was a recent state appeals court ruling that the victim
in a separate case is mentally defective only if she is unable to
understand that others may not have sex with her without her
consent.
   Tate said the investigation was continuing, but declined to
elaborate.
   Defense lawyers say the girl was intelligent enough to have said
no.
   But the grand jury found that, ``M.G. was one whom Kevin
Scherzer and Kyle Scherzer and Peter Quigley and Richard Corcoran
Jr. knew or should have known was physically helpless, mentally
defective or mentally incapacitated.''
   Those four are each charged with four counts of first-degree
aggravated sexual assault, four counts of third-degree aggravated
sexual contact and second-degree conspiracy to commit aggravated
sexual assault and aggravated sexual contact.
   Maher is charged with one count of conspiracy, Ms. Ferraez with
two counts of third-degree witness tampering and fourth-degree
obstructing administration of law or other government function.
   If convicted, the Scherzers, Quigley and Corcoran face a maximum
of about 20 years in prison, officials said. Maher faces 10 years,
Ms. Ferraez five.

   Actor Marlon Brando sat stone-faced Tuesday
as a judge refused to set bail for his son, who is charged with
killing his sister's boyfriend, but later spoke emotionally of the
suffering of both families.
   The white-haired Brando sat in the front row of the packed
courtroom and stared straight ahead as his son, Christian, was
brought in. The two did not acknowledge each other as cameras
clicked and flashes went off.
   William Kunstler, the civil rights attorney summoned by the
elder Brando to defend his son, said the shooting of Dag Drollet,
26, at the Brando estate last Wednesday was an accident and that
Christian Brando was drunk at the time.
   Kunstler presented affidavits from friends and neighbors,
including actor Jack Nicholson, who attested to the younger
Brando's good character.
   ``His father is not going to help him (flee) in any way. He
wants this process to go on,'' Kunstler said in requesting bail.
   But Municipal Court Judge Rosemary Shumsky denied bail.
   Christian Brando, 32, a welder and tree-trimmer, was arrested
after police received an emergency call from his father and rushed
to the hilltop estate to find the body of houseguest Drollet, 26,
who had been shot. Drollet was the boyfriend of Cheyenne Brando, 20.
   Marlon Brando, who did not speak during Tuesday's hearing, later
declared his son's innocence to reporters.
   ``We see on the television and read in newspapers things that
are unpronounceably sad,'' said the reclusive actor. ``The
messenger of misery has come to my house. He has also come to the
house of Mr. Jack Drollet (the victim's father) in Tahiti and we
must stand up to it.''
   ``To those people who have known this kind of tragic
circumstances in the world ... no explanation is necessary, and to
those people who do not know the nature of this acute misery that
both our families suffer, no explanation is possible.''
   He added, ``My son has been denied bail. He has had his day in
court and we will abide by that. The decision will be appealed.''
   He also thanked the news media for what he called its mostly
``responsible and reasonable'' presentation of the case.
   As he left, he was asked to describe his feelings.
   ``There's no way to describe it to you unless you've gone
through it in your life. We must just be strong, and the family,
with love and supporting each other, will prevail.''
   Christian Brando initially told police he shot Drollet during an
argument involving alleged abuse of his pregnant sister.
   Kunstler the next day issued statements saying the killing was
an accident in which a gun went off during a struggle.
   But in court Tuesday, Deputy District Attorney Steven Barshop
said pictures of the body and other evidence indicate otherwise.
   ``There was a contact wound and decedent was shot while
seated,'' Barshop said. ``The shot is at a 45-degree angle.
Decedent is holding a TV changer and a Bic lighter, negating any
struggle.''
   Kunstler disputed Barshop's account of the evidence.
   Another Brando lawyer, Ronald Kuby, told the judge the younger
Brando had an alcohol problem in the past, had been through a
detoxification program and was willing to go through another if
released.
   Kunstler said Christian Brando's blood-alcohol reading two hours
after the shooting was 0.19 percent, which he called ``one of the
highest blood-alcohol contents I've seen in a case of this kind.''
That is nearly double the state's threshhold for drunken driving.
   ``Christian Brando is not a famous person, not a public
person,'' Kuby told the judge. ``He happens to have a famous
father. I beg you to treat him as you would any other person
without the Brando name.''
   The judge set the next hearing in the case for June 11.

   Thousands of Palestinians protesting the murder
of seven Arabs in Israel demonstrated Tuesday in the occupied lands
and in neighboring Jordan. Four people were reported killed and at
least 47 injured.
   Escalating protests included a rally by hundreds of people
outside the U.S. Consulate in Arab east Jerusalem. Striking
Palestinians shut down schools and shops in the occupied Gaza Strip
and the West Bank.
   Hundreds of members of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah organization
burned effigies of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and of
U.S., Jordanian and Saudi leaders during a march in Beirut, Lebanon.
   Israeli troops killed two Palestinians and wounded 22 Tuesday,
raising the toll since Sunday to 13 Palestinians slain and more
than 800 injured. That does not include seven Palestinians killed
Sunday by an Israeli civilian _ an incident that touched off
widespread riots. Israel said he was deranged.
   President Bush extended personal condolences Tuesday to the
families of the seven slain Palestinians and those killed later by
security forces and asked the Israeli army ``to act with maximum
restraint.''
   Bush said the political problems at the heart of the
Arab-Israeli conflict must be urgently addressed and a peace
process opened that involves all parties.
   In Jordan, at least two people were killed and 25 wounded as
police fired to disperse demonstrations in two cities and Baqaa
refugee camp near Amman, the capital, Jordan's official Petra news
agency said. Prime Minister Mudar Badran pledged to take ``all
necessary measures to guarantee safety and order.''
   Nearly half of Jordan's 3.1 million people are Palestinians who
fled Israel in the 1948 or 1967 Middle East wars.
   Shamir defended his government against criticism by Arabs and
the U.S. State Department over Sunday's slayings and the heavy
casualties caused by army gunfire.
   ``Anyone wishing to see in this mad murder an expression of
Israeli government policy and intentions is maliciously and
viciously distorting the picture,'' Shamir told legislators from
his right-wing Likud bloc.
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher complained about the
number of casualties caused by the Israeli army, and Department
spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler told reporters it is the United
States' ``deeply held belief that absence of a peace process
contributes to violence in the Middle East.''
   Motti Amichai, a spokesman for Israel's Foreign Ministry,
replied, ``The main obstacle to peace in the Middle East is the
refusal of Arab states to start direct dialogue with Israel.''
   ``We are suprised vis-a-vis the attempt to link the actions of
one lunatic to the peace process and the policy of the government
of Israel,'' he said.
   The protests in Israel started soon after an Israeli man lined
up 50 Palestinian day laborers in a Tel Aviv suburb Sunday and
opened fire with an assault rifle. Seven people were killed and 11
injured.
   Authorities say the suspect, 21-year-old Ami Popper, was
deranged and also upset by an unhappy love affair. But Arabs have
said anti-Israeli policies by Shamir's government encourage such
attacks.
   Israeli officials in turn have accused the Arabs of trying to
use the slayings to revive the flagging, 29-month Palestinian
uprising against Israel's occupation of the West Bank and Gaza
Strip.
   About 7,000 Palestinians clashed with police Tuesday in Jordan's
Baqaa camp, and security officials said 15,000 protested in Irbid,
45 miles north of Amman.
   Residents reached by telephone in Irbid said a 14-year-old boy
was killed by police. It was not immediately clear whether the
victim was Palestinian. An official at Jordan University Hospital
near Amman said a 19-year-old man died of gunshot wounds suffered
at Baqaa.
   Police sealed off all roads leading to Zarqa, 18 miles north of
Amman, where at least 10,000 Palestinians staged protests.
   In Israel and the occupied territories, violence persisted for a
third day. The army imposed curfews keeping 1.5 million
Palestinians in their homes.
   Troops firing on Palestinians in Gaza City fatally shot
18-year-old Ahmed Musabeh in the chest, hospital officials said.
The army confirmed the death and said it was investigating the
circumstances.
   Seventeen Palestinians were shot and wounded in clashes with
soldiers in Gaza and five others were injured by army gunfire in
the West Bank, Arab hospital officials said.
   Among the wounded in Gaza was Musabeh's 23-year-old sister,
Samira, who was five months pregnant, the officials said. They said
she was shot in the stomach with a plastic bullet but that the
fetus was unharmed.
   An army statement said a Palestinian also was killed by soldiers
after he set off a roadside explosive device in Bani Suhelia in the
Gaza Strip. Palestinians identified the victim as Ata Ali Abu
Shaed, 20.
   Tuesday's deaths brought to 708 the number of Palestinians
killed by Israelis in the Palestinian uprising. At least 216 other
Palestinians have been slain by fellow Arabs, most on suspicion of
collaboration with Israel. Forty-three Israelis have been slain in
the revolt.

<HEAD>Five Held in Threats Against Rushdie</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Police are questioning five men under the
Prevention of Terrorism Act over threats to kill author Salman
Rushdie, the Daily Mail newspaper reported in Wednesday's editions.
   Scotland Yard refused to confirm if the men were being held in
connection with threats made against Rushdie, saying only that, ``A
number of persons have been arrested today under the Prevention of
Terrorism Act and are being interviewed at a central London police
station.''
   The Daily Mail newspaper reported the five were arrested by
police in raids at four locations in London and one in Scarborough,
155 miles northeast of London.
   Rushdie has been in hiding since Feb. 14, 1989, when the late
Iranian leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, condemned him to death
for allegedly blaspheming Islam in his novel, ``The Satanic
Verses.'' Iran reaffirmed the death threat earlier this year.
   The Daily Mail reported Scotland Yard has intensified its
operations after warnings that Iranian hit squads were sent to
Britain. A Scotland Yard spokeswoman, who was not identified in
keeping with British custom, refused comment.
   In another development, a publisher scrapped plans for bringing
out a limited collectors' edition of two of Rushdie's short
stories, saying he feared it could endanger the author's life, the
Independent newspaper reported on Wednesday.
   Two previously published short stories by the Indian-born author
were to be reissued in an illustrated, limited edition that would
sell for $250 a copy, the Independent quoted the publisher as
saying.
   The publisher decided a dozen copies of the stories ``The
Prophet's Hair'' and ``The Free Radio'' would be bound and
privately distributed to friends of the author, the illustrator,
and the publisher, the newspaper reported.
   The publisher said Rushdie agreed to withdraw the book from
wider sale and circulation, the newspaper reported.

   Suspected Communist rebels firing
from a van killed a Filipino colonel and four others Wednesday in
an ambush along a thoroughfare jammed with rush-hour commuters,
police said.
   Nine others were injured, most of them passengers in a bus that
was riddled with stray bullets. Col. Reynaldo Dino, deputy
personnel officer of the Philippine Constabulary and former chief
of staff of the police Capital Command died of head and body wounds
a short while later in a hospital.
   Dino's 23-year-old daughter, Lolita Halili, and three of his
bodyguards were also killed, police said.
   Police said six assailants led by a woman sprayed gunfire at
Dino's car as it traveled along the thoroughfare, sending the
vehicle swerving into a bus.
   Three of the assailants, including the woman, then jumped from
their van and began firing at point-blank range, police said.
Witnesses said the woman spat toward bystanders after she finished
firing.
   The assailants escaped but their van was recovered, police Lt.
Rogelio Bilang said.
   Police Col. Victor Tiangco, operations chief of the Capital
Command, blamed the killing on the Marxist New People's Army.
Tiangco said Dino had been receiving death threats from the
insurgents and one suspected guerrilla was arrested last month near
Dino's home.
   Tiangco said the Alex Boncayao Brigade, the Manila wing of the
New People's Army, was responsible for killing about 60 police,
soldiers and civilians in Manila this year.
   Wedsnesday is the sixth anniversary of the Alex Boncayao Brigade.
   The attack was the latest sign of the deteriorating security
situation in this turbulent capital.
   On Tuesday, police defused powerful bombs outside the
headquarters of two banks in the financial district and officials
said the explosives, timed to explode during morning rush hour,
could have destroyed both buildings.
   Brig. Gen. Marino Filart, chief of the police Capital Command,
said the bombs could be part of an urban terror campaign to pave
the way for a new coup attempt against President Corazon Aquino.

<HEAD>Boxer Rocky Graziano Dies, Briefly Held Middleweight Title</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: DELETES grafs 2-3, redundant material.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rocky Graziano, who briefly held the
middleweight boxing crown but was better known as the subject of a
movie and a pitchman for products from yogurt to auto mufflers,
died Tuesday. He was 71.
   Graziano died of cardio-pulmonary failure at New York Hospital,
said hospital spokeswoman Diana Goldin. He was hospitalized April 8
after suffering a stroke.
   In his 11-year pro career, Graziano managed a 67-16 record with
52 knockouts. He is best remembered for three fights with Tony Zale
and it was the middle one of those which gave Graziano his only
title.
   In retirement, Graziano became as popular as he had been as a
fighter.
   His life story, ``Somebody Up There Likes Me,'' was a
best-selling book that was made into the 1956 movie of the same
name, starring Paul Newman.
   Graziano was frequently seen on television as a sidekick to
comedienne Martha Raye and on commercials for all manner of
products from yogurt and foot powder to dog food and auto mufflers.
   He was elected to the Boxing Hall of Fame in 1971.
   Graziano turned pro in 1942 and by 1946, he was a contender. On
Sept. 16 in Yankee Stadium, he fought Zale for the middleweight
title and they staged a small war with Graziano going down in the
first round and then being knocked out in the sixth. He recalled
the knockout punch.
   ``It was a big left hook and I see it coming, but I can't stop
it. It was like the ground exploded up and hit me in the stomach.
The lights spin in a circle then dim down to a tiny little spot,''
he said. ``I try to yell but I can't make a sound. I am deaf and I
can't talk and I can't lift my arms and I am falling. For the first
time in my life, I know what it's like to be KO'd.''
   The fight was such a crowd-pleaser that 10 months later, on July
16, 1947, Graziano and Zale had a rematch, this time in Chicago.
Graziano returned the favor, knocking Zale out in the sixth round
to capture the championship.
   Graziano held the title for 11 months but in his first defense,
Zale took the crown back on June 10, 1948 with a third-round
knockout in another bloody battle.
   Graziano got one more chance at the championship, but was
knocked out in the third round by Sugar Ray Robinson on April 16,
1952. He would fight just once more, losing a 10-round decision to
Chuck Davey before announcing his retirement.
   Twenty-five years after his last fight, Graziano chortled about
his post-boxing popularity.
   ``This author stuff, TV and the movies _ it's a piece of cake,
better than ripping off stores. Pays better, too.''
   Graziano often made himself and his delinquent childhood the
butt of jokes. ``I quit school in the sixth grade because of
pneumonia,'' he once said. ``Not because I had it _ but because I
couldn't spell it. We stole everything that began with an `a' _ a
piece of fruit, a bicycle, a watch, anything that was not nailed
down.
   ``It took me nine years to get through the fourth grade. When I
got into television commercials, I had to take a crash course in
reading. I was 32 years old and I couldn't read the cue cards.''
   Graziano was treated last year for physical and mental
exhaustion, and had a heart attack last February, Ms. Goldin said.
   Funeral arrangements were pending.
   Graziano was born Thomas Rocco Barbella on New York's lower East
Side. The son of a former boxer who used the name ``Fighting Nick
Bob,'' Graziano grew up as a street brawler who learned to steal
before he learned to read. He ran with a tough crowd and recalling
those days later in life, he called himself ``the world's champion
punk.''
   At age 12, he was arrested for the first time, caught breaking
into a subway gum machine. While on probation, he stole a bicycle
and was sent for the first of three trips to reform school. In 1939
a friend, Jack Healy, took him to New York's famous Stillman's Gym
to see if he could put his street fighting instincts to use in the
ring. When a seasoned pro named Antonio Fernandez beat up the
callow 17-year-old, the kid swore he'd never box again. Two months
later, however, he was back in the ring, this time fighting under
the name of his sister's boyfriend, Rocky Graziano. He won the the
Metropolitan AAU welterweight championship.
   ``The AAU gave me a medal which I hocked for $15,'' Graziano
recalled years later. ``Maybe this is not so bad a racket after
all, I think. I will give this a shake.''

<HEAD>Dinkins Calls Again for Racial Unity</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mayor David Dinkins on Tuesday urged New Yorkers
to put aside racial antagonism and rededicate themselves to the
``values of justice, opportunity and caring.''
   The public condemnation of racism, the second in 12 days by the
city's first black mayor, follows a series of events that have
heightened racial tensions in the city.
   ``We will never get ahead if we are fighting each other for
crumbs falling from the table of opportunity,'' Dinkins told a
rally of 6,000.
   ``The powerless are trying to prove their power by hurting those
who are just as powerless. It must stop and it must stop now.''
   The most recent irritant to race relations was a pair of
verdicts in the so-called Bensonhurst case, the killing of a black
teen-ager by a mob of white youths.
   One white teen-ager was convicted of killing a black youth
during a gang attack in a predominantly white section of Brooklyn
in August. A co-defendant was acquitted of murder in the case but
convicted of lesser charges.
   A black boycott of a Korean-American owned grocery store in
Brooklyn and a speech by a City University professor who espouses
white supremacy also have brought recent front-page headlines.
   Dinkins, in announcing the city-sponsored Unity Rally on Monday,
said ``a silent majority'' needed to be heard above the voices of
some activists who have been fueling instead of soothing tensions.
   ``Wherever you come from or what's been done to you, you have no
right to lash out against others,'' Dinkins told the rally Tuesday
night at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine.
   ``I'm tired of hatred. I've seen too much of it. Too much pain
and too much suffering and I'm sick of it. So let me be blunt _ I
need your help.''
   Gov. Mario Cuomo urged New Yorkers to turn crisis into
opportunity.
   ``We need to refocus our hostility away from one another and
onto the government's policies that neglect people in need,'' Cuomo
said.
   ``Mr. President, read our lips: We need your help and we are
entitled to it.''
   Cardinal John O'Connor, head of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese
of New York, told the rally, ``I will unite every single day with
the religious, political leaders of this city. I will spend every
waking moment and as much as possible of every night to try to help
achieve unity.''
   The speeches, regularly interrupted by standing ovations and
cheers, were broadcast live on local television.
   Inside the cathedral 2,800 people were seated and at least 2,000
more stood, while another 1,000 listened to the speeches outside
via loudspeakers, said Paul Gorman, a cathedral spokesman.
   The mood inside was jubilant among a crowd that was about
one-third black, one-third white and one-third Hispanic and Asian
and crossed all lines of age and occupation.
   About a dozen black demonstrators picketed outside, refusing to
talk to reporters and holding signs that read: ``Let's take our
peace, justice and unity rally to Bensonhurst.'' That is the mostly
white neighborhood where the August gang attack occurred and where
blacks marching last weekend were pelted with obscenities and
pieces of watermelon.
   Keith Mondello, 19, was acquitted of murder and manslaughter
Friday but convicted of lesser charges in the Aug. 23 attack on
16-year-old Yusuf Hawkins. On Thursday, Joseph Fama, also white and
also 19, was convicted of murder in the Hawkins slaying.

   UNITED NATIONS _ The U.N. Security Council will meet Friday in
Geneva to hear PLO chairman Yasser Arafat because the U.S.
government has not granted him a visa to speak in New York, the
Arab League announced late Tuesday.
   ``Yes, we definitely will go to Geneva,'' said Clovis Maksoud,
permanent observer of the 22-nation League of Arab States. He made
the statement to reporters as the Security Council held informal
consultations on an emergency meeting to discuss violence in Israel
and the occupied territories.
   The council was expected to make a formal statement later.
   The U.S. government had not accepted or rejected the request for
a visa for the Palestine Liberation Organization leader.
   But Arab diplomats indicated the United States did not oppose a
move to Geneva.
   The PLO requested an immediate U.S. visa for Arafat, who is
considered the head of the Palestine state, to address the Security
Council in New York.
   Arab envoys said they decided on the Geneva move in order to
consider the pressing issue of how the council can help safeguard
the rights of Palestinians.
   ``We do not seek confrontation, we are seeking protective
measures for the Palestinian people,'' Maksoud told reporters. ``We
did not back down. No deal has been done with the United States (on
not forcing the visa issue).''
   Arafat last visited the United States in 1974 when he addressed
the General Assembly on Palestine.
   Two years ago the United States refused to grant him a visa to
address the assembly about the Palestine problem, on grounds his
was a terrorist organization. The assembly in defiance shifted the
159-nation assembly to Geneva to hear him.
   There, in December 1988, Arafat delivered a speech that opened a
new chapter in Middle East diplomacy. He renounced terrorism and
implicitly recognized Israel's right to exist within secure borders.
   As a result of his statement, the United States opened a
dialogue with the PLO in Tunis.
   The Security Council has met outside New York only twice: in
January 1972 in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, to discuss African matters,
and March 1973 in Panama City to discuss the Panama Canal.

for Panama and Nicaragua. The aid sought by the Bush administration
would be provided through another bill.
   A ``yes'' vote is a vote in favor of the bill.
   Voting yes were 155 Democrats and 16 Republicans.
   Voting no were 94 Democrats and 150 Republicans.
   X denotes those not voting.
   Present denotes those who voted they were ``present'' at the
time of the vote but did not vote ``yes'' or ``no'' on the issue.
   There are two vacancies in the 435-member House.

<HEAD>Record Company Mogul Morris Levy Faced Prison for Conspiracy
Conviction</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GHENT, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When record company mogul Morris Levy died,
he left a legacy of shady dealing in a career that spanned more
than 40 years.
   Levy, who died Monday of cancer at age 62, was facing a $250,000
fine and 10 years in prison for a May 1988 conviction on two
federal counts of conspiring to extort $1.25 million from a
Pennsylvania record wholesaler.
   Free on bail, Levy tried to have his sentence reduced to zero in
January because of his failing health. Although that was denied, he
eventually was granted a 90-day stay and would have reported to
jail on July 16.
   Levy owned several nightclubs in the 1940s and 50s, including
the world famous jazz mecca Birdland in New York. He became active
as a music publisher and record company owner in the 1950s.
   His company, Roulette Records, produced such hits in the 1950s
as ``Why Do Fools Fall in Love'' and ``Peppermint Twist'' and
helped develop such stars as Tommy James.
   In the 1970s, Levy entered the record retail business and opened
a chain of Strawberries record shops in the Northeast. Eventually,
he became linked to organized crime.
   In a case authorities called an example of how the mob was
trying to infiltrate the recording industry, Levy, Roulette
comptroller Howard Fisher, and reputed Genovese crime family member
Dominick Canterino were charged with the attempted shakedown of
record wholesaler John LaMonte of Darby, Pa.
   Levy denied the allegations, but after a three-week trial in
federal court in Camden, N.J., a jury convicted Levy, Fisher and
Canterino.
   Levy appealed but a federal appeals court upheld the conviction
in October.
   Prosecutors had presented hours of taped conversations obtained
by government wiretaps at Levy's office and other locations.
   FBI documents filed in the case said government agencies
believed Levy, a self-made millionaire, had been involved with
organized crime for 20 years.
   Levy had been the principal shareholder of BeckZack Corp., which
owned the 81-store Strawberries chain. He sold the chain last year.

   Yasser Arafat, chairman of the Palestine
Liberation Organization, wanted the Bush administration to allow
him to attend a U.N. Security Council session in New York City,
U.S. officials said Tuesday.
   But the question apparently became moot during the evening. The
Arab League said in New York the Security Council would meet in
Geneva to hear Arafat, as it did once before, and an announcement
was expected from U.N. officials.
   Arafat made an indirect request for an entry visa in a letter to
U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar with the expectation
it would be passed on to the State Department.
   The United States denied Arafat a visa two years ago for a
similar Mideast debate at the United Nations.
   U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said no
decision had been made because the situation was ``hypothetical.''
It would remain hypothetical if the department passed word back to
the PLO that the visa request would be denied.
   ``We're hearing reports a formal application will be made, but
as of this briefing we have not received anything,'' Margaret D.
Tutwiler, the State Department spokeswoman, told reporters at
mid-day.
   If Arafat had gone to the United Nations, the PLO's stature
would have been elevated dramatically. That would come at a time
when Israel is being pressured, even by friends such as the United
States, because of the force it has used to try to stem a violent
uprising by Palestinian Arabs on the West Bank and in Gaza.
   When the Reagan administration refused to allow Arafat to attend
a U.N. General Assembly session in November 1988, the debate was
shifted to Geneva. A month later, in an electrifying reversal of
policy, the administration opened talks with the PLO.
   Arafat, following U.S. instructions, had publicly renounced
terrorism and said he recognized Israel's right to exist. However,
the PLO covenant still calls for dismantling the Jewish state.
   The State Department told Congress in March that the PLO was
adhering to its commitment renouncing terrorism.
   In denying the PLO's application for a visa in 1988 despite
overwhelming pressure from many other U.N. members, then-Secretary
of State George P. Shultz said ``the U.S. government has convincing
evidence that PLO elements have engaged in terrorism against
Americans and other targets.''
   Shultz also said that Arafat ``knows of, condones and lends
support to such acts'' and is ``an accessory to such terrorism.''
   A month later, Shultz took the lead in opening U.S. talks with
the PLO. Those talks are continuing in Tunis, the PLO headquarters.
Through Egypt, the PLO has registered its terms for talks between
Palestinians and Israel in Cairo.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III has been unable to
persuade Israel to adopt the terms _ participation by exiled
Palestinians and by residents of East Jerusalem.
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir is trying to shut the PLO
out of the elections he has proposed for the West Bank and Gaza.
   Arafat, speaking Monday in Baghdad, Iraq, appealed to President
Bush to pressure Israel to stop what the PLO chairman described as
atrocities against Palestinians.
   Arafat rejected Israeli claims that the lone Israeli gunman who
shot and killed seven Palestinian workers near Tel Aviv on Sunday
was mentally unbalanced. He accused Shamir of planning ``a criminal
scheme against the Palestinians and the intefadeh.''
   Intefadeh is the Arab name for the revolt against Israel's
control of the West Bank and Gaza, which were surrendered by Jordan
and Egypt in their 1967 war against Israel.

   U.S. taxpayers will foot Manuel Noriega's legal
bills until $20 million of his frozen assets are confiscated or
released, under a deal that averts disclosure of secret U.S.
payments to the fallen dictator.
   Before the deal was reached Monday, Noriega's lawyers had
threatened to quit the drug trafficking case because they hadn't
been paid. Prosecutors froze the former Panamanian leader's assets,
contending they were illegally obtained.
   In agreeing to cover Noriega's legal fees, the government headed
off a confrontation over $11 million in U.S. intelligence agency
payments he claims to have received over several decades.
   Noriega's lawyers had been trying to force the government to
produce secret records of those payments to show Noriega had
legitimate sources of income other than drugs. But on Monday, the
defense agreed to drop the subpoenas when the deal involving
Noriega's legal fees is formally approved.

   In a move that could delay plans to
merge the two German economies, the opposition Social Democrats
have demanded alterations in the newly signed economic treaty with
East Germany.
   Hans-Jochen Vogel, the Social Democrats' national chairman, told
reporters Monday his party wants to negotiate with Chancellor
Helmut Kohl's government over improving the treaty's terms for East
Germans.
   The Social Democrats' position could spell trouble for the
economic merger treaty, which was signed Friday at a ceremony in
Bonn. According to the treaty the two Germanys are to be one
economic entity by July 2.
   The treaty must still be approved by the parliaments of both
countries. The Social Democrats recently won control of the upper
house in West Germany's parliament by defeating Kohl's Christian
Democrats in two key state elections.

   Tailor-made antibodies can dramatically
reverse spreading melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer, when
injected directly into the tumors, researchers say.
   The work, though still in its preliminary stages, suggests that
it may be possible to stop the disease by harnessing the body's own
built-in defenses.
   Antibodies are among the body's principal weapons for fighting
off a variety of foreign invaders, including cancer. In this case,
scientists crafted human antibodies in the test tube that were
specifically targeted against the cancer. Then they injected them
into cancerous growths on victims' skin.
   ``The lesions dry up and regress,'' said Dr. Donald Morton,
director of the John Wayne Surgical Oncology Clinic at the
University of California, Los Angeles.

   Auto industry lobbyists are working to head
off attempts to toughen smog controls in the House clean air bill,
including a requirement to build 1 million non-gasoline powered
cars a year.
   The proposal, being pushed by Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., is
expected to provide the most fireworks when the air pollution
control bill comes up for floor votes on Thursday.
   The sweeping legislation is the first strengthening of federal
clean air laws in 13 years and imposes new curbs on acid rain
pollution, industrial toxic releases and smog-causing emissions
from industry and automobiles. It is expected to cost more than $21
billion a year when fully implemented.
   The Senate approved a similar measure in April.

   Disheartened by U.S. reluctance to allow the
export of supercomputers to Israel, scientists in that country are
researching a new system more powerful than anything the United
States has, Israeli university officials say.
   Three Israeli institutions have applied for licenses to buy Cray
and IBM supercomputers, but the permits have been delayed out of
U.S. concern that Israel might use the fast-computing systems to
develop nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles.
   U.S. government agencies have been considering the applications
for almost two years but thus far have refused to grant the permits.
   ``The writing's on the wall,'' said Maia Hauser, the U.S.
spokeswoman for Technion, Israel's leading high-tech university.
``We'll have to go it on our own.'' The university is asking
supporters in the United States to raise funds for an alternative
to the U.S. computers.

<HEAD>`Twin Peaks' Star Doesn't Even Know Who Killed Laura</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH HASTINGS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Peggy Lipton co-stars on ``Twin Peaks,'' yet
even she doesn't know who killed Laura Palmer. ``I don't know if
anyone on the cast knows,'' she says.
   Hard to believe, given that someone on the show must have done
it. Unless it was the bird. And the bird was killed off in last
week's episode. Or maybe it was the dancing dwarf who spoke in
reverse.
   Who knows. But ABC promises that if you watch tonight's season
finale, you'll know. And the murder of 17-year-old Laura, the
driving force behind the new show with more twists than a road
through the Cascades, will finally be resolved.
   ``I don't think there is a plot line,'' says Miss Lipton, asked
to explain the disjointed maneuvers of ``Twin Peaks,'' one of the
most publicized programs in television history. ``It's like life.
Sometimes it doesn't make sense.''
   Miss Lipton plays world-weary Norma Jennings, owner of the
town's Double R diner, who is torn between two men, one of them
named ``Big Ed.''
   It's a long way from the smoky-voiced, bell-bottomed Julie
Barnes of TV's ``The Mod Squad.''
   You remember that show. Miss Lipton, Michael Cole and Clarence
Williams III running down an alley in the program's title sequence.
From 1968 to 1973, they played hip, anti-establishment cops while
Williams spent much time uttering the word ``solid'' whenever
confronted with something totally cool.
   Miss Lipton's role consisted mostly of looking sullen behind
stringy blond hair and misting up every now and then. She faded
from view with the show's demise, appearing on television only in
``Mod Squad'' reruns and a dismal 1979 television movie dubbed
``Return of the Mod Squad.''
   After more than a decade of self-imposed exile, Miss Lipton has
returned. Her children more than half grown, her marriage to
legendary record producer Quincy Jones long over, the actress who
was 18 years old when she filmed the Mod Squad pilot is grown up,
secure and finally ready to stand on her own.
   ``When I was doing `Mod Squad,' I was really very insecure,''
says Miss Lipton, sitting in a Hollywood office where she has just
finished a photo shoot that had her lounging seductively on a
Porsche. ``I really didn't like myself very much.''
   For more than 10 years after ``Mod Squad'' left the airwaves,
Miss Lipton devoted herself to her husband and her two daughters.
``My mother was a career woman who wasn't home enough,'' she says.
``I never wanted my children to have that yearning.''
   With the exception of ``Return of the Mod Squad,'' Miss Lipton
did not pursue acting again until 1985. She made a couple of
forgettable movies, divorced Jones and did a lot of auditions.
   ``People were usually very curious,'' she said of reactions to
her re-emergence in Hollywood as something other than Jones' wife.
   But it was not until the actress met David Lynch, the quirky and
decidedly different director who made ``Blue Velvet,''
``Eraserhead,'' and ``Elephant Man,'' that she felt something click.
   Lynch and former ``Hill Street Blues'' writer Mark Frost were
about to film the pilot for ``Twin Peaks,'' and somehow Miss Lipton
was called to audition.
   ``I don't even know if David knew who I was,'' she says. ``Mark
Frost brought up my name. Someone told me later that I read for the
part, but I was so nervous I didn't remember.''
   She got the part, as did other actors who had vanished from the
public viewing eye for awhile. Michael Ontkean from ``The Rookies''
television show of the 1970s was cast as doughnut-loving sheriff
Harry S. Truman. Richard Beymer of ``West Side Story'' became
hotelier Benjamin Horne.
   And on the set of ``Twin Peaks,'' the cast that also includes
Piper Laurie, Joan Chen from the Oscar-winning ``The Last Emperor''
and Kyle MacLachlan of ``Blue Velvet'' found themselves in a
surreal environment.
   ``While we were shooting, it was like a film within a film,''
says Miss Lipton, who is now 42. ``I'd never seen a crew like that
_ so quiet, so tuned in to David that they watched his every move.
   ``There was not a lot of set talk. All these people were quite
mysterious.''
   Not to mention the characters they portray, from a log-toting
woman called simply ``The Log Lady,'' to pie-fixated FBI man Dale
Cooper, to the one-armed man, that dancing midget and Laura's mom,
who has psychic visions.
   Take a Dramamine, watch the final episode tonight and get ready
for more. ABC announced this week that ``Twin Peaks,'' despite its
mediocre ratings, has been picked up for the fall season.

his play's name. ``It's like asking the author of `April in Paris'

<BYLINE>What Happened With Tax Reform?
^By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In the 1980s the American people learned the
wonderful uses of debt _ government, business and personal, the
underlying urge in all three being the ability to buy things now,
not later.
   They also learned the penalties, especially as high interest
rates denied them the opportunity not just to buy for the future
but to finance the present and the past as well.
   The Gramm-Rudman Act forced government to at least attempt
scaling back, and the phasing out of tax deductions on installment
debt has made individuals more conscious of saving rather than
spending.
   But business debt is another matter. It is still encouraged, at
least by the tax system.
   At a time when concerns about corporate debt make news every
day, U.S. tax policy continues to encourage borrowing over the
old-fashioned way, which is to finance through equities, or the
sale of ownership shares to the public.
   Consider the ways:
   _For corporations, interest payments on borrowed money is a
tax-deductible expense, but payment of dividends to shareholders is
not.
   _Owners of common stock are taxed twice, first when corporations
pay taxes on profits and again when shareholders pay taxes on
dividends and capital gains. But interest on bonds is taxed only
once, as income to the bondholder.
   _The 1986 tax act raised the maximum capital gains tax rate to
33 percent from 20 percent, while lowering the maximum rate on
ordinary income, including income from interest, to 33 percent from
50 percent.
   The situation causes Wright Investors' Service, among others, to
warn that changes should be considered in corporate taxation, if
not specifically for the good of corporations then for the good of
the entire economy.
   It argues that while the high corporate debt doesn't assure a
recession, ``it certainly increases the risk and potential severity
of the consequences, in terms of bankruptcies and job losses.''
   In addition, the first defense against inflation is greater
productivity, which means capital investment in new techniques, new
plants, new equipment. But capital investment is hardly encouraged
by the tax law.
   This is the direction of corporate debt:
   _Non-financial corporate borrowing as a percentage of gross
national product rose to 67 percent last year from 47 percent 20
years earlier, and 39 percent 30 years ago.
   _In the 20 years through 1989, the ratio of interest expense to
corporate earnings more than doubled to 40 percent.
   _In the late 1980s, half of all funds raised by non-financial
corporations came from debt issues, with the other 50 percent from
equity offerings. But as recently as the 1960s and 1970s, the
average was only 24 percent debt.
   Why debt was encouraged by the tax law in corporate matters
while discouraged elsewhere in the economy is one of the mysteries
of so-called tax reform. Junk bonds and their collapse can be
traced directly to it.
   Not just junk bonds, but other techniques for overleveraging
that preceded the savings and loan crisis, have their roots in tax
law. That, in turn, has led to a self-imposed tight money policy by
banks, relatively high interest rates and a sluggish economy.
   Could this be what the tax reformers had in mind?

   Ren Wanding, a veteran of Chinese jails, was
mentally prepared for arrest several weeks before police arrived at
his apartment door last June 10.
   Even before soldiers and tanks rolled into central Beijing on
June 3 to end popular protests for democracy, Ren's name had been
raised in private official meetings as one of the ``very few
counterrevolutionaries'' who eventually would be blamed for the
whole movement.
   Friends alerted him, but Ren said May 27, after a last meeting
with foreign journalists, that he wasn't running.
   ``This is my freedom of speech,'' said the skinny, bespectacled
accountant, who for six months had been writing and distributing
essays calling for human rights and the rule of law.
   ``I must speak. It is my fate to do these things.''
   Nine months after his arrest, Ren, now 45, was charged with
counterrevolutionary incitement. With his prison record, four years
served for participating in a 1978 democracy movement, he is likely
to get more than the minimum five years.
   ``I keep having this vision, that Ren comes home and I'm not
there and he can't get in,'' his wife, Zhang Fengying, said soon
after his arrest.
   Now, with hope of an early release gone, friends say she has
become deeply depressed. She has not been allowed to see him, only
to deliver clothes and books.
   Ren is believed held in Qincheng Prison, western Beijing, where
many of last year's protesters were sent, but it has not been
confirmed. There have been no reports on his condition, but before
his arrest Ren predicted he would manage.
   ``I'm experienced,'' he said.
   A little more is known about the fate of Wang Dan, a Beijing
University sophomore who was at the forefront of many marches and
was arrested in July.
   Reports from others jailed with him and later released, and from
friends who received a postcard from jail, indicate he has enough
to eat but little exercise, and is allowed to read newspapers and
approved books.
   His parents, Beijing intellectuals, were allowed to visit in
January, a rare exception to the usual rule of no visits before
sentencing.
   Some reports say Wang has shown what authorities call ``a good
attitude'' and may be released, but two large prisoner releases _
573 people last winter and 211 in May _ did not include him.
   Just before martial law was declared in May 1989, Wang, then 20,
was impatient when asked if he feared arrest.
   Didn't he remember Wei Jingsheng, another youth who led a
democracy movement and has been in jail for 11 years?
   ``How can we worry about one person's safety?'' Wang replied,
standing in his dormitory hall with a dinner bowl in his hand.
``Besides, I'm too busy. What can we do, anyway? If they want to
arrest us, they will.''
   Gao Xin, a hunger striker released from prison in December,
believes his friend and fellow hunger striker, Liu Xiaobo, also
will be freed.
   ``It's as if the government is sifting sand,'' said Gao, who
used to edit a university newspaper but has been unemployed since
his release. ``The little pieces will fall through the sieve _ I
fell out early _ and only the big ones will be charged.''
   He acknowledged that Liu, a teacher of Chinese literature with a
passion for politics, might be a ``big piece.'' Liu returned from
New York, where he planned to lecture at Columbia University, to
take part in the spring democracy movement.
   Official media have singled him out frequently. The government
even compiled a slim paperback volume of criticism of the ``crazy
turmoil inciter.''
   Liu, 34, has not been charged with anything so far, even though
he has been held since early June. His wife and in-laws were
allowed to visit him in January at Qincheng Prison _ a good sign,
Gao said _ and found he had put on weight from lack of exercise.
   He is allowed to read books sent from home. Reports are that he,
like most of the other intellectuals, receives better treatment
from guards than common criminals and is not physically abused.
   Despite the releases, arrests continue. Chinese sources said
police went to the home of a college teacher last month and told
him to come for a walk. He never returned.
   A few dissidents still write political tracts and plant them
cautiously in bicycle racks and public places, but they meet only
in very small groups of trusted friends and have no immediate plans
for protests or acts of sabotage.
   Some would-be activists make pilgrimages to Beijing, seeking
leadership. Recently, a 20-year-old worker got off a train from the
south and began looking for ``an armed rebel group,'' without
success. None is known to exist.
   ``In our country, there aren't many people willing to sacrifice
themselves,'' he said disconsolately. ``I am willing.''
   Sacrifice is more prosaic for the wife of one jailed protester.
Without his income, she faces financial difficulty. She has had to
send their child to her parents and fears losing their apartment.
   She said she is willing to deal with those problems because,
``while he is in jail, I should sacrifice.''
   When he comes out, she said, ``I'll dance up a storm.''

<HEAD>Daunting Odds for Candidates Who Take on House Members</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The odds are daunting for the 400 or so
candidates who will challenge incumbent congressmen this November.
Chances are, fewer than a dozen will win.
   Discontent over the pay raise that House members voted
themselves, talk of a tax increase and ethical lapses could spell
trouble for some members of Congress.
   But over the years few bets have been safer than a House
incumbent's re-election. The success rate has been as high as 98
percent in recent years and many believe the re-election rate will
approach that figure this time around.
   The two parties are jostling over about 30 ``open'' seats, where
no incumbent is running. But otherwise this fall generally is
viewed as a warm-up for 1992.
   That's when the pattern should break. The redrawing of
congressional districts and a surge in retirements will reshape the
House, giving Republicans a rare chance to regain a House majority,
or to come close.
   Currently, the House is controlled by Democrats by a 257-176
margin, with two vacancies.
   ``Basically the parties have written off the House in 1990 and
are putting all their energies into '92,'' said Thomas Mann of the
Brookings Institution, a liberal think tank.
   With all the advantages available to members of Congress, high
re-election rates have become the norm for House races, much more
so than for senators.
   Members of Congress have an arsenal of weapons to keep their
names in front of voters: taxpayer-financed mail privileges, a
staff to help solve constituents' problems, ready access to news
coverage and an overwhelming advantage in raising money.
   ``Let's face it,'' said Rep. John G. Rowland, R-Conn. ``You have
to be a bozo to lose this job.''
   Some call this the ``permanent Congress.'' It is at the heart of
political debates over campaign finance reform, redistricting, even
proposals to limit House and Senate members to 12 years in office.
   Rowland, who is running for governor, is among the handful
bypassing likely re-election. Republicans, stymied by 36 years in
the minority, are more frequently departing the House for other
offices. Eight are running for the Senate this year.
   For those who choose to remain, the odds are good.
   The rate of re-election has been 98 percent or better in the
last two election years, and it was 96 percent in the face of the
1984 Republican presidential landslide. The rate hasn't dipped
below 90 percent since 1974, the Watergate year that swept
Republicans out of Congress.
   Over the last two election years, only 15 out of more than 800
candidates who challenged incumbents were successful.
   A challenger's best chance to overcome the odds comes when
scandal befalls the incumbent. Of the seven incumbents who were
defeated in 1988, four had been implicated in scandal.
   Scandal already has claimed one seat this year. Republican
Donald E. ``Buz'' Lukens of Ohio lost renomination after he was
convicted on misdemeanor charges for having sex with a 16-year-old
girl.
   But even a sex scandal doesn't necessarily end a House career.
Democratic Rep. Barney Frank of Massachusetts, who admitted he had
a relationship with a male prostitute, is given a good chance of
winning re-election this year.
   Both parties' congressional campaign committees have targeted
some incumbents for defeat, based on scandal or other
vulnerability. Among those considered vulnerable are the 22
Democrats and 20 Republicans who were elected with 55 percent or
less of the vote in 1988.
   Democrats, for example, hope to oust Rep. Denny Smith, R-Ore.,
who won re-election by just 707 votes last time, is on the hit list
of a national abortion-rights group and has become enmeshed in the
savings and loan problems.
   Republicans see an opportunity to oust some potentially
vulnerable Democrats but also must defend the seats vacated by
their Senate candidates.Most of their best opportunities are for
vacant Democratic seats.
   Their other targets include three North Carolina Democrats whose
districts always produce squeakers.
   The pay raise Congress voted itself late last year could emerge
as an issue for challengers, even though Republican and Democratic
leaders agreed to a non-aggression pact to win its passage.
   Some challengers are using the issue anyway. It is blamed for
the surprisingly close scrape veteran Rep. John Murtha, D-Pa., had
in his recent primary.
   President Bush's apparent willingness to consider tax increases
as part of a budget solution could confound some Republican
candidates' plans to attack Democrats as tax raisers. Ed Rollins,
head of the Republican Congressional Campaign Committee, called the
tax talk ``a disaster'' for his candidates.
   Charles Cook, who publishes a political newsletter, argues that
a surprise may be in store for incumbents of both parties this year.
   Congress, he figures, has taken a beating over the pay raise,
savings-and-loan scandals, sex scandals, and attention on speech
fees and campaign money since Speaker Jim Wright was forced to
resign.
   ``A potentially explosive combination of unrelated events and
news stories with a single common thread are all extremely
unflattering to Congress,'' Cook said. ``The result may well be a
re-election rate closer to the normal 94 percent to 96 percent
range.''
   Both parties need skillful challengers to exploit any
possibilities, and recruiting good candidates has been a problem.
   Republicans in particular have had trouble, and their longtime
minority status in the House is only one reason.
   ``It's much easier for Democrats to recruit a candidate than for
the Republicans,'' said Rep. Mickey Edwards, D-Okla. ``Republicans
tend to be people who want government out of their lives. ...
They're just not inclined.''
   Money is the big obstacle for any challenger. Special-interest
political action committees, or PACs, tend to direct their money to
the candidate most likely to win.
   ``Political campaigns today are determined by money, media and
personal influence,'' said Harold Coker, a Republican who lost a
1988 challenge in Tennessee. ``If you are `in' you have access to
it all, but if you are `out,' you're just out of luck.''
   The high success rate for incumbents who seek re-election
doesn't mean there isn't turnover in Congress, since some members
opt to run for other office or retire.
   The median number of terms served by House members in the
current Congress is just five, or 10 years, said the Brookings
Institution's Mann.
   The changes expected in 1992 may bring as many as 80 to 100 new
members. Redistricting will encourage retirements and could pit
some incumbents against one another.
   Other incumbents may decide to take the money and run, since
1992 is the last year they can pocket their unspent campaign
treasuries upon retirement.

<TEXT>
   One of the nation's top cops, Reuben M.
Greenberg, is on the ``Most Wanted'' list of two historic Southern
port cities eager to keep him fighting crime on their streets.
   The innovative officer is the once-and-future police chief of
Charleston, S.C. He's also midway through a six-month contract as
public safety director in this bustling coastal city.
   Charleston expects him back in July. Mobile's leaders want him
to stay.
   ``People have got to stop zeroing in on me as the magic man,''
said Greenberg, the author of ``Let's Take Back Our Streets,''
which details the law enforcement philosophy that has made him so
popular on the lecture circuit.
   His methods have worked like magic in Charleston. The murder
rate is half what it was when he arrived in 1982; the overall crime
rate has dropped more than 35 percent.
   Will his methods work in Mobile, a city with 2{ times as many
people and almost six times as much crime as Charleston? That's
what Greenberg is here to find out. If his street-level assault is
effective here, it might work in New York or Los Angeles, too.
   Greenberg does it by putting cops where the crime is _ in
housing projects, on street corners, in front of crack houses and
outside hotels where prostitutes take their customers.
   He works to win the trust and cooperation of inner-city
residents who have lost faith in the system and have come to expect
crime as part of their daily lives.
   ``They've given up whole sections of the city to the criminal
element,'' said Greenberg, 47, who arrived in Mobile on Feb. 1 with
the blessing of Charleston Mayor Joseph Riley Jr.
   ``It's bad, but it wasn't worse than what I expected,'' he said.
``What is worse than I expected is the willingness of the people to
accept criminal activity. I'd like to push down those
expectations.''
   Greenberg himself is somewhat unexpected: black, balding, the
grandson of a Russian Jew who emigrated to Houston and married a
black woman. The family shortened its name to Green and were
practicing Methodists, but Greenberg changed his name back again
and converted to Judaism.
   The chief, who holds master's degrees in public administration
and city planning, began his law enforcement career 22 years ago,
the last eight of which he has spent in Charleston.
   ``He's as energetic as hell,'' Charleston Police Major Edward
Hethington said of Greenberg, who has taken some of his Charleston
officers to Mobile to help train some of this city's force.
   Mobile is Alabama's second-largest city, and Greenberg is the
first black to be placed at the helm of any of the state's major
municipal police forces. Birmingham, the state's largest city, has
a black majority and a black mayor, but it never has had a black
police chief or public safety commissioner.
   Mobile's crime problem mainly involves black perpetrators and
black victims.
   ``If we could have an impact on crime in the black areas, you'd
have a tremendous impact on crime in the city, because that's where
the crime victims are,'' Greenberg said. ``Half of the rape victims
in this town are black women. Almost all of the robbers are blacks,
and their victims are about 70 percent black as well.''
   Early indications are that police in Mobile have made headway in
driving drug dealers out of two housing projects and prostitutes
off the streets. Two recent sweeps snared 39 people seeking to buy
sex in downtown areas long known for illicit sexual activity.
   If a drug dealer is controlling a street corner, Greenberg puts
an officer on the same corner every day until the dealer goes away.
The result: public confidence is restored, and the dealer and
drug-related crime disappear. In the Charleston projects, there
were only 18 drug-dealing arrests last year.
   ``The key to the thing is at the retail level,'' Greenberg said.
``That's where you have to hit them.''
   Public Housing Director James Alexander said the two housing
projects targeted by Greenberg were ``clean as a whistle'' after
the public safety commissioner opened police stations inside the
projects and started chasing drug dealers on scooters.
   ``You'll see crime being reduced dramatically in the areas in
which we control,'' Greenberg predicted. ``Eventually, that will be
the city as a whole. I would want to see it for a six-month period.
I wouldn't want to see a month or two months _ that's
flash-in-the-pan.
   ``Even after a year, I wouldn't be satisified, until you really
turn the corner. You're going to have two or three years of
decreasing crime in areas that you're impacting. You better hope
it's not increasing in the areas you're not impacting.''
   Part of Greenberg's crime-fighting strategy is to convince
ghetto residents that the police will respond to them. Common
courtesy on his officers' part is one way to do it, and Greenberg
sets the example.
   ``He missed his first meeting with me in Charleston by 20
minutes because he stopped to help a woman get her car started,''
Mobile Mayor Mike Dow said, noting that Greenberg has his officers
carry jumper cables in their patrol cars, something they didn't do
before.
   ``He's just very conscious of the public.''

   Here are brief profiles of leaders of the Chinese
pro-democracy movement crushed a year ago:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   IN EXILE
   Wu'er Kaixi _ 22, a freshman education major at Beijing Normal
University who grabbed a megaphone during one of the first sit-down
protsts and persuaded the crowd to hold its ground against police.
He became one of the movement's most prominent leaders and boldly
challenged Premier Li Peng during a televised meeting. Wu'er went
into hiding June 4, 1989, and turned up in Hong Kong three weeks
later. He now lives in the United States.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Chai Ling _ 24, sometimes called La Pasionaria of Tiananmen
Square for her emotional, tearful speeches. She was a graduate
psychology student at Beijing Normal University and emerged as a
spokeswoman early in the pro-democracy movement. Some other
students said she was too unstable and fond of notoriety. She was
among the 21 most-wanted students after the June 4 army attack.
After months in hiding, Chai and her husband, Feng Congde, also on
the wanted list, arrived in Paris in April. She has been nominated
for the 1990 Nobel Peace Prize.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   IN JAIL
   Wang Dan _ 21, sophomore history student at Beijing University,
arrested in July 1989 after being named the most-wanted student
leader in China. He became prominent on campus in 1988 by
organizing unofficial lectures. Guest speakers included physicist
and political dissident Fang Lizhi, whom Wang greatly admired.
Later, he helped lead the spring marches. Wang's parents, both
Beijing intellectuals, were allowed to visit him in prison in
January. He has not been charged.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Liu Gang _ 29, No. 3 on the government list of most-wanted
protest leaders after Wang Dan and Wu'er Kaixi. Liu took part in
1986-87 student marches for democracy while a graduate physics
student at Beijing University. When last year's movement began, he
was working at a research institute and joined the students. On
June 19, state television announced his arrest in Baoding, south of
Beijing, where he was posing as a worker. There has been no word of
him since.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Chen Xiaoping, 29, a teacher at the Politics and Law University
in Beijing, who was arrested last summer. Friends say Chen was a
Communist Party member who believed the system could be reformed
from within. His first act of protest came as a graduate student at
Beijing University in 1985, when he criticized officials for
banning a student pro-democracy demonstration in Tiananmen Square.
Last spring, he helped organize Beijing citizens behind the latest
protest. A recent unconfirmed report said he was sentenced to 15
years in prison.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Ren Wanding _ 45, arrested at home June 10. An accountant with
thick glasses and an intense manner, Ren took part in the 1978-79
democracy movement, which also was put down by senior leader Deng
Xiaoping. He spent four years in jail. In November 1988, Ren began
writing essays commemorating the earlier movement and calling for
democratic change. When students began marching in the spring of
1989, he made speeches on campuses and at Tiananmen Square. He was
charged in March with counterrevolutionary incitement, but there
has been no word of a trial. His sentence could range from five
years in prison to death.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Liu Xiaobo _ 34, a lecturer in Chinese literature at Beijing
Normal, arrested the first week of June 1989 while bicycling from a
friend's home. He was an outspoken critic of what he considered
repressive aspects of traditional culture. When the protests began,
he returned from the United States, where he was to teach at
Columbia University, and joined in. He and three friends began a
hunger strike June 2 in support of the students. When soldiers
reached Tiananmen Square the morning of June 4, the four negotiated
a peaceful retreat for the students. His wife and in-laws visited
Liu at Qincheng Prison in January. He has not been charged.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Zhang Zhiyong _ About 24, a graduate student in international
relations at Beijing University, arrested in July in Nanjing. He
was one of three students who knelt for hours on the steps of the
Great Hall of the People on April 22, 1989. They sought to deliver
a student petition to China's top leaders, who were at a funeral
service inside for former Communist Party chief Hu Yaobang. Friends
said Zhang was optimistic to the end that the party would grant
democratic reforms. He favored compromise rather than
confrontation, a course other students rejected. Sources say he
shares a cell with several other students. He has not been allowed
visitors, but was permitted to write his family a letter.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Zhang Weiping _ A senior at the Zhejiang Fine Arts Institute in
Hangzhou, sentenced in August to nine years in prison for having
told the Voice of America that Hangzhou students forced local
authorities to fly the flag at half-mast in honor of protesters
slain June 3-4 in Beijing. The report was not true and Zhang was
accused of spreading counterrevolutionary propaganda.

   Fuzzy may not seem like a good feature for a
camcorder, but Japanese electronics companies say ``fuzzy logic''
allows their new hand-held video cameras to produce sharper,
jitter-free pictures.
   The camcorders are the latest in a growing number of Japanese
consumer appliances to incorporate fuzzy logic, which uses
high-powered semiconductors to enable computers to reason more like
humans and recognize the nuances of the real world.
   The trend is yet another example of Japanese manufacturers
taking an innovation developed in the United States and
incorporating it more rapidly in consumer goods.
   Most computers can process information only in ``yes-no'' form,
such as ``black or white'' or ``near or far.'' But fuzzy logic
allows computers to think in degrees such as ``medium gray'' or
``rather close.''
   To make such distinctions, the camcorders are packed with
technology _ so much so that analysts say they're in the same
league as hardware used in military guidance systems or
reconnaissance satellites.
   In fact, the devices share many of the same technologies _ CCD
sensors that convert light images to digital signals, digital
pattern recognition circuits, sophisticated semiconductors and
computers, all in super-miniature size.
   A camcorder's microcomputer uses fuzzy logic to give more
accurate auto-focusing and auto-exposure by responding more
smoothly and quickly to changing conditions, Itaru Ishizawa of
Sanyo Electric Co. said.
   Sanyo's VM-ES88, the first camcorder to use fuzzy logic, sets
the lens' exposure by dividing the image into 64 parts. By
measuring the relative brightness of each part, the camera can
calculate the best exposure and compensate automatically for strong
lighting in front or back of the subject, he said.
   Most camcorders focus on whatever is in the middle of their
field of view, but the VM-ES88's fuzzy logic helps it stay focused
when a subject moves away from the center, Ishizawa said.
   The 8mm format camcorder weighs 1.7 pounds and is being sold in
Japan for the equivalent of $1,060. Sanyo plans to begin marketing
it in the United States in July and in Europe in the fall, Ishizawa
said.
   Pentax is selling in Japan under its own brand name a similar
camcorder made by Sanyo. It has the additional feature of
time-lapse recording, such as one frame every 10 seconds, Toshihiro
Tanaka of Pentax said.
   The company plans to begin sales in both the United States and
Europe in the fall, he said.
   Matsushita Electric Industrial's new camcorder takes a different
hi-tech tack for sharpening images with an electronic image
stabilizer.
   The stabilizer reduces picture jitter caused by unsteady hands
by digitally analyzing the camera's images and storing them in a
memory. It detects brief shifts from previous images resulting from
camera shakes and recalls the earlier image from the memory to
smooth out the picture, Matsushita said.
   Matsushita, which uses the Panasonic brand name overseas, said
it will begin selling the camcorder, called NV-S1, in Japan next
month for the equivalent of $1,075. The unit, which uses VHS-C
tapes, weighs 1.6 pounds.
   Sony, meanwhile, has announced a Video Walkman component set
with a separate camera, deck, monitor and tuner that can be used in
any combination.
   The 8mm format set, featuring the world's smallest and lightest
video deck at 1.1 pounds and stereo sound, will begin selling in
Japan in July for $1,070, the company said.
   Fuzzy logic was first developed in the 1960s by Lofti Zadeh, a
professor at the University of California at Berkeley, but has won
greater popularity in recent years in Japan.
   It guides elevators and subway trains to smooth starts and
stops, and helps Sony's new keyboardless computer recognize
thousands of hand-written Japanese characters.
   In recent months it even has appeared in the controls of washing
machines, where it measures the degree of dirt in the clothes and
amount of laundry, and in vacuum cleaners, where it calculates the
quantity of dust and type of floor.
   Fuzzy logic's rapid rise in popularity among Japanese
manufacturers illustrates the fierce technological competition in
Japan's marketplace. It also shows how Japanese companies struggle
to develop a market for new technologies.
   ``Fuzzy logic is a difficult concept to explain to customers,''
Sanyo's Ishizawa said. ``We generally explain that it's a more
human way of analyzing information.''
   The company has produced a videotape, he said, to explain the
idea at stores selling the product.

   The popular Macintosh computer may be facing its
strongest challenge yet as Microsoft Corp. unveils software that
gives IBM computers and their clones the same easy-to-use features
as the Apple Computer Inc. machine.
   Experts say the newest version of Microsoft's Windows product
successfully replaces the arcane technical commands of most IBM
computers with friendly on-screen graphics and a ``mouse,'' or
hand-held control device.
   The development is being hailed by many computer experts as a
watershed event for the Redmond, Wash.-based software company led
by multibillionaire Bill Gates.
   Microsoft was scheduled to present its latest Windows at news
conferences today in New York and several other cities in the
United States and abroad.
   In addition to generating a publicity deluge, the introduction
of the new software has grabbed the attention of Microsoft's
competitors and pushed the price of Microsoft shares to a new
52-week high.
   Windows could spell trouble for Apple by ending the dilemma of
many computer buyers: Whether to buy a user-friendly Macintosh, or
an IBM or clone, which are harder to use but generally cheaper and
compatible with many office systems.
   For Apple, ``it means they have seen their innovation lead in
the market diminished,'' said Rick Sherlund, a computer analyst at
Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co.
   PaineWebber Inc. analyst Stephen K. Smith last week downgraded
his rating of Apple stock from ``neutral'' to ``unattractive'' due
to Windows. Smith hailed the new product as the biggest software
development since the advent of 1-2-3, the spreadsheet program from
Lotus Development Corp. that is among the most popular computer
applications.
   Those opinions helped send Apple stock down $1.75 a share Friday
in national over-the-counter trading to close at $39.75, while
Microsoft shares, also traded over the counter, rose $3.50 to close
at $68.25. On Monday, Microsoft rose $2 more to $70.25; Apple fell
25 cents to $39.50 after adjusting for a dividend.
   Coincidentally, Lotus announced late Friday it had called off
its plan to merge with software maker Novell Inc. The merger was
seen as providing a viable competitor to Microsoft in the personal
computer software market.
   Apple, meanwhile, isn't standing still. The Cupertino,
Calif.-based company is expected later this year to introduce a
low-price version of the Macintosh. Apple also filed a lawsuit
against Microsoft in 1988 contending earlier versions of Windows _
and, by implication, the new version _ infringe on Macintosh
patents. The case is pending.
   Many experts say the Macintosh still is tops for
graphics-intensive uses, such as desktop publishing.
   Microsoft also denies it is trying to edge out the Macintosh.
Russ Warner, who headed the Windows development unit, says it would
be crazy for the company to target the 7 percent of the computer
market that uses the Macintosh, instead of the estimated 85 percent
that uses IBM computers and their clones.
   ``We're talking about getting those 85 percent to understand the
benefits of graphics,'' Warner said.
   Most IBM machines and compatibles use an operating system call
MS-DOS, developed by Microsoft. Operating systems allow a computer
to perform such basic functions as opening files and responding to
keyboard commands.
   But MS-DOS is notorious for its complex series of typed commands.
   Windows, a type of program called a graphical user interface,
shields users from these commands by replacing them with on-screen
pictures called icons and a mouse.
   For example, instead of having to type a command telling the
computer to print a file, Windows provides a representation of a
printer. The user moves the cursor on the screen to the printer and
pushes a button on the mouse to print the file.
   Windows software was introduced in 1985, later followed by a
second version. But computer experts said neither provided a true
competitor to the Macintosh.
   The new version, which will sell for $149, is vastly better,
they say. In addition to providing a graphics-based way to operate
computer functions, it can run several applications programs at
once in different sections of the computer screen, called
``windows.'' It also greatly expands the amount of computer memory.
   Microsoft is expected to get a major boost from Windows. The
company says the potential market for the software is about 30
million personal computers already in use.
   Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. projects Windows and related
products will reap nearly $500 million in revenues for Microsoft in
the fiscal year that starts July 1.
   Windows also is expected to help companies that make
applications programs, such as word processing and spreadsheets,
because computer users must buy specially tailored versions of
these programs to gain the advantages of Windows. Microsoft is
among the major makers of these programs.
   Windows also is expected to have an impact on an alternative
operating system for personal computers developed by Microsoft and
International Business Machines Corp., called Operating System 2,
or OS-2.
   OS-2 was promoted as a graphics-based system for IBM personal
computers when it was introduced in 1987, but it failed to catch on.

   Tougher competition in the automotive
industry threatens the United Auto Workers' attempt to force a
common contract on the nation's Big Three automakers, some analysts
say.
   For the first time in 11 years, contracts between the UAW and
General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. will expire
at the same time _ midnight, Sept. 14.
   But the so-called pattern bargaining that characterized labor
relations until 1979 may not be feasible in the hotly competitive
1990s.
   In the past decade U.S. automakers have lost market share, faced
financial crises, slashed costs, joined with Japanese companies in
joint ventures, closed factories and trimmed salaried and hourly
work forces.
   The moves were inspired, at least in part, by competition from
Japanese automakers, first with cars imported from overseas and
later with vehicles made in the United States.
   As a result, negotiating strategies have changed. Twenty years
ago, when the Big Three completely dominated the U.S. market, the
UAW would pick one company as a target, settle on a contract and
then impose the terms the other two.
   In turn, that contract would serve as a model for other large
industrial unions, including steel and rubber workers.
   But Dale Brickner of Michigan State University says those days
are over.
   ``These firms have different cost factors, they have different
abilities to pay,'' he said Monday. ``If a pattern means that you
are going back to the years of Xerox contracts, those days are dead
and gone.''
   UAW President Owen Bieber, speaking after the first day of a
three-day union bargaining convention in Kansas City, disagreed.
   ``We're not going to end pattern bargaining,'' he said. ``I just
moved Chrysler last time (in 1988) to a common expiration date.
We're not going to get off pattern.''
   In 1979, when Chrysler was on the brink of financial ruin, the
No. 3 automaker broke from the pattern. Chrysler today faces fresh
financial problems and industry observers have said it again is the
mostly likely company to break the newly revived pattern.
   Chrysler's labor vice president, Anthony St. John, recently
sounded an ominous tone when he said if the current contract is
continued with no changes, it would boost the struggling
automaker's labor costs by 16 percent.
   That hinted at the possibility of Chrysler seeking concessions
from the UAW, something the union reluctantly swallowed in the
early 1980s. Chrysler workers returned to near pay parity with
their counterparts at Ford and GM in 1988.
   This year's negotiations, Brickner said, ``will determine
whether an old econmic pattern will continue at all. With the
Japanese in there, it ain't the same game any more.''

<HEAD>Greyhound Offers To Buy Back Notes In Attempt To Avoid Bankruptcy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Greyhound Lines Inc., acknowledging the heavy cost
of a strike by its bus drivers, has asked holders of $225 million
of its junk bonds to sell them back at steep discounts to keep the
company out of bankruptcy.
   The company also said Monday it was changing its pay scale for
drivers and withdrawing proposed bonus and pension schemes to save
money.
   ``The ability to restructure the balance sheet in some way is
very important to avoid bankruptcy,'' said Michael Doyle, the
company's chief financial officer.
   The comment marked a dramatic change in tone from just two weeks
ago, when Greyhound's chairman confidently declared victory in the
strike after contract talks failed.
   ``The cost of the strike has been pretty expensive,'' Doyle
said, and cash is ``very tight.'' Nevertheless, he said the only
nationwide bus company is able to meet its payroll and buy fuel.
   Greyhound issued a variety of junk bonds to refinance debt taken
on in a leveraged buyout three years ago.
   The bonds include $150 million due in 1995 that pay interest of
13 percent and $75 million of 12.5 percent bonds due in 1997. The
two issues represented more than half of the company's total debt
of $359 million at the end of 1989.
   The company is technically in default on the first issue after
missing a recent interest payment, and noteholders could force the
company into bankruptcy.
   As a result, Greyhound said it was making a cash tender offer to
redeem the 13 percent notes at 54 percent of their face value and
the 12.5 percent notes at 27.5 percent.
   Doyle said both offers are higher than prices currently quoted
for the bonds in secondary markets.
   The offer is conditional on its acceptance by a majority of
noteholders, plus their agreement of a change in some terms on the
notes, especially those that restrict Greyhound's indebtedness and
call for certain levels of net worth. The offer also is conditional
on Greyhound being able to find financing to buy the bonds.
   The company's total debt stood at $359 million at the end of
1989.
   Most of Greyhound's 6,300 bus drivers walked out March 2 in a
dispute over wages and job security. Greyhound immediately began
operating a reduced schedule with newly hired drivers.
   After attempts to reopen negotiations collapsed, Chairman Fred
G. Currey said May 7 the strike had become ``irrelevant'' because
the carrier had enough drivers to operate.
   Union officials say their strike will continue to hobble
Greyhound and the company will have to return to the bargaining
table.
   Last week, a National Labor Relations official suggested the
company had engaged in an unfair labor practice by instituting its
contract offer on March 2. Such a finding, if upheld, could force
the company to rehire union drivers.
   Greyhound said the strike caused it to lose $56 million in the
first three months of the year.
   The company missed a $9.75 million interest payment due May 15
on the 13 percent notes and did not pay about $5 million in leases
due at the end of April.
   Those missed payments left the door open for creditors to begin
proceedings that could force the company into bankruptcy.
   ``This is a way of starting a dialogue with noteholders,'' Doyle
said of the tender offer. The company put no time limit on the
offer, although Doyle said regulations require it to be open for at
least 20 business days.
   ``If they were to get this exchange offer off successfully, I
would assume that they would avoid Chapter 11,'' said analyst Ken
Frankel with Drake Capital Securities Inc. in Santa Monica, Calif.
``If they don't get it off, all bets are off.''
   Under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code, companies are
protected from creditors while they reorganize.
   Greyhound has hired Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. as a financial advisor
to help in the debt restructuring.
   In another effort to save money, Greyhound said it would
implement an hourly wage scale on Sept. 1, replacing its
mileage-based scale for drivers.
   Spokesman George Gravley said the change from 30 cents a mile to
$12.79 an hour effectively would increase pay for drivers on the
East and West Coasts, but ``flatten or depress'' wages in the
middle of the country.
   The company also withdrew bonus and pension provisions it had
proposed but not implemented.
   In a letter to all employees, Vice President P. Anthony Lannie
said, ``We simply can no longer afford to continue these programs.''

<HEAD>Ad Age Reports Murdoch Shops ``TV Guide,'' Murdoch Denies It</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Rupert Murdoch angrily denied a trade
publication report that he is ``sounding out prospective buyers''
for TV Guide and said he offered $1 million to the publication's
parent if it could prove for its story.
   Advertising Age said Monday that the head of News Corp. Ltd. was
shopping TV Guide around.
   Rance Crain, the editor in chief of Ad Age, said he turned down
the offer ``to bet me $1 million'' because it would have required
revealing the magazine's sources.
   ``We stand by the story completely,'' Crain said in a telephone
interview.
   News Corp. acquired TV Guide as part of a $3 billion buyout of
Triangle Publications Inc. nearly two years ago. That deal also
included Seventeen magazine and the Daily Racing Form.
   The report in Ad Age comes a few weeks after News Corp. agreed
to sell Star magazine, a supermarket tabloid, for $400 million in
cash and securities.
   Murdoch confirmed in a recent interview that he had no plans for
additional major acquisitions over the next few years and would
focus on improving profits at existing operations, which include
magazines, book publishing, newspapers, television stations and the
Fox TV network.
   His company has an estimated $6 billion in debt and has lost
more than $400 million in its effort to launch a satellite-TV
service in Great Britain.
   The Ad Age story said unidentified publishing industry sources
have met with a number of major publishers in recent weeks to gauge
interest in TV Guide, a weekly magazine that the report said ``has
been in an ad page and circulation slump'' since it was acquired in
1988.
   The story said the asking price is an estimated $2.6 billion,
but it said informal bids have been in the $1.5 billion to $2
billion range.
   In a statement which described him as incensed, Murdoch said he
``has $1 million that says TV Guide is not for sale.''
   Murdoch said he had told Crain he would pay $1 million to Crain
Publications ``if the story could be verified and if Crain's could
bring forth anyone with whom News Corp. has had discussions.''
   The statement said Murdoch would expect Crain Publications to
write News Corp. a ``check for a similar amount'' if support for
the story could not be provided. It said Crain declined the offer.
   In the statement, Murdoch said the story ``had no basis in
fact.''
   It said Murdoch also said ``there had been no discussions of a
sale between either he or any News Corp. executives with anyone _
either in the publishing or financial community.''
   Crain said Ad Age had been working on the story for three weeks.
``We did not rush into print,'' he said.
   He said he had received a letter from a lawyer for News Corp.
that demanded the ``identity of the sources who supplied your
reporter with this scurrilous gossip.''
   ``I think Mr. Murdoch wants me to reveal our sources,'' Crain
said. ``I think if he were in the same boat, I don't think he would
either.''

<HEAD>Dollar Falls Against Yen, Stock Gains</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar fell against the Japanese yen today
after a four-day climb, while the Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index
gained moderately.
   The dollar closed at 152.40 yen, down 0.85 yen from Monday's
close of 153.25 yen. After opening at 153.36 yen, it ranged between
152.30 yen and 153.36 yen.
   In the previous four trading days, the dollar had gained a total
of 1.95 yen.
   It declined in Tuesday's trading after a reported remark by U.S.
Treasury Undersecretary David Mulford welcoming the yen's recent
rise against the dollar, said a senior dealer with Mitsubishi Bank,
speaking on condition of anonymity. The dollar fell 6.75 yen in
five trading days before its latest rebound.
   Mulford is in Tokyo for two days of meetings of the Japan-U.S.
working group on Japan's financial markets, which ended Tuesday.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues gained 173.25 points, closing at 31,938.30 points. Tuesday's
advance followed a 248.67-point decline on Monday and a 47.88-point
drop last Friday.
   A total of 500 million shares changed hands, up from 369 million
shares on Monday.
   ``The index rebounded for the first time in three trading days,
encouraged by the yen's appreciation and firmness in the bond
market,'' said Yoshiro Inoue of Nomura Securities.
   Inoue said large-capital issues such as steel and shipbuilding
shares were among gainers.
   The price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year Japanese government
bonds rose to 87.45 points as of 5 p.m. (4 a.m. EDT) from Monday's
close of 87.09. The yield fell to 7.075 percent from 7.150 percent
the previous day.

   The finance minister today rejected
opposition leaders' demands for changes in the new economic treaty
with East Germany and warned that delaying unification could cause
trigger unrest among East Germans.
   West German Finance Minister Theodor Waigel made his remarks in
a speech to the upper house of parliament, the Bundesrat, which
began examining the treaty today.
   Waigel appealed to the opposition Social Democrats not to
attempt to delay the July 2 target date on which the two Germanys
are to be merged into one economic entity.
   His comments came a day after Hans-Jochen Vogel, the Social
Democrats' national chairman, told reporters his party wants to
negotiate with Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government over improving
the treaty's terms for East Germans.
   The Social Democrats favor the economic merger, but maintain the
treaty as written is unfair to East Germans.
   But Waigel told the Bundesrat that rejection of the treaty could
result in worsened social and economic conditions in East Germany.
   ``A new entrance into the basic discussions (on the treaty's
terms) could seriously place East Germany's economic health in
question,'' Waigel said.
   It could also ``heap up ... social problems and social
explosives'' because of East German hopes for a better standard of
living after economic union, he said.
   ``Whoever rejects this treaty must assume the moral, political
and historic responsibiity if German unity is gambled away for a
limitless time,'' Waigel said.
   The Social Democrats' position could spell trouble for the
economic merger treaty, which was signed Friday at a ceremony in
Bonn.
   The treaty must still be approved by the parliaments of both
countries. The Social Democrats recently won control of the upper
house in West Germany's parliament by defeating Kohl's Christian
Democrats in two key state elections.
   The Bundesrat is expected to vote on the treaty June 22. The
lower house, or Bundestag, is scheduled to vote on ratifying the
treaty on June 21.
   Volker Ruehe, the head of Kohl's Christian Democrats, accused
the Social Democrats of displaying an ``alarming amount of
irresponsibility.''
   He appealed to the opposition party ``not to let in a dangerous
risk for the future of all Germans and not to reject the state
treaty'' on economic merger.
   Vogel told reporters the Social Democrats cannot accept the
proposed treaty in its present form because it falls short in
helping create ``modern and qualified jobs'' for East Germans and
guarding against the collapse of East German businesses.
   According to Vogel, the Social Democrats are demanding ``changes
or amendments either within or outside the treaty text.''
   That seemed to leave open the possibility the treaty could be
approved as is, with additions to be worked out later.
   Vogel said the Social Democrats would determine their final
position on the proposed treaty ``in light of answers to our
demands.''
   The Social Democrats could use their majority in the upper house
to slow approval of the treaty. However, they could also decide it
is not in their best political interests to actually block the
merger, since that could cost them votes when joint German
elections are held, possibly at the end of this year.
   East Germany's own Social Democrats _ the sister party of the
West German group _ say they will not try to block the treaty. The
East German Social Democrats are part of their country's coalition
government, and participated in the treaty negotiations.
   Under the merger treaty, West Germany's mark will become East
Germany's own legal tender as of July 2. East Germany will also
start scrapping its centrally planned economy for one that mirrors
West Germany's.
   Thousands of East Germans are already worried they could be hit
hard by their nation's economic overhaul. Many East German
state-run factories are expected to shut down when they are forced
to compete in a free market, and hundreds of thousands of workers
are likely to lose their jobs.
   The East German government slashed prices on everything from
blue jeans to television sets Monday in a bid to lure back
consumers enamored with Western goods.
   Hans Klein, Kohl's chief spokesman, said the government is
``determined to hold to the timetable'' of putting the treaty into
effect July 2.
   Klein also rejected Vogel's charges the treaty does too little
to protect East Germans from joblessness and other economic shocks.
   He said delaying ratification of the treaty could result in
disappointment among East Germans, who are eager to get the West's
powerful mark as their own legal currency.

<HEAD>British Airways Reverses Quarterly Loss, Posts Annual Profit Gain</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British Airways PLC said Tuesday it reversed a
loss in its traditionally weak fiscal fourth quarter, and increased
profits by 40 percent for the full year.
   The airline said the results were helped by strong growth in
routes to Japan, South America and the United States.
   British Airways said its profit for the three months ended March
31 was 31 million pounds, or $52 million, compared with a loss of 2
million pounds, or $3.4 million, in the same period a year ago.
   The airline's earnings translated to 3.8 pence, or 6 cents, a
share.
   Sales rose 13 percent to 1.12 billion pounds, or $1.9 billion,
from 991 million pounds, or $1.7 billion.
   For the full year, earnings totaled 245 million pounds, or $414
million, compared with 175 million pounds, or $296 million, a year
earlier.
   Earnings per share jumped to 31.2 pence, or 53 cents, from 23.3
pence, or 39 cents.
   Sales increased 14 percent to 4.84 billion pounds, or $8.2
billion, from 4.26 billion pounds, or $7.2 billion.
   The company said its results were boosted by the sale of 11
aircraft during the year.
   Staffing costs rose 12 percent, while fuel costs soared 30
percent because of higher world oil prices, the airline said.
   Despite the buoyant earnings, British Airways chairman Lord King
sounded a note of caution for the year ahead.
   ``We are aware that our costs require constant scrutiny,
particularly in view of the increasingly competitive nature of the
market we serve, and the softening of Western economies,'' he said.
   The figures were converted at the current exchange rate of $1.69
to the pound.

<HEAD>Polly Peck Plans to Increase Stake in Sansui</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Polly Peck International PLC said Tuesday it plans
to increase its stake in Sansui Electric Co. Ltd. to 70 percent
from 51 percent after merging two of its electronics subsidiaries
into the Japanese group.
   The move is part of a larger planned restructuring under which
Polly Peck intends to develop its electronics, foods and leisure
businesses as three, largely independent companies.
   Polly Peck, which bought a controlling interest in money-losing
Sansui last October, said it intends to sell its Asian-based
Capetronic Group and Italian-based Imperial Group electronics
divisions to Sansui for the equivalent of $524 million.
   Sansui, which specializes in audio electronics but also is
licensed to manufacture video equipment, plans to finance the
purchase through the sale of shares, most of which will be bought
by Polly Peck, the company said.
   Polly Peck had said at the time of its purchase of the
controlling stake that it intended to broaden Sansui's product
range to include video equipment. Its plans also included putting
Sansui at the head of its own electronics operations.
   Capetronic is a consumer electronics manufacturer with
operations in Taiwan, Hong Kong, Malaysia, China and the U.S.
   Imperial is an Italian maker of large-screen color televisions
and distributor of televisions, audio products and video cassette
recorders.

<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's advisers decided
today to introduce radical reforms next year to try to salvage an
economy plagued by massive shortages, strikes and ethnic conflicts.
   Food prices would double, but the government would continue to
regulate the cost of staple items, a draft of the planned reforms
says. The reforms would not start until next year and would take
place over five years, instead of the two years discussed earlier.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov told a news
briefing the Presidential Council approved the draft report today
and that Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov would present it to the Supreme
Soviet parliament on Thursday. Gerasimov did not say whether the
council had made any changes in the 70-page plan, obtained by The
Associated Press.
   The plan falls short of the free market measures in Poland that
led to a spurt of rapid inflation over the past six months.
   Soviet officials fear that sudden rises in food prices could
touch off riots and strikes, like those that toppled Polish
Communist governments in the 1970's and 1980's.
   Nevertheless, the plan is far more radical than the government
program presented in December to the Soviet Congress, the Supreme
Soviet's parent parliament.
   That plan essentially proposed three more years of a centrally
planned economy, but sentiment is growing that faster steps are
needed to improve production and distribution.
   ``The negative effect of political instability, strikes and
inter-ethnic conflicts is growing ever stronger,'' Ryzhkov's report
says. It appeals to all workers not to strike.
   Ryzhkov's draft came under immediate fire from a parliamentary
opposition group, which plans to present an alternative economic
blueprint advocating a market economy.
   ``This is just another ploy to intimidate the people with the
idea of a free market and consolidate its own positions,'' said
Siberian economist Gennady Filshin, who developed the alternative
plan for the Inter-Regional Group. He was interviewed by the
independent news service Post-Factum.
   The government report emphasizes the need to control inflation,
unemployment and other social ills, but also outlines major price
increases and other reforms beginning in 1991.
   ``The retail prices on food should, on the average, double,
increasing by 112 billion rubles ($187 million),'' says the report.
   However, the prices of basic foodstuffs _ including bread, meat
and oil _ will remain under government regulation and not be
allowed to spiral out of control, the plan says.
   It also provides for wage indexing to cushion the effect on the
country's poor.
   Frightening figures on current economic performance explain the
government's new readiness to take harsh measures. In the first
three months of this year, cash incomes swelled by 13.4 percent
while the gross national product declined, the report says.
   From January to April, political strikes and inter-ethnic
conflicts led to the loss of 9.5 million man-hours, compared to 7
million man-hours lost during all of last year.
   The government plan foresees passage of all the laws needed for
the transition to a market economy by the end of this fall. It says
``predictions show that in 1995 the country will be in a position
to accumulate the real financial means and resources'' to let the
economy leap ahead.
   Current prices in state stores for many basic foods are
extremely low, with potatoes costing as little as 8 cents a pound
and beef $1.80 a pound.
   The Soviet economy is plagued with shortages, and free prices at
farmer's markets have rocketed to $16 a pound for beef and up to
about $8 a pound for new potatoes. Commodities are rationed in some
regions.

   Stock prices swept ahead in early trading today,
lifting the Dow Jones industrial average into uncharted territory
once again.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which on Monday gained
nearly 25 points to post its fourth record high in the past six
sessions, was up another 25.81 at 2,870.49 after the first
half-hour of trading.
   Advancing issues outpaced losers by a margin of about 3 to 1 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with
742 up, 232 down and 449 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 38.89 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street compared with 17.80 million shares at the same
point Monday.
   The stock market has rolled up some impressive gains over the
past three weeks in a rally that has been attributed mainly to
declines in interest rates.
   The credit markets provided a fresh lift this morning as rates
edged lower. Yields on 30-year Treasury bonds slipped below 8.64
percent in early dealings from 8.68 percent late Monday.
   While some analysts foresee no imminent end to the stock
market's rally, others say a pullback is inevitable, particularly
if the Federal Reserve fails to take steps that would actively
encourage more rate declines.
   In the early going on the NYSE, Philip Morris was up &lsqb; at 44|,
American Express rose &rsqb; to 30&rsqb; and General Motors was up \ at 49\.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was

index rose 1.03 to 360.39.
   On Monday, the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 24.77 points
to 2,844.68, surpassing the previous closing high of 2,831.71 it
reached last Thursday.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 9 to 5 on the
NYSE, with 980 up, 531 down and 496 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 166.28 million shares, against 162.52

   The stock market moved broadly higher today in

record closing level of the previous session.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which on Monday gained

   The stock market has rolled up some impressive gains over the
past three weeks in a rally that has been attributed mainly to
declines in interest rates.
   Declining rates help stocks by making their potential rewards

rates also can improve the profit outlook for some companies by
cutting their borrowing costs.

<HEAD>Japan-U.S. Officials Clash on Interest Rate Deregulation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ELAINE KURTENBACH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Treasury officials and their Japanese
counterparts ended two days of talks today sharply divided over a
U.S. request that Japan move quicker to lift interest rate controls.
   U.S. Undersecretary of the Treasury David C. Mulford said the
Japanese refusal to provide a timetable for deregulating interest
rates on bank deposits within one year could push U.S. regulators
toward imposing limits on Japanese financial activities in the
United States.
   Japan's reluctance to promise faster liberalization could aid
passage of a legislation being considered in Congress that calls
for retaliatory action against foreign financial firms in the
United States if their own governments do not give U.S. companies
reciprocal treatment, he said.
   ``Rapid action to complete the deregulation process in Japan
would avoid what otherwise will become an area of serious political
conflict,'' Mulford said.
   ``The Treasury is in the process of preparing a national
treatment study for the U.S. Congress on the status of U.S.
financial firms in foreign financial markets,'' he said. ``As of
today, it will not be possible for the U.S. Treasury to give a
positive report on the Japanese market.''
   Vice Minister of Finance Makoto Utsumi said the two sides agreed
on the goals for complete liberalization of Japan's once strictly
controlled financial markets, but clearly disagreed on the timing.
   He likened the process of reform to mountain biking:
   ``The problem is we are now facing the final stage of
liberalization, and the slope is steeper, the problems become more
serious. We have to complete the process without causing a heart
attack,'' he said.
   Utsumi declined to elaborate on the reasons why Japan could not
provide a timetable for lifting interest rates, but said the
ministry planned to eventually lift all controls on rates for bank
deposits.
   The Finance Ministry is reportedly considering proposals that
would stretch the process of lifting interest ceilings to 1993 or
later _ far beyond the U.S. proposal for a one-year deadline.
   ``We believe it is important to complete the process as quickly
as possible. But this `mountain bike' is like a bicycle built for
two, and whenever we get some speed up ... the Ministry of Finance
puts on the brakes,'' Mulford said.
   Analysts say the ministry faces strong opposition to interest
rate deregulation from small- and medium-size banks that are
already facing difficulties due to higher interest rates and
limited liberalization.
   Japan's central bank has raised its key rate for loans to
commercial banks from 2.5 percent to 5.25 percent in the past year.
In turn, commercial banks' prime lending rates jumped from about
5.5 percent to 7.2 percent.
   The higher rates banks must pay to depositors make it more
expensive for them to acquire funds for lending and investment.
   Moreover, a reduction in the minimum purchase for money market
certificates from $62,500 to $6,250 means banks now must pay 5.8
percent interest to a growing pool of depositors, compared with the
0.75 percent paid on ordinary bank accounts.
   Utsumi bluntly disagreed with Mulford's assertion that interest
rate controls were in effect subsidizing Japanese banks, giving
them a source of artificially cheap capital for loans and other
investments and enabling them to expand their presence overseas.
   ``To avoid foreign exchange exposure ... loans overseas are made
with funds in the same currency the loans are denominated in,''
Utsumi said.
   Mulford said some progress had been made in Japanese moves to
expand ceilings on individuals' overseas accounts and to allow
their use for portfolio investment.
   He said Finance Ministry officials had promised to approve new
foreign exchange-related and securitized financial products and
allow foreign securities firms to establish banking facilities to
handle foreign exchange services.
   Mulford said the U.S. was pleased by a pledge to approve the use
of the GLOBEX trading system by the end of June.
   GLOBEX is a global electronic automated transaction system for
the trading of futures and futures options jointly operated by the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Reuters Holdings PLC.

   Grain and soybean futures prices edged higher in
early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade amid signs of
stronger export sales and forecasts for more rain in the Midwest
next week.
   The slightly stronger opening represented a modest rebound from
moderate to sharp losses in Monday's session.
   Analysts attributed the early strength in part to new wheat
export prospects, including a government offer to subsidize sales
of 2 million metric tons of U.S. wheat to Algeria.
   The Agriculture Department also said it had accepted bids from
private exporters to cover a sale of nearly 400,000 metric tons of
wheat to China at subsidized prices.
   Monday's weekly USDA export-inspections report showed a
larger-than-expected amount of corn earmarked for export last week.
Wheat inspections were about as expected while soybean inspections
were below expectations.
   Corn and soybean planting is progressing at a slower-than-normal
pace, according to another USDA report released Monday. And the
National Weather Service's latest six-to-10-day forecast predicts
wetter-than-normal conditions in the Midwest early next week, which
could further delay planting.
   In early trading, wheat futures were \ cent lower to \ cent
higher with the contract for delivery in July at $3.36} a bushel;
corn futures were } cent to 2\ cents higher with July at $2.77} a
bushel; oats were 1 cent to 2 cents higher with July at $1.53\ a
bushel; soybeans were 3 cents to 5\ cents higher with July at $6.14
a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mostly lower in early trading on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .57 cent lower to .05 cent higher with June at
74.40 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .42 cent lower
with May at 85.50 cents a pound; live hogs were unchanged to .68
cent lower with June at 66.55 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .40 cent lower to .23 cent higher with May at 67.85 cents a
pound.
   Cattle futures advanced on Monday while pork futures settled
mixed.

   A Colorado savings and loan that counted one
of President Bush's sons as a director made inflated loans to
developers who had to reinvest part of the money in the thrift,
federal regulators said today.
   The House Banking Committee opened two days of hearings on the
$1 billion collapse of the Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan
Association of Denver. Bush's son, Neil, and other former board
members are to testify on Wednesday.
   A panel of thrift regulators told the committee they found a
``quid pro quo'' lending program at Silverado, under which
developers received loans to buy buildings at inflated values set
by outside appraisers.
   The properties' values had been inflated $270 million to $300
million, they said.
   The regulators told the banking committee that Silverado's board
of directors operated as a ``rubber stamp'' for management. They
also said insider abuse occurred at the thrift.
   ``Because management of Silverado took excessive risks, engaged
in abusive or questionable practices to generate short-term gains,
and undertook innovative manipulations to avoid recording losses,
the role of the directors was even more crucial,'' the regulators'
statement said. ``Throughout Silverado's history, the board did
little beyond rubber-stamping the activities of its sophisticated,
bright and manipulative management team.''
   The panel of regulators testifying today included Stephen P.
Hershkowitz, deputy director of enforcement at the Office of Thrift
Supervision, and Brian C. McCormally, Terry Sandefur and Dorothy
Van Cleave of the OTS district office in Topeka, Kan.
   Kermit Mowbray, former president of the Federal Home Loan Bank
of Topeka, did not appear and Gonzalez said he would ask the
committee to subpoena Mowbray, who is in Greece.
   In exchange for receiving loans bigger than the market price of
the buildings, the developers were required to use the surplus part
of the loan money to buy preferred stock in Silverado's holding
company or to purchase an interest in a ``loan pool'' set up by the
thrift.
   The pool, which contained both good and bad loans, totaled
around $1 billion or roughly 60 percent of Silverado's total loan
portfolio. The developers who bought shares in the loan pool
received interest generated by the performing loans in the pool.
   Examiners said Monday they believed this arrangement was unique
in the S&amp;L industry.
   Federal regulators declined to say Monday whether the
appraisers, who included accounting firms Coopers &amp; Lybrand and
Ernst &amp; Young, also were under investigation.
   Government investigators said Monday they believe Robert M.
Lewis, former vice chairman and chief financial officer of
Silverado, was the ``financial guru'' who probably invented the
concept of the loan pool.
   The December 1988 collapse of Silverado, now operating as part
of Columbia Savings, the largest thrift in Colorado, is expected to
cost U.S. taxpayers as much as $1 billion. Total losses from the
nationwide savings and loan crisis, which has forced the government
to take over more than 400 failed institutions, are estimated at
around $250 billion.
   The connections among Silverado and other insolvent S&amp;Ls are
being examined. The others include Charles H. Keating Jr.'s Lincoln
Savings and Loan Association and the junk bond operation of former
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. financier Michael Milken.
   OTS has alleged that loans by Silverado to Neil Bush's business
partners, developers Kenneth Good and Bill Walters, represented a
conflict of interest for Bush, 34, who was a director of Silverado
from 1985 to August 1988. He resigned two weeks after his father
received the Republican presidential nomination.
   In January, regulators began disciplinary procedures against
Bush that could result in a lifetime ban from the financial
institutions industry. Bush, who has denied any wrongdoing, said
early this month he will cooperate with Congress, the OTS and any
other agencies involved.
   Examiners at the OTS have expressed concern about Silverado's
heavy investments in Colorado's ailing commercial real estate
market.
   They also have focused on what they said was ``an exceptionally
large number of problem transactions'' between Silverado insiders
and borrowers.
   Bush, who was a partner in an oil exploration firm, JNB
Exploration, had business deals with two of Silverado's major
borrowers, Good and Walters.
   Bush has said he did not benefit directly or indirectly from any
loan or transaction between Silverado and businesses controlled by
Walters, who had a 6.25 percent limited partnership interest in JNB
Exploration. Bush has said he voted in 1986 with the other
directors in unanimously approving the Walters loans brought to
them by management, because there was no conflict of interest under
federal banking laws or Colorado regulations.
   Good and Walters are scheduled to testify at Wednesday's hearing
along with Michael R. Wise, the former chairman of Silverado.
   Richard K. Vanderpool, Silverado's former vice chairman and
chief operating officer, also is expected to appear Wednesday,
along with Lewis and other former directors besides Bush.

   President Bush hinted to Republican leaders
today that he is ready to grant China a one-year extension of trade
benefits. Administration sources said announcement of such a move
would come this week.
   The expected decision to renew Beijing's most-favored-nation
status drew advance criticism from Democrats.
   Republican lawmakers who met with Bush at the White House said
the president left the clear impression he was ready to grant China
the extension.
   ``He indicated he would present that while Congress is still in
session this week,'' said Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo.
   Simpson and other GOP leaders said Bush made a strong case for
extending most-favored-nation treatment, arguing that to withdraw
preferential trade status would severely damage the free-market
economy of Hong Kong.
   Although he did not say exactly what he planned to do, Bush
demonstrated ``a tilt toward granting it. But he was seeking our
views,'' said Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I.
   Sen. William Armstrong, R-Colo., said: ``He gave us the
impression he would do it.''
   Bush was to meet with Democratic leaders on the subject on
Wednesday.
   White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk said a decision on the
issue would not be announced today.
   ``As far as I know, no decison has been taken'' on whether to
continue most-favored-nation trading status for China, he said.
   The spokesman said Bush might bring up the topic at today's
meeting with congressional Republicans. It is unlikely the White
House would announce such a move before Bush conferred with
congressional leaders.
   However, other officials, speaking on the condition of
anonymity, said the president was expected to notify Congress
formally of the move before the end of the week.
   In advance of a White House announcement, Senate Majority Leader
George Michell, D-Maine, today strongly criticized renewal of trade
benefits to China.
   ``Should we, by now giving the Chinese government what it wants,
passively adopt the Chinese government's casual dismissal of our
concerns?'' Mitchell said. ``I say we should not ... because it is
contrary to our principles, contrary to American interests and
wrong.''
   Mitchell said the Bush administration, by its actions, is
``sowing the seeds of disaster with respect to the next generation
of leaders in China.''
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., said he would withhold
comment on Bush's decision until one is actually announced. Foley
said he understood there were conditions attached to the status,
and he wanted to find out what those conditions are. ``I think it's
better to see what he recommends,'' he said.
   Bush was planning to make the extension provisional, based on
China's human-rights performance over the coming months, said the
officials.
   Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., who accompanied Bush on the flight,
said he did not expect Congress to react as negatively to the move
as it had last winter when Bush vetoed legislation extending the
visas of Chinese students.
   ``It's not as emotional an issue,'' Wilson said. ``Most people
in the nation don't even know what MFN is.''
   Most-favored-nation (MFN) trading status guarantees China the
same treatment as this nation's best trading partners, including
the lowest possible tariffs.
   This benefit has provided preferential tariffs for about $12
billion in Chinese products shipped to the United States each year,
mostly textiles and toys.
   Bush is required under law to act one way or another by June 3.
But sources said he would rather deal with the issue now than wait
until the deadline, one day before the first anniversary of China's
bloody repression of pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing's
Tiananmen Square.
   The president also would like to clear the boards of the
decision before the May 30-June 3 summit with Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the officials said.
   Although Bush has recently voiced disappointment with China's
failure to ease restrictions on dissidents, he considers depriving
China of most-favored-nation status a drastic step that could have
widespread trade implications, the officials said.
   Bush himself expressed reservations at a news conference last
week about stripping China of the trade benefits, in part out of
fear it would harm the economy of Hong Kong.
   Some $8.5 billion worth of China-made goods are re-exported to
the United States each year, passing through Hong Kong. Officials
of the enclave on the South coast of China claim revocation of
China's most-favored-nation status would make these goods subject
to tariffs of up to 70 percent.
   Some nations, including the Soviet Union, have been denied
most-favored-nation treatment because of their restrictive
human-rights policies.
   Congress can block Bush's decision, but it seems unlikely it
could muster the two-third majorities needed to do so.
   Bush, a former U.S. envoy to China, won a bruising veto battle
with Congress last winter on a bill that would have extended the
visas of Chinese students in the United States. Bush argued that he
was offering the Chinese students the same safe haven though
administrative actions.
   Previously, the Bush administration waived restrictions on U.S.
Export-Import Bank financing of business with China and granted
permission for Chinese rockets to launch three U.S.-built
satellites.

   Stock prices turned mixed at midday, as a key
blue-chip indicator gave up its strong early gains and drifted
slightly below its record closing level of the previous session.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which on Monday gained
24.77 points to post its fourth record high in the past six
sessions, was down 0.51 at 2,844.17 at noontime.
   The market's best-known barometer had been up nearly 26 points
after thr first half-hour of trading.
   Advancing issues continued to lead losers by a margin of about 4
to 3 in nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed
issues, with 774 up, 636 down and 473 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 115.07 million shares as of noon
on Wall Street compared with 75.55 million shares at the same point
Monday.
   Analysts said the market got a lift early today from declining
interest rates and a strong performance on stock markets in Tokyo
and London.
   But they said profit-taking eroded the early gains as the
session wore on.
   ``There was probably a little too much exuberance at the
beginning,'' said Newton D. Zinder, a market analyst for Shearson
Lehman Hutton.
   The stock market has rolled up some impressive gains over the
past three weeks in a rally that has been attributed mainly to
declines in interest rates.
   Declining rates help stocks by making their potential rewards
more appealing than the yields on fixed-income investments. Lower
rates also can improve the profit outlook for some companies by
cutting their borrowing costs.
   The credit markets provided a fresh lift this morning as rates
edged lower. Yields on 30-year Treasury bonds slipped toward 8.63
percent by midday from 8.68 percent late Monday.
   While some analysts foresee no imminent end to the stock
market's rally, others say a pullback is inevitable, particularly
if the Federal Reserve fails to take steps that would actively
encourage more rate declines.
   Among the active issues on the NYSE, American Telelphone &amp;
Telegraph was down &rsqb; at 43, Philip Morris gained &lsqb; to 44| and
American Express was up \ at 30\.
   Federal Express fell 5 to 47&lsqb; amid some apparent disappointment

<HEAD>Southmark Says San Jacinto Insolvent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Southmark Corp. says its San Jacinto Savings
Association unit is insolvent and won't be able to meet required
minimum capital levels despite plans to pump more than $100 million
in assets into the Houston savings and loan.
   The disclosure Monday in a federal Securities and Exchange
Commission filing raises new questions about Southmark's ability to
keep control of San Jacinto after Southmark emerges from Chapter 11
bankruptcy.
   The real estate and financial services company has proposed
selling all its remaining holdings except for San Jacinto, which
would be the centerpiece of a reorganized Southmark.
   Thrift president and chief executive Lawrence Connell said the
thrift is seeking to increase its capital, in part through the sale
of $200 million in real estate that is in negotiation or under
contract.
   The thrift also has asked regulators for a temporary reprieve
from the minimum capital standards and to delay any actions until
it can put its business plan into effect.
   San Jacinto, under regulatory oversight since 1988, is one of
the largest thrift institutions in the state that hasn't been sold
or seized by federal regulators.
   In the third quarter ended March 31, San Jacinto reported a loss
of $67.2 million, causing its shareholders' equity to fall to a
negative $50.8 million and making the institution insolvent for the
first time.
   ``It is expected that San Jacinto will experience further
increases in its capital deficit due to continuing operating
losses,'' Southmark noted.
   The parent company posted a loss of $58.5 million for the
quarter. It already had taken a $28.6 million charge in the quarter
ended Dec. 31 for possible loan losses at the thrift.
   In the third quarter of 1989, Southmark reported a record $1
billion loss caused by huge write-downs in the value of
Southmark-held real estate an by provisions for loan losses at San
Jacinto. That loss led to the company's filing for protection under
Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code in July.
   Before the filing, Southmark reached an agreement with the
Office of Thrift Supervision, which regulates the savings and loan
industry, permitting the company to continue to own the thrift
while in bankruptcy proceedings as long as it maintained minimum
capital levels.

   The U.S. dollar rose modestly Tuesday against
other major currencies, except for the Japanese yen and Swiss
franc, in European trading.
   Gold prices also were slightly higher.
   Currency dealers said the dollar got a boost from a combination
of technical factors and the weakness of the West German mark. The
market is feeling some jitters over a potential political row that
could develop in Bonn before the planned German unification, they
said.
   The dollar slid against the yen after a senior U.S. Treasury
official indicated a further weakening of the dollar would be
acceptable, although not necessarily a remedy to the U.S. trade
deficit.
   The dollar also was hit by comments earlier Tuesday by Swiss
National Bank Vice President Hans Meyer, who said the Swiss will
not loosen its monetary policy during the next six months.
   In Tokyo, where the global trading day begins, the dollar fell
to a closing 152.40 Japanese yen from 153.25 yen Monday. It closed
at 151.55 yen in London, and traded at 151.30 yen by midday in New
York.
   In London, the British pound fell to $1.6915 from $1.6917 late
Monday. By midday it was up to $1.69325.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Monday:
1.6685 West German marks, up from 1.6630; 1.4175 Swiss francs, down
from 1.4225; 5.6175 French francs, up from 5.6060; 1.8760 Dutch
guilders, up from 1.8692; 1,225.25 Italian lire, up from 1,222.75;
and 1.1907 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1793.
   Selected midday dollar rates in New York: 1.6695 West German
marks, 1.41685 Swiss francs, 1.18225 Canadian dollars and 1,225.25
Italian lire.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $375 a troy ounce
from $373.25 bid late Monday. In Zurich, gold rose to $375.35 an
ounce from $373.50.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold closed at $373.58 an ounce, down

<DATELINE>MOLINE, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Deere &amp; Co. reported Tuesday its
second-quarter earnings rose 10 percent as the tractor and farm
equipment manufacturer's sales increased and expenses were cut.
   Deere said it earned $144 million, or $1.90 a share, on revenue
of $2.12 billion, in the quarter ended April 30, compared with
earnings of $130.5 million, or $1.74 a share, on revenue of $1.92
billion in the same period a year earlier.
   ``The second quarter and year-to-date improvements are
attributable to our North American operations, resulting primarily
from increased sales, higher production volumes and improved
operating efficiency,'' retiring Deere Chairman Robert A. Hanson
said in a joint statement with Hans W. Becherer, chief executive
officer.
   Becherer is expected to succeed Hanson as chairman.
   Tractor and machinery sales accounted for $1.8 billion of
Deere's revenue in the second quarter while income from the
company's credit, insurance and health care operations was $237
million.
   For the first six months of the fiscal year, Deere's earnings
totaled $222.5 million, or $2.94 per share, on revenue of $3.76
billion, up 24 percent from $178.9 million, or $2.39 per share, on
revenue of $3.29 billion, in the first half of 1989.
   Deere is building on momentum that began in 1988 as the company
piled up record earnings of $315.4 million after suffering $637
million in operating losses in 1982-87.

<HEAD>Sock Shop Closes Half Its British Stores</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sock Shop International PLC will close 58 stores,
more than half its British outlets, to try to save the business,
its administrators announced Tuesday.
   The company closed its 17 U.S. stores in December.
   The closure of 58 British stores out of 109 will mean 150 job
losses, the administrators said.
   ``It has been a tough time for the employees of Sock Shop,''
said administrator Peter DuBuisson.
   ``I believe the steps we are now taking to rationalize the
company will improve its profitability and reward everyone's
efforts to save Sock Shop,'' he said.
   DuBuisson and Phillip Sykes, accountants with the firm BDO
Binder Hamlyn, were called in three months ago. Last week, a court
gave them another three months to find a solution to propose to the
company's creditors.
   The administrators are looking for new investors to bail out the
company, which was founded in 1982 by a former typist, Sophie
Mirman, and her husband Richard Ross.
   The company has blamed its problems on last year's hot summer
and transport strikes, which discouraged sales. Many Sock Shops are
at train and subway stations.
   Heavy debts incurred through rapid expansion also took their
toll as interest rates climbed.
   Miss Mirman opened her first Sock Shop at London's Knightsbridge
subway station near the Harrods department store. The company
prospered during the free-spending 1980s with passers-by dropping
in on a whim for a handful of tights or socks.
   Sock Shop's expansion to the United States failed, because of
high rents and security costs.
   In February, the company posted a six-month loss of 2.9 million
pounds, or $4.9 million.

   Strong buying interest propelled shares sharply
higher in active trading on London's Stock Exchange Tuesday, but
the main index closed well below its session high.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed up
29.2 points, or 1.3 percent, at 2,311.3. Its session peak was
2,332.7.
   Volume soared to 629.7 million shares from 316.2 million shares
Monday.
   Markups pushed equity prices upward early in the session. But
they failed to lure fresh buyers and the 100-share index retreated
below 2,300.0. That, in turn, triggered an influx of institutional
investors, said one trader at a major U.K. brokerage.
   Dealers were split as to what caused the market to retreat from
its 50.6-point advance, with one suggesting a combination of
profit-taking and sentiment that the market was overbought.

   The government and the ruling party on Tuesday
adopted a new economic policy guideline aimed at meeting promises
made in recent trade talks with the United States.
   The new guideline calls for opening Japan's markets to more
foreign goods, making fiscal and budgetary policy changes to
conform with other trading partners, and increasing foreign aid.
   ``We must push forward the adjustment of Japan's economic
structure in order to improve the nation's standard of living and
promote consumer benefits in accordance with world economic
growth,'' said a government statement.
   The policy was adopted by the Government-LDP Economic Structural
Adjustment Board, which consists of bureaucrats and lawmakers from
the governing Liberal Democratic Party.
   It marks a major revision in the direction suggested for Japan's
economy.
   A 1986 guideline, known as the Maekawa Report, urged a drastic
shift from heavy reliance on exports to increased domestic demand
to reduce the country's trade surpluses.
   In recent months, however, a number of government and LDP panels
have called for less emphasis on expanding domestic demand and more
on international cooperation and benefits for Japanese consumers,
who now pay some of the world's highest prices.
   The new guideline suggests that Japan's economy already has been
transformed to a domestic orientation and notes that its trade
surplus has been decreasing.
   ``For us to assume a role and responsibilities compatible with
our position in the international community, ... it is an extremely
important theme for Japan to promote the adjustment of our economy
to a more internationally cooperative style,'' it said.
   In addition to improved living standards, the guideline calls
for shorter working hours and longer vacations.
   In its interim report on the U.S.-Japan Structural Impediment
Initiative talks, released in April, Tokyo promised to streamline
its complicated distribution system, tighten the anti-monopoly law
and increase government spending on public works to help improve
the nation's standard of living.
   The report said such measures would lead to a reduction of
Japan's $49 billion surplus in trade with the United States.
   The new guideline, like the trade report, calls for easing the
Large Scale Store Law, which U.S. trade negotiators say makes it
hard for foreign stores to open outlets in Japan.

   A dispute over how fast Japan will liberalize
interest rates on deposits could make banking the next area of
trade tensions in coming months, a senior U.S. official said
Tuesday.
   After two days of talks with Japanese officials on financial
reforms, U.S. Undersecretary of the Treasury David C. Mulford said
Japan's refusal to finish deregulating interest rates within one
year was beginning to ``look more and more like a trade problem.''
   ``The deregulation process for interest rates is the key to all
other liberalization and it is necessary for developing a money
market policy,'' Mulford said.
   He said that after seven years of step-by-step transition, U.S.
officials would like the process of deregulation to be wrapped up
within a year.
   The talks led by Mulford and his Japanese counterpart, Vice
Minister of Finance Makoto Utsumi, were the eighth in a series of
discussions on reforming the two countries' financial markets.
   Separately, the Japanese government and ruling party on Tuesday
adopted a new economic policy guideline aimed at meeting other
promises made in recent trade talks with the United States.
   The new guideline calls for opening Japan's markets to more
foreign goods, making fiscal and budgetary policy changes to
conform with other trading partners, and increasing foreign aid.
   On the interest-rate front, U.S. officials charge that Japanese
financial firms take advantage of open markets overseas while
receiving government protection from foreign competition at home.
   While interest rates for money market certificates and large-lot
time deposits have been partially liberalized since 1984, when the
bilateral talks began, the ceilings on rates for demand deposits
and smaller time deposits remain low. Time deposits account for
about three-quarters of total bank deposits here, according to
industry estimates.
   Utsumi said Japanese officials agreed on the need to completely
liberalize interest rates, but disagreed on timing.
   He bluntly disagreed with U.S. charges that interest rate
controls were being retained to give Japanese banks a source of
artificially cheap capital for loans and other investments,
enabling them to expand their presence overseas.
   ``To avoid foreign exchange exposure ... loans overseas are made
with funds in the same currency the loans are denominated in,''
Utsumi said.
   Utsumi declined to explain why Japan would not specify a
timetable for its plans and refused to comment on reports that
interest rate ceilings would be lifted by 1993.
   Mulford said the failure to produce a timetable was likely to
fuel protectionist moves in Congress.
   Foreign banks' share in total bank deposits in Japan has risen
only from 0.9 percent in 1983 to 1.04 percent in 1988, while their
share of loans has fallen from 3.57 percent to 1.88 percent, the
Bank of Japan says.
   Japan's share in the U.S. lending market, meanwhile, has grown
from 7.4 percent in 1983 to 14 percent in 1989.
   The Treasury Department is required by law to report to Congress
by Dec. 1 on whether Japan and other countries have given U.S.
banks and brokerages the same access they receive in American
financial markets.
   The Fair Trade and Financial Services Act being considered in
Congress calls for retaliatory action against foreign financial
firms in the United States if their own governments do not give
U.S. companies reciprocal treatment.
   ``As of today, it will not be possible for the U.S. Treasury to
give a positive report on the Japanese market,'' Mulford said.
   Analysts say the Finance Ministry faces strong opposition to
interest rate deregulation from small and medium-size banks already
facing difficulties due to higher interest rates and limited
liberalization.
   Japan's central bank has raised its key rate for loans to
commercial banks from 2.5 percent to 5.25 percent in the past year.
In turn, commercial banks' prime lending rates jumped from about
5.5 percent to 7.2 percent.
   Finance Ministry officials did promise to approve new foreign
exchange-related and securitized financial products and allow
foreign securities firms to establish banking facilities to handle
foreign exchange services, Mulford said.
   The Japanese also pledged to approve the use of the Globex
trading system by the end of June. Globex is a global electronic
automated system for the trading of futures and futures options
jointly operated by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and Reuters
Holdings PLC.
   ``But we still see most of these improvements as only
intermediate steps which fail to lead to complete financial market
liberalization,'' he said.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dayton Hudson Corp. reported Tuesday its
first-quarter earnings rose 60 percent on higher revenue and a
one-time gain from an accounting change.
   The Minneapolis-based retailer said it earned $64 million, or 81
cents per share, in the quarter ended May 5, compared with $40
million, or 51 cents per share, a year earlier.
   The results reflected a $54 million gain from an accounting
change, and $48 million in costs for employee retirement health

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>

   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly
lower Tuesday on the Chicago Board of Trade although new-crop corn
futures rose slightly amid persistent fears about rain-delayed corn
planting in the Midwest.
   Wheat futures retreated modestly despite the Agriculture
Department's announcement that China bought nearly 400,000 metric
tons of U.S. wheat at subsidized prices, and despite a USDA offer
to subsidize sales of 2 million metric tons of wheat to Algeria.
   Joel Karlin, an analyst with Research Department Inc. in
Chicago, said wheat traders fear the Bush administration may not
renew China's favorable trade status, which could result in fewer
grain sales to China.
   He said the wheat offer to Algeria had little market impact
because foreign buyers are likely to wait another month or two, if
they can, for the cheaper prices that will accompany the U.S.
winter wheat harthe remedies disabled workers could seek from employers
who willfully discriminate. The White House supported that
amendment.
   Among key provisions of the bill:
   _Discrimination in hiring and on the job would be prohibited.
The requirement would be phased in over two to four years,
depending on the size of the company. Companies with fewer than 15
employees would be exempt.
   _Hotels, restaurants, shopping malls, drug stores, and business
and professional offices, along with any other ``public
accommodation,'' would have to make themselves accessible to
disabled people. Accessibility includes structural adjustments,
such as wheelchair ramps and widened doors, and services.
   _Transportation, public and private, would have to be made
accessible. Fixed-route bus systems would have to be accessible for
people with wheelchairs. Special facilities would be available for
people with other disabilities who cannot use regular transit.
Amtrak, Greyhound, and commuter rail systems are covered.
Timetables for implementation vary according to system.
   _ People with speech and hearing impairments would have access
to telephone service by means of relay services. These services
would have to be provided by phone companies within three years.

<HEAD>Obstacles Remain For Investing in Soviet Union, U.S. Official Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN FRIEDMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union could become the hottest growth
market of the 21st century, but serious impediments remain for
exporters and investors, U.S. officials told hundreds of American
and Soviet business leaders Tuesday.
   The leaders of the U.S.-U.S.S.R. Trade and Economic Council
spoke optimistically at their 13th annual meeting that political
barriers to better business relations between the two nations
finally were being swept away.
   However, U.S. Ambassador Jack Matlock said the Kremlin's
economic embargo of Lithuania will make it difficult to get the
U.S. Congress to approve a bilateral commercial agreement.
   The failing Soviet economy and Mikhail S. Gorbachev's plans to
introduce desperately needed market reforms kept surfacing at the
session.
   ``We understand that political freedom must be accompanied by
meat on the table,'' said Alaska Gov. Steve Cowper, addressing the
meeting on his state's recent cooperation with the Soviet Union.
``For perestroika to work, the Soviet economic system has to work.''
   Thomas J. Duesterburg, assistant secretary of commerce for
International Economic Policy, told the 500 American members and
like number of Soviets that Gorbachev and other Kremlin leaders
``have had the courage to face these facts and to begin a massive
restructuring program in the Soviet Union to take it away from the
policies that have brought it to the brink of economic ruin.''
   ``If democratization and a movement toward a market economy
continues, the U.S.S.R. could certainly be `the' growth market of
the 21st century,'' he said.
   But he said key obstacles remain. The Soviet ruble is not
convertible, and foreign enterprises have not been fully integrated
into the economy.
   The Soviets still try to contain and control foreign investment
as a compartmentalized part of the economy. Basic factors such as
market information, advertising, the ability to hire and fire local
staff and the ability to communicate with potential customers and
partners are needed to overcome this obstacle, Duesterburg said.
   Of the more than 1,400 joint-venture agreements registered in
the Soviet Union, 140 involve U.S. firms. Less than 15 percent of
all foreign joint ventures are operational, with most being small,
service-oriented enterprises rather than manufacturing concerns.
The average capitalization of these is less than $2 million.
   Council Chairman John J. Murphy, the chairman, president and
chief executive officer of Dresser Industries, Inc., was
nevertheless upbeat about the Soviet market.
   He said the upcoming summit between Gorbachev and U.S. President
George Bush was a cause for optimism. He also said he was confident
of a waiver of the Jackson-Vanik Amendment, which for years has
denied the Soviets most-favored-nation status, to punish them for
preventing free emigration.
   ``This will provide Soviet manufacturers with the opportunity to
test their competitors in the largest and toughest market in the
world,'' he said, referring to the United States.
   ``We also anticipate signing of the bilateral trade agreement,
providing the means for two-way trade to reach world-scale
dimensions for the first time in a long time,'' Murphy added.
   Co-chairman Vladislav L. Malkevich, head of the Soviet Chamber
of Commerce, expressed the hope that political motives won't hurt
U.S.-Soviet business relations.
   ``I hope that a trade agreement will not become an instrument of
any political gain, like what happened in the past,'' he said.
   But Matlock, while saying that the political climate was
improving, could not ease Malkevich's fears.
   He mentioned the economic embargo imposed by Gorbachev to punish
Lithuania for its independence moves and said that under those
circumstances, ``whatever we do in our negotiations, it's going to
be probably very difficult and maybe impossible to persuade the
American Congress to let a commercial agreement go into effect.''
   Also at the meeting, a several new joint ventures were signed
between U.S. and Soviet companies. Among them:
   _The American Medical Consortium, consisting of Pfizer
International Inc., Colgate Palmolive Inc., Hewlett-Packard Co.,
Hospital Corp. International, Medical Service Partners and Federal
Express, signed a contract to develop joint ventures. Its first
will be a factory, located in Kazan, to produce medical, surgical
and dental instruments and disposable syringes. About 20 percent of
its production is to be exported for hard currency.
   _Raddisson Hotels International and Americom International Corp.
signed an agreement with Intourist and the Committee for Foreign
Tourism to build and operate the first American hotel and the first
American-managed business center in Moscow.
   _The Coca-Cola Co. formally received the right to open a
permanent representation office in Moscow.
   _Federal Express announced the introduction of outbound air
express service from Moscow. Service from the United States and
Europe to Moscow began in April.

   Stock prices drifted lower this afternoon, as a
key blue-chip indicator dipped below its record closing level of
the previous session.
   Trading was fairly active.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which on Monday gained
24.77 points to post its fourth record high in the past six
sessions, was down 4.78 at 2,839.90 with one hour left in the
session.
   The market's best-known barometer had been up nearly 26 points
after the first half-hour of trading, but gave up those gains by
noontime.
   Declining issues held a narrow lead over gainers in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 714 up, 776
down and 486 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 175.55 million shares as of 3
p.m. on Wall Street compared with 141.19 million shares at the same
point Monday.
   Analysts said the market got a lift early today from declining
interest rates and a strong performance on stock markets in Tokyo
and London.
   But they said profit-taking eroded the early rise as the session
wore on.
   The stock market has rolled up some impressive gains over the
past three weeks in a rally that has been attributed mainly to
declines in interest rates.
   The credit markets provided a fresh lift today as rates edged
lower. Yields on 30-year Treasury bonds slipped toward 8.60 percent
by midafternoon from 8.68 percent late Monday.
   While some analysts foresee no imminent end to the stock
market's rally, others say a pullback is inevitable, particularly
if the Federal Reserve fails to take steps that would actively
encourage more rate declines.
   Among widely-held issues on the NYSE, American Telephone &amp;
Telegraph was down | at 42}, Philip Morris was unchanged at 44{ and
American Express was off &rsqb; at 29|.
   Federal Express fell 5&rsqb; to 46} amid some apparent disappointment
over April volume figures released late Monday.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was
down 0.52 at 194.76. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index fell 0.23 to 359.13.

<HEAD>Says Cable TV Must Have More Competition</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC RICE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal Communications Commission Chairman Alfred
Sikes told cable television executives Tuesday that an era of
increased competition is imminent in their industry.
   The head of an industry association said, however, that he still
believes Washington will avoid drastic regulatory changes.
   Sikes told a meeting of the National Cable Television
Association that it should accept government action to open the
marketplace. The cable industry has been deregulated since 1984,
though both Congress and the FCC currently are considering steps to
reimpose some regulation.
   ``You cannot expect government to continue sanctioning, indeed,
protecting and promoting cable as a sole-source provider of video
services while at the same time foregoing the regulation that
historically has been placed on monopoly operations,'' Sikes said.
   ``The American people, in short, will not tolerate an
unregulated monopoly indefinitely.''
   Though cable TV has soared in popularity over the last decade _
it is now received in 57.1 percent of all U.S. homes with
television _ the industry has been beset recently by complaints
from consumers about poor service and rising rates.
   Sikes said that during a visit last week to his home state of
Missouri, he was besieged by questions _ from people who usually
care little about FCC issues _ regarding cable TV.
   The FCC is scheduled to take up cable issues at its July 26
meeting.
   NCTA President James P. Mooney, whose association is holding its
annual convention this week in Atlanta, said following Sikes'
speech that the FCC chairman shed little new light for him on the
cable regulation issue.
   Mooney said he stood by his earlier assessment that he expects
the FCC or Congress this year to modify regulatory policies for
cable but that the changes will not be drastic.
   ``I think we can say today it looks highly likely that Congress
will support a moderate cable policy,'' Mooney told the NCTA
gathering Monday.
   Sikes said he is going into the July 26 meeting supporting
regulatory approaches ``which foster growth and diversity and, as a
result, far less need for potentially debilitating government
intervention.''
   If the cable industry resists opening the marketplace, it could
finditself in a utility-style regulatory environment that would
inhibit entrepreneurs, Sikes said.
   Sikes also told the group he would support allowing cable to
compete in other communications markets, such as telephone and
other carrier-related services.
   ``If video service markets were effectively competitive, I can
see few compelling public policy reasons for placing constraints on
any of the participants, including cable,'' he said.

<HEAD>American To Take Over Latin Routes In Phases</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   American Airlines will take over Eastern Airlines'
Latin American routes in four phases beginning June 30, Eastern
said Wednesday.
   ``It just provided for the smoothest transition possible,''
Eastern spokesman Robin Matell said of the agreement, under which
both airlines will fly to some Latin countries _ not at the same
time _ from June 30 until Aug. 14.
   Eastern and parent Texas Air Corp. dealt the Latin American
routes to American as part of Eastern's effort to emerge from
Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization.
   Matell said the $349 million amount Eastern would receive under
the original agreement is down to $310 milliion.
   He said the initial transaction price was reduced by $14 million
because the U.S. Department of Transportation expects a route
hearing challenging the transfer of Eastern's Miami-Toronto and
Tampa-Toronto authorities.
   Another $25 million involves Eastern's routes to Puerto Rico.
Matell declined to elaborate on the status of the Puerto Rican
routes.
   The first sale to close on June 30 will cover Brazil, Argentina,
Chile, Guatemala and Costa Rica, followed July 20 with Panama,
Peru, Bolivia and Paraguay.
   Colombia and Ecuador will follow July 31. The transfer of Latin
routes will be completed Aug. 14 with Belize, Honduras, El Salvador
and Venezuela.
   The schedule provides that Eastern will receive the bulk of the
$310 million in July, and the balance Aug. 14, Eastern said.

   Monsanto Chemical Co. and Exxon Chemical Co.
said Tuesday they would merge their businesses in industrial rubber
products called TPEs.
   The enterprise would combine Monsanto's technical, manufacturing
and marketing expertise with Exxon Chemical's expertise in
olefin-based raw materials and fundamental polymer science, the
companies said in a joint statement.
   The material, known as thermoplastic elastomers or TPEs, is a
rubberlike substance that, unlike the conventional vulcanized
rubber, can be easily processed and recycled. TPEs are used in
engineered industrial rubber and soft plastic applications in the
automotive, medical, food, electrical, construction, appliance and
business machine industries.
   Monsanto spokesman Carl Moskowitz said no dollar value has yet
been placed on the venture, but he said sales are expected to top
$100 million in 1990. And he said he expected the 30 to 35 percent
annual growth in TPEs sales experienced by Monsanto to continue
with the new company.
   Moskowitz said the new company, which has not yet been given a
name, is to be headquartered in St. Louis. He said it will be free
standing and will have its own officers and board of directors.

<DATELINE>TROY, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   K mart Corp. shareholders, seeking a greater
role in the governance of the nation's second-largest retailer,
asked Tuesday that management give them a chance to vote on the
firm's ``poison pill'' anti-takeover defense.
   A request that the K mart board submit the pill to a shareholder
ballot was approved by a vote of 83.6 million shares to 64.1
million at the company's annual meeting.
   One of K mart's biggest shareholders, the State of Wisconsin
Investment Board, said it does not necessarily oppose the defensive
measure adopted by the K mart board of directors in May 1988.
   But such moves have enough impact on shareholders' interests
that they should be submitted to a shareholder vote, investment
board spokeswoman Betty Kepley said at the meeting.
   K mart's by-laws do not require that the plan win shareholder
approval. The pill makes the cost of a hostile takeover
prohibitively expensive by allowing the board to issue extra stock
at a steep discount.
   With their vote Tuesday, K mart shareholders joined stockholders
in other companies who are seeking a greater voice in corporate
governance. Institutional shareholders like the Wisconsin
investment board, are among the leaders in the growing shareholder
rights movement.
   K mart Chairman Joseph E. Antonini said he would take the
proposal before the board, although he said the request was
advisory and does not compel board action.
   The retailer has not encountered any hostile takeover bids but
adopted the measure because ``that's the way the wind was
blowing,'' Antonini said at a news conference after the meeting.
   At the meeting, shareholders elected a slate of board-backed
directors including Antonini. They defeated two other stockholder
proposals, for confidentiality and third-party tabulation of
shareholder votes, and for the annual election of the entire board
of directors.
   Antonini told shareholders K mart's 6.4 percent increase in
first-quarter income and 16.1 percent increase in sales were
``slightly above plan.''
   K mart, the nation's No. 2 retailer after Sears, Roebuck and
Co., operates the K mart discount chain as well as Waldenbooks,
Payless Drug, Builder's Square, PACE membership warehouse and
Sports Authority stores.

<TEXT>
   The dollar gained ground Tuesday against most
other currencies, particularly the West German mark, which remained
under pressure as a result of growing political discord over that
country's plans to reunite with East Germany.
   Gold prices ended higher in New York and in Europe after falling
in Asia.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery settled at $375.60 a troy ounce, up $2.30 from late
Monday. Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late bid for
gold at $374.50 an ounce, up $2.15.
   Currency dealers said the dollar benefited from continued
weakness in the West German mark amid growing concern about the
future of the reunification plan.
   On Tuesday, Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government turned down the
opposition Social Democrats' demand for alterations in a newly
signed treaty on economic unity with East Germany. The Social
Democrats maintain the new treaty fails to provide enough
protection for East German workers and businesses.
   The dollar rose in Europe to 1.6685 West German marks from
1.6630 marks Monday, and to 1.67315 marks in New York from 1.66245.
   The dollar's value declined against the yen. In Tokyo, where the
global trading day begins, the dollar closed at 152.40 yen, down
from 153.25 yen Monday. It traded lower at 151.55 yen in London,
and 151.25 yen in New York, down from 153.73 yen.
   Dealers attributed the dollar's drop against the yen largely to
comments from Treasury Undersecretary David Mulford indicating that
a further weakening of the dollar would be acceptable, although not
necessarily a remedy to the U.S. trade deficit.
   The dollar was mixed against the British pound compared with
Monday. Sterling bought $1.6915 in London, down from $1.6917, and
$1.6930 in New York, up from $1.6875.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's
quotes, included: 1.41765 Swiss francs, down from 1.4217; 5.6300
French francs, up from 5.6020; 1,228.00 Italian lire, up from
1,222.50; and 1.18735 Canadian dollars, up from 1.17715.
   Late dollar rates in Europe compared with Monday: 1.4175 Swiss
francs, down from 1.4225; 5.6175 French francs, up from 5.6060;
1.8760 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8692; 1,225.25 Italian lire, up
from 1,222.75; and 1.1907 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1793.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $375 an ounce from
$373.25 late Monday. In Zurich, gold rose to $375.35 an ounce from
$373.50.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold closed at $373.58 an ounce, down
from $374.08.
   Silver prices increased. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for
current delivery settled at $5.283 a troy ounce, up from $5.131
Monday. Silver rose in London to $5.19 an ounce from $5.14 Monday.

   Energy futures prices settled mixed Tuesday as
the market was moved by largely technical factors.
   The June contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude oil, fell sharply in New York Mercantile
Exchange trading because it was expiring at the end of the session.
   The contract tumbled 58 cents to close at $17.68 a 42-gallon
barrel. The July contract for crude fell 12 cents, the August
contract edged 1 cent lower but subsequent months advanced.
   Prices for refined products traded on the exchange also were
mixed.
   Unleaded regular gasoline for delivery in June fell 0.31 cent to
63.04 cents a gallon. The July contract also slipped lower, but
later months closed higher.
   The June contract for home heating oil was off 0.04 cent to
51.40 cents a gallon. The July and August contracts closed higher,
but the following months settled lower.
   Analysts said there were no news developments to affect trading.
   ``The market is moving under its own steam,'' said Peter Beutel,
assistant director of the energy group at Elders Futures Inc.,
referring to investors adjusting their positions ahead of the June
WTI contract's expiration.
   However, Beutel said, traders also remained pessimistic about
the chances for reducing the current oversupply of oil. ``The
perceptions are that OPEC is not going to be able to live up to its
agreement'' to cut production, he said.
   Members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries
recently agreed to production cuts, but the cartel's output has not
fallen enough to move oil prices higher.
   In natural gas trading, the July contract fell to $1.613 per
1,000 cubic feet from $1.620 on Monday.

   Fresh declines in interest rates and a late
buying surge helped the stock market extend its spring rally on
Tuesday, propelling the Dow Jones industrial average to its fifth
record high in seven sessions.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which climbed 24.77
points to an all-time high on Monday, gained 7.55 points to set
another record at 2,852.23.
   Chances for another advance were in some doubt at midday as
profit-taking eroded a strong early rally but buyers appeared in
the last 30 minutes of trading to give the market a lift.
   Advancing issues outnumbered losers by about 8 to 7 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
816 up, 689 down and 501 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 203.35 million
shares, up from 166.28 million in the previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 242.36 million shares.
   The market got an early lift from declining interest rates and a
strong performance on stock markets in Tokyo and London.
   After the market opened, the Dow Jones industrials surged nearly
26 points higher in the first half-hour of trading before the rally
stalled.
   By noontime, the Dow Jones industrial average was slightly below
Monday's closing level and it drifted in negative territory for
most of the afternoon.
   ``There was probably a little too much exuberance at the
beginning,'' said Newton D. Zinder, a market analyst for Shearson
Lehman Hutton.
   Bill Raftery, vice president for technical research at Smith
Barney &amp; Co., added at midday, ``This is perfectly normal
profit-taking.''
   The stock market has rolled up some impressive gains over the
past three weeks in a rally that has been attributed mainly to
declines in interest rates.
   Declining rates help stocks by making the potential rewards on
stocks more appealing than yields on fixed-income investments.
Lower rates also can improve the profit outlook for some companies
by cutting their borrowing costs.
   In the credit markets Tuesday, yields on 30-year Treasury bonds
slipped toward 8.61 percent from 8.68 percent late Monday.
   Nonetheless, some market watchers expect a correction in the
stock market that will drive prices lower.
   But even small declines in stock prices appeared to draw out
buying interest in the last 30 minutes of the session, lifting the
market higher.
   ``It shows that even modest price discounts are being met by
anxious buyers who have missed this three-week old rally and short
sellers,'' said Alfred E. Goldman, director of technical market
analysis at A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons Inc. in St. Louis.
   Short-sellers are traders who establish positions based on the
presumption that prices will fall; they are often drawn into the
market as buyers when it becomes clear they have bet wrong and have
to settle their accounts.
   The most actively-traded issue on the NYSE was Nova Corp. of
Alberta, Canada which fell &rsqb; to 7 following a {-point gain in
similarly active dealings on Monday. The company had said Monday it
was selling its rubber division.
   Computer Associates International fell &rsqb; to 15{ after reporting
earnings results that disappointed some analysts.
   Among widely-held stocks, Philip Morris rose { to 45, American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph lost \ to 43&lsqb; and International Business
Machines rose } to 117}.
   Federal Express tumbled 5&lsqb; to 47 amid some apparent
disappointment over April volume figures released late Monday.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market rose $7.036 billion, or 0.21
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
0.30 to 195.58.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index rose 0.97 to 418.20, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index gained 0.43 to 358.43.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market rose
1.00 to 453.89. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 359.85, up 0.49.

   Retail sales in America's shopping centers
reached a record $676 billion in 1989, a 7.8 percent increase over
1988, according to an industry report released Tuesday.
   Figures from the International Council of Shopping Centers shows
there were 34,683 shopping centers in the country at the end of the
year, accounting for more than 55 percent of all non-automotive
retailing. The number represents an increase of 2,120 centers in
the past year.
   But shopping center construction starts were down in 1989, with
1,529 new centers started compared to 1,951 in 1988.
   Center construction amounted to $7.4 billion and generated
123,000 jobs in construction-related industries.
   Retail sales at the centers generated $25.9 billion in state
sales taxes, the ICSC reported.
   The centers provided employment for 9.9 million Americans _ one
out of every 10 non-agricultural jobs.
   California showed the greatest number of shopping centers, with
a total of 4,246 centers. Florida ranked second with 2,715,
followed by Texas with 2,683.
   California led in retail sales with $81.6 billion, and in sales
tax revenue with $2.9 billion.
   The figures were released during the annual ICSC convention,
being held this week in Las Vegas. The ICSC represents some 29,000
shopping center industry trade members in 42 countries.

<HEAD>Senate Approves Return to Private Banking</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRIS ANGELO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Asssociated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate on Monday approved a
constitutional change that will allow the return of private
commercial banking, the government news agency Notimex said.
   The reform repeals the 1982 nationalization of the banking
system. It eliminates a paragraph in the Constitution that reserved
ownership of banking and credit services for the government.
   Proposed May 2 by President Carlos Salinas de Gortari and passed
earlier by the Chamber of Deputies, the legislation will be sent to
the country's 31 states. Approval by 16 of the state legislatures
is required.
   The reform passed the Senate on a 52-2 vote.
   In the 90-minute debate, two senators from the leftist
Democratic Revolutionary Party opposed the bill, arguing that it
runs counter to national interests and will concentrate economic
power in the hands of a few.
   Sen. Alfonso Martinez Dominguez of the ruling Institutional
Revolutionary Party, which holds all but four of the 64 Senate
seats, responded that the reforms are in response to world changes.
   Under the change, up to 100 percent private ownership will be
allowed in the 18 commercial banks affected, but Salinas has said
the government would retain stock in some commercial banks. The
government also will keep numerous banks and other institutions
that provide farm and development loans and other specialized
services.
   When then-President Jose Lopez Portillo nationalized the banking
system in September 1982 as he neared the end of his term, he
claimed the banks were helping Mexicans send money out of the
country, sinking the economy deeper into recession.
   In proposing the return to private banking, Salinas said the
country has made sweeping changes in development policies and
economic structure to emerge from the economic crisis.
   Since Salinas took office in December 1988, hundreds of
state-owned businesses and industries have been closed or put up
for sale to private interests, the country's once-heavily protected
domestic markets have been opened up to foreign competition and
doors have been reopened to foreign investment.
   Also on Monday, a Senate report recommended Mexico negotiate a
free trade agreement with the United States, its largest trading
partner, give high priority to trade with the Pacific Basic
countries and review agreements with Japan to include new forms of
cooperation and investment.

<HEAD>News Corp.'s Harper Collins Unit Agrees To Sell J.B. Lippincott</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of the nation's leading medical publishers,
J.B. Lippincott Co., is being sold by News Corp. Ltd.'s book
publishing affiliate to a Dutch publisher for more than $250
million.
   News Corp.'s Harper Collins affiliate said Monday it reached a
definitive agreement to sell the Philadelphia-based Lippincott in
an effort to reduce its $800 million debt and to focus on
educational, religious and general books.
   The buyer is Wolters Kluwer NV, a publisher of professional,
scientific and educational materials that is based in Amsterdam.
   Harper Collins announced plans to sell Lippincott and some other
assets mainly in Australia a month ago. It said it hoped to raise a
total of $500 million from the sales.
   Lippincott had revenue of about $100 million last year, and
company officials said the sale price amounted to about 20 times
its operating earnings. ``We felt it was a good price,'' said
Robert L. Biewen, group vice president for educational and
professional publishing at Harper Collins.
   The sale agreement followed an auction involving six bidders
over several days, Harper Collins said. It did not identify the
other bidders.
   The sale is expected to be completed by June 29 subject to
regulatory approval.
   Wolters Kluwer earned nearly $75 million on worldwide revenue of
$1 billion in 1989.
   Bruce Lenz, senior vice president at Wolters Kluwer US, said
Tuersaday that the acquisition of Lippincott should boost to 17
percent from 10 percent the share of the worldwide company's
revenues derived from the U.S. operations.
   Wolters Kluwer already is a major publisher for the medical
community through its Raven Press and Aspen Publishers companies.
   Lenz said the prospective new owners hope to increase
Lippincott's international sales. He said there are no plans to
change any of its operations and the company intends to maintain
Lippincott's base of operations in Philadelphia.
   Lippincott, founded in 1792, publishes a variety of materials
for students, doctors, nurses, dentists and other health care
professionals.
   Its Drug Facts and Comparisons publication is widely used by
American pharmacists. Its Gower Medical Publishing division
produces illustrated books for the medical profession.
   News Corp. bought Harper &amp; Row Publishers, which included
Lippincott, for $293 million in 1987. It subsequently bought
William Collins PLC of Great Britain for $700 million and last year
merged the two operations to form Harper Collins.
   Harper acquired the Zondervan religious publisher several years
ago and Harper Collins bought Scott Foresman &amp; Co., educational
publishers, last year.
   The sale of Lippincott comes as News Corp., which is headed by
Rupert Murdoch, has shifted its sights toward improving
profitability after a buying binge that has seen it accumulate an
estimated $6 billion in debt.
   On Monday, Murdoch vehemently denied a report in the trade
publictaion Advertising Age that said he was sounding out
prospective buyers for TV Guide magazine.
   News Corp. also owns about a dozen other magazines, TV stations,
the Fox TV network, the Twentieth Century Fox film company and
several newspapers and is starting a satellite TV service in Great
Britain.

<HEAD>Tentative Agreement Sent to Union Members</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cincinnati Bell Telephone Co. and the
Communications Workers of America said they reached a tentative
agreement on a contract affecting about 2,900 installers, linemen
and information operators.
   The three-year agreement reached Monday is being offered for
ratification by CWA locals 4400 and 4401.
   Cincinnati Bell spokeswoman Cyndy Cantoni said the contract
provides for a 7 percent wage increase over the life of the pact, a
profit-sharing plan that could add 9 percent in compensation during
the contract period, improvements in dental and vision insurance, a
savings plan and pension plan, and a basic prepaid legal plan.
   ``We think we have a `win-win' situation,'' said Charles
Schultze, Cincinnati Bell labor relations vice president. ``I
regret that we experienced a short work stoppage. I am pleased we
have a new agreement that adequately balances employee and company
concerns.''
   ``We always regret having to call a strike, but in this case it
worked the way it is supposed to,'' said CWA representative Dodie
Ditmar. ``Together we forged some creative solutions to problems we
were stuck on a week ago. All in all, we are pleased with the
results.''
   Members of the locals will conduct a joint meeting Tuesday and,
if they approve the contract, would report for work Wednesday.
   The union staged a rally at the company's downtown headquarters
Monday. Union leaders have said the strike was sparked by
Cincinnati Bell's insistence that union employees begin paying a
greater share of their health insurance costs, but the company had
not made any public comment about the issues in the dispute.
   Contract talks broke off May 13 when the two sides reached an
impasse. The workers' old contract expired that day.
   Cincinnati Bell serves about 580,000 customers in the Cincinnati
area and neighboring parts of northern Kentucky and southeastern
Indiana.
   About 1,000 Bell managers and administrators have been working
12-hour days and six-day weeks since the walkout began in an effort
to fill in for the striking employees.

<HEAD>Brokerage Reportedly Will Resume Index Arbitrage for Own Account</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. has announced it would
resume for its own accounts a form of program trading blamed for
worsening stock market volatility, a newspaper reported.
   Kidder said it believed it can avoid disrupting the market with
safeguards it is adopting, The New York Times said in an early
edition of Tuesday's newspaper.
   Kidder and other Wall Street brokerages stopped employing a type
of program trading known as index arbitrage after the stock market
plunged last October. The strategy seeks to profit from small
differences in prices between the stock and futures markets by
simultaneously buying and selling big baskets of stocks and stock
index futures.
   Kidder, a subsidiary of General Electric Co., said it wouldn't
use the strategy during times of high volatility.
   It also said it would require that stock sales would be made as
part of program trades only if the last trade on the New York Stock
Exchange took place at a higher price than the previous one, and
purchases would be made only if the last Big Board trade was done
at a lower price than previously.
   ``Whatever we do will be done more slowly and we will surely do
less than we would have done without the restrictions,'' Thomas F.
Ryan, executive managing director of Kidder, was quoted as saying.
   Although other brokerages have continued to conduct program
trades for clients, the only Wall Street firm to do so for its own
accounts has been Bear, Stearns &amp; Co.

<HEAD>Cocoa Futures Resume Climb On Ivory Coast Supply Fears</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Cocoa futures prices seesawed to new 14-month highs Tuesday on
New York's Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange amid mounting fears of
supply disruptions from the Ivory Coast, the world's largest cocoa
producer.
   On other commodity markets, precious metal futures rose; copper
advanced; grains and soybeans were mostly lower; energy futures
were mixed; and livestock and meat futures were mixed.
   Cocoa futures settled $39 to $45 higher with the contract for
delivery in July at $1,491 per ton, the highest settlement of a
near-month cocoa contract since March 15, 1989.
   Prices surged late in the session after a day of erratic price
movement that followed a drop of $31 in the July contract on Monday.
   Cocoa futures have soared more than $250 per ton in the last two
weeks as government workers in the Ivory Coast have staged a
variety of demonstrations, mainly protesting wages and living
conditions in the West African nation, whose economy has been
crippled by last year's collapse in cocoa and coffee prices.
   Protests Tuesday by firefighters in the capital city of Abidjian
followed demonstrations by the city's police force on Monday and by
elements of the army last week. Ivory Coast dockworkers have
threatened to strike June 5.
   ``It continues to be a very worrisome situation,'' said Arthur
Stevenson, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   Silver futures led the precious metals higher. Analysts said
there was no news to account for the surge of buying, but silver
has been underpinned recently by tightening supplies and stronger
world demand.
   Stephen Platt of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. cited plans by
photographic-equipment giants Kodak and Fuji Photo Film to build or
expand plants in Eastern Europe. Silver is used in photographic
film and film processing.
   Gold futures settled $1.90 to $2.30 higher on New York's
Commodity Exchange with June at $376.40 a troy ounce; silver was 15
cents to 15.2 cents higher with May at $5.283 a troy ounce.
   Platinum futures settled $3.20 to $3.80 higher on the New York
Mercantile Exchange with July at $504.90 a troy ounce.
   Energy futures ended mixed on the New York Merc ahead of the
American Petroleum Institute's weekly stocks report, which showed a
sharp rise in U.S. crude oil supplies.
   The API reported crude stocks up 4.4 million barrels in the
latest week compared with trade estimates of an increase of no more
than 4 million barrels. Gasoline and distillate stocks were within
expectations, as was a 0.8 percent increase in refinery activity.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 12 cents lower to 10
cents higher with July at $18.92 a barrel; heating oil futures
finished .15 cent lower to .12 cent higher with June at 51.40 cents
a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .31 cent lower to .65 cent higher
with June at 63.04 cents a gallon.
   The June crude contract expired at $17.68 a barrel, off 58 cents.
   Grain and soybean futures settled mixed on the Chicago Board of
Trade, with some new-crop corn and soybean contracts up slightly
amid fears that planting will be further delayed by rains expected
next week in the Midwest.
   Wheat futures settled 2\ cents to 3{ cents lower with July at
$3.34} a bushel; corn was 2\ cents lower to 1} cents higher with
July at $2.74} a bushel; oats were { cent lower across the board
with July at $1.50} a bushel; soybeans were 1} cents lower to \
cent higher with July at $6.09 a bushel.
   Cattle and hog futures slipped on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, reflecting perceptions that those markets have peaked
after strong rallies in recent weeks. Pork bellies advanced amid
speculation that a weekly exchange report would show a continued
decline in bellies stored in commercial freezers outside of Chicago.
   But the report showed a 630,000-pound increase, prompting
predictions of a lower opening Wednesday.
   Live cattle settled .15 cent to .45 cent lower with June at
74.37 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .15 cent to .45 cent lower
with May at 85.52 cents a pound; live hogs were .08 cent to .35
cent lower with June at 66.92 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .25 cent lower to 1.15 cents higher with May at 69.40 cents a
pound.

<TEXT>
   President Bush's son Neil voted as a board
member of a Colorado thrift to approve $106 million in loans to a
business associate who defaulted on the entire amount, a federal
regulator said Tuesday.
   Stephen Hershkowitz, deputy director of enforcement for the
Office of Thrift Supervision, revealed the amount of the loss after
a House Banking Committee member pressed him to testify on Neil
Bush's role in the collapse of Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan
Association of Denver.
   Bush, 34, was to testify Wednesday before the panel examining
the $1 billion collapse of the thrift in December 1988. He was a
director of Silverado from 1985 to August 1988, resigning two weeks
after his father received the Republican presidential nomination.
   Bush's attorney, James Nesland, did not return a telephone call
Tuesday seeking comment on Hershkowitz's testimony.
   Hershkowitz and other regulators testified Tuesday that
Silverado made inflated loans to developers who had to reinvest
part of the money in the thrift.
   Thrift regulators told the committee that under the ``quid pro
quo'' lending program at Silverado, developers received loans to
buy buildings at inflated values set by outside appraisers.
   The properties' values were inflated by $270 million to $300
million over market value, they said.
   In exchange, developers were required to use part of the loan
money to buy preferred stock in Silverado's holding company to
purchase an interest in a ``loan pool'' set up by the thrift.
   The pool, which contained both good and bad loans, totaled
around $1 billion or roughly 60 percent of Silverado's total loan
portfolio. Developers who bought shares in the loan pool received
interest generated by the performing loans in the pool.
   Examiners said Monday they believed this arrangement, set up in
August 1986, was unique in the S&amp;L industry.
   The panel of regulators told the banking committee that
Silverado's board of directors was a ``rubber stamp'' for
management. They also said insider abuse occurred at the thrift.
   Neil Bush had oil and gas business deals with two of Silverado's
major borrowers, developers Kenneth Good and Bill Walters.
Regulators have alleged that loans by Silverado to the two men were
a conflict of interest for Bush, who failed to disclose the
relationship to the board.
   Hershkowitz said Bush voted to approve loans to Walters, but did
not vote on loans to Good.
   Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill., pressed Hershkowitz on the loans
after the regulator testified that Bush's role was ``no different
than other outside directors'' in the collapse, except that he
voted on the Walter loans without the disclosure.
   ``Bush had information that would be relevant to other board
members and did not disclose it,'' said Hershkowitz.
   Hershkowitz said the loans to Walters totaled $106 million.
   ``Were any in default?'' asked Annunzio.
   ``All of them,'' Hershkowitz said.
   Hershkowitz said he didn't know how much of the money had been
recovered and that another agency, the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp., would have to sue to recover any losses.
   The collapse of Silverado, now operating as part of Columbia
Savings, the largest thrift in Colorado, is expected to cost U.S.
taxpayers as much as $1 billion. Total losses from the nationwide
savings and loan crisis, which has forced the government to take
over more than 400 failed institutions, are estimated at around
$250 billion.
   Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, chairman of the banking
committee, said he would ask the panel to subpoena Kermit Mowbray,
a former president of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Topeka, Kan.
Mowbray had been scheduled to testify at Tuesday's hearing but did
not appear.
   The committee also plans to issue subpoenas to other requested
witnesses who failed to show up, said a committee spokesman who
spoke on condition of anonymity. They are Good; Walters; Thomas
Thompson, former district director of OTS' Topeka office; Larry
Mizel, chief executive of MDC Holdings; and John R. Sullivan, chief
executive officer of SDC Land Partners.

<HEAD>Moody's Downgrades Credit Rating Of Nation's Largest Bank</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 2nd graf to CORRECT to debt sted credit downgraded.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Citicorp's credit rating was lowered Tuesday by
another major debt-rating service, which based its decision on
concerns about the quality of real estate and takeover loans at the
nation's largest bank.
   Moody's Investors Service Inc. said it downgraded a total of
$37.4 billion in debt of Citicorp, some of its subsidiaries and
debt that it guarantees. The announcement came nearly one month
after rival Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. took similar action.
   Both credit rating firms said they were largely concerned about
the effects of escalating problem real estate loans, particularly
in commerical developments, given what they called Citicorp's weak
earnings position and low capital levels.
   They also cited worries about Citicorp's large Third World debt
portfolio and loans to finance takeovers.
   Lower credit ratings for Citicorp is regarded as general sign of
weakness in the banking sector and makes it more expensive for the
bank to borrow money.
   Last month, Citicorp reported a 56 percent drop in first-quarter
earnings, mainly because of domestic real estate loan difficulties
in slumping regions that are expected to worsen this year.
   ``Although Citicorp's real estate portfolio is geographically
diverse and its underwriting standards appear to be sound, Moody's
believes that Citicorp is vulnerable to the deteriorating national
real estate market,'' Moody's said in a statement.
   A number of major banking institutions have seen their debt
ratings lowered recently by Moody's and S&amp;P because of similar
problems.
   Citicorp said it was disappointed by Moody's action but added
that it didn't expect the downgradings to significantly increase
overall funding costs.
   In a statement, Citicorp said it was confident ``the strength of
its core businesses and well-positioned global franchises will
continue to provide excellent returns and growth.''
   Although Citicorp's credit remains investment-grade quality, a
lower rating heightens a bank's borrowing costs by prompting
investors to demand higher interest to compensate for increased
risk. The ratings have no effect on customer deposits.
   The downgradings by Moody's included Citicorp's senior debt to
single-A-three from single-A-one, commercial paper to prime-two
from prime-one and Citibank's senior debt to single-A-one from
double-A-two.
   In additon, it said it lowered about $6.2 billion in structured
debt guaranteed by Citicorp and Citibank letters of credit.

<HEAD>Pinnacle West Rejects Fourth Offer From PacifiCorp</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pinnacle West Capital Corp. directors on Tuesday
rejected a $1.82 billion cash offer from PacifiCorp, saying the
Northwest utility giant didn't offer enough for the parent of
Arizona Public Service Co.
   It was the fourth time Pinnacle West directors have rejected a
PacifiCorp bid for the holding company itself or for its utility
subsidiary.
   Pinacle West Chairman Richard Snell said the board also turned
down a $500 million offer by the Salt River Project utility to buy
part of Arizona Public Service's service territory in the Phoenix
area.
   Snell said Salt River Project's offer, made Friday, was too low
based on the annual revenues from the 166,000 customers involved.
   Arizona Public Service is the flagship subsidiary of
Phoenix-based Pinnacle West and has been its only profitable
operation for two years.
   PacifiCorp, based in Portland, Ore., said last week its fourth
offer was its last. But in a statement after the rejection, Verl R.
Topham, PacifiCorp's executive vice president, said the company may
now make an offer to Pinnacle West's shareholders.
   ``Shareholders of Pinnacle West have been told by their
management not to expect dividends for at least the next three
years,'' Topham said. ``We believe shareholders ... see the
significant value of our offer and support the merger proposal.''
   PacifiCorp, which owns Pacific Power &amp; Light and Utah Power &amp;
Light, has begun an advertising campaign here to solicit support
from shareholders and Arizona Public Service ratepayers.
   Pinnacle West's annual meeting takes place here Wednesday. It
was expected to be raucous even before the takeover rejection.
After posting a $676 million loss from discontinued operations by
its former MeraBank subsidiary, Pinnacle West reported a $551.4
million net loss in 1989. Its common stock dividend was eliminated
in October.
   Snell said PacifiCorp's $21-per-share offer _ $8.25 higher than
the stock price at the time _ did not ``reflect the value of this
company.''
   Pinnacle West shares fell 12{ cents to close at $15.87{ Tuesday
in New York Stock Exchange trading. PacifiCorp shares fell 25 cents
to close at $21.75.
   ``More importantly, this is not the time for us to sell this
company,'' Snell added.
   He said it would take two to three years to win regulatory
approval for the Oregon company to acquire Pinnacle West, which
also owns the SunCor Development, El Dorado Investment and Malapai
Resources companies.
   Shareholders would not receive their money until approval was
won, Snell said, and by then, ``Pinnacle West's business strategies
will have significantly increased both equity and the intrinsic
value of the company.''
   Snell said an attempt by PacifiCorp to take over Pinnacle West
through stockholder proxies would lead to a long fight. He said his
company's outlook has grown increasingly more positive.
   He said Pinnacle West was close to selling Malapai Resources,
recently closed the sale of The Wigwam resort and anticipated a
turnaround in the Arizona economy.
   But the major factors supporting a rosier outlook are the
resolution of its ill-fated ownership of MeraBank, which lost more
than $400 million in two years before the government took it over
Jan. 31, and the prospect of better operations at the Palo Verde
nuclear generating plant, Snell said.
   Malfunctions have kept most of the $9.3 billion, three-reactor
power complex out of operation since March 1989.

   Proponents of a federal law that might make it
more difficult for victims of defective products to collect damages
overcame a major obstacle Tuesday when a key committee voted to
approve the proposal.
   Sen. Ernest Hollings, D-S.C., chairman of the Commerce, Science
and Transportation Committee, and consumer subcommittee chairman
Sen. Richard Bryan, D-Nev., both opposed the bill. But backers
picked up support from other Democrats in the 13-7 vote.
   ``This is what we never had before. This is what is new,'' said
Victor Schwartz, an attorney for business and industry supporters
of the legislation, who said the support from Sen. Lloyd Bentsen
was especially important.
   ``This is very bipartisan now,'' he said.
   Congress has tried to develop a federal product liability law
since the 1970s, and President Bush made it an administration
legislative priority in his State of the Union address.
   The bill would create a uniform standard for imposing punitive
damages in product liability lawsuits and establish a two-year
statute of limitations for most product liability claims. Claims by
workers injured by durable goods such as factory machinery would
have a 25-year statute of limitations.
   The measure would allow separate trials or settlements of
punitive damages and compensatory damages and allow companies to
pay some non-economic damages in proportion to their responsibility
for harm.
   It would also exempt from punitive damage lawsuits products
approved by the Food and Drug Administration and the Federal
Aviation Administration.
   Opponents say the bill would needlessly pre-empt state law and
would limit the ability to collect for deaths and injuries that
result from industry negligence or irresponsibility.
   Backers of the legislation argue that variations in liability
laws from state to state offer potentially limitless damages and
hinder product development and American competitiveness.
   The bill will not go immediately go to the Senate because it has
been referred to the Judiciary Committee. Proponents say the bill's
prospects there are uncertain. However, there is a companion bill,
HR-2700, in the House.
   Schwartz said some opponents may attempt a filibuster if the
bill reaches the Senate floor for debate.
   Besides Bentsen, D-Texas, Democratic senators voting to report
the bill favorably out of committee were: Daniel Inouye of Hawaii,
Nebraska's James Exon, Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia and Charles
S. Robb of Virginia.
   Republicans voting for the bill were: Wisconsin's Robert W.
Kasten Jr., John Danforth of Missouri, Larry Pressler of South
Dakota, Ted Stevens of Arkansas, John McCain of Arizona, Conrad
Burns of Montana, Slade Gorton of Washington and Trent Lott of
Mississippi.
   Joining Hollings and Bryan in voting against the bill were:
Sens. Wendell Ford, D-Ky.; John Kerry, D-Mass.; Al Gore, D-Tenn.;
John Breaux, D-La. and Robert Packwood, R-Ore.

<HEAD>Canadian Family Pushes On In Quest For Armstrong</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LANCASTER, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Canadian investor family said Tuesday it
will continue to pursue its interests in Armstrong World Industries
Inc. despite setbacks at last month's company meeting.
   The investment company owned by the Belzbergs filed notice with
the Securities and Exchange Commission this week that it bought an
additional 10,000 shares of Armstrong stock on May 15.
   The Belzbergs now own 11.69 percent of Armstrong's 47.15 million
shares, said family spokesman Ned Scharff.
   ``It's really a small increment,'' he said. ``But it shows they
are buying.''
   The SEC filing did not describe the family's intentions for the
company, Scharff said.
   ``In this latest filing, they say they might buy, they might
sell, push for a merger, find a partner,'' he said. ``They just
listed about anything possible.''
   Armstrong spokesman John Scheldrup said, ``This filing isn't
anything new. Everything they said today they've said before.''
   The Belzbergs and Armstrong have been waging a bitter,
protracted proxy fight in full-page newspaper ads and in the courts.
   The family wanted revisions in the company's articles of
incorporation to be placed before the shareholders at the annual
meeting April 30. The floor covering company refused, charging that
the changes apparently were intended to smooth the way for a
takeover by eroding the board of directors' authority.
   The Belzbergs were not able to gain a court order in time to
force the revisions to be placed before the shareholders. The
matter is still in litigation.
   The Belzbergs gained just one seat on the 13-member board at the
April 30 meeting.
   The proxy fight prompted Pennsylvania to enact the nation's
toughest anti-takeover law in April. The measure would garnish
corporate raiders' short-term profits on takeover attempts,
constrict their voting rights and preserving labor contracts if
ownership changes hands.

<HEAD>Automaker Says It Will Keep Aerospace-Defense Subsidiary</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. is dropping a plan to sell its
remaining defense and aviation electronics business because it
didn't receive high enough bids, company officials said Tuesday.
   The nation's third-largest automaker put Chrysler Technologies
Corp. on the block in December and sold its largest operation,
corporate jet manufacturer Gulfstream Aerospace Corp., in February
for $825 million.
   Chrysler had said it also sought buyers for the remaining
Chrysler Technologies units as part of a move to concentrate on
making cars and trucks.
   Those units are Electrospace Systems Inc., a maker of defense
and electronics products and systems bought in 1987 for $367
million, and Airborne Systems Inc., formed in January 1989 by
combining military aviation operations of Gulfstream and
Electrospace.
   The company received inquiries ``but the values didn't
approximate what we felt these companies were worth to the
shareholders,'' Chrysler Technologies spokesman John Stellman said.
   ``Chrysler had stated that if it couldn't get a good price, it
wouldn't sell,'' said analyst Ron Glantz of Dean Witter Reynolds in
San Francisco.
   Although changes in world politics may have created
uncertainties about defense spending for tactical weapons, Chrysler
Technologies Chairman Paul E. Wright said the company had a 12
percent increase in orders in 1989 for the electronics,
surveillance and intelligence-oriented equipment in which it
specializes.
   Chrysler Technologies employs about 3,500 people in Texas,
Alabama and Virginia.

<HEAD>United's Unions Seek Second Investment Banker for Buyout</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Unions at United Airlines are negotiating to hire
a second investment banker to help secure financing for their
planned buyout of parent company UAL Corp., a union representative
said Tuesday.
   United Employee Acquisition Corp. wants to hire Goldman, Sachs &amp;
Co. to supplement work being done by Salomon Inc., one of the
advisers to the pilots' union.
   The union group's contract to buy UAL will lapse if financing
for the $4.38 billion deal is not obtained by Aug. 10. If the group
obtains financing it would have until the end of the year to close
the deal.
   ``This is a very large deal and there's a desire to get as much
firepower as we can possibly muster,'' said Steven Matthews, a
spokesman for the union group.
   ``It would be unusual for a deal of this size and complexity to
go forward with only one investment bank,'' Matthews said in a
telephone interview.
   The group includes the Air Line Pilots Association, the
International Association of Machinists, the Association of Flight
Attendants and non-contract workers.
   Under the deal approved April 6 by UAL's board, United's pilots
would own 37.9 percent of the company's stock, Machinists would own
35.7 percent, non-contract employees would get 14.3 percent and
flight attendants 12 percent.
   The union group has proposed overall employee wage and benefit
cuts totaling $2 billion over five years to offset buyout costs.
   Investor skepticism about the ability of the union group to
borrow the $4 billion needed to complete the buyout has contributed
to a steady slide in UAL's stock price from $163.50 the day the
deal was signed to as low as $150.37{. The stock fell $2.25 Tuesday
to close at $151.50 on the New York Stock Exchange.
   Skepticism has been fueled in part by the union group's
inability to find a new chief executive officer to replace UAL
Chairman Stephen M. Wolf.
   Matthews refused to comment on the search for a CEO but said he
is confident financing will be secured.

   Eight investment funds spawned by troubled VMS
Realty Partners said Tuesday they returned to profitablity in the
first quarter after reporting net losses last year because of their
former parent's problems.
   The funds also said they may try to take possession of some VMS
properties.
   The five real-estate investment trusts and three publicly traded
trusts made no additions to their loan-loss reserves in the first
quarter, they said in separate statements.
   But each of the funds reported a decline in earnings compared
with the first quarter of 1989, mainly because of provisions made
to cover the possibility that they will be unable to collect
accrued and unpaid interest from VMS.
   The funds have severed their ties to Chicago-based VMS, a
limited partnership syndicator that disclosed a severe liquidity
crisis last year.
   The funds had raised $1.1 billion from the public and lent it to
VMS to invest in real-estate development.
   In February, VMS stopped making loan payments to the funds and
four VMS officers resigned.
   VMS's troubles resulted partly from the softening real estate
market and from changes in the federal tax law in 1986 that made
real estate investments less attractive. Xerox Corp. holds a 25
percent interest in VMS.
   The eight funds said they were exploring the possibility of
taking possession, through various means including foreclosure, of
properties VMS put up as collateral.
   They said they have retained four firms _ Dean Witter Reynolds
Inc., Cushman &amp; Wakefield Inc., Draper &amp; Kramer and Grubb &amp; Ellis _
to provide real estate and financial advice.
   ``Representation by these well-regarded companies demonstrates
faith in our efforts to enhance the value of the funds,'' said
Leonard G. Levine, president of all eight funds and a former VMS
vice president.
   VMS had no immediate comment on the funds' statement, said Kathy
Zajicek, secretary to VMS Executive Vice President Scott Lager.
   The funds are VMS Mortgage Investment Fund; VMS Mortgage
Investors Limited Partnership; VMS Mortgage Investors L.P. II; VMS
Mortgage Investors L.P. III; VMS Short Term Income Trust; VMS Hotel
Investment Fund; VMS Strategic Land Trust; and VMS Strategic Land

<HEAD>Soviets Predict Their Energy Exports Are Likely To Fall Behind</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Soviet officials predicted
their nation's energy exports to Western and Eastern Europe would
drop in the next few years because Soviet oil, natural gas and coal
are becoming too expensive to produce.
   Petroleum and gas exports could drop to as little as one third
of their 1988 levels, according to Alexander A. Arbatov, a member
of the committee for natural resources of the Soviet Academy of
Sciences, and Foreign Ministry official Eugene M. Khartukov.
   In that year, the Soviet Union exported the energy equivalent of
447 million tons of coal, the two officials said in a joint written
presentation at the seventh Petroleum and Gas Conference here.
   ``Energy exports have ceased bringing in ... golden eggs'' for
the Soviet economy, the paper said.
   The Soviets have earned a significant amount of hard currency by
exporting energy to Western Europe, particularly West Germany,
Italy and Austria. Eastern Europe relies almost exclusively on the
Soviets for energy imports.
   The paper gave no specific reason for the rising cost of energy
production.
   Western experts, however, have said that Moscow has failed to
invest in modern equipment and is being forced to drill for oil and
gas on remote Siberian locations as more easily accessible sources
become depleted.
   In 1981, the Soviet Union made 7.1 times as much from the sale
of a barrel of crude petroleum as it cost to produce the oil, the
two officials' paper said.
   By next year, that ratio will have fallen to 1.8, the paper
said, adding similar declines in profitability were expected for
natural gas and coal.

<TEXT>
   With smoke, loud music and MTV-style videos,
Microsoft Corp. Tuesday formally introduced its new version of
Windows, a software product designed to make IBM personal computers
and their clones as easy to use as Macintosh computers.
   Bill Gates, Microsoft's 34-year-old chairman, told hundreds of
financial analysts, journalists and others at a New York theater
that Windows is ``a major milestone in the history of the PC
industry.''
   Many analysts agree. They say Windows could provide the
strongest challenge yet to Apple Computer Inc.'s popular Macintosh
by grafting its user-friendly operations onto International
Business Machines Corp. personal computers and compatible models _
machines that are notorious for their arcane commands.
   Gates told the standing-room-only crowd _ and, by satellite
hookup, audiences in six other cities nationwide _ that his
Redmond, Wash.-based software company will spend $10 million
promoting Windows over the next six months. He called that a record
for the software industry.
   Microsoft plans to mail 400,000 demonstration copies of the $149
software to personal computer users, Gates told the audience after
a sound-and-light show that mixed hype, humor and product
demonstrations.
   More than 30 personal computer companies have said they will
include Windows with their machines, and dozens of software
companies are making applications programs compatible with the new
version of Windows.
   Windows could provide a major boost to Microsoft, which already
dominates the personal computer software industry. Shearson Lehman
Hutton Inc. projects Windows and related products will reap nearly
$500 million in revenues for Microsoft in the fiscal year that
starts July 1.
   ``I think it's the most significant announcement since the
introduction of DOS,'' said Rick Sherlund, an analyst at Goldman,
Sachs &amp; Co., referring to the operating system for IBM personal
computers developed by Microsoft.
   ``This delivers a lot of the capabilities that normally have
been associated with the Mac to the PC,'' he said, referring to IBM
machines and their knockoffs.
   The loser, of course, could be Apple. A Windows-equipped IBM
clone could sell for as little as half the price of a Macintosh.
   Apple's stock dropped a total of $2 a share Friday and Monday,
after adjusting for a dividend, but rose $1.87{ a share Tuesday to
close at $41.37{ in national over-the-counter trading.
   Microsoft shares jumped $1.25 Tuesday to close at $71.50 in
over-the-counter trading, after rising a total of $5.50 Friday and
Monday in anticipation of the announcement.
   Apple, based in Cupertino, Calif., is expected to announce a
lower-priced Macintosh later this year and is working on a more
powerful version of its operating system.
   Most computer experts also say the Macintosh retains some
advantages over a Windows-equipped IBM machine, expecially for
intensive graphics-based uses.
   Microsoft, for its part, says it will not target Macintosh users
or potential users, instead pitching Windows to users of IBM
machines and compatible models.
   That strategy is due in part to the fact that 85 percent of the
computer market is composed of IBM machines or clones, compared
with the Macintosh's 7 percent share.
   Windows works on computers using Intel Corp.'s 80286, 80386 or
80486 microprocessors. That encompasses about 20 million computers
in use, out of about 50 million that use the DOS operating system,
Microsoft says.
   This is Microsoft's third version of Windows. The first version,
introduced in 1985, and a later enhancement both failed to impress
computer experts.
   Windows is product known as a graphical user interface. It
shields computer users from complex, typed commands by replacing
them with on-screen pictures called icons and a hand-held control
device called a mouse.
   Windows also expands a computer's useable memory capacity and
allows users to keep several applications programs active at once
by running them in sections of the screen called windows.

<HEAD>FBI Agents Search Northrop Corp. Plants In California</HEAD>
<HEAD>rkdsm1rkdjsa2</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   FBI agents on Tuesday searched two Northrop
Corp. plants where fuselage parts are built for the Navy's FA-18
fighter-bomber.
   Neither Northrop nor the FBI would comment on the purpose of the
raids. The government sued the company last month alleging
fraudulent billing on the FA-18 program.
   The raids were the latest in a series of criminal and civil
actions that have plagued the aerospace company over the past few
years.
   Northrop spokesman Ron Owens confirmed the searches of plants in
suburban Hawthorne and El Segundo.
   ``We are working with them in their search, and that is all that
I can comment upon,'' Owens said.
   FBI Special Agent Fred Reagan said he could not comment on the
raids, although he admitted, ``Everyone seems to know about them.''
   McDonnell Douglas is the prime contractor for the carrier-based
FA-18. Northrop assembles the center and aft sections of the plane
as a subcontractor under what is known as a sole-source,
fixed-price agreement.
   That means only one contractor is considered qualified to do the
work and it is not subject to competitive bidding.
   In April the Justice Department sued Northrop, claiming the
company had fraudulently fattened bills submitted to the Navy for
work on the FA-18.
   Damages were estimated at $25 million by an attorney familiar
with the case, and the recovery could be treble because the suit
was originally filed by a former Northrop employee under the
federal false claims act.
   The Justice Department intervened in the case and took over the
litigation after apparently deciding not to file criminal charges
as part of a deal with Northrop last February.
   Under that deal, Northrop pleaded guilty to 34 criminal fraud
counts and agreed to pay a $17 million fine for alleged
falsification of tests on a stabilization control for the Marine
AV-8B Harrier jet fighter and for the MX missile guidance mechanism.
   The Justice Department lawsuit claimed Northrop failed to
disclose savings it made from a new manufacturing method for the
FA-18 parts.
   The parts are made from composite materials and formed in a
process that requires high pressure, heat and vacuum.
   The original suit was filed in 1987 by former Northrop contract
and pricing division manager Eldon L. Janssen, who claimed he
learned of the alleged deceitful pricing in the course of his
duties.
   Despite the February plea-bargain agreement, Northrop remains
open to several investigations and lawsuits. The Justice Department
sued Northrop for $5 million over the AV-8B tests despite the
criminal pleading.
   Among Northrop's other legal problems:
   _Allegations of $20 billion in overcharges on the B-2 bomber.
FBI agents in February raided Northrop's B-2 parts plant in Pico
Rivera.
   _Grand juries in Los Angeles and Honolulu are looking at whether
Northrop made political payoffs to South Korea.
   _A Texas grand jury is looking into allegations that Northrop
cheated the government on a program auctioning property seized by
the U.S. Customs Service.
   _Former Northrop employees are engaged in a ``whistleblower''
lawsuit that mirrors the government charges on the MX missile
guidance system. Their attorney said he is seeking between $20
million and $30 million in damages.

<TEXT>
   Delegates to a United Auto Workers
bargaining strategy convention Tuesday killed an effort that would
have required bargainers to seek cost-of-living protection for the
union's 446,000 retirees.
   By knocking down a procedural move to have the convention
consider a resolution from a Flint, Mich., local, delegates
supported UAW President Owen Bieber's plea to keep negotiating
committees unfettered.
   After winning the vote Bieber engineered a quick end to the
convention, which originally was scheduled to conclude Wednesday,
with delegates adopting dozens of resolutions directing negotiators
this summer.
   At a news conference later, Bieber said the union would seek
inflation protection for its 446,000 retirees.
   ``We'll have the whole six miles out there,'' he said, meaning
all options to protect the income of pensioners will be considered.
   The UAW isn't required to bargain for retirees. But in the past,
the union has negotiated lump-sum payments for retirees to counter
inflation.
   A COLA for retirees proposal could be extremely costly for the
Big Three automakers, the companies and the union have said. The
union estimates that such a provision could cost more than $1
billion a year for the Big Three.
   Contract talks open in July with each of the Big Three.
   Automakers and UAW executives alike have warned that the cost of
a sliding inflation protection instead of a lump-sum payment could
result in reductions in other benefits.
   Despite that, the COLA for retirees issue has been gaining steam
in recent months.
   On Tuesday, after about an hour's debate, a move by delegate
Alex Wassell to bring a resolution from Flint calling for COLA for
retirees to the convention floor failed overwhelmingly in a
show-of-hands vote.
   During the debate, Bieber repeatedly told delegates that
although a separate resolution doesn't include specific references
to COLA, negotiators would bring the matter to bargaining tables at
General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp.
   ``I do not believe that there is one single person in this
convention hall, and certainly your president, who reads that
language to preclude our attempting to get COLA,'' Bieber said.
   That wasn't good enough for Wassell of Local 1776 at GM's Willow
Run, Mich., assembly plant.
   ``I was trying to shoehorn Bieber into getting the language,''
he said. ``I'm not satisfied because Bieber may indeed not make
that a top priority.''
   In his opening address on Monday, Bieber listed five major
bargaining goals _ job security, pension improvements, higher
wages, protection of health-care benefits and responsible
management by the automakers.
   There was little debate during the first two days of the
convention, with the exception of retirees' inflation protection.
   ``Brother Bieber said it does not preclude fighting for COLA on
pensions. I believe that's not half strong enough,'' said Mike
Nuckolls of Local 1999 in Oklahoma City.
   ``There is one issue we can't let them wimp out on,'' he said.
``We need COLA for pensions.''
   Also Tuesday, UAW members voted overwhelmingly to combine three
of the union's 15 U.S. regions into two. The merger would occur
only when one of the three regional directors leaves office for any
reason.
   The three regions _ 2, 2A and 2B in Ohio, West Virginia and
parts of Pennsylvania _ have just under 113,000 members. The
consolidation reflects the shrinking size of the union, which has
dropped from a high of about 1.5 million members in the 1970s to
about 1 million now.

<HEAD>Dollar Slips, Share Prices Advance Moderately in Early Trading</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar slipped in early trading against the yen
Wednesday and share prices rose strongly on the Tokyo Stock
Exchange.
   The dollar started trading at 151.65 yen, down 0.75 yen from
Tuesday's close of 152.40 yen. It finished at 152.25 yen in New
York overnight, down from 153.73 yen on Monday.
   The yen's strength bolstered prices in Japan's stock and bond
markets.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues gained 241.56
points, or 0.75 percent, moving to 32,179.86 points in the first 15
minutes of trading. The index rose 173.25 points Tuesday.
   The benchmark No. 119 10-year Japanese government bond rose to
87.69 points from Tuesday's close at 87.45. That pushed the yield
down to 7.025 percent from 7.075 percent.
   Currency dealers said the dollar's low opening followed its
overnight decline against the yen in New York, even though the U.S.
currency gained ground against most European currencies there.
   Kouhei Kuroda, a dealer with Fuji Bank, said the dollar was
bought temporarily during early trading, but failed to rise as far
as the 152-yen level.
   ``There's still a sentiment of yen strength against the dollar
in the market,'' Kuroda said.

<HEAD>Federal Grand Jury Charges Four Companies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Justice Department prosecutors have charged
that four companies conspired to fix prices nationwide on
heavy-duty hinges.
   A federal grand jury indictment returned Tuesday in St. Louis
said the companies and executives of three of the firms violated
antitrust law, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported. The conspiracy
began as early as April 1986 and lasted for at least two years, the
indictment alleges.
   Companies indicted were Hager Hinge Co. of St. Louis, The
Stanley Works of New Britain, Conn., McKinney Products Co. of
Scranton, Pa., and Lawrence Brothers Inc. of Sterling, Ill.
   A Justice Department lawyer working on the case, P. Terry
Lubeck, said Hager has agreed to plead guilty. Lubeck said Hager
officials began cooperating with authorities soon after the
investigation began two years ago.
   A Hager official declined to comment.
   Stanley said in a release it would plead not guilty.
   The one-count indictment said the defendants and others
conspired to ``suppress competition by fixing prices'' on
architectural hinges sold nationwide. Architectural hinges are used
to hang heavy doors in offices and public buildings.
   The companies conspired to reduce list prices for architectural
hinges but cut discounts to customers, the indictment said.
   ``They lowered their list prices and lowered their discounts so
that the net effect was to increase prices,'' said Lubeck, adding
that the scheme netted ``many, many, many millions of dollars.''
   Also indicted were John A. Lawrence, chairman of Lawrence, and
two Stanley officials _ Richard G. Martin, president of the Stanley
Hardware Division and John F. Hollfelder, a vice president of sales
who has since retired.
   ``The Stanley Works and Mr. Martin ... intend to plead not
guilty,'' Stanley spokesman Ronald F. Gilrain said in a release.
``The company and Mr. Martin believe that they have meritorious
defenses and they will defend themselves vigorously against the
charges.''
   Also charged was Robert A. Haversat, president of McKinney until
September 1986, the indictment said. Haversat is now president of
Esstar Holdings Inc., the parent of McKinney, Lubeck said. David B.
Gibson, a marketing manager who reported to Haverset at McKinney
and is now its president, also was indicted.
   No Hager officials were charged.
   Lubeck declined to specify what prompted the inquiry. If
convicted, maximum penalties against each company would be a $1
million fine, twice the gain from the crime or twice the loss to
victims _ whichever is greater. The company executives could be
sentenced to three years in prison and fined $250,000.

<HEAD>Australian Financier Bond Has 10 Weeks to Sell Brewery Assets</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: All dollar figures are U.S.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Financier Alan Bond's beleagured
company said it still will face debts of about $4.03 billion even
after its planned sale of its major cash producer, its Australian
brewing operations.
   On Tuesday, the National Australia Bank gave Bond Corp. Holdings
Ltd. 10 weeks to complete the sale of its local brewing assets or
repay in full the brewery's debt of $608 million by the end of
September.
   Bond Corp. director Peter Lucas said Wednesday that the expected
sale of the breweries to Bell Resources Ltd. will not change the
group's consolidated debt because it is an internal deal. Bell is
owned 58 percent by Bond Corp.
   ``We've still got a big program in front of us, and a long way
to go until we are in the clear,'' Lucas said.
   The National Australia Bank decision requires Bond Corp. to
surrender control of Bond Brewing, the producer of Tooheys,
Castlemaine XXXX and Swan beers.
   Bond Corp. and Bell Resources said in separate statements that
Bell would buy the breweries in a deal valued at $1.40 billion.
Bell will not pay for the breweries, instead receiving $243 million
owed by Bond Corp. from inter-company debts.
   Published reports Wednesday in several Australian newspapers
suggested that the deal will allow New Zealand brewer Lion Nathan
Ltd. to re-open negotiations over buying a half share in the
breweries as it originally planned to do last September.
   ``The latest delopment turns the focus back to Bell Resources,
with whom we have maintained a strong dialogue,'' Lion Nathan chief
executive Doug Myers said.
   Also Tuesday, Bond Corp. agreed to cut its voting rights in Bell
Resources to 25 per cent _ ahead of reducing its stake to that
level by next March _ and pass managerial control of the breweries
to accountancy firm KPMG Peat Marwick in the interim.
   Under the terms of the agreement, Bond Brewing does not need to
repay its loans from the bank syndicate until July 1, 1991 if the
brewery sale is completed by this July 31. Otherwise, the National
Australia Bank-led syndicate retains the right to liquidate Bond
Brewing if the debts are not repaid by September 30.

<HEAD>Hammer Defends Occidental Building Museum in His Name</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By E. SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Occidental Petroleum Corp. Chairman
Armand Hammer told skeptical shareholders Tuesday it was a
legitimate corporate expense for Occidental to spend $98 million to
set up a museum for his art collection.
   Hammer, 92, joking that his new heart pacemaker is guaranteed
for eight years, said the museum will breed goodwill as displaying
his collection around the world has done.
   That will help business, ultimately boosting profits and the
stock price, he said at Occidental's annual meeting at the Santa
Monica Civic Auditorium.
   The Armand Hammer Museum and Cultural Center is under
construction beside the company's headquarters building in Los
Angeles and is scheduled to open in November.
   Three groups of shareholders sued after learning that Occidental
was funding the museum. Plans call for the company to donate $60
million to build the Armand Hammer Museum of Art and Cultural
Center and $38 million to endow it.
   That doesn't sit well with shareholders such as Geneva Fulton,
who stepped to the microphone and told the board of directors: ``I
don't believe as a stockholder that we should have to pay for Dr.
Hammer's museum.''
   Hammer replied that his art collection was appraised recently at
$400 million and included a van Gogh painting, ``Hospital at St.
Remy,'' that he estimated might be worth more than $100 million at
auction.
   ``I am surrendering this without any reward to myself or
compensation,'' he said.
   ``For one reason, you can't take it with you,'' he said to
laughter. ``The second reason is, I think it's good for Occidental
and for you as shareholders.''
   Hammer decided to build the museum after reneging on a promise
to donate his collection to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art.
He backed out of that deal after the museum refused some of his
demands, including taking the names of other donors off the
building.
   Not all shareholders were critical of the museum plan and Hammer.
   ``He's an older man ... let him live in peace and contentment,
and the shareholders should mind their own business,'' a
gray-haired woman said at the end of a rambling speech of praise.
``I love you dear, and you should live forever.''
   Hammer, noting that he'd heard recently of a 90-year-old woman
marrying a 93-year-old man, replied: ``Send me your name and
telephone number.'' He met briefly with her after the meeting.
