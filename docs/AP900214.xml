<HEAD>Attacker Beats Governing Party Candidate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>

   A prominent candidate seeking re-election to
Japan's Parliament was attacked and injured near the capital on
Tuesday evening by an assailant wielding a steel rod.
   Koichi Hamada, 61, of the governing Liberal Democratic Party,
was struck repeatedly on the head with a 16-inch rod as he left a
hall after a campaign rally in Kimitsu, a police official said
Wednesday.
   A suspect, 27-year-old Minoru Uzawa, was arrested at the scene
in Chiba Prefecture, 20 miles east of Tokyo.
   It was the third attack directed at a Japanese politician in a
month, and the second on a conservative candidate in three days.
   After the attack, Hamada was taken to a nearby hospital for
treatment of head injuries, which were described as requiring 10
days to heal, said the police official, who declined to be named.
   Uzawa is a member the Inagawa-kai, one of the nation's largest
criminal syndicates, the official said. Police booked him on
charges of inflicting bodily injury.
   Uzawa was quoted by police as saying he had attacked Hamada
because he ``disliked him.'' Investigators were looking into his
motives, the official said.
   Hamada, who is seeking to be returned to the House of
Representatives for a seventh time, has held such posts as
director-general of the Defense Agency and chairman of the party's
Public Relations Committee. A 1980 gambling scandal led Hamada to
resign from Parliament for one term, but he was re-elected to his
seat in 1983.
   Tuesday's attack followed an apparently unrelated shooting
incident at the campaign office of former Prime Minister Yasuhiro
Nakasone in Takasaki, 60 miles northwest of Tokyo, on Sunday. A
23-year-old member of a rightist group was arrested on the spot. No
injuries were reported.
   In another attack, Mayor Hitoshi Motoshima of Nagasaki was shot
in the back Jan. 18 as he left City Hall. A member of a rightist
group has been charged with attempted murder in the case.
   Rightist groups, which often include gang members, have been
criticizing Nakasone and other governing party leaders for their
alleged involvement in the massive bribery and influence-peddling
scandal known as the Recruit affair. Motoshima has been the target
of right-wing death threats for remarks he made about the late
Emperor Hirohito's war role.

   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s parent company
filed for bankruptcy court protection late Tuesday, signaling the
demise of the Wall Street firm that came to symbolize quick riches
and scandal in the 1980s.
   Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc.'s board of directors
authorized the move to seek protection from creditors under Chapter
11 of the federal bankruptcy code. The Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
broker-dealer subsidiary and Drexel Government Securities Inc. were
not included in the filing.
   The step climaxed one of the most tumultuous periods in Wall
Street history for the cocksure investment house, which pioneered
the use of risky, high-interest ``junk bonds'' to finance billions
of dollars worth of corporate takeovers under now-indicted
executive Michael Milken.
   It also could have broad effects far from Wall Street, on
companies that have invested in Drexel's junk bonds, pension funds
that hold the securities and businesses attempting to pay off junk
debt.
   Drexel was crippled by the government's insider trading
investigation, in which it pleaded guilty to six felonies and paid
$650 million to settle fraud charges. Milken's subsequent departure
amid criminal allegations against him and the collapse of the
junk-bond market which Drexel still dominates contributed to the
firm's troubles.
   ``This means the end of Drexel Burnham as a viable entity,''
said a former executive at Drexel, which used its junk bond
business to catapult from a third-tier brokerage to the nation's
fifth-largest in under a decade.
   Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc. said Tuesday it had defaulted
on about $100 million in loans and a lack of cash threatened other
defaults. Drexel was turned down for bank financing it sought to
avert the filing.
   Drexel said in a statement that the petition for reorganization
cites liabilities exceeding $3 billion and assets exceeding $3.6
billion. The bankruptcy filing was made late Tuesday at the home of
a U.S. Bankruptcy Court clerk outside New York, the firm said.
   Chief Executive Frederick Joseph told employees Tuesday morning
the parent company and certain subsidiaries would file for Chapter
11, which would protect Drexel from creditors' claims while it
attempted to deal with its shattered finances.
   Workers later were told they would be paid Thursday but Drexel
could guarantee nothing more.
   Few on Wall Street believe Drexel will survive. Many stock and
bond traders refused outright to do business with Drexel on
Tuesday, and stock exchange specialists said Drexel brokers were
openly soliciting jobs on the New York Stock Exchange floor during
the day.
   The firm began liquidating its positions in billions of dollars
worth of government bonds, mortgage-backed securities and other
financial instruments; negotiated to transfer customer accounts to
Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co.; withdrew as a market maker in
more than 200 over-the-counter stocks; and put entire business
units up for sale.
   Wall Street professionals said shock waves from Drexel's
disclosure were muted because its crippling financial problems had
been anticipated, and the decline of its junk bond business known
for months.
   Also, Drexel said Monday it was seeking an investor or merger
partner to help prevent its collapse.
   Wary of the broader impact of Drexel's possible collapse, the
Securities and Exchange Commission, Federal Reserve Board and NYSE
coordinated plans on how to prevent a financial panic over the
firm's troubles.
   The SEC said it had moved to protect the assets of the
broker-dealer subsidiary by barring it from transferring net
capital to the parent without specific approval. The Federal
Reserve Bank of New York said it would monitor Drexel's decision to
liquidate its government securities positions.
   Drexel's downfall may have been sudden, but so was its rise
during the bullish 1980s.
   The high-flying firm made gargantuan profits in its heyday _
close to $1 billion before taxes in 1986 _ and paid its employees
accordingly. Milken personally made more than $1 billion from
1983-87.
   Its attitude toward financing was embodied by brash letters
telling clients it was ``highly confident'' it could raise hundreds
of millions of dollars during corporate takeover battles, and by
its annual junk-bond conference known as the ``Predators' Ball.''
   But the luster began fading in 1986, when the SEC arrested
Drexel investment banker Dennis Levine on insider-trading charges
in a highly publicized investigation that later snared Drexel,
other employees and an investment firm it did business with,
Princeton-Newport Partners.
   In late 1988, Drexel agreed to plead guilty to criminal activity
rather than face a crippling racketeering indictment. Milken was
indicted last year on 98 counts of fraud and racketeering and
forced to leave the firm.
   Some Wall Street professionals _ not all Drexel supporters _
contend the critical factors that crippled Drexel were the criminal
settlement and the departure of Milken, who almost singlehandedly
managed the $200 billion junk bond market.
   ``They're going bankrupt not because of economics but because of
politics,'' a Milken associate said. ``They made a deal _
ultimately a deal they weren't able to survive.''
   Drexel also agreed to unprecedented government supervision in
settling civil securities fraud charges and paid more than $40
million to settle claims with states, although it still faces civil
litigation nationwide.
   In a cost-cutting restructuring following its settlements,
Drexel quit the retail brokerage business and cut its work force to
5,300 from a peak of 10,700. The firm had a net loss of about $40
million last year.

   Three men took 11
students on a school bus hostage Tuesday, but were arrested after
releasing all but one of the youngsters and leading authorities on
a brief chase, police said.
   The hostages were unharmed, officials said.
   The Royal Canadian Mounted Police supplied the three with a
getaway car, and allowed them to take one of the students with
them, police said. One of the men was armed with a .303-caliber
rifle, and another had a .22-caliber semiautomatic rifle, police
said.
   The trio drove north out of this city about 300 miles north of
Vancouver, then turned off the main highway onto a side road, where
police surrounded and arrested them around 6:50 p.m., police said.
   The school bus was parked for more than an hour after the
incident began at 4:30 p.m. in a downtown car dealership parking
lot.
   It was believed the students were from Prince George Secondary
School, the news agency Canadian Press reported.
   After the bus was seized, police sharpshooters were sent to the
scene, but no shots were fired by either police or the gunmen,
authorities said.
   Traffic downtown was cordoned off.

   Leftist guerrillas kidnapped two
Americans Tuesday to protest President Bush's visit for a drug
summit and said they would put their captives on trial, police
said. One was later released.
   Also Tuesday, anti-Bush demonstrators took to the streets in
Cartagena, where about 1,000 leftist union members marched, and in
the capital Bogota, where police fired tear gas at rock-throwing
students as about 100 marched downtown. No injuries were reported.
   On Tuesday night, members of the powerful Medellin drug cartel
said in a statement that they will give up their three largest
cocaine laboratories with a combined monthly production capacity of
21 tons.
   A Caracol radio network report said The Extraditables told a
group of journalists in Medellin where the laboratories and
chemicals are located, but as of early Wednesday, none of the
facilities was reported found.
   The Americans, abducted in Medellin, were identified as David
Kent, a 40-year-old teacher from Indianapolis, and James Archer
Donnelly, a 65-year-old businessman from Detroit who was kidnapped
his Colombian wife, police said.
   Donnelly and his wife were released unhurt at 10:30 a.m., said
Lt. Eusabio Guerrero, a police spokesman from Medellin. They were
released about three hours after their kidnapping, said an official
at the school where Kent teaches.
   The official at the government-funded Colombo American
Institute, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Donnelly was
told by his captors that they were leftist guerrillas and had taken
the action to protest Bush's visit Thursday for a four-nation drug
summit.
   The kidnappings were certain to fuel concerns, already high,
over Bush's security during the summit. Two U.S. ships are
patrolling off the Colombian coast: the USS Nassau, an 820-foot
amphibious assault ship that carries helicopters and an 1,700-man
Marine landing team, and the USS Sampson, a 437-foot destroyer,
according to the Pentagon.
   In Washington, the State Department confirmed the kidnappings
but said Donnelly was kidnapped Monday night. It had no immediate
confirmation on his reported release.
   The Colombian radio network Caracol said its Medellin station
received a telephone call from an anonymous man, claiming to be a
spokesman for leftist guerrillas, who claimed responsibility for
the abductions.
   The caller said the men would be put on trial and would be
released in five days, Caracol said. He did not explain why there
would be a trial or why the men would be released.
   Police said Kent he has lived in Medellin for several years.
   Donnelly runs a company called Exco that manufactures hydraulic
equipment, the police spokesman said on condition of anonymity. He
said he had no further details on the men.
   The spokesman said the kidnappers were from the National
Liberation Army, a leftist guerrilla group, known by its initials
in Spanish as the ELN.
   There was no way to confirm if the kidnapppers really are
leftist guerrillas. Drug traffickers have been found in the past
posing as leftist insurgents.
   Colombian police, who have fought nearly a six-month war with
drug traffickers, said Monday night they had seized more than three
tons of dynamite and almost $5 million in raids on traffickers'
hideouts.
   The dynamite was seized near Medellin in raids on two
trafficking hideouts, the director of Colombia's national police,
Gen. Miguel Gomez, told the news conference.
   Since the government declared war on traffickers Aug. 18, the
drug lords have committed 262 terrorist acts, mostly bombings, that
have killed 209 people.
   The bombings include the downing of a Colombian airliner in
which 107 people were killed.
   In the past month, the traffickers have claimed in communiques
that they want a truce with the government and are willing to
dismantle their drug business if the government will stop
extraditing them to the United States.
   Fourteen suspected traffickers have been extradited to the
United States in the last five months.
   U.S. Ambassador to Colombia Thomas McNamara, speaking at a news
conference Tuesday in Cartagena, would not comment on possible
negotiations with the traffickers. He said such talks, proposed by
the traffickers, are an internal matter for the Colombian
government.
   President Virgilio Barco has said repeatedly he will never
negotiate with the drug lords.
   During his news conference, McNamara bristled at repeated
questions over Bush's security.
   Speaking of the Colombian government, he said, ``I think what
they resent is the fact ... that they seem not to be able to get
you to come off the security aspect and to address the real
substance of the summit.''
   But U.S. officials have decided there is so much danger that
Bush must fly into Barranquilla, 85 miles away, then helicopter
into a heavily guarded navy base and spend only six hours in
Cartagena.
   There has been little violence by traffickers in Cartagena, but
it has been enough not only to alarm Bush's aides but to turn away
thousands of American tourists who usually come each winter.
   A bomb exploded Oct. 26, killing two tourists in their hotel
room.
   Eight years ago, two men posing as hotel workers forced two U.S.
drug agents out of the Cartagena Hilton at gunpoint, took them into
the countryside, shot them and left them for dead. The agents
survived.

   The history of salmon-fishing in the
stormy North Pacific is filled with tales of brave fishermen riding
the wild seas, but its future is being shaped in calmer waters.
   Thousands of salmon in this sheltered arm of Puget Sound are
captives in sunken pens the size of basketball courts. Crowded fin
to fin, they swim endless laps, gobbling feed pellets and being
fattened toward the day they'll be scooped up and whisked to market.
   Yet while the crenulated coastline and pristine waters that
stretch from Washington's Puget Sound to southeastern Alaska might
be ideal for fish farming, the political climate is not so
welcoming.
   In Alaska, where commercial fishermen are a powerful lobby,
bumper stickers in fishing towns proclaim ``Real Fish Don't Eat
Pellets,'' and the Legislature is considering a permanent ban on
fish farms when a two-year moratorium expires in July.
   In Washington state, salmon farmers have the official blessing
of the Legislature, but that has helped little in the face of
challenges from fishermen and environmental groups, which have
defeated several proposed farms.
   The fish waste produced by a two-acre salmon farm is equivalent
to the sewage produced by a town of 5,000 people, claims a
Washington citizens group called the Marine Environmental
Consortium.
   Environmentalists also fear introduced species such as Atlantic
salmon _ favored because they fetch a higher price and are more
docile than Pacific salmon _ will corrupt the local gene pool and
spread disease. Wealthy owners of shoreside homes, meanwhile, don't
want fish farms spoiling their views.
   Promoters call fish farming an efficient way to help meet the
world's growing appetite for fish. Not only does it provide a
year-round supply of fresh salmon to supplement the seasonal wild
catch, they say, it also creates jobs free of the hazards of
commercial fishing, one of the nation's most dangerous occupations.
   They also contend salmon-farming provides an economic incentive
to preserve clean water.
   ``We're the best environmentalists of all, because we're
dependent on it,'' said Jerry Polley, site manager for Global Aqua,
the nation's largest salmon farm. ``If something's wrong with the
water quality, we're going to be the first to complain.''
   Production of farmed salmon, here and abroad, has boomed in five
years, flooding markets traditionally held by wild salmon and
driving down prices.
   ``For the first couple of years, as more salmon was around on a
year-round basis, the farmed fish seemed to help the wild market,''
said commercial fisherman Randy Babich. ``Now it's a battle at the
retail counter.''
   Fish farming, or aquaculture, is hardly a new concept. For
years, farmers have raised oysters in the Northwest, rainbow trout
in Idaho and catfish in the Southeast. But techniques have
developed more slowly in domesticating salmon, the mainstay of
fisheries off Oregon, Washington, British Columbia and Alaska.
   For years, it was practiced only by the Norwegians, forced into
salmon farming by their declining wild fish populations. But
interest has spread quickly since 1985, after Norway refined
methods to raise salmon cheaply enough to compete with the wild
catch.
   In 1983, world production of farmed salmon was 23,500 metric
tons, just 3 percent of the 670,000-ton wild salmon catch. By last
year, farmed salmon production had soared to an estimated 202,000
tons, or 30 percent of the relatively constant wild catch.
   Norway still leads the pack, producing about 75 percent of the
world's farmed salmon, but other places, including Scotland, Chile,
Canada and Iceland, are catching up. The United States, with 50
fish farms in Washington state and Maine, lags far behind,
producing 1 percent of the total.
   Many of the U.S. salmon farms are run by Norwegian companies,
including Global Aqua's four-acre operation in Rich Passage, 10
miles west of Seattle.
   Global Aqua's farm is fairly typical: a huge raft anchored
offshore holds 40 pens, each lined with a net holding up to 15 tons
of fish, which range from finger-size smolts to fat-bellied salmon
2 feet long.
   A half-dozen workers tend the pens from metal walkways, filling
automatic feeders and mending nets. At harvest, workers herd fish
into one end of the pens, scoop them out with an oversize dipnet
and load them onto a boat. The salmon are still kicking when they
reach a Seattle processing plant 30 minutes away.
   In the three years it takes to raise salmon to harvest, farmers
contend with prowling otters, hungry sea lions and diseases that
can wipe out whole farms if left unchecked.
   Aquaculturists say their operations will never be a major blot
on the coastline.
   ``It would take just 40 acres of farms to produce all of the
salmon that was imported into the United States in 1988,'' said
Chris Gibson of Sea Farm Washington in Port Angeles. ``The industry
does not need a lot of space.''
   It may need even less space in coming months. Worldwide growth
of salmon farming and recent overproduction in Norway have glutted
the market with fish. Prices have plunged, and many farms are
selling below cost just to keep cash flowing.
   In British Columbia, lax regulation and a surge of Norwegian
investment capital helped the number of fish farms soar from five
to 135 in the last six years. But now many are in trouble. Nineteen
have filed for receivership in the past year, and small businesses
are being bought out by large investors better able to outlast the
lull in prices.
   Aquaculture boosters profess confidence in their long-term place
in the salmon trade.
   Declining stocks of wild salmon already have forced Northwest
fishermen to rely more heavily on fish that are started in
shoreside hatcheries and released to sea. About 23 percent of
Alaska's ``wild'' catch now comes from hatcheries, while some
salmon populations off Washington's coast are 60 percent
hatchery-reared.
   ``We're not going to re-establish the wild resource. You just
don't have the habitat for them to come back to,'' said John Pitts,
who promotes aquaculture for the Washington Department of
Agriculture. ``Future generations will become more dependent on
aquaculture.''
   Perhaps, but as long as any wild salmon remain, some
independent-minded fishermen will take their chances on the high
seas rather than turn in their rain slickers for bags of fish chow.
   ``It's the Cro-Magnon in us,'' said Randy Babich. ``Fishing is
one of the last hunting-gathering professions in the world. Tossing
feed into a pond just doesn't provide the same adventure.''

<HEAD>AP Announces Test of Turnkey Audiotex Service</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Associated Press has announced plans for
test-marketing an audiotex service that will allow AP member
newspapers to provide readers with voice information services
without any capital costs.
   The test of the new nationwide 900-number service was announced
Tuesday at the Talking Newspapers Audiotex Conference.
   The AP will set up a centralized computer operation that will
allow member newspapers to make stock quotes and business headlines
available to their readers over a nationwide pay-per-call network.
Newspapers will not have to buy a computer or acquire phone lines
for the system.
   The service will be test-marketed with a limited number of
newspapers during the spring, and, if successful, will be offered
to all AP members.
   For the past five years, AP has been providing audiotex services
to members who operate stand-alone audiotex systems. These services
include stock quotes, sports scores, weather and audio briefs
covering general, business, sports and agricultural news from AP.
Those services will still be available to members of the news
cooperative.
   ``With audiotex, newspapers can broaden their coverage in their
local communities,'' said Chris Pederson, AP's sales manager for
information services. ``In essence, newspapers become a 24-hour,
seven-day-a-week information source, only a phone call away from
their readers.''
   In the new service, newspapers will pay an initial set-up fee
and agree to promote the service through house ads in their
publication. Newspapers will receive a royalty check monthly for
calls made to the service by their readers. Each service will be
customized to carry the name of the participating newspaper.

   A sex offender has asked for permission
to withdraw a guilty plea that prompted a judge to recommend that
the man be castrated before being granted early release from prison.
   Samuel E. Powell, 42, of Bell Township, also filed a request
Monday for a change in his sentence if his withdrawal request were
rejected.
   There was no indication when a ruling on his requests would be
made.
   Judge Gilfert Mihalick recently sentenced Powell to 30 to 60
years in prison and recommended that he undergo medical or surgical
castration before being granted early release. The recommendation
is not binding.
   On Monday, Powell testified he was mentally incompetent when he
pleaded guilty in October to 25 sex offenses involving a girl, now
9, between 1986 and 1988. Powell was committed to Fairview State
Hospital last week.

   What does it take to become a princess? It takes
class. Lots of them, nearly every day.
   During the next month, 13 carefully selected tutors will try to
instill a royal aura in Kiko Kawashima, a college student who will
wed Emperor Akihito's younger son in June.
   With a notebook clutched to her chest and her hair pulled back
in a ponytail, Miss Kawashima arrived at the palace Tuesday morning
in a black, chauffeur-driven limousine to begin her ``princess
studies.''
   The first class on the agenda was religious rites and coronation
ceremonies. The teacher was Torahiko Nagazumi, a former chamberlain
and classmate of the late Emperor Hirohito.
   Miss Kawashima's curriculum, worked out by the Imperial
Household Agency, will cover eight topics: classical poetry,
calligraphy, Japanese history, palace rituals, laws related to the
imperial family, the imperial system, the constitution and
religious ceremonies.
   The quiet 23-year-old, who already has won over the nation with
her shy smile, is to attend 28 hours of classes spread out over the
next month. Many Japanese women also attend classes before getting
married, but for most, flower arrangement, cooking and the tea
ceremony are the popular subjects.
   The palace timed the classes to coincide with spring vacation at
the prestigious Gakushuin University, where Miss Kawashima is a
graduate student of psychology and where her father teaches
economics.
   The briefness of her royal studies _ Empress Michiko's lasted
nearly twice as long _ reflects the omission of English, since she
learned that language while living in the United States as a child.
   And as the wife of Prince Aya, who is second in line to the
throne, less will be required of her than of the woman who marries
Aya's elder brother, Crown Prince Naruhito.
   The government plans to spend roughly $1 million on the June 29
wedding for Miss Kawashima and Aya, who is 24.
   Naruhito has said he would like to marry by the age of 30, but
he will reach that landmark later this month and is having trouble
finding a suitable mate.
   A recent article in a conservative weekly magazine, Shukan
Shincho, expressed fear that because of Miss Kawashima's lack of
noble background, 28 hours will not be enough time to prepare her
for the highly organized and tradition-bound life of a princess.
   Tabloids, meanwhile, have warned Miss Kawashima to be wary of
members of the old nobility, who reportedly have made life in the
palace difficult for Empress Michiko. Michiko, the magazines
report, is seen as an outsider because she was the first commoner
to marry into the royal family.
   Miss Kawashima will be the second.
   But a palace source said changes in the curriculum were made to
suit the times.
   The substitution of constitutional studies for etiquette has
been heralded by Japan's media as a reflection of a promise Emperor
Akihito to uphold the often controversial document. Akihito made
the promise shortly after succeeding Hirohito, who died last year.
   Under the constitution, written mainly by U.S.-led occupation
authorities after World War II, Japan's monarch is a ``symbol''
with little more than a ceremonial role.
   Right-wing extremists, who revere the monarch as a living god,
have demanded that the constitution be rewritten to restore prewar
clauses that referred to the emperor as divine.
   Leftists insist that the postwar basic law should have abolished
the monarchy altogether.

<HEAD>Relief Efforts in Ethiopia Halted by Eritrea Fighting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.N. food relief operations in northern Ethiopia
have been suspended due to the fighting between Eritrean rebels and
government forces around the strategic port of Massawa, an official
said.
   Rebels of the Eritrean People's Liberation Front last week
claimed to have captured control of Massawa, the larger of two
ports on Ethiopia's Red Sea coast.
   Relief organizations ship most of their food aid to Massawa for
eventual distribution by land to northern Ethiopia, where an
estimated 4 million people are afflicted by drought, mostly in the
war-ravaged provinces of Eritrea and Tigre.
   ``We don't know what will happen in the long term,'' said Paul
Mitchell of the Rome-based World Food Program. ``That would only be
speculation.''
   He said WFP headquarters has been unable to make contact with
its 200 staff members in Eritrea in the past few days.
   He said about 50,000 tons of food is currently stored in Massawa
awaiting distribution. About 20,000 tons came from the World Food
Program and the rest from various donors and government
organizations.
   Getting food supplies to drought victims was a problem even
before the new round of fighting began in Massawa, Mitchell said.
   ``It wasn't possible to reach all the people affected, but we
did reach some,'' he said. ``But now this situation has caused, for
the moment, even a suspension of that.''
   Fessahazion Petros, representative of the Eritrean rebels in
Rome, said the group had attacked the port because Ethiopia uses it
to ship arms to government troops in the area.
   He said the rebels, who have been fighting for independence for
their former Italian colony since 1962, could distribute the relief
supplies themselves.
   ``If the food aid has not been destroyed in the fighting, I
think our combatants can distribute it to the population,'' Petros
said.

<TEXT>
   Like an important head of
state, Nelson Mandela has been surrounded by dozens of beefy
bodyguards in smart suits and sunglasses since he emerged from
prison.
   The African National Congress has taken responsibility for
Mandela's safety, publicly rejecting government offers of
assistance. ANC activists have been mobilized to provide security
for Mandela despite short notice and little if any formal training.
   When Mandela addressed a wildly cheering crowd of about 120,000
people on his return Tuesday to his home town of Soweto, he was
guarded by about 30 big, powerful-looking guards. As Mandela called
for a new South Africa, the guards intently watched the crowd with
binoculars for any threat.
   The only sign of government security Tuesday for Mandela was a
group of black municipal police on motorcycles who escorted his
motorcade. Black, green and gold ANC flags fluttered on the police
motorcycles.
   It is an ironic turnabout for the man who until Sunday was
watched over by prison guards. Mandela was released after 27 years
in some of South Africa's toughest jails for fighting the
white-minority government.
   Mandela faces serious threats both from white, right-wing
extremists and from rival black groups unhappy about his more
moderate politics, according to government security officials.
   White extremists have been making threats against Mandela for
years and his safety is a major concern now that he is free, said
the officials, who spoke on condition they not be identified.
   Some 2,000 militants of the neo-Nazi Afrikaner Resistance
Movement, armed with guns, whips and knives, marched through
Pretoria Saturday, yelling, ``Hang Mandela.''
   ``We are going to kill Mandela and all his kind,'' said one man
brandishing a leather whip.
   Some left-wing black groups are reported to be unhappy with
Mandela's desire to end white rule peacefully through negotiation
and South African intelligence has detected possible threats to his
life, the government officials said.
   ANC officials refuse to discuss arrangements for Mandela's
security, saying that would compromise his safety. They also
declined to say where the phalanx of bodyguards came from and
whether or not they are armed.
   But security appears to be a major problem in the scenes of wild
jubilation that greet Mandela wherever he goes. Crowd control
arrangements often break down and one person was killed and scores
injured Sunday in fighting in Cape Town as Mandela made his first
speech after leaving prison.
   ``It has been a real nightmare,'' said a marshall trying to
control the crowd Tuesday in Soweto.
   About 1,000 marshals, young men who belong to groups that
support the ANC, controlled the crowd Tuesday and also were
involved in security. Marshals frisked people and searched vehicles
coming into the stadium.
   Once marshal displayed a pistol and two knives he had taken from
spectators.
   Mandela announced plans Tuesday to visit colleagues in Zambia
and Sweden as soon as possible. There was no word on who will
provide security when Mandela leaves South Africa.

   The Junior Service League of Independence established the award
this year in honor of the former first lady, who was born in
Independence 105 years ago Tuesday.
   The award is intended for women who have chosen a role
appropriate to their time and place in history. Margaret Truman
Daniel, daughter of President and Mrs. Truman, will present the
award in a ceremony May 3 during Truman Week.

<TEXT>
   A woman who pleaded guilty to beating her
22-month-old son to death because of his constant crying received a
life prison sentence and a stinging lecture from the judge.
   ``Perhaps the greatest blessing is that you will not be able to
bear more children,'' Circuit Judge Lynn Tepper told Mary Lee
Collins after her plea Monday to a first-degree murder charge in
the death of her son Joshua.
   Tepper said she reviewed photographs of Joshua's emaciated and
battered body, and told Ms. Collins she thought a jury would likely
have recommended the death penalty had the case gone to trial.
   Ms. Collins will instead spend at least 25 years behind bars
before becoming eligible for parole.
   Later in a jailhouse interview, Ms. Collins maintained she is
not the baby-killer she is made out to be.
   ``I don't want people thinking of me as a monster that killed
her son,'' she said. ``That's not who I am. I love my kids. ... I
don't want anybody to think I'm saying, `Oh I never hurt my kid ...
I was Mother Teresa.' I'm not.''
   When she was arrested for killing Joshua, she already was on
probation for abusing him. His death put the state Department of
Health and Rehabilitative Services under fire for sending Joshua
back to his mother less than a month before he died.
   The case was the first of a series in which children died of
abuse despite being under the supervision of agency caseworkers.
The cases include the much-publicized potty-training death of
2-year-old Bradley McGee of Lakeland last July. His parents face
first-degree murder charges.
   Joshua died from a massive head injury Nov. 25, 1988, just hours
after Ms. Collins gave birth to a third boy.
   The 22-year-old Zephyrhills woman told police she kicked Joshua
two days before he died.
   She told police she had had enough of his constant crying.
   Ms. Collins also received 15 years for child abuse and five
years for probation violation to be served at the same time.

<HEAD>Thousands of Teachers March for Better Pay, Jeer Governor</HEAD>

<DATELINE>OLYMPIA, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Angry teachers boycotted classrooms by the
thousands across the state Tuesday, and staged a mass nighttime
rally in which they jeered Gov. Booth Gardner when he rejected
their call for higher salaries.
   ``This is not the session to talk about additional salaries,''
the Democratic governor told teachers who packed the rotunda of the
state Capitol.
   About 13,000 teachers walked off their jobs in 35 of the state's
296 school districts, giving an estimated 200,000 students a play
day, the Washington Education Association said.
   Teachers are getting a 10 percent pay boost over two years, but
insist that $225 million of a $611 million budget surplus should be
used to double the increase. New state tax revenue estimates to be
released Wednesday are expected to boost the surplus by more than
$100 million.
   Teachers and supporters staged rallies in Seattle, Everett,
Spokane, Vancouver, Tri-Cities, Yakima and elsewhere around the
state. They included another 8,000 teachers who worked all day.
   In most districts, the walkout was cleared with administrators
in advance and the day will be made up at the end of the school
year. But in other schools, some teachers walked off the job and
left their classrooms to substitutes.
   ``I'll be docked $200, but I don't care,'' said Randy Walden, a
social studies teacher at Rogers High School in Puyallup who
traveled to Olympia for the rally. ``We felt so strongly, we walked
out.''
   ``We're tired of promises,'' said another teacher Jeff Page, who
teaches at Lake Stevens High School north of Seattle. ``I've been
teaching 12 years and they keep saying we'll do better when times
are better. Well, Booth has the money and we're still last in
line.''
   In Washington, basic education is fully funded at the state
level, and teachers are paid according to a state salary schedule.
Local property taxes may be used only to pay teachers for extra
duties.
   The average teacher is paid about $31,000 a year, plus a
supplemental contract of about $2,000 and benefits worth about
$9,100, according to the state budget office.
   Senate budget Chairman Dan McDonald, a Republican, said it would
be too dangerous to use one-time windfall revenue as the basis of a
long-term financial obligation.
   Gardner wants to use about one-third of the surplus as a
reserve, one-third for children's programs and one-third for
unexpected agency budget increases.

<TEXT>
   An Italian announcing plans to publish a Japanese
translation of Salman Rushdie's novel ``The Satanic Verses'' was
attacked by an angry Moslem while giving a news conference, police
said.
   Adnan Rashid, a 30-year-old Pakistani, was arrested after trying
to hit publisher Gianni Palma with a microphone at the Foreign
Correspondents Club on Tuesday, a police official said.
   Palma ducked and assailant was subdued by security officers and
journalists covering the news conference, the official said.
   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said another
Pakistani also was arrested after a scuffle broke out nearby.
   After that scuffle, an ambulance was called to treat a slightly
injured woman, said press club manager Nobuyoshi Yamada.
   Raaes Siddiqui, vice president of the Association of Pakistanis
in Japan, said the trouble broke out just before the conference was
to end.
   ``We tried to protest to him that the book blasphemes Islam, and
told him not to challenge 1 billion Moslems around the world,''
Siddiqui said. ``I told him that if he publishes the book, the 1
billion Moslems will not allow him to live.''
   The book is to go on sale this week.
   Many Moslems consider the book's depictions of the prophet
Mohamed and his wives blasphemous and, a year ago, the late Iranian
leader Ayatollah Khomeini called on Moslems to kill Rushdie.
   Rushdie, a naturalized British citizen, has been in hiding since.

   Glenn Close played a scheming marquise
in ``Dangerous Liaisons'' and a dangerously scorned lady in ``Fatal
Attraction,'' but she was the soul of humility during a lampooning
by Harvard students.
   Surrounded by men dressed in drag, Ms. Close paraded through
Harvard Square Tuesday in the back seat of a 1947 Lincoln
Continental convertible as the university's Hasty Pudding
Theatricals made her their 40th Woman of the Year.
   At the Hasty Pudding Theater, theatricals president Michael
Starr and vice president Jon Blackstone began their roast of Ms.
Close's career, which has included five Academy Award nominations.
   ``We tried to call you, you weren't there,'' Blackstone said,
quoting Ms. Close as the character she portrayed in the 1988 film
``Fatal Attraction.''
   ``We hate that,'' Blackstone and Starr said in unison.
   ``After all, we're not going to be ignored, Glenn,'' said
Blackstone, appropriating another line from Close's role in the
film.
   The pair also gave a review of Ms. Close's career, including
recorded quotes from her appearance in the 1970's Broadway hit
``Barnum.''
   Blackstone disappeared briefly backstage to get what he said
would be a sampling of the traditional pudding recipe. But when he
lifted the top from a steaming pot, some rabbit ears popped out,
another gag from ``Fatal Attraction.''
   When it came time for her to honor tradition by delivering a
five-minute, comedic monologue, Ms. Close began beating Blackstone
and Starr with a bouquet of flowers.
   ``We were joking,'' the students said.
   ``You've made a joke about just about everything I could
possibly joke about,'' said Ms. Close.
   Later she said: ``I'm just thrilled to be here, to be part of
this wonderful event, and very, very honored that you considered my
work worthy of Woman of the Year. I actually take it quite
seriously.''
   Past winners include Kathleen Turner, Lucille Ball, Cher, Mamie
Eisenhower and Bette Midler.
   Kevin Costner, star of ``Field of Dreams,'' ``Bull Durham'' and
other films was to be honored as Man of the Year on Feb. 20.

<HEAD>Government to Require More Legible Health Warnings</HEAD>

   Beer cans and liquor bottles soon will bear a
more readable health warning label directed at drivers and pregnant
women.
   The warning has been required since last November but the
initial regulations by the Treasury Department's Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco and Firearms were criticized for allowing use of small,
hard-to-read type.
   So, after receiving 13,000 comments from the public, the ATF is
publishing in the Federal Register today new regulations effective
in nine months designed to make the warning more legible. Breweries
and distilleries unable to meet the deadline may apply for a
120-day extension.
   ``The complaints involved readability and that's what we think
we have resolved with the new regulations,'' Dot Koester, an ATF
spokeswoman, said in an interview.
   ``We're pleasantly surprised,'' said Christine Lubinsky, a
spokeswoman for the National Council on Alcoholism and Drug
Dependence, which mounted a letter-writing campaign among its
members for the changes.
   ``Given what we were seeing on bottles, particularly beer, there
was a real need for the changes because most of labels were really
bad,'' Ms. Lubinsky said. ``There had been some really creative
efforts to make the labels as illegible as possible.''
   ``Obviously our industry will comply with it,'' said James
Sanders, president of the Beer Institute, although it ``will
require changing hundreds of labels on various containers.''
   Labels on many cans and bottles already comply with the new,
``more restrictive'' requirements, Sanders said.
   One change, Ms. Koester said, is a requirement that the words
``GOVERNMENT WARNING'' be printed using both capital letters and
bold type.
   Other changes involve larger type on larger containers and a
limit on the number of characters per inch.
   The warning reads:
   ``GOVERNMENT WARNING: (1) According to the Surgeon General,
women should not drink alcoholic beverages during pregnancy because
of the risk of birth defects. (2) Consumption of alcoholic
beverages impairs your ability to drive a car, to operate machinery
and may cause health problems.''
   Type sizes for one- and two-liter containers remain the same:
one millimeter for capital letters on the former, and two
millimeters _ about the size of newsprint _ on the latter.
   The ATF increased the size of the type on three-liter containers
to 3 millimeters, or about one-eighth inch.
   Ms. Lubinsky said the ATF rejected two other proposed changes
that would require the labels to be placed in a box on the front of
the containers. The regulations permit the warning to be placed
virtually anywhere on a bottle or can.
   Sens. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., and Albert Gore, D-Tenn., were
among those criticizing the initial regulations last November.
   ``It's almost impossible to read,'' Gore had said. ``The ATF has
purposely allowed the industry to come up with a label that is
illegible.''
   Thurmond and Gore said the first part of the warning is
especially necessary because many Americans remain unaware that
alcohol is the leading recognizable cause of mental retardation in
infants.
   Sanders, however, said, ``we still feel that the information in
the message is common knowledge and thus the public won't be
surprised by the information nor will sales be affected.''

<HEAD>Group Backs Limit on Terms in Congress</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While Ronald Reagan criss-crosses the country
speaking for the abolition of the limit on presidential terms, one
of his former White House aides is spearheading a drive to impose
such a limit on members of Congress.
   Former one-term Rep. James K. Coyne of Pennsylvania, who became
a special assistant to then-President Reagan after being defeated
for re-election in 1982, announced the formation of Americans to
Limit Congressional Terms at a news conference on Tuesday.
   The group wants state legislatures to pass resolutions seeking a
constitutional convention to adopt an amendment limiting senators
to two six-year terms and representatives to six two-year terms.
   A similar 12-year limit is proposed in an amendment introduced
in Congress by Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., with the backing of
Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., and others.
   Rep. Bill Frenzel, R-Minn., has introduced a measure in the
House calling for a limit of 20 years, or 10 terms, for House
members and three six-year terms for senators. It is similar to
proposals he has introduced since 1971.
   Meanwhile, the Cato Institute is issuing a study on the subject
and the libertarian think tank's president, Edward H. Crane III,
says he favors a limit of six years, or three terms, for
representatives.
   ``I'd like to see one term in the Senate, but I'm less concerned
about the Senate,'' Crane said in an interview. ``The House is
really the body that is supposed to be closest to the people, most
representative, and therefore should have the highest turnover.''
   As president, Reagan often spoke against the two-term limit on
presidents, imposed by the 22nd Amendment, and said he would like
to campaign for its repeal after he left office.
   At the former president's office in Los Angeles, spokesman Mark
Weinberg said the proposal ``is still part of his standard speech''
but he knew of no organized campaign for repeal.
   Weinberg said Reagan has been asked about proposals to limit
terms of members of Congress and ``has said he believes people
should be allowed to elect whoever they want as often as they
want.''
   Thirty-four state legislatures, or two-thirds of them, must pass
a resolution before a constitutional convention would be called.
Any constitutional amendment approved by a convention, or by
Congress, would require approval of three-fourths of the
legislatures.
   Noting that 98 percent of the House incumbents on the 1988
ballot were re-elected, Coyne said, ``Serving in Congress has
indeed become a career job, one with addictive qualities.''
   Similar arguments often are made by Republicans in their effort
to wrest control from the Democrats, who now dominate both houses
of Congress, but Coyne and others said their movement is bipartisan.
   ``I am not going to stand here and say the Democrats are going
to embrace this,'' said Cleta Mitchell, a former Democratic state
legislator from Oklahoma. However, she said, ``I am convinced this
may be the long-term salvation of the Democratic party and not the
contrary.''
   The group said a poll it commissioned by the Gallup Organization
last year showed 57 percent of Americans favoring the concept, with
34 percent opposed. It said Republicans, Democrats and independents
showed essentially the same level of support.
   The announcement came a day after Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C.,
announced he will seek a seventh term. Thurmond, in a statement
issued by his office, said as long as the Constitution allows
unlimited terms, ``a member's seniority greatly influences both his
effectiveness and ability to meet the needs of the people of his
state.''

<HEAD>Famine Threatens Millions in Africa</HEAD>

   Famine caused by drought and aggravated by
civil wars threatens millions of African peasants and refugees this
year, the Food and Agriculture Organization says.
   The Rome-based U.N. agency said Ethiopia and Sudan in eastern
Africa and Mozambique and Angola in the south urgently need food
assistance.
   It said favorable weather last year led to satisfactory harvests
elsewhere, but 20 countries would need help to distribute food
within their borders or to export surpluses.
   According to an agency report on food supply and crop prospects
in sub-Sahara Africa, Ethiopia needs 1.1 million tons of emergency
food, including 770,000 tons to feed about 4.4 million people in
the stricken north.
   About 685,000 Sudanese and Somali refugees fleeing fighting in
their countries would require the remaining 330,000 tons.
   The report said donors have pledged 400,000 tons to Ethiopia and
there was an ``urgent need to expedite their delivery and for new
allocations.''
   The FAO expressed concern about getting relief food behind rebel
lines in Ethiopia's rebellious Tigre and Eritrea provinces.
   In Mozambique, an estimated 2 million people need 800,000 tons
of food, and only four fifths of the 500,000 tons pledged has
arrived.
   In Sudan, the report said 200,000 tons of emergency food are
needed in southern Equatoria province and its neighbors, Kordofan
and Dafur.
   An estimated 2.6 million Angolans need 300,000 tons of food, and
only 29,000 tons of the pledged 150,000 tons have arrived, the FAO
said.
   Most of the needy there have been displaced by fighting between
the rebel Union for Total Liberation of Angola and the Marxist
government.

   Nothing can reproduce the thrill of the
launch pad, but former astronaut Sally Ride is finding satisfaction
in the quiet of the university campus.
   Ride, America's first woman in space, joined the faculty at
University of California, San Diego, last fall. She teaches physics
and directs the California Space Institute, which coordinates space
research among the state's eight UC campuses.
   Ride said she thrives on hours spent in her research _ the
design of free electron lasers _ and in meeting with students.
   ``It's working out very well because it's giving me a way to
stay involved with the space program and use some of the expertise
and contacts that I developed while I was at NASA.''
   She added: ``I have to admit the only times I'm sorry I left
NASA are the days of shuttle launches and landings.''
   Ride, 38, who holds a doctorate in physics from Stanford
University, was a crew member aboard the 1983 space shuttle
Challenger flight.
   She served on the presidential commission that investigated the
January 1986 Challenger explosion.
   Ride resigned from the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration in 1987 to become a science fellow at Stanford's
Center for International Security and Arms Control.
   She remains a member of two NASA advisory committees, but admits
she gave up some of her influence on the nation's future course in
space when she left NASA.
   ``If you really want to have an impact on the space program and
its direction, you have to work within the system,'' Ride said. ``I
wanted to do physics research again and be associated with a
university.''

   A federal judge dismissed a lawsuit against rock
star David Bowie that claimed he sexually assaulted a fan and told
her he had AIDS after spending the night with her.
   Wanda Lee Nichols said that Bowie assaulted her after inviting
her to his hotel room on Oct. 9, 1987, during a concert tour
stopover in Dallas.
   Bowie conceded he had spent the night with Ms. Nichols, but
denied he had assaulted her. A grand jury declined to indict Bowie
on Nov. 18, 1987.
   Ms. Nichols said she would continue to press for monetary
damages despite the decision by U.S. District Judge Sam Cummings on
Monday.
   Ms. Nichols earlier had asked that Bowie be tested for AIDS,
although her attorney said she tested negative for exposure to the
virus herself. Bowie subsequently tested negative for AIDS.
   Attorney Daniel P. Callahan, who represented Bowie, called Ms.
Nichols' action a ``nuisance suit.''

   Super Bowl MVP Joe Montana is endorsing a new
line of sports shoes and jeans that will put millions in his pocket.
   L.A. Gear Co. plans to release a signature line of men's jeans
called ``The Montana'' this fall. Montana's name also will appear
on cross-training shoes, the company announced Monday.
   Montana's contract is estimated to be worth between $3 million
and $5 million. Entertainer Michael Jackson, former Los Angeles
Lakers star Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Houston Rockets center Akeem
Olajuwon also advertise for L.A. Gear.
   Montana, 33, who led the San Francisco 49ers last month to their
second straight National Football League championship, told
reporters that barring injury, he plans to play four to five more
years.
   ``You never know,'' he said. ``My football career could end
tomorrow.''

   He doesn't have a television, movie
or recording contract, but Tony Orlando keeps belting out the tunes.
   ``The show is part of my heart and soul,'' said Orlando, who is
appearing at the TropWorld Casino this weekend with his group,
Dawn. ``I always try to put in the show some kind of acting moment
where I not only sing but bring the song alive.''
   ``My first hit was in 1961, `Halfway to Paradise.' That's going
on 29 years ago and I'm still here,'' said Orlando, 45.
   Orlando's professional career began when he was 15 and Don
Kirshner hired him to sing demos in a New York City office that
represented the likes of Bobby Darin, Neil Diamond, and Phil
Spector.
   In 1972, Orlando recruited Telma Hopkins and Joyce Vincent to go
on the road with him as Dawn.
   The group had hits with ``Gypsy Rose,'' ``He Don't Love You,''
and ``Tie a Yellow Ribbon.'' Their TV variety show aired from 1973
to 1977.
   Hopkins has been replaced by Vincent's sister, Pam Vincent, in
the current incarnation of the group.

   Nelson Mandela says whites who
abandon apartheid will be welcome in the non-racist South Africa he
seeks to build, and some have already made the transition.
   Terry Soller, a 26-year-old white, sang and danced Tuesday along
with the 120,000-strong, mostly black crowd that welcomed the
African National Congress leader back to his hometown of Soweto
after 27 years in prison.
   ``This is the first time I've felt part of the future of this
country,'' said Ms. Soller. ``We are all Africans.''
   She waited for hours to get a glimpse of Mandela, and her
T-shirt expressed her support for his movement: ``ANC Lives, ANC
Leads.''
   There were several hundred whites scattered among the crowd
Tuesday at Soccer City, the stadium on the edge of Soweto, the huge
black township outside Johannesburg.
   Soweto is less than 12 miles from Johannesburg and the residents
are quick to offer their friendship to white visitors. But the
overwhelming majority of whites in Johannesburg have never seen
Soweto, and they know little about the circumstances of the 2.5
million people there.
   There are, however, growing numbers of whites who reject
apartheid and sympathize with, or even embrace, black-led
organizations.
   The anti-apartheid Democractic Party won slightly more than 20
percent of the vote in last year's white elections and most leading
opposition groups, including the ANC, have some white members.
   ``This is an amazing experience,'' said Pippa Kapelus, 27. ``We
have got to be exposed to this. We are just as much part of the
history of this country as anyone else in this stadium.''
   Most of the whites who identify with black organizations are of
English descent and live in the cities. However, some Afrikaners,
the Dutch-descended settlers who control the government and account
for about 3 million of South Africa's 5 million whites, also are
joining in.

   A business airplane crashed in a wooded
field in this city Tuesday evening, killing the two people aboard
and narrowly missing several homes, officials said.
   The eight-seat Beech King Air twin-engine turboprop went down
about a mile from Interstate 85 around 6:30 p.m., said police Sgt.
Vickie Saunders.
   The Holt Manufacturing Co. plane was en route from New York to
Burlington Municipal Airport when it crashed, officials said. An
earlier report had said the craft was a commuter plane.
   The plane went down in a field about 150 feet across the street
from a row of houses, said an official with Alamance County
Emergency Management who refused to give his name. The aircraft did
not burn on impact.
   Killed were Frank S. Holt Jr., 52, president and treasurer of
the textile manufacturing company, and pilot Bill McBride of
Greensboro, said police Lt. Jim Fender. McBride was in his late 30s
or early 40s.
   The flight had gone smoothly, and the plane had been cleared to
land when it suddenly crashed about three miles from the airport,
officials said.
   ``I thought it was a glider or something because I didn't hear
any noise. The propellers were not turning,''said Greg Booker, 17,
who lives in an apartment complex near the crash site.
   ``The plane started making noises like it was out of gas or
something,'' said another witness, Tamica Vanhook, 12. ``I screamed
and fell on the ground and looked up and saw the plane flying
sideways and making noises. Then it hit.''
   Booker said the plane appeared to attempt a turn. ``Instead of
turning, it went into a nose dive. It hit the ground, we heard a
boom and that was it.''
   He and another witness, Efrem Mitchell, 18, said the nose of the
plane and one wing had broken off.
   ``The pilot had blood everywhere. He appeared to be dead at the
scene,'' Booker said.
   Police Lt. Jim Fender said the plane apparently left Burlington
in the morning for New York and was returning to North Carolina. He
said the National Transportation Safety Board was expected on the
scene shortly.
   Holt, a textile manufacturing company based in Burlington, would
not confirm whether its plane was involved in the crash, said a
company official who refused to give his name.
   Burlington is nearly 20 miles east of Greensboro.

   U.S.-controlled Pacific islands are convenient
gateways to the United States for heroin and other drugs from Asia
and the southwest Pacific, and the mail often is the last link in
the smuggling chain, a government document says.
   Federal drug interdiction on the islands is virtually
non-existent because of manpower shortages and cuts in anti-drug
aid to the local governments, according to an internal Interior
Department report and interviews with government officials.
   ``Access to the U.S. postal and transportation system often
contribute to making these U.S. islands transshipment points for
illegal drugs,'' said the Interior document, calling the islands
``major concerns with regard to drug trafficking.''
   In American Samoa, for example, commercial fishing boats bring
in marijuana and heroin from Australia and other Pacific nations
for mailing to U.S. residents, said the report, obtained this week
through the Freedom of Information Act.
   A local official said the island's greatest drug problem was
with marijuana, and although use of the port for heroin smuggling
has long been suspected, there has never been a heroin seizure.
   ``We hear about (heroin) from intelligence sources, but we have
nothing concrete,'' said Michael Sala, deputy public safety
commissioner in American Samoa and executive director of a regional
law enforcement organization.
   The Drug Enforcement Administration has just one agent
responsible for the four Pacific jurisdictions _ American Samoa,
the Northern Mariana Islands, Palau and Guam. The agent is based in
Guam.
   ``There is a need for additional agents,'' the report said.
   American Samoa, Guam and the Virgin Islands, a Caribbean
territory also cited in the report, are U.S. territories; the
Northern Marianas and Palau have compacts of free association with
the United States that include Interior Department assistance.
   ``Nobody knows how much'' drugs are smuggled through the
islands, said Larry L. Morgan, director of legislative and public
affairs for Interior's territorial and international affairs
branch. ``But from our perspective it's a serious problem.''
   DEA officials concurred the area was ripe for smuggling,
although one said he believed a significant dent was made late last
year in heroin traffic through Palau and Guam.
   A DEA spokesman, Ralph Lochridge, said the area was unlikely to
get additional DEA personnel soon because other areas, particularly
South America and Mexico, have been deemed higher priorities for
interdiction efforts.
   ``If you only have so many bodies, it's a matter of priorities _
you've got to get the most bang for your buck,'' said Lochridge,
who is based in Los Angeles, the office that supervises Guam.
``Obviously if we had more agents we'd increase our staffing
everywhere.''
   Aid for local drug enforcement in the four Pacific jurisdictions
was cut by nearly $1 million in the drug law passed by Congress in
1988.
   Sala, in a telephone interview, said the cutbacks forced island
governments to scale back their plans. ``When all of a sudden
things are cut you cannot expect miracles,'' he said.
   President Bush included the Interior Department's request to
restore the $1 million in his proposed fiscal 1991 budget.
   The report praised local governments for developing anti-drug
plans but said those efforts have been hurt by shortages in money,
equipment and people.
   Enforcement in the Virgin Islands is not as big a problem
because of DEA help from Puerto Rico and Miami, according to law
enforcement officials.
   The Bush administration's revised drug war strategy, issued last
month, made no direct reference to the use of the four island
nations for smuggling. But it said more broadly that the Pacific
Ocean ``is virtually unrestricted for maritime smuggling, and
relying on random patrols in such a vast body of water is
inefficient and ineffective.''
   Because of that, the report said, interdiction depends heavily
on intelligence and inspections of ships when they reach U.S. ports.
   The source of the U.S.-bound drugs entering Guam usually is
Asia, with Palau often serving as a stop before Guam, the report
said.
   ``This heroin has been found in some cases to be 60 percent
pure,'' it said.
   The report also said drug use is increasingly blamed for local
problems, particularly in the Virgin Islands.
   In those islands, identified as a transshipment point for South
American cocaine bound for the United States and elsewhere,
``widespread addiction to crack in numerous housing projects exists
and has led to increasing violence and crime. ... (The) number of
murders, many directly involving the sale and use of narcotics,
tripled last year.''

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: From Wimp to Macho Man</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush clearly relishes his
metamorphosis from wimp to what he calls ``macho man,'' even though
he insists his trip Thursday to violence-torn Colombia should not
be seen as an act of bravado.
   ``I'm not going to do something stupid or macho,'' Bush
reassured a recent audience.
   Although White House officials claim the president has no
surprises up his sleeve for the drug summit, even these assurances
are being greeted with some skepticism. Bush in the past has proven
adept at springing forth with surprise proposals and agendas.
   His decision to ignore the concerns expressed by top aides and
to attend the four-nation conference in Cartagena, Colombia, is
just the latest in a series of bold strokes taken by a president
who at times has been criticized by Democrats as being overly
cautious.
   Bush says his decision to go to Cartagena, amid what may be the
tightest military and Secret Service security ever assembled for a
U.S. president, is an important symbolic gesture of solidarity with
host president Virgilio Barco in his fight against the Colombian
drug cartels.
   It's been nearly two years since anyone seriously leveled the
``W'' word at Bush, but putting to rest the old ``wimp factor'' is
still a recurring theme in the president's off-the-cuff remarks.
   ``I love this,'' he told the Commonwealth Club in San Francisco
last week. ``The guy they used to call timid is now macho man or
something.''
   And last December, the day after his storm-tossed Mediterranean
summit with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, Bush was asked
at a news conference if it hadn't been too risky for him to venture
out in a small boat.
   ``Don't tell me that that little chop was risking anything.
Frankly, I haven't had that much fun in a long time. ... It was
sheer pleasure,'' said the president.
   ``You know these charismatic, macho, visionary guys. They'll do
anything,'' he said.
   On an $11 dare from his grandchildren, Bush stripped to his
trousers last August and jumped into the chilly Atlantic from the
pier at his oceanfront home in Kennebunkport, Maine.
   He fishes and boats in driving rainstorms, races through games
of golf, jogs in all kinds of weather and otherwise keeps up a
wearying pace that has taken him so far to 35 states and 15
countries.
   On the policy front, Bush also has been known for sudden,
preemptive strikes: his decision to invade Panama, his secret
dispatching of top aides to China, his springing of a major troop
reduction proposal at last May's NATO summit, and a further
unexpected call for troop reductions in last month's State of the
Union address.
   The ``wimp factor'' dogged Bush early in his presidential
effort. Long operating in the shadow of President Reagan, Bush had
become the classic No. 2 man and came across to many as a bland
figure given to gaffes and sometimes prissy remarks.
   And, although the image did not follow Bush into the general
election, on the campaign trail he was always reliving the
``tension city'' of his on-air combat with CBS anchorman Dan Rather
in early 1988 _ which some political analysts saw as a defining
event of the campaign, one that helped dispel the ``wimp'' tag.
   And the vice presidential candidate who in 1984 was raked over
the coals by women's groups for bragging about having ``kicked a
little'' of Democratic opponent Geraldine Ferraro's behind, is
still adept at showing flashes of verbal machismo.
   Last week, after climbing into the cockpit of a B-1 bomber, Bush
addressed forces of the U.S. Strategic Air Command by radio and

<HEAD>Two Ministers Resign, Reducing Communists In Coalition Government</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Vaclav Havel has
replaced two Cabinet ministers, reducing the number of Communists
in the coalition government to three out of 20, the official CTK
news agency said.
   Slavomir Stracar, who has the support of the Slovak group
``Public Against Violence,'' was appointed head the Ministry of
Metallurgy, Engineering and Electrical Engineering on Tuesday.
   The Slovak group is a sister organization to the ``Civic
Forum,'' the opposition group that spearheaded the peaceful
November revolution and is considered to wield the most political
power in Czechoslovakia.
   Stracar replaces Ladislav Vodrazka, a Communist Party member and
one of the holdovers from the Communist-dominated government ousted
in December.
   Jaroslav Suva, a Communist, becomes chief of the Fuel and Energy
Ministry, an area where most reform aimed at streamlining outdated
and overgrown heavy industry is expected. He replaces Communist
Frantisek Pinc.
   ``Vodrazka and Pinc in fact resigned already last week, but
their resignations were accepted only today,'' Ivana Rezkova of the
government press office said in an interview.
   Despite demands by several hundred demonstrators last week for
the ouster of one of the government's oldest Communist hard-liners,
reports proved false that Transport Minister Frantisek Podlena
might also resign.
   ``Podlena has not resigned and is still a member of the
government,`` Ms. Rezkova said.

   The White House says ``all is calm'' at the
U.S. Information Agency, but only after administration officials
stepped in to restore order in a struggle with the Voice of America.
   The dispute that saw USIA director Bruce Gelb try to fire VOA
Director Richard Carlson was resolved with the VOA saying it will
try to keep broadcasting the six language services it ordered cut
two weeks ago because of a budget crunch.
   VOA, the government's radio network which is under USIA control,
had said it would fire 57 people and trim $3 million from its
budget by cutting its Uzbek, Swahili, Lao, Slovenian, Greek and
Turkish services.
   Officials of USIA and VOA are trying to deal with a budget
crunch that has left the radio network with a budget of about $170
million annually but growing operating costs.
   The decision to cut the six services was approved by Gelb with a
signature, ``but he wasn't comfortable with it,'' said Gelb's
spokesman, Frank Johnson.
   Johnson said Gelb was out of town the day Carlson announced the
decision two weeks ago.
   When Gelb returned and read news accounts of the decision, ``he
was very upset,'' said a senior USIA official who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Gelb convened the top agency officials and he ``went wild,''
according to a participant at the meeting. ``He claimed he knew
nothing about it (the decision). He was almost hysterical. He
claimed we tricked him,'' said the source, who also spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   Gelb suggested money be taken from VOA's construction account to
save the six language services, said Johnson.
   But senior aides objected said that budget already was squeezed
and Carlson said Congress already had rejected such a solution.
   Gelb berated Carlson for failing to support him and told the VOA
chief last Thursday he was fired, the source said.
   Gelb also told aides to cancel Carlson's departure for Israel on
Sunday for talks with Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir about the
controversial construction of a $300 million VOA transmitter, the
source said. Environmentalists object to the project, which would
amplify U.S. transmissions to the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.
   White House personnel chief Chase Untermeyer met with Gelb and
Carlson and said Tuesday, ``All is calm at USIA'' since the
meetings. The White House moved in because both men are
presidential appointees approved by the Senate.
   Gelb is a friend of President Bush and a campaign fundraiser.
Carlson was held over from the Reagan administration, ``proof that
he has our support,'' said Untermeyer.
   ``It was agreed they would try and work out their differences,''
said another source.
   ``Gelb and Carlson enjoy a professional and worklike
relationship,'' Johnson said.
   Carlson left for Israel on Tuesday, meeting with VOA employees
before his departure to address rumors that he'd been fired. ``He
has not resigned and he has not been fired,'' said VOA spokeswoman
Beth Knisely.

   Global crop watchers say there are some
disturbing similarities in some of the major breadbasket areas of
the United States and Soviet Union.
   The government's Joint Agricultural Weather Facility said
Tuesday that dry soil conditions and lack of snow cover in parts of
the Great Plains continue to threaten the winter wheat crop.
   The same goes for parts of the Soviet winter wheat area.
   ``Portions of the southern Great Plains received some moisture
but more was needed,'' the report said. ``Most of the central and
northern Great Plains remained dry, but above normal temperatures
helped to maintain crop condition.''
   In its international section, the report said January brought
above normal precipitation in the Baltic states, Belorussia,
Central Region, Volga Vyatsk, western Black Soils Region, the
eastern Ukraine and parts of the North Caucasus.
   ``In contrast, there was below normal precipitation in the
western and southern Ukraine, the eastern Black Soils region and
the Volga,'' the report said. ``Unusually mild weather covered the
entire region during most of January.''
   Although the warm weather ``provided generally favorable
conditions for winter grain,'' it left crop areas over a wide
expanse of the Soviet Union ``without a protective snow cover and
caused winter grains to lose hardiness, making them more
susceptible to potential winterkill.''
   In assessing the U.S. situation, the report noted ``lack of snow
cover has left the (winter wheat) crop vulnerable to freeze
damage.''
   The facility is operated by the departments of agriculture and
commerce. The weekly reports cover soil and crop conditions but do
not project yields.
   Looking at some other crops, the report said the sugarcane
harvest continued in Florida, but ``unseasonably hot, dry weather
forced citrus producers to continue irrigating.''
   The warm weather also continued over the major Florida vegetable
areas where spring plantings were under way.
   In Georgia, tobacco plant beds were reported in ``good to
excellent'' condition and that North Carolina farmers continued to
seed their beds.
   ``Rain and wet field conditions again limited field work in the
Delta,'' the report said. ``Land preparation for the 1990 cotton
crop continued in Arizona and California.''
   Livestock pastures were helped by rain and mild temperatures in
the Delta and Southeast, the report said.
   ``In the Great Plains and Corn Belt, mild temperatures and the
lack of snow cover reduced the amount of supplemental feeding
necessary (for livestock),'' the report said. ``Mild weather
provided ideal conditions for calving, which was under way in many
areas.''

   China and the United States lead the world in
grain production, but their mix of crops is significantly
different, according to an Agriculture Department report.
   Total U.S. grain output in the 1989-90 season is estimated at
281.8 million metric tons, second only to China's 307.6 million
tons, according to the department's Foreign Agricultural Service.
   A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equivalent to 36.7
bushels of wheat or 39.4 bushels of corn.
   China's wheat production of 91 million tons leads the world,
edging the Soviet Union's 90.5 million tons, while U.S. output was
55.4 million tons. India was close behind the United States with 54
million tons.
   It is in the category of ``coarse grains,'' however, that U.S.
muscle pulls ahead. Those include corn, oats, barley, sorghum and
rye. Total U.S. production was 221.4 million tons, more than double
the Soviet Union's 107 million tons, which ranked second.
   China's coarse grain output was 91.3 million tons. But China led
in rice, with 125.3 million tons, milled equivalent, against 4.9
million tons for the United States and 1.8 million for the Soviet
Union.

   Italians are hooked on American walnuts, even
as their own production rises, according to an Agriculture
Department report.
   ``Although Italy produces walnuts, they are a smaller variety
than the large California variety the United States exports,'' the
report said. ``An increase in Italy's production this year is not
expected to affect the import level, since consumers prefer the
larger-sized imports.''
   The United States provides about 92 percent of the walnuts
imported by Italy, said the report, which was written by Frank J.
Piason, U.S. agricultural counselor in Rome.
   Walnuts are eaten by Italians at the end of meals, particularly
during the Christmas season, and are ``increasingly consumed as a
snack food and used in confectionery products,'' he said.

<HEAD>``Videos'' Soar, Elvis Snores In Ratings</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   ``The Cosby Show'' took the top of the A.C.
Nielsen Co. ratings and two mid-season newcomers, ``Elvis'' and
``The Bradys,'' failed to leave viewers all shook up.
   In the second week of February's sweeps period, ABC's
``America's Funniest Home Videos'' took fifth place at the expense
of the long-running ``Murder, She Wrote'' on CBS, also under attack
by Fox's best-rated ``The Simpsons.''
   ``Murder, She Wrote'' finished 15th last week. In most markets
it faces the ABC video show for its first half and the cartoon
family from Fox in its second. ``The Simpsons'' was rated No. 32 _
the highest ``fourth network'' numbers for the week.
   Here are last week's top 10 prime-time shows: ``The Cosby
Show,'' NBC; ``Cheers,'' NBC; ``Roseanne,'' ABC; ``A Different
World,'' NBC; ``America's Funniest Home Videos,'' ABC; ``Golden
Girls,'' NBC; ``The Wonder Years,'' ABC; ``The NBC Sunday Night
Movie: Blind Faith, Part 1,'' NBC; ``Who's the Boss?'' ABC; ``60
Minutes,'' CBS.
   NBC once again dominated, scoring an average prime-time rating
of 14.7, followed by ABC's 13.2 and CBS' 12.5.
   Networks try to clean up during sweeps weeks because advertising
rates are based on ratings during those periods.
   NBC leads for the season, with a 14.8 average to ABC's 13.0 and
CBS' 12.3.
   Each ratings point represents the percentage of the nation's
92.1 million television homes tuned into a show.
   ``America's Funniest Home Videos,'' first broadcast Jan. 14,
relies on home videos contributed by viewers. The show ``is
attracting very sizable numbers of all the key demographic groups
of 18 to 49, as well as kids and teens,'' said ABC director of
prime-time audience analysis Larry Hayns.
   ``It's the type of show that people can tune into at any time.
... You don't really have to get involved in characters and plot
line, there'll be another video any second.''
   There were two ``Elvis'' sightings on ABC last week, but neither
a special showing Tuesday night following ``Roseanne'' nor a
broadcast in its regular 8:30 p.m. Sunday slot yielded impressive
figures.
   ``Elvis'' on Tuesday had a 16.0 rating for 20th place, but
``Roseanne'' had a 22.5 rating in the earlier time slot.
   For Sunday, the series about the early life of ``The King of
Rock 'n' Roll'' had a 12.6 rating and 47th place even though it
followed ``America's Funniest Home Videos,'' which garnered a 21.4
rating. The network wants to build a ratings block with the video
show and ``Elvis,'' a musical drama.
   ``The Bradys,'' with most of the cast from the original ``The
Brady Bunch,'' moved back into the television neighborhood on CBS
with a two-hour movie Friday night to introduce new generations and
situations.
   ``The Bradys,'' with an overall ratings average of 12.7, claimed
the No. 44 spot in the lineup.
   In head-to-head faceoff, Valerie Harper's new CBS show ``City''
tied for 54th place while her former show ``The Hogan Family'' on
NBC, finished in a tie for 32nd.
   Among the evening news shows, ABC was in first place with 11.0,
CBS followed with 9.9 and NBC had 9.6.

<HEAD>Woman Chooses Jail Over Testifying on Barry</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD KEIL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman who sources say had a personal
relationship with Mayor Marion Barry is staying in jail rather than
testify before a federal grand jury investigating alleged drug use
by the mayor.
   U.S. District Judge John Garrett Penn ordered Maria McCarthy of
Greensboro, N.C., jailed for civil contempt of court after she
refused to testify Tuesday, said her attorney, Leslie Scherr.
   Penn granted McCarthy immunity from prosecution after she
initially refused to testify Tuesday, but she still wouldn't talk
to the grand jury and was sent to jail, Scherr said.
   Prosecutors are reportedly close to requesting the grand jury to
indict Barry, who was arrested Jan. 18 on a cocaine possession
charge, on new charges. Scherr said McCarthy told him, ``I have to
live with myself, whether he was a friend or enemy, we had a
relationship that doesn't need public scrutiny.''
   The attorney wouldn't tell reporters whether McCarthy was
referring to Barry, but two city government sources familiar with
Barry's social life said Barry and McCarthy had a personal
relationship.
   ``It's not really loyalty'' that kept her from testifying, said
Scherr, ``but some kind of moral code she lives by.''
   Scherr said McCarthy knows Rasheeda Moore, the woman who
cooperated in the FBI sting operation that resulted in Barry's
arrest at a Washington hotel. Scherr declined to comment further on
McCarthy's relationship with Moore or the mayor.
   Under law, McCarthy can be held in jail as long as the grand
jury hearing evidence in the case remains in session. Grand juries
are normally empaneled for 18 months at a time, but can be extended
if the case continues.
   The grand jury is investigating Barry's ties to former city
employee Charles Lewis, who has cooperated with the panel after
pleading guilty to two cocaine conspiracy charges. Lewis, who has
also been convicted of cocaine distribution charges in his native
Virgin Islands, testified in open court that he supplied Barry with
crack cocaine.
   Barry, who is enrolled in a Florida substance abuse treatment
center, has denied using drugs with Lewis.
   The federal probe began in December 1988 after city police
aborted an undercover drug purchase from Lewis when they learned
Barry was in Lewis' downtown Washington hotel room.
   McCarthy is the second woman jailed for refusing to testify
about Barry. Convicted cocaine dealer Karen Johnson served eight
months in jail in 1984 after refusing to tell authorities whether
she gave drugs to Barry or who her drug supplier was.
   Scherr said that as far as he knew, McCarthy had no contracts
with the city government or any involvement in companies doing
business with the city.

<TEXT>
   An environmental activist preparing to begin a
White House policy job isn't getting the post because of what he
says are ``strong forces within the administration'' and Congress.
   Dan W. Reicher, a senior attorney with the Natural Resources
Defense Council, a liberal environmental group, said he was told
his appointment was being canceled Tuesday, the same day The
Washington Post reported he was taking the job.
   ``I was canned this morning ... a week and a half before
starting,'' Reicher said. He said he had been told he would begin
Feb. 26 as assistant deputy counsel for the Council on
Environmental Quality.
   Reicher has criticized Bush and Reagan administration efforts to
comply with federal environmental laws, particularly in the cleanup
of problems at nuclear weapons production facilities.
   He said pressure from ``strong forces within the administration
and on Capitol Hill'' prompted council Chairman Michael R. Deland
to reverse his decision to hire him.
   Deland, Bush's appointee as chairman of the council, said he
decided not to hire Reicher after realizing ``the degree to which
he's perceived to be a persistent critic of the administration.''
   ``It was my decision, my decision alone,'' Deland said. ``I have
apologized to Dan.''
   White House spokesman Steve Hart denied there was any White
House pressure applied to Deland against the appointment.
   ``It was Deland's decision,'' Hart said. ``It was a policy
difference that he felt could not be rectified to a satisfactory
point.''
   Reports last week said there was a serious internal dispute in
the White House over environmental policy after White House chief
of staff John Sununu softened a Bush speech on global warming.
   National Audubon Society vice president Brooks Yeager said the
Reicher move raises more questions about the administration's
commitment on the environment.
   ``We're a little bit concerned that if someone with his
knowledge and his integrity can't sustain political scrutiny within
the administration ... a lot of high sounding promises made to us
by the administration don't mean a lot,'' he said.
   The Council on Environmental Quality diminished in size and
importance under the Reagan administration, but environmentalists
said they were promised by the Bush administration that it would be
upgraded.

<HEAD>Foundation Seeks U.S., Soviet Cooperation on Missile Prevention</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The world's two nuclear superpowers should
move to prevent the accidental or unauthorized launch of nuclear
weapons by placing sensors in each other's missile fields and
destruct systems on strategic missiles, a U.S.-Soviet foundation
says.
   The proposal Tuesday by the Moscow-based International
Foundation for the Survival and Development of Humanity _ founded
by the late Soviet physicist and political activist Andrei Sakharov
_ was made as an alternative to the Strategic Defense Initiative
under research by the United States.
   The foundation's report has been submitted to Rep. Les Aspin,
D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, together
with the proposal that its recommendations be debated jointly by
the House panel and the Supreme Soviet's defense committee.
   Former President Reagan billed Star Wars, as SDI is informally
called, as a continent-spanning protective umbrella to foil a
Soviet missile attack, but the Bush administration endorses a more
modest research concept.
   Although tensions between Washington and Moscow are being
sharply reduced, some administration officials maintain a missile
defense system could fend off a missile launched by accident or
fired by terrorists or a hostile Third World nation.
   Andrei Kokoshkin, deputy director of the Soviet Institute of USA
and Canadian studies, said at a news conference Tuesday that the
report is aimed at countering this argument for Star Wars.
   At the Pentagon, an official who commented on condition he not
be identified, said some of the report's recommendations could be
discussed at arms control negotiations.
   But he said the United States already has in place a range of
effective measures designed to prevent accidental or unauthorized
launches of nuclear weapons.
   And he said there are legitimate concerns a radical Third World
nation could develop or obtain nuclear weapons and launchers.
Existing technology probably could fashion a defense against a
nuclear attack on the United States by such a state, even though
the means are not in hand to counter a full-scale Soviet missile
attack.
   The report says installing sensors on the missile silos and
launchers of each side would eliminate the danger that a missile
strike could be launched because of a false alarm.
   ``The sensor systems would continually transmit pre-programmed,
continually changing coded signals via relay sensors as long as no
missiles were launched and the sensors were not tampered with,'' it
said.
   It said if an early-warning satellite or radar indicated an
enemy missile was launched, ``the absence of a corresponding
indication from the sensors would be evidence that the warning was
a false alarm.''
   The report also called for greater central controls over nuclear
weapons, including installation of so-called permissive action
links on nuclear weapons to prevent their use without secret
authorization codes.
   The Pentagon official said most new U.S. nuclear weapons have
such devices.
   The authors of the report called on both the United States and
the Soviet Union to begin urgent studies by all the nuclear powers
on the possibility of placing destruct devices on ballistic
missiles to destroy or disarm them before they hit their targets.
   This would enable the destruction of a missile launched by
mistake or without proper authority.
   The Pentagon official said the United States did not put
destruct devices on ballistic missiles because their reliability
was uncertain.
   ``I think it is easier to prevent something from being launched
than to destroy it after it is already gone,'' he said.

<HEAD>Keating Official Says Regulators Were ``Playing Games'' With
Thrift</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The chief aide to Phoenix millionaire Charles
H. Keating Jr. describes federal regulators who seized Keating's
Lincoln Savings and Loan Association last year as ``kids playing
games.''
   Testifying on Keating's suit to overturn the takeover of the
$5.5 billion S&amp;L last April, Judith Wischer said the government put
junior auditors in charge of reviewing the thrift's assets when
Keating was trying to sell the institution in late 1988 and early
1989.
   ``We found that at this very serious time in our lives, we were
assigned to kids who were playing games with us,'' Mrs. Wischer,
president of Lincoln's parent company, American Continental Corp.,
said in U.S. District Court Tuesday. ``But they had the upper
hand.''
   For several hours Tuesday as Keating sat with his attorneys in
the courtroom, Mrs. Wischer recounted with frustration various
events between 1985 and the government takeover of Lincoln four
years later in what she described as an ``escalating battle of
experts.''
   In May 1988, when American Continental and the bank board signed
a ``memorandum of understanding'' calling for a new audit, she
said, ``We thought for the first time since that we had a
settlement ... that was binding on both sides.''
   That memorandum was widely criticized in hearings before the
House Banking Committee last fall. Among the provisions was the
removal of jurisdiction over Lincoln from San Francisco regulators
who in May 1987 recommended seizing the thrift then.
   Regulators now in charge of the S&amp;L bailout contend the two-year
delay in closing Lincoln could cost taxpayers up to $2 billion.
   Only four months after signing the May 1988 memorandum, however,
Lincoln officials became disillusioned again when regulators raised
new complaints about tax-sharing and other agreements that had been
approved earlier, Mrs. Wischer said.
   ``We became very, very scared after that meeting,'' she said. As
regulators began imposing new supervisory order on Lincoln, ``it
got to be that the only thing we could do was open the branches in
the morning and close them at night,'' she added.
   As a result, Mrs. Wischer said, Keating and his top advisers
concluded they could never operate Lincoln successfully because of
what he and some bank board officials have called a vendetta
against them.
   American Continental later pursued three different deals for
leveraged buyouts of Lincoln but all were disapproved by
regulators, who concluded little real new capital was being
invested in each.
   In addition to a bankruptcy court proceeding over American
Continental, Keating is now embroiled in several lawsuits, as both
a plaintiff and defendant, with the government and investors in his
enterprise.
   Besides the suit here seeking recovery of Lincoln, he is suing
the government in federal court in Phoenix on charges of illegally
leaking confidential information about the thrift in 1986 and 1987.
   The government has named Keating, Mrs. Wischer and other
American Continental officials in a civil suit seeking $1.1 billion
on charges of fraud and racketeering in their operation of Lincoln.
   Keating also is under criminal investigation by a federal grand
jury in Los Angeles, according to regulators.
   And he is the focal point of a congressional ethics scandal
involving five senators for whom he raised $1.3 million in
political contributions and who, in turn, interceded on Lincoln's
behalf with federal regulators in 1987.

   Residents of this tiny, trendy ski resort
town on Tuesday rejected by nearly 2-1 an ordinance that would have
made it the nation's first furrier-free zone.
   With all eight precincts counted, the fur-ban ordinance lost,
1,701 to 898.
   Residents also voted for growth, defeating by 1,561 to 1,051 a
measure to reduce the size of a luxury hotel by 25 percent, and
approving measures to widen the highway leading into town and a
bond measure to build employee housing.
   ``People seem more concerned with business and monetary gain
than other values,'' said Katharine Thalberg, who with her husband,
Mayor Bill Stirling, led the fight for the fur ban.
   ``They want a larger hotel, a bigger highway ... there does seem
to be a value shift here in town,'' she said.
   Revillon Furs manager Mark Kirkland said, ``The big winners are
the people of Aspen. We can get back to business and welcome our
guests back who've been staying away because of all this.''
   The election, which drew international attention, attracted
about 70 percent of Aspen's 3,700 registered voters, said City
Clerk Kathryn Koch.
   Like ski lifts, there was a 20-minute wait at polling places,
deputy city clerk Kathy Strickland said earlier.
   ``We had three booths at the precincts last time, and now we
have four, and they still are waiting in line. ... So the turnout
is going to be good,'' she said.
   The chief growth-and-development measure was the one on whether
to stop construction of the $70 million luxury hotel and build in
its place a smaller one favored by the City Council,
   Other ballot measures were tied to the dilemma of growth in the
celebrity haven _ a picturesque town fat with wealthy buyers and
short on building space.
   Voters approved a widening of Colorado 82 into Aspen from two
lanes to four and a straight route into town over an ``s'' curve.
The highway carries more than 22,000 cars a day, according to state
figures.
   Several ballot proposals involved employee housing.
   Most shop, government and ski slope workers cannot afford to
live in Aspen, where the average single home sold for more than $1
million in 1989.
   Voters approved 1,363 to 1,203 an ordinance to raise the city's
sales tax by 0.45 of a cent, bringing the total sales tax to 7.9
percent, in order to finance affordable housing and day care.
   The fur fight polarized the town, with Stirling and his wife
leading animal-rights activists in demanding the ban and furriers
leading the charge against it, claiming it would drive away
tourists.
   Some considered the election a dress rehearsal for a March 13
recall election for Stirling and three other members of the city
council.
   The fur issue drew national and international attention.
   ``The real issue is whether it is all right to kill animals to
make fur coats,'' said Katharine Thalberg, co-founder of the Aspen
Society for Animal Rights.
   Thalberg believes fur sales amount to making profits on cruelty
to animals. Opponents, led by fur retailers, framed it as a freedom
of choice issue, saying the government should not tell people what
to wear or not wear.
   The small old mining town has four fur shops, and more than 100
other businesses also sell furs.
   Financial disclosure statements showed the various special
interest groups had spent about $250,000 _ $67 per voter.
   The other big attention-getter on the ballot was the proposal to
reduce the size of the luxury hotel already under construction. The
developer, Mohamed Hadid, purchased the land from New York
billionaire developer Donald Trump.
   Hadid planned a 292-room, 66-foot-tall building.
   Stirling and his supporters on the council, spurred by
complaints that the hotel would block views of Aspen Mountain's ski
slopes and would just be too big for the town space and services,
wanted to scale it back by 25 percent, and down to 44 feet high.
   Hadid's spokesmen said the council approved the project in
November 1988 and should not be changing the rules while
construction is under way.
   Trump re-entered the fray in the weeks preceding the election,
reminding people he sold the land because the town would not let
him build a hotel the size he wanted _ which would have been close
to the Council proposal.

<HEAD>US-Soviet Trade Agreement Possible by June</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   U.S. and Soviet trade negotiators, working
under orders to wipe away nearly a half-century of trade friction
between the two superpowers, say they are on schedule to get the
job done by June.
   Both sides expressed satisfaction with the progress made after
an initial two days of talks aimed at drawing up a treaty to
normalize trade between the two nations.
   President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev would
like to sign such an agreement at their next summit meeting in
June. The Bush administration believes freer trade between the two
nations would provide an important economic boost to the political
reforms Gorbachev is making.
   Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Julius Katz, the top U.S.
negotiator in the talks, said the next meeting has been tentatively
scheduled for later this month in Europe with a third bargaining
session to be held in mid-March in Vienna.
   ``I don't have any doubt that we can get the job done,'' he told
reporters after the talks ended Tuesday. ``There was nothing that
came up that presents an insuperable obstacle.''
   Chief Soviet negotiator Yuriy Chumakov, saying that the opening
discussions had gone ``fairly well,'' indicated that one key
sticking point could be the terms under which the treaty might be
suspended.
   The U.S. side is insisting that language be included giving the
United States the right to suspend the treaty if the Soviets are
found, after an annual presidential review, to be violating
requirements for open emigration policies.
   The Soviets want to negotiate a three-year trade treaty without
the threat of suspension, arguing that the assurance of trade
stability is needed to attract U.S. business investment.
   ``Would you invest $1 billion if you knew the agreement was
valid for only one year?'' Chumakov asked reporters.
   Annual review of Soviet emigration policies is required by the
Jackson-Vanik amendment, which Congress passed in 1974 in
retaliation for the Soviet government's refusal at that time to
allow free emigration for Soviet Jews and other dissidents.
   Katz said the U.S. negotiating position on this matter cannot
change unless Congress changes the law, something not likely to
occur in the immediate future.
   Negotiation of a wide-ranging trade agreement was a primary goal
established during the Bush-Gorbachev summit last December in
Malta. American officials predict that two-way trade between the
two countries could double or even triple over the next three years
once the high tariffs imposed by Jackson-Vanik are lowered.
   In the first 11 months of 1989, U.S. exports to the Soviet
Union, primarily grain shipments, totaled $3.82 billion, while
Soviet sales in the United States, primarily of petroleum and
consumer items such as vodka and furs, totaled $658 million.
   The trade treaty would be used to grant the Soviet Union ``most
favored nation status,'' qualifying it for the lowest tariffs
available to any other country. Soviet exports into the United
States currently bear duties as much as 10 times higher than
imports from other nations.
   By one estimate, the price of Soviet vodka could drop by $1.25
per bottle with the lower tariffs.
   American farmers also are watching the trade talks with keen
interest because the Soviets have said they will not sign a new
grain pact until agreement is reached on a wide-ranging trade
treaty.
   The current negotiations likely will serve as a prototype for
similar agreements to lower tariffs for other East European
nations. Poland and Hungary already have received ``most favored
nation status'' and the United States is considering granting
similar low tariffs for Czechoslovakia, Romania, Bulgaria and East
Germany.
   Katz said the pace of negotiations with other nations would
depend on when free elections are held, with Czechoslovakia ``a
good bet'' to be next in line to receive the lower tariffs.

   The past week's dramatic moves by the United
States, the Soviet Union and their chief allies establish a
framework for the most sweeping East-West changes since World War
II.
   The agreements open the way for the reunification of Germany,
the reduction of superpower forces in Europe and the expansion of
U.S.-Soviet trade.
   Last week in the Soviet Union, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev
won approval from the Communist Party Central Committee to give up
the party's monopoly on power for the first time in about 70 years.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, who visited Moscow last
week, made major progress with Gorbachev toward an agreement for
deep cuts in the superpowers' long-range nuclear arsenals.
   The swiftly moving talks culminated in Ottawa on Tuesday with
the announcement of a framework for German unification _ agreed
upon by the United States, its major European allies, the Soviet
Union and East Germany _ and a U.S.-Soviet agreement to limit their
troops in central Europe.
   Germany, divided since the defeat of Adolf Hitler in 1945, still
hosts more than a half-million foreign forces who have faced each
other through the Cold War.
   ``This (reunification) agreement shows everybody has seen German
unity will happen, and they have agreed to a process that will
provide stability and peace for Europe,'' said a West German
diplomat in Washington who asked not to be identified.
   The German reunification agreement announced in Ottawa sets up a
two-step process to start after the March 18 elections in East
Germany.
   Moscow has insisted that Germany remain neutral after
reunification and the United States demands that Germany remain
part of the Western alliance.
   Under the agreement, the two Germanys first would settle
internal details, then they would work with Britain, France, the
Soviet Union and United States _ the four main victorious allies in
World War II _ to establish agreements assuring peace and stability
for Europe.
   Such an approach is aimed at assuring the Soviets and other
Europeans that Germany, seen as the source of the two world wars in
this century, would never again threaten its neighbors.
   West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher offered
assurances of a reunited Germany's peaceful intentions, saying,
``We tell all our neighbors what we want to unite: The Federal
Republic of Germany, the German Democratic Republic and the whole
of Berlin _ no less, and no more. We do not have territorial claims
against any of our neighbors.''
   Moves by leaders of East and West Germany matched the pace of
the other countries. On Tuesday, West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
and East German Premier Hans Modrow agreed to begin talks next week
to make the West German mark the official currency of East Germany.
   The U.S.-Soviet troop cuts, announced by Canadian External
Affairs Minister Joseph Clark at the end of an East-West meeting in
Ottawa, would allow the United States and the Soviet Union to have
195,000 soldiers each on Europe's central front.
   That would be a cut from 275,000 for the United States and from
565,000 for the Soviets, and the United States would be allowed to
have another 30,000 troops elsewhere in Europe.
   U.S. and Soviet trade negotiators also said Tuesday they expect
to complete a treaty to normalize trade between the two nations in
time for signing during the June summit meeting in Washington.
   The Bush administration believes freer trade between the two
nations would provide an important economic boost to Gorbachev's
political reforms.
   During his eight-day trip Baker not only met with the Soviets
and NATO allies, but also visited Czechoslovakia, Romania and
Bulgaria to encourage their moves toward democracy and free-market
economies.
   However, some East-West issues still remain, such as differences
over regional conflicts in Afghanistan _ where the United States
supports guerrillas fighting the Soviet-backed government _ and
Central America, where the United States says the Soviets have been
supporting the Nicaraguan government and guerrillas in El Salvador.

   Here are the major points of the three agreements
announced at the joint meeting of foreign ministers of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>GERMANY</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   _Officials of East Germany and West Germany will meet after the
March 18 East German elections to discuss the legal, political and
economic issues of reunification. The two Germanies agreed
separately Tuesday to discuss merger of their currencies.
   _Outside powers may not interfere with decisions of the two
Germanys in those talks.
   _Afterward, foreign ministers of the two Germanys and the four
major victors over Nazi Germany of World War II, the United States,
Britain, France and the Soviet Union, will meet to discuss
``external aspects of the establishment of German unity, including
the issues of security of the neighboring states.''
   A major ``external aspect'' is Germany's ties to NATO. West
Germany is now a full participant in NATO's unified military
structure. The Soviet Union has proposed a neutral Germany,
objecting to a unified Germany in NATO's military structure.
President Bush has said he believes a Germany in NATO would allay
fears among Germany's neighbors.

   The agreement represents acceptance of a proposal by President
Bush in his State of the Union speech last month. Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev countered with an offer of equal levels for
U.S. and Soviet troops Europe-wide of 195,000 or 225,000 each, but
he did not insist.
   _The United States and the Soviet Union agreed to a limit of
195,000 troops that each may station on foreign soil in Central
Europe. Another 30,000 U.S. troops could be stationed in Europe
outside the central zone.
   _The Soviets, with 565,000 soldiers in East Germany, Poland,
Hungary and Czechoslovakia, will have to make the largest cut,
about 370,000.
   _The United States has about 305,000 troops in Europe, of which
about 275,000 are on the central front, and would cut about 80,000.

   The idea was first proposed by President Eisenhower in 1955 and
revived by President Bush last May.
   _The North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact each
may mount an annual quota of reconnaissance flights over countries
in the other alliance. The quotas for each country still must be
agreed upon.
   _Aircraft must be unarmed and use equipment to be decided upon
jointly.
   _Other countries, notably the European neutrals, will be invited
to participate.
   _Details are to be settled in time for a May 12 signing ceremony
in Budapest. The chief unsettled detail is a Soviet proposal for
joint use of aircraft.

<DATELINE>HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Blustery winds pushed more goo
onto California beaches Tuesday as reinforcements joined the battle
to sop up the oily onslaught a week after a tanker spill fouled the
coast.
   The cleanup crew was tripled to 1,120 workers on six miles of
oil-stained beach and another 300 workers were being trained to
handle the crude oil invasion. Fifteen miles of beach in Southern
California remained closed.
   Meanwhile, the 811-foot tanker American Trader docked for
repairs.
   A Newport Beach man filed one of the first lawsuits in
connection with the spill.
   The class-action lawsuit, filed by Chet Holifield in federal
court in Los Angeles, seeks damages and money for economic losses.
Among the defendants are the ship's owner and the company that
chartered the tanker.
   Winds combined with increasing surf to push new bands of thick
crude ashore, threatening wildlife sanctuaries. The 400,000-gallon
spill has killed 86 birds and coated 261 others with oil.
   The National Weather Service said onshore winds to 40 mph could
develop by Thursday.
   Up to 1,000 grunion have also been killed by the spill, state
Department of Fish and Game spokesman Pat Moore said.
   The tiny fish died during a weekend ``run'' along the Orange
County coastline, Moore said. Grunion come to the edge of the shore
during such runs to lay eggs in the soft sand. Any eggs left behind
in the oil-soaked sand were not expected to hatch, he said.
   Huntington Beach Mayor Tom Mays had asked Gov. George Deukmejian
to declare a state of emergency.
   But Eileen Baumgardner, assistant director of the Office of
Emergency Services, said the declaration was not immediately
necessary because the cleanup was being handled by private industry.
   ``As far as we can tell, there are no needs that are not being
met,'' she said late Monday. Huntington Beach is about 35 miles
southeast of Los Angeles.
   Waves of grimy crude oil spilled by the American Trader rolled
onto Bolsa Chica State Beach, leaving the beach coated with a layer
of crude 2 inches thick in some areas.
   ``I'm disgusted,'' surfer Bill Casper said while watching the
black tide roll in at his favorite surf spot near Huntington Beach
Pier. ``It's going to affect the beach for years. There will be tar
on the beach for years.''
   On a bike path further north near Bolsa Chica, Lee Buratti, 40,
of Dana Point was taking a break in training for the wheelchair
race in next month's Los Angeles Marathon. He complained of the
petroleum stench.
   ``The fumes were much too much. I could feel it in my lungs. It
actually hurt a little and it slowed my pace,'' said Buratti.
   But Buratti said spills were the price of the Los Angeles
lifestyle. ``Let's face it, our life revolves around oil. We have
to have it.''
   The oily pads, absorbent pompons and truck loads of gooey sand
were taken to a seven-acre site near the Newport Beach sewage
treatment plant, said Tony Kozlowski of British Petroleum America
Inc., which owns the Alaksa North Slope oil and chartered the ship.
   He said the muck can be picked up easier once it's on the beach.
   ``When it gets on shore we can deal with it and clean it up.
When it's out there it's just a waiting game,'' Kozlowski said.
   ``It's awful,'' said Robert August, who starred in the surfing
movie ``Endless Summer'' and now owns a surf shop in Huntington
Beach. ``It's pretty lousy for business. All that's there now are
reporters and politicians.''
   Businessman Ross Roberts, 48, visiting from Yakima, Wash., for a
boat show, speculated that tourism would likely take a beating just
as it did after the Mount St. Helens eruption in his state a decade
ago.
   ``It's not going to be good for the area, all this advertising
about oily beaches,'' Roberts said. ``There was the same effect in
Washington after Mount St. Helens because of all the ash that came
down.
   The patched-up American Trader moved from a Long Beach Harbor
anchorage and tied up at an Arco dock on Tuesday morning to unload
its remaining cargo of crude oil and to begin repairs of hull
punctures.
   The oil leaked from the vessel on Feb. 7 when the ship
apparently ran over its own anchor while mooring in shallow water
at an oil pipeline mooring two miles offshore.
   The slick meandered away from the beaches for five days with the
help of offshore winds and calm seas. Containment booms and sand
berms kept the oil out of marinas and the ecologically sensitive
Bolsa Chica Wetlands.
   But potential damage to the reserve, home for the endangered
California brown pelican and a stop for thousands of migratory
birds and marine life, was still a concern.
   ``Birds are leaving the wetlands and going to the ocean and
bringing the oil back to the estuary,'' said Patrick Moore of the
state Department of Fish and Game. Oily residue on the birds could
kill eggs.

<HEAD>Support for Sihanouk Violates Law, US Activists Claim</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A scientists' peace activist group says the
United States is violating the treaty against genocide and its own
laws by aiding Cambodian Prince Norodom Sihanouk while he
cooperates with the communist Khmer Rouge.
   Sihanouk has been reported to be sending money to Khmer Rouge
guerrilla units in the Southeast Asian country, Jeremy J. Stone,
president of the Federation of American Scientists, said Tuesday.
   The treaty, ratified by the Senate in 1988, obligates
participating countries to undertake prevention of ethnic-based
mass killing known as genocide, and punishment of those accused of
genocide.
   Stone said that would include the Khmer Rouge, blamed for more
than a million deaths during their bloody 1975-78 rule over the
southeast Asian country.
   Also violated, he said, were provisions of the U.S. Foreign
Assistance Act that since 1985 has forbidden use of American aid
funds to ``directly or indirectly'' sustain or augment operations
of the Khmer Rouge.
   President Bush's administration has declared a major objective
of its Cambodian policy is to block return to power of the Khmer
Rouge.
   But the administration has also accepted Sihanouk's alliance
with the Khmer Rouge guerilla fighters, describing their presence
as ``a fact of life.''
   Last year's pullout of Vietnamese occupation forces intensified
Cambodia's civil war and heightened world anxiety about a Khmer
Rouge comeback. Khmer Rouge guerrillas and those of two
noncommunist factions claim territorial gains at the expense of the
Vietnam-installed Cambodian government of Premier Hun Sen.
   Published reports say the anti-government factions have been
cooperating with each other and that Western-supplied weapons have
been captured from Khmer Rouge forces.
   The United States and other major powers support a Cambodian
peace plan based on a U.N.-supervised interim government and
elections.
   But Stone said the Khmer Rouge would continue fighting if they
lose such elections and that his organization of 4,000 members
wants to end ``the killing of Cambodians now, as fast as we can.''
   He called for a cutoff of arms deliveries to all Cambodian
factions and for Thailand to halt the flow of Chinese weapons to
the Khmer Rouge over the Thai border. Official American aid has
been limited to nominal humanitarian assistance while the two
non-communist factions in the anti-government alliance have been
reported to be drawing more than $20 million worth of Western
covert aid a year.

   After years of adapting its games
for Hispanics by slipping a set of Spanish instructions into the
box, Milton Bradley Co. is really going bilingual.
   Its board game, ``Sabado Gigante,'' based on a popular Hispanic
network television show, was unveiled this week.
   ``This is the first time that in this industry I've seen a
product that's adapted to the market rather than asking the market
to adapt the product,'' said George R. Ditomassi, the company's
president, in a telephone interview from New York, where the game
made its debut at the 87th American International Toy Fair.
   The $23 game, with printing in both Spanish and English, is
based on the 3{-hour cable television show of the same name,
broadcast on the Univision network on Saturday nights.
   Milton Bradley, the 130-year-old maker of such board games as
``Chutes and Ladders,'' decided to develop a Hispanic game after
research showed an estimated 20 million Hispanics in the U.S.
game-buying market.
   In addition, Ditomassi said, studies indicate Hispanic parents
tend to spend more per capita on their children than the average
U.S. parent.

   Legislators are hee-hawing about a
photograph in the state's official manual identifying a furry
four-legged critter as a ``typical Missouri mule.''
   Nay, bray the lawmakers _ the color picture does not show the
state's sleek-haired symbol of stubbornness.
   It shows Mindy, a 6-year-old Sicilian donkey.
   ``Everybody's heard of the world-famous Missouri mule, and this
isn't one,'' state Sen. Mike Lybyer said Tuesday, pointing to the
picture on page 31 of the guide to state government, published by
the secretary of state.
   ``Sen. Lybyer is absolutely right. The picture on Page 31 is
clearly a burro, not a mule,'' Secretary of State Roy Blunt said in
a statement. ``While this is bad, it's not as bad as the year we
identified a fruit fly as the honey bee,'' the official state
insect.
   Lybyer told Blunt it would be too late and too costly to recall
hundreds of thousands of copies of the hardbound manual.

   The South Carolina National Guard removed
part of a recruiting sign outside its armory when the message was
mistaken for an advertisement for Stinger missile sales.
   The sign read, ``Stinger Missiles, $2,000 cash, 224-2862.'' What
it meant was that the National Guard was offering a $2,000 bonus
for recruits who enlist to be Stinger crewmen, Maj. Jim Culp said.
   ``No, we're not selling Stingers,'' Culp said. ``And if we were,
we wouldn't sell them for $2,000. We could get at least $50,000 in
Miami.''
   Sgt. Harris Clark said Monday that the sign had been up for two
weeks before anyone noticed that it was misleading.

<TEXT>
   The Ottawa agreement on German unification
provides the decisive international acceptance for a process that
is already well under way inside the two neighboring countries.
   From business ventures to television programming and vacation
travel, the two states have been coming closer together in hundreds
of ways each day.
   ``What belongs together will grow together,'' former West German
Chancellor Willy Brandt is fond of saying.
   And Germans in both east and west have accepted the
inevitability of a rapid unification since the Berlin Wall opened
Nov. 9.
   Serious obstacles remain in making a single nation, with its
citizens carrying the same passports, paying with the same currency
and serving side-by-side in the same armed forces.
   From an international standpoint, the most serious obstacle may
be the military stance of a united Germany.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has said NATO membership
for a united Germany is ``not acceptable,'' the official East
German news agency ADN said.
   ADN stressed that discussions about unification ``will also
include the questions of security of neighboring states.''
   Still mindful of the horrors of the Nazi aggression, East
Germany's Communists are seeking assurances that conservatives in
Bonn have given up any designs on former lands that now belong to
Poland. West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said his country has no
intention of seeking to regain any lands that were part of prewar
Germany.
   The Ottawa agreement sets the stage for a virtual revolution _
the first redrawing of European national boundaries since World War
II. It was a step that only recently many had never expected could
happen.
   Internally, there are still numerous questions to be answered.
   ``Socialism and capitalism can no more be united than fire and
water,'' then-East German leader Erich Honecker said during a 1987
visit to Bonn.
   While much of what the now-disgraced hard-liner did and said has
been ridiculed, there may be a good deal of truth in his metaphor.
   East German industry _ the part that is still running _ is a
product of heavy-handed central planning from East Berlin.
   West Germans say that leads to inefficiency and slowness to
change, even in such simple ways as adapting to the latest fashions.
   Most East Germans are also accustomed to a cradle-to-grave
socialism that up until very recently has left very little to
individual choice.
   Housing, clothing and public transportation at rock-bottom
prices are almost a compensation for the hundreds of daily
sacrifices East Germans have had to make.
   Meshing the economies will be a daunting task and will cost
billions of dollars.
   West Germany has one of the most efficient economies in the
world, but East Germany's economy has been going downhill since the
1960s.
   West Germany has strict factory safety measures and a vocal
Greens Party to help enforce environment regulations. Much of
coal-dependent East Germany is an ecological nightmare, dangerously
polluted.
   Other problems loom as well.
   ``These East Germans come over here and get a lot of handouts
from the government,'' grouses one businesswoman in the prosperpous
Frankfurt suburb of Koenigstein. ``But they never saw that much
money in their life.''
   Many East Germans, the elderly especially, also worry that the
thousands of marks they stashed away in bank accounts will be
worthless once the mighty West German mark swallows up its weak
neighbor.
   West German leftists and union leaders warn that East Germany
cannot be a source of low-wage labor.
   Still, the Germans on both sides seem determined to work out the
problems, which in many cases will simply require some time and
patience.
   With virtually all major groups and political parties in East
Germany and West Germany in favor of unification, the main question
for weeks has been when rather than whether.
   Every day has brought new ties.
   West German businesses have been gearing up to move into East
Germany. West Germany's Dresdner Bank has opened an office in its
founding city of Dresden, with other financial institutions
following the trail to East Germany.
   East German TV shows have been shown on West German television.
West Germany's two networks have been broadcasting election
information programs into East Germany in advance of the country's
first free balloting on March 18.
   Newspapers from each country are now sold in the other, and West
German tour companies are promoting trips east.
   While some of these steps seem minor taken individually, they
add up to a revolution for a people long separated from family and
loved ones.
   The reuniting of the two countries' Olympic teams is considered
likely and will provide a broad symbolic move for two countries
proud of their athletic prowess.
   Germans are waiting for Berlin to become the capital of a united
country.
   ``Now that the Berlin Wall has fallen, it's also necessary for
the walls in our heads to come down,'' West Berlin planning chief
Michaela Schreyer said Sunday.

<HEAD>Senator Criticizes ``Pension Raiding'' By Corporations</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress must provide greater safeguards to
retirees because of ``pension raiding'' by corporations that
terminate employee retirement funds to take control of surplus
assets, says the chairman of a Senate committee.
   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, said Tuesday that Congress needs
to approve legislation imposing stricter standards on pension
terminations, especially because the retirement plans often are
replaced with annuities purchased from insurance companies heavily
invested in high-risk ``junk'' bonds.
   ``Pension raids leave workers and retirees with frozen pension
checks while their employers laugh their way to the bank with
millions of dollars,'' said Metzenbaum.
   Annuities are contracts that pay fixed monthly benefits to
retirees.
   Surplus pension assets have become a popular target for
corporate raiders who acquire a company and use its overfunded
retirement programs as a source of cash.
   Metzenbaum said ``sound pension plans are wrung dry of their
cash and replaced with annuities offering fixed benefits and no
chance of cost-of-living adjustments.''
   Most pension plans are federally insured by the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corp., but the subcommittee was told there is no similar
federal backing of retirement annuities of insurance companies. A
few states have special funds to guard against insurance company
defaults. However, Metzenbaum complained the insurance industry was
poorly regulated and said that increased the risk for retirees in
pension terminations.

<HEAD>Hispanics Left Out Of Job Training Program</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Federal job training programs fail to serve
enough Hispanics because of income and documentation barriers, says
a government report.
   The National Commission for Employment Policy, an independent
agency that reports to Congress and the presidnt, said Tuesday the
federal Job Training Partnership Act needs to be amended so more
Hispanics will participate.
   The report, based on a 12-month study, called on Congress to
ease income requirements. It also asked the Labor Department to
urge states to loosen documentation requirements needed to get into
job training programs.
   While Hispanics account for between 13 percent and 14 percent of
those eligible for job training programs, they make up only between
10 percent and 11 percent of those who take part, the report said.
   The commission blamed part of the discrepancy on federal
requirements that mandate candidates for the program be receiving
food stamps. Many Hispanics refuse to accept public assistance and
therefore miss out on job training opportunities, the report said.
   ``Because of their cultural heritage of self-sufficiency and
attendant distaste for government assistance programs, many
Hispanics would rather forego JTPA training than accept food stamp
assistance just to qualify for the program,'' the agency said.
   The report recommended that Congress change the law so that
candidates merely be ``eligible'' for food stamps rather than
actually accepting the assistance.

<HEAD>All But One Vehicle Test Show Possible Injuries</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six of the seven 1990-model autos tested so
far appear unlikely to protect drivers from head injuries in a
35-mile-per-hour crash, the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration said Tuesday.
   Only the Acura Integra four-door sedan appears able to protect
from driver head injuries, the agency said. The Toyota 4-Runner
four-door truck ranked worst among models tested.
   Besides the Acura and Toyota models, tests have been conducted
on the Chevrolet Lumina, the Mazda Miata, the Nissan Stanza, the
Lexus ES250 and the Mitsubishi Eclipse.
   Some carmakers have criticized the government's testing, which
uses instrument-equipped dummies. The manufacturers contend the
tests to not accurately reflect highway crash conditions.
   The safety agency continues testing throughout the year until
all models are covered.
   Each car is given a head-injury rating. Scores below 750
indicate that head injury is unlikely, between 750 and 1,250 that
it is possible and above 1,250 that it is likely.
   Here are the models tested so far and their head injury scores:
   Toyota 4-Runner four-door, 1,306; Chevrolet Lumina four-door,
1,200; Nissan Stanza four-door, 1,105; Lexus ES250 four-door, 992;
Mazda Miata two-door convertible, 920; Mitsubishi Eclipse two-door
hatchback, 772; Acura Integra four-door, 585.

   The dollar closed at 144.35 yen, down 0.13 yen from Tuesday's

<HEAD>Toys Clear Red Tape, Finally Take Off For Panama</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KIM S. MARTIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   While many people are celebrating Valentine's Day,
some Panamanian children are opening Christmas presents delayed
almost two months by U.S. government red tape.
   Patricia Gehri, 45, has been working since just after the Dec.
20 invasion of Panama to gather toys for children she said never
had a Christmas. But until Tuesday, she could not get them
delivered.
   Then, Tuesday afternoon, a U.S. Marine plane took off from
MacDill Air Force Base with the toys.
   ``It could have been worse,'' she said. ``It could have been
Easter bunnies.''
   Gehri amassed between 8,000 and 10,000 toys along with the
Marines through their Toys for Tots program. The teddy bears,
games, tea sets and dolls had been gathering dust in Marine
warehouses in Tampa, Orlando, Miami and Gehri's garage.
   ``I wish we could paint a big red nose on that airplane,'' Gehri
said, just like Rudolph the red-nose reindeer.
   The Marines picked up all the toys Gehri had stored, along with
those in Miami and took them to MacDill where they were loaded on a
C-130 cargo plane from Illinois.
   The toy delivery was initially delayed because the Marines had
difficulty getting permission to land a plane in war-torn Panama.
But the State Department approved the mission last week, and the
government of Panama approved it Friday.
   Gehri said she obtained permission by using the ``Denton
Amendment'' which allows airlifting items for humanitarian efforts.
She had a little trouble convincing government officials that teddy
bears were humanitarian.
   ``They didn't take it seriously because it's toys and not food
or medicine,'' she said. ``But a teddy bear is medicine to me.''
   Once the toys arrive in Panama, officials will work with the
Marines to distribute the items to children in refugee camps,
hospitals and orphanages, she said.
   ``An ex-Marine gave me a big, giant raccoon today that will go
to special little girl in the hospital from me,'' she said. ``She
lost her arm when the PDF (Panamanian Defense Forces) opened fire
during the invasion.''
   Gehri, a former flight attendant, was disabled in 1988 from a
head injury so severe it impaired her speech. After recovering most
functions, her therapist suggested she take on a project to help
her feel good about herself.
   When she decided to send toys to Panama, she had no idea it
would become such an involved effort, but she has nothing but
praise for the Marines and the Panamanian government.
   ``Considering everything that has happened, it's a miracle,''
Gehri said. ``I would never have had so many toys if they had gone
off on time.''

<HEAD>Cocaine Use By Men May Diminish Fertility, Study Suggests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cocaine use may lower sperm counts and create
other abnormalities that diminish male fertility, a new study
suggests, but the effect apparently begins to disappear after drug
use stops.
   The study focused on men from couples who were consulting an
infertility clinic at Yale University. It appears in this month's
issue of Fertility and Sterility, the official journal of The
American Fertility Society.
   A specialist in male infertility cautioned Tuesday that the
study does not show that cocaine use caused infertility in the men.
   ``This is provocative but by no means evidence of cause and
effect,'' said Richard Sherins of the Genetics and IVF Institute of
Fairfax, Va.
   Researchers studied 40 men with low sperm counts, 77 who had
sperm with low motility, which essentially means too few sperm were
swimming correctly, and 75 who had high concentrations of
abnormally shaped sperm. Each of these problems can contribute to
infertility.
   Cocaine use by these men was compared to that of 284 other male
partners of couples who consulted the Yale clinic but did not have
these problems.
   Researchers found that men who had low sperm counts were twice
as likely as men in the comparison group to have used cocaine
within the previous two years. They were five times as likely to
have used it once a month or more and within the previous two
years, or to have used it once a month or more and for two to four
years.
   Men with the motility problem were twice as likely as the
comparison group to have used cocaine for five or more years.
   Men with high concentrations of abnormally shaped sperm were
seven times as likely to have used cocaine for five years or more
and two years or longer ago, and four times as likely to have used
it once a month or more and for two to four years.
   Male infertility plays some role in almost two-thirds of couples
who have trouble conceiving, the researchers said.
   Given that research shows cocaine use to be quite prevalent
among men ages 26 to 34, and given the drug's apparent effect in
the new study, ``I think one can conclude that it may be a
significant risk factor for infertility,'' said study co-author
Michael Bracken, professor of epidemiology, obstetrics and
gynecology at Yale University.
   But Sherins said the statistical association between cocaine and
infertility in the study was weak. The research ``whets your
appetite for doing the study right,'' he said.
   The proper approach would include medical diagnosis of what was
causing infertility in the couple, he said, or a demonstration of
how sperm quality changes as a person starts or stops taking
cocaine.
   The researchers did not explore how cocaine could affect
fertility. They suggested it may affect early sperm development by
disrupting hormonal patterns, or harm testicular functioning by
reducing blood flow.

<DATELINE>CARTAGENA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cartagena normally is a lazy beach
town with crowded beaches and a lively night life, but this week
the Caribbean coastal town looks like a city after a military coup.
   Military vessels ply Cartagena Bay and marines patrol streets
and set up checkpoints for searching cars and passengers.
   The tight security is for President Bush and the presidents of
Colombia, Peru and Bolivia, who meet in Cartagena on Thursday for a
summit on strategies for ending the lucrative and lethal trade in
cocaine.
   They are to gather at a 17th-century Spanish fort, part of the
Colombian Naval Academy's base, that lies on the tip of a half-mile
finger of land jutting out into Cartagena Bay.
   Helicopter gunships manned by Americans and Colombians are
patrolling the bay and surrounding area, a Colombian frigate is
anchored a few hundred yards from the fort and high-speed patrol
boats stop and search other vessels.
   Further offshore, two U.S. ships were on patrol: the USS Nassau,
an 820-foot amphibious assault ship that carries helicopters and an
1,700-man Marine landing team, and the USS Sampson, a 437-foot
destroyer.
   Most hotels are requiring that guests not only show their
passports or other official identification, but that they leave
their fingerprints on file in the event there is a bombing or other
violence.
   While Cartagena has not been a major battlefield in the war
between Colombia's government and the nation's cocaine barons, it
has been the site of enough attacks to seriously harm Cartagena's
tourism.
   Only a few local people are at the beaches, which usually are
jammed with thousands of people from Canada, the United States and
Europe at this time of the year.
   The foreigners have not been coming to the city since a bomb
exploded at the Cartagena Hilton on Oct. 26, killing two people in
their room.
   Another bomb exploded harmlessly in the tourist district a short
time later, and a third device was found at another hotel.
   Eight years ago, two U.S. drug agents were abducted from the
Cartagena Hilton by two gunmen posing as room service employes. The
agents were taken into the countryside, shot several times and left
for dead. But one crawled to a hospital several blocks away for
help and both survived.
   On Dec. 15, national police tracked the country's second-biggest
trafficker, Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, to a banana plantation just 75
miles south of Cartagena. He was killed by a burst of gunfire from
a helicopter gunship as he heaved hand grenades and fired an
assault rifle.
   U.S. Ambassador Thomas McNamara complained Tuesday that American
reporters are creating an atmosphere of tension by emphasizing
security measures for the summit.
   He said Colombians resent such reports and brushed aside
reporters' suggestions that it is the White House that is creating
the drama and aura of danger for Bush's visit.
   According to one report from the United States, the U.S. Secret
Service had found that drug traffickers have shoulder-fired,
surface-to-air missiles, and it was feared they might be used to
disrupt the summit.
   Also, it has been reported for several weeks that Bush's aides
opposed the president coming to Colombia because of the danger.
   Since the Colombian government declared war on traffickers Aug.
18, there have been 262 terrorist acts blamed on drug bosses,
Mostly bombings, they ahve claimed 209 lives.
   While there appeared to be a great show of military force in
Cartagena, security measures appeared to be lax at the gate to the
navy base where Bush will meet with the Latin American leaders.
   An Associated Press photographer watching the gate to the base
saw 20 cars, many carrying civilians, go in during a half-hour
period. Only two of the vehicles were searched.

   A 13-year-old girl was buried with her
teddy bear and library cards, a memento of her tardy book-borrowing
habits and a spare touch of humor to lighten grim memories of the
massacre that claimed her life.
   Classmates and friends of Amy Houser huddled and cried Tuesday
in a windy gravesite ceremony attended by more than 800 people.
   The girl was among four people who were herded together and shot
to death during a robbery Saturday at a bowling alley.
   The other victims _ Steve Teran, 26, his stepdaughter, Paula
Holguin, 6, and daughter, Valerie Teran, 2 _ were to be buried
today in nearby Silver City. Three others were wounded and remained
hospitalized, two in serious and one in good condition, hospital
spokeswoman Terri Read said.
   ``Shock, outrage, disgust, anger, pain are but a few of the
words that describe the emotions that all of us here, indeed the
entire city of Las Cruces, are experiencing,'' the Rev. Tom Beggane
said during Tuesday's funeral at Immaculate Heart of Mary Cathedral.
   But Beggane told the mourners, ``Allow your love and your memory
of your friend Amy to help you to plant the seed of justice, the
seed of love.''
   The girl, a part-time employee at Las Cruces Bowl, and six other
people were ordered at gunpoint into the bowling alley office,
forced to lie on the floor and shot in the back of the head. Police
are looking for two gunmen who fled with $5,000.
   ``I have seen this week much pain in the people I love. So much
pain that I could hate, but I will not,'' said Ben Saenz, Amy's
uncle.
   Family members placed stuffed toys, Amy's favorite perfume, a
soccer trophy, library cards and poems written by friends on her
linen-draped casket.
   Amy won the trophy in 1982 when she was the only girl on the
church soccer team. The library cards were a humorous reminder that
Amy always returned her library books late, Saenz said.
   ``A piece of our heart has been broken and shattered into
millions of pieces,'' said Saenz, reading a poem written by one of
Amy's cousins.
   As the motorcade passed from the cathedral to the cemetery, a
man standing on a corner removed his hat.

   Three teen-agers took 14
hostages on a school bus Tuesday and were arrested after releasing
all but one of their captives and leading authorities on a brief
chase.
   The hostages _ 13 secondary school students and the driver _
were released unharmed although one girl was later taken to a
hospital for treatment of shock, said Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
   The three Prince George youths who seized the bus were armed
with two sawed-off rifles, a .303-caliber and a .22-caliber
semiautomatic, said Inspector Merv Harrower.
   The youths, two 18-year-olds and a 14-year-old, were due to
appear Wednesday in provincial court. Their names were not released.
   ``We've got a rather large choice,'' Harrower told a news
conference after declining to say exactly what charges would be
filed.
   There was no indication drugs or alcohol was involved in the
hijacking, which began about 4:30 p.m., police said.
   The youths commandeered the bus as it was taking students home
from Prince George Secondary School. They boarded before other
students, telling bus driver Syl Meise, 55, they had something to
give to one of the students, said Staff Sgt. Elles Peleskey.
   After some students left the bus south of Prince George, the
three produced their weapons and ordered the driver to drive back
to the city to a car dealership, Peleskey said.
   After the bus was seized, police sharpshooters were sent to the
scene, but no shots were fired by either police or the gunmen.
   Downtown traffic was cordoned off.
   About 2{ hours after the incident began, police supplied the
three with a getaway car and allowed them to take one of the male
students with them.
   The three drove north out of Prince George, about 300 miles
north of Vancouver, then turned off the main highway onto a side
road in an attempt to elude police cars, Harrower said.
   The car went out of control on the slippery side road and veered
into a snowbank.
   By the time the youths got the car out of the snow, police had
surrounded it and the three surrendered, Harrower said.
   Harrower said the three told police they had intended to head
for Dawson Creek near the British Columbia-Alberta line _ a
250-mile drive.

   During World War I, young lovers
exchanged small candy hearts emblazoned with ``Skidoo'' and ``Oh
You Kid'' on Valentine's Day. Now, conversation hearts announce
``Luv ya'' and ``Let's Rock.''
   It's Valentine's Day year-round at the New England Confectionery
Company, or Necco, which originated ``conversation hearts'' at the
turn of the century. Production ceased in 1920.
   Necco revived the small, brightly-colored candies six years ago
when company officials decided they had become popular again.
   ``People are crazy for them,'' said Anthony Staropoli, 62, of
East Boston, ``When they hear I work here, I have to give bags to
everyone.''
   Though managers say the average employee tires of eating candy
after two or three weeks on the job, Necco veteran Staropoli gave a
different story.
   ``I've been eating candy in this place for 43 years,'' he said.

   Oklahoma City's Post Office has come up
with a sweet way to say ``I love you'' this Valentine's Day:
chocolate bars embossed with a dove insignia that's on the current
love stamp.
   After an initial order of 1,500, the post office has sold
hundreds of the bars in the past month, said spokesman Larry
Flener. By early Tuesday, about 60 were left and those were
expected to be gone by the end of the day.
   ``We started with a limited supply as a test to see if it was
successful,'' said Flener. ``They've been selling absolutely as
fast as we can get them.''
   The bar has been an easy way to let the mailman take care of
Valentine's Day obligations, he said. The package deal includes the
chocolate, a message and guaranteed overnight express delivery
within the city area.
   The bars cost $5, and if they are sent Express Mail, the entire
cost is $12, Flener said. The post office also has T-shirts, lapel
pins and coffee mugs that say ``love,'' postal style.
   But if they're too expensive, there's the love stamp, on or off
a valentine _ still 25 cents.

   To folks at Kissimmee's post office, the
postmark each envelope gets is an ordinary, everyday thing. But to
lovers in Grand Prairie, Tacoma and Chicago, it says ``Kiss-a-me.''
   Cupid has entered Kissimmee postal workers again this year, as
they hand-stamp about 1,000 cards with the town's name.
   ``To us, it's plain old Kissimmee,'' postal secretary Linda
Latino said of the black-ink stamp that each piece of mail gets in
this town just south of Orlando.
   ``When other people look at it, they think it's `Kiss-a-me.''
   Kissimmee doesn't advertise, or claim any connection to St.
Valentine, so 1,000 cards is modest compared with some 250,000
letters and packages sent every December to its neighbor down the
road, Christmas, Fla.
   And Loveland, Colo., will stamp a special Valentine's Day
postmark and a poem on 28,000 pieces of mail.
   Chris Tye-Coleman of Kansas City, Mo., has sent her husband's
valentine cards to Kissimmee for the postmark for several years
after she learned of it in a magazine listing of cities with names
that reflected love.
   In 1982, when the couple stayed in Kissimmee for their
honeymoon, they learned that ``Kiss-a-me'' is really pronounced
kih-sim'-mee.
   ``I don't care,'' Mrs. Tye-Coleman said Monday over the
telephone. ``I'll just keep doing it.''

Knoxville Zoo is offering a different Valentine's Day present for
that special someone today _ a red-ribboned cockroach.
   For $10 dollars, the zoo is offering patrons Valentine's Day
adoption papers for a pair of cockroaches aptly named Romeo and
Juliet in a benefit for the hands that feed more than 800 zoo
animals, including its cockroaches.
   The zoo has 70 giant, hissing, Madagascar cockroaches that are
best left in the zoo's reptile exhibit.
   ``They tend to be much larger and much more disgusting'' than
your average, run-of-the-mill cockroach, said zoo spokeswoman Julie
Wood. ``They are definitely not anything you would want to find in
your home, by any means.''
   Barbara McDaniels placed orders for her three nephews and her
brother-in-law, although she's never seen the zoo's roaches.
``That's close enough for me with cockroaches,'' she said Tuesday.
   Alicia Miller, 23, placed another order, reportedly for a
boyfriend.
   ``I just thought it sounded kind of off-the-wall. It sounded
like a good gift,'' she said.
   The idea was borrowed from Chicago's Brookfield Zoo. The
adoption papers include a card, a T-shirt iron-on, a car window
sticker saying ``zoo parent,'' and a 3-inch long, black plastic bug
with a red bow around its neck.

<HEAD>Drug Cartel Says It Will Surrender Biggest Cocaine Labs For Peace</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HAROLD OLMOS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   On the eve of a U.S.-Latin American drug
summit, the powerful Medellin cocaine cartel declared that it would
surrender its three largest cocaine-processing laboratories to
authorities.
   Earlier Tuesday, leftist guerrillas kidnapped two Americans to
protest President Bush's planned visit this week to the coastal
resort city of Cartagena and said they would put their captives on
trial, police said.
   One was later released.
   Anti-Bush demonstrators took to the streets in Cartagena, where
about 1,000 union members marched, and in Bogota, where police
fired tear gas at about 100 rock-throwing students. No injuries
were reported.
   The drug traffickers said they would turn over three labs that
have produced 21 tons of cocaine monthly as a ``contribution to our
decision to fight for peace and strenghtening of democracy in
Colombia.''
   They said they would also surrender 15,000 55-gallon drums of
ether, acetone and other chemicals used to refine cocaine.
   The offer, in a written statement Tuesday night in the cocaine
trafficking center of Medellin, appeared to be another effort to
force the government to end its war on drugs and stop extraditing
traffickers to the United States.
   The communique was signed by ``The Extraditables,'' as the
members of the Medellin cartel call themselves, and distributed to
radio stations and newspapers. It did not give a location for the
chemicals or the three laboratories.
   A report by the Caracol radio network said the traffickers had
given the locations to a group of journalists in Medellin. The
report from Medellin provided no additional details, and it could
not be immediately confirmed.
   The communique made no reference to Bush's visit. Extradition
reportedly is high on the agenda of the summit.
   Bush is scheduled to arrive in Cartagena on Thursday. Security
is tight; there have been reports the Medellin cartel might try to
assassinate him.
   Presidents Jaime Paz Zamora of Bolivia and Alan Garcia of Peru
are to arrive in Cartagena later today and briefly meet with
President Virgilio Barco.
   The two Americans abducted Tuesday were identified as David
Kent, a 40-year-old teacher from Indianapolis, and James Archer
Donnelly, a 65-year-old businessman from Detroit.
   Donnelly was kidnapped with his Colombian wife and the two were
released unhurt about three hours later in Medellin, said Lt.
Eusabio Guerrero, a police spokesman from the city.
   An official at the school where Kent teaches, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said Donnelly was told by his captors that
they were leftist guerrillas and had taken the action to protest
Bush's visit.
   The kidnappings were certain to fuel concerns, already high,
over Bush's security. Two U.S. ships are patrolling off the
Colombian coast: the USS Nassau, an 820-foot amphibious assault
ship that carries helicopters and an 1,700-man Marine landing team,
and the USS Sampson, a 437-foot destroyer, according to the
Pentagon.
   Caracol said its Medellin station received a telephone call from
a man who said he was a spokesman for leftist guerrillas and
claimed responsibility for the abductions. The caller said the men
would be put on trial and would be released in five days, Caracol
said. He did not explain why there would be a trial or why the men
would be released.
   A police spokesman said the kidnappers were from the National
Liberation Army, a leftist guerrilla group. There was no way to
confirm the claim; drug traffickers have in the past posed as
leftist insurgents.
   The traffickers' move for peace is only the latest in a series
since the government declared all-out war on the country's cocaine
barons in August. The drug bosses have been blamed for 262
terrorist acts since that have clamed 209 lives. Most have been
bombings.
   The bombings include the downing of a Colombian airliner in
which 107 people were killed.
   Fourteen suspected traffickers have been extradited to the
United States in the last five months.
   In December, an army unit killed Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha,
considered number two of the cartel.
   Barco has said repeatedly he will never negotiate with the drug
lords.

<HEAD>Hurdles Facing German Union</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Before the two Germanys can merge as one
nation, they must overcome divisions that have grown out of
radically different political and social systems and four decades
of bitter rivalry.
   Here are some of the main issues the sides must resolve:
   _ Security. The United States has insisted that a reunited
Germany remain in NATO. The Soviet Union has called for a neutral
Germany. There is no decision yet whether a reunited Germany would
even have armed forces.
   At present, the Soviet Union has 380,000 troops in East Germany
under the Warsaw Pact military alliance. The United States, France,
Belgium, Britain and Canada have more than 300,000 soldiers in West
Germany under the NATO alliance.
   U.S. and Soviet forces in Europe will be reduced under an
agreement announced Tuesday. But the two German states also have
formidible forces of their own: nearly 400,000 troops in the West
German Bundeswehr and about 200,000 in the East German armed forces.
   _ Borders. In the aftermath of World War II, Germany lost
considerable territory to Poland and the Soviet Union. These
countries have insisted that the territorial changes have been
formalized. But there is considerable sentiment in both Germanys to
recover these lands at the bargaining table.
   _ Economy. West Germany, with a population of 61 million, is the
largest country in the European Economic Community and the most
powerful manufacturing nations in the trading group.
   East Germany, with more than 16 million residents, is a
crucially important member of the Moscow-led Comecon trading group.
But its economy, once a model of central planning, has been
devastated in recent months by the exodus of tens of thousands of
skilled workers to the West. It has also polluted the environment.
   Under reunification, West Germany would probably bear the brunt
of financial responsibility for East Germany.
   So far, however, the East German has rejected the West German
proposal for a swift monetary union _ with the West German mark
becoming the currency in the east. Instead, East Germany has
appealed for $9 billion in bailout loans. Yet it has been unwilling
to release basic economic data demanded by West Germany as a
condition for emergency aid.
   _ Government. West Germany is a parliamentary democracy with a
stable and vibrant political system. Chancellor Helmut Kohl, a
Christian Democrat, faces a challenge from the left-leaning Social
Democrats in national elections Dec. 8.
   East Germany has been ruled by the Communist Party since its
formation in 1948 out of the Soviet occupation zone, but its
political system is now in great flux. The party's power has badly
eroded since the Berlin Wall was opened in November.
   Communist Premier Hans Modrow faces the country's first free
elections on March 18, and the Communists are expected to be
defeated. The new Social Democratic Party of East Germany is likely
to emerge as the largest party, but nearly a dozen other groups
could win seats in parliament.
   _ Culture and outlook. East Germany's tightly controlled
Communist system and West Germany's freewheeling capitalism have
produced different character traits in many citizens. East Germans
have come to expect zero unemployment from their socialist system.
If the two countries are unified, there may be disillusionment in
store for citizens on both sides.

<HEAD>Dollar Down, Stocks Slightly Higher in Tokyo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar inched down against the yen today, while
the Tokyo Stock Exchange's key index gained slightly despite some
selling in connection with the bankruptcy filing of the parent of a
major U.S. securities firm.
   The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average gained 48.86 points, or 0.13
percent, closing at 37,155.89. It fell 181.11 points Tuesday.
   Dealers attributed the small size of the index's rebound to the
bankruptcy filing of the parent company of Drexel Burnham Lambert.
   Investors sold issues related to finance and investment
companies that might hold risky, high-interest junk bonds, they
said.
   Drexel Burnham Lambert announced Wednesday that its parent
company has filed for protection from creditors under federal
bankruptcy laws because of financial problems stemming from its
dealings in junk bonds and a scandal involving a former executive,
Michael Milken.
   Masahiro Umemori, an analyst with Nomura Securities Co., said
the news raised uncertainties among Japanese investors, although
``the negative impact will affect investors more seriously in the
longer term rather than right now.''
   Trading was ``extremely thin'' as most investors stepped to the
sidelines to await Sunday's parliamentary elections, said Satoru
Nagayoshi, a dealer with New Japan Securities Co. An estimated 350
million shares changed hands on the first section, up from
Tuesday's 300 million.
   In currency dealings, the dollar closed at 144.35 yen, down 0.13
yen from Tuesday's 144.48-yen finish. It opened at 144.30 yen and
ranged between 144.20 yen and 144.40 yen.
   The dollar now has fallen 1.15 yen in three trading days.
   Traders attributed the dollar's decline Wednesday to its
overnight drop on overseas markets in the wake of the Drexel news.
   ``The dollar weakened mainly in the early session as market
players sold it against the yen and the (West German) mark,
following the other markets overseas,'' said Masato Hayashi, a Bank
of Tokyo trader.
   But investors bought the U.S. currency whenever it fell close to
the 144-yen level, he added.
   The yen also failed to strengthen because market players
expected a sharp decline in the nation's trade surplus in January,
he said.
   ``Some even had predicted the trade figure would be in the
red,'' Hayashi added.
   After the market closed, the Finance Ministry announced that
Japan posted a trade surplus of $342.4 million in January, down
sharply from $3.25 billion a year earlier.
   January marked the ninth consecutive month of year-to-year
decline in the country's merchandise trade surplus.

<HEAD>Senior Citizens Perturbed by Hellions on Supermarket Wheels</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MIAMI BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some denizens of this citadel for
senior citizens fear their tranquil marketing is about to be marred
by armadas of miniature shopping carts, pushed along by
sugar-crazed 3-year-olds.
   Mothers say the carts are ``really great'' at keeping kids out
of their hair, and children call them fun. A straight-faced
spokesman for Publix Supermarkets has proclaimed the carts
``educational tools'' for ``shopping techniques.''
   But some older people think the kiddy carts are hell on wheels.
   ``This is a grocery store, not a playground,'' said 68-year-old
Sylvie Aronowitz. ``I don't want them under my feet.''
   Publix introduced the tiny shopping carts in the fall, but the
company looked at demographics before deciding which of its 370
Florida stores would be equipped with them, said company spokesman
Bill Shroeder.
   ``The stores we have identified as having a majority of retirees
will not get any carts,'' Schroeder said.
   For many of Miami Beach's senior citizens, shopping is a daily
ritual that allows them to visit with neighbors while picking up a
few items they can easily carry home.
   Carol Green, 70, said she wouldn't mind the little carts _ which
haven't been introduced to her neighborhood store _ except that the
market is usually filled with older shoppers and the children would
probably ``get lost in the shuffle.''
   But in larger, suburban Publix stores, a small child pushing the
tiny replica of a regular grocery cart and tagging after an adult
has become a common sight.
   ``I think they're really great,'' said Lourdes Dergan, while her
4-year-old son, Joseph, pushed his mini-cart up and down the cereal
aisle in a store in a western section of Miami. ``It helps keep him
quiet while I shop.''
   Joseph placed a box of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles cereal on
top of the cookies, chocolate pudding and fruit already selected
for his little cart. Mother approved.
   ``He does all his own shopping,'' Dergan said. ``I think it
really teaches him to make decisions.''
   When asked if he liked having his own cart, Joseph said ``Yea,
it's fun.''
   But Barbara Palladino, a 43-year-old mother of five, has written
two letters complaining about the carts and says she won't shop at
Publix stores.
   ``I saw a mother with two children, each with a little cart,
blocking the entire aisle and it took three minutes for her to get
out of there,'' Palladino said. ``It's impossible for a mother to
control a situation like that. ...
   ``If they really wanted to help out mothers, they should put
little playgrounds in their store.''
   But Schroeder said there are usually only about 10 kiddy carts
in each of the stores, not enough to cause kiddy gridlock. More
than half the company's stores have the carts.
   They have become so popular that a little girl threw a tantrum
after she discovered all the carts were in use at one store.
Thieves make off with many of the carts, said Israel Reyes, the
dairy manager at a store in suburban Kendall.
   Publix is not the first supermarket chain to offer the kiddy
carts. They are in use at stores in Houston and other U.S. cities.
   Schroeder insists the carts are educational objects, not toys.
   ``The carts are teaching them to imitate their mother in
shopping techniques,'' Schroeder said. ``A number of mothers have
called to thank us for this.''
   ``We haven't observed any shopping with carefree abandon by
children,'' he said. ``The parents control what the child selects
and that's why the mothers perceive them as an educational tool.''
   Some senior citizens approve of the idea of child shoppers.
   ``We don't mind them at all,'' said May Jones, 67, who was
shopping with her husband, Mack Jones. ``I think they are fun tools
that can teach.''
   Mrs. Jones, who has seven grandchildren, said kids will probably
grab candy and cookies off the shelves and throw them in their
personal cart.
   ``Sure they'll try to get bad stuff,'' she said. ``That's when
you teach.''

<HEAD>Germany Became United Under Bismarck, Split After Hitler's Fall</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The Germany that was split into two after the May 1945 downfall
of Adolf Hitler's Third Reich had been a unified nation for less
than 75 years.
   It was a loose confederation of principalities in the 17th
century, but under Frederick II (1740-86), Prussia began emerging
as a European power.
   Prussia and Bavaria were expanded and many states were
eliminated by the Congress of Vienna following Napoleon's defeat.
   Otto von Bismarck, a Prussian, was bent on fashioning a ``little
Germany,'' one free from domination by the Austro-Hungarian Empire.
   After victories in the Austro-Prussian war of 1866 and the
Franco-Prussian war of 1870-71, William I was proclaimed the German
emperor and Germany became the chief European power.
   Europe's old order came crashing down in World War I, and
Germany, the loser, became the weak Weimar Republic in the
turbulent years that followed the Allied victory in November 1918.
   Hitler rose to power in 1933 and began his quest for world
domination that led to the 1939-45 cataclysm of World War II.
   Nazi Germany surrendered unconditionally to the Allied forces in
May 1945. Germany was divided into zones occupied by the four
Allied powers. The region that is now East Germany came under
Soviet control.
   Here is a look at major events that followed:
   1946 _ The Communist Party becomes the ruling political force in
East Germany.
   1949 _ The Allied powers form the Federal Republic of Germany,
or West Germany. The German Democratic Republic, or East Germany,
is officially founded as an independent state in the Soviet zone of
occupation.
   1953 _ East Germany puts down a workers' uprising with the help
of Soviet tanks.
   1961 _ Faced with an exodus of highly skilled East German
workers to the West, East Germany erects the Berlin Wall.
Dissatisfaction in East Germany persists in following years, while
West Germany becomes an economic powerhouse.
   August-September 1989 _ Tens of thousands of East Germans
seeking passage to West Germany pour into West German embassies in
Hungary, Poland and Czechoslovakia. Thousands slip into Austria
through Hungary.
   October _ Huge protests coincide with official commemorations of
the 40th anniversary of Communist rule in East Germany, and on Oct.
18 Egon Krenz replaces hard-line party chief Erich Honecker.
   November _ The Berlin Wall opens.
   December _ East German Prime Minister Hans Modrow urges closer
ties with West Germany and allows visa-free travel between the
Germanys.
   January _ Modrow meets Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in
Moscow and says Gorbachev is now more open to unification.
   Feb. 1 _ Modrow urges talks with West Germany toward an eventual
``united fatherland'' independent of military blocs and governed by
a joint parliament in Berlin.
   Feb. 2 _ West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher
says he's seeking support from the four World War II Allies _ the
United States, the Soviet Union, Britain and France _ for German
unification. Kohl meets Modrow the following day.
   Tuesday _ The Allies and the two Germanys agree on a process
aimed at German reunification. After the two Germanys confer on
settling legal, political and economic issues all six foreign
ministers will meet to discuss security issues.

   If the traditional Valentine's Day cards,
flowers and candy fail to satisfy, follow the example of the women
who brought their checkbooks and sought their holiday sweeties
direct from the auction block.
   The women, with their hearts in their wallets, bid for eligible
bachelors who strolled before them on a runway Tuesday night in an
auction to raise money for the YWCA.
   The rose-toting, tuxedo-clad fellows on display included a Wall
Street banker, lawyers and businessmen. The Y hoped to raise
$10,000 with the event; no figures were avilable at the close of
the night.
   The bidding for the 34 certifiably unattached males was loud,
fast and punctuated with laughter. Some of the men were nervous _
and some hammed it up.
   The bidders and their chattel were committed by contract to go
on a date before May 15. Many could be seen taking each others'
phone numbers after the bids were secured.
   Fun aside, ``the idea is to draw young women into the Y,'' said
New York YWCA executive director Lenore Parker.
   Bob Saslawsky, co-owner of an auto leasing company, said he was
glad to raise money for a charity but felt humiliated.
   ``You actually feel like a piece of meat. It's a total role
reversal,'' Saslawsky said.
   Bob Chandler, his business partner, raised his hands to the
ceiling in celebration when a striking young woman wrote out her
$450 check for him.
   ``Thank you, God!'' he screamed. ``Thank you, God!''
   The mystery woman declined to be interviewed.
   Gordon Ogden, a bond salesman at Bear Stearns &amp; Co., opened his
coat to show off his slender frame and twirled his red rose to the
squealing delight of the bidders.
   A strip show it wasn't, but ``it's the closest I'll ever get to
the stage at Chippendale's,'' said Michael Advocate, an attorney.
   Advocate, who topped off his tuxedo with a black cowboy hat,
drew the highest bidder _ a commitment of $1,100. He also landed
last year's high bid of $675.
   ``Maybe it's the hat,'' he quipped.
   Bachelor after bachelor paraded in front of the women, who
laughed, smirked, drank and bid for dates. Only single or legally
separated people over age 21 could participate.
   Many of the bachelors also fortified themselves at the bar
before taking the stage, and some even took their drinks on with
them.
   Stacey Cronin, a real estate assistant, said she wouldn't bid
more than $200, but when the gavel came down on bachelor number
two, Ms. Cronin smiled triumphantly _ then gasped when the
auctioneer announced her winning bid was $375.
   ``Oh my God! I can't believe I did it!'' Ms. Cronin said to no
one in particular. Later, she said: ``You know, it all happened so
fast. But I'm happy. It's fine. It's for charity.''
   Told that Ms. Cronin had gone above her spending limit, her
catch, Wayne W. Wales, grinned and said jokingly: ``Basically, I'm
worth it. Actually, I thought I'd go for more.''

<HEAD>Romantics Flock to Nevada ``Quickie'' Chapels to Tie the Knot</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RENO, Nev. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Valentine's Day means candy, flowers or kisses
for most people, but hundreds are flocking to Nevada's ``quickie''
wedding chapels today to tie the knot on one of the busiest days of
the year for nuptials.
   At the Chapel of the Bells early today, Scott Carlson, 23, and
Moon Yo Young, 21, _ were married 14 seconds after midnight as the
Reno couple sought to be the state's first newlyweds on Valentine's
Day, said Colleen Loftis, a chapel employee.
   Chapel owner George Flint said Tuesday many couples come to his
chapel on Valentine's because they're ``more romantic.''
   ``They plan this for months. It's a tradition,'' he said. ``I've
been in this business since the '60s and hadn't really realized
until about 10 years ago that it was a big deal to get married on
Valentine's Day.''
   At Las Vegas' Candlelight Wedding Chapel, owner Gordon Gust had
100 wedding ceremonies scheduled Tuesday and 160 planned for today.
His 24-hour record is 315 wedding ceremonies performed by five
ministers on a Valentine's Day that fell on a weekend.
   The Clark County Marriage Certificate Bureau in Las Vegas sold
302 marriage certificates on Valentine's Day last year. On a normal
weekday, 200 couples marry, and the number will double on a
Saturday or Sunday. In Reno, marriage bureau supervisor Marietta
Draeger said up to 500 couples have married on the romantic holiday.
   ``It just depends on the day. If Valentine's falls on a weekend
and the weather is nice you get a lot more people,'' she explained.
``The weather has a lot to do with how many people come in.''
   An unromantic cold front moved across the Sierra Nevada on
Tuesday, scattering snow across the mountains overnight. Today was
expected to be clear with temperatures below freezing.
   Flint said 1,600 weddings are performed in Las Vegas in a
typical week, 600 in Reno and 300 in the Lake Tahoe-Carson City
area. Eighty percent of the couples are from California, 5 percent
from Nevada and the remainder from other states.
   Three-day holiday weekends also are busy as are the final days
of the year when couples are looking for a tax break, Flint said.
   Beside the quick ceremony, wedding chapels are popular with the
cost-conscious.
   Big weddings run several thousand dollars compared to the
chapels dotting many downtown Reno streets, decorated in red hearts
and bearing names like the Hitching Post and Cupid's Chapel of
Love. Add-ons such as flowers, video or audiotape, garters,
tuxedos, wedding gowns and even rings can run up the tab.
   ``We can get you in and out for $34.50, our cheapest package,''
Flint said. ``That doesn't include the $27 license fee. But it goes
up from there.''

<HEAD>Buster Declared Champ; Rematch Shaping up</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A rematch is in the works between Mike Tyson and
Buster Douglas, who has been crowned undisputed heavyweight boxing
champ after three days of bickering over the long count.
   Tyson said Tuesday he was ``still one of the best fighters in
the world'' and would prove it in a rematch being sought by his
promoter, Don King.
   King said he was trying to wrap up the rematch for Atlantic
City, N.J., around June 18.
   ``We don't have a rematch right now, but we're trying to get
one,'' said King.
   It was King who started the controversy by protesting that the
referee counted too long over Douglas when he was knocked down in
the eighth round in Sunday's fight in Tokyo.
   The International Boxing Federation recognized Douglas as
champion immediately after his 10-round knockout, and the World
Boxing Council extended recognition Monday night after King dropped
his protest.
   The World Boxing Association became the last of the sport's
three major governing bodies to recognize him.
   Douglas took the news calmly at his home in Columbus, Ohio,
saying the ``main thing for me is that I am now looked upon as the
heavyweight champion of the world. It was a lifelong dream come
true, and I thank God for that.''

   Mstislav Rostropovich returned to the Soviet
concert stage after 16 years of exile, leading his U.S. orchestra
in a rousing version of John Philip Sousa's ``Stars and Stripes
Forever.''
   Asked how he chose that bit of defiance, Rostropovich said
later, ``From my heart.''
   The late Leonid Brezhnev had banished Rostropovich for refusing
to renounce his principles and denounce his friend, exiled author
Alexander Solzhenitsyn. But the cellist and conductor came back to
a homeland where Brezhnev, and not he, was discredited.
   Rostropovich returned as the world-renowned director of the
national symphony of the Soviet Union's rival superpower. Among
those who attended the concert was President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
wife, Raisa.
   Washington's National Symphony Orchestra responded to
Rostropovich's emotional return with a brilliant performance in
which every song was a symbol _ from Tchaikovsky's ``Pathetique''
Symphony No. 6, the last piece he conducted in the Soviet Union in
1974 _ to the ``Stars and Stripes.''
   Flanked by baskets of carnations and the U.S. and Soviet flags,
Rostropovich and the National Symphony held the audience rapt.
Clutches of army recruits who had been helping with crowd control
listened intently.
   Rostropovich, 62, began with ``Barber's Adagio for Strings'' and
moved on to the Tchaikovsky symphony. He finished the main concert
with the wildly varying emotions and styles of the Symphony No. 5
of Dmitri Shostakovich, whose grave he had visited immediately on
arrival in Moscow.
   After five bows to cries of ``Bravo!'' and tumultuous applause,
Rostropovich moved into an encore of a brief Shostakovich polka,
and was drawn back for three more encores.
   After the concert, he plowed through fans, musicians,
instruments and trunks stuffed into the narrow backstage corridors
of the Moscow Conservatory, and emerged in a light snowfall a few
blocks from the Kremlin. As he climbed into an official car to
drive to a reception in his honor at the U.S. ambassador's
residence, a young woman ran up and cried, ``Marvelous! Simply
marvelous!''
   At the Spaso House party, he tossed off vodkas in true Russian
style and enveloped longtime friends with hugs.
   Rostropovich and his wife, soprano Galina Vishnevskaya, left the
Soviet Union in 1974 after years of harassment for their unwavering
support for Solzhenitsyn, the Nobel Prize-winning author of the
``Gulag Archipelago,'' which documented the Soviet political prison
camps.
   Four years later, the Soviets took the Rostropovichs'
citizenship away for being ``ideological degenerates.''
   Rostropovich had become an internationally famous cellist by age
30 and lived a life of luxury and world travel. But all that
changed when he became friends with Solzhenitsyn in the late 1960s.
   At a time when dozens of prominent Russians joined in a chorus
of derision of the author, Rostropovich housed Solzhenitsyn at his
dacha for four years. He sent a letter to four newspapers in 1970
saying Solzhenitsyn had suffered for speaking the truth. All
refused to publish it.
   The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet legislature restored the
citizenship of Rostropovich and his wife just a month ago, and
nullified the decree that stripped them of all their medals and
honors.
   Rostropovich's four-concert tour was arranged within days.
   The new Soviet Minister of culture, Nikolai Gubenko, apologized
in an article in the journal New Times for the injustice of
stripping the couple of citizenship. ``The deplorable violation of
human dignity should never be repeated,'' he said.

   A refugee who twice floated to freedom from Cuba
said he will never return to his homeland again _ unless it's to
battle the government of Fidel Castro.
   Jorge Diaz and Fransisco Gomez Rodrigues, who arrived here the
first time in August, went back to Cuba secretly in January to
fetch their families.
   But they were taken into custody and imprisoned for a month
before they were dispatched in the same 16-foot boat they arrived
in _ this time flooded with gasoline, and lacking a working engine,
oars or even food, according to Diaz.
   ``If I go back again it will be in an invasion force,'' he said.
``That's the only way I'm going back to Cuba _ when Fidel falls.''
   The voyage of Diaz and Gomez is apparently the first time Cuban
refugees have repeated the hazardous journey across the Florida
Straits, immigration officials said.
   At the start of the second crossing, Diaz didn't believe he'd
ever make it to Miami.
   Cuban border guards abandoned them in their boat 30 miles
offshore and tossed the engine key into the boat, but it bounced
into the water, Diaz said Tuesday as he sat in the Krome Avenue
Detention Center in Miami.
   ``I asked them why they didn't just shoot us and save the
trouble,'' the 37-year-old Diaz said. ``They said they were under
orders from the Interior Minister.''
   The longtime friends believed they would die at sea, with their
families in Miami and Cuba never knowing their fate, Diaz said.
   Gomez, 31, could not be interviewed Tuesday. He was hospitalized
with a kidney stone condition aggravated by the boat ride,
Immigration and Naturalization Service officials said.
   INS officials have interviewed the two men, said Vincent
Intenzo, deportation supervisor at Krome. ``I believe them _ they
have been interviewed several times and their stories are
consistent,'' he said.
   In their first voyage from Cuba, they traveled with four others
in a small plastic boat. But the engine failed and their one-day
food supply was quickly exhausted, Diaz said.
   The boat drifted for five days, until the group was rescued by
the Coast Guard about 95 miles off the Florida Keys.
   They spent two weeks in an INS processing center, then worked in
restaurants and odd jobs until they had bought a Volkswagen and
saved $250. They began to make plans to bring their families from
Cuba, including Diaz's wife, who gave birth last month to their
first child.
   They traded the car and the money for a 16-foot boat, outfitted
it with an outboard motor and gas tanks and early Jan. 6 left the
Keys' city of Marathon.
   Just off Havana, bad weather blew them off course, marooning
them on a small rock island, Diaz said. The next morning a
fisherman _ an acquaintence of Diaz's _ spotted them, and the Cuban
border patrol boat showed up.
   The two were taken to a prison in Matanzas province, east of
Havana, Diaz said. They begged to inform their families, but the
guards refused.
   ``At one point, they told me don't worry _ our families would
never know we were in Cuba,'' Diaz said. ``I thought they were
going to shoot us right there, because that was the only way my
family would never know.''
   But early Feb. 5, they were taken by a Cuban patrol vessel about
30 miles offshore, told to get into their boat, and left.
   Their only sustenance on the second trip was a little water left
in a tank filled the month before. Three days out, a Cuban
freighter approached them but the captain said he had been warned
not to pick them up, Diaz said.
   On the seventh day, by now semi-delirious, they spotted a vessel
in the darkness and desperately signaled with a flashlight. The
U.S. tanker Chestnut Hill rescued them and called the Coast Guard.
   When the Coast Guard arrived, Diaz said they had a surprise.
   ``It was one of the same crewmen who picked us up the first time
_ I talked to him and he remembered us,'' Diaz laughed.
   Diaz and Gomez are renewing their requests for political asylum.
Usually, Cuban refugees are released while their cases are pending.

<HEAD>Aspen Voters Defeat Fur Ban, Favor Growth Proposals</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Voters rejected by a 2-1 margin an attempt
to make this Alpine resort the nation's first furrier-free town
despite a campaign that attracted animal rights activists from as
far away as Sweden.
   Residents also voted Tuesday for growth, defeating by 1,561 to
1,051 a measure to reduce the size of a luxury hotel by 25 percent,
and approving measures to widen the highway leading into town and a
bond measure to build employee housing.
   The winners hailed the results as a victory for free enterprise.
   The losers conceded that the mood in the town, home to ``gonzo''
journalist Hunter S. Thompson and other eccentrics, had taken a
lurch beyond the bourgeois.
   ``People seem more concerned with business and monetary gain
than other values,'' said Katharine Thalberg, who with her husband,
Mayor Bill Stirling, led the fight for the fur-sale ban. ``They
want a larger hotel, a bigger highway ... there does seem to be a
value shift here in town.''
   ``The big winners are the people of Aspen. We can get back to
business and welcome our guests back who've been staying away
because of all this,'' said Mark Kirkland, manager of Revillon
furs, one of Aspen's four fur shops.
   The results set the stage for a recall election next month for
Stirling and three city councilmen who backed the ban.
   While furriers gave live interviews on national television
networks Tuesday night, anti-fur activists heckled them and waved
``Go to Vail'' signs, much to the chagrin of Aspen business
operators fearing a lose of customers to the neighboring ski resort.
   Despite losing by 1,701 to 898, Stirling and Thalberg claimed
victory by attracting attention to the issue.
   ``In terms of public opinion and world opinion, we won,''
Thalberg said.
   Animal-rights activists said furs are made from creatures that
have been raised and slaughtered under cruel conditions.
   Kirkland, who represented the furriers' interests, had little to
say about any national impact.
   ``I'm glad we won. I'm glad it's over,'' he said.
   The fur-fighting campaign brought animal rights activists from
England, Sweden and the Netherlands, adding more spice to the brew
of beautiful people who swing in and out of the chic, expensive
mountain town.
   Aspen has 3,700 registered voters and a population said to dip
from a peak of 20,000 in the winter to 7,000 in the summer.
   Many property owners don't live here full time, and real estate
prices have skyrocketed during the past decade.
   ``This hotel and the other growth issues decide whether Aspen
will be a town of eclectic people or eccentrics like me, or a big
money machine,'' said Nick de Wolf, a retired engineer and
inventor. ``I'm afraid the results are pretty clear.''
   Aspen was the first U.S. community to pass a tough anti-smoking
ordinance and the first to declare itself a nuclear-free zone.

<HEAD>Attacks on Controversial Politicians Mar Election Campaign</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Attacks on two politicians and threats to at least
two others have marred the campaign for parliamentary elections
Sunday and led to tightened security for the 953 candidates.
   An anonymous caller said a bomb was planted today on a flight
carrying opposition Socialist Party leader Takako Doi, police
reported. No bomb was found, and police refused comment on the
motive for the hoax.
   On Tuesday, Koichi Hamada of the governing Liberal Democratic
Party was beaten over the head with a steel rod following a
campaign rally east of Tokyo. He suffered moderate injuries.
   Police said they arrested Minoru Uzawa, 27, a member of one of
Japan's largest crime syndicates, on suspicion of assault. They
said Uzawa, 27, told them he attacked Hamada because he ``disliked
him.''
   On Sunday, a member of a rightist group entered former Prime
Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's campaign office in Takasaki, 60 miles
northwest of Tokyo, and fired shots at a television set, a campaign
poster and a doll symbolizing good luck, police said. None of the
11 people in the office was injured.
   The assailant, 23-year-old Koji Konishi, reportedly told police
he didn't intend to kill anyone, but disliked Nakasone and wanted
to ``create a ruckus'' to show the rest of Japan how the politician
``had made a fool of the Japanese people.''
   On Jan. 18, another right-wing extremist shot and severely
wounded Mayor Hitoshi Motoshima of Nagasaki, who had angered
right-wing groups by suggested the late Emperor Hirohito might
share some responsibility for Japan's aggression in World War II.
   Twenty-seven important politicians in postwar Japan have been
assaulted, police say. Most were controversial figures who angered
right-wing fringe groups.
   Ultrarightists have grown increasingly violent in the past month
after keeping a low profile during a year of mourning following
Hirohito's death on Jan. 7, 1989. Although guns are outlawed in
Japan, rightist extremists are believed to use their ties with
criminal syndicates to procure weapons.
   Rightist groups are believed angered by links of Nakasone and
other governing party leaders to the Recruit influence-buying
scandal. Many conservative politicians were known to have profited
in the scandal while Nakasone was prime minister.
   Nakasone, who resigned from the Liberal Democrats last year over
the scandal, is seeking re-election to the 512-seat lower house as
an independent.
   Police said they were investigating the motive behind the attack
on Hamada, a senior Liberal Democrat who also is seeking
re-election to the lower house.
   A former member of a criminal gang and vehement anti-communist,
Hamada was forced to resign from his post as chairman of
Parliament's Budget Committee two years ago after he refused to
apologize for calling then-Japan Communist Party leader Kenji
Miyamoto a ``murderer.''
   Following the attack on Motoshima, police offered protection to
any candidate who might face a threat _ an offer not extended
beyond party leaders in past elections.
   Hundreds of uniformed and plainclothes polices have appeared at
rallies attended by Ms. Doi, the Socialist leader. On Tuesday, they
seized a drunken man and led him away after he tried to approach
her at a rally in northern Japan.

<HEAD>Two Men Acquitted on Illegal Log Export Charges</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Two men were acquitted on charges of
illegally exporting to Japan logs cut from federal land in what was
believed to be the first time anyone had been tried for violating
the law.
   A federal court jury Tuesday acquitted log dealer John J.
Tortorelli of Bellevue, Wash., and part-time dealer Winston Bentley
of Spokane, Wash., of all charges.
   Tortorelli and Bentley were accused of having the logs' federal
markings sawed off because they knew they were for export.
   Federal law prohibits the export of raw logs cut from national
forests. The logs must be processed in U.S. mills, where prices are
much less than foreign mills.
   Jack Davis, a U.S. Forest Service investigator, said he was
surprised that the men were acquitted, but said the fact the jury
chose to believe the defendants is ``indicative of the complexity
of investigations of that type.''
   Preparation of the case took two years, he said.
   Tortorelli was accused of buying truckloads of logs cut on
Forest Service land in western Montana, northern Idaho and eastern
Washington in 1987 and 1988, and then selling them to Japanese
exporting companies on the West Coast.
   Bentley, a church janitor, helped inspect and handle some of the
timber at a processing center in Mead, Wash., prosecutors said.
   Prosecutors believed the case was the first time anyone was
prosecuted for violating the export ban.
   The defense argued that any export of the logs handled by
Tortorelli and Bentley was accidental, and that the men should not
be punished for any unintentional violations of federal law.
   The government gave immunity to truck drivers Duane Farmer and
Roger Britz, of Emunclaw, Wash., in exchange for testimony that was
expected to substantiate the charges. However, their testimony
largely supported the defense's version of events.

<TEXT>
   Attorneys representing four people accused of
burning an American flag want a judge to strike down the new
federal flag-desecration law, saying it violates the free-speech
guarantees symbolized by Old Glory.
   A hearing today before U.S. District Judge Barbara Rothstein is
the first constitutional challenge of the Flag Protection Act of
1989, according to David Cole, a defense attorney.
   Congress passed the law in October in response to the U.S.
Supreme Court decision that burning the Stars and Stripes is
protected under First Amendment guarantees of free speech.
   In that case, the court struck down a Texas law that banned
burning of the flag.
   ``Congress' new flag law is just as unconstitutional as the
statute struck down,'' Cole said. ``If we are to have freedom of
expression, people must be just as free to burn the flag to express
dissent as they are free to wave the flag to express approval of
the government.''
   Mark Haggerty, Carlos Garza, Darius Allen Strong and Jennifer
Campbell are charged with burning a flag outside a Seattle post
office shortly after midnight on Oct. 28, the day the law went into
effect.
   They have pleaded innocent and have moved to have those charges
dismissed on grounds the act violates the First Amendment to the
Constitution.
   Cole said Tuesday he planned to cite Texas vs. Johnson, the
Supreme Court ruling last June that overturned a Texas conviction
against Gregory Lee Johnson, who burned a flag at the 1984
Republican National Convention.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark Bartlett, who was handling the
government's case, did not immediately return telephone messages
Tuesday for comment.
   Cole said the U.S. House and Senate have filed
friend-of-the-court briefs and attorneys for both legislative
bodies were expected to speak.
   Cole said he did not expect the judge to issue a ruling today.
If she denies the motion, he said, the defendants would appeal
directly to the Supreme Court, as provided under the act.
   The trial for the four is set for Feb. 26. In addition to the
flag-desecration counts, each is charged with one count of
depredation of government property.
   Conviction on the flag-desecration and destruction-of-property
counts each carries a maximum penalty of one year in prison and a
$100,000 fine.
   President Bush had sought a constitutional amendment to ban flag
burning, but that was rejected by Congress, which passed the flag
statute instead. Bush administration officials have said they doubt
the flag-desecration law would withstand a court challenge.

   Imprisoned soul singer James Brown has
been approved to participate in a work-release program, but details
still must be worked out, officials say.
   Several radio stations and the Benedict College music department
are interested in the singer's talents.
   But the ``Godfather of Soul'' is leaning toward educating young
people about the evils of drugs, said his attorney, Richard Crane
of Nashville, Tenn., who was busy fielding numerous job offers for
Brown on Tuesday.
   ``Radio stations in Columbia, Charleston and North Augusta are
interested in him as a disc jockey,'' Crane said, and Benedict
College ``has expressed interest in James working in the music
department.''
   Corrections Department spokesman Bennish Brown confirmed Tuesday
that Brown's application for work release had been granted.
   Crane said, ``Now all he needs is a bed and a job.''
   The spokesman said there are waiting lists for beds at the
department's seven work-release centers, including those in
Richland and Aiken counties, where Brown has expressed a preference.
   ``We're now down to a different waiting game,'' he said. ``We
need to match a job with a work-release center.''
   Participation in the program will require him to stay overnight
in a work-release center while working.
   He also would be banned from any out-of-state employment.
   Brown is serving a six-year sentence in State Park Correctional
Center in Columbia for failing to stop for police, aggravated
assault and weapons violations in connection with a 1988 two-state
car chase that began in Georgia.
   Brown, who becomes eligible for parole May 5, 1991, applied for
work release in December.

<HEAD>Rough Seas, High Winds Halt Cleanup</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HUNTINGTON BEACH, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   High winds and rough waves today
blew ashore a gooey black tide from an oil spill, halting cleanup
efforts as officials feared shoreline workers might get swept to
sea.
   Officials tripled the size of cleanup crews to 1,120 as the
worst accumulation of crude oil from last week's spill swept onto
miles of beach.
   But treacherous seas, with waves up to 7 feet high, brought a
nighttime halt to cleanup efforts that had been around the clock
since just after the 400,000-gallon spill from the tanker American
Trader.
   Crews were sent home Tuesday as high tide approached and onshore
winds began gusting to 30 mph, said Coast Guard Lt. Richard Booth.
   ``The winds were kicking up a lot of sand and it was just
impossible for people to work,'' Booth said.
   Offshore, 13 of the 16 oil skimming boats also temporarily
suspended cleanup work because of choppy seas, he said.
   The patched-up American Trader moved into Long Beach Harbor this
morning and tied up at an Atlantic Richfield Co. dock to unload the
remaining 21 million gallons of crude oil in its tanks and begin
hull puncture repairs.
   Waves of grimy crude fouled six miles of sand along a 12-mile
stretch of beach southeast of downtown Los Angeles _ at Huntington
Beach, Newport Beach and Bolsa Chica State Beach. The oil has
killed 86 birds and coated 261 in oil.
   ``I'm disgusted,'' surfer Bill Casper said, watching the black
tide roll in at his favorite surf spot near Huntington Beach Pier.
``It's going to affect the beach for years. There will be tar on
the beach for years.''
   About 1,000 grunion, small silver fish resembling sardines, died
during a weekend ``run'' along the Orange County coastline, said
state Department of Fish and Game spokesman Patrick Moore.
   Grunion spawn with frantic dashes onto the beach at high tide to
lay eggs in the soft sand. Any eggs left behind in the oil-soaked
sand were not expected to hatch, Moore said.
   The daily price tag for the beach cleanup is $750,000, with the
bill through Tuesday reaching $4 million, said James H. Ross,
president and chief executive of British Petroleum American Inc.,
which chartered the ship.
   The oil leak Feb. 7 came as the tanker tried to moor at an oil
pipeline delivery point about two miles offshore.
   Eric Bush, a 19-year-old deckhand on the American Trader, said
Tuesday that oil poured from the hull after he let down the 12-ton
starboard anchor.
   Bush said the anchors were being lowered ``just the way we
always do'' when he felt two sharp jolts a few minutes apart. He
first thought the 811-foot ship had plowed an undersea mud bank,
but a look overboard proved otherwise.
   ``The water was just boiling with crude,'' Bush said.
   British Petroleum is coordinating most of the cleanup but is not
expected to pay for final costs, which likely will come out of the
insurance of the ship's owner, American Trading Transportation Co.,
Ross said.
   Gov. George Deukmejian held off on a request by Huntington Beach
Mayor Tom Mays to declare an emergency since he said most of the
cleanup was being handled privately.
   ``As far as we can tell, there are no needs that are not being
met,'' said Eileen Baumgardner, assistant director of the state
Office of Emergency Services.
   Cleanup crews grew Tuesday to 1,120 workers, and 300 others were
being trained.
   One of the first lawsuits in connection with the spill has been
filed by an 86-year-old former congressman.
   The class-action lawsuit, filed Tuesday by Chet Holifield in Los
Angeles federal court, seeks compensation for damage and economic
losses caused by the spill and the alleged failure to properly
clean up the oil. Among the defendants named are British Petroleum
and American Trading.

   The dollar was mixed in early European trading
today, and gold prices fell.
   Foreign currency dealers said the market was trying to position
itself for the latest set of U.S. trade figures due out on Friday.
   Barring any news events, they predicted trading would settle
into a narrow range.
   In Tokyo, where trading ends as Europe's business day begins,
the dollar fell 0.13 yen to a closing 144.35 yen. Later, in London,
it was quoted at 144.45 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Tuesday:
   _1.6757 West German marks, down from 1.6760
   _1.4965 Swiss francs, up from 1.4960
   _5.7005 French francs, up from 5.6995
   _1.8895 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8980
   _1,244.50 Italian lire, down from 1,248.00
   _1.2038 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1995
   In London, the dollar fell against the British pound, and was
quoted at $1.6928, compared with $1.6907 late Tuesday.
   Gold opened in London at a bid price of $417.30 a troy ounce,
down from $418.65 bid late Tuesday. At midmorning, the city's major
bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $416.00.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $415.90, down from $419.75 late
Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $3.93 to close at a bid $415.65.
   Silver fell in London to a bid price of $5.32 a troy ounce, from
Tuesday's $5.35.

   Thousands of angry teachers left their
classrooms for a day of rallies calling for better pay, and hooted
the governor when he told them the state's $700 million budget
surplus was already committed.
   About 13,000 teachers walked off the job Tuesday and another
8,000 or more colleagues and supporters packed rallies in various
cities.
   Gov. Booth Gardner was hecked and jeered by hundreds of teachers
in the capitol rotunda when he gave his bottom line _ ``This is not
the session to talk about additional salaries.''
   The surplus funds are going to children's programs, unexpected
increases in school enrollments, welfare caseloads and other
programs, Gardner said.
   A Seattle rally attracted at least 3,500 teachers and
supporters. Afterwards, the throng marched through downtown,
handing out leaflets that said state teachers' salaries had plunged
in a decade from fourth to 21st in the nation.
   Teachers on average earn about $31,000 a year, plus a
supplemental contract of about $2,000 and benefits worth about
$9,100, according to the state budget office.
   West Virginia's 22,000 teachers, whose average salary of $21,904
ranks them 48th nationally, planned a statewide walkout Thursday to
demand a raise. Gov. Gaston Caperton said the money is unavailable.
   Washington teachers are getting a two-year, 10 percent pay boost
but have demanded that $225 million of the surplus be used to
double their salary hikes.
   The teachers' action provided about 200,000 students a winter
play day, according to teacher-union estimates.
   The walkout had been cleared with administrators in most
districts, but in two districts, teachers walked off the job and
left their classrooms to substitutes.
   ``I'll be docked $200, but I don't care,'' said Randy Walden, a
social studies teacher in Puyallup, east of Olympia. ``We felt so
strongly, we walked out.''
   ``We're tired of promises,'' said Jeff Page, a teacher in Lake
Stevens, north of Seattle. ``I've been teaching 12 years and they
keep saying we'll do better when times are better. ..
   ``We have a Democratic governor who calls himself the education
governor and Democrats in charge of the House and they haven't done
a thing to help us. I'm irate. There is a possibility of a real
strike next year.''

   AT&amp;T sweetened Valentine's Day for
long-distance lovers by cutting its rates by a third for the day.
   The discount was announced as a peace offering to customers
shortly after the Jan. 15 outage that kept millions of
long-distance calls from being completed.
   The company is offering an average of 33 percent off regular
daytime rates for calls within the United States between 8 a.m. and
5 p.m, said spokeswoman Lynn Newman, with discounts averaging about
37 percent off for overseas calls.
   In some states where local utility regulators have given the
company permission, discounts also will apply to intra-state calls
handled by AT&amp;T, she said.
   A programming error in AT&amp;T's call switching network partially
knocked out long distance service nationwide for about nine hours
in last month's outage.
   On Valentine's Day last year, the company recorded 107.9 million
telephone calls. In 1988, when it fell on a weekend, AT&amp;T
registered 48.9 million calls.

<TEXT>
   Three teen-agers who took
14 hostages on a school bus were arrested after releasing all but
one of their captives and leading authorities on a brief chase.
   The hostages included 13 secondary school students and the bus
driver. All were released unharmed although one girl was later
taken to a hospital for treatment of shock, said Royal Canadian
Mounted Police.
   The youths who seized the bus Tuesday in this town 300 miles
north of Vancouver were armed with two sawed-off rifles, a
.303-caliber and a .22-caliber semiautomatic, said RCMP Inspector
Merv Harrower.
   The youths, two 18-year-olds and a 14-year-old, were due to
appear today in provincial court. Their names were not released.
   Harrower, at a news conference, declined to say what charges
would be filed.
   The youths commandeered the bus as it was taking students home
from school and ordered the driver to drive to a car dealership,
Sgt. Elles Peleskey said.
   Two of the 13 students aboard the bus were released shortly
after the bus arrived at the Sunland Motors lot, he said.
   Police sharpshooters were sent to the scene and the downtown
area closed off. No shots were fired by either side.
   About 2{ hours into the standoff, police supplied the trio with
a getaway car and allowed them to take one of the male students
with them.
   The youths drove north out of Prince George, turned off the main
highway onto a side road to elude police, but crashed into a
snowbank and were captured, Harrower said.

<HEAD>Rebels Claim Killing More Than 2,000 Ethiopian Soldiers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Ethiopian rebel groups, fighting on
separate fronts, claim to have killed nearly 2,500 government
soldiers during weekend battles in two northern provinces.
   It was not possible to independently verify the rebel claims,
made in broadcasts from their clandestine radio stations.
   The Eritrea People's Liberation Front today said its fighters
killed 600 government soldiers in fighting Sunday near Karan, in
Ethiopia's northermost province, Eritrea.
   Tuesday night, the Tigre People's Liberation Front said it put
5,344 soldiers out of action in fighting Saturday and Sunday around
Wichale and Mersa in Wollo province on the main road north from the
capital, Addis Ababa.
   ``In the attack, 1,813 soldiers were killed, 2,520 were wounded
and 1,011 soldiers were captured,'' the Tigrean rebels said.
Wichale and Mersa are about 200 miles from Addis Ababa.
   The Eritreans, who launched their first major offensive in a
year last week, said they had ``put a total of 1,500 out of action
in the offensive.'' The offensive followed two attempts at
negotiations to end the 28-year-old insurgency.
   The Tigreans have controlled their home province since early
last year. In August, they claimed a series of battlefield
victories as they moved west to Gonder province and south to Wollo
and Showa provinces.
   Early this year, the government launched a counteroffensive and
claimed to have retaken some of territory.
   But on Saturday, the ``Voice of The Broad Masses of Eritrea''
radio announced the offensive along a front 125 miles long and the
capture of Massawa, one of Ethiopia's only two ports on the Red Sea
coast. The fighting around Karan 55 miles west of Massawa began
Sunday.
   The rebels said they destroyed eight government brigades, about
12,000 men, sank nine naval vessels and captured 46 tanks in three
days of fighting.
   Ethiopian officials accused the Eritreans of launching the
offensive Thursday to relieve pressure on the Tigreans by
government troops.
   The Tigrean and Eritrean rebels have different goals but they
have coordinated their attacks in the past.
   The Eritreans have been fighting since 1962 for the independence
of Eritrea, a former Italian colony.
   The Tigreans took up arms in 1975 and seek President Mengistu
Haile Mariam's ouster and the establishment of a government
patterned after that of Albania, the last hard-line Marxist state
in Eastern Europe.
   Relief officials say the fighting around Massawa has halted
efforts to feed drought victims in northern Ethiopia, leaving
50,000 tons of food stored at the port.
   The food is part of 700,000 tons of emergency food the United
Nations hoped to deliver over the next months to 4 million people
threatened with famine, most of them in Eritrea and Tigrea.
   In Khartoum, the capital of Ethiopia's western neighbor, Sudan,
officials said 24,000 Ethiopians had crossed the border this month
to escape renewed fighting in Eritea.

<TEXT>
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney today
pledged no ``drastic reduction'' of U.S. troop strength in South
Korea and said America's commitment to its Asian ally remains
strong.
   However, he was expected to press for a sharp increase in the
South Korea's financial support for the 43,000 U.S. troops who are
stationed here under a 1954 mutual defense treaty signed after the
Korean war.
   ``U.S. troops will remain in Korea as long as they are needed to
guarantee the peace, and the Korean and American peoples and
governments want them to remain,'' Cheney said after arriving from
Hawaii on the first stop of a two-week tour of Asian nations
hosting U.S. forces.
   ``The U.S. commitment to Korea remains firm and unequivocal ...
speculation regarding a U.S. withdrawal from the peninsula or
drastic reduction of our troop presence here apparently disregards
the obvious: the threat to peace on the peninsula remains real and
has not diminished,'' he added.
   Greeting Cheney, South Korean Defense Minister Lee Sang Hoon
said the two nations were meeting at a time when military tension
between South Korea and hardline communist North Korea ``remains
undiminished,'' but he said the two allied nations would work
closely together to provide for a stable and peaceful Asia.
   Cheney, before leaving Hawaii on Tuesday, said the threat from
North Korea remains ``very high.''
   ``If there's one place in the world where as secretary of
defense I get up in the morning worried about the possibility you
could have a short-warning or a no-notice attack against U.S.
forces, it's in Korea,'' Cheney told the Pacific and Asian Affairs
Council in Honolulu.
   The defense secretary planned to spend three days in South
Korea, including a trip to the demilitarized zone 35 miles north of
Seoul.
   On Sunday, he goes to the Philippines for a round of meetings
Monday with Philippines officials _ but apparently not with
President Corazon Aquino who has said she will not meet with him.
   Although Cheney has said he will have plenty to keep him busy,
the Aquino snub drew a rare public rebuff from President Bush,
according to a published report.
   ``She can learn a great deal from Dick Cheney about the way we
view the very important United States presence in the Pacific,''
the president said Tuesday in an interview with New York Newsday.
   ``Maybe you could learn from the man _ or he could learn from
you, Madame President,'' Bush said in the interview in remarks
aimed at the Philippine leader, who turned aside a coup attempt
Dec. 1 with the help of U.S. Phantom jets.
   In announcing the would not meet Cheney, Aquino said the United
States has failed to follow through on pledges of economic aid and
also took offense at U.S. blaming the December coup attempt in part
on corruption and inefficiency in her government.
   Bush denied in the interview that he was angry. ``There's no
problem,'' he said. ``She's given her opinion. I'm right to give
mine.''
   Meanwhile, a senior Pentagon official traveling with Cheney told
reporters the secretary and his delegation intend to ask South
Korea to increase its $300 million annual contribution to the U.S.
defense to around $700 million by 1993.
   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he
expected the discussion to be ``a very difficult one'' for both
sides and that no specific resolution was anticipated during the
secretary's visit.
   The money issue also is troublesome because the South Koreans
argue they contribute more than $2 billion to the U.S. forces
annually through such things as the use of prime real estate in
downtown Seoul for the U.S. military headquarters and an 18-hole
golf course.
   The official said the delegation intends to suggest some numbers
to the South Koreans but he didn't expect a resolution until
October. The official said the Asian nations hosting U.S. forces
``are very sensitive to being pushed around about money.''
   ``The important thing is the trend. Are they moving in the right
direction,'' the official said, describing the negotiations as
``sort of a Kabuki,'' referring to the stylized Japanese dance.
   The official said another issue on the agenda will be working
out details for the co-production arrangement for the sale of FA-18
Hornet fighter jets made by McDonnell Douglas Corp.
   The $4.2 billion sale has sparked some controversy on Capitol
Hill over concern that some of the sensitive technology in the
fighter would allow the South Koreans to develop their own aviation
industry to compete with U.S. firms. The sale requires
congressional approval.
   Under the plan the South Koreans would buy a dozen planes,
assemble three dozen more from U.S.-supplied kits and co-produce 72
in Korean factories with the help of the U.S. contractor.
   Cheney has backed the arrangement as a means of helping the
Republic of Korea upgrade its air defenses.
   The United States spends about $2.6 billion a year on troops in
South Korea and Cheney has come under severe pressure to reduce the
numbers and increase the support from nations with booming
economies that benefit by the U.S. protection.
   Some lawmakers, unhappy with the U.S.-Korean trade imbalance,
have called for pulling at least 5,000 troops from the peninsula
while others want to slash the force to 10,000 soldiers.
   Even though Cheney said at the outset of his two-week tour of
South Korea, Japan, Hong Kong and the Philippines that he sees no
need to ``drastically reduce'' U.S. forces in the Pacific, he has
said ``adjustments'' would be made.
   Talk of a reduced U.S. presence has become more common amid the
revolutionary changes sweeping the Soviet Union, but Cheney warned
while in Hawaii that the United States must be ready for any change
in Soviet policy, and the threats from other sources such as
communist North Korea.

<HEAD>Bar Association's Policy-Making Body Adopts Pro-Choice Resolution</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The American Bar Association approved by a
2-1 margin a resolution opposing government intervention in a
woman's decision to end a pregnancy.
   The ABA's House of Delegates passed the resolution 238-106
Tuesday after about 2{ hours of debate and attempts by opponents to
defer the resolution, said Estell Rogers, a chairwoman of the ABA's
Rights of Women Committee.
   It was the first time the ABA has taken a stand on abortion
itself, although the bar association has issued policy statements
calling for uniformity in state laws and on the right of funding
for abortion, Rogers said.
   The resolution could lead the bar association to join pro-choice
advocates in arguments over future abortion cases before the U.S.
Supreme Court, Rogers said.
   ``It means that the resolution is now the official policy of the
association,'' said Debbie Weixl, an ABA spokeswoman.
   Resolution proponents were reacting in part to a 1989 Supreme
Court decision, which affirmed efforts in Missouri to curtail
abortion rights, Rogers said.
   The so-called Webster decision ``has just invited a tremendous
amount of activity in state legislation that will have to be
litigated,'' said Faye Wattleton, president of the Planned
Parenhood Federation of America, who backed the resolution.
   The ABA policy statement ``recognizes the fundamental rights of
privacy and equality guaranteed by the United States Constitution
and opposes legislation or other governmental action that
interferes with the confidential relationship between a pregnant
woman and a physician or with the decision to terminate the
pregnancy.''
   Among those opposing the resolution was ABA President L. Stanley
Chauvin Jr. of Louisville, Ky., who said the resolution was beyond
the ABA's mission. Others argued the resolution should be tabled
because the issue was so divisive it would discourage membership.
   The House of Delegates is the ABA's only legislative body
authorized to make policy.

<HEAD>Federal Officials Say Drug Use Figures Still Too High</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Adds one graf with detail on survey method</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new survey shows fewer high school students
and young adults are using illicit drugs, but federal health and
drug officials say the numbers are still too high.
   ``One out of two (high school) students still uses an illegal
drug before he graduates; one out of 10 uses cocaine,'' said
national drug policy director William Bennett. ``Those numbers are
unacceptably high.''
   The survey released Monday is an annual effort by the University
of Michigan and funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse to
track the use of drugs by high school seniors, college students and
other young adults.
   It shows a decrease in overall illegal drug use over the past
decade and in 1989 by all three groups.
   High school seniors and college students today are half as
likely to try an illegal drug as they were in 1980, according to
the survey.
   Despite the good news, said Health and Human Services Secretary
Louis Sullivan, ``We must not allow our efforts to slacken.''
   The decline in alcohol use has been more modest and cigarette
smoking is about as widespread today among seniors as it was a
decade ago. Nearly 19 percent of seniors are daily smokers and 60
percent have used alcohol within the past 30 days.
   Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., chairman of the House Select
Committee on Narcotics Abuse and Control, said the survey
``understates the drug problem because it omits dropouts who are an
enormous core of the drug crisis.'' He said the survey is of
``extremely limited value.''
   Survey officials acknowledge the limitation, but said the data
suggest drug use among dropouts may also be declining. They said
the survey shows the drop in drug use among high school seniors who
are truant and have bad grades is as great as the drop among
seniors who are not truant and have good grades.
   Among specific drugs:
   _Marijuana: Casual use _ within the last 30 days _ among seniors
is down from a peak of 37 percent in 1979 to 17 percent in 1989,
and for college students, it has dropped from 34 percent in 1980 to
16 percent last year.
   _Cocaine: 2.8 percent of seniors are casual cocaine users, down
from a peak of 6.7 percent in 1985, and among college students the
drop is larger. But for the smokable form of the drug known as
crack, casual and daily use has stayed about the same for seniors
since 1987 when it was first included in the survey.
   _Ice: Also known as crystal methamphetamine, ``ice'' was
included for the first time in the survey because of increasing
concerns about the drug. About 1.2 percent of the seniors surveyed
said they had used it at least once in the past year. Use was
highest in the West, where 3 percent of the seniors had used it.
   _Ecstasy: The drug MDNA, known as ``ecstasy,'' also was included
for the first time, and was tried by 3.8 percent of the college
students surveyed and 3.3 percent of the high school graduates not
in college.
   _Steroids: About 3 percent of high school senior said they had
used anabolic steroids, which are a controlled substance used to
build muscles.
   The survey of high school seniors, which began in 1975, polled
about 17,000 students in 135 public and private high schools
nationwide. The other survey is a follow-up study of previously
participating graduating classes. In this survey, about 1,200
college students and about 6,600 high school graduates who are one
to 10 years past high school were resurveyed by mail.

   Government officials in East and
West Germany today praised the Allies for agreeing to help settle
security issues raised by the prospect of reunfication.
   East German Premier Hans Modrow welcomed the agreement to hold
talks among the two Germanys, Britain, France, the Soviet Union and
the United States on security and political issues, said spokesman
Rolf Bachmann.
   Modrow considered the six-power approach to German unity to be
the best way to ensure that the interests of the World War II
victors are protected, as well as those of the German states,
Bachmann said.
   ``We see this as an exceptionally important development and a
great success for the West German foreign minister, an important
step toward German unity,'' said Hanns Schumacher, a West German
Foreign Ministry spokesman.
   Under the agreement reached in Ottawa on Tuesday , officials of
East Germany and West Germany will meet after the March 18 East
German elections to discuss the legal, political and economic
issues of reunification. Outside powers may not interfere with
decisions of the two Germanys in those talks.
   Afterward, foreign ministers of the two Germanys and the United
States, Britain, France and the Soviet Union will meet to discuss
other issues involved in reunfication, especially regarding
security and armed forces.
   Modrow today wrapped up a two-day summit with West German
leaders in Bonn.
   Also Tuesday, the two Germanys agreed to start talks on making
the West German mark the official currency of East Germany, a move
that could lay the economic foundation for unification.
   The announcement late Tuesday from Ottawa that the foreign
ministers of the six countries would soon begin talks on reunifying
Germany came too late for most West German newspapers.
   But the agreement was swiftly reported by some broadcast media.
   West Germany's ARD television went live to its correspondent in
Ottawa late Tuesday, with the reporter saying most issues seemed
clear but that the problem of the NATO membership of West Germany
had been temporarily delayed.
   The brief statement from Ottawa did not mention a united
Germany's military allegiance. The United States wants the state to
remain in NATO, while the Soviets have pressed for a neutral united
Germany.
   ``Astoundingly fruitful,'' East Germany's official news agency
ADN said in describing the two-day ``Open Skies'' conference in
Ottawa. ``The dramatic progress of events in the heart of Europe
pushes toward negotiations.''
   ADN stressed the discussions about unification ``will also
include the questions of security of neighboring states.''

   Gen. Michel Aoun's gunners and Samir
Geagea's Lebanese Forces today fought with howitzers and mortars in
east Beirut and in Kesrouan province north of the capital. Police
said two people were killed.
   The latest deaths raised the toll from the 16-day,
intra-Christian showdown to 515. By police count, 1,724 people have
been wounded since the confrontation for mastery of the
310-square-mile Christian enclave broke out Jan. 30.
   A reliable source today said Aoun has threatened to overrun the
Christian enclave north of Beirut to crush the rival militia if it
refuses to disband.
   The source, who demanded anonymity, said Aoun on Tuesday gave
mediators ``a clear message to Geagea that he would overrun
Kesrouan and break the Lebanese Forces'' if the militia chieftain
continued to refuse to disband peacefully.
   The source, who is close to the mediators, said despite Aoun's
threat ``Geagea refrained from giving the mediators a clear
answer.''
   The three-man mediation committee has been holding separate
meetings with Aoun and Geagea in an effort to work out a settlement
to their confrontation, the worst conflict among the Christians in
the nearly 15-year-old civil war.
   Also today, the government of President Elias Hrawi, along with
three foreign humanitarian organizations, dispatched 100 tons of
food in nine trucks to 10,000 families in east Beirut across the
city's dividing Green Line.
   Archbishop Khalil Abi Nader, the Maronite Catholic spiritual
leader for Beirut, sponsored unloading the relief aid at a church
in the district of Ashrafiyeh. ``This is aid from man to fellow
man. We thank those who helped us,'' Abi Nader told reporters.
   Aoun told reporters Tuesday that Geagea's 6,000-strong militia
is ``an unacceptable tumor in our body'' and stressed that no armed
organization besides his 19,000 army would be allowed to dominate
the Christian enclave.
   ``They are welcome if they want a political responsibility,''
Aoun said.
   The source said Aoun held the news conference after his threat
was relayed to Geagea and after the 54-year-old general called up
reservists in apparent preparation for an offensive in Kesrouan.
   The Lebanese Forces command, in a communique, reported
``suspicious troop movements'' in the Aoun-held territory along the
eastern and southern flanks of Kesrouan, which is the militia's
main power base.
   The independent newspaper An-Nahar quoted unidentified sources
close to Aoun as saying the ``countdown for the decisive battle has
started.''
   A police spokesman said ``hundreds of exhausted civilians''
reached the Lebanese Forces-controlled central and western sectors
of Kesrouan on Tuesday and today after walking across
snow-blanketed valleys and rough terrain.
   The spokesman said civilians in east Beirut continued to stock
supplies of food, drinking water and medicines in underground
shelters, where they have been living since the confrontation broke
out.
   Hrawi has appealed to the superpowers, France and the Vatican to
support possible intervention by his Syrian-backed troops to halt
the fighting.
   Aoun does not recognize Hrawi's Christian-Moslem government,
which is backed by Syria. He also has vowed to drive the Syrians,
who support the Moslem militias of west Beirut, from Lebanon.

   The African National Congress is
willing to compromise with the government on details of a
post-apartheid political system as long as the principle of black
rights is ensured, Nelson Mandela said today.
   The 71-year-old black leader, giving his first interviews since
his release Sunday after 27 years in prison, was asked if the ANC
was willing to ease its demand for a one-person, one-vote system
that would lead to black majority rule.
   ``Compromises must be made in respect to every issue, as long as
that compromise is in the interest not only of one population group
but the country as whole,'' Mandela told reporters outside his
home. ``That is the nature of compromises.''
   The ANC repeatedly has rejected any system falling short of
one-person, one-vote. Mandela has stressed since his release that
his movement would like to address white fears of black domination,
although he opposes the government's concept of ``group rights''
which would give special legal protection to whites and other
minorities.
   ``We are aware of the fears of the whites in the country, of
being dominated by blacks and we are addressing that very seriously
and very earnestly,'' he said. ``I am convinced that in discussions
between the ANC and the government, we will be able to find a
solution which will be accepted by everybody.''
   Mandela, who plans to consult soon with exiled ANC leaders in
Zambia, did not elaborate on what compromises might be reached.
   ``I think it be most presumptuous of me to speak for the ANC,''
he said. ``It is the ANC who would decide what compromises it
should make... We are ready for honorable compromises without
surrendering our principles.''
   In Lusaka, Zambia today, the ANC began a two-day meeting of its
top policy-making body that was expected to focus on Mandela's
future role.
   No precise agenda for the talks was released, and ANC officials
gave no indication whether they expected Mandela to travel from
South Africa to attend.
   In the months preceding his release, Mandela met frequently with
senior government officials, including President F.W. de Klerk, to
discuss prospects for negotiations between them and the ANC.
   In these discussions, Mandela said today, ``My optimism has been
strengthened.''
   De Klerk, who has transformed South African politics by freeing
Mandela and lifting a 30-ban on the ANC, seeks to negotiate a new
constitution that would extend political rights to the black
majority but preserve some sort of political guarantees for whites.
   Police, meanwhile, reported that a new outbreak of fighting
between rival black factions left at least 13 people dead.
   Police squads using tear gas, rubber bullets and shotguns were
trying to quell the unrest at Kwanobuhle near Uitenhage, where nine
people were killed.
   Four more killings were reported in Natal Province, where black
supporters and opponents of the ANC have been feuding for three
years. The government said army troops would be deployed to halt
black sectional fighting.
   Mandela has condemned black-against-black violence, saying it
weakens the fight against apartheid, the system of institionalized
racism that denies the country's blacks a say in national affairs
and forces them to live in segregated districts.
   Mandela and his family stayed overnight at the modest four-room
house in Soweto that the black leader has rented for decades. The
area was quiet after the wild scenes of jubilation when he returned
to Soweto following his release from prison on Sunday.
   He briefly left today to visit Elias Motsoaledi, an old comrade
who was put on trial with Mandela in 1964 on sabotage charges and
is now quite ill. As Mandela left his friend's house, he talked to
some young children, urging them to go school to gain education and
help fight apartheid.
   More than 120,000 people crammed shoulder-to-shoulder into the
country's largest stadium Tuesday to greet the man revered by most
South African blacks as their leader. Many in the crowd were
getting their first glimpse of him.
   He said the ANC would ``continue the armed struggle as long as
the violence of apartheid continues.''
   In Cape Town, the government issued its first formal response to
Mandela's statements since his release.
   Constitutional Development Minister Gerrit Viljoen said the
government agreed with Mandela that apartheid must be eliminated
and voting rights extended to blacks. But he criticized Mandela's
support for continued guerrilla violence and economic sanctions.
   ``The government is not prepared to accede to the handing over
of power,'' Viljoen said. ``If that is the goal of the armed
struggle, then there is no meaningful way ahead.''

   Police fired tear gas today to quell clashes
among Vietnamese refugees at a detention center where two days of
fighting have left nearly 70 people injured, officials reported.
   At least 38 refugees and 30 corrections staff members have been
hurt in the feuding, said government spokeswoman Fanny Kong said.
Some have required hospitalization.
   The violence broke out today when about 1,000 refugees were
moved to another section of the Whitehead Detention Center, but
refugees living in that area protested, threw stones at the
newcomers and tried to start fires, Ms. Kong said.
   She said rival groups of Vietnamese from Haiphong and Quong Ninh
were involved in the fighting.
   The night before, about 300 Vietnamese rioted in the camp, and
150 police were called to the camp to restore order
   Police had searched the camp throughout the night and uncovered
296 homemade weapons, some made from bars of window and bed frames,
said Ish Bhagat, a government official responsible for running the
detention centers.
   ``This is an ongoing problem,'' he told government-funded radio.
``As soon as we seize some (weapons), they make others.''
   Factional violence has frequently broken out in the crowded and
squalid Vietnamese camps in this British colony. Five people died
last year in riots.
   The Vietnamese migrants are considered illegal immigrants unless
they can prove they fled persecution.
   Those who are denied refugee status and have their appeals
rejected can volunteer to go home or face forced repatriation. In
December, 51 Vietnamese were returned to Vietnam against their will.

<TEXT>
   The African National Congress today began
a two-day meeting of its top policy-making body that was expected
to focus on the future role in the organization of Nelson Mandela.
   No precise agenda for the closed talks was released, and ANC
officials gave no indication whether they expect Mandela to travel
from South Africa to attend.
   The ANC international affairs spokesman, Thabo Mbeki, said the
35-member National Executive Committee will discuss a broad range
of issues stemming from the reforms announced by President F.W de
Klerk on Feb. 2.
   De Klerk lifted a 30-ban on the ANC and legalized or lifted
restrictions on dozens of other opposition groups. He seeks to
negotiate a new constitution that would extend political rights to
the black majority but preserve some sort of political guarantees
for whites.
   Mbeki told reporters that the 35-member executive was empowered
to make firm decisions without the presence of Mandela, an ANC
leader who was released Sunday after 27 years in prison.
   The ANC has maintained its external headquarters in Zambia for
more than two decades.
   Mbeki said there were no differences within the ANC over whether
the group should continue its guerrilla campaign in light of the
reforms in South Africa's political life.
   Senior committee member Joe Slovo said Mandela's leading role in
the ANC was undisputed but did not indicate what his future
position might be.
   ``He is one of the prime leaders of the organization. This was
his position inside prison and is even more so outside,'' Slovo
added.
   The meeting in Lusaka is expected to endorse the ANC stand on
possible negotiations with the Pretoria government.
   The group says de Klerk has not created a climate for talks
because he has not shown a commitment to dismantle apartheid.
   The ANC has demanded the lifting of all provisions of the state
of emergency and the release of all political prisoners as
conditions for direct talks.

<HEAD>Princeton Eating Club Votes to Admit Women, 2nd Vote in 1991</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRINCETON, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of the two remaining all-male eating
clubs at Princeton University has voted to admit women, but two
more rounds of voting must be conducted next year before female
students can join.
   The Ivy Club, formed in 1879, voted 51-23 Tuesday to allow
women, said Robert Garrett, the club's undergraduate president.
   Club policy states that two consecutive votes must be held to
alter rules. Garrett said the second vote will be next year,
followed by a vote by the graduate board, made up of Princeton
alumni.
   The Ivy Club and the Tiger Inn are the only two of the school's
13 private eating establishments that do not admit women. Most
juniors and seniors take their meals at the clubs, which are housed
in private homes near the campus.
   Their exclusion of women was challenged in state Supreme Court
last week by Princeton graduate Sally Frank, now a faculty member
at New York Law School.
   Ms. Frank, backed by the state attorney general's office and
Princeton University, argued that the clubs have a ``symbiotic
relationship'' with the university that removes them from
protection under the laws governing private organizations. She said
they are subject to the state's anti-discrimination laws.
   Attorneys for the two clubs argued that they are similar to
fraternities and sororities and have the right to choose their own
members.
   Ms. Frank said her case and recent picketing by students and
faculty put pressure on the Ivy Club.
   Garrett said members voted as they did ``for different reasons''
and that the club as a whole believes strongly it has a
constitutionally protected right of association that lets it
determine its own membership.

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Catholic leadership organizations
jointly denounced U.S. policies in Central America and defended the
right of clerics to speak out on moral issues.
   ``We ... feel compelled by recent months' bloodshed and violence
in Central America to speak out against U.S. interventionist
policies there,'' said Brother Sean Sammon, president of the
Conference of Major Superiors of Men.
   The joint announcement Tuesday by the men's conference and the
Leadership Conference of Women Religious reiterated many of the
complaints the Catholic groups have aired in the past over what
they called American ``interventionist'' policies in Central
America.
   ``We always have a right and a responsibility to speak out on
critical religious and moral issues,'' said Sammon, who made his
remarks in a room hung with grisly photographs of slain men, women
and children.
   ``We join with Latin American governments in condemning the U.S.
invasion of Panama as a demonstration of naked interventionism ...
we lament the deep wound inflicted ... on a free and sovereign
nation,'' said Sammon.
   The two groups represent 123,000 brothers and sisters of
Catholic religious orders.
   ``Our country has funded the debilitating war in El Salvador for
more than 10 years, and during that decade 70,000 Salvadorans have
lost their lives,'' Sammon said.
   Sister Helen Marie Burns, president of the women leaders, said,
``We see those lives as simply representatives of the thousands of
lives that are being lost and mutilated in the Central American
countries.''
   ``The murders which frame the decade for us, of the four
churchwomen in 1980 and the six Jesuits and two women in 1989,
point clearly to the persecution of the church there and the
reality of violence and repressions'' against clergy, Sammon said.
   He said plans were being made to commemorate the 10th
anniversary of the March 1980 assassination of Salvadoran
Archbishop Oscar Romero.

<TEXT>
   The bankruptcy filing by the parent of Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc. could take years to sort out, but already
there is little left of the firm whose junk-bond machine fueled the
fast-buck, megamerger 1980s.
   With most securities firms refusing to trade with Drexel and
banks unwilling to lend money to stem its cash crisis, the one-time
powerhouse began liquidating its huge bond portfolio even before
its board authorized the bankruptcy filing.
   Employees, meanwhile, scrambled to look for jobs in an industry
that has been shrinking steadily since the October 1987 stock
market crash.
   Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc., parent of the securities
company, filed for Chapter 11 protection from creditors late
Tuesday. Only four years earlier, riding the crest of a takeover
boom, Drexel had posted record pretax profits of nearly $1 billion.
   ``DBL Group currently faces a liquidity crisis and does not have
the financial resources to weather this storm without court
protection,'' Drexel chief executive Frederick H. Joseph said in
bankruptcy court papers obtained today.
   Joseph blamed the firm's demise largely on ``a downturn in the
financial markets.'' He said a slump in the market for commercial
paper _ short-term IOUs issued to raise cash _ contracted in 1989
and Drexel was forced to repay $575 million without selling new
paper to replenish the supply.
   ``The burden of meeting these obligations effectively wiped out
DBL Group's liquidity, rendering it incapable of meeting other
obligations as they matured,'' Joseph said in the papers.
   The filing showed how quickly confidence can sour on Wall
Street, analysts said, and marked the beginning of the end for a
firm humbled by criminal entanglements and a plunge in demand for
high-yield but risky bonds, a market Drexel created.
   Guards inspected boxes of personal belongings as employees left
the downtown headquarters Tuesday night. Resumes and phone calls
from Drexel workers flooded other Wall Street firms.
   While no formal layoffs were announced, employees considered
their departure a foregone conclusion. Drexel brokers roamed the
floor of the New York Stock Exchange openly soliciting jobs.
Employees were told they would get paid Thursday but there were no
guarantees after that.
   ``People were told the firm at some point is going to wind
down,'' a Drexel executive said on condition of anonymity. ``You
don't need to draw a picture.''
   In its petition for bankruptcy court reorganization, the firm
listed liabilities exceeding $3 billion and assets exceeding $3.6
billion.
   The largest creditor listed is Taiyo Mutual Life of Tokyo, owed
$69.7 million. It is followed by Home Capital Services Inc., New
York, $42.7 million; Banque Indosuez Paris, $30.5 million; Sumitomo
Life Insurance Company, Tokyo, and the state of California's
retirement system, $25 million. Fourteen of the top 20 creditors
are foreign-owned companies.
   The filing affects only the parent company, not the securities
subsidiary. Broker-dealers are ineligible for Chapter 11
reorganization under federal bankruptcy law.
   Nevertheless, with confidence shattered, analysts expect Drexel
will liquidate its remaining broker-dealer holdings.
   Drexel immediately began dismantling its securities operations
Tuesday, starting to liquidate billions of dollars worth of
goverment bonds and mortgage-backed securities, tens of millions in
junk bonds and other financial instruments.
   Drexel also negotiated the transfer of customer brokerage
accounts to Smith Barney, Harris Upham &amp; Co.; withdrew as a market
maker in 228 over-the-counter stocks; and put entire business units
up for sale.
   The parent company said it defaulted Tuesday on about $100
million in loans and a lack of cash threatened other defaults.
Drexel was turned down for bank financing that it sought to avert
the filing.
   The downfall of Drexel, which was founded in 1838 in
Philadelphia by a portrait painter named Francis Drexel, has been
as startling as its recent recent rise, mirroring the career of
junk-bond genius Michael Milken.
   Milken is credited with single-handedly creating and controlling
the market for low-rated debt securities and using them to finance
billions of dollars in hostile takeovers.
   The high-flying firm made gargantuan profits in its heyday _
almost $1 billion before taxes in 1986 _ and paid its employees
accordingly. Milken personally made more than $1 billion from
1983-87.
   Drexel's attitude was embodied by brash letters telling clients
it was ``highly confident'' it could raise hundreds of millions of
dollars during corporate takeover battles, and by its lavish annual
junk-bond conference known as the ``Predators' Ball.''
   But the luster began fading in 1986 when Drexel investment
banker Dennis Levine was arrested on insider-trading charges. The
investigation later snared arbitrager Ivan F. Boesky, Drexel, other
employees and an investment firm it did business with,
Princeton-Newport Partners.
   Drexel in late 1988 agreed to plead guilty to six felonies and
pay $650 million in fines and penalties. Milken was indicted last
year on 98 counts of fraud and racketeering and has since left the
firm.
   Some Wall Street professionals _ not all Drexel backers _
maintain the firm wrote its own epitaph when it settled with the
government to forestall a possible racketeering indictment and
agreed to let go of Milken, which left the $200 billion junk-bond
market without a leader.
   The junk market collapsed last fall as several big companies
staggered under their debt burden.
   The value of Drexel's huge debt portfolio fell with the market.
In the end, some observers see Drexel's junk bonds as the emperor's
new clothes of big business in the 1980s.
   ``Milken found a void and he filled it,'' said Muriel Siebert, a
former banking regulator who runs a small New York brokerage.
``Unfortunately, it got out of hand. They were making too much
money. We're seeing the unraveling of the extreme excesses of
money.''

   Activist Al Sharpton spent a few hours in jail
for his role in a 1987 protest that stalled city subways but was
released early today pending an appeal of his conviction.
   Brooklyn Criminal Judge Albert Koch on Tuesday found Sharpton
and two other black activists guilty of obstruction of governmental
administration, criminal trespass and disorderly conduct. He
ordered them jailed immediately for 45 days. The three had faced up
to six months in jail.
   ``Crack dealers will walk out of this courthouse today; muggers
and robbers will walk out of this building today, and we will go to
jail,'' Sharpton told the judge after the sentencing. ``Just give
me a glass of water each day.''
   Later Tuesday Sharpton's lawyer, Alton Maddox, obtained a stay
of his client's sentence from the Appellate Division pending
appeal, said Patrick Clark, spokesman for the Brooklyn district
attorney's office.
   Sharpton, the Rev. Timothy Mitchell and Charles Barron were held
in protective custody in the hospital at the Rikers Island jail
until their release early today, said Ruby Ryles, a spokeswoman for
the city Correction Department.
   The charges stem from the Dec. 21, 1987, ``Day of Outrage''
protest against racism in the city.
   Sharpton and more than 70 others were arrested when they
disrupted subway service in Brooklyn during the evening rush hour
by jumping on tracks, pulling emergency cords and holding subway
doors open. Charges were dropped against most participants.
   Sharpton faces similar charges for a 1988 protest when
demonstrators blocked traffic on the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway.

   The condition of a prisoner on an 11-month
hunger strike has stabilized as doctors for the second straight day
force-fed him a liquid protein diet, one of inmate's attorneys said.
   Doctors at Duane Waters Hospital next to State Prison of
Southern Michigan in Jackson had feared inmate Rene Acuna's heart
might suddenly fail unless he received nourishment other than his
diet of water and coffee laced with sugar.
   Paul Denenfeld, legal director for the Michigan chapter of the
American Civil Liberties Union, said Acuna, 37, of Detroit, put up
no resistance Tuesday to the second day of feeding through a nasal
tube.
   ``The doctor called me late yesterday afternoon and indicated it
would still be a couple of weeks before we could anticipate an
upswing in his health,'' said Denefeld, who expressed optimism for
Acuna's recovery.
   The Cuban immigrant went on the strike because he said God wants
him to prove he is innocent of his conviction on drug charges.
   The Michigan Court of Appeals overturned for lack of evidence
Acuna's convictions on conspiring to traffic more than two pounds
of cocaine in August 1988. The convictions carried sentences of
mandatory life in prison without parole.
   Prosecutors said he was a lookout for drug dealers, but Acuna
has insisted the all-white jury convicted him solely because he
happened to be in a white neighborhood when other Hispanics sold
drugs to undercover agents.
   Acuna, a self-employed handyman and mechanic, is unable to post
the $100,000 appeal bond while the prosecution asks the Michigan
Supreme Court to overturn the dismissal of the convictions.
   A campaign has raised $150 toward the $10,000 cash needed to
obtain the bond, said Carolyn Peyser, a Birmingham nurse collecting
the funds.
   Acuna has said he won't eat until he is able to return to Anna
Sossa, his longtime companion, and his two daughters. His condition
worsened last week when he began refusing liquids to protest the
setting of the appeal bond.
   His weight has dropped from 180 pounds to just over 100 pounds,
Denenfeld said.

   Heimann, who lived in Riverside, died Sunday of what was
described only as natural causes at Greenwich Hospital.
   He served as chairman and chief executive of American Brands
from 1977 until his retirement in 1980. He had been chairman since
1973.
   As head of American Brands, Heimann led the company in acquiring
Gallagher Ltd., now the largest tobacco company in Britain. The
company also diversified into such fields as foods, alcoholic
beverages and fruit juices.
   Earlier in his career, Heimann worked in securities and
publishing, serving as managing editor and executive editor of
Forbes magazine from 1949 to 1953. He also was an editor at
Nation's Heritage.
   Heimann joined American Brands in 1954 when it was the American
Tobacco Co. He was assistant to the president from 1961 to 1964 and
produced studies that tried to show a correlation between the
stress of urban living and lung cancer.
   He was named vice president for marketing and public relations
in 1964, when American Tobacco stopped sponsoring sports events on
radio and television ``to avoid any appearance of appealing to
young people,'' he said at the time.
   Heimann is survived by a daughter, a son and a sister.
   A private funeral was held Tuesday.

   The Nebraska Legislature's Education
Committee has killed a bill that would have punished state college
and university students for drug convictions.
   The bill called for students convicted of first-offense drug
violations to take a rehabilitation course. A subsequent offense
would have brought suspension from school and a cut-off of
financial aid.
   The committee voted 5-1 to kill the bill Tuesday on a motion
from state Sen. David Bernard-Stevens.
   ``I agree that we need to address the problem,''
Bernard-Stevens. ``We need to do more and more to stop abuse in its
beginning. One of the keys is an education.''
   The suspension for second offense wouldn't mean they can't
attend another school, but they would have to use their own money,
said the sponsor, state Sen. Elroy Hefner. Bernard-Stevens took
issue with that, noting that the bill would hit the poor hardest.

<HEAD>Judge Rules State Can Tax Airline for Drinks Served in Wisconsin
Airspace</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARTHUR L. SRB</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The state may collect its 5 percent sales
tax from an airline for drinks sold while its jets flew over
Wisconsin, a judge has ruled.
   Dane County Circuit Judge James Boll ordered Tuesday that
Republic Airlines Inc. pay Wisconsin $90,622 in overdue sales tax
for drinks consumed on its flights over the state between 1981-84.
   Boll rejected Republic's argument that a law authorizing a sales
tax on drinks consumed ``in this state'' did not mean ``over this
state.''
   The judge ruled the state had the right to fairly impose its
sale tax on flights overhead for any airline that had some definite
link to the state _ such as offices based in Wisconsin or
incorporation within the state.
   Republic, with its numerous facilities in Wisconsin, received
substantial benefits from the state, said State Revenue Secretary
Mark Bugher. He declined to say whether other airlines might be
similarly taxed.
   ``Generally, we would not be looking to reach out and touch
every airline that touches the state's atmosphere,'' Bugher said.
``If Japan Airlines, for instance, happens to fly over the northern
reaches of Wisconsin, it wouldn't be our policy to tax.''
   Republic Airlines, which was purchased in the mid-1980s by
Northwest Airlines Inc., contended that applying the state sales
tax to flights violated the due process clause of the U.S.
Constitution.
   Republic was engaged in interstate transportation, with offices
in Minneapolis, Minn., when the state sought to collect the
$90,622. The airline appealed an order of the Wisconsin Tax Appeals
Commission that it owed the tax, leading to the court case.
   Before it was bought out, Republic maintained offices in
Wisconsin, had equipment and personnel located at airports in the
state and flew regularly scheduled flights into and out of
Wisconsin cities.
   Republic said it did not keep records of the location of its
aircraft when it sold drinks, particularly whether the aircraft was
in Wisconsin's airspace or above another state.
   Republic attorney Frederic Brouner said he did not know whether
Northwest Airlines would appeal.
   Brouner said Wisconsin's attempt to collect on the tax after the
sale was ``particularly onerous'' because it was impossible for the
vendor to tax the consumer at the point of sale.

   Lawmakers in the state House rejected two
anti-abortion measures before passing a bill allowing abortions
until the 25th week of pregnancy, a defeat for anti-abortion
advocates.
   The 212-148 vote Tuesday on the measure allowing
second-trimester abortions fell short of the two-thirds that would
be needed to override Gov. Judd Gregg's promised veto.
   The measure must pass the Senate before it reaches Gregg,
something it is not likely to do before the Legislature begins a
two-week break Friday.
   By a much wider margin, the House rejected a bill that would
declare that life begins at conception and a bill that would bar
the use of public money, employees or facilities to assist or
perform abortions.
   During Tuesday's passionate debate on the abortion-regulating
bill, anti-abortion House members pleaded with their colleagues to
think of the unborn.
   ``We are considering a law that would permit the execution of
the unborn at any time ... for any reason,'' said Rep. Kathleen
Hoelzel.
   Rep. Matthew Sochalski said the measure's restrictions could be
abused. He said the measure's specification that the mother's life
or health could be considered when allowing abortions after the
25th week could let women claim their mental health is endangered
by an otherwise routine pregnancy.
   But supporters of the measure, which follows guidelines for
legalizing abortion set down in the Supreme Court's 1973 Roe vs.
Wade decision, said their peers should remember that abortion is a
step not taken lightly.
   ``Part of living in a free society is allowing people to make
decisions in their private lives that we as individuals do not
agree with,'' said Rep. Thomas Gage, whose Judiciary Committee
recommended the bill be passed.

<TEXT>
   President Bush's proposed capital-gains tax
cut would worsen the federal budget deficit by $11.4 billion over
the next five years and continue to lose revenues far into the
future, congressional economists said today.
   The estimate by the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation
disagrees markedly with one by the Treasury Department, which says
the tax cut would actually boost revenues by $12.5 billion over
five years.
   The two estimates agree that the capital-gains reduction would
raise tax collections this year and next. The congressional
estimate puts the 1990-91 gain at $3.9 billion; the administration
forecast is for a $5.4 billion increase.
   Capital gains are profits from the sale of stock and other
investments. The realization, or cashing in, of such profits grows
with the overall economy, a report by the congressional tax staff
said.
   ``Consequently, if the economy continues to grow in years beyond
1995, we would predict the revenue losses in those years would
exceed the revenue loss for 1995, and would grow in magnitude each
year thereafter,'' the report said.
   The disagreement over effects of a capital-gains tax cut is a
long-running one. In essence, the Treasury traditionally has
contended that a reduction would so spur investment that economic
growth would increase tax collections _ even if the rate of tax
were lowered.
   Congressional experts rejected those arguments.
   The staff report estimated that 66.1 percent of the benefits of
a capital-gains reduction would go to those with total incomes of
$200,000 and more. Those making $100,000 and more would reap 83.1
percent of the tax reduction, it said.
   People with incomes under $20,000 would receive 0.4 percent of
the benefit. The estimated 638,000 people at that income level who
would receive any of the benefit would get tax cuts averaging $88,
the report said.
   The tax cut would benefit 681,000 people making more than
$200,000 a year; their tax cut would average $15,454.
   Under current law, capital gains are fully taxed at the same
rates as wages and other income. When fully in effect, Bush's
proposal would tax at those rates only 70 percent of the profits
from the sale of assets owned three years or more. Property owned
for more than a year but less than three would qualify for a lesser
benefit.

   Members of the Supreme Soviet
visiting the Strategic Air Command said they would never be the
first to use nuclear weapons and challenged the United States to
make a similar pledge.
   During the visit Tuesday, which SAC officials believed was the
first by members of the Soviet legislative body, the Soviets also
questioned conclusions of an SAC report showing Soviet military
superiority.
   SAC Commander Gen. John T. Chain Jr. said he was pleased by the
``healthy dialogue,'' but criticized the first-strike pledge.
   ``A pledge is an intriguing thing,'' Chain said. ``But it is
meaningless. It is nice rhetoric, but meaningless.''
   ``Mr. Gorbachev may be the nicest guy in the world, and tomorrow
Stalin the Second might take power in the Soviet Union,'' Chain
said. ``It is my job to assess capabilities, and to prevent an
attack.''
   All the 10 Supreme Soviet members saw of SAC were the outside of
the headquarters building and an auditorium where they were given a
briefing on relative U.S.-Soviet strategic force capability.
   The briefing by Maj. Dave Moore concluded that Soviet military
spending and modernization required the United States to make
efforts to improve its strategic forces.
   ``We were taken aback by the statement made by the major,'' said
Vitaliy M. Shabonov, a member of the Supreme Soviet and deputy
minister of defense. ``It is not a good thing to try to educate us
on this matter.''
   After the Soviets left, Chain defended the information presented
by Moore.
   ``We didn't give them any information that can't be backed up
with pictures,'' Chain said.
   The Soviets were accompanied by U.S. Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis.,
chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, and U.S. Rep. Peter
Hoagland, D-Neb.
   The visiting Soviets are members of the Defense and State
Security Committee of the Supreme Soviet. They came to the base
near Omaha at the invitation of Aspin's committee.
   Shabonov said U.S.-Soviet military discussions should focus on
intentions rather than capabilities alone.
   ``I have learned that our views of world stability are
similar,'' Shabonov said. ``And the world is looking to us to
cooperate.''
   ``It is only natural that a strategy of fear and intimidation
concerns us very much,'' Shabonov said. He concluded that while the
number of Soviet strategic nuclear weapons would go down, they
would continue to be modernized.
   ``You were the first to invent atomic weapons,'' said Vladimir
L. Lapygin, chairman of the Supreme Soviet Committee on Defense and
State Security. ``We simply had to catch up. You started to develop
the Minuteman and ICBMs. I would like to underline that what we are
doing all the time is trying to catch up to you.''
   ``We would like to take a mutual pledge that neither side will
be the first to use nuclear weapons,'' Lapygin said.
   The visit was part of a 12-day tour of U.S. military
installations and scientific facilities that began Feb. 7, SAC
officials said.
   The tour also includes stops at Los Alamos National
Laboratories, Kennedy Space Center, North American Air Defense
Command and Minuteman missile and B-1B facilities at Ellsworth,
S.D., Army Armored Forces, the F-16 fighter plant at Fort Worth,
Texas, and Navy, Marine and Air Force bases on both coasts.

<HEAD>Texaco Announces $1 Million Program to Plant Trees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texaco Inc., one of the nation's oil giants,
announced today a $1 million program to plant trees in three cities
this spring to kick off private sector involvement in President
Bush's ``America the Beautiful'' program.
   James W. Kinnear, Texaco president, said the tree money will be
shared in Denver, Houston and New Orleans, where the company has
extensive operations.
   Kinnear told a news conference at the Agriculture Department
that the plantings will be done by Texaco volunteers and that he
expected around 50,000 trees would be set out in the three cities.
The trees, he said, will be ``big enough to make a difference this
decade.''
   Both Kinnear and Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter expressed
hope that Texaco's example would lead others in the three cities
and elsewhere to chip in with their own efforts.
   Yeutter said existing programs in USDA can accomplish a lot in
rural areas but that a special effort is needed in the cities.
   Rep. Lindy Boggs, D-La., said thousands of trees in New Orleans
have been ravaged by pests and that Texaco's program is desperately
needed.
   The ``America the Beautiful'' project was included in Bush's
budget proposals for fiscal 1991 to help protect, conserve and
enhance the nation's natural resources. It included the planting of
one billion trees per year.
   One argument in favor of more trees is their ability in the
growth process to remove carbon dioxide and certain impurities from
the atmosphere, and release oxygen as a byproduct.

   ``Driving Miss Daisy,'' the
bittersweet story of a contrary Southern lady and her wise old
chauffeur, led Academy Award nominations today with nine, followed
by the Vietnam film ``Born on the Fourth of July'' with eight.
   ``Glory,'' the epic of black soldiers in the Civil War, and ``My
Left Foot,'' the story of an Irish cerebral palsy victim, followed
with five nominations apiece.
   ``Driving Miss Daisy'' earned nominations for best picture, and
for acting by Morgan Freeman, Jessica Tandy and Dan Aykroyd, but
suprisingly not for its director, Bruce Beresford.
   ``Born on the Fourth of July'' scored for best picture, Tom
Cruise's starring performance, and the direction by Oliver Stone,
who also shared a screenwriting nomination with Ron Kovic, the
disabled veteran-activist whose story the film portrays.
   ``Everyone worked very hard on this film, not only making it but
trying to get it made,'' Cruise said in a statement from the
Daytona, Fla., location of his latest movie.
   Kovic, about to board a plane in New York, called his nomination
``Truly one of the happiest and most triumphant moments of my
life.''
   The Academy voters demonstrated selectivity by nominating for
best actor Kenneth Branagh of ``Henry V'' and Robin Williams of
``Dead Poets Society.''
   Both have been little mentioned in pre-nomination predictions.
   Along with Freeman and Cruise, Daniel Day-Lewis of ``My Left
Foot'' also was nominated for best actor.
   ``My Left Foot'' producer Daniel Pearson said Day-Lewis ran out
in the street when he heard the news at his agent Julian Belfrage's
office: ``He's so thrilled, he's just run out of the building. At
the moment, it's madness in here.''
   Isabelle Adjani of ``Camille Claudel'' was a surprise nominee
for best actress. Other nominees: Pauline Collins, ``Shirley
Valentine''; Jessica Lange, ``Music Box''; Michelle Pfeiffer, ``The
Fabulous Baker Boys''; and Miss Tandy.
   Belying the legend that films released late in the year are
favored in the Oscars, the voters nominated ``Field of Dreams,''
released April 21, and ``Dead Poets Society,'' released June 2, for
best picture of 1989.
   Other nominees for best picture: ``Born on the Fourth of July,''
``Driving Miss Daisy'' and ``My Left Foot.''
   Among the curiosities in today's nominations: No major honors
for the year's top box-office money maker, ``Batman,'' which earned
$251.2 million in 1989. There were no nominations at all for the
critically acclaimed ``Drugstore Cowboy.''
   ``My Left Foot'' director Jim Sheridan and ``Henry V'' director
were nominated for their directorial debuts, a feat that has led to
only four Oscars. Branagh, Freeman and Miss Collins were nominated
for roles they created on the stage; 19 Oscars have been won by
actors repeating theater roles.
   Landau and Miss Pfeiffer are the only repeat nominees from last
year.
   Marlon Brando, who won an Oscar for ``On the Waterfront'' and
rejected one for ``The Godfather,'' was nominated for supporting
actor for his brief role as a liberal South African lawyer in ``A
Dry White Season.''
   Others named for supporting actor: Danny Aiello, ``Do the Right
Thing''; Aykroyd, ``Driving Miss Daisy''; Martin Landau, ``Crimes
and Misdemeanors''; Denzel Washington, ``Glory.''
   For supporting actress: Brenda Fricker, ``My Left Foot'';
Anjelica Huston, ``Enemies, A Love Story''; Lena Olin, ``Enemies, A
Love Story''; Julia Roberts, `` Steel Magnolias''; Diane Wiest,
``Parenthood.''
   For best direction: Along with Branagh, Sheridan and Stone;
Woody Allen, ``Crimes and Misdemeanors''; Peter Weir, ``Dead Poets
Society''; and Jim Sheridan, ``My Left Foot.''
   Best foreign language film: ``Camille Claudel,'' France;
``Cinema Paradiso,'' Italy; ``Jesus of Montreal,'' Canada;
``Santiago, the Story of His New Life,'' Puerto Rico; ``Waltzing
Regitze,'' Denmark.
   Original screenplay: Allen, ``Crimes and Misdemeanors''; Tom
Schulman, ``Dead Poets Society''; Spike Lee, ``Do the Right
Thing''; Steven Soderbergh, ``sex, lies and videotape''; Nora
Ephron, ``When Harry Met Sally...''
   Screenplay adaptation (from another medium): Stone and Kovic,
``Born on the Fourth of July''; Alfred Uhry, ``Driving Miss
Daisy''; Roger L. Simon and Paul Mazursky, ``Enemies, A Love
Story''; Phil Alden Robinson, ``Field of Dreams''; Jim Sheridan and
Shane Connaughton, ``My Left Foot.''
   Filmmaker Michael Moore had as much trouble meeting Oscar as he
did catching General Motors president Roger Smith in his
documentary ``Roger and Me.'' The film failed to win a nomination
in the documentary feature category.
   Recent weeks have brought criticism of Moore's film for its
faulty juxtaposition of time elements and its entertainment values
at the expense of accuracy.
   The nominees for original song: ``After All'' from ``Chances
Are''; ``The Girl Who Used to be Me'' from ``Shirley Valentine'';
``I Love to See You Smile'' from ``Parenthood''; ``Kiss the Girl''
from ``The Little Mermaid''; ``Under the Sea'' from ``The Little
Mermaid.''

   In awards already handed out, the New York Film Critics voted
``My Left Foot'' as the best film of 1989. ``Enemies, A Love
Story'' won for best director, and ``Drugstore Cowboy'' was awarded
the best screenplay prize by the New York reviewers.
   Film critics in Los Angeles awarded their best film and best
director trophies to ``Do the Right Thing,'' with best screenplay
to ``Drugstore Cowboy.''
   ``Roger &amp; Me'' was named best documentary by the Los Angeles and
New York critics' organizations.
   The National Society of Film Critics chose ``Drugstore Cowboy''
as the best film of the past year and the best directed.
   The Oscar nominations represent judgment by filmmakers' peers.
Each of the Academy's branches votes for its own achievements _
actors nominate actors, directors nominate directors, etc. _ and
all members vote for best picture. Categories such a
foreign-language film, documentaries and shorts are nominated by
committees.
   Screenings of all nominees start Friday at the Academy's Samuel
Goldwyn Theater, and the polls close March 10. The awards ceremony
will be held March 26 and broadcast nationally on ABC-TV.
   After two traffic-plagued years at the Shrine Auditorium, the
awards are returning to the Los Angeles Music Center, which
presents a big problem for the Academy. The Shrine accommodated
5,800 while the Music Center holds only 2,850. ``Tickets are at a
great premium,'' said Academy spokesman Bob Werden. ``A lot of
feelings are going to be hurt.''
   The 62nd-annual show's producer, Gilbert Cates, has promised to
avoid last year's plodding pace and tasteless production numbers,
one of which included Rob Lowe and a ``Snow White'' lookalike.
   The telecast will return to the one-man emcee format, with
quick-witted Billy Crystal doing the honors.

   An Indian Airlines jet with 146 people
aboard crashed and burst into flames while attempting to land at a
southern Indian airport today and 91 people were killed,
authorities said.
   The Airbus 320 crashed at 1 p.m. while on final approach to the
runway at Bangalore airport, airline and airport officials said.
   ``The crash occurred before the plane touched the runway, and it
caught fire as soon as it crashed,'' said P.S. Shetty, airport
manager in Bombay, where the hourlong flight had originated.
   Airline officials said the plane, which was an hour behind
schedule, carried 139 passengers and a crew of seven.
   One airline official said 17 foreigners were believed to be on
the flight to Bangalore, one of India's richest cities and the
center of the country's high-tech and research centers. They
foreigners included a Frenchman, two Canadians, two Americans,
three Japanese and a Hong Kong resident, all who survived, said the
spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   A spokesman for the airline in New Delhi reported earlier that
at least 135 people were killed. But airport officials in Bombay
and doctors at hospitals where the victims were taken said 55
people survived the crash and were being treated for broken bones
and burns.
   ``They're alive. That's all I can say,'' said one doctor who
declined to give his name.
   News reports said the plane apparently undershot the runway by
about 50 yards. The Press Trust of India said the plane struck a
fence or an embankment as it was descending to the runway.
   Local villagers rushed out of their huts and across the field
littered with baggage and debris toward the flaming wreckage. Local
police were called to try to keep them away.
   Airline officials did not know what caused the crash, but they
said weather was not a factor. The jet was acquired by the nation's
government-run domestic carrier about three months ago for $38
million.
   After Indian Airlines announced it was adding 31 Airbus 320s to
its aging fleet of Boeing, Fokker and Avro planes, news reports
criticized the airline for failing to adequately train pilots to
fly the sophisticated aircraft.
   The carrier was also criticized for failing to provide adequate
hangar space to house and maintain the planes.
   The last Indian Airlines crash occurred Oct. 19, 1988, when a
Boeing 737 crashed on final approach to an airport in the western
city of Ahmedabad, killing 133 of the 135 people on board. An
investigation later blamed pilot error for the accident, the worst
in the airline's 26-year history.
   On the same day, a Fokker propeller-driven plane operated by the
other domestic carrier, Vayudoot, slammed into the side of a
mountain during a fierce rainstorm. All 34 people on board died.
   Indian Airlines, the major domestic carrier, flies to 73 cities
nationwide and to nine nearby countries. It has come under
criticism for allegedly failing to maintain pre-flight safety
procedures on its fleet and to adequately supervise its pilots.
Delays in flight schedules also are endemic.
   Air India, also owned by the government, is the country's
international carrier.
   The A320, built by the European consortium Airbus Industrie, is
the first civilian airliner equipped with a fully computerized
flight control system, which the manufacturer says permits safer,
electronically controlled flight.
   Developed at a cost of nearly $2 billion, the A320 was certified
for flight on Feb. 26, 1988, and went into service in April 1988.

   A Marine pilot killed during a
training exercise bailed out of his jet because it was on fire, an
official said.
   A second aviator ejected safely from another plane during the
three-plane exercise Monday when he mistakenly thought his craft
was ablaze, said Capt. Kevin Murphy.
   The exercise over the Air-Ground Combat Center, 125 miles east
of Los Angeles, involved Marines from the 2nd Marine Aircraft Wing
in Cherry Point, N.C., Murphy said.
   The pilot who died, Capt. Thomas Kolb, 28, of San Diego ejected
from his single-seat AV-8B Harrier attack jet after another pilot
radioed him that his plane was on fire, said Murphy.
   The Harrier crashed in a remote area and Kolb was taken to Naval
Hospital, where he died nearly two hours later, he said.
   The aerial observer in a Marine OV-10 Bronco reconnaissance
plane ejected when he mistakenly thought the radio warning to Kolb
was for him, Murphy said. The observer, Capt. Jeffrey P. Schade of
Southhold, N.Y., was treated and released, Murphy said.
   Murphy said Marine investigators were trying to determine the
cause of the fire in Kolb's jet and why he died in the ejection.

   Two ``Star Wars'' satellites
rocketed into space Wednesday to test a plan to destroy enemy
missiles by bouncing deadly laser beams off orbiting mirrors.
   A mirror on one of the satellites was designed to reflect lasers
fired from a mountaintop in Hawaii back to a ground target to
assess the accuracy of a system for intercepting ballistic missiles.
   Sensors on the second payload were to measure laser strikes in a
test aimed at correcting laser distortions caused by dust, moisture
and gases as the beam shoots through the atmosphere.
   ``These are key technologies for developing a ground-based laser
system; if we get rid of the distortion in the atmosphere and get
good accuracy with the laser coming off a mirror, it is a major
step in our program to develop directed-energy weapons,'' said Air
Force Col. William Browning, one of the project managers.
   The satellites were carried aloft by a 12-story Delta rocket
that roared off its launch pad right on time at 11:15 a.m.
   ``The tracking chart shows the vehicle right down the middle of
the track; it's right on target,'' launch commentator Ray Adams
reported minutes after liftoff.
   Success of the mission could help preserve much of the $4.5
billion that President Bush has requested for research in budget
year 1991 for the program formally known as the Strategic Defense
Initiative. Some members of Congress want to cut deeply into that
amount.
   The beam-bouncing satellite, called Relay Mirror Experiment,
carried a 24-inch diameter mirror designed to point a laser beam
with an error of less than 57 millionths of a degree.
   The experiment will use two ground stations on Maui, Hawaii. One
is at the Air Force Maui Optical Station, located on the summit of
Mount Haleakala. The second is about 12 miles away, at the base of
the mountain.
   Both ground stations will aim low-powered laser beams
simultaneously at the 2,300-pound satellite, orbiting 270 miles up.
RME will use those two beams as signals to orient its mirror. When
the mountaintop station aims another beam at the satellite, the
beam should reflect off the mirror and strike a sensor target at
the second station.
   The tests, scheduled to start in about two weeks, were scheduled
to last about eight months, with RME passing within range of the
Hawaii stations at least once a day.
   The companion satellite is a 3,175-pound payload called LACE,
for Low-power Atmospheric Compensation Experiment. Its principal
instrument is a package of 210 laser-sensitive sensors packed into
a square measuring 13 feet on each side.
   The Mount Haleakala laser to be used on LACE is equipped with a
special flexible mirror designed to pre-distort the laser beam on
Earth in such a way that the expected atmospheric disturbances will
erase the distortion. The result should be a sharp and powerful
beam by the time it reaches LACE orbiting 340 miles high.
   Previous laser tests using targets on satellites and on space
shuttles have established a pattern for the type of distortion the
atmosphere causes.
   LACE also carries an experiment to acquire and track the exhaust
plumes of rockets in a test to determine which wavelengths are most
useful in detecting these plumes. Another experiment will measure
neutron levels in space in a test designed to help develop a means
of distinquishing between enemy warheads and decoys.
   The LACE experiments are expected to start in about 60 days and
continue for 30 months.

   The White House today denounced the kidnapping
of two Americans in Colombia to protest President Bush's planned
visit, saying it ``cannot allow threats of terrorism to influence
its policies or its activities.''
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Bush ``shares the
concern of all Americans about the kidnapping of these U.S.
citizens'' and would cooperate with Colombian officials to help
``in any way deemed appropriate to help resolve this situation.''
   Fitzwater also sought to minimize reports that Bush might use
the occasion of the drug summit to propose a ``radar net'' off
Colombia using U.S. warships to help track cocaine-carrying
aircraft.
   ``I don't expect him'' to bring it up at the drug conference
unless Colombia or other Latin American countries bring the subject
up first, Fitzwater said.
   The spokesman's comments came on the eve of Bush's day-long
attendance at a four-nation drug summit in Cartagena, a resort city
on the northern coast of Colombia.
   Colombian authorities on Tuesday reported that leftist
guerrillas had kidnapped two Americans in the drug capital of
Medellin, Colombia, to protest Bush's visit.
   They were identified as David Kent, a teacher from Indianapolis,
and James Donnelly, employed by a company that manufactures
hydraulic equipment.
   Although there had been reports that Donnelly had been released,
Fitzwater said today, ``We believe those reports are inacurrate.''
   He said the U.S. embassy had been in touch with members of
Donnelly's family. Fitzwater said Donnelly was kidnapped Monday
night, but his wife was ordered not to report the kidnapping until
Tuesday.
   ``The U.S. government cannot allow threats of terrorism to
influence its policies or its activities,'' Fitzwater said.
   Fitzwater said little was known about the group, calling itself
``the National Liberation Army,'' which claims responsibility for
the kidnappings, other than reports that it somehow has links with
Cuba.
   ``We trust Colombian authorities will pursue this matter and
secure the release of Mr. Kent and Mr. Donnelly as soon as
possible,'' Fitzwater said.
   Meanwhile, the spokesman seemed to be backtracking from comments
of the day before by National Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft that
he expected Bush would discuss a proposed ``radar net'' at the
Cartagena summit.
   Acknowledging extreme sensitivies in Latin American toward any
hint of a U.S. military role in the region, Fitzwater said some
senior administration officials were concerned that news accounts
of Scowcroft's remarks might not be well received by Colombian
officials.
   Colombia objected strenuously to earlier reports that the United
States was considering a naval ``blockade.''
   Fitzwater said today that any plans for using U.S. forces,
including the ``radar net'' proposal, should be deemed ``on the
shelf'' unless Colombia or other drug-producing nations ask for
specific U.S. help.
   ``We want to be able to persuade these countries we can be
helpful _ at their request,'' Fitzwater said.
   The spokesman also held out the prospect that the administration
would support some package of trade aid or concessions to help
promote alternate crops in Colombia, including flowers and coffee.
   Colombian officials have protested that U.S. trade policies have
undercut these exports at the very time American officials are
seeking to curb cocaine production and persuade farmers in Andean
nations to switch to other crops.
   Fitzwater said it was unlikely much progress would be made on
this dispute at Thursday's meeting, but ``this is an area for
discussion'' down the road.
   Colombian authorities say some 5,000 security agents will be in
Cartagena to protect the four presidents. And two Amerrican
warships have been deployed in the Caribbean, along with a
Colombian escort ship.
   The U.S. vessels are the USS Nassau, an 820-foot amphibious
assault ship which carries helicopters and a Marine landing team,
and the USS Sampson, a 437-foot destroyer armed with missiles and
two five-inch guns.
   Scowcroft acknowledged risks are involved in the trip.
   ``Of course, it's an unusual situation because there are in
Colombia these guerrilla bands, terrorist bands with access to
funds to purchase on the open market any kinds of arms, and so
naturally there are unusual circumstances,'' Scowcroft said Tuesday
at a White House briefing.
   ``But we think they're adequately taken care of,'' he added.
   The main purpose of Bush's attendance at the summit is a show of
U.S. support for drug-fighting efforts in the three Andean
drug-producing nations, plus the expected issuance of a joint
communique vowing an increased effort to fight the problem.

<HEAD>Sources Say U.S., Exxon Talking Plea Bargain in Alaska Spill</HEAD>

   Exxon Corp. and the Justice Department are
conducting plea negotiations over possible criminal charges
stemming from last year's massive Exxon Valdez oil tanker spill,
government sources said today.
   Negotiations between government and Exxon lawyers are focusing
on a possible plea bargain to settle environmental criminal charges
that could be brought, said the sources, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Justice Department spokeswoman Deborah Burstion-Wade confirmed
discussions between department lawyers and Exxon, but she declined
to say if they involved negotiations over possible criminal charges.
   Sources said prosecutors from the environmental crimes section
of the department's Land and Natural Resources Division were
participating in the negotiations.
   A plea bargain involving criminal charges could be an outcome of
those discussions, said the sources. A settlement could come in the
next month, one source said.
   The negotiations were first reported in today's editions of The
Wall Street Journal.
   Company spokesman Bill Smith said Exxon had no immediate comment
on the report.
   The nation's worst oil spill occurred last March when the
987-foot tanker Exxon Valdez ran aground on a reef along Alaska's
southern coast, spilling more than 10 million gallons of North
Slope crude.
   The tanker's captain, Joseph Hazelwood, is on trial in state
court in Anchorage on charges of criminal mischief, reckless
endangerment and operating a vessel while intoxicated.
   He faces a maximum sentence of seven years and three months in
prison and possible fines totaling $61,000 if convicted on all
counts.
   The Journal also reported that separate negotiations are under
way over creation of a $500 million fund to be bankrolled by Exxon
to complete the cleanup of the oil spill and restore the Alaska
coastline.

   Authorities reported no problems today as
students filed into Selma's public schools amid heavy security for
a second day after classes were shut down for a week by a racial
protest.
   ``Everybody got in peaceably,'' said National Guard Sgt. Norman
Arnold.
   Gov. Guy Hunt ordered 200 National Guardsmen into Selma on
Tuesday to help local police and state troopers protect students at
the nine public schools that had been closed since last Wednesday.
Two others closed a day earlier.
   ``This is the first time troopers have been used to ensure that
whites could go to school,'' said Jamie Wallace, executive director
of the Selma chamber of commerce.
   The level of protest sparked by the dismissal of superintendent
Norward Roussell seemed to recede from past days when demonstrators
thronged City Hall, rekindling memories of civil rights marches in
Selma in 1965.
   There were no immediate figures on today's attendance. No
student protesters showed up at Selma High School when classes
began.
   On Tuesday, about 150 black student protesters boycotted the
high school and marched around the flagpole before the opening
bell, chanting ``Shut 'em down! No school!''
   At City Hall, about two dozen protesters continued a sit-in for
a seventh day. Outside, some protesters carried placards saying
``Equality! Education!''
   ``Both black and white parents seriously want their children
back in schools,'' said Roussell, in announcing Tuesday's
absenteeism rate was below the 30 percent that had been expected.
About 77 percent of the school system's 5,971 students returned to
classes Tuesday, he said.
   Roussell was restored last week but protesters want his contract
to be extended another three years. He had earlier been dismissed
by the majority white school board.
   Selma's population is 52 percent black.
   Roussell said he doubted the conflict will end ``until there is
some movement on my contract,'' which expires in June.
   His supporters say he was dismissed because of race and his
efforts to place blacks in higher learning levels. Detractors said
the decision was made because Roussell lacked the adequate
managerial skills. He has held the $80,000 post for 2{ years.
   ``It saddens me that children have to be pulled into a political
and racial conflict that should have been solved years ago, after
the Edmund Pettus Bridge,'' Roussell said, referring to the Selma
bridge where civil rights marchers were clubbed by state troopers
in 1965.
   Police Chief Melvin Summerlin said a 16-year-old white student
reported he was beaten by three blacks with a brick and sticks as
he walked alone from the high school's agriculture center to the
main building about three hours after classes resumed.
   Summerlin said the teen-ager, who was not seriously injured,
indicated his assailants were older than students. He said the
teen-ager told officers the men said they were beating him because
he was white.
   The school system is about 70 percent black, and some white
parents have moved their children to private schools or other
systems during the past week. Roussell said 54 students were
withdrawn from schools Tuesday, but he believes most will return
``once they see we're open and things are going smoothly.''

   The four World War II Allies, vanquishers of Nazi
Germany and occupiers of Berlin, have begun a process aimed at
ensuring a unified Germany will not pose a threat to world security.
   Foreign ministers from France, Britain, the Soviet Union and
United States announced Tuesday that they would meet with their
counterparts from East and West Germany to discuss the alignment
and military strength of a unified Germany.
   No date for such a meeting was given, but before it takes place
the two Germanys will be left alone to tackle the considerable
domestic hurdles that must be overcome before unity is possible.
   With Tuesday's announcement, the powers that divided Germany in
1945 clearly acknowledged that reunification is inevitable now that
Communist rule has collapsed in East Germany.
   The brief, one-paragraph statement did not address U.S. concerns
that a unified Germany belongs to the NATO alliance. The Soviet
Union seeks a neutral state. The announcement said preliminary
talks by lower-level officials on a unified Germany's place in the
new European order would begin ``shortly.''
   It was released about an hour before the Soviet Union and United
States announced agreement on troops cuts in Europe in which the
Soviets essentially accept a proposal by President Bush and agree
to a ceiling of 195,000 troops for each side in Central Europe.
   The agreement allows the United States to keep an additional
30,000 troops elsewhere in Europe, which Mikhail S. Gorbachev had
rejected just last week in seeking parity.
   The announcements came during a conference of 23 NATO and Warsaw
Pact countries on opening up the world's skies to surveillance by
unarmed military planes. On that issue, they tentatively agreed to
allow the first legal spy flights over each other's territory. The
accord is to be finalized May 12.
   Officials have shied away from saying when a unified Germany
could become a reality, but the two German states are moving
swiftly toward that end. On Tuesday, they set up a joint commission
to set up a single currency.
   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said: ``The
president finds that a very reasonable approach to the unification
question and we are quite supportive.''
   He called it ``a good beginning that ensures a certain degree of
stability and sureness of course as we proceed through this.''
   West Germany's foreign minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, said in
Ottawa on Tuesday that he hoped a 35-nation summit would address
the issue of reunification in November.
   The statemen on a single German state said six-country talks
would focus on ``external aspects of the establishment of German
unity, including the issues of security of the neighboring states.''
   The foreign ministers made no comment after release of
statement, apparently reflecting their desire not to create undue
expectations or prejudice the work facing the two Germanys.
   The four-power plan, adapted from a U.S. initiative, calls for
the powers to address external security concerns only after East
Germans elect new leaders in free elections set for March 18, U.S.
officials said.
   The plan was first set forward by Secretary of State James A.
Baker III and dubbed ``Two Plus Four'' for the two Germanys and the
Allies.
   The statement came after the foreign ministers met for several
hours on the issue, overshadowing the ``Open Skies'' conference.
   The subject of German reunion has preoccupied NATO and the
Warsaw Pact since East Germany's hard-line Communist leader Erich
Honecker was ousted in November in a peaceful popular revolt.
   The country's discredited Communists struggled to hold on to
power but agreed last month to share power with opposition groups
until the elections. But there is no confidence in East Germany's
economy and the Westward exodus has not abated.
   Genscher sought to reassure the world that a unified Germany
will not pose a threat to peace.
   ``We tell all our neighbors what we want to unite: The Federal
Republic of Germany, the German Democratic Republic and the whole
of Berlin _ no less, and no more. We do not have territorial claims
against any of our neighbors.''
   ``We seek a European Germany, not a German Europe,'' he said.
   Concern about Germany's alignment stems from the strategic
importance of the region, and the possibility that a unified
Germany could again become an aggressor. West Germany's
500,000-troop military is the biggest in Western Europe, having
been stoked by NATO as a frontline defense against a Warsaw Pact
invasion.
   Along with unification, West German officials reportedly have
promised to cut their forces by about 100,000 troops, and East
Germany would disband its army, said David Shorr, an analyst at the
British American Security Information Council in Washington.
   The four powers were under pressure to keep the West German
military in check and so they devised the ``Two Plus Four'' plan,
said Shorr, who attended the conference.
   NATO has insisted that a unified Germany be part of the
16-member North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   But the Soviet Union, which maintains about 380,000 troops in
East Germany, wants a unified Germany demilitarized so ``it can be
of no threat to others,'' Foreign Ministry adviser Vitaly Churkin
said Monday.
   Britain's foreign secretary, Douglas Hurd, said Tuesday that few
countries at the conference other than the Soviet Union have
suggested a unified Germany would be neutral.
   Genscher did not mention the neutrality issue specifically in
his Tuesday speech, saying only that unification should occur in
the context of integration of the European community and that
nothing will be negotiated without participation of the four World
War II Allies.
   As part of the plan, a unified Germany also likely would
renounce the use or stationing on its soil of nuclear weapons, U.S.
officials said.
   Germany's neighbors in Europe would have a voice in the talks
during the second phase, a Polish Embassy official said on
condition he not be identified.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev today lashed out at
rioters in the republic of Tadzhikistan and called for harsh action
against them, saying the ``country's destiny and the safety of our
citizens is at stake.''
   The Tass news agency said more soldiers were sent to Dushanbe,
the capital of Tadzhikistan, but officials denied news reports that
37 people were killed in rioting. Two separate reports put the
death toll at 11 or 12.
   Shouting with anger during a parliamentary session, Gorbachev
criticized the Interior Ministry for releasing three suspects. The
violence in Dushanbe is the latest in ethnic disturbances that have
killed hundreds of people in Central Asia and the Caucasus in the
past year.
   ``This is a kind of chain reaction accompanied by an orgy of
violence,'' Gorbachev said. ``We should throw the book at those
who, under slogans of ethnic revival, draw people into a fight for
their ambitions and selfish goals.''
   He said new legislation was being prepared to deal with the
issue.
   ``The country's destiny and the safety of our citizens is at
stake, comrades. We must do everything to put out the fire.''
   Mikhail Shtatnov, a spokesman for the republic's Interior
Ministry, said young men from surrounding villages entered Dushanbe
this morning and prowled the city's suburbs, damaging buildings. He
said the center of the city was under the control of soldiers and
armor.
   He denied a TV and Moscow Radio report late Tuesday that 37
people had been killed. He said 11 had died and 143 were injured in
the rioting that broke out Monday. Tass put the death toll at 12,
and said that among the injured were 50 militia and soldiers.
   Shtatnov said none of the dead had been killed by Interior
Ministry soldiers. But Malik Khadyrov of the state radio and TV in
Dushanbe said his correspondents reported seeing some people shot
and killed by soldiers.
   The government issued a radio appeal for citizens in the
capital, Dushanbe, to fight the bands of rioters, said a resident,
Zina Ushanova. The city's streets were patrolled by soldiers in
tanks and armored personnel carriers.
   Violence broke out Monday in the city of 400,000 after rumors
spread that thousands of Armenian refugees from ethnic violence in
the Caucasus were being given preference for new housing at the
expense of natives.
   Soviet journalist Anatoly Larenok said the republic's Communist
leader offered his resignation today in a bid to quell the violence.
   Protesters angered over the dismal state of the economy are
demanding the resignation of the predominantly Moslem republic's
entire Communist leadership.
   After two days of attacks on Communist headquarters, crowds
gathered again today in the main square of Duhanbe, said Larenok, a
correspondent for the national newspaper Vozdushny Transport.
   The crowd demanded that those killed be buried in the square,
Larenok said. He said officials refused.
   All stores were closed and no bread was available, Mrs. Ushanova
said by telephone. Public transportation was stopped, she said.
   Radio Moscow said bands of young men were ignoring the 10 p.m.-6
a.m. curfew and state of emergency imposed Monday. It said dozens
were detained.
   The government called on residents of the city to don white
headbands to distinguish themselves from rioters, who it described
as mostly young men.
   Tensions also were reported high Monday in Frunze, capital of
the neighboring republic of Kirgizia on the border with China,
following rumors that Armenian refugees were to receive apartments
in the city, Komsomolskaya Pravda newspaper said. No violence was
reported there.
   Interfax, a publication of Radio Moscow, said the crowd Tuesday
demanded the deportation of all Armenians from Tadzhikistan, the
closure of an ecologically dangerous aluminum plant, the return to
the republic of all proceeds from cotton production, and the
resignations of the Communist Party and government leadership.
   Tadzhikistan Communist Party leader Kakhar Makhkamov offered his
resignation to an emergency meeting of the party Central Committee,
but the leadership rejected it while the unrest was continuing,
Larenok said.
   The party meeting was attended by alternate national Politburo
member Boris Pugo, the journalist said.
   Komsomolskaya Pravda reported that Makhkamov also had told a
crowd Monday that he intended to resign.
   Larenok said at least 300 Armenians have fled the city aboard
special flights to Yerevan, the Armenian capital.
   Some of the mainly Christian Armenians had fled from the
violence in the predominantly Moslem Azerbaijan. Armenians have
been involved for the last two years in bloody dispute with
predominantly Azerbaijanis over control of the Nagorno-Karabakh
region of Azerbaijan.
   More than 200 people have been killed in the southern Caucasus
republics of Armenia and Azerbaijan since Jan. 13. Gorbachev sent
thousands of soldiers into the area to end a nationalist revolt in
the Azerbaijani capital of Baku and end attacks on Armenians.

   Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers
throughout the country.
   Feb. 10
   The Providence (R.I.) Journal-Bulletin on Reagan-Poindexter:
   The Iran-contra affair began as a series of policy blunders by
the Reagan administration, quickly developed into a witch hunt
conducted by the Democratic-controlled Congress _ and then became
an inordinately expensive and seemingly interminable legal farce
scripted by Special Prosecutor Lawrence Walsh. Now U.S. District
Judge Harold Greene threatens to turn it into a constitutional
morass as well.
   Having broken seven butterflies on his prosecutorial wheel, ...
Walsh is now preparing to go after his eighth and presumable final
quarry, ... (former national security adviser John) Poindexter. But
before that can happen, the country may be subjected to a
protracted constitutional controversy. For ... Poindexter's lawyers
want to go through President Reagan's volumimous private diaries to
see if they can find something _ anything _ that might suggest
their client was acting under presidential directions. ...
   (Green) has taken the unprecedented action of ordering ...
Reagan to submit to videotaped interrogation by defense lawyers.
... This long-running travesty has already inflicted personal
damage on several honorable, if overzealous, public servants. It
should not be allowed to undermine the institutional authority of
the presidency as well.

<TEXT>
   Feb. 8
   Concord (N.H.) Monitor on Reagan-Poindexter:
   To date, all the Contra-gate conspirators have received less
punishment for their crimes against democracy than most car
thieves. ...
   Did Ronald Reagan actually authorize that gross abuse of the
Constitution to get around a reluctant Congress? Did he, in
essence, conduct a private war? And did President Bush, as we
believe, sit in on the planning? ...
   Reagan, like (Richard) Nixon before him, is aruing that he must
claim executive privilege to protect the privacy rights of future
presidents. We are respectful of those rights, but they do not
include the right to cover up crimes and abuses of power.
   The law says Reagan will have to testify or produce his diaries
only if it is absolutely crucial to (former national security
adviser John) Poindexter's defense. Lt. Col. Oliver North, you'll
remember, received a light sentence largely because most jurors
believed he was following orders from Poindexter and other
superiors. Poindexter has pointed the finger higher. It is crucial
to his defense, and to the truth, that Reagan finally come clean.

   Freedom took a new meaning Sunday (Feb. 11) as the world watched
Nelson Mandela walk out of 27 years of captivity. The exultant
celebration of his countrymen measured their own expectations. The
violence that accompanied the celebration underscored the
complexity of what lies ahead.
   The climax of the day was written in Mandela's address to the
nation, as the man imprisoned for terrorism set the agenda for all
South Africans. With eloquence and vision, he looked beyond the
bondage of apartheid to ``the establishment of democracy'' on ``a
non-racial basis.''
   He used his first hours of freedom to facilitate what now needs
to happen. He was conciliatory, praising President Frederick W. de
Klerk as ``a man of integrity'' and recognizing his constructive
leadership. But he was also realistic, insisting on two
preconditions for negotiations: the end of the national emergency
and the release of the remaining political prisoners. ...
   Mandela also issued useful warnings: ``To lift sanctions now
would run the risk of aborting the process toward the complete
eradication of apartheid.'' That reality has been accepted by the
American government. The struggle, he cautioned, is not yet over.
...
   Mandela walked free from prison but not from a system of racism
that still strangles the lives of the blacks. ... Unpredictable
forces have been freed with him. They provide now unprecedented
risk, but also opportunity.

   Portland (Maine) Press Herald on South Africa:
   Now that (Nelson Mandela) has been released, it remains to be
seen whether he can translate his special status as a political
symbol into practical administrative leadership. In other words,
can a man cut off from the world for more than a quarter of a
century effectively deal with that world when suddenly thrust back
into it?
   There is no shortage of hope _ not only among South Africans
themselves but within the world community _ that he can do so. And
the words he spoke with such vigor, dignity and resoluteness on
Sunday (Feb. 11) can only bolster that hope.
   While acknowledging South African President Frederik W. de
Klerk's role in opening opportunities for change, he vowed never to
retreat from his own struggle for ``a democratic and free society
in which all persons live together in harmony and with equal
opportunities.''
   It was precisely that vow that landed Mandela in prison 27 years
ago. That it had to be repeated shows how little political progress
in South Africa has made in the intervening years. That is was
spoken freely this time shows how much progress has been made in
just the past few days.
   A lot now hangs on the ability of a heroic symbol to give
practical shape to that long-deferred struggle.

   Francesco Folonari, the innovative general
manager of one of Italy's most prestigious Chianti wineries, has
died at the age of 60, Italian media reported Wednesday.
   Folonari died Monday of complications following heart surgery,
according to the reports.
   Born in 1929, Folonari entered the family winery Chianti Ruffino
SpA following the death of his father in 1951. He had served as
general manager of the winery since 1966.
   In 1954, Folonari introduced screwtop wine bottles with a
deposit added to the price to reuse the bottles. Both were firsts
for the Italian wine market.
   Asked about his company's policy of innovation, Folonari was
reported to have said, ``One must continually keep one's mentality
up to date, even for daily table wine.''

   Lions may be king of the jungle, but two of
them cowered in fear when they found themselves in the middle of a
busy highway.
   The pair fell out of a trailer during rush hour Tuesday on
Interstate 40. A witness said the trailer door opened and the lions
``just rolled out.''
   ``We don't know how it came open,'' said owner Jerry Garrett, a
pet shop proprietor in Purcell who was pulling the trailer. ``After
they landed, they just sat there and cowered. They were scared.''
   Neither of the lions, Sampson and Casey, was injured.
   Animal control officers used a tranquilizer gun to sedate them
before using nooses to load them back into the trailer. ``They were
pretty docile. We just took precautions,'' said Lt. Stewart Meyer,
Highway Patrol spokesman.
   Garrett said the animals were used for shows, promotions and
education.
   His store was fined $1,000 in June after Sampson, then a
7-month-old cub, knocked its cage open and bit a 6-year-old girl.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture alleged the store was negligent
in handling and housing the lions there.
   Garrett said he was moving the lions from the store to a 68-acre
ranch he owns in Purcell, where they are to be put on display
behind 12-foot fences.

<TEXT>
   East Germany's heavily industrialized
economy was long touted as one of the strongest in the East bloc,
but an exodus of workers devastated productivity and has hastened
moves toward unification with West Germany.
   When East German leaders opened the country's borders Nov. 9,
they were hoping to stop the flight by convincing citizens that
serious reforms were under way.
   But the exodus spiraled, bringing the economy closer to
collapse. More than 85,000 East Germans have come West this year,
joining 340,000 who arrived last year.
   Peter Pietsch, an economist for the West German bank
Commerzbank, said the effect on East Germany has been devastating.
   ``In many offices, every fourth of fifth employee is missing,''
Pietsch told The Associated Press. ``The country could face a
collapse if this outflow continues.''
   Statistics released Tuesday in East Germany show how bad the
situation is: industrial production fell 5.6 percent in January
1990 compared to the previous year, mostly because of the exodus,
the government said. The lost productivity has led to a severe drop
in exports, it said.
   Serious worker shortages have been reported across East Germany.
Mail is no longer delivered in some areas because there's no one to
deliver it. Soldiers are being used to operate trolleys.
   Strikes and slowdowns by workers who fear they could lose their
jobs as East Germany undergoes democratic change are another factor.
   East Germany's economy always lagged behind that of Western
industrialized nations. But for years it was considered the
strongest in the Soviet bloc, churning out industrial goods,
chemicals and other products for itself and other East bloc
countries.
   Its average per capita income last year was the highest in the
East bloc.
   But a growing number of East Germans are attracted to wealthy
West Germany because of the prospects of living the kinds of lives
they were denied under 40 years of rigid Communist rule.
   West Germany's own social services, in addition to its job and
housing markets, are seriously burdened by the newcomers, and the
dire situation has led to a number of moves toward unification.
   In Ottawa, Canada, on Tuesday, it was announced the two German
states and the four World War II victors _ the United States,
Britain, France and the Soviet Union _ would soon begin talks on
German unification.
   On Wednesday, the West German Cabinet approved a supplementary
1990 budget that provides $3.45 billion in funding for ``immediate
measures'' to help East Germany.
   The two German states _ at West Germany's initiation _ are also
about to undertake talks on establishing a common currency, with
West Germany's powerful Deutsch mark the currency for both
countries.
   This would be a giant leap toward unification.
   When the idea first arose, there was considerable opposition
from West German financial experts who feared it could result in
higher taxes and drag down the value of the Deutsch mark.
   Economists are still advising that such a step be taken
cautiously. But support for the idea has grown with acknowledgment
of East Germany's desperate condition.
   Economists say it will take huge amounts of money to rebuild
East Germany's economy, but they believe it can be done in 10 years.
   Pietsch said West Germany's construction industry especially
sees good possibilities for investment in East Germany, once
free-market economic conditions are established there. His
Commerzbank plans to open branch offices in East Germany at some
point.
   ``The machinery and equipment is generally better in East
Germany than in other East bloc countries,'' he said. ``The
prerequisites are there for a strong economic upswing once
investments from the West get going,'' he said.

   The prosecution demanded Wednesday
that three radical students charged with assaulting the U.S.
ambassador's residence be sentenced to five years in prison.
   Prosecutors demanded four-year terms for three other students
who briefly occupied the residence of U.S. Ambassador Donald Gregg
in Seoul in October.
   The students scaled the walls of Gregg's residence at daybreak
and occupied it for nearly an hour, hurling homemade bombs and
swinging iron bars, before officers drove them out. Gregg and his
wife escaped unhurt through a side door.
   The students said they wanted to protest U.S. trade pressure on
South Korea, which they claimed was hurting poor farmers.
Washington pressured South Korea to reduce its trade surplus by
increasing its market for U.S. products.
   Radicals are a small but vocal minority in South Korea. Their
public support has decreased sharply in recent years because of
their violent tactics and extremist views.

   Police announced a five-day ban on
demonstrations and rallies outside the president's office beginning
at midnight Wednesday, apparently to thwart a protest planned by
the opposition.
   The opposition Awami League denounced the restriction as
``undemocratic'' and said it would go ahead with the planned march
Thursday to demand the resignation of President Hussain Mohammed
Ershad.
   ``The ban ... shows how nervous the government is about the
democratic movement,'' said party general secretary Sajeda
Chowdhury.
   The Awami League and another opposition group, the Bangladesh
Nationalist Party, are campaigning for the resignation of Ershad,
which they say will pave the way for free and fair elections.
   Opposition parties, charging the government with corruption and
autocracy, have sponsored several strikes and demonstrations in
recent months to press their demand.
   A former army general, Ershad, 59, took power in 1982 in a
bloodless military coup. Since then he has held one presidential
election and two parliamentary votes. All the elections have been
marked by allegations of fraud.
   Ershad has said he is ready to hold new elections, but the
opposition has refused to participate unless he resigns first. They
say elections under Ershad would be rigged in favor of his Jatiya
Party.

   Israel presented Lebanese police with a
small fleet of Mercedeses on Wednesday so they can better patrol
the Israeli-controlled zone of south Lebanon, security sources said.
   One source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
Israelis asked the police to inscribe the six cars ``Lebanese
Police.'' The source said there are some 150 Lebanese policemen
inside the zone.
   The Beirut government only sends them paychecks and uniforms. It
avoids giving them orders that contradict Israel's interests in the
zone. Unlike other police stations, the force in the Israeli zone
does not maintain radio contact with headquarters in Beirut.
   Israel carved out the six-to-10-mile strip in 1985 when it
withdrew the bulk of its invasion army from Lebanon after a
three-year occupation. It is to serve as a buffer against
cross-border raids into Israel.
   In addition to Lebanese police, the zone is patrolled by about
1,500 Israeli troops and 3,500 militiamen of the Israeli-backed
South Lebanon Army.

<TEXT>
   Soviet objections to NATO membership for a
united Germany remain a major obstacle to reunification despite
optimism in both East and West Germany that they soon will be one
again.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union has said
Germany cannot be part of the ``structure of NATO'' and unification
should lead to neutrality or even demilitarization.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany wants to keep a united
Germany in the alliance, and the United States is intent on it.
   As a compromise, Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher of West
Germany has proposed keeping NATO and Warsaw Pact troops out of
what is now East Germany.
   The United States now has 255,000 soldiers in West Germany and
the Soviet Union has more than 380,000 in East Germany. On Tuesday,
they agreed to reduce their troops in Central Europe to 195,000
each.
   NATO membership is an important issue for West Germans, whose
nation is among the world's richest after four decades of
protection by the Western alliance.
   A look across the crumbling Berlin Wall at the grime-covered,
ill-kept buildings of East Berlin is enough to convince most people
NATO membership has its advantages.
   ``For the Federal Republic of Germany, I see little change in
the NATO position,'' says Josef Janning, an East-West specialist at
the University of Mainz.
   He said West Germany's leaders would insist on retaining NATO
membership, but the issue is complicated and Janning told The
Associated Press he feels demilitarizing East Germany is the most
practical solution.
   Janning said demilitarized status could end when Europe worked
out its security arrangements. ``If there are no crises in Eastern
Europe and there is no coup in the Soviet Union, that could happen
as early as this decade,'' he said.
   That would lead to a radical realignment of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization, turning its attention to Atlantic rather than
land defenses, Janning said.
   He added that the United States would be a smaller military
presence and the rest of its missiles would be removed, but he
predicted nuclear weapons would remain in Europe because its
security arrangements would include them.
   The Soviet Union, which lost more than 20 million people in
World War II, wants a single Germany demilitarized so ``it can be
of no threat to others,'' Soviet Foreign Ministry adviser Vitaly
Churkin said Monday at an East-West conference in Ottawa.
   Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd of Britain said Tuesday few
countries in Ottawa except the Soviets suggested a neutral Germany.
   Soviet officials also have spoken of abolishing NATO and the
Warsaw Pact altogther, but the comments were greeted skeptically in
Washington and Western Europe.
   East Germany's caretaker government also insists on neutrality,
and the new administration to be chosen in free elections next
month is expected to oppose full NATO membership.
   In a poll conducted last week, 92 percent of the 1,429 East
Germans surveyed favored neutrality. It was conducted by the
Wickert Institute of West Germany for Quick magazine, based in
Munich.
   West Germany's opposition Social Democrats have said cutting the
size of West Germany's armed forces might resolve the issue.
   Defense spokesman Andreas von Buelow said: ``The Soviets will
prove cooperative if they can be sure the German side cannot mount
an offensive war and if no threats to borders come from there.''
   The Social Democrats have a large following in East Germany.

<HEAD>Study: Blacks More Likely to Get Tuberculosis</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: For release at 6 p.m. EST.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The relatively high rate of tuberculosis among
blacks, long blamed on poverty, appears to result in part from a
genetic susceptibility to the disease, a study concludes.
   The study found that in nursing homes and prisons, where the
races have identical living conditions, blacks are twice as likely
as whites to become infected with TB bacteria.
   Researchers said they were surprised by their discovery, which
suggests that while crowded housing and other social conditions
play important roles in spreading the disease, genetic factors also
appear to influence people's ability to resist TB.
   ``We found that there is a systemic difference between whites
and blacks,'' said Dr. William W. Stead. ``Whites seem to be more
able to fend off the organism without it's ever being able to
establish an infection.''
   Stead happened upon the apparent difference while analyzing
nursing home and prison statistics at the Arkansas Department of
Health. He reported his findings in Thursday's New England Journal
of Medicine.
   Another soon-to-be published study reports the discovery of a
racial difference in the way blood cells respond to the TB
bacteria, which could help explain why blacks seem more prone to
getting tuberculosis.
   The Arkansas study was based largely on a review of 25,398
elderly people who were free of TB infection when they were
admitted to nursing homes in the state. When they were retested at
least two months later, 14 percent of the blacks and 7 percent of
the whites showed evidence of TB infections.
   Prison data from Arkansas and Minnesota also found that black
inmates were twice as likely as white prisoners to catch the
bacteria while incarcerated.
   ``It's a very intriguing finding,'' said Dr. George Comstock of
Johns Hopkins University. ``I never quite believe anything until
somebody replicates it. But I don't know of any real holes in this
one.''
   About 22,000 cases of tuberculosis are reported annually in the
United States, resulting in 1,700 deaths. In the population at
large, tuberculosis is about six times as common among blacks as
whites.
   The disease, which attacks the lungs, has long been associated
with poor, crowded living conditions. An estimated 10 million
Americans are believed to be infected with the bacteria but not
sick.
   Dr. George Curlin of the National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious diseases called the new findings ``plausible and
provocative.''
   ``I'm scared to death that people are going to say this explains
it all and forget everything else,'' he said. ``Of the total six
times difference, what proportion is attributable to biology and
what to social factors? I would say that biology is relatively
minor.''
   In his study Stead speculated that whites have evolved better
defenses against TB because the bacteria has long been common in
Europe and parts of Africa north of the Sahara but is traditionally
rare in sub-Saharan Africa.
   In contrast, blacks are genetically more resistant than whites
to malaria, which is common in Africa.
   In the other study, Dr. Alfred Crowle of Webb-Waring Lung
Institute at the University of Colorado found differences in the
resistance of germ-eating blood cells called macrophages. In
blacks, these cells are more likely to harbor TB infections.
   ``This helps explain why black people are more susceptible to
tuberculosis than are white people,'' said Crowle.
   At the turn of the century, TB was the leading cause of death in
the United States. The number of cases fell steadily until 1984.
   Experts believe the decline has leveled off in part because of
the emergence of the AIDS virus, which weakens the body's
resistance to infections. Others possible factors include
homelessness and immigration of people from areas where the disease
is still common.

   The Academy voter, who can be as contrary as
Jessica Tandy in ``Driving Miss Daisy,'' ignored the sex- and
action-charged blockbusters of 1989 to bestow major nominations
Wednesday on films about race relations, Vietnam and the
handicapped.
   Ler cerebral palsy (``My Left Foot'').
   Nor did the Academy voter succumb to a failing memory. Although
studios favor late-year releases for Oscar hopefuls, two of the
best-picture nominees were released early in the year: ``Dead Poets
Society'' and ``Field of Dreams.''
   No matter that the late Laurence Olivier had created an
unforgettable ``Henry V,'' winning a special Academy Award in 1946.
The new, scruffier ``Henry V'' (or ``Hank Cinq'' as the Olivier
version was called) won a best actor nomination for the new kid on
the classics block, Kenneth Branagh.
   The odds were against a nomination for Marlon Brando as
supporting actor in ``A Dry White Season.'' After all, he had
thumbed his nose at the Academy in 1973, sending a young Indian
woman to reject his Oscar for ``The Godfather.'' Besides, few
people had seen ``A Dry White Season,'' an earnest, uneven film
about apartheid in South Africa. But Brando's two scenes contained
enough of his oldtime magic to make him a nominee.
   When Gloria Swanson lost the Oscar for her role of a lifetime in
``Sunset Boulevard'' (1950), she groused that it was unfair to
compete with an actress who had played her role hundreds of times
on the stage (she lost to Judy Holliday, who had created the Billie
Dawn role in ``Born Yesterday'' in the theater).
   If the Swanson theory had been adopted, Pauline Collins
(``Shirley Valentine''), Morgan Freeman (``Driving Miss Daisy'')
and Kenneth Branagh (``Henry V'') would not have been eligible for
the acting nominations. On the London and New York stages, Miss
Collins comprised the entire cast of ``Shirley Valentine.''
   Among the many surprises in the 62nd nominations was Isabelle
Adjani, nominated as best actress in the subtitled French film
``Camille Claudia.'' Sophia Loren won as best actress for the
Italian ``Two Women'' in 1961, and Max Von Sydow was nominated last
year for Denmark's ``Pele the Conqueror.'' But rarely has the
Academy recognized an actor who speaks a foreign tongue.
   For the second time in a row, Academy members refused to
nominate a popular documentary; this year it was Michael Moore's
humorous and controversial indictment of General Motors, ``Roger &amp;
Me.''
   Recent weeks have brought criticism of Moore's film for its
faulty juxtaposition of time elements and its entertainment values
at the expense of accuracy.
   So the Academy voter again defies the wise money and casts a
ballot on the basis of conscience and artistic integrity. It should
be a dandy awards festival on March 26.

   At least 51 Vassar College students
barricaded themselves inside the main campus administration
building today to protest a racist remark allegedly uttered by Sen.
Daniel Patrick Moynihan.
   The students blocked the doors by standing in front of them and
``it appears that many students ... couldn't get out even if they
wanted to,'' said John Wordock, a Vassar senior who is also a
reporter for WKIP in Poughkeepsie.
   According to the Vassar Black Student Union, Moynihan on Jan. 29
told a black Jamaican who is a Dutchess County official that if she
doesn't like it in the United States, she should pack her bags and
go back to where she came from.
   Moynihan allegedly made the comment at a reception after giving
a speech at the college, students said. The woman, Folami Gray,
said she was questioning him about treatment of minorities in this
country.
   Gray, who heads Dutchess County's youth bureau, said she took
issue with some of Moynihan's statements during the speech and that
his comment to her was meant to embarrass and silence her.
   Moynihan spokesman Brian Connolly said that New York's
Democratic senator had no recollection of the conversation, but
that if Gray was offended by any of his comments, it was
unintentional.
   A student told The Associated Press today that the students
inside the main administration building would not leave until their
demands were met.
   ``What our demand is, first we want to make sure that (Moynihan)
is deposed'' from Vassar's Eleanor Roosevelt Chair, a lecture
position, said Jubi Headley, a Vassar junior. ``And we also have a
list of demands ... it's a combination of things that have built up
over time.''
   Moynihan is only the second person to hold the Roosevelt Chair,
established for discussion on such issues as civil rights, status
of women, human rights, and international relations.
   He said the students wanted an ``intercultural center'' for
minority meetings, a rabbi to minister to Jewish students and
handicapped access to all buildings. Talks were scheduled with
campus officials, he said.
   Headley confirmed that nobody was being allowed in or out of the
first-floor college administrative offices and no telephone calls
other than emergency calls were being transferred from the
switchboard there. He said students who live on the second floor
were being allowed to use other entrances.

   A plant worker who said she suffered an
anxiety attack after her foreman cursed at her has been awarded
$60,000 in damages.
   A jury last week ordered Monsanto Co. and a supervisor to pay
Irma White the amount for emotional and physical stress.
   White contended that she and two workers in the canning
department at the plant in Luling were awaiting safety equipment in
1986 when Gary McDermott ``violently berated them for not
working,'' according to court papers.
   McDermott and Monsanto denied White's allegations. But as
supervisor, McDermott had the right to chastise the workers, who
did ``no productive work'' for an hour and 45 minutes, the company
said in court papers.
   Monsanto spokesman George Williamson said the company will
appeal.
   The plant makes herbicides and industrial chemicals. White said
she and her co-workers were assigned to handle corrosive chemicals
and needed gloves and goggles before beginning the job.

   Mikhail S. Gorbachev urged lawmakers today to
approve his plan for a Western-style presidential system after
several of them balked at the idea, calling it premature and vague.
   Members of the Supreme Soviet, the national legislature that
resumed its session after a two-month break, raucously debated the
leadership's proposal to call an emergency session of their parent
body to broaden presidential powers.
   An adviser to Gorbachev said he expects the new president to be
elected within a month by the larger legislature, the Congress of
People's deputies.
   The 58-year-old Kremlin chief took the floor at the end of the
debate and delivered an angry attack on his critics.
   ``Unless democracy is strengthened and insured by corresponding
mechanisms, democracy will perish and we'll lose,'' Gorbachev told
the 434 members of the legislature.
   Referring to the government's former repressive policies, he
said the victors will be forces who want ``to tighten the screws
even tighter than they were earlier.''
   Some people, Gorbachev said, are proposing the Soviet Union
follow the ``Romanian version'' and are ``equating Gorbachev with
Ceausescu.'' He was referring to Nicolae Ceausescu, the Romanian
dictator executed in December after he was ousted in a popular,
pro-democracy revolution.
   Gorbachev did not make clear whether he meant reformers or
hard-liners were suggesting the ``Romanian version.''
   Vice President Anatoly I. Lukyanov recommended to the Supreme
Soviet earlier today that it call the 2,250-member Congress of
People's Deputies into session on Feb. 27 to strengthen the
presidency.
   A total of 160 legislators voted against Gorbachev's suggestion
to shut off debate on whether to hold the congress session, but it
passed with 241 yes votes. The Supreme Soviet then voted 304-95,
with 34 abstentions, to place the issue on its agenda, meaning it
will return to the issue.
   A European-style presidency would strengthen Gorbachev's
government powers while further weakening the control of the
Communist Party apparatus.
   The call for a special session of Congress follows by one week
the party's historic decision to end its 72-year monopoly on power
and lift the strict Marxist prohibition on private ownership of
factories.
   Gorbachev adviser Georgy Shakhnazarov told reporters during a
break in today's session that officials want the Congress to elect
the new president within a month.
   Presidents in the future should be elected by direct, popular
vote, Shakhnazarov said. The president should serve the same
five-year term as the Congress, which was elected almost a year
ago, he said.
   Gorbachev is likely to be a candidate for the new presidency,
but for the second time in a week he spoke cautiously about whether
he will run.
   ``If we proceed to take a decision on the presidency, we will
decide there will be alternative candidates. I don't know if I will
be among the alternatives,'' Gorbachev said.
   He told the Supreme Soviet he had been opposed to presidential
power but added: ``Life demanded changes. I think we've reached the
point when we must take such a decision.''
   Creation of a presidency is among 50 items on the agenda for the
Supreme Soviet session, which Lukyanov said is scheduled to end in
late April. Other topics include laws on land and property
ownership, taxes, economic reform and secession.
   The legislature is also slated to debate the ethnic violence
involving Armenians and Azerbaijanis and the consequences of the
1986 Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident.
   A half-dozen speakers today criticized the proposal for creating
a presidency now.
   Vladimir I. Kirilov, a deputy from the Russian city of Voronezh,
said that before discussing the presidency, the leadership should
abolish the domineering role of the Communist Party in the army and
KGB security police.
   Anatoly Sobchak, a prominent liberal from Leningrad, said
increasing the powers of the executive branch would decrease the
powers of the legislature, and he opposed that.
   A legislative opposition group, the Inter-Regional Deputies
Group, circulated a petition in the corridors outside the session,
calling for the president to be directly elected by the people.
Voters should hold secret ballots and have a choice of candidates
from multiple parties, it said.
   The petition, read on the floor of the Supreme Soviet by deputy
Sergei Stankevich, also called for the selection of a new
presidency to be delayed until new legislatures in the 15 Soviet
republics, to be elected this spring, consider the powers of the
presidency.
   The Supreme Soviet session was punctuated by worries about the
ethnic violence plaguing the Soviet Union that erupted in a new
republic, Tadzhikistan, this week.
   One deputy took a microphone at the Kremlin meeting to demand
that all the 434 deputies present stand in memory of approximately
250 people killed in ethnic violence in Armenia, Azerbaijan and
Tadzhikistan in the past month.
   Gorbachev, addressing the legislators, defended the use of
soldiers to stop ethnic violence.
   ``We must do everything to put out the fire,'' he said.

<HEAD>Analysts Say Latest Capital-Gains Proposal Even More Beneficial to
Wealthy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congressional analysts said Wednesday that the
new capital-gains tax cut proposed by President Bush is tilted even
more toward the wealthy than an earlier version, although it would
do less to worsen the budget deficit.
   More than 83 percent of the direct benefit of the tax cut would
go to those with incomes over $100,000 a year, according to a study
by the non-partisan staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation.
   The same staff estimated that 79.7 percent of the benefit from
the cut Bush recommended last year would have gone to that
upper-income group.
   Last year's bill would have delivered 1 percent of the tax
reduction to those with incomes under $20,000; this year's version
earmarks 0.4 percent for that group.
   The congressional staff report differs sharply from Treasury
Department estimates of how a capital-gains cut would affect the
federal deficit.
   Treasury projected the cut would raise tax collections every
year, and by $12.5 billion in the 1990-95 period. The Joint
Committee report forecast annual revenue losses after the first two
years and losses totaling $11.4 billion over 1990-95.
   The committee had foreseen a $24.2 billion loss over six years
from the bill that Bush backed a year ago.
   Capital gains are profits from the sale of stock, real estate
and other investments. They are fully taxed at the same rates that
apply to wages and other income.
   Bush has made cutting the tax on capital gains a top priority,
contending such a reduction is needed to keep the economy growing.
   Under his proposal, only 70 percent of the profits from the sale
of property owned three years or longer would be taxed; 80 percent
of gains from two-year property and 90 percent from one-year
property would be taxed.
   Democratic leaders of Congress use three arguments to oppose a
capital-gains cut: Most of the benefits would go to the wealthy; it
would worsen the budget deficit; and it would lead to the undoing
of the 1986 tax overhaul, which ended preferential treatment of
capital gains.
   The administration has never denied that the wealthiest
taxpayers would be the biggest benficiaries from a capital-gains
reduction, although spokesmen prefer to cite estimates that make
the point less dramatically than those from the Joint Committee
staff. The administration disagrees that a reduction would start
the unraveling of the landmark 1986 tax law.
   On the deficit question, the Treasury Department contends that a
capital-gains cut would be such a shot in the arm for investment
that the economy would boom, generating more than enough revenue to
pay for the tax cut.
   The new congressional report, signed by Ronald A. Pearlman,
chief of staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation, agrees with the
administration that cutting the capital gains tax likely would
induce taxpayers to sell long-held assets in the short run.
   However, Pearlman wrote, ``it is out best judgment that the
long-run behavorial response will be insufficient to produce a
long-run positive revenue effect.''
   Although the committee staff said there was insufficient
information on which to base long-term revenue projections, ``we
believe those losses will continue for years beyond 1995.'' If the
economy continues to expand, revenue losses would be expected to
grow each year after 1995, Pearlman said.
   The congressional report estimates that over a one-year period,
Bush's proposal would give a $15.9 billion tax cut to 10.76 million
taxpayers, for an average reduction of $1,481.
   People with incomes over $75,000 a year, who file about 3
percent of all tax returns, would get 88 percent of the tax
reduction. Their tax cuts would average $4,729.
   At the lower end of the economic scale, those with incomes under
$20,000, who file more than half of all tax returns, would get 0.4
percent of the tax reduction. Only 697,000 of those 55 million-plus
taxpayers would be expected to have any capital gains; their tax
reduction would average $86.
   In making these calculations, the congressional staff used a
broad definition of income, which includes some items that are not
taxed. Those include tax-exempt interest, employer-paid health and
life insurance and non-taxable Social Security benefits.

<HEAD>Voyager 1 Appears Successful in Snapping Family Portrait of
Planets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PASADENA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Voyager 1 spacecraft sent radio
signals to Earth today indicating it successfully snapped pictures
of most of the planets to create the first family portrait of the
solar system, NASA said.
   ``Engineering data we received show the proper commands were
executed. It looks like the pictures were taken properly,'' said
Mary Hardin, a spokeswoman for the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   Voyager 1, which photographed Jupiter in 1980 and Saturn in
1981, was ordered to snap the photographs between 5:12 p.m. and
9:20 p.m. PST Tuesday, but it took five hours and 36 minutes for
signals confirming the commands were executed to travel the 3.7
billion miles to Earth, Hardin said.
   The space probe took the pictures from a vantage point 32
degrees above the plane extending from the sun's equator. The
planets orbit the sun roughly within that plane.
   Because no other spacecraft has been in such a position or will
be there within coming decades, ``this is probably the first time
and last time in our lifetimes we'll be able to take such a
picture,'' Hardin said. ``It's historic. It will give us a
perspective on our world and universe we've never had before.''
   NASA officials have said that when the photographs are assembled
into a montage for display on a wall, the planets will appear only
as tiny dots separated by vast empty spaces and spreading ovr 100
feet or more.
   Instructions to take the pictures were transmitted to the
spacecraft's computer on Jan. 15, with more detailed orders issued
Feb. 2.
   Because of other demands on NASA Deep Space Tracking Antennas,
the photos won't be sent back to Earth until late March. It will be
late April before the images can be processed.
   The sun and seven of the solar system's nine planets are
expected to appear as points of light against a starry backdrop,
JPL officials said.
   Mercury, the innermost planet, will be too close to the sun to
be distinguished by Voyager's cameras and Pluto is too far away and
too small to show up in images.

   The president of a housing investment and
management company suspended by HUD Secretary Jack Kemp today
accused Kemp of a ``scandalous vendetta'' that has forced the
company to seek to transfer its huge portfolio of properties.
   A. Bruce Rozet, president of Associated Financial Corp., renewed
his charge that Department of Housing and Urban Development
sanctions against AFC and more than 40 affiliates were without
merit. He launched a scathing attack on Kemp, whom he said has
allowed the nation's low-income housing stock to decline
dramatically since taking office last year.
   ``In HUD's desperate rush to damage our companies, HUD has, in
fact, hurt the people it claims to be protecting,'' Rozet said at a
news conference.
   He contended that Kemp has been afraid to take any action at HUD
for fear his administration will become enveloped in accusations of
mismanagment and scandal like those that have dogged his
predecessor, Samuel Pierce.
   Kemp, in a statement, said HUD stood by the suspension. ``The
facts are provable and they will be decided in a court of law,'' he
said.
   But Rozet said Kemp's actions against his companies were
designed to mask his and the agency's failures.
   ``We have now become caught up in a political campaign to divert
attention from a continuing national housing policy of benign
neglect in the name of HUD reform,'' said Rozet, who says his role
as a Democratic fund-raiser made him an attractive target for Kemp.
   ``Rhetoric and good intentions make good politics and even good
press, but they do not house people,'' Rozet said. ``Congress and
the American people will soon realize that the emperor has no
clothes.''
   Rozet said his company planned to fight the suspension through
HUD administrative appeals and the courts. Meanwhile, he said, it
was negotiating with several groups to take over its portfolio of
some 350 HUD-backed housing developments nationwide, with a total
of 45,000 units.
   Questioned by reporters, Rozet said his company would not
receive any money but was simply seeking to find another housing
management firm to take over 300 of the 350 properties.
   ``It's not a question of money. It's a question of housing,''
Rozet said. ``If HUD won't do business with me, I have to find
somebody else that they will deal with or the tenants will just sit
there and suffer.''
   And despite his attack on Kemp for issuing the suspension, Rozet
said he shared many of the secretary's housing goals and believed
the HUD staff had misled Kemp about AFC's performance.
   In its suspension letter, which was directed at an AFC
affiliate, Housing Resources Management, HUD accused the company of
requesting subsidies for several vacant units at a Oklahoma project
and of misuing repair and security deposit accounts at several
developments.
   In a detailed response, Rozet said the subsidies were request
before the two units became vacant and the overpayment was
appropriately reported to HUD. He also said the business had
reported and accounted for all of the questioned spending and
blamed slow HUD processing for many of the disputes.
   In any event, he said, the disputes were routine for large
developments and that it was unprecedented for HUD to levy a
suspension in such cases.
   The suspension only keeps the company from new HUD business.
However, Rozet said it had crippled the company's existing
portfolio as well because Kemp has ordered that even the most
routine HUD decisions regarding AFC properties be made at
department headquarters instead of by the agency's area offices,
which normally handle most transactions.
   ``HUD is thereby condemning low-income, inner-city tenants to
live in rapidly deteriorating conditions while HUD slowly revises
its procedures and continues an unwarranted assault on us,'' Rozet
said. ``The tenants are being made the victims while HUD carries
out it scandalous vendetta against our company.''
   Rozet said he has decided to explore the transfer of AFC's HUD
portfolio because stalling by the department likely will hurt the
properties and he does not want to be around for the agency ``to
use us as a scapegoat.''
   The HUD suspension, which could lead to an outright ban on all
government work, was issued late last month _ a week before AFC was
to receive a hearing on lesser sanctions affecting its operations
in Oklahoma and the District of Columbia.
   Rozet contended the suspension was issued so that HUD would have
grounds to cancel the hearing. ``HUD has become the accuser, the
judge the jury and executioner _ all before we have a chance to
tell our side of the story,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   The famed department store Harrods, which has sold
fur coats to the rich and famous for nearly a century, is closing
its fur salon because of a sharp drop in sales.
   The store said Wednesday sales have dropped by 40 percent over
the last four years. The salon, whose concession is held by fur
retailer Grosvenor Canada, will close on April 21.
   Store officials denied caving in to animal rights groups.
   Thirteen months ago, Harrods' parent company, House of Fraser
PLC, decided to end fur sales at its other 62 stores following
firebomb attacks on House of Fraser stores that were blamed on
animal rights groups.
   Harrods said it would begin closing the salon with a sale
beginning Friday at prices slashed by up to three-quarters. But it
will not be the last time furs are sold at Harrods, according to
store spokesman Andrew Wiles.
   ``There's no doubt we will sell furs again, but not in the same
way. It will be in a smaller, more specialized way. There's a
chance we might consider selling designer furs,'' Wiles said.

<TEXT>
   An inmate who escaped from a
maximum-security prison was captured today after a tow truck
operator who gave the man a place to sleep for the night recognized
him from news reports, state police said.
   Four other inmates, including three convicted murderers, who
escaped from the Joliet Correctional Center on Sunday are still at
large.
   Terry W. Colburn, 21, of Bloomington apparently was picked up by
a motorist late Tuesday while hitchhiking along a Chicago
expressway in freezing rain, said Capt. Dan McDevitt. The motorist,
whom police would not identify, took Colburn to a friend's tow
truck operation in suburban Calumet Park, where the hitchhiker
could spend the night.
   Lonnie Bramlett Jr., owner of Airline Towing, said he suspected
nothing when his friend arrived with the cold and wet stranger, but
later at home, after watching television accounts and reading
newspaper reports of the escape, he became convinced the stranger
was one of the fugitives.
   He called Airline Towing to warn the dispatcher, then called
state police. Colburn, who was serving a term for burglary, was
arrested without incident at 12:45 a.m. He was not armed, McDevitt
said.
   Colburn was questioned as he was returned to Joliet to see if he
had any information on the whereabouts of the other escapees, said
prisons spokesman Nic Howell.
   Colburn was one of six inmates who escaped from the prison 40
miles southwest of Chicago early Sunday. The prisoners sawed
through steel bars, then scaled a fence, investigators said. One
prisoner was captured the same day.
   State prison officials said Tuesday five guards are under
investigation. Corrections Director Kenneth McGinnis said the
guards were at least negligent and all have been removed from the
discipline-segregation unit, where the prisoners were held at the
time of their escape.
   The inmates' absence went unnoticed during at least five routine
checks between 11 p.m. Saturday and 7 a.m. Sunday, McGinnis said.
   Still at large were:
   _Daniel Johnson, 24, of Burns, Tenn., imprisoned for murder.
   _James F. Allen, 40, of Chicago, imprisoned for three murders.
   _Dave Rodriguez, 21, of Chicago, imprisoned for murder.
   _Ronald Roach, in his 20s, of Wyoming, Ill., imprisoned for
burglary.

<HEAD>Business Inventories Fall for First Time in More Than a Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Business inventories fell in December for the
first time in more than a year while sales remained unchanged, the
government said Wednesday.
   ``It's a reflection that the economy has slowed down,'' said
Thomas Runiewicz, an economist with the WEFA Group in Bala Cynwyd,
Pa. ``It slowed during the fourth quarter and we expect it to
remain slow until the summer.''
   The Commerce Department said inventories were down 0.2 percent
to a seasonally adjusted $795.2 billion after rising 0.5 percent in
November and 0.3 percent in October.
   It was the first decline since a 0.1 percent drop in October
1988 and the largest since inventories slipped 0.6 percent in
December 1986.
   At the same time, sales were flat at a seasonally adjusted
$522.5 billion. November sales were revised downward from a 0.7
percent to a 0.4 percent gain. Sales fell 0.5 percent in October.
   Runiewicz said the fact that inventories fell at the same time
sales were flat means businesses were cutting back on production.
But he and other analysts agreed that while the economy is weak, it
is not nearing a recession.
   ``It would take a significant decline in sales to tip the
balance of economic activity in a negative direction,'' said
Richard W. Rahn, chief economist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
``But government reports on retail sales yesterday already suggest
that such a decline is not in the cards.''
   The Commerce Department reported Tuesday that retail sales,
which represent a third of the nation's economic activity, jumped
1.6 percent in January.
   The December business activity produced a slight decline, to
1.52, in the ratio of inventories to sales. That means it would
take 1.52 months to exhaust inventories at the December pace. The
ratio was 1.53 in both October and November.
   ``On the whole, inventories are in pretty good shape,'' said
Evelina Tainer, an economist with the First National Bank of
Chicago. ``It suggests that, even though the economy is sluggish,
we shouldn't need much of a correction in the near term.''
   If inventories were to pile up excessively, it could mean severe
cutbacks in production and a loss of jobs _ a situation already
found in the automobile industry.
   Chrysler Corp., Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Corp. all
experienced temporary layoffs in January to reduce the number of
vehicles on backlots.
   Retail backlogs dropped 0.1 percent in December, but sales fell
further, down 0.2 percent.
   Both inventories and sales at the manufacturing level, which
represent about 45 percent of the total, slid 0.4 percent.
   Wholesalers' inventories were down 0.2 percent, while their
sales rose 1.1 percent.

   Things have been pretty lively around
the veterans home since Terri Pohrman, a transsexual Brigitte
Nielsen-lookalike, starting running for mayor in tights under the
banner ``The Change Will Do You Good.''
   The former Las Vegas show girl was a regular entertainer at the
California Veterans' Home before she entered the race, but the
stakes have gone up because more than 700 of the 1,800 registered
voters in this wine-country town live there.
   The big-shouldered blonde with spiky hair faces two opponents in
the April 10 election. She wants an additional 500 residents of the
home to register to vote. In the 1988 Yountville elections, only
535 people bothered to vote.
   Pohrman visited the home last weekend wearing roller skates and
a tight body stocking with huge red cardboard hearts over her front
and back. Later, she donned a red sequined cocktail dress with a
plunging neckline.
   ``All the guys got a big kick out of her,'' said Gene Sockness,
61. ``She's really welcome up here and shows us a good time. So
what the heck, live and let live.''
   Pohrman's ambitions have panicked some residents of this
conservative town of 3,200, situated in the Napa Valley about 40
miles from San Francisco.
   ``I'm very serious about this,'' said Pohrman, 37, a costume
jewelry saleswoman who calls herself ``Miss Terri.''
   ``I'm going to be mayor and these people are scared,'' she said.
``They think I'll open a bunch of massage parlors and adult
bookstores.''
   Pohrman moved to Yountville two years ago. A native of Portland,
Ore., Pohrman was a teen-age female impersonator before having a
sex change operation in San Francisco in the 1970s.
   She opened a jewelry and dress shop and hit the road last year
as a sales representative. She first entered politics after the
town's design review committee questioned the appropriateness of
the advertising on her boutique.
   City Manager Bob Myers says she violated city ordinances by
placing colored, plastic flags around her shop and in the trees.
She also had flashing neon lights and a sandwich board sign not
allowed under local codes. The name of her shop was Such a Deal.
   Pohrman said she wants to bring the town together as ``one big
family,'' and takes innovative stands on issues. On flood control,
for instance, she says the first thing she'd do is buy pink
lifeboats for everyone.
   ``She's flamboyant for up here, but maybe not by San Francisco
standards,'' said 60-year-old veteran Walter Allen, who lives at
the veterans home.
   Pohrman's critics include Carlee Leftwich, the mayor pro-tem and
a six-year council veteran who is running against Pohrman.
   ``Anyone who assumes that because the veterans are elderly and
have health problems that they are also stupid, is making a
terrible mistake,'' said Leftwich. ``I would never attempt to
garner their votes by entertaining them.''
   Richard Kessler, a 65-year-old resident of the home, said of
Pohrman: ``She's trying to work the vet's home for votes. To me she
is nothing but a burlesque queen. A lot of these old senile vets
are taken in by her.''
   But Pohrman's conscience is clear: ``I love those people,'' she
said.

   The prosecution's star witness in the
Joseph Hazelwood trial said today the tanker Exxon Valdez's
autopilot was turned off long before a crucial maneuver and had
nothing to do with the ship's grounding.
   Third mate Gregory Cousins also said he is convinced that had
the helmsman on the ship followed his orders, the tanker would have
missed a rocky reef by several miles.
   The testimony came during cross-examination by Hazelwood's
lawyer, who sought to show that all the procedures aboard the
tanker were moving smoothly until the helmsman failed to execute a
10-degree right turn.
   ``Mr. Cousins, isn't it correct that in your mind there's no
doubt that if that 10-degree right rudder had been executed, the
ship would have cleared Bligh Reef by a substantial margin?'' asked
attorney Dick Madson.
   ``That's my belief,'' Cousins said.
   He also corroborated the defense contention that the autopilot
had been turned on for only a brief time and definitely was
disengaged before the grounding and unrelated to it.
   Cousins testified earlier that Hazelwood left the helm of the
Exxon Valdez in the hands of an uncertain seaman who misunderstood
orders and plowed the tanker into a reef.
   Cousins, who was deputized by Hazelwood to take command of the
tanker for about 10 minutes before it went aground, suggested the
helmsman, Robert Kagan, caused the nation's worst oil spill by not
following orders to turn the wheel hard.
   ``I think Mr. Kagan didn't really understand the command,''
Cousins said Tuesday. ``He hesitated.''
   Kagan conceded in earlier testimony that he had been ``timid''
about steering since an occasion in which he was reprimanded for
oversteering a vessel. But he insisted he followed all orders
aboard the Exxon Valdez.
   Cousins indirectly blamed Hazelwood for leaving him in charge
with only Kagan to steer. Hazelwood left the bridge about 10
minutes before the disaster, giving Cousins orders to divert the
tanker from normal shipping lanes to avoid ice, Cousins said.
   ``He asked if I felt comfortable with what we were going to do
and I said, `Yes,''' Cousins testified. ``He said, `Do you feel
comfortable enough that I can go below and get rid of some
paperwork?' I said I felt very comfortable.''
   Hazelwood promised to be gone ``just a few minutes'' and said to
call him when the ship started to make a turn, Cousins told the
Superior Court jury.
   But during a day of questioning by Assistant District Attorney
Brent Cole, Cousins indicated Hazelwood never gave him specific
steering directions. As a result, he wound up racing between the
chart room and the radar screen trying to work out the proper
maneuver, Cousins said.
   This left him no time to keep an eye on Kagan, who was steering
_ a job that Cousins described as extremely simple but critical.
   ``Seconds can make a difference,'' Cousins said.
   Hazelwood, 43, of Huntington, N.Y., is charged with one felony
count of second-degree criminal mischief and misdemeanor charges of
reckless endangerment, negligent discharge of oil and operating a
vessel while intoxicated. The maximum penalty for conviction on all
counts is 7\ years in prison and $61,000 in fines.
   His lawyers contend he left clear instructions for the ice
diversion maneuver and that if his instructions had been followed
the ship would have moved smoothly past Bligh Reef. Hazelwood was
fired by Exxon after the spill.
   Cousins, 39, a veteran seaman, said he was on the phone with
Hazelwood at the moment the Exxon Valdez went aground in the early
morning hours of March 24. The vessel spilled more than 10 million
gallons of Alaska crude oil into the clear waters of Prince William
Sound.
   Cousins said he had begun to realize that Kagan wasn't following
his orders to make hard turns in the ship's course. After giving
another order to Kagan to turn harder, Cousins said he phoned the
captain in his office _ a conversation interrupted by the crash.
   ``I told him that we were getting into serious trouble,''
Cousins recalled. ``He asked, `Where's the rudder? ...' That was
when we suffered the first shock and we were hard aground.''
   He said he and Hazelwood stopped talking: ``There was nothing
else to say. There was a mutual hangup of the telephones.''
   Cousins also offered a damaging version of Hazelwood's actions
after the grounding, saying he thought the captain was trying to
move the 987-foot tanker off the rocks. Other witnesses have said
that maneuver could have capsized the vessel, causing a worse spill
and potential loss of life.
   Hazelwood ordered the engines turned off 10 minutes after the
grounding but later ordered them turned back on and gave orders to
move forward, Cousins said.
   Hazelwood's lawyers contend that he restarted the engines to
stabilize the ship on the reef. But Cousins said that when
Hazelwood finally gave up and killed the engines, he declared, ``
`We're definitely not going anywhere.'''

   Jane Fonda paid a surprise visit, incognito,
to two of East Germany's most polluted cities to voice her support
for environmentalists there.
   Fonda said she went to see Europe's ``dirtiest and most
polluted'' cities for herself, the official East German news agency
ADN quoted her as saying Wednesday.
   The Oscar-winning actress, well known for her political
activism, disguised herself during the visit with a pair of
sunglasses, ADN said.
   Fonda visited Bitterfeld and Wolfen in the heart of East
Germany's main industrial area, about 75 miles from Berlin.
   Scientists have said the area, with huge chemical plants and
coal-fired power plants, is one of the most dangerously polluted in
Europe.

   Paine College officials were caught off
guard when actor Danny Glover announced he will set up a $100,000
endowment at the school from which his mother graduated.
   ``We did not expect this magnanimity,'' President Julius S.
Scott said this week, calling the gift an indication of Glover's
``character and love of family.''
   Glover, star of such movies as ``Lethal Weapon'' and ``The Color
Purple,'' announced the endowment in honor of Carrie Hunley Glover
when he spoke at the college's Founders Day convocation and
received an honorary degree Friday.
   Paine College is a private, predominantly black school
established in 1882. Mrs. Glover, who earned a bachelor's degree in
science and home economics in 1942, was the first college graduate
in her family.

   A music professor says he believes Stevie
Wonder may have copied his Oscar-winning hit ``I Just Called to Say
I Love You'' from another songwriter's tune without realizing it.
   Milton Stern, a professor from California State University, Los
Angeles, testified Tuesday in a $25 million copyright-infringement
suit filed against Wonder by sonwriter Lloyd Chiate 1985.
   Stern said the hit was ``extraordinarily similar'' to a song
Chiate wrote with Lee Garrett. ``One is based on the other,'' he
said. ``One is a progression.''
   Chiate, 40, has testified he wrote the song ``I Just Called to
Say'' in 1976 and the following year played a tape of it for
Wonder. He did not register the song until 1979.
   Wonder, 39, has testified that he began writing his song in 1976
and completed it in 1984.

   Singing has always been Hovie Lister's stock in
trade, but the gospel artist likes politics enough to spend his
winter days opening doors for Georgia senators.
   Lister, 64, who sang at the funerals of Hank Williams and Elvis
Presley, is an assistant doorkeeper for the Senate this year, a job
he sought from music fan Zell Miller, the lieutenant governor. It
pays about $1,800 per session.
   ``I just love politics,'' Lister said.
   The Statesmen Quartet, started by the Baptist minister in 1948,
has been cited as Presley's favorite gospel group and a major
influence on him.
   Flamboyant by gospel standards, Lister and his Statesmen were
regulars at all-night gospel sings all over the Southeast and on
Atlanta radio and television.

   Spike Lee says the strides made during
the civil rights movement are being eroded and that it's his job as
a filmmaker to portray ``the present state of racism today.''
   Lee, who addressed more than 1,200 people at the University of
Iowa on Tuesday, said racial violence in the Howard Beach section
of New York City compelled him to make his 1989 film ``Do The Right
Thing,'' about racial tension and violence during a hot city summer.
   ``In a lot of ways this country is going backward instead of
forward, especially with all the whole ... affirmative action and
all that stuff that people were dying for in the civil rights
movement,'' the black filmmaker said.
   ``I wanted to film about the present state of racism today. I
knew I don't have the answers, but that wasn't my job,'' Lee said.
``What my job was to hold the mirror up and let people know that
this is the way it is and unless we all make an effort to do
something about it, it's going to get worse.''

   It's out of the recording studios and
into the docket for the rock group Boston, whose leader is the
defendant in a $20 million breach-of-contract lawsuit by CBS
records.
   In opening arguments Tuesday, Don Engel, an attorney for band
leader Tom Scholz, said the company bullied his client, illegally
suspended his royalties and could not, or would not, understand
Scholz's artistic difficulties.
   CBS charged that Scholz refused to produce albums ``not because
he couldn't do his job, but because he wouldn't do his job.''
   The $20 million lawsuit, originally filed in 1983 against the
entire band, charged the band with failing to deliver the number of
albums agreed to under their 1976, $5 million contract with CBS.
Allegations against other band members were thrown out.
   The heart of the suit is a dispute over royalties that led
Boston to switch from CBS to MCA Records, which is also named in
the suit. The group's first two albums, ``Boston'' and ``Don't Look
Back,'' were platinum sellers for CBS.

School students loved the show all the same.
   Particularly when the five Russian rockers, on a 2{-month tour,
talked about the bad old days when they honed heavy metal in their

   ``Officials never liked what we were doing, our music, our hair,
the guitar music,'' said Alexie Belov, lead singer of Gorky Park,
which headlined last summer's Moscow Peace Festival with U.S. bands
such as Bon Jovi and Motley Crue. ``Finally they said ... you

   It didn't stop them.
   ``We had to play really wild underground clubs with bullet holes
in the walls and sometimes the customers would come in and shoot,''
Belov said Tuesday.

   The U.S.-Soviet agreement on troop reductions
in Europe gives President Bush the 30,000 edge in soldiers he wants
and pushes NATO and the Warsaw Pact closer to a 23-nation treaty.
   The terms brought home Tuesday night by Secretary of State James
A. Baker III from an ``Open Skies'' conference in Ottawa, Canada,
will limit the two superpowers to 195,000 soldiers each in Central
Europe.
   That will be the maximum for the Soviets on foreign soil from
the Atlantic Ocean to the Ural Mountains _ the vast expanse of
Europe.
   But the United States will be permitted to station 30,000 troops
in Britain, Italy, Turkey, Greece and Spain.
   ``This is an important breakthrough which removes a major
obstacle to the early conclusion of a CFE (Convention Forces in
Europe) treaty, and it also established the principle that U.S.
forces in Europe are not to be treated as equivalent to Soviet
forces in Eastern Europe,'' Bush said today.
   ``Now, let's close the deal. That's what I want to do. Conclude
this CFE agreement and get it done and signed,'' the president
said. ``There's still some technical problems.''
   He also hailed a separate agreement to speed German
reunification. The four powers that defeated Hitler in World War II
have agreed to meet with leaders of the two Germanys to lay the
groundwork for unification.
   Bush spoke after receiving a briefing from Baker, who had helped
negotiate the latest breakthroughs in meetings in Moscow and then
in Ottawa with foreign secretaries from NATO and Warsaw Pact
nations.
   The argument Baker used in negotiations with Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze was that the Soviets could get
reinforcements to Europe much more quickly than the United States
could from across the Atlantic Ocean.
   So an imbalance of 30,000 was allowed the U.S. side, as Bush
proposed in his State of the Union speech Jan. 31.
   The slight concession made by Baker was to agree that 30,000 was
an absolute cap.
   All 16 North Atlantic Treaty Organization and seven Warsaw Pact
members endorsed the agreement on troops. Joseph Clark, the
minister of external affairs for Canada, said, ``It overcomes one
of the most difficult obstacles'' to the treaty the two alliances
are negotiating in Vienna.
   But wide differences remain on combat aircraft. Baker, in a
speech to the Ottawa conference on Monday, accused the Soviets of
trying to lock in an advantage of 2,000 combat aircraft over NATO.
   U.S. officials said there could be a decision to exclude
aircraft from the weapons to be covered by the treaty. But, for the
time being, the agreement on troop reductions does not make
completion of the treaty automatic.
   Other conventional weapons to be limited include tanks, armored
personnel carriers and helicopters.
   Clark's announcement in a conference hall _ with Baker,
Shevardnadze and the other ministers on hand _ came as a surprise.
   Only last Friday in Moscow, Gorbachev countered Bush's proposal
with two options: either a 225,000 or 195,000 ceiling, but no
sub-limit for Central Europe.
   That is where most Soviet troops in Europe are now based, with
about 380,000 in East Germany alone.
   But the Bush administration prevailed, and Shevardnadze after
four meetings with Baker essentially accepted Bush's approach,
imbalance and all.
   Some 400,000 Soviet troops would have to withdraw, while about
80,000 American soldiers would return home.
   As it is, the Soviets are under pressure from their allies to
pull back. Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland all are demanding
withdrawal.
   And East Germany is on a fast track to unification with West
Germany. A framework for merger was approved in Ottawa by the
United States, the Soviet Union, Britain, France, West Germany and
East Germany.
   The issue of Soviet troops in East Germany was not addressed,
but unification could require a Soviet pullout there as well. In
fact, the Soviets may find themselves under the 195,000 ceiling.
   The United States now has about 305,000 troops in Europe, of
which about 275,000 are on the central front _ mostly West Germany
_ and 30,000, generally in Navy and Air Force units, in Greece,
Turkey, Italy, Spain and Britain.
   Shevardnadze, in a brief exchange with reporters after Clark's
announcement, sidestepped whether Gorbachev had yielded to Bush.
   The Soviet foreign minister said Gorbachev had never rejected
Bush's proposal. ``He did not say he would not agree to that,''
Shevardnadze said.
   The foreign minister, with a twinkle, quipped: ``Are you
disappointed?''
   The agreement on troop limitations capped a series of
breakthroughs during Baker's nine days in Europe and Canada.
   In Moscow, he and Soviet officials resolved several key issues
that stood in the way of a treaty to reduce long-range missiles,
bombers and submarines by 30 to 50 percent.
   Sea-launched cruises missiles were separated from the emerging
treaty that Bush and Gorbachev intend to sign at their summit
meeting in Washington in June.
   Also, an agreement was worked out for destruction of chemical
weapons stock, also to be signed in June, provided other nations
capable of producing gas agree to an international treaty.

   College students admit they aren't doing much
to protect the environment but the majority believe they can do
something to help, according to a study released Wednesday.
   The National Wildlife Federation, the nation's largest
conservation organization, found in a survey of 500 undergraduates
that only 16 percent considered themselves ``very active'' on
environmental issues and conservation.
   Three percent said they weren't at all active, 32 percent
somewhat inactive and 18 percent somewhat active. Another 32
percent described themselves as neither active nor inactive. The
numbers add up to 101 percent because the percentages were rounded
off, officials said.
   However, 76 percent of those polled said they thought there was
something they personally could do to help protect the environment,
such as not littering, reducing their use of environmentally
harmful products and taking part in environmental organizations.
   ``We are tremendously encouraged by these results,'' said Jay B.
Hair, president of the National Wildlife Federation.
   ``College students are expressing a deep concern for the
environment, and the overwhelming majority are clearly willing to
do something about it.''
   Ninety-four percent of those surveyed said they would be willing
to pay more for products and packaging that are safe for the
environment, and three-quarters said recycling of newspapers, glass
and cans should be required by law in all communities.
   Asked whether people should be willing to sacrifice
environmental quality for economic growth, 42 percent said they
disagreed strongly. Another 28 percent disagreed somewhat, 8
percent agreed strongly, 18 percent agreed somewhat and 4 percent
had no opinion.
   The survey was conducted in November by Hughes Research Corp. of
Rockville, Md. The students, between the ages of 17 and 24, were
enrolled in four-year colleges or universities. About half were men
and half women.
   The federation said that based on the sample size, the survey
results could be considered accurate to within 5 percentage points.

   An Indian Airlines Airbus jet that had
been in use only three months crashed onto a golf course and burned
Wednesday short of a runway in southern India, and 91 of the 146
people on board died, officials said.
   The Airbus-320 grazed a clump of trees on its final approach to
Bangalore airport and caught fire when it hit the ground, about 50
yards from the runway, officials said.
   The flight originated in Bombay, 530 miles northwest of
Bangalore. The officials said 139 passengers and a crew of seven
were on the hour-long flight and at least 55 people survived the
crash, including two Americans, the airline said.
   The plane's tail was intact but its fuselage was shattered and
charred and the nose was smashed across the grassy plain adjacent
to the airport.
   There was no immediate reason given for the cause of the
accident, which occurred about 1 p.m. Airport officials in
Bangalore, contacted by telephone, said the weather was clear and
there were no indications of an emergency on board.
   The aircraft was among a fleet of 14 Airbus-320s purchased by
Indian Airlines last year at a cost of $38 million per plane from
Airbus Industrie, the European consortium that manufactures the
plane.
   The jet that crashed entered the fleet in December and had flown
from Bombay to the nearby city of Goa and back earlier Wednesday,
the airline said.
   It was the first crash of an Airbus-320 in regular commercial
service. An Airbus-320 carrying passengers crashed June 26, 1988 at
an air show in eastern France, killing three people and injuring
50. The plane was on a demonstration flight and flew too low and
slowly over an airfield, hitting some trees.
   The Airbus-320 is the first civilian airliner with a fully
computerized flight system, which manufacturers say allow for safer
operation.
   Instead of the old control column in front of the pilot, there
is a ``pistol-grip'' side stick linked to five computers that
modify and relay the pilot's directions to wing and tail flaps. A
mechanical cable link to the tail allows the pilot to fly manually
in emergencies.
   Aviation Minister Arif Mohammed Khan flew to Bangalore to
inspect the crash site and ordered an inquiry into the accident,
the second-worst in the history of Indian Airlines. He also
announced compensation of about $30,000 to the families next of kin
of the dead.
   Airbus Industrie also planned to send a team to India.
   An airline spokesman in New Delhi said there were at least 17
foreigners on the flight, including two Americans, a Frenchman, two
Canadians, three Japanese and a Hong Kong man, all of whom survived.
   Information about the others will take some time to gather, the
spokesman said, because nationalities are not included on the
tickets.
   ``My husband's presence of mind helped me to get out of the
aircraft through the back door,'' said Marook Sadhwa, a 29-year-old
Canadian who was being treated for burns. ``As soon as we came out,
we ran for a few yards and there were two or three minor
explosions.''
   The crash is the latest in a series of mishaps that have earned
Indian Airlines the reputation of being one of the worst-managed
air carriers in the world.
   Poor morale among the staff has led to frequent strikes, and
delays are also frequent. Employees allege that pre-flight safety
precautions are often ignored and planes are allowed to fly even if
major snags are detected.
   The last Indian Airlines crash occurred Oct. 19, 1988, when a
Boeing 737 crashed on final approach in the western city of
Ahmedabad, killing 113 people. A subsequent inquiry blamed pilot
error for the crash, the worst in the airline's 27-year history.
   The twin-engined, narrow-bodied Airbus consumes 40 percent less
fuel than similar planes and has been making inroads into the
medium-range market, long dominated by Boeing and McDonnell Douglas.
   According to one publication, Science Report, the aircraft
technology includes a pre-programmed software system ``that tells
the computer _ and not the pilot _ to make judgments.''
   The software system ``has the authority to forbid the pilot to
take the actions he needs to'' in an emergency.
   If the pilot wanted to make a sharp turn to avoid a collision,
the report said, the system ``will not let the airplane respond
beyond a certain rate.''

told his publicist when she called him at 5:35 a.m. with word of
his ``Driving Miss Daisy'' supporting actor nod. ``Now, I'm going
back to sleep.''
   Most nominees expressed elation. But filmmaker Spike Lee
complained that his ``Do the Right Thing'' deserved more than two
nominations.
   ``In a little way I'm happy, in a little way I'm disappointed,''
said screenplay nominee Lee, whose movie also got a supporting
actor nod for Danny Aiello. ``We got jerked out of best director,
best film, I think my cinematographer did a great job, I think my
editor did a great job. ... I know in my heart that my father, Bill
Lee, deserved a nomination for best score.''
   He ended the telephone interview from New York with, ``We wuz
robbed,'' spelling out ``W-U-Z.''
   Tom Cruise was working on a movie in Florida and Robin Williams
was on location in New York when they learned of their best actor
nominations. Oliver Stone was in Los Angeles casting his next
movie, ``The Doors.''
   Morgan Freeman was on his boat and couldn't be reached for
comment on his best actor nomination for ``Driving Miss Daisy.''
   Kovic, who wrote the ``Born on the Fourth of July'' screenplay
with Oliver Stone and whose life is portrayed in the movie, was
told about the film's eight nominations moments before he boarded a
plane in New York.
   ``I consider it a tremendous honor to be nominated by members of
the academy for best screenplay,'' he said. ``This is truly one of
the happiest and most triumphant moments of my life.''
   Stone's reaction was subdued.
   ``I am very happy that my colleagues have acknowledged `Born on
the Fourth of July' in a year with so many fine films. It's also
most gratifying to know people are seeing it and being moved by
it,'' Stone said.
   Williams was in New York filming ``Awakenings'' with Robert
DeNiro when his publicist telephoned him with news of his best
actor nomination for ``Dead Poets Society.''
   ``I am absolutely thrilled and delighted that the Academy
remembered the director, the screenwriter, the picture and all the
poets,'' the actor said.
   Pauline Collins learned of her ``Shirley Valentine'' best
actress nomination on cable television's CNN broadcast in Madrid.
   ``Isn't it lovely? To me, `Shirley' began as a lovely job to do
in England, and now all this _ it really is quite extraordinary,''
she said.
   Producer Noel Pearson, whose ``My Left Foot'' got five
nominations, including best picture, said from London that he was
stunned.
   The movie's best actor nominee, Day-Lewis, was exhilarated. He
ran out in the street when he heard the news at his agent Julian
Belfrage's office.
   ``He's so thrilled. He's just run out of the building. At the
moment, it's madness in here,'' Pearson said. Day-Lewis couldn't be
corralled for an interview.
   ``I'm ecstatic,'' said Phil Alden Robinson, nominated for his
``Field of Dreams'' screenplay. ``My 40th birthday is in a couple
weeks and this will make turning 40 a little easier.''
   He said the film about reconciliation and renewal on a baseball
field has already delivered its rewards to him.
   ``We got letters from people saying the film had changed their
lives, that it had brought families back together. We couldn't have
asked for more than that,'' he said.

<HEAD>Bush Calls Soviet Acceptance of Troop Cut Proposal Important
Breakthrough</HEAD>

   President Bush today called Soviet acceptance
of his troop cut proposal for Europe ``an important breakthrough''
that removes a major obstacle to a conventional arms treaty.
   Bush, before signing a Panama aid bill, praised Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev for accepting his plan to allow the U.S. and
Soviet armies to keep 195,000 troops each in Central Europe, with
the United States allowed to station 30,000 more troops in Britain,
Italy, Turkey, Greece and Spain.
   ``This is an important breakthrough which removes a major
obstacle to the early conclusion of a CFE (Convention Forces in
Europe) treaty, and it also established the principle that U.S.
forces in Europe are not to be treated as equivalent to Soviet
forces in Eastern Europe,'' said Bush.
   He also hailed a separate agreement to speed German
reunification. The four powers that defeated Hitler in World War II
have agreed to meet with leaders of the two Germanys to lay the
groundwork for unification.
   Bush, who had said Monday that it was too early for a four
powers' meeting on the future of Germany, acknowledged he was
caught by the surprise at which the German unification question has
moved forward.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III, who helped negotiate the
latest breakthroughs in meetings in Ottawa with foreign secretaries
from both NATO and Warsaw Pact nations, was at the president's side.
   ``We and our German allies are in full accord,'' said Bush.
``Things move quite fast there.''
   The foreign ministers of the two German states will meet with
the foreign ministers of the four powers _ the United States, Great
Britain, France and the Soviet Union _ ``to discuss the external
aspects of the establishment of German unity,'' Bush said.
   ``This brings us a a step closer to realizing the longstanding
goal of German unity,'' said Bush, who has insisted that a united
German must belong to NATO.
   ``These steps, along with the inspiring march of democracy in
Eastern Europe, bring within sight the objective that I have
stressed throughout the first year of my presidency: a Europe that
is whole and free,'' said Bush.
   ``Now, let's close the deal. That's what I want to do. Conclude
this CFE agreement and get it done and signed,'' he said. ``There's
still some technical problems.''
   Bush fielded questions from reporters after signing a $42
million aid package to help Panama recover from the effects of the
Noriega dictatorship that was overthrown by a Dec. 20 U.S. invasion.
   Talking about developments in Europe, Bush said, ``We're dealing
with historic change. I mean to be very elated about this.'' He was
criticized last year for not reacting with more emotion to the fall
of the Berlin Wall.
   ``It's very, very fast. The fact that the secretary was able to
close this deal in such a short period of time ... is evidence of
this,'' he said.
   Asked why he thought Gorbachev had acceded to Bush's demands on
the troop cuts, the president said, ``I think he saw that it made
very good sense. ... We've stayed firm on this proposal.''
   ``Events are moving awfully fast there, and I think they see
this as good for them. I hope they see it as a stabilizing
agreement for Europe,'' said Bush.
   Asked if the Warsaw Pact as well as NATO could have a role in a
new Germany, Bush said: ``The allies want the stability of U.S.
forces in Europe ... and a strong NATO. The Eastern European
countries that make up the Warsaw Pact want the Soviets to leave.
They have a different equation.
   ``We are talking about Germany remaining in NATO; flexibility on
where the troops in Germany are, but a strong NATO,'' said Bush.
   ``Changes are going on so fast there that it's hard to keep up
with,'' said Bush.
   ``There's a lot of things happened that happened more quickly
than certainly I would have thought. This troop agreement is one of
them,'' said Bush.
   Asked what had changed between Monday and Tuesday to make it
time for the four powers to meet, Bush said, ``Certainly there was
a feeling on the part of Chancellor (Helmut) Kohl, who told me this
on the phone yesterday, that the agreement that Secretary Baker had
been discussing ... was a very sound step.''
   ``We're not trying to dictate to anybody over there how it would
work,'' said Bush.
   ``I was not aware on Monday that they were going to have a deal
on Tuesday, absolutely not,'' said Bush.
   ``Nor were we in Ottawa,'' Baker said.
   ``There's a lot of diplomacy going on,'' said Bush. ``This
surprised me that they were willing to make an agreement on
(Germany) as it did the troops. I thought it was right to stay firm
on it.''

<HEAD>Mandela Offers Compromise, but Demands Full Voting Rights</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SAHM VENTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SOWETO, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The African National Congress
insists on full black voting rights, but it is open to compromise
on other constitutional issues and to considering guarantees for
whites, Nelson Mandela said Wednesday.
   Mandela, who plans to consult soon with ANC leaders in Zambia,
did not elaborate on what compromises might be reached.
   ``I think it be most presumptuous of me to speak for the ANC,''
he said. ``It is the ANC who would decide what compromises it
should make. ... We are ready for honorable compromises without
surrendering our principles.''
   During a conversation with a small group of reporters, Mandela
was asked whether the ANC was willing to negotiate about its demand
for a one-person, one-vote system, which would lead to black
majority rule.
   ``That is the nature of compromising _ you compromise on
fundamental issues,'' he said, but did not give the impression the
ANC was prepared to alter its position on voting.
   The 71-year-old black leader praised President F.W. de Klerk,
who legalized the ANC two weeks ago and released him from prison
Sunday after 27 years. Because of de Klerk's flexibility and
integrity, he said, ``the possibility of a settlement is always
there.''
   ``Compromises must be made in respect to every issue, as long as
that compromise is in the interest not only of one population
group, but the country as whole,'' Mandela told reporters at his
four-room home, where he slept Tuesday night for the first time
since his imprisonment in 1962.
   Mandela has said since his release that the African National
Congress wants to ease the fears of South Africa's 5 million whites
about domination by the 28 million blacks.
   He has expressed opposition, however, to the government concept
of ``group rights,'' which would give special legal protection to
whites and other minorities.
   ``We are aware of the fears of the whites in the country of
being dominated by blacks, and we are addressing that very
seriously and very earnestly,'' he said Wednesday.
   ``I am convinced that, in discussions between the ANC and the
government, we will be able to find a solution which will be
accepted by everybody, black and white.''
   De Klerk's National Party is committed to negotiating a new
constitution within five years extending political rights to
blacks. Gerrit Viljoen, the constitutional development minister,
conceded Tuesday the resulting government ``is unlikely to have the
National Party in control,''
   In Lusaka, Zambia, the ANC leadership began a two-day meeting
expected to focus on Mandela's future role and a response to de
Klerk's initiatives.
   ANC officials have acknowledged they were caught off guard Feb.
2 when de Klerk lifted a 30-year ban on the guerrilla movement and
made other major concessions in a bid to get negotiations started.
   In recent months, Mandela had met frequently with senior
government officials, including de Klerk, to discuss prospects for
negotiations between them and the ANC.
   ``My optimism has been strengthened'' in those discussions, he
said Wednesday.
   Mandela reaffirmed support for the ANC's guerrilla campaign,
which he helped launch in the early 1960s before receiving a life
prison sentence, and would not apologize for deaths of civilians.
   ``You can't avoid people getting caught up in the cross fire
when two people are shooting at each other,'' he said. ``People
must not only worry about casualties'' caused by the ANC. ``They
must worry about the series of casualties caused by the government
over the decades.''
   Police said Wednesday a new outbreak of fighting between rival
black factions had taken at least 13 lives.
   They said officers using tear gas, rubber bullets and shotguns
were trying to quell unrest at Kwanobuhle near Uitenhage, where
nine of the victims were killed.
   Four deaths were reported in Natal Province, where black
supporters and opponents of the ANC have feuded for three years.
The government said soldiers would be deployed to halt the fighting.
   Mandela has said black factional violence weakens the fight
against apartheid, South Africa's official policy of race
segregation. He told CBS News on Wednesday police appeared
disinterested in halting the bloodshed.
   The area around Mandela's home was relatively quiet Wednesday
after scenes of jubilation when he returned the day before.
   He left briefly to visit Elias Motsoaledi, a colleague who was
tried with him on sabotage charges in 1964 and now is ill. As
Mandela left his friend's house, he urged some children to go to
school so they could become educated and fight apartheid.

<HEAD>Businesses Say Proposed Fines for Corporate Wrongdoers Too Stiff</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Proposed stiffer fines and penalties for
corporate wrongdoers were attacked as too tough Wednesday by
businesses but were endorsed by academics and public interest
representatives who said the sanctions may not go far enough.
   ``The proposed guidelines are extremely harsh, punitive,
unwarranted and will place many businesses on the threshold of
insolvency,'' Earlyn Church, a director of the National Association
of Manufacturers, told the U.S. Sentencing Commission.
   She said the commission should delay any recommendations for
about five years because the panel's proposals are based on
inadequate research.
   That prompted an angry rebuke from George E. MacKinnon, a
federal judge and a member of the commission.
   MacKinnon, noting he had 60 years of experience as a lawyer and
a judge, said, ``I'm not legislating in the dark. We know all about
corporate crime. We might even know more than the National
Association of Manufacturers.''
   Amitai Etzioni, a professor at George Washington University,
testified that the commission and Congress ``should ignore the
self-serving cries of outrage by business interests. To deter a
corporation, fines should be set at a level which could not simply
be absorbed as part of the cost of doing business.''
   ``Let us not make this a Valentine's Day for those corporations
with blinders to all but their bottom line,'' he said.
   Hofstra University law professor Carl Mayer, representing Ralph
Nader's Public Citizen lobbying organization, said the sentencing
commission's proposed fines would help deter and punish corporate
crime.
   But he urged the commission to go further and give federal
judges power to suspend or revoke the right of companies convicted
of crimes to do business with the government. He also said judges
should have power to publicize convictions of corporations to alert
shareholders, workers and consumers.
   Joseph diGenova, a former U.S. attorney here who now represents
a group of defense lawyers, said the sentencing commission is
moving too rapidly.
   ``New laws give prosecutors and judges adequate tools for
appropriate sentences and restitution,'' he said. He said the
commission should wait at least two years before adopting
guidelines and in the interim should recommend a range of sentences
for judges to follow.
   The commission last November unveiled tentative guidelines for
increased penalties for corporations. One proposal calls for fines
of up to $374 million for the worst offenders.
   The panel said then that stiffer sentences ``will provide a
strong incentive for owners and managers of organizations to
strengthen internal mechanisms for preventing officers and
employees from committing crimes and for detecting and punishing
such crimes that are committed.''
   The commission, created by Congress in 1987, called for public
comment on its proposals before a final report is submitted to
lawmakers May 1. The guidelines would become law unless Congress
enacts legislation altering or overturning them.
   The proposals would require judges to follow certain
instructions in determining the size of fines and restitution. For
example, penalties would be bigger when top executives aid or
condone crimes or if the officials tried to block a government
investigation.
   Fines would be lower if high-level executives had reason not to
be aware of the criminal conduct.
   Fines for companies formed to engage in criminal activity would
be large enough to put them out of business.
   The guidelines are aimed at punishing businesses and forcing
them to make restitution but are not directed at punishing
individual corporate officials.
   The commission established sentencing guidelines for individual
defendants two years ago and their constitutionality has been
upheld by the Supreme Court.

<HEAD>Pope Tells Anderson's Sister He Will Pray for Him</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VATICAN CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II met Wednesday with the
sister of Terry Anderson, the longest-held Western hostage in
Lebanon, and said he would pray for him and for an end to the
bloody conflict in the Middle East country.
   ``Your brother is a journalist and he is a hostage. This is a
terrible, terrible thing,'' John Paul told Peggy Say, speaking in
English.
   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated
Press, was seized in Beirut on March 16, 1985.
   Ms. Say was received in private audience by the pope during a
tour of Europe and the Middle East in efforts to free her brother.
   She said the pope assured her that ``he would be praying with
me, as he does every day, for an end to the conflict in Lebanon and
peace and reconcilation for the people there.''
   She added that John Paul said he would pray ``for not only Terry
Anderson but all of the hostages.''
   Ms. Say recalled to the pope how another American hostage, a
Roman Catholic priest, the Rev. Lawrence Martin Jenco, had
celebrated Mass for Anderson using bits of dried bread and water
instead of wine. Anderson had pulled fibers from his floormat and
made rosaries for the two of them, she told John Paul.
   Jenco was freed in 1986 after nearly 19 months as a hostage and
was received by the pope before returning to the United States.
   After the audience, Ms. Say met with reporters before heading to
the next stop on her tour, the European Parliament's Committee on
Human Rights in Strasbourg, France.
   Seventeen other Western hostages _ seven Americans, four
Britons, two West Germans, two Swiss, an Italian and an Irishman _
are being held in Lebanon.
   Ms. Say showed John Paul a photo of Anderson's daughter, Sulome,
who was born several months after he was taken hostage, and an
older daughter, Gabrielle, now 14.
   Larry Heinzerling, who has been serving as a special assistant
to AP President and General Manager Louis D. Boccardi on the
Anderson case, also attended the audience.
   Before coming to Rome, Ms. Say and AP executives met with the
International Committee of the Red Cross in Geneva, Switzerland.
   They will also meet with the archbishop of Canterbury, Robert
Runcie, in London, UNESCO Director General Federico Mayor in Paris
and Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa in Damascus.
   The group also hopes to meet with Palestine Liberation
Organization chief Yasser Arafat.
   Ms. Say has said efforts to meet with Iranian officials received
no response. Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, spiritual head of
Hezbollah, the pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem movement in Lebanon,
declined to meet with the group outside Lebanon.
   Anderson is being held by a group calling itself Islamic Jihad,
or Islamic Holy War, generally believed to be one of several groups
operating under the umbrella of Hezbollah.

<TEXT>
   The first woman to apply for admission
to The Citadel's corp of cadets had been rejected under the
military academy's men-only rule.
   The U.S. Justice Department has indicated it will consider the
school's decision on the woman's application in deciding whether to
investigate the policy.
   The department recently ordered Virginia Military Institute _
the only other state-supported military academy in the country _ to
admit women or face a lawsuit. Virginia responded by challenging
the order in its own lawsuit.
   Women are admitted to summer and evening classes and can earn a
degree from the Citadel, but since the state-supported military
academy was founded 148 years ago, no woman has been admitted to
the 2,000-member corps of cadets.
   The rejected Citadel application was the first ever from a
woman, school spokesman Lt. Col. Ben. W. Legare Jr. said Tuesday.
   The ``admission policy to the The Citadel has not changed.
Therefore, the application for the female for 1990 entrance was
rejected,'' he said. Legare said a rejection letter was sent on
Friday to the applicant, whose name was not released.
   The rejection could lead to a lawsuit or a Justice Department
investigation, said Georgetown University law professor John
Banzhaf II.
   Banzhaf has been helping two South Carolina women with Justice
Department complaints contesting the school's policy. He would not
say whether he was assisting the rejected applicant.
   ``Once you are a graduate, you are often thought of as belonging
to an advantageous club. Women deserve the same advantage,'' he
said.

<HEAD>Major Low-Income Landlord Blasts Suspension; Says Transfers Likely</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A major subsidized housing landlord suspended
by HUD Secretary Jack Kemp said Wednesday he planned to give up
control of most of his properties, accusing Kemp of a ``scandalous
vendetta'' that was crippling service to low-income tenants.
   A. Bruce Rozet, president of California-based Associated
Financial Corp., said he was negotiating with several housing
investment and management firms and hoped to transfer roughly 300
of the 350 properties owned, managed or otherwise controlled by his
company and affiliates.
   Nonetheless, Rozet said the company would challenge the
suspension, saying the accusations were without merit and that the
company had provided documents to prove that to HUD but has been
ignored.
   Rozet also said Kemp's fear of scandal had virtually halted
government housing programs.
   ``We have now become caught up in a political campaign to divert
attention from a continuing national housing policy of benign
neglect in the name of HUD reform,'' Rozet said. ``The tenants are
being made the victims while HUD carries out it scandalous vendetta
against our company.''
   Kemp, in a statement, said poor conditions at the properties
cited in the suspension letter ``speak for themselves.'' He said
his ``outrage is not directed at any one owner or manager'' but at
a number of owners and investors he says have reaped lucrative tax
benefits but invested little of their own money in the projects.
   The department also released a memo from one of its attorneys
that said HUD's inspector general was working with the FBI to
investigate whether Associated Financial Corp.'s management
affiliate, Housing Resources Management, billed HUD for subsidies
for vacant units at an Oklahoma development. That memo said local
HUD officials in several states had raised questions about Housing
Resources actions.
   Rozet said the company on two occasions billed HUD for subsidies
for units that became vacant after the requests were filed. But
Housing Resources quickly reported the vacancies and overpayment to
HUD, Rozet said, saying such developments were routine because of
high tenant turnover.
   When HUD issued the suspension late last month, Rozet said his
role as a fund-raiser for Sen. Alan Cranston of California,
two-time presidential contender Jesse Jackson and other Democrats
gave Republicans looking for a Democrat to draw into reports of HUD
scandals an easy target. Kemp has said politics had no role in his
actions against Associated Financial and its affiliates.
   At a Washington news conference he called to answer HUD's
charges, Rozet said he shared many of Kemp's goals. He contended
Kemp has been misled about Associated Financial's performance by
``minions'' who went after the company.
   ``In HUD's desperate rush to damage our companies, HUD has, in
fact, hurt the people it claims to be protecting,'' said Rozet, who
is scheduled to testify before Congress in the near future about
his companies' properties, which include 45,000 subsidized
apartments.
   Although the suspension only prohibits Associated Financial and
its affiliates from seeking new HUD business, Rozet said Kemp
recently ordered field offices to send all Associated
Financial-related work to agency headquarters. HUD inspectors this
week also began visiting the properties with cameras, demanding to
see ``your worst unit,'' Rozet said.
   Those developments, he said, had convinced him Associated
Financial had to give up the properties it controlled until it
resolved its battle with HUD. Rozet said his companies would
receive no money through the planned transfer of control and that
HUD would have to approve the deal.
   ``It's not a question of money. It's a question of housing,''
Rozet said. ``If HUD won't do business with me, I have to find
somebody else that they will deal with or the tenants will just sit
there and suffer.''

<HEAD>Agricultural Pest Arrived With U.S. Soldier From Panama</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN ANTONIO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Screwworm larvae were discovered in the wound
of a U.S. soldier injured in Panama, prompting warnings that the
pest could infect animals in Texas.
   Screwworms are the larvae, or maggots, of a blowfly that feed on
the flesh of warm-blooded animals. They can kill livestock if the
animals go untreated.
   A 30-year program had eradicated the screwworm, first in the
United States and later in Mexico.
   The soldier was among the first to arrive in San Antonio on Dec.
20 for treatment at Brooke Army Medical Center, hospital spokesman
Ray Dery said Tuesday.
   ``There's just a remote possibility that anything escaped from
the hospital,'' said Paul Jensen, assistant area veterinarian with
the U.S. Department of Agriculture. ``The weather was in our
favor.''
   A hard freeze that hit San Antonio in late December probably
killed the larvae, which thrive in warm climates, officials said.
   Some of the larvae from the soldier's wound were saved for
analysis, and the rest were disposed of in medical trash and ended
up at a local landfill, Dery said.
   Weeks later, entomologists with the National Museum of Natural
History in Washington identified the samples that were saved as
screwworm.
   ``We're asking any local veterinarian within a 20-mile radius if
they find any larvae infestation in any animal wound to send it to
our identification lab in Mission,'' Jensen said.

   The long-haired black and white tom, named after Sir Humphrey
Appleby in the ``Yes Prime Minister'' TV series, customarily dumps

   Taxpayers provide a daily tin of food and milk.

   ``What is more, he is affectionate and even Sir Robin Butler,

   ``At night, Humphrey pops out of No. 70 Whitehall, trots along
Downing Street, past No. 10 (the prime minister's residence), and
spends the night hunting in the park.
   ``He returns in the morning, rather tired.''

   Adrian Noble, the 39-year-old director whose
credits range from Shakespeare to Cole Porter, was named Wednesday
the next artistic director of the Royal Shakespeare Company.
   Noble will assume his post April 1 as artistic director-elect.
He takes over fully in July 1991 when current artistic director
Terry Hands steps down after 25 years with the company.
   Noble will have a team of three _ executive producer Michael
Attenborough, associate producer Genista McIntosh, and general
manager David Brierley _ to form what a press statement called ``a
powerful artistic planning and operational nucleus for the
company.''
   The announcement came just a week after the company announced it
was closing its two London theaters for four months beginning in
November in order to stem a mounting deficit that threatened to
reach $6.8 million.
   ``Some people have said I've been offered a poisoned chalice,''
Noble told a news conference at the company's London base, the
Barbican.
   ``I've simply been offered to guide and run the greatest theater
company in the world ... Fund us properly to fulfill that brief,''
he said.
   The revamped structure answers criticism that management of the
company had become too large a job for one person. It echoes
somewhat the delegation of authority at the Royal National Theater,
London's other large state-subsidized playhouse, which divides
responsibilities between artistic director Richard Eyre and
executive director David Aukin.
   Noble, a graduate of Bristol University, has been an associate
director of the company for 11 years, staging such admired
productions as ``Henry V,'' which marked the professional
Shakespearean debut of this year's Oscar nominee Kenneth Branagh;
Henrik Ibsen's ``The Master Builder,'' with Broadway veteran John
Wood; and a trilogy, ``The Plantagenets,'' drawn from four
Shakespeare history plays.
   His 1987 revival of Cole Porter's ``Kiss Me, Kate'' drew mixed
reviews but transferred to the commercial West End for a lengthy
run. A mooted Broadway engagement never materialized.
   Noble made his American directing debut last December in New
York, earning excellent reviews for ``The Art of Success''
off-Broadway at the Manhattan Theater Club.
   Next, he stages Chekhov's ``Three Sisters'' for the Gate Theater
in Dublin, opening March 27. The production, a dynastic occasion,
will star leading Irish actor Cyril Cusack and three of his four
actress daughters: Sorcha, Sinead, and Niamh.

<HEAD>DNC Panel Agrees to Allow California to Change Primary Date</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>

   The Democratic Party moved Wednesday to allow
California to shift its presidential primary from June to early
March, a change that would place the largest state among the first
to vote in 1992.
   The Democratic National Committee's rules and bylaws committee,
acting with the support of DNC Chairman Ron Brown, agreed to change
party rules to permit California to hold its presidential primary
on the first Tuesday in March.
   The change, expected to be approved easily by the full DNC next
month, means a proposal in the California Legislature to hold its
Democratic and Republican presidential primaries March 3, 1992,
would be permissible under national Democratic Party rules.
   ``California felt very strongly they wanted to be a player in
the process,'' said Alice Travis, a member of the DNC executive
committee from California. ``Coming last made it somewhat
irrelevant.''
   The proposed rules would allow the party to apply a new sanction
against states that violate national party rules by holding
primaries or caucuses too early or too late, or violate other
delegate-selection rules. The change would provide an automatic 25
percent reduction in the state's total delegates.
   The California Assembly last summer approved shifting the
state's presidential primary from June to March and the state
Senate is expected to vote on the change Thursday.
   Republican Gov. George Deukmejian has dropped his opposition to
the change, removing a major obstacle.
   The new Democratic rules allow Iowa's caucuses to be the first
presidential delegate-selection event, followed a week later by New
Hampshire's first-in-the-nation primary.
   California, under the proposed schedule, would become the first
big state to vote.
   One consequence could be to lessen the importance of the two
earliest states by allowing well-financed, better-known candidates
to concentrate on the state with the richest block of delegates.
   ``It is important that a large state crucial to electing a
Democratic president weigh in early in the process,'' Brown said.
   California's June primary date has placed it at the end of the
delegate-selection process, when the nominee was already a foregone
conclusion.
   The 1988 California primary victory by Michael Dukakis over
Jesse Jackson gave Dukakis the delegates he needed to clinch the
nomination, but his nomination had been assured for practical
purposes months earlier.
   The party action technically moved up by one week the opening of
the so-called ``window'' for states to hold primaries or caucuses.
With the change, that period would run from the first Tuesday in
March to the second Tuesday in June.
   Special exceptions allow New Hampshire's primary one week
earlier, however, and Iowa's caucuses eight days before New
Hampshire. A special provision also allows Maine to begin its
caucus process early.
   The change presents a calender with Iowa, New Hampshire and
California on successive weeks, followed one week later by the
so-called Super Tuesday round of numerous state primaries. Illinois
would hold its primary a week after that.
   Party activists expect the California change to trigger other
states to move up their dates, and perhaps some will join
California on March 3.

<HEAD>US Refuses To Allow Nicaraguan Official To Make Speaking Tour</HEAD>

   The State Department has refused to grant a
visa to a top Nicaraguan diplomat to make public appearances this
week in Washington and New York, a U.S. official said Wednesday.
   The official, asking not to be identified, said the decision was
made because Nicaraguan officials could not guarantee that visas
would be issued to all members of Congress wishing to go to
Nicaragua next week to observe the presidential election there.
   According to the official, some members of Congress who have
requested visas have not received them. A Nicaraguan spokeswoman
said delays have been common in processing visas because of a large
number of requests.
   Nicaraguan Vice Foreign Minister Victor Hugo Tinoco had been
scheduled to make an appearance here Thursday at the Carnegie
Endowment for International Peace. He also was planning to appear
later in the week before the Americas Society in New York.
   The U.S. official said Tinoco withdrew his request for a visa
after the State Department imposed its condition concerning
congressional observers.
   The State Department had been willing to grant Tinoco a visa if
he had agreed to limit his activities to the United Nations and the
Organization of American States.
   Nicaraguan Embassy spokeswoman Cecilia Lopez had no comment on
the State Department action. But she said that about 3,000 foreign
observers are expected to be on hand for the Feb. 25 balloting,
which features a matchup between President Daniel Ortega and an
opposition coalition led by Violeta Chamorro.
   Last week, a 20-member congressional delegation appointed by
President Bush was disbanded because the Sandinista government
denied some members permission to enter the country.
   The Nicaraguan position is that it is inappropriate for the
Sandinistas to accept an official U.S. delegation because of
American support for the Nicaraguan Contras and the U.S. economic
embargo imposed against that country.
   The Nicaraguans invited the delegates to apply for visas to
observe the election in an unofficial capacity.
   Twelve members of Congress will join an unofficial observer
delegation headed by former President Carter. Eight other lawmakers
will form part of two other delegations organized under the
auspices of the U.N. and the OAS.

   The bittersweet ``Driving Miss
Daisy'' carried off a leading nine Academy Award nominations
Wednesday as Oscar voters passed over box-office blockbusters and
maverick movies with equal abandon.
   ``Daisy,'' which traces the relationship over the decades
between a testy Jewish widow and her tolerant black chauffeur in
the South, drew nominations for best picture and actors Morgan
Freeman, Jessica Tandy and Dan Aykroyd.
   ``Born on the Fourth of July,'' director Oliver Stone's account
of Ron Kovic's painful passage from blind patriotism to unselfish
protest by way of a Vietnam injury that left him a paraplegic, got
eight nominations, including best picture.
   Also nominated in the top picture category by the Academy of
Motion Picture Arts and Sciences were ``Dead Poets Society,''
``Field of Dreams'' and ``My Left Foot.''
   ``This is truly one of the happiest and most triumphant moments
of my life,'' said Kovic.
   Among other multiple nominees, ``Glory,'' a look at an all-black
regiment in the Civil War, and ``My Left Foot,'' the story of an
indomitable Irish artist with cerebral palsy, each earned five
nominations.
   ``The Abyss,'' ``The Adventures of Baron Munchausen,'' ``Dead
Poets Society'' and ``The Fabulous Baker Boys'' grabbed four
nominations each.
   Oscar voters largely ignored many of the year's highest-grossing
titles, as ``Batman,'' ``Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade,''
``Lethal Weapon 2,'' ``Honey, I Shrunk the Kids'' and ``Look Who's
Talking'' captured only five nominations combined.
   A number of modestly budgeted, independently minded efforts also
were given short shrift, including the critically embraced
``Drugstore Cowboy,'' which was shut out.
   ``Do the Right Thing,'' while landing on numerous critics' Top
10 lists, snared just two nominations, and ``sex, lies and
videotape,'' one of the best-received independent films of the
decade, generated just one.
   For the second time in two years, Academy voters did not
nominate the year's most acclaimed documentary. ``Roger &amp; Me,''
filmmaker Michael Moore's satirical perspective on General Motors
and the people of Flint, Mich., was overlooked.
   In 1989, the Academy did not nominate Errol Morris' ``The Thin
Blue Line,'' the movie which set convicted murderer Randall Dale
Adams free.
   The awards will be presented on March 26. The show will be seen
on ABC.
   ``Born on the Fourth of July'' was nominated for Tom Cruise's
lead performance as Kovic, for adapted screenplay, for Stone's
direction, cinematography, editing, original score and sound.
   Joining Freeman and Cruise in the race for best actor were
Kenneth Branagh, the star, director and adaptor of Shakespeare's
``Henry V,'' Daniel Day-Lewis, who played artist Christy Brown in
``My Left Foot,'' and comedian Robin Williams, as an unconventional
teacher in a very conventional school in ``Dead Poets Society.''
   Isabelle Adjani, featured in France's ``Camille Claudel'' as an
impassioned sculptress, was perhaps the most surprising nominee for
best actress.
   Miss Adjani will compete against Miss Tandy, who played the
widow Miss Daisy; Pauline Collins, who starred as a frustrated
British housewife who finds happiness on a Greek isle in ``Shirley
Valentine''; Jessica Lange, who defends an alleged Nazi war
criminal who also is her father in ``Music Box,'' and Michelle
Pfeiffer, the chanteuse of ``The Fabulous Baker Boys.''
   British stage star Branagh joins a select list of Oscar nominees
by being recognized for both starring in and directing ``Henry V.''
Woody Allen (``Annie Hall''), Warren Beatty (``Heaven Can Wait,''
``Reds'') and Orson Welles (``Citizen Kane'') are among the few who
have shared the dual acting-directing recognition for the same film.
   In addition to Branagh, the nominees for best director were
Stone for ``Born on the Fourth of July,'' Allen for ``Crimes and
Misdemeanors,'' Peter Weir for ``Dead Poets Society'' and Jim
Sheridan for ``My Left Foot.''
   Belying a tradition that films released late in the year are
favored in the Oscars, ``Field of Dreams'' was released April 21
and ``Dead Poets Society'' June 2.
   ``Field of Dreams,'' writer and director Phil Alden Robinson's
magical tale of a man who rediscovers the past on a Iowa baseball
field, also was nominated for best adapted screenplay.
   ``We got letters from people saying the film had changed their
lives, that it had brought families back together. We couldn't have
asked for more than that,'' Robinson said.

   Hundreds of pushy, barking sea lions, some
weighing more than 800 pounds, are occupying at least 20 slips at
the pricy Pier 39 yacht basin, delighting tourists but making life
miserable for the marina and boat owners.
   ``They're cute as buttons, but they're very aggressive,''
complained management spokeswoman Lucy Hobgood-Brown. ``They're not
hurting business, but they're damaging the docks, and they have bad
breath.''
   The problem is that the herring-gobbling sea lions are under the
federal Marine Mammals Protective Act and may not be harassed,
hunted, captured or killed.
   ``I don't think you can even glare at them,'' said marina
manager Sheila Chandor.
   National Marine Fisheries Service biologist Brad Hanson said
experts are mystified as to why the mammals have descended on such
a public spot. He said they usually prefer relatively isolated
areas.
   For more than a month, the members of the herd _ with up to 300
animals _ have been fishing, frolicking and fighting at the boat
berths, which can sell for up to $50,000.
   Pier 39 is a shopping, restaurant and amusement complex just
east of Fisherman's Wharf.
   The management is worried that the bulky animals, adding
unexpected tons of weight to floating docks, will do serious damage
to them and the attached water pipes and electric conduits. When
the whole gang is out of the water, the docks are awash.
   Many electric meters at dock boxes have already been slapped
loose when the sea lions haul out of the water. The frisky
creatures also scrape loose metal flashing and bash in relatively
fragile dock boxes.
   ``Our `guests' won't leave,'' Chandor mourned. ``But the
tourists love it.''
   The pier's main walkway runs directly in front of the sea lions'
adopted neighborhood. During afternoons, the place is a cacophony
of barking blubber, chattering tourists and clicking cameras.
   The sea lions are all bulls, most of them 3- to 5-year-old
juveniles, Hanson said. Some, however, are full-grown and highly
aggressive characters that have charged people venturing onto the
docks. No one has been hurt.
   Hanson thought the sea lions invaded the marina because the
berths happened to be empty at the time. Boats are to be returned
to the occupied docks next week, and all hands are hoping for the
best.
   ``The mating season starts in May and we're hoping the males
here will go and join the ladies at the breeding grounds in the
Channel Islands,'' said Hobgood-Brown. The islands are north of Los
Angeles, near Santa Barbara.

   An agreement giving the four Allies of World War
II an advisory role in German reunification allayed fears in many
countries about a military resurgence, but some anxieties remained
Wednesday.
   Poland, worried about its borders, demanded a role in talks on
the security aspects of unification.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain, who had not hidden
her unease about a united Germany, felt ``much happier'' after the
argreement Tuesday in Ottawa, Canada, to hold the six-power talks,
her aides said.
   ``We were worried there wasn't a framework in which we and the
Russians and other interested parties could actually discuss the
external side of this,'' Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said. ``Now
we have that framework ... we are much happier.''
   Under the agreement, the United States, Soviet Union, Britain
and France _ the Allies that conquered Nazi Germany and still
occupy Berlin _ will confer with both Germanys on the security
ramifications of a single Germany.
   Officials of East Germany and West Germany will negotiate after
East German elections March 18, then join the Allies to focus on
the ``external aspects ... including the issues of security of the
neighboring states,'' the Ottawa announcement said.
   A six-power agreement would be presented to a 35-nation summit
before the end of the year.
   The Soviet Union, whose casualties in World War II were
heaviest, said Wednesday its sensitivities should be taken into
account.
   ``We have a psychological trauma. We lost 26 million'' people in
the war, Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov told a
news briefing. He added, however, that he believed Europe was
changing for the better.
   Premier Tadeusz Mazowiecki of Poland said at the end of a
three-day visit to Britain: ``We want to be present whenever the
question of the security of Germany's neighbors is discussed. Our
stand is that our security matters cannot be settled by proxy for
us. We must be present.''
   Mazowiecki said Poland wants a treaty guaranteeing its borders,
which embrace territory populated by ethnic Germans and annexed
from Germany at the end of World War II. No peace treaty was
signed, so Poland has no formal guarantees.
   West Germany has said a unified Germany would respect the border
and make no territorial claims.
   Israeli officials referred to a statement Monday by Foreign
Minister Moshe Arens that the Jewish state puts its faith in
democracy.
   ``No one, but certainly us Jews, can think about reunification
without somehow remembering what happened 50 years ago,'' Arens
said, referring to the 6 million Jews killed by the Nazis. But he
added: ``If a united Germany is a democratic Germany ... then I
don't think that there is a danger to be concerned about.''
   Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher of West Germany said
after an hourlong meeting Wednesday with Mrs. Thatcher that final
arrangements for reunification should be ready before the end of
the year.
   ``The prime minister has expressed firm support for German
unity,'' Genscher told reporters outside Mrs. Thatcher's residence
at 10 Downing Street. ``It is an enormous encouragement ... for
Germans in East and West.''
   In November, Mrs. Thatcher said German unification was ``not on
the agenda.'' Her aides say that was before East Germany slid into
economic chaos, largely due to the mass flight of skilled workers
to West Germany.
   ``The pace of events has surprised everyone,'' Hurd said
Wednesday.
   Mrs. Thatcher has been accused at home of wasting British
influence by belatedly and grudgingly accepting German unification.
   Hurd said the most important issue for the six-power talks was
whether a single Germany would remain in NATO, as the United States
wants, or becomes neutral, as the Soviet Union prefers.
   President Francois Mitterrand of France urged the 12-nation
European Community, which includes West Germany, to hasten its own
moves toward closer union.
   ``For me, what is essential is that Europe again take its true
place in the world after the self-destruction of two world wars,''
he said in an interview with eight regional French newspapers.
``The acceleration of the inter-German process should be
accompanied by the acceleration of the European process.''
   Ireland, current president of the European Community, said it
would summon the 12 nations soon to discuss German reunification.

   Villagers threw firebombs and acid at troops
protecting the Communist Party headquarters in the Tadzhik capital
on Wednesday, but the violence eased after three leaders in the
republic resigned, Soviet media said.
   The three agreed to resign during a meeting of party leaders and
activists who are protesting housing shortages and the arrival of
Armenian refugees, said Orif Aminov of the Tadzhik branch of the
state television and radio agency.
   Earlier in the day, about 5,000 young men went on a rampage in
the republic's capital, looting, setting fires and attacking
passers-by ``irrespective of nationality,'' the Soviet news agency
Tass said.
   But officials denied Soviet television reports that 37 people
had been killed in the violence in Tadzhikistan, which borders
Afghanistan and China. Tass said 12 people had died. Tadzhik
Interior Ministry spokesman Mikhail Shtatnov reported 11 dead and
143 injured.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev criticized the rioters and called
for harsh action against them, saying the ``country's destiny and
the safety of our citizens is at stake.''
   Ethnic disturbances have killed hundreds of people in Central
Asia and the Caucasus areas of the Soviet Union in the past year.
The violence in Tadzhikistan broke out Monday after rumors spread
that ethnic Armenians reportedly persecuted by natives of the
Azerbaijani republic were being moved into the Taszhik republic,
where housing is scarce.
   More troops landed in Dushanbe, the capital, on Wednesday to
guard strategic points and restore order, Tass said. The evening
television news show Vremya showed hundreds of people facing a wall
of troops carrying riot shields with a barren stretch of street
between the two tense groups.
   However, Shtatnov and Dushanbe-based journalist Anatoly Larenok
said in telephone interviews that the troops were in full control.
Larenok said they had blocked approaches to the city to prevent
rioters from neighboring villages from entering.
   Larenok said the crowd outside the Central Committee
headquarters was demanding that victims of the three days of
violence be buried in that central square.
   Tass described a pitched battle between protesters and troops.
It said the crowds demanded that the leaders resign and that all
Armenians in the republic be expelled.
   ``Militants have been making attempts to reach the Tadzhik
Communist Party headquarters since this morning,'' Tass said
Wednesday. ``Crowds throw gasoline bombs, bottles with sulphuric
acid and stones at troops blocking the building's entrances.''
   Aminov said the city quieted after the Communist Party Central
Committee, meeting with protest leaders calling themselves the
Popular Committee of 16, announced the resignation of Tadzhik party
chief Kakhar Makhkamov, Premier Izatullo Khayeyev and President
Gaibnazar Pallayev.
   Aminov said the crowd outside the Central Committee headquarters
also demanded the ouster of the interior minister and military
commandant, Kamil Pulatov, but he remains in his post.
   The national newspaper Trud said the rioters were young men from
villages in the nearby Gissar region, many of whom still are living
in tents after their homes were destroyed in an earthquake in
January.
   Though the rioting reportedly was set off by rumors that
Armenian refugees would be given priority for new housing, the
young men who had come into Dushanbe with concealed sticks, metal
rods and canisters of gasoline, had attacked Russian-speaking
people in five suburbs, the newspaper said.
   Gorbachev told the opening session of the Supreme Soviet
legislature in Moscow that new legislation is being prepared to
deal with such violence.
   ``We should throw the book at those who, under slogans of ethnic
revival, draw people into a fight for their ambitions and selfish
goals,'' Gorbachev said Wednesday.
   ``This is a kind of chain reaction accompanied by an orgy of
violence,'' Gorbachev said. ``The country's destiny and the safety
of our citizens is at stake, comrades. We must do everything to put
out the fire.''
   Gorbachev's greater tolerance of dissent has given rise to
fierce demonstrations of ethnic pride that range from peaceful
independence movements in the Baltics to brutal ethnic clashes in
the Caucasus.
   Shtatnov said none of the dead was killed by Interior Ministry
soldiers sent in to quell the fighting. But Malik Khadyrov of the
state radio and television offices in Dushanbe said his
correspondents reported seeing some people fatally shot by soldiers.
   Radio Moscow quoted commanders of regular army forces in
Dushanbe as saying they would not step in to restore order because
they did not want to repeat the mistakes made in April in the
republic of Georgia, when soldiers attacked peaceful demonstrators
and led to 20 deaths.
   The government issued a radio appeal for citizens to fight bands
of rioters, said a Dushanbe resident, Zina Ushanova, in a telephone
interview. It called on residents of the city to don white head
bands to distinguish themselves from rioters.

<HEAD>Noted Legal Scholar Says Soviets Must Revamp Judicial System</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A prominent Soviet legal scholar said
Wednesday the Soviet judicial system is riddled with incompetent
judges and must be revamped if political reforms are to succeed,
   Yuri Rozenbaum, who has drafted proposed new Soviet laws on
freedom of conscience and the press, also said the Soviet
bureaucracy has ``many no-goods, incompetents, who have to be
thrown out.''
   Rozenbaum, an attorney who works on the Commission on Freedom of
Conscience of the Supreme Soviet, or parliament, spoke at the
East-West Forum, a private organization that sponsors contacts
between Soviet and U.S. scholars and government officials.
   Before the reforms of Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev,
judges were picked by the Communist Party and held onto office if
they were sufficiently ``subservient,'' Rozenbaum said.
   ``We've discovered we don't have competent judges,'' he said.
   Reformers would like to see the next batch of judges picked
without party interference, and to have their pay increased to
assure their indepedence, Rozenbaum told the group. Independent
selection of judges can only occur if local elections in the Soviet
Union are conducted in democratic fashion, he added.
   Communist Party candidates are expected to face tough challenges
in republic and local elections being held this month and next in
the 15 republics that make up the Soviet Union.
   Secessionist candidates are expected to do well in the Baltic
republics of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, as well as the southern
republics of Georgia, Armenia and Azerbaijan.
   In the four Central Asian republics, no significant changes are
expected in local elections because the largely Moslem population
there votes according to tribal and family customs, he said.
   ``The most fundamental problem is in the executive branch,''
said Rozenbaum.
   Some incompetent bureaucrats have already been discarded under
the political and economic restructuring initiated by Gorbachev, he
said.
   But ``the government apparatus is the primary problem for
perestroika'' or restructuring, because entrenched bureaucrats have
been dragging their heels implementing the reforms, Rozenbaum said.
   Bureaucrats are ``uncomfortable'' with the growing contact
between elected lawmakers and non-government lawyers, he said.
   ``This makes the bureaucrats afraid because the deputies are
becoming too independent and not paying attention to lawyers within
the apparatus,'' he said.

   Two Ethiopian rebel groups on Wednesday
claimed they killed hundreds of army troops and wounded hundreds
more in fighting since last week.
   A communique by the Eritrean People's Liberation Front also said
the government cut off electricity to Massawa, a Red Sea port they
claim to have captured.
   Massawa gets its electricity from Eritrea's capital, Asmara,
whose 40-mile road westward from the port is also claimed to be in
rebel control.
   The rebel communique, issued from their office in Khartoum,
Sudan, said they killed more than 600 troops, wounded 900 and
captured 27 in fighting in recent days around Keren, 55 miles west
of Massawa. They provided no rebel casualty figures.
   The rebel offensive, the largest in more than a year, coincided
with fighting in Wollo province where another rebel group, the
Tigre People's Liberation Front, has claimed it killed more than
1,800 government troops, wounding 2,500 and capturing more than
1,000.
   The fighting was Saturday and Sunday 180 miles northeast of the
Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, the group said in a clandestine
broadcast.
   President Mengistu Haile Mariam's Marxist government has not
directly denied the rebel claim they control Massawa and the only
land route to Asmara.
   In Addis Ababa, the government had made no statement since
saying Monday there was heavy fighting along the 40-mile-long
Asmara-Massawa road and at the port itself.
   Meanwhile, shipping sources in Copenhagen, Denmark, said
Wednesday the Eritrean rebels seized the ship Svea Atlantic 27
nautical miles north of Massawa. The sources said the ship, owned
by Svendborg West of Denmark, left Dublin, Ireland, Jan. 17 with
relief aid for Ethiopia. The status of the eight-man crew remained
unknown.
   The rebel communique made no mention of the ship.
   United Nations officials say the fighting around Massawa has
halted efforts to feed drought victims in northern Ethiopia,
leaving 50,000 tons of food stored at the port.
   The food is part of 700,000 tons of emergency food the United
Nations hoped to deliver over the next months to 4 million people
threatened with famine, most of them in Eritrea and Tigre.
   The Eritrean rebels have been fighting since 1962 for the
independence of Ethiopia's northermost province. The Tigre group,
fighting since 1975, controls the province Tigre and seeks
Mengistu's ouster and the establishment of a government patterned
after that of Albania, the last of the hard-line Marxist states in
Eastern Europe.

<HEAD>Traffickers Intensify Publicity Campaign Before Bush Visit</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Medellin cartel, which officials
have feared might attack President Bush during his visit here,
apparently decided to aim for positive publicity beginning with the
surrender of three cocaine laboratories.
   The three jungle labs, worth an estimated $20 million and
capable of producing 20 tons of cocaine each month, were turned
over late Tuesday by cartel representatives.
   But the national police chief, Gen. Miguel Gomez, told reporters
Wednesday the laboratories had not been used for some time and that
there was no cocaine or chemicals for processing at them.
   Furthermore, police raided another laboratory Tuesday and seized
1,540 pounds of coke and 60,000 gallons of chemicals, proving the
traffickers are going ahead with their production of cocaine, Gomez
said at a news conference in Caratagena.
   He also said the traffickers' promise to free hostages to end
the drug war was meaningless because five people released in the
last six weeks had to pay ransoms. Gomez did not say how much the
ransoms were.
   Leftist guerrillas Wednesday continued to hold two U.S. citizens
kidnapped to protest the Bush visit this week, a police spokesman
said. He denied earlier reports that one of the victims had been
released.
   The Americans were identified as David Kent, a teacher from
Indianapolis, and James Donnelly, employed by a company that
manufactures hydraulic equipment.
   The White House denounced the kidnappings and said it ``cannot
allow threats of terrorism to influence its policies or its
activities.''
   Bush is to meet in this port city with presidents Virgilio Barco
of Colombia, Alan Garcia of Peru and Jaime Paz of Bolivia to try to
build a four-country strategy to halt the flow of cocaine into the
United States.
   The Colombian national radio network RCN, citing Barco
administration sources, said Barco would ask Bush to help the
country seek $1 billion in credits from international banking
organizations over the next three years.
   Barco will ask the U.S. Treasury Department to guarantee
Colombian bonds to be sold on European markets, RCN said.
   RCN, which said it received an advance copy of the agreement to
be signed Thursday by the four presidents, said the document calls
for a world anti-drug conference next year without specifying a
date or the place.
   The four presidents pledge in the statement to meet again within
six months to review their progress in the war against cocaine,
according to RCN.
   Also expected to be on the summit agenda are U.S. plans to
control exports of chemicals used to process cocaine as well as to
fight trafficking in arms used by drug barons.
   The Bush administration has said it will give $2.2 billion in
aid to Bolivia, Colombia and Peru over the next five years to help
in their anti-drug efforts.
   The three jungle laboratories, in Choco state on the border with
Panama, were opened to journalists Tuesday night.
   The journalists also received a communique repeating a peace
offer from the Extraditables, as the Medellin drug bosses call
themselves.
   On Jan. 17, traffickers offered to lay down their arms, abandon
the cocaine business and help fight crime in Colombia if the
government would promise them ``constitutional and legal
guarantees.''
   Most officials took that to mean guarantees against what the
traffickers fear most _ extradition to the United States. Since
Barco intensified a campaign against traffickers last August, the
government has extradited 14 drug suspects.
   In the last month, the traffickers have released six of 21
hostages authorities say they are holding and have turned over a
bus with 1,000 pounds of dynamite.
   The goodwill gestures have done little to ease security fears,
and 5,000 security personnel from the four countries at the summit
have been sent to Cartagena to protect the leaders. In addition,
guests at local hotels are being finger-printed, and
dynamite-sniffing dogs will be on patrol.
   The United States has also stationed two ships, the Nassau and
the Sampson, off the coast of Colombia to protect Bush.

Timetable</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev appealed Wednesday
for legislative backing for a stronger presidency and said it was
vital to his reforms, but wary lawmakers refused to be stampeded
into setting a timetable.
   Once again, the 542-member Supreme Soviet proved itself a force
to be reckoned with in the new Soviet political game, which under
Gorbachev has shifted more from closed-door sessions of the Kremlin
leadership to elected government bodies.
   After a two-month break, the fledgling Soviet legislature
reconvened for the third time in its less than one-year history.
Lawmakers approved a 22-item agenda to debate bills designed to put
flesh on the skeleton of Gorbachev's economic and social reforms,
including legalization of private property.
   However, the Kremlin leadership's proposal to call an emergency
session of the Supreme Soviet's parent body, the Congress of
People's Deputies, to replace the office now held by Gorbachev with
a stronger Western-style presidency met with raucous debate.
   ``Unless democracy is strengthened and ensured by corresponding
mechanisms, democracy will perish and we'll lose,'' Gorbachev
angrily told his critics.
   Otherwise, he said, the victors will be forces who want to
``tighten the screws even tighter than they were earlier.''
   More power for the presidency would strengthen Gorbachev's
government powers while further weakening the Communist Party
apparatus that he is trying to reform.
   Gorbachev would have two powerful instruments to implement his
program of ``perestroika'' _ the party apparatus and the reinforced
machinery of government.
   Vice President Anatoly I. Lukyanov, who flanked Gorbachev
beneath a gilded globe emblazoned with the hammer and sickle,
recommended that lawmakers call the Congress into session Feb. 27
to fortify the presidency and make other constitutional changes _
including the planned abandonment of the Communist Party's legally
guaranteed right to govern.
   A close Gorbachev adviser, Georgy Shaknazarov, told reporters
during a break in the proceedings that top Kremlin officials want
the Congress to elect the new president within a month.
   But the Supreme Soviet voted 304-95, with 34 abstentions, to
debate the presidential issue first. If the Supreme Soviet approves
Gorbachev's plan to fortify the presidency, it must then be
confirmed by the Congress of People's Deputies.
   Gorbachev, the Soviet leader since March 1985, is likely to be a
candidate for the new presidency, but for the second time in a week
he spoke guardedly about whether he will run.
   ``If we proceed to take a decision on the presidency, we will
decide that there will be alternative candidates,'' he said. ``I
don't know if I will be among the alternatives.''
   Still, a half-dozen speakers Wednesday criticized the rush to
create a more powerful presidency, and Gorbachev acknowledged that
some Soviets equate him with late Romanian dictator Nicolae
Ceausescu. He did not clarify whether the comparison was being made
by reformers or by hard-liners who supported Ceausescu's brand of
iron-fisted leadership.
   Ceausescu was ousted by a popular revolution and executed Dec.
25.
   Gorbachev told the legislature that he was once opposed to
presidential power, but ``life has demanded changes.'' In the
Soviet political system, the head of state has traditionally been
merely a figurehead.
   A prominent liberal lawmaker from Leningrad, Anatoly Sobchak,
said that increasing the powers of the presidency would decrease
those of the legislature, and he opposed such a shift.
   Ilmar Bisher of Latvia said he supported the stronger presidency
but only if the powers of the office are carefully tailored. He
said that couldn't be done in time to hold a session of the
2,250-member Congress this month.
   Another speaker said the people would consider it strange for
the Congress to elect a president now, since it elected Gorbachev
to a five-year term as Supreme Soviet chairman _ sometimes termed
``president'' for short _ only last spring and increased his powers.
   In the corridors outside the Kremlin hall, a legislative
opposition, the Inter-regional Deputies Group, circulated a
petition demanding that the president be directly elected by the
people. It said voters should cast ballots in secret and have a
choice of candidates from several parties.
   The petition, read on the floor of the Supreme Soviet by group
member Sergei Stankevich, also called for the question of a
bolstered presidency to be postponed until new legislatures to be
elected in the 15 Soviet republics this spring can consider the
idea.
   In a platform approved last week, the Communist Party's
policy-making Central Committee called for removal of the party's
constitutional guarantee on power and set aside the strict Marxist
prohibition against large-scale private ownership.
   The Supreme Soviet will consider both issues. It scheduled a
report Thursday morning on a bill that will allow Soviet citizens
and foreigners alike to own property, including buildings and
entire factories.

   President Alan Garcia postponed his departure
for the drug summit in Colombia, reportedly because he saw no point
in arriving a day early only to wait for President Bush's arrival
on Thursday.
   Garcia had been scheduled to leave Wednesday afternoon, for
Cartagena, Colombia, for the meeting with Bush and presidents
Virgilio Barco of Colombia and Jaime Paz Zamora of Bolivia.
   His departure was delayed until 5 a.m. Thursday, and he told
reporters at Government Palace that a full schedule was responsible.
   But according to local press reports, Garcia disapproved of the
original schedule, which had the three Latin American presidents
arriving a day early and waiting for Bush, whose one-day visit is
to be made under heavy security.
   On Wednesday, Garcia presided over the ceremonial lowering of
the Panamanian flag from above Government Palace, where he ordered
it raised as a symbol of protest after U.S. troops invaded Panama
Dec. 20 to oust Manuel Antonio Noriega.
   Garcia ordered the flag to remain until U.S. troops were gone.
The White House announced Tuesday that all invasion forced had
returned home.
   Garcia has been one of the region's most vocal critics of the
invasion. He announced in December he would not attend the
Cartagena summit, saying ``I cannot meet with the leader of an
invading nation.''
   He also recalled Peru's ambassador to Washington in protest and
briefly halted Peruvian-U.S. anti-drug operations in the Huallaga
Valley.
   Then on Feb. 2 Garcia reversed his decision after Bush said the
troops would be out by the end of February.
   A Palace official, who asked that his name not be used, said
Garcia's plane would arrive in Cartagena about half an hour before
Bush's on Thursday morning.
   Among those accompanying Garcia will be Foreign Minister
Guillermo Larco Cox and Peru's ambassador to Colombia, Javier
Pulgar.
   Completing the entourage will be two officials from a
coca-growers cooperative and a U.N. official who works with the
cooperative in Peru's Upper Huallaga Valley, where most of the
country's coca leaf is grown. Garcia invited the three along as
observers.

<HEAD>FDA Approves Drug to Ease Symptoms of Reproductive Disorder</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday
approved a new drug that relieves the symptoms of endometriosis, a
disorder of the reproductive tract that affects more than 4 million
U.S. women.
   The drug, Synarel, is the first drug of its class to be approved
for this condition. It will be marketed by Syntex Corp.
   Synarel is administered as a nasal spray twice daily for six
months and works by stimulating and then suppressing production of
estrogen, which controls the growth of the endometrial tissue that
lines the uterus.
   Endometriosis occurs when this tissue, which usually is shed
monthly with menstruation, migrates outside the uterus, most often
into the abdominal and pelvic region, where it swells and bleeds
during menstruation.
   This tissue implants on the ovaries, the intestines and the
fallopian tubes, where it can cause blockage and infertility.
   Symptoms of endometriosis include severe menstrual cramps, pain
during sexual intercourse, painful urination and painful bowel
movements.
   Side effects of Synarel, which is nafarelin acetate, are the
same as problems associated with menopause, including hot flashes,
vaginal dryness and, less commonly, decreased sex drive, Syntex
said. A small loss of bone density also can occur, but most is
recovered after treatment is completed.
   Currently, the most widely prescribed drug for treatment of the
symptoms of endometriosis is danazol, a derivative of a male sex
hormone. Its side effects include weight gain, decrease in breast
size, deepening of the voice, acne, oily skin and unwanted hair
growth.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A proposed change in Federal Communications
Commission rules would allow dial-a-porn services to transmit
indecent material to adults if they required credit card payments,
issued access codes, scrambled their messages and asked phone
companies to list 900 calls to their services on customers' bills.
   The FCC is seeking public comment by March 2 on the rules, which
the commission first adopted in 1987. But Congress, concerned that
the rules were not tough enough to prevent enterprising youths from
gaining access to the sex messages, banned dial-a-porn services
outright in April 1988.
   But the Supreme Court overturned the law, saying the statute
could apply only to commercial material that was judged obscene _
``patently offensive'' and without redeeming value _ not merely
indecent.
   The court said the technological safeguards proposed by the FCC
were enough to ensure that minors would not reach the dial-a-porn
services and, therefore, the government was left with no compelling
reason to ban such calls for adults.
   The court retained the outright ban on for-pay obscene telephone
material.
   In its notice Tuesday, the FCC asked for comment on the
``effectiveness, feasibility and need for the billing notification
requirement ... in light of intervening statutory, regulatory or
market changes.''
   It also asked commenters to suggest alternatives, including
technological advances and new telephone company service offerings,
including a discussion of the related costs and benefits of each
alternative.

<NOTE>Eds: INSERTS 10th graf: ``Preparing for,'' with Baker-Shevardnadze
meeting</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   President Bush, hailing ``historic change'' in
superpower relations, said Wednesday that Soviet acceptance of his
troop cut proposal removed a major obstacle to a conventional arms
treaty for Europe.
   Bush said he was caught by surprise at how quickly the troop
agreement and a separate pact to speed German unification had
fallen into place.
   ``We're dealing with historic change,'' Bush told reporters. He
added with a laugh, ``I mean to be very elated about this.''
   Bush was criticized last year for his low-key public reaction to
news that East Germany was opening the Berlin Wall.
   The latest developments came Tuesday in Ottawa in talks between
Secretary of State James A. Baker III, Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard Shevardnadze and other European foreign ministers.
   With Baker at his side, Bush said he was ``delighted'' with the
agreement on troop cuts.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who last week called for
parity with U.S. forces, agreed to a pullout that will leave both
sides with 195,000 troops in Central Europe, but an additional
30,000 U.S. troops in Britain, Italy, Spain, Greece and Turkey.
   ``This is an important breakthrough which removes a major
obstacle to the early conclusion of a CFE (Conventional Forces in
Europe) treaty, and it also established the principle that U.S.
forces in Europe are not to be treated as equivalent to Soviet
forces in Eastern Europe,'' said Bush.
   ``Now, let's close the deal. That's what I want to do,'' he
declared. ``There's still some technical problems in it.''
   Preparing for other possible deals, notably on long-range
nuclear weapons, Baker will meet Shevardnadze again in April in
Washington to prepare for the June summit of Bush and Gorbachev,
officials said.
   Despite the agreement on manpower ceilings, the United States
and the Soviet Union still must settle differences over combat
aircraft and anti-cheating procedures to wrap up a 23-nation treaty
to reduce forces and weapons in Europe.
   The treaty is now under negotiation in Vienna between the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact.
   For treaty purposes, Central Europe is defined as West Germany,
Denmark, Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands for the U.S. side
and East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Poland and Hungary for Soviet
troops.
   On the Germany question, the four powers that defeated Adolf
Hitler's Nazi Germany in World War II _ the United States, Soviet
Union, Britain and France _ have agreed to meet with leaders of the
two Germanys to lay the groundwork for unification.
   Bush, who had said Monday it was too early for a four powers'
meeting on the future of Germany, said he was surprised at the pace
of events.
   ``This brings us a step closer to realizing the longstanding
goal of German unity,'' said Bush, who has insisted that a united
Germany must belong to NATO. He also said the developments bring
closer ``a Europe that is whole and free.''
   Meanwhile, Yuri Dubinin, Soviet ambassador to the United States,
said the manpower levels agreed upon at Ottawa ``are the ceiling
and not the floor in our view.''
   ``We should continue with these talks to secure the withdrawal
of all foreign troops from Europe by 1995-1996 and the elimination
of all military bases on foreign territories by the year 2000,''
Dubinin told a news conference.
   Bush, asked why he thought Gorbachev had acceded to his position
on the troop cuts, said, ``Events are moving awfully fast there,
and I think they see this as good for them. I hope they see it as a
stabilizing agreement for Europe.''
   Asked if the Warsaw Pact as well as NATO could have a role in a
new Germany, Bush said: ``The allies want the stability of U.S.
forces in Europe ... and a strong NATO. The Eastern European
countries that make up the Warsaw Pact want the Soviets to leave.
They have a different equation.
   ``We are talking about Germany remaining in NATO; flexibility on
where the troops in Germany are, but a strong NATO,'' said Bush.
   Asked if he were ready to propose initiatives for talks on
long-range nuclear missiles, Bush said he had not yet had a chance
to talk to Baker since his return from Moscow and Ottawa.
   ``But now, guess what we're going to do? We're going to go in
and talk about this,'' Bush said.
   Bush fielded questions from reporters after signing a $42
million aid package to help Panama recover from the effects of
Manuel Antonio Noriega's dictatorship and the U.S. invasion that
overthrew him. Some of the money was shifted from African aid
accounts. Congress is still working on a $1 billion Panama aid
package.

<TEXT>
   The chairman of the Simon Wisenthal Center has
asked to meet with the leaders of West and East Germany to discuss
``the great fear that German reunification brings to the community
of victims of Nazism.''
   ``I must tell you I am not among those in the cheering section
applauding the rush towards German reunification,'' Rabbi Marvin
Hier wrote Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany and Prime
Minister Hans Modrow of East Germany.
   ``However, if that is the inevitable course, let us at least
place on record our concerns,'' he said.
   Hier is the founder of the center, headquartered in Los Angeles,
which seeks to keep alive the memory of the Nazi persecution of
Jews in Germany and Nazi-conquered lands.
   In nearly identical letters, he asked to meet with Kohl during
his forthcoming trip to Washington and with Modrow in Germany next
month. The letters were made available Wednsday to The Associated
Press.
   ``You are undoubtedly aware,'' he wrote both leaders, ``of the
great fear that German reunification brings to the community of
victims of Nazism.''
   ``It is not an irrational fear of the kind that one explains
away as the nightmares of victims who remain locked into their past
and lose all perspective of present reality.
   ``The fears are real because those who bear the scars of the
last `unified Germany' do not see their concerns being addressed in
the current reunification discussions betwen world leaders.''
   Hier listed 10 points he wanted to raise. Among them were a
program to teach German schoolchildren about the annhilation of the
Jews; the creation of an agency to monitor and prosecute hate
groups; the continuation of the ``special relationship'' now
existing between West Germany and Israel; the convening of a 1992
conference of world leaders on the 50th anniversary of the
conference at which ``the final solution'' was developed; the
establisment of a German commission to protect Holocaust sites; the
banning of terrorist organizations that ``have enjoyed
respectablity in East Germany;'' a cultural exchange program
between German and Jewish organizations; German television and
radio programs on the reconciliation; restitution payments to the
families and victims of Nazism, and a German commitment to
revitalize former synagogues in East German territory.

   Valentine's Day may be a time to celebrate
the quality of love _ but there's nothing wrong with a little
quantity too. Just ask 167 couples who tied the knot or reaffirmed
their vows together on a dance floor Wednesday.
   ``His mother passed away ... and said she'd always wanted us to
have a large wedding,'' Kim Moore said before her marriage to Jeff
Hamilton. ``What other place are you going to have 1,000 people at
your wedding?''
   The nuptials organized by radio station KATT featured a healthy
helping of rock 'n' roll and a his-and-hers sing-along of the theme
song from the 1960s TV show, ``Green Acres.''
   In addition to the 94 couples getting married for the first time
and the 74 reaffirming their vows, 668 guests packed the room at
the Sheraton Century Center for the mass wedding.
   The couples lined up in rows along the dance floor included the
very young and the middle-aged. Some men were decked out in
tuxedoes, but others showed up in jeans and sneakers; many of the
women wore elegant gowns.
   Everyone seemed to have a good time, and the mood was festive.
   ``It's fun. It's more relaxed,'' said Paul Arnold, who married
his wife of 7{ years, Debby, for the second time. They said that
after passing the seven-year mark, they felt it was time.
   The ceremony conducted by the Rev. Jack D. Denny was fairly
standard until the end.
   ``Kiss the bride!'' Denny ordered, and the music began.
   The crowd joined in as the band performed the ``Green Acres''
theme, with couples singing the men's and women's parts.

   It's tubular! Like, a dude at the Hawaii House
of Representatives wants the Postal Service to put out a stamp
honoring the daddy of surfing.
   According to Rep. Fred Hemmings, 1990 is, y'know, the 100th
birthday of Duke Paoa Kahinu Makoe Hulikohola Kahanamoku.
   Hemmings said Tuesday that surfing's father should get the same
respect as such sporting greats as Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig.
   The Legislature in 1985 passed a resolution asking the Postal
Service to issue a Kahanamoku commemorative, but the request wiped
out.
   Hemmings said Tuesday it's time to try again.
   ``We implore the United States Postal Service to recognize the
achievements of great Hawaiian athletes who may have participated
in sports not readily acknowledged by the Mainland states,'' he
said.

   An Indian activist pleaded guilty
Wednesday to 14 kidnap charges stemming from the armed seizure of a
newsroom in 1988 and was sentenced to 18 years in prison.
   Eddie Hatcher, 32, and fellow Tuscarora tribesman Timothy Jacobs
had claimed they were trying to draw attention to local law
enforcement's alleged involvement in drug dealing when they held up
to 20 people hostage at The Robesonian newspaper on Feb. 1, 1988.
   The pair, armed with shotguns, surrendered to the FBI after 10
hours.
   After Hatcher and Jacobs were tried and acquitted on federal
kidnapping charges, a Robeson County grand jury indicted them on
state charges. Jacobs pleaded guilty to kidnapping charges last
year and received a six-year sentence.
   Hatcher made no statement during Wednesday's court appearance.
He answered only ``yes'' or ``no'' as Superior Court Judge Coy
Brewer Jr. asked him about the plea bargain.
   The hearing contrasted with Hatcher's last appearance, when he
threw pens at a judge and called him a ``racist.''
   Defense attorney Barry Nakell said Hatcher, who faced a maximum
sentence of 420 years on the charges, had decided on his own to
seek the plea bargain. Nakell said the newspaper seizure had led to
some ``small measures of progress, but not the through
investigation the situation deserves.''
   District Attorney Richard Townsend said Hatcher and his
attorneys had created a ``media circus'' with their charges, but
none of them had been valid.
   ``There have been attempts to influence what happens in this
courtroom by making accusations, and the wilder the better,''
Townsend said. ``But the only accusations that have been found to
have any merit are the 14 charges of kidnapping in this case.''
   Townsend said Hatcher's flight from Robeson County to seek
asylum at two Indian reservations and the Soviet consulate in San
Francisco, combined with his charges of official corruption,
``sounds like a plotline from `Dallas' with `Meet the Press' thrown
in, and a dash of `Miami Vice.'''
   Townsend said the newspaper hostages had agreed to the plea
bargain.
   ``It certainly was acceptable to me,'' said Lee Hamilton, one of
The Robesonian reporters held. ``I definitely thought he (Hatcher)
would drag it out as long as he could and get all the attention he
could.''

<TEXT>
   West Germany approved $3.6 billion in
aid for East Germany on Wednesday to keep its economy afloat and
prevent its citizens from fleeing in frustration until the two
nations become one.
   An additional $1 billion was approved to resettle East Germans
who come to the West.
   Though the money is earmarked for specific East German programs,
none of it will go directly to the government of Communist Premier
Hans Modrow, who likely will be ousted when the country holds its
first free elections on March 18.
   Modrow, whose two-day summit here concluded Wednesday, had
requested $9 billion in immediate direct aid Tuesday but was turned
down by the government of Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
   Both leaders, however, hailed the landmark agreement by the
Soviet Union, the United States, France and Britain that sets up a
procedure for formal talks on reunification.
   The agreement by the four World War II Allies that defeated and
divided Germany 45 years ago is a diplomatic breakthrough and a
first step to a timetable for reunification.
   ``We see this as an exceptionally important development and a
great success for the West German foreign minister, an important
step toward German unity,'' Hanns Schumacher, a West German Foreign
Ministry spokesman, said Wednesday.
   Modrow told reporters in Bonn that he welcomed the announcement,
made during a meeting of Warsaw Pact and NATO nations Tuesday in
Ottawa, and considered it the best means of protecting both German
interests and those of the wartime allies.
   The accord follows Kohl's weekend visit to Moscow to meet with
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who tacitly approved Germany
reunification.
   The talks will take place in two parts. The two Germanys first
will discuss merging their economies and other domestic issues.
   The second phase is to include the four wartime powers and will
deal with the strategic and global implications of a united
Germany, particularly its military allegiance.
   East German is a key component of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact and
West Germany serves much the same role in NATO. The United States
wants to keep a united Germany in NATO, while the Soviets are
pressing for German neutrality.
   During the talks between the Germanys, West Germany has a
commanding position because of its vibrant economy, which will be
needed to bail out the financially ailing eastern state, where
thousands are fleeing to the West.
   Modrow, who spoke with West Germany industrial leaders on the
last day of his visit, told reporters before returning to East
Berlin that he was disappointed by Kohl's rejection of East
Germany's appeal for immediate aid.
   Government and opposition political forces had asked for up to
$9 billion to help the East German government until the election.
   West German Economics Minister Helmut Haussmann said Bonn turned
down the request because it ``makes no sense'' to grant loans or
credits to East Germany when so little is known of its economic
situation.
   However, Finance Minister Theo Waigel on Wednesday announced
Cabinet approval of $2.4 billion to modernize East Germany's aging
factories, repair roads, install a new phone system and other
``immediate measures'' to improve production and living standards.
   The 1990 budget supplement also provides $1 billion to cope with
the costs of tens of thousands of East Germans resettling in West
Germany, and an additional $1.2 billion for a contingency fund for
unforeseen expenses related to East German reforms.
   Haussmann told reporters that the bulk of the money would be
available immediately.
   But the funds are earmarked for specific projects and will not
be at Modrow's disposal to cover daily expenses and the East German
government's mounting debts.
   Modrow and Kohl did agree on Tuesday to establish a joint
commission to work out a formula for merging the two economic
systems after the March 18 elections. Bonn government spokesman
Norbert Schaefer said the group would hold its first talks on
Tuesday.

   Police fired tear gas Wednesday to stop a
second day of factional fights at a detention center among
Vietnamese boat people armed with stones and iron bars, officials
reported.
   Government spokeswoman Fanny Kong said at least 68 people had
been injured in the battles _ 38 boat people and 30 staff members
of the Correctional Services Department, which runs the camp.
   Violence has broken out before in the British colony's squalid
refugee camps, where about 44,000 people who fled their Communist
homeland have landed since mid-June 1988 in hopes of starting new
lives. Five people were killed in riots last year.
   In December, 51 Vietnamese were repatriated against their will,
leading to increased tension in the camps.
   About 70 Vietnamese rioted for nearly two hours Wednesday
morning in the Whitehead Detention Center. Some set fire to
dormitories before 300 police and correctional services
reinforcements reached the scene, Ms. Kong said.
   About 300 Vietnamese had taken part in a two-hour brawl the
previous night that also was stopped by police firing tear gas.
   Refugee coordinator Mike Hanson said most of the fighting was
between rival groups of Vietnamese from Haiphong and Quong Ninh,
and ``the spark for the latest disturbance seems to have been
thefts and revenge attacks.''
   Police found more than 500 homemade weapons, including iron bars
and knives, swords and spears made of scrap metal, window railings
and bed frames, a government statement said.
   The Vietnamese are considered illegal immigrants unless they can
prove they fled persecution. Those who are denied refugee status
and lose appeals can volunteer to go home or face forced
repatriation.
   Seventy-eight Vietnamese who fled to Hong Kong illegally
returned home voluntarily, the official Vietnam News Agency
reported.
   The group, the 12th to be repatriated from Hong Kong, arrived in
Hanoi on Tuesday, the agency said.

resignation, form new party faction. No pickup</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Industry Minister Ariel Sharon, who resigned
this week, said Wednesday he will form a new faction to pressure
his right-wing Likud bloc into taking a tougher stand on peace and
the Palestinian uprising.
   Attorney General Yosef Harish ruled earlier Wednesday that the
resignation was invalid because Sharon did not tell the government
of his plans before submitting a letter to Prime Minister Yitzhak
Shamir.
   That gives the former defense minister until the weekly Cabinet
meeting Sunday to reconsider, but Sharon said Wednesday he would
resubmit his resignation at the meeting. It would take affect 48
hours later.
   On Israel television, Sharon said: ``I must, according to
regulations, submit my resignation again. This I will do.''
   ``On the same day, I intend ... to announce that I will go out
and fight for a new policy and for achieving security. I got up
from my chair to begin marching so that in the future someone will
not say, `How come you didn't warn us of the coming disaster?'''
   On Monday, Sharon told the Cabinet his main reason for resigning
was to protest Shamir's plan for holding elections in the occupied
West Bank and Gaza Strip as a prelude to peace talks.
   He claimed Shamir had left an opening for possible PLO
involvement in negotiations by not ruling out Palestinians deported
by Israel during the 26-month-old uprising in the occupied lands.
   He also has urged the military to use harsher measures in the
territories.
   At least 656 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiers
during the uprising and 182 have been slain by other Palestinians,
most on suspicion of collaborating with Israel. Forty-three
Israelis have died.
   Sharon said he will visit local Likud branches to seek support
and will travel abroad to meet with leaders of Jewish communities.
He accused Shamir of leading ``a silent government that is
incapable of adopting any decisions.''
   Two Israeli sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
Foreign Minister Moshe Arens might stop in Washington later this
week on the way to Mexico.
   That could be a step toward a meeting Secretary of State James
A. Baker III has sought with Arens and Esmat Abdel-Meguid, the
Egyptian foreign minister, as a way of beginning talks between
Israel and Palestinians.
   Sharon, 62, directed Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon as
defense minister. He was forced to resign in 1983 when an Israeli
commission found he bore some responsiblity for the massacre of
hundreds of Palestinians in Beirut refugee camps by Lebanese
militias allied with Israel.
   Shamir's spokesman, Avi Pazner, indicated Wednesday the prime
minister did not want Sharon in the Cabinet and was seeking to
remove him as chairman of Likud's Central Committee.
   Associates of Shamir said he would have more room to maneuver in
the peace effort with Sharon out of the way.
   In another development Wednesday, the army reported that Israeli
soldiers killed a Palestinian guerrilla who infiltrated Israel's
border ``security zone'' in southern Lebanon, and allied militiamen
captured three of his comrades.
   It said the infiltrators were spotted at midday on the bridge to
Beaufort Castle, a Crusader fort three miles north of the border,
and ``their intention was to attack Israeli forces in the security
zone.'' Three infiltrators were killed in the same area Monday.

   The government raised its count of gray
whales along the Baja California coast Wednesday but said there
were still fewer whales than normal.
   It also said the main concentrations had gathered nearly 300
miles farther south than usual.
   ``In the southern part of the distribution zone more than 500
whales were observed,'' Luis Fleischer, head of the National Marine
Mammal Program, said in a statement by the Fisheries Department.
   The Ecology Department reported no more than 120 grays on Monday
in the Pacific waters of Baja California, where the marine mammals
migrate annually to reproduce. But department experts also said
that bad weather had limited a weekend survey.
   The grays ``continue to be behind schedule and we know that they
are arriving at points further south than usual, but we can't say
why,'' Fisheries Department spokesman Elias Kuri said Wednesday in
a telephone interview.
   The whales have traditionally given birth in three lagoons
within the Vizcaina Biosphere Reserve, 330 miles south of San
Diego, where a population of 900 to 1,150 can usually be observed
this time of year, reserve biologist Jorge Hernandez said.
   Some grays would travel to a lagoon about 260 miles farther
south called Magdalena Bay.
   However, Fleischer said the terfront corruption. ``They throw his name
around just to throw it around,'' Cutler said. ``It's a continuing
vendetta.''
   Gotti, who was acquitted last week for the third time in
criminal cases, and the other individuals face no criminal charges
in this case. The suit instead seeks to remove from office any ILA
officer convicted of violating federal racketeering laws, and to
allow appointment of trustees to oversee union elections and
discipline ILA officials.
   The defendants also could be forced to pay back illegal profits.
   ``We're trying to take the ILA away from the mob and give it
back to the ILA rank and file,'' said Fox, the FBI agent.
   The ILA locals named in the suit were Local 1804-1 of North
Bergen, N.J.; Local 1588 of Bayonne, N.J.; Local 814 in Brooklyn;
and Locals 1809, 824 and 1909, all in Manhattan on the West Side.
   According to the suit, the Genovese family controlled the New
Jersey locals; the Gambino family, the Brooklyn local; and the
Westies, through influence of the Gambino family, the Manhattan
locals.
   Thirty-two present and former ILA officials, including current
ILA president John Bowers, also were sued. In addition to his
position with the association, Bowers is president of the three
Manhattan locals named in the suit.
   Most of the allegations in the suit are based on previous
criminal cases. The guilty pleas two weeks ago in Brooklyn's
federal court of two ILA officials and the racketeering conviction
in 1988 of Donald Carson, the second highest ranking ILA official,
also were cited.
   Another case listed was the Westies racketeering prosecution of
1988 in which McElroy and other Westies members were convicted of
controlling the West Side piers through violence. Coonan is serving
a 75-year sentence.
   Leonard Newman, the executive director of the Waterfront
Commission of New York Harbor, said that despite the numerous
convictions of ILA officials, corruption continued. ``Out of office
is not out of power,'' he said.
   Thornburgh said the individual prosecutions were not successful
in removing the ``pervasive influence of organized crime'' from the
waterfront. He said the civil suit was needed to attack corruption
as ``a systemic problem.''
   The case is similar to one the federal government settled with
the International Brotherhood of Teamsters last year, in which the
government tried to wrest control from allegedly corrupt union
leaders through court-appointed administrators.
   Another suit against the union at Manhattan's landmark Fulton
Fish Market was unsuccessful. In January 1989 a judge rejected the
government's attempt to take over the union.
   The ILA suit was assigned to U.S. District Judge Leonard B.
Sand, who will hold a hearing on the case Feb. 26.

   America got a cold, wet kiss on Valentine's Day, with most of
the country dampened by snow, freezing rain or rain.
   Even normally sunny Southern California faced snow flurries,
hail, showers, fog and winds up to 52 mph that made travel
treacherous.
   Temperatures varied widely across the nation Wednesday.
Low-temperature records up to 62 years old were broken in eight
Western cities. In the Northeast, high-temperature marks were
snapped in four cities and tied in two others.
   Snow fell in sections of Illinois, Wisconsin, Iowa, Kansas,
Nebraska, Oklahoma, Arizona, Colorado, Wyoming, Idaho, Utah,
Montana, Washington state and Oregon. Snow mixed with freezing
rain, a mixture of freezing rain and rain, and rain stretched from
the Texas Panhandle to Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri, Illinois,
Indiana, Ohio and Pennsyvlania.
   The weather caused scores of traffic accidents in the Midwest,
and canceled or delayed a number of flights at Chicago's O'Hare
International and Midway airports, officials said.
   In Southern California, strong onshore winds, high waves and
choppy seas halted overnight cleanup work along beaches
contaminated by last week's 400,000-gallon oil spill and most
offshore oil skimming, officials said.
   High winds or snow grounded helicopters, stranded at least 30
tractor-trailers on Interstate 5 in a mountain pass linking
Southern California with the north called the Grapevine, and
prompted urgent road warnings. Winds hit 52 mph in Daggett about 90
miles northeast of downtown Los Angeles.
   In Los Angeles, rare hail and snow fell, but melted soon after
landing. At Malibu's Paradise Cove, a few minutes of snow drew
double takes from people at the Sand Castle restaurant near the
homes of Dick Clark and Johnny Carson, according to waitress Debbie
Alme.
   ``Everybody in the restaurant went, `Whoa! What's that?''' she
said. ``One lady thought they were filming a movie.''
   The weather forecast held unseasonably low temperatures for the
region Wednesday night, with wind chills as low as 30 below zero. A
warning for freezing temperatures was posted for the valleys.
   In addition to Southern California, wind warnings were posted
for Arizona. Gale warnings were in effect for much of the northern
Pacific Coast.
   Warnings of strong winds today were posted over the mountains of
southern California and central Arizona. Warning of gale force
winds tonight were also posted over much of the northern Pacific
Coast.
   Snowfall in the six hours ending at 1 p.m. EST included 3 inches
at Grand Junction, Colo., and an inch in Moline, Ill.
   Low-temperature records included 17 degrees in Olympia, Wash.,
where the old mark for the date had stood since 1928. Other records
included 20 degrees in Portland, Ore., 22 degrees in Seattle and 39
degrees in Oakland, Calif.
   Across the continent, high-temperature records up to 41 years
old were smashed. Cities where high marks were set included
Washington, D.C., (71 degrees, 70 in 1951); and Atlantic City,
N.J., (72, 67 in 1949). Philadelphia tied its 1946 record of 67
degrees.
   The low temperature for the Lower 48 states was 29 degrees below
zero in Ely and International Falls, Minn.
   Temperatures around the nation at 3 p.m. EST ranged from 0
degrees at Warroad, Minn., to 84 degrees in Sarasota, Fla.

   A small plane carrying five business
associates of Republican gubernatorial candidate Clayton Williams
crashed and burned in a rural area Wednesday, killing everyone
aboard, officials said.
   Williams put his campaign on hold and gathered the victims'
families at his home after learning of the morning crash five miles
south of Putnam, about 150 miles west of Dallas.
   ``All were business associates and dear, dear friends of
Clayton's. They were all based in Midland and flying from Midland
to Dallas on a business trip,'' said Mona Palmer, a campaign
spokesman for Williams.
   Williams is considered the Republican front-runner in a March 13
primary for the seat that will be vacated by Republican Gov. Bill
Clements.
   The victims were not members of Williams' campaign staff ``but
they were key advisors and key people to his campaign,'' Ms. Palmer
said.
   The wreckage was burning when it was spotted by a pipeline
patrol airplane, National Transportation Safety Board Regional
Director Tommy McFall said. He said it wasn't known if the fire
started before or after the crash.
   The pilot of the Mitsubishi MU-2 twin-engine turboprop had
requested a lower altitude from 15,000 feet, said Ray Wall, an
investigator with the NTSB in Fort Worth. The plane went off radar
after it reached 14,800, Wall said.
   NTSB investigator Warren Wandel, who was at the scene, said it
appeared the plane was out of control and crashed at high speed,
nose first.
   Ms. Palmer said the plane apparently hit a utility pole.
Reporters at the crash scene said the craft also hit power lines.
   The plane is owned by one of Williams' companies, Williams
Aviation.
   The victims were identified as: Jamie Winkel, 45, chief
executive officer of Clayton W. Williams Jr. Companies; Randy M.
Kidwell, 37, vice president for business development of Advanced
Telecommunications Corp. and a former Williams' employee; Robert
Smith, 62, president of R.R. Smith Consulting; Aaron Giebel, 63,
president of Aaron Giebel Petroleum Ltd.; and pilot Kenneth Mardis,
51. Smith and Giebel were board members for Williams' ClayDesta
National Bank.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain will confer with its European Community
partners about ending sanctions against South Africa, but it
reserves the right to act on its own, Foreign Office Minister
William Waldegrave said Wednesday.
   ``Of course we are obliged, and willingly would accept, the
obligation to consult with our partners in the EC, which is what we
will do,'' Waldegrave said in a House of Commons debate on South
Africa policy.
   ``If we fail to reach agreement the government must reserve its
rights to act on its own if necessary _ and that is the legal
position.''
   Earlier, Waldegrave's chief, Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd,
sidestepped persistent inquiries from Gerald Kaufman, foreign
policy spokesman for the opposition Labor Party, who wanted him to
say if the government would act unilaterally.
   Since Nelson Mandela, leader of the African National Congress,
was freed from prison on Sunday, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
has said she intends to try to get the 12-nation European Community
to drop a ban on new investment and on promoting tourism to South
Africa, both voluntary measures.
   She hinted she will go ahead alone if necessary.
   EC foreign ministers will discuss the issue Tuesday in Dublin,
Ireland.
   Kaufman called Mrs. Thatcher the ``world's best friend of
apartheid.''
   Hurd said the government firmly rejected South Africa's racial
segregation policy.
   ``It is wrong, it doesn't work, and the sooner it is ended the
better,'' Hurd said.
   Opposition lawmakers jeered Mrs. Thatcher on Tuesday when she
defended her position on sanctions. She did not participate in the
more subdued debate Wednesday.
   Labor Party leader Neil Kinnock said if sanctions were lifted,
the only force for change left in South Africa would be ``mass
action with all its risks.''
   Hurd said the government was not proposing to lift all
sanctions. ``What we are proposing is a step-by-step approach _ a
measured approach.''

<HEAD>Country's Only Nuclear Medicine Isotope Manufacturer Shut Down</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STERLING FOREST, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's principal maker of
radioactive isotopes for nuclear medicine was shut down
indefinitely because of a leak in its reactor cooling system, the
third in three months, officials said.
   The U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the state Department
of Environmental Conservation ordered the CintiChem reactor shut
down Tuesday until the company proves it can operate without
radioactive leaks, according to a joint statement.
   Tests showed none of the leaks were a threat to public health,
said Dr. Ronald Massey, head of the NRC's on-site inspection team.
   The company, located about 50 miles northwest of New York City,
manufactures radioactive isotopes _ unstable forms of ordinary
elements _ from uranium. The isotopes are made into medical tracers
for diagnosing cancer and other diseases.
   ``One out of every three or four people in the United States are
affected by what nuclear medicine does,'' said David Gallaher,
company operations director.
   An expert on nuclear medicine said Wednesday that hospitals and
other medical facilities would be searching for an alternate source
of technetium 99, the principal radioisotope used in nuclear
medicine.
   Technetium, which does not exist in nature, also is produced in
Canada and Europe, and may also be available from the U.S.
Department of Energy, said Dr. Stanley Goldsmith, a member of the
state Low-Level Radioactive Waste Siting Commission and a member of
the Physics-Nuclear Medicine Department at Mount Sinai Medical
Center.
   Goldsmith said CintiChem was ``the major producer of
radionuclides (isotopes) for medicine and biology for the northern
hemisphere, maybe north and south.''
   ``I think there is going to be a shuffling and hopefully there
will be provisions made,'' said Goldsmith. ``They probably have
supplies for a week of the short-lived material.''
   In a letter to company officials, the NRC acknowledged the
effects the suspension could have on nuclear medicine, said NRC
spokesman Steve Horwitz.
   ``Therefore, please keep the regional administrator informed of
the impact of this order on the ability of the medical community to
obtain radioisotopes,'' the letter said.
   All of the leaks were contained, and none allowed radioactive
material to reach the nearby Indian Kill Reservoir, which serves
more than 100 households, company officials said.
   The latest leak was found in a water tank that is part of the
reactor cooling system. It was confined to a pump room, said plant
manager James J. McGovern.
   The shutdown order requires CintiChem to determine causes of the
leaks and check for equipment breakdowns; show how repairs will be
done and prove that they will hold; and put together a monitoring
program to assure prompt detection of future leaks.
   In addition, the state DEC intends to delay approval of
CintiChem's air emissions and drainage runoff discharge permits
until the company does a detailed environmental audit for possible
on-site contamination.
   McGovern said much of the required repair work is underway.
   CintiChem also was cited for six violations of NRC regulations
in October. The company faces both federal and state fines, but has
challenged the citations.

<HEAD>Judge Orders Mistrial After Witness Says He Lied Under Pressure
From China</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A federal judge declared a mistrial in a
Chinese heroin-smuggling case Wednesday after a key prosecution
witness said he had lied under pressure and death threats from
Chinese officials.
   U.S. District Judge William Orrick halted proceedings in the
case against three men, accused in connection with $700,000 worth
of heroin found inside dead goldfish, after the witness recanted
his testimony and said he had been tortured in a Shanghai prison.
He is seeking asylum in the United States.
   The case, which dates from March 1988, was the first
international drug prosecution involving cooperation between
Chinese and U.S. officials.
   Orrick said the breakdown of the trial was ``proof positive you
can't meld the legal system in the People's Republic of China with
the legal system in the United States.''
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Eric Swenson told reporters Orrick's
conclusion was valid for this case, but ``I'm still confident that
this type of problem does not have to affect future cases. ... The
legal system in China is almost identical to many of the western
European systems.''
   No decision has been made on a retrial, Swenson said.
   Federal drug agents said in 1988 that seven pounds of Southeast
Asian heroin had been put inside condoms that were sewed into the
bodies of goldfish and mixed into shipments of live goldfish from
China to the United States. Three men arrested in San Francisco,
Leung Tak-Lun, Chico Wong and Andrew Wong, were charged with
possessing heroin with intent to distribute.
   The witness, Wang Zong-Xiao, was arrested in Shanghai in March
1988 and held there for most of the time until last December, when
he was brought to San Francisco. He testified Feb. 1 that he took
part in the heroin shipment along with Leung.
   But Wang filed for asylum four days later, saying he had been
threatened with death by officials from Shanghai who accompanied
him to the United States.
   He said in court papers that he had been coerced into confessing
and warned by the Chinese officials not to reveal the coercion or
the later beatings and electric shocks he was given; not to
contradict testimony of Shanghai security officers, and not to
disclose that students and workers were held and tortured in the
Shanghai prison.
   Wang returned to the witness stand Tuesday, outside the presence
of the jury, described his torture in China, and said he had lied
in his testimony that implicated Leung.
   Orrick said Wednesday he was declaring a mistrial because of the
allegations of perjured testimony, and because the Chinese
government had not provided defense lawyers before the trial with
Wang's earlier statements, as the judge's order required. After
those actions, any conviction in the case would surely be reversed
on appeal, he told the jury.
   He also noted that the two Shanghai officers who accompanied
Wang to San Francisco had returned suddenly to China on Sunday. ``I
don't think you'll be seeing them again,'' Orrick said.
   The judge issued an order last week prohibiting U.S. officials
from returning Wang to China while his asylum application is
pending. Cedric Chao, a lawyer appointed to represent Wang, said
the case for asylum is strong, and described Wang as ``at peace
with himself'' after his latest testimony.
   ``It would be unconscionable to send him back to China to face
certain death,'' Chao told reporters.

   Selma school officials said attendance
figures approached normal levels Wednesday and no major problems
occurred as students returned to classes a second day after a
weeklong shutdown.
   ``There were no fights and no arrests,'' James Carter, an aide
to the school superintendent, said of the 11 public schools closed
by racial protests.
   But the man whose contract termination prompted the protests,
Superintendent Norward Roussell, said Wednesday he will file a
federal lawsuit against the school board.
   ``I plan to protect my right under Title 7 of the 1964 Civil
Rights Act and to charge that the board's termination or failure to
extend my contract was racially motivated, among other things,''
said Roussell, the first black to hold the post in the historic
civil rights city.
   The protests began when white school board members refused to
extend Roussell's contract beyond June.
   Carter said 92 percent of the enrolled students attended classes
Wednesday.
   At Selma High School, where student protesters held a five-day
sit-in, 86 percent of the enrolled students were back in class. The
absenteeism rate of 14 percent was down significantly from
Tuesday's figures.
   Absenteeism in the city school system is normally around five
percent, according to Roussell. It was 23 percent Tuesday, when
schools reopened amid heavy security, and down to eight percent
Wednesday.
   Roussell said he hopes that all parents will soon return their
children to school and that the schools, guarded by police,
National Guardsmen and state troopers, will soon ``no longer look
like armed camps.''
   Most of the absentees have been blacks, including about 150 who
marched around the flagpole in front of Selma High School on
Tuesday and chanted slogans.

<HEAD>Thousands Murdered in Sri Lanka, Amnesty International Reports</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of people disappeared or were murdered
by government forces, death squads and insurgents in Sri Lanka last
year, Amnesty International said in a report released early
Thursday.
   Reports of killings increased sharply after emergency
regulations introduced in June 1989 permitted the immediate
disposal of bodies, the London-based human rights group said.
   ``Members of the security forces who commit murder are aided and
abetted by these regulations,'' the group's report said.
   Amensty International acknowledged the government faces
extensive violent opposition.
   ``Nevertheless, armed opposition violence can never justify
torture or deliberate killings of prisoners and civilians by
government forces,'' the report said.
   It said the tactics of Sri Lankan security forces and allied
death squads ``increasingly mirrored the criminal violence of the
armed opposition Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (People's Liberation
Front).''
   The front is a Sinhalese nationalist group opposed to the
Sinhalese-dominated government's 1987 peace plan with the Tamils in
the northeast.
   The Sinhalese group, according to the report, is believed to be
responsible for thousands of murders since it began its insurgency
in the south in 1987.
   ``Thousands of prisoners were detained in the south without
charge or trial under emergency regulations and there were
widespread allegations of torture and deaths in custody,'' Amnesty
International said.
   In the northeast, Indian troops who were sent to enforce the
peace plan were reported to have committed summary executions and
``there were numerous allegations of torture of prisoners by
members of the (Indian force),'' the report said. The last of the
Indian troops are to be withdrawn by the end of March.
   Amnesty International also said the guerrilla group the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ``were generally believed
responsible for hundreds of murders, including the killing of
prisoners and civilians.''
   The Liberation Tigers oppose the Indian troop presence and are
fighting for autonomy.
   Tamils comprise about 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16 million
population. Most Tamils are Hindus and they say they are
discriminated against by the Buddhist Sinhalese majority.
   Nationwide ``it is impossible to estimate the true number of
victims, and although some bodies were identified by relatives, the
identities of many remain unknown,'' Amnesty International said.
   ``Hundreds of victims have been mutilated beyond recognition,
burnt in heaps on tires or in pits, or have been thrown into
rivers,'' it said.
   Amnesty International said the victims included lawyers who had
taken up human rights cases and witnesses to alleged cases of human
rights violations.

   Friends say she's no homewrecker. Her agent says
she's got nothing to do with it. And the media are ready to tell
you everything you ever wanted _ or didn't want _ to know about
actress Marla Maples, who's been thrust center stage in the battle
of the Trumps.
   For instance: Did you know her most unsung attribute from the
knees down is her feet?
   This timely nugget comes in a New York Post story on Wednesday
headlined: ``Tale of the tape in the battle of the belles,'' which
gives scintillating facts like Ivana Trump's dress size (6) and Ms.
Maples' weight (125).
   Mrs. Trump's most unsung attribute, by the way, is her toenails.
   Are we getting silly yet?
   Billionaire developer Donald Trump officially left the couple's
penthouse Sunday.
   On Monday, we learned of the prenuptial agreement that would
give Ivana $25 million, custody of the Trumps' three children, and
their Connecticut mansion.
   Tuesday's headlines said Ivana wanted more: the jet, the Plaza
Hotel and $150 million. Mrs. Trump pooh-poohed the latter, calling
it a ``figment of someone's imagination,'' and told Daily News
columnist Liz Smith all she wanted was a fair, equitable share of
Trump's estimated $1.7 billion fortune.
   On Wednesday, Trump tried to explain the breakup, saying, ``I
have always loved Ivana. Unfortunately, we have grown apart.''
   Mrs. Trump said nothing, even when confronted by a horde of
reporters and cameras at her 41st birthday party at an expensive
French restaurant.
   Blanketed by Trump security men, she looked upset and scared.
   Some in the crowd applauded as the fur-clad Mrs. Trump alighted
from her jet-black Mercedes, and several women shouted their
advice: ``Get the money, Ivana.''
   ``She was tickled,'' columnist Smith, who attended the lunch,
said afterward. ``I mean, I don't think she expected it.''
   About 15 socialite friends and relatives, including Trump's
mother, Mary, and sister-in-law, Blaine, showed up but had little
or nothing to say.
   ``Nobody spoke ill of Donald,'' said TV personality Barbara
Walters, another lunch guest. ``There was a lot of laughing and a
lot of good will.''
   To say New Yorkers are interested in the Trump split's seamy
details is putting it mildly.
   The city's three tabloids on Wednesday devoted a total of 13
inside and two front pages to the breakup of the couple's nearly
13-year marriage.
   The media have also descended on Ms. Maples' hometown of Dalton,
Ga., the self-proclaimed carpet capital of the world, and inundated
her parents with queries about their only daughter's life.
   Anyone who ever knew the 26-year-old actress is being asked for
an opinion on the Trump split and Ms. Maples' alleged role.
   ``Heavens to Betsy, she's no homewrecker,'' said Margaret
Culberson of Dalton, who coached Ms. Maples in a regional Miss
Georgia Teen pageant. ``She's one of the sweetest persons you've
ever seen.''
   The actress, a former bikini-clad pinup for Delta Air Lines'
``Fly Florida'' campaign, found herself at the center of the Trump
storm after published reports had her arguing with Mrs. Trump
during an Aspen, Colo., vacation.
   Even the venerable Fifth Avenue church where the Trumps were
married became part of the story. Ms. Maples met Trump at Marble
Collegiate Church, and the two sat together fairly regularly, a
source who spoke on condition of anonymity told The Associated
Press.
   About 14 months ago, Trump sought counseling from Arthur
Caliandro, the church's minister, about his relationship with Ms.
Maples, according to the source who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``He (Trump) was quite broken up'' over the emotional conflicts
between the relationship and his marriage, the source said. Trump
had decided at the time it would be best for all concerned if he
stopped seeing Ms. Maples.
   There were also reports that Trump paid for Ms. Maples' room at
the St. Moritz hotel (which he once owned) and that the actress,
who has had only small walk-on parts on TV and one forgettable
movie, is ready to marry him.
   All of this, said her agent, Chuck Jones, is garbage.
   Jones said he paid for her room at the St. Moritz, where she
filmed a soda commercial. ``It was a job,'' he said.
   ``She has nothing to do with this,'' Jones said. ``She doesn't
need the publicity and doesn't want it.''
   If she was a certain type of person, Jones said, Ms. Maples
could capitalize on the brouhaha.
   ``She was just offered $250,000 by the National Enquirer to tell
her story but since there's no story to tell, she turned them
down,'' he said.
   ``She's not interested and she's gotten plenty of offers for
work,'' said Jones.
   He said all the media attention is ``a disservice to Ivana and
Donald Trump because they're good people. They don't deserve it.
... and Marla Maples doesn't deserve it, either. She's got too much
class.''

   A police patrol killed 19 Shining Path rebels
in a jungle battle, the interior ministry said Wednesday.
   According to a statement issued by the ministry, a police patrol
encountered the rebel column Tuesday morning near Andamarca, 165
miles east of Lima. An ensuing firefight left 19 guerrillas dead,
the report said. No casualties were reported among the police.
   Police later found an arms cache that included automatic weapons
and 250 sticks of dynamite, the interior ministry said.
   Also Wednesday, police in Ayacucho, 235 miles southeast of Lima,
said six Shining Path rebels broke into the home of an education
ministry employee Tuesday night and shot her in the head.
   Police identified the woman as Dolores Chavez, 50, a teacher and
deputy director of the education ministry in Ayacucho state.
   The government says more than 17,500 people have died since the
Shining Path launched its armed insurgency in 1980, including
police, soldiers, rebels, government officials and civilians.

   CBS said Wednesday it plans to build two new
studios worth more than $15 million at its Television City center
in Los Angeles, the largest expansion of its production facilities
in 20 years.
   The studios mainly will be used for the production of situation
comedies, but also for daytime shows on weekends, CBS said.
Construction is expected to take about 18 months.
   The network's Television City currently has five studios. CBS
also co-owns a television production center with MTM Productions at
the old Republic Studios in Studio City, Calif., and has its own
Broadcast Center in New York, where the network produces news
programs and daytime shows.

   President Bush will refuse to meet with
Peruvian coca growers at the Colombian drug summit and will travel
to Cartagena with a sharply reduced staff because of concerns for
his safety, White House officials said Wednesday.
   On the eve of the one-day meeting of four hemispheric nations,
the White House also retreated from previous suggestions that Bush
would revive a proposal to send U.S. Navy warships into South
American waters to track cocaine-trafficking planes.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater denounced the
kidnapping of two American citizens in Colombia on Tuesday by
leftist guerrillas who said they were protesting Bush's impending
visit.
   While saying that Bush shared concerns over the two Americans'
safety, Fitzwater asserted that ``the United States government
cannot allw threats of terrorism to influence its policies or its
activities.''
   Bush will fly to Colombia early Thursday, joining Presidents
Virgilio Barco of Colombia, Jaime Paz Zamora of Bolivia and Alan
Garcia of Peru for six hours of anti-drug talks at a heavily
guarded navy base at Cartagena.
   The four leaders plan to issue a joint statement pledging to
cooperate in the fight against drug trafficking. Bush's summit
partners were expected to press him for more economic aid to ease
their farmers' shift from lucrative coca plants _ used to produce
cocaine _ to growing legal crops.
   The United States has pledged a $206 million increase in
spending on military, law enforcement and economic assistance for
Peru, Colombia and Bolivia next year, as part of a five-year, $2.2
billion Andean aid package.
   Garcia, who had once threatened to boycott the summit because of
the U.S. invasion of Panama, has invited a group of Peruvian coca
growers to accompany him to the Cartagena summit to underscore the
economic impact of eradicating cocaine production, Fitzwater said.
   ``We have no opinion of that,'' Fitzwater said. ``He can take
anybody he wants. That's fine.''
   But Fitzwater said Bush would not meet with the coca growers and
indicated that the United States does not want the growers to
attend the summit sessions.
   `This is a summit meeting between the heads of state,''
Fitzwater said. ``There will not be other ancilliary kinds of
activities involved.''
   On the issue of U.S. naval warships in South American waters,
Fitzwater would not rule out the possibility of a summit discussion
of using U.S. vessels. But he said Bush did not intend to raise the
subject because it is such a sensitive issue in Latin America,
particularly since the Panama invasion.
   Brent Scowcroft, the White House national security adviser, had
broached the idea Tuesday during a meeting with reporters.
Fitzwater said resulting press accounts had caused ``some
consternation'' among U.S. officials who were worried about how
Scowcroft's remarks might be interpreted in Latin America.
   ``There will be no military assistance for drug fighting to any
country that is not requested by them, coordinated through them and
executed in support of their counternarcotic objectives,''
Fitzwater said.
   NBC reported Wednesday that the United States is setting up an
``electronic picket fence'' in the air and on the ground to monitor
suspected drug flights from Colombia. The report said the U.S.
forces are supposed to spot the planes and the Colombian forces
will chase them.
   NBC, citing American military sources, said American cargo
planes and as many as 160 U.S. soldiers already are on the ground
in Colombia.
   White House spokeswoman Alixe Glen said she knew nothing about
the NBC report.
   Despite stringent security precautions being taken in Colombia,
there were deep concerns about protecting Bush in a country where
drug lords are blamed for widescale bombings, assassinations and
other violence.
   Fitzwater said the United States has ``every assurances of
safety and maximum security'' from Colombian officials.
   ``I think, however, that it is clear from the past history that
one cannot rule out various kinds of activities at some location,''
he said.
   Fitzwater said Bush's official entourage has been reduced to ``a
minimal staff'' and that the usual backup plane for other traveling
aides has been eliminated.
   Fitzwater said the purpose was ``to eliminate any excess
personnel and for security reasons, to simply not have any more
people there than is absolutely necessary.''
   Bush will be accompanied by Secretary of State James A. Baker
III, White House chief of staff John Sununu, Scowcroft, drug policy
director William Bennett, Fitzwater and a handful of other aides.

<HEAD>Innocent Plea Entered For Man Accused Of Rebecca Schaeffer Slaying</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge entered an innocent plea Wednesday
for a man accused of stalking and killing actress Rebecca
Schaeffer, despite protests that the defendant was extradited
illegally.
   Deputy Public Defender Stephen Galindo refused to enter a plea
on his client's behalf, stating that John Bardo's extradition from
Arizona to California was a mistake and the court therefore had no
jurisdiction.
   ``His transportation was in fact illegal and in violation of
both Arizona and California codes and federal procedures,'' said
Galindo, who has asked that the case be dismissed.
   Superior Court Judge Gary Klausner entered the plea and a denial
of a special circumstance allegation of lying in wait. If convicted
of murder and the allegation, Bardo could be sentenced to death in
the gas chamber.
   Klausner set a pretrial hearing March 1 before Superior Court
Judge Jacqueline Connor, said Sandi Gibbons, a district attorney's
office spokeswoman.
   ``The court is taking the position that it wants to hurry this
thing along,'' Galindo said.
   Miss Schaeffer, 21, a co-star in the TV series ``My Sister
Sam,'' was gunned down at the front door of her apartment on July
18, 1989.
   Bardo was arrested the next day in Tucson, Ariz., as the
19-year-old man ran in and out of traffic on an interstate highway
in what may have been a suicide attempt.
   District Attorney Ira Reiner announced Aug. 10, 1989, that his
office had seized on an inadvertent mistake in the paperwork by
Bardo's Tucson lawyer to move in and spirit the defendant out of
Arizona overnight.
   Deputy District Attorney Marcia Clark, who has said the
unorthodox transfer would not have any impact on prosecution, said
Wednesday that since Bardo is here now, Galindo's arguments
regarding extradition are moot.
   Bardo, clothed in jeans and T-shirt, stayed silent through
Wednesday's proceedings. Galindo said Bardo, of Tucson, has been
medicated from time to time while in custody. He did not know what
kind of medicine his client was taking.

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Najib pleaded anew to Afghan
opposition forces to enter into peace talks in an address to the
nation on the eve of the first anniversary of the Soviet withdrawal
from Afghanistan.
   Soviet Foreign Ministry Eduard Shevardnadze meanwhile offered in
Moscow to discuss removal of the stockpiles of weapons his country
has sent to Afghanistan.
   The United States has long refused to consider halting its arms
shipments to the Moslem guerrillas because it says the Soviets
built up enormous arsenals for the Najib regime.
   Shevardnadze also suggested a conference on Afghanistan to
include representatives of the various Afghan groups, the United
States, the Soviet Union, Iran and Pakistan, with U.N.
representatives participating.
   Najib offered the guerrillas a six-month cease-fire and said his
troops would stop firing long-range Scud missiles if the guerrillas
stopped firing rockets at Kabul and other cities.
   So far the guerrillas have rejected all truces offered by Kabul
and have refused all negotiations with Najib and his People's
Democratic Party of Afghanistan.
   There was little in Najib's invitation that seemed likely to
entice them to give up their nearly 12-year-old attempt to oust the
ruling party, which took power by coup in 1978.
   The guerrillas, whose headquarters are across the borders in
Pakistan and Iran, call themselves mujahedeen, or Islamic holy
warriors.
   Najib took office in 1986. He is one of four successive
Soviet-backed leaders to run Afghanistan through a series of
internal party coups and power struggles.
   Soviet troops entered Afghanistan in December 1979 to prop up
its faltering protege party and started withdrawing in May 1988
under a U.N.-sponsored accord. The last Red Army combat troops
crossed the border back to the Soviet Union on Feb. 15, 1989.
   The Aghan president, former head of the dreaded Khad secret
police, again proposed creating a national council that would form
a broad-based coalition government. He called for new parliamentary
elections. They would be held ``without resort to force for
influencing them'' and the results would be respected by the Kabul
government, he said.
   Najib also said his government ``places enormous value to the
role of the United Nations ... and is ready for cooperation with
whatever outline the U.N. may table.''
   He did not address the question of whether he himself would step
aside during any peace talks. But about four hours before his
speech was broadcast by state-run television, Najmuddin Kawyani, a
member of his party's powerful Politburo, dismissed this idea.
   Kawyani told foreign reporters there could be no preconditions
to any talks.
   News reports before and after U.S. Secretary of State James
Baker III's visit to Moscow last week said the Americans would drop
their demand that Najib resign before any peace negotiations began
_ provided he was gone before the talks ended.
   ``During the talks, the results of the talks should be clear,''
Kawyani said. ``It should be decided who should go. If the
Americans determine the results before the talks, that ... (Najib)
should go, then the talks will be for what?''
   Najib proposed sending a Kabul delegation to talk to mujahedeen
leaders in Peshawar and Quetta in Pakistan. He said the delegation
should also visit Tehran, Iran, where a second mujahedeen alliance
is based, and to Europe, where Afghan exiles opposed to both the
Najib government and the mujahedeen live.
   He said if the opposition refused to accept representatives of
his government or party, the delegation could consist of clergymen,
scholars and intellectuals with no affiliations.
   The mujahedeen rejected similar offers in the past, considering
any delegates who might be sent from Kabul as nothing more than
Najib's henchmen.
   He also invited the guerrillas to come to Kabul and said ``they
are not required, at the first stage, to meet state and party
authorities in Afghanistan.''
   He offered restructuring of the economy with a movement away
from state control of investment and enterprise.
   Najib said the United States, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia
continued to arm the mujahedeen and denounced them for it.
   An English translation of Najib's spech, delivered in Kabul's
Persian Dari language, was provided by the Foreign Ministry's press
center.
   Kabul complained Wednesday in a letter to the U.N. Security
Council that Pakistan and the United States were intensifying
aggression against Afghanistan in violation of accords aimed at
ending the war.
   It said Pakistan was helping in the shipment of military
supplies and training for the rebels, and that the United States
was delivering advanced weapons.
   A spokesman at the Pakistan U.N. Mission denied the allegations
and called them part of a propaganda campaign to divert attention
from Kabul's problems. A State Department official said Afghanistan
has made similar statements in the past and that Washington saw no
merit in the allegations.

<BYLINE>Police Chief Accuses Israeli of Airline Bombing
^By STAN YARBRO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Retired Israeli Col. Yair Klein, accused
of training drug traffickers' paramilitary squads, trained the men
who placed a bomb aboard a airliner that killed all 107 aboard last
fall, the head of Colombia's intelligence police said Wednesday
night.
   ``This is the person who has done the most damage to Colombia,''
and according to Colombian law is responsible for the deaths, said
the police chief, Gen. Miguel Maza Marquez, in a news conference in
the city of Cartagena.
   Cartagena is the site for Thursday's drug summit to be attended
by President Bush of the United States and Presidents Virgilio
Barco of Colombia, Jaime Paz of Bolivia and Alan Garcia of Peru.
   Last year Colombian authorities issued an arrest warrant for
Klein, whom they accused of leading a team of Israeli, British and
Australian mercenaries in Colombia.
   Colombian police seized films of the group training paramilitary
squads and said that drug traffickers paid the mercenaries to give
the courses.
   Maza said that some of the men receiving training later blew up
the Avianca 727 shortly after taking off from Bogota on a domestic
flight Nov. 27.
   The attack was one of over 262 terrorist actions contracted by
drug traffickers since the government intensified a campaign
against them last August. More than 200 people died in the attacks.
   ``Klein was the man who trained the actual perpetrators of the
Avianca airline attack,'' Maza said. ``He was the one who taught
them how to make the bomb and therefore is responsible under
Colombian criminal law for this atrocious crime.''
   Klein is living in Israel and is being investigated by that
country's authorities. There is no extradition agreement between
Israel and Colombia.
   Maza said that two of the suspects in the airliner bombing were
killed in a chain of Bogota massacres following the death of
Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, a leader of the Medellin drug cartel, in a
Dec. 15 gunfight with police.
   A joint operation carried out by Colombian police and Interpol,
the international police agency, uncovered evidence that two Basque
separatists belonging to ETA, the Basque terrorist organization,
also had carried out terrorist activities in Colombia, Maza said.
   He accused the two men of carrying out a Dec. 6 bombing of the
intelligence police headquarters in Bogota in which 63 persons
died. He would not identify the suspects because he said the
investigation of their activities was continuing.
   But he said they had been hired by the Medellin cartel to kill
him. Police have said that Maza, in the headquarters at the time,
was the target of the bombing.
   Maza also announced that Colombia and Spain would sign an
agreement next week to share information about traffickers. He has
predicted that Spain could become the European Colombia because
traffickers had chosen it as a distribution point for cocaine
shipments from Latin America.

   About 30 inmates escaped Thursday
from the Modelo Prison in the capital, but some were recaptured
within a few hours, the warden said.
   Capt. Alberto Soto told reporters the inmates fled in small
groups during visiting hours and while a group of human rights
observers were touring the jail.
   Soto refused to give further details other than to say some
prisoners had been recaptured, and other government authorities
refused to answer reporters' questions.
   Soto also refused to say to which group the human rights
observers belonged.
   A few hours later, reporters saw five people who appeared to be
escapees being driven back to the jail in military vehicles.
   It was not known if any of the escapees were members of dictator
Manuel Antonio Noriega's Defense Forces, which were disbanded after
he was overthrown by the U.S. invasion in December.
   Modelo Prison, in the capital's Chorrillo neighborhood, holds
about 900 inmates but was built with a capacity for only 250.

<HEAD>Michigan, South Carolina Senates Pass Abortion Restrictions</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES throughout with South Carolina Senate approving
parental consent bill, details, ADDS Michigan party affiliations,
New Hampshire House approving abortion bill. No pickup.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM JOHNSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Michigan's Senate on Wednesday overwhelmingly passed a bill
requiring minors to get permission from a parent or judge before
having an abortion, and South Carolina senators unanimously
approved similar legislation with a twist.
   Under South Carolina's bill, parents who deny a daughter's
request for an abortion would have to share legal and financial
responsibility for her child until the young mother turns 18.
   The Michigan legislation, adopted 29-8, now goes to the House,
which is expected to pass the restriction.
   However, Democratic Gov. James Blanchard is expected to veto the
bill, setting up an override battle or an attempt by anti-abortion
forces to enact such a law through a petition drive.
   The measure adopted Wednesday would allow a girl under 18 to
seek a probate court order allowing an abortion if she couldn't get
the permission of a parent or adult guardian.
   It is the first anti-abortion legislation to advance in Michigan
since the U.S. Supreme Court in July gave states more power to
restrict abortions. Pennsylvania last fall adopted the nation's
toughest abortion law, but many of its provisions have been put on
hold because of a challenge from abortion-rights groups.
   ``I'm very positive the House will accept what we've done,''
said Republican Sen. Fred Dillingham, manager of the bill in the
Senate.
   ``Michigan wants and needs protection for parents and for minors
with problem pregnancies,'' Barbara Listing, president of Right to
Life of Michigan, said in a statement.
   The Senate rejected amendments offered by minority Democrats who
called the bill too harsh. The most substantive would permit
consent by another family member and require counseling. Another
would allow an abortion in cases of rape or incest.
   The bill generated some heated debate, although the outcome was
assured.
   ``Today will be a day of infamy for this body,'' said Sen. John
Kelly, a Democrat. ``We're going to have to live with the despair,
the suicides, the back-alley abortions. These young people have
committed no crime.''
   South Carolina's bill, passed unanimously on a voice vote, is
also the first since the U.S. Supreme Court's decision.
   The state already has a law requiring girls under 16 to obtain a
parent's consent for an abortion, but similar laws without a
judicial consent option have been declared unconstitutional in
other states and South Carolina's ordinance has not been enforced.
   Under the bill passed Wednesday, girls under the age of 17 could
obtain permission for an abortion from a grandparent or guardian in
addition to a parent or judge.
   ``It's not everything that we wanted, but it's much of what we
wanted,'' said Sen. David Thomas, a Democrat and an abortion
opponent. ``This is the best I could have hoped for.''
   Abortion foes had opposed any Senate amendments to a bill passed
by the House last year allowing only parents or a judge to give
consent, but were forced to accept compromises on who could approve
an abortion and on the issue of responsibility.
   ``Overall, we were realistic. We knew the state was not going to
break with precedent,'' said Inez Tenenbaum, a lobbyist for South
Carolina Coalition For Choice. ``If anything, we're very encouraged
that we got some positive changes in the current law.''
   The bill now returns to the House, which can either accept the
Senate amendments or work with Senators on a compromise bill to
submit to both chambers. Republican Gov. Carroll Campbell has
promised to approve abortion restrictions.
   On Tuesday, New Hampshire's House approved 212-148 a bill to
allow abortions until the 25th week of pregnancy and in
health-related situations afterward.
   The bill goes to the Senate, which is not expected to take up
the bill until at least March. Republican Gov. Judd Gregg has
promised to veto the bill.

<HEAD>Soviet Legislators Pay First Visit to NATO</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A delegation of Soviet legislators
Wednesday became the first lawmakers from their country to visit
the NATO military alliance, and it urged more talks in the future.
   Valentin Falin, a member of the Supreme Soviet's international
affairs committee, said the group had ``very substantive
discussions'' with NATO Secretary-General Manfred Woerner.
   ``The discussion was a rather open one. I think we need such
kind of discussions,'' he told reporters after the hourlong meeting
at the headquarters of the 16-nation North Atlantic Treaty
Organization.
   ``Moreover, both sides came to the conclusion that there is a
need for a series of such discussions so that we understand each
other better,'' Falin said, speaking through a translator.
   He also said talks were needed ``so that we have a clearer
vision of things to come. On this particular subject both sides
have much in common in their appraisal and also have to seek ways
to achieve these objectives.''
   Falin said the officials only discussed the sensitive topic of
the reunification of West and East Germanys in an ``indirect
manner. It was not a precise subject of discussion.''
   Also in the delegation was Marshal Sergei Akhromeyev, a key
adviser to Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and former chief
of staff of the Soviet armed forces.
   Late last year, Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze made
a historic visit to NATO, becoming the first Soviet foreign
minister ever to do so.

<TEXT>
   The skipper of the Exxon Valdez thought
the seaman who was at the tanker's helm when it ran aground had
problems steering and warned others to watch over him, the ship's
second mate testified Wednesday.
   Both Capt. Joseph Hazelwood and third mate Gregory Cousins
talked about problems with Robert Kagan's steering of the ship,
second mate Lloyd LeCain Jr. testified at Hazelwood's trial.
   ``How would you rate Mr. Kagan's abilities?'' the prosecutor
asked LeCain.
   ``I'd say slightly below normal,'' LeCain said. ``I talked to
Capt. Hazelwood about it. He knew he had a problem. He told me to
keep an eye on him when he was steering.''
   LeCain claimed that Cousins, whom Hazelwood had left in charge
of the ship, had been on previous voyages with Kagan and knew he
had to be watched. Cousins, however, testified he had never sailed
with Kagan before the fateful trip.
   The March 24 accident, the worst oil spill in U.S. history,
caused more than 10 million gallons of Alaska North Slope crude oil
to spill into the clear waters of Prince William Sound.
   Outside the jury's presence, Hazelwood's lawyer, Dick Madson,
said that that Exxon had placed LeCain on leave because of mental
and emotional problems, and that LeCain was known for making up
wild stories and claims.
   ``He has a problem with fantasy,'' Madson told Superior Court
Judge Karl Johnstone. He said LeCain once told Hazelwood he kept
two cyanide pills with him in case he had to commit suicide and
that he was ``Ninja-trained.'' LeCain also had claimed involvement
in the Iran-Contra affair, Madson said.
   Johnstone said he would not permit Madson to tell this to the
jury because it was ``character evidence'' prohibited by Alaska law.
   Hazelwood, 43, of Huntington, N.Y., is charged with one felony
count of second-degree criminal mischief and misdemeanor charges of
reckless endangerment, negligent discharge of oil and operating a
vessel while intoxicated. The maximum penalty for conviction on all
counts is 7\ years in prison and $61,000 in fines.
   Kagan, who was blamed by Cousins for not steering the ship
properly, had told jurors the captain commended him for his
handling of the wheel in the wake of the accident.
   But Cousins testified earlier Wednesday that the comment
attributed to Hazelwood actually was typical of the captain's
sarcasm.
   ``Did you hear the captain say anything to Kagan?'' asked Madson.
   ``Yes,'' said Cousins. ``I remember the comment, something to
the effect of, `Damn fine job, Bob.'''
   ``And did you take that as serious or sarcasm?'' asked the
lawyer.
   ``Kind of dark humor,'' said the witness.
   Cousins also contradicted two widely circulated reports that
followed the accident. He said the ship was not on autopilot in the
minutes before it ran aground. And he said Hazelwood never tried to
reverse in an effort to pull the tanker off the reef.
   Cousins said he realized Hazelwood ``was in shock,'' as was the
rest of the tanker crew, after the vessel ran aground and caused
what became the nation's worst oil spill.
   Hazelwood's first order to him ``was to get a fix'' on the
ship's location, Cousins said.
   ``Did that seem a prudent command?'' asked Madson.
   ``Yes, we needed to know where we were on the reef,'' said
Cousins.
   Madson then asked whether Hazelwood seemed able to give ``clear,
concise commands,'' and Cousins said he did.
   Madson asked whether any of the engine commands required
reversing position.
   Cousins said, ``No,'' indicating that Hazelwood ordered the ship
to move forward. Madson asked whether an order to reverse would
have been proper if Hazelwood was trying to get off the reef.
   ``That would make sense,'' said Cousins. ``But my experience in
being on a reef is very limited. This was the first.''
   His comment drew laughter in the courtroom.
   He added, ``It makes sense that if you plow into a pile of
rocks, the way to get off is back off.''
   Other witnesses, however, have said that had Hazelwood succeeded
in reversing the ship and backing off, it probably would have
capsized, causing a worse oil spill and possibly a loss of life.
   His lawyers contend he left clear instructions for an ice
diversion maneuver and that if his instructions had been followed,
the ship would have moved smoothly past Bligh Reef. Hazelwood was
fired by Exxon after the spill.
   Cousins, 39, a veteran seaman, said he was on the phone with
Hazelwood at the moment the Exxon Valdez went aground.
   Cousins said that although Hazelwood had left the bridge 10
minutes before the accident, his office was a mere 15 seconds away.

<TEXT>
   Colombia's four main labor
federations denounced President Bush's visit and prompted marches
in at least three cities Wednesday to protest his trip and this
country's economic policies.
   Police clashed with students in one demonstration, held after
the unions issued a joint statement on the eve of Thursday's
anti-drug summit in Cartagena to be attended by presidents Bush,
Virgilio Barco of Colombia, Jaime Paz Zamora of Bolivia and Alan
Garcia of Peru.
   Paz flew into Cartagena late Wednesday and praised Bush for
making cocaine trafficking a top priority of his administration.
   ``He best understands the dimensions of the drug problem,'' Paz
told reporters at the airport.
   Cartagena was under intense security to guard against possible
attack by drug traffickers or leftist guerrillas. Colombian
newspapers have said about 5,000 members of Colombian security
forces were assigned to the Cartagena area.
   All vehicles entering Cartagena were searched Wednesday, and
Colombian marines stopped cars at roadblocks to look for weapons.
   Witnesses estimated a few thousand people took part in a
peaceful march called by labor officials in Bogota, the capital.
Other marches took place in Medellin, home of the infamous Medellin
drug cartel, and in the northern city of Cucuta.
   Workers marching in Bogota with ``Bush go home'' banners burned
an American flag, but rigid police control had been ordered to
prevent violence and none was reported.
   About 100 demonstrators clashed with police near the National
Univerisity of Colombia in Bogota, but no injuries were reported.
Police shot tear gas at students throwing stones, witnesses said.
   The union statement, issued in Bogota, condemned the U.S.
invasion of Panama in December and declared:
   ``For this and 1,000 more reasons ... we are not happy with the
visit to the country of the U.S. president. ... Colombians will not
applaud the (U.S.) Marines in any Latin American country, much less
in our own territory.''
   The unions ordered the marches to protest Bush's visit and the
government's free-market-oriented economic policies.
   About 3 million workers out of a total labor force of 10 million
belong to the four unions, which represent a wide range of
political forces.
   Jorge Carrera Rojas, president of the Colombian Central Workers
Union, told Bogota marchers, ``When President John F. Kennedy
visited Colombia more than 25 years ago he brought something for
us: Houses were built all over Colombia. I'd like to ask what is
Mr. Bush bringing in to our people.''
   He was referring to Kennedy's Alliance for Progress program for
Latin America that assigned priority to housing for the poor
throughout the continent.
   Colombian marines with assault rifles and grenades, meanwhile,
surrounded the news center in Cartagena. But the greatest danger to
the estimated 1,200 reporters, photographers and camera crews
appeared to be tripping over themselves in the crush.
   There also was the physical toll of scooting out of the
air-conditioned luxury of the Cartagena convention center _ into
95-degree heat for interviews.
   Photographers and camera crews busied themselves filming and
photographing warships in the bay, soldiers using mirrors to search
under cars for bombs and anti-riot police standing by.
   The U.S. Secret Service heightened anxieties by leaking that the
drug traffickers had ground-to-air, shoulder-fired SAM-7 missiles
and might use them during the summit.
   Presidential aides plan to confine the White House press corps
accompanying Bush to a hangar in Baranquilla, where Bush will land
Thursday morning.
   The reporters will be kept there six hours while Bush is taken
to Cartagena 85 miles away for the drug meeting, which will be held
in a 17th century Spanish fort on the Cartagena bay.
   Despite signals from the White House and the Secret Service that
violence would not come as a surprise, no bombs, bullets or threats
materialized on Wednesday. The only apparent casualties were
reporters with sunburns.
   Two U.S. warships prowled the Colombian coast. Helicopter
gunships buzzed around the bay and all tourist boats and other
non-military sea traffic was ordered to clear out.
   A Colombian frigate and high-speed navy patrol boats armed with
twin .50-caliber machine guns were anchored in the bay, not far
from the Spanish fortress.
   Frogmen were seen entering the bay at several points, apparently
checking for explosives.
   One was seen coming up with a lobster.

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ Eleven political parties issued a
statement Wednesday denouncing the personal power of Lt. Gen.
Prosper Avril and said no elections are possible under his rule.
   ``The prerequisites of free and honest elections at all levels
cannot be met by the present government,'' said the statement,
signed by Haiti's major parties, including the Communists and a
conservative coalition.
   Avril has promised to allow presidential elections scheduled for
October.
   During a crackdown in January police arrested more than 50
opposition activists, who said they were beaten in custody. All
were released except for the nation's seven most prominent
activists, who were exiled.
   The crackdown followed the killing of an army colonel.
   After strong criticism from France, the European Community and
the United States, Avril lifted a state of siege and said the
exiled leaders could return. Most refused, however, saying
elections were not possible under Avril.
   Also Wednesday, the Rev. Willie Romelus, the radical bishop of
the western city of Jeremie, urged Haitians to boycott carnival
celebrations later this month to show they oppose the military
regime.
   ``We can't celebrate carnival while the country is
topsy-turvy,'' Romelus said on the Roman Catholic Church's Radio
Soleil.
   The government has said public participation would mean support
for Avril.
   The three-day festivity comes before Lent and is Haiti's most
popular annual event. All businesses close and thousands of people
dance, sing and drink in the streets to the music of dozens of
bands.
   But no carnival has been widely attended since 1985, the year
before dictator Jean-Claude Duvalier fled into exile in France
after a popular uprising.
   Romelus said elections were not possible under ``a regime which
has violated the constitution.''
   ``They (voters) know they have two alternatives: Nov. 29 and
Jan. 17,'' Romelus said, referring to the November 1987 Election
Day massacre in which thugs protected by soldiers killed dozens of
voters, and to army-rigged elections the following January.

<HEAD>Vassar Students Occupy Building To Protest Moynihan's Alleged
Remark</HEAD>
<DATELINE>POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vassar College students angered by an
offensive remark allegedly made by U.S. Sen. Daniel Patrick
Moynihan continued occupying a campus building Wednesday, prompting
him to resign an honorary professorship. Moynihan sent a letter to
Vassar's president Wednesday night saying he would return the
professorship and the $1,000 stipend that went with it. The
students had demanded that the college sever its ties to the
senator.
   ``This doesn't change anything,'' said Jubi Headley, a member of
the student coalition that took over the bulding. ``What it does do
is it facilitates negotiations. We still have a list of demands
that must be met.
   ``We are not planning on leaving the building tonight,'' he said.
   At least 51 students barricaded themselves inside Vassar's main
administration building Tuesday morning at the 2,400-student
college 70 miles north of New York City.
   By 6 p.m. Tuesday evening, about 40 students continued to block
entrances and occupy the building's switchboard room, said Cleon
Edwards, president of the Vassar Black Students Union.
   Edwards, a senior from New York City, said the students would
remain in the building at least until 9 a.m. Thursday, when a
meeting is scheduled between student leaders and Vassar President
Frances Fergusson.
   ``We are doing everything we can to meet with the students,''
Fergusson said.
   Moynihan spokesman Paul Browne, speaking from the senator's
Washington office, said Moynihan did not recall ever making the
alleged remark to a black Jamaican woman.
   The woman, Folami Gray, said she challenged Moynihan on a speech
he made at Vassar on Jan. 29 and was told afterward by the New York
Democrat that if she doesn't like it in the United States, she
should pack her bags and go back to where she came from.
   Moynihan allegedly made the comment at a reception after he gave
the Eleanor Roosevelt Lecture. Gray, who is not a student and heads
the Dutchess County youth bureau, said she had questioned Moynihan
on his contention that the U.S. was a model of ethnic cooperation.
   In his letter to Fergusson, Moynihan wrote, ``Heavens, what hath
on lecture wrought!''
   Edwards said student demands include removing Moynihan from the
Roosevelt Chair, establishment of an ``intercultural center'' for
minority meetings, a rabbi to minister to Jewish students and
handicapped access to all buildings.

   Criminal charges will be sought against a
guard believed to have brought a hacksaw blade into prison that was
used by six inmates to escape, authorities said Wednesday.
   Two of the prisoners from the maximum-security Joliet
Correctional Center were captured by Wednesday but four others,
including three convicted murderers, remained at large.
   Two guards at the state prison will be suspended for Sunday's
escapes, said Department of Corrections spokesman Nic Howell.
   The department also will ask the Will County state's attorney's
office to bring charges against one of the suspended guards, Howell
said. Prosecutors will determine the charges, he said.
   County State's Attorney Edward A. Burmila said he would review a
report from prison officials before making a decision.
   Howell declined to identify any of the five guards who had been
under investigation for negligence or wrongdoing in the escape from
the prison's discipline-segregation unit.
   Inmates whose cells were near the escapees' told authorities
they observed the men cutting their cell bars with hacksaws for two
nights before fleeing.
   ``We recovered a blade in the cell of one of the guys who took
off,'' Howell said.
   The first inmate was captured in Chicago several hours after the
escape. The second escapee was captured Wednesday after thumbing a
ride on a cold, rain-soaked Chicago freeway and being recognized by
the owner of a towing service.
   Terry W. Colburn, 21, was arrested Wednesday in this Chicago
suburb about 40 miles from Joliet after a motorist picked him up on
the expressway late Tuesday, said State Police Capt. Dan McDevitt.
   The motorist had driven the burglary convict to a friend's tow
truck operation to spend the night.
   Airline Towing owner Lonnie Bramlett Jr. said he initially
suspected nothing when the wet, cold stranger showed up, but became
suspicious after seeing TV accounts and reading about the escape in
a newspaper.
   Bramlett said he called Airline Towing to warn the dispatcher
about his suspicions, then called police.
   Colburn was arrested without incident. He was not armed.
   ``He was more scared than anything else,'' McDevitt said. ``You
have several guys come into the room with guns on you and it tends
to have a sobering effect.''

   Bitter northwest wind and heavy
seas heaved gooey crude oil on shore Wednesday, forcing skimming
boats to suspend operations while workers tackled the bulk of a
coastal oil spill on the beach.
   Wind trailing a Pacific winter storm gusted from 25 to 30 mph
under a sunny sky while a mixture of tar balls, brown foam and
thick oil coated miles of the coast, especially beaches exposed
head-on to the pounding surf.
   In Balboa about 10 miles south of here, resident Ralph Gray said
thick muck hit the beach for the first time Wednesday.
   ``I thought it was no big deal before since they said it was
just a little amount of oil out there,'' said Gray, 27. ``But we
need bulldozers now.''
   About 400,000 gallons spilled from the tanker American Trader on
Feb. 7 after its hull was punctured, apparently by its own anchor,
while the ship maneuvered into a mooring station about 2 miles
offshore.
   Wind blasting to gale force forced 16 oil-skimming boats to
suspend operations Tuesday night and the gusts apparently drove
much of the remaining crude onto the beach.
   Aerial observers reported Wednesday that a light oily sheen
still hugged the coast from Lower Bolsa Chica State Beach to
Newport Beach, but Coast Guard officials reported that very little
of the spilled crude remained in the water.
   ``We expect the balance of the oil to wash ashore today,
enabling cleanup crews on the beach to get what's left,'' said
Peter Bartelme, a spokesman for British Petroleum America Inc.,
which owned the spilled crude.
   Disaster crews, which were tripled to more than 1,200 members as
officials struggled to deal with the spill, resumed work after dawn
Wednesday.
   Oil washed ashore had percolated as deep as 3 feet into the sand
in some areas, according to cleanup officials. Environmentalists
were concerned.
   ``There is a whole world of organisms that live in the
intertidal zone that are going to be affected as oil washes up on
the beach,'' said Dorothy Green of Heal the Bay, a local
environmental group. ``Just think of where the shore birds usually
are, following the waves in and out and poking at the beach. Those
birds are feeding on those organisms.''
   Volunteers and others so far have found about 135 birds killed
by the oil, and wildlife rescue workers are striving to save an
additional 329 oiled birds, said Tom Paulek of the California
Department of Fish and Game. Two unidentified mammals were killed,
he added.
   By Wednesday evening, Coast Guard planes reported no oil visible
at sea, said Newport Beach police Sgt. Andy Gonis.
   In Sacramento, Department of Fish and Game Director Peter
Bontadelli criticized aspects of the cleanup. He said some
protective booms initally were installed incorrectly and that
skimming failed to collect enough oil.
   ``Many of these problems should have been anticipated and were
not,'' Bontadelli said.
   Huntington Beach Mayor Tom Mays told reporters he was
disappointed that Gov. George Deukmejian spurned his request to
declare his community a local disaster area. ``We feel there is a
major disaster here,'' Mays said.
   Deukmejian deferred action on the request Tuesday, said Eileen
Baumgardner, assistant director of the state Office of Emergency
Services. ``As far as we can tell, there are no needs that are not
being met,'' she said.
   British Petroleum, which chartered the ship, is coordinating
most of the cleanup but is not expected to pay for final costs,
which likely will come out of the insurance of the ship's owner,
American Trading Transportation Co., said James H. Ross, president
and chief executive of British Petroleum.
   Huntington Beach residents complained that fumes from the
beached crude were causing headaches and nausea, according to Don
Livsey, a Huntington Beach resident and founder of a local group
called Save Our Surf.
   ``You can get the smell going out our front door,'' said Livsey,
who lives two blocks from the beach and who said he is among those
stricken with headaches since the spill. ``My wife is experiencing
the same thing, and there's concern because she's pregnant.''
   Assistant Secretary of Labor Gerard Scannell, who administers
the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, told reporters
he was unaware of complaints about hydrocarbon vapors.
   ``Our environmental team, in cooperation with OSHA and the Coast
Guard, have extensively sampled the area and have not found levels
of exposure that could cause illness,'' Bartelme said.
   A class-action lawsuit involving the spill was filed Tuesday by
Newport Beach resident Chet Holifield in federal court in Los
Angeles. The suit seeks compensation for damage and economic losses
caused by the spill and the alleged failure to properly clean up
the oil. Among the defendants named are British Petroleum and
American Trading.

   President Daniel Ortega said
Wednesday that if his leftist Sandinista party wins this month's
elections it will seize property owned by opposition leaders,
including the only opposition newspaper.
   ``If we win, I say we will hand them a complete bill, so they
will be left without a newspaper _ La Prensa _ and the homes of the
candidate and the vice presidential candidate will be converted
into children's homes on the day after the elections,'' Ortega told
a campaign rally.
   Ortega and Vice President Sergio Ramirez are seeking re-election
Feb. 25, running against La Prensa publisher Violeta Barrios de
Chamorro and Virgilio Godoy on the ticket of the 14-party United
National Opposition, or UNO.
   The Sandinista leader was responding to a recent speech by
Godoy, who said if UNO wins the election, ``we are going to make
the Sandinistas pay the bills one by one'' for alleged violations
of human, civil and political rights.
   Ortega, in a speech before 80,000 cheering Sandinista supporters
in Matagalpa 75 miles north of the capital, challenged the
U.S.-backed UNO leaders to repeat Godoy's words before
international observers monitoring the elections.
   Ortega repeated accusations he made Tuesday that the
U.S.-supported Contra rebels and UNO leaders were planning to
disrupt the campaign.
   After meeting with Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, the Roman
Catholic archbishop of Managua, Ortega told reporters late Tuesday
that about 2,000 rebels had infiltrated northern Nicaragua from
bases in neighborhing Honduras to disrupt the voting.
   Ortega also accused UNO leaders of planning to call the
elections fraudulent.
   ``Since they know they have already lost the elections, they
have this plan of saying there was fraud and the elections would be
invalid,'' Ortega said Wednesday. He also said the army was taking
action to neutralize any Contra infiltrators.

<HEAD>Blood Drive Canceled Over Rejection of Haitian Donors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Officials at a Roman Catholic high school in
Miami's Little Haiti area canceled a blood drive after learning
Haitian donors were not welcome.
   ``I have no problem with their blood being rejected after being
tested but to single out a group, that takes me aback,'' said
Brother Genaro Sulo, principal of Archbishop Curley-Notre Dame High
School. ``It seems to be saying that all Haitians have AIDS.''
   The exclusion is required under a federal Food and Drug
Administration policy that bars people born in or emigrating from
Haiti and certain parts of Africa as blood donors, said FDA
spokesman Brad Stone.
   A previous FDA policy banned donations from Haitians who arrived
in the United States after 1977 when the deadly virus first was
detected in the U.S. The Miami chapter of the American Red Cross
changed its guidelines to comply with the revised FDA rule Tuesday.
   The national Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta stopped
listing Haitians as a high-risk group for the transmission of AIDS
in 1985 after the extent of the disease in the world population
became known, but CDC still discourages Haitians from donating
blood.
   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus carried
in blood. Heterosexual activity is believed to be the prime means
of transmission in Haiti.
   School officials learned of the guidelines last week when senior
Lisa Henry, the blood drive leader, was recruiting students. A
teacher told her that some Haitians had been rejected last year.
   It was learned that 25 of the 138 volunteers wouldn't be allowed
to participate under the FDA's mandatory rules. When Sulo heard
that the students would be turned away, he called off Tuesday's
blood drive.
   ``Our hands are tied,'' said Christopher Chidley, spokesman for
the Red Cross in Miami. ``It is not something we look forward to
doing. It's going to be harder for us to collect blood.''

   A Soyuz TM-9 capsule arrived at the Mir space
station Tuesday and the two cosmonauts aboard relieved two others
finishing up six months of work in space, the official Tass news
agency said.
   It was the latest step in a mission designed to turn a profit of
more than $40 million, a first in the 32-year history of the Soviet
space program.
   Tass reported no problems as flight commander Anatoly Solovyov
and engineer Alexander Balandin docked their Soyuz TM-9 with the
space station.
   The other cosmonauts, Alexander Viktorenko and Alexander
Serebrov, have been aboard the orbiter for two months and were to
return to Earth on Monday, Tass said.
   The Soyuz blasted off Sunday and the new cosmonauts also are to
spend six months in space.
   Under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, pressures have increased
on the once sacrosanct Soviet space program to prove its usefulness
to the severely strained economy. Some Soviet lawmakers have even
called for funding reductions, saying the country can ill afford
costly space missions when it cannot provide a reliable supply of
meat and potatoes.
   The Soyuz TM-9 mission, however, is designed to put to use the
Kristall module, described by the government newspaper Izvestia as
the first orbital factory for the full-scale manufacture of
technological and biotechnological materials in the near-weightless
conditions on Mir.

   AT&amp;T is offering to kiss and make up
to customers cut off by the computer-generated phone crash last
month, discounting its Valentine's Day long-distance rates by a
third.
   The company cut an average of 33 percent off regular rates for
calls within the United States between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m on
Wednesday, and 37 percent off international rates, said Lynn
Newman, a spokeswoman at the company's operations headquarters here.
   ``This is our way of saying we're sorry the outage happened and
our way of trying to compensate our customers,'' Newman said.
   A programming error in AT&amp;T's call switching network partially
knocked out long-distance service nationwide for about nine hours
Jan. 15 and kept millions of calls from being completed.
   The phone company placed ads publicizing the discount in
newspapers in 12 major metropolitan areas, Newman said, but the ads
make no mention of the outage.
   ``I don't know why we didn't mention it,'' Newman said. ``If
anything, we were trying to point up the fact that it's Valentine's
Day'' and that people can call their loved ones for less money, she
said.
   The company recorded 108 million telephone calls on its circuits
last Valentine's Day.

<HEAD>Cohen, Domenici Announce for Re-election</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. Sens. William Cohen of Maine and Pete Domenici of New
Mexico announced they would seek re-election Tuesday, and the son
of former Vice President Walter Mondale launched his political
career with a bid for state senate.
   In Indiana, U.S. Sen. Dan Coats opened an unchallenged bid to
become GOP candidate for Vice President Dan Quayle's former seat,
to which he was appointed in early 1989 by then-Gov. Robert D. Orr.
   Cohen, a 49-year-old Republican, told hometown supporters in
Bangor he has ``much more to give'' as he launched his drive for a
third term.
   Addressing nearly 100 luncheon guests, Cohen reached out for
support from beyond the Republican Party and sought to link himself
with Maine's other U.S. senator, Democrat George J. Mitchell, who
won re-election overwhelmingly in 1988 and became Senate majority
leader.
   The two Mainers have a ``close friendship'' and ``remain a very
effective team,'' said Cohen, who has been a prominent voice in
foreign affairs and co-wrote a book with Mitchell on their
experiences as part of the Iran-Contra investigating panel.
   Democratic state Rep. Neil Rolde of York has announced his
candidacy for the Democratic nomination for the Senate.
   Domenici, also a Republican, announced in Las Cruces, N.M., that
he would seek re-election to a fourth term. He said he would work
to create new and better jobs in New Mexico, fight drugs and
protect the state's environment.
   ``We must improve our productivity, our economic efficiency, so
that the standard of living we enjoy continues to improve,'' said
Domenici, 57, who was first elected to the Senate in 1972.
   The only other announced candidate is Democrat Tom Benavides, a
state senator from Albuquerque.
   In St. Louis Park, Minn., Ted Mondale, son of former U.S. Sen.
and Vice President Walter Mondale, declared himself ``proud to be a
Mondale running for office'' in seeking the state senate seat of
Republican incumbent Phyllis McQuaid.
   ``My father has given me a good name, but he gave me much more:
a respect for public service and a willingness to stand up for
people who are not rich and powerful,'' Mondale, 32, told
supporters at his home in this Minneapolis suburb. The gathering
included his family.
   ``These values are timeless, and, Dad, I promise to apply them
to the challenges of the 1990s and beyond.''
   Mondale is a 1988 graduate of the William Mitchell College of
Law in St. Paul and is employed by the Minneapolis law firm of
Larkin, Hoffman, Daly and Lindgren. He worked on his father's vice
presidential and presidential campaigns in 1976, 1980 and 1984.
   In Indiana, the 1990 Senate campaign is a special election to
fill the remaining two years of the term won by Quayle in 1986. The
winner of this year's race will face re-election in 1992.
   Coats, a 46-year-old Republican, will likely face four-term
state Democratic Rep. Baron P. Hill of Seymour, who entered the
race after better known Democrats, including U.S. Rep. Lee H.
Hamilton, decided not to run.
   ``Our first challenge is to sustain and expand the remarkable
economic growth of the last six years,'' Coats told supporters in
South Bend.

<HEAD>Fire Brigade Accuses Police of Bungling Earthquake Rescue</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A confidential report on December's
deadly earthquake in Newcastle says police ``bungled'' rescue
efforts and prevented more lives from being saved. The report
prompted officials to order an investigation Wednesday.
   The report by the New South Wales state fire brigade, leaked to
a Sydney radio station, said police were late to the scene and not
persistent enough in searching for survivors in the Dec. 28 quake
that left 12 people dead.
   ``At the Newcastle Workers Club it was an horrific situation _
response from the fire brigade approximately two to three minutes,
ambulance half an hour, police rescue in excess of one hour,'' the
report said.
   ``As the rescue effort continued it was apparent that confusion
and bungling began to spread,'' it said.
   The report said it may have been possible to save trapped people
if rescue operations had been continued earlier and added that one
fire officer felt police had prematurely collapsed portions of the
building. Nine people died there.
   Ted Pickering, the state's police and emergency services
minister, ordered a full investigation into the allegations.
   The fire brigade report was prepared after a meeting of fire
officers two days after the earthquake in Newcastle, a
predominately industrial city of 500,000 75 miles north of Sydney.
   Fire brigade officials on Wednesday acknowledged existence of
the report, with one senior officer said fallout from its release
would create ``a lot of problems between us and the police.''
   The head of the New South Wales Police Rescue Squad defended
police involved in the quake, saying they acted professionally at
all times.
   ``In a situation like that, when everyone is under pressure, I
don't feel anyone should be critical,'' Inspector Ken Holmes said.
   The quake measured 5.5 on the Richter scale and was Australia's
most destructive temblor.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by the ground motion recorded on a
seismograph. Every increase of one number means that the ground
motion is 10 times greater.
   A quake of magnitude 5 can cause considerable damage in
populated areas, while one measuring 6 can cause severe damage in
populated areas.

   City council has declared this
northern Ontario center English-only despite last-minute pleas from
local francophones not to take such a drastic stand.
   In a 9-4 vote after a lengthy meeting Monday night, the council
adopted English as the official language in this city of 125,000 _
making it the largest of at least 44 Ontario communities to go that
route.
   Francophones comprise 2.3 percent of the city's population. More
people speak Italian, Finnish and Ukrainian than speak French,
according to city statistics.
   The English-only declarations throughout Ontario are largely a
protest against the province's French Language Services Act.
   Under the act, which became law in November, the province offers
services in French and English in areas designated to have a large
francophone population.

<TEXT>
   A week-long celebration opened Tuesday
to commemorate the 1980 Winter Olympic Games, a spectacle that
began with bureaucratic blundering and finished with one of the
United States' grandest moments in sports.
   ``Ten years ago today on this site, the focus of the world was
on this community as the Olympics returned to Lake Placid,'' Master
of Ceremonies Dennis Ryan said at the opening night ceremony. ``We
tell the world tonight that we remain ready again to host the
Winter Olympic Games.''
   People in the tiny Adirondack Mountain village looked forward to
the Olympics 10 years ago, but at the start nearly everything that
could go wrong did go wrong.
   A mismanaged bus system left thousands of spectators stranded in
the bitter cold and ultimately the state declared a partial
transportation emergency. Massive traffic jams in and around Lake
Placid further prevented transportation to and from the various
sports venues.
   The ticket-selling and telephone systems were overloaded. The
International Olympic Committee even issued a public reprimand to
the Lake Placid organizing committee for its bungling of the first
medal ceremony on frozen Mirror Lake.
   But the bus system improved dramatically after a few days and
speedskater Eric Heiden and the U.S. Olympic hockey team made the
nation briefly forget its troubles.
   Every motel room in Lake Placid has been booked for the weekend,
and organizers expect 20,000 people to visit the village of 2,500
by the time the celebration ends Sunday, said Lake Placid Commerce
and Visitors Bureau spokesman Peter Wilson.
   ``There seems to be an incredible amount of interest,'' said Don
Krone, a spokesman for the organization that assumed control of
most Olympic facilities following the 1980 games, the Olympic
Regional Development Authority. ``A lot of people are calling,
people who have fond memories of 1980, even the athletes.
   ``They didn't get to see what Lake Placid was like 10 years ago.
The figure skaters who are coming back _ Lisa Marie Allen, Michael
Botticelli, David Santee _ have spent a lot of time talking to each
other on the phone in the past couple of weeks, and they're all
over the country.''
   Eight members of the U.S. Olympic hockey team, including
goaltenders Jim Craig and Steve Janaszak, captain Mike Eruzione and
defenseman Bill Baker, will return Saturday. They will be honored
in a ceremony in the same arena where they shocked the sports world
by defeating the Soviets and winning the gold medal.
   Former Olympians will also hold a figure-skating exhibition.
   The opening ceremonies Tuesday night were much more modest than
those of a decade ago, when 23,000 people watched the traditional
parade of athletes spread a sea of color across the Olympic stadium.
   Instead of 1 million flowers, 2,000 birds, 40 hot-air balloons
and 25,000 helium-filled balloons, a small torchlit Parade of
Nations was watched by a crowd of about 3,000 standing in a muddy
field.
   There was some international representation in the procession
but it was composed mostly of local high school athletes dressed in
their favorite sports outfits and carrying flags from the 37
nations that participated in the 1980 games.
   The 75-foot tall Olympic flame was ignited amidst a backdrop of
fireworks and music.
   When the 1980 Games ended, Lake Placid was saddled with a $6
million debt, and some disgruntled citizens wanted to sell the
Olympic torch to raise money. That never happened, but the torch
fell into disrepair and only recently was re-assembled.
   Part of the opening ceremony was dedicated to the memory of the
Rev. J. Bernard Fell, who was president of the Lake Placid Olympic
Organizing Committee. Fell died in 1985 after a long illness.
   The Olympic torch will become a permanent memorial to him,
officials said.

<TEXT>
   A woman is suing her psychiatrist for $14
million, claiming the doctor tried to help her commit suicide on
four occasions _ once spoon-feeding her yogurt lethally laced with
Seconal, her lawyer said Tuesday.
   Fern Isaacson, 31, of Manhattan, who suffers from an incurable
and degenerative illness, survived the incident in 1987 when she
decided she did not want to die and the psychiatrist induced
vomiting, said the attorney, Bruce Clark.
   The psychiatrist's lawyer denies that the doctor was trying to
help Isaacson commit suicide, but rather was trying to get her to
reaffirm that she wanted to live.
   Isaacson also has asked the Manhattan district attorney's office
to look into attempted murder charges against D. Elisabeth Jenks,
Clark said. The lawsuit is for medical malpractice.
   ``We have opened a preliminary review of Ms. Isaacson's
complaints. We have not begun a formal investigation yet,'' said
Gerald McKelvey, spokesman for District Attorney Robert Morgenthau.
He would not elaborate.
   ``Within a few months after she started seeing Dr. Jenks, the
doctor first suggested she commit suicide,'' Clark said. ``She said
Fern shouldn't have to go through this pain and horrible life she's
living and she should end it.''
   Isaacson was diagnosed in 1980 as having Ehlers-Danlos syndrome,
an incurable disease that attacks the body's connective tissue.
   By the time she began seeing Jenks in 1986, Isaacson had
undergone 70 operations, was severely depressed and suffered
problems stemming from her childhood, Clark said.
   He said Isaacson's mother, a pediatrician, tried to commit
suicide when Isaacson was 2{ by slitting her wrists. She locked her
daughter in the bathroom with her during the attempt, Clark said.
   When Isaacson was 8, her mother killed herself _ in her
daughter's bed, said Clark. ``So suicide was always on Fern's mind
because of what her mother did.''
   Clark said the doctor, who works out of Gouverneur Hospital in
Manhattan, ``first suggested Fern take a large amount of her
cardiac drugs.''
   He said the conversations were recorded, at the doctor's
request, and that he has ``quite a few'' tapes.
   Clark said Jenks suggested suicide four times, and was present
twice when his client made the attempts. Each one involved using
medications prescribed to Isaacson by her other doctors, Clark said.
   He said the ``most significant one'' occurred in 1987 when Jenks
emptied the contents of 29 Seconal capsules, went back to
Isaacson's apartment with her, mixed the drug into some yogurt and
``spooned it into Fern until there was only one spoonful left and
Fern said she didn't want to die.''
   Clark said the doctor then induced vomiting and helped Isaacson
to a hospital.
   Jenks was not at Gouverneur Hospital on Tuesday and did not
immediately return a call left on her answering machine. Jenks'
attorney, Anthony Sola, said Jenks participated in ``pretend
suicides'' meant to bolster her patient's will to live.
   ``Dr. Jenks' goal, which was successful, was to convince the
patient that she did not want to die,'' Sola said.
   He also said that Isaacson has a long history of psychiatric
disorders and has previously threatened lawsuits against other
psychiatrists.
   The federal Drug Enforcement Agency is also looking into the
case.
   ``We're still in the preliminary stages of our investigation,''
said DEA spokesman Mark Hannan. He added that the DEA was ``looking
at it from the compliance perspective, monitoring prescriptions by
doctors.''

   The four World War II Allies, vanquishers of Nazi
Germany and occupiers of Berlin, have begun a process aimed at
ensuring a unified Germany will not pose a threat to world security.
   Foreign ministers from France, Britain, the Soviet Union and
United States announced Tuesday that they would meet with their
counterparts from East and West Germany to discuss the alignment
and military strength of a unified Germany.
   No date for such a meeting was given, but before it takes place
the two Germanys will be left alone to tackle the considerable
domestic hurdles that must be overcome before unity is possible.
   With Tuesday's announcement, the powers that divided Germany in
1945 clearly acknowledged that reunification is inevitable now that
Communist rule has collapsed in East Germany.

   The bankruptcy filing by the parent of Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc. could take years to sort out, but already
there is little left of the firm whose junk-bond machine fueled the
fast-buck, megamerger 1980s.
   With most securities firms refusing to trade with Drexel and
banks unwilling to lend money to stem its cash crisis, the one-time
powerhouse began liquidating its huge bond portfolio even before
its board authorized the bankruptcy filing.
   Employees, meanwhile, scrambled to look for jobs in an industry
that has been shrinking steadily since the October 1987 stock
market crash.
   Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc., parent of the securities
company, filed for Chapter 11 protection from creditors late

boom, Drexel had posted record pretax profits of nearly $1 billion.

   An original goal of Radio Free
Europe, born in the Cold War to penetrate the Iron Curtain, was to
close when Eastern Europe opened up and the news flowed freely. But
the Western network is staying on the air with a new mission _ to
spread word on how democracy works.
   ``Yes, we are going to stay in business,'' said William W.
Marsh, executive vice president of Radio Free Europe and its sister
station Radio Liberty, which broadcasts into the Soviet Union.
``Our job is not done.''
   Radio Free Europe, founded in 1949 and Radio Liberty,
established two years later, are based in Munich but controlled by
the Washington-based Bureau of International Broadcasting and
funded by the U.S. Congress. It is popularly known as RFE-RL.
   RFE-RL was distinct from the Voice of America, the British
Broadcasting Corp. and other Western radios, because it was ``a
surrogate for free media that did not exist'' in Eastern Europe,
said Robert E. Gillette, the deputy director.

<TEXT>
   Television, for years the mythic battleground
for cops and robbers, is becoming as much a part of law enforcement
equipment as handcuffs and badges.
   Officers can now learn more about everything from making traffic
stops to subduing unruly suspects by tuning in to the Law
Enforcement Television Network.
   The network went on line full time in July 1989, and since then
has acquired about 1,200 law enforcement agency subscribers
throughout the continental United States _ ranging from small
departments to the FBI, said network President Billy Prince.
   ``The comments we're getting back say it's the best thing since
the two-way radio. We've been hearing stories of officers staying
after a shift to watch it,'' Prince said.
   LETN's satellite programming, available to subscribers 24 hours
a day Monday through Friday, runs the spectrum from the latest law
enforcement techniques to police news. The network showcased its
programming last month at the American Society of Law Enforcement
Trainers' conference in San Diego.
   Each of the five regular training segments is designed with a
level of law enforcement in mind, from ``Street Beat,'' geared
toward the officer on the beat, to ``Command Update,'' which
provides training for supervisors and administrators.
   The programs are supplemented by ``Roll Call,'' a quarter-hour
of police news and training segments.
   ``Our purpose is to train existing officers in the up-to-date
things going on in their profession,'' Prince said in a telephone
interview from his Dallas office. ``(We) let them know what's going
on and let them know what works and what doesn't work so they don't
wind up reinventing the wheel.''
   The network took its cue from a similar project begun in 1986 to
train auto mechanics and car salesmen, Prince said. In mid-1988,
Wescott Communications began funding what would eventually become
LETN.
   The service was initially limited to one day a week. Now it
operates on a $10 million annual budget, said Prince, a former
Dallas police chief.
   LETN's staff is mostly ex-law enforcement professionals,
including three former police chiefs. Technical adviser Missy
O'Linn, who is licensed to practice law in Ohio and has a
background in unarmed self-defense instruction, reviews all
programs and scripts for content including faithfulness to police
procedure.
   ``Because adults learn from what they see and hear, it's
important that all of the details are right,'' O'Linn said.
``That's important. We don't want to endanger an officer because of
the program.''
   Although the network employs no full-time instructors, trainers
are chosen from among the best in the nation, O'Linn said.
   Dale Stockton, training and personnel manager for police in
Carlsbad, a coastal town north of San Diego, said the department
has been pleased with LETN since it became a subscriber in October.
   ``My recommendation would be to continue it,'' Stockton said.
``It costs this department $488 per month. I ask myself: For $488
what else can I do that would effectively deliver such
comprehensive training as this? So far, I haven't found anything.''
   One of the network's most notable subscribers, the FBI, has been
with LETN since its inception, although spokesman Mike Kortan said
the bureau's public affairs office in Washington, D.C., does not
employ LETN for actual training.
   ``I would not characterize them as a training vehicle for the
FBI. For us it's sort of a news outlet for the FBI,'' Kortan said.
``Their format allows for a little more in-depth stories, which is
a break from the usual short soundbites that we're used to.''

   A proposal goes before the Southern
Baptist executive committee next week to cut the denomination's
support of an inter-Baptist religious liberty lobby in Washington
from $391,769 a year to $50,000.
   Dominant fundamentalists in the 14.8 million-member denomination
have long sought to curtail participation in the Baptist Joint
Committee on Public Affairs, which also serves eight other Baptist
denominations.
   The subcommittee's proposal, if it gained approval by the
Southern Baptist Convention in June, would shift most of the
funding to a separate denominational agency.
   In Washington, the Rev. James M. Dunn, executive director of the
BJCPA, called the move irresponsibile, saying such efforts have
been rejected by five recent annual conventions.
   ``It is highly questionable whether Southern Baptists will
suddenly and precipitously reverse themselves on what has been a
united Baptist witness in Washington over the past 53 years.''

<HEAD>Spending the `Peace Dividend'</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There's only one certainty about the peace
dividend: everybody wants a piece of it. And that includes some
politicians who aren't enthusiastic about declaring much of a
dividend yet.
   The government hasn't yet figured out how much it will be, and
how or when it will be produced. There will be defense spending
cuts, targets and timing yet to be determined.
   The peace dividend is a slogan-size name for an urgent new
installment in the long debate over defense spending and national
priorities, now transformed by the ending Cold War, the
transformation of the communist bloc and the apparent easing of the
Soviet threat.
   With Congress in recess this week, that's one of the issues
campaigning members are taking up with their constituents. The
peace dividend debate already is unfolding in congressional
committees, where the chairman of one House panel showed defense
chieftains an ax and said it was symbolic of the mood at the
Capitol.
   While President Bush is trying to avoid runaway expectations of
a sharp, swift cut in defense expenditures because of the
revolutionary changes in eastern Europe and Moscow, the
administration has its own plans for the potential dividend, seeing
the potential savings as a guarantee that he can stand permanently
on his promise of no new taxes.
   A conservative think tank, skeptical about the whole business,
says that if there really is a peace dividend, it should be used to
cut taxes. Otherwise, according to the Heritage Foundation, the
savings are likely to be used in ``a congressional spending spree...
   ``Dividends normally are paid to investors, not kept by the
corporation,'' the foundation said.
   The Bush defense budget is under attack in Congress, where some
Democrats argue that it looks like a Cold War leftover. The budget
seeks a $5.3 billion increase in Pentagon spending; adjusted for
inflation that means a reduction of about 2 percent in real growth.
   Administration critics say the threat is receding a lot faster
than that. Bush said this week that his budget makes good sense.
   ``I think the American people want a cautious approach to
this,'' he said. ``I don't think any of us think we can see with
clairvoyance as to what's going to happen the day after tomorrow...
   ``Some of the Democrats are jumping all over us,'' he told a
news conference. ``But that's all right, that just goes with the
system.''
   But there also is skepticism among some members of Congress, in
both parties, who tend toward the cautious approach Bush advocates.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Armed Services Committee,
says he's looking for an administration defense blueprint that
takes into account the changing world balance and the prospects for
arms control. He said he doubts Congress will go ahead with costly
weapons systems like the stealth bomber program, the Star Wars
space defense system and the mobile MX missile unless the
administration presents a blueprint that fits its proposals into
arms control prospects in the post Cold War world.
   While those are the big ticket weapons, the administration
maintains that sharp, immediate cost cuts could come only in
conventional force spending, an argument Pentagon critics dispute.
   Nor does the current budget anticipate significant savings this
year through the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Europe. Bush
proposes the withdrawal of 80,000 troops from Europe under an
East-West agreement now in negotiation.
   The president said those savings, too, will come gradually, over
the years. He said he doesn't want soldiers who seek reenlistment
to be dumped by the arms services. ``I would hope that attrition
can take care of the cuts that inevitably will be coming,'' Bush
said.
   He also said there is no reason to change the NATO weapons plan
that includes short-range nuclear missiles, battlefield weapons
that would be targeted on East Germany and other Warsaw Pact
states. The West Germans resisted modernizing those U.S. missiles
even before the undoing of the old communist regimes.
   Bush said that at this point, he sees nothing to change the NATO
compromise that left the modernization question open until 1992.
   For all of that, and despite the fact that economists say any
peace dividend will be far smaller than those after Vietnam and
Korea, the search for a dividend is on.
   Budget Director Richard G. Darman called it the ``spend the
peace dividend game'' in which the politician-players conjure up
vast sums in supposed savings to be appropriated for their pet
projects.
   ``Thus Washington entertains the notion of spending fifty times
a dividend that has not yet definitively materialized _ a true
Wonderland phenomenon,'' Darman said in his introduction to the
budget.
   Then again, anyone who had forecast the remodeling of eastern
Europe a year ago would have been accused of wonderland dreaming,
too.

   Savers and investors watched with remarkable
calm this week as a pillar of the financial scene for the past
decade, Wall Street's Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., collapsed.
   Some specialists in matters of personal finance said the steady
behavior of the stock and bond markets proided impressive evidence
of long-term confidence in the economic and investment outlook.
   Others suggested that decision-markers, in individual households
and offices of professional money-management firms alike, had
simply been numbed by a long succession of crises and did not know
what to do next.
   In many ways Drexel personified the golden era on Wall Street
with its daring and innovation, bringing what once was considered
high-risk debt into the mainstream of the investment world. So the
instant message of its demise seemed to be ``the '80s are over.''
   But if a turning point has been reached, how should anyone with
money to manage respond?
   Is it time to cash in the mutual fund investments, abandon plans
to buy a house, and run for the hills? Or will patience and
confidence be rewarded for those who sit tight and ride out the
storm?
   Few of the experts profess to have any pat, all-purpose answers
to those questions.
   But there is ample evidence, they say, that individual investors
began months or even years ago to protect themselves from jolts
like the recent slide in the junk-bond market or the 1987 crash in
stock prices.
   Last year, for instance, assets of money-market mutual funds
surged by nearly $100 billion to record highs.
   In the nearly two decades since they first appeared, money funds
have become a popular choice for investors seeking to minimize
their risks in uncertain times.
   Financial adviser William E. Donoghue attributes the resurgence
of money funds now to such factors as ``excessive real estate loan
losses'' and ``writeoffs of bad loans in general.''
   As many investors in stock mutual funds know, the stock market
has also been showing the effects of debt worries for some time.
   ``Although the Dow Jones industrial average posted record highs
last October and in early January, most of the market has been in a
deteriorating phase since last August,'' observes the Merrill Lynch
Market Letter in its current issue.
   In the wake of the debt boom, furthermore, a new financial job
description is already in vogue on Wall Street _ the ``workout''
specialist, looking to find bargains and salvage whatever assets
remain in the wreckage of deals gone bad.
   For the speculatively inclined, ``the supply of bankruptcy bonds
has increased sharply in recent years,'' said George Putnam III,
editor of the Boston-based Turnaround Letter.
   In 1989, Putnam calculates, 37 companies with $7.1 billion in
bonds outstanding filed bankruptcy actions.
   ``We expect these trends to continue for at least the next year
or so,'' he added. ``There will certainly be no shortage of
bankruptcy securities for turnaround investors to consider.''
   If the situation creates opportunities, it also embodies risks
and perils that have not yet been fully grasped, argues James
Grant, whose Grant's Interest Rate Observer has long warned of
severe fallout from debt excesses.
   ``If the woes of junk are unique to junk, there would be nothing
to fear in the stock market, much less in business activity,'' he
said.
   ``If, however, the junk bond market's break is the sign of broad
distress, investors must take appropriate precautions.''
   In Grant's view, a potentially traumatic move from adventures in
debt back to traditional financial values is under way.
   ``The thunderheads rolling across the sky are the portents of a
return to conservative lending,'' he says. ``That is bullish for
many things in the long pull. For the short run, however, it is not
bullish for stock prices _ or for business activity.''

<HEAD>Annual Recruiting Drive Under Way for Appalachian Trail Volunteers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The annual drive has begun to recruit hundreds
of volunteers to make the Appalachian Trail more walkable along its
2,100-mile route from Maine to northern Georgia.
   Promoters put it this way: Break rocks. Get muddy and sweaty.
Dig in the dirt. Sleep with rhododendron, laurel and bears. Split
logs. Bridge bogs with the logs you split.
   If that isn't incentive enough, the Appalachian Trail Conference
promises that volunteers will ``get a strange T-shirt your old
friends won't understand and your mother won't want you to wear.''
   Volunteers conceived and built the hiking trail in the 1920s and
1930s and have managed and maintained the path ever since.
Gradually, the trail gained support from national forest and park
authorities and from the states involved.
   In 1968, the route was officially designated by Congress as a
national scenic trail. The 65-year-old private, non-profit
Appalachian Trail Conference was appointed the footpath's
day-to-day caretaker in 1984.
   The Forest Service in the Agriculture Department and the
National Park Service in the Interior Department are major
sponsors. The trail connects eight national forests, six national
park units and more than 60 state park, game and forest lands.
   ``It winds its way along the crests of the mountains, across
farm valleys, and through rugged and secluded high country,'' says
the conference. ``Almost all the trail is located on lands owned
either by the National Park Service, the U.S. Forest Service,
states or other public bodies.''
   Spokesman Brian King said in a telephone interview from
conference headquarters in Harpers Ferry, W.Va., that he had no
tabulation of 1989 work for the entire trail but that the southern
crew, for example, had 80 volunteers who worked 8,500 hours and
built 7.7 miles of footpath, along with bridges, one shelter and
three outhouses.
   The seasonal crews of volunteers began in 1983 in southwestern
Virginia, and a mid-Atlantic crew started in Pennsylvania in 1984.
The conference also works with New England clubs to finance and
recruit season workers in that area.
   The conference is comprised of 31 clubs and 24,000 individual
and family members.
   The southern crew, which works in Virginia, North Carolina and
Tennessee in the late spring and summer, is based in the Mount
Rogers National Recreation Area in southwestern Virginia.
   Mid-Atlantic operations are scheduled in September and October
in Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, New York and
New Jersey.
   King said volunteers have come from all across the United States
and there are usually two or three from overseas, often from
Britain.
   The conference's recruiting literature says the volunteer teams
``concentrate on trail construction and resource-management
projects that might not otherwise be tackled by local maintaining
clubs or public agencies with limited budgets.''
   Work includes trail design and construction, shelter and bridge
construction, rough carpentry, rehabilitation of eroded trails,
clearing and open-area management.
   ``The work is often physically demanding, requiring perseverance
and patience while living with limited comforts in the outdoors,''
the report said. ``Trail crews of four to six volunteers are led by
a skilled leader on projects from Thursday through Monday and
return to a base camp for Tuesday-Wednesday weekends, when members
may explore area attractions.''
   Volunteer crew members can opt to work for a week or the whole
season. Anyone age 18 or older, male and female, can apply. There
is no age limit.
   ``Enthusiasm, good health and adaptabilaity are important
prerequisites,'' the report said. ``Willingness to following
instruction and safety rules and to share equally in camp chores is
essential. Previous experience is helpful but not necessary.''
   Once a volunteer reachs a base camp, most expenses are covered,
including lodging, food, transportation to and from work sites,
tools, safety equipment, group camping gear (as available), and ``a
small weekly stipend'' for laundry and incidentals.
   For further information, prospective volunteers should write ATC
Southwest and Central Virginia Regional Office, P.O. Box 10,
Newport, Va. 24128, or call 703-544-7388. The Appalachian Trail
Conference headquarters also may be called at 304-535-6331.

   Roll over Chuck Berry and tell Bob Dylan the
news. At the first Grammys banquet in 1959, rock 'n' roll was out
in the streets.
   In the beginning were Perry Como, Henry Mancini and Louis Prima.
Rock 'n' roll was well established by the late 1950s, but the first
winner for record of the year was Domenico Modugno for ``Volare''
while album of the year honors went to Mancini for the ``Music From
Peter Gunn.''
   Twenty-eight trophys were handed out that first Grammy ceremony
in Los Angeles, which was not televised. This year, 77 Grammys will
be given out during the awards broadcast from the Shrine Auditorium
on Wednesday.
   At the first show, Como won for best vocal performance by a
male. Prima and Keely Smith were cited for best performance by a
vocal group or chorus. So what happened to Elvis Presley, Little
Richard and Buddy Holly?
   ``It baffles me as to exactly how so many important artists were
not part of the process,'' said Michael Greene, president of the
National Academy of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences, which conceived the
Grammys shortly after forming in 1957.
   ``You look at the people who began the academy. It was started
by the Nat `King' Coles, the big band people, the jazz people. It
has a way of kind of perpetuating itself.''
   Though started because many artists and technicians in the
recording business were seeing their efforts go largely
unrecognized, for years the Grammy Awards seemed like one long
bloopers record for rock 'n' roll fans.
   Though Presley never won a Grammy for rock, he received the Bing
Crosby Award for ``members of the recording industry who, during
their lifetimes, have made creative contributions of outstanding
artistic or scientific significance'' in 1971. Presley did win
three times for gospel albums, and twice _ in 1967 and 1974 _ for
the same record, ``How Great Thou Art.''
   Winners for record of the year include Percy Faith, Tony Bennett
and Herb Alpert. Robert Goulet, the Starland Vocal Band and the
Swingle Singers have all been cited as best new artist.
   The album of the year in 1960 was Bob Newhart's ``Button Down
Mind.'' Two of rock's greatest singles, the Rolling Stones' ``(I
Can't Get No) Satisfaction'' and Bob Dylan's ``Like a Rolling
Stone'' came out in 1965, but the best contemporary single Grammy
went to Roger Miller's ``King of the Road.''
   From 1966 to 1978, there was no category for best rock 'n' roll
record. In 1975, writer Pete Hamill earned a Grammy for best album
notes for Dylan's ``Blood on the Tracks,'' though what he wrote was
deleted after the first pressing.
   The same year, Bruce Springsteen released ``Born to Run,'' but
the winner for record of the year was the Captain &amp; Tenille's
``Love Will Keep Us Together.''
   Greene is a former musician and Grammy basher who decided the
only way to beat the system was to join it. He worked his way
through the academy in the early 1980s and after being elected
president in 1985, gently nudged the Grammys away from Tin Pan
Alley.
   Categories for hard rock-metal, contemporary blues, new age and
rap have been added. The Rolling Stones, Fats Domino and Paul
McCartney received Lifetime Achievement Awards. But what about all
those Perry Como fans? Were they ready to step aside for Public
Enemy and Living Colour?
   ``When I became chairman we had around 5,000 members,'' Greene
said. ``We now are up to 8,000. Those additional 3,000 are as a
result of membership outreach programs to communities we had not
addressed before: rap, metal, new age, Hispanic.
   ``I refer it to as the graying of the academy membership. We had
to come up with a formula which wouldn't disenfranchise the older
membership. I think you can ask anyone; it's not a problem anymore.
Those people who really had a problem, they had a choice to get
with the program or step aside.''

<HEAD>Garry Shandling Host for Star-Studded Salute to Recording Artists</HEAD>

   The rambling, slow speech is the nemesis of
any television awards show. So how did comedian Garry Shandling get
picked to be host of the three-hour CBS telecast of the 32nd annual
Grammy Awards?
   ``Well, you know, I hosted the ACE awards a few years ago, and,
and, and uh, uh, it went well and it really wasn't a problem with
uh, my, my delivery,'' the droll Shandling explains.
   ``It's not, it's really not that slow. You know I'm laid back
but _ I put it more as laid back _ I've never had anyone actually
come up to me and say, `Speak faster,' other than my girlfriend in
the heat of an argument.''
   The National Academy of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences will present
its coveted Grammys for the best music of 1989 at the cavernous
Shrine Auditorium on Wednesday.
   Don Henley and his thoughtful ``The End of the Innocence'' album
was nominated for four top awards, leading a host of pop and rock
veterans up for more awards or receiving long-overdue consideration
for Grammys.
   Henley, who has one solo Grammy to his credit and four from his
old days with the Eagles, had his LP nominated for album of the
year and best male rock performance. The title tune is up for
record and song of the year.
   Other nominees include Bette Midler, Linda Ronstadt, Tom Petty,
Billy Joel and Bonnie Raitt, who's looking for the first Grammy in
a distinguished career. Perennial favorite Aretha Franklin could
win her 16th Grammy.
   Prince also was a major nominee, earning four of seven bids
drawn by the ``Batman'' movie soundtrack. Neneh Cherry, Indigo
Girls, Milli Vanilli, Soul II Soul and Tone Loc were nominated as
best new artists of 1989.
   Presentations will be framed by performances of nominees Harolyn
Blackwell, Larry Carlton, Rodney Crowell, Miles Davis, Fine Young
Cannibals, Herbie Hancock, Henley, Billy Joel, k.d. lang, Branford
Marsalis, Aaron Neville, Raitt, Ronstadt and Sting.
   The glitter, glamour and variety will be provided by presenters
including spunky dance queen Paula Abdul, rockers Motley Crue and
Bob Seger, breezy singer Olivia Newton-John and actress Meryl
Streep.
   So what does Shandling figure to do?
   ``I'll do a little opening monologue _ and then I understand
there's going to be some music. From what I understand there's a
lot of music on this particular awards program,'' he said.
   The connection between Shandling, star of ``It's Garry
Shandling's Show,'' and the recording industry seems a bit tenuous.
   ``I made a 45 once,'' he says, conceding: ``I have a little
catching up to do. I still have an eight-track tape system.''
   Shandling will review the award show format and write his own
material. Beyond his haircut and getting plenty of sleep the night
before, he claims no worries about the show.
   ``I guess Guns N' Roses isn't going to be making an acceptance
speech, so that takes some of the risk out,'' he says.
   ``It'll be exciting to meet a lot of the musical stars who will
be there because I've spent quite a lot of money on them. This will
be an opportunity for them to give me some of my cash back. ... I'm
certainly going to hit Paul McCartney up for $200,000.''
   McCartney and jazz trumpeter Miles Davis will receive lifetime
achievement awards. Dick Clark will be presented the Trustees
Award, and posthumous tributes will be paid to pianist-crooner Nat
``King'' Cole and pianist Vladimir Horowitz.
   In all, there were 388 nominees in 77 categories.

<HEAD>In Two Years, Kennedy Solidified Conservative Supreme Court
Majority</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court's nine members are among the
most private of public officials. They wield enormous political
power, but rarely hold news conferences or give interviews. A
recent poll indicated only one in three Americans can name any of
the nine. This, the third in an intermittent series, offers an
up-to-date look at one member of the nation's highest court.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Anthony M. Kennedy, who has solidified a
conservative Supreme Court majority since becoming a justice two
years ago Sunday, says he feels no special pressure when thrust to
center stage.
   ``People ask me, `How do you feel being the ninth vote?' I say,
`Well, I'm one of nine.' Everybody's vote makes a difference,''
Kennedy said in a rare interview.
   As the junior member, he is the last to give his views and to
cast his vote on each case during the court's secret conferences.
``If it's 5-4, my say is very important,'' Kennedy said. ``I'm
guaranteed an audience.''
   Legal scholars say Kennedy, an unassuming Californian, may
underestimate his role and impact.
   They say his appointment may have marked a turning point in the
court's history _ giving Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist the
conservative equivalent of the working liberal majority Arthur
Goldberg's appointment in 1962 gave Chief Justice Earl Warren.
   ``Over the range of cases, the Goldberg-Kennedy analogy is quite
apt. He has provided a consistent conservative vote,'' said Mike
Seidman, a law professor at Georgetown University.
   In his first full term, which ended last July, Kennedy joined
5-4 rulings that gave states greater power to regulate abortions
and allowed capital punishment for mentally retarded murderers and
killers who committed their crimes when as young as 16.
   Kennedy also provided the crucial fifth vote in a series of
rulings that outraged civil rights activists by limiting the scope
of affirmative action and federal anti-bias laws.
   He wrote for the court when it upheld drug testing for some U.S.
Customs employees and for railroad workers involved in serious
accidents.
   Kennedy's most surprising vote last year helped form a 5-4
majority to strike down a Texas law banning desecration of the U.S.
flag.
   In a recently published book, New York University law professor
Bernard Schwartz theorizes that the flag-burning law probably would
have been upheld had Kennedy not joined the court. He cites a 1974
court memorandum quoting Justice Lewis F. Powell as saying, ``The
physical integrity of the flag may be protected.''
   Kennedy replaced Powell, who retired.
   The close votes left some scars, with justices on both sides
authoring some acrimonious opinions.
   ``Last year, the rhetoric, I thought, was unfortunate. I plead
guilty,'' Kennedy said. ``It was, in part, because of the
tremendous number of issues we were trying to deal with. (It)
reflects the competitive nature of the judges.''
   He hinted that several justices at one point realized things
might be getting too competitive. ``Some of us took steps ...,''
Kennedy said before pausing and laughing. ``It could have been much
worse.''
   Kennedy said it is important to distinguish the justices'
professional relations from their personal relations. ``Of course,
we disagree, but personal relations here are good,'' he said.
   Kennedy, 53, was Ronald Reagan's third choice for the post left
vacant by Powell's retirement in June 1987.
   Reagan's nomination of conservative Judge Robert H. Bork was
rejected by the Senate after a bitter political struggle in which
Bork was portrayed as a rigid extremist. Reagan's second choice,
Judge Douglas H. Ginsburg, withdrew after news reports that he
smoked marijuana while a law professor.
   ``On the whole, the difference between Kennedy and Bork probably
has not been dramatic,'' said Rod Smolla, a law professor at the
College of William and Mary. ``Kennedy voted the way you would
expect Bork to vote.''
   But Daniel Farber, a University of Minnesota law professor, said
Kennedy may prove to be more flexible.
   He has ``a reputation for thoughtfulness and open-mindedness,''
Farber said. ``I hope he will stake out his own positions in future
years.''
   Despite the mountain of work, more than 400 appeals, handed to
Kennedy when he arrived, he had little trouble getting accustomed
to the change from his life as a judge on the 9th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals in his native Sacramento, Calif.
   He worked as a federal appellate judge for 12 years after a
career in law and as a lobbyist in the Legislature.
   ``I worked hard in the 9th Circuit, but I would say there's
three times more work here,'' Kennedy said. ``Obviously, there's
not three times more hours in a day so the intensity level is
different.''
   Kennedy often works six days a week at the court's impressive
building, arriving by 5:30 or 6 most mornings. His office offers a
striking view of the U.S. Capitol across the street.
   He also works each evening in a basement office at his suburban
Virginia home, he said, ``but I switch to non-work related reading
after eight.''
   His evenings are spent quietly, reading and talking to his wife,
Mary, a former elementary school teacher whom he married 25 years
ago. ``We aren't much for television,'' he said.
   The couple's three grown children live in California.
   For years a part-time professor of constitutional law at the
University of the Pacific's McGeorge School of Law in Sacramento,
Kennedy now enjoys traveling to law schools for lectures and
speeches.
   ``That's one thing about the job change,'' he said. ``When I get
invited someplace now, Mary gets invited. We enjoy traveling
together.''

<HEAD>Star Watch: `Gigi' Maintains Active Career at Age 58</HEAD>

   That famous gamin quality still shines in
Leslie Caron's face, but an air of worldliness has been added to
the star who entranced the film world as Lili and Gigi.
   That's only natural, since the French actress-dancer at 58 has
weathered 40 years in films. She maintains an active career, both
as actress, writer and, she hopes, as director. But don't ask her
to dance.
   ``Dancing _ oh, no!'' she declares. ``It gets too hard.
   ``The last time I was lured on the stage, my swan song was the
utmost. I can't do anything to come close to that: I dance seven
minutes with Baryshnikov and Nureyev. I am the only dancer ever to
do that with both of them on a stage. It was for a charity event at
the Met, if you please.
   ``After that, I bowed out.''
   Caron returned to Hollywood for the launching of a new film,
``Courage Mountain.'' It's an update of the ``Heidi'' saga, with
Juliette Caton as the adolescent Swiss heroine and Charlie Sheen as
her army sweetheart. Caron plays the stern, iron-willed
headmistress of Heidi's boarding school in Italy. The school is
caught in the turmoil of the start of World War I, and the
schoolgirls escape over the Alps to safety, pursued by a villainous
Italian.
   ``I've been associated with children's stories quite a lot in my
career _ all those little girl parts,'' observed the star. ``I
should think that was why they asked me to play in this film.
   ``But lately I haven't been playing such nice characters.
Immediately after `Courage Mountain,' I played a madam in a
bordello and in the same year I played Coco Chanel, a woman of
tremendous authority.
   ``This role was nice; I felt like I was playing a schoolmarm who
was a little bit crazy, so intense about her teaching and the
education of those children and the forming of their minds. She was
rather a dear lady. I enjoyed playing that.
   ``I saw her as a kind of pioneer. I based her character a little
bit on the Bloomsbury set _ Virginia Woolf and all those women with
high ideals. I went much farther than the part demanded, but this
is what I had in mind.''
   Leslie Caron became an immediate star in 1951 when Gene Kelly
picked her out of Roland Petit's Paris ballet to dance with him in
``An American in Paris.'' She was barely 16, the daughter of a
French chemist and an American dancer. She followed with such films
as ``Lili,'' ``The Glass Slipper,'' ``Daddy Long Legs'' (with Fred
Astaire), the Oscar-winning ``Gigi,'' ``Fanny,'' ``Father Goose''
(with Cary Grant) and ``Promise Her Anything.''
   What does she remember fondly of her Hollywood years?
   ``Gene Kelly's house on Saturday night. It was open house; there
were no keys on the locks in those days. From eight o'clock on,
anyone who felt the need for a good drink and good company would
wander in. Guests would sit down at the piano or start singing or
start dancing, or just talk.
   ``There were so many entertainers there on Saturday night that
it was really quite thrilling. And always (producer-director)
Stanley Donen would be sleeping through it all.''
   What does she remember not so fondly?
   ``The iron rule of the studio (MGM) was uncomfortable,'' she
recalled. ``One was a property of the studio. It was a little
regimented; you had to do what they told you. I'm very self-willed,
as you may have noticed. I didn't always want to do the films that
the studio wanted me to do. So I would stand up to them sometimes.
That was frightening; it took some courage.
   ``Why did I leave? I just liked liberty. I didn't want to be
under contract. I tried to leave from the moment I was locked in
there. It took me eight years to get my liberty back _ which was
probably a foolish thing on my part, because I think the studio
system was good, especially for actresses. You had constant work.
Had I been a little more intelligent and been able to work with the
system, I could have found some parts. I could have worked, instead
of being rebellious as I was.''
   With ``The L-Shaped Room'' in 1962, she proved she was a
dramatic actress as well as a dancer. Her three marriages _ to
meat-packing heir George Hormel, British director Peter Hall and
American director Michael Laughlin _ ended in divorce.
   With her two children by Hall on their own, she has engaged in a
wide range of activities, from serving on film festival juries to
writing short stories and, next, directing.
   ``I've been writing a script and I want to direct it,'' she
said. ``It's my third script, and I want to direct this one. I'd
love to start on that profession. Don't tell me it's a bit late, I
don't believe it.
   ``It's an experience actors want to have gone through. I think
every actor always has wanted to do that. Usually they stop after
one experience. Charlie Laughton directed one film, so did Albert
Finney.'' Also: Frank Sinatra, Kirk Douglas, Jack Lemmon, Marlon
Brando.
   For the past 13 years, Caron has maintained her home in Paris.
   ``Sometimes I think it's too nice there,'' she said. ``Sometimes
you can just be lulled away by the wonderful, wonderful things that
happen in Paris: premieres, theater, films, dinners, friends. You
could just waste your life away doing pleasant things, not working.
I'm a hard-working person; I love to work.''

<DATELINE>WESTERLY, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>

   Long before cable broadcaster Ted Turner
began coloring black-and-white prints, Margaret Spargo was adding a
blush to the cheeks or a splash of color to the dresses of the
subjects in her monochrome portraits.
   Almost daily she sits at a little red table in the window of her
storefront studio, with its old bellows camera in back and its
shelves piled high with papers, photographs and tools of her trade,
carefully coloring photographs by hand.
   Propped around her are examples of her handiwork, a technique
that is regaining popularity in art schools. That makes little
impression on her.
   Spargo, who won't reveal her age, is a woman of few words,
especially describing how she learned her technique nearly 60 years
ago.
   ``I just did it on my own. Don't ask me how I learned. I just
did it,'' she says.
   Working from detailed notes about her subjects, she deftly dabs
nearly transparent oil paint with a piece of cotton onto the faces
of a mother, father and son. She had spent several painstaking
hours working with a colored pencil and brush to match the woman's
blue print dress.
   ``That was a Lulu. It's not quite right, but it's close,'' she
said, admiring her work and wistfully recalling the days when
clothes were plainer.
   She works quickly, with widening circular strokes. If she
strays, the paint can be wiped away until it fully dries in about a
day. The artistry comes in blending the colors and highlighting the
features, so the boy's blue eyes have a lifelike, almost impish
sparkle.
   In Spargo's typical unconcerned attitude, she can't tell you how
long it takes her to finish a typical photograph.
   ``That sounds silly, but I've never timed myself. People are
much too scientific about things,'' she said.
   A typical 8- by 10-inch tinted portrait of one person costs $50,
but if the customer wants Spargo to color with heavier opaque oils
that must be brushed on, it will cost $200.
   Hand coloring emerged in the 1840s, shortly after
daguerreotypes, the first commercially viable photos taken on glass
plates, said David Gibney, negative archivist of the International
Museum of Photography in Rochester, N.Y.
   At first, a little blush was added to the cheeks and a splash of
color to jewelry. Fully tinted photos became popular after the turn
of the century until color photo materials improved and became
affordable in the 1940s.
   ``I think a lot of sins that the camera's lens brings out can be
hidden with hand coloring, and you can enhance the good things,''
Gibney said.
   It made its resurgence in college fine art programs during the
past 10 years as an art form, said E. Ken White, chairman of fine
art photography at the Rochester Institute of Technology and
himself a hand colorer.
   Workers at John G. Marshall Manufacturing Co. in Chicago, the
major distributor of the special oils, only know they've shipped
many more paint kits lately.
   ``We get calls every day from practically all over the world,''
said Margaret Heft, who helps assemble the kits. ``I've worked for
the company for nine years and every year it's increased.''
   She estimated the company ships about 50,000 tubes of paint and
kits a year directly to customers, compared with about 20,000 a
decade ago, and about 10 times that number are shipped through an
affiliated wholesaler.
   Even the best color print will begin to age in five years, but
hand-colored photos can last 50 years without much deterioration,
White said.
   Hand-colored prints of still-lifes or scenery became a major
industry around the turn of the century, with photographers such as
Wallace Natting of Boston maintaining stables of retouchers, he
said.
   ``It's hard to visit an antiques store in New England and not
find a Wallace Natting hanging on the wall somewhere,'' White said.
   Spargo doesn't recall all the specifics of when she got into the
business. She only remembers that it was sometime in the 1930s and
she was 19 when she went to work for photographer Fred Stiles at
his downtown studio.
   She was dissuaded from becoming a nurse by her older sister who
worked at the local hospital for a summer, so she went to Stiles,
who had shot her parents' wedding photos.
   ``I just thought I wanted to do something that I would learn
something, not just a job,'' she said, but after the first day of
retouching the photo of a boy to remove his freckles, she almost
went looking elsewhere.
   Stiles ``told me it looked like a hen scratched it, which it
probably did,'' she said.
   But Spargo persevered under a succession of owners and four
years later bought the studio. It was at a national photography
workshop at Winona Lake, Ind., where she went to learn more about
commercial photography, that she took up hand coloring.
   Spargo had planned to do color photography, but the great
hurricane of 1938 wiped out much of Westerly, and made supplies
hard to get. After that, other things came up and she just never
got around to it.
   ``I don't know why,'' she said.
   She also does a good business in copying and retouching old
photographs, but discourages people from getting them hand colored
because they probably don't know what the true colors were.
   In her own way, she hews to tradition, even while adding color
to black and white, and that's why she doesn't like the new trend
toward colorizing movies.
   ``I like them better (in black and white). They were made that
way. Why change them,'' she said. ``It's just a notion I have.''

<HEAD>Music Makers: Keeping the Blues Dirty</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Something strange has been happening lately to
bluesman Bobby Radcliff. The bikers and flying beer bottles have
disappeared from his concerts. No guns, no knives, no cops.
   Suddenly, his audiences are no longer confined to drunks, aging
beatniks and hippies. Yuppies like him, jazz collectors, too. How,
Radcliff worries, can he keep the blues dirty in front of people so
well-behaved?
   ``I've been in these rough and tumble clubs most of my life,''
said the 39-year-old singer-guitarist, whose first national release
is called ``Dresses too Short.''
   ``Just in the last year we played at CBGB's, and that went over
really well and freaked me out a little bit. All of a sudden you're
playing in these big places and it's a little unnerving,'' he said
of the New York club.
   ``We played at the Ritz last week. You're playing in front of 10
times an audience. I've been in these small clubs where people are
right in your face. You know what they're thinking, what they're
feeling. And you know how to gauge their response level. You'll
play a note and they'll go, `Yeah.'''
   Not that Radcliff is complaining. He has no wish to return to
the lean times of the mid-1970s, when a dying blues scene forced
him to earn a living lifting boxes.
   But the blues is a most personal kind of music, demanding active
interchange with an audience. Radcliff remembered seeing B.B. King
in small clubs, talking up women while squeezing sounds from his
beloved guitar, ``Lucille.''
   ``The intimacy of a small place is pretty cool,'' Radcliff said.
``That's when you see an audience and a performer come together. At
a nightclub, you can start up and mellow out, go along and start up
again; you're working in a framework of three or four hours.
   ``In these big rock gigs you got to go right on up, and when I'm
off I don't feel like I'm warmed up yet.''
   Radcliff grew up in affluent Chevy Chase, Md., and by age 12 was
already checking out live shows around Howard University nearby
Washington, D.C.
   ``Our teacher let us out of school early _ he was one of these
hip teachers,'' he recalled. ``For $2.50 you'd see three acts:
Jimmy Reed, Booker T. and the MG's, Sam and Dave. Across this
street was this huge record store, and we'd go buy the records that
we had heard played.''
   Radcliff loved Elvis Presley, Johnny Cash and the other early
rock 'n' roll stars, but longed for something more. In the early
1960s, he found it: the blues, first, Slim Harpo, then Muddy
Waters, Howlin' Wolf and dozens of others. When he was 16, Radcliff
ran away from home in search of bluesman Magic Sam, who showed his
young fan around the clubs of Chicago's West Side.
   Back home, he modeled his singing on Elvis and Magic Sam and
started playing guitar in local bands, giving concerts at churches,
picnics and barbeques. By the early '70s, he was performing in
blues clubs, notably Cousin Nick's, a tiny bar in northwest
Washington.
   ``Sometimes we'd go back and hang out in the alley at the rear
of the club, and the bass player almost got his bass stolen from a
small gang of kids,'' he recalled. ``There were lots of little
mini-holdups and stuff. Some of our fans would get robbed coming in
and out of the clubs. That was kind of a rough area.''
   But Cousin Nick's closed in the mid-'70s and Radcliff bounced
around California, Albuquerque, N.M., and Washington again before
settling in New York. It was 1977, the discos days, the time of
``Saturday Night Fever'' and Donna Summer. The blues seemed
outdated and Radcliff watched his peers drop out.
   ``They got really depressed, wound up drinking themselves under
the table,'' he said. ``I guess I had some kind of deep belief that
somehow maybe it would work out, even though nothing was. There was
that deep part of me that thought there was some slim chance.''
   Now, the blues are back and Radcliff has an album on Black Top
Records. Major labels were interested, but at a price, with one
record company executive even imagining him as a cross between
Elvis and David Bowie.
   ``Dresses too Short'' is pure Radcliff. Several of the songs _
``Kool and the Gang,'' ``Going Home Tomorrow,'' ``Hard Road to
Travel'' _ have been in his live show for years, lasting as long as
the trusty white Fender guitar he's owned since the late '60s.
   ``Most people will tell me that there's so much garbage on the
radio,'' Radcliff said. ``Big companies are not really interested
in hiring a lot of alternative type bands, like blues. They want
bands they can filter through the system.
   ``A lot of the stuff that's out now is not feeling or
intellectual. I like pop myself, but I couldn't live on it.''

<HEAD>Books and Authors: Invisible Pilgrim of Latin American `Boom'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARTHUR ALLEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Twenty-five years before Gabriel Garcia Marquez
created his imaginary Macondo in ``One Hundred Years of Solitude,''
the Cuban writer Alejo Carpentier laid the literary foundations of
``magical realism'' in a visit to Haiti.
   Viewing the fantastic ruins left behind by the Emperor
Henri-Christophe, Carpentier was struck by the ``marvelous
reality'' of Latin America, where collective faith in the
supernatural wrought incredible alterations on the real world.
   Garcia Marquez once remarked that if Franz Kafka had lived in
Latin America, he would have been considered a realist. But it was
Carpentier's matter-of-fact treatment of the magical in ``The
Kingdom of This World'' _ where the protagonist turns into a fly _
that marked a turning point in the Latin American novel.
   In recent months Farrar, Straus Giroux has released ``The
Kingdom'' and three other works by Carpentier in paperback
editions. Given the steady popularity of Latin American fiction
among American readers in the past decade, the attention paid to
this silent forerunner of the ``boom'' is welcome.
   Carpentier, who was born in 1904 and died in 1980, had the
misfortune to be ahead of his time. When ``The Kingdom of This
World'' and ``The Lost Steps'' were first translated in the 1950s
both flopped. His fascination with the African sources of Caribbean
culture may have left American readers cold 30 years ago, but it is
timely today given the renewed interest in the music, food and
culture of the region.
   The other new editions are ``Explosion in a Cathedral,'' also
quickly remaindered after its 1962 publication, and ``The Chase,''
published in Spanish in 1956 and never before translated.
   Carpentier's writing is intensely sophisticated and less
light-spirited than that of Carlos Fuentes, Mario Vargas Llosa and
Garcia Marquez, all of whom acknowledge a debt to him. As one of
the first Latin American writers to appeal to a worldwide audience,
he had to lay down firm roots in European traditions that later
``boom'' writers were able to transcend.
   Like so many other Latin American writers, Carpentier went to
Paris as a political refugee. In the '30s he was associated,
through his interest in avant-garde music, with some of the
founders of modernism _ Picasso, the dadaist Tristan Tzara, the
surrealists Louis Aragon and Andre Breton.
   It was French surrealism, in Carpentier's words, ``that taught
me to see textures, aspects of Latin American life that I had not
noticed.''
   Carpentier abandoned the naturalistic novel, what he called
``those poor slices of life that fill bookshop windows with their
pages that smell of cheap boarding houses and civil servants'
dandruff,'' to investigate the unique, baroque quality of Latin
American reality.
   A 1943 visit to Haiti, and further explorations in the depths of
the South American continent, led him to the realization that Latin
American consciousness, so different from that of North America and
Europe, required a new literary vision.
   His novels are remarkable for their coverage of a variety of
themes in modern Latin American fiction _ ``not only the major
waves but even the lesser ripples,'' as Terry J. Peavler, a Latin
American literature profsesor at Penn State University, has written.
   In ``Explosion in a Cathedral,'' he describes the ravages of the
French Revolution on the Caribbean, bringing to light a forgotten
chapter of history while probing the contradictions inherent in
revolutionary movements.
   Some of the same territory is covered in ``The Chase,'' the
story of the intermingled lives of a ticket-taker at a concert hall
and a misguided student activist, in the Cuba of the '30s.
   ``The Lost Steps,'' a clear precursor to Mario Vargas Llosa's
latest book, ``The Storyteller,'' and a cousin to Thomas Mann's
``Death in Venice,'' explores the protean lure of indigenous
spiritualism for the inhabitants of modern civilization.
   While Carpentier was a man of the left, his books are far from
sanguine in their assessment of revolutionary politics.
   In the closing pages of ``Explosion in a Cathedral,'' the two
main characters offer soliloquies that might be taken as
expressions of Carpentier's dualistic view of revolution.
   Victor, a charismatic cynic, speaks of playing ``so many parts
that I no longer know which one I should be playing. I've put on so
many costumes I no longer know which is the right one.''
   His lover, Sofia, responds: ``Perhaps that is the most splendid
thing the Revolution has done, to have altered more than one
person's ideas.''
   Carpentier's greatest works were produced in the '40s and '50s
when he lived in Venezuela. In 1959, he returned enthusiastically
to Havana after Fidel Castro's triumph.
   The Cuban poet, Heberto Padilla, recounts an espisode in the
early '60s, when Carpentier had been called to Paris to receive a
literary prize. When he failed to appear for the ceremony, Cuban
Embassy officials panicked, afraid he had defected, Padilla said.
They were relieved to learn he had simply skipped off for a
vacation with a girlfriend.
   ``The Cuban government never trusted him,'' said Donald Shaw, a
University of Virginia professor who has written a book on
Carpentier. ``His attitude toward them was always ambiguous, and
their reception of him was equally ambiguous.''
   Carpentier directed the state publishing house until 1968, when
he was dismissed and sent to Paris as a cultural attache. When he
died, his body was returned to Havana for a state funeral
procession headed by Castro himself.

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Whitey Shafer Writes About Marriage</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Lyndia cq 7th graf.</NOTE>

<DATELINE>NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Three failed marriages helped country
music songwriter Sanger D. ``Whitey'' Shafer to compose the
memorable ``All My Ex's Live in Texas.''
   In fact, he wrote the amusing ditty _ recorded by George Strait
_ with his fourth wife's assistance. The 1987 song is probably
Shafer's best known work in a 25-year composing career that's
yielded 200 recorded tunes.
   ``I think I've written something about everything that's ever
been written about,'' the 55-year-old Shafer said recently.
   His wry look at former spouses, embellished by the catchy title,
became one of the most popular country songs of the past decade.
Local country music bands everywhere have the song in their
repertoire.
   The tune also helped Strait win the prestigious ``Entertainer of
the Year'' award from the Country Music Association last year.
   And attention all those ex's: the royalties helped Shafer, too.
   He and current wife, Lyndia, who have been married eight years,
wrote the song about his three ex-wives. It's not malicious, and
listeners tend to feel sorry for the fellow in the song who can't
even return to the river where he learned how to swim.
   ``That's why I hang my hat in Tennessee,'' the song says.
   ``He'd like to go to Texas, but things are kinda hot down
there,'' explained Shafer, born and raised in the Waco, Texas,
area. ``It was a fun song to write. I did change the names to
protect the guilty.''
   The rhyming title, which has become one of the most famous in
country music, is a followup to a punchy line he wrote in the 1970s
for another song: ``I was following the rodeos in Texas and being
chased by the fathers of my ex's.''
   ``Some titles don't tell the whole story, but this one did,''
said Shafer, who got the nickname ``Whitey'' in high school because
of his light-colored hair.
   He gives Strait, a fellow Texan, credit for taking a chance on
the song others considered inappropriate.
   ``I think if he had not have cut that, it would never have been
recorded,'' Shafer said. ``People are funny about cutting cute
songs, but that one just had something about it. It was too cute to
pass up.
   ``I wish I had a bushel basket full like that one.''
   The inevitable question is whether his three ex-wives really do
live in Texas and how they reacted to the song. ``They do live
there, but one sort of drifts back and forth between California and
Texas,'' Shafer said.
   He's not sure how two of them feel, but ex-wife Darlene took it
fine.
   ``We're still friends,'' he said.
   Last year, Shafer wrote the hit song ``I Wonder Do You Think of
Me,'' which was the first tune released by country singer Keith
Whitley after Whitley died in May of an accidental overdose of
alcohol. It was a No. 1 record.
   ``I liked him a whole lot and he'd been to my house a lot when
he first came to town,'' Shafer said. ``He was a heck of a talent,
a great singer and was only getting better as he went on. He also
had a great personality.''
   Some of Shafer's other top songs include ``Does Fort Worth Ever
Cross Your Mind,'' recorded by Strait; ``That's the Way Love
Goes,'' a No. 1 country music record by both Merle Haggard and
Johnny Rodriguez; and ``I Never Go Around Mirrors,'' also recorded
by Whitley.
   Shafer moved to Nashville from Texas in the mid-1960s with the
idea of becoming a singer. He did some performing, but found the
competition stiff.
   ``There were too many singers,'' he recalled. So he turned to
songwriting.
   ``For some reason, I've always been able to retain a string of
notes I've heard,'' he said. ``It just seems like I know what kind
of idea will go with a certain melody.''
   Shafer, who recently was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters
Hall of Fame, describes himself as a writer of traditional country
music with little interest in pop oriented styles. Give him a few
beers and his favorite instrument and he'll come up with a country
song.
   ``It just seemed like a guitar and six pack went together,'' he
said.
   ``Right now I like to write love songs because I'm in love. When
I was rough and rowdy, I wrote rough and rowdy songs.''
   But he says country music's honky-tonk songs glorifying alcohol,
such as Hank Williams' ``There's a Tear in My Beer,'' aren't as
popular as they used to be.
   ``Drinking and getting drunk is not hip any more. People don't
like to see it. It's almost indignant to be tipsy. People just
don't want to mess with people who can't control their lives.''

   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. said its parent
company was filing for federal bankruptcy court protection,
signaling the demise of the Wall Street firm that became synonymous
with riches and scandal during the go-go 1980s.
   Drexel's board of directors on Tuesday authorized the parent,
Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc., to seek protection from
creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy code.
   The step climaxes one of the most tumultuous periods in Wall
Street history for the cocksure investment house, which pioneered
the use of risky, high-interest ``junk bonds'' to finance billions
of dollars worth of corporate takeovers under its now-indicted
executive Michael Milken.

   NEW YORK _ The impact of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s stunning
decline reaches like an octopus past Wall Street and the risky IOUs
known as junk bonds, potentially threatening the health of many
businesses that depend on financial markets to raise money.
   A Drexel bankruptcy filing could inject more sellers into the
already depressed junk bond market that the firm dominates,
creating a confidence crisis that might spread into stocks,
higher-grade corporate debt and other securities, investment
experts and business executives said Tuesday.
   Such turmoil in turn would affect the broader economy, possibly
by pushing interest rates and the dollar higher in opposition to
government attempts to sustain economic growth.

   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s demise could reach
far beyond the junk-bond sensation it created, forcing interest
rates higher, hurting the financing ability of many U.S. companies
and possibly creating new takeover opportunities for foreign buyers.
   Investment strategists and business executives said Tuesday that
these were the types of economic consequences to expect from
Drexel's decision to seek Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, even
though the investment bank is nowhere near the largest.
   ``When we had the explosion and problems at Three Mile Island,
it impacted the entire utilities industry,'' said Paul E. Berg,
president of Berg Fiduciary Consultants, a investment advisory firm
in Port Chester, N.Y. ``You've got pretty much the same situation
here.''
   The Drexel bankruptcy filing could inject more sellers into the
already depressed junk bond market that the firm dominates,
creating a confidence crisis that might spread into other
securities, some experts said.
   Such turmoil in turn could have a more profound effect by
forcing interest rates higher, at a time when many economists say
interest rates must come down if the economy is to avoid a
recession.
   ``This means that the cost of capital to the United States will
increase,'' said Chriss Street, a strategist at Seidler Amdec
Securities Inc., a Los Angeles investment firm. ``The cost of
capital overseas will be relatively lower. We should expect a lot
of acquisitions by foreigners.''
   To the surprise of some, the market for junk bonds survived a
wave of paranoia Tuesday, and prices of many issues actually
stabilized. Managers of several junk-bond mutual funds said they
didn't receive any flood of calls from investors who wanted to get
out.
   But others said the market's behavior reflected confusion about
the ultimate impact of Drexel's problems, and they predicted that
over the next several days at least the demand for junk bonds would
stall.
   ``It's going to be very difficult to find buyers for that
paper,'' said Jack Barbanel, managing director of First Global
Asset Management, a Princeton, N.J., investment concern. ``You'll
find many sellers but not many buyers.''
   Many expressed surprise at the frightening speed with which
Drexel hurtled toward collapse because of the junk bond market it
largely was responsible for creating in the 1980s.
   ``It took a long time to string together this enterprise, and
not much time at all for it to crack up,'' said James Grant, author
of a prominent financial newsletter that frequently has warned
against the perils of junk-bond debt. ``It's not unlike the
collapse of Tyson in Tokyo.''
   Others likened Drexel's demise to a disaster that will further
erode the tarnished credibility of the depressed securities
industry overall and convince investors to shun investments that
have no relation to junk bonds.
   This could force companies that historically have relied on
selling stocks and bonds for new capital to curtail spending plans,
lay off workers or even seek bankruptcy protection themselves.
   Meanwhile, banks, insurers, pension funds, mutual funds and
other investors who bought junk bonds because they promised such
high rates of interest could wind up owning nearly worthless pieces
of paper, some financial strategists said.
   ``Now the reality is beginning to sink in, it's coming home to
roost, that when people originally called them `junk bonds,' that's
exactly what they were,'' Barbanel said.
   Others emphasized, however, that the overall amount of junk
bonds held by most investors remains only a tiny percentage of
their portfolios. The total value of assets held just by pension
funds, for example, is more than $2.5 trillion, while the entire
junk bond market once amounted to about $200 billion.
   ``If everybody owned a piece of a junk bond it would be pretty
small,'' said William Overgard, director of investment consulting
at Buck Pension Fund Services in New York.
   Drexel vaulted to prominence in the 1980s by aggressively
peddling high-interest securities with low credit ratings as a way
to raise money for businesses seeking to expand. The securities
became known as junk bonds because of their relatively higher risk
of default compared with investment-grade corporate bonds.
   Even before Drexel's latest problems, a number of prominent
deals that depended on junk-bond financing had begun unraveling or
faced serious obstacles. Drexel played a role in many of them.
   On Tuesday, for example, Drexel client Integrated Resources
Inc., a diversified financial services company that has been
struggling for months, sought federal bankruptcy protection.

   Integrated Resources Inc., which tried to build
a financial services empire with junk-bond financing provided by
Drexel Burnham Lambert, sought federal bankruptcy court protection
within hours of Drexel's own filing.
   Integrated sought Chapter 11 protection Tuesday after some of
its creditors balked at restructuring more than $1.6 billion in
debt.
   Unlike Drexel's filing, the move by Integrated wasn't a
surprise. Integrated has been struggling since defaulting on nearly
$1 billion in debt last June.
   The bankruptcy proceedings of the two companies are bound to be
intertwined. Drexel, Wall Street's junk bond leader, is
Integrated's fifth-largest creditor.
   Trading in Integrated was temporarily halted on the New York
Stock Exchange after Tuesday's announcement. It later closed
sharply lower at around 17 cents a share, down from 25 cents Monday.
   Integrated officials said they were forced to file for
protection under Chapter 11 of federal bankrutpcy laws because a
few creditors refused to negotiate the debt restructuring. The
creditors had filed or planned to file legal complaints against
Integrated.
   The company, which said it hoped to resume talks with creditors
soon, said the creditors had the ability to seize Integrated's
assets to satisfy their individual claims.
   ``Working out a consenual out-of-court reorganization depends on
the good faith of substantially all the creditors,'' Chairman
Stephen D. Weinroth said in an interview. ``We were spending too
much time and too much money trying to stave off actions where the
ultimate outcome was not in doubt.
   ``Sooner or later they were going to get a judgment,'' said
Weinroth, a former senior executive with Drexel who left to manage
Integrated.
   Integrated originally was a real estate company and expanded
rapidly several years ago by selling tax-sheltered investments,
eventually becoming the largest seller of those investments.
   That business was scuttled by 1986 tax-law revisions, and the
company then moved aggressively into insurance and mutual funds,
financed largely through junk bonds arranged by Drexel.
   For a while, Integrated was one of the many junk-bond financed
rags-to-riches stories. But it was unable to sell enough
real-estate partnerships, insurance policies and mutual funds to
service its debt burden and its high overhead.
   ``They had a capital situation where they were living on the
edge,'' said Leigh Walzer, a securities analyst with R.D Smith &amp;
Co. in New York. ``They were living in an age of high leverage that
made them, then unmade them.''
   Integrated's filing in U.S. Bankrutpcy Court in Manhattan
protects the company from creditors while it continues to operate
and attempts to reorganize its finances. The company said none of
its subsidiaries and affiliates is included in the filing.
   Among the subsidiaries is corporate jet manufacturer LearJet
Corp. of Wichita, Kan., which earlier this week agreed to be sold
for $60 million to an investment group that includes the management
of Savannah, Ga.-based Gulfstream Aerospace. Weinroth said he
doesn't expect any major delays in winning the bankruptcy court's
approval for the sale.
   The LearJet purchase by the management group is part of a
two-part deal that also involves the group's acquisition of
Gulfstream from Chrysler Corp. for $825 million.
   Weinroth said Integrated's liabilities totaled $1.961 billion as
of June 30, the latest date for which results are available. That
included $1.62 billion in long- and short-term debt, with junk
bonds accounting for $800 million.
   Assets totaled $1.402 billion, giving Integrated a negative net
worth of $559 million, according to Weinroth.
   According to the bankruptcy court papers, Integrated said its
top 10 creditors included large banks and savings and loans, some
of which bought much of the junk bonds issued by Drexel under its
indicted former bond leader Michael Milken.
   Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. led all creditors with a total
owed of $55.84 million, followed by Chemical Bank with $51.57
million.
   Drexel ranked fifth with $41.105 million in exposure. Centrust
Savings and Loan, the Miami thrift seized less than two weeks ago
by federal regulators, ranked seventh with $39 million in public
debt.
   Integrated earlier this year sold its key financial services
businesses to Broad Inc., a Los Angeles financial services concern,
for $95 million, far less than the $450 million Integrated had
hoped to receive.
   A few other units have been either liquidated or sold. Weinroth
said $175 million in assets have been sold so far.
   Some analysts predicted Integrated would emerge from bankrutpcy
a shell of its former self, focusing on real estate limited
partnerships and interests in leveraged buyout operations.

   Chrysler Corp. has taken sharp
losses to cut jobs and close plants, but the leaner look and the
sale of its Gulfstream subsidiary will help the company compete in
a tough 1990 auto market, Chairman Lee A. Iacocca said.
   A $664-million fourth-quarter loss and a 66 percent drop in
earnings for 1989 means no profit-sharing for hourly workers and no
bonuses for salaried employees, Iacocca said Tuesday.
   But savings of $1.2 billion from the company's cost-cutting
program should come through in time to help 1990 profits, although
prospects for the first quarter remain doubtful, he said.
   ``We've got our capacity down. Our cash position just got a
little better, and we're focused,'' Iacocca said.
   Analysts agreed.
   ``They are coming to grips with getting rid of some of this
excess capacity and that's going to be felt in 1990,'' said Harvey
Heinbach of Merrill Lynch and Co. in New York.
   ``The outlook should be promising for them on earnings,'' said
Thomas O'Grady, president of Integrated Automotive Resources Inc.
in Wayne, Pa. ``They have written all this off in 1989, so for 1990
they have a clean slate.''
   Chrysler's first quarterly loss since 1982 came largely from a
one-time restructuring charge of $577 million, which covered costs
of closing plants, discontinuing some car models and paying pension
and severance costs to trim the white-collar work force, the
company said.
   The fourth-quarter loss, equivalent to $2.90 a share, compared
with earnings of $433 million, or $1.85 a share, in
October-December of 1988.
   Revenues for the quarter sagged to $7.9 billion from $9.3
billion a year earlier, the company said.
   For the year, Chrysler reported net income of $359 million, or
$1.55 a share, down from $1.05 billion, or $4.66 a share, in 1988.
Revenues were $34.92 billion vs. $34.15 billion in 1988.
   The fourth-quarter charge of $577 million was partly offset by a
$309 million gain on the sale of part of the company's stake in
Mitsubishi Motors Corp., the company said.
   Chrysler had an after-tax loss of $87 million before the
one-time charges.
   But Iacocca said the results reflected what he termed a
full-blown recession in auto sales, necessitating rebates of more
than $1,200 a car just to keep sales limping along.
   ``I am not in the least disappointed,'' he said.
   United Auto Workers union President Owen Bieber and Vice
President Stan Marshall, who directs the UAW's Chrysler Department,
said they regretted that earnings didn't trigger profit-sharing for
hourly workers.
   Under Chrysler's UAW contract, they said in a statement, ``At
least there will be some equality of sacrifice and Chrysler
executives will have to go without bonuses as well.''
   Chrysler has shut down its Jefferson Avenue assembly plant in
Detroit and announced plans to close its St. Louis car assembly
plant in September.
   The company announced a cost-cutting program in October aimed at
cutting $1 billion from its $26-billion annual budget by the end of
this year, including elimination of 2,300 salaried jobs. It has
since boosted the cost-cutting goal to $1.5 billion.
   The company said it agreed to sell Gulfstream for $825 million
to a partnership of Allen E. Paulson, chairman and founder of the
Savannah, Ga.-based company, and the New York investment firm of
Forstmann, Little &amp; Co.
   ``It's called restructuring to compete,'' Iacocca said. ``We
looked at the market for the early 1990s ... and it looked a little
grim. We probably could have muddled through, but we chose not to.
We chose to get ready for the '90s. It's all part of our plan.''
   ``I hear the words. I want to believe it. But the proof remains
to be seen,'' said auto analyst Charles Brady of Oppenheimer and
Co. in New York. ``The only true vote of whether you're doing your
job or not is whether you are selling cars or not.''
   Chrysler stock closed at $16.37{ on the New York Stock Exchange,
down 25 cents.
   General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. are scheduled to report
earnings Thursday.

<HEAD>New Dealer Organization Chief Says He'll Keep Pressure on
Automakers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LAS VEGAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If automakers thought they would get a breather
from pressure applied by the National Automobile Dealers
Association, they may have to think again.
   Ray Green, the new president of the National Automobile Dealers
Association, said there should be no cozy relationship between
dealers and manufacturers.
   ``If this were a real marriage, we would have been in divorce
court a long time ago,'' said Green, head of The Green Holding Co.,
which operates eight franchises in southern Illinois.
   ``Today, we are looking at some differences with the
manufacturers that go to the very core of our relationship,
differences that must be resolved if the auto dealerships in this
country are to survive, much less thrive,'' Green said Tuesday at
the close of NADA's four-day convention.
   NADA figures show that about half of the 25,000 dealerships in
the United States aren't making money. And NADA leaders have put
most of the blame on automakers.
   Green succeeds Ron Tonkin of Portland, Ore., who hammered
dealers for their increasing reliance on incentives, mandatory
membership in dealer advertising associations and other issues.
   ``If the manufacturers think we are just going to hide, they're
wrong,'' Green said.
   He said he planned to keep up the fights Tonkin began, and he's
planning to add a few of his own.
   He said dealers should be represented in nearly all levels of
decision-making by the automakers _ product planning and marketing,
for instance. He said that would be part of a new franchise
agreement he's working on. He hopes to get half of the automakers
to adopt the new agreement.
   In his opening address to the convention, Tonkin championed
higher dealer involvement with manufacturers and dealer
unification. Tonkin and Green said dealers and manufacturers should
approach each other at arm's length.
   But Charles Folliott, owner of The Car Store in Norwalk, Vt.,
said his relationship with manufacturers is good.
   ``If anything, I feel that manufacturer representatives are more
willing to listen,'' he said.
   Earlier this month, Chrysler Corp. showed they were more aware
of NADA when executives invited Tonkin to speak to the board of
directors. It was the first time that a dealer organization chief
addressed the board of any of the Big Three automakers.
   And manufacturers felt the clout of their dealers when, at
Tonkin's urging late last year, they began cutting their new-car
orders to trim the growing inventories on their lots. At the same
time, sales slumped and the combination of declining sales and
dealer orders prompted the companies to cut production.
   In turn, that resulted in the layoff of thousands of auto
workers.

according to a study by congressional investigators.
   The General Accounting Office, Congress' investigative arm, said
trade between the neighboring countries increased from $2.3 billion
during the recession year of 1982 to $4 billion in 1988, the
highest growth rate among major U.S. agricultural trading partners.
   While Mexico is one of the United States' best customers of
agricultural products, GAO said several problems continue to impede
trade, including stiff health regulations, import licensing
requirements, and tariffs.
   Mexican growers complain their agricultural exports are subject
to excessive U.S. plant and animal health regulations and that U.S.
tariffs on certain crops are too high. U.S. sources complain that
Mexico's continued reliance on import licensing requirements is
inconsistent with international trading laws, GAO said.
   Mexico's transportation infrastructure also has been inadequate
to handle the large increase in trade in recent years and, if not
improved, will continue to limit trade volume between the two
countries, said the study, requested by U.S. Rep. Kika de la Garza,
D-Texas.
   GAO said Mexico's rail system is outdated and lacks the capacity
to carry the increasing cargo from the United States. Storage
facilities are also lacking and rail cars are used instead to store
grain or other goods.
   Due to delays in returning rail cars to the United States and
congestion at the border, GAO said, U.S. rail companies refused
several times last year to accept any Mexican-bound shipments,
imposing a de facto embargo.
   Roads in Mexico are in general disrepair, making transportation
of goods by truck a slow process. U.S. truckers, meanwhile,
complain that they cannot operate in Mexico while Mexican truckers
can enter the United States with their cargo.
   Another problem, GAO said, is that congestion, bottlenecks and
excessive delays characterize conditions at border crossing points.
   Saul Mercado, director for Latin American affairs at the Texas
Department of Agriculture, said another problem for Texas exporters
is that railroad rates are higher in-state than for out-of-state
shippers, making it cheaper for someone from Kansas to get his
grain to the border than a Texan.
   Mexican trucks can carry heavier loads than Texas law permits,
requiring much costly loading and unloading at the border, Mercado
said.
   Mexico is the No. 1 buyer of Texas' agricultural products,
Mercado said.
   ``We export every day livestock and grain and all kinds of
commodities to Mexico,'' Mercado said.
   The state, which has a positive balance of trade with Mexico,
lists its top exports as cattle for breeding, sheep, goats and hogs
for slaughter, and a few dairy cows and some horses. The state also
ships corn, sorghum, rice and some wheat.
   Mexico provides the United States with tropical products and
specialty crops such as coffee and tomatoes.
   Mexico's outstanding external debt, which totaled more than $100
billion in 1988, is also a major constraint to trade, GAO said.
   Despite those problems, Mexico bought more agricultural products
from the United States than all but three other countries in 1988 _
Japan, South Korea and the Soviet Union _ with a total value of
$2.23 billion.
   Mexico, in turn, ranked third among all agricultural suppliers
to the United States, after Canada and Brazil, providing the U.S.
with $1.82 billion in foodstuffs two years ago.
   The United States had a positive agricultural trade balance in
1988 with Mexico of about $414 million.

<HEAD>Merv Griffin's Resorts Casino Hotel Leaders Tout Gaming Hall's
Future</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LAWRENCE, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Merv Griffin's Resorts Casino Hotel in
Atlantic City will revive and have a stable financial future,
leaders of the firm predict.
   Those assurances were made Tuesday to the Casino Control
Commission despite recent troubles that forced the casino's parent
firm into bankruptcy court.
   The casino, Atlantic City's oldest, plans to pump more than $45
million into much-needed capital improvements this year and next
year so it can compete with rival gaming halls again, officials
told the commission.
   State gaming enforcement officials, however, said they believe
financial projections made by casino officials are too optmisitic
and the cloud of bankruptcy leaves the operation open to problems.
   The commission is holding a series of hearings to determine if
the casino's license should be renewed.
   Griffin, who purchased Resorts International in 1988 from
billionaire developer Donald Trump, attended the hearing but did
not testify before the commission. Resorts International is the
casino's parent firm.
   During a break in the proceeding, Griffin said he is ``extremely
confident'' his new management team can turn around the casino's
fortunes.
   The entertainer and television game show mogul said Resorts'
location next to Trump's huge, soon-to-open Taj Mahal Casino puts
it in a prime spot to grab business from ``what will be the
epicenter of activity on the boardwalk.''
   ``I believe in Atlantic City and I believe in Resorts,'' said
Griffin. ``I believe that our ideas and marketing plan will bring
it right back to being one of the top three casinos on the
boardwalk.''
   Facing huge debts, Resorts International in December filed a
reorganization plan in federal bankruptcy court that seeks to get
rid of about two-thirds of its $912 million debt by allowing
Griffin to swap 78 percent of his Resorts stock. The plan still
requires approval from the firm's bondholders and the Casino
Control Commission.
   Deputy Attorney General Mary Jo Flaherty, of the commission's
gaming enforcement division, said the bankruptcy court proceedings
are costly and give Resorts a stigma that will make it tougher to
resolve its financial problems.
   ``If Resorts remains on a bankruptcy track, they will not be
able to maintain a competitive position,'' Ms. Flaherty said.
   David C. Hanlon, president and chief operating officer of
Resorts, said he expects the company to be out of bankruptcy by the
early summer.
   Ms. Flaherty said casino officials have crafted a recovery plan
that is too optimistic in its projections of how much business the
casino can attract. She said the casino in 1989 accounted for nine
percent of the space in Atlantic City, but had only eight percent
of the market.
   Hanlon, however, said 1989 was an abberration and insisted that
the casino's projections of revenue ``can't get any more
conservative. I have a high level of confidence in these numbers.''
   Hanlon said Resorts' business has lagged because the casino is
in woeful physical shape compared to its competition, a condition
the present ownership said it did not anticipate when it bought the
property. He said a capital improvement plan to pump $35 million in
1990 and $10.5 million in 1991 will remedy this problem.
   ``Since 1983, there was little or no refurbishment at the
facility at a time when every other major facility was making
improvements,'' Hanlon said. ``From a physical, systems and
technological point of view, we're well behind everyone else in
town. People went elsewhere, and those who stayed did so as a
matter of habit.''
   Hanlon said he expects a great deal of the physical improvements
at the casino to be completed by the time the Taj Mahal, touted as
the world's biggest casino, opens in April.
   The hearing is expected to continue Thursday.

<HEAD>Gulfstream, Learjet Make Paulson Main Man in Corporate Aviation</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto SAV1 of Feb. 13</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Allen Paulson's name and telephone number have
been in the Rolodex of corporate jet shoppers for years. Now,
prospective buyers of Learjets will be looking for him, too.
   Paulson and his investment partner, New York-based Forstmann
Little &amp; Co., bought Chrysler Corp.'s Gulfstream Aerospace Corp.
subsidiary Tuesday for $825 million in cash, and in a separate deal
agreed to purchase Learjet Corp. from Integrated Resources Inc. for
$60 million.
   Paulson becomes the main man in corporate aviation with
Gulfstream's small and medium-sized jets and the sleek and speedy
Learjets. He founded Gulfstream in 1978 and said owning it again
``is like having your baby back.''
   New York-based Integrated had been trying to sell Learjet since
last August. Integrated filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
reorganization Tuesday. For Chrysler, the Gulfstream deal buoyed
spirits on the day the company reported its first quarterly loss
since 1982.
   ``If I had a company that really needed its own plane, the G-IV
would be right at the top of my list. But if I go out to look at
one of those and out of the corner of my eye, I see a fleet of
Lears, maybe I buy one of those, too,'' said Charles Brady, an auto
analyst with Oppenheimer &amp; Co. in New York who has followed
Gulfstream.
   Brady said Chrysler's sale of Gulfstream, which it bought from
Paulson for $637 million in 1985, was a good move given Chrysler's
current concentration on building cars and trucks. Chrysler still
wants to sell Electrospace Systems and Airborne Systems, the other
two pieces of Chrysler Technologies Corp.
   Gulfstream, the biggest piece of Chrysler Technologies, was
carrying its weight, showing at least a year's backlog of orders
for the planes it makes at three plants in Georgia, Oklahoma and
California. Savannah, Ga.-based Gulfstream employs about 5,000
workers.
   ``I took the crown jewels out of Chrysler Technologies,''
Paulson said Tuesday during a news conference in Savannah.
   Paulson said he thinks Gulfstream can be more efficient on its
own. Chrysler's board of directors voted down Paulson's suggestion
last year to make an offer for Wichita-based Learjet.
   Ronald Glantz, an auto industry analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds
Inc. in San Francisco said the story going around when Chrysler
bought Gulfstream was that Chairman Lee Iacocca, prohibited by the
federal government from having a corporate jet during the years
when Chrysler was recovering from its near bankruptcy, proved the
company's recovery was complete by buying a jet-maker instead of a
single jet.
   Government loan guarantees helped Chrysler survive in the early
1980s.
   Learjet is competing for a U.S. Air Force contract worth more
than $1 billion to produce more than 200 Tanker Transport Trainer
system aircraft to be used by New York-based Flight Safety
International Inc.
   Flight Safety has a facility adjacent to the Savannah plant
where Gulfstream customers' pilots and service representatives are
trained.
   ``We in Savannah could do a lot for the Learjet product,''
Paulson said.
   Paulson said it was too early to discuss details of the union
between Gulfstream and Learjet, but consolidation of the two
company's engineering and sales departments is possible.
   Paulson also said Gulfstream would not be forced to sell off
assets to satisfy the financing of the acquisition.

<HEAD>Maryland Tobacco Growers May End 350-Year-Old Tobacco-Tying
Tradition</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Maryland tobacco growers may soon end a centuries old tradition
of hand-tying ``hands'' of tobacco leaves, opting instead for
70-pound bales that could cut labor costs by as much as 30 percent.
   ``It's the first major change in the form of marketing tobacco
in more than 350 years,'' said Claude McKee, director of the
University of Maryland's experimental tobacco farm near Upper
Marlboro.
   The state Department of Agriculture has announced that at least
two major buyers have agreed to purchase Maryland tobacco that is
baled, and a third has given informal approval.
   McKee said he approached tobacco companies with the proposal and
has received written agreements from Phillip Morris Cos. Inc. and
Universal Leaf Tobacco Co.
   Traditionally, workers have spent the fall and winter months
preparing for the spring auction by tying bundles of 25 to 30
leaves of similar quality into a fan-shaped hand using the stem of
one leaf.
   Bales of tobacco measure three feet by two feet by one foot and
weigh about 70 pounds. McKee said buyers have expressed a desire to
have uniform bales throughout the industry.
   ``It would be a change from an antiquated way, and it could put
more money in the farmer's pocket,'' said Maryland Agriculture
Secretary Wayne Cawley.
   Whether the change occurs, however, depends on if buyers will
pay as much for baled tobacco as they do for hand-tied tobacco,
Cawley said.
   Cawley said an effort to change to bales three years ago failed
because buyers at auctions declined to pay as much for baled
tobacco.
   Baling was first used in the burley tobacco region, Kentucky,
Tennessee, West Virginia, North Carolina and Missouri, about 10
years ago and almost all burley tobacco is now baled.
   ``My feeling is that the ground has been broken,'' McKee said.
``One or two will lead the way, and the rest will follow. It could
be a big breakthrough, a real labor-saver.''

<HEAD>Rhone-Poulenc to Restart MIC Production</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KELLY P. KISSEL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>INSTITUTE, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With new emergency notification rules in
effect, a pesticide plant unit was set to resume production two
weeks after leaking the same poisonous gas that killed 3,500 people
in Bhopal, India.
   A Feb. 2 leak of methyl isocyanate at the Rhone-Poulenc plant
went unreported for three days and prompted Kanawha County
officials to demand strict notice requirements.
   ``I think we're going to have a lot of dialogue between
communities and the plants about what is expected,'' plant manager
Ron Bearer said Tuesday. ``That's one of the good things that are
going to come out of this.''
   The unit was shut down for routine maintenance Jan. 31. Two days
later, it leaked ``a small puff'' of MIC that injured seven
construction workers nearby, plant officials said. News of the leak
was made public three days later.
   Bearer said production of MIC would resume today.
   The leak prompted changes in how and when Rhone-Poulenc will
notify local emergency officials about poisonous gas leaks. The
company now intends to announce all leaks of acutely toxic
material, no matter how small, despite federal regulations that
require notification only if a pound or more of material escapes.
   ``We're still working through the agencies about exactly what
that does mean,'' Bearer said. ``One molecule is not what they
want. We're literally treating it as any kind of release at all.''
   Bearer also said he didn't believe the strict reporting
requirements had to be adopted by other Rhone-Poulenc plants or
other plants in West Virginia's ``Chemical Valley.''
   ``I think this is related specifically to the fact that we
handle MIC,'' Bearer said. ``We're just going to include other
(toxic) materials.''
   Rhone-Poulenc officials met again Monday with Kanawha County
emergency workers to discuss the new plant procedures in
notification and maintenance.
   ``I think they did a genuine review and they looked at problems
they had and they addressed them,'' County Manager Ron Gregory said.
   The leak occurred when workers released a vacuum in the MIC unit
to free a stuck pipe. When the pipe was opened, a small amount of
MIC escaped.
   Under Rhone-Poulenc's new system, pressures and vacuums will be
kept on the unit so the chemical can be forced out. Also, employees
will work on only one piece of major equipment at a time.
   Estella Chandler, who has lived in Institute for 25 years and
was a co-founder of People Concerned About MIC, questioned the
honesty and intentions of Rhone-Poulenc and the two dozen other
chemical plants nearby.
   ``It's business as usual, but we will continue to protest the
presence of hazardous materials and do what we can to protect
ourselves,'' Chandler said.
   In December 1984, methyl isocyanate gas leaked from a Union
Carbide Corp. MIC unit at Bhopal and killed 3,500 people. The
Institute plant was the only sister unit to the Bhopal operation.
   Union Carbide sold that part of the plant to Rhone-Poulenc in
1986, a year after a leak of another pesticide ingredient sickened
135 people in Institute.

<HEAD>Drexel Defers Payments, Central Bank Watching, Markets Nervous</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Drexel Burnham Lambert Trading Ltd. said Wednesday
it was deferring foreign currency and precious metals payments for
one business day in the wake of the bankruptcy filing by its New
York-based parent.
   A statement issued by Drexel's London office said the move was
to ensure that its trading partners didn't call for payments which
Drexel might not be in an immediate position to meet.
   ``It is anticipated that the settlement cycle will begin again
with the payment of U.S. dollars for value Feb. 14 in New York, and
the firm intends to settle transactions for value Feb. 14 and Feb.
15 by Feb. 15,'' Drexel said.
   The move was made with the approval of the Bank of England.
   The British central bank confirmed it was aware of the
deferments and that it was watching developments in the Drexel
case. It said it was, as in all cases, primarily concerned with
monitoring capital adequacy.
   The foreign exchange, stock and metals markets were nervous
Wednesday morning, but the markets' reaction to the Drexel filing
under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Act was relatively subdued
and there was no major sell-off.
   Foreign exchange dealers said the Drexel news didn't have any
immediate impact on the dollar but the uncertainty surrounding the
firm's future and the U.S. financial scene could limit the dollar's
upside potential.
   The dollar was trading at $1.6928 against the British pound in
London late Wednesday morning, compared with $1.6907 late Tuesday.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was up 17.3
points, or 0.8 percent at 2,310.5 at 11 a.m. in London.
   London's major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $416
at midmorning Wednesday, down from $418.65 bid late Tuesday.
   ``It is obviously not good for confidence in U.S. investment as
a whole,'' said Geoffrey Dennis, senior international economist at
the London investment firm James Capel &amp; Co.
   But he added: ``There is not much risk of systemic failure
because of the Drexel bankruptcy.''
   Bob Semple, a market strategist for County Natwest Securities,
said: ``People shrugged off Drexel a bit too easily. You don't know
where the ripples will stop.''
   The head of foreign exchange at another British bank, who didn't
want to be identified, said: ``It all depends on how it develops
and whether the U.S. Fed has to help. Maybe, we haven't seen the
full effect of Drexel yet.''
   Some dealers described Drexel's trading in the currency markets
as sizeable. But the firm's position was damaged as far back as the
October 1987 stock market crash and the subsequent problems in the
junk bond market, other said, so the impact of Drexel's Wednesday
announcement was limited.
   But Drexel's decision to defer payments for one day likely will
add to the firm's problems and the whole affair could raise
questions about the credit worthiness of other U.S. investment
banks, dealers said.
   ``The flight to quality will leave (Drexel) gasping for
breath,'' said the head of foreign exchange at a British bank, who
ask not to be identified, said. ``Would you want to give them
credit after this?''
   Drexel is one of the 13 market makers in the London gold bullion
market and although it isn't certain whether the firm will pull out
at this stage the announcement likely will damage its reputation,
dealers said.
   However, other firms have pulled out as market markers in the
past so this wouldn't in itself have any impact on the gold market.

<TEXT>
   British Airways PLC on Wednesday reported
after-tax profits jumped 39 percent in its third quarter partly
because of buoyant traffic growth, lower in pension contributions
and aircraft sales that more than offset rising fuel costs.
   British Airways said its after-tax profit in the three months
ended Dec. 31 totaled $78 million, or the equivalent of 11 cents a
share, compared with $56 million, or 88 cents a share in the same
period a year ago.
   Pre-tax profit also rose 39 percent to $121 million from $87
million. This included an unspecified one-time gain from the sale
of two aircraft, the airline said.
   Sales rose 13 percent $2.02 billion from $1.8 billion.
   For the first nine months of its fiscal year, after-tax profit
rose 21 percent to $364 million, or 50 cents a share, from $301
million, or 42 cents a share in the year-ago period, British
Airways said.
   Pre-tax profit jumped 21 percent $561 million from $464 million,
while sales rose 14 percent to $6.3 billion from $5.6 billion.
   The airline said its costs rose 9 percent in the third quarter
and 14 percent in the nine months because of a 48 percent jump in
its third-quarter fuel bill.
   But passenger traffic rose 6.7 percent in the latest three
months, it said.
   Scheduled traffic remains buoyant, and capacity in the summer
season is expected to rise 20 percent, said British Airways
Chairman Lord King. Prospects for the next financial year, however,
depend on continued worldwide economic growth, he added.

<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Groupe Bruxelles Lambert SA managers
today proposed that the Belgian holding company write off its stake
in the U.S. securities firm Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   Drexel's parent company filed for protection from creditors
under U.S. bankruptcy law late Tuesday.
   In a statement, the company said its managing directors
``consider that it is prudent'' to propose to the board of
directors ``a total write-off'' of the Drexel stake.
   GBL has an effective 26-percent stake in Drexel Burnham. The
statement added that GBL had no commitment to Drexel other than the
stock holding.
   The statement said that the write-off would reduce GBL's group
profit in 1989 to about 4.1 billion francs, or $117 million, a fall
of 29 percent from 5.8 billion francs, or $166 million, in 1988.
   GBL said that without the loss of the Drexel Burnham Lambert
stake its net profit would have risen to about 7.5 billion francs,
or $214 million.
   Trading in GBL stock, which had been suspended earlier today,
resumed after the announcement was made. The stock fell to the
equivalent of $112 from Tuesday's close of $116.
   GBL is Belgium's second largest holding company. Its other main
portfolio holdings comprise large minority stakes in Petrofina SA,
a Belgian oil company, Banque Bruxelles Lambert, Belgium's second
largest commercial bank, and Royale Belge SA, Belgium's second
largest insurance company.

<HEAD>Toshiba Develops 4-Megabit SRAM</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Toshiba Corp. has developed a prototype of a
4-megabit static random access memory chip, company officials said
Wednesday.
   Toshiba said the new 4-megabit SRAM is the first to use
thin-film transistors as memory cells, a technology that reduces
power consumption.
   SRAM chips are more complex than the more common dynamic random
access memory chips, which are already available in 4-megabit
capacity. SRAM chips generally use less power than DRAMs and do not
need special ``refresh'' circuits to retain their information,
making them well-suited to battery-powered equipment like lap-top
computers.
   However, the larger number of transistors used by SRAMs make
them harder to design and manufacture than DRAMs with the same
memory capacity.
   Toshiba said the new chip has the same circuit density as
16-megabit DRAMs, which are expected to be the next generation of
memory chips.
   On Tuesday, IBM said it has begun producing 16-megabit DRAMs on
a trial basis, but said commercial production could be at least 18
months away.
   A Toshiba official said his company does not know when the
4-megabit SRAM will go into commercial production. Currently, the
largest commercially available SRAM is 1 megabit.
   A 4-megabit memory chip can store about 4 million binary units
of information, or the equivalent of about 16 newspaper pages.

   A decision by VMS Realty Partners, one of the
nation's largest real estate companies, to suspend most payments to
creditors and investors has been a long time coming, one industry
expert says.
   ``To those of us who have followed this company closely, this is
a little bit anticlimatic,'' said Barry Vinocur, editor in chief of
Stanger Publications, a division of the investment research firm
Robert A. Stanger &amp; Co.
   ``Most people expected that the day of reckoning was going to
come at VMS,'' Vinocur said. ``It was just a question of when it
would arrive.''
   Chicago-based VMS said Tuesday it had suspended
``non-essential'' payments to lenders and to its eight publicly
owned mortgage-investment funds, citing ``severe cash flow
problems.''
   ``This presents the best option for preserving the value in the
firm and all of its investors,'' said VMS President Jeffrey Park.
He declined to comment further and the company statement did not
elaborate.
   Experts said the development signals the seriousness of VMS'
financial woes and reflects the decline of highly leveraged
real-estate syndication, which provided tax-sheltered investment
opportunities until the 1986 Tax Reform Act canceled the tax breaks.
   The partnership manages assets of more than $9 billion,
including such high-profile properties as the Boca Raton Hotel and
Club in Boca Raton, Fla., the Four Seasons Biltmore in Santa
Barbara, Calif., the Grand Teton Lodge in Grand Teton National Park
and the Westin Maui hotel in Hawaii.
   Tuesday's development follows a management shakeup in November
that put Jeffrey J. Park, a former Xerox executive, in charge of
VMS. A Xerox subsidiary, Xerox Credit Corp., owns 25 percent of VMS.
   At the time of the management change, VMS announced a $110
million writeoff that analysts said reflected the softening
real-estate market, the declining popularity of real-estate
investment trusts and the folly of VMS' heavy borrowing and
interlocking business relationships among its funding operations,
real-estate ventures and service companies.
   Critics say its business practices made the entire structure
vulnerable to the financial difficulties of VMS.
   The Wall Street Journal reported Feb. 1 that from 1981 to 1989,
VMS raised $2.6 billion in equity from 110,000 outside investors in
100 real-estate limited partners and the eight publicly traded
real-estate investment trusts.
   The Journal reported that VMS had given back about $500 million
through various distributions but that the fate of the remaining
$2.1 billion was uncertain.
   Vinocur said VMS typically would use the money raised by the
funds to obtain even bigger loans for real-estate acquisition or
development.
   But the income from many VMS properties have failed to match
expectations, making it difficult to meet loan payments, analysts
said.
   Shareholders in some of VMS' trusts have filed lawsuits in U.S.
District Court in Chicago accusing VMS and its owners of fraud and
extensive conflicts of interest.
   VMS has said it will vigorously defend the charges.
   Vinocur said Tuesday's announcement may indicate that Xerox has
taken charge of the situation after replacing former VMS Chairman
Peter R. Morris with Park.
   Xerox Credit Corp. said its 25 percent equity in VMS has a book
value of $106 million.
   Xerox Credit also said its interest in VMS includes three debt
components: $136 million in subordinated notes and accrued
interest, $125 million advanced to VMS through a line of credit,
and $200 million in collateralized loans and other secured
financing arrangements.
   B. Alex Henderson, an analyst who follows Xerox for
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., said VMS does not account for a
meaningful amount of Xerox's operating profit.

   British conglomerate Hanson PLC said Wednesday its
fiscal first-quarter profit rose 12.8 percent from a year earlier
despite a 5.7 percent decline in revenue.
   Hanson said net profit in the three months ended Dec. 31 came to
the equivalent of $600 million compared with $532 million in the
same quarter in the prior year. Revenue fell to $3.1 billion from
$3.3 billion.
   Hanson said it had extraordinary income of $309 million from
asset sales, compared with $281 million a year ago.
   Earnings per share came to 6.6 cents vs. 5.95 cents.
   Hanson said it plans to sell its 70 percent interest in Mount
Goldsworthy Mining Associates in Western Australia.
   The disposal follows a series of sales by Hanson of assets from
Consolidated Gold Fields PLC, which it acquired last year for $5.6
billion.
   Lord Hanson said in the brief statement that the results were
``a good start to the year, with our financial strength further
increased.''
   Sir Gordon White, chairman of Hanson Industries Inc. said the
U.S. unit ``continues to perform well.''
   The company didn't discuss the performances of its component
parts.

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   East German Premier Hans Modrow, who
is expected to be ousted in coming elections, ended his summit in
Bonn today with promises of major West German investment but no
immediate cash to bail out his economy.
   Modrow and Chancellor Helmut Kohl also agreed to begin talks on
eventually making the West German mark the official currency of
East Germany.
   But Modrow's brief summit was overshadowed by an agreement
between the four World War II allies on eventual reunification of
the Germanys. The Germanys, France, Britain, the United States and
the Soviet Union agreed in Ottawa on Tuesday to hold talks leading
to reunification.
   The hard details on merging the Germanys politically and
economically, however, are not expected to be tackled until after
East Germany holds its first free elections on March 18.
   Bonn on Tuesday rejected Modrow's request for $9 billion to
bolster the failing East German economy until the elections, when
Modrow's government is likely to be thrown out.
   But today, West German Finance Minister Theo Waigel announced
that the government had agreed during a Cabinet meeting to add
nearly $4.2 billion to this year's budget to finance recovery
projects in East Germany.
   Those funds are earmarked for capital investments proposed
earlier and will not be made available for tiding over the East
Berlin government's day-to-day expenses, as Modrow had sought.
   The real news on Germany unity came in the Canadian capital,
where Warsaw Pact and NATO nations were meeting to discuss allowing
surveillance flights.
   Behind the scenes, the four World War II allies that divided
Germany _ the Soviets, the United States, France and Britain _ were
hammering out a method for negotiating reunification.
   The accord calls for two sets of talks, the first involving the
Germanys, during which they are to work out economic and other
domestic considerations for reunification. The announcement in Bonn
of currency talks appears to have been timed to coincide with the
Ottawa agreement.
   The second talks would involve the Germanys and the four allies
that divided the country after defeating Nazi Germany, and which
still technically occupy Berlin.
   Those talks are to deal with the critical issue of military
alliances _ East Germany is a key strategic component of the Warsaw
Pact and West Germany fills the same role for NATO.
   The Soviets want a neutral united Germany, while Washington
insists on continued NATO membership.
   The agreement is partially the result of the perceived impending
collapse of the economy in East Germany. Kohl claimed on Tuesday
that more that 85,000 East Germans have fled to the West in the
past six weeks.
   Modrow's provisional government, a conglomeration of pro-reform
Communists and former opposition figures that came to power when
mass protests toppled the hard-line government of Stalinist Erich
Honecker last year, appears doomed in the March 18 elections.
   As a result, Kohl has avoided making substantial deals with the
Modrow government until a new one is elected.
   Modrow met today with the head of the Association of German
Industry, Tyll Necker, who said neither aid nor massive Western
investment were advisable yet because East Germany's laws remain
``too restrictive.''
   Several of the East German Cabinet members who accompanied
Modrow to the talks said the delegation was disappointed with the
Bonn meetings.
   Mathias Platzek of the East German Greens Party, a minister
without portfolio in Modrow's interim coalition, told reporters
that the West German hosts dealt with them ``somewhat
schoolmasterly.''

   The stock market headed higher today, showing
few ill effects from the collapse of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 11.71 to 2,635.81
by 11 a.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 5 to 3 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 718 up, 464 down and
524 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 50.02 million shares at
midmorning.
   Stock prices turned in a mixed showing Tuesday as Drexel, which
rose to prominence in the 1980s as the champion of ``junk bond''
finance, moved to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and
liquidate.
   The firm's demise left many questions unanswered about the
outlook for the high-yield bond market and the possible effect of
pervasive debt problems on the economy as a whole.
   But analysts said the markets took the news as no great
surprise, given the much-publicized weakening that has been going
on for months in enthusiasm for junk bonds and other ``leverage''
investments.
   Some Wall Streeters believe the waning of ``junk'' debt might
set the stage for a revival of traditional financial values that
could put the stock and bond markets on a sounder long-term footing.
   Gainers among the blue chips included Chevron, up 1\ at 69|;
Philip Morris, up { at 39\; American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, up \ at

   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose

<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Great Northern Nekoosa Corp. isn't giving
up the fight against a hostile takeover bid from Georgia-Pacific
Corp., but it is ready to concede its independence.
   The Norwalk, Conn.-based paper-products company, which has been
fighting Georgia-Pacific's $3.8 billion offer for more than three
months, said Tuesday that several recent setbacks have led it to
consider a merger, although it wants a higher price than
Georgia-Pacific's $63-a-share bid.
   Georgia-Pacific went to court in Portland, Maine, this morning
to mount a challenge to some of Great Northern's latest moves.
   The company faces a showdown at a March shareholders meeting at
which Georgia-Pacific is seeking to have the company's directors
replaced with its own candidates, who would allow the merger to go
through.
   Stephen M. Hill, Great Northern's director of investor
relations, said ``it certainly was a possibility'' shareholders
would back Georgia-Pacific.
   Great Northern's directors on Tuesday postponed the shareholder
meeting to March 20 from March 2 to give shareholders time to
consider other possible offers. Great Northern also said it had
directed its financial adviser, Goldman Sachs &amp; Co., to contact
qualified buyers and seek bids higher than $63 a share.
   Georgia-Pacific spokeswoman Gail Smith, reached in Atlanta this
morning, said her company had gotten no information beyond Great
Northern's announcement Tuesday evening.
   ``Based on the information in Great Northern Nekoosa Corp.'s
press release, our view is that Great Northern's attempt to
postpone the March 2 shareholder meeting and to amend its poison
pill are unlawful and ignore the interests of shareholders,''
Georgia-Pacific said in a statement. ``We intend to seek
appropriate relief.''
   Georgia-Pacific attorneys filed papers in U.S. District Court in
Portland this morning, asking Judge Gene Carter to stop Great
Northern from delaying the March 2 meeting, Ms. Smith said. The
court clerk's office said a filing had been made by
Georgia-Pacific, but it had not yet been processed and made
available to the public by late morning.
   Georgia-Pacific has said in the past that all terms of its
tender offer were negotiable.
   Great Northern's announcement follows several setbacks in its
efforts to remain independent.
   Earlier in the week, Georgia-Pacific announced it was selling
off some of its paper operations to avoid antitrust questions that
could impede the merger. Great Northern had raised the antitrust
issues in a federal lawsuit in Connecticut that it considered its
first line of defense in the takeover battle.
   In addition, a federal judge in Maine has struck down various
provisions in Great Northern's bylaws that would have made the
takeover more difficult.
   Great Northern said the accumulation of events led its board of
directors to seek other potential buyers.
   ``The board believes that it is in the best position to conduct
an orderly, active and effective exploration of all financial
alternatives, designed to culminate in the highest possible per
share value for shareowners,'' said Great Northern chairman William
R. Laidig. ``We believe that a price of $63 per share is certainly
achievable.''
   Great Northern stock closed at $62, up 50 cents, in New York
Stock Exchange trading Tuesday. The company's announcement was made
after the market closed.
   Georgia-Pacific, an Atlanta-based forest products company,
proposed buying Great Northern last year in a move that would
create the largest company in the industry with $14 billion in
annual sales. Great Northern has fought the bid vigorously, saying
the price is too low and illegal on antitrust grounds.
   A federal judge in Bridgeport, Conn., is hearing testimony on
whether the new company would have a stranglehold on linerboard,
check paper and certain pulpwood markets, as Great Northern alleges
in its antitrust suit.
   The company also has criticized Georgia-Pacific harshly for
making the bid, saying it's trying to beef up its financial health
and operating efficiency at the expense of Great Northern
shareholders.
   ``We still felt that was the case,'' Hill said. ``But we're at a
point in time where it's appropriate to (seek other buyers) to
assure getting the best value for the shareholders.''
   Hill would not comment on possible buyers. ``It's getting into
fairly high finance, so there aren't that many players,'' he said.
   After Georgia-Pacific, the largest forest products companies are
Weyerhauser Inc. and International Paper Co., according to
testimony from Georgia-Pacific chairman T. Marshall Hahn Jr. in
Bridgeport.
   When asked what price the company was seeking, Hill said, ``The
best one possible with a qualified buyer, somebody with money to
pay.''

<HEAD>Crop Futures Down Slightly On Winter Storm, Slow Demand</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices were slightly
lower in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade,
reflecting slack demand and good prospects for significant
precipitation in the Corn Belt.
   Wheat futures dropped more than a penny a bushel at the opening,
continuing Tuesday's slide, as traders awaited news of significant
new export sales.
   Japan and Egypt were reported to have bought some U.S. wheat
overnight, but traders did not consider the amounts to be
significant.
   In the soybean market, a combination of fundamental and
technical factors kept pressure on prices.
   On the fundamental side, the European soybean market was weaker
today and a winter storm was expected to spread beneficial moisture
today and Thursday through much of the Midwest, where the majority
of soybeans are grown.
   On the technical side, the March soybean contract dipped below
Tuesday's low of $5.63{ early in the session, which analysts said
could spur further selling.
   In early trading, wheat futures were 1\ cents to 1} cents lower
with the contract for delivery in March at $3.84 a bushel; corn
futures were unchanged to { cent lower with March at $2.41\ a
bushel; oats were \ cent to 1 cent lower with March at $1.39\ a
bushel; soybeans were } cent lower to \ cent higher with March at

   Livestock and meat futures were mixed in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle futures were .05 cent lower to .05 cent higher with
February at 79.52 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent lower
to .07 cent higher with March at 82.05 cents a pound; live hogs
were .02 cent lower to .20 cent higher with February at 49.97 cents
a pound; frozen pork bellies were .20 cent lower to .48 cent higher
with February at 49.70 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled mixed on Tuesday.

<HEAD>Financial Debacles: They Happen All The Time</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The amazing thing about almost all financial
debacles is that those involved know better but allow their
negative feelings to be overcome by the lure of big profits.
   It happens regularly.
   When bankers clamped down on home mortgage loans in the 1970s
because, they said, such loans could be risky, they lent hundreds
of millions of dollars to less developed nations in order to obtain
premium interest rates from then.
   It was well known at the time that the loans were hazardous and
might not be repaid. Banker magazines warned of the practice and
even the general media carried interviews with analysts who
accurately forecast what would happen.
   Still, the chairman of one of the nation's largest banks
repeatedly scorned the warnings, suggesting the writers were
uninformed. These loans, he said, are backed by the full faith and
credit of governments; they're secure, he said.
   It happened in Texas real estate, and later in New England.
   Everybody in the building and real estate knows from experience
that their occupation is cyclical. Everyone in banking should know
that the economy as a whole is cyclical, that it expands and
contracts repeatedly.
   It didn't stop them. Builders built and lenders lent, and each
one thought they would be the exception. As if the gods were
watching over them, they gambled that they would close their deals
before the downturn began.
   The serious problem with that thinking is that the line is never
drawn, and each lender and builder tries just one more time.
   They might be forgiven for not anticipating a sudden disaster
such as a collapse of oil prices, but they certainly had to know
that in the natural cycle of events building booms come to an end,
often abruptly.
   Moreover, a boom exaggerated by excessive lending is almost
guaranteed to blow up. Nothing new in that; they've all seen it
before.
   It happened with the savings and loan associations.
   While managers of some S&amp;Ls seemed not to know what they were
doing, since deregulation of financial institutions had opened up
brand new lending (investing) opportunities for them, seasoned
managers understood very well.
   They understood risk and they understood high investment
returns. Knowing that their practices couldn't continue forever,
they nevertheless felt they could cash in on a good thing just one
more time. Soon they couldn't get out.
   Among the many problems that worsens greed is secrecy. No lender
wanted another to know that they were going to take just one more
risk, finance just one more building _ and then get out. So they
all took one more risk.
   As a result, the nation suddenly had more office space, more
industrial space, more housing than it needed, and all those
beautiful projections that looked so good on paper were seen for
what they were: Unsubstantiated hopes.
   Now we have junk bonds, or high-yield credit instruments
designed to finance the very riskiest of enterprises, such as
takeovers.
   Those who developed the idea knew the risks were great, but what
is risk, they asked, but the other side of the coin? Doesn't
everyone know that reward is in direct ratio to the risk assumed?
   Junk bonds were bought by the most highly educated and
supposedly savvy portfolio managers, those who guided the affairs
of foundations, mutual and pension funds, university endowments and
the like. The lure overcame them.
   In none of these instances was the collapse general, although it
was total in specific, individual instances. Some investors have
indeed benefited _ the reward for assuming high risk _ and in the
future others will.
   While the lure of big money is likely to produce future
financial devices of the same sort, others probably will learn a
lesson.
   Many banks, for example, are re-examining standards on home
equity loans, known less euphemistically as second mortgages. Those
loans have proliferated in recent years. An economic decline could
put some of them in foreclosure.
   One tipoff is that some bank customers are working two jobs just
to pay the interest. A warning sign.

<TEXT>
   An indicted yen trader told the FBI that
corruption was widespread at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, and
that the open outcry system was dominated by crooked brokers,
according to recently filed court documents.
   Robert H. Bailin, one of 48 people indicted in the federal probe
of the nation's largest commodities exchanges, also contended that
many traders are forced to make cash kickbacks ``to the big guys
upstairs.''
   He was referring to commodity brokers who accept customer orders
and phone them to floor brokers for execution.
   Bailin, 37, made the statements during interviews with two FBI
agents in January 1989, six months before he and 20 other Japanese
yen traders were indicted.
   But his attorney, Terence P. Gillespie, noted that Bailin has
pleaded innocent and said he plans to contest the government's
version of the interviews at trial, the Chicago Tribune reported in
today's editions.
   Transcripts of the interviews were attached to a pretrial
document recently filed by prosecutors.
   Bailin and 15 others who have pleaded innocent are scheduled to
go to trial May 21, according to a clerk for the U.S. district
judge in the case, William T. Hart.
   An exchange spokesman said the Merc would investigate Bailin's
claims.
   The transcripts indicate Bailin told the FBI that he recalled a
day in which $1 million in pork bellies futures contracts were
bought and sold outside of the Merc's trading pit.
   ``The open outcry system does not work at the Merc,'' he told
the agents, contending that the system was dominated by a small
group of powerful brokers who refused to deal with honest traders.
   He said more than a dozen undicted yen brokers forced him to
accept losses they had incurred through their own trading errors.
   During court hearings two weeks ago, Bailin and two other
indicted yen traders told U.S. District Judge William Hart that
they gave the interviews partly because agents and prosecutors had
tricked them.
   Bailin denied any wrongdoing.

<TEXT>
   Cable television mogul Bill Daniels plans to sell
nearly half of his cable brokerage firm, Daniels and Associates, to
nine of the company's executives.
   Daniels, 69, will sell 49 percent of the firm, leaving him a
majority owner with 51 percent, said senior vice president of
marketing Bob Russo on Tuesday.
   The move is part of Daniels' plan to give himself more time for
other business and philanthropic interests, Russo said.
   ``He has been putting in place a management group ... that gives
him the opportunity to focus in other areas and still remain
confident his company is going in a direction that he wants to
see,'' said Russo.
   Daniels is credited with being one of the founders of the cable
television industry and has continued to take a high-profile role
in its growth.
   Last year, Daniels and Associates brokered 100 cable and mobile
communications transactions worth $5.7 billion, and Daniels wants
to ensure it retains the preeminent financial services role, Russo
said.
   ``Daniels has always espoused the idea that it's the boss who's
beholden to the employees and not the other way around,'' said a
representative of Paul Kagan Associates, a California cable TV
analysis firm. ``It sounds like something that would be very much
in line with his corporate management policies.''
   Russo, one of the new minority partners, said the sale also
indicates a ``distinct transition to more of a management committee
direction as opposed to Bill's dynamic and very singular
leadership.''
   The deal should be completed by March, Russo said.

<HEAD>CBS Fourth-Quarter Profits Rise 48 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CBS Inc.'s fourth-quarter profit climbed 48
percent, helped by television advertising gains despite a primetime
ratings slump, the company reported Wednesday.
   For the final three months of 1989, CBS net income rose to $59.5
million or $2.31 a share, from $40.1 million or $1.56 a share in
the year-earlier period. Revenue rose 12 percent to $865.8 million
from $772.3 million.
   CBS attributed the gains largely to improved performance at the
television network, stemming from higher unit prices for
advertising.
   For the year, CBS earnings tumbled 74 percent to $296.3 million,
or $11.51 a share, from $1.15 billion, or $44.75 a share, in 1988
when company earnings were inflated by $866.6 million from the sale
of CBS Records to Sony Corp.
   Excluding the sales gains, CBS after-tax income from continuing
operations rose 5 percent in 1989 to $297.1 million, or $11.54 a
share, vs. $283.4 million, or $11.02 a share, in 1988.
   Revenue for the year totaled $2.96 billion, up 7 percent from
$2.78 billion.
   CBS President and Chief Executive Officer Laurence A. Tisch said
the gains reflected improved network television earnings ``and an
almost steady level of interest income.'' Corporate interest income
totaled $180.7 million in 1989, down 2 percent from 1988.
   ``For the year, the CBS Television Network reported higher
profits due to renewed advertising demand and continued attention
to costs, despite disappointing primetime ratings,'' Tisch said.
   CBS said it spent a substantial amount of money to buy
television and radion stations, entertainment programs and sports
rights and to retire long-term debt.
   ``At the end of 1989, the company's strong balance sheet
included cash and marketable securities of $2.8 billion which far
exceeded its total debt of $0.8 billion,'' CBS reported.

<TEXT>
   Trustees of the Poynter Institute
for Media Studies have agreed to meet Friday to further consider an
offer by a group of investors to buy the institute's Times
Publishing Co. stock.
   The investor group, which includes Texas billionaire Robert M.
Bass, owns a minority share in Times Publishing Co., publisher of
the St. Petersburg Times.
   ``The board has never expressed any interest in selling the
stock and is giving it (the offer) serious consideration as
required by its responsibilities,'' Andrew Corty, marketing
director of The St. Petersburg Times said today.
   In late January, the group offered $270 million for stock in the
Times Holding Co., which is held by the Poynter Institute and
controls a majority of the Times Publishing Co. stock.
   In a meeting Tuesday, the trustees were told by their legal
counsel it is proper for them to consider Nelson Poynter's
intentions and other factors when assessing the buyout offer.
   Nelson Poynter, former chairman of the St. Petersburg Times who
died in 1978, founded the educational institute in an effort to
keep ownership of the newspaper independent.
   The Bass partnership, in a lawsuit filed last week, charges that
its rights as a minority stockholder are being violated by the
dividend payment plan established by Poynter.
   Also Tuesday, the Bass group demanded the suit be heard by a
jury. The case has been assigned to U.S. District Judge Elizabeth
A. Kovachevich.

<HEAD>Harrods Department Store to Close Fur Salon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Citing a sharp decline in sales, Harrods is
closing its fur salon which has sold minks to the rich and famous
for nearly a century.
   The world renowned department store said Wednesday sales have
dropped by 40 percent over the last four years, but it denied
caving in to pressure from animal rights groups.
   The salon, whose concession is held by fur retailer Grosvenor
Canada, will close on April 21, following a decision 13 months ago
by Harrods' parent company, House of Fraser PLC, to end fur sales
at its other 62 stores.
   That announcement followed firebomb attacks on House of Fraser
stores, including against shops in Plymouth and Cardiff.
   According to government figures cited by Harrods, sales by
Britain's biggest fur traders totaled the equivalent of about $19
million in the first half of 1989, compared with $136 million in
all of 1984.
   Harrods said it would begin closing the salon with a sale
beginning Friday at prices slashed by up to 75 percent.
   But it will not be the last time furs are sold at Harrods,
according to spokesman Andrew Wiles.
   ``There's no doubt we will sell furs again, but not in the same
way. It will be in a smaller, more specialized way. There's a
chance we might consider selling designer furs,'' Wiles said.
   Harrods said it will retain its fur cold storage and continue to
offer its fur alteration, cleaning and valuation services.
   Lynx, an anti-fur group, said: ``In less than five years the
British public has become aware of the extreme and totally
unnecessary cruelty involved in the production of fur coats.''

<HEAD>Talks on Tropical Products Progress After Long Impasse</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   World trade negotiators agreed on a plan of action
Wednesday to liberalize trade in the $100 billion tropical products
market, ending months of stalemate.
   The agreement clears the way for a new accord to reduce import
barriers and duties on products such as nuts, coffee and spices to
be signed when the current round of General Agreement on Tariff and
Trade talks ends in December.
   Under the plan, each GATT member has to submit proposals for the
elimination or reduction of its respective tariffs and non-tariff
measures to the Geneva-based secretariat by March 15.
   Negotiators will then meet in April to discuss whether the
various proposals go far enough to meet the GATT-sponsored Uruguay
Round's objectives on the ``fullest liberalization'' of trade in
tropical products.
   When the four-year round was launched in Punte del Este in 1986,
governments agreed to pay due regard to eliminating duties on
unprocessed tropical products, to abolishing or cutting duties on
semi-processed and processed products, and eliminating or cutting
non-tariff measures such as quotas.
   As a first step toward these goals, ministers meeting in
Montreal in December 1988 agreed on a package of trading
concessions to developing countries worth some 20 billion dollars.
   However, negotiations were subsequently held up by the impasse
over an internationally-agreed approach to cutting overall tariffs.
A compromise formula was agreed last month, freeing the way for
progress in talks on tropical products.
   Trade officials were also expected to reach agreement Wednesday
on a schedule for proposals aimed at cutting non-tariff measures in
a wide range of products.
   A new accord to free trade in tropical products is regarded as
vital by Third World countries, many of whom are dependent on
export earnings from these commodities.
   Although tariffs on tropical products are generally low, they
are also selective, according to a GATT official who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
   The official cited the example of Colombia, which faces tariffs
of about 20 percent on sales of cut flowers, one of its most
important exports, to the European Community. Flowers from Israel
entering the EC, by contrast, are not subject to duties, he said.
   GATT is the main international forum for sponsoring trade
negotiations. Its 96 members account for about four-fifths of world
trade.

   A little-noted report suggests that more
Americans are working at two jobs now than at any time in decades,
perhaps since the 1940s, when there was a war-induced labor
shortage.
   The report, from the Labor Department, shows dual jobs to be a
growing trend. In 1980, 4.9 percent of employed people held two
jobs. The percentage rose to 5.4 in 1985. And in 1989, it continued
on to 6.2 percent.
   Simultaneously over the past decade, there has been a tendency
of women to put in more hours at ``official'' rather than family
jobs and for older workers to supplement pensions by working at
retail outlets.
   Marriages are occurring later than before, and there is a
similar tendency to postpone children until later in life. And to
afford a home under present conditions often if not usually
requires the bounty of two incomes.
   Still, in many areas of the country the financing and upkeep of
the home takes a larger percentage of household income than it used
to, up to 50 percent in certain instances, or double what used to
be considered affordable.
   Question: Is this really the good life that was promised? Is
this progress?
   In spite of so-called affluence, fom the Labor Department, shows dual
jobs to be a
growing trend. In 1980, 4.9 percent of employed people held two
jobs. The percentage rose to 5.4 in 1985. And in 1989, it continued
on to 6.2 percent.
   Simultaneously over the past decade, there has been a tendency
of women to put in more hours at ``official'' rather than family
jobs and for older workers to supplement pensions by working at
retail outlets.
   Marriages are occurring later than before, and there is a
similar tendency to postpone children until later in life. And to
afford a home under present conditions often if not usually
requires the bounty of two incomes.
   Still, in many areas of the country the financing and upkeep of
the home takes a larger percentage of household income than it used
to, up to 50 percent in certain instances, or double what used to
be considered affordable.
   Question: Is this really the good life that was promised? Is
this progress?
   In spite of so-called affluence, for example, debt is
increasing. And that same Labor Department survey shows that 44
percent of those working an extra job are doing so to meet
household expenses and to pay debts.
   Consider this: While more women than ever are working, well over
50 percent of them, they earn less than men and advance more
slowly. And surveys show they still haven't shed most of their
household chores.
   Questions about progress arise in other areas too. The national
debt is greater than ever. Productivity increases have slowed. For
the first time since the Great Depression of the 1930s, the
percentage of homeowners is shrinking.
   Success in the fight against proverty has slowed. Herbert Hoover
in 1928 said the country was ``nearer to the final triumph over
poverty than ever before in the history of any land.'' Today, one
in seven live in ``poverty.''
   Progress? Consider these facts, taken from a study by the U.S.
Census Bureau and the Conference Board, a private, not-for-profit
educational and research group:
   Since 1900, life expectancy has risen from under 50 years to
more than 75 years. Infant mortality has fallen from 99 per 1,000
births in 1915 to about 11 today. Average weekly hours in
manufacturing declined to 40.5 hours in 1985 from 49.4 hours in
1915, while real hourly wages rose from $2.44 to $9.53.
   Comparable net worth figures weren't available for earlier years
of the century, but in 1950 per capita net assets were $27,021,
half those of 1985. And the relative costs of food, clothing and
shelter have declined steadily.
   More houses have indoor plumbing and central heating systems.
And each year those houses seem to have more baths, swimming pools,
decks, family rooms, telephones, radios, TVs, electric toasters,
computers and smoke alarms.
   Vacation time has risen. Leisure has become a big business, and
activities that once were the exclusive preserve of the elite, such
as golf, tennis, sailing and skiing, are growth industries.
   ``More money, more leisure and the pursuit of fun and travel
have enormously enriched the way we live,'' says the report.
   What do you think?

   Stocks finished slightly higher after a lackluster
session on London's Stock Exchange Wednesday, as investors found
little reason to buy.
   Dealers said the market appeared to be treading water, in
anticipation of a barrage of British economic data and corporate
earnings reports due to be released later in the week.
   Tuesday's news that Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc. filed for
protection under U.S. bankruptcy law still overshadowed the market,
dealers said.
   ``Any rise in the market will be short-lived,'' said the head of
equities at a London firm. ``There's far too much concern on (the
prospect for higher) interest rates and the possibility that New
York will fall out of bed, sooner or later, over this Drexel
thing.''
   Although Wall Street got off to a healthy start, London traders
said there wasn't any discernible leadership coming from New York.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index was up 5.1
points, or 0.2 percent, at 2,298.3.
   The Financial Times 30-share index was up 4.3 points at 1,822.4.
The Financial Times 500-share index rose 2.67 points to close at
1,253.05.
   Volume amounted to a modest 465.2 million shares, compared with
436.4 million shares Tuesday.

   They used to call it near beer. It had a small
market _ pimply kids looking for a way to emulate grownups.
   It's become big business.
   No-alcohol beer, it is called, thank you. The world's top two
brewers, in an insatiable quest for customers, are leading the
charge.
   Anheuser-Busch Inc. has rolled out O'Doul's Non-Alcoholic Brew
and Miller Brewing Co. has launched Sharp's to stimulate a
long-ignored segment of the market. The brews _ legally, the
companies cannot refer to them as beer _ have less than a
half-percent alcohol content.
   Will this stuff sell?
   One beer industry analyst, Bob Weinberg of R.S. Weinberg &amp;
Associates in St. Louis, said he was skeptical, partly because
no-alcohol brew tastes, in his words, ``God-awful.''
   Weinberg said the industry's Big Two were trying to position
no-alcohol brew as a new adult soft drink, but they will have to
displace Diet Coke and Diet Pepsi, already well-entrenched _ not to
mention better-tasting and less-filling.
   ``This trend, it makes no sense to me,'' Weinberg said. ``I am
baffled, in all honesty. I can't see it.''
   Drinking opponents also expressed doubts about no-alcohol beer.
They said a concoction that resembles beer won't necessarily
dissuade young people from chugging the real thing.
   Hamilton Beazley, president of the National Council on
Alcoholism and Drug Dependence in New York, said no-alcohol beer
was likely to confuse alcoholics and could even make children more
apt to drink.
   ``I don't see a happy image on Super Bowl day of a 6- or
7-year-old kid drinking a can of no-alcohol beer while his dad
drinks the high-test stuff,'' Beazley said.
   ``Beer is not just a beverage. This is kind of like candy
cigarettes. It's a poor model for kids.''
   No-alcohol brew sales haven't been impressive since
Anheuser-Busch and Miller got serious about peddling it in recent
months.
   While Anheuser-Busch sold nearly 81 million barrels of beer last
year, capturing 42 percent of the market, for example, the number
of barrels of no-alcohol beer sold industry-wide was between
700,000 and 1.1 million.
   Primary markets are Moslem countries where alcohol drinking is
banned, and the United States.
   Nonetheless, company officials claim both O'Doul's and Sharp's
are off to fast starts.
   Bob Merz, group manager for O'Doul's, contended that
health-conscious adults, a growing segment of the market, were more
apt to reach for a no-alcohol beer than a soft drink or juice in
certain circumstances.
   For instance, Merz said, no-alcohol beer could be the
appropriate beverage for the designated driver at a party.
   Nonetheless, no-alcohol beer seems to be the most risky venture
of all the diversification taking place, especially at
Anheuser-Busch.
   The world's leading brewer has gone from Budweiser to Busch to
Michelob to light beer to dry beer and several concoctions in
between. Counting O'Doul's, its beer stable is now 17 brands strong.
   That includes a reduced-alcohol beer, called L.A., which has had
limited success, selling about 100,000 barrels in 1988. But it was
still beer, watered down or not.
   In the case of O'Doul's, will taste be enough? One of beer's
plusses, after all, is its kick.
   Perception may also pose a problem.
   None of a group of six drinkers informally polled by the AP
liked the taste of O'Doul's when they knew what they were drinking.
One said the brew resembled mildly flavored water and another said
it was like beer frozen and then thawed.
   But only two of the six could identify O'Doul's in a blind taste
test with two other brands.
   Both breweries are betting heavily that its projected audience _
the premium beer drinker, primarily male, age 35 and older _ is
ready for a no-alcohol beverage. Industry insiders estimate the
Anheuser-Busch and Miller have spent more than $10 million each
developing non-alcohol products.
   Similar to Diet Coke, the advertising campaign for O'Doul's
stresses that ``the taste will win you over.''
   The long-time no-alcohol leader, Kingsbury, a product of G.
Heileman Brewing Co., definitely has noticed.
   ``Everything we've seen and heard is that Miller and
Anheuser-Busch are going to be spending very heavily,'' said David
Shield, a brand manager for Heileman. ``We've got some things up
our sleeves too. We're planning on increasing our activity.''
   Though it debuted nationally only two months ago, O'Doul's
really has been around for several years.
   Anheuser-Busch began developing a no-alcohol product in the
early 1980s, introducing an incarnation known as LA-X in Savannah,
Ga., in 1986. In March of 1989, O'Doul's was released in six
southeastern markets.
   Merz said the taste resembles that of Busch, without the
alcohol. Like the brewery's other brands, O'Doul's goes through the
same steps _ brewing, aging, fermentation _ before a final
cold-filtering step removes the alcohol.
   Merz said current technology eliminates the heavy, syrupy taste
once associated with no-alcohol beers.
   The brewing process used for Sharp's is a secret at Miller.
Generally, the company brews Sharps at a lower temperature,
minimizing the development of alcohol, said Tony Sciolla, an
associate brand manager.
   Some beverage industry analysts suggest that no-alcohol beer is
the logical next-step in a constantly changing industry. Since
Milwaukee-based Miller introduced the wildly successful Miller Lite
in 1973, the beer market has exploded with new choices.
   There are four varieties of Michelob alone, and almost every
beer has light and dry companions.
   Weinberg said 80 percent of Miller's business last year came
from beers that did not exist in 1973. Sixty-three percent of
Coors' business came from new product lines.
   Anheuser-Busch, alone from the rest, is decidedly old-line, with
only 20 percent of sales coming from new products. Budweiser, Busch
and Michelob continue to carry the weight.
   With that power base, industry analysts say, Anheuser-Busch can
afford to take a few chances. The same is true for Miller, No. 2 in
sales.
   ``We wouldn't have gotten involved with no-alcohol beer if we
didn't think the opportunity was there,'' said Miller's Sciolla.

   The stock market pieced together a small gain
today, showing few ill effects from the collapse of Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 1.35 to 2,625.45 by
2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 8 to 7 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 739 up, 649 down and
491 unchanged.
   Stock prices turned in a mixed showing Tuesday as Drexel, which
rose to prominence in the 1980s as the champion of ``junk bond''
finance, moved to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and
liquidate.
   The firm's demise left many questions unanswered about the
outlook for the high-yield bond market and the possible effect of
pervasive debt problems on the economy as a whole.
   But analysts said the markets took the news as no great
surprise, given the much-publicized weakening that has been going
on for months in enthusiasm for junk bonds and other ``leverage''
investments.
   Some Wall Streeters believe the waning of ``junk'' debt might
set the stage for a revival of traditional financial values that
could put the stock and bond markets on a sounder long-term footing.
   Gainers among the blue chips included Chevron, up 1&lsqb; at 69{;
Philip Morris, up &rsqb; at 39&lsqb;; General Electric, up &lsqb; at 62\, and
International Business Machines, up | at 103~.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.39 to 183.24. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .15 at 358.60.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 99.30 million shares with two

<HEAD>Perrier Pulled From Shelves Worldwide; Dirty Filter Blamed</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with company saying the benzene was
naturally occurring but was not screened out due to dirty filter.
No pickup.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The president of Perrier announced today that the
company will withdraw its mineral water from worldwide distribution
because small amounts of a naturally occurring toxic gas passed
through a dirty filter and contaminated some bottles.
   Gustave Leven told a news conference the company took the step
because ``half measures were not possible.''
   Traces of benzene have been found in samples of the water in the
United States, Canada, the Netherlands and Denmark in recent days.
   But only part of the production will be withdrawn from the
French market after a preliminary ruling by the Health Ministry
that it poses no danger to the public, Leven said.
   The recall will affect 120 additional countries that consume the
popular green-bottled water, Perrier officials said, estimating it
could cost the company about $35 million.
   News of the problem caused the company's stock to close today at
$248, down $49 from its closing price Friday.
   Today's announcement by Perrier's president came days after 72
million bottles of Perrier were withdrawn from the U.S. market
after benzene was detected there.
   Benzene, a chemical used in cleaning solvents, entered the water
in trace amounts when workers failed to change a pipe filter at
Perrier's natural spring at Vergeze in southern France.
   The water and the natural carbon dioxide gas that makes it
bubbly are normally separated underground, then carried up separate
pipes to the bottling plant, Perrier Managing Director Frederik
Zimmer said.
   A filter on the gas pipe that removes benzene and other
impurities had not been changed in ``several months,'' Zimmer said,
malfunctioning and allowing naturally-occuring benzene to seep
through.
   ``We don't know exactly how long the filter had been there,
that's the problem,'' said Zimmer. ``It was complete negligence.''
   Zimmer ruled out industrial espionage and said disciplinary
action had been taken against the workers involved.
   In the Netherlands, more than a million bottles were recalled, a
spokesman for the Dutch importer said earlier today.
   ``Small traces of the stuff, to the extent of about 10 parts per
billion, have been found in several samples,'' that have been
tested here in recent days, said Herman Schieffers, managing
director of Hero Nederland BV.
   In Denmark, traces of benzene, were found Tuesday in several
Perrier bottles, prompting the importer, Peter Heering, and the
distributer, Albani Breweries, to withdraw up to 300,000 bottles,
Heering said. ``It was a very, very small portion (of benzene) that
was found and there is no danger,'' Heering said today.
   A Japanese subsidiary said Tuesday that it would withdraw the
water from stores because of the contamination found in the United
States.
   Before today, Perrier had said it believed an employee
mistakenly used a product containing the cancer-causing chemical to
clean grease from one bottling line, whose production was destined
only for North America.

<HEAD>Experts: Financial Industry Restructuring To Spark Conservatism</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The financial services industry, which reshaped
corporate America in the 1980s with high-risk, junk bond financing,
is undergoing a restructuring that will lead to more conservative
lending policies, experts said at a Conference Board gathering
Wednesday.
   Separately, economists participating in the group's two-day
conference on the financial outlook for 1990 generally predicted
the U.S. economy would avoid a recession this year, although
inflation would rise.
   The financial difficulties of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., whose
parent filed for bankruptcy court protection on Tuesday,
illustrated the problems facing the entire industry.
   Drexel pioneered the use of high-risk, high-interest junk bonds
for a range of corporate financing, spurring the wave of mergers
and buyouts that reshaped corporate American in the 1980s. But the
firm ran into financial trouble when that market stumbled.
   Senior Conference Board economist Vincent G. Massaro said that
in 1981 roughly 7 percent of total corporate debt was rated
``speculative'' by Moody's Investors Service Inc., the rating
agency. Last month, the figure was 20 percent, he said.
   The percentage of companies' sales that goes toward debt
payments has risen to the point where it has eroded competition
within some sectors of corporate America, said Moody's President
John A. Bohn Jr.
   He predicted the issuance of ``speculative-grade'' bonds,
otherwise known as junk bonds, would plunge by at least 50 percent
this year and that attitudes would shift toward financial
conservatism.
   ``(Leveraged buyout) and takeover activity as a driving force
will fade,'' Bohn said.
   In another area, experts agreed the United States would escape a
recession this year, but said challenges on both domestic and
international fronts will test the economy's ability to sustain its
record-setting expansion.
   Thhe United States will face challenges from several directions.
According to Bohn, U.S.-Japan relations will be put to the test in
the coming years, and banks will be pressed to resume lending to
less developed countries to get their economies going. And in
Eastern Europe, ``the stage is set for a new range of East-West
trade and financial incentives,'' he noted.
   How the United States will fare with these long-term challenges
is unclear. Economic growth will continue at roughly a 2.5 percent
pace this year, Massaro said, but inflation will rise to between 5
percent and 6 percent.
   ``I see the U.S. economy in a late phase of the cycle _ a time
when prudent decision-makers will guard their flanks,'' Massaro
said.
   The Conference Board is a non-profit network of companies, trade
and professional organizations, government agencies and labor
unions.

   The U.S. dollar weakened against other major
currencies except the Canadian dollar in European trading Wednesday.
   Gold prices moved lower.
   Foreign exchange dealers said there was little direction in the
currency markets, reflecting uncertainty about political and
economic developments.
   They cited the apparent drawing together of East and West
Germany, the difficulties of the American investment company Drexel
Burnham Lambert and Japan's forthcoming general election.
   Late dollar rates compared with late Tuesday's quotes included:
1.6715 West German marks, down from 1.6760; 1.4920 Swiss francs,
down from 1.4960; 5.6845 French francs, down from 5.6995; 1.8832
Dutch guilders, down from 1.8980; 1,242.25 Italian lire, down from
1,248.00; and 1.2062 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1995.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.6963 late Wednesday,
compared to Tuesday's late rate of $1.6907.
   Earlier, in Tokyo, the dollar closed at 144.35 Japanese yen,
down from 144.48. In London late Wednesday the dollar traded lower,
at 144.25 yen.
   Gold bullion dealers said there was anxiety about the possible
effects on the market of the bankruptcy filing on Tuesday by Drexel
Burnham Lambert, which has been a major participant in trading of
precious metals and other commodities.
   The late London bid for gold was $416.25 a troy ounce, down from
$418.65. The late gold bid price in Zurich was $415.52 an ounce,
down from $419.75.
   Gold closed earlier in Hong Kong at $417.25, down from $421.25.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at a bid $5.32 a troy
ounce, down from $5.35.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly
higher Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade, paced by a late
surge in the soybean and soybean oil markets.
   Analysts said soyoil futures led the advance, with support
stemming from new export sales of U.S. soy oil to Pakistan and
several African nations. Soybean oil for delivery in March closed
up 29 cents at $19.95 per hundredweight.
   Joel Karlin, an analyst with Research Department Inc., a
Chicago-based brokers advisory service, said a government report
last week indicating soy oil stocks are declining has made the
market more sensitive to supply-and-demand signals.
   Wheat futures were mixed, with contracts for near-term delivery
up amid expectations that China will tender soon for some of the 1
million metric tons of subsidized U.S. wheat offered to it last
week by the Agriculture Department.
   A winter storm moving out of the Central Plains into the Midwest
pressured deferred wheat contracts and helped limit gains in the
soybean and corn markets due to the potential for beneficial
precipitation in crop-producing areas.
   At the close, wheat futures were 2 cents lower to 1} cents
higher with the contract for delivery in March at $3.87\ a bushel;
corn futures were 1 cent to 1} cents higher with March at $2.43 a
bushel; oats were } cent to 1{ cents higher with March at $1.41 a
bushel; soybeans were 1 cent to 3{ cents higher with March at
$5.66} a bushel.

   The junk bond market gained further ground
Wednesday following the bankruptcy filing of junk pioneer Drexel
Burnham Lambert Inc., which began peddling its inventory of
high-yield, high-risk issues to a handful of prospective buyers.
   A spokesman for First Boston Corp. confirmed that
representatives took a look at the Drexel junk bond portfolio, but
he declined to characterize their interest in it.
   Also said to be picking through the inventory were Salomon
Brothers Inc., Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. and Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.
Spokespeople at these firms had no immediate comment. Some traders
also said General Electric Credit Corp. was rumored to have
reviewed Drexel's junk holdings.
   Drexel, whose parent filed for federal bankruptcy court
protection on Tuesday, is in the process of liquidating its
government bond holdings.
   There has been fear among some market participants that a
selloff of Drexel's huge junk bond portfolio would put downward
pressure on a market that already has been battered by defaults
among several major junk-financed companies in recent months.
   In the junk bond market on Wednesday, gains continued to be
centered on high-quality, ``go-go'' issues such as Colt Industries,
Safeway, and Duracell, whose prospects for paying off their junk
debt are considered relatively less risky.
   After rising as much as $20 per $1,000 in face value in Tuesday
bargain-hunting, the better issues gained another $5 to $15 per
$1,000 late Wednesday as investors sought to pick up quality debt
at low prices.
   ``People do realize that not all the companies are dogs, and
that some high-coupon debt does have value,'' said Elizabeth
Reiners, a vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   Drexel almost single-handedly turned the market for high-risk,
high-interest corporate bonds into a booming business during the
1980s, when the securities were widely used for financing corporate
mergers and takeovers.
   Although its share of the market has shrunk in recent years,
Drexel still is the dominant junk bond underwriter. Over the years,
the firm underwrote billions of dollars worth of the bonds, some of
which remain in its own private portfolio.
   Drexel spokesman Steve Anreder, while not directly confirming
that the junk bond portfolio is up for sale, said the Wall Street
firms ``may have been'' invited to review it. Such a move is not
surprising, Anreder said, as Drexel is looking at any options to
maximize the value of its holdings.
   Drexel never has publicly placed a value on its junk holdings,
but market speculation has put the price tag as high as $1 billion.
Exactly which issues are included in the portfolio also is unknown.
   ``People can make some serious, educated guesses about what they
own, but nobody knows for sure unless they've seen the inventory,''
said one junk bond manager, who asked not to be named.
   ``All the issues Drexel has brought to market would be on it,''
speculated John Moran, a trader at Advest Inc.
   Traders said it is less important how and to whom Drexel sells
its portfolio than how quickly it can unload the issues.
   ``Selling it as one piece may be better to get the uncertainty
out of the market,'' said one trader who asked not to be identified.

   The stock market eked out a small gain today,
showing few ill effects from the collapse of Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc.
   Stock prices turned in a mixed showing Tuesday as Drexel, which
rose to prominence in the 1980s as the champion of ``junk bond''
finance, moved to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and
liquidate.
   The firm's demise left many questions unanswered about the
outlook for the high-yield bond market and the possible effect of
pervasive debt problems on the economy as a whole.
   But analysts said the markets took the news as no great
surprise, given the much-publicized weakening that has been going
on for months in enthusiasm for junk bonds and other ``leverage''
investments.
   Some Wall Streeters believe the waning of ``junk'' debt might
set the stage for a revival of traditional financial values that
could put the stock and bond markets on a sounder long-term footing.

   Great Northern Nekoosa Corp. has begun
looking for a friendly buyer and hostile suitor Georgia-Pacific
Corp. went to federal court Wednesday to make sure it gets in on
the auction.
   Great Northern said its financial adviser, Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co.,
had begun soliciting buyers who might be interested in paying more
than the $63 per share offered by hostile bidder Georgia-Pacific.
   Late Tuesday, Great Northern Chairman William R. Laidig issued a
statement throwing the company open for bids, saying that
Georgia-Pacific's $3.8 billion takeover attempt apparently
prevented Great Northern from continuing its long-term plans to
remain independent.
   Great Northern stock rose $2 to $64 a share on the New York
Stock Exchange. Georgia-Pacific fell 37{ cents to $44.50 a share.
   Great Northern spokesman Stephen M. Hill declined to say which
potential buyers had been contacted or how many there were.
   Sherman Chao, an analyst with the New York investment firm
Salomon Brothers, speculated that the only other domestic paper
companies capable of bidding were Weyerhaeuser Co., based in
Tacoma, Wash., and International Paper Co., based in Purchase, N.Y.
   A spokesman for Weyerhaeuser had no comment on the Great
Northern situation. A spokesman for International Paper said his
company had expressed no past interest in buying Great Northern and
he did not believe it has any interest now, although there would be
no comment if any merger discussions were held.
   Separately Wednesday, Georgia-Pacific asked a federal judge to
block Great Northern's postponement of a shareholder meeting, at
which stockholders were to vote on whether to oust the Great
Northern board of directors in favor of candidates nominated by
Georgia-Pacific.
   On Tuesday night, Great Northern had announced it was postponing
until March 20 the previously scheduled March 2 meeting.
   Great Northern also said it had amended its bylaws so that in
the event Georgia-Pacific's candidates ended up controlling the
board, they still would be forced to use Great Northern's ``poison
pill'' defense against hostile takeovers.
   Georgia-Pacific filed papers in U.S. District Court seeking to
restore the March 2 meeting date and asking U.S. District Judge
Gene Carter to supervise the auction for Great Northern.
   ``There can be no doubt that GNN's attempt to restrict the power
of future directors is in blatant violation of Maine statutes, and
well-established principles of corporate law,'' Georgia-Pacific
stated.
   Chao said Great Northern's attempts to resist Georgia-Pacific
apparently were defeated last week when the federal judge ruled
that the board could be ousted by just a two-thirds vote of Great
Northern shareholders. Great Northern's bylaws had called for a
three-fourths vote, but Carter said that provision violated Maine
corporate law.
   ``A proxy fight was clearly a losing proposition for Great
Northern,'' Chao said. Great Northern's executives decided to seek
a buyer once ``it looked like they were going to be out of office
soon anyway,'' Chao said.
   Hill said he did not know whether Goldman, Sachs would be
seeking higher bids from Georgia-Pacific, but Georgia-Pacific's
court filing accused Great Northern of planning to keep it out of
the bidding.

<HEAD>EC Opposes Air France's Takeover of UTA</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STRASBOURG, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Commission decided
Wednesday to oppose Air France's purchase of a controlling interest
in Union de Transports Aeriens, a privately held French airline.
   The commission found that state-owned Air France's acquisition
violates competition rules of the European Economic Community, a
commission spokesman said.
   The spokesman, who declined to be identified by name, said the
commission plans to send a formal statement of objection to Air
France and the French government. He said the letter would open the
way for discussions on what actions need to be taken to eliminate
the commission's objections.
   EEC officials say Air France could be forced to shed some of the
routes it acquired through its UTA purchase.
   Air France's purchase values UTA, France's biggest private
airline, at almost 7 billion francs, or around $1.2 billion. On
Jan. 17, Air France paid 3.8 billion francs for a 54.6 percent
stake in UTA.
   Air France bought the UTA stake from Chargeurs SA, a holding
company with transportation and textile interests. Chargeurs had
controlled 82.9 percent of UTA's capital.
   Air France and UTA officials were unavailable for comment
Wednesday.
   The spokesman said the commission's decision was based on Air
France's position as the dominant force in its market. Article 86
of the EEC's founding Treaty of Rome prohibits abuse of a dominant
market position by any company when it affects commerce within the
12-nation trading bloc.
   The acquisition gives Air France control of 97 percent of air
routes within France all of the international routes allocated to
French airlines. The purchase also raised Air France's stake in Air
Inter, a domestic French airline, because UTA owned a majority of
it.
   UTA has a small fleet of 19 jets, six of which are owned by its
charter subsidiary Aeromaritime. UTA operates on long-haul routes,
mainly to the Pacific and Africa.
   Chargeurs Chairman Jerome Seydoux had said on several occasions
that he would sell UTA if the French government did not authorize
it to operate on European and transatlantic routes.

   A late rally boosted crude oil futures prices
Wednesday but gasoline futures sagged after an industry report
showed inventories rose sharply last week.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the March contract for
unleaded gasoline fell 0.53 cent to 59.89 cents a gallon after
advancing 0.86 cent in the previous two sessions. Other contracts
closed mixed.
   The March contract for West Texas Intermediate, the main U.S.
grade of crude oil, jumped 17 cents to $22.07 a barrel. Later
contracts also posted gains.
   Heating oil for March delivery, meanwhile, advanced 0.79 cent to
57.64 cents a gallon, while other contracts also rose.
   Analysts said the American Petroleum Institute report on weekly
inventories helped depress gasoline prices.
   ``The report showed double what was estimated,'' said Bob Baker,
an energy analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   The API said gasoline stocks rose 7.5 million barrels to 238.9
million barrels in the week ended Feb. 9.
   Heating oil inventories were up 870,000 barrels to 121.9 million
barrels while crude oil stocks fell 1.9 million barrels, the API
said in its report released after the close of trading Tuesday.
   Analysts said concern about the future of Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc., a major operator in futures trading, remained in the market
after the parent of the large securities broker filed for Chapter
11 bankruptcy protection Tuesday.
   Drexel was said to be adjusting its positions in the energy
market, assessing its obligations to other companies and
determining how to meet them.

   The stock market edged upward in a drifting
session Wednesday, showing few ill effects from the collapse of
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose .22 to 2,624.32.
   Advancing issues slightly outnumbered declines in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 749 up, 681
down and 519 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 138.53 million
shares, against 144.44 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 168.96 million shares.

   Police in riot gear erected barriers as
soon-to-be-jobless Drexel Burnham Lambert workers left their
headquarters for lunch Wednesday, a short stroll from the New York
Stock Exchange.
   Blue sawhorses blocked the sidewalk _ not to keep the curious
from what once was Wall Street's highest-flying firm, but because
Vice President Dan Quayle happened to be touring a job-training
center next to the Drexel building.
   ``What's Quayle doing, coming to rescue Drexel?'' shouted one
employee of the firm, whose collapse into Chapter 11 bankruptcy
proceedings will put most of Drexel's 5,300 workers out of work.
   He and other workers said Drexel management gave no indication
of the severity of the firm's troubles, and most of the staff was
stunned Tuesday when Drexel announced it would liquidate most
assets and quit business.
   ``I guess you could tell the story of numbness,'' said a Drexel
``junk-bond'' professional, who asked not to be identified because
he still does not know how many more weeks his job will last.
   ``It wasn't gradual in terms of layoffs, and then management
telling employees to prepare for a bleak future, anything like
that. It just suddenly happened.''
   Drexel's collapse will dump thousands of job-seekers into an
already depressed securities business, and while the best will
quickly find work, many others won't.
   ``Hey, there was a lot of talent there, and top talent will
always find a home on the Street,'' said Wolfgang Demisch, the head
of research at UBS Securities Inc. in New York and a potential
hirer of Drexel analysts.
   ``But the broader message is that the Street is shrinking,''
Demisch said. He likened the plight of Drexel employees to the
difficulties aerospace workers would face if a large company
suddenly closed in today's climate of defense cuts.
   Many Drexel managers began to job-hunt quietly in December after
learning their bonuses would be paid in stock rather than cash,
said executive ``headhunter'' Stephanie Katris.
   Ms. Katris is an assistant vice president at Henner Associates
in Chicago, a four-person company specializing in executive
searches for the capital markets industry.
   Since December, Henner had received a few calls a week from
high-level Drexel workers seeking sales or corporate finance work,
she said. That trickle turned to a flood this week.
   ``There's been 30 calls in the past two days,'' she said
Wednesday. ``They say, `I'll do anything.' They're ready to get
into banking, or work for smaller specialty brokerages.''
   One big question for prospective employers will be whether
workers succeeded at Drexel because of their efforts or because of
the company's hammerlock on high-yield bond financing.
   ``There was a time when a salesman from Drexel could pick up the
phone and sell pretty much anything based on the reputation of the
firm and their ability to provide liquidity,'' Ms. Katris said.
   Gary Goldstein, president of The Whitney Group, an executive
search firm in New York, said his office has been getting up to 30
calls an hour, most from Drexel people, compared with less than 20
on a normal day.
   ``People are still feeling the emotional shock of it,''
Goldstein said. ``Like, `God, a week ago I signed two engagement
letters _ business as usual.' All of a sudden they're getting their
last paychecks.''
   A continent away in Beverly Hills, Calif., where Michael Milken
built a Drexel empire based on the high-risk, high-yield junk
bonds, Valentine's Day business slumped at Gump's, the luxury gift
store beneath Drexel's offices at the foot of California's premiere
shopping street, Rodeo Drive.
   ``Normally they buy a lot,'' said a Gump's employee. ``But I
haven't seen anything of them this year.''
   The Drexel junk-bond worker said some employees were spending
nearly all their time looking for work, while others tried to hold
back huge waves of calls from clients trying to close accounts.
   Outside the corporate offices on Broad Street, the employee who
joked about the vice president's visit said workers were shocked by
the suddenness of the news, but were still able to trade dark
asides.
   ``They're renaming the company `Nightmare on Broad Street,' _
starring Freddy Krueger Joseph,'' he said _ a dual reference to the
burn-scarred ``Nightmare on Elm Street'' slasher and Drexel Chief
Executive Frederick Joseph.
   ``My dad called me from California last night and said, `Son,
your bedroom is still here.'''

   The dollar weakened slightly against most major
currencies in uneventful trading Wednesday.
   Gold prices fell marginally. On the New York Commodity Exchange,
gold bullion for current delivery settled at $416.70 a troy ounce,
down 90 cents from late Tuesday. Republic National Bank in New York
quoted a late bid for gold also at $416.70 an ounce, off 80 cents.
   Traders said there was little direction in the currency markets,
reflecting uncertainty about political and economic developments
such as the potential reunification of East and West Germany,
President Bush's trip to Colombia and Japan's upcoming general
election.
   ``We're just at a standstill,'' said Ronald Holzer, chief dealer
at Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago. ``The financial
markets are very calm ... and are waiting to resume normal
activities as soon as we get some economic news later this week.''
   Holzer was referring to the government's scheduled release
Friday of merchandise trade figures for December and industrial
production during January.
   In addition, traders continued to monitor the difficulties
surrounding junk bond pioneer Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., whose
parent sought bankruptcy court protection from creditors Tuesday.
Drexel has begun what appeared to be an orderly liquidation of some
of its financial portfolios.
   ``The market is still sorting out the news about Drexel,''
Holzer said.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 144.35 Japanese yen, down from
144.48 Tuesday. Later, in London, the dollar finished still lower,
at 144.25 yen. In New York, the dollar closed at 144.35 yen,
unchanged from Tuesday.
   In London, one British pound cost $1.6963 late Wednesday, up
from Tuesday's late rate of $1.6907. In New York it cost $1.6960 to
buy one British pound, more expensive than $1.6895 Tuesday.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday,
included: 1.6750 West German marks, down from 1.6763; 1.4940 Swiss
francs, down from 1.4975; 5.6965 French francs, down from 5.7015;
1,244.75 Italian lire, down from 1,245.75, and 1.2075 Canadian
dollars, up from 1.2010.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday's
rates, included: 1.6715 West German marks, down from 1.6760; 1.4920
Swiss francs, down from 1.4960; 5.6845 French francs, down from
5.6995; 1.8832 Dutch guilders, down from 1.8980; 1,242.25 Italian
lire, down from 1,248.00; and 1.2062 Canadian dollars, up from
1.1995.
   Gold bullion dealers said there was anxiety about the possible
effects on the market of the bankruptcy filing by Drexel, which has
been a major participant in trading of precious metals and other

<HEAD>Deals Still Out There, But Drexel Filing Takes a Toll</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The collapse of Drexel Burnham Lambert maybe
another blow to an already teetering market for junk bond financed
takeovers, but dealmakers are showing they still have plenty of
ways to do business.
   Georgia-Pacific Corp. is undertaking a $3.8 billion hostile bid
for rival paper manufacturer Great Northern Nekoosa Inc. and the
management of Chrysler's Gulfstream Aerospace subsidiary is buying
the division for $825 million.
   The bidders for those companies have gone back to some older,
more conservative financing methods _ as other corporate borrowers
that once relied on the junk market may now be forced to do.
   The takeover business slowed to a crawl when junk bond money
dried up last fall after serious problems emerged at a number of
companies heavily financed with the high-interest debt.
   The bankruptcy court filing late Tuesday by the parent of Drexel
_ whose fortunes rose and fell with the market for the high-yield
debt securities that it pioneered _ was another devastating blow to
junk bond financing, once the premier route for backing a buyout.
   Georgia-Pacific has lined up financing from a syndicate of banks
at an interest rate of 1 percent above the prime rate, which
currently stands at 10 percent. That compares with the 16 percent
levels commonly attached to junk bonds.
   Being able to do the deal without junk bonds was one of its
selling points, said A.D. ``Pete'' Correll, Georgia-Pacific's
executive vice president in charge of pulp and paper.
   Gulfstream, meanwhile, is being bought with bank financing and a
combination of equity and debt financing provided by the division's
chairman, Alan Paulson and the investment firm Forstmann Little &amp;
Co.
   Paulson said he never considered using junk bonds.
   Junk bonds began falling seriously out of favor in September,
when Campeau Corp.'s $6.7 billion purchase of Federated Department
Stores Inc. _ which depended heavily on the risky securities _
began to unravel. A number of new junk bond financings were put on
hold.
   The junk bond market has taken a series of hits since then, and
Drexel, whose biggest business was selling the securities, suffered
heavy losses that contributed to the firm's Chapter 11 filing.
   ``Already dim prospects for takeover entrepreneurs to raise
large amounts of money using high-yield bonds is further dimmed ...
This is another significant negative,'' said Gregg A. Jarrell, a
finance professor at the University of Rochester's William E. Simon
School of Business.
   Morris Mendelson, a professor of finance at the University of
Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business, said Drexel's downfall
``won't kill the junk bond market, but I suspect that some firms
that might have been able to raise money in the junk bond market
while Drexel was alive won't be able to now.''
   Bernard Black, a Columbia University School of Law professor,
said the junk bond market would shrink. Drexel's problems mean ``a
possible source of liquidity is no longer there.'' he said,
``There's no market maker for recently issued debt.''
   Junk bonds are best known for backing big takeovers, but they
also have been used extensively by smaller companies. Some of these
firms resorted to high-yield debt because they could not obtain
other financing and may face trouble if they need loans in the
future.
   ``They may be slower in their growth,'' said Allen Michel, a
professor at the Boston University School of Management. ``They
will not be able to expand at the same rate, they'll have to pull
in their horns.''
   Mendelson painted a darker picture: ``You may have more firms
going belly-up that wouldn't have had to go belly-up before.''
   Investors pursuing buyouts are finding that the failure of junk
bonds has created problems besides forcing them to look for other
means of financing. Trying to get bank financing means meeting a
newly toughened set of qualifications.
   In junk bond financing, hundreds of individual investors might
be putting up $1 million _ for many of them a relatively small
amount _ but a bank syndicate has a smaller number of participants
who have much more at stake and therefore more stringent standards,
said Jerome E. Hass, a professor of managerial economics and
finance at Cornell University's Johnson Graduate School of
Management.
   ``What they want is a business that has a cash flow capacity to
service the debt,'' Hass said of lenders.
   Georgia-Pacific said it expects to have a debt load of $7.5
billion if it succeeds in its bid for Great Northern. Securities
analysts who track the company say that the suitor and its target
have strong cash flows and say Georgia-Pacific will be able to pay
down its debt.
   Lawrence Ross, an analyst with PaineWebber Inc., said banks also
were willing to back Georgia-Pacific because it ``is tremendously
strong, financially and operationally,''
   Furthermore, ``We're not talking here about someone from outside
the industry taking over a company, somebody who doesn't know
anything about the industry ... '' Ross said.

<HEAD>Business Failures Decline, Researcher Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Business failures fell to the lowest level in
more than a decade last year, as massive savings and loans flops
and the real estate slump subsided, Dun &amp; Bradstreet Corp. reported
Wednesday.
   Business failures nationwide declined 12.9 percent to 49,719
from 57,099 in 1988, said Dun &amp; Bradstreet, a New York-based
marketer of business information.
   The decline was most pronounced in Texas, where business
failures dropped 32.4 percent to 5,323. However, failures rose 41.9
percent in Massachusetts to 789 as New England states reported an
increase in bankruptcies.
   Business failures, according to the report, are defined as
companies that cease operations for a number of reasons, including
bankruptcy, foreclosure or reorganization.
   Fewer failures were reported in agriculture, mining,
manufacturing and the services sector as well as in wholesale and
retail trade.
   But the finance, insurance and real estate sectors registered a
9.1 percent increase in business failures to 2,770 from 2,540 in
1988, the report said.
   ``The troubled savings and loan industry and the subsequent
stress in the real estate sector drove failures up earlier this
year, but the upward trend appears to be subsiding,'' said Joseph
W. Duncan, a Dun and Bradstreet economist.
   The largest regional decrease in business failures was in the
mountain states. Colorado showed a 32.8 percent drop, Utah was down
52.3 percent, Wyoming off 42.9 percent, New Mexico fell 14 percent
and Arizona declined 13.2 percent.

Netherlands; Australian Mutual Provident Society; Government of
Singapore Investment Corp. Pte Ltd. (GSIC); and SPP, Sweden.
   The names of the three other companies that have committed money
are not being disclosed, said Melanie Keenan, spokeswoman for Jones
Lang.
   Robert E. Riley, chairman of the Prudential Realty Group, and
Keith Douglas-Mann, chairman of Jones Lang Wooten, issued a joint
statement sayig that each member of the investment group brought
``significant knowledge of its own part of the world.'' The
combined experience and resources will complement each other, they
said.
   Cities under consideration for investment include Frankfurt,
West Germany; London; Paris; Sydney, Australia; and Toronto; as
well as Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York and Washington.
   The Prudential Realty Group, headquartered in Newark, manages
more than $45 billion in real estate assets and has 24 offices
throughout the United States.
   Jones Lang Wooten, based in London, has 58 offices worldwide,
including a U.S. headquarters in New York. It specializes in
investment and corporate real estate services.

   Bank of New England Corp. said Wednesday it sold
more of its vehicle leasing business, valued at $100 million, as
the banking company tries to raise cash to stem major losses.
   Bank of New England recently announced it sold the $350 million
U.S. portion of its McCullagh Leasing unit to GE Capital, a
subsidiary of General Electric Co.
   On Wednesday, the bank said it sold the remaining, Canadian
portion of the business to GE Capital. Tom Lavelle, a bank

businesses.
   ``This sale represents continued momentum in our plans to
increase equity capital, improve capital ratios and to strengthen
our financial resources,'' H. Ridgely Bullock, the bank's interim
chairman, said in a statement.
   The bank also expects to sign an agreement soon to sell $1.3
billion in home equity loans, he said.
   The bank has been trying to sell $6 billion in assets as it
faces estimated losses exceeding $1 billion in 1989 due largely to
bad real estate loans.
   In recent weeks, the bank has sold its credit card business to
Citicorp for $828 million, and has agreed to sell other leasing
businesses to the Bank of Tokyo for a profit of $92.5 million.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jon Baker helped finance a major Hollywood movie
and hosted Princess Di, but he admits there isn't much glamour in
his job title _ insurance salesman.
   ``When it comes to a life insurance salesman and a used car
salesman, a lot of people say `I'd rather affiliate with a used car
salesman.' So would I,'' Baker said. ``The industry breeds
mediocrity.''
   If it sounds like Baker is trying to shake up the insurance
business and remove its stigma as a boring profession that attracts
greedy loafers, you're right. He said the system needs to change so
agents will sell more policies and maintain them over a long period
of time.
   It's part of a formula that led Baker and his former partner,
John Lander, to sell $1 billion worth of insurance in 1988.
   ``There is no magic dust,'' said Baker, 47.
   He started in the insurance business in 1970, working for Mutual
of New York, but four years later he formed the partnership with
Lander.
   The two brought to this venture an assembly line system for
soliciting and meeting customers, planning policies, closing deals
and collecting referrals all at once, using differing workers.
   But Baker also had interests elsewhere.
   In 1978, he got Lander to join him in providing financial
backing for the motion picture, ``The Buddy Holly Story.''
   While the movie received three Academy Award nominations,
including one for best actor for Gary Busey, and won the award for
best sound track, Baker said the venture turned out to be a
financial nightmare.
   ``The picture went way overbudget,'' he said. ``I was in
constant warfare with the producer group. I'm surprised we ever got
it in the can.''
   The National Independent Theater Exhibitor sued Columbia
Pictures over the distribution rights, but the case was dismissed.
Yet the movie is still the source of litigation. Baker claims
Columbia hasn't fully paid him.
   ``Minnows who want to get into the water with sharks and
piranhas get eaten alive,'' he said.
   Baker admits his outside interests strained the partnership with
Lander.
   The breaking point came in early 1989, when Baker turned his
attention to the Royal Academy of Music in England. The year
before, he had become chairman of a newly created foundation that
would provide scholarships for Americans wishing to study at the
academy.
   In the fall of 1988, Baker was invited to London to meet with
Princess Diana, who served as president of the academy. He then
planned a reception for her in New York in February 1989.
   ``All of December, January and February, I was consumed in
this,'' he said. ``John (Lander) didn't like it. His motivations
were different.''
   Lander was more focused on the insurance business, and so the
two parted, each forming his own company.
   Baker's career in life insurance hasn't always gone well. When
Congress eliminated a tax break for corporate-owned life insurance
in 1986, Baker estimates his firm lost more than $3 million.
   ``Effectively, we went out of business,'' he said.
   But Baker and Lander rebuilt their company, looking for new
avenues to sell insurance.
   One fruitful idea has been to market insurance policies as a way
for businesses to stem the rising cost of health coverage. Under
this system, a company buys insurance on its workers, and when an
employee dies, the benefits are used to help cover the company's
medical costs.
   Baker acknowledges this scheme is a bit ``ghoulish,'' but says
insurance salesmen need to find creative ways to sell their product.
   ``This industry is so screwed up,'' said Baker, who now oversees
18 people in his office in Wellesley, a Boston suburb. ``There's an
opportunity for those who know what they're doing to generate an
unlimited amount of production and revenue.''
   In 1988, Baker said, this production generated $20 million worth
of premiums for the two partners, which translated to $1 billion
worth of insurance. Industry experts consider that a major
achievement.
   Baker has actively sought a high-profile image in the insurance
business, which is heavily concentrated in the Northeast. At a
recent conference of Boston-area life insurance salesmen, he
proposed lowering commissions for the first year, then raising them
in following years while the policy remains in effect.
   That move would encourage people to make more sales and keep the
policies from lapsing, he said.
   ``His view is from the standpoint of a very comfortable agent,''
said Jack Bobo, executive vice president of the National
Association of Life Underwriters. Agents receive large first-year
commissions because selling a policy requires a lot of planning
with the customer.
   ``If they cannot be rewarded, the experience is that the
planning doesn't get done,'' he said. Also, a cut in commissions
could push agents out of the business.
   But Baker said that's exactly what the insurance industry needs.
   ``Failing and marginal producers,'' he said, ``must be
terminated.''

   Here is a brief explanation of junk bonds and
their role in the nation's financial markets:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>WHAT ARE THEY?</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Corporate bonds rated below investment grade by either Standard
&amp; Poor's Corp. or Moody's Investors Service are considered
``junk.'' That means a company's ability to pay interest and repay
principal is considered speculative, meaning there is a higher risk
of default. To compensate, the bonds carry higher yields _
currently, an average of 15.35 percent, compared with 9.62 percent
for investment-grade corporate bonds and 8.32 percent for 10-year
U.S. government bonds, according to Moody's.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>MARKET SIZE:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Moody's estimates there are more than $200 billion in junk bonds
outstanding, representing about 25 percent of all corporate bond
issues. The market mushroomed in the 1980s, growing almost nine
times in size.
   In contrast, all debt issued by the nation's non-financial
concerns, which includes government borrowings, totals about $9.6
trillion. The nation's equity market, or stocks, is worth about
$3.2 trillion.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>DREXEL'S ROLE:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. propelled the market's growth and
was by far the biggest underwriter and trader of junk bonds. The
firm promoted the use of junk bonds to raise money for small or
young companies unable to issue investment-grade bonds, and to
finance corporate takeovers. Drexel says 59 percent of the money
raised by junk issues from 1980 to 1988 went to finance companies'
internal growth while the remaining 41 percent was used to finance
takeovers.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>ISSUERS:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   They range from young, fast-growing companies such as MCI
Communications Corp. and McCaw Cellular Communications Inc. to
acquired corporations such as Federated Department Stores Inc. and
RJR Nabisco. Federated and RJR issued billions of dollars worth of
bonds to finance their takeovers by Campeau Corp. and buyout
specialist Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &amp; Co., respectively.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>INVESTORS:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The biggest owners of junk bonds are mutual funds and insurance
companies, each of which holds about 30 percent of the bonds
outstanding, Moody's estimates. Pension funds hold about 15 percent
of the market, foreign investors about 9 percent and savings and
loan associations about 7 percent. The S&amp;L bailout bill passed late
last year by Congress requires thrifts to sell their junk holdings
by 1994.

<HEAD>Aetna's Profit Down 28 Percent; Transamerica Income Jumps 31
Percent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Aetna Life &amp; Casualty Co. on Wednesday reported a 28 percent
drop in fourth-quarter net income, attributed to higher catastrophe
costs and rising costs in automobile losses, while Transamerica
Corp.'s profit jumped 31 percent.
   Aetna, based in Hartford, Conn., posted net income for the
fourth quarter of $151 million, or $1.35 a share, down from $209
million, or $1.85 a share, in the same quarter of 1988.
   The decline occurred despite an increase in fourth-quarter
revenue to $5.2 billion from $4.35 billion a year earlier.
   For the full year, Aetna reported net income of $676 million, or
$6.02 a share, down 5 percent from $713 million, or $6.25 a share,
in 1988. Revenue for 1989 totaled $19.6 billion, up from $17.8
billion the previous year.
   Aetna said its losses from catastrophes reduced fourth-quarter
income by $66 million and 1989 earnings by $170 million, after
taxes. The fourth-quarter losses came mainly from freezing weather
in December and the October earthquake in California.
   Aetna Chairman James T. Lynn said losses were partially offset
by stronger earnings from employee benefits businesses and
increased capital gains.
   San Francisco-based Transamerica credited strong performances in
its insurance and finance businesses for its robust gain in
fourth-quarter profit.
   For the three months ended Dec. 31, the company posted net
income of $76.1 million, or 95 cents a share, up 31 percent from
$58 million, or 73 cents a share, in the same period in 1988.
   The 1988 fourth-quarter results included $1.5 million in gains
from investments.
   For all of 1989, Transamerica's net income was $332.2 million,
or $4.18 a share, up from $262.1 million, or $3.30 a share, in
1988. The annual figures include capital gains of $40.2 million in
1989 and $10.8 million in 1988.
   The 1988 results also include a $36.9 million one-time reduction
in the first quarter because of a new rule on accounting for income
taxes.

<TEXT>
   AT&amp;T reported a slight increase in
long distance telephone calls Wednesday as the company offered
Valentine's Day discounts to make up for a nine-hour service
disruption last month.
   Call volume was up about 1 percent from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., the
hours of the special, AT&amp;T spokesman Mike Keady said. There were
about 78.6 million calls attempted during those hours, up from 77.7
million the previous Wednesday, he said.
   The long distance network handles about 110 million calls on a
normal business day.
   The discount applied to residential and most business customers,
including credit card and toll-free ``800'' calls.
   A programming error in AT&amp;T's call switching network partially
knocked out long-distance service nationwide for about nine hours
Jan. 15, keeping millions of calls from being completed.
   Lynn Newman, another spokesperson at AT&amp;T's operations
headquarters in Basking Ridge, said the discount was the only
measure planned by AT&amp;T to compensate customers.
   ``This is our way of saying you're a valuable customer,'' Ms.
Newman said.
   The phone giant offered long-distance customers an average 33
percent discount off regular daytime rates for calls within the
United States between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. Discounts averaged about 37
percent off calls to 158 countries worldwide.
   In some states where local utility regulators gave the company
permission, discounts also applied to intra-state calls handled by
AT&amp;T, she said.
   ``I think it's a very generous way for them to atone for any
damages done,'' said Jim Furlong, spokesman for Computer Sciences
Corp. of Los Angeles, a computer services company that relies
heavily on long distance calling.
   Furlong said the company did not attempt to determine how much
money, if any, it lost during the nine-hour outage.
   ``We're not the least bothered or concerned by that one-day
problem,'' he said.
   ``It's a very nice gesture,'' said Roger Connor, a spokesman for
Marriott Corp., which relies on long-distance telephone calls for
reservations for its 530 hotels worldwide. ``I think it's more than
adequate.''
   Connor said the company did not believe it lost money because of
the outage.
   Mary O'Neill, a spokeswoman for American Airlines, said her
company was trying to work out compensation for the outage that
affected reservation lines last month.
   ``Because we had a special corporate contract, we were not
eligible for that discount,'' said Ms. O'Neill. She said the
airlines is negotiating with AT&amp;T to find ``an acceptable
settlement.''
   She said American's volume of calls was reduced by about
two-thirds on the day of the outage.

   The Chicago Mercantile Exchange on Wednesday

   But the first objective of the world's second-largest commodity

bruising revelation of a federal trading-fraud investigation, the
Merc's board of governors said in a statement.
   ``In order to maintain our successful momentum, there must be
absolute confidence in the integrity of our markets,'' the
statement said.
   The continuing investigation of trading practices at the Merc
and the larger Chicago Board of Trade has yielded indictments
against 48 people, 26 of them Merc traders.
   Leo Melamed, chairman of the Merc board's executive committee,
said the free-market revolution in Eastern Europe promises to
revitalize the Merc's agricultural futures and options markets,
which were overshadowed by the wildly successful development of
financial futures in the 1980s.
   People in the emerging democracies of Eastern Europe want more
meat and importers there can be taught how to protect their
businesses from market fluctuations by using futures and options to
lock in prices in advance, Melamed said in a telephone interview.
   In addition to its existing cattle, hog and pork-belly
contracts, the Merc may develop new hedging instruments
specifically for the Eastern European market, he said.
   ``We're going to make that into quite a priority because it
looks like there's a demand for it,'' Melamed said.
   The board also proposed a new business venture, the CME Resource
and Service Co., to develop products and services for market users
and divide the profits among the Merc's approximately 2,700 members.
   Some of the ventures CME Resource may pursue include publishing,
telecommunications services, accounting services and trade-clearing
for markets other than the Merc, Melamed said.
   The venture would be modeled after Globex, an automated global
trading network the Merc is developing with Reuters Holdings PLC
that will return profits to exchange members.
   Globex will be launched in the spring, the Merc said.

<HEAD>Creditors Say They Won't Push for Liquidation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   Unsecured creditors of Eastern Airlines said
Tuesday they would work with the carrier to reach agreement on a
bankruptcy reorganization plan rather than push for Eastern's
liquidation.
   The committee representing unsecured creditors, a group composed
mainly of trade suppliers such as aircraft manufacturers who are
owed about $1.1 billion by Eastern, made the announcement after
meeting in New York.
   In a statement, the committee said it was briefed by its
financial advisers about Eastern's proposed reorganization plan,
other reorganization alternatives and ``the potential recovery to
be achieved in a liquidation.''
   Eastern proposed only partial repayment of its debts in its
latest reorganization proposal filed with the federal bankruptcy
court in New York in late January. Previously, the carrier had
promised to repay its debts in full.
   ``The creditors committee has made no determination to pursue a
liquidation in this case,'' the unsecured creditors' statement said.
   ``The creditors committee intends to proceed with immediate
negotiations with Eastern, Texas Air and the examiner with a view
toward achieving a consensual plan of reorganization that is in the
best interests of creditors and which provides for a viable Eastern
Airlines going forward.''
   Eastern spokesman Robin Matell welcomed the creditors committee
statement.
   ``We look forward to continuing negotiations with the committee
in hopes of reaching a consensual agreement,'' he said late Tuesday.
   Eastern's reorganization plan calls for paying unsecured
creditors only 10 percent of their debts in cash when the airline
emerges from bankruptcy protection, and another 70 percent over the
following 10 years, without interest.
   In return for accepting partial repayment, Texas Air would give
the unsecured creditors a 40 percent equity stake in Eastern.
   The plan also calls for paying preferred stockholders no more
than 10 cents on the dollar in the form of new securities. The
preferred holders, who are owed $1.175 billion, criticized
Eastern's reorganization plans and advocated the liquidation or
outright sale of the airline two weeks.
   The Machinists union has been on strike against Eastern since
last March 4. It was joined in sympathy walkouts by pilots and
flight attendants, forcing the airline into bankruptcy court
protection on March 9. The pilots and flight attendants abandoned
their strikes just before Thanksgiving, but Eastern has rebuilt as
a smaller carrier and hired mostly non-union workers to replace the
strikers.
