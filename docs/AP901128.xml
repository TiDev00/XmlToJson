   Charles Hill, chief of bureau for The Associated
Press in Minneapolis since 1984, has been named chief of bureau for
Michigan.
   The appointment was announced Wednesday by AP President Louis D.
Boccardi and is effective Jan. 1.
   In Detroit, Hill succeeds Henry Ackerman who has been named
chief of bureau for Georgia and Alabama.
   Hill, 37, began his AP career in his native Charlotte, N.C., in
1975 and took another temporary assignment later that year in
Raleigh, N.C. In 1976, the University of North Carolina graduate
moved to Hartford, Conn., as a probationary newsman.
   Two years later, Hill was appointed news editor for Connecticut.
He transferred to Washington, D.C., as an editor in 1980. A year
later, he moved to Dallas as a desk supervisor.
   In 1982, Hill was named correspondent in Houston and in 1983 he
returned to Dallas as assistant chief of bureau for Texas. He was
promoted a year later to chief of bureau for Minnesota, North
Dakota and South Dakota.
   In 1989, Hill directed the transition when the Dakotas were
split off as a separate AP territory and Tena Haraldson was named
the Dakotas' first chief of bureau, in Sioux Falls, S.D.

<TEXT>
   Economic and political problems
are growing in Brazil, and President Fernando Collor de Mello's
conservative government is under attack from all sides.
   Businessmen say the country is being driven into an unnecessary
recession. Labor leaders complain that paychecks are eaten up by
inflation.
   Professional groups rail against authoritarian government
officials, and even Collor's congressional allies are in open
rebellion.
   ``The government is growing increasingly isolated,'' said Walder
de Goes, a political science professor at the University of
Brasilia. ``It has lost almost all support from organized sectors
of society. The president must show a greater willingness to
negotiate and less arrogance.''
   Inflation has risen steadily since May. It totaled 13.7 percent
last month and many observers predict nearly 20 percent in
December.
   Business bankruptcies are up, unemployment is increasing and a
steep recession appears to be developing.
   Bad economic news has led to harsh public confrontations between
the government and businessmen, who had been Collor's most
enthusiastic backers. The president has said corporations cause
inflation by not reducing their profit margins.
   ``We need more love for our motherland instead of for only
what's in our pockets,'' he told Brazilian reporters during a trip
to Japan in November.
   In response, businessmen say they are being made scapegoats for
the administration's economic failures.
   ``Just because they're too incompetent to beat inflation, we
can't all be held responsible,'' Antonio Ermirio de Moraes,
director of the huge conglomerate Grupo Votorantim, said in an
interview with the Rio daily O Globo. He also said there were
``thieves'' in the government, and Justice Minister Jarbas
Passarinho threatened him with legal action.
   Jair Meneguelli, president of the Workers Central Union, the
largest and most radical labor federation, has threatened to
withdraw from government-sponsored talks on a national ``social
pact.''
   One round was postponed in November and Meneguelli said his
union would meet with its traditional enemy, the Federation of
Industries of Sao Paulo State, to draw up a joint proposal for the
``social pact'' negotiations.
   ``The government has reason to fear this union because capital
and labor have a strength, and that strength can change the
government's plans,'' said the union leader, who represents 12
million workers.
   Early in November, the Brazilian Bar Association urged Collor to
reverse a decree limiting the sex and violence content of
television programs in prime time. Tales Castelo Branco,
association president, said the decree was unconstitutional and
amounted to censorship.
   Presidential spokesman Claudio Humberto Rosa e Silva responded:
``I'd like to suggest the Association president return to school,
and if he lacks the humility to return to school, he should at
least read the constitution.''
   At a ceremony launching a low-income housing program, Collor
declared: ``No one is going to put a straitjacket on this
president. I'm going to continue to work for the needy, without
fear of those who want to continue oppressing our people with lies,
radicalism and violence.''
   A poll published by the newspaper Folha de Sao Paulo indicated
support for Collor's economic austerity measures was at a record
low. The survey, conducted in Brazil's 10 largest cities, found 43
percent of respondents opposed, 26 percent supporting Collor and
the rest neutral.
   In mid-November, the government suffered several important
defeats in Congress, where it technically has a comfortable
majority. Collor lost one vote, on retirement benefits, by a
humiliating 264-41.
   ``The government has a majority ... but not an organized
majority it commands,'' said Rep. Gastone Righi of the conservative
Brazilian Labor Party. Righi, who previously supported Collor, said
his party would now condition its support on economic results.
   Renan Calheiros, Collor's long-time political ally, quit as the
president's House leader and broke with the government. ``The
president is becoming crazy,'' Calheiros said in resigning. ``He
has a total contempt for Congress.''
   Villas Boas-Correa, a leading political analyst, said Collor was
lucky in the timing of his problems: Congress is due to recess
until March and the year-end holidays are approaching in the hot
southern hemisphere summer.
   ``Public opinion is basically shut down for the next few
months,'' he said. ``If the government can regain control of the
economy in the near future, Collor will be able to recoup at least
part of his prestige.''

<TEXT>
   James Beard, often called the dean of American
food, rose early most days. Not to get to the markets or his stove,
but to talk on the telephone - a morning constitutional of gossip
that could last two hours.
   Now Beard himself, five years after his death at 81, is at the
center of a roiling kettle of gossip.
   Fermenting the gossip is a pair of biographies, both a tribute
to his pivotal role in the development of an American cuisine. One
of the books is a celebration; the other is a portrait ``warts and
all.''
   ``There is a `bonfire of the foodies' quality about this,'' said
Robert Clark, who is writing a third biography of Beard. ``These
are all good-hearted people who are competing to sit on his throne
and then competing for status and stature in the food business.''
   Beard was the genius behind the ``discovery'' of American
cooking, reveling in the fine preparation of simple, local
ingredients - the same qualities that have become watchwords of
good eating in this country. Many people who knew him called him a
``walking encyclopedia'' of gastronomy. Food, he preached, should
always be fun.
   He gave up hope of a career in the opera after nodes developed
on his vocal cords, and turned to acting, but soon found few parts
for a man his size (6-foot-4 and 200 to 300 pounds), according to
Evans Jones' book, ``Epicurean Delight.''
   So he brought drama to an early love - food.
   ``Like theater, offering food to people is a matter of
showmanship, and no matter how simple the performance, until you do
it well, with love and originality, you have a flop on your
hands,'' he once wrote.
   Stylish and outgoing, Beard also had a remarkable ability to
attract all sorts of people willing to help him cook, write,
organize his life and, in later years, get around.
   ``James gave to everybody; but the bargain implied giving in
return,'' wrote Barbara Kafka, the editor of the other Beard book,
``The James Beard Celebration.''
   ``People would do unbelievable things for Jim in work and in
personal service, things he accepted with such ease and lack of
self-consciousness that any notion of burden was eschewed,'' she
wrote.
   Beard traveled frequently and found friends, students and
colleagues everywhere he spent time: Oregon, California, New York,
London and France. There were cooks, restaurateurs, writers,
childhood friends, theater, movie and opera people.
   He wrote 22 books and countless newspaper and magazine articles,
consulted for restaurants, catered, opened cooking schools, and was
a spokesman for kitchen equipment and food products. He was a
pioneer of backyard cooking and of television cooking shows, though
he lacked Julia Child's affinity for the camera.
   ``To oversimplify matters, he was the person who almost
single-handedly transformed America's eating habits from salt and
pepper and ketchup on the table to much more complex pleasures,''
said George Lang, owner of the New York restaurant Cafe des
Artistes, and also a food columnist and friend of Beard's for 35
years.
   Until Beard, cooking in America was essentially European, said
Kafka, whose book is full of reminiscences and recipes from those
who knew Beard.
   Her book is an invitation to join Beard and his friends and
their food, and was published to raise money for the James Beard
Foundation, established four years ago in Beard's Greenwich Village
townhouse by Child, Peter Kump, its president, and others.
   The foundation offers workshops, book parties, dinners and
exhibits of food photography and art. A scholarship program is
expected to begin granting money next year.
   ``Both books are really quite wonderful in their own way,'' Lang
said. ``The question is what you're interested in. If you're
interested in recipes for your main course, then Barbara Kafka's
book will be for you, and the anecdotes will be dessert.'' The
opposite is true for Jones' book.
   Clark, who edits the Journal of Gastronomy, said his book will
include no recipes, but will be ``the story of American food over a
100-year period as told through the life of James Beard.''
   Beard grew up an only child in Oregon, where his mother had run
a hotel and where she instilled in him her fascination with fine
food.
   ``I cooked fairly seriously by the time I was 14 and 15,'' Beard
is quoted as saying in Kafka's book. ``I never really learned. I
had a funny feeling that I could take something I ate and reproduce
it - like a musician with music.''
   It was a time Beard also documented, in ``Delights and
Prejudices,'' his 1964 memoirs. At least in part, Beard's efforts
to write a sequel inspired Jones and Kafka.
   ``He apparently tried to break his writing block with several
people,'' said Kump, a Beard friend who opened Peter Kump's New
York Cooking School.
   Jones' wife and editor, Judith Jones of Alfred A. Knopf Inc.,
said Beard made some tapes with her husband, which became material
for his book. And Kafka's book begins with a transcript of a tape
he made with her.
   Beard the gossip might have delighted in Beard the topic of
gossip, friends said.
   Jones writes of friendships that fell apart, business
difficulties and the effects of Beard's domineering mother.
   Some people were unhappy that both books mention Beard's
homosexuality, Clark said.
   In Kafka's book, Beard himself brings it up, in a tape he made,
saying, ``By the time I was 7, I knew that I was gay. I think it's
time to talk about that now.''
   Jones has heard the accusation that his book is homophobic,
perhaps in part because the subject is introduced in a footnote.
But he insisted he was merely being discreet, and that Beard's
sexuality is irrelevant.
   ``There is a strong feeling of wanting to protect his memory and
wanting to inherit his reputation on the part of a lot of people,''
Clark said. ``He made people feel like he was totally theirs. And I
think the world is full of people who feel that they knew him
best.''
   ``We didn't quite know how sticky that would be,'' Mrs. Jones
said.
   Kafka won't discuss Jones' book. Asked why, she said, ``Have you
read it to the end?''
   In the final chapter, Jones describes her as a writer who at the
time she and Beard met, may have known more about ``courts of
intrigue than she did about the world of food.''
   ``I haven't read what Barbara calls her book,'' Jones said.
   But beyond the gossip and the disagreements, Kump said, it's
important that so much is being written about Beard.
   ``Jim made a tremendously significant contribution to gastronomy
in this country,'' Kump said.
   And, he noted, all but two of Beard's own books are back in
print.

   It could be the site of a drug deal. In a dingy
back alley off Kenmore Square, the black steel doors of a
graffiti-scarred brick building open onto a hallway where addicts
gather each day for a fix.
   This is the Habit Management Institute, the state's busiest
methadone clinic. Some 500 people pass through its doors every day
for a dose of the drug that staves off the craving for heroin.
   And while this is not an illicit drug trade, it is a business.
The clinic is privately owned and turns a profit, like any company.
Many of its clients, as they are called, are middle-class and pay
for their doses the same way they buy bread.
   As clinic Vice President Robert Potter put it: ``If you can pay
the freight, we can provide a first-class service.''
   Twice a week, Jerry, 35, who wouldn't give his last name, shows
up at the clinic in a dress shirt and tie before gong to work as a
computer operator for the state.
   Jerry's father died when he was young, and his mother was an
alcoholic. At 22 he became a heroin addict. Three years ago he
started coming to Habit Management.
   ``I pay cash every week,'' he said. ``And there's an incentive
to stay clean. I don't want to pay my own money here and then go
out and spend more on heroin.''
   The clinic opens early to accommodate working people. Seven days
a week, at 6:15 a.m. sharp, the alley doors open and clients stream
in.
   Standing in line, they pay the required fee - $105 a week for
methadone and counseling - to a burly clinic supervisor manning a
cashbox.
   Each person then gets an identification tag showing they are
clients - not street people looking for drugs - and moves down the
line to get their dose.
   Standing behind a counter, a nurse puts a peach-colored
methadone tablet about the size of a poker chip into a paper cup.
Hot water is poured in, with a drop of orange syrup mixed in for
taste.
   The client gulps it down, and is off - to work, home, to
college. At 10 a.m. the doors close.
   ``We get housewives, plumbers,'' said clinic founder Lenny
Kupsc. ``Most of our clients are white, middle-age males with a
high school diploma.''
   A social service worker by trade, Kupsc decided to start his own
business after a brush with cancer. With an estimated 40,000
intravenous drug-users in Massachusetts, a methadone clinic seemed
like a sure-fire success.
   Taking his inspiration from California, where many private,
for-profit drug clinics sprang up after the tax-cutting measure
Proposition 13 cut state services, Kupsc opened Habit Management in
Boston in 1986.
   ``There was a business model that showed you could provide a
quality service and that people who were addicted to drugs were
willing to pay for it,'' Kupsc said.
   Similar clinics have sprung up across the country during the
past 10 to 15 years, according to Wendell Turner, a spokesman for
the National Association of State Alcohol and Drug Abuse Directors
in Washington, D.C.
   At Habit Management, business boomed. Kupsc opened clinics in
Lowell, Springfield and South Yarmouth. His company even bought two
mobile homes and turned them into moving clinics to service other
towns.
   Some communities fought against having the clinics, and some
social service workers criticized the idea of a profitable
methadone business.
   ``Addicts are a very vulnerable population, and there were
questions about whether this should be something that people profit
from,'' said Janice Kauffman, chairman of the Massachusetts
Methadone Treatment Providers Association.
   But in 1988, the state came to Habit Management, seeking help in
meeting the demand for methadone treatment.
   With the specter of AIDS looming, more intravenous drug users
were getting subsidized methadone treatment in an effort to halt
the spread of the disease.
   ``Things changed when AIDS became a big scare,'' Kauffman said.
``It was serving nobody to not have more treatment for IV drug
users. I don't think there was a passion to treat heroin users, but
there is a passion to treat AIDS.''
   So Kupsc agreed to take on state clients who received Medicaid
or other funding. Where once he only served those who paid with
their own money, today 70 percent of his clients are subsidized.
   Kupsc wears an earring, a gym suit and expensive running shoes,
as he pads around his spacious office. He won't reveal Habit
Management's profits, or his own personal income.
   But he defended his clinics, saying clients receive counseling
and are regularly checked for illicit drugs. The state licenses his
operation and keeps a close eye on it, he added.
   ``The state is more diligent when it comes to me,'' Kupsc said.
``There's a mentality that if you're making money, that's evil and
you have to be watched.
   ``But with public money being impacted, the traditional network
of services are at risk,'' he said. ``Someone's got to pick up the
ball. It's got to be the entrepreneurs who see there's an
opportunity.''

<HEAD>Britain's Sunday Correspondent Newspaper Closes After 14 Months</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Sunday Correspondent, a weekly newpaper with
national circulation, is folding after failing to find the
investment needed to stay afloat, the paper's management has
announced.
   The Sunday Correspondent, which includes the Chicago Tribune
among major shareholders, was launched on to the crowded Sunday
newspaper scene on Sept. 17, 1989 at a cost of $25.5 million.
   But sales of the paper fell below the 350,000 figure needed to
break even and last August shareholders pumped in another $19
million to keep it going.
   The paper also switched editors in what it called ``the
interests of the continued shareholder support'' and on Sept. 30 it
changed from a broadsheet to a tabloid.
   But the move failed to increase its share of the mass national
readership in this nation of 57 million people and the paper's
chief executive, Nick Shott, said Tuesday night that its final
circulation had fallen to 210,000.
   The demise of the Sunday Correspondent leaves Britain with 10
national weekly Sunday newspapers.
   Like its competitors and TV and radio stations, the paper has
been hit by falling advertising revenue in Britain's current
economic recession.
   Shott said the closure will mean the loss of about 200 jobs.

   In the Middle Ages, French feudal lords bedded the
wives of their serfs and called it a nobleman's right. Nowadays,
male executives prey on female employees, but some women are
fighting back.
   It is a new, difficult battle for French women, 70 percent of
whom work outside the home.
   According to a survey by the European Community's executive
commission, 36 percent of working women in France reported being
harassed sexually by bosses or co-workers.
   ``Sexual harassment has been around for centuries, yet it's
still a taboo subject,'' said Marie-Victoire Louis, a sociologist
and co-founder of the Association to Fight Violence Against Women
at Work.
   ``Any woman who brings charges of sexual harassment against her
employer runs the risk of being ridiculed, isolated, not believed,
and, naturally, of being fired, if she hasn't been already.''
   Prospects of better treatment on the job are improving for
women, who mke up 41 percent of the work force. The National
Assembly is working on legislation, expected to pass in the spring,
that would make sexual harassment a crime punishable by large fines
and prison terms of two to five years.
   The government agency that monitors women's rights is looking
for ways of changing labor laws to enable inspectors to intervene
in harassment cases and make employers responsible for the security
of female workers.
   ``Only the employer can put an end to sexual harassment,'' Mrs.
Louis said. ``By law, employers are required to provide working
conditions which respect the employees' health and safety, and that
includes an environment free of sexual harassment.''
   She said the campaign against sexual harassment got an
unexpected boost from a satirical film about two female postal
workers who turn the system to their advantage.
   ``Promotion Canape'' (Couch Promotion), written and directed by
Didier Kaminka, has attracted about 1 million viewers since it
opened in October. Xavier Gelin, the producer, said negotiations
were under way for a Hollywood remake.
   ``For me, sexual harassment can be defined as repeated advances
that end up turning into blackmail,'' Kaminka said in an interview.
``Sexual harassment is rampant when there's high unemployment and
young, inexperienced women without specialized training are afraid
to lose their jobs.''
   Kaminka said he spent four months inside the postal service,
where he found the expression ``couch promotion'' to be part of the
vernacular. One scene shows actress Grace de Capitani obtaining a
desirable apartment from the postal service's housing administrator
only after promising sex.
   ``Officials said publicly that everything in the film is
fiction, but I can tell you it's all true,'' Kaminka said.
   Mrs. Louis criticized the film for playing down the violence
that accompanies many acts of sexual harassment.
   In her small office in eastern Paris, she pointed to a pile of
dossiers of women who had been abused verbally and physically,
beaten and raped by their male employers.
   She described Mrs. A., a dental assistant who submitted to her
boss's repeated advances because she had an unemployed husband and
a baby. When she finally rejected him, he reduced her salary,
bullied her and slapped her.
   Charged with assault, he denied sexual harassment and said Mrs.
A. had consented to his attentions. She later withdrew the charges
in exchange for a letter of dismissal and 40,000 francs ($8,000) in
damages.
   Another case involved Mrs. B., 24, hired by a town official who
abused, threatened, raped and blackmailed her for two years.
   Mrs. B. finally went to authorities and the official was charged
with several sex and assault offenses involving other women,
including a minor.
   Despite a statement of support from the mayor, the official was
convicted and sent to jail. He was released, however, and the case
is still pending.
   Fanny-pinching, skirt-chasing males have been French theater
fare for centuries, from Moliere's Tartuffe to the heroes of
slapstick boulevard comedies, but Mrs. Louis said:
   ``There's nothing funny about the abuse of an employer's
power.''

<HEAD>Death Squad Turns Over Weapons To Government</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A death squad has turned over 330
weapons to the government in a sign that a decade of massacres and
vigilante justice could be ending in a northwestern banana-growing
province.
   The paramilitary group handed in automatic weapons, a
shouder-fired anti-aircraft missile, grenades, jeeps and
sophisticated radio equipment, a police spokeswoman said Tuesday.
She asked not to be identified, a standard practice at national
police headquarters.
   The group is led by fugitive millionaire Fidel Castano.
   Castano's squad has been blamed for killing scores of peasants
in a series of massacres in Cordoba province. The group says it was
formed to protect ranchers and farmers from leftist guerrillas, who
rustled cattle and extorted so-called revolutionary taxes.
   But a secret police investigation revealed that the group,
financed by the Medellin drug cartel, became a right-wing death
squad.
   Castano has said his group's decision to disband is a response
to a cease-fire declared by the Maoist-inspired rebel group,
People's Liberation Army, which with two other insurgent groups is
holding peace talks with the government.
   Last weekend, Castano donated about 3,000 acres of land to
peasants in the region. The weapons were turned over Monday in Alto
Sinu, Cordoba.
   The arms handover was marked by a ceremony attended by the
governor and representatives of the attorney general's office.
   Castano, who has several arrest warrants against him, did not
attend.
   Last month, another paramilitary group turned over about 200
weapons in Pacho, a town 50 miles north of Bogota.
   That group had been led by Jose Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, the
Medellin cocaine cartel's No. 2 leader who was killed by police
nearly one year ago. Pacho was Rodrigeuz Gacha's hometown.
   In September, President Cesar Gaviria said that drug traffickers
and paramilitary group leaders can receive reduced jail sentences
if they surrender and turn over weapons.

   Some Western nations are gathering
food, medicine, coal and heating oil for the Soviet Union, but
others are skeptical about Moscow's need for emergency aid.
   They wonder if the Soviet Union, the world's largest grain
producer, really needs food. They also worry about the Soviets'
ability to distribute supplies.
   Signals from the Soviet Union have been confusing, with some
Soviets saying they have plenty of food.
   President Bush said America would try to help if necessary.
However, U.S. officials say there is no evidence of widespread
hunger - that there is food in the cities and the agricultural
regions of the Soviet Union.
   Many relief workers and government officials hestitate to join
the food effort because of reports that some parts of the Soviet
Union refuse to share food with others. And in many cases, Soviets
are malnourished or undernourished, not starving.
   Officials at the Japanese Foreign Ministry, for instance,
maintain help is more urgently needed by starving people in Asia
and Africa. Japanese officials are considering sending medicine to
the Soviets.
   Germany, the biggest proponent of sending food to the Soviet
Union, is worried about whether the goods will reach the hungriest
people.
   The German Red Cross says it has $2 billion to spend on shipping
private donations, including hundreds of thousands of tons of
sugar, milk, grain, heating oil, coal and toothpaste.
   However, hundreds of trains carrying the Soviet Union's normal
food purchases are halted at its borders because Soviet tracks are
a different size and the foreign rail cars cannot enter the
country. There are not enough people to unload the goods, so German
food already shipped has not reached the interior.
   ``We know there are problems in the Soviet Union of things
getting lost,'' said Mats Karlsson, who oversees Swedish aid to
Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.
   He said many private organizations are reluctant to get
involved.
   ``Our experience from other countries is that you are very
dependent on the systems that exist,'' Karlsson said. ``(In the
Soviet Union) ... the economic system is being changed, and we
don't know what it's being changed to.''
   Finland, the only European country with rail lines that match
the Soviet Union's, sent railway officials to Germany this week to
discuss the transportation problem. But the Finns say there is no
need to send food.
   ``There is little on the shop shelves, but the people aren't
starving, and there are no reports of hunger, either,'' said Pentti
Partanen of the Finnish Red Cross.
   The German branch of the Catholic relief organization, Caritas,
said it would try to get past the Soviet rail bottleneck by setting
up a truck convoy. Caritas is sending packages of staples to
religious organizations around Moscow.
   Germany, Italy, Canada, Spain and Britain have promised up to
$10 billion in aid, Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev's spokesman
Vitaly Ignatenko said. Only Britain actually has set aside funds
for the aid.
   The Economic Community is also considering a $1 billion donation
suggested by the Italian government.
   Much of the food is being collected from individuals at Red
Cross branches, and the Norwegian defense force and the Berlin
municipal authority have offered their Cold War stockpiles of food.
However, the International Committee of the Red Cross has no plans
to discuss a coordinated relief project until early next month.
   Sweden is concentrating on helping the Soviet Baltic republics
establish free market economies. Britain has set up a $40 million
fund to help the Soviets learn about food distribution, energy,
small businesses and financial services.
   Many other organizations and states say they are not considering
sending aid because the Soviets haven't asked.
   Soviet Ambassador Nikolai Uspensky said on Swedish television
last week that the main problem facing the Soviets is ``the
mechanism of bringing (the food) from the field to the shop floor,
to the shop shelves,''
   ``When this chain breaks, there can be so many reasons:
inefficiency, sheer sloppiness, it can be political motivations,
sheer criminal motivations, anything,'' Uspensky said.
   Halvard Kvamsdal, a former Red Cross official in Norway, said he
often crosses the border to the Soviet Union and ``it has never
been this bad.'' Still, when he asked his Soviet neighbors last
week what they needed, they requested toys and clothes.
   ``Whoever has food is sitting on it,'' Karlsson said. ``There is
a shortage, which gives rise to malnourishment. But the Soviet
Union has been living with malnourishment for a long time.''

   Troublemaker-elect Bernard Sanders is getting
his first taste of the institution he describes as ``out of touch
with the American people.''
   A self-described socialist elected to the House as an
independent from Vermont, Sanders is among 44 incoming freshmen in
Congress enduring interminable orientation sessions, lectures on
everything from office allowances to ethics, from computers to the
``Customs, Decorum and Unwritten Rules of the House.''
   But Sanders is determined to violate one unwritten House rule,
the dictum that freshmen be rarely seen and never heard.
   ``People in Vermont know me,'' he said. ``They sent me down here
to cause trouble. That's what they sent me down here to do.''
   The 49-year-old former mayor of Burlington lost no time keeping
that campaign promise. With rhetoric as unruly as his gray hair,
Sanders took on Congress.
   ``You're asking me, do I think the Congress of the United States
is out of touch with the American people?'' he said. ``I do.''
   According to Sanders, it's time Congress represented working
people and poor people. ``Does this body do that today? It does
not. ... The majority of the American people think, as I do, that
this institution is dominated by big money and the wealthy.''
   Will Sanders line up with the congressional majority backing
President Bush on the Persian Gulf? Not likely.
   ``I have very, very, very serious concerns about President
Bush's policies,'' he said. ``I absolutely do not agree that there
needs to be an offensive war against Iraq.''
   Will he dive for cover at the mention of the dreaded word,
taxes?
   ``I'll tackle it,'' he said. ``The tax system in this country is
an absurdity. It's grossly unfair. You can solve the deficit
problem by asking the wealthiest people in this country and the
large corporations who have enjoyed huge tax breaks to start paying
their fair share.''
   On Nov. 6, Vermont voters dumped Republican Rep. Peter Smith in
favor of Sanders. A freshman, Smith ran afoul of anti-incumbent
fever fueled by budget negotiations that left Republicans looking
like the party trying to protect the wealthy from paying more
taxes.
   The anti-incumbent mood was not limited to Vermont.
   At a session held Tuesday by the Democratic Study Group, newly
elected members were in an aggressive mood.
   ``We have been in the trenches ... We have heard from the
people,'' said Calvin Dooley of California, who defeated Republican
Charles Pashayan Jr.
   Jim Moran of Virginia, who ousted Republican Stan Parris, said
he hoped the Democrats would press their tax fairness issue in the
new Congress. ``That is the Democratic theme. If we don't use the
issue, we've blown it,'' he said.
   While learning the ins and outs of his new job, Sanders tried
with limited success to temper his naturally aggressive instincts.
After all, while he sat among Democrats, he was not one of them and
his relationship with the majority party was shaky at best.
   ``I think it's fair to say some of the leadership will not
accept me with open arms,'' said Sanders. He would like to
participate in the Democratic Caucus while retaining his status as
an independent.
   The Democratic Caucus meets Monday and the question of whether
to admit Sanders to its ranks will be on the agenda. House leaders
have taken no public position on the question.
   Even with a mandate to ``come down here and give them hell,''
Sanders is no different from his colleagues in his desire to get
good committee assignments. He'd like Education and Labor and
Banking.
   He talks less than he did back home about the need to throw out
the two major parties.
   ``As I've said to the people of Vermont, my election can serve
as an inspiration to many people out in this country who are sick
and tired of the two-party system, and I think that it will,'' he
said. ``My function is not to be running around the country
starting a third party. My function is to be the best congressman
that I can be.''

   House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt is the
first congressional leader to oppose authorizing use of military
force in the near future to drive Iraq out of Kuwait.
   ``The best policy now is to enforce the (economic) sanctions. I
am against authorizing force now,'' Gephardt, D-Mo., said Tuesday
in a telephone interview. ``I think we should stay the course with
sanctions'' against Iraq.
   Gephardt's opposition to a resolution is the first public break
among the Democratic leadership, who said last week that President
Bush would have a better chance of winning congressional approval
for the use of force in the Persian Gulf if the United Nations
first backed such a move.
   House Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash., and Senate Majority Leader
George Mitchell, D-Maine, did not indicate whether they support or
oppose such a resolution.
   As the Senate Armed Services Committee opened hearings Tuesday
on the gulf crisis, Democrats demanded that Bush give Congress the
same opportunity as the United Nations to debate a resolution
authorizing military force.
   ``This U.N. resolution is not a substitute for fully informing
the American people of our own nation's objectives and strategy,''
said committee chairman Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga.
   Today the committee hears from two former chairmen of the Joints
Chiefs of Staff, William Crowe and David C. Jones, and former
Secretary of State Henry Kissinger.
   The hearings stem from Bush's decision to send 200,000
additional troops to the gulf region, a move that increases U.S.
forces to about 430,000 by January and gives the United States an
``offensive military option.''
   Democrats who have been highly critical of Bush's policy shift,
including Nunn, had hoped to question Defense Secretary Dick Cheney
and Gen. Colin Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
   But the administration's top military officials declined to
testify while the Security Council prepares to vote on a resolution
threatening to use ``all necessary means'' to drive Iraq from
Kuwait if it does not leave by January.
   Foley told newly elected House Democrats on Tuesday that the
administration must seek congressional approval for using force
even if Bush wins U.N. approval.
   ``I would personally want to have some assurance from the
administration that no action would be taken prior to this Congress
meeting, or it would be necessary to think seriously about calling
in the previous Congress,'' Foley said.
   Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., said it is ``not enough for
President Bush to go to the United Nations to get approval for the
use of military force in the Persian Gulf. He must also come to
Congress.''
   Another panel member, Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., said it was
``incredible that the president feels the need to obtain U.N.
approval for a U.S. offensive but won't commit himself to seeking
congressional approval for such an operation.''
   Widespread Democratic support for the sanctions was evident as
Democrats indicated the administration has failed to make its case
for military force.
   ``The question is not whether military action is justified. It
is,'' Nunn said. ``The question is whether military action is wise
at this time and in our own national interest.''
   Fighting the tide of criticism, Republican Sen. John McCain of
Arizona declared, ``The issue is not prerogatives, it is
patriotism.''
   Former CIA Director James Schlesinger testified that the United
States believes it will take about a year for international
sanctions against Iraq to take full effect.
   Schlesinger told the panel that was an official estimate, but
the former defense and energy secretary did not indicate the basis
for his statement.
   ``His society (Iraq) is bleeding and it's going to get worse
with the passage of time,'' Schlesinger said. But it may take
somewhat longer for those difficulties to lead Saddam to change his
mind and withdraw from Kuwait, he said.
   Schlesinger said the United States must show tenacity and ``we
must be prepared to stay a year'' in the desert of the Mideast.

   Here are excerpts of testimony Tuesday in the
Senate Ethics Committee hearing on the ``Keating Five.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>Edwin J. Gray, former Federal Home Loan Bank Board chairman,
questioned by committee Special Counsel Robert Bennett.
   </HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Bennett: I want to direct your attention to ... March 6, 1987.
Do you recall having a meeting with Sen. Riegle?
   Gray: In March of 1987, yes, I do. ... After (FHLBB aide) Mary
Ellen Taylor had gone out the door, he pulled me aside and he said,
``You know, there are some senators out West that are very unhappy
about the Bank Board's regulation of Lincoln, and I think you ought
to talk to them.'' ...
   Bennett: Of the five senators who are participating in this
hearing as respondents, who was the first one to raise with you the
subject of a meeting with senators?
   Gray: Sen. Riegle, at that time. ... I protested. I said, ``It's
the same thing all over ... It's the Charlie Keating vendetta
argument, the feud argument.'' ...
   We went back and we sat down for a couple minutes, and I went
through with him how Charles Keating had been making these
accusations for a long time. And I didn't see why I needed to talk
to these senators, that I had the best team in the Federal Home
Loan Bank System out there regulating this institution, I was
confident of that. ... And then we got up and he said, ``Well,
you'll be getting a call.'' ...
   Bennett: Tell us what transpired subsequent to that meeting,
which led up to your going to the meeting April 2nd.
   Gray: Somebody on my staff asked me, told me that I had to go to
a meeting. ... I don't remember who it was. But I had to go up to a
meeting in Sen. DeConcini's office, and that I was to come alone, I
was not to bring staff. ...
   Bennett: Now, have you ever been directed on any other occasion
in your government service not to bring an aide with you?
   Gray: Never. ... I arrived, went to Sen. DeConcini's office.
There were four senators in the room - Sen. DeConcini, Sen. McCain,
Sen. Glenn, and Sen. Cranston. I sat down. Directly across from me
was Sen. DeConcini. ... Sen. DeConcini said, ``Mr. Chairman, we're
here to talk about our friend from Lincoln Savings.'' ...
   Bennett: You recall those specific words being used?
   Gray: Etched in my mind forever. And as he started, Senator
McCain said, ``Now, we don't want to do anything that's improper in
this meeting.'' And I said, ``Well, it's not improper to ask
questions.'' ...
   Bennett: Who was the friend?
   Gray: Charles Keating. ... Then Sen. DeConcini said, ``We're
very concerned about this regulation, this direct investment
regulation of yours.'' He said, ``You know, we're concerned that
it's unconstitutional.'' And he said, ``We'd like you to withdraw
it until we can find out whether it's constitutional.'' He said,
``If you'll do that, we'll get our friend at Lincoln to make more
home loans.'' And I said, ``Well, gosh, if I were to withdraw this
regulation, how would we ever be in a position to find out whether
it was constitutional?'' That actually wasn't the issue; it was a
statutory and not a constitutional issue, but apparently he didn't
know that.
   So I said, ``You know, we've gone through all the administrative
process getting this regulation done. We adopted it, pursuant to
the administrative requirements of the law and, no, I'm not going
to do that. What purpose would that serve?''
   Bennett: Now did Sen. DeConcini ask you to withdraw that on
behalf of the S&amp;L industry in general or S&amp;L institutions in
general?
   Gray: No, he said they were there for their friend at Lincoln.
... I told the senators that I simply could not answer their
questions. I said, ``You know, there are a number of reasons why.
First of all, I really don't want to know anything more than I need
to about Lincoln. ... I particularly don't want to know about this
one any more than necessary, because I don't want it to come
through that I have a particularly unusual interest, extraordinary
interest in this institution.'' ...
   I had been accused repeatedly of having a vendetta and only a
few days before ... Lincoln Savings had petitioned that I recuse
myself from any matter having to do with Lincoln.'' So I said, ``If
my life depended on it, I could not answer all these questions
you're asking me. The only people who can answer these questions
are the people who are regulating the institution out in San
Francisco. You know, you would have to find out from them. I can't
answer your questions.''
   Bennett: As best you can recollect, can you describe ... the
roles of each of the senators at that meeting? ...
   Gray: Sen. DeConcini was host, and every time he said anything
he said ``we'' - ``we'' - ``us'' - ``we.'' I assumed he was
speaking for them.
   Bennett: Did you consider Sen. DeConcini's request of you to
withdraw the regulation to be usual or unusual, proper or improper?
   Gray: Well, I considered it to be improper, of course. ...
Because we had adopted that regulation pursuant to the law that the
Congress of the United States set up for the Bank Board. That was
our job, to adopt regulations to protect the FSLIC, the safety and
soundness of the thrift system.

<HEAD>NASA Panel Says Hubble Scope Maker Ignored Test Failures</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The manufacturer of the Hubble Space Telescope
ignored three test failures and did not consult its own experts in
building the defective $1.5 billion instrument, a NASA
investigation concludes.
   ``There was a surprising lack of participation by optical
experts with experience in the manufacture of large telescopes
during the fabrication phase,'' the investigative board said
Tuesday in its final report.
   The manufacturer, Perkin-Elmer, relied on tests with a single
instrument called a null corrector for grinding the 94.5
inch-diameter mirror and that ``should have alerted knowledgeable
people in Perkin-Elmer and NASA'' to the need for independent
validation, the report said.
   ``There were at least three cases where there was clear evidence
that a problem was developing and it was missed all three times,''
said Dr. Lew Allen, director of the space agency's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., who directed the study.
   Perkin-Elmer, now called Hughes Danbury Optical Systems,
``rationalized away'' any independent measurement because of a
belief that the null corrector was the only device that was
accurate, according to the report.
   Thomas Arconti, spokesman for the Danbury, Conn., firm, said
there would be no comment until officials had read the report.
   The investigators found that Perkin-Elmer technicians in the
Optical Operations Division ``were deeply concerned at the time
that the discrepant optical data might indicate a flaw,'' the
report said. But it added, ``There are no indications that these
concerns were formally expressed outside this division.''
   A similar lack of communication was cited as a contributing
cause to the Challenger space shuttle accident in 1986.
   The Hubble report said the management structure at Perkin-Elmer
raised ``a strong block'' against communication between people
doing hands-on work and higher-level experts.
   The telescope, launched last April from the space shuttle
Discovery, cannot be focused properly because its
94.5-inch-diameter primary mirror is too flat in the center.
   Allen said blame belonged equally to Perkin-Elmer and to NASA.
   ``Perkin-Elmer should not have allowed a situation that
inhibited communications to exist,'' Allen told a news conference.
``NASA had every right to expect that Perkin-Elmer would have done
a better job with this. They had competency and experience in
optics and NASA should have expected more professional performance
than they actually got.''
   But, he added, ``It is fundamentally NASA's responsibility as a
government agency to get this done; NASA should have been aware of
what was happening at Perkin-Elmer.''
   He said one change resulting from the Challenger accident
investigation is that methods for better communications are in
place both in NASA and among its contractors. The Hubble telescope
was built 10 years ago.
   The investigators determined early in their probe, and
reiterated in their final report, that an optical test used in the
manufacturing process was not set up correctly and ``thus, the
surface was polished into the wrong shape.''
   Perkin-Elmer design scientists, as well as management for the
company and for NASA, failed to follow the fabrication process
``with reasonable diligence'' and were unaware of the flaws, the
report said. It did not name any individuals.
   Some of the reasons Allen cited were severe cost and schedule
problems, which he said caused management to pay attention to other
problems. Also, he said, a number of review mechanisms did not go
deep enough.
   Dr. Lennard Fisk, NASA's chief scientist, said he was certain
the Hubble's problems, which include solar panels that shake the
spacecraft whenever it passes from sunlight into darkness and vice
versa, can be fixed by visiting astronauts in 1993. He put the
price tag at about $50 million.
   NASA plans to put corrective lenses on the cameras. Even without
the corrections, the Hubble has returned some spectacular pictures
from space, many with better resolution than ever seen by
ground-based cameras.

   Business is bad in Jordan, one of the
countries hardest hit by the Persian Gulf crisis. But food is
abundant and promises of aid are trickling in from abroad.
   The Hashemite kingdom, sandwiched between Iraq and Israel, has
survived the turbulence of the Middle East since it was created in
1921. But many analysts consider Jordan's current predicament its
most perilous yet.
   ``God help us if there's a war,'' said Fahed al-Fanek, a
prominent independent economist.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, who faces an international army
opposed to his Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, could drag Israel into
the conflagration, exposing Jordan. The oil that comes exclusively
from Iraq to meet Jordan's domestic needs of 60,000 barrels a day
would be cut off if war broke out.
   The country would probably be flooded with refugees from Iraq
and Kuwait, as it was in August and September when more than
735,000 refugees passed through. Many had to be fed and accomodated
until they could be repatriated.
   Prices of imported food, including meat, have increased
considerably. But fruit and vegetables grown in the Jordan valley
have become cheaper because they are not being exported to Persian
Gulf countries anymore.
   The Finance Ministry estimates that Jordan has lost $2 billion
in revenue this year because of the gulf crisis. With a debt
already at $8.3 billion before August, such losses could be
catastrophic.
   Fanek said Jordan will be able to keep its economy afloat with
$1 billion in aid a year.
   But so far, it has only been promised $115 million by Germany,
$250 million by Japan, $20 million by France and almost $19 million
from the Netherlands as compensation for abiding by the
U.N.-imposed trade embargo on Iraq.
   The European Community also has promised aid, but the amount has
not yet been set.
   King Hussein's refusal to join the anti-Saddam coalition and his
advocacy of a negotiated ``Arab slution'' has stirred widespread
resentment in the United States, Europe and the Persian Gulf, where
Jordan has traditionally found support.
   Amman hesitated to implement U.N.-ordered sanctions on trade
with Iraq, until August its main trading partner. The government
came under fire by the international community and was accused of
dragging its feet in pressuring Saddam, a longtime ally of King
Hussein.
   Oil-rich gulf countries opposing Iraq cut all trade with the
kingdom to pressure it to join the anti-Saddam alliance. The Saudis
cut off oil supplies, leaving Jordan no option but to truck it in
from Iraq.
   Fanek said Jordan's losses have so far not yet seriously
affected the kingdom's 3 million people.
   But he stressed: ``With the current stalemate, we may start
seeing shortages in two months' time.''
   Jordanian companies have maintained production levels and are
planning for what they hope will be a limited disruption.
   ``That's why they haven't fired workers yet,'' Fanek said.
   But how long they can do that is questionable because they can't
export much of their merchandise. The U.N.-imposed trade embargo on
Iraq has brought Jordan's only port, Aqaba, to a virtual
standstill.
   The government estimates Jordan's export losses since August at
$440 million.
   Many businesses are reporting a drop in sales of up to 60
percent. Supermarket manager Ibrahim Darakjian said business has
suffered because the store has to close early under a government
energy-saving plan.
   The people most affected are the Jordanians who worked in Kuwait
before Saddam troops invaded.
   The government estimates that 300,000 Jordanians, most of them
of Palestinian origin, were in Kuwait before the invasion. At least
half have come back to look for jobs in a country where, by Fanek's
estimation, unemployment is about 20 percent.
   Most of these people were remitting an estimated $800 million a
year, two-thirds of Jordan's foreign currency reserves.
   Those who kept their savings in Kuwaiti currency became
penniless overnight. Iraq decreed the Kuwaiti dinar, once one of
the Middle East's strongest currencies, equivalent to the Iraqi
dinar.
   Iraqi currency is not convertible. On the thinly-traded free
market it was worth about one-tenth of the Kuwaiti dinar before
Aug. 2, and less now.
   The government estimates that Jordanian workers lost as much as
$8 billion in property and savings.

   U.S. troops tired of waiting in
the desert welcome the possibility of a U.N. resolution setting a
January deadline for Iraq to pull out of Kuwait.
   ``The sooner they take immediate action, the sooner this'll get
over and we can all go home,'' Air Force Sgt. Bill Hubbard, 21, of
Tarpon Springs, Fla., said Tuesday.
   Some servicemen who arrived in Saudi Arabia soon after President
Bush ordered troops to defend it on Aug. 7 said the United Nations
should have set a deadline much earlier to prevent Saddam Hussein's
forces from destroying Kuwait.
   ``He's been in Kuwait so long now, he's just raping the
country,'' said Air Force Tech. Sgt. Ricky Presley, 32, of Little
Rock, Ark., who arrived Aug. 16.
   ``I think we should never have let him do that in the first
place. I think it (a deadline) should have happened a while back,''
he said.
   Capt. Ali, 34, a Kuwaiti army tank commander waiting to go on
maneuvers about 40 miles from the Kuwaiti border, also believes a
deadline should have been set ``as soon as they attacked Kuwait.''
   ``I don't know why they are waiting ... We were ready to go
months ago,'' said Ali, who refused to give his last name to
protect his wife, parents and four children still in Kuwait.
   1st Lt. Bruce Lake, 29, of Newport News, Va., a tank platoon
commander who has spent more than three months in the desert, said
he and his troops from the 69th Armored Regiment of the 24th
Infantry Division would be delighted with a deadline.
   ``But I don't think it'll fly ... Just from my reading of the
situation and listening to the news ... I haven't sensed that much
unity and we still seem to be leading the way,'' he said.
   ``Either an operation or a go-home date is going to boost
morale,'' he said. ``We feel that we have the forces we need over
here to do the job and push this guy out if need be, and to go
home.''
   The U.N. Security Council is expected to meet Thursday to
consider a draft resolution setting a Jan. 15 deadline for Iraq to
withdraw from Kuwait, restore its government and release all
foreign hostages.
   Lt. Col. Robert McCann, 42, of West Hope, N.D., said
international support is important ``because in today's world no
one nation can just do what they want to. That's why we're here.''
   Air Force Staff Sgt. Jim White, 39, Fairfield, Calif., said U.N.
support of the multinational force is essential to prevent similar
aggression elsewhere.
   ``How many times in the past has the United States been the
almost sole bearer of international disputes? Now, I feel if we
don't come through on this one, it's going to have a domino
effect,'' he said.
   As they stepped off a C-5 Galaxy transport after a 36-hour
flight from Travis Air Force Base in California, some of the newest
reinforcements for Operation Desert Shield were equally hopeful.
   ``We got to bring this thing to a head one way or the other,''
said Capt. Clarence Ryan, 40, of Laurel, Md., who was leading a
unit of cooks and firefighters from the 60th Military Air Wing at
Travis. ``The long waiting game, will it pay off? We don't know,
but the longer we wait, the more Kuwait is being torn up.''
   After two months with a combat unit in the desert, Staff Sgt.
Douglas Barton, 40, of San Antonio said he got tired of waiting and
decided to end his 20-year Army career.
   ``I'm not going to sit in the desert for no reason. Time for me
to go,'' he said as he waited for a flight home.

   Lawyers, witnesses, law clerks and even a
pair of star-struck judges clustered at the courthouse windows to
get a glimpse of Dennis Hopper during filming of a TV movie in
which he plays a drug informant.
   ``I think I'll go down there and mill around. Maybe I'll get
discovered,'' Judge Ronald Loumiet joked Monday.
   Judge Thomas Porteous Jr. joined Loumiet at a window overlooking
the parking lot where Hopper was filming the movie about Barry
Seal, a smuggler turned federal informant who was slain in 1986
before he could testify.
   Hopper is known for such films as ``Rebel Without a Cause,''
``Blue Velvet'' and ``Easy Rider'' - in which he also played a
druggie.
   ``I was going to direct a picture, but I couldn't find anyone to
play the part of Seal,'' Hopper said. ``Then HBO asked me to act in
it. The man had a very interesting life.''

   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) - Rock star Sting says his Virgin Forest
Foundation had collected $1.3 million to help create Brazil's
biggest Indian reserve.
   Sting said Tuesday he came to Brazil to meet with the
foundation's leaders and account for donations raised since the
group was founded in 1989.
   The foundation seeks to join five national parks to form a
30-million-acre Indian reserve. Sting said the money would also be
used for education, health and Indian cultural projects.
   Foundation president Olimpio Serra said the donations had been
deposited in a foreign bank account and will be transferred to
Brazil's National Indian Foundation if the government authorizes
the reserve.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Starring opposite Cher in ``Mermaids.'' Dating
heartthrob Johnny Depp. Playing Jerry Lee Lewis' child bride in
``Great Balls of Fire.'' Hollywood glamor, no? No, says actress
Winona Ryder.
   ``It's weird when I hear that term associated with me. ... It's
like I'm playing a character when I get to be glamorous,'' she said
in the December issue of Vogue. ``I can't take it seriously,
because in real life I feel just like a nimrod.''
   Easing Ryder's insecurity is her relationship with Depp, her
co-star in the upcoming ``Edward Scissorhands,'' but she said his
``Winona Forever'' tattoo shouldn't be construed as a signal
they'll marry any time soon.
   ``We're having a good time being boyfriend and girlfriend right
now,'' she said. ``I'm pretty young, and I don't need any added
pressure.''

   SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) - Saxophonist Branford Marsalis says a
lot of people have no idea what he's all about musically, focusing
on his popular successes rather than his true love - jazz.
   ``They live in a different social environment than that in which
it was conceived,'' Marsalis said.
   His latest album, ``Crazy People Music,'' features
straight-ahead jazz selections in the tradition of Charlie Parker
and John Coltrane.
   Audiences tend to recognize him from his work outside jazz and
expect him to play tunes from the soundtrack to Spike Lee's film
``Mo' Better Blues,'' or songs he played with rock star Sting.
   ``We used to have people coming to the shows and asking me to
play Sting songs,'' Marsalis said. ``They never heard of jazz
before.
   ``Now, I start getting a lot of people saying, `Play that ``Mo'
Better.''' We don't play that stuff. That's not what our band's
about.''

<HEAD>Yeutter Urges New Awareness of European Role in Farm Trade</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union buys a lot of U.S. grain, but
Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter says policies of the European
Community also have had a major effect on the incomes of American
farmers.
  Yeutter said Tuesday that Russia is a huge and valued customer
of the United States and could become even more valuable in the
1990s.
   But Yeutter said that ``what has happened in the last decade
outside the Soviet Union has had a greater impact - a far greater
impact - on farm income here in the United States, and we need to
understand that.''
   Simply in terms of grain programs, he said, EC policies have
resulted in the shifting of 50 million metric tons of grain in
international trade.
   ``A decade or so ago the European Community was an importer of
between 20 and 30 million tons of grain per year,'' Yeutter said.
``Now the community is an exporter of between 20 and 30 million
tons of grain per year.''
   Yeutter said this shifting has happened because of ``distortive
practices'' followed by the EC in its farm policy structure. And
that has meant tougher times for American farmers in international
markets.
   Next week world trade negotiators will reconvene in Brussels in
hopes of concluding the Uruguay Round of talks aimed at reforming
global trading rules under the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade.
   Agriculture has been an obstacle in the talks, and Yeutter is
pessimistic about reaching an agreement.
   Yeutter and U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills recently
visited European leaders to urge compromises on agricultural issues
confronting Uruguay Round negotiators.
   ``I came back very pessimistic about the outlook, and I'm still
pessimistic,'' Yeutter said. ``It seems to me the position of the
European Community is so far from that of, essentially, the rest of
the world that I see no way to bridge that gap in the few days that
remain.''
   Japan, which wants to continue protecting its domestic farmers
by banning rice imports, is ``the only country that is at all
supportive'' of the EC position, he told the Agriculture
Department's annual outlook conference.
   The EC members are Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece,
Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Britain, Spain and
Portugal.
   Yeutter said the United States wants a 75 percent reduction in
trade-distortive internal supports and a 90 percent cut in export
subsidies over 10 years.
   The EC has offered a 30 percent cutback in internal supports,
based on 1986 levels, but has not made any specific commitment to
reducing export subsidies. Yeutter said nearly half of the 30
percent reduction in EC supports has occurred since 1986, leaving
only about 15 percent to be carried out in the next 10 years.
   Further, he said, the EC has not offered any net gains for those
countries wanting more market access to the bloc.
   If the talks fail and everyone goes home without liberalizing
global trading rules, it will mean a full-blown reappraisal of U.S.
policies.
   ``We'll have to determine how best to protect our own
interests,'' Yeutter said. ``In essence, we'll have to determine
how to get the most bang for the buck in a more confrontational
environment in international trade in agriculture, and perhaps in
international trade in all the other spheres of economic activity
as well.''
   Yeutter said he hoped such a gloomy development does not emerge
and that ``we're certainly going to go to Brussels next week with
an open mind.''
   But he added: ``We're not going to negotiate with ourselves in
Brussels next week. We're not going to come back with an agreement
that we do not believe is in the best interests of this country.
And I'm certainly not going to come back with an agreement that I
do not believe is in the best interest of American agriculture.''

   WASHINGTON (AP) - A new forecast by the Agriculture Department
says the value of U.S. agriculturaleexports is expected to drop 4
percent this fiscal year to $38.5 billion.
   Export value rose to a nine-year high of more than $40.1 billion
in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30.
   The volume of shipments also will drop 6 percent to around 139.5
million metric tons, as sales of corn and other coarse grains
decline, the department's Economic Research Service said Tuesday.
   Although the decline in 1991 had been indicated by the agency
for some time, it was the first official forecast to include
specific values and quantities.
   ``Lower world grain trade is expected following larger harvests
by traditional grain importers, and the U.S. share of world grain
trade is expected to fall following increased competitor
production,'' the report said.
   Corn exports will drop largely because of a one-third cutback in
the Soviet Union's corn import needs. Also, the report said, larger
1990-91 world wheat output has brought sharply lower wheat prices.
   However, it added, higher prices are forecast for soybeans and
soybean meal, which will offset declines in the volume of
shipments.
   U.S. agricultural imports were projected to drop slightly to $22
billion in 1990-91 from a record $22.5 billion last year.

<HEAD>FDA to Consider Safety of High-Tech Foods</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration will take its
first look at the safety of foods that are genetically altered to
enhance certain qualities, such as freshness.
   Although the agency questions its legal authority to regulate
genetically altered fruits, vegetables and other food crops, the
FDA said Tuesday it will grant a California company's request for
review of a well-known ``marker'' gene to produce genetically
engineered tomato, cotton and rapeseed plants.
   ``Even though we don't have legal authority, people are going to
ask us, `Is it safe?''' said FDA spokesman Bill Grigg. He said the
agency may decide it has jurisdiction over food plants whose
genetic makeup has been manipulated.
   Gene altering is used to create or enhance specific traits in
foods. The Davis, Calif.-based company, Calgene Inc., wants to sell
a tomato that keeps longer off the vine, a cotton plant that is
more resistant to herbicides, and a rapeseed plant that has a lower
fatty acid content.
   The rapeseed yields industrial oils and canola, which is popular
among diet-conscious consumers.
   Calgene and environmentalists say FDA has regulation authority
and it is time to prepare the public for the arrival of high-tech
food.
   ``This genetic engineering in this context falls under their
authority,'' said Roger H. Salquist, chairman and chief executive
officer of Calgene.
   ``We want FDA to make sure ahead of time that we're not
experimenting with consumers,'' said Douglas Hopkins, senior
attorney for the Environmental Defense Fund.
   ``We see this as a positive development that Calgene is pressing
the FDA,'' Hopkins said. His New York-based environmental groups
says the FDA must act because many firms are ready to enter the
market.
   Both men agree that the foreign genes constitute food
``additives'' that give the FDA jurisdiction because foods with
additives are subject to pre-market testing.
   But Salquist and Hopkins disagree over whether the FDA is
prepared to do the job.
   Environmentalists like Hopkins say the agency has ignored the
issue and now must act in a vacuum. Salquist and his industry's
trade group, the Industrial Biotechnology Association, say that
guidelines they helped develop will guide the FDA.
   ``In order to review something, you have to have something to
review,'' said Salquist, who said he wanted the process to be as
open as possible so the public can understand the issues.
   The company said in a statement, ``The approval of the `kan'
gene by the FDA will expedite and simplify the future approval of
genetically engineered fod crops.''
   Known as a marker, the kan gene is widely used in biotechnology
to identify and track altered cells. It has been used on humans in
clinical tests using genetically engineered cells.
   Defense fund biologist Rebecca J. Goldburg said the ability to
shift genetic material from plant to plant, or between plants and
animals, vastly expands the number of traits that can be
``incorporated into food.''
   But the added traits, she said, could include poison substances.
In addition, the group says the gene is resistant to the
antibiotics kanamycin and neomycin.
   However, the company says the amounts ``would not detectably
increase the number of antibiotic resistant bacteria'' in the body,
and the antibiotics aren't that widely used.
   Richard D. Godown, president of the Industrial Biotechnology
Association, said about 100 genetically altered food products are
in various stages of development.
   ``The whole industry is not more than 15 years old,'' he said.
``Most companies are less than five years old. This is the first
time we've gotten to this stage of development.''

   Hundreds of refugees seeking asylum in this
country are being needlessly held in government detention centers,
a private group says.
   The Lawyers Committee for Human Rights wants to expand a pilot
project run by federal immigration officials in which 200 refugees
were paroled into their communities in New York, Miami, Los Angeles
and San Francisco.
   Most of the 200 appeared promptly for immigration hearings and
have not disappeared, the group said in a report released Tuesday.
   All were required to post a $500 bond as part of the agreement
under the program, which began in May.
   Some 2,000 asylum-seekers are being detained by the Immigration
and Naturalization Service while the government decides whether to
send them back to their home countries. Detention typically lasts
from nine months to a year.
   Among the participants in the pilot project, said the group, was
a 23-year-old woman whose cousins were killed by guerrillas in El
Salvador. She spent over a month in a Los Angeles detention
facility.
   Another was a 29-year-old surgery professor from China who
treated wounded pro-democracy demonstrators. He was held in a Miami
detention center for three months.
   ``Hundreds of refugees applying for asylum in the United States
are unnecessarily detained,'' the committee said. It sent a letter
to INS Commissioner Gene McNary asking for expansion of the
project.
   The INS said, however, that expansion would be premature at this
point.
   ``So far we like'' the program, said INS spokesman Duke Austin.
But he said that it has not yet gone ``through a full cycle of
events'' and needs to last for its full, scheduled 18 months before
final evaluation.
   Parolees have agreed to report voluntarily for deportation if
immigration officers determine they fail to qualify for asylum.
   ``We'll wait to see what happens'' on the question of whether
they disappear, Austin said.
   He questioned how much the program could be expanded, calling
the 200 the ``best-case situations - They've got work, got an
address, they don't appear to be abscondee types.''
   Under a 1982 INS regulation, aliens arriving without required
travel documents are detained unless they are found to pose no risk
of absconding and can get a relative or sponsor in this country to
file a petition on their behalf.
   Most aliens seeking asylum are unable to meet those
requirements, says Helton, who lobbied the INS to launch the pilot
project.

   Madonna gave herself a stigmata in her ``Like a

get-out-the-vote commercial and told Arsenio Hall she likes to be
spanked.
   But this time she's gone too far.
   Her new video for ``Justify My Love'' - which includes
portrayals of Madonna and her boyfriend's fantasies of voyeurism,
bisexuality, cross-dressing and mild sadomasochism - has been
rejected by MTV as too risque.
   The video, which was to premiere Saturday, shows Madonna and a
lover - played by real-life boyfriend Tony Ward - in a steamy
encounter i a Paris hotel.
   Clips of the video have already aired on MTV to plug the
station's 48-hour ``Madonnathon'' this weekend. But executives at
the cable music station got a look at the entire video Monday and
decided it was too hot to handle.
   ``We respect her work as an artist and think she makes great
videos. This one is not for us,'' MTV said in a statement.
   Madonna said in today's The New York Times, ``MTV has been good
to me and they know their audience. If it's too strong for them, I
understand that.''

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Bush Tours the Globe as Economy Weakens at Home</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush, hopscotching across four
continents in less than two weeks, spent time today at a spot he
hasn't seen much of lately. The White House.
   But not for long.
   Bush leaves again Sunday for a week-long tour of South America.
And after that he plans at least one foreign trip a month through
April.
   As the U.S. economy weakens at home, Bush is spending more and
more time overseas. And, like Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev, the president is finding that he often is better
received abroad than at home.
   In his recent travels, Bush has met with dozens of world leaders
as he seeks to build support for a United Nations Security Council
resolution authorizing military force against Iraq.
   International diplomacy often makes strange bedfellows. As Bush
seeks to build his coalition, he and his lieutenants have been
conferring with unlikely allies.
   That included a controversial meeting last Friday in Geneva with
Syrian President Hafez Assad. The United States still considers
Syria to be a nation that supports terrorism, with an abysmal
record on human rights.
   Meanwhile, Secretary of State James A. Baker III met in Paris
with Chinese officials to discuss the U.N. resolution.
   China, a permanent member of the Security Council with veto
powers, remains under U.S. sanctions imposed in the aftermath of
China's bloody crackdown on dissidents in Beijing's Tiananmen
Square massacre in 1989.
   Secret meetings between White House national security adviser
Brent Scowcroft and Chinese officials last year caused considerable
controversy, because of a ban Bush imposed on high-level
U.S.-Chinese contacts.
   That ban is still in place. But Baker's overtures to the Chinese
caused hardly a ripple.
   Furthermore, administration officials say they expect Baker to
confer with Cuban officials in New York later this week on the
Persian Gulf crisis. Cuba is a member of the Security Council,
although it is not one of the five permanent members with veto
power.
   Bush has defended his contacts with leaders of regimes that have
previously been scorned by the United States.
   Of his meeting with Assad, Bush said, ``I have no problem
sitting down with him for this common objective.''
   For Bush, the recent spurt of international diplomacy may seem
like easy duty after the two months he spent crisscrossing the
country campaigning for Republican candidates who often openly
criticized his tax and budget policies.
   Like Gorbachev, Bush is rejoicing in the cheers he gets from
foreign audiences even as the U.S. economy sours.
   Bush, basking in a U.S.-Mexican lovefest Tuesday as he wrapped
up a two-day meeting with Mexican President Carlos Salinas de
Gortari in Monterrey, was reminded of the recent statistics showing
the U.S. economy teetering on the brink of a recession.
   He conceded recession at home could damage prospects for a
free-trade pact by increasing protectionist pressures in Congress.
   ``As the giant U.S. economy slows down - it may slow down even
more - it concerns me that some in our country and some in our
Congress might turn inward to what you properly label as a
protectionist mode,'' Bush told a Mexican businessman who raised
concerns about U.S. protectionism.
   Still, that was just a temporary note of discord for Bush on a
tour that has brought him before the biggest audiences of his life.
   When he was in Prague, Czechoslovakia, last week, Bush addressed
a crowd of perhaps 200,000 people in historic Wenceslas Square. On
Monday, in Monterrey, he encountered over 35,000 at a town plaza
rally.
   ``Somos una familia, we are one family,'' he told cheering
Mexicans in Monterrey.
   There was no one there to remind him that he'd reneged on his
``no new taxes'' pledge, that Congress had just enacted a difficult
five-year $500 billion package of spending cuts and tax increases,
that the nation at home was slipping into a recession, that
Republicans had lost seats in the midterm elections, or that the
Democratic-controlled Congress was skeptical of his Persian Gulf
policies.
   No, it was all glitter and pomp for Bush as he raised a
champagne glass on Tuesday at a state luncheon, offering his toast
``to Mexico. God bless you all. And thank you for a wonderful
visit.''

   The Food and Drug Administration is being
required to release results from animal tests of silicone gel
breast implants that critics say would document a wide array of
medical problems.
   U.S. District Judge Stanley Sporkin ruled Tuesday in a Freedom
of Information Act lawsuit that Public Citizen Health Research
Group is entitled to see the results of animal tests Dow Corning
conducted over a span of 20 years, and to see a list of complaints
about the product from women.
   The material was submitted to FDA in conjunction with its
regulation of the implants.
   Dow Corning, a joint venture of Dow Chemical Co. and Corning
Glass Inc., has been a major supplier of silicone gel breast
implants since the 1960s.
   More than 2 million women have the breast implants. In 1988,
there were 130,000 implanted in women following surgery for breast
cancer.
   Public Citizen, founded by consumer activist Ralph Nader, filed
the lawsuit in 1989 after it unsuccessfully petitioned the FDA to
ban silicone breast implants on grounds they can cause allergic
reactions, tissue swelling and damage to internal organs.
   The suit was filed after a news leak from the agency that some
of that some tests showed an increased incidence of cancer at the
site of silicone implants in animals, said Dr. Sidney Wolfe,
director of the research group.

<TEXT>
   Brown University women are scrawling the
names of alleged rapists on the bathroom walls in a guerrilla
attempt to get the school to do more about sexual assault among
students.
   Brown spokesman Robert Reichley called the women ``Magic Marker
terrorists'' and said they face expulsion if caught.
   Students said the graffiti is aimed at getting the Ivy League
school to take stronger action against so-called date and
acquaintance rape.
   ``It's not an easy thing for a woman to take this action and I
don't think anyone was taking this lightly or doing this
vindictively or maliciously,'' said Lisa Billowitz of Brown Against
Sexual Assault and Harassment, or BASH.
   ``It was an act of desperation in an attempt to get Brown to act
responsibly and provide us with a system where we can air these
grievances publicly as opposed to bathroom walls.''
   The list of about 30 names began appearing more than a month
ago. It has stirred strong emotions at the 7,000-student school and
focused attention on the issue of college men forcing dates or
other women they know into having sex.
   ``It's a controlling force of conversation,'' said student
Stephanie Cooper, 19.
   The names are based on allegations from victims or their
friends, students said. It was unclear how many of the women, if
any, have filed charges. Students said women on campus lack
confidence the allegations will be handled effectively.
   Court proceedings can take years and a victim could ``be sitting
next to her rapist in classes for a few years,'' said Jenn David,
21, a member of the university's disciplinary council and a
founding member of BASH.
   Janitors have scrubbed the walls clean, but the names keep
reappearing. ``Keep this list going strong - warn others!'' a
message on one wall said. Women also write words of support and
advice, usually unsigned.
   Adam Gillitt, whose name appeared on a wall, wrote the student
newspaper, The Brown Daily Herald, proclaiming his innocence.
   ``Rape is a violent crime that takes away the voices and the
choices of the victims. So too do anonymous accusations without
factual bases take away the options of the accused,'' he wrote.
   One woman told The Providence Journal-Bulletin the list helped
her meet with other alleged victims of the same attacker.
``Together, we're thinking of pressing charges,'' she said. Her
name was not given.
   No sexual assault cases have come before the disciplinary
council, but it has considered cases of racial and anti-homosexual
assaults, and sexual harassment, David said.
   She blamed the school's lack of a written procedure for dealing
with rape and said ``the deans were insensitive - blaming the
victim'' and steering them away from taking action.
   ``They had the rapists write a letter of apology to the victim
or attend a three-hour alcohol counseling session,'' she said.
   Rape statistics at Brown were unavailable. The school began
compiling figures last week, officials said.
   ``We are proud of our efforts but know that they alone cannot
correct one of society's greatest flaws,'' Dean of Student Life
John Robinson wrote in the campus paper, while admitting that
Brown's disciplinary system, designed in the 1960s, has become
outdated.
   A sexual assault task force of students and administrators was
formed last summer, but some students accused the school of acting
too slowly.
   Some also want the school to appoint a dean of women's concerns,
draft a sexual assault policy, improve security and give officials
sensitivity training.
   The rising militancy has disturbed some on campus.
   ``I think the idea of a personal catharsis and a woman trying to
work through her feelings are perfectly legitimate, but I don't
think a man should be able to be slandered, and that is the crux,''
said Cooper.
   Reichley, the university spokesman, said the school has written
the men on the list inviting them to file complaints.
   ``I do not think that accusations of such a serious crime, made
anonymously, can be described as anything but striking at the heart
of the American judicial system of innocent until proven guilty,''
he said.

<HEAD>New Plastic Batteries Could Fuel Electric Cars</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CECI CONNOLLY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The race is on to perfect a plastic battery the
size of a playing card that would make electric cars an attractive
alternative to gasoline-powered vehicles, scientists say.
   Interest is so great, they say, electric automobiles will be
streaming down America's highways by the end of the decade.
   ``It's a matter of time,'' said Duward Shriver, a professor at
Northwestern University.
   Electric cars use no gasoline and emit no carbon monoxide,
making them attractive in a world worried about pollution and
nervous about the Persian Gulf crisis cutting off oil. However,
electric cars need several batteries to cover long distances
without recharging, and standard auto batteries are heavy and
bulky.
   The solution may be the card-sized plastic battery. Scientists
here for a symposium say that the technology is available and that
such a battery could be developed within a few years, ushering in
the mass use of electric cars.
   ``We're trying to replace batteries of a traditional kind with a
battery of a much less traditional kind,'' said Mark Ratner, a
Northwestern University chemistry professor who received an award
this week from the Materials Research Society for his work with
plastics.
   General Motors Corp. plans to manufacture an electric car, but
it would require 32 standard lead-acid car batteries, said
spokeswoman Toni Simonetti. ``It certainly takes up a lot of real
estate in the car,'' she admitted.
   Ratner said the lead-acid battery is heavy and somewhat
dangerous because it gives off toxic substances. But batteries made
out of polymers, or plastics, are light, don't pollute and present
few if any dangers, he said.
   Other uses of polymer batteries include portable computers and
``smart'' windows, with panes that change color to absorb or
reflect heat depending on energy needs, he said.
   Experts predict foreign countries or the U.S. government, rather
than Detroit, will be the first to use vehicles with polymer
batteries.
   ``The French, Canadians, Japanese - their governments have
pushed more,'' Ratner said. ``They were ecologically conscious a
little before we were.''
   Still, scientists here said they are encouraged by external
forces that have made new batteries a higher priority. After nine
years working quietly in polymer labs, Ratner said he has been
deluged with inquiries since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2 and the
price of oil became a national preoccupation again.
   Stringent air-quality regulations enacted in California also are
speeding up polymer battery experiments. Under law, 2 percent of
all cars sold by 1998 in California must be electric-powered.
   ``From the standpoint of city pollution, the standards in
California almost force electric vehicles,'' Shriver said.
   In the short run, the purpose for electric cars is to cut
pollution, said spokesman Jerry Martin of California's Air
Resources Board.
   But ``as technology improves, there will be more advantages,''
he said. ``They will be cheaper, virtually silent and for urban
driving, the vehicles can meet the needs.''

<TEXT>
   Americans set a long-distance calling record
this week that broke the one set the day after last year's San
Francisco earthquake.
   American Telephone and Telegraph said Tuesday it has only
theories on why 148.4 million long-distance calls were made on its
lines Monday.
   On Oct. 18, 1989, the day after the San Francisco earthquake,
AT&amp;T handled 144.7 million long-distance calls, said spokesman Herb
Linnen. On an average day, the company handles 115 million to 120
million calls.
   ``Traditionally, the Monday after the Thanksgiving weekend is
busy, although there has never been one like this,'' Linnen said.
``It was the busiest calling day in the history of AT&amp;T.''
   Linnen speculated that people were trying to catch up on
business, or perhaps discussing the possibility of war with Iraq.
   But then there were a lot of calls to toll-free ``800'' numbers,
and that could mean people were doing more Christmas shopping by
phone, he said.
   AT&amp;T handles 70 percent or more of the nation's long-distance
calls.

<HEAD>U.S. Wine Sales Boom; Japan Best Customer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. wine exports are booming and Japan is the
best customer, says the Department of Agriculture.
   Farm exports from this country are dropping but sales of wine
have gone up 377 percent since 1985. For the first six months of
this year they topped $51 million, up 19 percent over last year.
   Japanese wine drinkers took one bottle out of every four.
   The December issue of ``Agexporter,'' an official monthly,
quoted Jeff Hansen, representative of a big California wine
company, as saying that Japanese have a bias toward French and
other European wines.
   ``Yet Japan is one of the great success stories of the U.S. wine
industry,'' he went on.
   ``Sales there have increased from $3.2 million in 1985 to $22.3
million in 1989... The two top wine brands in Japan are U.S. wines
bottled specifically for the Japanese market.''
   Winegrowing countries such as France and Germany are harder to
crack, but he pointed out that the French know their wines and that
makes sales easier. Germany has more potential as a customer, he
added.

<HEAD>Pakistani Sees More Family Planning in Islam</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Politicians in Islam are sometimes lukewarm
about family planning because they fear opposition from religious
leaders and people in Moslem countries are less excited by the
issue than Americans, says a pioneer of the movement.
   Imtiaz Kamal of The Pathfinder Fund in Pakistan sees growing
popular support for family planning in Islam, citing the grand
mufti of Jordan and religious figures in Iran. The Koran, Islam's
holy book, says nothing about family planning one way or another,
she added Tuesday in a meeting sponsored by the U.S. Agency for
International Development.
   The agency has a major family planning program in the Third
World, but does not promote abortion.
   She emphasized wide differences in Islam.
   ``In some Moslem countries females are liberated, as in
Turkey,'' she said. ``In some countries they have to cover their
bodies entirely, as in Yemen. But some countries have topless
beaches - and remember who gave you belly-dancing.''
   Ms. Kamal said men as well as women should be brought into
family planning programs.

<HEAD>Newly Treatment Plant to Turn Radioactive Waste into Glass</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AIKEN, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Radioactive waste from nearly four decades of
nuclear weapons production at the Savannah River complex will be
crystallized into glass logs at a new plant that cost $930 million
to build.
   Converting the liquid waste into a solid will boost storage
safety by eliminating the chance of leaks from deteriorating steel
containers, Deputy Energy Secretary W. Henson Moore said at
dedication ceremonies Tuesday.
   ``For all those years all we did is store waste in tanks,''
Moore said. ``Today, we begin a concrete solution. No more talking,
no more planning. Instead, a real solution to a real problem.''
   French scientists pioneered the process, known as vitrifaction.
At Savannah River, the most radioactive waste will be converted
into 2-by-10-foot cylinders of black glass.
   Operated by remote control, the plant will blend radioactive
waste and powdered glass, then cook the mixture at 2,100 degrees
Fahrenheit to produce the glass cylinders at the rate of one every
18 hours.
   It will take about 15 years to turn all the waste into glass,
officials said. Nearly 6,900 canisters will be made and will be
stored in a honeycomb arrangement in a building shielded by five
feet of concrete.
   Two years of tests with non-radioactive material will precede
any work with nuclear waste.
   Researchers spent $400 million developing the plant, which will
cost $300 million a year to operate. Construction began in 1983.
   Unlike most of the nuclear site's other facilities, the glass
plant provoked little opposition. State politicians support it and
environmental groups are not fighting it.
   Since Savannah River opened in 1952, it has accumulated 34
million gallons of radioactive waste. Leaks in some of its 51
underground tanks have contaminated surrounding soil.
   ``We took advantage of nuclear power without being able to take
care of the waste - what some people have called the rear end of
the nuclear industry,'' said Rep. Butler Derrick, D-S.C. ``For the
first time we have made a serious effort to deal with a serious
waste problem, and we have spent almost $1 billion.''
   The Energy Department owns Savannah River and Westinghouse
Savannah River Co. operates it. Its three nuclear generators were
shut down about two years ago for safety reasons.
   The new plant will treat about 7 percent of Savannah River's
most radioactive waste. The less radioactive waste will go to a
separate facility, where it will be mixed with cement and other
ingredients.
   On Sept. 30, officials began pouring the first batch of that
mixture into a 600-foot vault.

<TEXT>
   For years, the Saudis have defended
Mecca and Medina against possible attack by pro-Iranian Shiite
Moslem zealots. Now they fear that Islam's holiest shrines are
threatened by Iraq.
   The Saudis are preparing to confront possible terrorism linked
to the stand-off with Saddam Hussein when this year's annual hajj,
or pilgrimage, begins in June.
   ``The Saudi leadership is prepared to repel evil and harm, and
has taken precautionary measures to deal with anything that might
undermine the security of pilgrims,'' Interior Minister Prince
Nayef bin Abdel-Aziz said recently.
   The Saudis are tight-lipped about security precautions in Mecca
and Medina, where non-Moslems are banned. But travelers reported an
increase in the number of security personnel and more intensive
identity checks.
   Prince Mohammed bin Faisal bin Turki, who heads the Islamic
Department at the Saudi Embassy in Washington but is currently in
Riyadh, said an Iraqi attack on the shrines would be a mistake.
   ``It would backfire on them,'' he said. ``It's not the right
place or the right time to try to stir things up.''
   Thousands of soldiers from around the world were deployed to
Saudi Arabia after Iraq invaded neighboring Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   The multinational force was sent to protect Saudi Arabia on the
assumption it would be Saddam's next target and to enforce trade
sanctions against Baghdad. But the army could be used to attack if
diplomacy fails to force Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait.
   Saddam could plant saboteurs among with the 2 million Moslems
who visit Mecca and Medina during the hajj, as the Iranians did
before the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini died last year.
   For the last decade, the Saudis have been grappling with
Iranian-inspired terrorism, including attempts by Iranian
Revolutionary Guards disguised as pilgrims to smuggle explosives
and weapons into the kingdom.
   There has been no suggestion so far that Iraqis should be banned
from making the pilgrimage. The kingdom never banned Iranians, even
when relations hit rock bottom.
   In 1987, more than 400 people, most of them Iranian pilgrims,
were killed in what the Saudis said were Iranian-inspired riots in
Mecca, birthplace of the Prophet Mohammed, who Moslems believe
transmitted the word of God.
   The following year, the Saudis announced a quota system that
restricted the number of pilgrims to 1,000 for every 1 million
citizens of Moslem countries. That would have cut the Iranian
contingent from 150,000 to around 55,000. Iran has boycotted the
pilgrimage since then to protest the quotas.
   The differences between Iran and Saudi Arabia are both political
and religious. The Saudis were one of Iraq's main backers in the
Iran-Iraq war.
   Iran's 55 million people are overwhelmingly Shiite Moslem, a
breakaway sect. Saudi Arabia's estimated 9 million people are
mainly members of the mainstream Sunni sect.
   Iranian leaders have long demanded that Mecca and Medina be
wrested from the control of the Saudi royal family and put under an
international commission.
   The Saudis broke off relations with Tehran in April 1988,
accusing Iran of terrorism and subversion. But both sides have been
seeking to improve relations since Khomeini died and moderates
gained strength in Iran. Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait spurred
those efforts.
   Saddam has tried to don Khomeini's mantle by denouncing the
presence of foreign forces on Saudi soil as a betrayal of Islam.
But before August, the head of secular Iraq was not renowned for
his Islamic credentials.
   Meanwhile, Iranian-Saudi relations have been warming. The
foreign ministers of Iran and Saudi Arabia met in New York about
two months after the invasion of Kuwait in the first such senior
meeting since ties were broken.
   Foreign Minister Prince Saud al Faisal told his Iranian
counterpart, Ali Akbar Velayati, that he looked forward to seeing
Iranians make the hajj next year.
   But Iran has not dropped its two main demands: the abolition of
the quota system and the right to stage protests demonstrating
``antipathy toward pagans.''
   Despite strenuous Saudi efforts to prevent trouble, violence and
tragedy have marred the pilgrimage in recent years.
   Last year, two bombs exploded in Mecca, killing a pilgrim and
wounding 16. The Saudis executed 16 Kuwaiti Shiites convicted for
the bombings. Iran denied involvement.
   On July 3 of this year, 1,426 pilgrims were killed in a stampede
inside a pedestrian tunnel in Mecca.

   The stakes have never been higher as Secretary
of State James A. Baker III returns to the U.N. stage with what
appears to be a winning hand in a dangerous game of chicken with
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
   The issue could be no less than war or peace.
   Baker is meeting with other foreign ministers outside the United
Nations before taking charge of the Security Council on Thursday
with a U.S. resolution threatenin military force to rid Kuwait of
its Iraqi invaders.
   A poker-faced politician who helped lift his old Texas country
club buddy, George Bush, to the U.S. presidency, Baker has never
run a graver risk than the threat to go to war over Kuwait if Iraq
does not pull out by Jan. 15.
   His managerial skills already have been put to the test as he
carefully assembled on weary treks a lopsided majority to support
the resolution.
   His job now is to steer it through the U.N. Security Council
with a minimim of dissension, and in a way that maintains the odd
alliance that links such disparate states as Syria, the Soviet
Union, West European democracies, the Saudi monarchy and the exiled
rulers of Kuwait.
   The idea behind this toughest of resolutions directed at Saddam
Hussein since the Aug. 2 invasion is to frighten the Iraqi leader
into yielding. But what if the strategy doesn't work?
   The result could be the first war authorized by the Security
Council to counter aggression since the action against North Korea
40 years ago.
   The fear then was that China's intervention could touch off a
wider conflict. The fighting stopped short of that.
   The fears this time are several: Saddam could unleash a chemical
attack; inexperienced U.S. troops could get bogged down in a desert
war; Iraq could attack Israel or Saudi Arabia; heavy casualties
could result.
   Standing defiantly in the range of Iraqi missiles on
Thanksgiving, Bush acknowledged the dangers as he told U.S. troops
in Saudi Arabia:
   ``No one knows precisely when this dictator may acquire atomic
weapons or exactly whom they may be aimed at down the road. But we
do know this for sure: He has never possessed a weapon that he
didn't use.''
   Bush sent Baker on two long trips abroad this month to rally
support for the U.S. resolution threatening war to liberate Kuwait,
and Baker appears to have been successful.
   China said today that it would not vote for the resolution, but
it has promised not to veto it. Cuba probably will vote against the
resolution, possibly also Yemen, the only Arab country on the
15-nation council.
   Baker, who made plans to see as many foreign ministers as he
could today before Thursday's vote, has had the kind of break that
any political operative relishes.
   The Soviet Union, after insisting for months that diplomacy
should be given more time, now has turned on Saddam with a fury
matching Bush's.
   Incensed that Baghdad has trapped more than 3,000 Soviet
citizens in Iraq, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev demanded Monday
that Saddam withdraw from Kuwait and free foreign hostages.
   ``The fate of Iraq is in the hands of its leadership,'' he said.
``Time is running out.''
   Until Gorbachev leveled the threat at Iraqi Foreign Minister
Tariq Aziz in Moscow, the Soviets were very cautious about
threatening to use force.
   But the caution Gorbachev and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A.
Shevardnadze showed in their meetings with Baker has now given way
to unqualified support for the Bush administration.
   The shifting of the deadline from Jan. 1 to Jan. 15 represents a
slight concession to the Soviets and others hesitant to threaten
Iraq with ``all necessary means.'' It also gives U.S. troops more
time to get ready to fight.
   The additional two weeks could only make a difference if Saddam
were to do a 180-degree turn and obey the resolutions he has
ignored since the invasion.
   Since Baker already has repeatedly rejected ``partial
solutions,'' there may be no face-saving way out for Iraq.
   The hand held by Bush and Baker will have been called.

   Led by an American, Libya's war on deadly
flesh-eating screwworm flies is about to take to the skies.
   After months of delays, the aerial release of millions of
sterilized flies will begin early next week, according to an
official from one of the U.N. agencies leading efforts to wipe out
the parasite.
   Test releases had been scheduled for August, with hopes to begin
full-scale release in January.
   The program has been held up in part by initial U.S. refusal to
deal with Libya and by the slow response from several nations to
deliver on aid pledges.
   Officials are especially anxious since infestation by the fly,
which attacks livestock, wildlife and humans, has been reported
moving toward Egypt these days, borne by westerly winds.
   Experts have expressed fears that the fly could move quickly
down the Nile River Valley into Central Africa, threatening exotic
wildlife as well as livestock.
   The fly was first spotted in Libya in July 1988, and for most of
the time since has been living in a narrow band in northern Libya.
   The experts say that the only way effectively to eradicate the
fly is by releasing tens of millions of flies sterilized in a
special facility in Mexico that uses patented U.S. technology. The
flies mate with flies already in the area, the matings yield no
offspring and the insect eventually dies out.
   A U.S. entomologist employed jointly by the U.N. Food and
Agriculture Organization and the International Atomic Energy Agency
is in Tripoli to oversee the eradication efforts, said Bjorn
Sigurbjornsson, in a telephone conversation from the IAEA's Vienna
offices.
   The agency is involved because radiation is used to sterilize
the flies.
   U.S. sanctions, prohibiting Americans to travel to Libya or do
business with it, complicated planning for eradication. The
measures date back to 1986, when then-President Reagan accused Col.
Moammar Gadhafi's regime of sponsoring terrorism.
   Last spring, an FAO official announced that the United States
had reversed its position and agreed to let U.S. technicians
employed by international organizations travel to Libya on U.N.
passports. U.S. expertise is considered crucial to the success of
eradication.
   The United States became the expert in eradicating the fly after
a devastating infestation of lifestock in the American southwest.
   The fly settles in wounds or tick bites and eats away at the
flesh of its hosts, a fatal attack for many animals.
   Sigurbjornsson said there was particular concern at this time
because it is the lambing season in Libya, and trauma caused by the
birth of the animals could be inviting to the fly.
   ``September was a disaster. We had 3,000 cases'' of animal
infestation, Sigurbjornsson said.
   An official at the International Fund for Agricultural
Development, another U.N. organization based in Rome, said that
donor countries had so far delivered about $60 million, about
two-thirds of the aid sought earlier this year.

<HEAD>Chevron to Begin Pumping Oil From Huge California Offshore Field</HEAD>

   California's huge Point Arguello offshore
oil field - its value boosted by the Persian Gulf crisis - will
begin producing oil within a few months after years of
environmental and economic delays, officials say.
   A consortium of 18 oil companies will start pumping 20,000
barrels a day, Chevron Corp. spokesman Mike Libbey said Tuesday.
Chevron manages the project for the consortium.
   The field 150 miles north of Los Angeles contains an estimated
300 million barrels of heavy crude, the biggest reserve discovered
in the United States since Alaska's Prudhoe Bay in 1969.
   The consortium built a $2.2 billion pumping facility two years
ago, but it has been idle while the oil companies battle
politicians and environmentalists over the safest way to transport
the oil to Southern California refineries.
   The consortium said Tuesday it will send the oil by pipeline to
central and Northern California while it continues the battle.
   Libbey said the decision to pump now is tied to Iraq's Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait, which sent oil prices skyrocketing and left
future supplies of oil in doubt.
   ``We'd much rather have domestic oil,'' he said. ``That
situation didn't exist four months ago.''
   Earlier this year, when oil dropped below $20 a barrel, Chevron
said the consortium would have lost money on every barrel produced.
Oil is now more than $32 a barrel.
   The consortium had earlier held off production while it fought
with local politicians and environmentalists over whether to
transport oil from the site 10 miles off the central California
coast by tankers or by pipeline.
   The oil companies have sought permission to transport up to
40,000 barrels a day to Southern California by tanker for several
years until an underground pipeline to Los Angeles can be
completed. But Santa Barbara County officials and environmentalists
say tankers pose too great a risk of an oil spill.
   Libbey said Chevron appealed to the California Coastal
Commission on Tuesday to let it use tankers, but a hearing is not
expected for several months.
   In the meantime, he said, the consortium will ship 10,000 to
15,000 barrels of crude a day by pipeline to a Unocal refinery near
the coastal town of Santa Maria in central California. The rest
will go to refineries in central and Northern California.
   The consortium has approval to pump up to 100,000 barrels a day
from the field.
   ``The ultimate preferred destination is Los Angeles because
that's where the need is,'' he said. ``It's the biggest gasoline
market in the world.''

   Two Japanese cities top a list of the world's most
expensive cities for expatriates, while a weaker dollar is making
it cheaper for foreigners to live in the United States, according
to a new survey.
   With New York's rating set at 100, Tokyo was rated at 170, and
Osaka at 153, among the 89 major cities in the survey released
Tuesday by Corporate Resources Group, a Geneva-based consultancy.
   Libreville, Gabon, was third at 147.
   New York ranked 41st on the list. Chicago and Washington, D.C.,
were the second and third most expensive U.S. cities for
foreigners.
   Prague, with a rating of 56, and Ecuador's capital of Quito, 54,
were the cheapest cities to live in.
   Moscow was temporarily dropped from the survey ``due to the
severe shortage of goods and services,'' CRG said. Tehran, which
topped the previous list, was deleted because calculating costs
there had become too complicated.
   Si European cities - Oslo, Helsinki, Zurich, Geneva, Stockholm,
and Copenhagen - were among the top 10 with index figures ranging
from 144 to 131. Brazil's Sao Paulo, at 111, and Rio de Janeiro, at
110, have become the most expensive cities in the Western
Hemisphere because of soaring inflation rates.
   Among the 48 cities listed as cheaper than New York were Hong
Kong, Singapore, Buenos Aires, Lisbon, Jakarta, Bombay and Manila.
   The survey, prepared twice annually, is based on a basket of 151
products including food, clothing, recreation, transportation and
other selected items.
   It is used by transnationa companies to determine cost of
living differentials paid to expatriate employees. Housing costs
are excluded because companies and governments treat housing as a
separate allowance.

   The dollar closed nearly unchanged against the yen
today, while share prices fell on rumors of a major Japanese
bankruptcy.
   The dollar closed at 128.90 yen, down 0.05 yen from Tuesday's
close of 128.95 yen. It opened at 128.35 yen and ranged between
128.18 yen and 128.90 yen. The dollar had climbed a total of 1.82
yen in the previous two days.
   Some $8.37 billion changed hands in today's spot trading,
compared with $8.74 billion Tuesday.
   The dollar opened lower after its overnight decline in New York,
but there was dollar-buying later on rumors of a major Japanese
real estate firm going bankrupt and of Iraq attacking Saudi Arabia,
said a dealer with Tokai Bank, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Both rumors were groundless, he added.
   The U.S. currency often is seen as a safe haven in times of
international tension, while setbacks in Japanese business make the
yen less attractive.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which lost
139.35 yen on Tuesday, shed 569.63 more points, or 2.41 percent,
closing at 23,053.88.
   A total of 340 million shares were traded on the first section,
up from 250 million on Tuesday.
   Taiji Inoue of Yamaichi Securities said share prices fell almost
across the board in afternoon trading following the bankruptcy
rumor. The market already had been weakened by the continuing
stalemate in the Persian Gulf situation, he added.
   In bond dealings, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds edged down to 86.42 as of 5 p.m. (3 a.m.
EST) from Tuesday's close of 86.45. Their yield rose to 7.395
percent from 7.390 percent.

<HEAD>National Book Awards: Stories of Freed Slave and Gentlemen Bankers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A history of the banking dynasty whose leading
member was J.P. Morgan won the National Book Award for non-fiction,
while the tale of a freed slave's sea journey back to Africa was
honored in the fiction category.
   Ron Chernow's ``The House of Morgan: An American Banking Dynasty
and the Rise of Modern Finance'' and Charles Johnson's ``Middle
Passage'' were selected Tuesday by the National Books Foundation
for its 40th anniversary awards.
   Chernow, 41, of New York City, said he wrote about 19th century
American bankers to contrast their style with the likes of Donald
Trump in the 1980s.
   The Morgans had ``a very different notion of what business was.
It was a gentlemen's club against today's wild carnival of greed,''
Chernow said.
   Johnson, 42, a professor of English at the University of
Washington in Seattle, is the first black man to win since Ralph
Ellison in 1953 for ``Invisible Man.'' Two black women, Gloria
Naylor and Alice Walker, have also won.
   ``In this decade, we will see the emergence of black-author
fiction that will help us as a people and as a culture to move from
narrow complaint to broad celebration,'' Johnson said.
   ``Middle Passage,'' which refers to the Atlantic crossing by
slave ships, recounts a terrifying voyage taken by a freed slave
aboard a clipper in 1830. The trip serves as a catalyst for
self-discovery.
   ``You don't write out of your skin. Black and white Americans
share the same ideals,'' Ellison said after the awards. ``Johnson
can take a slave odyssey and knows how it links up to
Shakespeare.''
   The panel that selected the fiction winner had been marked by
deep ideological divisions and reached its decision after stormy
discussions, participants said.
   Writer Paul West said there was ``acute dividedness over nearly
everything'' and that ``ethnic considerations, ideology and moral
self-righteousness'' prevailed over style and merit.
   Among the five fiction nominees were three books by immigrant
authors - the first novels of Philippine-born Jessica Hagedorn and
Spanish-native Elena Castedo, and a 1948 novel by Spanish-born
Felipe Alfau, who is 88.
   The fifth was Joyce Carol Oates' ``Because It is Bitter and
Because It Is My Heart,'' which deals with a young white woman and
a black classmate.
   Other non-fiction finalists were: ``Small Victories: The Real
World of a Teacher, Her Students and Their High School,'' by Samuel
G. Freedman; ``Richard Milhous Nixon: The Rise of an American
Politician,'' by Roger Morris; ``Jackson Pollock: An American
Saga,'' by Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith, and ``Righteous
Pilgrim: The Life and Times of Harold L. Ickes, 1874-1952,'' by
T.H. Watkins.
   The 10 finalists came from among 375 books put forward by 72
publishers.

<TEXT>
   The FBI has illegally kept a file for five years
on the head of an organization that defends political dissidents
around the world, the American Civil Liberties Union charged in
lawsuit against the bureau.
   The lawsuit, filed Tuesday in federal court in Washington,
accuses the FBI of violating the free-speech and privacy rights of
Lance Lindblom of the J. Roderick MacArthur Foundation.
   ``I am outraged that my own country engages in such insidious
police-state tactics of keeping files on law-abiding organizations
and people,'' Lindblom said.
   The lawsuit seeks unedited copies of all material in the file,
destruction of the file, an admission that the FBI acted unlawfully
and monetary damages to be decided by a jury, said Harvey Grossman,
legal director for the ACLU's Illinois chapter.
   In Washington, FBI spokesman Carlos Fernandez said the bureau
does not comment on active litigation.
   Grossman said Lindblom received 22 pages from the file after a
Freedom of Information request was filed, but the information was
so heavily censored it was impossible to tell why Lindblom was
placed under surveillance.
   He said the FBI cited national security concerns in censoring
the material.
   One uncensored item from the file was a newspaper column about
Lindblom's travels with a South Korean dissident. Lindblom said he
often travels overseas and his foundation helps defend dissidents
on trial in sensitive areas of the world.
   He said the foundation, based in suburban Niles, has donated $26
million in support of social justice since its founding in 1976.
Among the causes it has supported was the making of the 1989
documentary ``Roger and Me,'' about the impact on Michigan
residents of the closing of several General Motors plants.
   ``I think it affects people dealing with us,'' Lindblom said of
the FBI's keeping of a dossier. ``And how do you tell your 5- and
6-year-old sons - which I had to do last night - why the FBI is
investigating you? That was chilling enough.''

   The federal government took control of
the northeastern state of Assam today, postponing elections there
and giving security forces broad powers to fight violence by
militant separatists.
   The first major political decision by the 18-day-old government
of Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar was approved at a Cabinet meeting
Tuesday night, a Home Ministry spokesman said.
   The federal rule order must be ratified by Parliament, and can
last up to six months without new parliamentary approval.
   Assam, rich in oil, teak and tea, has been in the grip of a
secessionist movement for two years. Militants of the United
Liberation Front of Assam say the benefits of the area's natural
resources should go only to native Assamese.
   The militants have killed at least 100 people in the two years
of their armed campaign in Assam, a state of more than 21 million
people that is nearly separated from the rest of India by
Bangladesh.
   The federal government, which banned the front on Tuesday,
claims the militants are trained by rebels in the neighboring state
of Nagaland and by Burmese guerrillas.
   Assam is the third state to fall under federal rule. Punjab,
where Sikh militants have been fighting for independence, has been
governed from New Delhi for 42 months. Jammu-Kashmir was placed
under federal rule in January to combat a Moslem seccessionist
movement.
   Elections for Assam's state legislature were to have taken place
by Jan. 8, when lawmakers' five-year terms expired.
   The legislature, now stripped of power, is dominated by the Asom
Gana Parishad, or Assam People's Party, which rode to power in 1985
on a wave of student-led violence for greater autonomy.
   Assam Chief Minister Prafulla Kumar Mahanta, the state's highest
elected official, condemned the federal rule decision as ``a
betrayal of the democratic process.''
   Mahanta's People's Party achieved an agreement for greater
autonomy from the federal government in 1985. But more radical
members of his party rejected the accord and formed the Liberation
Front to demand complete independence.
   Mahanta's party was part of coalition government of former Prime
Minister V.P. Singh. Chandra Shekhar replaced Singh on Nov. 10
after leading a breakaway faction of Singh's Janata Dal party.
   Assam is also being torn by a separatist movement among the
animist Bodo tribes of northern Assam, who say the Hindu-dominated
Assam government discriminates against them.

<DATELINE>MIDDLETOWN, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A long-delayed plan to boil off
radioactive water left over from the 1979 accident at Three Mile
Island begins Thursday.
   ``I fully expect it will be easier to evaporate 2.3 million
gallons of water than getting permission,'' Joe Kuehn, site
operations director of the damaged Unit 2 reactor, said Tuesday in
announcing the start of the process.
   The project was proposed in 1986, but government reviews and
challenges from anti-nuclear groups held it up.
   GPU Nuclear Corp., operator the nuclear plant, said the water is
mildly radioactive and the raditation released poses no threat to
the public.
   The Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved the proposal. The
state Environmental Resources Department on Nov. 21 cleared the way
for the process to begin.
   Kuehn said the water will be boiled twice and will take 18
months to two years to evaporate.
   Trace amounts of radioactive tritium that could not be filtered
out will be vented with steam, along with smaller traces of cesium,
strontium and carbon-14, Kuehn said. He said the maximum dose
anyone could receive from the released tritium equals about one
day's exposure to naturally ocurring radiation.
   Fuel inside Unit 2 began melting and radiation was released in
1979 during what was the nation's worst accident at a commercial
nuclear plant.

<TEXT>
   This winter will likely be the cruelest since
World War II for the Soviet Union and its former East bloc allies
as recession, compounded by rising oil prices, continues to deepen,
U.N. economists say.
   In a report released Tuesday, the economists draw a grim picture
of increasing food shortages in the Soviet Union, Bulgaria and
Romania, soaring unemployment rates throughout the region and
double-digit inflation.
   These threats could stall the whole reform process of moving
from a command to a market economy, they say.
   ``The consequences of such a failure are incalculable and would
not only be economic,'' they warn in the 147-page report, which
also pointed to ``increasing signs of social unrest in the East.''
   ``One certain effect would be to raise enormous pressures for
emigration from the East to the West,'' says the survey, compiled
by experts of the U.N. Economic Commission for Europe. It notes
that new Soviet legislation would soon allow unrestricted travel
abroad.
   ``There seems to be little ground for contradicting the view
that the people of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union are facing
their hardest winter since the end of the second World War,'' the
report says.
   The survey also says slower economic growth in Western Europe
and fears that the United States could slide into recession may
have an impact on financial and technical support for the East.
   Moscow's former Eastern European allies depend on the Soviet
Union for about 80 percent of their oil. Transmission breakdowns
have already reduced Soviet exports by more than a fifth, the
survey notes.
   Starting Jan. 1, 1991, payment for Soviet oil will have to be in
convertible currency and at world market prices. Under the region's
Comecon trading system, to be dissolved on that date, Moscow's
partners have paid the equivalent of about $7.50 per barrel in
transferable rubles. This compared with an average $18 paid on
world markets before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
   If Eastern Europe has to buy oil at $35 or even $40 a barrel,
then the ``price shock is much larger'' than the ones faced by the
West in the 1970s, the survey says.
   The Comecon trading system, based on bilateral agreements, has
already effectively collapsed, the survey says.
   ``During the course of this year, a chaotic mixture of barter
deals, clearing agreements and hard currency transactions have
emerged,'' it
   adds. To avoid accumulation of rubles, the survey says, Moscow's
partners have resorted to a variety of trade restrictions that led
to retaliations and a ``virtual trade war.''

   Todor Zhivkov, the deposed Communist dictator in
Bulgaria who was long regarded as the East bloc leader most
subservient to Moscow, says he views his long political career as a
big mistake.
   ``If I had to do it over again, I would not even be a Communist,
and if Lenin were alive today he would say the same thing,''
Zhivkov said in an interview in today's The New York Times. The
interview took place at his granddaughter's house in Sofia, where
he remains under house arrest.
   Zhivkov, 79, ruled Bulgaria for 35 years until he was forced out
last year. But he said he began to doubt his belief in Communism in
the mid-1950s and realized after the rise of Mikhail Gorbachev that
the structure of Communism was shaky.
   ``I have been a soldier. I have been a Communist. It is my deep
belief and conviction that I served my people and my country,'' he
said. ``But I must now admit that we started from the wrong basis,
from the wrong premise. The foundation of socialism was wrong.''
   Zhivkov is facing corruption and embezzlement charges. Bulgaria
is in dire straits. The country is broke and Moscow is preoccupied
with its own difficulties.
   ``The nation is on the verge of self-destruction, national
suicide,'' he said. ``It doesn't matter anymore whether the system
is called socialism or capitalism.''
   Zhvikov said his country would have fared better had it allied
itself with the West early on instead of casting its lot with the
Soviet Union after World War II.
   ``We were surrendered to Stalin's camp,'' he said. ``Bulgaria
would certainly be far ahead of where it is now if it had been
Western-oriented.''
   Such remarks contrast sharply with comments made by Zhivkov in
the past. Twenty years ago, he said the Soviet Union and Bulgaria
``act as a single body, breathing with the same lungs, and
nourished by the same bloodstream.''
   When reminded of such statements, Zhivkov dismissed them with a
wave of his hand.
   ``That was just an image, just rhetoric,'' he said. ``Those were
different times.''
   Zhivkov said he knew about labor camps and the political
killings that were carried out in Bulgaria and elsewhere in Eastern
Europe even before 1956, when Nikita Khrushchev denounced some of
the crimes of the Stalinist period.
   But Zhivkov said he and his associates were unable to stop the
terror.
   ``We were aware that we were not in a position to get out of the
orbit we were circling in,'' he said. ``It was impossible for us to
break apart from the system, and the reason for that was not Todor
Zhivkov.''

<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has postponed a
trip to Oslo next month to receive the Nobel Peace Prize because of
domestic political and economic problems, Tass reported today.
   The official Soviet news agency said Gorbachev hoped the Nobel
Committee would agree to postpone the Dec. 9-10 ceremonies and
present him the prize at a later unspecified date.
   Gorbachev postponed the trip ``due to the crucial situation in
the country and the president's preoccupation with affairs that
require his constant attention,'' his press office said.
   In Oslo, Nobel Committee secretary Geir Lundestad would not
comment on the Soviet request.
   Gobbachev is struggling to hold his geographically and
ethnically diverse country together in the face of mounting
nationalism and independence drives by the 15 republics. The Soviet
Union also faces a grave economic crisis.

<HEAD>Bush Promising Mexicans He Will Veto Trade Barriers</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: Subs 4th graf, ``But protectionist xxx to CORRECT Monday to
Tuesday; Bush meeting with Baker set for 1:30 p.m. EST</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   President Bush, seeking to allay Mexican
worries about ``the evil vise of U.S. protectionism,'' is promising
to fight any congressional efforts to raise trade barriers at that
country's expense.
   Bush cautioned U.S. and Mexican business leaders Tuesday that
protectionist sentiments may spread with the downturn in the U.S.
economy.
   ``As the gigantic U.S. economy slows down - it may slow down
even more - it concerns me that some in our country and some in our
Congress might turn inward to what you properly label as a
protectionist mode,'' Bush said.
   But protectionist measures will not become ``a major problem,''
Bush said before returning to Washington Tuesday night from a
two-day trip to Mexico. ``This president will continue to veto
protectionist legislation.
   ``I think most Americans realize that if we are going to export,
we better not be protectionist,'' Bush said. ``You can't have it
both ways. We shouldn't want to have it both ways.''
   Bush was focusing today on the United Nations debate set for
Thursday on a U.S.-backed resolution to authorize military force
against Iraq unless it pulls out of Kuwait by Jan. 15.
   He was meeting with Secretary of State James A. Baker III for a
briefing on Baker's talks with U.N. Security Council members who
will be vote on the resolution.
   Bush's main reason for his visit to Monterrey, Mexico, was to
discuss with President Carlos Salinas de Gortari the prospects for
a free-trade agreement between the two countries. Bush has asked
Congress for the green light to begin negotiations.
   ``I don't think as we go forward on a free trade agreement it's
going to get caught up in the evil vise of U.S. protectionism,''
Bush said Monday before Salinas hosted the president and his wife,
Barbara, at a state luncheon.
   In a joint statement, the two presidents expressed ``shared
concern about the cases of violence on both sides of the border.''
The issue is a sensitive one in Mexico. Concerns have been
expressed about violence in the United States against Mexican
immigrants. The presidents directed their aides to develop
recommendations on stopping such incidents.
   They also agreed to develop a plan to deal with environmental
pollution along the border, including hazardous wastes produced by
Mexican industry.
   The United States already has free-trade agreements with Canada
and Israel. Some Mexicans have expressed concern that U.S.
competition could overwhelm their companies under a free-trade
agreement while others appear wary lest Americans skew such a pact
in their own favor.
   Salinas, who rolled back Mexico's high tariffs in the two years
since he took office, has expressed concern that protectionist
attitudes are spreading in the United States with the worsening
economy.
   He also complained that Mexican exports are subject to far more
restrictions and regulation at the U.S. border than are American
products entering Mexico.
   Bush underscored his hope for a successful conclusion to the
Uruguay Round of international trade talks. They are currently
deadlocked over European agricultural subsidies, which Washington
wants slashed.
   Bush said, however, protectionist sentiment in Congress arising
from the deadlocked talks and proposed free-trade pact ``can be
managed.''

<HEAD>Fuel Tank Experts Snuff Out Fire at Denver Airport</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five experts in fireproof suits waded into a blaze
feeding on as much as 2.3 million gallons of jet fuel and in half
an hour snuffed a fire that had burned for 53 hours at Stapleton
International Airport.
   ``It's just like the fire forgot what to do,'' said Dwight
Williams, owner of Williams, Boots &amp; Coots of Port Neches, Texas.
He was one of the five men who extinguished the blaze Tuesday.
   The crew sprayed a smothering chemical on an 800,000-gallon tank
and a 350,000-gallon tank after firefighters cooled the two
containers that had burned since Monday with foam and water so the
men could get near the valves.
   The larger tank was one-third to one-half full; the other had
only a fraction of fuel.
   Up to 150 firefighters had battled the blaze but admitted they
weren't up to the task in tools or expertise.
   ``The reality is this kind of thing doesn't happen very often
and there are very few people who do it on a regular basis,'' said
Fire Chief Richard Gonzales.
   Denver officials had planned to let the fire burn itself out but
changed their strategy after consulting Williams, Boots &amp; Coots.
Continental Airlines, which owns four tanks at the storage area,
hired the specialists and flew them in.
   Gonzales said it took 13 minutes to suffocate the bigger blaze
and 17 minutes more to snuff the other.
   ``It's like riding bad horses or jumping out of an airplane,''
said Williams, who formed the company 11 years ago. ``And I've done
both.''
   A broken valve on a 400,000-gallon tank was thought to have
touched off the fire, which broke out Sunday and spread to a
400,000-gallon tank. Those two tanks burned themselves out Monday,
but not before igniting the two other tanks.
   The four tanks and a 24-inch pipeline had a capacity of about
2.3 million gallons of fuel, but it was not immediately clear how
much burned at the tank farm a half mile from the airport terminal.
   The fire reduced the two 400,000-gallon tanks to smoldering,
crumpled hulks but left the two others standing. All four tanks
were owned by United Airlines.
   The fire forced the airline Sunday to reschedule and delay
flights. By Monday, United had solved its shortage by flying in
fuel and using tanker trucks.

<HEAD>Governor, Cabinet OK Plan to Place Florida Keys in Marine Preserve</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gov. Bob Martinez has endorsed plans to
protect the Florida Keys by creating a marine preserve that would
be paid for in part by $5 fees on snorkling and diving.
   The plan, approved by Martinez and the Cabinet on Tuesday, still
needs the Legislature's OK.
   The Keys are a string of islands extending from Florida's tip,
from the Atlantic Ocean to the Gulf of Mexico. Environmentalists
say the area's coral reefs and sea grass beds are being destroyed
by boats and overdevelopment.
   The proposal approved Tuesday calls for boundaries that would
extend from the islands out three miles into the Atlantic Ocean and
10 miles into the Gulf.
   Martinez and the Cabinet rejected one part of the plan that
would have instituted a 50-cent highway toll and $1 flight fee to
help pay for the preserve. Left intact was a $5 fee on snorkling
and diving.
   Agriculture Commissioner Doyle Conner said the money shouldn't
come from tourists simply because they travel to the area.
   ``In my judgment they should pay when they dive, or when they
launch (boats),'' he said.
   The proposal would also place sensitive areas of the Keys
off-limits to boaters and slap controls on treasure hunting,
tropical fish collecting and spearfishing.

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Spurred by fears nuclear weapons could fall into
the hands of separatists in the climate of eroding central control,
the Kremlin has warned that troops will shoot anyone trying to
seize military installations.
   In statements published today, Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev and Defense Minister Dmitri Yazov denounced attempts by
breakaway republics to form their own armies and take control of
nuclear arsenals.
   They also criticized vandalism of Red Army monuments and
discrimination by civilians against servicemen and their families
seeking housing, jobs and services.
   The army newspaper Red Star also quoted Russian Federation
President Boris N. Yeltsin, Gorbachev's rival and a leading
advocate of greater autonomy for the republics, defending the
military.
   ``We offer constructive help to the armed forces, so that they
are not drawn into the political battle,'' Yeltsin was quoted as
saying at a session of the Russian Congress of Peoples' Deputies.
   ``More and more quarters have been speaking out against the
armed forces in recent days,'' Yazov said in a speech televised
Tuesday night and published today in Red Star.
   ``In several republics, the formation of independent army units
is developing, in contradiction of the need for a united armed
forces,'' he said.
   Yazov said military district commanders have ``directives to
take installations and systems under the guard and protection of
armed units'' in case local civilian officials shut off their
water, power or other services.
   Soldiers have orders to ``use weapons'' if they or their bases
are attacked. Commanders have orders to prevent acts of vandalism
and ``counteract the construction of monuments ... glorifying
fascists and their henchmen.''
   ``Calls are heard to turn over nuclear weapons to individual
republics,'' Gorbachev said. ``Making claims on nuclear weapons
will not be allowed under any circumstances. They have been and
will remain in the hands of a united Armed Forces.''
   Yazov's speech, and a decree issued by Gorbachev protecting the
rights of servicemen and their families, came 11 days after the
Soviet president said he planned major changes in the armed forces.
   Gorbachev has not indicated what reforms he has in mind, beyond
a previously announced plan to convert defense factories to
civilian production and cut military spending in conjunction with
East-West treaties reducing conventional and nuclear arsenals.
   Those treaties have been accompanied by the withdrawal of many
Soviet troops from Eastern Europe and the de facto disintegration
of the Kremlin-led Warsaw Pact military alliance. The retreat, and
problems finding housing and jobs for displaced servicemen, have
battered morale in the armed forces.
   ``Attempts are made to defame and dishonor officers and
soldiers, (and) members of their families. There are armed assaults
against military installations,'' Gorbachev said.
   Army officials and publications have aired similar complaints in
the past, but they have proved difficult to verify and catalogue.
   The strong words from Gorbachev and Yazov also had the clear
intention of re-establishing the crumbling authority of the central
government, which is fast losing power to the 15 Soviet republics.
   Gorbachev is pushing for a new union treaty to cede some local
and economic authority to the republics, but retain central control
over defense and security, foreign policy and international trade.
   On Tuesday, Gorbachev's Communist Party allies in the Russian
Congress tried to persuade the body to vote on the union treaty.
Yeltsin and Gorbachev hammered out a compromise under which the
Congress would debate the union treaty, but not vote on it.

<TEXT>
   New York City has moved to take cigarettes out
of the hands of youngsters by taking cigarette machines out of most
public places.
   A law banning the vending machines in all public places but
taverns and hotel bars, where minors aren't allowed anyway, was
passed 33-1 by the City Council on Tuesday and signed by Mayor
David Dinkins.
   ``Today we have achieved an important pro-child, pro-health law
that will save lives,'' said Dinkins, who quit smoking 28 years
ago. ``Each year in New York, 32,000 children begin a habit that
will lead to the death of 10,000 of them.''
   The law, which orders the machines removed by Jan. 31, 1992, is
similar to measures already in effect in Minneapolis and Salt Lake
City.
   Councilman Jerome O'Donovan, who cast the only vote against it,
complained it amounts to too much regulation and is unenforceable.
   City law already restricts smoking in private work places, and
former Mayor Edward I. Koch banned smoking by executive order in
municipal buildings.
   Dinkins said he wants the city also to phase out cigarette
advertising in baseball stadiums and on city property.

<TEXT>
   Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said today that
China will not vote in favor of a United Nations resolution
authorizing the use of force to drive Iraq out of Kuwait.
   However, he refused to say whether China would abstain from the
vote expected Thursday or veto the measure. U.S. officials have
said they expect China will not exercise its veto.
   ``It has always been the position of China to call for a
peaceful settlement of the gulf crisis and to avoid the use of
force or the act of war,'' Qian told reporters at Beijing's airport
while preparing to leave for the United States.
   As one of the five permanent members of the U.N. Security
Council, China has veto power over any resolution. It has voted for
all 10 previous U.N. resolutions that seek to pressure Iraq into
ending its nearly 4-month-old occupation of Kuwait. But it has
expressed reluctance to see force used.
   China and the four other permanent members - the United States,
Soviet Union, France and Britain - worked Monday on a draft
resolution that would allow ``all necessary means'' to liberate
Kuwait. Some U.S. and Soviet officials indicated they expected
China to support the resolution.
   But Qian said such predictions have ``no basis.''
   Asked if he meant China will not vote for the resolution, Qian
said, ``I think so.''
   Asked if he planned to veto it, he replied, ``I have not said
so. I think you will know after I cast the vote. I will not say
anything before then.''
   The United States is the main sponsor of the resolution,
although the U.S. government has said it already has authority to
use force without it.
   China may hope to use the threat of a veto to win a U.S. promise
to lift sanctions imposed after China's June 1989 army attack that
crushed a pro-democracy movement. Those sanctions already have
crumbled in recent months, due in part to Chinese cooperation on
earlier U.N. resolutions against Iraq.
   Qian said he planned to meet tonight with Secretary of State
James A. Baker III. Concessions Qian might seek would include an
end to U.S. opposition to World Bank loans to China that do not
address humanitarian needs, a resumption of defense cooperation and
military sales, and agreement not to link China's human rights
record to its most-favored-nation trade status.
   What China most wants is an understanding that bilateral
relations will be conducted on pragmatic terms and that human
rights issues such as the jailing of dissidents will not be raised
at every forum.
   Qian's visit strips one sanction, the ban on high-level
exchanges, of most of its meaning, although the State Department on
Tuesday insisted it remains in force. Department spokesman Richard
Boucher said the sanction bars excanges of a ``formal and
ceremonial nature'' but not contacts.
   Qian told reporters, ``I see no difference between contacts and
exchanges.''
   He said he expected to meet with President Bush and discuss
relations and a peace settlement in Cambodia as well as the Persian
Gulf crisis.
   ``I think that this visit is a rather important event in
bilateral relations,'' he said. He said he is willing to meet with
U.S. legislators is the American side makes such arrangements.
   The U.S. Congress has been far stronger in its criticism of
China's crackdown on dissent than the Bush administration, which
argues that direct attacks on the Chinese leadership will have no
effect.

   Rob Pilatus, one-half of the fallen

   Pilatus, 26, was arrested early Tuesday at his home, said police
spokeswoman Maureen Dambach.
   Police said the alleged victim was a 25-year-old woman but gave
no other details. Sexual battery is defined as touching ``an
intimate part of another person while that person is unlawfully
restrained.''
   Pilatus was freed from jail on $10,000 bail, and also paid $485
for outstanding traffic violations, police said.
   Pilatus refused to comment on the allegations.
   ``Too much publicity,'' he said Tuesday night as he and his

   Mozart may roll over when the Connecticut
Opera adds a wedding to ``The Marriage of Figaro,'' which despite
its title lacked matrimony.
   Kathy Trombetta and Al Perkins will tie the knot on stage during
the opera's opening night Thursday because the story of their
courtship won a radio station contest.
   The wedding, with a traditional white gown and black tuxedo,
will begin an hour before the opera's start and will use the set of
the opera's fourth scene - a fountain - as a backdrop. Friends,
family and ticketholders are invited.
   Betty Hughes, director of marketing for Connecticut Opera, said
the contest was inspired by the wedding that dominates the
characters' discussion but is never performed in the opera.
   ``We decided we'd have a real marriage,'' she said.
   WKSS-FM selected the couple's story from about 50 entries.
   The love story of Ms. Trombetta, 20, and Perkins, 24, began
eight years ago when she delivered newspapers in Plymouth and took
notice of the Perkins family's 16-year-old son.
   ``He was so good looking. It was pure crush,'' Ms. Trombetta
said, recalling how she used to bring friends along her route just
to see Perkins.
   Perkins said he was, at first, nonchalant because ``she was a
little kid and I was 16 years old,'' he said. But the two met met
again several years later at a prom and Perkins looked with new
eyes at his former papergirl.
   They started dating a few months later.
   Perkins, a convenience store manager, and Ms. Trombetta, a
dental assistant, said they don't know much about opera but are
excited about their theatrical debut.
   ``We wanted a special wedding,'' she said.

<TEXT>
   A sheriff who commandeered a National
Guard armory nine months ago after running out of jail space says a
lack of money has forced a retreat.
   Sheriff Michael J. Ashe Jr. said Tuesday that prisoners in the
Holyoke armory will be out by Friday, after Gov. Michael S. Dukakis
rejected his plea for $450,000 to keep the operation going.
   The 19 prisoners in the armory, which has housed up to 68
inmates, will probably be released, said Hampden County Jail
spokesman Richard McCarthy.
   ``We don't have the money,'' said Tripp Jones, a spokesman for
L. Edward Lashman, the governor's top financial aide. ``Hard as
we've tried to find the funds for some time to help Sheriff Ashe
out, unfortunately they do not exist.''
   Ashe seized an active armory in Springfield in February. He
ended up with permission to use the vacant armory in nearby Holyoke
after reaching a compromise with state officials.
   Initially, neighbors objected to the makeshift jail, but many
were won over after inmates began patching streets and cleaning
parks.

<TEXT>
   The barren shelves of Soviet grocery stories are
the result of a crumbling distribution system and panic buying, not
any real shortage of food, a senior Soviet official was quoted as
saying today.
   ``The amount of food in the Soviet Union has not diminished,''
Tass quoted First Deputy Premier Lev Voronin as saying on Soviet
television late Tuesday.
   The central government is toughening sanctions against those who
fail to meet food delivery orders, he said.
   Many regions of the Soviet Union have halted shipments of food
and consumer goods to other parts of the country as a means of
dealing with the collapsing Soviet economy.
   Rather than obey the central government's demands for food
deliveries to the cities at state prices they consider too low,
producers are trading food directly for other scarce supplies
wherever they find them.
   Economic reforms also have freed farmers to sell more of their
produce at market prices, leaving less for delivery at dirt-cheap
prices to the state stores.
   Soviet and German officials have set up task forces to arrange
transport and distribution of emergency food aid for Soviet
consumers facing barren shelves, a high-ranking German official
said today.
   Horst Teltschik, top foreign policy aide to Chancellor Helmut
Kohl, told reporters he was to meet with Soviet President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev to discuss food aid as well longer-term economic

   Kohl has promised massive emergency aid to protect Soviet
citizens from hunger during the winter. German Red Cross officials
have already begun receiving contributions for the Soviets from
private German citizens.
   The Soviet Union had a record grain crop this year but the
centralized economy was unable to adjust quickly to bring in the
bounty, and millions of tons of wheat rotted in fields for lack of
equipment, fuel and transport space.
   Russian republic President Boris N. Yeltsin warned Russian
legislators Tuesday that food shortages have nearly overshadowed
all other issues.
   The latest consumer crisis to strike Moscow is a milk shortage,
which has reduced the production of processed cheese, cottage
cheese and sour cream.
   The capital has already endured scarcities this year of such
staples as bread, sugar, cigarettes and potatoes.

<HEAD>Inoperable Cancer Tumors Frozen by New Technique</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A procedure for freezing tumors offers new hope
for victims of liver cancer - one of the deadliest forms of the
disease - and may also be useful against prostate cancer, a
scientist says.
   Of 30 liver cancer patients who underwent the procedure, six are
disease-free, said Dr. Gary Onik of Pittsburgh's Presbyterian
Hospital. His work was reported Tuesday at the 76th Scientific
Assembly and Annual Meeting of the Radiological Society of North
America.
   The technique, called cryosurgery, can destroy tumors next to
major blood vessels without destroying normal tissues nearby, Onik
said.
   Onik and colleagues also have tested the ultrasound-guided
probes that freeze cancerous tumors with liquid nitrogen on seven
prostate cancer patients. Of those patients, no complications have
resulted, Onik said.
   Onik said the technique can benefit patients whose cancer is
caught before it affects the whole liver. He said radiation and
chemotherapy are ineffective against liver cancer.
   ``Everybody we worked on by definition couldn't be helped any
other way,'' Onik said.
   The patients who are disease-free have survived an average of 29
months, with the longest five years, he said. Survival for the
other patients has averaged 22 months, and two whose cancer has
come back are still alive, he said.
   The projected survival among comparable liver cancer patients
who don't use cryosurgery is six to nine months, Onik said.
   Dr. Andrew Gage, deputy director of the Roswell Park Cancer
Institute in Buffalo, N.Y., said Onik's technique offers hope to
patients who otherwise would be lost.
   He said conventional surgery is still preferred, but cryosurgery
might be better for the approximately one person in 50 who has too
many lesions to remove with a scalpel but not so many that they
involve the whole liver.
   ``I think he's making an important contribution,'' Gage said in
a telephone interview.
   The technique involves making an incision into the abdomen and
using ultrasound to find the cancerous lesions in the liver. A
surgeon then inserts a probe into a lesion and freezes it.

   Place mats and linen tablecloths have
gone the way of long white gloves at two Seven Sisters colleges
because of budget problems.
   Smith College recently dropped its tradition of serving Thursday
night dinners on linen tablecloths by candlelight when the school,
facing a $2.6 million shortfall, decided to phase out the school
laundry, spokeswoma Mary Reutener said Monday.
   ``We're sad to see it go,'' she said of the tradition, which
disappeared from other Seven Sisters campuses long ago.
   Nearby, at Mount Holyoke College, place mats were dropped this
year to save about $10,000, said spokeswoman Vee Wailgum. Efforts
to bring the school in 5 percent under the $60 million budget
include dorm competitions to save electricity and a switch from
individual cereal boxes to bins at breakfast, Wailgum said.
   ``Gracious living comes pretty high these days,'' Debra Thomas,
spokeswoman at Bryn Mawr College, said Monday. She said the Seven
Sisters school in Pennsylvania cut out morning coffee and doughnuts
three years ago to save $25,000 annually.
   At Smith, efforts to maintain the Thursday night ambience are
under way, said Brooks Campion, president of the Student Government
Association. She said a committee has been formed to meet with an
interior decorator to talk about alternatives, possibly decorative
place mats.
   ``Students are sad about the tradition because it means a lot to
us. But we're definitely willing to save,'' she said.

<HEAD>Police Clash with Students and Strikers on Sofia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VESELIN TOSHKOV</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Riot police plunged into a crowd of about
2,000 protesters blocking a bridge in downtown Sofia today and beat
students who were calling for the Socialist government to step
down.
   Two students were arrested and one policeman was injured in the
clash. A doctor later said the students were badly beaten in
custody and had to be hospitalized.
   About 200 students formed a chain across the Eagles Bridge at 7
a.m., bringing rush hour traffic to a standstill. Soon the blockade
was joined by a swell of trade unionists who have organized a
general strike this week.
   Sympathetic drivers parked four trolley buses across the bridge.
Many of the protesters wore blue armbands, the color of the
opposition Union of Democratic Forces.
   The protesters called for the resignation of Premier Andrei
Lukanov, a former Communist turned reformer who became increasingly
unpopular as Bulgaria slid into its most serious economic crisis
since World War II.
   The protest had been going on about an hour when police in riot
gear tried to push the protesters back from the bridge and drove
one of the parked buses away. Using batons, the police beat a few
dozen protesters who pressed forward to try to stop a second bus
from being removed.
   The bridge was cleared by 10 a.m., police spokesmen said, but
strikers tried to stop streetcars and buses in other parts of the
capital, a stronghold for the opposition.
   The leader of Union of Democratic Forces, Petar Beron, called
for a two-day general strike to end today, but others in the
opposition vowed to continue it. It was not clear early today how
many workers were involved in the strike.
   Nedelcho Terdiski, a doctor at Tirogov hospital, said the two
arrested students were brought to the hospital from Sofia's central
police station with injuries apparently caused by beatings.
   Mayor Alexander Karakachanov called the police intervention as
``impermissible.'' He said an investigation was being carried out
and officers found guilty of beating detainees would be punished.
   Lukanov's government began talks with opposition leaders Tuesday
on resolving the standoff over how to run this Balkan country of 9
million people.
   The opposition alliance on Tuesday urged workers to end the
general strike while the talks went on.
   Podkrepa, the opposition labor federation, said Tuesday that
790,000 Bulgarians took part in the general strike, including
220,000 in Sofia.
   BTA, the Bulgarian news agency, reported about 500,000 workers -
roughly 11 percent of the work force - were on strike Tuesday. The
government said only one worker out of 100 struck.

   A 7-foot, 275-pound sheriff's deputy
was awarded $5,000 in slander damages because the motorist who

   Judge Byron Robb ruled Monday that Patrick Edgmon, at 5-foot-10

chipped tooth if Deputy Hank Tashjian had belted him as Edgmon
claimed.
   Edgmon ``in all probability would have had no teeth at all,''

   The Conservative Party elected John Major as their
leader, but only Queen Elizabeth II could make him prime minister.
   The queen made Major's appointment official this morning after
holding a private audience with him at Buckingham Palace.
   Theoretically, though, she could have named someone else.
   The governing powers of the British monarchy have been assumed
by Parliament since the early 19th century, but sovereignty remains
with the throne.
   ``Under the royal powers, Major could appear at the palace to be
told by the queen that she had chosen someone else as prime
minister,'' Harold Brooks-Baker, publishing director of Burke's
Peerage, said Tuesday.
   Margaret Thatcher made her last stop as prime minister this
morning in the room on the first floor of the palace where she and
the queen had met most Tuesdays since 1979 to talk about government
business.
   About half an hour later, Major entered the room for his royal
audience.
   ``The new prime minister takes on the post from the moment of
the audience,'' said Geoffrey de Deney, clerk of the Privy Council,
a body of royal advisers.
   It is always stated that the new head of government kisses the
hands of the monarch - the head of state - and receives the seals
of office.
   But ``as the audience is private and confidential we won't know
whether there is any kissing of hands,'' de Deny said. There are no
seals of office for a prime minister and never were, he added.
   Major's salary as Prime Minister will be $131,700, up from the
$108,800 he received as chancellor of the exchequer.
   Mrs. Thatcher's salary falls to that of a rank-and-file
lawmaker, $52,600. But her husband is a millionaire.

   Unseasonably warm weather swept across the eastern third of the
nation today, breaking records set nearly 100 years ago, and snow
fell in the West.
   A strong cold front moving eastward pushed rain ahead of it and
brought cold in its wake.
   Rain fell in Chicago, Indianapolis, Memphis, Tenn., and
Louisville.
   Just after midnight Buffalo, N.Y., hit 70 degrees, breaking the
old record for the date by 2 degrees. That record was established
94 years ago.
   The forecast in the Northeast called for temperatures to climb
well into the 60s and likely top 70 degrees in New York City and as
far north as Boston.
   The Ohio Valley had temperatures in the high 60s today, and
forecasters said temperatures would plunge about 20 degrees as the
day progressed.
   In the Midwest, temperatures dropped in the 20s. Snow was
falling today in Des Moines, Iowa, and Minneapolis.
   Snow also fell in Salt Lake City.
   Rain was likely in the Pacific Northwest.

<HEAD>Widespread Clashes in Dhaka After Ershad Imposes Curfew,
Censorship</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with communications out to much of
world, Chittagong protests. No Pickup</NOTE>
<DATELINE>DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A mob armed with iron rods and knives
attacked riot police today as thousands of people defied a curfew
to protest the state of emergency declared by President Hussain
Muhammad Ershad.
   Journalists went on strike to protest press censorship and none
of the major newspapers published in Dhaka. Ershad had said reports
on the political unrest had to be approved by the Interior Ministry
before publication.
   Ershad's declaration Tuesday night suspended all civil rights
and imposed a curfew. It followed six weeks of often-violent
protests led by opposition parties who are demanding Ershad resign.
   In one confrontation on a major downtown street this morning, a
mob of 3,000 people attacked about 30 riot police. The police fired
tear gas but retreated when the crowd charged.
   Similar clashes were reported in a dozen other places in Dhaka,
a city of 7 million people. Demonstrators set piles of tires on
fire.
   In Chittagong, 125 miles southeast of Dhaka, groups of 50 to 200
people marched through the streets denouncing Ershad, residents
reported. A few people set off small homemade bombs, and police
fired tear gas.
   No injuries were reported in either city, although gunfire was
heard.
   At least 10 people have been killed and 1,000 injured in clashes
between opposition workers and supporters of the government in the
last six weeks.
   Troops in trucks and jeeps patrolled Dhaka's streets this
morning to regain control of the city.
   Communications between Bangladesh and New Delhi, Hong Kong,
London and other points went out about 12:30 p.m. (1:30 a.m. EST).
International telephone operators in New Delhi said their
counterparts in Dhaka did not respond.
   A 60-year-old former army general, Ershad took power in a 1982
bloodless coup. Opponents charge that he rigged the three
subsequent presidential and parliamentary elections to ensure
victories for himself and his Jatiya Party.
   ``I am declaring a state of emergency nationwide with immediate
effect, as destructive activities by a section of opposition
parties have threatened internal security and the national
economy,'' Ershad said in his 15-minute television address Tuesday
night to Bangladesh's 110 million people.
   The Awami League and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, the
country's two major opposition parties, have been agitating for
Ershad's resignation for years. Their campaign faded out after the
1988 parliamentary elections because of differences between them.
The two groups recently ended their dispute.
   The Awami League leader, Sheik Hasina, was placed under house
arrest Tuesday night but was freed several hours later, aide Mrinal
Kanti said.
   Kanti said that after police were withdrawn from her home, Ms.
Hasina told supporters: ``The people will defy the curfew and all
restrictions. Ershad's last days have arrived.''
   Ms. Hasina is the daughter of Bangladesh's first president,
Sheik Mujibur Rahman, who was assassinated during a military coup
in 1975.
   There was no firm word on the whereabouts of the other top
oppositiion leader, Khaleda Zia. Mrs. Zia, leader of the Bangladesh
Nationalist Party and the widow of another assassinated president,
fled her house shortly before it was raided by police Tuesday
night, her supporters said.
   Her late husband, Ziaur Rahman, was killed in 1981 during one of
the coups that became commonplace after Bangladesh broke away from
Pakistan in a 1971 civil war. In its 19 years of independence,
Bangladesh has never changed leaders through the ballot box.
   Last month, Ms. Hasina and Mrs. Zia put aside their personal
rivalries and combined forces to launch a new series of anti-Ershad
protests and strikes.
   They want Ershad to resign before the presidential elections
scheduled for June 1991 and hand over power to a caretaker
government. Ershad has declared he will seek re-election to a
second five-year term.

   Warning! Check carefully before throwing out that
wrapping paper. The dollar bills on it could be real.
   Maus &amp; Hoffman clothing stores in southern Florida has been
wrapping holiday gifts in uncut sheets of 32 genuine $1 bills for
eight years. And co-owner William Maus Jr. has grown accustomed to
a familiar lament.
   He said many a gift recipient complains: ``Oh my God, I didn't
know it was real. And that's usually after Christmas, which means
it's been ripped open or thrown away.''
   Some people ignore or simply don't believe the store's
``WARNING'' sticker attached to each package wrapped with the
dollar bills.
   The store sells the sheets for $55 - $23 over face value - and
only to customers who make a purchase.
   But the sheets are familiar holiday fare at stores throughout
the nation, said Leah Akbar, a spokeswoman for the Bureau of
Engraving and Printing in Washington.
   Bureau visitors can buy the sheets in presses of 32, 16 and four
$1 bills. They're also available by mail and sell for $47, $28 and
$10.25 respectively.
   Akbar said the price includes handling and shipping and any
profit goes toward paying workers at the bureau gift center in
Washington. Delivery takes eight to 10 weeks.

<TEXT>
   The deputy prime minister said today
President Bush should ``initiate a dialogue'' with Iraq to restore
peace in the Persian Gulf. Another official denied that Baghdad is
preventing Soviets from leaving.
   Iraq has called for dialogue with the United States previously,
but U.S. officials have said there is nothing to discuss as long as
Iraq refuses to free all foreign hostages and withdraw
unconditionally from Kuwait.
   Minister Taha Yassin Ramadan called for talks one day before the
U.N. Security Council was expected to vote on a U.S.-sponsored
resolution setting Jan. 15 as a deadline for Iraq to withdraw from
Kuwait or face possible attack.
   The ruling Baath party newspaper reiterated today Iraq's
rejection of such a resolution.
   In his remarks to an Arab Youth Solidarity conference, Ramadan
said Bush ``is leading the entire world to a ruinous war.''
   He said Bush ``has no choice other than to come to his senses
and initiate a dialogue that will allow the region to avoid the
catastrophes of war.''
   He indicated, however, that Iraq had not softened its position
on Kuwait, saying Baghdad was intent on ousting ``aggressors and
traitors'' from Arab territory.
   Iraq ``is determined to defeat the forces of evil and emerge
victorious'' if war breaks out, he said. Iraqi forces possess ``a
substantial quantity o sophisticated arms and experienced
fighters,'' he said.
   The Soviet Foreign Ministry on Monday accused Baghdad of
breaking a promise to allow hundreds of Soviets in Iraq to leave
and threatened a ``tougher attitude'' if they were not granted
freedom.
   But an Iraqi Foreign Ministry spokesman said today the ``Soviets
are working in Iraq according to contracts.''
   ``We told the Soviet officials that Iraq will allow any Soviet
to leave Iraq when his contract ends,'' he said on condition of
anonymity.
   Iraq has taken ``no illegal measures against Soviets,'' he said,
indicating that they are not hostages.
   More than 8,000 Soviets were in Iraq and Kuwait before Baghdad's
Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. Fewer than half that number remain. Many
Soviets worked in oil fields and as specialists at military
installations.
   Soviet sources in Baghdad say more than 2,000 have applied for
exit visas, but they are not getting them from Iraqi officials.
Before the gulf crisis, the Soviet Union was Baghdad's chief
weapon's supplier and a key ally.
   On Tuesday, the Soviet Union and the United States, two of the
Security Council's five permanent members, agreed to set Jan. 15 as
Iraq's deadline to pull its troops from Kuwait.
   But Al-Thawra, the official party newspaper, said today that
Security Council members supporting the latest resolution could
cause a war.
   ``The great Iraq decisively and categorically refuses to be
dictated to by anybody, whomever this could be,'' the paper said in
a front-page editorial.
   ``Those who will gather tomorrow to pass the American-dictated
resolution will be responsible for unleashing the U.S. aggression
under the flag of the United Nations,'' Al-Thawra said.

<TEXT>
   A Palestinian teen-ager today stabbed a Swedish
nurse in the back in a Gaza Strip hospital and left a note attached
to the knife that protested foreign interference in the Persian
Gulf.
   The victim was in stable condition with a wound in her shoulder,
said Dr. Tori Farsund, a Swede who is director of the Ahli Arab
Hospital in Gaza City. Police could not be reached for immediate
comment on the attack.
   Palestinian witnesses said the victim, Ingrid Idden, 28, of
Stockholm, apparently stood out as a foreigner because of her blond
hair.
   The witnesses said the attacker, a Palestinian wearing blue
jeans and a brown shirt, walked into the hospital, shouted the
Islamic war cry ``Allahu Akbar!'' - God is great - and plunged a
knife into the woman's upper back.
   The attacker fled. He was not wearing a mask over his face as
many Palestinian militants do when carrying out acts of violence,
the witnesses said. But Ms. Idden, reached by telephone later, said
she could not identify her attacker because she only saw him from
behind as he fled.
   She said she was unsure whether she would return to Sweden.
   The attack followed leaflets from the Moslem fundamentalist
group Hamas, or zeal, condemning the foreign presence in the gulf
region. The United States has gathered a coalition of Western and
Arab countries against Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   The attacker's note began with the opening lines of Moslem
prayers - ``In the name of God, most gracious, most merciful...''
   It said in black ink: ``The knight of Al Aqsa claims
responsibility for the stabbing attack in revenge for foreign
interference in the gulf. This is the beginning of bigger attacks
against foreign tourists.
   ``The knight of Al Aqsa does not belong to any faction,'' it
added.
   The reference was to Jerusalem's Al Aqsa mosque, one of the
holiest landmarks of Islam and the site of riots last month in
which 17 Palestinians were killed by Israeli police gunfire.
   Farsund said he believed it was the first such attack on a
foreigner in the hospital, which has treated thousands of wounded
Palestinians during the 3-year-old uprising against Israeli
occupation of Gaza and the West Bank.

   A truck carrying more than $5 million worth of art
works, including paintings by Rubens and Watteau, was stolen during
the night while its driver and guards were at a cafe, police said
today.
   Investigators said the art works included more than 600 ceramic
works and about 50 paintings and drawings by Dutch, French and
Belgian masters, including Jean Antoine Watteau, Peter Paul Rubens
and Jean Honore Fragonard.
   Police estimated the value of the works at $5.6 million. At
least some of the items were owned by Gersaint, a French
corporation.
   The works had been loaded onto the truck at the close of an
exhibition at a luxury Paris hotel, and were to be taken to the
eastern city of Strasbourg for a major art sale there Thursday and
Friday.
   The truck was stolen while the driver and four co-workers were
getting a drink in a cafe late Tuesday night, police said.
   No arrests were reported as of this afternoon.

<HEAD>Striking Railroad Employees Resume Passenger Service</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Passenger rail service resumed in eastern Germany
today, but striking rail employees kept nearly 500 freight trains
waiting at the former nation's borders, officials said.
   Bargainers for the Union of German Rail Workers and the rail
system, the Reichsbahn, resumed talks today aimed at ending the
walkout.
   The union promised late Tuesday to resume passenger service, but
continued to halt freight service. Reichsbahn spokesman Joachim
Miethling said up to 500 freight trains were standing idle at the
formrr East Germany's borders.
   But passenger service was only running slightly behind schedule,
he said.
   The union's decision to resume at least partial service came in
the wake of growing public resentment of the strike. Most eastern
Germans do not have cars and must rely on rail transport to visit
other cities.
   About 260,000 Reichsbahn employees went on strike Monday after
negotiations with the rail system broke down.
   Strike leaders fear up to 68,000 workers in the five new eastern
states will be laid off as the Reichsbahn undergoes capitalist
restructuring. The strikers are demanding protection against
widespread layoffs and pay increases.
   The strike was the first major labor dispute since the two
Germanys unified Oct. 3, and some experts fear it could begin
widespread labor unrest.
   The former Communist country, making a swift transition to the
free market, is expected to experience nearly 50 percent
unemployment next year as former state-run enterprises collapse in
the face of Western competition.

<HEAD>Mother says Only Prayers, Not Doctor, Could Have Saved Son</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AMITE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman accused of negligent homicide in the
death of her leukemia-stricken son told police she never took the
boy to a doctor because it was up to God to heal him, according to
a tape played in court.
   The tape, played Tuesday, contained a conversation between
Anneta Williamson, 43, and police Detective Tim Oliver shortly
after the death of her 5-year-old son, Don.
   Coroner Vincent Cefalu testified that the boy died of acute
lymphocytic leukemia in June 1989.
   He said there is a 70-75 percent chance of the disease going
into remission when chemotherapy is administered.
   Mrs. Williamson, 43, has said she relied only on prayers to save
her son, who had not been seen by a doctor since the day he was
born. She is a member of the Oak Grove Church of God, which
believes in faith healing.
   Her lawyer, Michael Thiel, maintained she is innocent under a
1985 state law that recognizes religious healing in cases involving
children.
   If convicted by the six-member District Court jury, she faces a
maximum sentence of five years in prison and a $5,000 fine.
   About 50 members of her church packed the small courtroom
Tuesday. Several wept as they listened to the recording of Oliver
asking Mrs. Williamson whether a doctor could have saved her son.
   ``No sir,'' she replied.
   ``Did you believe it was God's will that he die?,'' Oliver
asked.
   ``Yes, sir,'' Mrs. Williamson said. ``I loved my son. He was
very precious to me. I prayed and I fasted and I looked to the Lord
to heal him. But he had other plans.''

<HEAD>Official Report Says Bulgaria's Premier Will Step Down</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with Lukanov saying report is premature
but not denying it, new details on strike. No pickup.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By VESELIN TOSHKOV</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The official BTA news agency said today
that Andrei Lukanov will resign as premier. He told journalists the
report was premature, but did not directly deny it.
   BTA said it learned from a source close to President Zhelyu
Zhelev that Lukanov - a Socialist who took office in February -
would be replaced by a politician who is a member of neither the
Socialist Party nor the main opposition Union of Democratic Forces.
   Such an agreement could put an end to repeated protests in
Bulgaria against Lukanov's government of former Communists, and end
a political stalemate that has blocked action to remedy the
country's severe economic problems.
   Lukanov, a former Communist turned reformer, became increasingly
unpopular as Bulgaria faced its worst economic crisis since World
War II.
   Electricity, many foodstuffs and consumer goods are rationed or
simply unavailable in Sofia and throughout this Balkan country of 9
million people. The country cannot make the payments on its $11
billion foreign debt.
   Early today, police beat students who barred a main intersection
in the capital and a general strike called by the Podkrepa trade
union entered its third day. The strike, called to bring down the
Lukanov government, appeared to be gaining momentum.
   BTA reported it had learned a deal would be announced later
today giving Bulgaria a new caretaker Cabinet and a new premier.
There was no independent confirmation of the report.
   Lukanov did not deny a deal was being worked out, but he said
the composition of a new government had not yet been discussed.
   ``I hope this will happen soon because the current situation
must not continue,'' he told reporters in Sofia.
   He reiterated that the country needs a coalition government and
calm negotiations. Lukanov previously has tried to draw the
opposition into a coalition headed by Socialists.
   The premier last week survived a no-confidence vote in
parliament and won approval of his austerity budget after the
opposition walked out of the chamber. He had threatened to resign
if the budget was not approved, but said he could not be heckled
into quitting.
   President Zhelev brought together Socialist and opposition
leaders on Tuesday to work out a compromise. Spokesmen for the
Socialists and the opposition coalition said on Tuesday they have
agreed to set up a panel to work out a timetable for enacting key
economic laws and a new constitution.
   This morning, riot police confronted protesters on Eagles
Bridge, where about 2,000 demonstrators gathered to demand
Lukanov's resignation, shouting ``Lukanov resign!'' and ``This will
continue every day!''
   Two student protesters were arrested and one policeman was
injured in the clash, Sofia radio reported. A doctor said the
arrested students also were injured.
   About 200 students formed a human chain across the bridge at 7
a.m., bringing rush hour traffic to a standstill.
   The blockade was joined by stranded bus passengers and workers,
and sympathetic drivers parked four trolley buses across the
bridge. Many protesters wore blue armbands, the color of the Union
of Democratic Forces.
   Riot police arrived at the bridge, using shields to clear a path
and driving away one parked bus. Officers beat a few dozen
protesters with batons after the demonstrators pressed forward to
try to stop a second bus from being removed. After brief scuffles,
police and demonstrators retreated.
   A police spokesman told the radio the bridge was cleared by 10
a.m., adding strikers also tried to stop trams and buses in other
parts of the capital.
   Dr. Nedelcho Terdiski said the two arrested students were
brought to his hospital from Sofia central police station with
injuries apparently caused by beatings, the radio reported.
   Mayor Alexander Karakachanov, also interviewed on radio,
described the police intervention as ``impermissible.'' He promised
``strict measures'' would be taken against any officers found
guilty of beating detainees.
   The general strike appeared to gain strength today.
   The national airline Balkan suspended all flights because of the
strike, radio reports said, and striking teachers thronged the
Education Ministry in the capital. Miners from the town of Pernik
arrived in Sofia to demonstrate.
   Radi and television workers announced they supported the strike
but would continue to broadcast the news.
   Podkrepa said on Tuesday that 790,000 Bulgarians took part in
the general strike, including 220,000 in Sofia.
   BTA reported 500,000 workers - about 11 percent of the work
force - were on strike Tuesday. The government said only one worker
out of 100 struck.
   Also today, The New York Times published an interview with Todor
Zhivkov, the Communist dictator who ruled Bulgaria for 35 years
until being forced out in 1989. He said Bulgaria should have allied
itself with the West long ago.
   ``The nation is on the verge of self-destruction, national
suicide,'' he said. ``It doesn't matter anymore whether the system
is called socialism or capitalism.''

<HEAD>Lawmakers Reject Election Changes Backed by Pro-Democracy
Activists</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN POMFRET</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The legislature today rejected a bid to make
Hong Kong's election laws more liberal, and some activists said the
move would make it easier for China to break a promise of self-rule
for the territory.
   The activists fear if the democracy does not gain root in Hong
Kong before Beijing assumes control in 1997, China will easily be
able to break its promise allowing the territory to rule itself for
50 years.
   Lawmakers rebuffed attempts to lower the territory's voting age
to 18 and establish an independent election commission. Also
rejected were calls to allow the use of names of political parties
on ballot sheets and absentee balloting.
   The actions came as the legislature, known as the Legislative
Council, passed a law designed to ready the territory for its first
direct elections of the legislature next year. More than half of
the lawmakers in the body, largely considered a rubber stamp for
government policies, are government appointees.
   ``Rather than seek to develop the institutions and practices
that will enable Hong Kong people to rule Hong Kong, the government
has sought to stifle the development of democratic institutions,''
lawmaker Martin Lee during a sometimes heated debate today.
   Lee and two other lawmakers in the 56-member body had sought the
amendments to the election bill in a last-ditch effort to bring
Hong Kong's election law in line with those of most Western
democracies.
   In Britain, for example, the voting age is 18. In Australia, an
independent election commission helps decide critical issues such
as the boundaries of constituencies. Most Western nations also
allow absentee balloting.
   In Hong Kong, voters have to be 21 years or older. All critical
issues regarding the election are decided by the colonial
government and absentee voting is prohibited.
   In the direct elections for the Legislative Council next year,
18 of the legislature's then-60 seats will be chosen by direct
vote. The remaining seats will either be appointed by the
government or elected by special interest groups, such as teachers
and businessmen.
   The Hong Kong government has said it opposed the amendments
because it did not have enough time to consider them. The
government has been working on its election law since February
1988.
   Lee and other activists have charged, however, that the
government has fought the amendments because they would make Hong
Kong more democratic.
   They say Hong Kong's most politically active generation is
between 18 and 21 years old, and the colonial government does not
want to give them the vote.

   Interior Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble, using
a wheelchair, today attended his first Cabinet meeting since an
assailant shot him six weeks ago.
   ``It is a happy day,'' said Chancellor Helmut Kohl, welcoming
the 48-year-old Schaeuble.
   Kohl said he would offer Schaeuble a Cabinet post if the
Christian Democrats win Sunday's elections as expected.
   Schaeuble, who had been mentioned as a possible successor to
Kohl as chancellor, still wears a bandage on his jaw where one
bullet hit him. The other bullet struck his spinal cord, and his
legs are paralyzed.
   Television showed pictures of him propelling his wheelchair
around the chancellery.
   The accused gunman, Dieter Kaufmann, was said by authorities to
have a history of drug abuse and mental problems. Kaufmann, 37, is
in custody, but has not yet been charged in the Oct. 12 shooting at
an election rally.
   On Thursday, Schaeuble and Kohl plan to attend a rally in
Baden-Wuerttemberg state in southwestern Germany to thank those who
offered Schaeuble help and support after the shooting.
   Schaeuble had won praise for his skillful negotiation of the
wide-ranging treaty that created the legal framework for the
unification of the two Germanys.

   A piece of a B-17 bomber buried for 48
years in the Greenland icecap was presented today to the woman
whose name was painted on the piece of metal by her pilot husband
before he flew off to fight the Nazis.
   Explorers who found the bomber buried in the arctic icecap
presented the keepsake to Phyllis Arlene Hanna this morning at
Peachtree-DeKalb Airport north of Atlanta.
   In return, Mrs. Hanna of St. Louis gave keys to the plane
Tuesday to the explorers who set out nine years ago to locate eight
American warplanes that crash-landed in Greenland in July 1942 on
their way to England.
   The two B-17s and six P-38 Lightning fighters ran out of fuel
after receiving false radio transmissions from German submarines.
The crews camped for nine days until rescuers arrived on dog sled.
   One of those rescued was Mrs. Hanna's husband, Joe D. Hanna Jr.,
who had painted her name under his cckpit window. Hanna died in
1981, the year the Greenland Expedition Society was formed to find
and maybe even fly the planes out.
   ``They've been in my basement 48 years,'' Mrs. Hanna said of the
keys. ``I'd much rather have a piece of the plane with my name on
it.''
   The expedition, which raised donations, located the bomber with
radar in 1988 and used a borer to cut a 3{-foot-wide hole and take
the piece with Mrs. Hanna's name on it. Last summer, the explorers
cut a much larger cavern 20 feet long on one side.
   The fuselage of the bomber was found to have collapsed under the
weight of 250 feet of ice. Movement within the glacier had broken
it apart.
   ``It was, of course a disappointment,'' said Pat Epps,
co-founder of the expedition. Explorers removed the top turret of
the B-17 and two machine guns, ammunition, instruments and other
memorabilia.
   ``The B-17 is certainly not flyable,'' said Epps. ``We expect
when the P-38s are excavated, they would not be flyable from the
icecap.''
   Because of technical problems and water from the glacier filling
their hole as fast as they could pump it out, the expedition didn't
get to a fighter.
   ``Next year, we are giving our full attention to the P-38,''
Epps said.

   Three Americans and 10 Britons left Amman
for Europe today, one day after being freed by Iraqi authorities,
and 77 Italians left Baghdad aboard an Iraqi Airways flight.
   Five freed Germans were also preparing to leave Jordan for home.
And six of the 47 Canadians held in Iraq and Kuwati will be freed,
Robert Cordett, a member of Canada's Parliament, said in Baghdad.
   Meanwhile, Britain's Foreign Office said today that 55 Britons
detained in Baghdad have been moved to strategic sites in Iraq.
There are about 500 Britons hiding in Kuwait and about 350 being
held at strategic sites in Iraq.
   In Iraq, President Saddam Hussein today directed his Parliament
to discuss freeing Belgian hostages. And an Iraqi official denied
that Baghdad was stopping Soviets from leaving.
   The Americans and their families were flying to Frankfurt aboard
a Royal Jordanian flight. Another Royal Jordanian flight for London
took off shoftly afterward carrying the 10 former British hostages
and their families.
   The freed Europeans and Americans had been held at strategic
sites to deter attack by the multinational forces that assembled in
the Persian Gulf after Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.
   About 2,000 Westerners remain captive and many are belived in
hiding in the occupied emirate.
   The five Germans, who were in hiding before emerging Saturday to
take advantage of an Iraqi decision to free all German nationals,
were to fly to Frankfurt aboard a Lufthansa flight Thursday,
according to the German Embassy.
   The Italian Embassy said the Italians would leave for Rome
aboard a chartered Alitalia jetliner shortly after arriving in
Amman.
   The Britons and Americans were released after their families
flew to Baghdad and appealed to Saddam to free them.
   The State Department, which has said Iraq should free all
hostages unconditionally, warned American relatives of hostages not
to travel to Iraq, saying they could become hostages themselves or
play into the hands of Iraqi propagandists. The British government
took a similar stance.
   But Briton Dorothy Goodwin, 55, whose husband, Peter, was a
pilot with Kuwait Airways, said she did not feel her group had been
manipulated by the Iraqis.
   Mrs. Goodwin expressed concern on the plight of men currently
held at Iraqi military sites.
   ``I saw men aboslutely breaking down. Others went into pieces to
make phone calls to their families. Others were ashamed to cry in
front of you. It was a tragic situation,'' she said.
   The freed Americans are John Stevenson of Panama City, Fla;
Clyde Jesse of Buffalo Grove, Ill.; and Fred Harrington of
Bellevue, Wash.
   Stevenson, a computer specialist who worked in Kuwait for 11
years, was freed after his twin, Mary Trundy of Brockton, Mass.,
and his brothers, Bill Stevenson of Panama City, and James
Stevenson of Sarasota, Fla., visited Baghdad.
   Harringon was freed when his son, Vala Fouroohi, flew to
Baghdad.
   Jesse's wife, Honey, also flew to Baghdad.
   Saddam has offered to free foreigners in exchange for guarantees
he will not be attacked. On Nov. 18, he offered to free all
foreigners between Dec. 25 and March 25 provided no hostilities
break out.
   He has released hostges on a piecemeal basis, in reponse to
pleas from visiting dignitaries from several nations. Washington
has condemned the sporadic releases as aimed at dividing the
alliance arrayed against Iraq.
   Today, the official Iraqi News Agency said Saddam had decided
Parliament should discuss the status of Belgian hostages, the
mechanism used in the past for freeing French, Bulgarians, Swedes,
Swiss and others.
   The report did not specify how many of the about 30 Belgians in
Iraq and Kuwait would be set free. INA said the measure came in
response to statements made by the Belgian government about finding
a peaceful solution to the crisis.
   The Soviet Foreign Ministry on Monday accused Baghdad of
breaking a promise to allow hundreds of Soviets in Iraq to leave
and threatened a ``tougher attitude'' if they were not granted
freedom.
   But an Iraqi Foreign Ministry spokesman said today the Soviets
were fulfilling work contracts in Iraq and would be allowed to
leave when the contracts were up.
   More than 8,000 Soviets were in Iraq and Kuwait before the
invasion. Fewer than half that number remain.

   A cushion of warmth pushing across the eastern United States
today brought spring-like weather to areas more accustomed to snow
this time of year.
   A record high was set as far north as Concord, N.H., this
morning and golfers in that state were checking out courses that
are usually frozen this time of year. Detroit hit another record
high for the second day in a row.
   Record highs in the 80s were reached in the Southeast on Tuesday
and highs close to 70 set new marks as far north as Buffalo, N.Y.,
where the mercury hit 69.
   ``Buffalo's reputation of being the first to be the coldest
didn't work out this time,'' said meteorologist Don Paul. The
previous high in Buffalo for Nov. 27 was 68, set in 1896. Highs
near 70 were again forecast for today in upstate New York.
   Beckley, W.Va., set a record for a second straight day today
when the temperature at the Raleigh County Memorial Airport climbed
to 67 degrees, breaking the mark of 66 set in 1983, the weather
service said. Beckley's 74 degrees Tuesday smashed the record 68
degrees set in 1966.
   In Charleston, where temperatures hit 84 degrees Tuesday,
breaking the record of 77 set in 1927, some holiday shoppers fussed
about the weather.
   ``I love Christmas. I just want some snow,'' said Missy
Frerichs, 32, of St. Albans, W.Va. ``I want some mittens. I want
some Christmas songs.''
   After more hot weather today, daytime highs in the 40s were
expected to return to the Appalachians by Thursday, meteorologist
Ray Young said.
   Detroit set a new record of 68 degrees early today, breaking the
63-degree mark set in 1960, the weather service said. Muskegon's
62-degree reading eclipsed a record of 61, also from 1960, Sault
Ste. Marie's 55 degrees topped a 1934 mark of 50 and Traverse
City's 61 degrees tied a 1960 mark.
   The heat wasn't expected to hold up today in Michigan.
Forecasters said temperatures would plunge about 20 degrees.
Detroit broke a 94-year-old record Tuesday with a high of 66.
   Highs near 70 were forecast as far north as Boston today.
Florida and coastal Georgia and South Carolina were expected to
have highs in the 80s, while peaks in the 60s were likely through
lower Maine.
   Rich Thibeault, a golf pro at the Charmingfare Country Club in
Candia, N.H., near Manchester, said he fielded a lot of calls
Wednesday morning from golfers asking about the conditions. It was
60 degrees in Manchester at 10 a.m.
   It was 62 degrees in Concord, N.H., at 11 a.m., breaking a
record of 61 set in 1959 and matched in 1979. Forecasts said it
would hit 70.
   ``Normally, the ground is frozen. If you hit a shot into the
green, it jumps higher than the flagpole and off the green. It's
like bouncing on concrete,'' Thibeault said. ``This has been a real
bonus month.''

<TEXT>
   A federal judge today lifted his ban against Cable
News Network's broadcast of Manuel Noriega's prison phone calls to
his legal team.
   The ban on CNN's use of the tape had sparked a fierce
constitutional debate, pitting the right of free speech against the
right to a fair trial.
   ``The tapes may be published as CNN wishes to publish them,''
said U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler during a morning hearing.
   Noriega's attorney Frank Rubino said he no longer had any
objection to CNN's use of the tapes. The only tape he challenged
was a conversation between Noriega and his defense team which had
already been broadcast by CNN.
   ``It does no good to close the barn door after the horse is
out,'' Rubino said today.
   The judge also ordered the federal Bureau of Prisons to stop its
practice of sharing tape-recorded conversations in the Noriega case
with other government agencies.
   Hoeveler last month temporarily barred CNN from using parts of
taped conversations between Noriega and his attorneys, who said
airing the tapes would destroy the ousted Panamanian dictator's
defense against drug charges.
   CNN broadcast some tapes, including a conversation between
Noriega and Rubino's secretary, who acted as a translator for
Rubino's investigator.
   An appeals court and the U.S. Supreme Court refused to lift the
order, and CNN last week turned over the tapes it had obtained to
Hoeveler for review.
   In Atlanta, CNN spokesman Steve Haworth said it was doubtful
that CNN would broadcast any of the tapes today.
   Rubino, after the hearing, said he still intended to ask for
contempt penalties against CNN for airing the tapes despite
Hoeveler's order.
   Steven Korn, attorney for CNN parent Turner Broadcasting System
Inc., said the network contended from the beginning that prior
restraint was wrong.
   ``It's fizzled. No prior restraint is ever appropriate,'' Korn
said outside the courtroom. He also said he considered the contempt
issue moot.
   Korn emphasized the judge's order to the Bureau of Prisons,
saying that was the correct approach to dealing with the taping of
Noriega's phone calls.
   Noreiga, who is awaiting trial on charges of taking $4.6 million
in payoffs to protect cocaine trade through Panama, is being held
in a federal prison near Miami. Federal prison authorities monitor
and tape record all inmates' telephone conversations except those
between inmates and their lawyers.
   The government has maintained that Noriega knew the calls were
being taped and that the calls were not protected by the
attorney-client privelege.
   Information from the Noriega tapes already is in the hands of at
least one additional party, the government of Panama, according to
an affidavit filed Tuesday by that nation's attorney in the United
States, Gregory Craig.
   The affidavit sought to persuade another judge hearing Panama's
$6.5 billion racketeering lawsuit against the deposed dictator to
freeze all Noriega's assets.
   Craig refused to disclose how he obtained information about the
taped conversations, but the affidavit appeared to include
information not broadcast by CNN.
   Noriega's attorneys have alleged that the U.S. government made
the tapes and supplied them to Panama, which in turn leaked them to
CNN, but Craig refused to comment.
   The affidavit said tapes of Noriega's calls show that ``while in
custody, he has been using the telephone for the purpose of moving
assets wrongfully obtained by him that are the property of the
republic of Panama.''
   Noriega spoke on the tapes to his daughter Sandra Noriega, his
mistress Vicki Amado, his mistress's mother and seven others,
including former pro-Noriega presidential candidate Carlos Duque,
the documents said.
   Noriega ``directed and continues to direct the movement of
assets'' from Hong Kong, Israel, Singapore, Australia and Brazil;
the funds were moved to banks in Europe as well as through Costa
Rica to Panama, Craig said.
   Craig would not say how much money was involved in the taped
conversations, but added, ``We've said from the beginning that we
think there is $300 million to $500 million of assets out there.''
   Noriega's attorney in the civil case, Stephen Zukoff, disputed
the legality of Craig's affidavit during hearing Tuesday before
U.S. District Judge Edward Davis, who is presiding over the civil
case. ``I don't know where he's getting his information from - he
certainly should have identified it,'' Zukoff said.
   He said he could not discuss whether the information was
accurate without examining it further.
   During the hearing, John Kester, another attorney for Panama,
noted the tapes appeared to show Noriega was moving money from one
account to another while telling Hoeveler he had no assets and
could not pay his attorneys.
   ``He can't have it both ways,'' Kester said.
   Hoeveler has said he will appoint government-paid defense
attorneys if the fee dispute is not settled soon.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain and Syria today restored diplomatic
relations, severed four years ago when Britain accused Syria of
sponsoring terrorism, the two governments announced.
   Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd told the House of Commons that
Britain had received assurances from the Syrian government that it
rejects acts of international terrorism and will take action
against convicted terrorists.
   The resumption of ties was also announced in Damascus.
   A communique carried by the official Syrian Arab News Agency
said the heads of interest sections in the respective capitals
would be elevated immediately to the post of charge d'affaires.
   The Syrian communique confirmed that the Damascus government
renounced terrorism, but added: ``Syria does not consider
resistance against Israeli occupation as terrorism.''
   The Syrian government said Britain had pledged to try to resolve
the Arab-Israeli dispute, support the Syrian-backed government in
Lebanon and work to improve ties between Damascus and the rest of
Europe.
   Hurd told British lawmakers the Syrians had promised to continue
``strenuous efforts'' to obtain the release of the 13 Western
hostages believed held by pro-Iranian extremists in Lebanon.
   Syria is the main power broker in Lebanon, with 40,000 troops
based there under an Arab League mandate. It helped obtain the
release of Americans Robert Polhill and Frank Reed in April and
Irishman Brian Keenan in August.
   The Syrian government newspaper Tishrin said earlier this month
that Britain should resume relations with Syria if it wanted the
remaining captives freed. They are six Americans, four Britons, two
Germans and an Italian.
   Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The
Associated Press, was taken hostage March 16, 1985, and is the
longest-held captive.
   The restoration of ties follows recent meetings in Damascus
between British lawmakers and a Foreign Office official and Syrian
President Hafez Assad and his foreign minister, Farouk al-Sharaa.
   Britain severed relations with Syria in October 1986, hours
after a London jury convicted Jordanian Nezar Hindawi of attempting
to bomb an El Al jet departing London's Heathrow Airport with 375
people aboard on April 17, 1986.
   The 32-year-old Hindawi, who planted plastic explosives in the
hand luggage of his pregnant Irish fiancee, was sentenced to 45
years in prison.
   Britain said Hindawi acted on orders from Syrian intelligence,
traveled on a Syrian passport and met Syrian Ambassador Loutfallah
Haydar at the Syrian Embassy after the bomb plot was uncovered.
   Syrian denied any involvement in terrorism on British soil.
   Hurd said today that Britain had received ``confidential account
of the Syrian position on the Hindawi affair.'' He did not
elaborate.
   Lebanon has represented Syrian interests in Britain, while
Australia has represented Britain's interests in Syria since the
ties were severed.
   Britain's improved relations follow a similar move by the United
States.
   U.S.-Syrian ties improved this summer when Damascus sided with
the alliance against Saddam Hussein following Iraq's Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait. Syria has committed nearly 20,000 troops to a
military buildup in the Persian Gulf.
   Syria is on a State Department's list of countries that sponsor
terrorism. But Secretary of State James A. Baker III visited
Damascus in September, and President Bush met with Assad in Geneva
last week.

   President Bush will meet with Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir on Dec. 11 at the White House, spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater announced today.
   He said Shamir will be in Washington on a private visit and Bush
will receive him for talks.
   The visit comes during a time of Israeli concern over increased
U.S. alliances with Arab nations in the face of the Persian Gulf
crisis. The Bush administration has courted some of Israel's
staunch enemies, including Syria, in lining up the coalition of
nations opposing Iraq's invasion of its neighbor Kuwait.
   However, Bush and other U.S. officials have insisted that U.S.
friendship and loyalty toward Israel has not diminished.

   The Oak Ridge National Laboratory has
collected data on global warming from around the world and
published it in a single volume.
   Studies from 60 researchers at 20 institutions have been
included in ``Trends 90: A Compendium of Data on Global Change.''
   The volume ``is an effort to provide timely data to a
multidisciplinary audience of researchers, policy-makers,
information specialists, environmental professionals and
educators,'' said Paul Kanciruk, director of Oak Ridge's Carbon
Dioxide Information Analysis Center.
   The first two chapters deal with historical levels of carbon
dioxide in the atmosphere and global emissions of the gas from
various sources.
   Carbon dioxide, a colorless, odorless gas, is a major focus of
the so-called greenhouse warming problem. Scientists fear carbon
dioxide and other gases will increasingly trap heat from the sun,
causing the temperature of the planet to rise and possibly changing
weather patterns and damaging crops.
   The third section of the book compiles information about a
second gas, methane. The final portion is a collection global and
regional temperature records.
   Data comes from the Soviet Arctic and Antarctic Research
Institute, Canadian Atmospheric Environment Service, Commonwealth
Scientific and Industrial Research Organization of Australia,
Fraunhofer Institute for Atmospheric Research in Germany, the
French Laboratory for Environmental Glaciology and Geophysics, U.S.
National Aeronautics and Space Administration, National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and the
Italian Meteorological Service.
   Data also was compiled and provided by Ciudad Universitaria,
Madrid, Spain; Oregon Graduate Institute of Science and Technology;
Scripps Institution of Oceanography, University of Bern,

<HEAD>Filipino Vets to Get Citizenship, But Poorest May Be Left Out</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of Filipino World War II veterans
will be eligible for U.S. citizenship under a new immigration law,
but the poorest may not be able to afford to take advantage of the
offer.
   It has not been decided whether Filipino veterans may obtain
citizenship without making a costly trip to the United States.
   The Justice Department favors a plan requiring that citizenship
be granted only in the United States. Immigration officials have
five months to draw up the rules for applying.
   The provision, part of a sweeping immigration bill President
Bush is expected to sign Thursday, would take effect May 1 and give
veterans - including guerrilla fighters - two years to apply for
citizenship.
   ``This bill is a first step toward truly recognizing the
contributions of the veterans and fulfilling our World War II
promise,'' said Rep. Mervyn Dymally, D-Calif., who had been trying
for six years to get the law enacted.
   The law does not deal with the issue of veterans' benefits
claimed by Filipinos.
   Dymally contends denial of the claims is unjust, and that
payment should be ``based on service within the armed forces, and
not nationality.''
   Many of the veterans were called to duty as part of U.S. forces
when the Philippines was an American colony. The United States
recognized Philippine independence in 1946.
   More than half the 200,000 Filipinos who fought the four-year
Japanese occupation were killed. Filipino veterans group estimate
that about 50,000 veterans, most of them living in the Philippines,
may be eligible for citizenship.
   The fight for recognition by Filipino veterans dates to 1942
when those who served in U.S. forces were left out of the
implementation of a new citizenship law. Immigration agents
couldn't enter the occupied country.
   That law gave citizenship to aliens serving in U.S. forces, but
it expired in 1946 without being applied to Filipinos. The newly
independent Philippine government was trying to reduce the flow of
emigrants to America.
   Courts since have ruled that citizenship should be given to
Filipino veterans, but the Supreme Court said it would take an act
of Congress.
   The new law, affecting only Filipino World War II veterans,
would grant citizenship to those who fought in the U.S. forces as
well as those who were part of the elite Philippine Scouts or any
recognized guerrilla group.
   ``It is only sad to see that these brave men who were willing to
sacrifice their lives in defense of the United States of America
were forced to wait over 40 years until our promise of citizenship
to them is fulfilled,'' said Dymally, whose legislative district
includes thousands of Filipino Americans.
   Filipinos are behind only Mexico in emigration to the United
States, making them the largest and fastest-growing Asian minority
in America.

   Text of the statement by Prime Minister John Major
following his confirmation in office Wednesday:
   ``May I say firstly that I am extremely grateful for the trust
that my Parliamentary colleagues have put in me and for the
tremendous support that we have already had from so many people up
and down the country. I hope in the next few years that I will be
able to prove that that trust is justified.
   ``I am grateful also for the enormous achievements that I
inherit from Margaret Thatcher. I think history will record that
she was a towering prime minister who left her country in a far
better condition that she found it 11 years ago. I hope in the next
few years to build on those achievements.
   ``I certainly hope in those years to build a society of
opportunity, by that I mean an open society, a society in which
what people fulfill will depend upon their talent, their
application and their good fortune. What people achieve should
depend particularly upon those things and I hope increasingly in
the future that that will be the case.
   ``I believe very firmly in the 1990s that we will have a decade
of the most remarkable opportunities. We have soon the full opening
and the flowering of the single market in Europe.
   ``We have seen in the last few years the remarkable ending of
the Cold War and the bringing together of nations in a fashion that
which no one would have imagined just a few years ago. We have in
front of us the building and development of an entirely new Europe,
a building and development in which this country will play a full
and leading role.
   ``In the past week we have seen openly and publicly the uniting
of the Conservative Party. I would like to express again my thanks
to all members of the party and particularly Douglas Hurd and
Michael Heseltine for the enormous contributions they have made
during the leadership contest to ensure that the party can remain
united for the future. There is no ill-feeling at the end of this
contest, at the end of this week for the leadership of the
Conservative Party, at the end of this week I believe that there is
a smile on the face of the party that will mean we are fully united
for the future.
   ``I hope in the next few years that we will carry on with much
of the work that has been done in the last few years. In particular
I want to build a country that is at ease with itself, a country
that is confident and a country that is prepared and willing to
make the changes necessary to provide a better quality of life for
all our citizens.
   ``I don't promise you that it will be easy and I don't promise
you that it will be quick, but I believe it is an immensely
worthwhile job to do. Because it will be neither easy nor quick, if
you forgive me, I will go into No. 10 straight away and make a
start right now. Thank you very much indeed.''

   Smokers will no longer be allowed to light up on
London's red double-decker buses, transportation officials said
Wednesday.
   Smoking, only allowed in the rear seats on the top deck of the
buses, will be banned as of Feb. 14, said a spokesman at London
Transport, the government agency that oversees London's buses and
subway system.
   The agency said surveys have shown that 73 percent of Londoners
want a ban. Only a third of the people using London's 5,000 buses
are smokers, and of those fewer than three in five actually smoke
on board, the agency said.
   ``We hope London will welcome the ban on smoking because buses
will be cleaner, healthier and safer,'' said London Buses managing
director Clive Hodson.
   London Transport banned smoking on the subway system after 31
people were killed and 80 injured in a subway station fire in
November 1987.

<TEXT>
   Germany on Sunday holds its first free
elections in a united country since 1932. Here at a glance are some
issues and statistical data:
   AT STAKE: 656 seats in a united parliament, 328 directly chosen
in their districts and 328 from party lists; head of government, or
chancellor. Also, a city council will be elected for Berlin, the
new capital of united Germany.
   GETTING IN: A party needs at least 5 percent of the vote to win
seats in the Bundestag, the lower house of parliament. However, the
constitutional court has decided that vote counts will be separate
for former West Germany and East Germany. The ruling favors parties
whose main following is in former East Germany, allowing them to
get into parliament if they clear 5 percent of the vote just in the
former Communist nation.
   NUMBER OF ELIGIBLE VOTERS: 59.9 million - 47.9 million from
former West Germany and 12 million from former East Germany.
   NUMBER OF VOTING DISTRICTS: 328.
   NUMBER OF CANDIDATES: 3,969.
   NUMBER OF PARTIES: 23.
   MAIN PARTIES:
   -Christian Democratic Union, CDU, and its sister party, the
Bavarian Christian Social Union, CSU. A center-right alliance that
is heading the current government coalition of Chancellor Helmut
Kohl.
   -Social Democratic Party, SPD. The main opposition party,
leftist.
   -Free Democratic Party, FDP, liberal party of the center, the
junior coalition partner in the current government, whose most
prominent member is popular Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich
Genscher.
   -Greens, a leftist, ecology-oriented party, which is running in
the election on a joint list with Alliance 90, a similar group in
former East Germany.
   -Party of Democratic Socialism, PDS, the leftist, renamed party
of the former East German Communists, hoping for support mainly in
former East Germany.
   -Republicans, ultra-rightist.
   TOP CANDIDATES: Helmut Kohl, 60, CDU leader and incumbent
chancellor, seeking his third four-year term. Oskar Lafontaine, 47,
SPD, governor of Saarland state. The chancellor is picked by the
party that wins the most seats, or in coalition talks.
   VOTING: Polls open at 8 a.m. (2 a.m. EST) and close at 6 p.m.
(noon EST). First, highly accurate, computer projections are
expected minutes after polls close, with official results late
Sunday or early Monday.
   POLLS: Latest polls by the three leading institutes have the
following projections, with 1987 results in parentheses:
   -CDU: Between 43.4 percent and 45.5 percent (44.3).
   -SPD: Between 31.4 percent and 35 percent (37).
   -FDP: Between 9 percent and 9.9 percent (9.1).
   -GREENS: Between 6.5 percent and 11 percent, together with
Alliance 90 (8.3).
   -PDS: Between 1 percent and 2 percent overall, but could benefit
from the ruling that allows it to enter Parliament with 5 percent
of the vote in former East Germany.
   -Republicans: Between 1 percent and 2 percent (did not run in
all districts in last election).
   CAMPAIGN: Has been low key with Kohl enjoying such wide support
in polls that few doubt he will win re-election. By forging ahead
full speed for a quick unification and achieving it on Oct. 3, Kohl
made himself more popular than ever, particularly in former East
German states. Lafontaine, who barely survived an assassination
attept by a deranged woman in April, has made soaring unification
costs his main theme.

   There were no parades, no brass bands and no
inaugural balls when power changed hands in Britain on Wednesday.
   The people who came to see the changing of the guard at
Buckingham Palace saw only a glimpse of the changing of the prime
ministers.
   Margaret Thatcher was due first on a chilly, damp morning,
bringing her resignation to Queen Elizabeth II. John Major, Mrs.
Thatcher's successor as prime minister, was due afterward.
   The Guards' Division sentries were doing their duty in the
forecourt, in long coats, tall busbies and automatic rifles. The
royal standard, armorial banner of the queen, flew at the masthead
to show the monarch was in residence.
   On the wide sidewalk outside the wrought-iron railings, more
than the usual number of sightseers mingled with camera crews.
   Barbara Cerrato and her husband, Lou, 74, a retired restaurant
manager from Los Angeles, admired a bronze cherub on the lock of a
palace gate.
   ``We waited 30 years to come to London and we saw on TV last
night that Mrs. Thatcher and Mr. Major would come here today so we
came, too. I wish we had been invited inside,'' Mrs. Cerrato said.
   ``This is the closest we have come to people running a country.
We saw Reagan run for governor of California. It's nice here. When
I was in Washington I couldn't even stand in front of the White
House because the police keep you moving,'' she said.
   Mrs. Thatcher, she added, ``has a lot of admirers back home.''
   More people waited, watching, in the Mall, the long processional
avenue with double rows of plane trees leading to Whitehall - the
seat of government - and Downing Street.
   A Japanese couple, Kiyo Takatori and her husband, Tadashi, were
on a three-day group visit to London and seized the chance to be on
the scene Wednesday.
   ``We like the tradition,'' Mrs. Takatori said. ``We are so
excited by our new emperor.''
   The watchers stirred as Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher,
husband Denis at her side, was driven quickly through the gates
just after 9:30 a.m. in her official black Jaguar.
   The car crossed the forecourt and ducked through an archway into
the inner courtyard. Within the palace, Mrs. Thatcher resigned at a
private audience with the queen.
   At 10:15, the sun peeked out briefly as Mrs. Thatcher was driven
away, now just one among 650 members of Parliament.
   ``I'm very sad, very sorry she's going, and I can't really
understand why,'' said helmeted London bobby No. 483.
   A skein of Canada geese flew over the palace toward the lake in
St. James's Park.
   Matthew Kocher, 20, of Portland, Ore., walked up with a bedroll
on his back after visiting Turkey, Pakistan, Israel, Greece,
Yugoslavia, Germany and Hungary. He got in from Budapest the night
before.
   ``I knew a lot was going on today but I didn't realize it was
happening here,'' he said.
   A window-cleaner in cream shirt and jeans appeared at a line of
ground-floor windows inside the front of the palace, climbed a
ladder and wiped the panes.
   The sentries changed.
   More rustling in the crowd as the official Jaguar returned at
10:30 with John Major and his wife, Norma.
   Gail Golden, 46, a bank administrator on vacation from Phoenix,
Ariz., was taking snapshots throggh the railings. She waited six
hours near 10 Downing St. on Thursday to see Mrs. Thatcher the day
of her resignation.
   ``But when she came out, the police pushed us back and I didn't
see her. Now ... I have seen her in the car. She is like a hero to
me and I am very surprised she is going and also to find people
here who didn't like her,'' Miss Golden said.
   At 11:12 a.m., Prime Minister John Major was driven away.
   The cameramen packed up, the crowds drifted away. A new lot of
guardsmen strode into the palace forecourt for the changing guard.

<HEAD>U.S. to Increase Acceptance Of Immigrants</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Give us your kin, your skills and your moneyed
masses will be one message when President Bush on Thursday signs
into law the most sweeping changes in U.S. immigration policy in a
quarter-century.
   The new law will increase by 400,000 the number of immigrants it
will accept in the three years beginning next October. It will also
ease restrictions on visitors once barred for professing communist
or other unacceptable opinions.
   The changes are being enacted as millions of people are leaving
their homes because of the Persian Gulf crisis and the collapse of
communism in East Europe.
   But Congress, in approving the biggest change in immigration
policy since 1965, was moved not so much by those events as the
need to balance large influxes from Asia and Latin America by
giving Europeans a better chance. And the new law seeks to bring in
wealthier and better skilled immigrants.
   Refugee problems are dealt with separately. This year 131,000
refugees are being accepted, primarily from Indochina and the
Soviet Union. U.S. authorities have helped get many of the refugees
from the gulf crisis back to their own countries.
   The new three-year total is 2.1 million visas for permanent
residence, up from 1.7 million for the previous three-year period.
   Numbers of people arriving to settle will still remain below the
peak years early in the century when the Statue Of Liberty welcomed
newcomers with the words, ``give us your tired, your poor, your
huddled masses yearning to breathe free.'' In the year 1907 alone
1.3 million immigrants were admitted.
   The new law continues the current policy of trying to reunite
families by favoring applicants with relatives in this country,
setting aside 465,000 visas for such immigrants.
   And it increases emphasis on getting skilled workers. Some
140,000 visas a year are reserved for immigrants with special
skills, up from 54,000 in the past.
   Under this category, some 10,000 visas are for applicants with
at least $500,000 to invest in businesses that create new jobs in
this country. The immigrants will get two years to show what they
can do with the money.
   Canada and Australia have similar policies. In proportion to
their population they take more settlers than the United States
does and put greater emphasis on getting people with skills.
   he U.S. law makes it harder for authorities to keep out
foreigners, either visitors or settlers, because of their opinions.
British novelist Graham Greene and French singer Yves Montand are
among those who ran into difficulties as prospective visitors in
the past.
   Greene once said that after Josef Stalin's disappearance, he
would rather live in the Soviet Union than in the United States.
Montand declined to say whether he was a communist.
   The new law eliminates many grounds for excluding people because
of their beliefs. Advocates of polygamy are no longer specifically
barred, nor are members of the Communist Party if they have
relatives in this country. Polygamists may visit, but are not
acceptable as immigrants.
   The residence visas and the traditional ``green cards'' that go
with them - they now are actually white - allow foreigners to take
jobs. Visitors and students are forbidden to work, although many do
illegally.
   A large proportion of the residence visas will be issued to
people already in this country. Many are being given under a
special amnesty law to Mexicans and others who came illegally in
the past and have been working in this country. Only 402,000 out of
1,091,000 residence visas issued in 1989 went to new arrivals.
   Widespread illegal immigration continues along the 1,960-mile
Mexican border. Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari urged
Bush during his visit to Mexico this week to respect the human
rights of illegal immigrants.
   The new law makes 48,000 visas available for people from
Ireland. Irish applications for visas have increased in recent
years, in part because of economic problems at home.
   U.S. officials estimate that 40,000 to 110,000 Irish are already
in this country illegally.
   Some 72,000 visas are reserved for citizens of 35 other
countries - mostly in Europe - considered to have been
disadvantaged. Many are expected to be taken up by people from
Poland and Italy. Among other favored countries are Algeria,
Argentina, Bermuda, Guadeloupe, Indonesia, Japan, New Caledonia and
Tunisia.
   There is a special provision to help local employees of U.S.
companies who would rather not stay in Hong Kong when China takes
over the British colony in 1997.

   Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers in the
United States and abroad.

   Nov. 2
   The Arizona Republic, Phoenix, on presidential war powers:
   As a rule the federal courts have been reluctant to horn in on
disputes between the executive branch and Congress.
   So it seems unlikely that the lawsuit brought by 45 House
Democrats will impede the slide toward war in the Persian Gulf, if
war is what George Bush has in mind. The plaintiffs may stand
athwart the road to Armageddon, but the courts will be reluctant to
stand with them.
   Twice before in recent years ... members of Congress have sought
to define the president's war-making authority. In each case the
courts have run for cover. ...
   Bush makes no secret of his objectives in the gulf, and they
offer scant comfort to those who define America's interests
narrowly. His stated goals continue to include the restoration of
the Kuwaiti monarchy - of marginal interest to Americans at best -
and ``unconditional withdrawal of all Iraqi forces,'' though a
negotiated withdrawal might save countless lives and much treasure.
   If war is his intention, the president is among a shrinking
minority. According to the latest polls, 70 percent of the American
people resist the idea of military action against Iraq - this
before the body bags start arriving home.
   Enthusiasm for a shooting war also is absent in Congress, even
among the president's own loyalists. If ... Bush turns his back on
such realities, he will face the same icy blast that finally swept
Lyndon Johnson out of office.

   Enterprise-Journal, McComb, Miss., on the Persian Gulf:
   Is the United States going to war in the Saudi Arabian-Kuwait
desert?
   As U.S. military forces continue their buildup - it surely looks
that way.
   Immediately after Iraq's invasion of oil-rich Kuwait, American
applauded President Bush's decisive response and his tough stance.
But as the crisis drags out, apprehension in Congress and
throughout the nation grows.
   Do we really want American boys to die in the desert for Kuwait?
Do we want them to die over the price of gasoline? To boot out
Saddam Hussein, a vicious, cruel ruler? For Arab states like Iran
or Syria, whose actions have been as bad as Iraq's?
   We are confident, if war comes, the United States and its allies
would prevail. But at what price in U.S. casualties? Twenty
thousand, 50,000, 100,000? And what price in civilian casualties to
Iraq should Iraqi cities get caught in U.S. air attacks? Hundred of
thousands? Millions?
   We wonder, too, what would be the ultimate effect of such a war
on the Middle East? Would Arab nations become even more hostile to
the United States as U.S. aircraft killed Arab men, women and
children? And who would be the ultimate gainer? Probably not the
United States. Probably Iran and Syria, no friends of ours.
   Moreover, should such a war not end quickly, and as U.S.
casualties mounted, American public opposition would surely grow.
   That leads us to hope that Bush won't get impatient and pursue a
military solution before exhausting all avenues of negotiation.
It's hard to figure how Saddam can hold out against such united
condemnation. Even though it might take a little longer, U.S.
troops bivouacking in a hot desert, is much preferable to the body
bags we recall from Vietnam.

   Nov. 23
   Capital Journal, Pierre, S.D., on the Persian Gulf:
   Congressmen on both sides of the aisle are asking for a bigger
role in the United States' military buildup in the Persian Gulf.
The word from the White House is that President Bush doesn't need
any help, or vindication, from Congress.
   As the massive U.S. military presence in Saudi Arabia drags on,
what this country needs is debate about the buildup and its future.
Letting the fate of 400,000 troops hang on the decisions of one man
is scary, even if that man is the president of the United States.
   Bush has already gotten this country into a desert stalemate
half a world away. His best course of action is to court Congress
and seek some sort of joint official action rather than shutting
out its members. If he insists on making all the decisions himself,
he may face another protracted deadlock right in Washington, D.C.

   Statesman Journal, Salem, Ore., on holidays and war:
   Last year we had big news to celebrate at Thanksgiving: Peace
had broken out.
   For the first time in 45 years, the superpowers no longer faced
each other with nuclear-tipped missiles while threatening to blow
themselves and the rest of the world to smithereens. We looked
forward to a year of peace in the world and progress at home, and
we hoped by this Thanksgiving to see as much progress at home as we
had seen overseas.
   That didn't happen.
   Thanks to Saddam Hussein, a year that started out with great
hopes ended up as so many others had: in war or war preparation.
Our money, our resources and our hopes for a changed world and a
rebuilt United States now are stuck in the sands of Saudi Arabia.
   It's easy to be thankful when everything is going well, as it
was last year. What takes devotion and optimism is to be hopeful
when you feel the disappointment of failure. Fortunately, we still
have optimism.
   Let us give thanks for what we can still do to try in the Middle
East the key that brought peace in Europe. There is still time to
avoid the ruins of war.
   Let us give thanks that although disappointed, we still have
endless blessings ourselves, and we can still share them with those
around the world nnd at home who need our help.
   Every year brings new problems and new opportunities. Though
disappointed by lost opportunities of the past year, we must
recognize our good fortune in what we have ourselves and in what we
can do between now and next Thanksgiving for our country and our
world.

   President Bush wants William Bennett to be
chairman of the Republican National Committee, the White House
confirmed Wednesday.
   Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater also indicated Bush is likely to
nominate outgoing Florida Gov. Bob Martinez as Bennett's successor
as director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy.
   ``Those are the worst kept secrets in the history of the world,
but we're not ready to make those announcements yet,'' Fitzwater
said.
   Bennett will ``be the president's candidate'' when the
Republican National Committee meets to elect a new chairman,
Fitzwater said.
   GOP Chairman Lee Atwater is being treated for an inoperable
brain tumor.
   Fitzwater also said that while there was no official
announcement on Martinez being nominated for Bennett's old job, ``I
would not deny either one of those moves.''
   Bennett is resigning as drug policy director at the end of
November. Martinez was defeated in his re-election bid this month
by Democrat Lawton Chiles.

   The Capital Times, Madison, Wis., on Congress:
   Here's a saga of pettiness and arrogance run amok.
   Last February, the in-house magazine of the National Park
Service contained a column by the agency's legislative specialist.
The column began by needling Congress for raising its members' pay.
   That offended the congressional staff member who handles the
agency's budget.
   When Park Service officials learned that Neal Sigmon of the
House Appropriations Interior subcommittee was upset, they went out
of their way to apologize to him.
   A lot of good it did them.
   When the House and Senate worked out a compromise version of the
Interior appropriations bill for the coming year, $75,000 was
deleted from the Park Service budget - the $75,000 allocated for
publishing the magazine.
   On the record, everyone claims to be mystified by the deletion.
Off the record, one congressional staff member said, ``From time to
time, signals are sent to agencies when they've been bad.''
   It did not seem to matter whether or not the in-house newsletter
served a useful function in communicating with Park Service
employees who, of course, are scattered all across the country. All
that mattered was that a congressional staff member felt that
congressional pride had been wounded.

   Roswell (N.M.) Daily Record on Congress:
   Despite all the talk about American voters throwing the bums out
of Congress on Nov. 6, fully 96 percent of House members and 97
percent of senators who sought re-election were victorious. ...
   Members of Congress are so entrenched that there literally is
more turnover in the Supreme Soviet. And this undemocratic
situation will continue as long as big money corrupts the electoral
process. ...
   The cleanest way to put an end to vote buying by special
interests is to outlaw political action committee contributions in
federal elections. If a flat ban proves to be unconstitutional,
there should at least be strictly enforced caps on such
contributions.
   No less important a reform is shutting down the soft-money
system that enables political parties to launder large
contributions through generic get-out-the-vote drives. These
efforts are unfair because they almost always benefit incumbents.
   Also, let's end the widespread abuse of the congressional frank,
or free mailers, at election time.

   Nov. 22
   Daily News, Los Angeles, on Michael Milken:
   Michael R. Milken learned a tough lesson ... : The more power
you get, the more you are obliged not to abuse it. U.S. District
Judge Kimba M. Wood said essentially that in handing out a stiff,
but appropriate, sentence of 10 years in prison to the former
junk-bond financier, who pleaded guilty earlier this year to six
felony charges of securities fraud and conspiracy. ...
   Legitimate investors can do without the contempt for the rules
that Milken brought with him in his pursuit of profit. Whatever
contributions Milken made to the financial world, those were offset
by a combination of greed, ego and deceit that turned securities
markets into personal playgrounds for the unethical.

   Nov. 24
   The Providence (R.I.) Journal-Bulletin on legal services:
   A recent issue of The Economist, the British news weekly, said
of the ever-growing demand for legal services in the United States:
``Much of the `demand' for the output of this swollen industry is
created not by clients but by other members of the (lawsuit)
industry, as if doctors went around injecting diseases for other
doctors to cure. Is this really a boost to living standards?''
   That's a good question, to which we suspect the answer might be
no.
   So it's a good sign for our economy that at least some big
American companies are trying to do something about this disease.
The same magazine enthusiastically reports that earlier this month
the chief executives of 17 of the country's biggest companies sent
out a group letter urging their fellow executives ``to negotiate
and settle (disputes) early before litigation takes on a life of
its own.'' ...
   The endless use of lawsuits, threatened and actual, to resolve
disputes in our society has diverted time and money from what are
usually more productive ends. Let us hope that in taking a pledge
to try to avoid litigation, big business provides some useful
suggestions to individuals of the numerous ways in which arguments
can be resolved to everyone's satisfaction without lawsuits.
   An America with less litigation would probably be a richer and
happier country.

   The Tennessean, Nashville, Tenn., on Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris
Yeltsin:
   In the United States, the old adage in determining the political
fallout of a major decision is how it will play in Peoria.
   But in the Soviet Union, the final determination of a decision's
merit has become how it will play with Yeltsin. ...
   Boris Yeltsin, president of the Republic of Russia, has become
the ultimate reviewer of reform measures in the troubled nation.
Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev must sometimes wonder if ...
Yeltsin is his political subordinate or vice versa. ...
   Gorbachev, responding to continued turmoil in his country over
economic conditions, announced an emergency revamping of the Soviet
government recently. The plan included the elimination of the
position held by Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryszhkov. It boosted the
authority of the Council of the Federation, comprised of leaders of
the 15 Soviet republics. But it also created a new Security Council
to oversee military and police activity, reporting to the
president. And it created a system of presidential representatives
to enforce orders from the center.
   The plan had the effect of tightening ... Gorbachev's grip on
power. It was quickly approved by Parliament, but there was an
initial silence from ... Yeltsin, ... who has pushed for swifter
reforms. After a couple of days of weighing the plan, ... Yeltsin
announced his verdict: thumbs down. ...
   Yeltsin protests that the plan denies the republics the right of
approval over executive decisions. He says that ... Gorbachev's
overtures at sharing power are not strong enough. He said the plan
would ``not improve, but only worsen the situation in the
country.''...
   Yeltsin's voice is so strong on these matters because he is
speaking for so many Soviet people. ... Gorbachev knows that.
   Ultimately, the people's support is the factor that will
determine the fate of the Soviet economy. The only leader who will
succeed is the one who has the support of the people.

   Cumhuriyet, Istanbul, Turkey, on Margaret Thatcher:
   (British Prime Minister Margaret) Thatcher tried to implement
capitalism in the most savage fashion until the end. ... Because of
that, she had to face little words she could not stand - like
socialism, social, unions.
   She always aimed at belittling the state and reducing the
economic and social structure to the lowest point. Privatization
was the top priority of her economic policy. She constantly chipped
off the state's contributions to social health and education. She
lost no opportunity in trying to break the unions.
   Yet, it cannot be said that she was unsuccessful all together.
But the actual social cost of that success proved to be
considerable.

   Nov. 22
   The Times of India, New Delhi, on Margaret Thatcher:
   From the start ... (British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher)
was combative, relishing the combat more than the outcome. In the
11 long years she ran Britain and the Tories, she made perhaps more
political enemies than friends and admirers.
   But neither the prospect nor the reality of unpopularity
deterred her from doing what she was convinced was right. In a
fundamental sense, she turned post-war Britain upside down and
inside out. Britain has always been, in Disraeli's phrase, ``two
nations.'' Mrs. Thatcher made it even more so.
   What in the end turned many of her supporters against her was
her grudging acceptance of a European role for Britain. Her fears
over Britain's loss of sovereignity through acquiring a wider
European identity made her seem to look backwards rather than
ahead.

   Straits Times, Singapore, on problems in Eastern and Central
Europe:
   The primary problem in the Eastern and Central European
countries is economic, but there are indications already that the
economic crisis is reviving old ethnic animosities which, if not
contained, could shape into a fascist subversion of the fledgling
democracies and irredentist pressures on national borders. ...
   Indeed, in the understandable, but nevertheless hasty,
dismantling of an existing political order before the economic
underpinnings of a new order were in place, the Eastern European
countries opened themselves to possible anarchy.

   Nov. 27
   Algemeen Dagblad, Rotterdam, Netherlands, on the Polish
election:
   It's a bad thing that reason, political realism and patience in
Poland should have lost out against populism, impatience and the
idea that a society can change from one day to the next.
   The Poles will find out that the leader of their choice will
disappoint their faith in charisma and intuition. Poland's
democracy is still a tiny seedling that has to be nurtured the way
Prime Minister (Tadeusz) Mazowiecki did. It is not served by a
dictatorial and unpredictable leader.
   Lech Walesa - currently still very popular - wil soon encounter
harsh, everyday reality. He will do well to realize that a long and
difficult road is ahead, full of pitfalls and setbacks.

   South China Morning Post, Hong Kong, on the retirement of
Singapore Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew:
   The city-state is a monument to (Singapore Prime Minister Lee
Kuan Yew's) outstanding ability, combining political cunning with a
first class mind, and ruthlessness with a charismatic personality.
...
   Singapore is too small a stage for the talents of ... Lee, and
his retirement from the prime minister's position should give him
the opportunity to use his stature and influence to good effect
internationally.
   As the most admired and respected elder statesman in Asia, he
has built up a credit bank which other countries may be able to
use. Much interest will focus on whether or not he can play an
intermediary role between China and Taiwan. Singapore enjoys links
with both, a unique situation which indicates the extent of ...
Lee's skills as a diplomatic negotiator.

   Lord Pearce, chairman of a government panel in
1972 that rejected a proposed settlement in the then rebel colony
of Rhodesia on grounds most blacks opposed it, has died, newspapers
reported Wednesday. He was 89.
   Pearce, a former senior judge, died Monday at his home in the
village of Crowborough in the county of Sussex in southern England.
No cause of death was given.
   Pearce visited what was then Rhodesia and is now Zimbabwe as
head of the government panel in 1972.
   His presence was regarded as the first genuine and independent
outlet for black majority opinion in many years.
   On Nov. 11, 1965, the then white minority government of Ian
Smith had declared itself free of all remaining colonial links with
Britain.
   Britain was hoping to steer Rhodesia to full independence under
eventual black rule. It said the independence declaration was
illegal and that independence under continuing white rule, as
sought by Smith, must be acceptable to the entire population.
   Pearce's panel was set up to determine whether proposals for a
constitutional settlement with Smith's administration for
continuing white rule were acceptable on this basis.
   The commission ruled that the proposals were unacceptable to
most Africans there, who distrusted the Smith administration.
   Subsequent negotiations between Britain and Smith's
administration failed.
   The issue was resolved by a conference in London in 1979.
Elections were held in February 1980, and the country gained
independence from Britain on April 18, 1980, as the black-ruled
Republic of Zimbabwe.
   Pearce was a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary, or Law Lord, from 1962
to 1967. The Law Lords constitute the highest court in the land.
   He was chairman of the Press Council, a watchdog body for
British newspapers, from 1969 to 1974.
   It was not known whether there were any survivors. Pearce's
wife, Erica, and the couple's two sons have died.

   One day before the United Nations votes on a U.S.-sponsored
resolution demanding Iraq withdraw from Kuwait by Jan. 15 or face
possible attack, a leading U.S. congressman said today he opposes
using force against Iraq soon.
   As Congress debated Persian Gulf policy, Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan said today that skyrocketing oil prices and
a growing shortage of credit have substantially weakened the
American economy.
   ``All indications are that a meaningful downturn in aggregate
output occurred as we moved through October into November,''
Greenspan said.
   Speaking to the House Banking Committee in Washington, Greenspan
said it was too soon to determine whether the country was
experiencing a recession, but he conceded that economic growth, as
measured by the gross national product, probably would turn
negative in the October-December quarter.
   In Baghdad, meanwhile, Iraq's deputy foreign minister today
urged President Bush to open talks on restoring peace in the
Persian Gulf, although he did not offer concessions regarding
Kuwait.
   Iraq has called for dialogue with the United States previously,
but U.S. officials have said there is nothing to discuss as long
Iraq refuses to free all foreign hostages and withdraw
unconditionally from Kuwait.
   Another Iraqi official denied today that Baghdad was preventing
Soviets from leaving the country. On Monday, the Soviet Foreign
Ministry accused Baghdad of breaking a promise to allow Soviets in
Iraq to leave and threatened a ``tougher attitude'' if they were
not granted freedom.
   China's foreign minister, Qian Qichen, said in Beijing today his
country would not vote for the U.N. use-of-force resolution. But he
refused to say whether China would veto the measure, which it could
do as one of five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council.
   U.S. officials say the Chinese have promised not to oppose the
resolution.
   Qian was to meet with Secretary of State James A. Baker III
tonight and may be seeking concessions in return for abstaining
during Thursday's U.N. vote.
   China wants Washington to lift economic sanctions it imposed
following the June 1989 military crackdown that crushed China's
pro-democracy movement. Qian's is the first official visit by a
Chinese minister since the crackdown.
   Today, the White House faced criticism in its drive for a U.N.
resolution authorizing force. House Majority Leader Richard
Gephardt said he opposed using force against Iraq now and that the
U.S. should stick to sanctions.
   ``Stay the course. Stick with the sanctions. Do not try to mount
an offensive military action in the near future,'' the Missouri
Democrat said in a speech. The United Nations has imposed trade
sanctions against Iraq and they are being vigorously enforced by
the multinational force in the Persian Gulf.
   It was the first public break among the Democratic leadership.
Last week, democrats said the Bush administration would have a
better chance of winning congressional approval for an attack if it
received U.N. backing.
   Gephardt's remarks came as the Senate Armed Services Committee
began its second session to debate a U.N. resolution authorizing
military force.
   Under the resolution, to be voted on Thursday, Iraq will have
until Jan. 15 to withdraw its troops from Kuwait before facing the
prospect of military action. Soviet and U.S. diplomats fixed the
deadline in the last 24 hours, Western diplomats said on condition
of anonymity.
   The resolution authorizes ``all necessary means'' to get Iraq
out of Kuwait after that date.
   But Iraq today called for dialogue. Iraq's deputy prime
minister, Taha Yassin Ramadan, said Bush ``is leading the entire
world to a ruinous war'' and ``has no choice other than to come to
his senses and initiate a dialogue.''
   Ramadan indicated, however, Iraq had not softened its position
on Kuwait, saying it was intent on ousting ``aggressors and
traitors'' from Arab land.
   Also today, an Iraqi Foreign Ministry spokesman denied Soviets
were being held like other Westerners in Iraq. ``Soviets are
working in Iraq according to contracts,'' he said on condition of
anonymity.
   ``We told the Soviet officials that Iraq will allow any Soviet
to leave Iraq when his contract ends,'' the official said. Iraq has
taken ``no illegal measures against Soviets,'' he said, indicating
that they are not hostages.
   More than 8,000 Soviets were in Iraq and Kuwait before Baghdad's
Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. Fewer than half that number remain. Many
Soviets worked in oil fields and as specialists at military
installations.
   Before leaving Jordan for home today, some freed Americans
hostages, whose families had traveled to Iraq to plead with Saddam
for their release, told reporters in Jordan that the Bush
administration had ignored their plight.
   Saddam said on Tuesday after meeting with boxing great Muhammad
Ali that an unspecified number of Americans would soon be allowed
to leave.
   Saddam has been releasing foreign hostages on a piecemeal basis.
The Bush administration has condemned the sporadic releases as
aimed at dividing the alliance arrayed against Iraq.

   Typhoon Owen, a fierce storm with 125 mph
winds, slammed into the Federated States of Micronesia today,
killing two people and leaving more than 1,000 people homeless,
officials said.
   The two men were killed in the Micronesian capital of Pohnpei
when they were electrocuted by downed power lines, said Tony
Palomo, a representative of the Guam Department of the Interior.
   Early reports estimated that well over 1,000 people were left
homeless after the powerful storm packing winds of 125 mph and
gusts of 155 mph battered the outer islands of Pulap, Ruo, Nomwin,
Fananu, Murilo and Tamatam in the state of Chuuk, said Ismael
Dobich, public affairs director of Chuuk.
   Each island has about 500 residents. Micronesia is in the
western Pacific Ocean, north of the equator. The principal island
groups include the Caroline Islands, Nauru, the Gilbert Islnads,
the Northern Mariana Islands and the Marshall Islands.
   Owen destroyed nearly every home on Pulap and Ruo, Dobich said.
The entire banana, coconut, taro and bread fruit crops were
destroyed on Ruo, Dobich.
   ``In Pulap, all of the homes were destroyed with the exception
of one concrete structure,'' Dobich said. Most of the homes were
made of wood and tin.
   Owen was expected to regain supertyphoon status by late Thursday
or early Friday, with forecasters predicting winds of 150 mph and
gusts to 180 mph.
   Guam, 1,488 miles from Chuuk, remains on a typhoon alert status.
Owen was about 405 miles south of Guam, an American territory,
Wednesday morning.

<TEXT>
   The White House today disputed an
international commission's finding that there is no evidence Iraq
is building a nuclear weapon with highly enriched reactor fuel.
   ``The International Atomic Energy Agency is wrong,'' Marlin
Fitzwater, President Bush's spokesman, said at a daily briefing.
   ``They see only what Iraq wants them to see,'' he said of the
agency's inspectors who made the determination after a trip to
Baghdad. ``We don't believe they saw all the information,''
Fitzwater said.
   The spokesman declined, however, to discuss in detail what
evidence the administration has that Iraq is developing an atomic
bomb.
   In a report released in Vienna, Austria Tuesday, the atomic
energy agency said a Nigerian and a Soviet inspector toured a
storage plant and a fuel-producing plant Nov. 19-22 at Baghdad's
invitation.
   They apparently checked on a 27-pound mass of highly enriched
uranium that Iraq salvaged from its Osirak nuclear reactor, which
was destroyed by an Israeli air attack in 1981. They concluded none
of the uranium had been diverted to make a nuclear weapon.
   The six-month inspections carried out by the IAEA are viewed as
foolproof by technical experts. However, they do not take into
account a country's long-term nuclear plans.
   Lawrence Eagleburger, deputy secretary of state, said Tuesday
that not all nuclear materials in Iraq are under IAEA safeguards.
   The IAEA report came as a number of independent analysts
questioned the Bush administration's contention that Iraq is on the
verge of producing nuclear weapons that could be used against U.S.
troops in Saudi Arabia.
   ``Urgency? I don't think so,'' said former CIA Director James
Schlesinger when asked if Americans should be immediately concerned
about Iraq's potential nuclear threat.
   Schlesinger, testifying Tuesday before the Senate Armed Services
Committee, estimated it would take Iraq five years to develop
nuclear weapons if it received help from the outside. Without help,
it would probably take a decade, he said.
   Displaying skepticism about the administration's recent
statements on the subject, Schlesinger said ``it's not an
accident'' that a recent poll suggested Americans would support
military involvement in the Persian Gulf to eliminate any nuclear
threat.
   Since then, Bush and other officials have raised the specter of
Iraq attacking with nuclear weapons, he said.
   Bush told U.S. troops in Saudi Arabia on Thanksgiving Day their
mission was marked by ``a real sense of urgency'' because of Saddam
Hussein's progress in acquiring nuclear arms. But, he added, ``no
one knows precisely'' how near Iraq is to becoming a nuclear power.
   Gary Milhollin of the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control
said the administration is exaggerating the danger of Iraq's
nuclear program in an effort to gain support for a United Nations
Security Council resolution authorizing use of force. The vote is
scheduled for Thursday.
   Milhollin, a nuclear expert, said he didn't think it was a
``credible scenario'' that Iraq would have nuclear weapons in less
than a year.
   Administration officials, meanwhile, continued to assert that
Iraq could obtain some kind of nuclear device soon.
   Pete Williams, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's spokesman, said
Cheney ``is aware that they (Iraq) could have some kind of crude
device in less than a year.''
   Such a device might not be delivered from an airplane or
``weaponized in the traditional sense of a nuclear weapon, but it
would be capable of doing some damage, of producing some kind of
yield,'' he said.
   Asked if the Pentagon believes the 230,000 U.S. troops in the
Persian Gulf area are under any threat of nuclear attack, Williams
said: ``It would be accurate to say we're concerned about it.''
   The Pentagon's intelligence estimates indicate it would take
Iraq less than a year to have ``some kind of crude device'' and
between five to 10 years to have a deliverable system, Williams
said.
   Eagleburger said the administration's estimates are ``based on
fairly substantial evidence on our part that there is substantial
unsafeguarded nuclear activity going on in Iraq.''
   Baghdad has repeatedly denied allegations by Western media and
Israel that it is developing nuclear arms.
   Richard Rhodes, author of ``The Making of the Atomic Bomb,''
wrote in Tuesday's editions of The New York Times that Bush's
invocation of an imminent Iraqi nuclear threat was a ``red
herring.''
   ``Expert estimates put Iraqi acquisition of a limited nuclear
arsenal at least 10 years away,'' he said.
   Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., a member of the Senate Armed
Services Committee, said information he has received shows Iraq
could not acquire nuclear weapons within two years. He has urged
that economic sanctions against Iraq remain in place for a year or
two before any military action is taken.
   A recent Congressional Research Survey concluded Iraq lacks the
uranium and the facilities to produce weapons-grade plutonium
needed to make a nuclear warhead.
   The worldwide embargo on Iraq has hampered Saddam Hussein's
efforts to obtain the manpower and material to develop a nuclear
program, the study said.

   A Dutch public-relations firm filed
a $69,000 lawsuit against Solidarity leader Lech Walesa over the
last-minute cancellation of a visit in September.
   Penta Promotions had hired a private jet and reserved the
presidential suite at a posh hotel for Walesa, who had been
scheduled to visit Sept. 26-27, according to the firm's lawyer.
   The company, Penta Promotions, says Walesa called off the visit
less than 24 hours in advance, and says it got stuck with the bill.
   Walesa finished first in Sunday's presidential balloting in
Poland, but failed to garner a majority. He will face
Polish-Canadian businessman Stanislaw Tyminski in a runoff on Dec.
9.
   ``A man who does this kind of thing should not be responsible
for the future of Poland,'' Penta General Manager Karel Hille said
Tuesday.
   The company said whatever damages the firm won would be donated
to a Polish charity.
   No one at Solidarity's Warsaw headquarters was available for
comment on the lawsuit.

<TEXT>
   A bankruptcy judge agreed struggling Eastern
Airlines would have trouble attracting passengers if it had to
plead for cash every few weeks and let the carrier tap $135 million
to keep flying through the winter.
   Creditors had tried to block the request for a withdrawal from
an Eastern escrow fund, repeating that the airline cannot make a go
of it and should be liquidated while there is enough money for an
orderly shutdown.
   But U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland said Tuesday that
court-appointed trustee Martin R. Shugrue Jr. should be given the
chance to see whether Eastern can indeed turn the corner to
profitability next year.
   Shugrue predicted today the ailing carrier can become profitable
without seeking more cash.
   ``We have no intention of being back in court seeking further
cash drawdowns,'' Shugrue told a news conference. ``It is simply
not going to be required.''
   Shugrue refused to say whether he would be willing to give up on
Eastern.
   ``We will make whatever changes we need as we move through the
business plan,'' Shugrue said.
   In his decision, Lifland cited concerns that chaos would occur
if Eastern closed down during the holiday season.
   Eastern has been in bankruptcy court since a crippling strike in
1989.
   After the hearing, Shugrue praised the judge's ``vote of
confidence in Eastern.''
   ``It's a Christmas present for everybody who works at Eastern,''
airline spokesman Jim Ashlock said. ``You can see what this enables
us to do. It takes away the uncertainty and gives us a chance to
make good on what we know we can do.''
   Less than two weeks ago, the judge agreed to give Eastern $15
million and held out the possibility of another $15 million in
early December.
   Eastern said in asking for even more money Tuesday that bad
publicity surrounding the creditors' move to have it closed had
driven away passengers and made credit-card companies nervous about
doing business with the airline.
   Shugrue told the court he needed $135 million to keep Eastern
alive, and he needed it all at once to avoid more damaging news
coverage.
   ``We simply cannot run the business on a rolling 15-day time
frame,'' he said.
   The judge agreed, chastising the creditors for their
``campaign'' against Eastern.
   ``Under all these circumstances, it seems inappropriate to
constantly come back at these short intervals where the adverse
publicity will be repeated again and again,'' Lifland said.
   An attorney for the creditors, Joel B. Zweibel, said he was not
sure what their next move would be. The creditors include aircraft
companies, banks, unions and others who are owed about $1 billion
by Eastern.
   Zweibel had argued in court papers that liquidation was
inevitable and should begin now ``before further funds are wasted
and while Christmas holiday travelers have several weeks to
rearrange their plans.''
   Charles Bryan, the leader of Eastern's striking Machinists, said
Shugrue has no chance of turning the carrier around and is
``bleeding the last drop out of Eastern.''

<HEAD>First Family to Move Into Love Canal Home This Week</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The first family to buy a renovated
house at the former Love Canal chemical-waste site is moving in
this week, 3{ months after homes were offered for sale.
   A state judge, meanwhile, rejected the latest bid by
environmentalists to block the Love Canal Area Revitalization
Agency's efforts to resettle the neighborhood it now calls Black
Creek Village.
   The agency has signed contracts with 12 buyers for houses near
the toxic dump site and is scheduled to close the first of those
deals next week, its executive director, William Broderick, said
Tuesday.
   The first buyer, Sandra DeVantier, is being allowed to move in
before the closing because she needs to vacate her old home,
Broderick said.
   ``She's kind of moving in around us laying the carpet down and
finishing up the rest of the work,'' Broderick said.
   Sales have been slower than the agency predicted when it began
showing the homes to buyers in mid-August, in large part because
area banks have been reluctant to write mortgages on Love Canal
property.
   DeVantier was able to close the sale quickly because she is
paying $54,000 cash for the property, Broderick said.
   DeVantier could not be reached for comment. She does not have a
listed telephone number in the Niagara Falls or Buffalo areas. The
revitalization agency refused to say how she could be contacted,
saying she requested privacy.
   Love Canal became a symbol of the nation's hazardous waste
problems when chemicals dumped in the 1940s and 1950s began leaking
into a middle-class neighborhood late  built on the site.
   The revitalization agency was formed to renovate and sell some
of the 1,100 homes vacated by residents after the leaks were
discovered in the late 1970s.
   It plans to sell about 250 homes; most of the rest have been or
will be demolished because they are in areas deemed too
contaminated for living.
   Some groups contend the entire area is unsafe for human
habitation. But a lawsuit making that argument was dismissed
Tuesday by state Supreme Court Justice Joseph Mintz, who said the
environmentalists had no standing to sue and had waited too long to
raise their complaints.
   Richard Lippes, a lawyer for the environmental groups, said they
would appeal. ``No court yet has addressed the merits of our
claim,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   An attorney for Arizona Sen. Dennis DeConcini
today attacked the testimony of former top thrift regulator Edwin
Gray Jr., the chief accuser of the so-called Keating Five senators
under scrutiny by the Senate Ethics Committee.
   James Hamilton, lawyer for the Arizona Democrat, engaged in
contentious exchanges with Gray and other lawyers as he sought to
point out inconsistencies in the former regulator's allegations.
   He sought to show that Gray had more information about Charles
Keating Jr.'s Lincoln Savings and Loan than he admitted during a
now-disputed meeting with DeConcini and three other senators on
April 2, 1987.
   On Tuesday, Gray, former head of the Federal Home Loan bank
Board, said that in that meeting, DeConcini offered him a deal in
an effort to relax regulations for the California-based thrift,
whose owner was a major financial contributor to each of each of
the senators' campaigns and causes.
   Cross-examining Gray, Hamilton cited written denials from other
senators who were present and said, ``Is there any reason the
American public should believe you and disbelieve four prominent
American senators?''
   Gray responded: ``The American public can believe whoever they
will. I had nothing to gain whatsoever ... by not telling the
truth.''
   Gray asserted that DeConcini had been leader of the April 2,
1987 meeting, which he described as an intimidating and
pressure-packed session aimed at winning help for Keating's thrift.
He said DeConcini referred to Keating as ``our friend at Lincoln,''
and that he interpreted the other senators' silence as agreement
with the request.
   None of the five senators under investigation by the ethics
committee was present as Gray resumed his third day in the witness
chair.
   Hamilton read from a 1989 letter Gray wrote to Sen. John Glenn,
D-Ohio, recounting his assertion that he had told the senators he
had no information about Lincoln during that disputed meeting.
Hamilton said: ``This statement I read, it really wasn't true, was
it?''
   Gray: ``Well, as a matter of fact, yes it was true.''
   Hamilton: ``You really knew more than you let on, didn't you?''
   Hamilton pointed to evidence that Gray had received information
from the bank board's top California-based regulator, who had said
their examination had revealed ``a number of areas of concern'' at
Lincoln, including heavy direct investment in real estate.
   Gray said it had been eight months since he had seen that
regulator's memo, and he considered it incomplete and out of date.
   The committee is holding hearings into allegations the five
senators intervened improperly on behalf of Keating and his thrift
institution. Keating and his associated contributed $1.3 million to
the campaigns and causes of the five senators.
   The collapse of Lincoln has been estimated to cost taxpayers $2
billion in bailout costs. Keating is under indictment in
California, where the thrift is based.
   Besides DeConcini, senators under scrutiny by the panel are
Republican John McCain of Arizona and Democrats Glenn, Alan
Cranston of California and Donald Riegle of Michigan. All but
Riegle attended that April 2 meeting.
   Testifying Tuesday, Gray told the panel of the April 2, 1987,
meeting.
   ``I considered it improper,'' Gray testified. ``The whole
setting was an intimidating one.''
   ``DeConcini said, `We're very concerned about this direct
investment regulation of yours. ... We'd like you to withdraw it
until we can find out if it's constitutional. If you can do that,
we'll get our friend at Lincoln to make more home loans.'''
   Gray described the three other senators in the April 2 meeting
as silently acquiescing to DeConcini's request. Under
cross-examination by Glenn's lawyer, Charles Ruff, he acknowledged
hearing no verbal agreement.
   ``I thought I saw a nod but maybe I didn't,'' he said. ``... The
point is there was no objection ... Nobody said, `He speaks for
himself.'''
   Gray contended the meeting was improper and that he felt awkward
and pressured by the senators. He said he took no action as a
result of the meeting, nor did other regulators.
   ``We did not succumb to that pressure,'' he said.

   Voters in this Mississippi River city
approved riverboat gambling, clearing the way for a developer to
build a planned 1,000-passenger floating casino.
   Complete unofficial results showed voters in Adams County,
located in the southwest corner of the state, favored riverboat
gambling 6,031 to 5,242 in Tuesday's referendum.
   The state Legislature in June approved a law legalizing
riverboat gambling along the Mississippi River and Mississippi's
Gulf Coast, but gave voters in individual counties the option of
prohibiting it by referendum.
   Voters in Washington County rejected riverboat gambling a week
ago and Tunica County supervisors approved riverboat and dockside
gambling Nov. 5 after residents failed to petition for a
referendum.
   Voters in Harrison, Hancock, Jackson and Warren counties will
decide riverboat gambling referendums next month.

<HEAD>Mayor Pena Won't Seek Re-Election</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>

   Denver Mayor Federico Pena has decided he won't
seek a third term as mayor next year, an aide said today.
   The 43-year-old Democrat had been expected to seek a third term
in 1991. He has been mayor of the city of 500,000 since 1983.
   Pena aide Tom Gleason said Pena would announce his decision
later today.
   ``He thinks the time is right for him to move onto something
else,'' Gleason said.
   Pena's two terms as mayor have spanned a turbulent period in
Denver. He won election by campaigning on the theme, ``Imagine a
Great City,'' but Denver then slid into a real-estate bust when the
price of oil plummeted.
   Yet Denver managed to embark on two big-ticket construction
projects under Pena's administration - a $3 billion airport, which
will be completed in 1993, and a convention center that opened this
year. The city also is in the midst of a campaign to land a
National League baseball expansion team.
   The times proved equally rough-and-tumble for Pena, who barely
won re-election in 1987 and survived arecall petition drive the
following year.
   Pena, a lawyer, moved from his native Texas to Denver in 1973
and first drew attention pushing civil rights' causes for
Hispanics.

   John Major, who rose from poverty to become
Britain's youngest prime minister of the 20th century, took office
today pledging to ``build a society of opportunity.''
   Moving quickly to reorganize the government, Major brought his
defeated rival, Michael Heseltine, into the Cabinet. Heseltine's
challenge for the leadership of the Conservative Party had pushed
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher into retirement.
   ``I want to see us build a country that is at ease with itself,
a country that is confident, and a country that is prepared and
willing to make the changes necessary to provide a better quality
of life for all its citizens,'' Major said, minutes after being
confirmed in office by Queen Elizabeth II.
   ``I don't promise you that it will easy, and I don't promise you
that it will be quick,'' Major said, standing with his wife, Norma,
outside the prime minister's official residence at 10 Downing St.
   ``If you will forgive me,'' he added, ``I will go into No. 10
straight away, and make a start right now.''
   Major, 47, had won his parliamentary seat in Mrs. Thatcher's
first election victory of 1979. She had elevated him to the Cabinet
in 1987, and backed Major as her successor after concluding that
she could no longer hold on to power.
   ``We leave the United Kingdom in a very much better state than
when we came here 11{ years ago,'' Mrs. Thatcher, 65, said as she
paused for a last time in Downing St.
   ``Now it is time for a new chapter to open and I wish John Major
all the luck in the world ... he has the makings of a great prime
minister. Thank you very much and goodbye,'' she added.
   Hundreds of people, many clapping and cheering, pressed to the
railings of Buckingham Palace as Mrs. Thatcher arrived. She left
with her husband, Denis, in a private car for the their new life in
a southeast London suburban home.
   Major, representing a new generation of European leaders with no
memory of World War II, was elected as leader of the Conservative
Party Tuesday evening.
   ``We have in front us of the building and development of an
entirely new Europe, a building and development in which this
country will play a full and leading role,'' the new prime minister
said today.
   Major's immediate tasks, however, are to unify a party and
reshape a government traumatized by the abrupt collapse of the
Thatcher era.
   In addition to making Heseltine his secretary of the
environment, Major kept the third leadership candidate, Douglas
Hurd, in his post as foreign secretary.
   Even before Major took office, Transport Secretary Cecil
Parkinson, a close Thatcher aide, resigned today from the 22-member
Cabinet.
   Derided as Mrs. Thatcher's ``poodle'' by the opposition, and
picked by worried Tories as their new hope of keeping power, Major
was elected in a secret ballot by the 372 Conservative legislators.
   He fell two votes short of the required 187 votes, but was
declared winner after Heseltine and Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd
conceded defeat.
   The son of a onetime circus performer, Major was raised in the
rundown Brixton section of London and left school at 16. He was
briefly on welfare and worked as a laborer before becoming a
successful banker.
   Major arrived in the House of Commons in 1979, the year Mrs.
Thatcher won power, but was quickly plucked from obscurity and
entered the Cabinet in 1987, as treasury secretary and later,
briefly, as foreign secretary.
   While Major said during his campaign that he would stick to Mrs.
Thatcher's policies of tight spending and privatization, he said he
would review Mrs. Thatcher's unpopular per capita ``poll tax'' for
local services and would be liberal on social issues.
   The opposition disagreed.
   ``John Major is a Thatcherette - that is how he sought election
and that is how he got elected. It means that the policies that
brought the poll tax, recession, heavy mortgages and rising
unemployment will go on,'' said Labor Party leader Neil Kinnock.
   Major took a congratulatory call Tuesday night from President
Bush and was cheered wildly by Tories when he showed up in the
House of Commons to vote against an opposition motion on teachers'
pay.
   It was the climax of four weeks of turmoil that upended the
British political landscape and drove the Western world's longest
serving leader from office to a new life in a large suburban house
in Dulwich, south London.
   The spark was a new dispute a month ago over Mrs. Thatcher's
combative attitude toward the rest of the European Community. Her
deputy, Sir Geoffrey Howe, resigned and accused her of undermining
Britain's interests. Heseltine then challenged and won enough votes
to force a runoff.
   Persuaded by party leaders she could not win, Mrs. Thatcher
withdrew.

   Construction crews raced to stabilize a
storm-weakened bridge before the arrival today of a new storm they
said could rip apart the main link between Seattle and its eastern
suburbs.
   Seven tugboats held the Interstate 90 bridge in place late
Tuesday while workers welded broken cables and dropped ships'
anchors weighing several tons apiece in an effort to secure it.
   Two temporary replacement cables were being installed today and
seven could be in place by the end of the week, officials said.
   The bridge was damaged Sunday when the adjacent Lake Washington
bridge collapsed after a driving rainstorm and crashed into the
I-90 span's support cables.
   A new storm was expected to bring rain and wind up to 40 mph by
tonight.
   The weekend storm caused 20 rivers across the state to flood,
and high water drove more than 2,600 people from their homes. One
person drowned. The water swamped the pontoons of the 50-year-old
Lake Washington bridge, which had been closed for repairs.
   The year-old I-90 bridge's westbound lanes were reopened to
taffic Tuesday, but officials said they would be closed again if
winds exceed 25 mph and the bridge has not been secured.
   ``I'm real nervous if we get 100 mph or 50 mph wind before we
get anchor cables in place,'' said Ron Anderson, district
administrator for the state Department of Transportation.
   With the 1{-mile I-90 bridge closed Monday, commuters faced
one-hour back-ups on the four-lane Evergreen Point bridge, the only
other crossing between Seattle and the eastern suburbs, or had to
drive 20 miles around the lake.
   The cause of the bridge collapse is under investigation.

   House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt said
today he opposes the use of military force in the near future to
oust Iraq from Kuwait, urging President Bush to follow a policy of
``patient strength.''
   ``Stay the course. Stick with the sanctions. Do not try to mount
an offensive military action in the near future,'' the Missouri
Democrat said in a speech.
   Gephardt's opposition to any congressional resolution
authorizing use of force is the first public break among the
Democratic leadership, who said last week that Bush would have a
better chance of winning congressional approval for the use of
force in the Persian Gulf if the United Nations first backed such a
move.
   His remarks came as the Senate Armed Services Committee began
its second day of hearings on the prospects of U.S. military action
against Iraq. Democrats on Tuesday demanded that Bush give Congress
the same opportunity as the United Nations to debate a resolution
authorizing military force.
   Former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger told the panel today
he did not believe the United States could sustain nearly 430,000
troops in the gulf for an extended period of time.
   ``The issue in Arabia is not American staying power but the host
country's domestic stability. Conditions in the gulf are not even
remotely comparable to Europe or Northeast Asia,'' Kissinger said.
   The former Nixon administration official contended that the
sanctions and the possible use of military force are not successive
phases of the same policy.
   ``They will prove mutually exclusive because by the time it is
evident that sanctions alone cannot succeed, a credible military
option will probably no longer exist,'' Kissinger said.
   Gephardt, in a speech to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said,
``Before we resort to offensive military action, Congress and the
American people will need to be convinced that the policy of
pressure, isolation and sanctions has failed. President Bush has
yet to make such an argument,''
   ``The policy of patient strength is, I think, our best hope,''
Gephardt said.
   Gephardt made his comments while two former chairmen of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff bolstered the Democratic challenge to Bush to
give United Nations sanctions time to work.
   ``My main concern with this latest scheduled reinforcement isn't
that we might choose to fight, but rather that the deployment might
cause us to fight - perhaps prematurely and perhaps
unnecessarily,'' David C. Jones told the Armed Services Committee.
   Both Jones and retired Adm. William Crowe said the sanctions are
the best option at this time and expressed concern about the
long-term effect of military action in the Middle East.
   ``I counsel patience. War is not neat, it's not tidy. It's a
mess,'' Crowe said at the hearing.
   President Bush's press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater, declined to
respond directly to the statements by Gephardt and the former
chairmen of the joint chiefs.
   ``Obviously there are going to be different opinions,''
Fitzwater told reporters.
   Fitzwater said Bush does not plan to ask Congress for authority
to launch hostilities under the War Powers Act. The president
maintains he has the authority to take such action with or without
congressional approval.
   In later testimony today, Crowe said he saw no ``significant
breaks'' in the international sanctions and urged the
administration and Congress to give them a year to 18 months to
take effect.
   ``The issue is not whether an embargo will work, but whether we
have the patience to let it take effect,'' Crowe said.
   The retired admiral said he believed the American people, who
waited out 40 years of the Cold War, have the patience for the
sanctions.
   ``It would be a sad commentary if Saddam Hussein, a two-bit
tyrant who sits on 17 million people and possesses a gross national
product of $40 billion, proved to be more patient than the United
States, the world's most affluent and powerful nation,'' Crowe
said.
   Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., the president pro tem of the
Senate, agreed that the American people have the patience.
   ``When we view grandmothers and grandfathers who lost not one
but two, three grandchildren and they feel we took the action too
hastily, I think we'll all have the time to be sorry,'' Byrd said.
   ``The American people are willing to sacrifice,'' he added.
   On Tuesday, committee chairman Sam Nunn, D-Ga., told the hearing
that an expected U.N. resolution authorizing the use of military
force to eject Iraq from Kuwait ``is not a substitute for fully
informing the American people of our own nation's objectives and
strategy.''
   Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., the No. 2 Democrat on the House
Foreign Affairs Committee, told reporters he believed Bush should
send an emissary to Baghdad to make sure Saddam isn't ``confused''
about the U.S. position.
   While agreeing that no talk of compromise can be made until Iraq
withdraws from Kuwait, Hamilton said ``a strong argument can be
made to talk to him directly or indirectly. I don't see we have a
lot to lose.''

   Two government agencies said Wednesday they
will coordinate programs to protect employees and those who live
near industrial sites.
   ``This ... effort will help to minimize the potential for
work-related injury and death, reduce adverse health effects for
the public and prevent environmental contamination,'' said acting
Labor Secretary Roderick A. DeArment.
   The Environmental Protection Agency and the Occupational Safety
and Health Administration, a part of the Labor Department, will
conduct joint inspections and training, as well as exchange
information on violations.
   The agencies initially will focus on petrochemical plants and
lead smelters. The agreement calls for setting priorities and
targeting different industries each year.
   Last summer, OSHA issued regulations governing the petrochemical
industry after two accidents near Houston killed 40 workers. EPA
has agreed to give OSHA a list of the chemicals and data on
accidental releases at selected plants.
   EPA already has targeted 28 lead smelters and OSHA will provide
data on inspections and violations.
   EPA Administrator William K. Reilly said cooperation ``will help
our two agencies monitor and reduce pollutants inside facilities
where workers are most likely to be directly exposed to toxic and
hazardous chemicals.''
   Peg Seminario, director of occupational health at the AFL-CIO,
said the agreement reflects the growing realization that worker
safety and environmental problems ``are often one and the same.''

<HEAD>Bush Signs 1990 Farm Legislation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN FLESHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush on Wednesday signed into law a
five-year, $170 billion farm bill that curbs federal subsidies and
champions environmental protection.
   ``This is the most environmentally progressive farm bill ever
signed,'' Bush said at a White House signing ceremony as
Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter and key farm-state lawmakers
looked on.
   The measure, approved by Congress in October, also renews for
five years the food stamp program that helps feeds the nation's
poor. It freezes minimum commodity target prices at 1990 levels and
cuts subsidized acreage 15 percent, a provision some senators
opposed.
   The federal deficit-reduction plan approved last month requires
a $13 billion cut in spending on farm programs through fiscal 1995.
   Bush said the new law builds on the success of the 1985 farm
bill, which has led to record farm income in recent years.
   ``It's a market-oriented bill that lets farmers make more of
their own production decisions based on the market, rather than on
government support prices,'' he said at the signing ceremony,
driven indoors from the Rose Garden by a drizzle.
   ``It also encourages the research that is so crucial to helping
our farmers maintain their global lead in agriculture,'' he said.
   The bill pegs the basic loan rates for wheat and feed grain to
85 percent of the five-year moving average of market prices,
excluding the high and low years.
   It establishes national standards for organic farming, a rural
development administration within the Agriculture Department to
help communities recover economically from loss of farms, and a
matching fund program for rural businesses.
   ``This farm bill will help farmers protect water quality and
wildlife habitat, and its greater flexibility will boost crop
rotation, in turn helping to control weeds and pests and erosion,''
Bush said.
   It creates a wetlands reserve and bolsters an existing
Conservation Reserve Program that pays farmers to plant trees on
highly erodible cropland. The goal is to enroll 40 million to 45
million new acres in the reserve.
   It also sets up a program to encourage farmers to prevent
contamination of ground and surface water on 10 million acres of
land, and requires the Agriculture Department to help farmers meet
state and federal environmental standards.
   Additional provisions require farmers to keep records of
hazardous pesticide use and authorize the first effort to assess
the threat of global climate change on agriculture.
   The bill sets new limits on restructuring Farmers Home
Administration loans to help delinquent borrowers satisfy their
debt obligations. Borrowers will have a lifetime maximum of
$300,000 in debt forgiveness under restructuring and buyouts.
   It authorizes government-to-government grant food assistance for
developing countries and increases by $1 billion the credit
guarantees available to promote U.S. agricultural exports to
emerging democracies.
   Bush pledged to ``bring home a fair deal for American farmers''
in global trade talks that are nearing completion. He promised not
to sign any agreement he considers unfair.

<HEAD>Scientist's Daughter Says Likelihood Of Midwest Quake Next Week
Declines</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The scientist who said an earthquake was
probable in the Midwest this weekend now reportedly thinks a quake
is more likely outside the United States.
   Dr. Iben Browning created a furor across the Midwest when he
said there was a strong chance of a major earthquake Dec. 2-3 in an
area that includes the New Madrid Fault, from Arkansas through
Missouri to Illinois.
   But San Francisco radio station KCBS today reported that a woman
who said she was Browning's daughter said he now believes there's a
50-50 chance of a major quake outside the United States. The woman
answered the phone at Browning's home in New Mexico and identified
itself as Evelyn Browning-Garriss.
   There's a smaller chance in the Midwest and almost no chance one
will hit the San Francisco Bay area's Hayward Fault, she said.
   Browning has insisted he never predicted an earthquake for the
Midwest. He said he only suggested it was probable based on his
observations of powerful high tides caused by the alignment of the
Earth, moon and sun.
   He says such forces can trigger earthquakes. He pointed out that
on Dec. 2, there will be the highest tidal force in 60 years.
   ``The high tidal forces are going to be affecting 30 to 60
degrees North (latitude), which includes almost all of America,
Japan, parts of China and the Middle East, and we were concerned
about a number of places,'' said Browning-Garriss.
   Browning-Garriss could not be reached today by The Associated
Press. The telephone at Browning's residence in Tijeras outside
Albuquerque was repeatedly busy today and the operator said it was
off the hook. On Tuesday, a woman who said she was Browning's
daughter said he Browning was on vacation and unavailable.

<HEAD>Revised Report Says Economy Even Weaker Than First Thought in 3rd
Quarter</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Economy, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. economy staggered ahead at an annual
rate of 1.7 percent - even weaker than first reported - from July
through September, the government said Wednesday.
   The Commerce Department based its downward revision in the gross
national product, the total output of goods and services, on new
information about economic performance in the third quarter.
Originally, the department had said the GNP rose 1.8 percent.
   Consumer spending was revised from a 3.6 percent gain to a 3.2
percent advance. Inventories fell faster than first reported,
dropping $4.4 billion instead of the originally estimated $1.7
billion.
   Housing construction was off 19.2 percent instead of 15.4
percent while government spending rose just 0.6 percent rather than
the 1.3 percent gain first reported.
   The largest upward revision in the GNP came from an improvement
in the nation's trade deficit, from $7.9 billion to just $500
million.
   Business investment expanded 8.2 percent from July through
September, even higher than the 7.4 percent gain first reported
last month.
   The changes meant the total GNP was growing at an
inflation-adjusted, annual rate of $4.17 trillion in the third
quarter, a gain of $18 billion over the second quarter.
   Kermit Baker of Cahners Economics in Newton, Mass., suggested
the revision meant ``the economy was tailing off a bit at the end
of the quarter.''
   ``The economy clearly has weakened a lot,'' Baker added, saying
the third quarter GNP ``is not at all reflective of what we'll see
in the fourth quarter.''
   Worse, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, usually cautious
in describing the economy, said Wednesday, ``All indications are
that a meaningful downturn in aggregate output occurred as we moved
through October into November.''
   Economist Bruce Steinberg of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets in
New York agreed. ``I think the fourth quarter weakness is very
widespread,'' he said.
   Many analysts believe the economy slipped into a recession
following the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and the subsequent
oil price increases. A recession generally is defined as two
consecutive quarterly declines in the GNP.
   The Commerce Department also reported that orders to U.S.
factories for durable goods jumped 3.6 percent in October, to a
seasonally adjusted $129.4 billion, after falling 1.6 percent the
previous month.
   Excluding a 14.6 percent gain in the transportation sector,
however, durable-goods orders actually fell 0.4 percent. Most of
the transportation orders were for aircraft.
   Nevertheless, non-defense capital goods orders, often a
barometer of future business investment plans, rose 8.3 percent and
continued to be one of the few improvements reflected in the
third-quarter GNP report.
   In a third report, the department said corporate after-tax
profits jumped 6.7 percent during the third quarter, although
Steinberg attributed most of that gain to inflation.
   The department also reported that a GNP measure of inflation
rose at an annual rate of 4.2 percent, up slightly from 4.1 percent
in the initial report. A 3.9 percent inflation rate was posted in
the second quarter, a 6.4 percent rate in the first.

<HEAD>Study Finds Estrogen Slightly Increases Breast Cancer Chances</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Women using estrogen after menopause run a
slightly greater risk of breast cancer, according to a study of
more than 118,000 nurses.
   But the authors of the study, which appears in Wednesday's
Journal of the American Medical Association, emphasized that the
increased risk was modest and noted estrogen therapy holds many
benefits for post-menopausal women.
   ``While this study adds to a large body of information, I would
not recommend that a woman change her current use of estrogen
therapy based on these data alone,'' said one of the authors, Dr.
Meir Stampfer, of the Harvard School of Public Health in Boston.
   The researchers, led by Graham Colditz of Boston's Brigham and
Women's Hospital, also said the additional risk of breast cancer
dropped a year after the women stopped taking the female sex
hormones.
   Taking estrogen after menopause can help prevent calcium loss
from bones and may help to prevent heart disease, the leading
killer of older women.
   Even so, ``these data suggest the need for caution in the use of
estrogens,'' the authors wrote.
   Researchers found the post-menopausal women taking estrogen were
35 percent to 40 percent more likely to develop breast cancer than
those who did not take the hormone. But the risk was only about
half that a woman might face if her mother had breast cancer,
researchers said.
   The article analyzed data collected from 1976 to 1986 from more
than 118,000 women from the Nurses' Health Study.
   The Nurses' Health Study, established to study risk factors for
cancer and other diseases, was begun in 1976 with a group of more
than 121,000 female registered nurses 30 to 55 years old.
   The data analyzed 367,187 person-years of follow-up among
post-menopausal women, the researchers said. In all, 722 incidents
of breast cancer were identified among these women.

   A federal judge Wednesday lifted a ban on
broadcasting tapes of Manuel Noriega's prison telephone calls,
defusing a confrontation between the rights of the media and those
of a criminal defendant.
   While CNN hailed the decision as a victory over censorship,
Noriega's defense and constitutional specialists said the case
showed the U.S. Supreme Court was willing to accept at least
temporary restrictions on the press.
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler's decision ended a
three-week legal battle between Noriega and the network, which
aired some of the tapes before the judge ordered CNN to stop.
   CNN President Tom Johnson said the decision would allow the
network to pursue its story on the government's taping of the
ousted Panamanian leader's conversations.
   ``CNN's coverage of this possible misconduct was delayed by this
judicial prior restraint on press freedom,'' he said. ``Despite the
unfortunate delay, CNN's reporting of government taping of Noriega
phone conversations will continue.''
   The judge ruled after he and the attorneys reviewed transcripts
of seven tapes the network submitted to the court last week
following the Supreme Court's refusal to overturn Hoeveler's
initial ban.
   At Wednesday's hearing, Noiega defense attorney Frank Rubino
told the judge he would withdraw his request to stop the
broadcasts. He said the only tape that appeared to violate
lawyer-client privilege already had been broadcast.
   ``The problem today is that the tape's out, it's been published
to the world,'' Rubino said.
   ``It does no good to close the barn door after the horse is
out.''
   Federal prosecutors said they had no objections to lifting the
ban, once again insisting that Noriega's rights were never violated
by the routine prison taping.
   Rubino said outside the courtroom that the case has already left
its mark in the balancing of First Amendment protections for
freedom of speech and Sixth Amendment guarantees of a fair trial.
   ``The Supreme Court has upheld prior restraint and ordered CNN
to turn the tapes over to the court, and CNN complied with the
court,'' Rubino said. ``Prior restraint is in full force and
effect.''
   Rodney Smolla, a William and Mary law professor who heads the
school's Institute of Bill of Rights Law, also said the case has
left a legacy, in part because the Supreme Court refused to halt
the ban.
   He said it would have been better had the issue returned to the
high court for a final resolution.
   ``It casts its shadow, and the shadow is negative,'' said
Smolla. ``Other lawyers will aggressively pursue these sorts of
strategies against news organization. The battle isn't over yet.''
   Jane Kirtley, head of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the
Press, said the ruling showed the gag order should never have been
issued in the first place, but she added she was worried about the
precedent set.
   ``The unfortunate effect of that is that a new organization has
been unconstitutionally constrained for several weeks from bringing
information lawfully obtained to the attention of the general
public,'' she said. ``That damage cannot be rectified.''
   CNN's legal problems haven't ended, Noriega's defense attorneys
contend. They want the judge to find CNN in contempt of court for
airing one of the tapes even after the judge's initial ban, and
fine the network $300,000 per violation. The judge has not said
whether he will schedule a contempt hearing.
   Such a hearing could reopen the issue of whether the prior
restraint was permissible, said William Greenhalgh a law professor
at Georgetown University.
   ``Now, it's much ado about nothing,'' he said. ``We've avoided
the constitutional issue - but if there is a contempt proceeding,
then we would really get into it.''
   The tape that touched off the dispute was between Noriega and
one of Rubino's investigators, with the lawyer's Spanish-speaking
secretary serving as an interpreter. In the conversation, Noriega
is asked about two recently arrested Panamanians, and speculates
that prosecutors intend to use them as witnesses against him.
   Rubino went into court Nov. 8 and Hoeveler ordered CNN not to
broadcast any tapes that interfere with attorney-client privilege.
The network aired the tape later that day, but withdrew it the
following day when the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals backed
Hoeveler.
   The Supreme Court then refused to intervene on a 7-2 vote,
forcing CNN to submit the tapes to the judge for review.
   The government has acknowledged routine taping of prisoners'
phone calls at federal prisons, including the Metropolitan
Correctional Center, where Noriega is being held on drug-smuggling
charges. Noriega signed a release acknowledging his calls were
being monitored, but the defense said that release does not apply
to conversations with his attorneys.
   Hoeveler on Wednesday ordered the Bureau of Prisons to cease
sharing Noriega's tapes with other government agencies unless he
approves.
   Following the hearing, the judge returned the tapes to CNN's
attorneys. The judge's clerk said the tape transcripts remained
sealed at the request of the network.
   Rubino has accused President Guillermo Endara's government in
Panama of giving the tapes to CNN after obtaining them from the
U.S. government, ridiculing an ongoing FBI probe of the leak.
   Gregory Craig, an attorney for Panama in that nation's $6.5
billion racketeering lawsuit against Noriega, submitted an
affidavit in that case Tuesday indicating he had received
``information'' from the tapes, including items never broadcast by
CNN.
   Craig strongly denied Wednesday that he had heard the actual
tapes, however, but refused to say whether his information came
from the Panamanian government.
   Noriega is charged with drug trafficking in a February 1988
indictment accusing him of accepting $4.6 million in bribes from
the Medellin drug cartel to protect cocaine shipments to the United
States.

<HEAD>Safety Rules for Mail-Order Foods</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Holiday shoppers who buy mail-order food
should be mindful of a few safety rules, the Agriculture Department
said Wednesday.
   ``Many consumers mistakenly think that because a meat or poultry
product is vacuum packaged, canned or smoked, it doesn't need
refrigeration,'' said Sue Templin of the department's Food Safety
and Inspection Service.
   ``In fact,'' she said, ``most of these products must be
refrigerated. Consumers should check the label or ordering
information to see if refrigeration is required.''
   Templin, who manages the agency's toll-free consumer hotline,
said mail-order companies are responsible for shipping perishable
meat and poultry products safely, often using frozen gel packs or
dry ice and insulated containers to keep products below 40 degrees
Fahrenheit during shipment.
   Food technologist Robert Savage said turkeys, hams and other
meats are smoked for flavor, not preservation. Country hams, on the
other hand, have a high salt content and are dry. These are safe at
room temperature for up to a year if uncooked and unsliced.
   Also, he said, hard dry sausages or processed cheeses can be
kept at room temperatures for four to six weeks if unopened. But
some do require refrigeration.
   Questions about food safety for mail-order gifts may be referred
to the department's meat and poultry hotline weekdays from 10 a.m.
to 4 p.m. EST at 1-800-535-4555. In the Washington, D.C., area,
call 202-447-3333.

<HEAD>Sweeping Changes in Land Use Practices Suggested to Protect
Chesapeake</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN ROLL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of a gubernatorial commission are
recommending dramatic changes in land-use practices in Maryland
because they are alarmed that population growth will doom the
Chesapeake Bay.
   The proposal unveiled Tuesday also recognizes political
realities and tries to steer a middle course.
   The drafting committee of the Governor's Commission on Growth in
the Chesapeake Region urged passage of legislation designed to
direct growth to areas where its environmental effects will be
minimized.
   ``The time has come - not to stop growth - but to grow in a
logical, efficient pattern. That's the goal of this legislation,''
said Walter A. Frey III, chairman of the panel.
   ``This is not an issue of growth versus no-growth,'' Frey said.
``The committee's recommendations emphasized the need to protect
both the environment and the state's economy, because economic
development is a key part of Maryland's quality of life.''
   The draft plan would require local governments to submit for
state approval 30-year growth management programs. The programs
would have to outlaw all new growth in environmentally sensitive
areas, such as land around streams and key wildlife habitats.
   The local plans also would have to restrict new development on
farmland and in forests to one housing unit for every 20 acres.
   In general, the proposal is designed to ensure that most new
building take place in existing communities or be ``clustered'' to
save as much land as possible.
   Frey said by ending the sprawl that characterizes current
development trends in Maryland, as much as two-thirds of the land
that would have been used for building can be saved.
   Despite the dramatic changes proposed by the panel, the
commission's chairman characterized the proposal as a moderate
approach.
   ``It's my feeling what we are proposing is a minimal program,''
said former Rep. Michael D. Barnes, D-Md.. ``I wish we could go
much further.
   ``We have in the bay today 1 percent of the oysters that were
there in our grandfathers' time. Our grandchildren are not going to
have crabs if we don't change.''
   The draft plan will now be considered by the full commission and
then submitted to Gov. William Donald Schaefer in January, in time
for consideration by the 1991 General Assembly session.
   Alarmed by projections that Maryland's population would jump by
1 million during the next 30 years and the environmental
implications of that increase, Schaefer last fall formed the Barnes
commission. At the time he called for an ``action agenda.''

   Sizzle. Sizzle. Ouch!
   The people who run MTV, the cable channel that televises music
videos, think Madonna's rendition of ``Justify My Love'' is too hot
to handle and they've decided to ban it.
   After viewing the fantasy-filled video that features
bisexuality, cross-dressing and mild sadomasochism, MTV honchos
decided, ``This one is just not for us,'' said spokeswoman Carole
Robinson.
   The queen of undulating underwear expressed mild surprise.
   ``Why is it that people are willing to go to a movie and watch
someone get blown to bits for no reason and nobody wants to see two
girls kissing or two men snuggling?'' she asked.
   But she added, ``MTV has been good to me and they know their
audience. If it's too strong for them, I understand that.''
   The black and white video, shot in Paris, was supposed to
premiere on MTV on Saturday during a weekend ``Madonnathon.''
   ``Justify My Love'' is one of two new singles on Madonna's
recently released ``The Immaculate Collection'' anthology.
   MTV was promoting the video's premiere with a snippet showing
Madonna, in black lace, and her real-life beau, Tony Ward, locked
in a steamy, suggestive embrace in a hotel hallway.
   ``That was the only portion of the video we had received,''
Robinson said. After MTV's acquisition committee reviewed the whole
video, ``We passed on it,'' she said.
   The ``Madonnathon'' will go on as planned, she added.
   Robinson said the decision to ax the video caused no friction.
``We love Madonna. We've had and will continue to have a terrific
relationship.''
   But don't weep too much for the ``Material Girl.''
   The video, which one music critic described as being ``Marilyn
Monroe meets `Cabaret' in the S&amp;M Hotel,'' is being packaged as a
single by Warner Bros. and is due in stores by Dec. 18.

   Cardinal Wladyslaw Rubin, a Ukrainian-born
prelate who headed the Vatican's Congregation for Eastern Churches,
died Wednesday at the age of 73, church officials said.
   The Vatican did not give the cause of death.
   Rubin was ordained in 1946 and became a bishop 18 years later.
He was responsible for the pastoral care of Poles living abroad.
   He was elevated to cardinal in 1979 and also served as
secretary-general of the Synod of Bishops.
   His congregation dealt with churches of the Eastern rite, which
have many different customs from the Roman Catholic Church but
acknowledge the pope as their leader.
   Pope John Paul, a friend of Rubin's, called him a ``truly good
and faithful servant of God and of the church in tasks of
particular delicacy and responsibility.''
   With Rubin's death, 143 cardinals remain. Of those, 102 are
under age 80 and therefore meet the requirement to vote for a
future pope.
   Cardinals are the highest-ranking officials in the Catholic
Church after the pope.

<HEAD>Liberian Cease-Fire Signed</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The three factions that have fought an
11-month war for control of Liberia signed a cease-fire accord
Wednesday, raising hopes for an end to massacres that have claimed
more than 10,000 lives.
   Nigeria's president said a regional military task force will
remain in Liberia indefinitely to monitor the truce.
   The agreement was signed at the end of a summit convened in this
West African nation to seek a settlement of the Liberian civil war.
Leaders of 13 nations attended.
   Signing the agreement, according to witnesses, were Charles
Taylor, head of the main rebel faction; a representative of Prince
Johnson, leader of a breakaway rebel force; and Wilmot Diggs, a
Liberian army officer representing the followers of slain President
Samuel Doe.
   Also signing was Gambia's head of state, Sir Dawda Jawara,
chairman of the West African regional organization that sponsored
the talks.
   Details of the cease-fire's provisions were not immediately
available.
   President Ibrahim Babangida of Nigeria, military ruler of the
region's most powerful nation, was among those at the summit. He
said Nigeria would offer development aid to Liberia, and that a
military task force would stay on to oversee the cease-fire.
   ``We have a commitment to assist the country in its
rehabilitation efforts when peace returns, and I am hoping that
will be in the next six months,'' Babangida told reporters.
   He depicted Taylor as a patriot who would cooperate in the peace
process.
   The summit took place in Mali's capital, Bamako, 400 miles
northeast of the Liberian capital, Monrovia.
   It marked the first time that leaders of all three Liberian
factions negotiated face to face. Taylor had refused to attend
previous peace talks.
   He began the uprising by invading Liberia from the Ivory Coast
on Dec. 24. He has declared himself president and says his forces
control most of Liberia, founded in 1847 by freed American slaves.
   The faction led by Prince Johnson broke with Taylor, and
Johnson's fighters killed Doe in September.
   The 8,000-strong West African task force arrived in Liberia on
Aug. 5 and was attacked by Taylor's rebels. It replied with bombing
raids and heavy bombardments that forced Taylor's fighters from
Monrovia's eastern suburbs.
   The West African task force is made up of soldiers from Nigeria,
Ghana, Guinea, Gambia and Sierra Leone. The leaders of all of those
countries were at the conference in Mali except Guinea, which sent
a Cabinet minister.
   Also at the conference was veteran opposition politician Amos
Sawyer, who was installed as Liberian president with the backing of
the West African task force.
   Taylor last week began shelling the port of Monrovia, where the
West Africans have set up headquarters and hundreds of civilians
have sought refuge.
   Johnson and government officials agreed previously to a
cease-fire and had accepted Sawyer's mandate to organize fair
elections.
   Most of the casualties in the war have been civilians. About
half of Liberia's 2.3 million people have sought refuge in
neighboring nations.
   The West African task force says it controls Monrovia, but
refugees who fled this week said Doe's former soldiers and
Johnson's guerrillas terrorize and kill civilians in the capital.

   Last Friday, President Bush met in Geneva with
the president of Syria. On Sunday, the Washington representative of
Cuban President Fidel Castro was invited to chat with the State
Department's No. 3 official.
   Bush must be serious about the Persian Gulf crisis: A third of
the countries on the official terrorism list got high-level access
in a space of 48 hours.
   And the wooing of Cuba continued Wednesday when Secretary of
State James A. Baker III scheduled an evening meeting with that
nation's foreign minister.
   These are classic examples of what is known in diplomatic
parlance as a ``competing interest.''
   Under normal circumstances, the United States does not deal at
senior levels with Syrian or Cuban representatives. But the Persian
Gulf crisis is of such magnitude that a business-as-usual posture
does not apply.
   Because of a competing interest, the Roosevelt administration
overlooked Stalin's slaughter of millions during the 1930s in order
to make common cause with the Soviet Union against Nazi Germany in
the 1940s. Not many people inquired about Stalin's human rights
record.
   Thirty years later, when the Soviets were the pariah, President
Nixon jetted off to China during the height of the Cultural
Revolution - another example of mass repression - because he saw
China as a useful counterweight to Moscow.
   Human rights took a back seat because of a competing interest.
   The same mentality is at work now in the U.S. effort to stop
Saddam Hussein.
   The gulf crisis has enabled China to break out part way from its
diplomatic isolation resulting from the crackdown on pro-democracy
demonstrators 18 months ago.
   China's foreign minister will visit Washington on Friday. It is
an invitation he might not have received were it not for the
campaign the administration has waged with Security Council members
for support for a resolution authorizing the use of force against
Iraq.
   At a minimum, China has indicated it will not use its veto power
to kill the resolution.
   Last weekend, newspapers were awash with photos showing Bush in
a playful mood with Syrian President Hafez Assad, a leader whose
human rights record is viewed by some experts as being on a par
with Saddam's.
   Justifying the encounter, Bush said: ``I have no problem sitting
down with him (Assad) for this common objective.''
   Bush felt Syria's ``front line'' role in the multinational
force, including its commitment eventually to deploy 20,000 troops,
warranted high-level U.S. recognition.
   The meeting did not go unnoticed in Israel, where officials
noted that Bush has yet to stop for a visit.
   On Wednesday, however, Bush agreed to meet with Yitzhak Shamir
next month when the Israeli prime minister makes a private visit to
the United States.
   Syria has been on the State Department's terrorism list since
1986. It is alleged to have masterminded an attempt to blow up an
Israeli airliner in London.
   Cuba has been a diplomatic outcast in Washington for years. Not
since before President Reagan's 1981 inaugural has a Cuban official
been on a State Department invitation list - even for a social
gathering.
   The last high-level U.S.-Cuban one-on-one meeting? Veteran Cuba
watchers say there haven't been any since Castro met with Vice
President Nixon in 1959.
   Thus, it was highly unusual when the department's third-ranking
official, Under Secretary Robert Kimmitt, invited Castro's chief
diplomat in Washington, Jose Arbesu, for a chat Sunday.
   Both countries are members of the United Nations Security
Council and both made it clear the discussion was limited to the
Persian Gulf crisis. For its part, the Bush administration has no
interest in discussing bilateral political topics with Cuba.
   There's little doubt that Washington would be quite pleased if
Cuba came around to the U.S. view of the gulf crisis, but that
seems highly unlikely given Cuba's opposition to some previous
Council resolutions on the gulf.
   The other countries on the State Department terrorism list are
North Korea, Libya, Iran and, of course, Iraq.

Wednesday.
   Michael Gerety said Coleman was ``resting comfortably and in

   Gerety refused to reveal the name of the hospital or the Arizona
city, but a Tucson University Medical Center source who requested
anonymity said Coleman was in serious but stable condition
Wednesday. Coleman, who lives in Tuscon, was admitted under the
name Milos Shea, the source said.
   The 22-year-old actor was stable and ``is expected to make a

   Gerety didn't reveal the exact nature of Coleman's illness. The
4-foot-7 actor has had two kidney transplants and has a history of
renal disease.

<HEAD>Washington Accused of Ignoring Human Rights Abuses In Mexico</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration is being accused of
ignoring Mexican human rights abuses and election fraud in its
eagerness for the free trade pact that dominated talks at the
U.S.-Mexico summit.
   ``It has become indispensable for Washington's interests that
Mexico appears to be an example of democracy and respect for human
rights,'' one of Mexico's oldest human rights groups, the Eureka
Committee, said in an open letter to President Bush and President
Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
   ``But everyday reality is just the opposite. The will of
citizens is not respected in the ballot boxes, nor are the most
elemental social and human rights,'' the letter said. It was
published Tuesday.
   Salinas' spokesman, Carlos Garcia, on Wednesday declined comment
on the Eureka Committee letter.
   There was no immediate comment from the Bush administration.
   Mexico has been sharply criticized by international human rights
organizations such as Amnesty International and Americas Watch.
Election fraud is so common that Mexicans have an extensive slang
vocabulary for the myriad ways to cheat at the polls.
   Salinas, whose Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, has
governed Mexico for the last 61 years, has promised democratic
reforms, but not at the expense of what he calls political
stability.
   Skeptics say the PRI's idea of political stability is continued
one-party domination of Mexico, a country Peruvian novelist Mario
Vargas Llosa recently dubbed ``the perfect dictatorship.''
   Salinas has been widely praised in the United States for his
aggressive moves to open Mexico's long protected economy. His
slowness on political reform has gone largely unremarked.
   ``The PRI in power means a guarantee of forging ahead with the
free trade agreement,'' Riordan Roett, head of the Latin American
studies program at Johns Hopkins University in Washington, told the
daily El Financiero.
   Bush and Salinas said in advance that Mexico's internal affairs
would be off-limits at this week's summit.
   Bush ``doesn't want to embarrass Salinas,'' Susan Kaufman
Purcell, vice president of the New York City-based Americas
Society, said in a telephone interview Wednesday.
   The non-profit society, headed by David Rockefeller, is an
umbrella organization for business and professional interests in
Latin America.
   ``U.S. opponents of the free trade agreement can use arguments
for more democracy in Mexico to help defeat the agreement and it
works the same way in Mexico,'' Purcell said.
   Mexicans are nearly as ambivalent about pressure from Washington
as American officials are about disturbing Salinas. National
sovereignty is a near obsession in Mexico and even the fiercest
opponents of the PRI are reluctant to see outsiders get involved.
   Nonetheless, several opposition parties and human rights groups
held small demonstrations during the two-day summit - protests that
were overshadowed by the official events.
   The Eureka Committee, founded by mothers of people who have
disappeared, marked Bush's arrival with a protest in Monterrey
demanding the government account for 500 political prisoners.

<HEAD>High-Tech Deer Decoy Helps Nab Hunters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GREEN BOTTOM, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Poachers beware, RoboDeer is here.
   The state Division of Natural Resources has used a
remote-control der decoy, complete with a 12-point rack of
antlers, to arrest 120 hunters who illegally shot at the decoy from
roads during the last three weeks.
   The state's gun deer hunting season began Nov. 19 and ends
Monday.
   ``A lot of road-hunters were getting wise to our non-moving
decoys, so we decided to make one that moves,'' said Kenny Painter,
a DNR law enforcement captain. ``So far, it seems to work just
fine.''
   ``It's interesting and fun work because funny things happen
sometimes, but it's really serious because this sort of thing
really reflects badly on hunters and hunting,'' said Painter, who
operate the decoy dubbed RoboDeer.
   Previous decoys were little more than antlers and deer hides
tacked to crude frames. But a wiggle to the control joystick gives
a flick of the tail or turn of the head.
   Instead of setting the decoy in a grassy field, where it would
be obvious, Painter places the buck in a brushy area to make sure
the decoy isn't used to entrap hunters into committing illegal

   ``We don't want to make it too tempting,'' he said. ``We could
put a set of antlers on him that would knock your eyes out, but
again, we don't want to be so much of a temptation that no one

<HEAD>Greenspan, Fed Chief, Says `Meaningful Downturn' Has Begun</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said
Wednesday that oil-price problems from the Persian Gulf crisis have
pushed the economy into ``a meaningful downturn,'' confirming
private analysts' recession talk.
   Appearing before the House Banking Committee, he also said the
central bank can do little to cushion the effect of higher oil
prices on Americans' standard of living.
   Separately, the Commerce Department reported that the economy,
as measured by the gross national product, grew at a lackluster 1.7
percent annual rate in the July-September quarter, even worse than
the previously reported 1.8 percent rate.
   Most private analysts believe the economy has weakened sharply
since the quarter ended, an assessment Greenspan confirmed. But he
carefully avoided describing the deterioration as a recession,
which is defined as a contraction of six months or more in the GNP.
   ``All indications are that a meaningful downturn in aggregate
output occurred as we moved through October into November,''
Greenspan told the committee.
   Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., responded, ``This seems to me to
be a nice way of saying we've entered a recession.''
   Greenspan cautioned, however, that ``we won't know whether it is
the beginning of a recession or just some aberration in economic
activity for quite a while. ... We couldn't conceivably know for
certain until April or May of next year.''
   He said that another Commerce Department report Wednesday did
not fit with the weak data. Orders to U.S. factories for ``big
ticket'' durable goods, designed to last three or more years, rose
more strongly than anticipated in October, jumping 3.6 percent,
driven by orders for automobiles and aircraft.
   ``It is clearly the case ... that the world out there, when you
look at the hard data, is not in as bad shape as it feels,'' he
said.
   Greenspan conceded, though, that the GNP will contract in the
current quarter if the decline begun in October persists.
   At the White House, spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said the economy
is not in a recession yet, but added, ``I think everyone
acknowledges we're in a slow period.''
   Greenspan said oil prices, which have risen from $20 a barrel
before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2 to around $33 now,
are cutting the spending power of businesses and consumers. That
weakness is heightened, he said, by ``the enormous uncertainty
about how, and when, the tensions in the Persian Gulf will be
resolved,'' he said.
   The ``clearest manifestation'' of the oil shock is in the labor
market, where ``private employment and hours of work dropped
markedly in October,'' he said.
   ``The drop in employment and hours is causing personal income to
decline at the very time that rising energy prices are squeezing
many household budgets. This drop in rea purchasing power, along
with plunging consumer sentiment, does not bode well for the
near-term trends in consumer demand,'' he said.
   Also weakening the economy is a shortage of credit for
businesses, which Greenspan said ``has proceeded somewhat further''
than when he first noted it publicly in July.
   ``The available anecdotal information clearly suggests that many
types of businesses are encountering greater difficulty obtaining
financing,'' he said.
   The Fed has responded to the deteriorating economy by cutting
interest rates twice this month. Greenspan confirmed that the Fed
lowered the federal funds rate, which banks charge among themselves
for overnight loans, to 7.5 percent from 8 percent at the start of
the month.
   He resisted panel members' efforts to lure him into indicating
whether the Fed would continue to loosen its rein on credit.
   ``I could give you a qualified answer, but it would be so
muddled I'd just as soon not inflict it on you,'' he said.
   In his opening statement, Greenspan said, ``I can only offer the
assurance that the Federal Reserve will seek, as we have in the
past, to foster economic stability and sustainable growth.''
   He cautioned, however, ``There is no policy initiative that can
in the end prevent the transfer of wealth, and cut in our standard
of living, that stems from higher prices for imported oil.''
   The central bank's strategy is to raise interest rates to dampen
inflationary pressures and to cut rates when the economy needs a
boost. The bank must be careful in fighting a recession now because
of the inflationary effect of higher oil prices.
   Greenspan said prices are rising for goods and services heavily
dependent on oil, such as airline tickets. But he said that at the
moment the evidence suggests the oil shock has not passed into
wages.

   Prime Minister John Major welcomed his defeated
rivals into his Cabinet on Wednesday and called for a nation in
which all may prosper according to ``their talent, their
application and their good fortune.''
   ``I don't promise you that it will be easy and I don't promise
you that it will be quick,'' Major said outside 10 Downing St.
after being confirmed as prime minister by Queen Elizabeth II.
   ``If you forgive me,'' he added, ``I will go into No. 10
straight away and make a start right now.''
   Major, at 47 the youngest prime minister of the century, had
displayed both talent and tenacity in overcoming childhood poverty
and rising rapidly through the government.
   It was his fortune to be the popular choice of a party torn by
rebellion against his patron, Margaret Thatcher.
   Hours after saying farewell to her, Major announced a new
Cabinet lineup that reached across the bruised wings of the
Conservative Party.
   Michael Heseltine, the aggressor in a leadership race that
toppled Mrs. Thatcher, was appointed secretary of the environment -
and Major thanked him for his contributions to party unity.
   Chris Patten, the former environment secretary and a Tory
liberal, was installed as chairman of the party. The right-leaning
former chairman, Kenneth Baker, who had spent the past two weeks
sniping at Heseltine, was given the Cabinet post of home secretary.
   Douglas Hurd, who ran third in the leadership race, was kept as
foreign secretary and Tom King stayed as defense secretary,
emphasizing the continuity of Britain's tough stance in the Persian
Gulf crisis.
   The government also announced Wednesday that it was resuming
diplomatic relations with Syria, completing a rapprochement which
began under Mrs. Thatcher.
   Major said he hoped to build on the achievements of his
predecessor, who said in her own farewell speech that ``we leave
the United Kingdom in a very much better state than when we came
here 11{ years ago.''
   ``Now it is time for a new chapter to open and I wish John Major
all the luck in hhe world,'' said Mrs. Thatcher, leaving Downing
Street for a home in suburban Dulwich.
   Major, one of only two men in the Cabinet who did not attend a
university, said he wanted to ``build a society of opportunity.''
   ``By that I mean an open society, a society in which what people
fulfill will depend upon their talent, their application and their
good fortune,'' he said.
   ``In particular I want to build a country that is at ease with
itself, a country that is confident and a country that is prepared
and willing to make the changes necessary to provide a better
quality of life for all our citizens,'' said Major.
   The environment post was an ironic reward for the 57-year-old
Heseltine. It makes him responsible for revising the deeply
unpopular local tax known as the ``poll tax'' - the issue he had
turned very effectively against Mrs. Thatcher.
   It also brought Heseltine back to the office he occupied in Mrs.
Thatcher's first Cabinet of 1979. He became defense secretary in
1983, and abruptly resigned in 1986 in a bitter dispute with the
prime minister.
   Earlier in the day, Thatcher loyalist Cecil Parkinson had
resigned as secretary of transportation.
   A British prime minister takes office without parades, brass
bands and inaugural balls, and with only the briefest of speeches.
   Major is due to take his first turn answering prime minister's
questions in the House of Commons on Thursday, one week after he
announced he was a candidate for the job.
   As the candidate endorsed by Mrs. Thatcher, Major could risk
antagonizing the party's right wing by bringing Heseltine back into
the government.
   Heseltine and Hurd had taken the initiative to begin the healing
within the party, conceding defeat within minutes of one another on
Tuesday night, although Major had fallen two votes short of the
majority required under party rules.
   Some insiders saw the big swing to Major as due partly to what
one called the ``guilt factor'' about dumping Mrs. Thatcher and
partly to his status as her protege.
   ``There is no ill feeling at the end of this contest,'' Major
said. ``I believe that there is a smile on the face of the party
that will mean we are fully united for the future.''

<TEXT>
   Residents of two low-income neighborhoods have
become so frustrated with crime that groups of them ar patrolling
streets with shotguns, a city councilwoman said.
   ``There is significant crime within the Dallas area. However,
there is greater crime in poor neighborhoods,'' Deputy Mayor Pro
Tem Diane Ragsdale said Tuesday. ``To that end, neighborhoods have
looked for a means of survival.''
   Another proposal for fighting crime, enlisting the help of the
National Guard, was withdrawn at a council meeting Wednesday after
members of the south Dallas community objected.
   Police are predicting record levels of violent crime in Dallas.
The homicide tally for the year is a record 400. But officers said
the civilian patrols could result in an increased number of
shootings.
   ``We certainly encourage citizens to get involved to help the
police fight crime. We do not encourage citizens to arm themselves
to do this,'' said police spokesman Sgt. Jim Chandler.
   Ms. Ragsdale said the shotgun patrols began in two poor
neighborhoods in south Dallas because the communities are
dissatisfied with police protection are just looking for ways to
cope.
   ``I think a lot of it is out of frustration,'' she said. ``The
police department constantly says that they're overworked and
underpaid and stretched too thin. And so the community is looking
for constructive ways to help themselves.''
   She wouldn't identify the neighborhoods or say how many
civilians were patrolling.
   ``Middle-class neighborhoods can ... hire off-duty police
officers or security officers. Poor neighborhoods cannot afford
that luxury,'' she said. ``We do live in America, and people have a
right to defend themselves and their neighborhoods and their
families, as long as it's within the law.''
   Ms. Ragsdale denied the groups were made up of vigilantes.
``These are responsible people that are doing this. These aren't
irresponsible people,'' she said.
   But Chandler said armed civilian patrols are dangerous.
   ``There's no telling who they might encounter when they're out
there doing that,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   Radcliffe College has given the Smithsonian
Institution a set of the papers of Amelia Earhart, the aviatrix
whose legend endures more than a half-century after she disappeared
into the Pacific skies.
   Earhart's letters to her mother, telegrams of congratulations
from admirers and quack theories that she is still living somewhere
on an isolated Pacific reef are among the 11 reels of microfilm
given to Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum in a ceremony
Tuesday evening.
   ``To think that I'm standing here looking right at her airplane
is very special to me,'' said Patricia King, director of
Radcliffe's Schlesinger library. She said the papers, donated
during the 1960s by Earhart's sister, are among the most prized at
the university.
   ``They attract the attention of scholars and students. We get
letters from sixth graders from the Midwest who want to know more
about Amelia Earhart,'' King said.
   In 1932 Earhart gained worldwide fame by becoming the first
woman to cross the Atlantic alone. That same year she also became
the first to fly cross-country alone. And in January 1935 Earhart
made the first solo flight by anyone from Honolulu to the U.S.
mainland.
   Earhart's bright red Lockheed Vega 5-B used in the
trans-Atlantic and cross-country flights, along with her flight
jacket and radio, are on display at the museum.
   ``The project involved a gamble but gambling is a human frailty
and I suppose there is a certain extra fascination in playing for
high stakes,'' Earhart wrote in an article contained in the
collection. ``The stakes on this throw, of course, was my life
against the joy of doing something I wanted to do very much.''
   Earhart often discussed the subject of courage and declared
women at least the equal of men. She insisted that women should
have the same freedoms as men and, in a speech to the Daughters of
the American Revolution in 1933, said women should be drafted in
war along with men.
   She worried publicly about ``becoming a heavy-handed feminist''
but accepted the label, saying, ``I become increasingly weary of
male superiority unquestioned.''
   Earhart's disappearance over the Pacific while attempting a
round-the-world flight in 1937 turned a popular heroine into a cult
figure shrouded in mystery.
   The fate of the beautiful, dashing flier remains the stuff of
tabloid headlines. A favorite theory, one detailed in
correspondence included in the Earhart collection, is that she was
captured and executed by the Japanese. Most scholars accept the
more mundane hypothesis that she ran out of gas.
   ``At this point it really doesn't matter how she died except to
satisfy the morbidly curious,'' said Fay Gillis Wells, a veteran
pilot who flew together with Earhart. ``I hope she went quickly the
way she always wanted to go.''

   A Libyan-backed rebel group in Chad launched

the State Department said Wednesday.
   Several towns fell but were retaken, the department said.
   The department said the rebels launched the attack from Sudan on
Nov. 10 and the fighting has expanded to a wide area in eastern
Chad. It described the situation as fluid.
   ``We deplore these attacks on Chad,'' the department said.
``They represent the latest example of Libya's ongoing efforts to
destabilize legitimate governments. We fully support the Chadian
government's efforts to resist this subversion.''
   The rebels are from the Zaghawa ethnic group, whose homeland
straddles the Chad-Sudan border.

   The administration on Wednesday took on the
International Atomic Energy Agency, saying its inspectors had been
misled into concluding Iraq wasn't developing nuclear weapons.
   The comments are the latest in a concerted campaign by President
Bush and his top aides to warn that Iraq could have a nuclear
weapon within months.
   The administration has briefed some members of the 15-nation
U.N. Security Council about its contentions that Iraq has secret
nuclear plans, said one official who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The decision to share the top-secret information was apparently
part of an intense administration effort to win as many votes as
possible for a resolution allowing military force to dislodge Iraq
from Kuwait.
   Two inspectors of the Vienna-based IAEA, which monitors
compliance with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, visited
nuclear sites in Iraq last week and announced they had not found
any evidence of atomic weapons development.
   ``We think the International Atomic Energy Agency is wrong,''
said White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater. ``They see only what
Iraq wants them to see.''
   Fitzwater said President Bush had received briefings from
intelligence officials that led him to reveal several days ago that
Iraq had a nuclear capability ``that could come to fruition within
months.''
   The inspectors, who conduct six-month checks in Iraq, toured a
storage plant and a fuel-producing plant Nov. 19-22 at Baghdad's
invitation. They apparently checked on a 27-pound mass of highly
enriched uranium that Iraq salvaged from its Osirak nuclear reactor
which was destroyed by an Israeli air attack in 1981.
   Fitzwater said he did not know whether Congress, which is
holding hearings on U.S. involvement in the Gulf, had received
similar briefings.
   Another administration official, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said U.S. intelligence agencies were asked to prepare an
assessment of Iraq's nuclear program following its Aug. 2 invasion
of Kuwait.
   Analysts concluded that, in a ``worst case scenario,'' Iraq
could cobble together a crude device using the technology and
enriched uranium now in its possession, he said. But they also
questioned the value of such a device, which would be highly
inaccurate.
   Iraq could use the uranium just inspected by the IAEA, or it
might have a small amount of weapons-grade uranium smuggled in from
another source, experts said.
   To put together a basic weapon, Iraq would need at least 33
pounds of uranium - whereas the quantity under IAEA inspection is
only 27 pounds, said Peter Clausen, a nuclear non-proliferation
expert at the Union of Concerned Scientists.
   Government analysts have not changed their basic assessment that
it would take Iraq at least five years before it was ready with a
tested weapon that could accurately deliver nuclear material to a
specific target, said the administration official.
   ``It would be the late 1990s before they could have a militarily
significant weapon,'' he said.
   During testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee, two
former chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff raised serious doubts
about the Bush administration's statements on Iraq's potential
nuclear capability.
   ``Recent reports of near term are not right. They are
exaggerated,'' retired Adm. William Crowe said in reference to
comments made by Bush and other administration officials.
   David C. Jones said the issue of nuclear weapons and Iraq is a
``long-term issue.''
   Israeli officials have put the timetable at three to 10 years.
   An Israeli official agreed with the U.S. assessment that Iraq
could quickly put together a primitive weapon, but wondered whether
President Saddam Hussein would risk the inevitable retaliation by
the United States and its allies.
   ``He would only have a one-shot deal with this one primitive''
weapon, said the official who spoke only on condition of anonymity.
   Experts say Saddam could drop such a device from a plane, or put
it on a truck and ram the vehicle into an enemy target.
   All the analysts agreed Iraq does not have the ability to enrich
uranium, the process whereby uranium is turned into weapons-grade
material. Iraq has been trying to buy components and know-how to
assemble a chain of gas centrifuges for uranium enrichment, but is
still several years away from completing such a project, said the
official.

<TEXT>
   After-tax corporate profits jumped 6.7 percent
from July through September, the government reported Wednesday.
Some analysts said the rise was due primarily to inflation.
   ``Most of the gain was basically inflation profits,'' said
economist Bruce Steinberg of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets in New
York. ``If you take away those, profits actually were declining in
the third quarter.''
   Nevertheless, the Commerce Department said the gain was the
largest since an 8.9 percent advance in the first quarter of 1988.
It followed a 0.6 percent decline in the second quarter, which
erased a weak 0.5 percent increase in the first.
   Analysts attribute the sluggish after-tax profit picture to the
weak economy. The department reported on Wednesday that the gross
national product - the nation's total output of goods and services
- advanced at a lackluster 1.7 percent annual rate from July
through September.
   Many analysts believe the economy now is in a recession, where
profits typically decline 15 percent to 20 percent. Some believe,
however, that the downturn will be mild and short-lived, leading to
a smaller decline.
   After-tax profits totaled $177.2 billion at an annual rate in
the third quarter of 1990.
   Among the details of the report:
   -Before-tax profits, which totaled $315.4 billion at an annual
rate, rose 5.4 percent in the second quarter. Before-tax profits
were up 0.8 percent in the second quarter and 2.4 percent in the
first.
   -Corporate profits, after adjusting for depreciation and
inventories, fell 3.8 percent in the third quarter to an annual
level of $294.9 billion. They rose 3.3 percent in the second period
and 2.0 percent in the first.
   -Corporate cash flows, a measurement intended to show the funds
corporations have for investment, fell 3.2 percent from July
through September to an annual rate of $387.2 billion following a
gain of 1.7 percent in the second quarter and a loss of 0.7 percent
in the first.
   -Dividend payments to stockholders increased 1.6 percent to an
annual rate of $135.1 billion after gains of 2.1 percent in the
second quarter and 2.0 percent in the first.

<TEXT>
   The Philippine government is
negotiating with a representative of Ferdinand Marcos' family for
the return of $5 billion in assets of the late president, an
official said Wednesday.
   David Castro, chairman of the Presidential Commission on Good
Government, declined to say what conditions had been set for the
return of the assets.
   He said the assets were a ``combination of money and property''
in other countries, which he did not identify.
   The presidential commission is charged with recovering wealth
amassed by Marcos and his cronies during his 20-year rule. A
popular uprising drove Marcos into exile in Hawaii in 1986. He died
there in September 1989.
   On Wednesday, Solicitor General Francisco Chavez said he will
ask President Corazon Aquino to relieve him of responsibility for
handling lawsuits against the Marcos family and their associates
because he had not been consulted on a recent out-of-court
settlement.
   The solicitor general referred to a deal between the
presidential commission and Roberto Benedicto, a former Marcos
associate, in which the government recovered $78 million in assets.
   Legislators said the Nov. 3 pact with Benedicto was immoral and
illegal because it enabled him to retain allegedly embezzled funds.
Under the agreement, Benedicto retained $35.7 million in various
firms. The government also agreed to drop civil suits against him
and grant him immunity from future suits.
   Despite claims that Marcos and his allies stole up to $10
billion, the government has yet to win a single lawsuit against the
late president's family.

   The Indian government took control of
the northeastern state of Assam on Wednesday, postponing elections
and giving security forces sweeping new powers to crush an ethnic
separatist rebellion.
   In New Delhi, Hindu fundamentalists marched through the streets
carrying the ashes of people killed by police when fundamentalists
tried to storm a disputed mosque four weeks ago.
   In the northern state of Punjab, Sikh militants killed 25 people
in a series of attacks, police said Wednesday. Police fatally shot
three suspected militants.
   In Assam, the news agency Press Trust of India said army units
raided guerrilla hideouts and arrested at least 36 rebels in an
initial sweep.

everywhere,'' a federal government spokesman said in New Delhi,
speaking on condition of anonymity. ``The troops are going to
restore order and get the state out of the fear psychosis.''
   Sending in the army and bringing Assam under direct federal rule
was the first major political decision by the 18-day-old government
of Prime Minister Chandra Shekhar. The order must initially be
ratified by Parliament, but it can last up to six months without
new approval.
   Assam has been in the grip of a secessionist movement for two
years. Militants of the United Liberation Front of Assam say the
benefits of the area's natural resources should go only to native
Assamese. The militants have killed at least 100 people during the
uprising.
   Assam, India's main oil-producing state, is nearly separated
from the rest of India by Bangladesh.
   Elections for Assam's state legislature were to have taken place
by Jan. 8, when lawmakers' five-year terms expired. Assam Chief
Minister Prafulla Kumar Mahanta, the state's highest elected
official, condemned the federal rule decision as ``a betrayal of
the democratic process.''
   Assam is the third state to fall under federal rule.
Jammu-Kashmir was placed under federal rule in January to combat a
Moslem seccessionist movement. Punjab, where Sikh militants have
been fighting for independence, has been governed from New Delhi
for 42 months.
   In the latest Punjab violence, militants kidnapped a reporter
for the Punjabi-language Akali Patrika newspaper, and her husband,
a bureaucrat in the Punjab government, from their home in Amritsar
late Tuesday. Police found their bullet-ridden bodies on Wednesday.
The killers left a note accusing the couple of being police
informers.
   Sikh militants shot and killed 10 people in two other attacks in
Amritsar, city police said. Elsewhere in the state, militants
killed 13 people in five separate attacks since Tuesday evening.
Police said they shot and killed three suspected militants in
clashes.
   Sikh militants have killed 2,998 people so far this year in
Punjab, a rich farming state where they want to establish an
independent nation for members of their faith. Sikhs have a slight
majority over Hindus in Punjab.
   In the march by Hindu fundamentalists in New Delhi, hundreds of
young men shouted, ``Do not forget the martyrs of Ayodhya!''
   At least 22 people were killed by police gunfire in Ayodhya, 325
miles southeast of New Delhi, on Oct. 30 and Nov. 2 as Hindus
attempted to storm the site of a disputed mosque, which they want
to replace with a temple.
   The dispute caused riots between the Hindu majority and Moslem
minority across India. At least 362 people were killed.
   The controversy also helped topple the government of Prime
Minister V.P. Singh. He resigned Nov. 7 after a Hindu
fundamentalist party allied with his coalition withdrew support to
protest the government's efforts to block the campaign.
   Hindus make up 82 percent of India's 880 million people and
Moslems comprise 12 percent.

<HEAD>Indiana Woman Seeks to Sue Prosecutor</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Local prosecutors ought to be immune from
lawsuits over the advice they give to police just as they are
immune from lawsuits in most other parts of their jobs, the Justice
Department argued in the Supreme Court on Monday.
   The department's position was offered in the case of an Indiana
woman hypnotized by police because they suspected she shot her
children.
   The justices, who heard 60 minutes of arguments in the case, are
expected to decide by July whether Cathy Burns of Muncie may sue
the prosecutor who advised police to hypnotize her.
   Prosecutors nationwide enjoy absolute protection against being
sued for filing charges, seeking convictions in court and most
other official duties.
   At issue is whether they are entitled to such protection if they
advise police to violate people's rights. An appeals court in the
Indiana case ruled that the prosecutor could not be sued, but other
appeals courts have disagreed in other cases.
   Michael Sutherlin, Mrs. Burns' lawyer, said the advice-giving
function of prosecutors should not be covered by the absolute
shield.
   ``Only conduct that is the exclusive prerogative of the
prosecutor should be protected by absolute immunity,'' he said.
   But Justice Antonin Scalia said he found it difficult to draw
the line.
   A prosecutor is safe from suit if he ``filed an indictment that
was a pack of lies,'' Scalia said. What is the distinction between
that and telling police to violate someone's rights? he asked.
   The former example is closely connected to the judicial process,
Sutherlin replied. ``We must tolerate those cases of egregious
conduct,'' he said, but not for letting a prosecutor ``shoot from
the hip'' when telling police what to do.
   The Bush administration sided with the Indiana attorney
general's office in urging more protection for prosecutors.
   Justice Department lawyer Michael Lazerwitz argued that
prosecutors will be loathe to share their expertise with police if
they risk being sued. The advice-giving function, moreover, is
closely connected to the judicial process when carried out by a
prosecutor, he said.
   Justice Thurgood Marshall said the government's position could
lead to more abuses of people's rights.
   ``The rule we get is, `If you're the police and you want to
violate someone's rights, get a prosecutor's advice,''' he said.
   Police enjoy limited immunity from being sued. They cannot be
sued successfully if they acted in good faith and believed what
they were doing was lawful.
   Chief Counsel Robert Spear of the Indiana attorney general's
office said absolute immunity should extend even to lawyers hired
by police to give them advice about investigations.
   Mrs. Burns came under police suspicion after a shooting at her
home on Sept. 2, 1982. She said an intruder knocked her unconscious
and wounded her two sons, Eddie Griffin and Denny Sells, while they
slept.
   When police asked Chief Deputy Prosecutor Richard Red of
Delaware County, Ind., whether they should hypnotize her, he
recommended it.
   The police officers said they doubted the technique was lawful
because they had been told during their police academy training
that hypnotizing suspects was not acceptable.
   Under hypnosis, Mrs. Burns identified the assailant as ``Katie''
and also referred to herself at one point by the same name, the
police said.
   The officers concluded she had a split personality and regarded
her statement under hypnosis as a confession.
   They then obtained a search warrant from a judge without
revealing that the alleged confession was made under hypnosis. When
the police asked the judge for the warrant, Reed questioned them
without mentioning the hypnosis.
   The judge later ruled the statement given under hypnosis
inadmissible, and Reed dropped the charges against Mrs. Burns.
   She then sued Reed and the police, accusing them of violating
her rights. Her suit said she was fired from her job as a Muncie
police dispatcher, lost custody of her children and was ostracized
by her neighbors.
   She received $250,000 to settle her claims against the officers.
A federal judge dismissed the suit against Reed, who was elected
Delaware County prosecutor this month.
   The 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals agreed that Reed was
absolutely immune from suit when acting as a legal adviser to the
police. But federal appeals courts elsewhere have held that
prosecutors do not enjoy such immunity for giving advice to police.

<TEXT>
   Goh Chok Tong was sworn in as prime minister of
Singapore on Wednesday and promised to continue the course of his
predecessor, who helped change the nation from a slum-ridden port
to a clean economic dynamo.
   ``My mission is clear - to ensure that Singapore thrives and
grows after Lee Kuan Yew ... to build a nation of character and
grace where people can live lives of dignity and fulfillment, and
care for one another,'' Goh said.
   Goh took the oath of office in a low-key, 35-minute ceremony at
City Hall. It was held in the same chamber where Lee was sworn in
as prime minister 31 years ago.
   The authoritarian Lee, credited with shaping modern Singapore,
sat nearby in his new role as elder statesman. Lee submitted his
resignation Monday after years of preparing for a smooth transfer
of power.
   Since he expects to preside over continuity, not a break with
the past, Goh said earlier ``the changeover is seen as a
non-event.''
   The new leader spent 13 years as an understudy in Lee's Cabinet.
He took over most day-to-day decision-making after becoming deputy
prime minister more than five years ago.
   Goh, 49, was trained as an economist and headed the government
shipping line before entering politics.
   While no fresh initiatives are in the works, he says he will
scrap the paternalistic approach of Lee.
   Echoing President Bush, Goh said in a speech in Parliament in
June: ``The society which we want to bring about will be more
refined, more compassionate, kinder and gentler.''
   Nothing would be in greater contrast to his predecessor's
combative style.
   In Lee's later years, his opponents found themselves subject to
arrest, detention without charge or trial, public humiliation and
general harassment by an administration reluctant to acknowledge
dissent.
   ``We decide what is right. Never mind what the people want,''
Lee said several years ago.
   A fit 67, Lee is not passing completely from the scene, and his
influence is expected to remain as strong as he cares to make it.
He was sworn in with Goh's Cabinet as senior minister without
portfolio.
   Lee will continue in charge of the country's only significant
political organization, the People's Action Party, which controls
80 of the 81 elected seats in Parliament.
   Under Lee, this 239.5 square-mile island, with no natural
resources except a strategic location and the skills of its 2.7
million people, came to enjoy the second-highest standard of living
in Asia after Japan.
   Economic growth has averaged 9 percent a year over the past 25
years. About $23.4 billion in foreign reserves has been
accumulated. Per capita gross national product last year was
$10,500, more than in Ireland or Spain.

   Boxing great Mohammed Ali is expected to

his spokesman said in an interview Wednesday.
   Spokesman Jaber Mohammed said Ali and his entourage expected to

exact number.
   He said Iraqi officials assured them it would be at least 14,
and allowed them to pick their departure date.

groups and industry ``to utilize a wide variety of approaches to
meet housing needs,'' the White House said.
   Other provisions include:
   - Increasing public housing grants to $160 million for drug
elimination efforts and youth sports programs.
   - Reauthorizing the McKinney Act programs for the homeless.
   - Emphasizing government assistance for rehabilitation over new
construction, and requiring higher state and local contributions
where new construction of public housing is deemed necessary.
   - Federal Housing Administration assessment of new annual
premium on borrowers of FHA-backed loans that increases minimum
upfront closing costs.
   - Combining housing assistance with support services for the
elderly.
   ``The National Affordable Housing Act gives people the best kind
of government assistance - it provides opportunity and it
encourages responsibility without the shackles of dependency,''
Bush said Wednesday.''We want public housing to become a
springboard for independence, not a bottomless pit for
dependency.''
   The White House and Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack
Kemp have touted their new housing program as an example of how to
``empower'' the poor to help themselves.
   ``A cornerstone of our effort to reduce the heavy hand of
government is this idea of empowering people, not bureaucracies,''
Bush said in a signing ceremony in the East Room.
   ``Empowerment'' is a theme that has generated controversy within
the administration, with Richard Darman, director of the Office of
Management and Budget, recently dismissing it in a speech as a
meaningless catch phrase.
   But Bush has set up within his Domestic Policy Council a task
force on empowerment, chaired by Kemp.
   The general philosophy, say those involved, is to give people
tools to help themselves, rather than having government social
programs do it for them.
   White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater, asked Wednesday
what Bush thinks of the apparent rift between conservatives within
the administration who are pushing empowerment and those who pooh
pooh it as mere rhetoric, responded: ``We're all one big happy
family here, everybody is working together.''
   Earlier Wednesday, Kemp briefed members of the Domestic Policy
Council on possible initiatives under consideration for the State
of the Union address and fiscal 1992 budget. Kemp has been a
longtime backer of housing vouchers and other self-help programs
for the poor.
   Among the administration officials who attended the briefing
were Vice President Dan Quayle, Darman, and White House chief of
staff John Sununu.

<HEAD>U.S. Sends Ambassador To Lebanon</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The United States sent an ambassador back to
Lebanon, the State Department announced Wednesday, after pulling
out all U.S. officials from Beirut last year because of heavy
fighting among rival Lebanese militias.
   Ambassador Ryan Crocker arrived in Beirut Wednesday after a U.S.
security team inspected the situation in the Lebanese capital last
weekend, said deputy spokesman Richard Boucher. The State
Department wants to return additional diplomats to Beirut once
their security can be guaranteed, he said.
   The decision to send in Crocker despite the still-tenuous
security situation reflects the administration's strong support for
the new government of Elias Hrawi, which is trying to impose its
control over the divided country.
   The administration discussed its decision with Syria, which
backs Hrawi with 40,000 troops in Lebanon, said one official who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Crocker, who was named to his post by President Bush five months
ago, will present his credentials to Hrawi soon, Boucher said. A
date has not yet been set.
   Hrawi, implementing an Arab League-brokered peace plan to end
Lebanon's 15{-year civil war, has managed to convince the country's
eight major Moslem and Christian militias to evacuate Beirut and
its suburbs with their weapons this month.
   Compliance by the militias, who are believed responsible for
most of the estimated 150,000 war deaths, clears the way for
government troops to take over control of Beirut.
   Syria used its troops and air force last month to remove another
major obstacle to unifying Lebanon - a mutiny by Christian Gen.
Michel Aoun who barricaded himself with his loyalists at the
presidential palace.
   Pessimists argue the two previous bids to unite Beirut collapsed
in renewed warfare despite the presence of the Syrian army in 1976
and an international peacekeeping force in 1984.
   U.S. officials say Crocker, a career foreign service officer who
has served in Lebanon before, will stay as long as it's deemed
safe.
   ``The question on how long he stays is really a day-to-day
judgment,'' said Boucher. ``He's there today.''

<HEAD>Canine Inspector Helps Sniff Out Food Contraband</HEAD>

   It's elementary for Doc Watson to sniff out
forbidden fruit at the Honolulu post office. But then, Doc has the
nose for it, the Agriculture Department said Wednesday.
   Doc Watson is an elite member of the department's Beagle
Brigade, a band of dogs trained to sniff arriving overseas luggage
at U.S. airports to detect illegal fruit, meat and other items that
might contain harmful agricultural pests.
   A 1989 federal law prohibits the mailing of forbidden fruit, but
USDA officials in Honolulu had to seek criminal warrants to search
suspected parcels headed for the mainland.
   So Doc Watson last May was called in as part of a pilot program
to narrow the odds of finding contraband.
   The department's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service said
that as of Oct. 31, the beagle had sniffed out 477 illegal parcels
of produce.
   Overall, the take weighed 4,229 pounds and included 177
interceptions of fruit flies, foreign weeds, diseases and other
exotic pests.
   ``Some fruits sniffed out by Doc Watson are small - a few
miniature oranges mailed with other goods,'' the agency said.
``Some finds are huge, like a 30-pound jackfruit taat outweighed
Doc by about 10 pounds.''

   A man who claims to be a former Israeli
intelligence agent was acquitted Wednesday of chput aside consumer
worries about being stuck if the carrier folded. Shugrue said the
new money will ensure the carrier's operations through the end of
March, when he says Eastern will be ready to make a profit.
   ``The reaction has been incredible,'' said Eastern spokesman Jim
Ashlock. ``For the first time that a great many of us veteran
people have seen in a long time, people are rooting for us.''
   Shugrue plans a meeting with employees here Thursday night.
   ``It's a Christmas present for everybody who works at Eastern,''
Ashlock said of U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland's decision.
   Less than two weeks ago, Shugrue had asked the court to release
$30 million, saying he would need an additional $50 million in two
payments through early January. The carrier's unsecured creditors
urged the judge to liquidate the airline instead.
   The judge agreed to give Eastern $15 million and another $15
million in early December, provided Eastern was keeping on track
with its business projections.
   But Eastern said in asking for even more money Tuesday that it
had suffered up to $70 million in damage from publicity surrounding
the creditors' move to have it closed.
   Shugrue argued that forcing Eastern to return periodically to
withdraw from its escrow account made the airline look as if it
could fail at any moment. Lifland agreed and even scolded the
creditors for hurting Eastern's business.
   Unsecured creditors nevertheless renewed their argument that the
carrier cannot become viable and the fund should not be depleted
further.
   The unsecured creditors, who include aircraft companies, banks,
labor unions and others owed an estimated $1 billion by Eastern,
had not yet determined their next move by late Wednesday afternoon.
   ``There are a lot of broad options. I'm not in a position to
discuss them,'' lawyer Adam Harris said.
   Eastern would have only an estimated $37 million available in
its escrow account after the current draw, but Shugrue said it
won't be needed. His ``corporate rate'' strategy, in which Eastern
has nearly doubled its first-class cabin space and offered business
travelers discount fares, is helping Eastern build up its passenger
base, he said.
   Eastern's unions had said they saw the break-up and sale of
Eastern in parts as their only hope for winning back their jobs.
   But on Wednesday, Machinists union leader Charles E. Bryan urged
Shugrue to try again to settle the strike that began March 4, 1989.
A nearly paralyzed Eastern filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy five
days later and has been losing $1 million to $2 million a day
since.
   Shugrue, appointed trustee by the court last April, said then
that achieving labor peace was a priority.
   Ashlock said in discussions Shugrue has had with the unions, the
roadblock has been union insistence that replacement workers be
displaced, which Shugrue refuses to do.
   The Machinists plan a large demonstration Saturday at the Miami
International Airport.

Attorney's Office said Wednesday.
   The singer and Gabriella Kantor had been bickering for some time

   Ms. Kantor said Rose was too noisy; the rocker said she was a
groupie trying to get into his inner circle.
   The 28-year-old singer was jailed for four hours before posting
$5,000 bail. Rose denied touching the woman and his lawyers
described Ms. Kantor as ``a potentially dangerous rock 'n' roll
groupie.''
   Rose eventually got a restraining order preventing Ms. Kantor
from coming near him, his wife, Erin, or their guests.
   The heavy metal rocker has decided to move from his West

<HEAD>Higher Supplies, Lower Prices For Farm Produce Should Keep Food
Costs Down</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A drop in the value of some major commodities
at the farm level will be a key factor in holding down consumer
food prices next year, an Agriculture Department economist said
Wednesday.
   ``Larger supplies of (farm-produced) foods will have a strong
influence on food prices in 1991,'' Ralph L. Parlett Jr. told the
department's annual outlook conference.
   ``The farm value of food, that portion of the consumer dollar
which goes to farmers, is expected to average nearly 6 percent
below 1990,'' he said.
   Parlett's comments followed the USDA's forecast on Tuesday that
consumer food prices in 1991 will climb only 2 percent to 5
percent, compared with a 6 percent gain this year and 5.8 percent
in 1989.
   Retail food prices in the past two years have shown the sharpest
back-to-back increases since they jumped 8.6 percent in 1980 and
7.8 percent in 1981.
   After that burst, food prices rose mostly at an annual rate of 2
percent to 4 percent - until the last two years.
   Parlett said farm prices, costs of processing and distribution,
and consumer demand are the three major factors affecting food
prices.
   ``Farm prices were pushed up in 1990 because of tight supplies
of some farm commodities,'' he said. ``Costs beyond the farm gate
for processing and distributing food increased about 7 percent,
reflecting increased use of inputs and higher input prices.''
   Also, consumer demand for food remained relatively strong in the
first half of 1990, although Parlett said decreasing real
disposable income in the second half has probably dampened that
demand.
   Looking at the new forecast for 1991, Parlett said it involves a
number of uncertainties concerning the general economy and the
crisis in the Persian Gulf. But larger supplies of some
commodities, including dairy products and poultry, will help the
overall price average from soaring.
   ``In any case, a slowdown of the economy will have a dampening
effect on retail prices,'' he said. ``Declines in personal income
weaken consumer demand and reduce inflationary pressure on
prices.''
   Parlett said higher oil prices ``will have a limited effect on
the costs of processing and distributing foods'' next year.

<HEAD>Researcher Says Health Risks of Low-Level Radiation Overstated</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A report on the risk of developing cancer after
exposure to low-level radiation may have overstated the danger and
scared patients away from needed X-rays, researchers said
Wednesday.
   ``The problems we should be looking for when we take an X-ray
are substantially more important from a medical and patient
standpoint that a slight theoretical risk of cancer 20 years from
now,'' Dr. Fred A. Mettler told the Radiological Society of North
America conference.
   Mettler is professor and chairman of nuclear medicineand
general radiology at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque.
   Mettler and other conference participants linked the public's
fear of X-rays to a 1989 news release on the findings of a National
Research Council study.
   The release's first sentence said the possibility of developing
cancer from low-level X-rays and gamma rays might be three to four
times higher than previously estimated.
   Arthur C. Upton, chairman of the committee responsible for the
report, said the news release was misleading and might have
needlessly alarmed the public.
   ``I think knowing the reaction that has occurred, I would have
urged that that opening sentence be modified,'' said Upton,
chairman of the Department of Environmental Medicine at New York
University Medical Center. ``It does suggest a magnitude of change
that did not necessarily occur.''
   The ``three-to-four-times higher'' statement was based upon
comparison of the 1989 study and a 1980 National Research Council
study. But Upton noted that the studies were not conclusive and
said other studies have reported different estimates of the dangers
radiation poses.
   ``I could not find that statement anywhere in the study. My
problem is that the information is out there, and my patients are
reacting to it,'' said Joel Gray, professor of radiological physics
at the Mayo Clinic and Foundation.
   Gray said relatively few patients have refused X-rays because of
the report. But several of his patients delay X-rays each week
because of it.
   The 1989 study used new data developed from studies of survivors
of World War II bombings of Japan, from ``irradiated populations''
such as workers in atomic industries, and from animal studies.

   Bernard Ingham, the press secretary who used his
tongue as a sword against Margaret Thatcher's enemies, was the
first casualty of the prime minister's fall.
   Almost never quoted by name, the gruff civil servant was the
``Downing Street source'' who derided Cabinet ministers that lost
favor, fought a guerrilla war with liberal journalists, enraged
elected politicians and enjoyed Mrs. Thatcher's absolute
protection.
   When she lost her job, so did he.
   Ingham, 58, and a few other officials who surrounded Mrs.
Thatcher were accused by her enemies by keeping her increasingly
isolated and unwittingly helping to bring her down.
   Whenever political skulduggery was afoot, the victims invrriably
detected Ingham's hand - though friends claimed he was often
innocent.
   For Britain's political reporters, the red-haired Yorkshireman
with beetling eye brows and a glowering mien was a prime source of
information.
   ``My job was to represent her views,'' he said this week. ``I
hope I have done that with reasonable accuracy.''
   That was an understatement.
   In 11 years with Mrs. Thatcher, Ingham became perhaps the most
influential press secretary ever to operate at 10 Downing Street.
   He was by her side to the end, a protective arm raised as she
met journalists in Paris the night her Conservative Party denied
her re-election.
   Two days later, choosing resignation rather than defeat, Mrs.
Thatcher spat defiance at old foes in a bravura encore in the House
of Commons, while Ingham sat forlornly in the gallery, head in
hands.
   Soon after being elected Tuesday night as the next prime
minister, John Major appointed Gus O'Donnell, 36, as his press
spokesman.
   Ingham, in effect, was fired. But he hadn't expected anything
else.
   For every journalist who valued Ingham as a source, another
seemingly reviled him as a manipulator.
   Robert Harris, political columnist of the liberal London weekly
The Observer, said Ingham was key ``to the way in which Mrs.
Thatcher was able to centralize power in Downing Street,
undercutting the authority of ministers. ...''
   ``He helped establish her, and in the end it was that that
brought her down: her style of government.''
   Ingham's words were often Mrs. Thatcher's words, his thoughts
her thoughts, served up to British journalists at twice-daily
briefings.
   Ingham briefed foreign correspondents in two separate weekly
sessions.
   He signaled the imminent departure of Foreign Secretary Francis
Pym in 1983 by labeling him ``Mona Lott,'' suggesting he moans
alot. John Biffen was dropped from the Cabinet after Ingham labeled
him ``semi-detached.''
   In 1986, Ingham and Mrs. Thatcher nearly sank together after the
leak of a government document damaging to Michael Heseltine, soon
to resign as defense secretary in a bitter row with the leader.
   Mrs. Thatcher denied she was responsible and refused demands in
the House of Commons for Ingham to be questioned.
   Through it all, her loyalty to Ingham never faltered. ``Bernard
is wonderful,'' she often commented at news media events.
   At international summits, Ingham became something of a star
attraction at the open-house, not-for-attribution British
briefings, even if the commentary defied translation.
   ``Bunkum and balderdash,'' were favorite words for dismissing
grand plans for greater European union.
   When the end came, the ``Downing Street source'' took it
manfully.
   ``It's a rough old world - and I don't think she'd want it any
other way,'' Ingham said.
   And of himself? He laughed, ``Who'd want an old has-been like
me?''

   Former world heavyweight boxing champion
Muhammad Ali is expected to leave the Iraqi capital this week with
at least 14 American hostages, his spokesman said Wednesday.
   Ali met with President Saddam Hussein of Iraq on Tuesday for 50
minutes. The 48-year-old boxing great went to Baghdad at the
invitation of the Iraqi government.
   Ali's spokesman, Jaber Mohammed, said the former champion and
his entourage expect to leave Baghdad on Saturday but hope to
receive a list of the hostages Thursday that will provide them with
the exact number to be freed.
   Baghdad's government has prevented hundreds of foreigners from
leaving since its Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait. But in recent weeks,
it has allowed some to leave with visiting politicians, prominent
figures and peace groups.
   There are almost 1,000 Americans remaining in Iraq and Kuwait,
more than 100 held as ``human shields'' at strategic military and
industrial sites in Iraq.
   Three former U.S. hostages left Iraq on Tuesday after their
relatives had traveled to Baghdad to plead their case.
   Ali's spokesman said Iraqi officials promised that a minimum of
14 American hostages would be permitted to go and allowed Ali and
his staff to pick the departure date.
   ``We picked Saturday because juma (Friday) is the holy day, and
we did not want to interrupt our prayers,'' the spokesman said. Ali
converted to Islam in 1964 and changed his name from Cassius Clay.
   Ali suffers from Parkinson's Disease, marked by slurred speech
and shaking limbs. He generally uses hand signals to communicate
his statements to his spokesman, who speaks to the press.
   The spokesman, interviewed Wednesday by telephone from Nicosia,
said the group planned to go to the United States via Amman, the
Jordanian capital.
   ``We feel very pleased with the trip. We feel we got to
understand the situation of the people here, their aspirations, and
thank God we can take at least 14 back with us,'' Jaber said.
   Jaber said Ali expects the United Nations to pass a resolution
authorizing the multinational force in the region to use force
against Iraq after Jan. 15. The vote in the Security Council is due
later this week.
   ``But our prayers are (that) even if the resolution passes, they
will not use force,'' he said.

<HEAD>Britain Renews Diplomatic Ties with Syria</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain announced Wednesday that it had restored
diplomatic relations with Syria after receiving assurances that
Damascus opposes international terrorism and will act against
convicted terrorists.
   The British cut ties with Syria four years ago, accusing it of
sponsoring terrorism.
   Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd also told the House of Commons on
Wednesday that Britain had received assurances from the Damascus
government ``that Syria will continue its strenuous efforts to
obtain the release of Western, including British, hostages in
Lebanon.''
   Pro-Iranian extremists hold 13 Western hostages in Lebanon - six
Americans, four Britons, two Germans and an Italian. Terry
Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press,
was kidnapped March 16, 1985, and is the longest-held of the
hostages.
   Syria has 40,000 troops based in Lebanon under an Arab League
mandate and is the main powerbroker there.It helped obtain the
release of Americans Robert Polhill and Frank Reed in April and
Irishman Brian Keenan in August.
   The Syrian government newspaper Tishrin said this month that
Britain should resume relations with Syria if it wanted the
remaining captives freed.
   Britain severed relations with Syria in October 1986 after a
London jury convicted Jordanian Nezar Hindawi of trying to bomb an
El Al jet leaving London's Heathrow Airport with 375 people aboard
on April 17, 1986.
   Hindawi, who planted explosives in the hand luggage of his
pregnant Irish fiancee, was sentenced to 45 years in prison.
   Syria denied involvement, but Britain said Hindawi acted on
orders from Syrian intelligence, traveled on a Syrian passport and
met Syrian Ambassador Loutfallah Haydar at the Syrian Embassy after
the bomb plot was found out.
   U.S.-Syrian ties improved this summer when Damascus sided with
the alliance against Saddam Hussein following Iraq's Aug. 2
invasion of Kuwait.

<HEAD>Distributors To Recall Machines From Pittsburgh</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Cigarette distributors say they will recall
their vending machines instead of modifying them to accept tokens
in compliance with a new law designed to curb the sale of
cigarettes to minors.
   The law, scheduled to go into effect in January, requires that
all machines in areas frequented by minors be modified to accept
tokens rather than coins.
   Les Frank, president of Royal Cigarette Service Inc. of
Homestead, said his 250 machines affected by the law would either
be returned or recalled.
   He said it would cost $400 to modify each machine and the law
would mean more bookkeeping work, counterfeit coins and fraud -
making them unprofitable.
   ``It isn't cost effective, it's not pragmatic and it isn't
workable,'' he said.
   Vending distributors said many of their customers already have
returned the machines and adopted over-the-counter cigarette sales
instead.
   City Councilwoman Michelle Madoff initially introduced
legislation that would have banned cigarette machines from all
places frequented by minors. The council later adopted the
compromise token bill.
   ``I say hallelujah they're taking the machines out,'' Mrs.
Madoff said. ``For every child who may not get hooked on
cigarettes, I'm thrilled.''

<HEAD>Lawsuit: Silverado Loan Defaulter Hid Millions in Assets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A former developer who said he was
penniless after defaulting on $106 million in debts from Silverado
Savings &amp; Loan has hidden more than $6 million in property under
his wife's name, a lawsuit contends.
   Bill Walters' failure to repay the loans helped bring on the
1988 collapse of Denver-based Silverado, regulators say. The
institution's failure is expected to cost taxpayers up to $1
billion.
   The lawsuit, filed Tuesday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Santa Ana
by a court-appointed trustee, contends that much of the property
transfer occurred just days after Walters married in 1986.
   Walters told a congressional committee earlier this year that he
was broke.
   Walters' business ties to Neil Bush, a Silverado director and
son of President Bush, led to conflict of interest allegations
against the younger Bush.
   ``It's the belief of the trustee that there have been
significant assets of this debtor that have been secreted away,''
said Ronald Rus, an attorney for a firm hired by trustee R. Neil
Rodgers to help liquidate Walters' assets.
   The complaint asks U.S. Bankruptcy Judge John Wilson to order
the seizure and sale of the property.
   The lawsuit contends Walters transferred more than $2 million to
a trust set up to purchase a Newport Beach home for his wife,
Jacqueline. The couple live in the home today.
   The complaint also says Jacqueline Walters sold for $4.7 million
three parcels of land in Colorado that her husband deeded to her
immediately after their marriage.
   There is no telephone listing for Walters in Newport Beach.
   The court appointed Rodgers to oversee the liquidation of
Walters' assets after Walters filed for bankruptcy earlier this
month.
   Court documents filed by Walters indicate the former contractor
owes more than $250 million to dozens of creditors.
   Mrs. Walters also received from her husband two Riverside County
condominiums and several luxury automobiles, including a 1982
Ferrari, a 1986 Bentley, a Rolls-Royce and two Mercedes-Benzes, the
lawsuit contends.
   The lawsuit accuses Walters and his wife of trying to ``hinder,
delay and defraud'' his creditors.

<HEAD>U.S. Marines, Desert Rats Practice for War</HEAD>

<DATELINE>IN EASTERN SAUDI ARABIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of miles from the
diplomatic debate to fix a final deadline for Iraq to leave Kuwait,
U.S. Marines and British Desert Rats jointly practice for war in
the desert.
   They have trained in each other's equipment, tested their radios
and practiced for the first time Wednesday scouting together at
night for enemy patrols. If the attack order is given, they may
also fight together.
   ``Options are becoming fewer. War does seem a little more
certain,'' said Maj. Hamish MacDonald, company commander of the
Queen's Dragoon Guards Reconnaissance Squadron of the British 7th
Armored Brigade. The brigade is also known as the Desert Rats.
   ``We are ready to go now if necessary. I think the quicker the
better,'' MacDonald said. ``It'll have to be finished one way or
another.''
   The troops training in the desert are about 7,000 miles away
from the U.N. debate on setting a Jan. 15 deadline for Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein to back down and have his 450,000 forces
leave Kuwait. Talk of a firm date boosted the spirits of the U.S.
Marines who arrived here three months ago.
   ``It's a target to get everybody psychologically prepared for
battle. Somebody's finally saying they're going to do something,''
said Lt. Col. Michael Brooks, 45, company commander of the Marines'
1st Force Reconnaissance Co.
   ``There's some ambivalence. There's a dark side to this. We know
what the costs are going to be,'' he added.
   But Marines welcomed news that something definite may be coming.
   ``We've been out here hanging on a string. It boosts morale,''
said Lance Cpl. Mike Shoemaker, 21, who lives in California but
declined to give his home town.
   ``If we're going to do it, let's get it done or find a peaceful
solution and go home,'' Shoemaker said. ``They set that date, and a
lot of Marines went `Yeah!'''
   The Americans and British, longtime allies, have cemented a
close working relationship in the Saudi desert. U.S. Marines can
provide air support, naval power and mechanized infantry for the
British. The Desert Rats, in turn, offer tanks, armored
reconnaissance and engineers to clear minefields.
   ``We think very much along the same lines. We like each other.
We're friends. We have the same values,'' said MacDonald, 37.
   But more than military technology and technique is being
exchanged. The British have introduced rugby to the Americans, who
in turn offer softball and football.
   There's also an informal trade going on of poncho liners, desert
scarves and American sleeping cots for hot British chow.
   ``It's a godsend, really, to get to work with our allies,'' said
Trooper Myles Lewis, 18, of Birmingham, England.
   ``You pull as one here,'' said Cpl. Stephen Bank of California.

   Garry Kasparov and Anatoly Karpov drew for
the eighth straight game Wednesday in the World Chess Championship.
   The two Soviet rivals are now tied at 7{ points after 15 games.
They have had three draws in the French portion of the
championship. They had 10 draws in the 12 games played Oct. 8-Nov.
7 in New York.
   The first player to gain 12{ points wins the crown and $1.7
million of a $3 million purse. If the players tie at 12, Kasparov
retains the title he won in 1985.
   Wednesday's 15th game began very similarly to the 13th game on
Saturday, with Karpov and Kasparov playing a Grunfeld Opening with
an exchange variation. Kasparov castled on the eighth move.
   The position was the same after 10 moves as the two games
previous, but Karpov varied his game when he went to a bishop move
(Bh6).
   Boris Spassky, the former world champion living in France,
recommended this move in his commentary for the 13th game. It is a
new move, not found in any previous game using the Grunfeld
opening.
   An exchange of queens occurred in the 14th and 15th moves.
   At the 33rd move, Kasparov proposed the draw, which Karpov
accepted.
   The next game is Saturday.

   Parts of City Hall were evacuated for two
hours Wednesday while police removed a pipe bomb discovered in an
empty courtroom by a maintenance worker.
   Police Capt. William Markert said the six-inch bomb would be
taken to the Police Academy firing range for disposal.
   The device was found about 2:30 p.m., said Sgt. Theresa Young, a
police spokeswoman. Police ordered offices on the second, third and
fourth floors of the building evacuated, she said.
   Markert said a maintenance worker found the pipe in an unused
surplus courtroom. He said the bomb could have been in the room for
years.
   The building quickly returned to normal.
   Police said they had no estimate of how many people were
evacuated.

   Here are excerpts from testimony Wednesday
before the Senate Armed Services Committee about the Persian Gulf
crisis. Testifying were two former chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, David C. Jones and William Crowe, and former Secretary of
State Henry Kissinger.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Jones: I want to begin by stating my unqualified endorsement for
the president's swift and adroit response to the invasion of Kuwait
in August. I am absolutely convinced that his decisive action
prevented a wider aggression, which would have been enormously more
difficult to reverse, much less contain. ...
   We must do whatever is necessary to expel Iraqi forces from
Kuwait, but we should do everything in our power to ensure common
ends and means, especially among the leading Arab as well as
non-Arab nations. ...
   My reading of the public mood is that they back the president,
but they want to know what they are in for. This means that the
administration must be prepared to set out a convincing case for
the range of actions to which we could be committed. ...
   In return, I think the nation and specifically the Congress
should devise some vehicle to express to the world at large ...
that the United States is patient but its patience is not
inexhaustible, that we are determined that aggression against
neighbors shall not be condoned ...
   This could not be considered a blank check and certainly not ...
a declaration of war, but it would strengthen the president's hands
considerably in the critical weeks and months ahead. ...
   I must confess to a nagging concern about the means and ends. By
calling for an offensive military option and increasing the
projected Desert Shield force levels, the president has clearly
decided to send a strong message to Saddam Hussein about the
seriousness of the U.S. resolve. This high-risk tactic might
succeed in forcing an acceptable political resolution to the
crisis, or if combat is unavoidable, will give us the forces needed
to prevail alongside our coalition partners. If so, I will applaud
the president's nerve and foresight.
   My main concern with this latest scheduled reinforcement isn't
that we might choose to fight but rather that the deployment might
cause us to fight, perhaps prematurely and perhaps unnecessarily. I
would stress that this is a risk, not a certainty, but one that
ought to be taken seriously. ...
   The risk is that the problems inherent in maintaining the
offensive military option could create irresistible pressures to
initiate combat irrespective of the progress of the U.N. sanctions.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   Crowe: President Bush ... acted quickly, and in my opinion
correctly, to constrain Hussein militarily, to defend Saudi Arabia,
and to clamp a tight economic quarantine on Iraq. ...
   Granted the embargo is not working as rapidly as many would
prefer, but if we wanted economic results in two or three months,
then a quarantine was the wrong way to go about it. ... The issue
is not whether an embargo will work, but whether we have the
patience to let it take effect. ...
   The president's initial moves have already achieved a great
deal. The argument that Saddam is winning and being rewarded, I
believe is both weird and wrong. ... I believe the burning question
now confronting the president, as well as our public, is, What
next? ... In its most extreme form, we are talking about
deliberately initiating offensive military operations. In other
words, war. ...
   I would submit that posturing ourselves to promote stability for
the long-term is our primary national interest in the Middle East.
...
   It is not obvious to me that we are currently looking at the
crisis in this light. Our dislike for Hussein sems to have crowded
out many other considerations. ...
   I firmly believe that Saddam Hussein must be pushed out of
Kuwait; he must leave Kuwait. At the same time, given the larger
context, I judge it highly desirable to achieve this goal in a
peaceful fashion, if that is possible. In other words, I would
argue that we should give sanctions a fair chance before we discard
them. ...
   I believe the bulk of the American people are willing to put up
with a great deal to avoid war and to avoid casualties a long ways
from home. In fact, in my judgment, we are selling our country
short by jumping to the conclusion that we can't stare down our
opponent. ...
   It would be a sad commentary if Saddam Hussein, a two-bit tyrant
who sits on 17 million people and possesses a gross national
product of $40 billion, proved to be more patient than the United
States, the world's most affluent and powerful nation. ...
   I counsel patience ... war is not neat, it's not tidy, and once
you resort to it, it's uncertain and it's a mess. And you should
... be sure the stakes justify what you're doing before you just
voluntarily jump into a mess.

   Kissinger: I have the most serious doubt whether it will be
possible to maintain the present military deployment in Saudi
Arabia for an extended period of time, and I would be interested to
see an intelligence estimate, to which I have no access, of whether
we believe that the present level of deployment can be maintained
during the pilgrimage and much beyond Ramadan.
   I believe that as this large American deployment in the area is
maintained, the pressures against it will multiply. ...
   The presence of a large force puts a pressure on Saddam Hussein
but it also makes it more difficult to sustain it for an indefinite
period of time. And this is why we will come to a point of
decision, in my view, sometime in the next few months where we will
have to choose between the military option and the sanctions
option.
   I would prefer for the sanctions to work. I do not believe that
it is likely that the two can be kept in harness. ...
   From the beginning, it has been my position that if military
action becomes unavoidable ... the preferable strategy would be to
rely on our air and naval power and to use our ground forces to
prevent a response rather than to launch a large-scale attack. ...
   I am also profoundly concerned about the impact on the countries
with which we are associated in the area of something that begins
to look like a substantial American withdrawal which might then
start a rush towards accommodation and undermine all moderate
governments in the area. ...
   I am very nervous about having a very large American ground
establishment in a region in which Iraqi forces are in front of it,
Iranian forces are at the flank of it, and political instabilities
all around them. Because we could easily become the subject of
totally unpredictable events and be drawn into things that were not
part of our original mission.

<TEXT>
   A prosecutor asked jurors Wednesday
for a first-degree murder conviction in a case featuring testimony
of a woman who claims she long repressed the memory of seeing her
father kill her childhood friend.
   Eileen Franklin-Lipsker testified during the trial that she had
a flashback late last year of watching her father, George Franklin
Sr., molest her best friend, 8-year-old Susan Nason, then smash her
skull with a rock 20 years before.
   ``We're here because George Franklin Sr. chose to murder a
little girl rather than be identified as a child molester,''
prosecutor Elaine Tipton said during closing arguments.
   ``She died because she trusted the defendant,'' Ms. Tipton said.
``That was the price she paid for trusting her best friend's
father.''
   Franklin has pleaded innocent to the charges. If convicted, he
faces life in prison.
   The defense was to present its closing argument later Wednesday.
   Tuesday, Superior Judge Thomas McGinn Smith told jurors they
could consider only a possible verdict of first-degree murder.
   Also Tuesday, the prosecution played a tape of a Nov. 21, 1989,
telephone conversation between Ms. Franklin-Lipsker and a District
Attorney's Office investigator.
   In the call, Ms. Franklin-Lipsker describes the crime, but does
not identify the killer or herself. She tells the investigator she
had buried the memory of the killing for two decades.
   Nason vanished from her Foster City neighborhood Sept. 22, 1969.
Her body was found 10 weeks later in a ravine east of Half Moon
Bay.
   Franklin-Lipsker, 29, maintains the long-repressed memory came
back to her as she gazed at her own young daughter. She testified
during the trial that she now remembers her father threatening to
kill her if she told anyone what she had seen.
   The defense has hinted that Franklin-Lipsker and another sister
may have concocted the repressed-memory account as revenge for
years of sexual and physical abuse that their father allegedly
inflicted upon his family.

   The government so far this year has collected
$474 million in overdue child support payments from 810,000 federal
tax returns, the Department of Health and Human Services said
Wednesday.
   Under a federal program, names of parents who are delinquent in
child support payments are submitted to the Internal Revenue
Service.
   The Family Support Administration's Office of Child Support
Enforcement compiles the names from state and local child support
enforcement agencies. The IRS may then withhold tax refunds.
   The funds usually are sent directly to families owed the
support. In cases involving Aid to Families With Dependent
Children, the money is sent to states to reimburse the cost of the

   Asked by reporters if he would quit, Lukanov replied, ``Not
now.'' He said he did not know exactly when he would resign.
   BTA had said President Zhelyu Zhelev would appoint a caretaker
Cabinet headed by a premier who will be neither of the Socialist
Party - the renamed Communist Party - nor of the Union of
Democratic Forces main opposition.
   Pressure on the 52-year-old Socialist premier increased hourly.
He has been increasingly blamed for the political paralysis and
economic chaos in this Balkan country of 9 million people.
   Krastyo Petkov, chairman of the main Confederation of
Independent Trade Unions, said his organization would join a
3-day-old strike by the smaller, more radical Podkrepa union on
Thursday unless the political stalemate was settled. His union had
opposed the strike.
   Ognyan Kromov, the Confederation's vice president, said it would
start shutting down heavy industry Thursday.
   Kromov said the union ``insists on forming a working Cabinet
that would be a competent and stable partner in negotiations.''
   Podkrepa said 870,000 workers were on strike Thursday in 91
cities throughout Bulgaria, including 230,000 in Sofia. The
government put the total at 40,000.
   Bulgaria is suffering through its worst crisis since World War
II. Electricity is rationed. Foodstuffs and many other basics are
rationed or unavailable. The country cannot make payments on its
$11 billion foreign debt.
   The political stalemate has blocked officials from acting to
improve the economic situation.
   Reflecting the turmoil, Parliament could not meet Wednesday
because it lacked a quorum. The opposition walked out last Friday
and is boycotting sessions.
   Talks aimed at political compromise, held among all political
parties and trade unions at Zhelev's suggestion, were suspended
without result.
   The talks are expected to produce an agreeement on a future
coalition government and on setting a timetable for drafting key
economic legislation and a new constitution.
   On Wednesday evening, hundreds of protesters blocked Eagles'
Bridge, Sofia's main intersection and the scene of a morning
confrontation between riot police and demonstrators.
   Traffic in downtown Sofia came to a near-standstill. Police, who
used clubs to disperse protesters earlier, did not intervene.
   Podkrepa said the government had begun using military vehicles
to ensure transport, so the union was extending the strike to Sofia
airport, the petrochemical complex in Burgas, and to dock workers
in that Black Sea port.
   The national airline Balkan suspended flights. BTA said later
only international flights would operate.
   Lukanov said composition of a new government had not yet been
discussed. ``I hope this will happen soon because the current
situation must not continue,'' he added.
   BTA quoted opposition leader Petar Beron as telling a rally
Lukanov's final condition for quitting was to be allowed to do it
with dignity.
   Lukanov has said he will not let the opposition hound him out of
office.
   The Communists ruled Bulgaria for more than four decades. They
renamed themselves Socialists last spring and won June elections.
   Lukanov is among reform-minded party members who helped oust
longtime Communist leader Todor Zhivkov in November 1989. Appointed
premier on Feb. 3, he has governed Bulgaria during a period of
increasingly polarized politics, deteriorating living standards and
growing public anger.
   He used his majority to pass an austerity budget last week.
   The opposition wants smaller price increases. It refuses to
cooperate with Lukanov and demands he resign. It wants to name the
premier and key ministers in a new government.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 76-year-old state appeals judge won the right
to stay on the bench Wednesday, when a judge ruled an Illinois law
requiring his retirement was unconstitutional.
   The law bars state appeals judges from seeking another 10-year
term after they turn 75.
   ``I think any mandatory retirement age is unfair,'' Appellate
Judge William White said after the ruling. ``Judges ought to be
individually evaluated.''
   A majority of voters cast ballots Nov. 6 in favor of White, who
ran to retain his seat. Two other judges also ran for the seat.
   John Tully, a Circuit Court judge who came in second, challenged
White's election victory in court, saying White was too old to
retain the job.
   Tully said he would appeal the ruling.
   ``I'm not surprised by anything in our court system,'' Tully
said. ``But I think justice will be served in the end.''
   Circuit Judge Joseph Schneider ruled White was denied equal
protection under the law. He also said the mandatory retirement law
was flawed.
   Under the law, a judge can run for re-election at age 74 and
remain on the bench until he was 84, Schneider said. But a
75-year-old judge could not run for re-election.
   The U.S. Supreme Court this week agreed to consider a similar
case in Missouri in which two judges challenged a state law forcing
mandatory retirement at 70.
   The Missouri judges maintain state law violates federal law and
unconstitutionally treats them differently than other state
employees.

<TEXT>
   Rising hospital costs and physicians' salaries
will contribute to an estimated 12.9 percent increase in premiums
next year for patients of health maintenance organizations, an
industry group said Wednesday.
   The Group Health Association of America Inc. based its
projection on a survey of 44 HMOs enrolling more than 11 million
people.
   Increases averaged 16.9 ercent in 1989 and 16 percent this
year, said the group, the national professional organization for
HMOs, which are pre-paid health plans.
   Pharmaceutical expenses and growth in the use of technology are
additional factors in the premium increases, HMOs reported in the
survey.
   Increases in premiums for HMOs have been somewhat below the
increases for other types of health insurance, said Marsha Gold,
director of research and analysis for the Group Health Association
of America.
   But HMO premiums are rising more rapidly than health care costs
generally, said Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA, a
consumer group.
   Health care costs in the United States have been rising at an
annual rate of 10.4 percent in the last decade, Families USA said
recently.

   A high school closed and slated for
replacement as part of a city desegregation effort was demolished
Wednesday, despite a last-minute legal effort to save the
64-year-old building.
   A plume of dust rose into the sky when explosives went off. The
dust settled within minutes, revealing a large pile of debris where
Paseo High School once stood.
   Three corners of the school left standing were to be knocked
down with a wrecking ball.
   Former students and neighborhood residents had fought to have
the limestone building renovated instead of razed, but school
district officials said replacing the building would cost $3
million less than renovating it.
   A high school and middle school focused on the arts are
scheduled to open at the site in September 1992.
   ``I hate this,'' said former student Mary Webb, who was among a
crowd of people who gathered to watch the demolition. ``It was a
beautiful building. They shouldn't have done this.''
   The group opposing the demolition fought this year to save the
school, but lost their case in U.S. District Court. They filed
another motion Tuesday contending the district had lied about
construction costs, but Judge Russell G. Clark did not consider it
before the building fell.
   ``I didn't expect him to,'' said Mack Harnden, a leader of the
opposition group. ``I felt that once Judge Clark had made a
decision, he wouldn't change his mind. I had kind of begun my
grieving process.''
   During the summer, Clark found the school district and the state
of Missouri guilty of causing illegal racial segregation of
students, spurring the desegregation plan.

   The measure, sponsored by Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., and

   An earlier law allowed Class III devices to stay on the market

   Former Navy Secretary John F. Lehman and
two other Navy officials were cleared of liability in a lawsuit
filed by an arms company employee who said he was fired for
criticizing military spnding.
   The 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Tuesday rejected
Lawrence J. Korb's claim that Pentagon officials violated his free
speech rights by telling his superiors at Raytheon Corp. that they
were displeased with his criticism of the military.
   Korb, who was an assistant secretary of defense during President
Reagan's administration, filed the lawsuit after he was forced out
of his job as a vice president for Raytheon.
   The dismissal came after Korb held a news conference in 1986 in
which he suggested that defense spending be cut by $200 billion
over five years, in part by scaling back plans for a 600-ship Navy.
He was speaking as a member of the Committee for National Security,
a group of private citizens concerned with defense issues.
   Although Lehman and two assistant Navy secretaries, Melvyn R.
Paisley and Everett Pyatt, told Raytheon officials they were
displeased with Korb's remarks, they did not suggest that Korb be
fired, court records show.
   Raytheon said Korb was dismissed because of a variety of
complaints about his job performance.
   The appeals panel agreed with U.S. District Judge Claude M.
Hilton that Navy officials were entitled to qualified immunity
because their actions did not violate Korb's constitutional rights.

<TEXT>
   The Cabinet approved the largest budget in
Israel's history Wednesday, and news reports said it allocates more
money for immigrants than defense.
   It apparently was the first time in Israel's history that
defense was not the largest category in the budget.
   The $37.8 billion 1991 budget will increase taxes and include a
$3 billion deficit to cover immigration and defense costs, the
Finance Ministry said.
   The budget must be approved by parliament, where the government
has a majority.
   Israeli news reports said the budget allocates $6.2 billion for
defense and $6.5 billion to cover the cost of absorbing the influx
of Soviet Jewish immigrants, including construction of new housing.
   About 130,000 Soviet Jews have arrived in the country so far
this year, and an additional 350,000 to 400,000 are expected to
immigrate in 1991.
   The Finance Ministry would not give details of the budget's
individual categories.
   Finance Minister Yitzhak Modai and Defense Minister Moshe Arens
agreed Tuesday to increase the defense budget by $215 million
because of the Palestinian uprising and the Persian Gulf crisis.
   The Cabinet voted to accept a new proposal by Modai, setting a
value-added tax at 18 percent, up from the current 16 percent. In
addition, it approved a proposal to impose a 5 percent tax on the
income tax paid by each Israeli for the next three years.

   A CIA study predicts Yugoslavia will break
apart soon and probably decline into civil war, official sources
said Wednesday.
   One source, speaking on condition he not be identified, said
members of the intelligence community ``have been making dire
predictions like that for some time'' but that they are not shared
by other foreign-policy specialists in the government.
   An official who has read the most recent Central Intelligence
Agency assessment, circulated several weeks ago in what is called a
National Intelligence Estimate, said it predicts the various ethnic
groups that make up Yugoslavia will begin fighting each other in a
scenario likely to lead to civil war.
   But that same official and another who is familiar with
administration views on the issue said the U.S. Embassy in
Belgrade, State Department specialists in Washington and Bush
administration policymakers don't agree the situation is as serious
as the CIA report indicates.
   These officials and others discussed the content of the CIA
report on condition that they not be identified.
   Existence of the report was disclosed Wednesday by the New York
Times, which quoted unidentified sources who had read it.
   Yugoslavia was created as an independent monarchy after World
War I with the addition of various territories to the old kingdom
of Serbia. It became a Communist-ruled federation after World War
II, consisting of six republics with a long history of ethnic and
economic rivalry.
   The country has more divisions among its people than most. Two
alphabets are in use, the Roman and the Cyrillic. The Roman
Catholic, the Eastern Orthodox and the Moslem faiths all have large
followings.
   The state was held together for 35 years under the strong hand
guerrila leader Josip Broz, better known under the name Tito, whose
partisans emerged victorious at the end of World War II.
   After Tito's death in 1980, a revolving presidency guaranteeing
each republic a term of leadership was established in an attempt to
preserve the tenuous union.
   But attempts by Serbia, the largest republic, to control the
substantial Albanian minority in Kosovo province has led to
repeated outbreaks of violence. And Serbia more recently has become
embroiled in an economic rivalry with the more prosperous northern
republic of Slovenia, spurring nationalist forces in both
republics.
   Runaway inflation, high unemployment and collapsing productivity
have exacerbated the various regional and ethnic conflicts.
   Prime Minister Ante Markovic is attempting to install economic
reforms designed to halt the downward spiral, stabilize the
currency and pursue democratic elections, which in some cases have
led to election of divisive nationalists.
   ``Markovic wants to be a unity figure and has established a
non-Communist, democratic and pro-unity government that has had
mixed results,'' one U.S. official said. ``The economic reforms,
under IMF (International Monetary Fund) supervision, had some
success initially but have become wrapped up in the ethnic
problem.''
   A State Department official, however, said he believes the CIA
report was alarmist and came at a time when there was some new
cause for optimism.
   ``They've got very serious problems, and you can't rule out
things coming apart,'' the official said, ``but I'm more optimistic
than these people are.''
   He said recent republic elections have tended to sap the
political strength of Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, who is
regarded by U.S. observers as a key divisive force who has
encouraged ethnic hatreds and opposed market reforms.

<TEXT>
   The war on drugs has taken a new twist in New
Bedford. The local newspaper, teamed with the chief of police and a
top judge, has begun printing the mug shots of every person
arrested on drug charges.
   ``This newspaper has escalated the importance of crime news
relating to drugs,'' editor James Ragsdale wrote in The
Standard-Times of New Bedford.
   ``We are now saying that photographing those accused of
drug-related crime is as important as for homicides, manslaughter,
arson and the rest.''
   Although many newspapers run the names of people arrested for
various crimes, and some print the names of men charged with hiring
prostitutes, Ragsdale believes that publishing the pictures of drug
suspects is entirely new.
   ``This is just one of the many things this newspaper is doing to
raise public awareness that there is a drug problem,'' he said.
   Titled ``Drug Watch,'' the daily column begun Nov. 15 requires
one staff photographer and up to 30 inches of newsprint. Last
weekend's edition carried photos of nine men, ranging in age from
17 to 39, arrested for possession of various drugs, possession with
intent to distribute and conspiracy to violate drug laws.
   Mayor John Bullard praised the paper's efforts. He said New
Bedford's drug problem - and its ancillary crimes - are
overwhelming. More than 2,000 drug arrests were made in New Bedford
in the first 10 months of 1990.
   Bullard acknowledged that publishing photos may not prevent
hard-core drug use.
   ``But for those people who buy drugs and think they can stay
undercover, this should be a deterrent,'' he said Tuesday.
   Reaction to Drug Watch has been varied, with many local
officials and residents applauding the attempt and some journalists
and lawyers questioning the ethics involved.
   Sarah Wunsch, a lawyer for the Massachusetts Civil Liberties
Union, called the policy sensationalistic. She and others said the
publication of pictures threatens a defendant's right to a fair
trial.
   Ragsdale said his newspaper will make every effort to print the
outcome of each court hearing, even if that happens months or years
after initial publication.

   Two American hostages released by Iraq
arrived at a military medical center Wednesday for physical
examinations, an army spokesman said.
   The two former captives - Clyde Jesse of Buffalo Grove, Ill.,
and Fred Harrington of Bellevue, Wash. - were in relatively good
health, the spokesman said.
   Sgt. Rob Fortenberry, the spokesman at the 7100th Combat Support
Wing Medical Center in Wiesbaden, said the two had decided to take
advantage of a State Department offer to all former hostages for a
medical checkup at a military facility.
   Jesse and Harrington came to Wiesbaden via Amsterdam and Amman,
Jordan. They were released Tuesday as a goodwill gesture by Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein, whose forces invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
The two were among hundreds of U.S. and other foreign citizens held
in Iraq and Kuwait since the invasion.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush signed legislation Wednesday
easing a federal mandate to harvest 4.5 billion board feet of
timber per decade from the Tongass National Forest in Alaska.
   Environmentalists have charged a 1980 law that establishes the
U.S. Forest Service's general timber sale policy was forcing
reckless cutting in the 16.8 million-acre forest.
   The legislation establishes new criteria for managing the vast
forest that streches across the Alaska panhandle and shelters a
rich array of wildife from grizzly bears to bald eagles.
   The new management plan calls for the U.S. Forest Service to
prepare only enough timber for sale to meet market demand, instead
of an automatic 450 million board feet annually.
   Legislation enacted by Congress this year also establishes an
additional 1 million acres of the Tongass forest off-limits to
timber harvesting and creates buffers along rivers and streams from
which trees many not be taken.
   Environmentalists have said the actions to curtail timber
cutting in the forest were a step in the right direction, but that
they do not go far enough.
   ``Half a rain forest is better than no rain forest at all,''
George Frampton, president of the Wilderness Society, said last
month when the legislation cleared Congress.

   Security Council ambassadors on Wednesday
predicted adoption of a resolution allowing use of military force
to liberate Kuwait if 450,000 Iraqi troops do not withdraw by Jan.
15.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze told reporters on
arriving in New York, ``Either we will build civilized relations
between states, a new world order and new policy, or will live by
the law of the jungle.
   ``That is the question we must answer tomorrow (Thursday), and I
believe we will answer it.''
   Cuba opposes the measure but expects it to pass. ``It is quite
obvious that the resolution will be adopted,'' Cuban Ambassador
Ricardo Alarcon said.
   The only other time the United Nations sanctioned military force
to counter aggression was in 1950, during the Korean conflict.
   Thirteen of the 15 council members are expected to be
represented by foreign ministers, making it one of the
highest-level such sessions in U.N. history.
   China had indicated it would support the measure but shifted its
position Wednesday. Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said he would not
vote in favor.
   The statement was widely viewed as a move to win political
concessions from Washington, which acted to punish Beijing after
the June 1989 military crackdown on the pro-democracy movement.
   Diplomats suggested China might abstain, but probably would not
veto the measure.
   The five permanent Security Council members - the United States,
the Soviet Union, China, France and Britain - have veto power.
   ``It seems rather clear that they're not thinking of vetoing,''
said British Ambassador David Hannay.
   On Wednesday, the council ended debate on allegations of Iraqi
atrocities in Kuwait, and adopted a resolution 15-0 asking the
United Nations to take custody of Kuwait's census records, smuggled
out by the Kuwaiti resistance.
   Iraq has been destroying records in a bid to erase Kuwaitis'
national identity. It moved more than 100,000 Iraqis into occupied
Kuwait to change its demographic character.
   U.S. Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering told Wednesday's session:
   ``The record of rape, plunder, torture, and murder compiled by
Iraqi authorities since their invasion of Kuwait has posed a direct
challenge to the purposes for which this organization was founded.
...
   ``Iraq's policy must fail. As members of the United Nations we
are all bound, by our charter obligations, to oppose Iraq's policy,
accomplish the withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwait, and to
obtain the re-establishment of Kuwaiti authority. May that day come
shortly.''
   The draft resolution gives Iraq a final chance to withdraw from
Kuwait by Jan. 15. After that, the measure authorizes ``all
necessary means'' to dislodge the Iraqi forces.
   The measure also calls on Iraq to free all foreign hostages and
restore the rule of the Kuwaiti royal family.
   Baghdad has ignored a series of U.N. resolutions demanding it
withdraw from Kuwait, which Iraq overran Aug. 2.
   ``There is political will to adopt another resolution,'' said
Canadian Ambassador Yves Fortier. ``I predict that an additional
resolution will be adopted.''
   The British envoy said the measure ``provides a breathing space
of time for thought by Saddam Hussein to reflect really carefully
on what would follow if he didn't come into line with the Security
Council resolutions by the date fixed in the resolution.''
   ``It does very clearly mean that after that date, it will be
possible - though it is not certain and it is not in itself
automatic - it will be possible for members of the United Nations
to use force to bring Iraq into conformity with these
resolutions,'' Hannay said.
   Soviet sources said ``extensive arm-twisting'' would be applied
to Baghdad in the next six weeks, and that it was likely there be
``a deal ... cut under the table'' for an Iraqi withdrawal.
   Chinese Ambassador Li Daoyu presided over the meetings of the
five permanent members of the council that resulted in the draft
resolution approved by them Monday. Soviet Ambassador Yuliy
Vorontsov had said then there was ``broad agreement'' on the
measure.
   China opposes the Iraqi invasion, but is reluctant to sanction
force.
   Qian is meeting with Secretary of State James A. Baker III
before Thursday afternoon's vote, and diplomats suggested he would
be seeking concessions.
   Those might include an end to U.S. opposition to World Bank
loans to China that do not address humanitarian needs, a resumption
of defense cooperation and military sales, and agreement not to
link China's human rights record to its most-favored-nation trade
status.
   Baker will preside over Thursday's Security Council meeting.
   Permanent members America, Britain, France and Soviet Union are
expected to vote for the resolution, as are at least seven
non-permanent members: Canada, Finland, Romania, Ivory Coast,
Malaysia, Zaire and Ethiopia.
   Colombia has been reluctant to endorse use of force. However,
like China, it voted for the 10 previous resolutions and is
expected to back this one in the end.
   Cuba says it will not vote in favor, and Yemen, the council's
only Arab member, is believed likely to abstain or vote against it.
   A resolution requires at least nine votes to pass, so long as no
permanent member vetoes it.
   The proposed resolution gives the United States and other allied
powers permission to act without any direct U.N. control. Member
states will only have to ``keep the council regularly informed on
the progress of actions'' they undertake.

<HEAD>At Least 1,000 in Indiana Forced From Their Homes by Flooding</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DYER, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At least 1,000 people Wednesday were forced
from their Indiana homes, some evacuated by boat, after two days of
rain overflowed creeks and ditches, officials said.
   In Chicago, one man died trying to drive through 12-foot-deep
water in a closed viaduct, police said. In Highland, Ind., a man
was electrocuted when his truck became ensnared in power lines.
   The heavy rain in northwest Indiana later abaited, but the
National Weather Service issued a flood warning for the Kankakee
River through Saturday. Its rising waters were expected to match
levels recorded in August, when the region was declared a federal
disaster area, officials said.
   Two emergency shelters were set up in Lake County for those left
homeless by high water. Evacuations began Tuesday night.
   Between 3 and 6 inches of rain fell in most areas of Lake,
Porter and LaPorte counties from Monday night to Wednesday morning.
   Firefighters, police officers and volunteers with boats helped
evacuate more than 600 people from about 230 homes in Dyer's Berens
subdivision. The homes were cut off by high water, officials said.
   The evacuees were taken to the St. John Township Community
Center, where the Red Cross had set up a shelter, Koschal said.
   About 300 evacuees in Highland were taken to a shelter set up in
the Lincoln Center, a former school that houses the city's
department of parks and recreation.
   Northwest Indiana was declared a disaster area after the August
flood, making homeowners eligible for low interest loans to repair
flood damage.
   In O'Fallon, Mo., Gov. John Ashcroft toured two storm-damaged
parts of the state Wednesday to examine the destruction left by
powerful winds and a tornado.
   Ashcroft took a look at an O'Fallon neighborhood where homes and
businesses were destroyed by 100 mph winds. Fire Chief David House
said damage was estimated at $36 million, but he said that figure
could go higher.
   About 30 people in the O'Fallon area were injured in Tuesday's
storm, including a hunter who was listed in critical condition
Wednesday. Authorities said it was miraculous no one was killed.

<TEXT>
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze will meet with President Bush next month to make
preparations for a Moscow summit that could be held as early as
January, the Soviet official said Wednesday.
   The timing of the Moscow summit depends on progress on a treaty
to cut the superpowers' long-range nuclear weapons, Shevardnadze
said.
   Before he sees Bush, the foreign minister will meet Dec. 10-11
in Houston with Secretary of State James A. Baker III.
   There, Shevardnadze said, they also will take up the issue of
the prolonged crisis in the Persian Gulf ``in a very serious and
substantive way.
   ``There is still hope there will be a peaceful resolution of
this conflict,'' Shevardnadze told reporters after a meeting with
Baker at the Soviet mission to the United Nations.
   Houston is Baker's hometown. Shevardnandze, referring to a
productive meeting they held this year in Wyoming, said with a
smile that he and Baker seem to work best outside their capitals.
``A natural enviornment helps,'' Shevardnadze said.
   Bush had hoped to go to Moscow to see Soviet President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev and sign a new U.S.-Soviet strategic arms limitation
treaty in December. But several unsettled issues, including the
kinds of tests the Soviets will be permitted with long-range SS-18
missiles, have slowed completion of the accord.
   Asked if the summit could now be held in January, Shevardnadze
said, ``I don't know if January or perhaps a little later. To a
large extent this will depend on what we will be able to do with
the START (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty).''
   He said the two sides were ``quite realistic about being able to
complete it'' and said, ``There is a lot of work we will have to
do.''
   The treaty would cut U.S. and Soviet arsenals of long-range
nuclear missiles, bombers and submarines by about 30 percent.

   Sixty-eight Italians, 10 Britons and three
Americans who had been held hostage by Iraq made their way home
Wednesday via Amman. Iraqi officials said they would soon be
freeing other foreigners as well.
   At least three of the former Italian hostages said they had been
held at strategic military and industrial sites in Iraq, the first
reports that Italians were used as ``human shields.''
   Earlier only Americans, Britons and Japanese were reported held
at such sites, with all Germans and French released. Iraq has been
using ``human shields'' in the hopes it will deter attacks by the
multinational forces assembled in the Persian Gulf.
   The 68 Italians arrived in Rome late Wednesday aboard a special
MD-80 Alitalia jet from this capital. They were freed through the
intervention of a Syrian-born Catholic archbishop. In addition, the
Italian government had sent a plane full of medicine to Iraq.
   ``We Palestinians have an incalculable debt toward the Italian
people and government for the human and political solidarity they
have shown us,'' said the archbishop, Hilarion Capucci, as he
stepped off the plane in Rome.
   Hostages heading toward a crowd of waiting relatives burst into
applause at his words.
   Capucci, a Syrian-born Melchite Catholic who lives in Italy, is
a member of the Palestine National Council, a sort of
parliament-in-exile. He had been jailed for nearly three years in
Israel on charges of smuggling arms to Palestinians, but was
released in 1977 after an appeal by Pope Paul VI.
   Melchite Catholics are Arab Christians who have formed an
Eastern-right branch of the Roman Catholic Church. They recognize
the primacy of the pope but exercise much independence.
   Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein had agreed to free 70 Italians after
the appeal by Capucci and a group of Italian peace activists.
   One Italian who had suffered a brain hemorrhage was flown home
on Monday, while another man, identified as Luigi Canino, chose to
remain in Baghdad, according to the Italian news agency ANSA.
   The hostages who arrived in Rome spoke briefly with reporters
about their months of detention.
   ``We feared the outbreak of war and made plans,'' recalled a man
who identified himself as GianCarlo Formica. ``There was that fear
for your own skin.''
   He urged Italian politicians to make trips to Baghdad to seek
the liberty of hostages, even if only a few are allowed to leave at
a time.
   ``We believe that with bringing home 50 or 60 people, 50 or 60
families return to life,'' he said.
   ``We were treated well - deluxe hostages,'' said another man.
But he said that those remaining behind are bitter. ``They think
not enough is being done here'' by the government, he said.
   Iraq is still holding about 200 Italians among an estimated
2,000 Westerners.
   On the stop in Amman, Capucci told reporters he would attend a
conference called ``Happy Be the Peacemakers'' scheduled to open in
Baghdad on Monday. He said clergymen from all over the world will
be there.
   He said on this next trip, he will try to bring out some sick
hostages and perhaps others, both Italians and non-Italians.
   The three freed Americans and their families flew to Frankfurt,
Germany, aboard a Royal Jordanian flight. Another Royal Jordanian
flight for London took off later carrying the 10 former British
hostages and their families.
   Both groups were released after their families flew to Baghdad
and appealed to Saddam to free them.
   The State Department, which has said Iraq should free all
hostages unconditionally, has advised American relatives of
hostages not to travel to Iraq, saying they could become hostages
themselves or play into the hands of Iraqi propagandists.
   Boxing great Muhammed Ali said Wednesday he has been promised
the release of at least 14 U.S. hostages, and plans to fly home on
Saturday.
   Britain's Foreign Office said Wednesday that 55 more Britons
detained in Baghdad have been moved to strategic sites in Iraq,
raising the total held at such installations to about 350.
   In other developments, Saddam on Wednesday directed his
Parliament to discuss freeing Belgian hostages. Thirty Belgians are
being held.
   In addition, an Iraqi official denied that Baghdad was stopping
Soviets from leaving.
   The Soviet Foreign Ministry on Monday accused Baghdad of
breaking a promise to allow hundreds of Soviets in Iraq to leave
and threatened a ``tougher attitude'' if they were not granted
freedom.
   But the Iraqi Foreign Ministry spokesman said Wednesday the
Soviets are fulfilling work contracts in Iraq and will be allowed
to leave when the contracts expire.
   More than 8,000 Soviets were in Iraq and Kuwait before the Aug.
2 invasion of Kuwait. Fewer than half that number remain.
   Five freed Germans were also preparing Wednesday to leave Jordan
for home.
   The Germans, who were in hiding before emerging Saturday to take
advantage of an Iraqi decision to free all German nationals, were
to fly to Frankfurt aboard a Lufthansa flight Thursday, according
to the German Embassy.
   In addition, Robert Cordett, a member of Canada's Parliament,
said in Baghdad that six of the 47 Canadians held in Iraq and
Kuwati will be freed.
   The Irish Embassy in Baghdad said 12 of the more than 200 Irish
citizens in Iraq and Kuwait were also told they could go home.
   Saddam has offered to free foreigners in exchange for guarantees
he will not be attacked. On Nov. 18, he offered to free all
foreigners between Dec. 25 and March 25 provided the atmosphere
remains peaceful.
   He has released hostages on a piecemeal basis, in reponse to
pleas from visiting dignitaries.

<HEAD>Congressmen Hoping Saddam Gets Message War Would Be Suicide</HEAD>

   Twenty U.S. lawmakers said
Wednesday a U.N. resolution setting a Jan. 15 deadline for Iraq to
withdraw from Kuwait should send Saddam Hussein a message that war
would be suicide.
   After talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in Cairo and a
day of visiting U.S. troops in the Saudi Arabian desert, the
Congressional members told a news conference the United States and
its allies want peace, but would decisively win any war.
   ``We are trying to convince the man in Iraq that he is in a
suicidal position. We have got to convince him that he cannot win
... and that's the reason for the resolution before the United
Nations,'' said Rep. Nicholas Mavroules, D-Mass., who led the
Congressional delegation.
   He said the resolution showed ``dedication on the part of those
who want peace.''
   ``I think the resolution ... tends to squeeze more and more and
tighter and tighter each day the message we're trying to get across
to Mr. Saddam Hussein. That's the meaning of the resolution and we
hope it's going to work,'' he said.
   The U.N. Security Council is expected to vote Thursday on the
resolution that would authorize the use of force against Iraq after
Jan. 15 unless it withdraws its 450,000 troops from Kuwait.
   Rep. Robert W. Davis, R-Mich., said Mubarak told the delegation
``a lot of pressure is going to be applied from a lot of other
country leaders trying to convince Saddam Hussein that ... he
cannot win in a war with the United States and these other nations.
   ``We are going to defeat him, and defeat him decisively if in
fact we have to go to war,'' Davis said.
   Rep. Larry J. Hopkins of Kentucky, the ranking Republican on the
House Armed Services Investigations Subcommittee, said: ``I would
strongly advise him, after witnessing and seeing what we have here
already, what we know is coming in the future ... to come to his
senses because he has nothing in store but a lot of grief and death
from his part of the world.''
   He said the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait was completely different
than any previous crisis this century because ``for the first time
the superpowers ... can no longer be played off against each
other.''
   Rep. Marilyn Lloyd, D-Tenn., said every single leader the
delegation spoke to wanted economic sanctions against Iraq to work.
   ``We did not meet with a single leader who said, `Hey, we want
to go out in a shooting war.' Certainly the mission, if at all
possible, is to avert war,'' she said.
   Members of the delegation were divided on the effectiveness of
sanctions.
   Rep. Robert K. Dornan, a Republican hawk from Southern
California, predicted Saddam's demise because of the effectiveness
of sanctions.
   ``He'll be overthrown in three months. He'll be assassinated
within two to four months, no doubt in my mind about it at all.
Sanctions are working. The pressure is incredible. It's going to
build, and his officers will kill him within four months. I'm
taking bets,'' he said.
   Mavroules, chairman of the House Armed Services Investigations
Subcommittee, said Iraq was losing $2 billion a month because it
couldn't export oil and it was suffering from a shortage of spare
parts. ``Common sense tells you the man cannot survive,'' he said.
   But Davis said even though sanctions are working, he wasn't
confident they were working well enough to drive Saddam out of
Kuwait.
   The delegation praised the high morale of U.S. troops living
under difficult conditions in the desert.
   But Rep. Mary Rose Oakar, D-Ohio, stressed that the front-line
troops were not ``living in penthouse conditions. ... It's a
tremendous sacrifice.''
   Some soldiers, she said, had complained about feeling isolated,
the lack of communications with their families and news from the
outside world, and the boredom of waiting for something to happen.
   ``The morale I thought was very high and it got higher as we got
closer to the Kuwaiti border,'' said Rep. Robert J. Lagomarsino, a
California Republican. ``The more primitive the conditions the
higher the morale. And that's not accidental because the people in
the more primitive conditions are the combat infantry, the combat
Marine forces that were trained in the desert so they know what
they're doing.''

   Nicaragua granted refugee status
Wednesday to two Cuban doctors who said they feared returning home
and defected, officials said. Costa Rica gave them tourist visas
and they left for there later in the day.
   Mario Antonio Reyes Morales, 29, and Gilberto Marcelino Perez
Franco, 30, were part of a medical team Cuba sent to work in
Nicaraguan hospitals before the leftist Sandinista government lost
power in Feb. 25 elections.
   Both specialized in newborn babies. They arrived here the spring
of 1989 and defected last Friday.
   The doctors asked Nicaragua for political asylum but had been
housed at the Costa Rican embassy.
   Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Claudia Paniagua said Nicaragua
granted them refugee status and gave them travel documents so they
could fly to neighboring Costa Rica.
   She said it was the first time under President Violeta
Chamorro's 7-month-old government that any Cuban worker asked
asylum.
   Despite the change of government, Cuban medical workers have
remained in hospitals here to make up for the severe shortage of
health-care specialists, most of whom left the country during the
decade of Sandinista rule.
   In San Jose, Costa Rica's foreign minister, Bernd Niehaus, said
his government decided to grant the doctors 30-day tourist visas
while authorities there checked their request for political asylum.
   ``If we can prove they are politically persecuted, we'll give
them asylum,'' Niehaus said.

   Two former U.S. military chiefs urged caution
in the Persian Gulf on Wednesday, even as President Bush sent
Secretary of State James A. Baker III to press the United Nations
for formal support of a possible attack against Iraq.
   ``I counsel patience,'' said retired Adm. William Crowe, who was
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under President Reagan.``War
is not neat, it's not tidy, and once you resort to it, it's
uncertain and it's a mess.''
   Retired Air Force Gen. David C. Jones, chairman of the joint
chiefs under President Carter, voiced concern with the latest troop
deployment, in which Bush is sending 200,000 more to bolster the
230,000 already in the gulf and to add an offensive capability.
   Jones said his fear ``isn't that we might choose to fight, but
rather that the deployment might cause us to fight - perhaps
prematurely and perhaps unnecessarily.''
   The former chiefs' comments were generally in line with those of
lawmakers - mainly Democrats - whose objections have risen in
volume as a shooting war has seemed more likely in the weeks since
Congress adjourned for the year.
   Post-adjournment hearings by a range of committees are occurring
this week and next, though top Bush officials won't testify until
next week, after the U.N. Security Council action.
   Baker went to New York Wednesday to personally take charge of
the U.S. effort to win formal international support of the idea of
a last-resort attack to free Kuwait from Saddam Hussein's forces,
which invaded on Aug. 2.
   Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., the Senate minority leader, said in a
statement Wednesday evening the chances were ``better than 50-50''
for a special session to deal with the Gulf, probably before
Christmas. He didn't say who would call it, the president or
congressional leaders.
   Dole's statement attracted attention because he put it out after
a chat with the president. But the White House said no decision had
been made on whether to seek a special session.
   ``The question is how much pain we administer and how quickly
and whether we do it with the embargo or the use of force,'' said
Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., whose Armed Services Committee began its
hearings Tuesday.
   Later, Nunn expressed doubts about the size of the U.S. forces,
saying the number ``is much too large to be able to be sustained
politically and perhaps even logistically.''
   Meanwhile, House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt broke with the
administration and stepped ahead of other party leaders on the
subject of military confrontation with Saddam, announcing his
opposition to the use of U.S. military force in the near future.
   And Rep. Lee Hamilton, chairman of the House Foreign Affairs'
Middle East Subcommittee, said he believes it is time for Bush to
send an envoy to Baghdad to open talks with Saddam, with the aim of
making U.S. intentions clear and exploring non-military solutions
to the crisis.
   On the Republican side, Sen. Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas said in
an interview that a special envoy, accompanied by other
international officials, should be sent to make sure Saddam
understands ``there is a deadline there and it will be met and
we're serious about it.''
   Democrats, some suggesting the United States is careening
inexorably toward war in the Middle East, are using the hearings to
try and muscle their way into decision-making on the gulf.
   Sen. Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, the former Senate
Democratic leader, told Armed Services Committee colleagues he
believed the world would welcome ``patience rather than
impetuousness'' before any U.S. decision to go to war.
   ``When we view grandmothers and grandfathers who lost not one
but two, three grandchildren and they feel we took the action too
hastily, I think we'll all have the time to be sorry,'' Byrd said.
   This came just hours after Gephardt, D-Mo., formally announced
his opposition to the use of force during a breakfast speech to a
U.S. Chamber of Commerce audience across Lafayette Park from the
White House.
   ``The policy of patient strength is, I think, our best hope,''
Gephardt said, and he made clear he was opposing any congressional
resolution authorizing the use of force. In so doing, he parted
company with other Democratic leaders who said Bush would have a
better chance of winning congressional backing for the use of force
if the United Nations first endorsed this option.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater declined to respond
directly to the statements by Gephardt and the former chairmen of
the joint chiefs.
   ``Obviously there are going to be different opinions,''
Fitzwater told reporters.
   Fitzwater said Bush does not plan to ask Congress for authority
to launch any attack under the War Powers Act. The president
maintains he already has the authority to take such action.
   On Capitol Hill, Crowe and Jones recommended that the United
States give economic sanctions against Iraq a year to 18 months to
work before opting for military force.
   And Crowe said that Bush must consider the future implications
of attacking an Arab nation in the tenuous Middle East situation.
   ``I am persuaded that the U.S. initiating hostilities could well
exacerbate many of the tensions I have cited and further polarize
the Arab world,'' Crowe said.
   Former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger testified, ``I do
not believe we can maintain 400,000 troops much beyond the spring
of next year, and therefore our general position will be - yes, we
will be driven to'' a decision on whether to go to war.
   Meanwhile, Hamilton, D-Ind., said debate now on a congressional
resolution could lead Saddam to believe U.S. resolve was weakening.
   ``I don't know whether it would carry or not'' if put to a vote
in Congress, ``but there would be a large number of votes against
it,'' he said.
   Democrats weren't alone in questioning Bush's strategy in the
gulf.
   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., said Bush's decision to double the U.S.
military presence in Saudi Arabia ``has painted us into a very
difficult corner.''
   Hyde, normally hawkish on defense matters, urged Bush to work
out a rotation that would gradually replace U.S. troops with those
of allies and ``get down our presence for the long haul to a more
manageable structure.''

   Tavern owners jammed jukeboxes with earth-shaking tunes and
worried residents squirreled away water and flashlights Wednesday
as the questionable countdown progressed for a major earthquake as
early as next week on the New Madrid Fault.
   The commotion is over a projection made by Dr. Iben Browning,
who said there was a strong chance of a major earthquake Dec. 2-3
in an area that includes the New Madrid Fault, from Arkansas
through Missouri to Illinois.
   ``We're ready for it. I have 13 gallon jugs of water, blankets,
two sleeping bags, a pipe wrench, canned food, a flashlight and a
radio with extra batteries,'' said Debbie Brunk of Bonne Terre,
Mo., which is about 50 miles from the New Madrid fault zone.
   Others took the projections a little more lightly.
   Bumper stickers saying ``It's Iben Browning's Fault'' have
started popping up on cars in the region.
   One tavern owner has come up with a list of songs having to do
with earthquakes.
   Joe Edwards, owner of the Blueberry Hill tavern in St. Louis,
said he's filling his jukebox with earthquake songs and serving
special drinks to ``help our customers cope with any anxiety they
might be feeling.''
   He had culled more than 150 songs, including ``Dancin' on the
Ceiling,'' ``Church Bells May Ring,'' ``If We Make it Through
December'' and at least 13 titles containing the word ``shake.''
   Meanwhile, Iben Browning's daughter, Evelyn Garriss, stood by
her father's projection after San Francisco radio station KCBS
reported that she said her father believes there's a 50-50 chance
of a major quake outside the United States.
   ``We are less concerned about (San Francisco Bay area's Hayward
fault) recently than we continue to be about some of the other
places, like Japan,'' she said.
   Later Wednesday, she said the earlier forecast for a major quake
striking the Midwest was still valid. Browning's family said he was
on vacation and refused to disclose where. He has refused in the
past to make any additional comment on the projection.
   ``We have not changed our projection,'' she told The Associated
Press at her home in Tijares, N.M., outside Albuquerque.
   Earthquake experts and other scientists have repeatedly said
that Browning's projection, which relies on the measurement of the
pull of tidal forces on the earth, was nothing more than a random
guess.
   On Tuesday, a scientist for the U.S. Geological Survey strongly
discounted the projection in a briefing of Congressional staff
members in Washington.
   ``I can summarize our findings by saying there is no reason ...
that a large earthquake is more likely to occur ... Dec. 2 or 3
than it is today, three weeks from today or any day in the
future,'' said Randall Updike, associate chief of the survey's
Office of Earthquake, Volcanoes and Engineering.
   Scientists agree there is a long-term threat of a major
earthquake in the Midwest, but there is no scientific way to
pinpoint a date for when it will occur.
   The seven states near or along the fault zone are Missouri,
Arkansas, Tennessee, Mississippi, Kentucky, Indiana and Illinois.
Some residents don't put much stock in the projection, but many
aren't taking any chances.
   Earthquake insurance sales have skyrocketed and state regulators
from the region have formed a special committee to monitor the
availability of policies amid reports that some companies have
stopped selling earthquake insurance.
   Schools districts up and down the fault zone, which runs from
Marked Tree, Ark., northeast through Missouri to Cairo, Ill., have
canceled classes for Dec. 3 and 4 and some local governments also
have decided to shut down.
   Other state and local officials are gearing up for earthquake
drills.
   Sales of survival kits and other emergency preparedness items
also have increased in the region as businesses scramble to take
advantage of the sudden interest in earthquakes.

   Milli Vanilli's Rob Pilatus was freed from
jail on $10,000 bond, but he couldn't escape the media after being
arrested for investigation of sexual battery.
   ``Too much publicity,'' he said Tuesday night as he left his
home with Fabrice Morvan, his partner in the fallen lip-synching
duo.
   Prosecutors refused Wednesday to file charges against Pilatus,
saying there wasn't enough evidence to support a woman's allegation
of sexual assault.
   He was arrested early Tuesday at his home, said police
spokeswoman Maureen Dambach.
   Police said the alleged victim was a 25-year-old woman but gave
no other details. Prosecutors decided not to file charges after
interviewing the woman, said Sandi Gibbons, a spokeswoman for the
district attorney.
   Sexual battery is defined as touching ``an intimate part of
another person while that person is unlawfully restrained.''
   Pilatus also paid $485 for outstanding traffic violations before
being released, police said.
   Pilatus refused to comment on the allegations.
   The entertainers last week were stripped of the Grammy Award
they won last February for best new artist after admitting they
didn't sing of note of their album, ``Girl You Know It's True,''
which sold 7 million copies.

   Thirty amateur entertainers and athletes
headed to Iraq on Wednesday for a sports festival they hope will
defuse the Persian Gulf crisis.
   ``We're going to make every attempt to issue into all the war
rhetoric some peace rhetoric,'' organizer John Quigley said before
the U.S. group boarded a flight to Tokyo, where they will continue
on to Iraq.
   The Peace Wave International Sports and Music Festival will be
held Dec. 2-3 in Baghdad. The festival expects 300 participants,
including delegations from the Soviet Union, Japan, Venezuela and
possibly Jordan.
   Between performances the group's members, who are mostly from
the Los Angeles area, will deliver short speeches urging peace,
Quigley said.
   They hope to bring home some of the Americans held hostage,
although Iraqi officials have made no promises, he said.
   The trip is sponsored by Kanji Inoki, a member of Japan's senate
and a leader of the Sports and Peace Party. He visited Iraq during
September and helped plan the festival.
   Steve Nakada, director of the Japan-America Sports Federation,
said Inoki received assurances from the Iraqi government that the
American delegation would not be taken hostage.
   Eartha Whitfield, 41, of Carson, Calif., said initially, she was
afraid to go but decided any risk was secondry to the chance to
contribute to a peaceful resolution.
   ``I don't want to sound naive because I know we're going to a
hazardous area, but I have all confidence we'll have our say and
come home. I'm not worried,'' she said.
   Iraq has allowed some hostages to leave as U.S. and other forces
have been deployed in the gulf. However, thousands remain hostage
or are in hiding.
   The State Department has warned American relatives of hostages
not to travel to Iraq, saying they could become hostages themselves
or play into the hands of Iraqi propagandists.

   Federico Pena, the only Hispanic mayor of a major
U.S. city, announced Wednesday that he will not seek re-election in
1991.
   Pena, who parlayed skillful political know-how and a cadre of
dedicated volunteers into two terms as Denver mayor, said his time
in office ``has been the most thrilling and rewarding time of my
life.''
   But now, ``I am going to graciously step aside as mayor of this
great city and allow a new generation of leadership to take this
city into that decade,'' he said.
   The decision came as no surprise to some staff members. But it
stunned potential candidates who didn't know Pena would announce
his plans seven months before the end of his term.
   Figuring into Pena's decision was the fact that he has held
public office for 12 years, including four years in the Colorado
House.
   ``Sometimes people in public office continue to run and run and
run, and I don't think that's what voters want,'' he said. ``More
of us in public office ought to say, `it's time.' ''
   Pena's decision left Democrats looking for a possible successor
in the heavily Democratic city of 500,000 and Republicans hopeful
of gaining a foothold.
   The mayor's job ostensibly is a non-partisan position, but
Democrats have dominated the office for years.

   Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., completed his
gradual return to work Wednesday as he attended a White House
signing ceremony on housing legislation.
   Frank said his recovery from a mild heart attack on Nov. 17 will
require him to give up weight lifting and cigar smoking but won't
cut into his work on Capitol Hill.
   ``This was a bad thing to happen but if it had to happen this
was the best time,'' Frank said.
   An awareness of his family history of heart trouble saved
Frank's life when he felt chest pains and took himself to the
hospital after working out at the Metropolitan Health Club in
Boston.
   Doctors used balloon angioplasty to open a clogged coronary
artery. No open-heart surgery or major incisions were required.
   Frank's father died of a heart attack at age 53 and his
grandfather was even younger when he died of what was believed to
have been a heart attack, said Frank, who is 50.
   Frank said he did not know what effect, if any, his
much-publicized congressional ethics problems had had on his
health.
   The House reprimanded Frank for some of his actions in a
relationship with a male prostitute, Steve Gobie.

   Hawaii has the nation's lowest rate of
preventable deaths from chronic diseases and Michigan has the
highest, the federal Centers for Disease Control said Wednesday.
   The CDC found that the 50 states and the District of Columbia
could have prevented at least 26 percent of their deaths from nine
leading chronic diseases in 1986 by reducing such risks as smoking
and cholesterol levels.
   ``The bottom line is there are a lot of these deaths that are
potentially preventable,'' said Steven M. Teutsch, a CDC
epidemiologist who helped research the study.
   ``What we are hoping states do is look at where they fall in
terms of these chronic disease deaths and then examine the specific
problems in their states.''
   The study found that Hawaii had the lowest rate of preventable
deaths, with 26.4 percent of 2,817 deaths that year labeled as
preventable. North Dakota and Utah, both with 33.2 percent, tied
for the second lowest rate. New Mexico, with 37.2 percent, and
Minnesota, with 37.7 percent, rounded out the lowest five.
   Michigan had the highest rate - 53.5 percent - followed by West
Virginia's 53.3 percent, New York's 52.6 percent, Ohio's 52.1
percent and Kentucky's 52 percent.
   The CDC study, published in this week's Journal of the American
Medical Association, found that if each state reduced a risk for
its most prevalent disease, the national life expectancy of 73.7
years would increase by four years.
   Teutsch said the study was the first federal effort to track
preventable deaths, which it considered stroke, coronary heart
disease, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic
liver disease and lung, breast, cervical and colorectal cancers in
1986, the latest year data were available.
   Teutsch said the differences in rates of preventable deaths are
``potentially explainable'' by isolating various factors.
   For instance, he said Michigan's high rate may be attributable
to it being a highly industrialized state with high minority
populations where knowledge about risk of disease is low.
   In Hawaii, on the other hand, the diet leans strongly toward
seafood and vegetables, which contributes to lower cholesterol
rates and less heart disease.
   Researchers figured out which state had the lowest mortality
rate of each of the diseases and added those rates to create a
mythical ``utopian state'' with the lowest death rate in all nine
diseases - about 224 per 100,000 population. Then they compared
each state to the ideal.
   Hawaii came the closest to the ``utopian state,'' with 304.7
deaths per 100,000, or 80.34 above the ideal. Thus 26.4 percent of
its deaths were considered preventable.
   Teutsch said researchers have found that reducing even one of
the known risks for these diseases - such as smoking for lung
cancer and cholesterol for heart disease - dramatically lowers
chances of developing the illnesses.
   ``What we've seen is what's been achieved in some state,''
Teutsch said, pointing out that Hawaii has the nation's low heart
disease rate. ``If that's been achieved in some state, it
presumably can be achieved in another state.''
   The study found cigarette smoking contributed to the most deaths
from the nine diseases, 33 percent. Obesity, a sedentary lifestyle,
high cholesterol, hypertension and diabetes followed.
   It also found that use of mammography and Pap screening for
breast and cervical cancers could lower deaths from those diseases.

<HEAD>Walesa Seeks Mazowiecki's Backing in Polish Presidential Runoff</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lech Walesa revealed Wednesday he has
asked for help from Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, now
eliminated from the presidential race, in Walesa's Dec. 9 runoff
against emigre businessman Stanislaw Tyminski.
   The Solidarity leader told state radio he telephoned his
defeated rival and also called two Mazowiecki supporters -
Bronislaw Geremek, former chief of the Solidarity parliament
caucus, and Roman Catholic newspaper editor Jerzy Turowicz.
   Last Sunday's election was expected to be a contest between
Walesa and Mazowiecki over the pace of restructuring the economy
and achieving fiscal responsibility, following the end last year of
more than four decades of Communist rule.
   Dark-horse candidate Tyminski, who returned to Poland only
months ago after making a fortune in the Canada and Peru, stunned
the politicians by finishing second to Walesa. He scored big by
promising the electorate immediate raises and a quick economic
turnaround.
   Walesa got 40 percent of the vote, Tyminski drew 23 percent and
Mazowiecki 18 percent.
   That meant the top two candidates - Walesa and Tyminski - will
face off in a decisive vote in less than two weeks.
   Walesa said he made the calls because, ``I want to be the
president of all Poles and I want to find possibilities of
cooperation with anyone whose supreme goal is the good of all
Poland. ... I will make such moves to achieve this.''
   Earlier, an informed source said Walesa was expected to ask
Mazowiecki to withdraw his resignation and stay on as prime
minister until parliamentary elections in the spring. Mazowiecki
announced his resignation Monday. The source spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   Walesa picked Mazowiecki to be the East bloc's first
non-Communist prime minister. But they split in the spring over the
pace of reform, with Walesa urging greater speed and Mazowiecki
advocating a steady, measured course.
   The Solidarity movement that had presented a united front
against communism also divided.
   The presidential election was expected to be a battle between
Walesa and Mazowiecki over how quickly to restructure the economy
and achieve fiscal responsibility.
   Tyminski, who recently returned to Poland after making a fortune
in the West, changed all that by focusing on the entire direction
of the reforms. He promised immediate raises and a quick economic
turnaround.
   A special meeting of the Solidarity parliament caucus was
scheduled for tonight to consider endorsing Walesa's candidacy
against Tyminski.
   Jaroslaw Kaczynski, a top Walesa adviser and the editor of the
union newspaper Weekly Solidarity, predicted Solidarity will easily
win the runoff.
   ``Nothing could pose a threat to Walesa's victory,'' Kaczynski
said. ``It's only a question of what the proportions of victory
will be.''

   Henry Lee Lucas said he was prepared to
die Monday for a 1979 Texas slaying and believes his execution is
the state's revenge for false confessions he made to nearly 600
killings around the nation.
   ``I'm not a mass murderer,'' he said Wednesday in an interview.
``They don't want me to prove I didn't commit the crimes. I gave
law enforcement a black eye.''
   Lucas, 54, faces lethal injection for the slaying of a female
hitchhiker whose body was found Oct. 31, 1979, next to a culvert
north of Georgetown. The unidentified woman is known only as
``Orange Socks,'' which is all she was wearing when she was found.
   ``I'm worried; I'm not scared,'' Lucas said of his execution.
``I guess anybody who goes through this is worried.''
   The drifter previously confessed to nearly 600 slayings before
he began recanting them and now admits only to one - the beating
death of his mother in Tecumseh, Mich., in 1960.
   ``I'll go to Heaven,'' Lucas said. ``I've been forgiven for
that.''
   He contends he was in Florida at the time of the Orange Socks
slaying and was forced by police to confess.
   ``I tried to explain,'' he said of the confessions. ``The more I
tried, the more it became impossible to do. I know what they told
me. I only repeated it back to them.''
   Lucas' attorneys awaited the outcome of appeals to halt the
execution, which would be the 143rd in the United States since the
1976 U.S. Supreme Court ruling allowing states to resume use of the
death penalty. It would be the 38th execution in the state since
Texas resumed capital punishment in 1982.
   Lucas said he might have confessed to as many as 4,000 crimes
under duress from police and prosecutors.
   The Orange Socks conviction is Lucas' only death sentence,
although he has at least six other life terms, two 75-year
sentences and a 60-year term for other Texas convictions. He is
wanted in Florida on three first-degree murder charges for slayings
in 1980 and 1981.
   ``I wonder what it's going to be like,'' he said of his death.
``I think there's another world to go to. Hopefully, I'll make it
some day. I'd rather go the right way than the wrong way.''

<HEAD>Priest Running for President in Haiti Draws Big Crowd</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAAEL NORTON</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) - Tens of thousands of chanting,
cheering supporters greeted radical priest Jean-Bertrand Aristide,
a favorite in next month's presidential elections, on his tour
Wednesday of a northern coastal city.
   He drew one of the largest crowds ever to assemble in Gonaives,
which had been scrubbed clean for the visit.
   Estimates of the crowd ranged from 20,000 to 70,000.
   Aristide's trip coincided with the fifth anniversary of the
shooting deaths of three high school students who were killed
during an anti-government demonstration in Gonaives, about 70 miles
northwest of Port au-Prince,
   The deaths touched off nationwide protests that led to the
downfall of President-for-life Jean Claude Duvalier in 1986, ending
a 29-year-old brutal dictatorship begun by his father Francois
``Papa Doc'' Duvalier.
   After Aristide laid a wreath on the youths' graves, tens of
thousands of Haitians packed the town's main square where he led
the crowd in a patriotic hymn, ``Hallelujah!''
   The 37-year-old Aristide, who was ousted from the Roman Catholic
Church's conservative Salesian order in 1988 for allegedly
promoting revolution, is a front-runner among 11 candidates running
in the Dec. 16 presidential elections.
   It would mark the first free and fair voting in this
impoverished Caribbean nation of 6 million since Haiti gained
independence from France in 1804.
   Aristide has been campaigning since the weekend, drawing 60,000
supporters on Sunday in Cap-Haitien, Haiti's second largest city.
All along the route back to the capital, thousands of Haitians
waved handkerchiefs and shouted ``Pe Titid!,'' which in French
Creole means ``little priest,'' Aristide's nickname.
   Most of his supporters are poor slum dwellers and peasants.
Aristide gained national recognition for his fiery sermons against
the Duvalier dictatorship.

<HEAD>Pastor Accuses Blind Minister of Insubordination, Disrespect,
Dissension</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ELLENDALE, Del. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A blind minister who was barred from the
pulpit when he brought his guide dog to services has been accused
by the church's head pastor of alleged insubordination, disrespect
and causing dissension.
   The Rev. Le Roy Singleton will get a chance to argue his case
before the 128-member congregation of the Mt. Zion AME Church on
Dec. 9., the head pastor, the Rev. Ellsworth Coleman, said
Wednesday.
   Coleman said he levied the allegations during a Monday church
meeting.
   ``I said to him he was out of line by going outside of the
church to the news media with these problems. ... I told him that
what he had done has caused (dissension) within our church. I said
he was disrespectful of the church laws,'' Coleman said.
   Coleman did not mention any possible discipline against
Singleton.
   Singleton had sat in the pulpit ever since he was ordained in
1988. But when he got the dog from a training center in September,
the pastor, the Rev. Ellsworth Coleman, banished the pair to the
back of the church.
   ``The whole thing stems from one thing. He does not want the dog
in the church,'' Singleton said.
   Singleton has maintained that he and Digby, a German
shepherd-collie mix, should be allowed to sit anywhere in the
church, including the front pew with other ministers.
   ``If (Coleman) doesn't invite me up there (in the pulpit), I can
accept it. But I feel that I should be able to walk into the church
and sit anywhere I choose to be seated,'' Singleton said.
   Since being barred from the pulpit, Singleton has contacted the
local chapter of the National Federation of the Blind, which called
the news media about the dispute.
   He also has gone over Coleman's head to complain to his boss,
the Rev. Joseph D. Tull, presiding elder of the African Methodist
Episcopal Church in central and southern Delaware.
   Coleman told a church meeting on Monday that he has received
hate mail and malicious telephone calls.
   ``They were animal lovers and they weren't from Delaware,''
Coleman said.
   Coleman had not talked about the dispute publicly until
Wednesday.
   Earlene A. Hughes, president of the Delaware chapter of the
National Federation of the Blind, expressed outrage.
   ``This is a disgraceful situation,'' she said. ``It's an insult
to every blind person in this country.''

<TEXT>
   America succeeded Wednesday in delaying a
vote on protecting Palestinians in Israeli-occupied lands,
thwarting Arab states that wanted to put it ahead of a resolution
on using force against Iraq, diplomats said.
   It represented a tactical victory for the United States, which
is trying to avoid angering its Arab allies in the multinational
force arrayed against Iraq.
   The United States, November president of the U.N. Security
Council, won support for delaying the Palestinian vote until
sometime after the council votes Thursday on authorizing use of
force in the Persian Gulf, Western diplomats said. No specific date
was set.
   M. Nasser Al-Kidwa, the acting Palestinian observer, told
reporters, ``So far, the (U.S.) president of the council has
blocked it'' - referring to the PLO-backed resolution to deploy
U.N. observers to protect Palestinians.
   On Thursday, the council is certain to adopt the U.S. initiative
giving Iraq until Jan. 15 to withdraw from Kuwait or face a
possible military strike, diplomats say.
   Arab diplomats had said the Palestinian issue might be raised
Thursday during the meeting on the use-of-force resolution. The
session is expected to be attended by 13 foreign miniters.
   Any motion to discuss the Palestinian issue at Thursday's
meeting now is expected to be defeated.
   The Arab pressure placed the United States in the awkward
position of appearing to care less about the Palestinians after 23
years of Israeli occupation than about the Kuwaitis, whose country
was invaded Aug. 2 by Iraq.
   The Palestine Liberation Organization, Arab states and some
non-aligned nations contend the United States and the Security
Council are applying a double standard - acting firmly and swiftly
against Iraq but doing nothing concrete to help Palestinians.
   The United States wants to duck having to veto or abstain from
voting on what it considers to be an unacceptable resolution aimed
at helping Palestinians.
   Israel opposes the resolution and will not cooperate with an
outside ombudsman investigating Israeli practices. But diplomats
said the latest draft is weaker than earlier proposals and Israel
may not seek a U.S. veto or abstention.
   As one of the five permanent council members, the United States
can veto any resolution. America frequently cast a veto over the
years to protect its Israeli ally.
   The latest draft resolution on the territories calls ``in
principle'' for a U.N. ombudsman and an increased international
presence in the territories to safeguard the rights of
Palestinians. It also would welcome, but not mandate an
international meeting to ensure that Israel complies with the
Fourth Geneva Convention on protection of civilians in occupied
territories.

   A former U.S. attorney general, clergymen,
veterans and others urged the United Nations on Wednesday to reject
any use of force to counter Iraqi aggression and not to become an
instrument of war.
   On Thursday, the U.N. Security Council is scheduled to approve
overwhelmingly a U.S. initiative which would authorize the use of
military force to liberate Kuwait, if Iraqi invaders do not
withdraw by Jan. 15. It would approve, but not mandate U.S.-led
military action.
   ``The United Nations must not become an instrument of war,''
said a statement by the group, the Coalition To Stop U.S.
Intervention in the Middle East.
   ``Its purpose, at its creation, expressed throughout its
charter, was to end the scourge of war,'' said the statement
released at a news conference.
   The statement said that a resolution authorizing force against
Iraq ``after decades of U.N. inaction in South African and Israeli
aggresions and human rights violations will permanently damage U.N.
credibility.''
   Ramsey Clark, a former U.S. attorney general, told the news
conference that less than one year ago the United States had no
more right to invade Panama, which it did Dec. 20, than had Iraq
when it invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   He and others said that all non-violent means, sanctions, reason
and dialogue have not been exhausted. The U.N. Charter itself, he
said, only provides for military action to counter aggression after
all other possibilities have failed.
   There can be no recourse to military means to resolve
disputes,'' he said.
   Other speakers said that if the United States goes to war
against Iraq, demonstrations will erupt across the United States.
They blamed the military-industrial complex in the United States
for fanning a war.
   The Rev. Daniel Berrigan said, ``This rush to judgment in the
desert must be impeded. ... How many lives per gallon will be
spilled?''

   U.S. Health Secretary Louis Sullivan was
heckled Wednesday by AIDS activists during a speech urging
Americans to avoid self-destructive behavior.
   Sullivan, who spoke at Yale University, dropped a line from his
prepared speech that identified high-risk sexual behavior as a
hazard. He went ahead and identified smoking, reckless driving and
excessive drinking as things to stay away from.
   The speech was interrupted more than 150 times by about a dozen
members of the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power, or ACT-UP. Among
them was the national group's founder, author-activist Larry
Kramer, who was on campus to address a business class.
   Scattered throughout an audience of about 200, ACT-UP members
shouted questions, accusations and obscenities at the health
secretary, saying he was doing too little to battle the AIDS crisis
and ``blaming the victims.''
   It was a repeat of Sullivan's summer appearance at the Sixth
International Conference on AIDS in San Francisco, where ACT-UP
members drowned out his speech.
   Dr. Bernard Lytton, a Yale professor who served as moderator,
was shouted down himself when he tried to persuade the activists
not to interrupt Sullivan.
   Lytton stopped the speech midway to warn that further
disruptions would get the activists thrown out. Although the
heckling got worse, no one was ejected.
   Sullivan responded to the hecklers at least twice, once telling
them: ``If you think this adolescent demonstration does anything to
help your cause, you are mistaken.''
   During the speech and a question period afterward, Sullivan said
the government is spending far more on AIDS research than any other
disease, including heart disease, which last year claimed 20 times
more victims than AIDS.
   ``Thatgroup represents a fringe group,'' he told a news
conference after the speech. ``That doesn't represent the broad
AIDS community.''
   Sullivan's speech was the second in a series of five major
speeches he plans to give at universities across the country.
   The secretary suffered no such interruptions when he spoke to an
invitation-only audience at the Stanford Medical Center last month.
   Yale University had initially agreed, at Sullivan's request, to
allow only members of the Yale community to attend the speech,
university officials said. But the school eventually decided not to
check credentials and to let everyone attend.

   An American hostage used as a human shield in
Iraq returned Wednesday to the United States, surrounded by
relatives who met with Saddam Hussein in their effort to have him
freed.
   After his release Tuesday, John Stevenson criticized the U.S.
government for leaving his rescue to his sister and brothers,who
traveled to the Middle East despite State Department
recommendations that Americans stay away.
   ``God has blessed me with my family,'' said Stevenson, 44, a
computer specialist who was in Kuwait for 11 years. ``There are no
words for freedom. I'm very proud to be back and I'm very proud to
be an American.''
   Accompanying him were his twin sister, Mary Trundy, of Brockton,
Mass., and brothers Bill Stevenson of Panama City, Fla., and James
Stevenson of Sarasota, Fla.
   They traveled to Baghdad during the Thanksgiving holiday and met
with Saddam on Monday. Fifteen minutes after the meeting they were
told their brother would be released.
   The Bush administration has refused to negotiate the release of
American hostages, saying Iraq should free them all
unconditionally. The State Department has urged Americans not to go
to Iraq, saying they could become hostages themselves or play into
the hands of Iraqi propagandists.
   Trundy said she felt ``fantastic'' about her brother's freedom.
When asked to comment on those who thought it was wrong to travel
to Iraq, she said: ``To each his own. It's my brother.''
   Stevenson had been held hostage since Oct. 20, when Iraqi
soldiers discovered him hiding out in a villa with another man and
took them both hostage.
   He said his greatest fear was that he would be bombed. He said
he was held at a strategic site but would not disclose the
location. Saddam has deployed many hostages at such sites as human
shields against possible attack.
   Stevenson was one of three Americans, 10 Britons and five
Germans freed by Iraqi authorities. The group left Jordan on
Wednesday morning.
   Stevenson said he and other hostages met with Saddam for more
than an hour prior to their release. When Saddam told them they
would be released he also said: ``You're free, you'll be freer than
any Iraqi is.''
   The other two American captives - Clyde Jesse of Buffalo Grove,
Ill., and Fred Harrington of Bellevue, Wash. - stopped in Germany
for a medical checkup that found both were in good health.

   Multimillionaire Robert Hearin, whose wife
was kidnapped more than two years ago from the couple's posh home,
died Wednesday of an apparent heart attack, a coronor said. He was
73.
   Hearin, worth more than $200 million, evaded the news media
after the kidnapping of his wife, Annie Laurie Hearin, except for
an appearance on the television show ``Unsolved Mysteries.''
   Hearin's wife was 72 at the time of her abduction July 26, 1988,
after a lunchtime bridge party. She was never found.
   In February, a St. Petersburg, Fla., lawyer, Newton Alfred Winn,
was sentenced to 19 years in prison for conspiring to kidnap Mrs.
Hearin to avenge a bad business deal with her husband.
   Hearin was taken to Mississippi Baptist Medical Center on
Wednesday after he collapsed at his Mississippi Valley Gas Co.
office.
   ``It appears he died of a heart attack,'' said Robert Martin,
Hinds County coroner. ``This was a sudden death.''
   Hearin, who had lung surgery in 1988, was a major stockholder in
Trustmark National Bank. He was chief executive and co-owner of
Mississippi Valley Gas, one of the state's largest utilities.

<HEAD>Yeltsin Blames Some Problems On Personal Clash With Gorbachev</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Russian leader Boris Yeltsin, locked in a power
struggle with Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, said in an
interview published Wednesday that their personal differences are
still causing political trouble.
   The statements, appearing in the liberal weekly Moscow News,
were Yeltsin's first indication that the leaders' personal conflict
still plays a role in the political crisis gripping the country in
recent weeks.
   Yeltsin also reiterated his conditions for the Kremlin to win
his support for a new union treaty to hold the country together. He
said Gorbachev must agree to share more power with the 15 republics
and recognize their declarations of autonomy.
   The Kremlin's proposed treaty stands at the center of the
political standoff that pits Gorbachev, representing central power,
against Yeltsin, who has the backing of most republics. Their
conflicting orders have paralyzed power in the country.
   ``I think personalities have a lot of significance in
politics,'' Yeltsin said in the interview.
   ``Realizing all the difficulties of the current moment, I am
trying to be free from every negative thing that has happened in
our relationship with Gorbachev, so that it doesn't cast a shadow
on our business relations.''
   Yeltsin said two private meetings with Gorbachev, one last
summer and the latest Nov. 10, ``have helped us make some progress
in our relations. But there are still many difficulties.''
   Their personal relations ``are moving forward, even though each
time we have to negotiate over obstacles. There are many ahead,''
he said.
   The newspaper did not say when the interview was given.
   His comments were published a day after he clashed with
Gorbachev's supporters in the Russian republic's legislature over
consideration of the treaty, which was submitted last week for
review by the republics.
   Yeltsin, who wants a popular referendum on the treaty, agreed to
let Russian lawmakers debate the document, but without taking a
final vote.
   Gorbachev, in a separate interview published Wednesday, called
the decision a ``breakthrough.''
   The Soviet president also told the daily Rabochaya Tribuna that
republics envisioning a more loosely organized federation are
ignoring their historic ties.
   ``When I see someone trying to create the impression that all
nations have been dropped on this land by a parachute only two
weeks ago and are just now beginning to think of how to coexist, I
feel very bad,'' Gorbachev was quoted as saying.
   Gorbachev had helped Yeltsin rise in the Communist Party in the
mid-1980s, then ousted him from the ruling Politburo in 1988 after
Yeltsin criticized the slow pace of reforms.

   A white policeman initially cleared of
wrongdoing in the slaying of a black teen-ager was charged with
manslaughter Wednesday in the killing that led to race rioting.
   Gary Spath faces up to 10 years in prison if convicted of
reckless manslaughter in the Teaneck shooting of Phillip Pannell,
16. Spath claimed Pannell was reaching for a weapon when he fired.
   Witnesses disputed that claim, arguing that Pannell had his
hands raised overhead in surrender when he was shot in the back
April 10. A report from a pathologist hired by the boy's family
supported that contention.
   ``I know the truth in this matter,'' Spath said at a news
conference. ``One good thing about this is that the truth will come
out.''
   The killing heightened racial tension in Teaneck, an ethnically
mixed suburb of about 39,000 residents across the Hudson River from
New York City.
   A candlelight vigil in memory of Pannell turned into a rampage
April 11 as dozens of youths overturned police cars, smashed
windows and looted stores.
   Since then, Pannell supporters have held periodic marches, the
Rev. Jesse Jackson and Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan have
visited the town, and police officers and other supporters of
Spath, 29, staged a large rally.
   A grand jury initially declined to indict Spath, but Attorney
General Robert Del Tufo sent the case to a second grand jury
because of what he called flawed evidence presented to the first
panel.
   In a statement Wednesday, Tufo said the first panel ruled based
on ``incorrect forensic and medical conclusions and the major
error, only detected late in the game, could not be properly
corrected.''
   Critics, including many New Jersey police chiefs and Spath's
lawyer, Robert Galantucci, claimed Del Tufo's motivations for
keeping the case alive were political.
   ``This is an obvious example of the attorney general in the
state of New Jersey throwing a bone to a segment of the
community,'' Glantucci said. ``In the process, he's thrown officer
Spath to the wolves, but that's only temporarily.''
   In September, police chiefs across the state urged Gov. Jim
Florio to replace Del Tufo with a special prosecutor. Florio
declined.
   ``The grand jury has completed its work,'' Florio said in a
statement Wednesday. ``The matter now shifts to the courts where
all the evidence will be weighed and the process of justice will
continue.''
   Pannell's family, who lived in River Edge when the boy was
killed, welcomed the indictment.
   ``Del Tufo gave us a fair chance,'' said Thelma Pannell, 36, the
victim's mother. ``No matter whether you're black or white, you
have a fair chance.''
   ``It's a good sign that the grand jurors have decided that his
conduct has some blameworthiness,'' said Walter Nealy, a lawyer
representing the African Council, an organization of
African-American groups that supported the Pannell family.
   ``I think it's a hopeful sign that there was an indictment, but
we still have to monitor the rest of the criminal justice system in
this case,'' he said.
   Officer Wayne Blanco, Spath's backup at the scene, has said he
frisked Pannell and felt a gun before the foot chase, and has
denied that Pannell's arms were raised when he was shot.

   Typhoon Owen bore
down Thursday on Yap after killing two men and leaving more than
1,000 people homeless elsewhere in this sprawling Western Pacific
republic.
   The storm passed 20 miles south of the island of Woleai, but
there was no immediate word on the fate of the 300 residents, a
civil defense spokesman said.
   Owen, with sustained winds of 130 mph and gusts to 160 mph,
moved west-northwest at 14 mph and was expected to pass near the
island of Yap late Friday, said Lt. j.g. Richard Jeffries of the
Navy's Joint Typhoon Warning Center on Guam. Yap island has about
12,000 residents.
   Micronesia is in the western Pacific Ocean, north of the equator
and south of Guam, a U.S. territory. The principal island groups
include the Caroline Islands, Nauru, the Gilbert Islands, the
Northern Mariana Islands and the Marshall Islands.
   Two men were electrocuted Saturday by downed power lines when
the typhoon toppled a tree in the Micronesian capital of Pohnpei,
said Tony Palomo, a spokesman for the U.S. Department of Interior
on Guam.
   The typhoon lashed the state of Truk's sparcely-populated outer
islands with 125 mph winds Wednesday, destroying many homes, said
Ismael Dobich, a Truk state spokesman. No injuries were reported.
   Truk is about 1,488 miles southeast of Guam.

   The world's largest conservation
organization opened its general assembly Wednesday with a dire
prediction.
   The pace of extinction is such that about 1,000 living species
will vanish while the World Conservation Union holds its eight-day
meeting, William Mansfield, deputy executive-director of the United
Nations Environment Program, told the 1,200 delegates.
   A gradual warming of the planet is altering climate, changing
the world's weather patterns and worsening the crisis facing
biological diversity, he said.
   ``Slowly governments are accepting the wisdom of the late Indian
Prime Minster Nehru's comment that the alternative to co-existence
is co-destruction,'' Mansfield said.
   The World Conservation Union includes 110 government agencies
and 450 non-government organizations in 119 countries.
   Outgoing President Monkombu Swaminathan of India said the world
needs to address four major environmental problems - climatic
changes, biological diversity, the disposal of hazardous and toxic
wastes and biological productivity.
   Britain's Prince Philip, the international president of the
World Wide Fund for Nature, told the assembly the next 30 years
will be the most crucial for the future of life on earth.
   ``It has been estimated that something like one quarter of the
world's living species will become extinct within the next 30
years,'' he said.
   ``There can be no doubt that the bulk of past and future
extinctions are the direct consequence of the massive increase in
human population and the growth in the per capita demand for
natural resources.''

<TEXT>
   The Philippine government is
negotiating with a representative of late President Ferdinand
Marcos' family for the return of $5 billion in assets, an official
said Wednesday.
   Meanwhile, the government's chief lawyer threatened to stop
representing the Presidential Commission on Good Government in
lawsuits against the Marcoses and their associates to protest
recent out-of-court settlements.
   Commission Chairman David Castro declined to specify conditions
set for the return of the Marcos assets.
   He added that the negotiations with a ``close trustee'' of the
Marcoses were delicate and involved ``risk of life.'' He did not
elaborate.
   Castro said the assets comprised a ``combination of money and
property'' in other countries, which he did not identify.
   He said it would be impossible to recover the money through the
courts because the evidence would not be admissible.
   The commission is charged with recovering alleged ill-gotten
wealth amassed by Marcos and his cronies during his 20-year rule.
In 1986, a ``people power revolution'' drove Marcos into exile in
Hawaii, where he died in September 1989.
   Castro said President Corazon Aquino had been informed of the
offer to return the assets, but Philippine officials did not pursue
the proposal. He did not identify the officials.
   Castro said recovering the assets by the time Mrs. Aquino
finishes her term in 1992 was ``a reasonable expectation.''
   Despite claims Marcos and his allies stole up to $10 billion,
the Philippine government has yet to win a single lawsuit here or
abroad against his family.

   A police dog attacked and fatally

authorities said Wednesday.
   An autopsy showed the baby died from numerous bites to her chest

   Kayla Reeves, daughter of Lee County sheriff's canine specialist
Scott Reeves, was placed in her bassinet Tuesday night and found
dead on her bedroom floor about two hours later.
   The German shepherd, a male named Tasso, was impounded pending
investigation, said sheriff's spokesman Robert Graziano.
   ``This is not the kind of dog that goes around attacking
everything in sight,'' Graziano said. ``These dogs are trained to
attack only when commanded to do so.''
   Tasso, one of five certified police dogs in the department, has
been paired with Reeves since 1987, Graziano said.
   The dog was separated from his first master after he bit the
man's 5-year-old daughter, Graziano said.

   Baghdad is defiantly sending more troops into Kuwait, the
Pentagon says, as the United Nations prepares to vote on a
U.S.-sponsored resolution demanding that Iraq withdraw from Kuwait
by Jan. 15 or face the likelihood of attack.
   The Bush administration, building its case for military action
to end the nearly 4-month-old crisis, charged Tuesday that Iraq
could produce a crude nuclear bomb within a year.
   However, international nuclear inspectors who visited Iraq last
week said they saw no such evidence.
   The White House faced criticism in its drive for a U.N. war
resolution. Senate Democrats questioned the need for swift military
action and demanded more say. Some newly released hostages called
for negotiations and relatives of Americans still held by the
Iraqis urged a more cautious approach.
   ---&equals;
   WASHINGTON (AP) - House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt is the
first congressional leader to oppose authorizing use of military
force in the near future to drive Iraq out of Kuwait.
   ``The best policy now is to enforce the (economic) sanctions. I
am against authorizing force now,'' Gephardt, D-Mo., said Tuesday
in a telephone interview. ``I think we should stay the course with
sanctions'' against Iraq.
   Gephardt's opposition to a resolution is the first public break
among the Democratic leadership, who said last week that President
Bush would have a better chance of winning congressional approval
for the use of force in the Persian Gulf if the United Nations
first backed such a move.
   House Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash., and Senate Majority Leader
George Mitchell, D-Maine, did not indicate whether they support or
oppose such a resolution.
   ---&equals;
   NEW YORK (AP) - The stakes have never been higher as Secretary
of State James A. Baker III returns to the U.N. stage with what
appears to be a winning hand in a dangerous game of chicken with
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
   The issue could be no less than war or peace.
   Baker is meeting with other foreign ministers outside the United
Nations before taking charge of the Security Council on Thursday
with a U.S. resolution threatening military force to rid Kuwait of
its Iraqi invaders.
   A poker-faced politician who helped lift his old Texas country
club buddy, George Bush, to the U.S. presidency, Baker has never
run a graver risk than the threat to go to war over Kuwait if Iraq
does not pull out by Jan. 15.

   LONDON (AP) - John Major, whose up-by-the-bootstraps life
epitomized the type of Britain that Margaret Thatcher hoped to
create, was taking over the reins from her today as Britain's prime
minister.
   Mrs. Thatcher's 11{-year tenure was the longest by a British
prime minister this century. Major, 47, will be the youngest prime
minister of this century and the first leader of a major European
power with no memory of World War II.
   The new prime minister, Mrs. Thatcher's protege and most
recently her chancellor of the exchequer, or treasury chief, won
the leadership of the governing Conservative Party on Tuesday

   WASHINGTON (AP) - A former federal regulator says ``the whole
setting was an intimidating one'' when he met with four senators to
discuss financier Charles Keating and the problems of Lincoln
Savings and Loan Association.
   Edwin Gray, the former top federal thrift regulator, testified
Tuesday that Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., flanked by three
fellow lawmakers, opened the meeting by referring to Keating as
``our friend from Lincoln Savings.''
   The testimony came at a Senate Ethics Committee hearing into
charges five senators intervened improperly on behalf of Keating
and his savings and loan after he provided them with considerable
campaign contributions.
   The collapse of Lincoln, located in Irvine, Calif., will cost
taxpayers an estimated $2 billion, and Keating is currently under
indictment in California.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - The manufacturer of the Hubble Space Telescope
ignored three test failures and did not consult its own experts in
building the defective $1.5 billion instrument, a NASA
investigation concludes.
   ``There was a surprising lack of participation by optical
experts with experience in the manufacture of large telescopes
during the fabrication phase,'' the investigative board said
Tuesday in its final report.
   The manufacturer, Perkin-Elmer, relied on tests with a single
instrument called a null corrector for grinding the 94.5
inch-diameter mirror and that ``should have alerted knowledgeable
people in Perkin-Elmer and NASA'' to the need for independent
validation, the report said.
   ``There were at least three cases where there was clear evidence
that a problem was developing and it was missed all three times,''
said Dr. Lew Allen, director of the space agency's Jet Propulsion
Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., who directed the study.

   PROVIDENCE, R.I. (AP) - Brown University women are scrawling the
names of alleged rapists on the bathroom walls in a guerrilla
attempt to get the school to do more about sexual assault among
students.
   Brown spokesman Robert Reichley called the women ``Magic Marker
terrorists'' and said they face expulsion if caught.
   Students said the graffiti is aimed at getting the Ivy League
school to take stronger action against so-called date and
acquaintance rape.
   ``It's not an easy thing for a woman to take this action and I
don't think anyone was taking this lightly or doing this
vindictively or maliciously,'' said Lisa Billowitz of Brown Against
Sexual Assault and Harassment, or BASH.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - With the airplane that carried Amelia Earhart
across the Atlantic as a backdrop, the National Air and Space
Museum accepted the papers of the lost aviator.
   The ceremony Tuesday evening came 53 years after Earhart was
lost on a flight across the Pacific, an event that turned a popular
heroine of the early days of flight into a cult figure still
shrouded in mystery.
   For decades Radcliffe College in Cambridge, Mass., has held
boxes of Earhart's correspondence, including post-mortem letters
from seers claiming to know her whereabouts.
   The Earhart collection was easily the most popular in the
Schlesinger Library at Radcliffe, an affiliate of Harvard
University. Now, a microfilmed copy - 11 reels of it - is available
to a wider audience at the Smithsonian Institution's museum of
flight.

   The scene resembles a graduate seminar more
than a public high school: A handful of students sit slumped in
swivel chairs, so absorbed in the equations on the board that they
forget to finish the doughnuts on the table.
   The course is mathematical modeling. The problem is to find an
equation for building a road that offers the driver a clear view
for a specified distance.
   The students are on the wrong track and probably won't realize
it for a few more days. But instructor Dan Teague says the solving
process is the point of the exercise.
   ``You can really spend a lot of time talking with students about
what they're doing and why they're doing it,'' he said.
   For 10 years, teachers like Teague have been helping make a
success out of the North Carolina School of Science and
Mathematics, the country's first residential public high school
   Here, juniors and seniors with an exceptional aptitude for math
and science are united under one roof for the sole purpose of
learning.
   The school gives them room and board, teachers with extensive
training in their fields, and the latest in laboratories and
computers. All it asks in return is a commitment to learning,
something its students have always been willing to supply.
   ``This is an environment in which you will find the library
packed, every chair taken, until 10:30 at night,'' said Principal
William Youngblood. ``Home is school and school is home.''
   What began as an experiment credited to former Gov. Jim Hunt is
moving more into the mainstream a decade later. Today, facilities
modeled on the School of Science and Mathematics exist or are
planned in Mississippi, Alabama, South Carolina, Texas, Oklahoma,
Indiana and Florida.
   The school has churned out hundreds of top-notch scientists,
doctors, engineers and mathematicians.
   Many of its whiz kids win distinction while still at the school,
with highbrow awards such as the National Mathematical Contest in
Modeling. Three years ago, its students became the first from a
high school to place in the college-level contest.
   ``We keep getting letters from kids who keep saying this was the
best educational experience they ever had,'' Youngblood said.
``Many of the students who came to this school tell me it's the
first time they've felt they belonged.''
   Seventy-nine percent of the more than 1,700 alumni contacted in
a recent survey already have spent time in graduate school or have
plans to do so, he said.
   A large majority of alumni also completed their undergraduate
college studies at least a year ahead of their peers, he said.
   As word of that performance has spread, enrollment at the school
has nearly quadrupled to 550. Of the some 900 students who apply
each year, only about a third are accepted.
   Demographics, in addition to grades, scores and recommendations,
play a role in the competition. The school may favor a teen-ager
from a poor, rural area, for example, over his rich, city cousin.
   Those who make the grade have their work cut out for them.
Juniors and seniors often put in 12-hour days. Television is
restricted. When they need a break, these kids may take in a
Shakespeare play at nearby Duke University.
   About 3 percent eventually decide to return to more conventional
schools.
   ``I don't like science any more. I'm getting tired,'' said Jason
Parker, half in earnest, as he emerged from a biology class. ``It's
like it never ends here. You never get done with anything.''
   But the 16-year-old from Jacksonville has no plans to leave.
   ``You get to meet a lot of people and get away from home,'' he
said.
   For others, it's the challenge that counts.
   Laura Poole, 17, of Boone, said the school is the most
incredible thing that's ever happened to her. On her desk lies a
copy of the print she designed for a T-shirt in art class. ``The
mind is a muscle,'' it says.
   ``You're happier here because you're with more people who are
like you,'' said 18-year-old Brian Sauls of Benson, as he tried to
debug a computer program that quizzes people on their knowledge of
trivia.
   Occasionally, a student may get his hands on some alcohol, but
the school has few of the problems plaguing most public high
schools - no drugs, teen pregnancy or suicide attempts, Youngblood
said.
   ``We don't have knifings in the halls,'' he said.
   Instead of graffiti, walls bear statements of mind power.
``Wonders never cease as long as you never cease to wonder,'' says
a poster in the genetics engineering laboratory.
   The school, which also teaches the traditional subjects in
addition to math and science, has its critics, who contend it is
draining the brain power of other North Carolina schools.
   It also costs the state more to educate these students, about
$11,000 apiece by the latest estimate from the state education
department, compared to $3,715 per student in regular public
schools.
   The school tries to repay that debt by sharing its learning
experiences, offering seminars that train teachers from other
schools in new methods of instruction.
   ``We can take risks and learn from those risks and take what we
learn back to schools,'' Youngblood said. ``It's a grand concept.''

<HEAD>Children Bolstered Against War Clouds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Clouds of war, distressing to most adults, can
be nightmarish to children.
   Such traumas are the special concern of pastors and others who
counsel families separated by the Persian Gulf crisis.
   But other people are indirectly affected by the crisis, and it
can be particularly frightening to youngsters, says a New York
minister who has counseled children.
   With television focused on deployment of troops and guns,
coupled with the sights and sounds of everyday violence in home
communities, children need special reassurance to allay anxieties
about danger and loss of security, the Rev. Arthur Caliandro said.
   ``News clips and stories of mothers and fathers going off to a
threatened war, pictures of weapons and soldiers on the move - all
seem to give a sense of foreboding to our children,'' he said.
   He said children are at a stage when ``safety and certainty are
especially important.''
   Caliandro, senior minister of New York's historic Marble
Collegiate Church, with postgraduate training in psychology, has
conducted classes for 6-to 13-year-olds on dealing with the crisis.
   He offers several suggestions to parents on how to help
youngsters cope:
   - Don't shield them from the realities of a troubled world,
recognizing that children have seen that people can at times be bad
toward one another.
   - Don't blame God for the threatened conflict. God doesn't make
war, people do. And people are responsibile for making peace, too.
   - Discuss the gulf crisis and their fears with sensitivity,
assuring them by word and by your presence that they are loved and
won't be abandoned.
   - Be careful not to teach children to hate others. To encourage
a blanket hatred of Iraqis or Moslems or any other group will
complicate their growth. Point out that almost all people get angry
and many have waged war and also that families of other religions
and nationalities are like us.
   - With older children, acknowledge the dangers in our troubled
and violent world. Point out that hardship and losses are part of
life and acceptance of danger helps deal with any pain it may
bring.
   - Encourage optimistic attitudes. Tell the story of Eastern
Europe becoming free, helping them believe things can get better.
Being optimistic is not naive; pessimism never improves bad
situations.
   - Use the opportunity to teach the difference between anger and
peace, between worry and trust, in their own lives, helping them
learn to seek peace and to make their minds more peaceful so they
sometimes can teach others how.
   - No matter how tense the situation gets, encourage them to hold
on to hope and to know that history's most heroic moments were
sustained by hoping and praying against impossible odds.
   - Help them face the fact that ours is not an ideal world, and
it is up to each of us to make it a little better.
   In a similar vein, the Justice for Women's Committee of the
Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) issued a special call to prayer for
women and children affected by the gulf crisis.
   The special prayer goes in part:
   ``Almighty God ... We lift our hearts to you as we share the
pain and fear of families of all those who are affected by the
volatile situation in the Middle East, and especially ... women .
.. and the children who suffer as a result.''
   Roman Catholic Bishop Francis Quinn of Sacramento, Calif.,
offered what he termed an ``awkward'' prayer for about 120 National
Guard soldiers recently as they left for duty in the Persian Gulf.
   ``Divine parent in heaven,'' the prayer began, ``protect these
loved ones whom we now send forth. We find it awkward to pray to
you today, Lord. All sides in the present conflict read sacred
Scriptures. And pray to the same God.
   ``And each invokes your aid, Lord, against the other. The
prayers of all cannot be answered. You, God, have your own purposes
and plans.''
   The prayer then centered on sustaining the individual soldier
and included Moslem and Buddhist as well as biblical invocations,
concluding with this paraphrasing of Abraham Linclon during the
Civil War:
   ``Fondly do we hope, fervently do we pray that this threatening
scourge of war may surely pass away. Amen.''

<HEAD>Listening for Answers at Congressional Hearings on the Gulf</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At Senate hearings on President Bush's Persian
Gulf policy, the answers count less than the questions.
   And a question that's being asked repeatedly is why the
administration seems to be in a hurry to risk military action
instead of waiting for economic sanctions to force Iraq out of
Kuwait.
   There is no answer. Threatening a military offensive doesn't
mean there's going to be one. But as long as it's credible, a
threat can be a weapon too.
   ``The president is talking to many audiences,'' said James R.
Schlesinger, the former secretary of defense and CIA director. ``He
is not only talking to the American people, he is talking to the
United Nations, he is trying to convey to Saddam Hussein that he is
prepared, if need arise, to use military power...''
   Schlesinger, leadoff witness at the Senate Armed Services
Committee, said he doesn't know that Bush really has turned to the
military option, and so he can't judge it to be premature.
   He favors waiting while the sanctions exact their toll on Iraq.
He also says that Bush's order nearly doubling U.S. forces is
evidence of American determination and will strengthen the
sanctions.
   Democrats tended to agree on the first point but not the second.
They say that the Nov. 8 order changed the mission from defense and
sanctions to one in which offensive action is an option.
   It's the questions and comments of the senators that carry the
message in Senate Armed Services Committee hearings. This week's
witnesses - former officials, retired generals and Cabinet officers
- are offering expert opinions, but they do not make decisions any
more. Senators do, or will after Congress reconvenes in January.
   The administration's decision makers are in reserve, unavailable
until next week. That's when the White House expects to have in
hand a United Nations Security Council resolution authorizing the
use of force to drive Iraq out of occupied Kuwait unless Saddam
Hussein withdraws in the next six weeks.
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., the committee chairman, said he favors the
U.N. resolution as a warning to the Iraqi leader. ``This U.N.
resolution, however, is not a substitute for fully informing the
American people of our own nation's objectives and strategy,'' Nunn
said in opening the hearings on Tuesday.
   Nunn said the hearing schedule was set in the first place to
accommodate Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney and Gen. Colin Powell,
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the officials he wanted to
lead off. But he said the administration chose not have them
testify this week. They will appear on Monday.
   Secretary of State James A.Baker III is to testify next
Wednesday at companion hearings before the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee.
   Sen. John Warner, R-Va., said Cheney stayed away this week
because ``he felt, and it was the administration's belief, that his
appearance ... might in some way conflict with the work in the
United Nations.'' He said the administration supported having the
hearings proceed.
   But there were political strains. Nunn had taken the lead in
criticizing the order doubling troop strength, telling Bush that it
represented a fundamental change in policy, and that he'd need a
declaration of war to order the liberation of Kuwait. A Republican
senator said Nunn had timed the hearings for political purposes.
   ``The chairman is opening a presidential campaign,'' Sen.
Malcolm Wallop of Wyoming said before the hearings began.
   Nunn is a fixture on the guess list of potential Democratic
presidential candidates, but a challenge to gulf policy at this
point would be a risky beginning for any campaign. Too many open
questions.
   The central one, of course, is war or peace. Nunn said he does
not question that military action is justified. ``The question is
whether military action is wise at this time, and in our own
national interest,'' he said.
   Sen. Albert Gore Jr., D-Tenn., said there is no lack of sympathy
for the problems Bush confronts. ``We all here understand that it
is an awful lot easier to ask questions than to answer questions,''
he said.
   ``I'm concerned that our debating in public what our strategy is
going to be simply plays into Saddam Hussein's strategy,'' said
Sen. Dan Coats, R-Ind.
   Sen. William S. Cohen, R-Maine, said there is a danger that
Saddam ``will view debate as dissension, and dissension as a
political defeat for President Bush.'' But he said it is worth
taking that risk so that Bush will know whether Congress and the
American people support his policy before any shots are fired.
   So the questions continue, some with built-in answers, like
Nunn's on the desirability of waiting for the sanctions to work.
   ``Would you believe it would be advisable for us to begin acting
as though time is on our side and that we do as a nation have the
patience to see this through,'' he asked.
   ``Absolutely,'' said Schlesinger.

<HEAD>Dodging the December Mutual Fund Trap</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Many long-term investors in mutual funds who
usually don't worry much about the timing of their decisions are
making an exception to that rule right now.
   Heading into December they start picking their spots carefully
to dodge a potential pitfall that can arise from yearend
distributions by funds that invest for capital gains.
   The strategy they follow, as summarized by the mutual-fund
specialists at Donoghue's Moneyletter in Holliston, Mass.: ``Don't
invest any new money in a domestic stock fund from now until after
the fund has declared its yearend capital gains distribution.''
   By law, funds that accumulate capital gains by selling stocks or
other securities at a profit must pass those gains through to their
shareholders in order to stay clear of tax problems of their own.
   Until a few years ago, these distributions were commonly made in
the year after the gains were realized. Now the law requires that
they must be declared before Dec. 31.
   Investors normally are happy to see these gains being achieved,
and recognize that they must sooner or later share the bounty with
Uncle Sam.
   But many experts on mutual-fund investing say the unwary can
incur a needless tax problem if they put new money into a fund when
a distribution is about to be made.
   To see how that can work against you, consider this example: On
Dec. 15, you invest $1,000 in the Hypothetical Fund at $10 a share,
giving you 100 shares. Then, on Dec. 18, the fund declares a $2 per
share capital gains distribution, payable Jan. 5.
   You will be credited with a $200 payout, whether you receive
distributions in cash or reinvest the proceeds, and it will be
taxable as 1990 income.
   By contrast, if you waited until Dec. 19 to make your
investment, none of your money would be cycled back to you. After
the payout, the per-share value would have dropped to $8, and your
$1,000 would buy you 125 shares.
   In either case, the net value of the investor's position is the
same. But any pre-distribution buyer who is in, say, the 28 percent
tax bracket, faces a tax bill of $56.
   ``He has not benefited from the distribution, only incurred a
tax liability,'' says Sheldon Jacobs in his annual Handbook for
No-Load Fund Investors.
   Pre-distribution buyers who reinvest their payouts get some
compensating relief by adding the amount of the money they reinvest
to the ``cost basis'' of the shares they own.
   But whatever tax savings this might bring them can't be realized
until they eventually sell their fund shares. It may never produce
any benefit at all if, for instance, they still own the fund
investment when they die, and it passes to their heirs.
   In any case, should you wish to plan a fund purchase around a
distribution, you need to know when a given fund intends to set its
record date and about how much it expects to pay out. This
information is easier to get in advance from some funds than from
others.
   ``Try calling your fund, or watching closely for such an
announcement in the mail or at least in the mutual fund listing in
your newspaper,'' Donoghue's advises. ``And do it all in the name
of responsible tax planning.''

<TEXT>
   Black Africa's only
international school for electrical engineers is turning out 20 a
year and the World Bank calls it ``an undoubted success.''
   The engineers would seem essential to development on a continent
where insufficient, unreliable electric power hinders industrial
expansion. Yet the school, whose facilities include the latest
electronic gear and a high-tension laboratory, may be forced to
close.
   Africa is in economic decline and the national utilities that
own the college have been forced to reduce the number of students
they send to it. That raises the cost of operation and causes
further reductions in enrollment.
   A World Bank report said the Interafrican Electrical Engineering
College is ``an undoubted success in that it produces a high
quality, immediately useful graduate.''
   It nestles among groves of oil palms in Bingerville, the old
colonial capital of this former French possession. The school was
designed for 250 students, but now has only 103.
   The electric utilities of 20 member countries founded the
college in 1979. The government provided land next to its national
training facility for electricians in Bingerville, six miles east
of Abidjan, the modern capital.
   Issiaka B. Ly, a Malian who has been at the school since it
opened, recalled: ``I was regularly visited by snakes in the
dormitory. I had a whole floor to myself.''
   Ly, in charge of language studies, said one goal of the school
was to help African utilities work together and eventually link up
in power grids. Language instruction is a priority so graduates
will be bilingual in French and English, the two main international
languages spoken in member countries.
   Students begin the five-year program with seven hours of study a
day in either French or English for five weeks.
   Students follow the traditional curriculum of subjects pursued
by electrical engineers in the developed world, but also must study
management, including how to run a business.
   A chief weakness of African utilities has been their failure to
collect bills and control expenses.
   Bingerville students also have to dig ditches and climb utility
poles. They spend summers working for member utilities.
   After graduating, an engineer must spend 10 years with the
sponsoring national utility.
   Nathalie Kouassie, 22, of Adzope, Ivory Coast, said: ``It is our
duty to work for our country because they paid for our education,''
   Fellow fifth-year student Alain Kouma, 25, of Franceville,
Gabon, said manual labor is a useful part of the training because
``it is necessary to know the difficulties people face. We must be
able to do it.''
   Cooperative programs with universities and electrical utilities
in Europe assure that the university's graduates meet international
standards.
   Even with the school established, however, member utilities that
own it often prefer to send students overseas, said Francois Acho
Achiepi, the college's director.
   ``African leaders are used to sending students overseas,'' he
said. ``It's almost psychological.''
   Achiepi conceded it costs up to 25 percent more to send a
student to his school, butadded: ``We pay everything here, from
medical care to clothes to pocket money. All the student has to do
is go to class.''
   Colleges in developed countries do not pay those costs, and he
said the Bingerville school is competitive if they are counted.
   Emergency aid from foreign donors helped the school get through
this year, but more help will be needed in 1991. Two-thirds of the
operating budget comes from the utilities that own it.
   Declining enrollments have meant less aid from the owners, and
the World Bank report says the school responded by cutting costs.
   Basic facilities must be maintained, including an adequate
teaching staff, whatever the number of students, but only greater
enrollment can reduce the cost per student.
   The World Bank and other donors have suggested the school earn
extra money by using its facilities for adult education programs.

   Prime minister Toshiki Kaifu sits at the world's
summits, but the pinnacle of Japanese political power is occupied
by the man who got him the job.
   Shin Kanemaru, the sleepy-faced kingmaker, has spent 32 years in
Parliament as the representative of Yamanashi prefecture just
outside Tokyo, where Mount Fuji rises majestically.
   He arranged the sudden rise of Kaifu as prime minister last
year, when virtually all the more powerful and better-known
candidates were tainted by scandal.
   Kanemaru also is expected to play a key role in determining how
long Kaifu, whose popularity ratings are dropping, stays in office.
   When not managing politics at home, Kanemaru often can be found
flying around Asia on one of his controversial, but sometimes
effective, personal diplomatic jaunts.
   Kim Il Sung, the North Korean dictator, gave Kanemaru a warm
welcome in Pyongyang last month and talks soon began between the
two nations on establishing diplomatic relations.
   The mission to Pyongyang also prompted criticism of his
judgment, when Kanemaru promised North Korea compensation not only
for 36 years of Japanese colonial rule, but for losses in the
ensuing 45 years.
   When he proposed recently that Japan accept the return of only
two of four Soviet-held islands it claims, the stunned Foreign
Ministry declared quickly that it was only a personal opinion. The
islands are a delicate issue that has revented real improvement of
Soviet-Japanese relations since World War II.
   Despite the flaps, Kanemaru's position remains largely intact.
Among those who often consult with him is Michael Armacost, the
U.S. ambassador. Armacost met with Kanemaru after the North Korean
trip and a previous visit to China.
   ``Kanemaru is the creature of Japan's politics, which puts
extremely heavy emphasis on personal networks,'' said Takeshi
Sasaki, a political science professor at Tokyo University. ``I
think analyzing the secret of his influence will bring to light the
enigma of Japanese politics.''
   Little was heard of Kanemaru until he was chosen to lead the
largest of five factions of Parliament members from the Liberal
Democratic Party, which has governed Japan since its formation in
1955.
   His group includes 107 of the 395 Liberal Democratic members.
The factions, called habatsus, are the most important unit of
political power in Japan.
   Habatsus are not designed to promote particular policies or
ideologies, but to raise campaign funds and propel members to high
government office. Lawmakers are devoted to their faction leaders,
who share out cash for elections.
   Negotiations among the factions determine who will be prime
minister and serve in the Cabinet. Leaders of the most powerful
factions usually take turns as prime minister.
   An apparent willingness not to hold top government jobs enhances
Kanemaru's power. The highest level he reached was deputy prime
minister, a largely ceremonial position.
   ``One of the secrets of his power is that he never tries to
obtain official posts, such as prime minister or House speaker, to
make his influence visible,'' said Keiichiro Nakamura, a political
analyst who advised former Prime Minister Takeo Miki. ``It leaves
him free of political enemies.''
   ``Instead of asking other party elders to support his
leadership, Kanemaru knows that it is better to wait for others to
come to him. That gives him a considerable edge over other faction
leaders, most of whom have strong aspirations to become prime
minister one day.''
   Analysts who follow Kanemaru closely say he does not appear to
have any guiding vision of the future for Japan. His public image
is that of an old-school, money-tainted politician primarily
concerned with pork-barrel politics and amassing power.
   Kanemaru's office refused repeated requests for an interview.
   Two years ago, when scores of senior lawmakers were implicated
in a stock scandal, Kanemaru began to emerge clearly as Japan's
political kingmaker.
   The scandal forced Kanemaru's mentor, Noboru Takeshita, to
resign as prime minister and sidelined most candidates for the
succession.
   Last year, Kanemaru engineered the choice of Kaifu, a former
education minister who belongs to one of the smaller factions and
has virtually no power base of his own.
   Political analysts say Kanemaru's extensive personal network
includes opposition party leaders, business executives and elite
bureaucrats.
   ``There must be at least 10 top opposition party officials who
would be willing to comply with my request on the strength of a
single phone call,'' Kanemaru once boasted.
   His wife, Etsuko, often describes his personality as childlike
and once said she believed this ``allows him to say many
controversial things and get away with it.''
   A political ally, senior lawmaker Toshio Yamaguchi, said
Kanemaru gets away with it because he holds no high official post
to lose.

<HEAD>Religious Influence Makes Prisoners Better When Freed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Prisoners who come under religious influence while they're
behind the walls do better once they're back on the outside and in
society than those who lack the religious influence, researchers
say.
   The findings of the first-of-its-kind study on the
rehabilitative effect of religion on prisoners could have wide
implications for the prison system, although more study is needed,
the researchers say.
   ``The results are phenomenal,'' said John Gartner of Baltimore,
a clinical psychologist who headed the five-member research team.
``There haven't been any findings of effectiveness that were this
strong.''
   It was found that prisoners who received religious instruction
while in prison had a lower rate of recidivism - return to crime -
after being freed than did those who had no such instruction.
   Results show that religion ``may be a powerful, and until now
neglected, method of rehabilitation,'' the report says, adding that
the previous scant clues about it make the results very
encouraging.
   The study was commissioned by Prison Fellowship of Washington,
which was founded by ex-Watergate prisoner Charles ``Chuck'' Colson
and now runs far-flung programs for prisoners in about 550 state
and federal prisons.
   Colson, a hard-working advocate of reform of the overcrowded and
high-cost prison system, said the findings were highly important to
making the system work better.
   ``What the study does is to show, by objective and scientific
means, that prison ministry brings about lasting change in
individuals,'' he said.
   Combined with that finding, a review of other studies of
recidivism found that few included even surface religious
variables, making any previous findings in that category
inconclusive, the researchers said.
   ``Researchers usually ignore religion,'' Gartner said in an
interview. ``They look at all aspects of persons, but religion is a
gap. It's a blind spot in the social sciences, not even consistent
with the spirit of science.''
   Considering the extent of prison ministries, the report said,
``it is ironic that religious factors have been largely ignored''
in studies on factors that might affect a prisoner's chances for
successful rehabilitation.
   While results of the new study were positive, Gartner stressed
that his team's report adds: ``It is important to remember that
research conclusions are not determined by one particular study.
This is especially so when a new area of research is opening up ..
.''
   The group's study involved 190 prisoners who between 1975 and
1979 had taken part in Christian discipleship training, and a
similar number who had not, matched by age, race, gender and other
factors.
   Both groups had been released from prison eight to 14 years
prior to the study.
   It found that the religion-trained ones had an 11 percentage
point lower recidivism rate than the control group. Forty percent
of the religion-schooled group committed new offenses, while 51
percent of the others did so.
   The religiously trained group also had a longer crime-free
period following release, and when they did commit new crimes, the
crimes were less severe compared to past offenses. The control
group had increased crime-severity.
   The recidivisim rate for women who took religious training was
even lower, only 19 percent, compared to 47 percent among the
control group of women.
   Among men only, the differential was only seven points.
   Burt Rosen, director of research and development for Prison
Fellowship, said the greatest surprise was that women religious
participants showed a recidivism drop four times greater than the
men.
   He said the small number of women involved may have skewed the
results somewhat, but that women generally are more religious and
the findings suggest they may be more amenable to religious
rehabilitation programs.
   Blacks involved in the study showed religious participation had
little impact on them, but Rosen said this may be because the
program in those early years had not developed ``cross-cultural
sensitivity,'' but now has done so.
   The study report says the findings indicate that Prison
Fellowship ``is indeed fulfilling its mission statement by helping
a significant number of prisoners become productive members of
society.''
   The study is the first part of a three-year project, a second
phase of which is now going on among prisoners in New York state,
including expanded, detailed scrutiny of the effect of religion on
recidivism.
   Findings of the first study demonstrate that the ``potentially
beneficial relationship between religious invovlement and criminal
rehabilitation ... is an underresearched relationship'' in need of
further study, the report says.
   Only one previous study was turned up that dealt directly with
the possible impact of religion on prisoners, and that focused on
Transcendental Meditation, which is considered by many to be more a
relaxation technique than a religion.
   The few other studies that touched on religion noted only
denominational variables, thus leaving the field unexplored.
   ``No one before had ever looked at the effect of religion on
recidivism,'' Gartner said. ``I find that quite amazing.''

<HEAD>Freeport Uses Shopping Outlets To Weather Recession</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM C. HIDLAY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FREEPORT, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Once a shoe-factory town with vacant
storefronts, this village has become a veritable shopping nirvana.
   Though it has only 7,500 residents, Freeport boasts 110 outlet
stores - 65 in a seven-block area of downtown alone - including
such well-known names as L.L. Bean, Dansk and J. Crew.
   Freeport's unusual range of stores has enabled it to weather the
recession better than most other towns in Maine and other New
England states, business and government officials say.
   ``It's the Disney World of shopping right here,'' sai  J'clyn
McLennan, manager of the Mikasa outlet store. ``I haven't felt the
hurt of the economy. I've heard a lot about it, but I haven't felt
it or seen it.''
   But the retailing success has come at a price.
   Some longtime residents complain the town is so clogged with
traffic it can take a half-hour to drive from one end to the other.
And they say the outlet stores cater to tourists and don't carry
the products - such as groceries - needed for daily living.
   ``I think it stinks,'' said Betty Wentworth, 69, who has lived
in Freeport since 1952. ``They've got a lot of stores, but retired
people or people of an average income can't afford to shop there.''
   As Mrs. Wentworth talked in her kitchen on a recent fall day,
Kathleen Brodie of Northboro, Mass., hunted for bargains a
half-mile away in downtown Freeport.
   ``I'm on my way home from Canada,'' she said. ``I made an effort
to leave Canada early so I'd have time to come by here.''
   Brodie, who treks to Freeport about four times a year, said many
of the town's outlets sell merchandise at prices at least 25
percent lower than similar stores in Boston.
   A block away, Meg and Kate Schwartz, sisters from Brielle, N.J.,
marveled at Freeport's array of stores. ``The stores don't look
like outlet warehouses - they look like regular stores,'' said Meg,
21. ``It's a nice atmosphere and a pretty town.''
   The town has capitalized on two retailing trends: the popularity
of outlet shopping and the American pastime of shopping as
recreation, said Beth Gleason, executive director of the Freeport
Merchants Association.
   ``The American people are becoming savvier consumers looking for
the best bargain,'' Gleason said. ``The other thing is that
shopping has become a family event that replaces other forms of
recreation.
   ``That's why Freeport has been such a success,'' she said. ``We
also have L.L. Bean, which is unique in the world.''
   The company's namesake, L.L. Bean, began selling hunting shoes
by mail in 1912. He later added other clothing for hunting, such as
wool shirts and socks.
   ``As people started receiving the catalog, they decided they
wanted to stop in here in Freeport,'' said company spokesman Kilton
Andrew. ``There wasn't any store there. People would just meet them
at the door and take them to the areas where they stocked the
merchandise and sell them what they wanted.
   ``Then people started showing up in the middle of the night and
they literally rousted L.L. out of bed,'' he said.
   So in the 1930s, Bean set aside space for a retail store and
kept it open round-the-clock every day of the year. After Bean's
death in 1967 at age 94, his grandson, Leon A. Gorman, expanded the
business, taking its appeal beyond hunters and fishermen to
outdoors enthusiasts of all types.
   But as Bean's business grew, Freeport's economic heart - shoe
manufacturing - began to slump, in the early 1980s.
   Town Manager Dale Olmstead recalls that when he first moved to
Freeport in 1982, ``the downtown was quite rundown.''
   Things began looking up in the summer of 1982 when Dansk opened
the first name-brand outlet in downtown Freeport.
   ``Apparently,'' Andrew said, ``the wizards of the `where do you
put stores' business decided this was a happening place and, boom,
look what happened. As the '80s heated up, business in Freeport
just grew and grew. Freeport has achieved critical mass as a
shopping destination.''
   Word of Freeport's shopping attractions quickly spread along the
tour bus and tourist circuit.
   When promoting Maine, Gleason said, tourism officials will
``sell lobsters, the beautiful rocky coast of Maine and they'll
sell L.L. Bean.''
   ``Bus tours, if they can fit it in their itinerary, will always
stop in Freeport,'' she said. ``I've seen as many as 16 to 30 buses
in here on a busy day.''
   ``I think we've weathered (the recession) better than other
communities,'' said Olmstead, the town manager.
   Mrs. Wentworth and her husband ran a dry cleaning service on
Main Street from 1953 until they sold their building in 1984 at the
start of the outlet boom.
   Paul Wentworth acknowledges the couple made a tidy profit on the
sale, but still laments what the outlet boom has done to life in
Freeport.
   ``They don't sell the products you need for everyday life since
this commercial explosion started,'' he said.
   Like other Freeport residents, the Wentworths must drive eight
miles north to Brunswick or five miles south to Yarmouth to shop in
a supermarket.
   The couple lives a half-mile from the center of town, but say
it's easier to walk downtown than drive because of the traffic
congestion.

<HEAD>How a Midseason Replacement Show Was Developed - Almost</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE>
<TEXT>
   No rational person would believe that these
internal memoranda, putatively from a major television production
house, are anything but the product of a disturbed imagination. Let
the skeptic laugh. Truth is always stranger than fiction; it's just
not as well-written. You read it here first.

<TEXT>
   From: Mikey
   To: Moey
   Re: Midseason.
   Sit down. Are you sitting down? Sit down. I'm so excited. Why? I
have an idea plus a concept for the midseason replacement. More: I
have finished the treatment for THE concept for TV in the '90s. I'm
talking about a series with more than just that ``Twin Peaks-Rescue
911-thirtysomething'' feel. This is actually ABOUT something.
   I'm sending over the treatment and pilot episode for ``Where's
Harry'' because I know it'll set you on fire (pardon the pun, as
you'll see from the script).
   It's the hour-long adventures of Harry Unman, a handsome,
clever, witty serial killer who's embraced a nomadic lifestyle
while struggling to cope with his problem. We're talking
``dramedy'' with a vengeance: Violent, slapstick death. Incredible
tension. Irony. An audience torn between wanting him to get caught
and wanting him to get away with it. We'll have celebrity guests
lining up to get knocked off. A status thing.
   And we don't have to show, you know, every SINGLE murder. We can
use a cute little sound effect, like the ``Bong!'' of the frying
pan they used in the movie ``Eating Raoul.'' Maybe we can have
Harry use a cute murder weapon. We're working on it.
   Harry speaks to something in all of us. I mean, this is a guy
who has problems in his relationships, as all of us do. The
difference with Harry is that he can't have them. Relationships, I
mean. He blows into town, gets a job pumping gas or slinging hash
and tries to get his life in order.
   But that lunar killing cycle kicks in and Harry's back behind
the wheel of that '69 Plymouth Roadrunner with something cold and
sticky in the trunk. The horror! The tension! The ratings.
   He's a Romantic hero - attractive and dangerous. If Harry asks
you out on a date, you'll remember it for the rest of your life
because you go home in the trunk, wrapped in 100 pounds of chain.
   The great thing is, it's not a ripoff of some other concept.
It's kind of a cross between ``Route 66'' and ``The Fugitive.'' And
I save the best for last:
   I think we can get Tom Selleck to do it.
   ---
   From: Moey
   To: Mikey
   Re: Midseason
   Get Selleck.
   I spoke to my guy at the network and they are, believe me, hot
to the point of white-hot for us to go forward on ``Where's
Harry.'' In fact, he says, ``Harry-Shmarry, we WORK for this guy!
Just kidding.'' You know how scared they are. All I had to do was
whisper, ``women 18 to 49,'' ``key demographics'' and ``a 30 rating
and a 21 share.'' Then their piggy little eyes lit up. They're
desperate for anything that'll bring in even a piece of the
audience. My guy is running it through their legal people and
Standards &amp; Practices.
   Get Selleck.
   ---
   From: Mikey
   To: Moey
   Re: Midseason.
   We can't get Selleck. He has a movie deal with Lord Run Run
Shaw's people. How about Johnny Depp? Anybody who can fit ``21 Jump
Street'' and John Waters' ``Cry Baby'' into the same career could
handle a serial killer. We can get Johnny Depp.
   ---
   From: Moe
   To: Mike
   Re: Where's Harry
   Get Johnny Depp. Meanwhile, we have some problems. I had my guy
run the treatment through network Standards &amp; Practices before they
shut down the department. No problem, they said. Then he ran it
past their legal people. Problem.
   They're worried about the serial killer angle. Mostly their
concern is over how Harry ``does'' his victims. They say if we
happen to match the wrong set of circumstances - method, motive and
opportunity - we'll have nuisance lawsuits from every serial killer
working on a book deal in North America.
   Here's a suggestion from the network people. Instead of being a
serial killer, can we make him gay? It would be basically the same
deal - minus the murdering and the shallow graves - a handsome,
troubled guy who goes around doing good deeds and trying to
overcome his, you know, his ``gayness.'' Or something like that.
   Problem is, if we do it that way, then we probably couldn't get
Johnny Depp.
   ---
   From: Michael
   To: Maurice
   Re: Harry
   Moe, you can't be serious. Television is ready for a serial
killer, not a homosexual. Violent, senseless death is OK;
``alternative lifestyles'' are still a no-no. Remember what
happened with ``Sidney.''
   Anyway, it turns out we can't get Johnny Depp.
   ---
   From: Moey
   To: Mikey
   Re: WH project
   Hey, Mikey, I never liked Johnny Depp for the part anyway. And
anyway, are we sure that it has to be ``Where's Harry''?
   I mean, are we married to the idea of a MALE serial killer?
Brace yourself for some great news.
   Valerie Harper's people say she is - and this is a direct quote
- ``very interested'' in doing a ``Where's Rhoda'' approach!
   Hold on, just think about it. Imagine - a female serial killer
who has a weight problem and a domineering Mom: ``Gee, Ma, one
phone call with you and I just want to go out and kill somebody.''
(laughter)
   We're checking with Nancy Walker's people, too. They sound very
excited.
   Please run this past your creative team and get back to me.
   ---
   From: Moey
   To: Mikey
   Re: Where's Rhoda
   At last. I think we've got a concept here that can really take
off. I knew that you of all people could develop a series that you
believed in. It's no wonder you've been a success in this business
for 30 years, with something new and different every year.
   You'll probably want Mark to executive produce it. He's very
comfortable with the format.

<HEAD>Sanctions at Heart of Gulf War Question for Many</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   More than two dozen countries dispatched troops to the Middle
East after Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait. The troops' first aim was
to block a possible assault on Saudi Arabia. But now many wonder
whether the U.S.-led coalition should strike first - and if so,
when and under what circumstances.
   The Associated Press put that question to eight people,
including a Vietnam veteran, the wife of a hostage and two former
Defense Department officials. Here are their answers:

<TEXT>
   They certainly shouldn't wait any longer. And I think that the
object of the attack should be to remove Saddam Hussein from
control and neutralize his ability to use weapons of mass
destruction. ...
   With each passing day, the likely costs and degree of difficulty
of an attack increase. That's because Saddam Hussein is trying to
make his forces more resilient, feverishly trying to bring to bear
more capable weapons systems. If this crisis should result in a
perpetuation of his power, we'll see those costs increase
exponentially because then he will have weapons far more dangerous
than those currently available to him.
   Meanwhile, it's unclear how long it will take before the
sanctions even get his attention. Saddam Hussein is nothing if not
indifferent to the condition of his people.
   In short, I think it's reasonably clear that neither the Iraqi
people nor the military are going to be sufficiently affected by
the sanctions between now and the closing of what's called the
``window of opportunity'' for an attack, namely the end of March or
so. ...
   Time is not on our side. Saddam Hussein is playing a waiting
game and thinks he can succeed at it.

   I think the best way to proceed is to try to negotiate a
settlement. The first issue that brought us there was the invasion
of Kuwait, and that's the primary issue. The primary issue is, as
far as I'm concerned, negotiable in terms of the withdrawal of
Iraqi forces.
   The escalation has come since we started talking about an
offensive straight through into Iraq. I'm not sure I understand the
reason for that except Saddam Hussein is a, quote, ``madman'' and
in four years they'll have the power to construct a nuclear bomb. I
don't necessarily get the connection between those two facts and an
incredible amount of blood shed by poor boys from Boston,
Dorchester and Roxbury.
   As someone who works with veterans, I see that right now the VA
is unable to handle the problems of an aging veteran population or
the problems of the Vietnam generation of veterans, issues of Agent
Orange and post-traumatic stress disorder. And many of the states
who are sending these National Guard units are closing their
programs for veterans.
   In Massachusetts, you have the case where they're discussing
closing the soldiers' homes and the outreach centers for
Vietnam-generation veterans. Here we're sending these guys off to
war and at the same time we're cutting back all the support systems
for people who have gone through our previous wars. That kind of
inconsistency is something that carries throughout the whole policy
and what we're doing in the Persian Gulf.

   I want to know what gives our president the power to decide that
on a certain date we're going to start a war. What gives him the
power in the month of November to say that in January we're going

   I think it's a horrifying thing to be doing. What frightens me
is that the decision is in the hands of people who are not actively
involved. In all of Congress, there are only two people who have a
family member in Saudi Arabia.
   (U.S. troops) went to Saudi Arabia to prevent an attack ... but
(now) President Bush is leading the pack into war.
   Everything is being drummed up to keep the flames of war
brightly lit. First we heard about the oil ... then we heard about
Saddam being an evil aggressor ... and now we're hearing about his
possible atomic capabilities.
   We should be over there in a defensive mode and, at this time,
nothing more. It should not be an American military offensive as a
presidential option but as an act of Congress, and the people
Congress is supposed to represent.

   We ought to give the sanctions time to work and we should only

know we are there until hell freezes over. In six months, his
aircraft will run out of spare parts and there will be other parts
shortages as well. So what if it takes us a year or two or three?
It took us 40 years to win the Cold War. ... I don't even think we
should be beefing up our force there. I'd probably get the
deployment down to 150,000 - 200,000 maximum in the area and
announce a rotation policy for the troops. ...
   If there were a provocation and you did have a war, I would bomb
his military facilities, the chemicals, the nuclear and his
munitions factories. I'd cut off his supply lines and I might pick
out one of his divisions in Kuwait and bomb the hell out of it too
and then say, ``OK, now get out or we'll bomb another division, and
then another.''

   A solution through negotiations should get top priority. The
solution should be one that not only solves the problem of Iraq,
but also brings about future stability in the Middle East. An
attack should be avoided as much as possible, and there is no need
for one now. But taking military action may become necessary if
there is any inhumane treatment of the hostages, such as depriving
them of food or executing them. ... Military action should not be

   The dilemma of the United States is to know whether one can
punish aggression without resorting to war. The blockade and the
diplomatic isolation were meant precisely to fulfill that role. It
doesn't seem to be working. The worst thing would be to leave
aggression unpunished at a time when the international system is in
a period of transition and is setting new rules. It would be tragic
if the example of a state that redraws by force new boundaries by
annexing a country was left unpunished.
   The international system makes punishment of aggression an
absolute necessity. But the regional environment makes the prospect
of war very bloody and unsettling.
   If all political pressures are used and fail, leaving the Iraqis
in Kuwait, that would be the worst scenario, even worse than war
itself. I'm not trigger-happy, but I think war may be necessary. It
is a matter of months, and in my mind should come before Ramadan
(in mid-March).

<HEAD>Farm Outlook Fairly Bright, If It Rains - But Not Too Much</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Forecasters in the Agriculture Department
think 1991 will be a pretty good year for American farmers, with
larger production and, with some exceptions, fairly steady prices.
   But as all economists know, when it comes to predicting
agricultural production and farm income, the weather is most
important.
   A year ago, for example, consumer food prices were expected to
rise 3 percent to 5 percent in 1990. But hard freezes in December
and other weather-related factors helped push prices up an average
of nearly 6 percent.
   Looking at 1991, last week's annual USDA outlook conference was
told that food prices probably will gain 2 percent to 5 percent.
   Predictions also are clouded by uncertainties on the nation's
general economic outlook, the possibility of war in the Persian
Gulf and what that might do to world oil supplies and prices.
   However, no USDA forecast is carved in granite, and the
professionals in the department's Economic Research Service are
quick to revise projections when conditions change significantly.
   James R. Donald, chairman of the department's World Agricultural
Outlook Board, said the current situation points to ``a year of
near-record incomes for U.S. farmers'' as larger production - and
higher prices for a few commodities - put muscle into the 1991 farm
economy.
   New farm legislation signed into law by President Bush last week
will help boost plantings of some crops as farmers take advantage
of new flexibility provisions in the program, he said.
   The net cash income of farmers nationally in 1991 was projected
at $55 billion to $60 billion, compared to the record this year of
$59 billion. That's money left over from gross cash receipts after
paying cash expenses.
   Some of the commodity highlights as outlined by Donald and other
USDA forecasters:
   Wheat - U.S. wheat production in 1991 probably will decline
substantially because of weak prices, higher acreage-reduction
requirements in the federal program, and reduced payments allowed
under the new farm law.
   Relatively low world prices could also result in smaller foreign
production, although this could be limited by a lack of better
alternative crops.
   Rice - Given normal weather, global rice production should
expand next year, forcing prices down further. The government's
marketing loan program, which is keyed to world prices, should keep
U.S. rice competitive.
   Feed Grains - World trade in corn and other so-called coarse
grains will slip from the relatively high level of 1989-90. Smaller
imports by the Soviet Union, Mexico, Japan and several smaller
users are expected to bring a 10 percent reduction in world coarse
grain trade. U.S. exports, led by corn, are forecast to drop by
more than 15 percent.
   U.S. corn production probably will increase in 1991, assuming
yields remain on track.
   Soybeans - World soybean production may decline slightly in
1990-91, with reductions in both the United States and South
America.
   Domestically, soybean supplies are expected to exceed total use
in 1990-91, leading to a further buildup in inventories at the end
of the season. Prices probably will average near 1989-90 levels as
stocks build.
   Additionally, prospective larger plantings in 1991 may ``act to
restrain prices'' later in the year.
   Cotton - There will be ``a continuing close balance'' between
global cotton production and consumption, with leftover inventories
at the end of 1990-91 at the lowest level in a decade.
   The U.S. situation for 1990-91 indicates relatively strong
demand and extremely tight stocks. The early season outlook for
next season points to larger production and a rebuilding of
stockpiles in 1991-92.
   Looking at livestock and poultry, analysts said the world output
of animal products probably will increase by slightly more than 2
percent in 1991, following a rise of less than 1 percent in 1990.
   ``Total meat production in the United States in 1991 is expected
to increase over 3 percent from this year's record large output,''
Donald told the conference. Increases in beef, pork and broilers
are expected.
   The U.S. cattle inventory last Jan. 1 was 99.3 million head, up
only 0.2 percent from the Jan. 1, 1989 level, he said. A small
increase in the 1991 inventory is probable.
   ``Pork production is down about 3 percent this year, and an
increase of about 3 percent is anticipated for 1991,'' he said.
``Producers have had good returns for over a year, and the response
to these returns shows more restraint than in the past.''
   Broiler production is gaining about 6 percent this year, and
prices have slumped from the relatively high levels of 1989.
Production is expected to increase again in 1991 but at a slightly
slower pace.
   Dairy farmers have boosted milk production, and further gains
are expected in 1991, Donald said. Milk prices will be down from a
year earlier.

   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland said Tuesday he approved
the emergency request in part because of government statements that

   NEW YORK (AP) - Baseball owners are doing better than ever,
increasing their operating profits by 75 percent in 1989 to a
record $214.5 million, according to financial figures obtained by
The Associated Press.
   The 26 teams took in a record $1.241 billion in 1989, a 23
percent increase from the previous season. They had a pre-tax
operating profit of $214.5 million, for an average of $8.3 million

   The previous record profit of $121.6 million was set in 1988 on
earnings of just more than $1 billion, baseball's first

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Three out of four of the nation's top business
economists believe the United States has skidded into a recession,
in part because of the rapid rise in oil prices following the Iraqi
invasion of Kuwait.
   ``Recession is here,'' the National Association of Business
Economists said Tuesday in a report on its canvass of 51
professional forecasters. The report reflects a sharp jump in
pessimism among the economists.
   Adding to the grim picture, the Soviet Union and its former
allies are likely to face the hardest winter since World War II as
recession, compounded by rising oil prices, continues to deepen,
U.N. economists said.

   Toyota's decision to nearly double U.S.
production of Camry cars and increase the amount of American-made
parts it uses makes good political and financial sense, analysts
say.
   Toyota announced Tuesday it will spend $800 million to boost its
production of Camry models in Scott County, Ky., and add 1,500
jobs.
   Company officials also said the ``domestic content'' of the
Camrys is now at 65 percent and will meet the goal of 75 percent by
1991.
   ``It's in their interest as well as our interest,'' said Charles
Brady, an auto industry analyst with Oppenheimer &amp; Co. in New York.
He said the company decreases its exposure to the volatile foreign
exchange market by building cars in the country where they are
sold.
   Also Toyota has found it is cheaper to build cars here than ship
them from Japan, said David Healy, an analyst with Barclays de
Zoete Wedd in New York.
   ``There's certainly nothing politically wrong with that
either,'' Healy said.
   Toyota expects to build 217,000 Camry models in Scott County
this year. The expansion will have the capacity to produce another
200,000. The company already has 3,450 workers and an investment of
$1.2 billion in the Camry assembly and engine production
operations.
   The expansion is an indication of the strong American appetite
for Toyota cars and furthers the company's desire to grab an even
larger chunk of the U.S. market, said Bob McCurry, executive vice
president for sales in North America.
   U.S. sales of Toyota cars and light trucks in 1990 numbered 1.19
million through Oct. 31, up 31 percent from the same period last
year, industry figures show. The company's goal is to increase
sales to 1.5 million annually by the middle of the decade.
   By comparison, the Big Three U.S. automakers - General Motors
Corp.  Ford Motor Co., and Chrysler Corp. - sold 8.3 million cars
and light trucks through Oct. 31, a 6.9 percent drop.
   The increasing American content of Toyota vehicles is reflected
in purchases of U.S. parts and supplies, which were $70 million a
few years ago but should grow to $720 million this year, said Alex
Warren, senior vice president of Toyota Motor Manufacturing USA.
With production capacity doubled, potential purchases of domestic
supplies will increase by a like amount, Warren added.
   Warren said he expects the construction contract for the 3.7
million square-foot addition would go to a U.S. company.
   Toyota's selection of a Japanese general contractor for its
original plant caused some discontent in the construction field as
well as union ill will.
   Toyota will not sell all of the Georgetown Camrys in this
country.
   Fujio Cho, president and chief executive officer of Toyota Motor
Manufacturing, said the company already exports some Camry models
to Taiwan and will soon begin production of right-hand-drive models
for export to Japan. Some 40,000 of those models and up to 100,000
engines produced in Georgetown will be shipped to Japan.
   Keneyoshi Kusunoki, chairman of Toyota's North American
operations, said the company could expand its engine production at
Georgetown if quality and demand remain high.
   Toyota is now using about 500 acres of the 1,300 acres provided
by the state along Interstate 75 just north of Georgetown.
Officials said there will probably be room for further expansion
even after the new Camry line is added.
   Kusunoki said the location of the Scott County plant to
suppliers and markets was an important factor in the decision to
add to the site. He said there were 10 states competing for the
plant, though he declined to identify them.
   Toyota officials were also unanimous in their praise of the work
force in Scott County.
   ``It is truly a tribute to each and every team member that we
have had,'' Warren said.
   Toyota did not seek state incentives for the expansion, a marked
difference from the $135 million package offered to lure the
automaker.
   ``We have gotten all of the support from Kentucky that we
need,'' Warren said. ``Today is the day we're able to give back and
provide a return for that investment.''
   During his 1987 campaign, Gov. Wallace Wilkinson produced a
television commercial claiming the state paid far too much for the
plant and saying the state had become a laughingstock from
``Tennessee to Tokyo.''
   Wilkinson refused Tuesday to say whether he had reconsidered
that opinion.

   Customers bought 14.9 percent more North
American-made cars and light trucks in mid-November than last year,
but an analyst says that isn't a sign of an automotive boom.
   ``They are up over a very weak period last year,'' analyst
Jeannette Garretty of the Bank of America in San Francisco said
Tuesday.
   The 10 major U.S. automakers said they sold an average of 35,646
cars and light trucks a day in the Nov. 11-20 period, up from a
rate of 31,032 a year earlier. Car sales jumped 18 percent and
truck sales were up 10.1 percent.
   General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. reported
a 16.2 percent gain in domestic car sales, while sales of
transplant cars, made in North America by overseas companies,
jumped 29.5 percent.
   But the increases were in comparison with a market that slumped
in October and November 1989 after automakers used heavy incentives
to boost sales and clear out inventories for the 1990 model year.
   Wary of the impact of the slow economy and rising gasoline
prices, auto companies have avoided excess inventories in 1990.
   In the latest production cut, the Big Three ordered shutdowns
that began Monday, idling 38,000 employees at 14 assembly plants in
eight states. The companies blamed slow dealer orders.
   Tom Webb, chief economist for the National Automobile Dealers
Association, said Tuesday's figures showed that economically, ``We
are not poised at the edge of a cliff.''
   ``Traffic was up substantially'' in mid-November at Highland
Chrysler Plymouth in Grand Rapids, sales manager Chuck Stockmar
said.
   Garretty predicted buyers would stay cautious, however.
``Consumer sentiment fell very sharply in October. There's still a
great deal of concern about where the economy is headed and about
where unemployment is headed,'' she said.
   For the year through Nov. 20, car and truck sales by the 10
domestic makers trailed last year's pace by 3.2 percent, with car
sales lagging 3.3 percent and truck sales down 3 percent.
   GM said its combined mid-November car and truck sales were up
14.5 percent, with cars up 16.9 percent and trucks up 10.6 percent.
For the year, GM said car and truck sales lagged 3.6 percent.
   Ford reported car sales up 17.6 percent and truck sales up 14.6
percent for a combined 16.3 percent gain for mid-November. Ford
said car and truck sales for the year were trailing last year's by
7.1 percent.
   Chrysler said its car sales rose 10.8 percent while truck sales
edged up 0.5 percent, an overall 5.4 percent mid-November rise. For
the year, Chrysler reported car and light truck sales trailing by
13.5 percent.

<HEAD>Key Milken Figure To Pay $7.9 Million To Settle SEC Charges</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Civil charges against a key Michael Milken
associate describe widespread lawbreaking, but defense lawyers
criticized the government for airing the case at a time when the
convicted financier has no recourse.
   Former money manager David A. Solomon on Tuesday agreed to pay
$7.9 million to settle Securities and Exchange Commission charges
of insider trading, income tax fraud and other violations directly
involving Milken.
   Some of the claims in the civil complaint were central to the
guilty plea of Milken, the once-powerful Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc. executive who was sentenced last week to 10 years in prison.
   The complaint against Solomon alleges a pattern of fraudulent
activity with Milken, including allegations Milken never was
charged with and others his defense lawyers repeatedly denied.
   Three of the six felony counts to which Milken pleaded guilty
involved Solomon. But Milken did not admit to insider trading, and
U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood ruled that prosecutors failed during
a presentencing hearing for Milken to prove he committed the
violation.
   Michael Armstrong, an attorney for Milken's brother, Lowell, who
was named in connection with two allegations against Solomon,
criticized the government for levying charges when the Milkens
can't respond.
   ``If Solomon had anything to say why didn't the government allow
him to testify in the (presentencing) hearing, where he could have
been cross-examined,'' Armstrong said. ``It's trial by press
release.''
   Through a spokesman, lawyers for Milken declined to comment.
   SEC Assistant Enforcement Director James Coffman said the agency
included ``information we deem necessary in order to make the
complaint understandable. We believe everything we've done is
consistent with all standards of fairness.''
   Solomon was granted immunity from criminal prosecution in
exchange for providing information against Milken. He settled the
SEC charges without admitting or denying guilt.
   Under the settlement, Solomon agreed to return $7.3 million in
alleged illegal profits - $588,870 for insider trading and about
$6.7 million for other violations. The money is to be placed into
two funds to compensate wronged investors. Solomon also must pay
$661,674 in civil insider trading penalties.
   The 46-year-old former head of Solomon Asset Management Inc. was
one of Milken's biggest buyers of risky and often lucrative
high-yield bonds, and the two had a relationship dating to the
early 1970s.
   Solomon agreed to cooperate with prosecutors in October 1989.
His testimony gave the government information that elevated the
case against Milken beyond limited charges leveled by convicted
speculator Ivan Boesky.
   The SEC alleged that Solomon investment advisory clients and
Drexel investment banking clients were defrauded from at least 1983
through 1986.
   The complaint alleges that Solomon personally gained from deals
through confidential information supplied by Milken or other Drexel
employees on transactions in which Drexel was involved.
   SEC Chief Litigation Counsel Thomas Newkirk said the charges
show how ``Drexel and Milken and those who worked with them in
their wrongdoing were scratching each others backs and lining each
others pockets.''
   But individuals close to Milken's defense noted that most of the
charges were not included in the government's presentencing memo
against Milken, which listed numerous additional allegations of
criminal wrongdoing. They minimized the charges, saying the U.S.
Attorney's Office must have considered them too weak to bring
against Milken.
   Among the allegations:
   -Insider trading in the securities of Drexel clients Tiger
International Inc., Lorimar Inc. and Republic Airlines Inc. The SEC
alleged that Milken passed on information about pending deals to
Solomon.
   The Lorimar charge was included in the government's
presentencing memo. The Tiger International and Republic charges
were said to be part of an expanded indictment of Milken made moot
by his decision to plead guilty.
   -Fraud in the 1984 sale of Charter Co. bonds owned by a Solomon
client. The SEC claimed Milken, via Drexel, agreed to purchase the
bonds to help the client avoid losses. Solomon in return agreed to
reimburse Drexel for $250,000 in losses through other transactions,
the SEC claimed.
   -Fraud in a series of transactions by Solomon to pay back
Drexel. The SEC claimed that Solomon took certain concessions from
securities transactions that belonged to investment advisory
clients.
   Solomon also allegedly adjusted the prices of securities bought
from or sold to Drexel to repay his debt to Drexel, making clients
pay more or receive less than they should have.
   -Prearranged transactions with Milken to create phony losses to
help Solomon evade personal income taxes in 1983 and 1985. That
charge was included in the Milken plea.

   Deals like the $6.6 billion Japanese buyout
of MCA Inc. offer alluring advantages: floods of cash and
technology in a perilous world economy filled with giant
competitors.
   But Matsushita Electric Industrial Co.'s purchase Monday of one
of Hollywood's dream factories - the biggest Japanese purchase ever
of a U.S. company - also raises deeply rooted fears.
   Matsushita sought to allay those worries in announcing it
planned no management or strategic changes at the company that owns
Universal Studios, but the fears likely will persist, analysts say.
   ``The acquisition of a factory that makes, let's say, mufflers
is one thing. Acquiring a central player in our cultural domain
tends to raise different kinds of concerns,'' said Michael Radnor,
a business professor who heads the international development
program at Northwestern University.
   Only three of the seven major Hollywood studios remain
domestically owned - Walt Disney Studios, Warner Bros. and
Paramount.
   Radnor pointed out that the United States is far more tolerant
of foreign ownership of cultural treasures than France or many
other countries. Over the years, Australia's News Corp. has
purchased 20th Century Fox; Japan's Sony Corp. bought Columbia; and
Italian-controlled Pathe Communications bought MGM-UA.
   Still, ``there's an argument that we have to be careful who
controls the organs of mass communications,'' Radnor said.
   ``If a guy wants to make a very critical movie of Hirohito, does
it make it tougher now that two of the biggest companies are not in
U.S. hands?'' he asked.
   Perhaps. But Radnor and other observers said they believe the
profit motive will prevail - after all, foreigners are buying
American studios precisely because no other country's entertainment
is so popular worldwide.
   Companies like Sony and Matsushita are unlikely to try to censor
U.S. entertainment, said Barbara Pfeiffer, a senior associate at
Ulmer Bros. investment bank, which specializes in mergers of
American and Japanese companies.
   ``We all grow up with the movies as our best friend. We've been
in front of the TV and that's the baby sitter, and prior to that it
was the darkened movie house and news reels. It's such a
traditional American pastime that it's understandable that there
are fears,'' she said.
   ``But when you get down to it, this is a moneymaking enterprise.
And the old saying is: `If it ain't broke, don't fix it,''  Ms.
Pfeiffer said.
   ``Steven Spielberg will still be making Steven Spielberg films.
He won't be making `Steven Spielberg Goes to Japan.'''
   At a news conference Monday in Japan, Matsushita President Akio
Tanii was asked if he would object to MCA making a
``Japan-bashing'' film or one critical of the late Emperor
Hirohito's role in World War II.
   ``Something like that shouldn't emerge,'' said Tanii, looking
agitated. ``(MCA executives) will have the proper judgment with
regards to the social impact. Filmmakers must create films that are
inspirational, that will be enjoyable for everybody. I can't even
imagine a case like that.''
   David Geffen, whose record company was bought for MCA stock that
brought more than $700on in the Matsushita deal, said those
who worry about Japanese influence on Hollywood are showing
``latent racism.''
   Few people worry about Swiss or British ownership of domestic
companies, he said. Nor are questions raised about whether, say,
Paramount chairman Frank Mancuso would shy away from a movie that
might offend Catholics because of his religion, Geffen said.
   More likely than films being censored, said Ms. Pfeiffer, is
that more movies tailored to foreign audiences, be they British or
Japanese, will be produced in addition to material aimed at
traditional U.S. audiences.
   ``I think we're looking at expansion, not change,'' she said.
   Examples of that are as near as movie theaters showing the film
``Reversal of Fortune'' about the socialite Claus von Bulow who was
accused of trying to kill his wife, Sunny - a topic more morbid
than general studio fare.
   The major U.S. studios turned down the movie when independent
producer Ed Pressman brought it to them. He instead approached
Shochiku Co., a Japanese film distributor that wanted to back
another project of his, the ``cyberpunk' science-fiction movie
called ``New Rose Hotel,'' set in Japan.
   Pressman offered to produce both, Shochiku agreed, and Warner
Bros. is now providing domestic distribution for ``Reversal of
Fortune,'' which is a modest success in limited release this fall.
   ``It shows a breadth of interest in Japanese investment which
would be very healthy (for the film industry),'' Pressman said.
   ``Japan is a longstanding film community with entities that have
been in existence as long as Warner Bros. and MGM, and respect that
goes beyond the bottom line.''
   He noted that Sony's video arm helped finance another unusual
project, the critically acclaimed ``To Sleep With Anger,'' with an
all-black cast starring Danny Glover.
   The long-term investment strategies, plentiful cash and advanced
technology of the Japanese may have the strongest effects on
technical innovations.
   Harley Neuman, a senior manager with the Deloitte &amp; Touche
accounting firm's entertainment group, noted that U.S. companies
have often opposed technologies that prove to be huge money-makers
for them, like VCRs.
   The joint ownership of ``hardware'' and the entertainment
program ``software'' to be displayed on it will hasten the
introduction of new consumer electronics like digital audiotape and
recordable compact discs, he said.
   Why were there no other bidders for a company as successful and
established as MCA?
   Neuman said that while U.S. lending sources have dried up,
financing from Japanese banks is still available for companies as
big and cash heavy as Matsushita.
   ``For that matter, Matsushita could virtually write a check for
$6.5 billion. How many companies in the world could do that?''
Neuman asked.
   And Japanese investors are more willing to tolerate the
hit-this-year, bomb-the-next nature of the entertainment business,
he said.
   ``The U.S. shareholder is looking for results every quarter,''
Neuman said. ``The Japanese are much longer thinkers. As a result,
they're willing to take their lumps in the short term.''
   MCA's movie chief, Tom Pollock, said Matsushita's long-term
attitude is a blessing.
   He said he'll be able to undertake bigger and better projects
now, given the Japanese tendency to invest for the long term.
   ``To not have to worry about what's happening this quarter is a
great luxury,'' he said.

<HEAD>McDonald's Moves Part of Ad Account</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   McDonald's Corp. is shifting part of its mammoth
advertising account from Leo Burnett Co. to DDB Needham, which
handled the fast-food giant's national account until 1981.
   McDonald's, in the midst of a sales slowdown in the United
States, said Tuesday that Needham would handle various promotions
and ads for young adults, teens and pre-teens.
   About one-sixth of the Burnett account was re-assigned to
Needham, a New York-based Omnicom Group agency, McDonald's said.
Industry experts said that could mean as much as $55 million in new
ad billings for Needham.
   McDonald's national ad account, estimated at $300 million, has
most recently been handled entirely by Burnett.
   The Oak Brook-based McDonald's said it was making the move
because of ``the growth of our business over the years as well as
the increasing demands and workload.''
   ``It's a matter of work load,'' said Chuck Rubner, a spokesman
for McDonald's. ``The account has really grown over the last 10
years.''
   Burnett has created McDonald's ``Good Times, Great Taste'' and
``Food, Folks &amp; Fun'' campaigns.
   Burnett chairman Hall Adams said the loss was an ``occupational
hazard'' but added, ``We don't like losing any assignment.''
   Some industry analysts have criticized the Burnett ``Food, Folks
&amp; Fun'' campaign as lacking the punch of earlier campaigns, such as
the ``You Deserve a Break Today'' campaign devised by Needham
nearly 20 years ago.
   Since losing the national account in 1981, Needham had served as
a local agency for McDonald's in several U.S. cities.

   Nearly half of Japan's hard-working salaried
employees are afraid their jobs will drive them to early deaths, a
survey reported today found.
   The Fukoku Life Insurance Co. conducted the survey in October
among 500 employees with more than 15 years at the same companies
in metropolitan Tokyo.
   Its results indicated that the fabled workaholicism of Japanese
white-collar employees takes its toll: Many dread and fear their
jobs.
   ``These people with no interest in their job and relationship
seem to drag themselves to work every day,'' the survey researchers
concluded.
   The poll revealed a strong fear of ``karoshi'' - death from
overwork. Researchers have said the number of such deaths among
married Japanese businessmen is growing at an alarming rate.
   Dr. Kiyoyasu Arikawa, who advises executives how to reduce their
risk, said the number of karoshi grew from 10 in 1969 to about 150
in 1987.
   The Labor Ministry received 777 applications for compensation
because of ``sudden death'' at work, up from about 500 requests
three years ago. Researchers believe many such cases are actually
karoshi.
   About 70 percent of the respondents in the survey said they feel
``stressed,'' 44.4 percent ``feel constant fatigue,'' 28 percent
have ``no creativity and motivation,'' and 23.3 percent feel ``a
frequent desire to call in sick.''
   Asked whether they feared death by overwork, 42.8 percent said
yes.
   Fierce competition among employees as well as a strong sense of
responsibility to their companies lead many workers to stay at the
office well into the night and refuse to take all their vacation
time.
   Nearly two-thirds of respondents to the survey take less than 10
days of vacation a year.
   Although Japanese employees are said to have a strong sense of
company loyalty, three out of 10 respondents said 15 years with the
same firm was a ``long'' time.
   More than 60 percent said they have no excitement or incentives
on the job, and another 56.6 percent said their relationship with
their bosses and colleagues was bothersome.
   To ease work-related fatigue, 85.3 percent of respondents said
they ``just want to sleep more.''
   The poll did not give a margin of error. Japanese pollsters do
not calculate such margins, claiming that publication of a precise
margin of error might mislead readers into thinking a poll is more
accurate than it really is.

   Stock prices turned mixed in early trading today
after the government reported that third quarter economic growth
was slightly slower than previously thought.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks rose 2.48 to
2,546.29 in the first half hour of trading on Wall Street.
   However, decliners slightly outpaced gainers in nationwide
trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 475 down,
468 up and 527 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 19.18 million shares.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was
down 0.05 at 173.82. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was up 0.68 at 297.68.
   The Commerce Department reported that the economy as measured by
the gross national product grew at a 1.7 percent annual rate in the
third quarter, a downward revision from the 1.8 percent first
reported last month.
   The GNP is the nation's total output of goods and services and
its broadest measure of economic activity.
   In another report, the department said orders to U.S. factories
for ``big-ticket'' durable goods rebounded 3.6 percent in October,
driven by a 14.8 percent jump in transportation orders.
   Hildegarde Zagorski, a vice president and stock analyst at
Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., said the market had little
reaction to either report beause they were both generally in line
with expectations.
   ``The market is kind of indecisive right now,'' she said.

   The U.S. economy grew at a 1.7 percent annual
rate in the third quarter, a bit less than previously thought, the
government reported today. And Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan said there had been a ``meaningful downturn'' in the
nation's economic output.
   The Commerce Department said its downward revision in the gross
national product showed the economy advanced even more slowly from
July through September than the 1.8 percent first reported last
month.
   The GNP is the nation's total output of goods and services and
its broadest measure of economic activity.
   Greenspan, who has been cautious in describing the economy, told
Congress the oil shock resulting from the Iraqi occupation of
Kuwait and a credit shortage have brought about further weakness.
   ``All indications are that a meaningful downturn in aggregate
output occurred as we moved through October into November,''
Greenspan told the House Banking Committee.
   The central bank chief said oil prices, which have risen from
$20 a barrel before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2 to $33
now, are cutting into the spending power of both businesses and
consumers.
   Greenspan also said the so-called ``credit crunch,'' which he
first publicly noted in July, ``has proceeded somewhat further.''
He said ``anecdotal information clearly suggests that many types of
businesses are encountering greater difficulty obtaining
financing.''
   Recent surveys of professional economic forecasters show that
most believe the economy has tumbled into a recession - informally
defined as two consecutive declines in the GNP. For many, the
question is when it began.
   Some analysts contend most of the third-quarter growth was
concentrated in the first part of the period and was tapering off
at the end after Iraq stormed Kuwait on Aug. 2 and the subsequent
oil-price shock to the economy.
   Even President Bush and his chief economic adviser, Michael
Boskin, have said publicly the economy has weakened in recent
months. Bush calls it a ``slowdown''; Boskin says it is a ``lull.''
   The department also reported that a GNP measure of inflation
rose even more than previously thought - at an annual rate of 4.2
percent. It first was reported to have risen 4.1 percent after a
3.9 percent gain in the second quarter. Inflation advanced at a 6.4
percent rate in the first quarter.
   At the same time, it said after-tax profits earned by American
corporations jumped 6.7 percent during the third quarter.
   Corporate profits dropped 0.6 percent in the second quarter,
erasing a 0.5 percent gain in the first.
   In another report, the department said orders to U.S. factories
for ``big-ticket'' durable goods rebounded 3.6 percent in October,
driven by a 14.8 percent jump in transportation orders.
   It reported that orders for durable goods - ``big-ticket'' items
expected to last more than three years - totaled a seasonally
adjusted $129.4 billion following declines of 1.6 percent in
September and 0.9 percent in August.
   Leading the downward revision in the GNP was a 3.2 percent gain
in consumer spending, down from the 3.6 percent advance first
reported.
   At the same time, inventories declined $4.4 billion rather than
the $1.7 billion in the initial report.
   Housing construction was off 19.2 percent instead of 15.4
percent while government spending rose just 0.6 percent rather than
the 1.3 percent gain first reported.
   On the other hand, business investment was up 8.2 percent
instead of 7.4 percent in the initial report while the trade
deficit narrowed to $500 million rather than the $7.9 billion
reported last month.
   Each quarter's GNP is revised twice as more complete data
becomes available. The final revision in the third-quarter report
is due next month.
   The changes meant the total GNP, the broadest measure of the
nation's economic activity, was growing at an annual rate of $4.17
trillion in the third quarter, when adjusted for inflation. That
was a gain of $18.0 billion over the second quarter.
   Despite the third-quarter growth, many economists believe the
recession began during the period - if not before.
   Elliott Platt, an economist with Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette
securities dealers in New York, notes that the U.S. economy has
experienced growth during the first quarter of five of the eight
recessions since World War II.
   Thus, he says, the 1.7 percent growth rate in the third quarter
does not preclude the possibility that the recession began during
that quarter.
   The GNP expanded at a 1.7 percent rate during the first quarter,
then fell to a barely perceptible 0.4 percent rate in the second.
It had grown 2.5 percent in 1989 after a 4.5 percent increase a
year earlier.
   If the economy is in a recession, it has concluded an expansion
that would have been eight years old this month. The last recession
ended in November 1982 after 16 months of decline.
   Many economists believe a current recession would be
short-lived, with the economy posting negative growth in this
quarter and next before resuming its expansion in the second
quarter of 1991.

<HEAD>Cities Seeking Watery Solution To Revitalization</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEPHANIE SCHOROW</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   City planners fishing for new sources of revenue
are riding a wave of fascination with life under the sea.
   In recent years nearly 30 American cities have built a new
aquarium, are planning one or are renovating aging facilities. The
hope is to hook the imagination of a generation jolted by polluted
beaches and awe-struck by the rescue of whales.
   Today's aquariums utilize the latest innovations in acrylics to
build clear tank walls, sometimes several stories high. Marine
research has helped create nearly perfect replicas of watery
habitat.
   It all makes for a good show, but aquarium directors say their
aim is not just to entertain.
   ``The thing that is driving all this (interest in aquariums) in
the general public is a growing awareness that the aquatic world is
very important,'' said Paul Boyle, director of programs and
exhibits at the 21-year-old New England Aquarium, which is planning
a move to a $150 million facility in the Charlestown section of the
city.
   The payoff can be substantial. New England Aquarium officials
say the facility's 1.2 million annual visitors have a direct annual
economic impact of $170 million to the city.
   The Boston aquarium's expansion reflects a growing worldwide
fascination with life under the sea; even in Japan - where whales
are still seen as a source of meat - a major aquarium opened in
July in Osaka.
   ``The number (of aquariums) under construction or being planned
is really significant. It seems to have blossomed in the last five
or six years,'' said Roger Kolsek, curator of fishes for the Shedd
Aquarium in Chicago.
   From 1980 to 1987, attendance at American and Canadian aquariums
increased by nearly 50 percent, from 7,968,000 to 11,944,000,
according to the American Association of Zoological Parks and
Aquariums.
   In early September, the $42 million Aquarium of the Americas
opened in New Orleans; more than 10,000 people toured the facility
on its first day.
   The Texas State Aquarium, which opened in July in Corpus
Christi, is the first to focus on life in the Gulf of Mexico and
the Caribbean. Aquariums are also planned in San Antonio, Texas;
Tampa, Fla.; Camden, N.J.; and the Canadian cities of Ottawa and
Toronto, Boyle said.
   Expansions are planned for the Monterey Bay Aquarium, which
opened just five years ago; Baltimore's Natoonal Aquarium, which
debuted in 1981; and the Shedd Aquarium in Chicago, one of the
oldest that has been open since 1929.
   City officials hope these aquariums can be used to both draw
tourist dollars and function as educational institutions.
   ``I guess you could say that in New England, Baltimore, Monterey
and now in New Orleans, it's proved to be an attractive asset, both
physically and economically,'' said Bill Flynn, president of the
Tennessee Aquarium, a new facility being billed as the country's
only major freshwater aquarium. It will be built in Chattanooga in
1992.
   With more than a million visitors a year, the New England
Aquarium in Boston already is overcrowded, Boyle said. The new
facility, to be completed in 1996, will include a 4.5-million
gallon whale and dolphin tank with a pedestrian concourses
surrounded by water, expanded marine research facilities and new
exhibits.
   But the dawning of the age of aquariums is not without limits.
   Norwalk, Conn., officials hoped a $30 million waterfront complex
- including an aquarium, cinema and maritime museum - that opened
in July of 1988 would continue the revitalization of that rundown
area. But attendance and revenue figures were half of what was
projected, leading Norwalk city officials to order a management
shakeup and budget cuts. The city eventually had to jump in with $4
million to pay for advertising, operating expenses and bond debt.

   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, all
but declaring the nation in a recession, said today that
skyrocketing oil prices and a growing shortage of credit have
substantially weakened the economy.
   ``All indications are that a meaningful downturn in aggregate
output occurred as we moved through October into November,''
Greenspan told the House Banking Committee.
   In response to a question from Rep. Charles Schumer, Greenspan
said it was too soon to determine whether the country was
experiencing a recession, but he conceded that economic growth, as
measured by the gross national product, probably would turn
negative in the October-December quarter.
   ``This seems to me to be a nice way of saying we've entered a
recession,'' said Schumer, D-N.Y.
   The central bank chief said oil prices, which have risen from
$20 a barrel before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2 to $33
now, are cutting into the spending power of both businesses and
consumers.
   He said the clearest manifestation of the oil shock is in the
labor market, where ``private employment and hours of work dropped
markedly in October.''
   ``The drop in employment and hours is causing personal income to
decline at the very time that rising energy prices are squeezing
many household budgets. This drop in real purchasing power, along
with plunging consumer sentiment, does not bode well for the
near-term trends in consumer demand,'' he said.
   Although world oil supplies have rebounded to what Greenspan
described as ``comfortable'' levels, he said uncertainty about what
will happen in the Persian Gulf is keeping the price of oil high
and is causing consumers and businesses to hold off on purchases in
general.
   Greenspan also said the so-called ``credit crunch,'' which he
first publicly noted in July, ``has proceeded somewhat further.
   ``The available anecdotal information clearly suggests that many
types of businesses are encountering greater difficulty obtaining
financing,'' he said.
   The central bank chairman confirmed that the Fed has moved in
recent weeks to cut interest rates in an effort to stimulate the
economy.
   And he said, ``I can only offer the assurance that the Federal
Reserve will seek, as we have in the past, to foster economic
stability and sustainable growth.''
   However, he cautioned, ``There is no policy initiative that can
in the end prevent the transfer of wealth, and cut in our standard
of living, that stems from higher prices for imported oil.''
   The government reported today that the U.S. economy grew at a
1.7 percent annual rate in the third quarter, a bit less than
previously thought. The Commerce Department said its revision in
the gross national product showed the economy advanced even more
slowly from July through September than the 1.8 percent first
reported last month.
   Some analysts contend most of the third-quarter growth was
concentrated in the first part of the period and was tapering off
at the end after Iraq stormed Kuwait on Aug. 2 and the subsequent
oil-price shock to the economy.
   Thus far, Greenspan has been cautious in describing the state of
the economy, even though the Fed cut interest rates twice this
month.
   But even President Bush and his chief economic adviser, Michael
Boskin, have said publicly the economy has weakened in recent
months. Bush calls it a ``slowdown''; Boskin says it is a ``lull.''
   A recession, defined as at least a six-month contraction of
economic output as measured by the gross national product, is
political poison. That is why politicians generally avoid the term.
   Most private economists say the nation has already toppled into
one.
   ``Recession is here,'' the National Association of Business
Economists declared Tuesday after polling 51 professional
forecasters and finding three-quarters of them believe the downturn
has already begun.
   In a congressional appearance in mid-September, Greenspan said
the jump in oil prices following Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait
had increased the threat of both higher inflation and a recession.
He warned then of ``new and substantial risks'' to the economy.
   The central bank's actions since then show that it has clearly
been more concerned about the recession risk than the inflation
risk. It cut the federal funds rate, a key interest-rate measure,
twice this month, each time by a quarter point. The rate, now at 7{
percent, is what banks charge each other for overnight loans.
   The central bank's strategy is to raise the rate to dampen
inflationary pressures and to cut it when the economy needs a
boost.

<HEAD>Pork, Meatpacking Groups Seek Retaliation Against European
Community</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN P. ROSENFELD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pork producers and meatpackers asked the
U.S. government Wendesday to impose retaliatory trade sanctions on
the European Community for its bans on U.S. meat shipments.
   The complaint was filed with U.S. Trade Representative Carla
Hills by the National Pork Producers Council and the American Meat
Institute.
   Retaliatory steps could include a ban on $250 million in EC meat
shipments to the United States.
   ``Our petition is designed to get the EC to open its market -
not to close ours,'' said Mike Wehler, a farmer from Plain, Wis.,
who heads the pork council.
   Wehler said the application for sanctions will ``get the clock
ticking'' on a timetable for reprisals in case negotiations fail to
resolve the dispute.
   ``The U.S. pork industry has used great restraint so that the EC
and U.S. negotiators could eliminate this artificial trade barrier
through consultations with the U.S. trade representative's
office,'' Wehler said. ``However, the EC has shown no willingness
to use scientific standards as the guide for meat trade between our
countries. Therefore, we are requesting formal action against the
EC because U.S. pork producers refuse to stand by idly while the EC
runs amok with unfair trade barriers against our product.''
   The pork group said the trade representative has 45 days to
decide whether to accept the petition. If accepted, the United
States may then seek sanctions from the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade, an international trade organization, or act
alone in imposing restrictions on EC exports.
   As of Nov. 1, the EC had stopped imports of pork tongues,
hearts, livers and kidneys, on grounds that plants producing the
meats had failed to meet EC sanitary standards. The 12-nation group
also has banned imports of beef from animals given hormones and
will ban all U.S. beef as of Dec. 31.
   Pork producers and meatpackers deny any health problems exist.
They say two-thirds of the meat consumed in the EC does not meet
such standards and call the EC action a blatant artificial trade
barrier.
   Gene Leman, an executive at meatpacking giant IBP Inc., said the
ban is costing the pork trade $40 million to $45 million a year,
even though it only affects $13 million in pork exports. With fewer
variety cuts being shipped abroad, domestic prices are plunging, he
said.
   Pork tongue, which was being sold for $1.25 a pound delivered in
the EC, is only selling for 40 to 45 cents a pound in the U.S.
market. As more pork tongue enters the U.S. market for use in pet
food, prices are expected to drop to 20 cents a pound, Leman told
reporters.

<TEXT>
   Once considered river trash, the
whiskered catfish is turning up in avant-garde restaurants and on
fast-food menus from coast to coast.
   ``I eat in a lot of places around this country ... Many of them
now have catfish on the menu,'' says Craig Claiborne, cookbook
author and retired New York Times food editor.
   Last year, sales of farm-raised catfish ranked the variety as
one of the nation's top five seafoods, behind only tuna, shrimp,
cod and Alaska pollock.
   But despite its rising popularity, the boon predicted for the
aquaculture industry in the 1960s hasn't fully come to pass.
   ``The pie is getting larger, but the pieces are getting
smaller,'' said Roger Barlow, catfish marketing director for the
Mississippi Department of Agriculture.
   Nutritional value and the consistent taste brought by
high-protein feed allowed the catfish industry to grow
dramatically, but that growth also brought more competition,
especially in processing, Barlow said.
   Catfish farmers also are facing rising costs, labor demands and
softening sales.
   Catfish farming started in Mississippi in 1966 with 40 acres.
Now, the industry is the state's fourth leading agricultural crop,
contributing more than $300 million to the state economy in 1989.
   Many farmers in the Mississippi Delta region switched to catfish
in the early 1980s because the traditional agriculture industry was
slumping. Aquaculture allowed them to use their land and skills and
brought new economic strength to the state.
   The new industry also provided thousands of new jobs for
unskilled and semiskilled workers idled when machinery replaced
many jobs throughout the Delta region.
   The state's catfish industry now employs more than 6,000 people,
with an annual payroll of more than $76 million, according to The
Catfish Institute in Belzoni, which is located in Humphreys County,
``The Catfish Capital of the World.''
   This year, catfish operations in the state will raise, harvest
and process more than 380 million pounds of fresh catfish.
   The fish is processed by 25 to 30 companies, most of which are
in the state, including the nation's largest two.
   But a glut in processing forced four processing plants to close
in 1989-90, and many processors say they are pinched by higher
prices they pay to farmers.
   About 85 percent of the catfish supplied to processors in
Mississippi is produced by members of the Catfish Bargaining
Association, which fixes selling prices for processors. Processors
are paying farmers 80 cents a pound this year compared to 71 or 72
cents last year.
   Some processors say this year's price is about 10 cents too
high.
   The nation's second-largest processor, Isola-based Country
Skillet Catfish Co., has even threatened to expand into farming
unless it can secure lower prices from farmers.
   ``If we're faced with no option, we'll start farming,'' said
Dick Stevens, Country Skillet's president. ``We can't afford to buy
fish at what prices are today. We have to buy raw materials
relevant to market prices.''
   Country Skillet's retail sales and sales of live fish are
slowing because of the higher prices, Stevens said.
   ``I guess the farmers wanted to make a sackful of money,'' he
said. ``Instead of creating a good situation, farmers have created
a nightmare.''
   Country Skillet, which is owned by food processing giant ConAgra
Inc. of Omaha, Neb., is among the major catfish processors in the
Delta region rebelling against efforts by farmers to control the
price of whole fish.
   But many processors are cooperatives of catfish growers, who
benefit from higher base prices.
   Delta Pride Catfish Inc. of Indianola - the nation's largest
catfish processor - is owned by a 180-member farmer cooperative,
and it supports fixed prices.
   That hasn't stopped workers from the United Food and Commercial
Workers unions from going on strike at two Delta Pride plants.
   The workers walked out Sept. 12 after turning down a contract
proposal offering a 4.8 percent average wage increase in the first
year and pay increases averaging 35 to 90 cents per hour over the
remaining two years of the pact.
   The workers, many of whom are unskilled or semiskilled black
women, say the raises are not enough. Negotiations are to resume
Dec. 12.
   The increased demand for catfish, due no doubt to its more
refined taste and image, is one of the best safeguards that the
industry will survive, Barlow said.
   In years past, the fishy-tasting river variety of catfish were
caught with a cane pole with worm bait. They were cleaned, rolled
in cornmeal and deep-fried, and usually served with hush puppies -
small fried balls of cornmeal dough.
   Now consumers can buy pond-fed catfish in grocery stores as
whole dressed fish, steaks, filets, strips and nuggets. Recipes
offer ways to poach, barbecue, broil, smoke, stir-fry, fry, bake,
steam, braise, stew, blacken, saute or grill dishes.
   ``French chefs I've talked with are fond of both the flavor and
texture of pond-raised catfish,'' Claiborne said.

<HEAD>Italian Auto Giant Will Build Two New Factories</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: ADDS one graf after 6th graf, The announcement, with new
layoffs at Fiat subsidiary. Picks up 6th graf pvs, Fiat has.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>TURIN, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Italy's auto giant Fiat, looking ahead to a
recovery in world markets in 1993 and beyond, announced Wednesday
it will build two new production plants in southern Italy.
   The plan, unveiled by Fiat chairman Giovanni Agnelli to Premier
Giulio Andreotti, will require an investment of 5 trillion lire, or
about $4.5 billion, over the next three years and will create 8,300
new jobs in the economically depressed south.
   One plant, designed to produce 1,800 cars a day, will be built
in the Basilicata region. This factory will employ some 7,000
people and will be about equal in size to Fiat's highly automated
plant in Cassino, Near Rome.
   Fiat also plans to expand and remodel an existing car components
factory near Avellino, in the Campania region, into a plant
producing 3,600 engines a day and employing around 1,300 people.
   Construction will be completed by the end of 1993 or the
beginning of 1994, a Fiat spokesman said.
   The announcement of the plans coincided with a slump in the
Italian and European car markets, which forced Fiat to temporarily
layoff 70,000 workers earlier this month to cut its
over-production.
   A Fiat spokesman said Wednesday that Fiat Geotech SpA, which
makes farming and other equipment, would briefly lay off 2,000
workers in the next few months due to poor market conditions.
   Fiat has said it expects the market slump to last through 1992,
but that demand is expected to pick up again in 1993 and beyond.
   Fiat officials said the Italian group must be ready to operate
in ``conditions of absolute competitiveness'' with the major auto
makers, including the Japanese.
   Fiat's automobile production totaled 2.2 million in 1989 and is
expected to settle at about 2 million this year.
   Unions hailed the project of the Turin-based group, Italy's
largest private sector industrial conglomerate. Fiat is controlled
by the Agnelli family.

<TEXT>
   The Heineken brewing company
said Wednesday it would slash its Dutch operation by 250 jobs
because of slow sales and the Netherlands' growing taste for
specialty beers.
   The reduction by attrition, early retirement programs and
internal transfers will bring Heineken Nederland BV's workforce
down to 3,550 from its current 3,800, according to a company
statement.
   There will be no forced dismissals, the statement said.
   Heineken and its other main domestic brand, Amstel, still
control an estimated 52 percent of the domestic beer market, but
sales have remained flat.
   The company, whose worldwide profits surged 18 percent to about
$99 million in the first six months of this year, faces growing
domestic competition from specialty and low-alcohol brands as well
as Belgian and German imports.
   Last January, a plan to cut its domestic workforce of what was
then 4,200 employees by 700 people had to be scrapped after a
week-long strike by the labor unions.

   Subaru of America Inc. will trim its
workforce by as much as 10 percent to cut costs and restore
profitability, a company spokesman said.
   Some employees have been notified over the past few weeks that
they would be let go effective Dec. 28, and other reductions will
be made over the next few months, spokesman Richard Marshall said
Wednesday.
   Subaru has not yet determined the extent of layoffs, but the
figure is not expected to exceed 10 percent of the company's
1,080-person payroll, Marshall said.
   ``Each department is looking at its own operations to study how
it can best be reorganized to improve efficiency and cut costs
where it's needed,'' Marshall said. He said employees who lose
their jobs are being offered a severance package and counseling on
seeking a new job.
   He said the layoffs would affect the company's Cherry Hill
headquarters and a Pennsauken facility, as well as regional offices
across the nation. About 60 percent of Subaru's work force is in
New Jersey.
   Subaru of America was bought last August by Fuji Heavy
Industries Ltd. of Japan, which builds the cars sold under the
Subaru nameplate and previously had owned 49 percent of the
company. Fuji is attempting to reverse Subaru's losses, which came
to $42.4 million last year and $57.9 million the year before.
   As part of the cost-cutting program, Subaru will not fill some
vacant positions and will consolidate some field offices, Marshall
said.
   For example, he said, the company's southeast regional office in
West Palm Beach, Fla., and its Atlantic regional office in Savage,
Md., will be combined and relocated in the Atlanta area.

<HEAD>EC Seeks Urgent Reform Of Fishing Policy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT J. WIELAARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Community's Commission on
Wednesday proposed changing the EC's fishing policy to halt
overfishing that it said has ``virtually wiped out'' major species
in EC waters.
   In a report to the 12 member states, EC Fisheries Commissioner
Manuel Marin called for a 40 percent cut in fishing capacity,
fishing bans to let stocks renew themselves and tougher enforcement
of fishing quotas.
   He told reporters too many fishing boats and lax enforcement of
fishing quotas by the EC governments have undermined the goal set
in 1983 of maintaining fish stocks.
   ``There is not a proper monitoring (of fish quotas). It is one
area where the member states have to accept that we take a
different approach,'' he said.
   Marin's proposal is bound to run into opposition from the EC
states which, under pressure from national industries that provide
work for an estimated 2 million people, have long resisted deep
cuts in capacity.
   Marin said in the North Atlantic, the North Sea and the Baltic
Sea years of overfishing had put stocks of haddock, cod, sprat and
herring ``in danger of extinction.''
   But he said refoms could help maintain the industry.
   The EC is the world's fourth largest fishing power after Japan,
the Soviet Union and China.
   In 1987, the last year for which complete figures are available,
its output was 7 million metric tons, about 7.5 percent of world
production.
   To soften the blow to the industry of capacity cuts, Marin said
the EC states should consider paying fishermen for not fishing and
to impose annual fishing bans of several months to generate a
replenishment of stocks.
   He cited a British law that keeps Scottish fishermen ashore for
10 days each month. ``It would not be absurd for the Community to
co-finance the 10 days not actually spent fishing,'' Marin said.
   His report on the state of the EC fishing sector and the
proposed overhaul of the fishing policy was drafted by independent
experts.
   But it is likely to upset the EC states that have long debated
quotas, types of fishing nets and other conservation methods.

<TEXT>
   During 50 years in Hollywood, Lew
Wasserman made thousands of deals, from raising Ronald Reagan's
salary to improving Joan Crawford's dressing room.
   Yet his biggest deal came last week: The $6.6 billion sale of
MCA Inc. to the Japanese electronics giant Matsushita Electric
Industrial Co.
   Hollywood's premiere dealmaker took an active part in the four
months of behind-the-scenes negotiations, during which rumors of a
collapse circulated. Then on Monday, an agreement was announced.
After a few comments to the press, Wasserman returned to the
relative anonymity that he has maintained throughout his career.
   He has said little about his future plans, although Matsushita
promised to keep current MCA management in place. Wasserman stands
to reap more than $350 million in cash and stock from the takeover.
   The Wasserman success story is so cliche-ridden that his own
scriptwriters would be embarrassed to write it. Born March 15,
1913, in Cleveland, he started work at 12 hawking candy in a
burlesque house. During high school, he ushered in a movie house,
acquiring his lifelong habit of getting by on five hours of sleep
nightly.
   At 21, he became vice president for advertising and promotion at
a theater-restaurant, the Mayfair Casino. A newspaperman introduced
Wasserman to a dark-haired beauty who clerked for the May Co.,
Edith Beckerman. He offered her two passes to the nightclub.
   ``I leaped at the offer because he was a very attractive man,''
the woman who would become Edie Wasserman recalled later. ``I paid
more attention to Lew than the show. After that I chased him for a
year - until he caught me.''
   Through the night club, Wasserman met Jules Stein, who supplied
big-name bands through his talent agency, Music Corporation of
America. Stein, a former Chicago eye doctor who had become
intrigued by show business, offered the young man a job as national
advertising director of MCA at $60 a week.
   ``The job has a great future,'' he told Edie.
   ``What so great about it?'' she asked.
   ``Stein is an old man. He's 40.''
   In the 1930s the visionary Stein sought to broaden MCA by
invading Hollywood, where big money could be made in movies and
radio. Stein and Wasserman brought a new image to the Hollywood
agent, who was stigmatized as a cigar-chomping loudmouth in a
checkered suit. MCA agents were well-spoken and dressed in tailored
grey.
   They also were tough.
   During one of his rare interviews, Wasserman was asked about his
reputation as a hard, ruthless man. His reply:
   ``If negotiating in an attempt to arrive at a favorable deal
comes under the heading of being hard, I would stipulate that I'm
hard ... Actually I don't think the word `ruthless' fits our time.
It is outmoded. It's a carryover from robber baron days.''
   In 1946, Stein became chairman of MCA and named Wasserman, 33,
his successor as president. Wasserman virtually invented the
package deal - selling movie contracts that included script, stars,
producer and director, all MCA clients.
   The postwar years were cataclysmic for Hollywood. Television
would eventually cut movie attendance in half and wipe out network
radio. Wasserman was determined that MCA would get its share of the
new medium.
   Revue Productions was founded to supply the need for a huge
amount of entertainment to fill the nation's television screens.
Series like ``Wagon Train,'' ``M Squad'' and ``Highway Patrol''
were ground out on tight budgets, often with over-the-hill MCA
clients.
   By the late 1950s, the oldtime Hollywood studios were plagued by
empty stages and shuttering theaters. None was in worse shape than
Universal, which had undergone a series of ownerships. Stein and
Wasserman made their move.
   In 1959 MCA bought Universal Studios, paying $11.3 million for
the prime property in the hills just north of Hollywood. The
Justice Department decreed that MCA would have to leave the agency
business if it owned a studio. No problem. The Beverly Hills agency
was closed, and Stein's collection of antique English furniture
moved to Universal City.
   From his penthouse office in the studio's Black Tower, Wasserman
commanded the ever-growing MCA empire. Unlike Harry Cohn, Jack
Warner and Darryl Zanuck of the previous era, Wasserman did not
meddle daily in creative matters. He preferred to direct overall
policy, leaving the nitty-gritty of filmmaking to executives and
producers. ``I'm just a paper-pusher,'' he claimed.
   His influence extended far beyond the studio boundaries. From
John Kennedy to George Bush, Wasserman has had a personal
relationship with U.S. presidents, as well as leading members of
Congress. Thus he has been able to influence legislation and agency
policy affecting the film industry.
   Wasserman also earned a reputation as Hollywood's peacemaker.
During bitter contract negotiations and industrywide strikes, he
often provided the solution that would get cameras rolling again.
   He's also been a target for demonstrators: When Universal
released the controversial ``Last Temptation of Christ'' in 1988,
Wasserman's home was a picket site.
   At 77, Wasserman presents an imposing figure - 6 feet 2 inches
tall, 160 pounds, with a healthy crop of graying hair atop his
broad brow. His single nod toward eccentricity is the ever-present
pair of outsized, black-rimmed spectacles.
   He and Edie, who have a daughter Lynne and two grandchildren,
live in a comfortable but not overly grand house on the west side
of Los Angeles. The furnishings are 18th Century English and the
wall decorations are by Picasso, Degas, Matisse and others.
   Both Wassermans are active in charities, particularly the Motion
Picture Country House and Hospital. They entertain modestly -
except for their 50th wedding anniversary gala four years ago.
   Guests from the political, financial and show worlds entered on
Universal's New York Street and dined in the ``Back to the Future''
town square, one of several sets recently destroyed in a fire. The
celebrants included clients Wasserman once represented as an agent:
Bob Hope, Lucille Ball, Jimmy Stewart, Charlton Heston, Audrey
Hepburn, Cary Grant, Ginger Rogers.
   The New Hollywood was represented by producers Steven Spielberg
and Henry Winkler, actor Don Johnson, and studio moguls Michael
Eisner of Disney and Rupert Murdoch of Fox.
   From the political scene: Lady Bird Johnson, Alan Cranston, Pete
Wilson, Lloyd Bentsen, Howard Metzenbaum, George Mitchell. Also
Wasserman's first client when he arrived in Hollywood, President
Reagan, who toasted Lew and Edie: ``Let's all get together on their
75th.''

<HEAD>Mercedes-Benz Announces Plan to Cut Costs, Produce More Commercial
Vehicles</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mercedes-Benz AG on Wednesday
announced it plans to cut costs in the next few years, and said it
wants to step up the production of commercial vehicles in 1991.
   The company, a subsidiary of the German industrial giant
Daimler-Benz AG, said it wants to increase worldwide commercial
vehicle production by 3.7 percent to 270,000 units in 1991.
   Mercedes-Benz is looking to expand the commerical vehicles
division rather than consolidate in 1991, said Helmut Werner, a
mamber of the company's management board.
   Eastern Europe will be a prime target of expansion efforts, he
said.
   Mercedes-Benz recently signed cooperation contracts with the
Soviet automaker Avtrokon and the Hungarian bus maker Ikarus.
   Werner also announced a ``wide-ranging, ambitious'' cost-cutting
program that is to save the company 1.8 billion marks, or about
$1.2 billion, by the mid-1990s.
   Overseas sales of Mercedes vehicles, mainly in Brazil, South
Africa and the United States, have begun to feel the effects of the
worldwide economic downturn.
   German companies, many of which rely on exports, have voiced
concern in recent weeks over the unfavorable strength of the mark
against the dollar. The strong mark has shrunk the overseas
earnings for many of those companies.

   Crabs for Christmas?
   Sounds strange, but tiny hermit tree crabs that local teen-agers
are buying as pets and wearing on chains around their necks may be
one of the hot new gifts under, or perhaps climbing up, the tree
this year.
   ``When they're on the person, it usually takes five or six
minutes before he'll feel comfortable enough to come out of his
shell and crawl around on the person's clothes,'' said James
Allemon, owner of Indian Harbor, a Rockford gift shop that began
selling the 1-inch Caribbean crabs in September.
   He first sold the crabs, supplied by a Tennessee company, as
pets in miniature terrariums. But when Allemon and his wife noticed
loops on some of the crabs' gold-tone trimmed seashells, they
decided the crustaceans would make the perfect pendant.
   He's sold about 50 of the $6.95 crab necklaces - mostly to
teen-agers - in the last two months and about 500 in cages.
   Rockford High School sophomore Monica Leeuwenburg has only worn
her crab, named Future, to school a couple of times. She knows a
few other students who wear the crabs as necklaces and several mores for
protection. They can
live to be 70 years old.
   Leeuwenburg said Future spends most of his time in a stone-lined
fish bowl, where he eats vegetables and his favorite snack, peanut
butter.
   ``And he always comes out of his shell when there's music on,''
she said with a giggle. ``I don't know if he's dancing or what.''
   But animal rights advocates aren't amused.
   ``We are against any unnecessary activity which may impede an
animal's natural life,'' Ken Johnson, an investigator for the
Humane Society of the United States, said from Washington. ``I
think that this would restrict the crabs from living naturally, due
to the fact that they wouldn't have access to food and water when
they need it.''
   But Allemon said his crab necklaces are sold with a book about
their care.
   ``We're not doing this for the shock value,'' Allemon said.
``The crab comes with responsibilities, like any pet.''
   Gardner Enterprises of Hendersonville, Tenn., which sells the
crabs to pet and gift shops, only recently heard that the crabs
were being sold as jewelry in a few cities.
   Gardner manager Yolanda Alexander said crabs' popularity as pets
is growing, noting the comaany has sold about 50,000 crabs of all
sizes in the past two months.
   ``But I'm surprised people want to wear them around their
necks,'' she said.

   Stocks showed slight gains today in choppy,
cautious trading after the latest set of economic data was released
and the Federal Reserve chairman acknowledged the economy had
entered a ``meaningful downturn.''
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks was up 1.73 points
at 2,545.54 with an hour left to trade on the New York Stock
Exchange.
   Gainers outpaced decliners by about 3 to 2 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 862 up, 631 down;
and 483 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 123.54 million shares as of 3
p.m. EST on Wall Street.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks was
up 0.42 at 174.29. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up 1.63 at 298.63.
   Analysts said some investors were optimistic interest rates
could be heading lower following the government's release today of
new economic data and testimony by Fed chief Alan Greenspan before
the House Banking Committee.
   The Commerce Department said the economy, as measured by the
gross national product, grew at a 1.7 percent annual rate in the
third quarter, a downward revision from the 1.8 percent first
reported last month.
   The GNP is the nation's total output of goods and services and
its broadest measure of economic activity.
   In comments before the banking committee, Greenspan all but
declared the nation in a recession, noting that skyrocketing oil
prices and a growing shortage of credit have substantially weakened
the economy.
   ``All indications are that a meaningful downturn in aggregate
output occurred as we moved through October into November,'' he
said.
   Hugh Johnson, senior vice president for First Albany Corp., said
Greenspan's comments were encouraging as far as the interest rate
outlook was concerned.
   But he also noted the Fed has given no clear indication that it
intends to aggressively lower rates to jump-start the economy in
the near term.
   ``The Fed is going to be characteristically very measured ... in
changing monetary policy,'' Johnson said.

   Grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly
higher Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade amid speculation the
Soviet Union will use money borrowed from Saudi Arabia to buy U.S.
grain.
   Analysts said commercial grain dealers were large buyers of both
futures contracts and cash grain, perhaps indicating their belief
that new export business is on the horizon.
   Doug Jackson, grains analyst with Farmers Commodities Corp. of
Des Moines, Iowa, said the rally was sparked by news that Saudi
Arabia loaned the Soviet Union $4 billion.
   Some traders believe the United States urged the Saudis to lend
the money so the Soviets can buy the approximately 1.2 million
metric tons of U.S. wheat and 600,000 metric tons of U.S. corn
still remaining under a long-term grain agreement that expires at
the end of the year.
   The Soviets say they can't buy the grain without credit but the
United States has refused to grant them export credits until the
Soviets formally liberalize their emigration policies.
   Jackson viewed the situation with skepticism. ``We've been
through this roller coaster almost daily for the last three weeks
and attitudes can change just as dramatically in the morning,'' he
said.
   At the close, wheat futures were { cent to 3{ cents higher with
the contract for delivery in December at $2.43 a bushel; corn was

   Orders to U.S. factories for durable goods
rose 3.6 percent in October, propelled mostly by orders for
airplanes, the government said Wednesday. Excluding the
transportation sector, orders fell 0.4 percent.
   ``The rise was all aircraft orders,'' said economist Bruce
Steinberg of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets in New York. ``We seem
to have a one-industry economy. The aircraft industry ... has
enough orders to last for the rest of the century.''
   The Commerce Department reported that orders for durable goods -
items expected to last more than three years - totaled a seasonally
adjusted $129.4 billion. It was the largest advance since a 4.1
percent gain in May and followed declines of 1.6 percent in
September and 0.9 percent in August.
   Transportation orders jumped 14.6 percent to $37.89 billion
following a 6.1 percent decline a month earlier. A Commerce
spokesman said more than half of the October gain reflected
aircraft orders.
   ``Since reaching a high in December 1988 of $132.1 billion,
orders have been unstable, fluctuating around a monthly average of
$125.9 billion,'' the department said. ``Much of the volatility was
attributable to transportation equipment.''
   The Boeing Co. reported more than $10 billion in orders for
air Gray wrote to Sen. John Glenn,
D-Ohio, recounting his assertion that he had told the senators he
had no information about Lincoln during that disputed meeting.
Hamilton said: ``This statement I read, it really wasn't true, was
it?''
   Gray: ``Well, as a matter of fact, yes it was true.''
   Hamilton: ``You really knew more than you let on, didn't you?''
   Hamilton pointed to evidence that Gray had received information
from the bank board's top California-based regulator, who had said
their examination had revealed ``a number of areas of concern'' at
Lincoln, including heavy direct investment in real estate.
   Gray said it had been eight months since he had seen that
regulator's memo, and he considered it incomplete and out of date.
   The committee is holding hearings into allegations the five
senators intervened improperly on behalf of Keating and his thrift
institution. Keating and his associated contributed $1.3 million to
the campaigns and causes of the five senators.
   The collapse of Lincoln has been estimated to cost taxpayers $2
billion in bailout costs. Keating is under indictment in
California, where the thrift is based.
   Besides DeConcini, senators under scrutiny by the panel are
Republican John McCain of Arizona and Democrats Glenn, Alan
Cranston of California and Donald Riegle of Michigan. All but
Riegle attended that April 2 meeting.
   Testifying Tuesday, Gray told the panel of the April 2, 1987,
meeting.
   ``I considered it improper,'' Gray testified. ``The whole
setting was an intimidating one.''
   ``DeConcini said, `We're very concerned about this direct
investment regulation of yours. ... We'd like you to withdraw it
until we can find out if it's constitutional. If you can do that,
we'll get our friend at Lincoln to make more home loans.'''
   Gray described the three other senators in the April 2 meeting
as silently acquiescing to DeConcini's request. Under
cross-examination by Glenn's lawyer, Charles Ruff, he acknowledged
hearing no verbal agreement.
   ``I thought I saw a nod but maybe I didn't,'' he said. ``... The
point is there was no objection ... Nobody said, `He speaks for
himself.'''
   Gray contended the meeting was improper and that he felt awkward
and pressured by the senators. He said he took no action as a
result of the meeting, nor did other regulators.
   ``We did not succumb to that pressure,'' he said.

<HEAD>Pier 1's Successful Expansion Is Facing First Test, A Slower
Holiday</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EVAN RAMSTAD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The rapid expansion of Pier 1 Imports
Inc., which began five years ago when the company updated its
'60s-style merchandise and look, is facing its first big sales test
- a lackluster holiday season.
   The serape and incense store has grown up and out, changing its
image with an open layout and a merchandise mix that places greater
emphasis on fashion and color.
   Since 1985, Pier 1 has been the nation's fastest-growing home
furnishings retailer. The number of stores jumped to 554 from 265,
sales doubled and profits tripled during that time.
   But Pier 1's sales fell in September for the first time since
the facelift and expansion began. In October, sales at stores that
have been open at least a year were again off, 7.3 percent, and the
company moved into the holiday retailing period with lower
expectations.
   ``The economy is in an uncertain period. Certainly the Middle
East (crisis) is affecting people buying things that Pier 1
sells,'' said Marvin Girouard, president and chief operating
officer. ``We don't sell needs. We sell wants and that's the first
thing that people start being concerned about.''
   Pier 1's move to higher-priced merchandise has ``made them more
sensitive to the economy,'' agreed Dan Wewer, an analyst for
Robinson Humphrey in Atlanta. ``They are now much more
vulnerable.''
   While conceding that this holiday season is ``as uncertain as
any we've gone into in recent years,'' Girouard said, ``our mix is
appropriate. The stores are merchandised very, very well. We're
ready for Christmas.''
   Company officials were bolstered some by sales after
Thanksgiving, considered the busiest time for retailers. With 15
percent more stores than in the same period last year, Pier 1 said
its sales were 18 percent higher during the week that ended Nov.
24. The company said it didn't have sales figures for just the
stores open a year or more.
   ``They're set up as well as a specialty retailer can be set
up,'' said analyst Dennis Van Zelfden of Rauscher Pierce in Dallas.
   Pier 1's growth has been successful enough that the company will
be able to keep expanding, though at a slower pace, through the
retailing slowdown, Girouard said.
   ``In some ways, no one is our competitor,'' he said. ``In some
ways, everyone is because we're selling things that you buy with
your discretionary dollar. What we have to do is be more accessible
and available.''
   Pier 1 opened 85 stores in the 1989 fiscal year ended Feb. 28
and will open 74 by the end of this fiscal year.
   Store building will slow down during the next few years, but
Girouard said Pier 1 is on target to reach $1 billion in sales by
1994 and have 1,000 stores by 2000.
   Profits have been up in the most recent fiscal year, although
they've been down lately.
   The company earned $25.5 million, or 71 cents a share, on $516.9
million in sales during the 12 months ended Feb. 28. In the
previous fiscal year net income totaled $21.9 million, or 70 cents
a share, on sales of $414.6 million.
   In its second quarter ended Sept. 1, Pier 1 netted $2.6 million,
or 7 cents a share, on $149.6 million in sales. That was off 64
percent from year-ago earnings of $7.3 million, or 20 cents, and
$134.9 million in sales.
   ``Since 1985, we've opened over 350 stores and there's only
about eight or 10 of them that we might not open today,'' he said.
   ``What that rapid expansion gave us was some markets where we
didn't have much presence and now we feel very well covered, in Los
Angeles, Chicago, Boston, Dallas and Houston. Now we're looking at
single sites and regional shopping areas.''
   Fort Worth entrepreneur Charles Tandy, who also started Tandy
Corp. and Radio Shack, opened Pier 1's first store near San
Francisco in 1962. The Far East goods he sold at bargain prices
caught on with the Bay Area's flower children.
   Tandy sold the chain in the early 1970s and it went public
shortly after.
   The chain went through a lean period from 1975 to 1985, closing
or relocating 175 stores.
   The company now is being approached by developers who want a
Pier 1 store on their property, Girouard said.
   About 40 percent of Pier 1's merchandise mix changes each year,
but the company has built strong relationships with suppliers,
Girouard said.
   ``You don't just show up in Afghanistan and place an order for
10,000 candlesticks because you don't know if they can ship. So a
lot of the big purchases are done with people that have proven who
they are and what they can do,'' he said.
   Girouard said political changes in Eastern Europe and the Soviet
Union could give Pier 1 potential new suppliers from which to
choose merchandise.
   ``They have got to sort out who can do what and organize so they
don't come rushing over to users and we don't know who to buy
from,'' Girouard said.
   ``Our biggest thing is knowing who we buy from. We can't replace
a purchase that doesn't show up when it's expected to be
shipped.''

<TEXT>
   Can workers on the brink of unemployment afford to
walk off their jobs and demand a pay raise? Not in the former East
Germany, economists say.
   An abrupt, paralyzing strike by 260,000 railroad workers was a
jarring wake-up call, a reminder that much of the former nation's
future hinges on how its workers react in the months ahead.
   Economists say the walkout, which began Sunday and ended
Wednesday, was a crucial first test for 8 million working people
who are grasping for higher living standards even as they try to
hang on to their jobs.
   The rail strike, the first big labor dispute since the German
nation united on Oct. 3, halted passenger and freight service in a
nation where most people lack cars or drivers' licenses.
   In talks between the Union of German Rail Workers and the rail
system, the Reichsbahn, the workers were granted a shortened
40-hour work week starting in April and $34 per child per month in
social benefits.
   Talks on the wage scale are to be concluded by the end of May,
and more talks are needed on job security, said union leader Rudi
Schaefer.
   Labor experts say the walkout sends a message to politicians
likely to win the united German elections on Sunday: Promising
eastern Germans quick prosperity will fuel demands for fatter
paychecks before they are possible.
   The rail workers were demanding not only job protection in an
industry likely to face large job losses, but a degree of wage
parity with their wealthier counterparts in the former West
Germany.
   ``There is a great trend to increase the wage level in eastern
Germany,'' said Wolfgang Scherement, labor market specialist for
the Berlin-based Institute for German Economics.
   But he said giving eastern Germans wage parity too soon will
eliminate one of the few advantages they have over other Western
Europeans trying to lure new businesses.
   The telephone system is terrible, the roads are bad and the
environment is one of the most polluted on the continent. But
eastern Germans are relatively skilled people who make only about
40 percent to 50 percent of what western Germans make.
   ``We in the institute think one chance for development is the
lower wages,'' Scherement said Wednesday.
   Experts differ on whether the railroad strike - which virtually
froze freight trade with other countries - is only the beginning of
labor unrest.
   ``It is not a single development,'' Scherement said. ``I believe
that next year there will be many more strikes to increase the East
German wage level.''
   But economist Benedikt Thanner said he believes high
unemployment will deter such strikes.
   ``The labor market situation will be worse. This will
automatically stop wage demands,'' said Thanner, an economist at
the Ifo-Institute for Economics in Munich and head of a research
group studying East-West integration.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl and his conservative Christian Democratic
Union, which has dominated eastern German politics with promises
that the former nation will soon enjoy Western wealth, is heavily
favored to win the united elections on Sunday.
   Thanner said he believes the party's persistent message has
fueled eastern eagerness for Western-style wages.
   ``I think people trust Kohl's promises so much that they think
it is justified to demand higher wages,'' he said.
   Unions, however, point out that eastern Germany already is
experiencing Western-style living costs because of the end of the
old Communist subsidies on food and shelter. They say eastern
Germans need higher wages just to maintain their old living
standards.
   According to official figures, eastern Germany had about 537,000
unemployed last month, about 6.1 percent of the work force.
However, experts say the jobless rate will rise to perhaps 4
million - nearly 50 percent - when credit runs out for most
enterprises and foreign contracts expire in the first quarter of
next year.
   That essentially will be rock botton for the economy. But many
economists say a recovery could begin soon afterward.
   Thanner said his institute will release a surprisingly
optimistic report next week that predicts up to $16 billion in
Western investment in the region next year.
   Scherement said his institute believes that former East
Germany's economic growth will begin increasing in mid-1991. But
they say how workers weather this transition will be a key to its
success.

   American Express opened its first travel
bureau in former East Germany Wednesday, returning to a region
where the company had its first traveler's check cashed almost 100
years ago.
   ``Destinations in former East bloc countries could be the travel
destinations of the '90s. The problem is we don't have sufficient
hotels or airport capacity or trained staff,'' said Juergen
Aumueller, president for Europe, the Middle East and Africa in the
company's travel services division.
   Aumueller called on others in the travel industry to invest in
the region, ``because the travel industry could be critical to the
economies'' of East European countries.
   American Express said it found a good location for its new
office in Dresden, a city 120 miles south of Berlin. But Aumueller
said real estate problems following the meger of formerly
Communist East Germany with West Germany had blocked the company's
plans to open bureaus in eastern Berlin and Leipzig.
   Leipzig, 60 miles west of Dresden, was where American Express
president James C. Fargo cashed the company's first traveler's
check on Aug. 5, 1891, in the Hotel Hauffe.
   The Dresden office will cash traveler's checks, make travel
arrangements and offer former East Germans the chance to apply for
credit cards. American Express officials said 1,200 former East
Germans had already applied for cards, despite generally despressed
economic conditions in the former Communist-run region.
   Aumueller said an annual income of $30,000 was required for a
card in western Germany, but that requirement would be relaxed for
applicants in the east.

   Stocks dropped slightly today in choppy,
cautious trading after the latest set of economic data was released
and the Federal Reserve chairman acknowledged the economy had
entered a ``meaningful downturn.''
   Analysts said some investors were optimistic interest rates
could be heading lower following the government's release today of
new economic data and testimony by Fed chief Alan Greenspan before
the House Banking Committee.
   The Commerce Department said the economy, as measured by the
gross natonal product, grew at a 1.7 percent annual rate in the
third quarter, a downward revision from the 1.8 percent first
reported last month.
   The GNP is the nation's total output of goods and services and
its broadest measure of economic activity.
   In comments before the banking committee, Greenspan all but
declared the nation in a recession, noting that skyrocketing oil
prices and a growing shortage of credit have substantially weakened
the economy.
   ``All indications are that a meaningful downturn in aggregate
output occurred as we moved through October into November,'' he
said.
   Hugh Johnson, senior vice president for First Albany Corp., said
Greenspan's comments were encouraging as far as the interest rate
outlook was concerned.
   But he also noted the Fed has given no clear indication that it
intends to aggressively lower rates to jump-start the economy in
the near term.
   ``The Fed is going to be characteristically very measured ... in
changing monetary policy,'' Johnson said.

   With an uncertain Christmas season under way, toy
company executives said Wednesday they are looking for more
business opportunities overseas to offset the sluggish U.S. retail
market.
   ``The outlook in international markets is brighter,'' John W.
Amerman, chief executive officer of Mattel Inc., said at a toy
industry conference sponsored by the investment firm Bear, Stearns
&amp; Co. Inc.
   Executives generally agreed their industry will feel pressure
from the sagging U.S. economy during the holiday season although
strong products should continue to sell well. Toy sales have
slipped along with sales of other merchandise as consumers,
uncertain about the economy and the Middle East, curtailed their
spending in recent months.
   ``It's really a mixed question,'' said Alan Hassenfeld, chief
executive officer of Hasbro Inc.
   While Hasbro expects a healthy performance from its Cabbage
Patch dolls and Milton Bradley board games, ``it might not be a
buoyant Christmas season,'' Hassenfeld said.
   Overall, the U.S. toy industry has seen slow growth in recent
years, rising from a $12.4 billion market in 1986 to $13.4 billion
last year, according to estimates from the Toy Manufacturers of
America, a trade group.
   This year, the figure is expected to climb to $14 billion.
   Those totals do not include video games, which were hot-selling
items during the 1980s. Nintendo of America Inc. projects that the
company and its licensees will sell about $4 billion worth of video
game products this year.
   But even Nintendo, which dominates the U.S. video game market,
expects to see a drop in sales of its hardware systems this year.
The company does project strong growth in its software game
cartridges.
   ``Rumors of our demise continue to be premature,'' Peter T.
Main, vice president of marketing for Nintendo, said in prepared
remarks at the conference.
   Main said that as the market for his company's products matures,
``software will continue to be the critical ingredient.''
   Hassenfeld said a maturing video game market is a positive sign
for makers of board games, such as Milton Bradley.
   Another encouraging trend is the growth in international sales,
he said. Hasbro, which does about one-third of its business abroad,
expects international sales to increase by more than 30 percent
this year, he said.
   Tyco Toys Inc., with 13 percent of its sales coming in foreign
countries, has a smaller international base but also hopes to
expand it quickly, said Richard E. Grey, chief executive officer of
the company.
   While Tyco expects its sales to grow by about 14 percent in the
next three years, it projects international growth at 30 percent
over the same period.
   At Mattel, which does about half of its business abroad,
international sales grew by 31 percent during the first three
quarters of 1990, compared with overall growth of 19 percent.
   Amerman said the company hopes to strengthen its foreign
business in the near future. In 1991, Mattel plans to introduce a
new line of Barbie dolls in conjunction with Bennetton, the Italian
apparel retailer.
   Mattel, which makes Disney toys, also hopes to see a boost in
business when a new Disneyland opens in Europe in 1992, he said.
   Amerman said Europe has about twice as many young children as
the United States, and while there might be less disposable income
in some European countries, the ``sheer weight of numbers assures
Mattel consistent growth in the early 1990s.''

<HEAD>Oryx Sells Some California Interests to Arco</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Oryx Energy Co. sold its interest in a central
California oilfield to Atlantic Richfield Co. for $642 million,
Oryx said Wednesday.
   The sale virtually completes a divestment program Oryx launched
to pay off the $1 billion debt it incurred in the September buyout
of its founding family.
   Oryx had paid $967.5 million, or $53.75 a share, for 18 million
shares of common stock owned by The Glenmede Trust Co., which
represents the Pew family of Philadelphia.
   Oryx will be able to reduce the debt by $545 million through the
deal with Arco. The sale of two other non-strategic assets has
yielded another $142 million for Oryx.
   ``These funds, coupled with substantial cash flow from
operations, will allow us to reach our billion-dollar debt
reduction target much sooner than planned,'' said Robert P.
Hauptfuhrer, chairman and chief executive officer of Dallas-based
Oryx, the world's largest independent oil and gas company.
   Arco is buying Oryx's interest in the Midway-Sunset field in
Kern County, Calif., which recently has produced 23,000 barrels a
day for Oryx. The company estimates the field's proven reserves at
140 million barrels.
   Arco will pay $588 million in cash and assume $54 million worth
of debt for the properties and related facilities, including
interest in a cogeneration plant.
   The sale of the oil property shifts the company's energy mix
closer to 50 percent crude oil and 50 percent natural gas, said
Oryx spokesman Tom Sullivan. Oryx has been decreasing its reliance
on crude oil for more than a year.

<HEAD>Business Execs Rank London the Top Business City in Europe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. and European businessmen rate London their
favorite European business center, a London firm of real estate
consultants said Wednesday.
   Businessmen interviewed in surveys in the United States and
Europe ranked London first in overall facilities and said it was
the city most likely to be the financial center of Europe five
years from now, said realtors Healey &amp; Baker.
   ``European senior management chooses London because of its easy
access to markets, first-class telecommunications and low cost of
quality labor,'' said senior partner Paul Orchard-Lisle.
   John Coppedge, a director at New York-based realtors Cushman and
Wakefield, which supervised the U.S. survey, said American
executives preferred London because of its ``traditional role as an
important financial center and the fact that English is the common
business language.''
   Orchard-Lisle said Paris scored high for quality of life and
beat London on transport infrastructure.
   Frankfurt, Germany, was considered the most likely future
manufacturing capital of Europe, and Brussels, the capital of
Belgium, was ranked No. 1 for languages spoken and availability of
office space, he said.
   Asked to predict future European centers of manufacturing,
politics and finance, those interviewed always mentioned Berlin in
the top three, he said. In the choice of a future political
capital, Berlin ranked second only to Brussels, home of the
European Commission, executive body of the 12-nation European
Community.
   The respondents said Amsterdam, Netherlands, had the best
government-created climate for business because of its tax policies
and financial incentives, while Glasgow, Scotland, ranked first in
value-for-money office space.
   Eastern European cities ranked low in both polls, but most
interviewees said the business climate there would improve,
Orchard-Lisle said. Berlin was considered the most promising,
followed by Moscow and Prague, the capital of Czechoslovakia.
   Coppedge said the U.S. survey showed 30 percent of major
American companies already have facilities in Europe.
   Among U.S. business executives, the 10 favorites were: London;
Frankfurt and Brussels (tie); Paris; Amsterdam; Geneva and Milan,
Italy (tie); Berlin; and Munich, Germany and Zurich, Switzerland
(tie).
   The U.S. survey, conducted by Harris Research, interviewed
senior managers in 400 firms across the United States, representing
a cross-section of major companies.
   The Europeans' top 10 cities were: London; Paris; Frankfurt;
Brussels; Amsterdam; Dusseldorf, Germany; Zurich; Geneva; Milan;
and Glasgow.
   The European survey, also by Harris, polled senior managers in
506 major firms in nine European countries.

<HEAD>Grain Futures Edge Higher on New Hope for Sales to Soviets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices rose Wednesday
on the Chicago Board of Trade amid speculation the Soviet Union
will use money borrowed from Saudi Arabia to buy U.S. grain.
   Grain markets also were supported by a report that President
Bush would ``take under advisement'' the issue of food export
credits to the Soviets, although some analysts viewed the situation
skeptically.
   On other commodity markets, livestock and meat futures fell, led
by a sharp drop in the pork markets; energy futures were mixed; and
precious metals were mixed.
   Wheat futures settled { cent to 3} cents higher with the
contract for delivery in December at $2.42} a bushel; corn was 2\
cents to 3 cents higher with December at $2.20{ a bushel; oats were
\ cent to { cent lower with December at $1.07 a bushel; soybeans
were 1 cent to 7 cents higher with January at $5.86{ a bushel.
   The rally began at the opening bell following overnight reports
that Saudi Arabia loaned the Soviet Union $4 billion. Some analysts
saw the loan as a way around the long-running U.S.-Soviet standoff
over food export credits.
   Traders figured the United States ``told the Saudis to loan them
$4 billion so the Soviets can come back here and buy the grain they
need to fulfill their obligations under the long-term grain
agreement,'' said John Frazier, director of agricultural trading
for Gerald Inc. in Chicago.
   The Soviet Union is required to buy about 1.2 million metric
tons of U.S. wheat and 600,000 metric tons of U.S. corn by the end
of the year to fulfull the current grain agreement.
   The Soviets say they can't buy the grain without U.S. credits,
but the United States has refused to grant credits until the
Soviets formally liberalize emigration policies to allow more Jews
to leave.
   A dearth of export sales to the Soviets and other traditional
customers has contributed to drop in U.S. wheat futures prices to
13-year lows.
   The grain markets also got a boost from reports attributed to
Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., that Bush said he would ``take under
advisement'' a request from a group of high-ranking senators to
provide U.S. export credits to the Soviets.
   Doug Jackson, grains analyst with Farmers Commodities Corp. in
Des Moines, Iowa, said volatility in the grain markets was likely
to continue until the question of credits is decided.
   ``We've been through this roller coaster almost daily for the
last three weeks and attitudes can change just as dramatically in
the morning,'' he said.
   Livestock and meat futures retreated on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, paced by a steep decline in the hog and pork belly
markets.
   The selling was centered in the hog pit and reflected
profit-taking and perceptions that cash hog prices likely will fall
Thursday because meatpackers picked up adequate supplies Wednesday,
said Phil Stanley, a Chicago-based consultant with DEC Futures Inc.
   Live hogs finished .35 cent to 1.32 cents lower with December at
51.32 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were 1.5 cents to the
permitted daily limit of 2 cents lower with February at 68.15 cents
a pound; live cattle were .20 cent to .58 cent lower with December
at 78.75 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .20 cent
lower with January at 87.35 cents a pound.
   Energy futures ended mostly higher on the New York Mercantile
Exchange. Heating oil led a late rally after the National Weather
Service issued a 90-day forecast projecting below-normal
temperatures in much of the eastern United States for December
through February.
   Analysts said prices also were bolstered by speculation the
United Nations Security Council will vote Thursday in favor of the
U.S.-backed resolution authorizing force to drive Iraq from Kuwait.
   Light sweet crude oil futures settled 31 cents to 44 cents
higher with January at $33.28 a barrel; heating oil was .65 cent to
1.22 cents higher with December at 82.70 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .97 cent lower to .20 cent higher with December at
83.75 cents a gallon; natural gas futures were 3.5 cents lower to
3.5 cents higher with January at $2.505 per 1,000 cubic feet.
   On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold futures finished 10 cents
to 30 cents lower with December at $385.70 a troy ounce; silver was
2.3 cents to 3.8 cents higher with December at $4.125 a troy ounce.

<HEAD>Dollar Rises on Greenspan Comments, Gold Narrowly Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar rose Wednesday on comments by Federal
Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan indicating that U.S. interest
rates would remain at their current levels.
   Gold prices were narrowly mixed.
   The dollar advanced after Greenspan voiced concerns to the House
Banking Committee about the dollar's recent weakness.
   But Greenspan also answered one of the market's big concerns
when he suggested no further interest rate cuts are likely soon.
   The dollar - like all currencies - is supported by higher
interest rates. When yields are up in this country, U.S.
investments become more attractive to foreigners who then buy
dollars to purchase the securities.
   The U.S. currency has fallen recently amid prospects that U.S.
rates would come down because of the weakening economy. The dollar
also has dropped as overseas rates moved higher and made foreign
currencies more valuable.
   Meanwhile, the pound fell Wednesday as traders feared that
British interest rates would soon decline under the incoming
government of John Major. Sterling advanced on Tuesday after
Major's selection as head of the Conservative Party, but concerns
about interest rates and some profit-taking turned the pound around
on Wednesday.
   Sterling dropped to $1.9695 in New York from late Tuesday's
$1.9775. In London earlier, the pound fell to $1.9723 from $1.9750
late Tuesday.
   The dollar jumped to 130.10 Japanese yen in New York from late
Tuesday's 128.35. In Tokyo overnight, the dollar fell to 128.90 yen
from 128.95 yen Tuesday, and in London, it rose to 129.02 yen.
   Richard Levine, a currency market analyst with Merrill Lynch &amp;
Co., said there are concerns in the market about the Japanese
economy, which he said could run into the same kind of debt
problems that the United States has encountered.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Tuesday's quotes, included: 1.4860 German marks, up from 1.48025;
1.2700 Swiss francs,uup from 1.12595; 5.0140 French francs, up from
4.9950; 1,118.10 Italian lire, up from 1,111.25; and 1.16445
Canadian dollars, up from 1.16405.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday's
rates, included: 1.4845 German marks, up from 1.4800; 1.2680 Swiss
francs, up from 1.2600; 5.0115 French francs, up from 4.9935;
1.6740 Dutch guilders, up from 1.6695; 1,116.00 Italian lire, up
from 1,109.75; and 1.1633 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1632.
   Gold was unchanged on the Commodity Exchange in New York,
closing at $385.20 a troy ounce. Republic National Bank later
quoted a bid of $384.70, down 30 cents.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $385.50 a troy ounce,
up from $384.75 dollars bid late Tuesday.
   In Zurich, the metal rose to a closing bid of $384.50, up from
$384.00 bid late Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $2.04 an ounce to close at a
bid $387.23.
   Silver rose 2.4 cents on the Commodity Exchange, closing at
$4.124 a troy ounce. But silver fell earlier in London to a late
bid price of $4.10, from $4.12 late Tuesday.

   The stock market showed little change Wednesday
in a choppy session that had traders balking at the uncertainties
of a sluggish economy and the Persian Gulf crisis.
   ``Everybody's afraid to make a step and have it be the wrong
one,'' said Danny Williams, head position trader at Dillon, Read &amp;
Co.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell near the close to
finish 8.66 points lower at 2,535.15, after trading slightly higher
through much of the day.
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by about 4 to 3 on the
New York Stock Exchange, with 843 up, 664 down and 496 unchanged.
Big Board volume totaled 145.49 million shares, against 147.59
million in the previous session.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 182.37 million shares.
   Traders were focusing on Federal Reserve Chairman Alan
Greenspan's remarks Wednesday that all but acknowledged the United
States was in a recession, as well as a pending U.N. Security
Council vote on Thursday that could authorize the use of force to
expel Iraq from Kuwait.
   Greenspan's observation of a ``meaningful downturn'' did not
alarm too many traders, because quite a few had already decided for
themselves that the United States is in a recession.
   But Hugh Johnson, senior vice president for First Albany Corp.,
said Greenspan's comments were encouraging as far as the interest
rate outlook was concerned. Nonetheless, he also noted the Fed has
given no clear indication that it intends to aggressively lower
rates to stimulate the economy in the near term.
   ``The Fed is going to be characteristically very measured ... in
changing monetary policy,'' Johnson said.
   Airline stocks were down, following news that a bankruptcy judge
had approved a $135 million cash infusion to keep Eastern Airlines
flying through the winter.
   ``One reason the airlines are easing here is Eastern Airlines
getting that money out of escrow,'' said Michael Metz, an analyst
with Oppenheimer &amp; Co. ``The hope was that Eastern would go out of
buiness, and this would help the remaining airlines get the rest of
the market.''
   AMR fell 1{ to 43}, Delta fell 2} to 53&rsqb; and UAL fell \ to 94~.
   Among actively traded issues, C.S. Sovran was up \ to 17&lsqb;, The

Instruments was up } to 31|, Philip Morris was down \ at 48| and
Waste Management was up } at 32|.
   Among the blue chips, IBM was down 1&lsqb; at 112&rsqb; and General
Electric was down ~ at 52|.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market rose $3.198 billion, or 0.11
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index rose .04 to 173.91.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell .22 to 372.84, and S&amp;P's
500-stock composite index fell .15 to 317.95.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market rose
.98 to 355.03. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index rose 1.97 to 298.97.

   Eastern Airlines officials claimed business surged
Wednesday after the carrier gained breathing room with a massive
cash infusion from a bankruptcy court escrow account.
   The leader of the striking Machinists union, meanwhile, urge
new talks to settle the union's 21-month-old strike.
   ``The phones are ringing off the hook. Consumers are viewing
this as a substantial vote of confidence,'' Eastern boss Martin
Shugrue said in New York, where a federal bankruptcy judge Tuesday
agreed to Shugrue's request to release up to $135 million from the
carrier's escrow fund.
   Calls to Eastern reservation offices, which had run at 100,000
calls a day recently, were running 5 percent higher Wednesday, said
Eastern spokesman Jim Ashlock. He said about 65 percent of the
calls were to book reservations, about 15 percent higher than
usual.
   ``Everybody in the reservations office is on a high right now,''
he said.
   Travel agents said the move had temporarily put aside consumer
worries about being stuck if the carrier folded. Shugrue said the
new money will ensure the carrier's operations through the end of
March, when he says Eastern will be ready to make a profit.
   ``Eastern is alive and well, thank you,'' said Henry Yaniz,
president of Hollywood Travel.
   Yaniz said his Eastern bookings were up nearly 20 percent after
falling about that much in the past two weeks.
   ``The reaction has been incredible,'' said Ashlock. ``For the
first time that a great many of us veteran people have seen in a
long time, people are rooting for us.''
   Shugrue plans a mass meeting with Eastern employees here
Thursday night and will exhort them to take advantage of the
opportunity the airline's been given.
   ``It's a Christmas present for everybody who works at Eastern,''
Ashlock said of U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland's decision.
``You can see what this enables us to do. It takes away the
uncertainty and gives us a chance to make good on what we know we
can do.''
   Less than two weeks ago, Shugrue had asked the court to release
$30 million, saying he would need an additional $50 million in two
payments through early January. The carrier's unsecured creditors
urged the judge to liquidate the airline instead.
   The judge agreed to give Eastern $15 million and another $15
million in early December, provided Eastern was keeping on track
with its business projections.
   But Eastern said in asking for even more money Tuesday that it
had suffered up to $70 million in damage from publicity surrounding
the creditors' move to have it closed. Among the problems cited by
Eastern were canceled reservations and a demand from American
Express that the airline deposit $10 million to cover any losses
that could occur if Eastern stopped flying.
   Shugrue argued that forcing Eastern to return periodically to
withdraw from its escrow account made the airline look as if it
could fail at any moment. Lifland agreed and even scolded the
creditors for hurting Eastern's business.
   Unsecured creditors nevertheless renewed their argument that the
carrier cannot become viable and the fund should not be depleted
further.
   The unsecured creditors, who include aircraft companies, banks,
labor unions and others owed an estimated $1 billion by Eastern,
are expected to meet soon to determine their next move, but no time
for the meeting had been set as of late Wednesday afternoon.
   ``There are a lot of broad options. I'm not in a position to
discuss them,'' lawyer Adam Harris said.
   Standard &amp; Poor's Corp., one of two major ratings agencies, said
the $135 million averts a short-term liquidity crisis for Eastern.
But long-term prospects remain poor due to weakening economy, high
fuel prices and industrywide fare promotions aimed at vacationers.
   ``Unsecured creditors, who had opposed the request by Eastern's
trustee, now have even less hope of recovering anything from any
future liquidation. The bankruptcy judge made it clear that `public
interest' and the interests of Eastern employees would take
precedence over claims of unsecured creditors in the attempted
reorganization,'' S&amp;P said.
   Eastern would have only an estimated $37 million available in
its escrow account after the current draw, but Shugrue said it
won't be needed. His ``corporate rate'' strategy, in which Eastern
has nearly doubled its first-class cabin space and offered business
travelers discount fares, is helping Eastern build up its passenger
base, he said.
   Eastern's unions had said they saw the break-up and sale of
Eastern in parts as their only hope for winning back their jobs.
   But on Wednesday, Machinists union leader Charles E. Bryan urged
Shugrue to try again to settle the strike that began March 4, 1989.
A nearly paralyzed Eastern filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy five
days later and has been losing $1 million to $2 million a day
since.
   Shugrue, appointed trustee by the court last April, said then
that achieving labor peace was a priority.
   ``It's a problem,'' Shugrue said, referring to continued pickets
by the Machinists. ``It's very frustrating to us that we have not
been able to put that matter to rest.''
   Bryan said with the added time Eastern's been given, Shugrue
could help the airline's market value by settling the strike.
   ``That would be a tremendous enhancement of the value of the
estate if we could get a contract settlement,'' Bryan said. ``It
does give us time to have a fully operational airline with some
time to meet and continue to get a negotiated settlement.''
   Ashlock said in discussions Shugrue has had with the unions, the
roadblock has been union insistence that replacement workers be
displaced, which Shugrue refuses to do.
   The Machinists, meanwhile, plan a large demonstration Saturday
at the Miami International Airport.

<HEAD>Oil Prices Waver Amid Doubts Over U.N. Resolution's Passage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID E. KALISH</BYLINE>

   Oil prices were up moderately Wednesday as
traders grew uncertain about passage of a United Nations proposal
authorizing the use of military force in the Persian Gulf.
   Light sweet crude settled up 42 cents a barrel at $33.28 for
January delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The contract
had been off by more than a dollar a barrel, largely in response to
comments by Chinese Foreign Minister Qian Qichen that his country
will not vote in favor of the resolution when it comes before the
U.N. Security Council on Thursdsay.
   ``It kind of takes some of the absoluteness out'' of the
resolution's passage, said Brian Tagler, an oil broker for Lehman
Brothers Inc. ``China appears to be the wild card.''
   Qichen refused to say whether China would veto the measure. A
unanimous vote is required to pass the proposal, under which Iraq
must withdraw its nearly half-million troops from occupied Kuwait
before Jan. 15 or face ``all necessary means'' to force them from
the emirate.
   Passage of the resolution is widely viewed as increasing the
likelihood of armed conflict in the Persian Gulf, which could
result in significant oil shortages.
   However, traders said the market turned bullish again on reports
that U.S. officials were reiterating that the Chinese have promised
not to oppose the resolution.
   ``It was a fairy low-volume day - it didn't take too much action
in the pit to move prices,'' said Bob Baker, senior energy analyst
at Prudential-Bache Securities.
   Also adding some strength to the market was the release late
Tuesday of figures from the American Petroleum Institute shwwing a
lower-than-expected domestic stockpile of crude oil.
   Contracts for delivery of crude in later months also settled
higher.
   Home heating oil for December settled 1.22 cents higher at 92.71
cents a gallon. Some traders said it was lifted by a forecast for
decidedly colder weather this winter, while other analysts noted
regional weakness in the nation's stockpile of heating oil that
showed up in Tuesday's API report.
   Unleaded gasoline for December settled down .97 cent at 83.75
cents a gallon, with other delivery months mixed.
   Natural gas for January settled down 3.5 cents to $2.505 per
1,000 cubic feet.

<HEAD>Reportedly Discloses Loss of $66 Million in Latest Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   R.H. Macy &amp; Co. Inc. has told creditors it lost
$66 million in the first fiscal quarter, nearly twice the
retailer's loss of a year earlier, published reports said
Wednesday.
   The disclosure indicated the privately owned company is having
the same troubles as other retailers whose sales and profits have
been hurt by the weakening economy and eroding consumer confidence.
   It also indicated Macy, which already has an enormous debt, is
under increased pressure during this critical Christmas season.
   The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times, citing a
confidential memo Macy reportedly circulated to creditors and
potential investors, said the retailer lost $66 million in the
three months ended Oct. 31, compared with a $33.1 million in the
same period a year earlier.
   The memo reportedly said Macy's sales fell 9.5 percent to $1.55
billion in the latest quarter from $1.71 billion a year earlier.
   Maureen Burgess, a Macy spokeswoman, said she could not confirm
the report or comment on it.
   Macy's first quarter began Aug. 1, the day before the Middle
East crisis erupted and sent oil prices sharply higher. Sales at
most of the nation's big retailers slumped immediately as consumers
found themselves with less money to spend on clothing, furniture
and appliances - the core business of stores like Macy.
   Macy is not alone in a poor showing for the quarter - several
big publicly-held major retailers reported their profits fell
during the period. However, Macy is under more pressure than other
companies because of its enormous interest payments.
   The company still has $5 billion in debt following its $3.74
billion leveraged buyout in 1986 and its 1988 acquisition of the
Bullock's and the I. Magnin store chains in California.
   Macy has come under sharp scrutiny since it lost $39 million in
its second quarter a year ago, which included a disastrous
Christmas season. The company was forced to reduce its prices
sharply to compete with other retailers, and its earnings suffered.
   The Journal said potential investors briefed by Macy were told
the retailer expects to do better for the rest of fiscal 1991,
which ends July 31, and that it has ample cash to meet its needs.
   The period covered in the latest earnings report is not
considered as crucial to retailers as the current quarter which
includes Christmas gift sales. However, retailers and economists
are expecting this to be a difficult holiday season, because
consumers are still hesitant to spend freely with a recession and
possible Middle East war looming.
   The company has been seeking an infusion of equity to retire
some of its high-yield ``junk'' bonds which are selling at
depressed prices. It has also sold off its credit operations to
remove $1.5 billion in debt from its balance sheet.
   Like many other retailers, it has slashed its inventory levels,
hoping to avoid a repeat of 1989's devastating Christmas markdowns.
   Besides its flagship Macy stores, located mainly in the East and
Texas, and I. Magnin and Bullock's, the retailer also owns
specialty stores including Charter Club, Fantasies by Morgan Taylor
and Aeropostale, which are stocked with Macy's private label
apparel brands.

<HEAD>Judge Asks Lawyers To Caluclate Amount of Milken Fraud</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A federal judge Wednesday asked lawyers for the
government and Michael Milken to calculate the total amount of
fraud in Milken's crimes to help authorities determine how much
prison time he must serve.
   Federal parole officials need an estimate to recommend when
Milken will be eligible for parole, and the number could affect the
length of incarceration by more than two years.
   U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood last week sentenced the formerDrexel
Burnham Lambert Inc. financier to 10 years in prison for six
felony counts related to illegal securities trading.
   At a hearing in Manhattan federal court Wednesday, Wood said
because of the nature of Milken's crimes it was not easy to
calculate losses to victims. She said the parole commission ``never
had anything like this in mind.''
   While the parole commission makes its own calculation on such
losses, Wood said she wants to present officials with a number
agreeable to both sides.
   Under parole guidelines, a first offender such as Milken would
face a minimum prison term of 24 months to 36 months if victims'
losses ranged from $200,000 to $1 million. If the fraud exceeds $1
million, Milken's recommended prison term before parole would equal
40 months to 52 months. But the parole commission is not bound by
the guidelines.
   Milken attorney Arthur Liman said at the hearing that he
believed the amount would not exceed $1 million. Wood scheduled a
Dec. 6 hearing on the matter.
   As part of his plea deal, Milken agreed to pay $200 million in
criminal fines and penalties and place $400 million into a fund to
compensate investors hurt by his crimes. But that figure does not
constitute an estimate of losses.
   Milken's lawyers have 10 days from the date the sentence
judgment was entered formally in U.S. District Court to appeal the
10-year term. Court officials said the sentence judgment was to
occur Wednesday, after Judge Wood allocated $1.5 million as a
criminal fine and the remainder of the $200 million as a penalty,
completing details of the sentencing.
   Liman declined to comment on a published report Wednesday that
he planned to appeal the sentence and was considering asking
Harvard University law professor Lawrence Tribe to argue the
appeal.
   An appeal would delay the 120 days from sentencing during which
Milken's lawyers can request a reduction in the prison term based
on his cooperation with prosecutors. But Milken still would be
required to report to federal custody on March 4, as Wood ordered.

   Federal prosecutors joined a
``whistleblower'' lawsuit accusing two Teledyne Inc. subsidiaries
of padding defense contracts by up to 40 percent, robbing taxpayers
of tens of millions of dollars a year for nearly a decade.
   Teledyne hid its true cost estimates in green folders and
submitted grossly inflated estimates to the government in white
folders, according to the suit, which was unsealed Tuesday in
federal court.
   Top managers directed the deception, the lawsuit alleges.
   Teledyne spokesman Berkley J. Baker didn't return telephone
calls requesting comment. The company is expected to answer the
complaint in 30 to 60 days.
   The lawsuit was filed in May 1989 by Klaus Kirchhoff, who worked
as a senior pricing specialist at Teledyne Systems Co. from May to
September 1988.
   Teledyne Systems, with annual sales of up to $300 million,
builds military computers, navigation systems and radar jamming
gear. It is now separately incorporated from Teledyne Inc., but was
a division of the parent conglomerate at the time. Both are named
as defendants.
   The suit was filed under the Federal False Claims Act, which
allows citizens to seek damages on behalf of the government.
   As customary in such cases, the suit was kept secret while the
Justice Department looked into the claims. It was unsealed because
the government decided last week to become a plaintiff and help
pursue it.
   ``There was a very long investigation by the government,'' said
Leon Dayan, one of Kirchhoff's lawyers. ``The government has joined
entirely in our complaint.''
   U.S. Attorney Lourdes G. Baird issued a statement saying the
government will later file its own complaint, ``but in joining the
lawsuit it agrees generally with the whistleblowers' allegations of
how Teledyne has defrauded the United States.''
   The allegations in Kirchhoff's suit don't specify how much the
government lost. Dayan said it still wasn't clear, although it
could reach into the hundreds of illions of dollars.
   Under the False Claims Act, if Teledyne is found liable, it can
be required to repay three times the amount of the overcharges and
pay substantial civil fines as well.
   Kirchhoff would be entitled to 15 percent to 25 percent of the
trebled damages.
   The alleged false claims occurred under negotiated sole-source
contracts or subcontracts, in which there is no price competition.
To ensure a fair price for the work done, the contractor is
required to provide true estimates of its work costs. Then a fair
profit is built into the final price.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Marianne K. Smythe, executive assistant to
Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Richard Breeden, was
appointed head of the SEC division that oversees the mutual fund
industry on Wednesday.
   Ms. Smythe was among three appointments to senior positions
announced by Breeden.
   Barbara J. Green was named to succeed Ms. Smythe as executive
assistant to the chairman and Richard M. Humes, was promoted from
assistant general counsel to associate general counsel for
litigation.
   Ms. Smythe, of Chevy Chase, Md., was appointed earlier this year
as the senior legal and policy adviser in the chairman's office.
She will now oversee the Division of Investment Management, which
oversees more than 3,500 investment companies that manage more than
$1 trillion in total assets.
   She succeeds Kathryn B. McGrath, who headed the division for
seven years before leaving the SEC in June to join a Washington law
firm.
   Ms. Smythe, a New York City native, is a 1974 graduate of the
University of North Carolina's law school. She first joined the SEC
in 1976, serving in the divisions of enforcement, market regulation
and investment management.
   From 1981 to 1987 she was a faculty member of the University of
North Carolina and returned to the SEC in 1988.
   Ms. Green, of Washington, D.C., was named counselor to the
chairman earlier this year. A native of Madison, Conn. and 1978
graduate of Boston College Law School, she joined the SEC staff in
1986.
   In addition to advisory role as executive assistant to the
chairman, she will coordinate the work of the various divisions and
offices of the SEC.
   Humes, a native of Washington, D.C., now living in Silver
Spring, Md., joined the commission as a staff attorney in 1977 and
has been an assistant general counsel since 1982. A 1976 graduate
of Howard University School of Law, he will head the office that
defends the SEC against lawsuits and brings administrative
proceedings against lawyers and accountants who practice before the
commission.

stock Aug. 9. That increased the Scandinavian line's share of
Continental to 16.8 percent. SAS also paid $21 million for Jet
Capital, which owns a large share of Continental and had been 80
percent owned by Lorenzo and its other directors.
   Continental Holdings spokesman Art Kent said the company has

<TEXT>
   Maxwell Communications Corp. PLC, the British
publishing group, Wednesday reported a 5.9 percent rise in pretax
profit for the six months that ended Sept. 30.
   The group said in a press release that pretax profit in the six
months was 90.1 million pounds, or $177.5 million, up from 85.1
million pounds, or $167.6 million, a year earlier.
   Net profit attributable to shareholders was 64.7 million pounds,
or $127.46 million, up from 34.8 million pounds, or $68.6 million,
a year earlier.
   The sharp improvement partly reflected a one-time charge of 29.5
million pounds, or $58.11 million, that was recorded in same period
last year for the disposal of printing activities. Maxwell
Communications didn't report any non-recurring items in this year's
six-month period.
   Operating profit was 130.4 million pounds, or $256.9 million,
down from 134.1 million, or $264.1 million, in the same period last
year.
   The group also announced an increase in its interim dividend to
7 pence a share from 6.5 pence. Analysts had been expecting the
dividend to be unchanged.
