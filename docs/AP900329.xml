   President Bush joked to an audience of radio
and television correspondents Thursday night that he got even with
the Iranians for a phony phone call from President Hashemi
Rafsanjani.
   ``Your broadcasts hit me pretty hard a while back about a guy
claiming to be Rafsanjani _ a little confusion with the phone
call,'' Bush told the broadcasters.
   ``Today I got him back. Called him up and asked if he had Prince
Abdul in a can,'' said Bush to laughter from the crowd of more than
2,000. ``But then I forgot how to say, `Let him out,' in Farsi.''
   Bush said he had also got a call from a ``very upset'' Lech
Walesa, the Solidarity leader.
   ``He heard me say at the last press conference that I have no
faith in polls,'' the president quipped.
   The annual black-tie dinner of the Radio and Television
Correspondents Association drew leaders of Congress and top
administration officials as well as broadcast executives and
journalists.
   For the second time in five nights, the president and Barbara
Bush watched impressionist Jim Morris do his send-up of Bush,
Ronald Reagan and other politicians.
   The Bushes had originally planned to leave before Morris' act,
but they decided to stay.
   ``There's something in the Constitution about cruel and unusual
punishment. But we had planned to leave, but I want to hear this
thing one more time,'' said Bush. ``Barbara likes his act.''
   Then, mocking his own disjuncted speaking style that Morris and
other mimics love to imitate, Bush said, ``I'll be honest. He's
good _ too good. That's as far as I'll go. Not going to comment.
Not going to criticize Jim Morris at this juncture. Wouldn't be
prudent.''
   The Bushes laughed along with most of the jokes told by Morris
and talk show host Larry King, who served as interlocutor.
   Reporters asked Mrs. Bush, walking pet dog Millie upon her
return to the White House, if she had had her fill of Jim Morris
yet.
   ``Haven't you?'' she replied.

<HEAD>Plutonium Contamination Cleanup to Start at Rocky Flats</HEAD>

   Colorado's governor on Thursday urged the Energy
Department not to reopen Rocky Flats until it has solved a safety
problem that left the nuclear weapons plant's air ducts clogged
with 62 pounds of plutonium.
   The amount of lost plutonium, a deadly carcinogenic poison,
stunned environmentalists monitoring the plant northeast of Denver.
Rocky Flats was shut down by the Department of Energy late last
year because of safety and management problems.
   ``I have some comfort that the plant now is shut down,'' Gov.
Roy Romer said Thursday. ``And, it should not be restarted unless
they cure this problem. The buildup of plutonium in ductwork has
been known since last summer and the State of Colorado has been
urging DOE to take strong action to correct the problem.''
   DOE spokesman Pat Etchart said late Thursday that the department
will address Romer's concerns. ``We're going to continue to
evaluate this data.''
   He said it did not appear the issue would affect the plant's
plutonium processing operations, scheduled to resume in June, but
that would be decided as part of the continuing evaluation.
   A DOE official said Wednesday that crews might not finish
cleaning up the plutonium-clogged air ducts before opening.
   ``I don't know if all the activity will be completed prior to
restart. But if there are any safety questions, the energy
secretary won't order restart,'' Catherine Kaliniak, a Department
of Energy spokeswoman, said Wednesday.
   But an environmentalist who has been monitoring the situation
for the governor says news of the amount of plutonium contamination
illustrates the need for a review of safeguards against an
explosion at the plant.
   If enough plutonium gathers in one spot, it can reach
criticality, the point a nuclear chain reaction could take place.
Plant officials have said the amount in the ducts does not threaten
an accidental chain reaction.
   Melinda Kassen, an attorney for the Boulder-based Environmental
Defense Fund, had raised questions as a member of Gov. Roy Romer's
Rocky Flats monitoring council about the amount of plutonium in the
air ducts.
   ``Operations should not be restarted until they can make sure
they're not going to have those releases in the future,'' Ms.
Kassen said.
   EG&amp;G Inc., the Wellesley, Mass.-based contractor that operates
the plant for the federal government, gave her the figure of 28
kilograms, or 62 pounds, on Wednesday. That amount is enough to
build six to seven nuclear bombs, but officials said it did not
pose a threat to workers or residents.
   ``We think the figure of 28 kilograms is pretty solid,'' said
Bill Heimbach, an EG&amp;G spokesman. ``We have a lot more measurements
to do before we can restart.''
   EG&amp;G had been studying the matter since federal inspectors
estimated in October that up to 15 kilograms, or 33 pounds, may be
in the 4,000 feet of glovebox exhaust ducts at the nation's only
plant for making plutonium triggers for nuclear weapons.
   Technicians handle the deadly radioactive material with gloves
attached to arm coverings in sealed gloveboxes.
   Last fall, federal inspectors said employees did not maintain
air filters in the gloveboxes. That could have allowed plutonium
dust to escape into the air ducts, the inspectors theorized.
   Rocky Flats, the only plant that makes plutonium triggers, is
the target of a criminal probe into allegations of illegal
hazardous waste handling. A federal grand jury has been convened to
consider evidence gathered in a raid at the plant last June 7, but
no charges have been handed up.
   Federal investigators have found a variety of safety and
management problems at the 16 major facilities in 12 states
involved in making nuclear weapons, and some have led to production
shutdowns and interruptions.
   The problems include a lawsuit by Ohio residents who say they
were harmed by radioactive spills from the Fernald plant near
Cincinnati, poor training of safety inspectors at the Hanford
Nuclear Reservation, near Richland, Wash., and the Savannah River
Site, near Aiken, S.C., and inadequate fire protection at Savannah
River.

   A woman fleeing an angry boyfriend was thrown 50
feet from the car she was riding in, crashed through a shingled
roof and landed feet first on a refrigerator, authorities said.
   ``She got up, walked into my living room and lay down on my
couch,'' said Syble Cherry, owner of the home Denise Williams
crashed through on Tuesday.
   ``I don't see how she even walked. I guess anything is
possible,'' Cherry said.
   Williams, 27, suffered fractures to both wrists and her left
ankle and had extensive cuts and bruises. She was in fair condition
Wednesday at Mount Carmel Mercy Hospital.
   ``All she said was, `I need some help and I need it quick.' I
was shocked,'' said Cherry's son, Oscar Cooper.
   Williams was riding in a Ford Escort that was hit by the car
driven by her irate boyfriend, said Police Officer Thomas
Martinelli. He said the Escort sideswiped a tree, spun and hit a
curb when Williams was flung out of the passenger door and into the
air.
   It was undetermined if Williams was wearing a seat belt, police
said.
   ``The car hit a curb and witnesses say it rolled over numerous
times before the woman was thrown from the vehicle,'' Martinelli
said.
   The car then slammed into Cherry's brick house.
   The driver of the Escort was not seriously hurt, Martinelli
said. Police planned to charge the boyfriend, who was in custody,
with felonious assault with a moving vehicle.
   Cherry said it was the second time in less than year that a car
crashed into her house, which is second from the corner.
   ``I still have it in my mind to move out. I'll never be able to
lay down in the living room and relax and watch TV. I'd be too
nervous,'' she said.

   A sort of purplish-pink mauve officials hope
will soothe tempers and blunt aggression has been painted on the
walls of the Polk County Jail's new booking area.
   ``If it reduces aggression, fine,'' said Sheriff Lawrence W.
Crow Jr. `If it has an opposite effect, then we would consider
changing. But we feel like it will work well.''
   Crow said Tuesday the length of time the color affects inmates
waiting to be booked may not be long. Some studies suggest only
about 30 minutes, he said.
   ``Several jails have tried this in their book-in area,'' Crow
said. ``I have read about it in publications and it seemed to be
working well where they have tried it.''
   Psychologist Dr. Joyce Brothers, however, is doubtful the color
will produce the desired effect.
   ``Most people are so emotional when they are booked in, whether
they are guilty or innocent, I don't think the background color
could make that much of a difference,'' she said in a telephone
interview from New York.

<HEAD>Bar's Name Changed from Russian to Lithuanian Lady</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Lithuanian-born tavern owner is so
upset about his compatriots' quest for freedom that he changed the
name of his popular downtown haunt from Russian Lady to Lithuanian
Lady.
   ``It may not affect much, but whatever I can do is important,''
said John Rimscha, who came to the United States in 1955.
   Rimscha on Tuesday had the name painted over the bar's facade
and ordered his staff to pour the bar's Russian vodka down the
drain. He did the same thing in 1983 when a Soviet fighter shot
down Korean Air Lines Flight 007. Then, he changed the bar's name
to American Lady to protest the incident.
   Rimscha, 46, said the tavern's new name will stay at least until
Lithuanians obtain their independence, an event he's sure will
occur.
   ``How could they possibly not succeed?'' he said. ``They are
such determined people. They've been fighting for the last 50 years
for their freedom.''
   He said when that happens, he'll consider returing his bar to
its original name. ``But it's more than likely that I'll stay with
the Lithuanian Lady, since I'm of Lithuanian descent.''

<HEAD>Last Experiment Removed from Rescued Satellite</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   NASA technicians have removed the
last experiment from a scientific satellite that was rescued in
January after nearly six years in space and survived far better
than expected.
   ``It really looks like brand new,'' said William Kinard, chief
scientist for the Long Duration Exposure Facility, or LDEF.
   ``The surprising thing to us is although there was a lot of
weathering apparent on the outside, most of that weathering was
really only skin-deep,'' he said Wednesday, a day after the last
experiment tray was removed.
   The satellite's condition is so good, in fact, it demonstrates
long-lasting space facilities such as the Freedom manned space
station are feasible, Kinard said.
   The proposed space station has come under attack in recent weeks
because of a Johnson Space Center study that concludes an unusually
high number of astronaut spacewalks would be needed for
maintenance. By the time it's completed and manned in 1999, the
space station is expected to cost more than $30 billion.
   ``It (LDEF) certainly gives you a great deal of confidence in
the ability to build things like space station and any spacecraft
that has to function for a long period of time,'' Kinard said.
``With reasonable care, there's no reason why you can't get
extremely long lifetimes.''
   The laboratory was placed in orbit in April 1984 for an expected
10 months. Because of delays, however, the satellite was not
retrieved until January, when astronauts aboard the shuttle
Columbia snared it 200 miles out in space.
   It is the longest time a spacecraft has been in space before
being retrieved for study.
   Barring a rescue, the $15 million to $18 million laboratory
would have come crashing down through the atmosphere right about
now and all 57 scientific experiments attached to its exterior
would have been lost. If not for gravity, the structure could have
lasted many more years in space although some of the experiments
may have decayed, Kinard said.
   None of the experiments were lost as a result of the satellite's
unexpectedly long stay in space. Some even were enhanced because of
the additional exposure, Kinard said.
   Most of the experimental trays have been returned to their
principal investigators for further analysis, including one
involving 12.5 million tomato seeds. The seeds were sent into space
for eventual planting by school students.
   Those seeds currently are being distributed to schools around
the country so students can monitor the growth process and report
the findings to NASA.
   Now that LDEF is empty, technicians plan to spend the next few
weeks inspecting the 8,000-pound aluminum shell then pack it for
storage at Kennedy Space Center. The laboratory was designed to be
reusable and could venture into space again, Kinard said.
   ``It is worth keeping,'' he said.

<TEXT>
   A mysterious skin disorder that has
children in two states ``scratching the skin off their arms'' has
prompted school closings and protests from frustrated parents,
officials said.
   The rash, which varies from a minor skin irritation to inflamed
bumps, has appeared on the necks, arms and backs of students in
Jackson and Doddridge counties in West Virginia and in McDowell,
Ky., officials said Wednesday.
   ``We're looking for a pattern and we can't establish one,'' said
Loretta Haddy, an epidemiologist with the West Virginia Department
of Health. ``Unless it really starts getting out of control, we're
just assuming it's a viral rash.''
   Teacher Brenda Hamilton of McDowell, where dozens of students
suffered rashes, said the children's skin looked ``like they'd been
scalded with water.''
   ``Children were literally scratching the skin off their arms,''
said James Bennett, school superintendent in Doddridge County in
north-central West Virginia.
   At Gilmore Elementary School in Sandyville in west-central West
Virginia, 50 students reported suffering from the rash, according
to schools Superintendent C.L. Staats.
   Jackson County Health Department and private doctors who
examined the children gave different diagnoses, Staats said.
   Some said the rash was Fifth Disease, a minor childhood skin
disorder. Others classified it as ``contact dermatitis.''
   The Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta tested blood samples
taken from the Kentucky youths and ruled out Fifth Disease, the
health officials said last week.
   Jackson and Doddridge counties are not adjacent to each other.
Neither is adjacent to McDowell, in eastern Kentucky near the West
Virginia border.
   Parents kept more than 450 elementary and high school students
home on Tuesday in McDowell, and about 40 people held a protest
over officials' inability to identify the rash, which first
appeared in the small town March 12.
   Protest leader Brenda Cook, 34, said parents were afraid because
no one knew anything about the rash, or its long-term effect. She
said they wanted the school closed until the problem has been
identified.
   ``It's something in the air _ or inside that school,'' Cook said.
   Jane Bond, a health adviser for the Floyd County Health
Department, said: ``It's upsetting the parents, but we really don't
have any answers for them yet.''
   Examinations in West Virginia showed no pattern and gave no
indication the school environment was causing the rash, said Herb
Loy, director of immunization for the West Virginia Department of
Health.
   Gilmore Elementary School was closed Friday so that biological
and environmental testing could be done to see if the school was
causing the problem, Staats said.
   It is expected to remain closed for at least two weeks, pending
the release of the test results, he said.
   In Doddridge County, officials said 20 fourth-graders at Big
Isaac Elementary School broke out in rashes in January and February.
   Most of the children are back to normal but have been moved to
the school gymnasium to isolate them from others, Bennett said.

   Hundreds of chanting AIDS activists besieged
the state Capitol on Wednesday, wrapping parts of the historic
building in red tape and chanting slogans. Police arrested 80
people.
   The demonstrators blocked entrances to the Capitol and marched
through the hallways to pre-selected areas where they fell to the
floor or otherwise disrupted government operations.
   Police dragged dozens of demonstrators away to waiting paddy
wagons. Some had handcuffed themselves together, and police used
bolt-cutters to separate them.
   By the time police escorted the last demonstrator into a waiting
bus Wednesday evening, there were 80 arrests. Most were charged
with disorderly conduct, said said Thomas Tubbs, spokesman for the
state Office of General Services.
   One man was charged with harrassment for pushing a police
officer and a woman was charged with criminal mischief for
spray-painting slogans on the Capitol steps, Tubbs said.
   No police were injured. One arrested demonstrator was treated at
a hospital for a head injury and released, Tubbs said.
   Earlier, members of the New York City-based AIDS Coalition to
Unleash Power, or ACT UP, picketed the Executive Mansion. They
shouted down Gov. Mario Cuomo when he tried to speak to them.
   ``We're closing down this Capitol,'' Walter Kawandler of New
York City, said as he and about two dozen others sprawled on the
floor outside the state Senate chamber and wrapped themselves in
more red tape.
   The AIDS activists are seeking, among other things, more state
money for AIDS treatment and prevention programs. They used yards
and yards of the red tape to protest what they said was a
slow-moving government bureaucracy in the face of AIDS deaths, said
ACT UP's Leslie Feinberg.
   Outside the Capitol, demonstrators banged drums loudly and
splattered red paint on marble steps. They taunted police,
chanting, ``the whole world is watching,'' as protesters were
carried away. Several state troopers wore rubber gloves.
   Some state officials tried to carry on a normal day amid the
chaos. The Assembly and Senate met behind heavily guarded doors.
Tour guides led groups of schoolchildren through the hallways.
   The demonstration began shortly before noon outside Cuomo's
state-owned mansion several blocks from the Capitol. There were
about 700 people involved, said Albany Police Chief John Dale.
   At one point, Democrat Cuomo stepped outside to speak with the
protesters, saying they should ask Republican legislators to help
raise taxes to pay for new AIDS programs.
   ``I asked you to prod the whole system,'' said Cuomo. ``I'm not
the only one in the system. To be objective, you have to prod the
whole system.''
   Cuomo's comments were soon drowned out by activists chanting
``Programs, not promises,'' and ``Shame, shame, shame.''
   The governor eventually left.
   The state has budgeted $200 million for AIDS programs as part of
the current state budget. Cuomo has proposed raising that to $266
million for the fiscal year that begins Sunday.

   Former boxing champion Marvelous Marvin
Hagler and his wife, Bertha, have agreed to a divorce settlement.
   Neither Hagler, 35, nor his wife would reveal details of the
agreement, which was reached Tuesday. Their seven-year marriage
will end officially in three months. Bertha Hagler had been seeking
a $4 million settlement.
   ``I'm glad it's all over,'' Hagler said as he left the courtroom.
   Bertha Hagler, 36, had testified the former champion hit her in
the face and punched her in the ribs hard enough to make her knees
buckle in 1987, the year he lost the middleweight title to Sugar
Ray Leonard. Hagler denied striking his wife.
   Hagler won the middleweight title in 1980 when he knocked out
Alan Minter in the third round. He has not fought since he lost the
championship in 1987 in a 12-round decision.

   Tennis star Billie Jean King and politician
Barbara Jordan will be two of the next four members of the National
Women's Hall of Fame.
   The four were chosen from a field of about 1,000 nominees, Sally
Parr, the hall's executive director, said Wednesday.
   The four are:
   _The late Margaret Bourke-White, a photojournalist who worked
for Life and Fortune magazines.
   _King, who was ranked the No. 1 women's tennis player four times
in her career and is the first woman athlete to earn more than
$100,000 in a year.
   _Florence Siebert, a medical researcher who in the 1930s
isolated and purified protein, paving the way for an accurate test
for tuberculosis.
   _Jordan, a Texas Democrat who served in Congress from 1972
through 1978. She was the first woman and the first black to give
the keynote address at a national political convention.
   The four will be inducted into the hall in Seneca Falls, N.Y.,
on Aug. 26.

   Andrew Dice Clay's ex-wife is seeking $3
million in a palimony suit against the foul-mouthed comedian.
   The suit filed Wednesday by divorce attorney Marvin Mitchelson
seeks half of Clay's property holdings, which Mitchelson estimated
at $6 million.
   Kathy Swanson, Clay's former wife, claims their 1986 divorce
settlement granting her $18,000 in alimony defrauded her of half
the couple's accumulated possessions.
   ``She was basically supporting him,'' Mitchelson said of the
couple's relationship, which spanned five years of living together
and two years of marriage. ``He agreed when he hit it big that they
would share the proceeds.''
   The complaint also alleged that Clay threatened Swanson with
violence if she contested their divorce.
   Neither Clay's manager nor his publicist returned phone calls.
   Clay's expletive-laden routines have prompted record stores to
yank his recordings. He was banned from the MTV cable network after
uttering an obscenity during a live broadcast of the 1989 Music
Video Awards.

   Dar Robinson was one of the greatest stunt
men of all time, actor Danny Glover told a jury in a lawsuit
stemming from Robinson's death when a stunt went wrong in the
Arizona desert.
   Glover, who saw Robinson work his stunt magic in the film
``Lethal Weapon,'' was called as a witness Wednesday by attorney
Jerry Kroll, who represents Robinson's family in a
multimillion-dollar suit against Dino De Laurentis Entertainment
Group and Productions Ltd.
   Kroll maintains that Robinson died because an ambulance was
unavailable at the remote desert location where he had a motorcycle
accident while filming ``Million Dollar Mystery'' in 1986.
   DEG and Productions Ltd. maintain there was no ambulance on the
set because Robinson felt it was ``bad luck'' and an insult to his
stunt abilities to have one around.
   But Glover, who referred to Robinson as ``one of the greatest
stunt men ever,'' testified that an ambulance and fire engines were
present when Robinson executed a dangerous stunt on the set of
``Lethal Weapon'' earlier in 1986.

   He doesn't wear a badge, but Mayor
Sonny Bono figures he has enough moral authority to chase down
speeding motorcyclists.
   Straddling his black Harley-Davidson last weekend, his honor
spotted a motorcyclist rocket through an intersection on Palm
Canyon Drive, the main thoroughfare in the desert resort 100 miles
east of Los Angeles.
   ``I chased him down,'' Bono said Tuesday. ``He said something
about not being able to read my shirt, and I told him, `You'd
better learn to read real fast unless you want to spend the night
in jail.'''
   That's when the young rider noticed ``Mayor Sonny Bono'' printed
on Bono's T-shirt. The mayor, who became famous singing ``I Got You
Babe'' with ex-wife Cher, got his man.
   ``We have had hundreds of those bullet bikes come in in the last
three years,'' the mayor said. ``If they want to behave, fine. But
most just go screaming through here.''

   Congress favors limiting production of the B-2
bomber, says a senator who predicts that recent estimates of $155
billion to buy and operate the stealth aircraft will cause
``sticker stupefaction.''
   ``I think the consensus for capping production is there this
year. Whether it's there to terminate the program is too early to
say,'' Sen. William Cohen, R-Maine, said Wednesday of the
radar-evading plane.
   Cohen spoke at a news conference where the Union of Concerned
Scientists released a report that questioned the mission of the
stealth bomber and Air Force estimates on its cost.
   The service has said its planned fleet of 132 bombers will cost
slightly more than $70 billion. But the science group, which is
frequently critical of Pentagon programs, said the price of the
plane more than doubles if operation and maintenance costs are
included.
   ``The B-2 force would probably cost in the neighborhood of $155
billion or more to acquire, operate and support for 25 years,''
said the group's report.
   Cohen said figures reported by the Union of Concerned Scientists
``will not simply be sticker shock but perhaps even sticker
stupefaction.''
   Michael Brower, author of the report, said the expense of fuel,
spares, personnel, tanker aircraft and other items significantly
increases the cost of the radar-evading plane.
   ``We do not see a compelling need for the B-2 bomber,'' Brower
said. ``Its major missions that have been announced are either not
credible or they can be handled more cheaply by other types of
weapons such as air-launched cruise missiles.''
   Air Force Secretary Donald Rice said recently that the purchase
cost of the B-2 bomber probably will be closer to $75 billion when
inflation is included. In addition, the service has said it will
need more than $1 billion for special climate-control hangars for
the planes.
   Cohen, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee who last
year voted to terminate the B-2 program, said support among his
colleagues for the bat-winged plane is decreasing.
   ``I'm not sure the votes are there to terminate the program, but
I think there is an emerging concern that has been expressed to me
by other members of the Armed Services Committee about the cost and
indeed the mission,'' Cohen said.
   In the House, Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, said this week he has
obtained at least 130 cosponsors for an amendment that would
terminate the B-2 program.
   Priced at more than $530 million a copy, the bomber is
considered the most expensive plane in history. Members of Congress
expressed shock over the cost last year and withheld funds for one
less plane than the Pentagon sought in the current defense budget.
   In the $307 billion defense budget for fiscal 1991, President
Bush has proposed spending $5.5 billion for five B-2 bombers.

   Horst Bauernsachs looks at the
blackened, prewar factory buildings where outdated Trabant cars are
built and says, ``It can only get better.''
   ``I may well wind up unemployed for a time, but that's not the
end of the world,'' says the 47-year-old forklift driver, one of
11,500 workers at the plant. ``I'll just have to look around. We
won't starve.''
   Optimism prevails at the Sachsenring plant. Even though many of
its workers are likely to lose their jobs, they are looking forward
to the promise of Western-style prosperity once Germany is united
in a free-market economy.
   Volkswagen, West Germany's largest car maker, has signed a
nearly $3 billion deal to build models for the Western market at
the plant, which dates back to 1904 and uses virtually no
automation.
   Modernization will mean layoffs in a workforce accustomed to
making the Trabant, a plastic-body compact of 1957 vintage with a
sputtering two-cylinder engine.
   At the same time, chassis welding foreman Dieter Blank says
approaching capitalism has already raised morale and removed some
notorious aspects of the state-planned economy.
   ``We had considerable problems with discipline in the past, but
they've drastically gone down,'' says Blank, 39.
   ``Right now, all of us are fighting for our jobs. The workers
know that VW will only pick the best.''
   Trabants became a symbol of freedom last summer when East
Germans drove them through Hungary to the West in an exodus that
helped trigger last fall's democratic changes. Now the ``Trabi''
seems more like an inescapable reminder of the past.
   Blank says the mood is hopeful after the conservative victory in
East Germany's free elections March 18.
   The winning three-party alliance, heavily backed by the
conservative Bonn government, has promised quick union with rich
West Germany.
   The conservatives did especially well in East Germany's southern
industrial areas of Thuringia and Saxony, where Zwickau is located.
West German flags waving from the windows of the city's aging
apartment buildings show which way the wind is blowing.
   But as West German companies rush to get a foothold in the
eastern market, Trabant workers realize their economy's immediate
future is uncertain.
   ``My friends and I expect a dry spell of 2-3 years,'' says
engineer Dieter Hildesheim, 35. ``Then things will look up again.''
   Sales of the little car are plummeting because East Germans are
waiting for economic union with West Germany, planned by this
summer, so they can buy a car of their choice.
   Volkswagen production is expected to reach full steam only in
1994, so Sachsenring hopes its revamped Trabant with a VW engine
will sell in Eastern Europe and Canada in the meantime.
   It's a far cry from East Germany's closed market last year,
which buyers faced waits of 15 years or more for a Trabi and the
plant advertised 700 openings.
   Trabis now are available for immediate delivery. The giant job
notice board at a plant entrance is conspicuously empty.
   Dieter Voigt, chief of the state vehicle building conglomerate
IFA, has said up to 70 percent of the workers in the automotive and
supply industries _ about 100,000 people _ could lose their jobs in
the switch to a free-market economy.
   Guenter Noetzold, an economist at Leipzig University, predicts 2
million East Germans, a quarter of the labor force, will be jobless
for a limited period.
   But Blank, who has a wife and two children, is convinced East
Germans will find enough work in rebuilding their land after
decades of neglect.
   ``Because of the mess, for example in road and housing
construction, there will be jobs,'' he says.
   However, some Zwickau residents do not hide their bitterness and
sense of helplessness.
   Henry Hofmann, a lifetime employee, knows he'll be among 5,000
Sachsenring employees Volkswagen is expected to dump.
   The 33-year-old engineer is in charge of making the Trabant's
hard plastic body panels. ``We'll all have to search for new
jobs,'' he says of his shop.
   But he adds, ``I'm not looking yet. What would be secure now?''
   State planners decided on plastic for the Trabant's body because
it was cheaper than metal and postwar projects like housing and
social programs had priority.
   Until the end, East Berlin refused to invest in overhauling the
Trabi, leaving it just another doomed relic when change swept
Eastern Europe.
   ``We were told: no funds available,'' Hofmann says.

<TEXT>
   Another new Nixon emerges from Richard Nixon's
new book _ at 77, a man at peace with himself who says that despite
the ordeals and crises ``I can look back and say that the day has
indeed been splendid.''
   Nixon still has the media to kick around _ ``too often they
shoot first and literally ask questions later,'' he says, adding
that Watergate ``has elevated Peeping Tom journalism and character
assassination to a new level of respectability.''
   Still, instead of an enemies list, Nixon prints a list of his
friends among journalists and says, ``I could not possibly have
gone as far as I did in the political arena without having the
benefit of some balanced as well as negative coverage.''
   ``In the Arena,'' his seventh book since leaving the presidency,
is his most personal.
   ``In the end what matters is that you have always lived life to
the hilt,'' he writes. ``I have won some great victories and
suffered some devastating defeats. But win or lose, I feel
fortunate to have come to that time in life when I can finally
enjoy what my Quaker grandmother would have called `peace at the
center.'''
   The book sums up a lifetime of victories, defeats and comebacks.
   Almost dropped as the Republican vice presidential candidate in
1952 because of questions about a ``slush fund,'' he saved himself
with an emotional television address. In 1960, he was defeated for
the presidency by John Kennedy in an election that he says his
wife, Pat, still thinks was stolen from him.
   Two years later, he ran for governor of California against Pat's
advice (``she was right,'' Nixon says) and bitterly announced his
retirement from politics, only to bounce back in 1968 to finally
win the presidency.
   But his second term was spoiled by scandal. Midway, he resigned.
A tape recording showed that he had tried to cover up White House
involvement in the Watergate break-in at Democratic headquarters,
and impeachment appeared certain.
   Nixon offers his standard defense on Watergate _ that he was
held to a higher standard than others.
   ``All administrations have sought to protect themselves from the
political fallout of scandals,'' he writes. The break-in at
Democratic headquarters and the coverup were illegal, but ``not
unusual in political campaigns.''
   Other presidents, he adds, taped private conversations and
suffered no rebuke for it.
   And most people and other presidents used foul language, he
says. ``But since neither I nor most other presidents had ever used
profanity in public,'' people were shocked when he released the
White House tape transcripts and all its notations of ``expletive
deleted'' _ especially when the expletives were subsequently
published.
   Nixon says that despite his spats with the press _ ``you won't
have Nixon to kick around any more,'' he told reporters after the
gubernatorial defeat in 1962 _ he has had good relations with many
journalists.
   He lists 73 of them by name, but leaves some others out ``since
being considered fair on Nixon by Nixon would almost certainly put
them in dutch with their colleagues.''
   To make his case that he was judged by a higher standard than
other presidents, Nixon writes that ``some of my critics'' said he
should have paid to take his dog on Air Force One flights to
vacations in Florida and California.
   He recalls incidents involving dogs owned by Franklin D.
Roosevelt and Lyndon D. Johnson.
   ``When Roosevelt's dog Fala supposedly rode on a destroyer, it
was a good laugh,'' he writes. ``When Johnson's dog rode on a
plane, it was what everyone _ the dog included _ expected. When
Nixon's dog rode on a plane, it was a crime for not reporting the
air fare as income, even though the animal did not take up a seat.''

<HEAD>More Money for Aging Research Sought to Ensure Healthy `Senior
Boom'</HEAD>

   The nation should put more money into research
on aging so Americans can enjoy a healthy ``senior boom'' when the
baby boom generation gets older, an advocacy group said today.
   ``Serious gaps in research are placing the successful aging and
independence of older Americans at risk,'' the Alliance for Aging
Research reported.
   The alliance, which is supported by businesses and foundations,
said the nation is pouring increasing amounts of money into ``sick
care'' for older Americans while it fails to adequately finance
research to help the elderly stay healthy.
   ``Compared to the health care costs attributed to older
Americans, there is a wide and growing gap in our commitment to
find cures and preventions,'' the group said in a report.
   It said that as the baby boom generation turns into the ``senior
boom'' in the next century, older Americans will account for
one-half of a health care bill approaching $2 trillion a year.
   The alliance called for spending $1 billion a year on research
to help prevent, postpone or cure chronic conditions that affect
older Americans. This would require a $600 million-a-year increase
in research on aging, and would bring research funding on aging up
to par with that for other major health concerns such as cancer,
AIDS and heart research, it said.
   ``The successes in health and medicine in the 20th century have
primarily saved lives in youth and middle age,'' the report said.
``Advances affecting the cure and prevention of chronic illnesses
in late life have been few.''
   Americans age 65 and older represent more than 12 percent of the
population, and the oldest-old, those 85 and older, represent the
fastest-growing segment of the population. By the year 2020 the
over-65 population is expected to more than double to more than 65
million, the report said.

<BYLINE>Cancer Cells Killed by Genetic Sabotage, Researcher Says

<TEXT>
   Cancer cells have been killed in the
test tube by sabotaging their genetic machinery, an early step in
what could someday become a new form of therapy, a researcher says.
   Scientists used a molecule that latched onto a key substance in
cancer cells, preventing a crucial gene from relaying its orders to
the cells.
   The research is among early work in the so-called ``anti-sense''
strategy that seeks to block the effect of particular genes in
cancer cells.
   The new results were described Wednesday, at an American Cancer
Society science writers seminar, by Dr. John Reed of the University
of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.
   His work was in lymphomas, cancers of the body's lymph tissues
that strike more than 40,000 Americans a year. Lymph tissues play
an important role in fighting infections.
   Reed focused on a gene called BCL2. It is activated for limited
periods in some normal cells when the body's disease-fighting
immune system gears up.
   But at some point very early in the transformation of a normal
cell to a lymphoma, the BCL2 gene tends to become overactive, Reed
said.
   That occurs in about half of lymphomas, as well as maybe 5
percent to 10 percent of leukemias, Reed said. It results from a
breaking and defective rejoining of chromosomes, the threadlike
structures that carry genes, he said.
   The normal function of the BCL2 gene is not known, Reed said.
Like other genes, BCL2 relays its orders to the cell by sending a
sort of Morse code message in chemical messengers called
ribonucleic acids.
   Reed's experiment involved invading lymphoma cells with a
substance that seeks out and binds this messenger, stopping its
function.
   That killed lymphoma cells in the test tube, showing that the
BCL2 gene plays a key role in lymphoma cell survival, Reed said.
   He cautioned that any therapeutic use is many years away and
must overcome some significant hurdles. One is that a single dose
of the messenger-binding substance would now cost about $100,000,
he said.
   Future developments might produce a binding substance that
clings to abnormal genetic material associated with an overactive
BCL2 rather than the messenger, he said.
   That could keep therapy from harming normal cells in which BCL2
happened to be switched on, he said.
   Another step toward that goal would be developing binding
substances that seek out an abnormal form of the BCL2 messenger
that frequently appears in lymphoma cells, he said.
   Dr. John Laszlo, the cancer society's senior vice president for
research, called the work fascinating. Reed's early successes are
``very exciting,'' he said.

<HEAD>Study Proposes New Regulatory Body for Transportation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A new study concludes that airline
deregulation has brought higher fares, more danger and less
service, and recommends a federal commission to regulate all modes
of transportation.
   The report published Wednesday by the liberal Economic Policy
Institute called for price setting within a range that would
prevent airlines from overcharging in thin markets or undercharging
to drive out competitors on heavily traveled routes.
   The study called for airlines to be limited to one hub operation
to avoid a system that its author, Paul Stephen Dempsey, said has
``destroyed the inherent advantages of the air transport system.''
   Dempsey said it is cheaper to take a taxi from Kansas City to
St. Louis than to fly at full fare, and that many flights take much
longer than they did several years ago because so many pass through
hub airports.
   ``The time has come to reconsider the experiment of airline
deregulation,'' said Dempsey, a University of Denver professor who
supported deregulation in the late 1970s when he was a lawyer for
the now-defunct Civil Aeronautics Board.
   Dempsey's study challenged reports by the Transportation
Department and the airline industry that hail deregulation as a
boon to travelers.
   ``The phenomenon of jet lag has been replaced by the phenomenon
of hub lag,'' said Dempsey. He referred to the formation of hub
airports where a single airline dominates flights _ decreasing
competition and increasing fares on some routes.
   The report said deregulation has increased airlines fares for
the average traveler by 2.6 cents per mile over prices they likely
would be paying without it. The cost per trip may be as much as 33
percent higher and is likely to take longer, Dempsey said at a news
conference releasing the study, ``Flying Blind: The Failure of
Airline Deregulation.''
   The crux of the report's economic conclusion is that airline
ticket prices had been declining for several years before
deregulation but the decline slowed after the government stopped
regulating fares.
   Federal Aviation Administrator James B. Busey, responding to a
question about Dempsey's report at a separate news conference
Wednesday, said deregulation has provided increased access to the
air traffic system for millions of Americans.
   He said the U.S. system is the safest in the world.
   ``If people are upset about the rates they're paying, then
demand is going to control that,'' Busey said. ``Encouraging
competition in a deregulated market is the best way to lower
rates.''
   The institute study says that of the 514 non-hub communities
with air service before deregulation, 312 have suffered declines in
flight frequency while 143 lost all service.
   The institute study says complaints filed against U.S. airlines
skyrocketed from 7,326 in 1983 to 40,985 in 1987 and cited a poll
of pilots that said 97 percent believe deregulation has made flying
more dangerous.
   It also said the number of near-collisions soared from 311 in
1982 to 1,058 in 1987, that the average age of pilots has decreased
while the age of planes has gone up and that spending for
maintenance has declined.
   Dempsey acknowledged that fatalities and accidents have
declined, but he credited that to safety improvements by
manufacturers rather than airlines, which he said are ``treating
their aircraft worse, not better.''

<HEAD>FAA Chief Frustrated by Delays in Explosive Detection Installation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRISCOE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. officials are facing resistance to
placement of sophisticated bomb-detection devices in foreign and
American airports, and the head of the Federal Aviation
Administration says he's frustrated by the delays.
   Agreement to install one of the $1 million thermo neutron
analysis, or TNA, devices at London's Gatwick Airport will be
announced soon, FAA Administrator James B. Busey said Wednesday.
   But he said negotiations have been delayed by sovereignty and
other issues at Frankfurt, West Germany, and by insurance questions
at Washington Dulles International Airport.
   ``I'm very frustrated that we have not been able to get the
original six machines in place,'' Busey told reporters. ``We are
experiencing more difficulties than anticipated.''
   Only New York's Kennedy International Airport and Miami
International Airport have the machines under a program stepped up
after the December 1988 bombing of Pan AM Flight 103 over
Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed 270 people.
   In West Germany, negotiators are going through a long,
structured process that will include a trip by German authorities
to the United States next month to test their own explosives on TNA
devices at U.S. airports, Busey said.
   An installation in the Philippines is ``tied up in diplomatic
negotiations,'' he said.
   The Dulles talks are in their final stages, Busey said, adding
that he wants to put the equipment in a public area where it can be
seen. The bulky machines generally are expected to be in luggage
areas out of public view.
   Earlier plans to place two of the first six devices at the San
Francisco and Detroit airports were scrapped because the FAA, the
airports and the airlines failed to agree on an arrangement, said
FAA spokesman Fred Farrar.
   The TNA devices emit a neutron cloud over checked bags that
interact with the contents and allow the machine to analyze
characteristic gamma rays emitted by various explosives, including
plastic that cannot be detected by the X-ray machines now common in
airports.
   The government had set the goal of installing 40 of the machines
at high-risk airports around the world by the end of the year. U.S.
airlines are to pay the cost of all but the first six, which are
being purchased by the FAA.
   Farrar said three of the units have been built, one is near
completion and the other two are on order from Science Applications
International Corp. of San Diego.
   Hundreds more TNA or comparable units would be installed in a
second phase, with the largest airports having 20 or more machines
to handle all baggage.
   Airlines have objected to government directives that force them
to pay for and install the detectors before the technology has been
adequately tested in airport operations. They say the devices are
needed primarily because of the terrorist threat against the U.S.
government, not against individual carriers.
   Busey said he intends to keep the pressure on airports and
airlines to place the expensive machines and is not yet prepared to
cut back on the timetable for installation but will if necessary.
   He said that as more TNA devices are put into use, they should
become more efficient and less expensive.

<HEAD>Administration Touts Tax Cut as Economic Boost</HEAD>

   Cutting taxes on capital gains eventually
would produce an economic boost equal to all current federal
spending for education, job training and social services, the Bush
administration is telling Congress.
   ``Over the next five years ... the president's proposal would
raise gross national product by roughly $60 billion; over the next
10 years, by roughly $280 billion,'' Michael J. Boskin, chairman of
the Council of Economic Advisers, said Wednesday.
   ``Increases in GNP represents new jobs, better opportunities and
better standards of living for Americans,'' the presidential
adviser told the Senate Finance Committee. By the year 2000, he
said, the economic growth would be equal to all current private
spending for basic research.
   Boskin and Treasury Department officials told the committee that
reducing capital gains taxes would generate more revenue than it
would lose. Analysts for the Joint Committee on Taxation and the
Library of Congress disputed that point.
   A cut in the tax on capital gains _ the profit on the sale of
investments _ is at the top of President Bush's legislative agenda.
He contends that taxing capital gains at lower rates than apply to
wages would boost investment and allow U.S. companies to be more
competitive with foreigners.
   Democratic leaders in Congress oppose a cut on grounds it would
worsen the budget deficit and produce a huge tax cut for
high-income Americans with no assurance the economy would benefit
at all.
   The Senate committee failed to get a consensus from
non-government witnesses Wednesday. For example:
   _Tax lawyers N. Jerold Cohen of Atlanta and David G. Glickman of
Dallas said a lower rate for capital gains ``violates all goals of
sound tax policy ... It is difficult to convince the wage earner
who has income of $50,000 that he should be taxed at a much higher
rate than the trader who earns $50,000 speculating in the market.''
   _Mark Bloomfield, president of American Council for Capital
Formation, the business organization leading the fight for a
capital gains reduction, called the cut essential to a high
sustained rate of investment. That investment, he said, ``is the
only way our high-wage economy can restore the productivity growth
that allows us to compete with low-wage industrial nations around
the world.''
   _Alan J. Auerbach, chairman of the Economics Department at the
University of Pennsylvania, disputed the argument that a capital
gains cut would so spur the economy that it would generate more
money that it would cost and nobody would lose. ``In reality,
however, there would be losers: the taxpayers who would have to
supply the lost revenue,'' he said.
   _``The capital-gains exclusion is about the most regressive tax
proposal advanced with a straight face in my memory,'' said
economist Henry J. Aaron of the Brookings Institution.
   _``Opposing capital gains on the grounds that the wealthy stand
to benefit ... fails to answer the question of whether lower taxes
... is good public policy in revitalizing our economy,'' said
Mitchell Kertzman, chairman of the American Electronics Association.
   A preferential tax rate long enjoyed by capital gains was
repealed in 1986 in a general overhaul of the tax law. It was one
of several special benefits eliminated in order to allow a sharp
reduction in individual and corporate tax rates.
   President Bush contends it was a mistake to eliminate the
capital gains preference. The House approved a lower rate for
capital gains last year, over objections of Democratic leaders, but
it was blocked in the Senate.
   Bush wants to tax only 70 percent of gains from the sale of
assets owned for more than three years, with smaller incentives for
property held for a shorter period.

<HEAD>Exotic Vegetables Showing Up in U.S. Shopping Carts</HEAD>

   Bean sprouts and other specialty crops are
puny compared with the major commercial vegetables such as tomatoes
and sweet corn, but consumers are still adding exotic names to
grocery shopping lists.
   The Agriculture Department says about 12.5 million hundredweight
of specialty vegetables reached U.S. consumers in 1989, a 13
percent increase from 1988. Fresh herbs also have caught shoppers'
fancy.
   Supplies from domestically grown crops rose 10 percent to 9.3
million hundredweight, while imports increased 24 percent to 3.2
million hundredweight, according to a report by the department's
Economic Research Service.
   ``Imported specialties are often vegetables that are common in
foreign countries, such as jicama, which is a widely eaten root
crop in Mexico,'' the report said. ``Imports also include crops
that a relatively uncommon but which are receiving new promotional
efforts.''
   Fancy lettuces make up most of the specialty category, and those
supplies generally increased last year. For example, domestic
Romaine lettuce increased 16 percent, while imported shipments were
up 76 percent. However, escarole and endive, mostly from Florida,
were down.
   Domestic shipments of various Oriental vegetables, including
daikon and bean sprouts, increased 23 percent in 1989, while
imports soared 333 percent, the report said.
   Even with the sharp percentage increases the total for specialty
vegetables _ 12.5 million hundredweight _ was relatively small
compared with the 1989 output of fresh market vegetables. Those
were estimated at 255 million hundredweight, up 2 percent, not
counting potatoes.
   Another consumer surge has occurred with fresh herbs used by
home cooks and the food service industry.
   The 1987 census of agriculture shows ``dramatic increases'' in
U.S. herb production, the report said. Production includes older
standby such as garlic, parsley, watercress, dill oil, ginger root
and mint oil.
   Also, the 1987 figures included production of an ``aggregate
category'' for miscellaneous fresh herbs such as basil, cilantro
and rosemary. Those increased to 9.8 million pounds from 2.1
million pounds reported in 1978.
   The harvested acreage of garlic, which is concentrated in
California, declined slightly in 1987 from earlier census
tabulations made in 1978 and 1982. However, the number of farms
producing garlic increased to 448 from those earlier years.
   ``The increase in farms, but not acreage, may reflect a surge in
the number of small farmers producing garlic for farmers' markets,
country fairs and other direct-marketing outlets,'' the report said.
   Farms producing parsley have increased steadily since 1978 and
are located mostly in California, Florida and New Jersey.

   WASHINGTON (AP) _ An Agriculture Department report says fish
farming _ aquaculture _ is young but growing rapidly into a major
provider of food for an expanding world population.
   ``The 1990s should be an important decade for growth,'' the
report said Wednesday. ``World population grains and limits on wild
catch from the oceans should increase the demand for aquaculture
products.''
   Aquaculture refers to commercial production of a wide variety of
fish, shellfish and seafood products. It includes baitfish,
hatchery operations and the stocking of fish farms.
   ``If U.S. seafood consumption continues to grow, the rise in
demand will likely be met through increased imports and higher
domestic aquacultural production,'' the report said.
   Fish farmers and other aquacultural producers ``have an
advantage over capture fisheries in that production can rise
without endangering future supplies.''
   Catfish are the leading species grown commercially in the United
States. Production in 1989 rose 16 percent in volume to 342 million
pounds delivered by farmers, the report said.
   Overall, including the wild catch, catfish ranked fourth in 1988
behind pollock, salmon and cod, and may have moved into third place
ahead of cod in 1989, the report said.
   Prices paid to catfish farmers last year averaged 72 cents a
pound, down 6 percent from 1988 because of the larger supply and
lower prices paid by processors for large fish.
   But catfish prices have risen since October and by February had
reached 75 cents a pound, the report said. Also, growers have
formed a bargaining association that has negotiated prices with
many processors for the first half of 1990.
   The most recent survey of trout growers showed a decrease in the
number of producers to 478 in 1989 from 518 in 1988. However, sales
of trout and trout eggs rose to $72.6 million from $66.4 million in
1988.
   Domestically grown farm salmon output was estimated at nine
million to 10 million pounds in 1989, a sharp increase from six
million pounds in 1988. The gain was attributed to larger output on
both the East and West coasts.
   Oyster production has increased in the Northwest while disease
problems reduced oyster harvesting in the Chesapeake Bay, formerly
the largest producing area, the report said.
   Pacific Coast oyster production grew from 6.7 million pounds of
meat with a value of $5.6 million in 1980 to eight million pounds
valued at $14.5 million in 1988, the most recent figures available.

   Field tests have been approved by the
Agriculture Department for squash and cantaloupe altered
genetically to resist two major crop diseases.
   The tests will be conducted by the Upjohn Co. of Kalamazoo,
Mich., in California, Georgia and Michigan.
   James W. Glosser, head of the department's Animal and Plant
Health Inspection Service, said Wednesday the squash and cantaloupe
have been altered to resist cucumber mosaic virus, or CMV, and
papaya ringspot virus, PRV.
   Glosser said the agency has reviewed the field-test procedures
and determined ``Upjohn is following the necessary steps to assure
the safety of the field tests.''
   The tests will be conducted in May in Kern and San Benito
counties, California; Worth County, Ga.; and Kalamazoo County, Mich.

<HEAD>Experts: Poindexter Kept Off Stand to Avoid `Putting Noose Around
Neck'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES ROWLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The defense kept former national security
adviser John M. Poindexter off the witness stand at his Iran-Contra
trial to keep him from ``putting the noose around his own neck,''
one legal observer says.
   Having Poindexter testify would have risked destroying any
doubts about the prosecutors' case planted by defense attorney
Richard Beckler, said Georgetown University law professor Paul
Rothstein.
   Prosecutor Dan Webb would have asked, ```Did Reagan ever
authorize you to lie to Congress?' Poindexter would probably have
to say `No,''' Rothstein said.
   ``He would hit every one of those points where a seed of doubt
has been laid and the last thing the jury would hear is Poindexter
putting the noose around his own neck,'' Rothstein said.
   The general rule among white-collar criminal defense lawyers is
to put the defendant on the witness stand, experts say.
   ``Acquittals are very rare when a defendant does not take the
stand,'' said Rothstein, who has attended Poindexter's Iran-Contra
coverup trial.
   The defense rested its case on Tuesday, and final arguments are
scheduled for Friday in U.S. District Court.
   Beckler, asked Tuesday why he did not call Poindexter to the
stand, said, ``Because I don't believe the government proved its
case.''
   Rothstein said, ``When a defendant does not take the stand, the
jury supposes you are covering up something,'' even though the
judge instructs ther panel not to hold the accused's silence
against him.
   Poindexter avoided what observers agree would have been
withering cross-examination by Webb, who hammered away at former
White House aide Oliver L. North for 3{ days.
   The decision probably focused on the question of ``were there
any facts he could clarify or bring to the table that weren't
already there,'' said E. Lawrence Barcella, a prominent defense
lawyer in Washington. ``Or were you just going to give a very good
lawyer an opportunity to cross-examine him.''
   Generally, the accused would be expected to testify ``if you've
got a case where the only person who can explain things is the
defendant,'' Barcella said. ``But here you have all kinds of people
who were explaining the events.''
   Poindexter is accused of conspiring to obstruct congressional
inquiries into the Iran-Contra affair by lying and destroying
documents. He also is accused of making false statements in
meetings with lawmakers and in a letter to Congress denying that
North was secretly helping the Nicaraguan Contra rebels.
   Another danger Poindexter avoids is the possibility of a perjury
charge if he contradicted sworn testimony he gave congressional
hearings about the Iran-Contra affair in 1987, Rothstein said.
   Poindexter told lawmakers he didn't tell President Reagan about
the diversion of U.S.-Iran arms sale profits to the rebels.
   Poindexter testified then that he kept Reagan in the dark to
give the president credible deniability if the covert Contra aid
operation were exposed.
   But Rothstein said that version of events doesn't support
Poindexter's contention that he had no motive to lie to Congress
because he acted with Reagan's authority. And he would be courting
a perjury charge if he provided a different explanation to the
jury, Rothstein said.
   The defense tried to show that a 1986 meeting with lawmakers, at
which Poindexter is accused of lying, was really a formal
congressional proceeding to which the former national security
adviser made false statements about the Iran-Contra affair.
   It raised the possibility that the document North said he saw
Poindexter tear up was not a politically embarrassing document
signed by Reagan that authorized U.S. involvement in a 1985
shipment of Israeli Hawk missiles to Iran.
   The defense also tried to suggest the document was superseded by
two other documents Reagan signed in 1986 to authorize U.S.-Iran
arms sales.
   The defense ``had a lot of alternative explanations that raised
doubts,'' Rothstein said.
   ``All of these can coexist as long as Poindexter doesn't take
the stand,'' he said. ``But if Poindexter took the stand he would
have to commit himself to one of them.''

   President Bush takes about four times longer
than John Kennedy to fill his administration's top jobs, but much
of the delay is because of ethics laws, snooping reporters and _
yes _ politics, a presidential scholar says.
   ``We find ourselves ... with a presidential appointment process
that greatly complicates and elongates the change in policy
directions that democratic elections are designed to permit,'' G.
Calvin Mackenzie wrote in the April issue of Government Executive
magazine.
   ``Procedural changes, new legislation, escalating media scrutiny
and more complex politics have all slowed the appointment
process,'' said Mackenzie, a professor of government at Colby
College in Waterville, Maine.
   ``The Bush administration has survived this process because it
took over a friendly government and brought no great agenda for
change,'' said the author. ``But the consequences of this new
complexity would not have been viewed with such equanimity if a
Democrat had won in 1988, nor will they be so viewed in future
transitions where the government changes hands from one party to
another.''
   The time it takes to fill a position by presidential appointment
and Senate confirmation has lengthened steadily since the
administration of President Kennedy, wrote Mackenzie, director of
the presidential appointee project of the National Academy of
Public Administration.
   After Kennedy's election in 1960, it took 2.38 months for the
average appointee to a high-ranking job to be confirmed by the
Senate, Mackenzie wrote. In Bush's case, it will be more than eight
months.
   Figures for other presidents who entered the White House by
election during the period were 3.39 months for Nixon, 4.55 months
for Carter and 5.30 months for Reagan.
   The figures were based on a study of 964 nominees during the
five administrations, covering more than half of the appointments
to positions at the assistant secretary or deputy director level or
above in departments and major agencies.
   Mackenzie said that ``the White House does not deserve all the
blame it has received for the slowdown.''
   ``Both the Reagan and Bush transitions have been slowed by the
impact of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 and subsequent
efforts to tighten even further the regulations of the actions and
personal finances of executive branch officials,'' he wrote.
   The article said an increasing amount of time is taken up
explaining the rules to potential appointees, completing and
reviewing financial disclosure forms, and altering investment
portfolios to avoid conflicts of interest.
   Chase Untermeyer, director of presidential personnel at the
White House, was described as believing that the attention to
ethics was ``a principal cause of delay in making appointments''
early in 1989.
   The article said staffing of the Bush administration also ``took
off much more slowly than Reagan's efforts in 1981'' because Bush
chose not to have extensive personnel recruiting processes
developed months in advance of his election, as Reagan and Carter
did.

   The thinner the better.
   That's the conclusion of a study released today on U.S. women
and their risk of heart attack.
   ``Average weight is overweight when it comes to heart attack
risk, and being even mildly to moderately overweight substantially
increases the risk in women,'' said Dr. JoAnn E. Manson, who
directed the study at Boston's Brigham and Women's Hospital.
   In fact, the study blames 40 percent of all heart disease among
women on the consequences of being too heavy. Carrying just a
little extra weight or even being average size makes people more
vulnerable to heart trouble.
   Manson's findings were part of the Nurses' Health Study, an
eight-year review of 115,886 healthy U.S. women, aged 30 to 55. The
researchers divided the women into five weight categories and
counted the number who had heart attacks or developed chest pain.
The results were published in today's New England Journal of
Medicine.
   The leanest one-fifth of the women in the study weighed in at 5
percent or more below the 1983 Metropolitan Life Insurance Co.
tables of desirable weights. A 5-foot-4 woman in this category
weighed less than 125 pounds. These slim women suffered the fewest
heart attacks.
   Those considered in the tables to be average weight _ about 130
pounds for a 5-foot-4 woman _ had 30 percent more heart disease
than did the thinnest women.
   Mildly obese women fared substantially worse. Those who were 15
percent to 29 percent above their desirable weights had 80 percent
more heart disease. And the heaviest women _ those 30 percent or
more over their ideal weights _ had more than three times the lean
women's risk.
   Putting on weight during middle age appears to be especially
risky. The study found that women who gained more than 20 pounds
since age 18 doubled their risk of heart attacks.
   Although the report is not the first to suggest that being
chubby is bad for the heart, it suggests that the hazard may be
greater than previously thought, especially for women.
   ``Obesity is a major cause of heart attacks in U.S. women,''
said Manson. ``The risks of obesity have been underestimated and
underappreciated.''
   In an accompanying editorial in the journal, Dr. Theodore B.
VanItallie of St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in New York
agreed that doctors have failed to take obesity seriously enough.
   But because of the latest study, he said, ``any remaining
confidence that some degree of obesity in women is safe is likely
to be replaced by deep concern.''
   The study concludes that obesity is harmful to women largely
because it increases blood pressure, raises cholesterol levels and
contributes to diabetes.
   About 34 million U.S. adults are considered to be obese because
their weight is 20 percent or more above their desirable level.
   Whether fat is bad for men's hearts, too, is unclear, because
studies have produced conflicting results.
   Heart attacks are the leading killer in the United States. About
987,000 men and 513,000 women suffer heart attacks annually.
   Gaining weight is a common condition of aging. Only about
one-fifth of young women are considered to be overweight, but this
increases to one-third by middle age.
   The researchers said that because weight is so hard to take off
and keep off, women should be encouraged to keep from adding extra
pounds as they grow older.
   ``No one should minimize the difficulty of avoiding the weight
gain that comes with middle age,'' Manson said. ``But with a good
deal of effort, this is potentially preventable.''

<TEXT>
   If your mother wears Army boots, they're not
getting any cheaper _ peace dividend or not.
   Last year's outbreak of democracy in Eastern Europe, coupled
with hopes for wrapping up assorted minor wars around the globe,
could still produce big savings from the Pentagon budget, someday.
   And Third World generals may be able to strike great deals for
the secondhand tanks and late-model fighters about to be made
unwelcome in Europe, if conventional arms talks stay on track.
   But when Sunny's Surplus in Georgetown trumpets ``World Peace
Means Bigger Savings For You'' in its posters and television ads,
it turns out they're making a little joke. Sorry, prices are not
tumbling on army boots or canteen belts thrown aside by unemployed
Cold War soldiers.
   Store manager Mike Carpenter, patiently explaining the humor in
an interview at his two-floor emporium of tents, trenchcoats and
camouflage hats, said he hadn't really noticed any price drops
since the Berlin Wall's demise.
   For that matter, most of the store's merchandise, such as
sweatshirts and socks, is surplus or seconds from some civilian
manufacturer, not anybody's army or navy.
   Gamely, Carpenter suggested that prices for army-surplus type
goods are not as high as they would be if, say, Vietnam or World
War III were in progress right this minute.
   ``It makes the prices a lot lower. You can buy a decent
entrenching tool for $4.99 on up,'' he said, grabbing a folding
shovel originally made for the Dutch army.
   Then he looked around at other piles of clothing and gear and
asked, ``What are they going to use this stuff for?''
   The store's advertising campaign shows a smiling soldier in
helmet, pack and army boots, collecting gear on a deserted
battlefield, presumably to be sold at bargain prices back in
Washington.
   Too bad it hasn't worked out. But Sunny's is still probably the
only boutique in swank Georgetown where you can buy West German
wool pants for just $14.99, U.S. Navy sailor middies for as little
as $2.99 or a heavy Army raincoat for under $20.
   That could be enough to get by until the peace dividend check
comes in the mail.

   The race to cram more technology and power into
Japanese television sets and computers sometimes has left quality
inspectors behind, leading to smoking appliances and an
embarrassing wave of recalls.
   The recalls, following a series late last year involving some
new model Japanese cars with faulty parts, have revived
recollections of a time when ``made in Japan'' was a label of
derision in the United States.
   Since January, four Japanese electronics giants _ Sony Corp.,
Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Pioneer Electronics Corp., and
Toshiba Corp. _ have issued nationwide public notices recalling
hundreds of thousands of color TV sets that suddenly smoked or
caused minor fires. Seiko Epson Corp. recalled laptop computers
that smoked.
   None of the recalls affected products exported to the United
States. Most were made for the domestic market, and some were
shipped to Taiwan.
   ``Safety for consumers has been ignored while (companies)
concentrate on technology and sales to survive in the competitive
market,'' said Michiko Aoyama, a director at the government-backed
Japan Consumer Information Center.
   ``I'm afraid the quality of Japanese products is declining due
to imperfect quality control that cannot catch up with the speed of
technological advance,'' she said.
   Toshiba spokesman Yuji Wakayama said: ``We have tried so hard to
add as many features as possible while reducing the cost as low as
possible. The accidents mean production under such conditions has
reached the limit.''
   With the increasing popularity of home videos, electronics
companies have been making larger screen televisions that require
higher voltage. The recent smoking cases were traced to defects in
high-voltage circuits.
   Late last year, Toyota recalled thousands of its luxury Lexus
cars in the United States after defects were found in the
cruise-control mechanism and a brake light. Nissan earlier recalled
nearly 38,000 cars in Japan.
   The most recent recalls brought a warning from the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry. It told the Electronic Industries
Association of Japan, which groups 600 manufacturers, to
investigate thoroughly, tighten safety and quality control, and
adopt regular procedures for recalls.
   On Wednesday, a special committee of the association announced a
draft for tighter safety standards in TV sets' high-voltage
circuits, to be adopted voluntarily by 11 Japanese manufacturers,
and standardized procedures to handle defects.
   The changes could be reflected in new products within one year,
said Ryuji Iwasaki, the association's vice president.
   ``Generally speaking, our new voluntary safety standards require
a substantial change in designs and production,'' said Hiroshi
Wada, Sharp Corp.'s director of product planning.
   This probably would result in a 2 percent price increase, he
added.
   Except for motor vehicles, Japan has no law or government
guidelines on recalls or reporting of defects in products, giving
companies a great deal of leeway in responding to problems.
   ``We think it is our mission to repair defects to ease our
conscience,'' Toshiba's Wakayama said.
   He added, however, that while the problem televisions smoked or
burned the tables on which they sat, they ``did not kill and hurt
people, or burn down houses.''
   Industry and trade ministry official Takashi Yonehara said:
``The recent TV accidents resulted mainly from complex designs and
lack of quality controls.''
   In the ministry's last annual inspection, more than 30 percent
of manufacturers were found to have violated government safety
standards in products, and MITI will start announcing the names of
violators, he added.
   A government report in February criticized companies for not
promptly giving public notice and reporting defects to industry and
trade officials.
   Pioneer quietly began repairs for 9,135 defective TV sets last
spring, and already had fixed some 8,000 before issuing a public
recall notice nine months later, company officials acknowledged.
   Sony's public recall notices for six color TV models came almost
four months after the first report last October of a Sony set
starting to smolder in a home in western Japan.
   Sony said it took time to trace the problem to a high-voltage
component that had a tendency to overheat after long use.
   ``We admit our reaction was not quick enough. ... I guess we
could have done better,'' said Koichi Izukura, a Sony spokesman.
   Naokazu Takeuchi, spokesman for the Japan Consumer Union, one of
the largest Japanese consumer groups, argues that notification of
possible dangers should come before anything else.
   He also says the government should help process consumer claims,
to speed remedies and spread information more widely.
   Atsushi Nakamura, a spokesman for the Japan Bar Association,
said consumers should be protected by a product liability law, as
in the United States, so that victims of product defects do not
have to settle for small compensation from manufacturers.
   Industry and trade official Tomosaburo Yano said the ministry
has urged electronics and auto makers unofficially to make safety a
top priority when considering whether to recall their products.
   ``Companies that don't work hard to improve their products will
become losers in the market,'' Yano said.

<HEAD>First Soviet Visit to Secretive US Nuclear Weapons Plant</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In a sign of the Cold War's passing, the Bush
administration is opening the doors today of the long-secret
Savannah River nuclear weapons plant to Soviet officials.
   The Soviet delegation is visiting the South Carolina
installation and other U.S. defense nuclear facilities this week as
part of a fact-finding mission designed to exchange information on
ways of handling and disposing of radioactive wastes.
   For most of its nearly four decades of operation, the Savannah
River plant has been one of the most secretive sites in the nation.
It contains three reactors that produce tritium, a gas needed in
the production of nuclear warheads. The reactors have been shut
down for two years for safety reasons but are being repaired.
   Also on the site are a weapons laboratory, a Navy nuclear fuel
processing plant, facilities for disassembling retired nuclear
warheads and related operations.
   The Soviet delegation, led by Boris V. Nikipelov, first deputy
minister of atomic energy and industry, was to be briefed by U.S.
officials at Savannah River on nuclear waste management and
disposal programs and other environmental activities.
   Bob Griffin, an Energy Department spokesman, said the Soviets
would not tour the nuclear reactors at Savannah River, which are in
a restricted area that can be entered only by U.S. personnel with
the highest security clearances.
   Griffin said it was the first time Soviet government officials
had visited Savannah River, although Soviets have toured other
parts of the nuclear weapons complex, which includes 17 production
facilities and research laboratories in 12 states.
   The Savannah River visit is part of a four-stop tour for the
Soviets, who arrived in Washington on Monday at the invitation of
Energy Secretary James D. Watkins.
   The Soviets visited the Oak Ridge nuclear weapons complex in
Tennessee on Wednesday and are scheduled to travel Friday to
Carlsbad, N.M., where the Energy Department is building an
underground facility to permanently store nuclear wastes.
   A U.S. government delegation plans a reciprocal visit to the
Soviet Union in May or June, Griffin said.

<HEAD>Abolishes Censorship, Allows Expatriates To Regain Citizenship</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parliament has changed a law under
which Czechoslovakia's former hard-line Communist leadership
stripped thousands of people of their citizenship after they fled
the Soviet-led invasion in 1968.
   Parliament on Wednesday also enacted a press law abolishing
censorship, which was installed following the invasion.
   The moves were the latest by the non-Communist government, which
took office in December following a popular uprising, to rid itself
of four decades of Communist control.
   According to the new law of citizenship, Czechoslovaks can be
stripped of their citizenship only at their own request.
   Thousands fled the country after Warsaw Pact tanks crushed the
Communist-led Prague Spring reforms and installed a hard-line
government. According to the new law, those people may regain their
citizenship by the end of 1993.
   On Wednesday, the Parliament also passed laws allowing
Czechoslovaks and foreigners to publish their own periodicals.
   However, deputies left intact a constitutional provision that
radio, television and the film industry _ controlled for decades by
the Communists _ are national property.
   Parliament also approved an amendment to the law on copyright
which will, for the first time, also apply to comptuter software,
and revised a law on citizenship.
   Deputies also approved a law opening domestic flights to
airlines other that the official Czechoslovak Airlines and Slovair.
   Other organizations now will be able to compete with the
established airlines but must seek permission from the Federal
Transport Ministry, the official news agency CTK reported.

<HEAD>Moynihan Suggests Taking Lithuania Status to World Court</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Bush administration should seek an
international court ruling that the Soviet Union would have to
observe on the status of Lithuania, Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan
says.
   ``I do ask why no one in the administration seems the least
interested in pursuing a legal approach to a settlement of the
Lithuanian issue,'' the New York Democrat said Wednesday in a
speech at the National Press Club.
   Moynihan is among the growing number of lawmakers of both
parties who are concerned that President Bush isn't doing enough
for Lithuania, a Baltic state that has declared its independence
from the Soviet Union. Soviet troops have been dispatched to the
rebel republic.
   Bush met Wednesday with Republican lawmakers and then had a
separate session with four House members who work with the informal
Baltic Freedom Caucus.
   Rep. Newt Gingrich of Georgia, assistant House Republican
leader, said GOP members had a ``very spirited exchange'' over
Lithuania.
   Gingrich said he was persuaded after the Bush meeting that any
overt U.S. action _ such as formal recognition of Lithuania _ would
trigger the immediate use of force against Lithuania by the Soviet
army.
   Rep. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., a Lithuanian-American who wants the
United States to grant immediate recognition to Lithuania, said his
meeting with Bush was ``frank and candid.''
   He said Bush didn't seem willing to recognize Lithuania as an
independent state but indicated a willingness to take an interim
step, such as meeting with a Lithuanian diplomat. ``A symbolic
gesture is important,'' Durbin said.
   Moynihan promoted his novel approach.
   History has shown that the Soviet Union paid $7.5 million in
gold dollars to Germany for Lithuania in 1939, an illegal act,
Moynihan said.
   ``The administration cannot seem to grasp that at its core this
is an issue which involves violations of law,'' he said. He
suggested asking the U.N. General Assembly to request an opinion
from the International Court of Justice on the issue.
   ``Only by holding (Soviet leader Mikhail) Gorbachev to his own
professions about international law can we provide him with a way
out of the situation he finds himself in,'' Moynihan said.
   ``The point is to do something. Now.''
   Some members of Congress were reluctant to criticize Bush.
   ``I don't criticize the president at this moment in recognizing
that circumstances are very delicate, very serious, and I think he
(Bush) could be given the benefit of the doubt as he deals with
this,'' said House Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash.
   ``The president is correct not to be rattled by day-to-day
events in the Soviet Union,'' said Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind.
   But Durbin said he sensed that Congress is becoming increasingly
agitated over Lithuania, particularly since Gorbachev's decision to
expel foreigners from the republic.
   ``The bottom line is that we ought to be standing by the
Lithuanian people,'' said Sen. Connie Mack, R-Fla.
   Last week, the Senate passed a non-binding resolution that
called on Bush to ``consider the call of the elected Lithuanian
government for recognition.'' First, however, senators rejected a
tougher measure seeking to pressure the president into giving
Lithuania immediate diplomatic recognition.
   The House is preparing to debate later this week a companion
resolution that asks Bush to plan for normalizing diplomatic
relations with Lithuania and to take steps in that direction.
   Lithuania maintains a two-member diplomatic office in Washington.
   In an explanation of the status of the Lithuanian legation
issued Wednesday night, the State Department underscored the United
States' longstanding refusal to recognize the Soviet takeover of
Lithuania. It described Stasys Lozoraitis, the head of the
legation, as the fully accredited representative of the last free
government of Lithuania and as head of the Lithuanian diplomatic
service.
   ``He enjoys the confidence of the president of the Lithuanian
Supreme Council,'' Vytautas Landsbergis, the brief statement said.

<HEAD>Hawke Set For Record Fourth Consecutive Term; Peacock Concedes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD BILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SYDNEY, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prime Minister Bob Hawke formally
claimed an election victory today, ending five days of political
uncertainty and setting his Labor Party to govern for a record
fourth straight term.
   Hawke said he informed Governor-General Bill Hayden it was clear
from Saturday's election that he had a workable majority in the
148-seat House of Representatives, which choses the government.
   In his statement, the 60-year-old prime minister said Hayden
agreed he had won. Hawke, in power since 1983, said he expected to
announce his new Cabinet before next Wednesday.
   Andrew Peacock, who came close to becoming the next prime
minister, conceded defeat and said he will resign as head of the
conservative opposition.
   It was Peacock's second attempt to become prime minister. The
51-year-old Liberal Party leader had allied his party with the
National Party for the race.
   Hawke said the vote would set the course for Australian politics
into the 21st century.
   ``It is the commitment of myself and my colleagues that we will,
from the first day of the new government, set about undertaking the
hard work needed to secure an Australian future of greater
prosperity, social justice, fairness and security,'' Hawke said.
   Peacock had attacked the government for 18 percent interest
rates and a $100 billion foreign debt.
   At a news conference in Melbourne, Peacock congratulated Hawke
on his success and said he hoped the Labor government will live up
to its election promises to Australia's 16.5 million people.
   A final tally of seats is still not in, but according to
political analysts Labor was expected to have 77 seats against 70
for the coalition, with one going to an independent. Labor
previously had 85 seats in the lower house.
   Peacock said he will quit Tuesday as leader of the Liberal Party
and head of the opposition coalition. Political analysts said it
may mark the end of a 26-year career for Peacock in politics.
   ``It is now clear that Labor has won the election,'' Peacock
said. ``I congratulate Mr. Hawke on his success and I trust for
Australia's sake that Labor will govern well.
   ``Some of you have wondered why we have delayed making this
announcement. I can tell you it has been no pleasure but the fact
is it has been extremely close.''
   Peacock would not speculate about his replacement.
   The final outcome has been delayed by the counting of mailed
ballots from Australians residents overseas.

<HEAD>Doctor Says Patient's Wakeup From Coma Still A Mystery</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The doctor of a man revived by
tranquilizers after eight years in a vegatativelike state cautioned
against raised hopes the treatment would help other brain-damaged
people.
   ``It makes me nervous that people are going to see this as a
possibility'' for treating such patients, Dr. Andres Kanner, a
University of Wisconsin neurologist, said Wednesday. ``I think we
are getting excited prematurely.
   ``Every patient is different. Why this happened with this
patient, we don't know.''
   After the case was reported Tuesday, the university received
inquiries from around the world, said hospital spokeswoman
Priscilla Arsove.
   Kanner said the 45-year-old man was awakened temporarily after
being injected with Valium during a routine dental procedure March
12.
   The patient, a former airline pilot who is married with
children, had suffered injuries in a car wreck 10 years ago. He was
in a coma for about three months after the accident, then improved,
but lapsed into a vegetativelike state about eight years ago, the
doctor said.
   The patient, whose identity was being withheld at his family's
request, was being cared for in a nursing home when the drug was
administered, the doctor said.
   Kanner said the patient is being observed at University Hospital
and Clinics in Madison, and doctors are experimenting to find the
right dose of tranquilizers that would allow him to return home.
   When medicated, the man has remained fully conscious for up to
12 hours at a time, Kanner said. During the initial discovery, he
was able to walk with assistance, talk and perform complicated math
calculations.
   When not treated with the medication, he returns to the
vegetativelike state, Kanner said.
   The patient remained in that state Wednesday while doctors
experimented with oral administration of the drugs, Kanner said.
But that procedure so far has not had the same effect as when the
drugs were introduced intravenously.
   The doctors will experiment with dosage levels for a few weeks.
But continuous injections of the tranquilizing drugs ``has its
risks,'' including depression of the respiratory system or heart,
Kanner said.
   A vegetative state is different from a coma because vegetative
patients have sleeping and waking patterns, often open their eyes
and sometimes utter words, experts said.
   Kanner said Wednesday the man was in a ``vegetativelike state''
rather than a ``true vegetative state.''
   The man had some reactions that would not be characteristic of
someone in a permanent vegetative state, Kanner said. For example,
he would sometimes pull his arm away when someone tried to give him
an injection.
   Experts said the man's reaction should stimulate more research
and cause doctors to re-examine some of their patients, but it
probably wouldn't have a significant immediate effect on medical
practices.
   ``It must cause caregivers to be more cautious,'' said Dr.
Richard Foa of Washington, a member of the American Academy of
Neurology's Ethics and Humanity Subcommittee. ``But an anecdote
like this wouldn't alter my practice.''
   Foa said the vegetative state _ and more particularly the
persistent vegetative state _ has been studied as specialists try
to narrow the definition of the condition.
   Usually, a persistent vegetative state patient is given that
prognosis after six months to a year. It is a condition that many
doctors believe justifies the removal of life support systems, Foa
said.
   Kanner said one theory is that benzodiazepines, such as Valium
and barbituates, inhibit certain nervous system functions and may
have blocked the effects of the vegetativelike state on the patient.
   But Dr. Nathan Zasler of the Medical College of Virginia said
drugs such as Valium typically would have a worsening effect on
vegetative state patients.
   The American Academy of Neurology in Minneapolis said there were
about 10,000 persistent vegetative state patients in the United
States in 1988.
   Dr. Catherine Bontke of the Institute for Rehabilitation and
Research in Houston, who is currently caring for four vegetative
patients, said she feared the ``freakish'' report would give
families of vegetative state patients false hope, ``and as a
doctor, that is so painful for me to watch.''

<HEAD>Witnesses Urge Stricter Regulation of Lawn, Agricultural Chemicals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIANE DUSTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans deserve better government protection
from contamination by chemicals used in lawn care and sold to
foreign countries as agricultural pesticides, witnesses told two
Senate committees.
   The Environmental Protection Agency needs to step up its
regulation of lawn care chemicals, the General Accounting Office
said in a report to a Senate committee on Wednesday.
   Another Senate panel was told the United States should ban the
export of agricultural pesticides that are not permitted for use in
this country.
   The import of produce sprayed with these chemicals is a ``circle
of poison,'' said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., chairman of the Senate
Agriculture Committee.
   The GAO report released by the Senate Environment and Public
Works Committee followed a 1986 study that found the EPA had made
little progress assessing the health risks of lawn care pesticides.
The GAO is the investigative arm of Congress.
   The earlier report said the EPA had taken little enforcement
action against advertising claims made by the pesticide industry.
   Peter Guerrero, the GAO's associate director for environmental
protection issues, said the new report shows the EPA still has more
to do.
   ``We also found that prohibited pesticide claims that EPA
classifies as false and misleading are still being made by the lawn
care pesticides industry,'' he said. ``Yet, EPA has taken even
fewer formal enforcement actions in recent years than it did during
the 1984 and 1985 period we reviewed for our earlier report.''
   One of the most popular chemicals, diazinon, was disallowed for
use on golf courses and sod farms because it killed waterfowl and
other birds.
   After several people were poisoned by diazinon, the EPA required
special warnings on its label and said only certified applicators
could use it commercially.
   But Guerrero said the restriction does not apply to commercial
lawn care companies and homeowners.
   A spokesman for the EPA said migratory birds that fed on golf
courses were dying, but the agency doesn't have similar evidence
against diazinon for birds that light in people's yards.
   ``The law says you have to prove a substance has reasonable
adverse effects before you can take it off the market,'' said Al
Heier, the spokesman for EPA.
   In the Senate Agriculture Committee, witnesses testified on a
bill that would stop U.S. companies from exporting agricultural
chemicals that are banned in the United States.
   ``One fourth of the produce we eat is imported,'' said Leahy.
``That's 135 pounds of fruits and vegetables for every man, woman
and child.''
   An agriculture official from Ecuador supported the bill, saying
her country, ``like many developing countries, is not in the
condition to guarantee that highly toxic pesticides will be used in
even a relatively safe manner.''
   Mercedes Bolanos de Moreno, chief of Ecuador's plant protection
program, said her country has no national pesticide policy. The
United States buys large amounts of bananas, coffee, cocoa and
sugar from Ecuador.
   In the last two years, federal inspectors have found U.S.-banned
pesticides in beef from Honduras, pineapples from the Philippines
and beans and carrots from Latin America.
   Jay Vroom, president of the National Agricultural Chemicals
Association, defended the industry in testimony at both hearings.
   ``Some pesticides produced in the United States and sold
overseas are unregistered here because the specific pest controlled
is not a U.S. problem, or crops concerned are generally not grown
in America, like coffee, rubber, cocoa, bananas, tea,'' Vroom said.
   He said attempts to control how other countries use agricultural
chemicals would amount to U.S. imperialism.
   He told Reid's committee, ``Lawn insecticides greatly contribute
to the protection of human health by warding off potentially
harmful bugs, such as ticks, mosquitos, fleas, ants and roaches.''

<HEAD>Two Years After Impeachment, Mecham Still Dominates Political
Landscape</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY LOPEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two years after he was impeached and removed from
office, former Gov. Evan Mecham and his right-wing populist agenda
still dominate Arizona's political landscape.
   Few believe he could win back the governor's office, but Mecham
is running hard for the GOP nomination.
   Meanwhile, the state bureaucracy, ruled by three wildly
different governors in the last four years, is virtually paralyzed
as it awaits yet another master after November's election.
   And the Legislature is wrestling with two Mecham legacies _ a
$250 million deficit and a battle over a holiday honoring Martin
Luther King Jr.
   Mecham, campaigning as an outsider battling the ``power
brokers'' of state politics, has staked his career on opposition to
taxes and government meddling.
   He won the governorship on his fifth try in a three-way race in
1986 but soon got into trouble by rescinding the state's King
holiday and by making remarks that offended blacks, Asians,
Hispanics, women and homosexuals.
   Thirteen months after he took office, the state Senate convicted
him on impeachment charges of misusing $80,000 and trying to thwart
an investigation of an alleged death threat. He was removed on
April 4, 1988.
   The Senate, however, declined to pass a Dracula clause that
would have barred him from running again, and he has risen from his
political coffin.
   ``When the public decides we've had enough even communist
dictators are overthrown,'' Mecham said last week during an
interview between campaign stops. ``The Mecham Militia is stronger
than ever.''
   Political analysts say Mecham could win the Sept. 11 primary,
given the crowded field. No polls have been taken in more than a
month. But in any case, some say, polls have been ineffective in
showing Mecham's level of support.
   ``Evan Mecham has a hard core of supporters that is unidentified
in most polls,'' says Rick DeGraw, a Democratic strategist. ``Evan
Mecham's voters are not average. Everyone that hates anyone feels
comfortable with Evan Mecham. It doesn't matter if they hate trees
... or old people, or lawyers. They'll feel comfortable.''
   Mecham has his own woes. The federal government is trying to
foreclose on his office building, and a state judge assessed him
more than $35,000 in penalties and fees over the allegedly misused
funds.
   But Mecham said of his problems, ``We have it all in hand.'' He
added that he has already collected more than $100,000 in campaign
funds.
   The others in the five-way GOP field are millionaire developer
Fife Symington, former congressman and Mecham aide Sam Steiger,
former Maricopa County Supervisor Fred Koory and former Mecham aide
Bob Barnes, a part-time teacher.
   Symington was the early GOP front-runner. But some say Steiger's
recent entry into the GOP race will take more votes from Symington
and Koory than from Mecham.
   Former Phoenix Mayor Terry Goddard is the Democratic
front-runner, with businessman David Moss and attorney Ray Brown
considered longshots. Gov. Rose Mofford, the former secretary of
state who replaced Mecham, declined to run for election.
   The shift of governors _ from liberal Bruce Babbitt in 1986 to
right-wing Mecham in 1987 to the moderate Mofford in 1988 _ has
left state agencies adrift, said lobbyist Bill Jamieson, who was
Babbitt's chief of cabinet.
   ``When that happens, the bureaucrats tend to dig in and erect
barricades,'' said Jamieson. ``Nobody wants to do anything that the
next governor may dislike.''
   After a long battle over a proposed King holiday, opponents of
the holiday gathered enough signatures to put the issue on the
November ballot.

<HEAD>Aides Say Jesse Jackson May Seek Non-Voting Seat From D.C.</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jesse Jackson, who has ruled out running for
mayor of the nation's capital, may try to become its delegate to
Congress instead, top aides to the civil rights leader say.
   Although Jackson issued a denial, sources said Wednesday that he
is considering running for the non-voting House seat this fall to
boost his presidential prospects and help the District of
Columbia's drive for statehood.
   ``It gives him a base to operate from without eliminating any of
his other options, including the possibility of another national
campaign,'' said one Jackson associate who like others spoke on
condition of anonymity. ``He's seriously considering it.''
   Jackson's political plans have been the subject of great
speculation since he moved to Washington from Chicago last summer.
In February, the two-time Democratic presidential candidate
announced he would not run for mayor and stressed his desire to
serve as ``a national leader.''
   He said Wednesday he not considering the delegate post.
   However, advisers said Jackson's National Rainbow Coalition is
trying to dismantle a city law that would keep him from running for
delegate. The law requires that congressional candidates live in
the city for three years before seeking the office.
   One effort is aimed at persuading members of Congress to amend
the law and another option under consideration is challenging the
law in court, advisers said.
   ``So far, people on the Hill have been generally receptive,''
one aide said. ``It is a non-controversial law, and changing it
should not be difficult.''
   The Rainbow Coalition also has asked a law firm to study whether
the three-year residency requirement can be challenged on grounds
it is stricter than those throughout the rest of the country, aides
said.
   Officials at the law firm did not return calls seeking comment.
   One Jackson adviser predicted Jackson would make a decision on a
congressional run within the next six weeks.
   Sources said Jackson believes the delegate's job would give him
a better opportunity to lobby Capitol Hill for statehood, but that
he is unsure whether it would leave him enough time to push voter
registration drives or run for president in 1992.
   Bert Lance, former President Carter's budget director who was an
adviser to Jackson's 1988 campaign, said Jackson's presidential
chances would be enhanced by first serving in Congress.
   ``It makes him a peer immediately with all the other
office-holders who are likely to run for president,'' Lance said.
   Lance said he had not talked to Jackson about his political
plans recently, but that Jackson considered the delegate's job an
option at the time he decided not to run for mayor.
   The incumbent delegate, Democrat Walter Fauntroy, announced
earlier this month he will run for mayor.

   William J. Keating, president and chief
executive officer of the Detroit Newspaper Agency, is returning to
Cincinnati as chairman and publisher of the Cincinnati Enquirer.
   It was one of several newspaper publishing shifts announced
Wednesday.
   Keating, who also serves as chairman of the board of The
Associated Press, will be succeeded in Detroit by Joseph M. Ungaro,
Gannett Co. Inc., said. Ungaro is a Gannett vice president and
president and publisher of its Westchester Rockland (NY) Newspapers.
   Knight-Ridder Inc. announced that Robert J. Hall, publisher and
chairman of the Detroit Free Press, would assume the same duties at
Philadelphia Newspapers Inc., the company that publishes the
Philadelphia Inquirer and the Philadelphia Daily News.
   Named to replace Hall was Neal Shine, former senior managing
editor of the Free Press who retired last June. Shine has continued
to write a column in the newspaper and was teaching at Oakland
University in Rochester, Mich.
   Keating, 62, moved to Detroit from Cincinnati but had retained
his post as chairman of the Enquirer.
   The Detroit Newspaper Agency is responsible for sales, business
and production operations for The Detroit News, owned by Gannett,
and The Detroit Free Press, owned by Knight-Ridder. The two papers
are under a joint operating agreement which was upheld by the
Supreme Court in November 1989.
   Keating was named to his Detroit Newspaper Agency post in 1986.
Previously, he was publisher and president of The Enquirer in
Cincinnati and a regional president of Gannett from 1979 to 1984.
Before that he was president and CEO of the paper from 1974 to 1979.
   As publisher in Cincinnati, he replaces John Zanotti, who
recently resigned to become publisher of the Arizona Republic and
Phoenix Gazette.
   The announcement was made by John Curley, chairman of Gannett
and James Batten, chairman of Knight-Ridder.
   ``Under Keating's direction, the Detroit Newspaper Agency is up
and running and we have a budget calling for a profit for the year
1990,'' they said.
   Ungaro, 59, has been at the Gannett paper in New York since
1974. He is a past president of the Associated Press Managing
Editors Association.
   The Gannett announcement said Ungaro's replacement would be
named later.

   John E. List thought he was ensuring
salvation for his wife and children by killing them 18 years ago,
according to a confession letter released by prosecutors.
   ``At least I'm certain that all have gone to heaven now,'' List
wrote in a 1971 letter to his Lutheran pastor. ``If things had gone
on who knows if that would be the case.''
   The five-page letter was released Wednesday after Superior Court
Judge William L'E. Wertheimer allowed it as evidence in List's
murder trial.
   ``I know that many will only look at the additional years that
they could have lived but if finally they were no longer Christians
what would be gained,'' List wrote the Rev. Eugene A. Rehwinkel.
   ``Also, I'm sure many will say, `How could anyone do such a
horrible thing.' _ My only answer is it isn't easy and was only
done after much thought.''
   Police found the bullet-ridden bodies of List's wife, Helen, 45;
and children, Patricia, 16; John Jr., 15; and Frederick, 13, lined
up on the floor of the ballroom in their 18-room Westfield mansion
when they entered the house Dec. 7, 1971. They also found the body
of List's 84-year-old mother, Alma, upstairs.
   ``Of course Mother got involved because doing what I did to my
family would have been a tremendous shock to her at this age.
Therefore, knowing that she is also a Christian I felt it best that
she be relieved of the troubles of this world that would have hit
her,'' List wrote.
   Afterward, List said, he prayed for the family. ``That was the
least I could do,'' he wrote.
   The judge released the letter after denying a defense motion
that the document was protected by the priest-penitent privilege.
Opening statements are set for Monday.
   List, arrested in Richmond, Va., in June, argues that he is
innocent because of his mental state at the time the slayings
occurred.
   Handwritten in script on yellow-lined paper, the letter was
dated Nov. 9, 1971. It had been the subject of intense interest
since police found it Dec. 7, 1971, in a filing cabinet in List's
mansion. Police read the letter and called Rehwinkel to the house,
where they let him read it.
   List began by apologizing to Rehwinkel for ``this additional
burden to your work.'' He said his actions went against all he had
been taught and that his account ``will not make it right.''
   He then enumerated his reasons.
   List, then a 46-year-old accountant who was selling insurance,
said he wasn't earning enough to support the family, and was near
bankruptcy.
   He also worried about what Patricia's aspirations as an actress
``might do to her continuing to be a Christian.'' And he was upset
that his wife said she wanted to remove her name from the church
rolls.
   He gives detailed instructions for funeral arrangements, but
returns to religious themes.
   God could have helped, ``but apparently He saw fit not to answer
my prayers,'' he wrote. ``This makes me think that perhaps it was
for the best as far as the childrens souls are concerned.''
   List said in his letter that he shot his family members from
behind because he ``didn't want any of them to know even at the
last second that I had to do this to them.''
   None suffered, but John Jr. ``got hurt more because he seemed to
struggle longer,'' List said. Police said he was shot 10 times.
   List said he had planned to kill them on All Saints' Day, Nov.
1, ``an appropriate day for them to get to heaven.'' But the day
passed, he said, because his travel plans were delayed.
   He signed it ``John,'' and added a postscript:
   ``P.S. Mother is in the hallway in the attic-3rd floor. She was
too heavy to move.''

<HEAD>Vermont Ban on Civil Jury Trials Called Unconstitutional</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL TIGHE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MONTPELIER, Vt. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In 1987 Harriet Smith was the victim of a
truck accident that left her partially paralyzed, with broken bones
and double vision.
   Now, a budget-cutting measure that put a moratorium on civil
jury trials is adding insult to her injuries by frustrating her
pursuit of much-needed cash from the driver whose truck hit her.
   Without that money, the wheelchair-bound mother of two
teen-agers cannot receive the extensive physical and other therapy
she needs, said her attorney, Mary Kirkpatrick.
   Smith's lawsuit against the driver and the college he worked for
was headed for jury selection on Jan. 22 when the Vermont Supreme
Court imposed a five-month ban on civil jury trials at the
Legislature's behest.
   The moratorium should save about $75,000, said Lee Suskin,
director of trial court administration.
   But the Vermont Trial Lawyers Association has filed a
class-action lawsuit to overturn it on behalf of 18 Vermont
residents, saying the ban violates the constitutional right to
speedy trial.
   ``It has a disruptive effect on people every day,'' said Jerome
O'Neill, the lawyers association president. ``They're out there
suffering individually and they certainly continue to.''
   Requests for civil jury trials are pending from more than 3,000
Vermonters, he said.
   Similar bans were overturned by the North Dakota Supreme Court
in January and by the U.S. Supreme Court several years ago, he
said. The association's challenge has been filed in the Vermont
Supreme Court _ the court that made the cut.
   During a typical six-month period, Vermont juries decide about
50 civil trials, which usually involve divorces, property disputes,
personal injury claims, malpractice suits and breaches of contract,
Suskin said. Hundreds of other cases are settled before they go to
trial.
   O'Neill said the people hurt most by the ban are in cases
involving medical expenses and other debts.
   The ban allows litigants to request an exemption for special
cases. Administrative Judge Stephen B. Martin has granted one
exemption and is considering Smith's case.
   Since no trials are being held, lawyers have largely abandoned
their civil cases, meaning few out-of-court settlements, Martin
said.
   ``The importance of setting jury cases and jury hearings is to
get the parties to come to terms and finally resolve the case,''
Martin said. ``That's where the loss is.''
   The ban's impact will be felt long after it is lifted on July 1,
he said.
   ``The attorneys that have jury cases are not giving attention to
these files,'' Martin said. ``It's an area of business that the
attorneys are not addressing because there's no push from the
courts to do so.''
   O'Neill said the blame for the moratorium lies not with the
Supreme Court, but with the Legislature.
   ``They did an across-the-board cut and the judiciary didn't have
the fat,'' O'Neill said. ``They've had to cut heavily into the
meat.''
   The Legislature is considering a budget adjustment that would
give the judiciary an extra $25,000. Suskin said that money would
pay for civil jury trials in May and June.
   Vermont, with much of New England, is suffering an economic
crunch. As part of Gov. Madeleine Kunin's belt-tightening plan,
state departments were ordered to cut spending 2.5 percent.

<HEAD>Panel Said Sleeplessness Among Elderly is Not Inevitability of Age</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Disease, emotional distress and poor sleep
habits are the cause of sleeplessness among the elderly, not just
age alone, according to a new study by a National Institutes of
Health panel of experts.
   ``The (common belief) that you don't need as much sleep as you
age is not true,'' said Dr. Robert J. Joynt, vice president of
health affairs at the University of Rochester and chairman of the
NIH panel that studied sleep problems among the elderly.
   ``In healthy, older people without an accompanying medical
disease, there are very few complaints of sleep disorders,'' Joynt
said Wednesday at a news conference. ``Sleep problems are not
because of the aging process alone, but because of other diseases.''
   Attempts to treat troubled sleep among the elderly often lead to
an overuse of drugs or over-the-counter medications that are
ineffective or even make the condition worse, the report by the
14-member panel said.
   More than half of those over 65 who live at home complain of
sleep problems, the report said, and in long-term care facilities,
such as rest homes, about two-thirds of the patients say they have
sleep disorders.
   And yet, Joynt said, many in medical science know little about
normal sleep or how to treat sleep problems.
   ``Knowledge about sleep and its disorders is lacking and
education is needed at all levels,'' including by physicians, he
said.
   In desperate attempts to treat themselves, the panel said,
elderly patients often resort to the habitual use of
over-the-counter sleep medication.
   ``They (over-the-counter drugs) are used to deal with the
symptoms of sleeplessness,'' said Israel Hanin, a Loyola University
professor and the pharmacology expert on the panel. ``These drugs
may help to make the patient sleepy, but they have side effects and
don't treat the basic cause of sleeplessness.''
   Hanin said over-the-counter sleeping pills can cause problems
with vision and urination, along with a dry mouth and some heart
conditions. And, he said, the pills become ineffective after long
use.
   Powerful prescription sleeping pills are even more dangerous
because they can lead to more serious health problems and
addiction, the panel said.
   ``Our report is quite clear in condemnation in the use of
sedatives for sleep disorders,'' said Dr. Morton C. Creditor of the
University of Kansas Medical Center in Kansas City. ``A major
problem we have to deal with is over-medication among the elderly.''
   Joynt said that people tend with age to develop a different
sleep pattern, but will generally sleep just as much as the young.
   ``For the elderly, sleep at night may be fragmented and not as
deep,'' Joynt said. ``But the elderly often sleep some during the
day so that their sleep is about equal'' to that of younger people.
   Studies, he said, show that many who complain that they can't
sleep at night are actually sleeping more than they believed.
   Sleep problems often are caused by poor sleep habits such as
drinking caffeine at night or drinking fluids that cause people to
awaken at night to go to the bathroom, Joynt said.
   The report said exercise, going to bed the same time each night
and ``the use of the bedroom primarily for sleeping and sexual
activity'' may help.
   Emotional and social developments may also disrupt sleep. Events
such as retirement, depression or changes in natural sleep-rest
cycles can lead to sleep disorders.
   Many sleep problems, the panel said, are caused by medical
conditions that must be treated before the sleeplessness will go
away. Some of the common physical problems that can interrupt
slumber include obesity, alcoholism, breathing difficulty,
arthritis and cardiovascular disease.
   The report called for more research on normal sleep patterns of
the elderly. It also said that sleep disorders should be treated by
specialists using advanced diagnostic tools, and that there should
be controlled clinical trials to evaluate new treatments for
sleeplessness.

   Minorities say they've gotten a small toehold
in broadcasting thanks to 18-year-old rules that give them
preference in seeking radio and television station licenses.
   Once representing just 1 percent of the nation's station owners,
minorities now comprise about 3 percent of the people who control
what Americans see and hear on the airwaves.
   The Federal Communications Commission's minority and female
preference rules have allowed ``missing voices'' to be heard,
backers of the rules told the Supreme Court on Wednesday.
   Opponents, however, said the rules discriminate against white
males. They contended the rules should be dropped and the
marketplace should determine the bidding.
   The two cases involve challenges to broadcast minority
preferences in Florida and Connecticut.
   ``It's clear that the court is very troubled by what the FCC is
doing,'' Andrew Schwartzman of the Media Access Project, a
supporter of the rules, said following Wednesday's oral arguments.
``It's always dangerous to guess (what the court will decide) but
I'm not too optimistic.''
   The Supreme Court upheld a federal public works set-aside
program in 1980, saying Congress had special authority under the
Constitution to enact such programs.
   But a newly conservative majority court last year struck down a
similar set-aside program for minority contractors run by the city
of Richmond, Va.
   One of the court's new conservative justices, Antonin Scalia,
took a leading role Wednesday in questioning whether the FCC's
policy promotes diverse viewpoints.
   ``It has to do with nothing but blood,'' Scalia said, ``not
background and environment.'' He suggested that a black from a
predominantly white community of Scarsdale, N.Y., could receive
preferential treatment under the FCC rules.
   But Margaret Polivy, a lawyer for a Hispanic-owned company in
the Florida case, said ``whether you were born in Scarsdale or
Harlem contributes to what you believe.''
   She said Congress regards women and racial minorities as
``missing voices'' who should be given special consideration in
awarding broadcast station licenses.
   Ms. Polivy represents Rainbow Broadcasting Co., which was
awarded a TV license in Orlando, Fla. A rival, Metro Broadcasting
Inc., argued unsuccessfully before a federal appeals court that it
was denied the license unfairly.
   Gregory Guillot, Metro's lawyer, said the FCC's affirmative
action program ``is a complete, total failure.'' He said the policy
has increased minority ownership of television and radio stations
by only 1 percent in 18 years.
   The Connecticut case is a test of the so-called distress sale
provisions of the FCC rules, which allow a broadcaster faced with
the loss of its license to sell to a minority-owned business at 75
percent of market value.
   Alan Shurberg, who is white, appealed the award of a Hartford TV
station to Hispanic-led Astroline Communications Co.
   The Federal Communications Commission adopted the rules in 1972
and strengthened them in 1978. The FCC under Reagan-era Chairman
Mark S. Fowler tried to rewrite the rules, but Congress said no in
1987.
   The distress sale provisions were struck down in March 1989 on
constitutional grounds by a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of
Appeals in Washington. But less than a month later, another
three-judge panel of the same court upheld the minority and female
preference provisions.
   The FCC now is defending the rules it had tried to scrap.
   The commission maintains that by regulating the ownership of
broadcast outlets, the government will have an indirect impact on
program diversity _ and thereby serve the public interest.
   Daniel M. Armstrong, FCC associate general counsel, told the
court the FCC doesn't exactly know how minority ownership
translates into more diverse views, but the agency believes it does
in subtle ways, such as through news and public affairs programs.

<HEAD>Boycott Hits Businesses But Major Buyer Sticks With Idaho Potatoes</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Some businesses already are snubbing the
state over a tough anti-abortion law, but McDonald's Corp. said its
french fries will be cut from Idaho potatoes no matter what.
   Gov. Cecil Andrus said he will act by Saturday on the nation's
most restrictive state abortion law, passed last week by the
Legislature, and that the boycott by abortion rights supporters
will not be the deciding factor in his decision.
   Some 1,000 abortion rights advocates and 600 anti-abortion
activists held separate Capitol rallies Wednesday to sway the
governor.
   Andrus has said he opposes abortion except in cases of rape,
incest and to save the life of the woman.
   ``I'm going to do what I think is right,'' Andrus said. ``The
economic things, those I'm going to have to handle no matter how it
plays out.''
   Susan Boresow, regional marketing supervisor for McDonald's
Corp., said the company does not involve itself in personal,
ethical, political or religious issues and would not take a stand
on the Idaho abortion issue.
   ``Our customers represent all points of view, and we serve all
of them,'' she said. McDonald's is a big buyer of Idaho potatoes.
   But officials from the state's food processing, printing, travel
and resort industries have already lost orders, Andrus said.
   Commerce Director James Hawkins said anti-abortion forces have
promised to buy more Idaho products, but those offers won't make up
for the boycott threat.
   Andrus declined to identify the companies affected so far or to
give dollar figures for losses.
   Nationally syndicated radio talk-show host Rush Limbaugh, a
conservative, called on his listeners to send a wrapped Idaho
potato to Molly Yard, president of the National Organization for
Women, who has called for a boycott if the bill is passed.
   In West Virginia, anti-abortion activists are adding bags of
Idaho potatoes to their grocery lists.
   ``We're issuing a challenge to the God-fearing people of West
Virginia,'' said Avis Hill, spokesman for the 200-member West
Virginia Parents for Life. ``We're saying to them, if they choose
not to buy Idaho potatoes, we'll buy an extra bag and give it to a
food pantry.''
   The bill would ban 90 percent of the more than 1,500 abortions
performed in the state each year. Abortion would be banned except
in cases of nonstatutory rape reported within seven days; incest if
the victim is under 18; severe fetal deformity and a threat to the
life or physical health of the woman. It would take effect July 1.
   Abortion rights activists promise to challenge the law in what
could provide the U.S. Supreme Court the context it needs to
overturn the 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision that legalized abortion.

   A conference on women's health issues was
canceled out of concern that anti-abortion picketing would
embarrass one of the sponsoring organizations, a participant in the
conference said.
   Organizers assumed that Grand Canyon University, which has
Baptist affiliation, would want to call off the two-day conference
that was scheduled to begin today when they heard about the
pickets, said Bill Byron, a spokesman for Good Samaritan Regional
Medical Center.
   But it turned out university officials were not opposed to the
conference proceeding, Byron said. The medical center was another
sponsor of the conference.
   The Fourth Annual Conference on Woman and Her Family was to have
dealt with issues such as infertility, prenatal care and access to
care by the poor.
   ``Although the conference did not concern the issue of abortion,
it appears that the opponents of abortion rights have decided to
shut down all discussion on the legal issues surrounding fetuses,
even those dealing with carrying a fetus to term and how to combat
infant mortality,'' the Arizona branch of the American Civil
Liberties Union said in a statement.

   Moments after being sworn in, Rep. Jose
Serrano, D-N.Y., said the first thing he wants to do in his new job
is go home to the South Bronx and talk to children.
   ``Part of what I want to do is go right back into the classroom

   He took the oath of office Wednesday, the 38th anniversary of
his mother's arrival in New York from Puerto Rico to join her
husband and seek a better life.
   ``Let the message go from here today to those children who are
still in the projects and who are on the street corner that there
is a better tomorrow,'' Serrano told the House of Representatives
after the swearing-in.
   He was joined on the House floor with three of his five
children. His wife, Mary, brother, other children and about 200
campaign workers stood in the gallery and cheered.
   Serrano, 46, won a landslide victory in a special election March
20 to fill the seat vacated in January when Rep. Robert Garcia,
D-N.Y., resigned. Garcia was convicted of accepting bribes in the
Wedtech influence-peddling scandal.
   Serrano is the only voting Puerto Rican-born member of Congress.
His swearing-in came one day after Susan Molinari, a Staten Island
Republican, took her oath of office. At 32, she is the youngest

<HEAD>Mrs. Baker Has Malignant Growth Removed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Joy Baker, wife of former Senate Republican
Leader Howard H. Baker Jr., has had a small malignant growth
removed from her right lung.
   The tumor was removed Wednesday during a 90-minute operation by
Mayo Clinic doctors at St. Marys Hospital in Rochester, Minn., said
spokesman Tom Griscom.
   A source familiar with her case, who did not wish to be
identified by name, said the growth was ``a low grade tumor'' not a
recurrence of the cancer that was removed from the same lung in
1982.
   She is not expected to require additional treatment, the source
said.
   Mrs. Baker is the daughter of the late Senate Republican leader
Everett Dirksen of Illinois. Howard Baker served in the Senate from
1966 until 1984 and was President Reagan's White House chief of
staff from February 1987 until July 1988.
   The Bakers' primary residence is in Huntsville, Tenn., but they
also maintain a home in Washington, where Baker practices law.

<HEAD>Outspoken Civil Rights Champion to Retire</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Rep. George W. Crockett Jr., D-Mich., who came
to Congress at age 70 after a controversial career as civil rights
attorney and judge, says he will retire after his term expires next
year.
   ``There is a time ... when each man or woman must decide to
leave the day-to-day struggle to others,'' the 80-year-old chairman
of the House Western Hemisphere Affairs Subcommittee said Wednesday.
   Crockett had announced his candidacy for a sixth term but faced
at least two challengers for the Democratic nomination in his
predominantly black Detroit district, which could be eliminated as
districts are reapportioned in 1992.
   He said in an interview the prospect of a tough campaign did not
influence his change of heart. ``I've just gotten older and
wiser,'' he said.
   Crockett recently became the first member of Congress to
advocate decriminalizing drug use, the latest of many stands that
outraged conservatives and even made some fellow liberals uneasy.
   He gained national attention in 1949 for his spirited defense of
11 avowed communists charged with subversion in New York. His
clashes with the presiding judge landed him and four other defense
lawyers in prison for four months on contempt charges.

<HEAD>Lithuania's President Tells Citizens Not To Resist Arms
Confiscations</HEAD>

<DATELINE>VILNIUS, U.S.S.R. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hoping to defuse weeks of tension with
Moscow, Lithuania's president has told citizens of the Baltic
republic not to resist if Soviet troops tried to confiscate their
weapons.
   A deadline set by the Kremlin passed Wednesday without incident
in the republic, which has been at odds with Moscow since it
independence March 11.
   Both sides showed restraint Wednesday, with Lithuania also
shelving plans for border guards and the Soviet army refraining
from seizing more Lithuanian buildings or rounding up more military
deserters in the republic.
   ``At present, establishing border points would be stepping up
confrontation,'' Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis told a
news conference in the capital of Vilnius.
   Landsbergis said he advised Lithuanians not to resist if Soviet
authorities came to seize their hunting guns. At the same time, he
said citizens should treat the officials as uninvited guests.
   This is in keeping with the Lithuanian strategy of refusing to
obey ``foreign'' Soviet law while avoiding violent conflicts.
   The developments came a day after the first violent
confrontations in the standoff with the republic, with Soviet
troops raiding two hospitals and rounding up at least 23 deserters.
   In Moscow, the Soviet military stepped up a war of words against
Lithuania, complaining of increased attacks on soldiers and
accusing it of a campaign to discredit the Soviet army.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, who has promised not to
use force to keep Lithuania from breaking away, ordered the sign-up
for the border guard halted as soon as it began.
   In the same decree last week, he ordered Lithuanians to turn in
their weapons and said those not surrendered by Wednesday would be
confiscated.
   Only about 1,000 of the 30,000 guns registered in Lithuanian
have been turned in to local police, said a Lithuanian Interior
Ministry official, Yaroslav Prokopovich. He said local police were
refusing to hand them over to the Soviet Army as Gorbachev ordered.
   In Moscow, the commander of Soviet paratroopers alleged there
had been an increase in attacks on soldiers since the independence
declaration.
   The Soviet news agency Tass said Col. Gen. Vladislav Achalov
reported ``a noticeable increase in incidents of provocation
against soldiers and armed attacks by groups of young hooligans
against both individual soldiers and military sites.''
   He listed three recent attacks in Kaunas, Lithuania's
second-biggest city. Two of the cases involved ``hooligans''
throwing stones at military guards, he said.
   The Ukrainian republic's popular movement Rukh threw its support
behind Lithuania's new government and urged rallies to support its
independence. But Tass said the Ukrainian government asked local
authorities to ban the rallies.
   Independence movements in several of the Soviet Union's 15
republics, including Lithuania's Baltic neighbors Estonia and
Latvia, are posing a stiff challenge to Gorbachev. Ironically,
Gorbachev's political reform since he came to power in 1985 had in
part paved the way for such dissent.
   In Washington, the State Department on Wednesday night
underscored the United States' long-standing refusal to recognize
the Soviet takeover of Lithuania in 1940. The Soviets crushed the
then-independent Baltic republics after signing a pact with the
Nazis.
   In an explanation of the status of Lithuanian representatives in
the United States, the State Department described legation chief
Stasys Lozoraitis as the fully accredited representative of the
last free government of Lithuania and as head of the Lithuanian
diplomatic service.
   ``He enjoys the confidence of the president of the Lithuanian
Supreme Council,'' Landsbergis said a brief statement issued in
Washington.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher on Wednesday spoke with
Gorbachev by phone for 50 minutes and urged restraint by both
Kremlin and Lithuanian officials, Mrs. Thatcher's office said.
   The Soviet Defense Ministry reiterated that the government
considers Lithuania's declaration of independence invalid.
   ``No one should have any doubt that law and order will be
restored on Lithuanian territory,'' said the statement, which was
published in national newspapers.
   Gen. Valentin I. Varennikov, commander of Soviet land forces in
Lithuania, said the 23 deserters were seized when Soviet troops
raided two psychiatric hospitals in Lithuania. He contended they
had become ``militants'' in the nationalist movement and were
``undergoing special training'' at one of the hospitals.
   Witnesses said some of the deserters were beaten as they were
taken away, the first violence since the standoff between Lithuania
and the Kremlin began.

<TEXT>
   Mikhail Gorbachev isn't the only
superpower leader with secession troubles. Vermont has voted,
999-598, to quit the United States.
   People gathered Wednesday night at the Statehouse to hear the
last of seven statewide debates on whether they should work from
within to reinvigorate U.S. politics or opt out.
   ``Will Vermont become another Lithuania?'' state Rep. Bill Mares
asked as he introduced the principal debaters.
   The answer is no.
   The debates have been a warmup to next March's 200th anniversary
of Vermont statehood. And the vote to secede simply was a fun
exercise in civics.
   Frank Bryan, a University of Vermont political science
professor, argued for secession. The political culture is moribund,
he said, and Congress is ``brain dead.''
   ``The United States needs a sharp slap in the face,'' Bryan
said. ``A century hence, America will say of us, `Thanks, Vermont,
we needed that.'''
   Justice John Dooley of the Vermont Supreme Court argued for
staying in. Vermont farmers need the national market, he said, and
its elderly need Social Security.
   At the close of each debate, the audience has been asked to vote
on the question. Each time, secession has won. The vote total was
the sum of all seven ballots.
   A key question when considering secession would be, ``Can we get
away with it?'' Bryan said. ``Vermonters are very, very practical
people. We know there's no sense trying something unless you can
get away with it.''
   On that point, Dooley quoted a letter from a man in Georgia.
   ``You may have heard of an organization called the Confederate
States of America,'' the letter said. ``As for secession, forget
about it. We tried it, and it didn't work out too well.''

<HEAD>Supreme Court President Says Democracy Demonstrators Tried Fairly</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   China's chief justice today condemned Western
countries for their ``vicious slanders'' against his country's
legal system and said last year's pro-democracy demonstrators
received fair trials.
   ``The hegemonists accused us of conducting secret
interrogations, handing out secret verdicts, refusing to conduct
fair, open trials, and extensively trampling on human rights,'' Ren
Jianxin, president of the Supreme People's Court, said in his
annual report on crime.
   The human rights group Amnesty International, in a report
released last month, said tens of thousands have been arrested
since troops shot their way into Beijing in June to put down the
massive pro-democracy movement, killing hundreds and possibly
thousands of people.
   The report said authorities conducted arbitrary arrests,
detained prisoners without charge or trial and imprisoned or
executed others after unfair trials.
   Another group, Asia Watch, said thousands are languishing in
cramped cells and being tortured by prison guards.
   ``These accusations are deliberate fabrications and absolutely
groundless. These are vicious slanders on China's judicial organs
and judicial system,'' Ren told the National People's Congress,
China's legislature, which is holding its annual two-week session
in Beijing.
   He said all the proceedings were handled according to criminal
procedural law, and all cases that were supposed to be tried openly
were public, ``thus ensuring fair judgments on them.''
   However, reporters' requests to attend such trials have been
repeatedly rejected.
   Liu Fuzhi, head of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, or
prosecutor's office, said demonstrators ``who made radical
statements but did not violate the criminal law'' were not brought
to trial.
   Liu said parts of China saw ``dramatic increases'' in crime,
including murder, robbery, rape and gang activity, but he did not
provide details or numbers. Ren said juvenile delinquency is on the
rise, but also did not give statistics.
   Last year, Chinese courts handled 2.9 million cases, a 27
percent increase over the previous year.
   Of those, 1,815,300 were civil cases, also a 27 percent increase
over 1988, and 694,900 were economic cases, up 35 percent from the
previous year. Eighty percent of civil and economic cases were
settled through mediation, Ren said.
   The economic cases that were settled involved a total of $4.6
billion, a staggering 84 percent increase over 1988. More than
105,000 people were sentenced in those cases, 31 to death for
embezzling large amounts of public funds or taking bribes.
   Pro-democracy demonstrators last year had called for a fight
against corruption.

<HEAD>Damage to Satellite `Skin-Deep' After Nearly Six Years in Space</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARCIA DUNN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A scientific satellite that spent
nearly six years in orbit suffered mostly surface damage,
demonstrating the feasibility of a manned space station, a NASA
scientist says.
   On Tuesday, technicians from the National Aeronautics and Space
Administation removed the last of 57 science and techonology
experiments from the space lab, known as the Long Duration Exposure
Facility.
   ``The surprising thing to us is although there was a lot of
weathering apparent on the outside, most of that weathering was
really only skin-deep,'' William Kinard, chief scientist for the
LDEF, said on Wednesday.
   A NASA study concluded recently that the proposed space station
Freedom would begin falling apart before completion and would need
extensive maintenance in space. But Kinard said the space lab had
fared well in space, boding well for Freedom.
   ``All of our systems have survived better I think than predicted
so you might expect the same thing from the space station,'' he
said. ``The survivability of materials and systems in space is
pretty good.''
   Kinard said concern about Freedom is ``healthy'' but problems of
duration in space can be resolved. The space station is expected to
cost $30 billion by the time its completed and manned in 1999.
   ``We've built a lot of spacecraft that have performed for long
periods of time in space,'' he said. ``The data should give one
confidence that you can design spacecraft and have them work.''
   The LDEF satellite was placed in orbit in April 1984 for an
expected 10 months. Because of delays, however, it was not
retrieved until Jan. 12, when astronauts snared it 200 miles out in
space.
   The six years were the longest time a spacecraft had been in
space before being retrieved for study. None of the experiments
were lost during the long stay.
   Barring a rescue, the laboratory would have come crashing down
through the atmosphere in mid-March and all the experiments
attached to its exterior would have been lost. If not for gravity,
the structure could have lasted many more years in space although
some of the experiments might have decayed, Kinard said.

<TEXT>
   Lester J. Maitland, who earned the
Distinguished Flying Cross in 1927 for his pioneer flight from the
U.S. mainland to Hawaii, has died at age 91.
   He died Tuesday night at a Scottsdale rest home, said family
friend Tad Hankey of Indian Wells, Calif. The cause of death was
not immediately known.
   As an Army pilot, Maitland and co-pilot-navigator Albert F.
Hegenberger flew a three-engine Fokker called the Bird of Paradise
from Oakland, Calif., to Wheeler Field on Oahu in June 1927.
   The 2,400-mile flight took 25 hours, 49 minutes and 30 seconds.
Their navigation was aided by a radio beacon set up by the Army on
the island.
   ``The big thing about that feat was to find the island. It
didn't allow for any mistakes. They didn't have the (navigational)
equipment they have today,'' Hankey said.
   Both airmen received the Distinguished Flying Cross. The pair
were celebrated at a huge reception in Honolulu.
   Hegenberger died in 1983.
   Born in Milwaukee on Feb. 8, 1899, Maitland joined the Air Corps
in 1917. Hankey said Maitland was the first pilot to hit the
200-mph mark and received a congratulatory letter from Orville
Wright.
   During his military career he was an aide to Gen. Billy Mitchell
and to the first secretary of the air, Truvee Davidson.
   At the outbreak of U.S. involvement in World War II, Maitland
was commanding officer of Clark Field in the Philippines when it
fell to Japan.
   Maitland became commanding officer of the 386th Bomber Group in
Europe, where Hankey was his operations officer. The group, flying
Martin B-26 bombers, was cited as the outstanding medium bomber
group in the European theater, Hankey said.
   After the war he became director of aeronautics in Wisconsin in
1949, and then took a similar state position in Michigan from 1950
to 1956.
   Abruptly changing his life, he was ordained an Episcopal
minister in Iron River, Mich., in 1956 and was known as ``the
flying preacher,'' Hankey said.
   He retired to Red Bluff, Calif., but recently had been in a
convalescent home in Arizona, where his daughter, Eileen Knoop,
lives.
   Besides his daughter, Maitland is survived by his wife,
Kathleen, and four grandchildren.

<HEAD>New Estimate of Plutonium Accumulations at Rocky Flats Given</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 62 pounds of deadly radioactive plutonium
escaped into nearly a mile of air ducts during the 38 years the
federal government has operated the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons
plant, officials said.
   That much plutonium could make six bombs and would be worth
billions of dollars if sold on the black market, said Melinda
Kassen, an attorney for the Environmental Defense Fund and member
of a Rocky Flats monitoring committee.
   ``We feel the 28-kilogram figure is fairly solid,'' Jim Breen, a
spokesman for plant operator EG&amp;G Inc., said Wednesday. ``But we
still have more measurements to make.''
   Twenty-eight kilograms is equal to about 62 pounds.
   The Energy Department confirmed in October that there had been
at least one accumulation of plutonium that had ``a serious
potential for causing a criticality accident under certain
conditions.''
   If enough plutonium gathers in one spot, potentially a nuclear
chain reaction and explosion could take place.
   Even if the plutonium poses no risk of criticality _ the point
at which a nuclear chain reaction become self-sustaining _ it still
is dangerous to hundreds of thousands of people in the Denver area,
Kassen said.
   Plutonium is so toxic it is usually expressed in quantities of
grams, a thousandth of a kilogram.
   The Energy Department estimated last year there were 12
kilograms of plutonium in the 4,000 feet of exhaust ductworks for
the hundreds of gloveboxes that workers use to handle and process
the plutonium at Rocky Flats.
   Plutonium operations at Rocky Flats were closed down last fall
for routine maintenance and plutonium inventory, and have remained
closed pending resolution of safety and health problems at the
plant, officials said.
   Breen said Wellesley, Mass.-based EG&amp;G, which operates the Rocky
Flats plant under contract to the Energy Department, was working on
recovering the plutonium. He wouldn't elaborate further.
   ``We will clean out the pipes before we restart,'' said
Catherine Kaliniak of the Energy Department. ``I don't know if all
the activity will be completed prior to restart. But if there is
any safety questions, the energy secretary won't order restart.''
   EG&amp;G last year replaced Rockwell International Corp. as the
plant's operator.
   Kassen, as a member of Gov. Roy Romer's Rocky Flats monitoring
council, was the first one to find out about the situation, and
alerted others. She said she attended a meeting Tuesday night about
the proposed restart of plutonium operations at the plant.
   ``I asked some questions about what they were going to do before
restart,'' she said, but officials were vague.
   So she asked specifically about the criticality report of last
year, which began the assessment of missing plutonium.
   EG&amp;G officials called back Wednesday morning with the figure of
28 kilograms, she said.

   A federal judge ruled the city's method of
electing council members illegal and ordered new elections as soon
as possible to offer better representation to blacks and Hispanics.
   U.S. District Judge Jerry Buchmeyer's ruling Wednesday gives the
nation's eighth-biggest city 30 days to submit a plan for the
special interim election. The judge did not set an election date.
   Buchmeyer said he wanted an election plan with 11 to 15
single-member districts and a mayor elected at large.
   Eight council members are currently elected in single-member
districts, while three, including the mayor, are elected at-large.
   Although 51 percent of the city's more than 1 million residents
are black or Hispanic, only two council members are black. There
are no Hispanic council members.
   ``The 8-3 system for electing members of the city council
violates the Voting Rights Act because it dilutes the votes of
politically cohesive blacks and Hispanics in Dallas,'' Buchmeyer
ruled.
   ``Under the 8-3 system, African-Americans and Hispanics are
denied access to the three at-large seats because they cannot raise
_ from their own communities _ the enormous amount of money that is
required for an effective at-large city campaign in Dallas.''
   Buchmeyer said an interim election would ``end once and for all
the at-large election of all city council members.''
   Only the mayor would be elected at large, Buchmeyer said.
   If the city fails to develop an interim election plan within 30
days, Buchmeyer would devise a court-ordered one, said Betsy
Julian, executive director of the Legal Services of North Texas.
   Mayor Annette Strauss refused to comment on the ruling until she
had studied it.
   The plaintiffs, including two former unsuccessful black council
candidates, claimed the only way to achieve racial equality in the
elections was to have all members of the council elected in single
districts.
   The city had countered with a 10-4-1 plan, which it scheduled to
go into effect in 1991, under which voters would elect 10 council
members from individual districts, four from regional quadrants and
the mayor at large.
   ``The judge suggests that the 10-4-1 system has the same problem
as the 8-3 system,'' said the plaintiff's lawyer, Mike Daniel.
   The suit was filed by the two candidates, Roy Williams and
Marvin Crenshaw, in May 1988. They later were joined by the
Ledbetter Neighborhood Association, a Hispanic group.

   Scores of people were trampled today as thousands
of illegal immigrants from neighboring China stormed the gates of a
race track in hopes of receiving residency rights in this
Portuguese territory.
   Police fired shots into the air and arrested more than 1,000
people to bring the situation under control at the track, where
about 40,000 people gathered for the registration program.
   About 70 people were taken to two hospitals, where they were
treated and discharged, said Nuno Roque, chief of staff for Macao's
Security Force.
   Several pregnant women suffered miscarriages and at least two
men suffered broken bones in the rush, said Dr. Leong Chi-fai,
director of Kiang Wu Hospital.
   The incident occurred one day after the government began an
amnesty program for illegal immigrants whose children earlier
received permission to live in Macao.
   Crowds of other illegal immigrants also demanded they be covered
by the amnesty, and early today police told them to head to an
athletic field near the Chinese border to be registered.
   As the crowd there grew, police decided to move the operation to
the nearby dog racing track. Frantic illegal immigrants afraid they
would miss the registration stormed the gates, pushing and shoving
as police helplessly looked on.
   Police closed the track gates and warned the crowd outside that
people without identification cards would be arrested. Three hours
later, police reported more than 1,000 had been detained.
   Several factories, restaurants and shops were closed or only
partially operating today because employees were trying to register.
   Thousands of Chinese have illegally crossed Macao's porous
border to work in this territory, which enjoys a much higher
standard of living.
   It was unclear whether illegal immigrants who register with
police at the track will be granted permission to live in this tiny
enclave of about 500,000 people at the mouth of the Pearl River in
southern China.
   Even if the amnesty applies, the illegal immigrants would not be
allowed to reside in Portugal under that country's nationality law.
   The Portuguese have agreed to hand over Macao to Communist China
in 1999, two years after the nearby British colony of Hong Kong
reverts to Chinese rule. Beijing has promised both territories can
maintain their capitalist systems for at least 50 years.

   Sobs and cries from hundreds of mourners rang
out at a Roman Catholic church as the caskets of 17 victims from
the Happy Land Social Club fire were arrayed in the form of a large
crucifix.
   One pink coffin for a female victim and 16 blue coffins for
males were carried Wednesday from the Rivera Funeral Home in the
Bronx across the street from St. Joseph's church.
   The dead were among 87 people, most of them Honduran immigrants,
who perished Sunday in the illegal social club that was allegedly
set afire by a spurned lover. It was the city's worst fire in 79
years.
   ``God never, never abandons us. Sudden death is also sudden
mercy,'' the Rev. Henry Hill told more than 1,000 mourners packed
inside the church.
   ``My heart goes out to each and every family,'' said Hill, a
Honduran native. ``The church understands your loss and extends its
sympathies and love.''
   Another 1,000 people unable to fit in the church huddled outside
on the street, about 10 blocks from the scene of the fire.
   The Honduran government declared three days of national mourning
Wednesday and said 78 victims had been identified as Honduran. Most
of the bodies will be buried in Honduras.
   But relatives who are illegally in the United States may not be
able to return if they travel to Honduras to attend burial services.
   Before the Mass, hundreds of mourners prayed in the funeral home
and then stood in the street. At least three women fainted and more
than 15 required medical attention.
   Jose Alvarez, who came for the wake of his brother Denny, 22,
left the funeral home sobbing and clinging to a cousin and friend.
   Across the street on the church steps, Denny's father, Pedro,
railed against the man charged with setting the blaze, 36-year-old
Cuban emigrant Julio Gonzalez.
   ``They ought to take him and give him a public hanging. People
like that don't deserve to live,'' Alvarez said.
   Roses and daffodils in vases and coffee cans were placed in
front of the the smoke-blackened red brick social club. Burned
coats, some still on hangers, lay piled against the building. A
paper sign on a tree listed the victims' names and ages.
   Nearby, family members went to a school to collect their
relatives' personal effects.
   Carlos Pena clutched a manila envelope which held a watch, keys,
and some cash his brother Eli, 26, had when he died at the club.
   The watch arrived with Eli from Honduras, and Carlos said the
timepiece would now be his. ``It means a lot, a reminder,'' he said.
   The wake at the funeral home began three hours after a Bronx
Civil Court refused to let the landlord of the social club reclaim
the establishment until it decides whether the late tenant's widow
should replace her husband in an eviction suit.
   The hearing, scheduled before the blaze Sunday whose victims
included club proprietor Elias Colon, did not delve into
responsibility for the tragedy. It only dealt with the demand of
the building's landlord, One Peach Associates, for Colon's eviction
for failing to pay rent.
   Mayor David Dinkins said legislation would be submitted today to
City Council that would impose heavy penalties on landlords and
operators of illegal social clubs.

   A pizza shop owner who shot a man he'd just seen
kill a woman in a shopping mall said he wouldn't do it again,
although a grand jury decided against indicting him for murder.
   ``I was acting on my reaction to what had happened, and I wanted
to stop the man from fleeing the scene,'' Todd Broom said
Wednesday. ``But if the same thing happened in the parking lot when
I left here, I'd probably think a lot more.''
   Broom, who could have faced a murder charge, fired two shots at
Eddie Edwards' car on March 12 after watching Edwards shoot
Demetria Yvonne Taylor in the Irving Mall parking lot.
   One of the shots hit Edwards, who lost control of the car,
crashed and died at a hospital a short time later.
   ``I'm glad this is behind me and I can go forward now,'' said
Broom, 25.
   Prosecutor Norm Kinne said the grand jury's decision ``reflects
the way the average citizen feels about the case, whether it's
based on the law or not.''
   But, he added, ``I fail to see that Mr. Broom's actions were in
any way justified under the law.''
   ``I'm not thinking of myself as a hero and I don't know what a
hero is supposed to be,'' said Broom, a copier repairman and
co-owner of a pizza parlor.
   Kinne said the grand jury's action won't encourage others to
emulate Broom.
   ``I don't anticipate any of our law-abiding citizens are going
to take this as a sign to pick up their guns and go to the shopping
mall and try to deal out justice,'' he said.
   Broom saw Edwards, 41, shoot Ms. Taylor, 28, in the head and
fired his .44-caliber Magnum twice at Edwards' car when the man
drove away.
   After the shooting, Broom fled and did not turn himself in until
two days later. He said at the time he was afraid he would be
treated as a criminal.
   Broom said that if any money is left over from his legal fund,
he will make a donation to the fund set up for Ms. Taylor's
5-year-old daughter, Tiffany.

   Pizza is great in 30 minutes, but better late
than never, says a highway patrolman who has been lecturing
delivery drivers on how to arrive with pizza and driver in one
piece.
   Managers of the 35 Domino's stores in the Pittsburgh area
suspended their delivery service for four hours Tuesday night so
drivers could listen to Mississippi state trooper Lt. Pete Collins.
   ``I don't know a thing in the world about selling pizzas, but I
do know one subject better than anyone in this room,'' Collins
said. ``That's dying.''
   Critics say the Ann Arbor, Mich.-based company's guaranteed
half-hour delivery has caused accidents by encouraging employees to
drive recklessly. Company officials admit haste has contributed to
some fatal accidents.
   Attorney Kenneth R. Behrend, who is representing a couple
injured when a Domino's car collided with their car, said the
company should drop its guarantee.
   ``It was a great public relations gimmick. It got them their
market share,'' said Behrend, president of the American Trial
Lawyers Association. ``But ... it is causing more problems to the
American public than are needed.''
   Behrend said he knows of 140 accidents where victims or their
survivors have filed suit, are preparing to file suit or are trying
to negotiate a settlement.
   ``We probably have a perception problem,'' said Domino's
spokesman Ron Hingst.
   ``Most people don't know that you can have a pizza out and fully
cooked in 8 to 12 minutes, and that leaves time for driving. If
there's a way we can save 10 seconds in the production of the
pizza, we'll do it,'' he said.
   Hingst said in 1988, half of the 20 accident deaths involving
company drivers had nothing to do with Domino's guarantee.
   Domino's defends the guarantee, which helped spur its explosive
growth in the 1980s. The policy, established in 1973, says if a
pizza is delivered late, Domino's will refund a minimum of $3.
   The company bills itself as the world's largest pizza delivery
company. It sold 250 million pizzas in 1989, posting $2.5 billion
in sales, Hingst said.

<HEAD>Soviet Defense Ministry Offers Amnesty to Lithuanian Desrters</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   In a move that may ease weeks of tension between
Lithuania and Moscow, the Defense Ministry announced it would offer
amnesty to Lithuanian soldiers who deserted the army if they turn
themselves in, Tass reported today.
   The announcement came a day after Lithuania's government made
two conciliatory moves toward Moscow. It suspended plans for
setting up its own border guard and told citizens not to resist if
officials came to their homes to confiscate their firearms in
accordance with a Soviet decree.
   Hundreds of Lithuanian soldiers have deserted in recent weeks,
some complaining of harassment and others refusing to serve in a
``foreign'' army after their republic declared independence March
11.
   The issue was one of many that has led to a buildup in tension
between the Kremlin and the Baltic republic.
   Defense Ministry officials said they ``took the decision not to
bring criminal charges against soldiers of Lithuanian
nationality,'' the official Soviet news agency reported.
   However, it said, soldiers who refuse to turn themselves in will
be ``searched out, detained, and be subject to criminal punishment
in accordance with current law.''
   At least 23 Lithuanian soldiers were rounded up Tuesday in a
pre-dawn raid on two Lithuanian hospitals where they had taken
refuge. Witnesses said some of the deserters were beaten.
   Tass reported earlier today that at least 50 deserters have
returned on their own to their units and more were expected.
   Soviet military officials have warned repeatedly that the
deserters would be searched out and brought back to the army.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Legal liability for the social club fire that
left 87 dead depends on the answers to three questions, according
to some of the city's top lawyers.
   Did the owner and landlord know about the unsafe and illegal
condition of the Happy Land Social Club? What could they have done
about it? And what did they try to do about it?
   The lawyers say those questions deal primarily with matters of
fact, not law, and resist immediate answers.
   ``Everyone's jumping into the pot and pointing the blame, even
though we don't know what happened, and won't know for sure until
the pre-trial stage of any litigation,'' said Bernard Rifkin,
chairman of the real property committee of the state bar
association.
   ``It all depends on the facts,'' agreed Karl Holtzschue,
Rifkin's counterpart at the city bar association. ``If they (the
building owner and the landlord) knew there was something wrong and
didn't do something, they might have some liability. But this is an
area of law that's very fact-specific.''
   Three people held varying degrees of control over the building
in which the club was located.
   The club operator, Elias Colon, died in the fire. Jay Weiss and
Morris Jaffe, whose company, One Peach Associates, held a 30-year
lease for the property, subleased it to Colon. Alexander DiLorenzo
III, who owned the building, leased it to One Peach.
   Lawyers agreed that the chance of criminal charges was slim,
because the fire was apparently the result of arson. But when such
a tragedy occurs, victims' families search for the deepest pockets
to sue. In this case, Holtzschue noted, ``The operator paid for
what he did with his life. You can't get any more out of his hide.''
   That leaves the owner and One Peach, as well as those who will
probably call the defense legal shots in any lawsuit _ their
insurance companies.
   But what DiLorenzo, Weiss and Jaffe knew, what they did and what
they could have done remains unclear.
   The unlicensed club Colon operated had been the scene of arrests
for the illegal sale of alcohol. It had been cited for serious
building and safety code violations and had been ordered to close
in late 1988.
   Colon's lease from Weiss specified that the building was not to
allow any person under the age of 21 years to enter.
   If ``any governmental authority'' complained about the club, the
lease gave the landlord the right to evict the club unless it
quickly corrected the problem.
   The city, of course, did complain, and minors were served, but
did the owner or landlord know? The city says it sent copies of
vacate orders out, but it appears only DiLorenzo received one.
   Weiss's attorneys said they never were formally notified of the
violations, but declined to say if they knew about them anyway.
   One of Weiss's attorneys said his client was not closely
involved with the property. Alan Vogeler told The New York Times
that Weiss, husband of actress Kathleen Turner, had never been
inside the social club and had not visited the property since April
1989. Jaffe's role remains unclear.
   Weiss and Jaffe, however, were trying to evict Colon; that
usually would be a legal mark in their favor, but they apparently
were doing so only because that Colon had not paid his rent.
   Rifkin questioned how much Weiss and Jaffe could have done to
get rid of Colon or correct the building's problems. Because of
city laws and court policies that protect tenants, he said,
``Anytime you try to evict anyone, you've got a nightmare.''

<HEAD>Report: Rafsanjani's Brother on New Hostage Mission in Lebanon</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A newspaper today reported that Iranian
President Hashemi Rafsanjani had dispatched his brother to Lebanon
in a new effort to win the release of Western hostages.
   The conservative Beirut newspaper Ad-Diyar said Mahmoud Hashemi,
Rafsanjani's brother, held meetings with leaders of Hezbollah, or
Party of God, during a weeklong, unannounced visit that ended
Tuesday.
   The newspaper said the envoy also met with Hussein Mousawi, who
heads the Islamic Amal movement based in east Lebanon's Bekaa
Valley. The movement forms the pro-Syrian wing of Hezbollah, Iran's
main ally in Lebanon.
   Ad-Diyar gave no further details and a spokesman at the Iranian
Embassy, who declined to be named, said ``we usually do not comment
on such reports.''
   Hezbollah is believed to be the umbrella for underground Shiite
fanatics holding most of the 18 Western hostages in Lebanon. Eight
Americans are among those held. The longest held is Terry Anderson,
chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press, who was
abducted March 16, 1985.
   Hashemi has made several secret trips to Lebanon to try to
resolve the hostage situation since his brother took office Aug. 3,
following the death of revolutionary patriarch Ayatollah Ruhollah
Khomeini two months earlier.
   Rafsanjani, considered a pragmatist who favors increasing
Western investment in Iran to rebuild it after its eight-war with
Iraq, is believed to be in a power struggle with Islamic
hard-liners in his government who oppose reconciliation with the
West and the release of hostages.

<HEAD>Vietnam's Communist Party Purges Reformist Leader</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vietnam's Communist Party has purged a
member of the ruling Politburo who advocated more democratic
reform, and party leaders affirmed a commitment to socialism
despite its crisis abroad.
   The official Vietnam News Agency said Tran Xuan Bach, the No. 9
man on the 13-member Politburo, was removed ``for his grave
violations on the party's organizational and disciplinary
principles which had caused many bad consequences.''
   The agency was paraphrasing a communique issued at the Central
Committee's eighth general meeting, a two-week gathering that ended
Tuesday in the capital, Hanoi. The report, dated Wednesday, was
seen in Bangkok today.
   The communique did not specify Bach's alleged mistakes, but it
was clear they involved disagreeing with the party's attempt to
avoid substantial political liberalization while easing controls on
the society and economy.
   ``The plenum noted that many socialist countries were being
enmeshed in a comprehensive and most critical crisis ever seen
before,'' the report said in paraphrasing the communique, referring
to recent reform in other communist countries.
   ``However ... the plenum was confident that socialism would
certainly ... surmount difficulties and continue to march
forward,'' the report said.
   It said the plenum concluded that initial successes showed the
party's reforms were correct although ``the country had not yet
gone out of the economic and social crisis.''
   The 1986 party congress endorsed mainly economic changes
including limited private enterprise, decreased state management
and material incentives for farmers.
   The seventh congress will be held the second quarter of 1991,
the plenum communique said.
   In an article by Indochina correspondent Murray Heibert, the Far
Eastern Economic Review said in its Feb. 1 edition that Bach has
been one of the party's leading ideological thinkers in recent
years and frequently had been touted as a possible successor to
party chief Nguyen Van Linh.
   In a speech broadcast by the official radio in January, Bach,
65, said the economy had improved but social unrest remained, with
people demanding more democracy and social justice.
   Countries that have liberalized the economy but not the
political system are facing ``a very tense situation,'' he said.
   But Bach did not call for a multiparty system in Vietnam, only
for more democratic reforms and greater diversity of political
ideas, the Far Eastern Economic Review article said.

<TEXT>
   Leaders of the two parties that dominated
East Germany's first free elections began crucial talks today that
could have a major impact on the pace of unification with West
Germany.
   The talks came hours before the groups that toppled the old
Communist order were to rally throughout the country, protesting
the new leadership's alleged ties to the secret police of the
ousted Communist regime.
   Lothar de Maiziere, leader of the Christian Democrat-led
coalition that finished first in the balloting, said he was
optimistic that a government could be formed with the rival Social
Democrats.
   During a visit in the West German city of Stuttgart on
Wednesday, de Maiziere said that a new governing coalition could be
formed within the next two weeks.
   However, the Social Democrats, who finished a distant second in
the March 18 balloting, have expressed concern about whether they
will be able to work with some of the more conservative elements of
de Maiziere's alliance.
   The Social Democrats also favor a more gradual process for
unification than the Christian Democrats.
   ``We expect to learn where the conversations will lead,'' Markus
Meckel, a Social Democrat leader, told reporters before talks began
today in East Berlin.
   New Forum, which led the revolt last fall that brought down the
government of Communist leader Erich Honecker, called for the
demonstrations to force an immediate investigation of new
Parliament members.
   In Bonn, members of West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's junior
coalition partners, the Free Democrats, joined with the opposition
Social Democrats in rejecting a Kohl government proposal to grant
amnesty to former members of the East German secret police.
   ``Wrongs cannot be allowed to be swept under the table,''
Gerhard Baum, deputy chairman of the Free Democrats, said Wednesday.
   Voting in their first free elections March 18, East Germans
overwhelmingly elected a three-party coalition that favors quick
unification with West Germany and a capitalist economy.
   De Maiziere, who heads the winning coalition; and Ibrahim
Boehme, head of the Social Democrats, both were accused after the
elections of having ties to the former secret police.
   Both men denied the accusations. Similar charges have been
raised against other members of the newly elected 400-member
Parliament.
   The 85,000-member secret police known as the Stasi and its
109,000 informers were used by East Germany's hard-line Stalinist
government for decades to control the country's citizens. The unit
was disbanded after Honecker was overthrown.
   West German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble said Tuesday
that ``a generous amnesty,'' for the Stasi may be needed to quell
further instability in East Germany.
   ``Not everyone who was forced to report to the Stasi was a
criminal,'' Schaeuble said. Kohl later told reporters he agreed
``in principle,'' with the proposal.
   In the East German elections, Kohl backed the coalition led by
de Maiziere.
   Baum said former Stasi members should be allowed to begin new
careers, but it is ``out of the question'' to allow them to hold
important political posts.
   Boehme temporarily stepped down from his party post until his
name was cleared of any Stasi links. Lawmaker Horst Ehmke, a leader
of West Germany's Social Democratic Party, on Wednesday called on
de Maiziere to also resign.
   In the meantime, a reform-oriented Communist government that
replaced the ousted Honecker government continues to handle daily
operations of the country. The retooled Communist Party was soundly
defeated in the elections.
   On Wednesday, an East German prosecutor said that doctors will
decide if Honecker is physically and mentally able to face charges
of corruption and abuse of power.
   Lothar Reuter, East Germany's deputy chief prosecutor, told the
official news agency ADN that medical specialists also will examine
other aging officials accused of misusing their power during the
Honecker regime.
   The comments further increase the likelihood that the ailing
Honecker, who ruled East Germany with the help of the secret police
for 17 years, may avoid criminal trial.
   Authorities already have decided this week not to charge
Honecker, 77 and in poor health, with conspiracy and high treason.

<HEAD>KGB Has Stopped Would-Be Assassins, Paper Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Special KGB guards who protect President Mikhail
S. Gorbachev and other leaders have stopped would-be assassins who
tried to enter government buildings with sawed-off shotguns and
knives, a news report said today.
   ``Every month our men in the Kremlin, on Red Square and other
places expose and detain about a dozen people with criminal
intentions,'' a KGB general, Yuri S. Plekhanov, told the Communist
Party daily Pravda.
   Even in the period of Gorbachev's policy of greater openness,
officials previously have not discussed planned attacks on top
leaders.
   Several weeks ago a popular TV show referred to an effort to
assassinate President Leonid I. Brezhnev in 1969. The effort had
previously only been rumored to have occurred.
   Security for Gorbachev, compared to that for leaders of other
major countries, is erratic.
   When the Soviet leader traveled to Washington in 1987 to meet
President Reagan, U.S. security officers said Gorbachev's security
operated in nearly an identical way.
   But Gorbachev's security details have appeared ragged on other
foreign trips, and at times in Moscow security for Gorbachev and
his wife Raisa appears to be lax.
   Gorbachev, who enjoys stepping into crowds to chat with people
in the Soviet Union and abroad, presents a tougher security problem
than previous Soviet leaders whose public appearances had little
spontaneity.
   Plekhanov said that KGB security guards for the Soviet
leadership have not had to use their weapons since World War II.
   The KGB general said that recently a man waiting in the
reception room of the Communist Party Central Committee pulled out
a sawed-off shotgun, but he was disarmed by KGB Maj. V. Frolov.
   Gorbachev is said to do most of his day-to-day work in the
Central Committee headquarters, although a person visiting the
reception area would be unlikely to get anywhere close to the
Soviet leader.
   Others with bombs, knives and guns have been arrested on Red
Square and in the Kremlin, he said.
   Last year security guards found a knife on a person among the
crowd entering the Kremlin for New Year's festivities.
   A person was arrested with a bomb on May 1, the May Day holiday,
in Red Square, where the entire Soviet leadership gathers atop
Lenin's mausoleum to review a workers' parade.
   The next day, security agents on Red Square arrested a man with
a gun that accidentally went off when he was being detained,
Plekhanov said.
   Besides Gorbachev, the guard unit protects other Soviet leaders,
provides security for parliamentary sessions in the Kremlin and
cooperates with the secret services of other countries during the
visits of foreign dignitaries.
   The KGB guards have good contacts with Scotland Yard, the U.S.
Secret Service, Finnish, West Germany and other security police, he
said.
   Without going into specifics, Plekhanov said the KGB guard is
relatively small and cooperates with other branches of the Soviet
security police during important political events or if it catches
wind of a plot.

   The city's new commissioner of Hispanic affairs
operates an illegal social club that was ordered closed last year
and again Monday for safety and fire violations, city records show.
   Commissioner William Nieves runs the club, El Caney, in a
building that is supposed to be used as a factory, according to
city Buildings Department documents, the Daily News reported.
   Nieves, appointed to the $65,000-a-year commissioner's post
Friday, denies El Caney is a social club, calling it a ``place for
cultural events,'' but acknowledges knowing about fire and safety
code violations cited last year, the newspaper said in a story
published today.
   An ``order to vacate'' sign was posted on the club door Monday
by a mayoral task force that is cracking down on illegal
establishments in the wake of a fire at an illegal Bronx club
Sunday in which 87 people died.
   Nieves said he planned to give up his job as operator of El
Caney.
   ``It's not a bar or a social club. It's a place for cultural
events. ... When we have parties, they can serve liquor when they
have their own private activities. But you can't call that a bar,''
he said.
   Nieves said he had been under the impression repairs ``were the
responsibility of the landlord, not me.''
   The landlord, R&amp;R Real Estate, was unaware Nieves was operating
a social club there, the newspaper said.
   A summons issued by the Buildings Department last April cited
operation of an illegal gathering place without permits, lack of
emergency lighting, missing exit signs and unilluminated exit
signs. The summons cited a certificate of occupancy that lists the
building's function as a factory.

   Karl Brown, a pioneering Hollywood
cinematographer who worked on D.W. Griffith's 1915 silent film epic
``The Birth of a Nation,'' has died. He was 93.
   Brown died Sunday at the Motion Picture and Television Hospital
in Woodland Hills. The cause of death was not disclosed.
   In the early days of Hollywood, Brown worked as a
cinematographer's assistant on ``The Birth of a Nation'' and
``Intolerance,'' another historical extravaganza made a year later
by Griffith.
   Brown created the technique of double-printing that gave a
supernatural radiance to Christ in ``Intolerance.'' He also helped
develop the miniature projection process that magnified models into
monsters for such pictures as ``King Kong.''
   He directed the 1927 film ``His Dog'' for Cecil B. DeMille.
   Brown's screenplay credits included ``Brewster's Millions,''
``One Glorious Day,'' ``Ruggles of Red Gap,'' ``Merton of the
Movies'' and ``The Pony Express.''

   Aviation pioneer Lester J. Maitland,
who in 1927 became the first pilot to fly from the U.S. mainland to
Hawaii, died Tuesday. He was 91.
   As an Army pilot, Maitland and copilot-navigator Albert F.
Hegenberger flew a three-engine Fokker dubbed the ``Bird of
Paradise'' from Oakland, Calif., to Wheeler Field on Oahu in June,
1927.
   The 2,400-mile flight took 25 hours, 49 minutes and 30 seconds.
Their navigation was aided by a radio beacon set up by the Army on
the island.
   Maitland and Hegenberger were awarded the Distinguished Flying
Cross, and were feted at a huge celebration in Honolulu.
   Maitland, who left the military with the rank of brigadier
general, became director of aeronautics in Wisconsin in 1949. He
took a similar state position in Michigan from 1950 to 1956.

related to his treatment.
   Vlahos underwent two bone marrow transplants. He began suffering
from liver and kidney failure early in the second transplant.
   Dravecky, who also suffers from cancer, helped raise more than
$100,000 for the testing process. It was finally discovered that
the boy's second cousin, Linda Snowberger, 31, of New York City,

<HEAD>New Reports Say `Birmingham Six' Were Wrongly Convicted In
Bombings</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A TV documentary identified four people it said
were responsible for IRA bombings that killed 21 people, and a
British lawmaker said new evidence should lead to the release of
the six people who were convicted.
   The Home Office, responsible for law enforcement, said in a
statement today that all four people identified on the television
program had been investigated by police and that the program ``does
not put forward new evidence.''
   Chris Mullin, a member of the opposition Labor Party, said
Wednesday that those convicted, known as the Birmingham Six, were
innocent of the 1974 bombings of two pubs. He said an Irish
Republican Army informer identified one of the bombers, but that
police failed to follow up the lead.
   ``The lie cannot be sustained much longer,'' Mullin told a news
conference to publicize the third edition of his book on the case,
``Error of Judgment.''
   The bombings in the northern city of Birmingham, which also left
162 injured, were the deadliest ever by the IRA in its campaign to
end British rule in Northern Ireland.
   Mullin based his charge on a police document _ a summary of an
interview with an IRA informer _ and said it ``ought to bring the
end of this scandal.''
   Mullin also claims to have interviewed four men who carried out
the bombings. He spoke hours before four alleged bombers were also
identified in Granada Television's dramatized documentary, ``Who
Bombed Birmingham?''
   Mullin declined to comment on the identifications made in the
broadcast but said, ``I advise you to take very seriously'' the
Granada broadcast.
   None of those identified on the program is among the six
convicted of bombing two pubs in Birmingham on Nov. 21, 1974.
   The program identified the suspects as a man who served 12 years
for other offenses, a man serving a life sentence in Ireland for
murder and two men now living in Ireland. One of those two men, the
program alleged, was involved in other IRA attacks including the
murder of 11 people in London in 1982 and the bombing in Brighton
in 1984 that nearly killed Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   Granada said a fifth suspect could not be named for ``security
reasons.''
   The Home Office, however, said ``the people named in that report
were included in the police investigations into the Birmingham pub
bombings and general terrorist activities in the West Midlands at
the time.''
   One was not charged and no evidence had been found to link two
others, the statement said. The fourth man stood trial with the
six, was convicted on a conspiracy count and was sentenced to 12
years in prison, it said.
   West Midlands Chief Constable Geoffrey Dear said Wednesday that
he would investigate any new evidence disclosed by the TV
broadcast. He also said police had never claimed the convicted six
were the only ones involved.
   The IRA's legal political wing, Sinn Fein, denounced the
television program. ``The quality and strength of the evidence
which proves the innocence of the six is not, not should be,
dependent upon pointing the finger of suspicion at others,'' it
said.
   Last week, Home Secretary David Waddington ordered a new
investigation of several matters raised by attorneys for the
Birmingham Six. Waddington has refused to say what specific points
are under review.
   The cause of the six has been taken up by Amnesty International,
the Irish government and most recently by Cardinal Tomas O Fiaich,
the Roman Catholic primate of Ireland.
   Five of the six convicts were arrested the night of the bombings
as they were about to board a ferry to Belfast for the funeral of
an IRA man. All six _ Johnny Walker, Patrick Hill, Hugh Callaghan,
Richard McIlkenny, Gerry Hunter and Billy Power _ were sentenced to
life in prison in 1975.

<TEXT>
   President Bush telephoned Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher to discuss her personal appeal to Moscow for restraint in
the Lithuanian crisis, a British official said today.
   Bush called Wednesday after Mrs. Thatcher sent him a message
about a 50-minute telephone call she had earlier with Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, said a spokeswoman at the prime
minister's 10 Downing St. office.
   ``It wasn't a long call,'' said the spokeswoman, speaking on
condition of anonymity. ``She had sent President Bush a message,
and I think he really rang to clarify some details.''
   British officials have given no details of Mrs. Thatcher's talk
with Gorbachev or his reaction. However, government sources said
Mrs. Thatcher did not seek specific assurances from Gorbachev.
   Officials say the Moscow call was set up partly to discuss a
two-day visit to Britain by West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl that
begins Thursday and a meeting between Mrs. Thatcher and Bush in
Bermuda on April 13.
   A tense standoff between Moscow and Lithuania began March 11
when the Baltic republic defied the federal government and declared
itself independent.

<HEAD>Report Finds Widespread Bias Against Unmarried People in LA</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Single people in the nation's second-largest
city suffer widespread and often illegal bias ranging from rental
discrimination to restricted hospital visits, it was reported today.
   The alleged bias against unmarried people in Los Angeles was
documented by the city's Consumer Task Force on Marital Status and
reflects a national trend, the Los Angeles Times reported.
   City Attorney James K. Hahn declined to comment on the 126-page
report until it was formally released later today.
   ``Most of us aren't living in traditional American families
anymore, and the rights and privileges extended to a few should be
extended to everyone,'' Hahn said when he created the task force in
October 1989.
   According to the newspaper, the report details alleged
discriminatory practices that include landlords who refuse to rent
to single people or unmarried couples, auto insurers that levy
higher premiums or refuse policies for singles, and airlines that
restrict the sharing of frequent-flier awards to spouses or blood
relatives.
   ``Most of these practices are illegal in California,'' said
Thomas F. Coleman, a family law expert and chairman of the task
force.
   ``Discrimination based on marital status is arbitrary,
inappropriate, illegal and unfair _ but it is also a pervasive
national problem,'' Coleman said.
   ``Our report represents the emergence of a new dimension of the
consumer protection movement,'' he said. ``Call it singles'
rights.''
   The report also noted that singles are often charged higher
health club dues than married people and can be denied hospital
bedside visits that are sometimes limited to spouses or family
members.
   The task force report is the result of three public hearings
where about 30 witnesses, including business representatives, legal
experts and politicians, testified about alleged discrimination.
   The single, divorced, separated and widowed collectively make up
55 percent of people 15 years or older, said Coleman.

<TEXT>
   An 11-year-old boy, placed in an orphanage at
Christmastime by the parents who had adopted him six year earlier,
has plenty of offers of a new home.
   The Hephzibah Children's Association orphanage in suburban Oak
Park said countless people telephoned after the boy's story
appeared in news accounts Wednesday.
   ``One man called crying and said he wanted to adopt him,'' said
Annette Anderson, a receptionist at the orphanage.
   Dozens more calls offering a home or financial help came to the
Illinois Department of Children and Family Service and Cook County
Guardian Patrick T. Murphy, who has sued the parents to secure
visitation rights for the children.
   ``It's every little boy's nightmare,'' Murphy said Wednesday.
   ``Mom and Dad were talking about something, and they said they
were going to put me up for adoption. I thought they were kidding.
They weren't,'' the boy says in a tape recording made available by
Murphy.
   The boy blames himself for the situation, in which he was
separated from his 8-year-old brother.
   Murphy's lawsuit, filed this week in Circuit Court, also seeks
to force the parents to pay at least $50,000 in damages for
emotional harm to Rick _ not his real name.
   ``Rick's parents told him they were going to put him into an
orphanage and they did it. It's like telling a kid you're going to
send the bogey man after him and then doing it,'' he said.
   ``He continually blames himself for what happened, thinking he's
a bad boy,'' he said.
   The two boys were adopted by the couple in suburban Bellwood in
August 1984 after their biological mother abandoned them.
   The parents put Rick in an orphanage at Christmas, and got
approval March 9 from Circuit Court Judge Walter Williams to
surrender their parental rights to him.
   In the tape, Rick then apologizes to his brother for a fight the
two had.
   ``Remember that day that I hurt your nose when I beat you up?
I'm sorry for that. I didn't mean it. I hope I get to see you
again.''
   The children's adoptive parents, identified in the lawsuit only
as Joseph and Pamela Doe, said Rick did not ``bond'' to them,
Murphy said.
   The parents said Rick ``is only out for what he can get,'' and
they prevented his younger brother from seeing him, according to
Murphy.
   The parents' lawyer, Mary C. Martin, declined to discuss the
case Tuesday. Calls to her office Wednesday were not returned.
   Murphy said Rick was taken to an Oak Park orphanage and is now
in a temporary foster home. He called Rick a ``normal kid'' who's
never been in trouble with the law.
   ``This is not a schizophrenic kid who is climbing the walls and
throwing feces at people,'' he said. ``He's a normal kid.''
   The lawsuit describes the parents as a middle-class couple who
own two small businesses. Murphy said the lawsuit was unusual only
because parents usually don't separate adopted children.
   ``Before, brothers and sisters weren't separated,'' Murphy said,
``and now you've got bureaucrats and judges who say it's OK.''

<TEXT>
   Iraq today denied it tried to smuggle
U.S.-made nuclear triggers through London, and President Saddam
Hussein accused other nations of trying to slow Baghdad's ``march
of progress.''
   The Foreign Ministry described the charges of smuggling as
``British allegations'' and promised unspecified reciprocal
measures.
   The official Iraqi News Agency said Britain would be held
responsible for any results of its actions.
   Also today, British Charge d'Affaires Robert Kealy was summoned
to the Foreign Ministry and told that Iraq reserves the right to
acquire advanced technology from other countries.
   ``Iraq, which has signed the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty,
maintains its full rights to the transfer of technology from
anywhere,'' he was told by Deputy Foreign Minister Nizar Hamdoun.
   The Iraqi News Agency, which reported the meeting, also quoted
Hamdoun as criticizing what he called a British campaign against
the ``so-called Iraqi nuclear program.''
   ``The current British campaign is trying to provide the
groundwork for an Israeli aggression on Iraq, reminding us of the
year 1981,'' he said referring to Israel's bombing of an Iraqi
nuclear plant.
   Iraq's ambassador in London told the British Broadcasting Corp.
that he ``categorically denied'' the British charges that his
nation was involved in a plot to U.S.-made devices for triggering
nuclear weapons.
   British customs officials said 40 devices known as capacitors
were seized Wednesday in a freight shed at London's Heathrow
airport as they were about to be put on an Iraqi Airways flight to
Baghdad.
   Three people have been arrested in London on charges of trying
to smuggle the weapon triggers to Iraq.
   At a rally in Baghdad today, President Saddam Hussein said that
``enemies of the Arabs'' were trying to hinder the country's
``march of progress,'' but did not specifically refer to nuclear
technology or nuclear weapons.
   ``The fires are intensifying, whether by aggressions or
conspiracies, but the Iraqi people will not be worn down,'' Hussein
told the rally.
   A Foreign Ministry spokesman was also quoted by the Iraqi News
Agency as saying that the arrests and allegation of attempts to
build nuclear weapons were part of an anti-Iraqi campaign launched
by the British government, news media and ``Zionists.''
   Iraq has recently complained of harsh press coverage following
its March 15 execution of Farzad Bazoft, an Iranian-born British
journalist who was charged with spying. Iraq ignored British
requests that the reporter's life be spared.

<TEXT>
   A black prosecutor assigned to work on the
Bensonhurst racial killing case has resigned from the Brooklyn
district attorney's office, reportedly because he believed he was
being used as a token.
   Bruce McIntyre, 36, a Yale law school graduate who has worked in
the office for six years, has submitted his resignation, District
Attorney Charles Hynes said.
   The three other prosecutors working on the case are white.
   Seven whites are charged with murdering a young black man, Yusuf
Hawkins, last summer in the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn, a
predominantly white neighborhood. The first trial in the case was
scheduled to begin next week.
   McIntyre resigned Monday because he believed he was playing a
non-essential role and had been assigned to the case merely for
appearance's sake, according to published reports.
   The Daily News, citing unidentified sources, said McIntyre told
colleagues earlier this week that he ``didn't go to law school to
be a token black.''
   Hynes said McIntyre would have played a a major role in the
case, but acknowledged that he had hoped to have a black on the
prosecution team.
   McIntyre, Hynes said, was ``offered the chance to give both the
opening and closing arguments and he turned it down.''
   But McIntyre was ``told in some fashion that it was important to
have an African-American at that (prosecution) table,'' Hynes said.
``I think that's obvious.''

<HEAD>Watkins Says Rocky Flats Shutdown Threatens Weapon Deployments</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. nuclear arsenal will suffer ``severe
ramifications'' if the government is unable to get its key weapons
production plants back in operation soon, Energy Secretary James D.
Watkins says.
   Testifying Wednesday to a House Armed Services subcommittee,
Watkins strongly hinted that one casualty of the production
breakdown could be the Trident II ballistic missile, considered by
experts to be the most accurate U.S. missile.
   One key breakdown is at the Rocky Flats plant in Colorado, which
makes plutonium triggers for nuclear arms. It has been closed since
last November to correct safety and management problems. Watkins
said he hoped it would be back in operation by this summer, but no
firm date for restart has been set.
   The Energy Department owns all facilities that develop and
produce U.S. nuclear arms.
   Reps. Norman Dicks, D-Wash., and Patricia Schroeder, D-Colo.,
asked Watkins whether the indefinite shutdown at Rocky Flats could
force delays in outfitting newly deployed Trident submarines with
the new missiles.
   Watkins replied that he could not discuss details in public. But
he added that as a general comment, ``I can guarantee if we don't
move aggressively'' to get the weapons production complex back in
full operation soon, ``there will be severe ramifications.''
   He then added, in reference to the Trident missile program:
``That won't be the last'' to be hampered by the interruption at
Rocky Flats and other weapons facilities.
   Watkins also said his department had notified the Defense
Department, ``Yes, there would probably be a negative impact on the
weapons stockpile this year and next.''
   Lt. Bruce Williams, a Navy spokesman, said Watkins' comments
``came as quite a surprise here.'' He said the Navy had not been
notified of any impending shortage of warheads for the Trident or
other Navy nuclear weapons systems. Williams said he could not
comment on specific deployment plans for security reasons.
   Also out of service, due to safety problems, are three reactors
at the Savannah River plant in South Carolina that make tritium, a
radioactive gas needed to boost the explosive power of nuclear
warheads.
   Watkins told lawmakers he hoped to get one reactor restarted by
the end of this year but stressed that questions of reactor safety
and other matters remained to be resolved.
   The Los Angeles Times reported earlier this month that the
warhead stockpile is now so small that the Navy has only enough
armed Trident II missiles, known formally as the D-5, to equip two
Trident subs with a full complement of 24 missiles.
   The first of those two subs, the USS Tennessee, is expected to
go on its first operational patrol from its base at King's Bay,
Ga., by this weekend, said William Arkin, a nuclear arms specialist
for the environmental group Greenpeace.
   The Navy has declined to comment on the timing of the
Tennessee's deployment.
   A second Trident sub, the USS Pennsylvania, is scheduled to go
to sea with Trident II missiles in December, Arkin said.
   The Times report, citing unidentified government officials, said
subsequent deployments of Trident subs are being jeopardized by the
Rocky Flats shutdown.
   That would mean the USS West Virginia, which is to enter service
next spring, might have to be armed with existing Trident I
missiles instead of the new version.
   The first eight Trident subs were deployed with the Trident I
missile, which is less accurate than the new version. The vessels
are scheduled to be re-equipped with Trident II missiles during the
1990s as they brought in for overhauls.
   The Navy plans to build 24 Trident subs and buy nearly 900
Trident II missiles, according to Arkin, whose organization favors
killing the missile program.
   In an interview, Arkin said the Rocky Flats shutdown is
interfering with other nuclear weapons programs, including the
Tomahawk sea-lauched cruise missile, the stealth air-launched
cruise missile and the B-61 and B-83 gravity bombs.

<HEAD>Carter Poll Finds Wide Diversity Among Soviets on Key Issues</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet citizens are split down the middle on
whether government should be responsible for people's well-being or
individuals should be responsible for themselves, a new poll finds.
   A poll of 2,500 Soviets also found that the minority group a
person belongs to _ not age, education or Communist Party
membership _ governs Soviet thought on many issues.
   The poll, released Wednesday by former President Jimmy Carter's
public policy center, found 46 percent of respondents favored the
traditional Communist idea that the state is responsible for
people, 45 percent said responsibility fell to individuals.
   ``Many of those who want rapid change to solve social problems
also hold the state responsible for individual well-being,'' wrote
Ada Finifter, a Michigan State University political science
professor, in a summary of the findings. The fact that so many
others believe in individual responsibility makes it likely that
there will be ``shifting and unstable majorities for various reform
efforts,'' she said.
   The National Center for Public Opinion Research in Moscow helped
direct the poll with American researchers from the University of
Pennsylvania, Michigan State and the Atlanta-based Carter Center,
which is affiliated with Emory University.
   Pollsters conducted 90-minute interviews with 2,485 Soviet
citizens in their homes last November and December. Carter, who
commented briefly as the poll was presented, called it ``the first
ever definitive poll conducted in the Soviet Union.''
   The Soviet Union covers about half of Europe and 40 percent of
Asia. Russian-speaking people live in every part of the country but
are just one of more than 100 national groups; they make up only
about 53 percent of the population.
   The pollsters said deep divisions among ethic groups could spell
trouble for those seeking change.
   ``There is no question that the policies and reforms that will
be implemented ... have to be so crafted as to take into account
the fact that on the most fundamental and deeply felt questions,
the peoples of the Soviet Union inhabit vastly different worlds,''
wrote Ellen Mickiewicz, a Carter Center fellow and political
science professor at Emory.
   The poll found that only 1 percent of the Baltic residents, but
29 percent of Russians, said the Soviet Army always acted in the
interests of the people. Since the poll was taken, one of the
Baltic republics, Lithuania, has proclaimed its independence.
   Communist Party membership did not guarantee support of party
policies, the poll found. Only 25 percent of party members polled
expressed full confidence in the party and 12 percent expressed no
confidence. Party members were somewhat more supportive of rapid
change than non-members, the pollsters said.
   Forty percent said organized religion always acted in their best
interests and 7 percent said it never does. But 38 percent gave no
answer. Among Soviet Georgians, who include a heavy Moslem
minority, 69 percent gave high marks to religion.
   Nationwide, 54 percent said they support free speech even at the
cost of political disorder; 37 percent said public order should be
more important. Only 11 percent of the respondents said they agreed
with the ``old order'' precept of strict income equality; 84
percent want to permit varying incomes.
   Pollsters said that because some Soviet polling methods differ
from those in the United States, no margin of error was assigned to
the study.

   South Africa will propose a new
constitutional plan in talks with black leaders that includes
measures ensuring the political participation of whites, a Cabinet
minister said today.
   Ministers from the white-minority government plan to hold
preliminary talks with leaders of the black-led African National
Congress on April 11.
   ``The government will come to the negotiating table with
definite proposals,'' said Minister of Constitutional Development
Gerrit Viljoen.
   In later, formal negotiations, he said, the government will
demand that the white minority is guaranteed political and cultural
rights in any new government in South Africa.
   Viljoen said the April 11 talks will center on procedural
arrangements and obstacles standing in the way of formal
negotiations.
   He said the South African delegation will be led by President
F.W. de Klerk and Foreign Minister Pik Botha.
   The African National Congress has not yet named its delegation,
but it is known that it will be headed by ANC leader Nelson
Mandela. Mandela was released from prison and the ANC legalized in
February.
   ANC leaders have called for national, non-racial elections to
choose delegates to a constitutional convention, but the government
has said that negotiations should include known and proven leaders
of all political persuasions, without necessarily holding elections.
   Viljoen said leaders participating in the formal negotiations
will have to show a clear commitment to a peaceful, negotiated
solution and have abandoned violence.
   No such requirement has been made for participants in the April
11 talks, and leaders of the ANC's military wing are expected to
participate in the discussions once the government passes
legislation guaranteeing they will not be arrested.
   Six days before the talks, de Klerk is scheduled to meet with
leaders of black tribal homelands and other black officials not
connected to the ANC.

   A fishing boat ran aground and sank in
heavy weather near Kayak Island, but all seven people aboard were
rescued, Coast Guard officials said today.
   The skipper and six crew members donned survival suits, boarded
a life raft Wednesday night and were taken aboard a Coast Guard
helicopter, said Petty Officer Fritz Richter.
   ``This went real well,'' Richter said. ``After the accident,
after the grounding, they did everything right.''
   The 65-foot Attu, a long-line halibut schooner, based in
Everett, Wash., sank in more than 50 feet of water with 1,500
gallons of fuel aboard. A decision on salvage efforts was expected
later today, Richter said.
   The Attu apparently was in transit when it struck a reef about
200 miles east-southeast of Anchorage and began to sink in
8-to-10-foot seas with winds of more than 25 mph, he said.
   Attu Skipper Joe Hackstadt and six crew members were taken to
Cordova, about 50 miles west of Kayak Island, Richter said.

<HEAD>Fees Slashed for Housing Loans to Israel</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: SUBS 4th graf, As part ... to CORRECT that Israeli would get
U.S. loan guarantees for $400 million in private loans and clarify
that it does not get $400 million in direct federal money.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congress is moving toward sweetening an
already sweet loan deal for Israel by slashing millions of dollars
in fees the United States has always charged other countries.
   Israel supporters easily won concessions in the House and Senate
on Wednesday to lower or eliminate fees normally charged borrowers
who take advantage of a U.S.-subsidized housing loan program.
   The concessions are the first of their kind in the program's
30-year history.
   As part of a supplemental money bill that was going before the
full House today, Israel would be able to arrange $400 million in
private loans to build housing for the thousands of Soviet Jews now
emigrating under Moscow's newly loosened policies.
   Repayment of the loans is to be guaranteed by the U.S. Treasury,
making them less risky and therefore obtainable at a lower than
normal interest rate.
   The House Foreign Affairs Committee on Wednesday approved a
provision, sponsored by Rep. Howard Berman, D-Calif., that would
allow the United States to charge a maximum loan origination fee of
one-fourth of 1 percent of the loan amount, rather than the 1
percent charged all other borrowers in the program. That would save
Israel $3 million.
   In addition, Berman's language would let the government charge
Israel no more than $150,000 a year over the life of the 30-year
loan to service the account, instead of the normal fee of one-half
of 1 percent of the outstanding balance. That would save another
$1.85 million the first year, and slightly declining amounts in
later years.
   Acting on similar legislation, the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee was even more generous. It set the same limit on
origination fees, but waived annual service charges entirely.
   Israel last used the housing guarantee program in the 1970s,
when it obtained eight separate $25 million loans. It has paid the
full fees on those loans, said Peter Kimm of the Agency for
International Development, who has administered the program for
most of its 30-year life.
   But Israel supporters successfully argued that the unusually
large size of the current loan _ the largest ever under the program
_ and Israel's excellent repayment record entitle it to special
treatment.
   Kimm likened the fees to what any homebuyer pays for mortgage
insurance, a sort of risk pool which helps defray the costs to the
Treasury of making good on defaulted loans. Overall program fees
will generate about $10 million this year on outstanding loans of
about $1.5 billion, he said.
   Even with the fees, the loan would be a good deal for Israel, he
said.
   ``The borrower gets a loan he could not otherwise obtain, under
far more favorable conditions,'' including a lower interest rate,
he said. ``That's a very good business deal for the borrower, and
they're anxious to do so,'' even with the fees, he said.
   In addition to the financial benefits, Israel also will receive
waivers of several normal requirements of the program, including
some oversight and a stipulation that 90 percent of housing built
is targeted to people with below-median incomes.
   The Bush administration has been lukewarm to the loan
guarantees, saying it could accept them only if Israel promises not
to use the money to settle Jewish emigres in the disputed occupied
territories.
   Israel is the largest recipient of U.S. foreign aid, receiving
$3 billion a year in military and economic support. In addition,
the U.S. ally receives hundreds of millions of dollars worth of
other special benefits, largely because of its clout with Congress.

   A 4-year-old accused of deliberately setting
a bed on fire in his home has been charged with first-degree arson,
police said.
   Investigators say the boy used matches to start the fire on a
bed Monday morning. The Broward Sheriff's Office said the blaze
caused $15,000 damage to the family's apartment in this Fort
Lauderdale suburb.
   The felony charge will ensure state caseworkers become involved
and help the boy, a sheriff's spokesman said Wednesday. The boy was
released to his parents' custody.
   ``When you find that a fire was set intentionally by someone
that young, he obviously needs psychological help,'' said sheriff's
spokesman Al Gordon.
   Florida Health and Rehabilitative Service workers must now
``take judicial notice of this child and get him the help he
needs,'' Gordon said.
   The boy's case will be handled through the juvenile system where
records of the offense are sealed, Gordon said.
   The names of the child and his parents were not released.

   Hundreds of people today took
refuge in churches and schools after savage fighting between Zulu
war bands with guns and knives left at least 25 people dead and
scores injured, authorities said.
   Local reporters described the Edendale area of the southeastern
province of Natal as a ``valley of death'' following the battle
between rival groups for control of several villages. Bodies were
seen lying in village streets and on hillsides in the rugged
countryside.
   Much of the violence has been between supporters of Nelson
Mandela's African National Congress and Mangosuthu Buthelezi's
Zulu-based Inkatha party, which are fighting for control of black
townships in the Natal province.
   Buthelezi's office said today that the two leaders plan to
appear together at a Monday rally to appeal for peace.
   Police and hospital officials said at least 25 people had been
killed and 32 critically injured in two days of bloody clashes.
Scores of other people suffered minor wounds and more than 200
homes were burned, the officials said.
   A police report today said three people were killed in factional
fights in other areas during the past 24 hours, including two women
stabbed to death in a battle between rival groups.
   About 5,000 black trade union members paraded through central
Johannesburg today to protest against government plans to sell off
state enterprises. The chanting marchers, some of them carrying
clubs, called for nationalization of the economy to aid poor blacks.
   Police, some of them using tear gas, broke up about 2,000
workers taking part in a similar march in Pretoria.
   In Edendale, hospital workers said the death toll was higher
than 25 because some bodies were removed by relatives and the
deaths not reported. The workers spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Police Maj. Piet Kitching said police had been fired on several
times as they struggled to halt the fighting. One police officer
had been wounded, he said.
   Police commanders said the situation was quiet around Edendale
today, but some local journalists said they had reports of clashes
in remote rural areas. South African army troops were helping
police patrol roads and villages to restore order. Authorities said
some roads were blocked by bands of armed men and warned travelers
not to use them.
   Hundreds of people, mainly women, children and old people, fled
their homes as bands of Zulus armed with guns, knives and sticks
battled for control of the villages dotting the rugged Edendale
Valley. Frightened people crammed into community halls and schools
for protection and shelter.
   Thousands of people stayed away from work today because bus
service was suspended or because they were too afraid to leave
their homes. Some government offices and courts suspended
operations.
   Opposition lawmaker Pierre Cronje of the Democratic Party
appealed to President F.W. de Klerk to visit the area to witness
the devastation. Cronje said police were unable to stop the killing
and that the government needed to take drastic action to halt the
violence.
   Thousands of Zulu fighters from the United Democratic Front and
the conservative Inkatha movement have been battling around
Edendale since Tuesday.
   Both groups are anti-apartheid, but Inkatha is more tribal-based
and favors a Zulu state.
   Some 3,000 people have been killed in the factional fighting in
Natal since 1986. The latest fighting began after buses bringing
Inkatha supporters back from a rally Sunday were stoned by rival
groups.

<HEAD>Palestinian Press Agency Reopens, Collaborator Killed</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Adds 4 grafs at end to UPDATE with Israel lifting ban on

   The Palestine Press Service, an Arab-run news
agency that played a key role in reporting the start of the
Palestinian uprising, was allowed to reopen today after a two-year
closure.
   Ibrahim Karaeen, co-owner of the agency, said police returned
the key Wednesday and that the telephones began working today.
   ``I hope this means that (Israeli authorities) will realize that
we can make peace only by letting the other side talk and not
stifling us,'' he said.
   The agency was founded in 1977 by Karaeen and Raymonda Tawil,
now a Washington-based journalist, and was long the main source of
news about Palestinian causes for both the Israeli media and the
foreign press.
   Palestinian journalists said they hoped the move would signal
more openness toward Palestinian-owned media which have been
targeted by authorities as a major source of inciting unrest in the
occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Karaeen said army officials told him the office had been closed
because authorities believed it had received funding from the PLO.
   He denied the accusation, contending the real issue was the
agency's ability to report violence and unrest more quickly than
the army.
   The reopening coincided with a marked decrease in anti-Israeli
violence. The number of Palestinians killed in clashes with
Israelis in February was nine, the lowest monthly figure since the
uprising began on Dec. 8, 1987.
   Since the uprising started five Arab-owned news agencies or
newspapers have been closed, six Palestinian journalists have been
deported as uprising activists, and 90 Arab reporters have been
detained, many without formal charges, said Radwan Abu Ayyash, head
of the Arab Journalists Association.
   In the West Bank, a 70-year-old Arab man died today of stabbing
and beating injuries he sustained Tuesday while trying to protect
his 32-year-old son from a group of ax-wielding assailants, Arab
reports said.
   They said the masked youths suspected that Said Kamous' son, who
was killed in the attack, had cooperated with Israeli authorities.
   Kamous was the 201st Palestinian killed by other Arabs since the
beginning of the uprising. In the unrest, 669 Palestinians have
been killed by Israelis, and 43 Israelis and three foreigners have
died.
   In Baghdad, Palestine Liberation Organization chairman Yasser
Arafat said Palestinians will resort to all possible means to
achieve their goal of an independent state in the Israeli-occupied
territories.
   ``We will enter Jerusalem victorious and will raise our flag on
its walls,'' Arafat said at a rally.
   ``I tell them (the Israeli leaders), we will fight you with
stones, with rifles and with Al-Abed,'' Arafat said, referring to
the missile which Iraq tested in December. It is believed capable
of striking targets within Israel.
   Also today, the Israeli government lifted a 30-year ban on
contact between amateur radio operators and fellow hobbyists in
Arab countries, an official at the Communications Ministry said.
   But Israeli radio enthusiasts are likely to meet a wall of
silence on the other side since most Arab countries still bar
communications with the Jewish state.
   The ministry official said the measure was taken to permit
Israelis to contact foreigners in Arab countries.
   Arab nations with the exception of Egypt ban radio
communications with Israel as part of their overall boycott of the
Jewish state.

<HEAD>House Passes Bill to Create Department of the Environment</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Congress is sailing toward creation of a new
Department of the Environment, but the proposal ran into trouble
again at the White House today with a fresh threat of a veto.
   The House voted 371-55 on Wednesday to elevate the Environmental
Protection Agency to Cabinet level. The move is intended to give
the agency greater prestige and influence within the administration.
   President Bush has said he wants to sign such a measure on Earth
Day, April 22. But the White House strongly opposes parts of the
House bill, saying they would infringe on the president's authority
to manage the executive branch.
   The administration particularly opposes a provision that would
give full autonomy to a new Bureau of Environmental Statistics
within the department, including a requirement that none of its
technical reports would be subject to administration review.
   Presidential press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said, ``The
president needs the authority to run his Cabinet as best he sees
fit.'' He said the House version ``gives a degree of independence
to this unit of the agency which we feel is unconstitutional and
certainly is not in the best interests of separation of powers and
presidential authority.''
   Fitzwater added, ``We think we would have a shot at sustaining''
a veto, noting that Bush has won every veto battle so far.
   A similar bill elevating the EPA to Cabinet rank has been
approved by the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee. It has yet
to be taken up by the full Senate, which has been preoccupied with
clean-air legislation.
   In addition to creating the government's 15th Cabinet-level
agency, the House bill requires for the first time that the federal
government comply with the same environmental laws on disposal of
toxic wastes as industry.
   ``We're asking the federal government to live by the same rules
as everyone else,'' said Rep. Hank Brown, R-Colo. He said several
federal facilities in his state have violated toxic waste disposal
requirements for years.
   The House bill also would require:
   _The new Department of the Environment to limit its use of
private consultants and guard against conflicts of interest
involving consultants and outside advisory panels.
   _The director of the independent Bureau of Environmental
Statistics to be a civil servant who would not be subject to
dismissal except for malfeasance.
   _A certain share of senior department officials, including
regional administrators, to be non-political appointees.
   _Strengthening of enforcement against polluters, including the
hiring of additional investigators. The number of criminal and
civil investigators would be increased by 30 percent a year over
five years.
   House Republicans argued that many of the additional provisions
were ``designed to embarrass'' the president and force him to veto
the legislation.
   ``We're not here to fine tune or micromanage,'' complained
Minority Leader Robert Michel, R-Ill.
   But Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., a key sponsor of the
legislation, said the bill was intended not only to change the name
of the EPA, but to address some of its problems.
   The bill will ``depoliticize'' the EPA, provide reliable
environmental statistics and put ``a halt to conflicts of
interests'' at the agency, Conyers said in a statement.
   Conyers cited a 1989 incident in which government scientists
were directed by the Office of Management and Budget to change
their congressional testimony on global warming.
   Neither version of the bill envisions a significant expansion of
the EPA. An independent regulatory agency, the EPA has about 16,000
employees and a budget of $5.5 billion.

   An 11-year-old boy took a bus on a
nine-mile ride through winding roads on the outskirts of Kuala
Lumpur before police caught up with him, it was reported Thursday.
   The New Straits Times newspaper quoted Assistant Police
Commissioner Adnan Baharom as saying an officer saw the bus
speeding by the station Wednesday. There appeared to be no driver,
so the officer began chasing the bus in a patrol car.
   After a few miles, he forced the bus to stop. To his surprise, a
small boy who could hardly see over the steering wheel came out,
the newspaper said.
   Adnan said police were looking for the boy's older brother, who
is in his 30s and apparently encouraged the youth to take the bus
from a station.
   The brother had been following the stolen bus in another vehicle
but panicked and drove off when he saw the police officer, Adnan
said.

<HEAD>Tokyo Displays Garbage Galore in Anti-Trash Campaign</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tokyo ended a campaign aimed at reducing city
garbage with a ``trash bash'' Thursday that featured a fashion show
of used clothing, appliances plucked from dumps, and model
apartments filled with discarded furniture.
   Trash was all over the Tokyo Dome Stadium as Sanitation
Department employees tried to demonstrate just how much refuse this
city of 11.9 million people generates.
   One of the displays was a collection of garbage trucks from
around the world.
   The idea was to help people figure out how to produce less trash.
   According to department figures, Tokyo produced 4.783 million
tons of garbage in 1988. That was enough to fill the 55,000-seat
Dome stadium 15 times over.
   More than 6,400 garbage collectors in 3,547 garbage trucks pick
up after metropolitan Tokyo residents, who each throw away a daily
average of 3.4 pounds of trash.
   ``Tokyo is facing a major crisis,'' said Soji Agata, head of the
Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly's committee on sanitation. ``We and the
Sanitation Department pray every day that our city will not end up
buried in rubbish.''
   The tonnage had remained at a stable level for several years,
but it began to grow at a much faster pace in 1985 and continues to
increase by about 6 percent a year.
   The Sanitation Department says paper trash from computers and
offices has increased rapidly in recent years and accounts for
about 42 percent of Tokyo's garbage.
   Tokyo's 13 trash incineration plants are capable of handling
only 80 percent of an annual 3.5 million tons of garbage that can
be burned.

   A soldier was shot to death and three
others were injured by a grenade in attacks that coincided with the
anniversary Thursday of the founding of the rebel New People's Army.
   There was no claim of responsibility for either attack. The
first occurred about 11 p.m. Wednesday. Police Cpl. Rogelio Millare
said three soldiers were standing near their patrol car in the
Manila suburb of Pasig when assailants hurled a grenade at them
from a passing car.
   One of the soldiers was hurt.
   Early Thursday, gunmen fatally shot Pfc. Ricardo Bucal as he
rode in a car in Tanza, another Manila suburb, Millare said.
   Thursday was the 21st anniversary of the founding of the
Communist rebels' New People's Army. In an anniversary statement
distributed to news agencies, the New People's Army said it is
``determined to win victory within this decade.'' It urged
dissident soldiers to reject coup plots and instead join the
Communist-led revolution.
   The statement made no reference to attacks on soldiers and
policemen around the capital.
   At least nine people, including a lieutenant colonel, have been
killed in the Manila area in the past week in attacks. Police blame
rebels.
   Also Thursday, an anonymous caller telephoned the Japanese
Embassy and said a bomb had been planted there because it was ``our
anniversary.''
   The building was evacuated, but no bomb was found. A Japanese
diplomat said the caller spoke in Tagalog, the main Philippine
language, but did not identify himself as a rebel.
   Concern over security in Manila prompted the U.S. Navy this week
to ban most non-essential travel to the capital. The order, issued
Monday, applies to the 6,000 sailors at the Subic Bay naval base
but not to about 9,000 airmen at the U.S. Clark Air Base.
   Airmen, however, were ordered not to travel at night between
Clark and Manila, 50 miles to the south.
   Meanwhile, a group of dissident soldiers vowed to overthrow
President Corazon Aquino's government.
   ``We reiterate our earlier pronouncement that as the corrupt,
incompetent, vindictive and isolated Aquino regime has, by its own
acts, lost its justification to remain in power, the Filipino
soldiers are no longer under obligation to maintain its
existence,'' the statement Thursday said. ``On the contrary, they
are constitutionally and morally duty bound to topple it.''
   The statement was from the Young Officers Union, which was
linked to the Dec. 1-9 coup attempt.

   A storm tore through southeastern
Bangladesh, killing at least 10 people, injuring 100 and destroying
thousands of mud-and-straw houses, police said Thursday.
   The storm Wednesday night packed winds up to 60 mph. It uprooted
trees, toppled electricity poles and destroyed rice crops in the
Noakhali district near the Bay of Bengal, the police said.
   The storm's full impact was not known because of disrupted
communications.
   Storms last weekend killed 34 people and injured nearly 800 in
eastern and southern Bangladesh.
   Bangladesh, one of the world's poorest nations, is frequently

   A San Francisco travel agency's plans
to sponsor a nine-day ``Third World in America'' tour has riled
Appalachian tourism directors.
   For $500, Global Exchange will take participants on an excursion
through Virginia, West Virginia and Tennessee on June 17-25 to see
impoverished families, crumbling coal mining towns and
appliance-strewn streams.
   ``I suggest that those folks could save a lot of money and get a
great dose of Third World reality simply by walking through the
barrio in Los Angeles,'' West Virginia Commerce Commissioner John
Brown said Wednesday.
   Global Exchange, which has been in business for 1{ years,
specializes in ``awareness'' tours to such countries as Haiti, the
Dominican Republic and Brazil.
   Appalachia will be the agency's first domestic trip.
   ``What brings a place alive and what makes it so interesting are
the people who live there and the problems they're confronting,''
tour coordinator Laurie Adams said Wednesday. ``People would want
to see how they are dealing with unemployment and environmental
problems.''
   Adams said Global Exchange participants are usually students,
community volunteers or government officials interested in meeting
grassroots activists trying to solve social and environmental
problems.
   ``One of the reasons we focused on Appalachia is there are
people working hard to solve their problems,'' Adams said.
   The tentative itinerary includes a visit to a coal mining
symposium in Knoxville, Tenn., talks with members of the Commission
on Religion in Appalachia in Tennessee and a final stop at the
Highlander Education and Research Center in New Market, Tenn.
   Adams said she also was considering visiting Camp Solidarity,
the former headquarters for union coal miners in West Virginia
during their 10-month strike against Pittston Coal Group Inc.
   Don Wick, director of information for the Tennessee Department
of Tourism Development, said he's afraid the tour will reinforce
stereotypes. He said the ``real South'' includes the
``sophisticated and prosperous'' cities of Nashville, Knoxville and
Chattanooga.
   ``If you're looking for poverty and environmental problems, yes,
you can find them in our three states,'' said Cindy Ford,
spokeswoman for the Nashville Chamber of Commerce. ``But I don't
think we have any more problems than any other state.''
   And Brown said: ``If they want to visit West Virginia, they can
come for the whitewater rafting or to visit one of our state parks.
It might be a chance for them to breathe clean air.''

   Prime Minister Bob Hawke claimed
victory Thursday in the March 24 general election, becoming the
first Labor leader to win four consecutive terms.
   His opponent, Liberal Party leader Andrew Peacock, conceded
defeat.
   Final results still are not in, but preliminary results gave
Labor 77 seats in the 148-seat House of Representatives. Peacock's
conservative party won 70, and one seat was held by an independent.
   Hawke, 60, has been in power since 1983 and is the
longest-serving prime minister in Australia's history. He
campaigned on promises of stability. In his acceptance speech, he
promised to work for ``all Australians.''
   ``It is the commitment of myself and my colleagues that we will,
from the first day of new government, set about undertaking the
hard work needed to secure an Australian future of greaster
prosperity, social justice, fairness and security,'' Hawke said.
   Labor was hurt by Australia's $100 billion foreign debt and
record 18 percent interest rates. Going into the election, it held
85 seats in the House of Representatives.
   Peacock, 51, a former foreign minister, campaigned against the
Hawke government's handling of the economy. He also lashed out at a
Japanese proposal to build a high-tech, futuristic city in
Australia.
   This brought charges of racism from Hawke, which Peacock denied.
   It was Peacock's second bid for the leadership. Political
analysts said his defeat may mark the end of a 26-year career in
politics.
   Peacock said he would resign as leader of the Liberal Party, and
he endorsed his treasury spokesman, John Hewson, to replace him.
Hewson said he would retain Peacock in the No. 2 position.

   President Bush, proclaiming the government
``on a wartime footing'' to find a cure for AIDS, today urged an
end to discrimination against AIDS sufferers in the workplace.
   ``We're in a fight against a disease, not a fight against
people. And we will not and we must not tolerate discrimination,''
he said in a speech to the National Leadership Coalition on AIDS.
   Bush's comments reflected no new policy initiatives on the
deadly disease, nor did he address the controversial issue of
immigration restrictions on people infected with the AIDS virus.
   Instead, he touted the $3.5 billion he is seeking this year to
fund AIDS treatment, education and research at the National
Institutes for Health in Bethesda, Md., and the Centers for Disease
Control in Atlanta.
   ``We're on a wartime footing at NIH and CDC. Tonight like every
night, the lights will burn late in Bethesda and Atlanta, as a
group of American pioneers work to solve this problem. If they do _
I should say, when they do _ it will be one of the greatest things
our nation could do for the world.''
   Bush was interrupted several times by AIDS activists.
   Urvashi Vaid, executive director of the National Gay and Lesbian
Task Force, waved a sign reading, ``Talk is cheap. AIDS funding is
not.'' Vaid, who was escorted out by security personnel, later said
she thought Bush said some good things, but should have addressed
the immigration issue.
   Bush eventually paused and interrupted his speech to say that he
hoped he could help the protesters understand that ``Not only you
care but we care too, and I'm going to continue to do my very, very
best.''
   Five protesters were arrested before Bush arrived when they
tried to gain admittance to the conference to hear the president's
speech.
   Bush called for compassion, stating that he and his wife,
Barbara, have lost friends to the disease, friends for whom their
love ``was just as great and just as intense as for anyone lost to
heart disease or cancer or accidents.''
   Bush called on Congress to pass legislation barring
discrimination against those infected with the virus, and he urged
business executives in his audience to keep HIV-infected people in
the workforce.
   ``They can serve many more productive years with no threat to
you, your other workers or your companies,'' he said.
   The president consulted this morning with members of his
presidential commission on AIDS before speaking to the Arlington
audience.
   The immigration issue has prompted several organizations to
announce they will boycott an international conference on AIDS in
San Francisco this summer because they want Bush to lift
immigration restrictions on AIDS-infected people.
   The White House, however, has been trying to deflect the heat to
Congress, saying the administration has done all its authority
allows.
   The French and Swiss have said they won't send official
delegations to the Sixth International Conference on AIDS in June.
   The European Parliament also has called on European scientists
not to attend because of the U.S. immigration policy, and other
organizations _ including the League of Red Cross and Red Crescent
Societies _ have declined to participate.
   AIDS activists had hoped Bush would use his appearance today
before the National Business Leadership Conference on AIDS _ his
first major speech on AIDS _ to address the visa issue, but he did
not mention it.
   The immigration restriction was ordered by Congress, which
passed legislation in 1987 directing that infection with HIV _ the
human immunodeficiency virus that causes AIDS _ be added to the
list of contagious diseases used to prevent foreigners from
entering the United States.
   The White House last year adopted a policy granting 30-day
waivers for people to attend conferences or get medical attention.
It also has expedited waivers for people planning to attend the San
Francisco conference.
   The waiver process was designed to ensure confidentiality, with
no permanent identifying mark on a person's passport, said White
House spokeswoman Alixe Glen.
   But administration officials say that's as far as they can go.
   ``We have done everything within our executive powers to
facilitate travel to this country for the conference,'' Ms. Glen
said.
   As to HIV being on the list of excludable diseases, ``it's a
congressional law. It's up to Congress'' to change it, she said.
   Some lawmakers dispute the White House's interpretation of the
law and say the administration unilaterally can remove HIV
infection from the list.
   The federal Centers for Disease Control has indicated it wants
to remove HIV infection from the list because there is no medical
reason to exclude HIV-infected people from entering the country.
   Legislation is being drafted by Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., to
direct the Department of Health and Human Services, which includes
CDC, to review and revise the list, said Steve Morin, the
congresswoman's legislative assistant for health policy. But, he
said, nothing will happen without input from the White House.
   Dana Van Gorder, an organizer of the AIDS conference, said
several thousand potential participants are boycotting the event,
which had expected to register 12,000 participants.
   Groups that have said they will boycott the conference are from
France, Austria, Brazil, England, Spain, West Germany, Norway,
Denmark, Sweden and Canada. Also canceling were the National Gay
and Lesbian Task Force, the International Association of People
with AIDS and the International Planned Parenthood Foundation.

   A coalition of national groups called Thursday
for stepped-up government research on aging to fight the illnesses
that rob the elderly of their independence.
   The Task Force for Aging Research Funding said the nation is
pouring increasing amounts of money into ``sick care'' for older
Americans while it fails to adequately finance research to help the
elderly stay healthy.
   The coalition called for federal spending of $1 billion a year
on aging research, bringing the spending level up to par with that
for other major health concerns such as cancer, AIDS and heart
research.
   The Alliance for Aging Research, which is leading the coalition,
issued a report warning that the gaps in federal research ``are
placing the successful aging and independence of older Americans at
risk.''
   ``The successes in health and medicine in the 20th century have
primarily saved lives in youth and middle age,'' it said.
``Advances affecting the cure and prevention of chronic illnesses
in late life have been few.''
   John L. Steffens, the alliance's chairman and president and
chief executive officer of Merrill Lynch Consumer Markets, said the
nation pays a heavy price for its inability to cure or prevent
Alzheimer's disease, osteoporosis, urinary incontinence, breast
cancer, arthritis and other conditions that affect the elderly.
   ``Research that will help us avoid these illnesses and the costs
they bring is the most effective investment we can make,'' Steffens
said.
   Ed Truschke, president of the Alzheimer's Association, said
Alzheimer's alone costs the nation more than $90 billion a year,
yet the government spends just $130 million a year seeking a cure.
   ``Research is the only way to control the skyrocketing cost of
Alzheimer's disease,'' he said.
   The alliance report said that as the baby boom generation turns
into the ``senior boom'' in the next century, older Americans will
account for one-half of a health care bill approaching $2 trillion
a year.
   Americans age 65 and older represent more than 12 percent of the
population, and those 85 and older represent the fastest-growing
segment of the population. By 2020, the over-65 population is
expected to more than double to more than 65 million, the report
said.

<TEXT>
   America will shed some light on its evenings
starting Sunday.
   That's right, it's time once again to switch to Daylight Saving
Time.
   That means moving the clock ahead one hour - you remember,
``spring forward.''
   The change means later sunsets, so people can enjoy working on
gardens or outdoor projects, playing sports, having barbecues or
just idly relaxing outside.
   For the record, the official change occurs at 2 a.m. Sunday,
local time.
   Most folks are scofflaws, though, making the change before
retiring or in the morning.
   The law calls for the change to be the first Sunday in April.
Since Sunday is April 1 this year, the switch is as early as can
be, under current rules.
   While it's known as daylight-saving time, the change doesn't
really save any daylight. It just moves it from morning to evening.
   That means that some children wind up waiting for school buses
in the dark in exchange for more time after school to play ball or
join the family in backyard cookouts.
   The idea has been attributed to various people, including
Benjamin Franklin, but it was William Willett of England who
launched the eventually successful campaign for the idea in 1907.
   More time for evening recreation, less need for costly
artificial lights and a possible reduction of evening crime were
cited as major advantages.
   It was the energy saving that prompted first use of
daylight-saving time, in Germany in 1916. Other countries followed
during World War I, returning to standard time afterward and
resuming daylight time during World War II.
   It was the confusion of a crazy-quilt pattern of time
differences that finally led to the adoption of the U.S. uniform
time system in 1966. Before then local communities decided
individually for or against daylight time.
   Today, daylight time is in effect in all areas of the country
except Arizona, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, American
Samoa and the part of Indiana in the Eastern time zone.
   Surveys have found that daylight time is generally more popular
in urban areas, where the afternoon and evening leisure time is
appreciated.
   Rural areas seem to be the focus of opposition, largely because
of the loss of morning light for travel to work and school and
adjusting to the change in dealing with livestock, since animals
don't observe differences in clocks.
   The actual affect on people seems to vary considerably by
geography.
   The standard time zones were set up to be about an hour wide.
That means it should be the same time throughout an area covered by
the apparent movement of the sun in about an hour.
   But, even though the clocks display the same times, sunrise and
sunset actually take place on the eastern edge of a time zone about
an hour before these events arrive at the western edge of the zone.
   For example, while the time is the same in Portland, Maine and
Detroit, the sun will actually rise considerably earlier in Maine.
   Since sunrise is already later, by the clock, in places like
Detroit that are close to the western parts of time zones, shifting
it another hour later in the summer can cause a certain amount of
discomfort.
   The result is that the annual shift to daylight time is
generally more popular in places close to the center or eastern
edge of time zones, such as New York, Washington, St. Louis,
Chicago and San Francisco.
   It may be less appreciated in cities located farther to the west
in their respective time zones, such as Atlanta, Dallas, Detroit,
Cincinnati, Fargo and Boise.

   The delta-winged Pegasus
rocket, designed to put small satellites in orbit after launch from
an aircraft, will have its first flight next week, the Defense
Department said.
   If all goes well, the 41,000-pound rocket will be strapped under
a B-52 and taken to 40,000 feet for launch Wednesday over the
military's Western Test Range, according to the Pentagon's Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency.
   The 440-pound launch payload, dubbed Pegsat, will be placed in a
polar orbit of 368 miles.
   Pegsat will release a small, experimental Navy communications
satellite, agency spokeswoman Jan Bodanyi said Wednesday.
   Remaining on the Pegsat frame will be an instrument package to
send data back to scientists about the stress on Pegasus and its
payload as it goes through the atmosphere and into space, Bodanyi
said.
   Two canisters designed to release chemicals to produce an
artificial ``northern lights'' effect also will be aboard.
   Barium, mixed with a small amount of strontium, will be released
over central Canada shortly after sunset to allow National
Aeronautics and Space Administration scientists to study the
resulting glowing space cloud to learn more about the Earth's
magnetosphere and ionosphere.
   Pegasus, developed by Virginia-based Orbital Sciences Corp. and
Delaware-based Hercules Aerospace Corp., is designed to put small
satellites into orbit cheaply.
   The Pentagon and NASA want to use Pegasus for military and
science satellites, but Pegasus also is expected to attract
business from companies, foreign governments and university
scientists who need a cheap way to put small payloads in orbit.
   An Orbital Science Corp. official estimated the cost of a
Pegasus launch at between $6 million and $8 million, depending on
how much business it gets.

   The chemist who said he discovered a way to
produce nuclear fusion in a lab jar said the overwhelmingly
negative response to his work from other researchers has shaken his
faith in science.
   Stanley Pons commented Wednesday as the British journal Nature
published a highly critical analysis of his discovery in today's
edition that was based on measurements by his University of Utah
colleagues.
   Pons galvanized the science world a year ago when he and a
colleague announced that they had achieved cold fusion. Such a
feat, if true, would give the world a limitless supply of energy.
   Two months after last spring's announcement, Michael H. Salamon,
a physicist at the university who was uninvolved in the research,
set up sensors in Pons' lab for five weeks to check the nuclear
output of his cold fusion equipment.
   ``We did not see a peep,'' Salamon said in an interview. ``There
was not an iota, not a sniff, of conventional fusion occurring. We
saw no neutrons or gamma rays that could be attributed to a fusion
process.''
   Pons responded that Salamon's experiment was poorly performed
and done to please physicists at other universities who were
unhappy that such an important discovery had been made by a
chemist, not a physicist.
   ``It's pretty distressing, because most of the allegations in
the paper are not true,'' Pons said in an interview.
   He said the physicists ignored energy cells in his lab that were
producing large amounts of heat and instead set up their monitoring
equipment to check ones that were making only low amounts. He said
the sensors were also placed at an angle that missed evidence of
nuclear activity.
   ``They were in (the lab) for political reasons,'' said Pons.
``They were embarrassed by this. They were embarrassed that a
chemist had fallen into a nuclear reaction so simply. Their outside
colleagues were putting tremendous pressure on them.''
   Pons again defended his research in his remarks today at the
opening session of a three-day Cold Fusion Conference in Salt Lake
City. He said more than 200 experiments involving 2,000
measurements have produced excess heat that can only be the result
of nuclear fusion.
   Indeed, he said, a few experiments generated ``twice the energy
output that you would expect in a water-cooled nuclear fission
reactor.''
   On Wednesday, Pons also accused Nature of trying to undermine
his work by publishing negative studies while ignoring supporting
evidence.
   A series of critical editorials in the prestigious journal has
been part of a drumbeat of unfavorable publicity, much of it
occurring after other scientists could not duplicate Pons' results.
   ``It's strange to me that if people totally disbelieve it, why
do they persist?'' Pons asked. ``Why don't they leave us alone and
let us get on with our work? Are they afraid something is going
on?''
   Pons said he has lost a year of research because of the need to
duplicate his initial findings to try to answer the skeptics.
   ``It's overwhelming. You can't work scientifically in an
atmosphere like this,'' Pons said. ``My confidence in science is
shaken.''
   However, he said he plans soon to publish ``three massive
papers'' covering heat output from cold fusion ``in which we hope
to set the record straight.''
   Others saw the latest report in Nature as one more reason to
doubt claims about cold fusion.
   ``It's another nail in the coffin,'' commented Ronald Parker,
director of the plasma fusion center at Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. ``They did a very careful search for fusion effects,
and they came up empty.''
   Pons' equipment consists of a palladium electrode wrapped in
platinum and immersed in a flask of deuterium oxide, or heavy
water. When electricity is run through the metals, proponents say,
deuterium atoms fuse, giving off more heat than the energy put in.
   Nuclear fusion is the reaction that powers the stars.
Traditionally scientists have believed that fusion could occur only
at extremely high temperatures.

   Three people charged with trying to smuggle
devices for triggering nuclear weapons to Iraq appeared in court
today, and two were ordered held without bond until a later hearing.
   British authorities also said they were investigating the
alleged smuggling of naval equipment to Iraq, but few details were
released. One news report said documents had been seized in two
British cities and that arrests were expected.
   In San Diego today, an indictment opened in U.S. District Court
charged five people and two British-based companies with illegally
exporting electrical components that could be used in the
detonation of nuclear warheads. Two of the five people indicted in
San Diego were arrested in London on Wednesday.
   Iraq today denied any involvement in the alleged attempt to
smuggle the U.S.-made nuclear weapons devices. Iraq also told
Britain's envoy in Baghdad that it reserves the right to acquire
any advanced technology it wants.
   President Saddam Hussein of Iraq told a rally in Baghdad that
enemies of the Arabs were trying to hinder Iraq's ``march of
progress.'' He did not specifically mention Britain or the
smuggling case.
   In the House of Commons, Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd today
indicated Britain would not sever diplomatic relations with Iraq
but said Britain may pursue some action through the United Nations
Security Council.
   ``I can see considerable risk and damage by breaking off
diplomatic relations ... and no actual advantage,'' Hurd said.
   The two men and a woman who appeared in Uxbridge Magistrates
Court in west London today were arrested Wednesday following an
18-month investigation by U.S. and British authorities in which
American companies cooperated.
   Britain's Customs and Excise Department identified the three as
Lebanese engineer Toufic Fouad Amyuni, 37; Ali Ashour Daghir, 49, a
company director with dual Iraqi and British nationality; and
export executive Jeanine Celestine Speckman, 41, a French citizen.
All gave addresses in or near London.
   They were charged with being involved in the attempted export of
40 electrical capacitors with intent to evade the Export of Goods
Control Order 1989. Amyuni and Daghir were remanded in custody
until a hearing April 5, while Mrs. Speckman was granted bail. She
is to appear in court May 10.
   The San Diego indictment also named Daghir and Mrs. Speckman,
along with three Iraqis: Karim Dhaidas Omran, Wallid Issa Ahmad and
Dafir al-Azawi.
   The two companies, Euromac Ltd. and an affiliated company, Atlas
Equipment Ltd., were both operated by Daghir, according to the
indictment. The document identified Mrs. Speckman as Euromac's
export executive.
   Omran, Ahmad, and al-Azawi were identified as representatives of
an agency of Iraq's Ministry of Industry and Military
Industrialization. It was not immediately clear whether the three
men were today.
   British customs officials said the devices were seized Wednesday
in a freight shed at London's Heathrow airport as they were about
to be put on an Iraqi Airways flight to Baghdad.
   Some news reports said that fake devices has been substituted
for the real ones before customs officials moved in to make the
arrests.
   Customs officials in London, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the capacitors are electrical components used in the
detonation of a nuclear bomb.
   Hussein, in his speech marking Palestinian Land Day, did not
refer directly to nuclear technology or nuclear weapons, but he
attacked unidentified anti-Arab forces he said were holding back
Iraq's ``march of progress.''
   Lately, Iraq has developed long-range missiles thought to be
capable of delivering a nuclear warhead.
   ``The fires are intensifying, whether by aggressions or
conspiracies, but the Iraqi people will not be worn down,'' Hussein
said.
   British Charge d'Affaires Robert Kealy was summoned to the
Foreign Ministry in Baghdad and told by Deputy Foreign Minister
Nizar Hamdoun that Iraq reserves the right to acquire advanced
technology from other countries.
   The Iraqi News Agency, which reported the meeting, also quoted
Hamdoun as criticizing what he called a British campaign against
the ``so-called Iraqi nuclear program.''
   ``The current British campaign is trying to provide the
groundwork for an Israeli aggression on Iraq, reminding us of the
year 1981,'' when Israeli jets bombed an Iraqi nuclear plant.
   An unidentified Foreign Ministry spokesman also said in a
statement carried by INA that Iraq has the right to take
``measures'' based on the principle of reciprocity. It did not
elaborate.
   Relations between Iraq and Britain have been strained since
Iraq's execution March 15 of Farzad Bazoft, an Iranian reporter who
was working for a British newspaper. Iraq accused Bazoft of spying.
Britain reacted by withdrawing its ambassador from Iraq, but it has
shown reluctance to let relations with Baghdad worsen further.
   The British Customs and Excise office said today that
investigations were under way in Scotland and northwestern England
into alleged attempts to export naval equipment to Iraq, but it did
not elaborate.
   Press Association, Britain's domestic news agency, reported that
two arrests were expected, but a customs spokesman, speaking on
condition of anonymity, would not confirm or deny that report.
   Press Association also said authorities seized documents in
Liverpool and Edinburgh on Wednesday in connection with the alleged
naval smuggling.
   Military experts said the capacitors are available only to a
handful of major powers and their export is strictly controlled.
They recalled two previous smuggling attempts, one involving Israel
and the other Pakistan, both believed to have or to be trying to
develop nuclear weapons.
   Gerald Kowalsky, president of CSI Technologies Inc., which made
the devices seized in London, said the San Diego-area company
cooperated with U.S. and British authorities in the investigation.
   Kowalsky said in an interview on ABC's Good Morning America
today that he tipped off authorities when the devices were first
ordered from London.
   ``The whole object of the sting was to get the parts shipped
into the U.K. so they come under British law and then in turn for
British law to be violated, an export had to be attempted,'' he
told ABC.
   The Massachusetts company EG&amp;G said late Wednesday that it also
was cooperating with authorities.
   Five people were arrested in and around London in the case. One,
Iraqi national Omar Latif, was served with a deportation order.
Another, a Cypriot with a British passport, was released after
questioning.
   In Washington, the U.S. Customs Service said sealed indictments
had already been returned in U.S. District Court in San Diego.

   Christa McAuliffe never got a chance to
show schoolchildren the wonders of space, but a planetarium built
in her memory will begin fulfilling her goal this week.
   McAuliffe smiles down from a portrait in the lobby of the $2.6
million planetarium, New Hampshire's tribute to the Concord teacher
killed with six other crew members when the Challenger exploded in
January 1986.
   ``It's almost like we feel she is looking over our shoulders and
we want her to be proud,'' planetarium director Clinton Hatchett
said Wednesday. ``Everything we do, we want to be of the kind of
excellence that she would want it to be.''
   Her husband, Steven, said the planetarium appears to have
succeeded.
   ``I know Christa would be delighted,'' he said after watching a
multimedia, computer-generated program under the planetarium's
40-foot dome and then taking a behind-the-scenes tour.
   He and other guests, including Gov. Judd Gregg, traveled to the
far reaches of the galaxy, watched from the moon's surface as a
lunar lander approached, went for a ride inside the human body and
watched from space as a shuttle approached a space station.
   The feeling of motion was so realistic that some of the VIPs
invited to the preview held onto arm rests.
   ``It puts Disney World to shame,'' Gregg said.
   McAuliffe said the planetarium captured one of the attributes
that led the space agency to choose his wife for a shuttle mission
_ communicating complex topics in an understandable way.
   ``That's exactly what's happening,'' he said. ``It really
graphically demonstrates the beauty of science, the beauty of math.
It's a hard concept to convey by words, but it certainly is an easy
concept the way it's been arranged here.''
   The museum will open to schoolchildren and teachers on Friday.
Until its official dedication in June, the public will be admitted
only on weekends and holidays, and possibly for some weekdays,
depending on demand.
   Gregg has invited President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev to attend the June dedication. He said the White House
has said it will let him know.

   Colombia's largest drug cartel
threatened today to retaliate against the government's renewed
extradition of trafficking suspects to the United States.
   On Wednesday the government extradited its 15th suspect since
its drug war began seven months ago.
   The extradition and threat came amid allegations that the
government was easing its fight with drug traffickers.
   ``We will not remain indifferent in the face of betrayal,
torture, and assassinations of our companions,'' said a communique
signed by the Extraditables, as the leaders of the Medellin drug
cartel refer to themselves.
   The communique was delivered to news media in Medellin.
   The Medellin group is the country's largest drug cartel and was
responsible for 263 bombings and other terrorist attacks since the
government's anti-drug crackdown began.
   The bombings ended after a truce was declared on Jan. 17.
   On Wednesday, Fernando Gutierrez Perez was put on a plane bound
for the United States, said Diva Rojas, a spokeswoman for the
secret police.
   Gutierrez Perez, was flown from Bogota to Miami on a Drug
Enforcement Administration jet, and then flown to Phoenix, arriving
shortly before midnight, said Bill Dempsey, a spokesman for the
U.S. Marshals Service.
   He was expected to be arraigned today in Phoenix, Dempsey said.
   The U.S. Marshals Service said Gutierrez Perez was indicted on
May 27, 1987 in the U.S. District Court in Phoenix on charges of
participating in a cocaine smuggling conspiracy in Arizona,
California, Florida, Colombia and Costa Rica.
   The drug smuggling scheme resulted in the importation of 1,256
pounds of cocaine in February 1987, the Marshals Service said.
   Gutierrez Perez was arrested in late November by Colombia
officials. Dempsey said he was not sure why it took so long to
extradite him, although he noted there had been a ``slowdown'' in
extraditions the past couple of months.
   Ms. Rojas said in an interview that she had no details about the
extradition, the 15th of a Colombian drug suspect since the
government intensified an anti-drug campaign after the Aug. 18
assassination of presidential hopeful Luis Carlos Galan.
   It was the first drug-related extradition by President Virgilio
Barco's administration since Jan. 21, and came after speculation
that the government had suspended the policy as part of secret
negotiations with traffickers.
   On Sunday, Interior Minister Carlos Lemos Simmonds resigned,
saying government resolve to fight traffickers had waned.
   Also Wednesday, police announced they seized 880 pounds of
cocaine in a raid on a processing laboratory on Colombia's southern
border with Ecuador.
   The raid Tuesday was along the San Miguel River, the national
police chief, Gen. Miguel Gomez, said in a communique.
   Led by Pablo Escobar, the Medellin cartel bosses have said they
would abandon their business and submit themselves to Colombian
justice in exchange for an end to extradition. Traffickers have
been able to intimidate or kill judges in Colombia to thwart
justice here.
   Barco and Lemos Simmonds said extradition, the government's main
weapon against traffickers, was not negotiable.
   But there have been allegations that the government has been
secretly negotiating with the traffickers through intermediaries.
On Wednesday, two businessmen said they had represented the
Medellin cocaine cartel in talks with the administration.
   But administration officials said extraditions were being
delayed by legal tactics of defense lawyers. The government now
holds 16 suspects wanted on drug charges in the United States.
   Many top traffickers, including Escobar, remain at large.

<HEAD>Hearings on Federal Milk Marketing Orders Set</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   National hearings on possible changes in the
pricing methods used in federal milk marketing orders will be held
later this year, Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter announced
today.
   ``In recent years, the milk order program has come under
increasing criticism,'' Yeutter said. ``Many believe that the
program's pricing arrangements do not treat dairy farmers in all
areas of the country fairly.''
   Yeutter's announcement and remarks were prepared for a meeting
in Minneapolis, Minn., and released here by the Agriculture
Department.
   Federal marketing orders set minimum prices that handlers, or
bottlers, must pay dairy farmers for Grade A milk, based on the way
milk is used. The highest price is for Class I milk used for
drinking. Class II milk used in soft products such as cottage
cheese, yogurt and ice cream is priced lower.
   Class III milk, at the bottom of the scale, is used for hard
products such as butter, hard cheeses and non-fat dry milk.
   ``Some of the criticism arises because important elements of the
orders have not been reviewed at a public hearing for many years''
and changes in marketing conditions may warrant updating them,
Yeutter said.
   Recent studies by the General Accounting Office, the
investigative arm of Congress, and the USDA's Economic Research
Service recommended hearings and a comprehensive review of the
pricing provisions.
   Yeutter said the plan is for the hearings to be held in several
regions, including the central states, upper Midwest, Northeast,
Southeast, Southwest and West. He said the first could begin in
early September.

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A growing wave of violence is
threatening South Africa's fragile stability, and there are fears
it will undermine efforts to build a multi-racial democracy.
   The violence, most of it among black factions, flared just as
the government launched reforms aimed at ending white-minority
rule. It is frightening whites already nervous about government
moves toward ending apartheid.
   While the reforms announced in February have given radical black
groups more freedom to stage protests, the violence results from
many causes and frictions.
   It reflects the deep divisions in South Africa over apartheid
and poses a major threat to hopes for a peaceful future.
   Hundreds of people have been killed in clashes in recent weeks,
mostly between rival black political and ethnic factions. The
violence is the worst since major anti-government protests in the
mid-1980s.
   It ranges from factional tribal battles in Natal Province and
military coups in the black homelands, to clashes between rival
black political groups and unrest in the black townships.
   The causes range from ancient tribal rivalry to conflicting
views on the country's future.
   There also have been violent confrontations between whites and
blacks.
   In some areas, right-wing whites have formed armed and uniformed
groups that have attacked and beaten blacks involved in political
activities. In one rural town, right-wingers have started to take
the place of the local police.
   Political analysts say the white-black clashes, relatively minor
to this point, represent the most serious threat to peace. They
fear a backlash by the powerful 5-million-strong white minority
against anti-apartheid efforts and black violence.
   ``The war in Natal, with its ghastly death toll, the killings in
townships and the burning of properties and people, are raising
fears of a situation that could get out of hand,'' The Citizen
newspaper said in a March 29 editorial.
   A ``white backlash ... is grave cause for concern ... in the
end, we may descend into the kind of Beirut situation that would
destroy this country,'' the newspaper said.
   Unease among whites is matched by growing militancy among many
young blacks in the townships. Radical blacks are reluctant to wait
for negotiated or gradual reform and are flocking to militant
groups that talk of seizing power.
   ``The high incidence of unrest points to a revolutionary
climate, and that is dangerous at a time when restraint is
necessary in order to negotiate,'' one analyst said on condition of
not being identified.
   Nelson Mandela and other black leaders have had little success
in curbing the violence.
   Mandela's African National Congress, the main black opposition
group, favors negotiated settlement. But it is under pressure from
the Pan African Congress and more radical groups who oppose a
negotiated deal.
   President F.W. de Klerk faces similar problems in retaining
white support. He stunned the nation in February by legalizing
black opposition groups, then freed Mandela after the black leader
had spent 27 years in prison.
   Talks between the government and black leaders are scheduled
April 11 to try to clear the way for full-scale negotiations on
changing the constitution to give blacks a voice in national
affairs.
   Many whites are stunned by the lightning pace of change in South
Africa after some 350 years of white domination. They also fear
demands by black groups for a redistribution of wealth from whites
to blacks.
   The president must persuade a majority of whites to accept the
end of apartheid if a new political system is to be established.
Failure to keep white support would imperil the government's
chances of reforms.

<TEXT>
   The case of two brothers charged with their
parents' Yom Kippur murders became a Cain-and-Abel tale of betrayal
as one sibling confessed and agreed to help prosecutors seek the
death penalty for his brother.
   Stewart Woodman decided to testify against his brother, Neil,
and two other men in order to save his own life, his lawyer said
Wednesday as Woodman's surprise decision was announced.
   ``When we began this case it was our earnest desire to be
certain that Stewart Woodman would not receive the death penalty,''
said attorney Jay Jaffe.
   ``Stewart Woodman and I are satisfied that he does not face the
prospect of being executed in the California gas chamber,'' Jaffe
said. ``He has more years to live and think about what happened.''
   Jaffe called the decision to turn state's evidence ``a cleansing
of the soul'' for his client.
   The announcement by the 40-year-old Woodman came the day the
death-penalty phase of his trial was to begin. He was convicted
March 7 of two counts of first-degree murder and one count of
conspiracy.
   The pudgy, balding defendant affirmed in a brief Superior Court
appearance Wednesday that he would testify for the prosecution
against the three others. Their trial is set for April 6.
   Deputy District Attorney Patrick R. Dixon said he would
recommend that Stewart Woodman be sentenced to life in prison
without possibility of parole if he abides by his agreement to
testify. Woodman waived all rights of appeal as part of the deal.
   Dixon said he would seek the death penalty for Neil Woodman, 46,
and the two alleged hitmen, and ruled out agreeing to any type of
deal for them.
   The Woodman brothers were accused of hiring assassins to kill
their parents for their mother's $500,000 life insurance policy and
out of hatred toward their father.
   ``How could they hate their parents so much?'' Dixon asked
during Stewart Woodman's trial. ``The answer is greed. They hated
their parents.''
   The prosecutor said relations in the Jewish family soured when
the sons started working in the family's suburban Chatsworth
plastic business and managed to oust their father from the company.
   The elder Woodmans, Gerald, 67, and Vera, 63, were ambushed in
the parking garage of their condominium on Sept. 25, 1985, as they
returned home from a Yom Kippur gathering.
   The case originally had been tagged the ``Ninja murders''
because the assailants were dressed in black garb similar in
appearance to that worn by the mythical Japanese warriors.
   Dixon said Stewart Woodman confessed during a tear-filled,
eight-hour videotaped session that was ``very rich in detail'' of
the roles played by other defendants.
   Another defendant, Anthony Majoy, was convicted of the same
charges as Stewart Woodman and was to have faced jurors with
Woodman. But the prosecutor said he also would recommend life
without parole for Majoy, 51, said to have acted as lookout.
Stewart Woodman's sentencing was set for June 27 and Majoy's for
June 29.
   In addition to Neil Woodman, the remaining defendants are Steven
Homick, 49, who was a Los Angeles police officer for 14 months in
1963 and 1964, and his 38-year-old brother, Robert Homick, a Los
Angeles attorney.
   Steven Homick, the alleged triggerman in the couple's killing,
already was sentenced to death for a triple murder in Las Vegas.

   Hundreds of soldiers and police
officers stormed a prison today where inmates rioted and set fires,
and one prisoner was killed and 30 people were injured, the state
news agency said.
   The report said authorities were forced to open fire on the
inmates.
   The riot at Leopoldov Prison began Wednesday afternoon when
hundreds of inmates refused to be moved to other prisons. They were
apparently being moved because of poor conditions at the facility,
which repeatedly had caused unrest.
   Slovak premier Milan Cic told the official CTK news agency that
``hand-to-hand fighting'' was required to clear the prison.
   He said the facility was virtually destroyed by the fires the
rioting inmates set to block about 2,000 soldiers, police officers
and guards who tried to stop the riot and remove the prisoners.
   One inmate at the prison 250 miles east of Prague was found dead
in a ruined building after the inmates were evacuated, Cic was
quoted as saying. Doctors said the prisoner died about four hours
before troops stormed the prison buildings, and he was thought to
have fallen to his death from a roof.
   Twenty-nine prisoners and one prison guard were injured in the
fighting, CTK said, without giving details of the wounds.
   The news agency said authorities fired their guns, but only when
absolutely necessary. The report said all 1,200 inmates were
eventually moved to the Kurin jail in Bohemia or to prisons in
Slovakia. Although Leopoldov housed hardened criminals and
murderers, it also contained some political prisoners.
   Most of the prisoners in Leopoldov were not affected by the
presidential amnesty that released more than 20,000 lesser
offenders at the New Year, just after former political prisoner
Vaclav Havel took office as president.
   Riots were reported at Leopoldov in January, and the inmates had
staged sporadic strikes for improved conditions ever since.
   Since March 1, inmates had occupied their cells and some refused
food to press demands for abolition of provisions that allowed
authorities to lengthen the sentences of hardened criminals.
   Bratislava radio reported on Saturday that efforts by
authorities to reduce the sentences of some inmates and negotiate
with others had been hampered by what it termed the ``excessive
radicalism'' of some.

<HEAD>North Dakota Officials Seek $45 Million For Garrison</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   North Dakota officials asked Congress on
Thursday to ignore President Bush's opposition and finish the
Garrison Diversion water project ``or give us the dam back.''
   State officials asked House and Senate Appropriations
subcommittees to provide $45 million for 1991 construction, $15
million more than it got this year.
   The $1 billion project's future is under a cloud because Bush
has proposed cancellation and a recent report by the Interior
Department's inspector general said it probably isn't financial
feasible.
   ``The whole thing is very frustrating,'' North Dakota Gov.
George Sinner told the House panel. ``People teeter on absolute
outrage at what is taking place.''
   Sinner departed from his prepared remarks to attack the
inspector general's report, which he called ``badly flawed''
because it doesn't take into consideration the economic and
environmental benefit the project will provide the state.
   The inspector general said the farmers who would get irrigation
water from the project will have to pay a larger share of the
construction cost than they can afford.
   The Interior Department must develop an acceptable plan for
allocating the construction costs before the government can sign a
repayment contract with the conservancy district. Without the
contract, no additional money can be spent on building irrigation
facilities.
   ``We are owed this project,'' said Rep. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D.
``Give us this project or give us the dam back.''
   Charles Richter, chairman of the Garrison Diversion Conservancy
District, said: ``We ask the Congress to not add to the litany of
broken promises and committments to the state of North Dakota.''
   ``We agree with you that the government ought to keep this
commitment and I hope we will be able to work with you on this,''
said the panel's chairman, Rep. Tom Bevill, D-Ala.
   Although the administration's official position is that the
project is uneconomical, Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan agreed
Wednesday to form a working group representing the congressional
delegation and the administration to discuss ways to continue
construction.

   President Bush declared his administration
``on a wartime footing'' against AIDS Thursday and called for
compassion, not discrimination, toward people infected with the
virus.
   ``Our goal is to turn irrational fear into rational acts,'' he
said in his first major presidential address on AIDS. For Bush, it
was an unusually personal speech.
   Addressing the National Leadership Coalition on AIDS, he said
that education is the key to curbing the spread of the deadly
disease.
   ``Every American must learn what AIDS is and what AIDS is not,''
he said.
   Bush presented no new policy initiatives, instead spotlighting
as unprecedented his proposed $3.5 billion in federal spending on
AIDS research, treatment and education.
   AIDS activists dismiss the proposal _ although it would
drastically escalate the federal commitment to the fight against
AIDS _ as a small fraction of what is needed to find a cure and to
treat victims.
   Bush vowed to press further research at the National Institutes
of Health in Bethesda, Md., and the Centers for Disease Control in
Atlanta.
   ``We're on a wartime footing at NIH and CDC. Tonight, like every
night, the lights will burn late in Bethesda and Atlanta, as a
group of American pioneers work to solve this problem.''
   Bush urged business executives in his audience not to fire
employees infected with HIV, the human immunodeficiency virus that
causes AIDS. These people, he said, deserve the same compassion as
others who are sick.
   ``There is only one way to deal with an individual who is sick _
with dignity, compassion, care, confidentiality and without
discrimination,'' he said.
   ``Once disease strikes, we don't blame those who are suffering.
We don't spurn the accident victim who didn't wear a seat belt. We
don't reject the cancer patient who didn't quit smoking. We try to
love them and care for them and comfort them. We do not fire them
or evict them or cancel their insurance.''
   Bush urged Congress ``to get on with the job of passing a law''
to prohibit discrimination against people infected with AIDS or HIV.
   ``We're in a fight against a disease, not a fight against
people,'' he said.
   The president said he and his wife, Barbara, have lost friends
to the disease.
   ``Our love for them when they were sick and when they died was
just as great and just as intense as for anyone lost to heart
disease or cancer or accidents,'' the president said.
   He expressed empathy with families of AIDS-infected babies,
recalling the death of his own 4-year-old daughter from leukemia.
``We asked the doctor the same question every HIV family must ask _
why, why this was happening to our beautiful little girl,'' he said.
   Two AIDS activists in the audience tried repeatedly to interrupt
Bush. They eventually were escorted out by security personnel.
   ``Why did it take you 14 months to say this?'' one man shouted.
   When Bush said federal support for the AIDS fight had risen from
$8 million to almost $3.5 billion, the heckler snapped, ``Too
little, too late.''
   Urvashi Vaid, executive director of the National Gay and Lesbian
Task Force, waved a sign reading, ``Talk is cheap. AIDS funding is
not.'' She later said Bush had had some good comments, but should
have talked about immigration restrictions on AIDS sufferers.
   Bush did not mention the controversy, which involves a 1987
congressional directive that HIV infection be added to the list of
contagious diseases used to prevent foreigners from entering the
United States.
   Bush departed from his text to tell the hecklers, ``I can
understand the concern that these people feel, and I hope that if
we do nothing else by coming here, I can help them understand that
not only do you care, but we care too.''
   The president spoke to the audience of 500 business and health
executives and AIDS activists in a ballroom where the walls were
covered with several of the colorful quilts that memorialize the
nation's 70,000 AIDS dead.
   Bush, who was out of town when the full AIDS quilt was displayed
on the Mall recently, called it an amazing sight.
   One quilt showed balloons, each bearing a name. Another bore the
names and badge numbers of two San Francisco policemen and six
sheriff's deputies.

<HEAD>General Who Oversaw Death Camp Arrested</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Authorities on Thursday arrested a
retired deputy interior minister who ran a camp in northern
Bulgaria in which hundreds of prisoners may have been killed during
Todor Zhivkov's regime.
   The arrest of 80-year-old Gen. Mincho Spassov followed a series
of reports about the camp that have stirred memories of Stalinist
repression.
   The arrest, tersely reported by the state news agency, came a
day after Spassov told the Communist Party daily Rabotnichesko Delo
that he visited the camp in Lovech only once.
   The military prosecutor's office said it was holding Spassov in
connection with events at Lovech and another camp near Sofia, and
on charges of aiding and abetting embezzlement when he was head of
the Communist Party office overseeing foreign travel.
   The Communist Party daily meanwhile quoted a former guard at the
Lovech camp, Tsvyatko Goranov, as saying Spassov visted Lovech once
or twice a week during the period from 1959 to 1962.
   ``He would always tell us, `Work them to death,''' recalled the
guard. He said windows have been smashed at his home and graffiti
reading ``Living Butcher'' daubed on his walls since the
disclosures about Lovech began to emerge 11 days ago.
   The reports in state-run and independent media are part of a
general probe of the past since Zhivkov, Bulgaria's Stalinist
leader for 35 years, was ousted in November.
   Tales of how Zhivkov and his fellow Communists jailed and
sometimes murdered political opponents have come into the open.
   But none of the reports has been so shocking to Bulgarians as
those about Lovech, where hundreds of prisoners were reported
clubbed to death, tied in sacks and even fed to pigs at a nearby
camp.
   The disclosures could add to eventual charges against Zhivkov,
who is being held pending an investigation of his actions.
   Spassov told Rabotnichesko Delo that Zhivkov must have known
about the torture. ``Everybody knew,'' he said.
   But until March 18, when a popular Sunday news program broke the
story of Lovech, most Bulgarians did not know. The torture and
murder at Lovech had been chronicled only in a secret 1962 report
for the top echelons of the Communist Party.
   President Petar Mladenov and other top Communists have now
called for investigations by the prosecutor-general into the doings
at Lovech and other camps and prisons, which were run by the
Interior Ministry.
   Meanwhile, Rabotnichesko Delo, the independent daily
Demokratsiya and TV have brought new reports each day.
   An ex-convict, Bozhidar Petrov, telling of his ``14 months in
hell'' in Lovech from Jan. 1961 to March 1962, charged in one
newspaper interview that about 1,000 prisoners died in the camp.
   Another former prisoner, Valter Vasilev, put the death toll at
300 in his account of Lovech in Rabotnichesko Delo. A Capt. Gazdov,
said to have been one of the three security officers running the
camp, says about 150 people died.
   Petrov said prisoners faced daily torture if they did not meet
the near-impossible work quotas set at the camp. Wounds from daily
beatings were left untreated and festered so badly that worms
crawled in them, he claimed.
   At least two prisoners were driven to suicide by the cruelty,
Petrov told Demokratsiya.
   The accounts about Lovech mark another stage in Bulgaria's
gradual break with its Stalinist past.
   After the Hungarian uprising in 1956, Bulgaria's worried
Communist leadership began rounding up political prisoners. Petrov
said one camp inmate who died at Lovech while he was there was a
Sofia violin player imprisoned for telling a joke.
   Torture and murder at Lovech, and possibly at other camps,
appear to have peaked in the late 1950s and early 1960s. The
cultural ``thaw'' and de-Stalinization in the Soviet Union under
Nikita S. Khrushchev at that time apparently prompted Zhivkov to
close the camps.

<TEXT>
   Former powerboat racer Benjamin
``Barry'' Kramer, already imprisoned on drug charges and awaiting
sentencing in a helicopter escape attempt, has been convicted for
his role in a drug ring.
   Kramer, 35, was accused by prosecutors of masterminding a
cocaine-smuggling operation that stretched from Colombia and Los
Angeles to London and Liechtenstein.
   A federal jury on Wednesday found Kramer, 35, guilty on 30
counts, including racketeering, conspiracy, drug trafficking and
tax fraud. No sentencing date has been set.
   His father, Jack Kramer, and Miami attorney Melvyn Kessler were
convicted of racketeering and conspiracy.
   The former powerboat racer also faces sentencing April 13 in
federal court in Miami on charges of trying to use a helicopter to
escape from the Metropolitan Correctional Center southwest of Miami
last year.
   The escape failed when the helicopter's tail rotor snagged a
prison fence and the machine crashed, breaking Kramer's leg and
injuring the pilot, Charlie Clayton Stevens. Stevens was sentenced
to 2{ years in prison.
   The latest trial lasted three months, and the jury deliberated
for six days. Kramer, already serving a life term for drug charges
in Illinois, nervously stroked his beard when the verdicts were
read.
   ``Obviously, we are disappointed,'' said his attorney, Kate
Bonner.
   Prosecutors alleged that Kramer's group began smuggling small
quantities of marijuana into south Florida in the early 1980s. His
enterprises, they said, eventually was conducted on three
continents.

   Sammy Davis Jr. remains under

fine, his publicist said.
   However, the 64-year-old entertainer will not attend a ceremony
on Sunday saluting his 60 years as a song-and-dance man,
spokeswoman Susan Reynolds said Wednesday. Davis was to be honored
with the Professional Society Gypsy Award.
   ``I'm sure if he were able to be there, he would,'' said
Reynolds.
   Davis was recently hospitalized at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center
for a recurrence of throat cancer, which was diagnosed in September
1989.
   A versatile singer-dancer whose career has stretched from
vaudeville to the Las Vegas stage to Hollywood, Davis most recently
appeared in the 1989 movie ``Tap,'' playing an old-time tap dancer.

<HEAD>Panel Votes to Continue Peanut Program as Compromise Talks Fail</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A House subcommittee voted Thursday to
continue the peanut price support program virtually intact for
another five years after talks among industry groups seeking
changes broke down.
   The bill would allow the $631 per ton support price for
domestic-use peanuts to increase up to 6 percent a year as the cost
of production increases.
   The Bush administration had proposed a 20 percent reduction in
the support price and the elimination of the annual price escalator.
   However, debate in the agriculture subcommittee on tobacco and
peanuts focused on negotiations that have been going on for months
between peanut growers and manufacturers.
   Rep. Charles Hatcher, D-Ga., who initiated the talks, said the
effort to reach a compromise failed when growers outside of Georgia
refused to accept demands from manufacturers in three major areas.
   The manufacturers, he said, wanted the support price adjusted
every two years instead of annually, although they agreed to a
biennial increase of up to 12 percent.
   They also insisted on changes dealing with peanut quality and
regulatory complexity, Hatcher said, and they demanded creation of
a committee of representatives from all segments of the industry to
advise the secretary of agriculture on peanut regulations.
   Hatcher said Georgia growers, who produce 45 percent of the
nation's peanuts, were willing to accept the manufacturers' demands
in exchange for their support to continue the supply management
program with a $631 per ton support price and a price escalation
clause.
   But other grower groups would not agree, he said, and unless a
compromise can be reached in the next few weeks, peanut growers
face a potential repeat of the 1981 and 1985 farm bill debates,
when manufactuers tried to kill the peanut program on the House
floor.
   Peanuts and tobacco are the only commodities in which the
government price support program is based on a supply management
concept.
   The secretary of agriculture each year determines the volume of
peanuts needed to meet domestic demand, then divides that quota
among farmers who produced peanuts for domestic use in previous
years.
   Farmers with government quotas are guaranteed the $631 per ton
support price, while other peanut farmers, who produce for the
export market, are guaranteed about $150 a ton for their peanuts.

   Two of the three Northwest Airlines crew
members accused of flying while intoxicated appeared in court today
and were released after agreeing not to fly any aircraft.
   First Officer Robert Kirchner of Highland Ranch, Colo., and
Second Officer Joseph Balzer of Antioch, Tenn., appeared before
Magistrate J. Earl Cudd.
   Capt. Norman Prouse of Conyers, Ga., the third pilot charged
after the March 8 flight from Fargo, N.D., to Minneapolis, was not
in court. He was represented by an attorney who did not explain his
client's absence.
   Cudd released Kirchner and Balzer after they promised to meet
certain conditions, including a prohibition on flying any aircraft.
   The pilots have been fired by Northwest and the Federal Aviation
Administration has revoked their pilot licenses.
   Each of the crew members is charged with flying under the
influence of alcohol, a federal offense. They were also charged by
North Dakota officials.
   Tests conducted shortly after the pilots' arrest showed the crew
members had blood-alcohol levels ranging from 0.06 percent to 0.12
percent. Federal regulations prohibit pilots from flying if they
have higher than a 0.04 percent level. The legal limit for driving
a vehicle is 0.10 in most states.
   The maximum penalty is 15 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
   Prouse, Balzer and Kirchner piloted Flight 650 from Fargo to
Minneapolis with 91 passengers and were detained upon landing
safely. Federal authorities had been tipped off that the crew had
been drinking the night before the early morning flight.

   Actor Ruben Blades was in the middle of a
live television interview Thursday on the movie set of ``Predator
II'' when the film director abruptly intervened and told Blades it
was time to shoot.
   ``Good Morning America'' host Joan Lunden had just begun
interviewing Blades about the violent, action picture, which also
stars his friend Danny Glover, when director Steven Hopkins
suddenly appeared.
   Hopkins told an embarrassed Blades it was time to begin shooting
his scene, then he stood in front of the ABC-TV camera and yanked
the earplug from Blades' ear and ordered him back on the set.
   ``As you can see,'' a startled Lunden told viewers, ``the
director of the film carries a lot of weight.''
   Viewers could hear Blades say ``sorry'' as the microphone was
removed from his chest.
   ``Well, it is a movie about violence,'' said Lunden, who filled
in the remaining time with anecdotes about the hazards of live
television interviews.
   ``I think people are very understanding of the uncertainties of
live television,'' said co-host Charles Gibson.

   A TV executive at odds with Roseanne Barr
announced his departure from her top-rated comedy show by taking
out a full-page ad in the entertainment trade paper Daily Variety.
   Executive producer Jeff Harris addressed the ad Tuesday to the
cast and crew, saying: ``I have chosen not to return to the show
next season. Instead, my wife and I have decided to share a
vacation in the relative peace and quiet of Beirut.''
   Neither Harris nor ``Roseanne'' production company Carsey-Werner
would comment on the ad. Harris, who was on loan to The
Carsey-Werner Co. from Viacom Productions, was expected to return
there.
   Harris and Barr reportedly have tangled since January over
disputes including Harris' alleged efforts to have Barr's husband,
Tom Arnold, removed from the writing staff.
   ``Roseanne'' creator Matt Williams left the show in January 1989
over ``creative differences'' with the outspoken star.

   New Kids on the Block, the pop group known for
its squeaky clean image and anti-drug stand, has gotten some
students in trouble with the Gilead Christian Academy.
   Officials of the independent Baptist school found out that some
of their students attended a March 4 concert by the group,
violating a school policy that makes attendance at rock concerts _
along with smoking, drugs and alcohol _grounds for expulsion.
   Keith Scott, Gilead dean of students, said the students won't be
asked to withdraw. But he sent a letter to parents reminding them
of school policies on the admissions applications they signed. He
added that rock music ``is in direct opposition to the word of God.
This stand we take without apology.''
   Some parents complained that it was their right to decide what
concerts their children attended. ``And we have the choice to admit
the student or not,'' Scott said.
   The school has 400 students in kindergarten through the 12th
grade.

   Mayor John Norquist enlisted the ADA Gremlins,
a rap group from Milwaukee, to urge city residents to answer the
U.S. Census.
   A ``posse'' of about 90 fourth- and fifth-graders performed
backup for the song ``In for the Count'' and wore T-shirts with
that slogan at a downtown mall Wednesday.
   The ADA Gremlins, whose name stands for Anti-Drug Alliance,
wrote the rap after doing some research on the census, group leader
Randy Dulaney said. He said the group, whose members range in age
from 13 to 26, have written raps for other community projects.
   The 1990 Complete Count Project, a Milwaukee effort to increase
minority participation in the census, could help keep Wisconsin
from losing a congressional seat in the redistricting that will
follow the census, Norquist said.
   City, county and state government officals provided a chorus for
ADA Gremlins, but Norquist, who frequently sings at the city's
summer festivals, left the rapping to the youngsters.

   Julie A. Smit is trying to save face by putting a
new wrinkle into efforts to prevent wrinkles.
   With a little help from her mother, Smit invented the Face Saver
Pillow, which she believes can forestall wrinkles caused by a
pillow's surface pressing into delicate facial tissue.
   The pillow has a concave cutout portion so there's nothing to
rub against the nose and eye area, which Smit says is particularly
sensitive.
   ``It makes sense, especially if you squish your face into the
pillow at night,'' said Smit, 34. ``People sleep eight to 12 hours.
They get up and look in the mirror and see wrinkles.''
   ``I sleep on my side and my face presses into the pillow,'' she
said. ``I noticed wrinkles on that side.''
   Dr. Paul Lazar, a dermatologist, said the pillow probably has no
medical value, although it would take an elaborate medical study to
prove it.
   ``I can tell you this, I wouldn't buy it,'' Lazar said.
   Smit and her mother, Helen, also have teamed up on other
inventions, including a stuffed animal that doubles as a hot water
bottle and hats made of the kind of mesh used in window screens.

   ``Buckshot the Mullet'' has replaced
``Rocky'' as the symbol of the Boggy Bayou Mullet Festival after a
dispute over copyright control of the old logo.
   Wayne Goodson had sought royalties for commercial use of his
cartoon fish mascot. He said he feared that the mascot's clean-cut
image might be diluted by things like putting beer mugs in Rocky's
fins, which are covered with boxing gloves and raised as in
Sylvester Stallone's movie ``Rocky.''
   The festival's committee wanted anyone to be able to use the
logo without restriction for maximum exposure. Rather than fight
Goodson, the committee decided to switch, selecting Buckshot from
about 50 entries Tuesday.
   Buchshot is the creation of Jack Thompson, 64, a retired Air
Force and Navy man from nearby Seminole, who also created emblems
for several military outfits. Instead of boxing gloves, the new
mascot holds a fiddle and wears bib overalls and a straw hat.
   ``It kind of `went country' because we have a small town,''
Thompson said.
   Actually, two small towns. The festival is celebrated in
Niceville and neighboring Valparaiso.
   Rejected entries included a mermaid, dog, pelican, pink
flamingo, a mullet wearing a camouflage hat and hunting vest, and a
cat carrying a mullet in its mouth. Mullets named Mikie, Millie and
Molly also were rejected.

   American Christian missionary William
Robinson was buried Thursday, two days after masked gunmen burst
into his home and killed him while he sang hymns with his family
and orphans under his care.
   His American widow, Barbara, four sons and 29 handicapped
Lebanese from his orphanage in the neighboring village of Rashaya
Foukhar attended the funeral at a Protestant church In Hasbaya. The
town is in Israel's self-declared security zone in south Lebanon.
   Several officers of the Israeli army and the South Lebanon Army,
a mainly Christian militia that polices the security zone, also
attended the service.
   Robinson, 59, who was born and raised in Athol, Mass., was shot
by men who broke into his house in Rashaya Foukhar on Tuesday night.
   The masked men also took $4,000 and some jewelry before fleeing.
They also killed his guard dogs.
   In Beirut, the Communist Party and the pro-Syrian Lebanese
National Resistance Front claimed responsibility for the killing.
They accused the victim of planning to establish an Israeli
settlement in south Lebanon.
   Robinson's family and the Israeli government denied this.
   William F. Wolford, administrator of the International Christian
Embassy in Jerusalem, said Robinson was a former U.S. Marine who
``had a love for the children of Lebanon and went there to help.''
   Israel established the 6- to 10-mile security zone to prevent
terrorist raids in 1985, when it withdrew the bulk of its army from
Lebanon after it had invaded three years earlier.
   Robinson, his wife and three orthopedic technicians from
Britain, Sweden and Spain ran the 7-year-old orphanage and the
school for handicapped children.
   Sources close to Robinson, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the slain missionary's will asked his wife to continue running
the project.
   Robinson had stayed in south Lebanon against the advice of
officials of the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv.
   Security sources, who requested anonymity, said Israeli troops
and allied militiamen rounded up at least 12 people in day-long
house raids in Rashaya Foukhar and the neighboring villages of
Cchebaa and Kfar Hammam after Robinson's murder.
   But a Communist Party communique said all three gunmen who
carried out the assassination had returned to their base outside
the security zone.

   Paramilitary police killed 16 people
Thursday in a series of shootings after a policeman was fatally
wounded in a grenade attack by Moslem militants, witnesses said.
   The shootings in the northern city of Srinagar, the center of a
Moslem separatist campaign, came one day after Indian border guards
shot and killed two Pakistani civilians.
   The civilians were in group of 100 people who tried to cross to
the Indian side of the frontier while shouting anti-India slogans.
Pakistan expressed outrage Thursday at the two killings.
   A senior Kashmir police official said the paramilitary Central
Reserve Police Force killed 15 people in six incidents Thursday.
The dead included nine passengers of two city buses that were
stopped for security checks, the police official and witnesses said.
   But witnesses, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said police
opened fire at civilians and killed 16 after Moslem militants
hurled a grenade at a jeep. They said the grenade killed a
paramilitary policeman.
   It was imposible to verify the report due to curfew restrictions
in the area.
   At least 217 people have been killed in fighting in Kashmir
since Jan. 20, when the government launched a crackdown on Moslem
secessionists.
   The militants want to create an independent nation in
Jammu-Kashmir, the only state with a Moslem majority in
predominantly Hindu India.
   The secession movement has flared since 1947, when the old
princely state of Kashmir, then governed by a Hindu ruler, merged
with India. India and Pakistan have fought two wars over Kashmir
since then.

   A judge has ruled that Jesus Christ was
innocent of the charges that sent him to his death at the hands of
Roman authorities in Galilee two millennia ago, a newspaper in this
southern city reported Thursday.
   Judge Eduardo Rodriguez told the Ideal newspaper the idea to
symbolically overturn Christ's conviction on charges of political
rebellion came to him while he was preparing a prayer for
traditional Passion Week ceremonies.
   ``I consider myself almost a blasphemer because I'm nobody to
judge Christ,'' the daily quoted him as saying. ``But my intention
was to give Jesus of Nazareth a just sentence and teach a lesson to
those who judged him.''
   Jesus of Nazareth was crucified under Roman law around the year
30 after being condemned as a political rebel.
   ``If that trial had been held with all the due guarantees, he
would have been absolved, among other reasons, because nobody was
defending him _ he only had accusers,'' Rodriguez said.
   He used Biblical texts to prepare the case and concluded his
ruling by asking Jesus for forgiveness.

   The Centers for Disease Control said today its
long-awaited study of Agent Orange shows Vietnam veterans at
increased risk of only one type of cancer _ and ``no evidence''
that the risk stems from exposure to the dangerous herbicide used
in the war.
   The study, which had been criticized by veterans groups even
before it was released, focused on Vietnam veterans and cancer, and
``only indirectly evaluated Agent Orange exposure,'' the CDC said.
   But it added that the cancer risk among the vets in the study
``seemed to be the opposite of the pattern for use of Agent
Orange.'' Veterans who served on Navy ships were somewhat more
likely to get cancer than those who served on land, and veterans
who served in the region of heaviest Agent Orange use were at
``somewhat lower risk'' than others, the CDC said.
   Agent Orange, sprayed by the U.S. military to remove jungle and
crops in Vietnam, contained dioxin, a highly toxic chemical that
some studies have found to increase the risk of cancer.
   The CDC study, conducted over five years, surveyed male cancer
patients who were the right age to have served in Vietnam, whether
they did serve or not. They were compared with a group of similar
males with no history of cancer.
   The patients' medical records were examined for six kinds of
cancer, including soft tissue cancer and similar sarcomas, a group
of cancers which the CDC concedes has been ``of great concern among
Vietnam veterans.''
   Vietnam vets were found to be at a roughly 50 percent increased
risk for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a ``relatively rare'' cancer of
the lymphatic system, the CDC said.
   ``The study did not find any evidence that the increased risk
might be due to Agent Orange exposure,'' said CDC Director William
L. Roper.
   There was ``no evidence,'' the CDC reported, ``that
non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was more likely to develop in one group of
Vietnam veterans than in another.''
   Specifically, the yearly risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is about
one in 10,000 for men 35 to 59, the age group of most Vietnam vets.
The risk for Vietnam vets is about 1.5 per 10,000, Roper said.
   But the CDC found ``no increased risk'' for sarcomas, usually
cancers of the body's connective tissues, or for other cancer types.
   The Veterans Administration has been awaiting the study before
making its decision on whether to award benefits to veterans
exposed to Agent Orange. Nearly 35,000 claims have been filed
citing the chemical as a cause of disabilities, including cancer,
skin disease and miscarriages by veterans' wives.
   Veterans Secretary Edward J. Derwinski said today that based on
the study he would order compensation paid to veterans suffering
from non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
   Derwinski, in announcing the move in Washington, mentioned only
the link between Vietnam service and the lymphoma. He did not say
the connection was because of Agent Orange.
   His announcement speeds up VA action on the findings; the agency
had said it would submit the study to a review panel.
   American Legion officials told their Vietnam veteran members in
advance of today's announcement that they should not be too
optimistic about this study, which was mandated by Congress.
   ``The government has ducked the issue of Agent Orange for more
than a dozen years,'' said the legion's national commander, Miles
S. Epling. ``We are tired of waiting for more studies, especially
irrelevant ones.''
   The legion has accused CDC of ignoring military records that
could have produced a more detailed study.
   The CDC study found that the risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma was
nearly double _ 90 percent higher _ for Navy veterans stationed on
ocean ships than for non-veterans. That was the only statistically
significant risk for any branch of service, said Dr. Daniel A.
Hoffman, assistant director for science at the CDC's Center for
Environmental Health.
   For all veterans, the 50 percent higher risk of that type of
cancer is what epidemiologists call ``a weak association,'' Hoffman
said. While statistically significant, ``anything less than a
twofold increase can sometimes be caused by other factors,'' he
said.
   The CDC study did not suggest reasons for the increased risk for
one cancer over another, or for the increased risk among Navy
sailors at sea.
   The study did not include blood tests to determine the actual
amount of dioxin that might remain in the cancer patients'
bloodstream two decades or more after military service.
   Hoffman said such tests were not a practical way to determine
dioxin exposure because it is possible that test findings might be
tainted by the patients' illness itself.

<TEXT>
   In a hushed voice, a boy told a judge how
he molested two preschoolers, one while baby-sitting in her home
and the other in a church nursery, and then threatened to kill the
children if they told anyone.
   David Hawkey pleaded guilty Wednesday to two counts of
first-degree criminal sexual conduct. His 14th birthday was
Thursday.
   Muskegon County Prosecutor Tony Tague said the boy has told
police he raped, molested and fondled at least 55 children between
the ages of 18 months and 4 years while he worked as a volunteer at
Fruitport Bethel Baptist Church from 1985 to 1988.
   But Tague said he would not pursue further charges against the
boy, partly because of the ages of the children involved and the
time elapsed since the molestations.
   Juvenile Court Judge Neil Mullally ordered the boy returned to a
residential sex offender treatment program and postponed sentencing
for 90 days, pending a progress report. The boy faces a maximum
penalty of detention in a youth home until his 19th birthday.
   David spoke quickly and quietly when Mullally asked him to
describe how he molested a 4-year-old boy in the closet of the
church nursery sometime between January and June 1988 and the
3-year-old girl in her Ottawa County home in November 1988.
   ``I said if she told what I just did to her, I'd kill her,'' the
youth said in court, adding that he made a similar threat to the
4-year-old.
   David's 17-year-old brother, Paul, also has been charged with
first-degree criminal sexual conduct. He is accused in juvenile
court of molesting a 4-year-old boy between January and March 1988
at the church, where he also volunteered. Tague said additional
charges against the brother are possible before his June trial.
   Paul Hawkey, who remains free and lives with his father in
Nunica, has denied the charge.
   The boys' mother, Connie Kersting, filed for divorce from Dennis
Hawkey in 1988.
   Mullally ordered the entire Hawkey family to undergo counseling.
   The Rev. Clay Nuttall, who was pastor of the church at the time
of the molestations, has said the father often brought home
hard-core pornography to which the children were exposed.
   The parents, who were in the courtroom Wednesday, have declined
to comment on their children's cases.
   David's attorney, Gerald Gibbs, said his client pleaded guilty
because he wanted to put the case behind him.
   ``He pleaded guilty because he is guilty, because he doesn't
want a trial, because he doesn't want his victims to have to appear
at trial ... and because he is already in treatment,'' Gibbs said.
   David has been undergoing court-ordered treatment at Bethany
Christian Services in Grand Rapids since last summer after pleading
guilty to second-degree criminal sexual conduct for molesting a
young boy in his care at the church in March 1988.
   As part of his treatment, he was urged to identify any other
victims. As his treatment progressed, he admitted to molesting
dozens of other children at the church. He also implicated his
brother, authorities said.
   The confessions, given to authorities so the other children
could get treatment, were made public last month in The Muskegon
Chronicle. Soon after, Tague issued warrants for the additional
counts.
   Tague, whose department has been investigating the allegations
of widespread abuse for six months, said David has been cooperating
with police.

   Personally, Donald Trump says, his impending
divorce is awful. Businesswise, he acknowledges, it's not so bad.
   ``Getting a divorce is a very horrible thing on a personal
basis. I hate it,'' Trump said in an interview to be broadcast
Monday on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America.''
   ``I hate the concept of divorce. It's not nice,'' continued
Trump, who is separated from his wife, Ivana. ``It is not something
I relish at all.''
   But while it may be a personal problem, divorce can be good for
business, Trump conceded. More than 2,000 media people are expected
at the April 2 opening of his Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City,
N.J.
   ``It brings people maybe for the wrong reasons. I don't like
bringing people for that reason. But nevertheless, the controversy
probably is not a negative thing in terms of a building or a
business,'' said Trump.

   Six major record companies plan to create an
album labeling system so retailers and purchasers can identify
explicit recordings.
   The label _ reading ``Parental advisory, explicit lyrics'' _
does not mean that the music industry is buckling to pressure
groups complaining about sexual and violent songs, officials said
at a recent convention here of the National Association of
Recording Industry Merchandisers.
   ``This will absolutely remain a voluntary decision to be
determined solely by the label,'' said Trish Heimers, vice
president of the Recording Industry Association of America.
   More than a dozen states are considering record censorship
bills, said executives at the NARIM meeting.
   The labeling decision may not solve the controversy, some
retailers said, adding they were fearful that legislation won't be
derailed.
   ``This legislation will put an impossible burden on us, and the
record manufacturers have ducked the problem,'' said Stanley Gold
of Shamrock Holdings, which owns Music Plus stores. ``This should
be an easy area of cooperation but I see little progress being
made.''
   The companies planning to create the labeling system are Warner
Bros., MCA, CBS, Capitol-EMI, RCA and Polygram.

   A production crew and theater
students were all set to begin taping a heavy-metal video for the

   ``We have parental concern for all the students involved, but

   He abruptly dismissed the team and some 30 students, expressing

   In a recent review in The Washington Post, Whitesnake was

   A brain tumor cut short the life of
11-year-old Clinton Hill, who dreamed of establishing a worldwide
club called Kids for Saving Earth. But a $1 million contribution is
making Clinton's dream a reality.
   The suburban Plymouth boy laid the groundwork for the club
before he died in November.
   ``He was worried about the air we breathe and the water we
drink,'' said Tessa Hill, Clinton's mother. ``He knew that kids can
make a difference.''
   Mrs. Hill enlisted Target Stores in her son's crusade after
noticing a flier that described the company's environmental
protection efforts. She asked Target executive George Hite to speak
to Clinton's class, and Hite was so moved that he lobbied for the
company to take on the project.
   ``It reminded me of how powerful kids can be,'' said Hite, vice
president of public and consumer affairs. ``They have a sense of
honesty, simplicity and a very strong commitment.''
   Target, a discount chain with 407 stores in 32 states, plans to
insert brochures explaining Clinton's idea in 35 million Sunday
newspaper advertising supplements on Earth Day, April 22. It also
will provide kits for schools telling children how to start
chapters of the club.
   The company will broadcast 30-second commercials nationally
during Earth Week promoting the club, and will give away millions
of posters and educational materials listing ways for children to
help protect the environment.
   During Earth Week, banners featuring the club's pledge will be
displayed at Target stores for children and adults to sign. The
banners then will be submitted to the United Nations General
Assembly.
   The pledge reads: ``The Earth is my home. I promise to keep it
healthy and beautiful. I will love the land, the air, the water and
all living creatures. I will be a defender of my planet. United
with friends, I will save the Earth.''
   ``We think it's very important to have a good society for our
own children,'' said 11-year-old Katrina Lusty, one of Clinton's
classmates from Sunny Hollow Elementary School in New Hope. ``We
think it's going to make a difference.''
   Classmate Tim Svensson, 11, said the members of Kids for Saving
Earth are taking steps in their own homes and communities to
protect the environment, such as urging their families to recycle.
   ``Kids can influence their parents,'' Tim said. ``The
politicians haven't done much so far as I can see.
   ``I love McDonald's, but they use a lot of Styrofoam,'' he said,
using a brand name popularly used for the polystyrene that keeps
hamburgers warm. ``When we go to McDonald's, we say, `No Styrofoam,
please.'''
   While more than a dozen cities have enacted bans on some plastic
products to keep them from choking landfills, McDonald's Corp. has
pushed for other approaches. It has a pilot program in which New
England customers are asked to separate plastic trash for
recycling, and representatives of the company are working on
proposals for a tax on use of unrecycled materials.
   David Rosene, Clinton's sixth-grade teacher, said kids are aware
that their future depends on that of the Earth.
   ``I think the students realize that this is an issue that
affects them personally,'' he said.
   ``These kids will be the graduating collegiates in the year
2000,'' Rosene said. ``They'll be ready to exert their influence on
the world.''
   Hite said Target's support for the project will continue as long
as there is interest in the club. Target, a division of
Minneapolis-based Dayton Hudson Corp., will provide money from its
charitable contribution fund each year, he said.
   Hite said Kids for Saving Earth provided an opportunity to reach
the generation that will have to clean up the mess left behind by
today's adults.
   ``It will be the centerpiece of our environmental work,'' he
said.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet army offered amnesty
Thursday to Lithuanian deserters who return to their units in what
appeared to be a first step toward compromise in the crisis over
Lithuania's independence drive.
   The decision announced by the Defense Ministry General Staff
came a day after Lithuania offered two compromises: it suspended a
plan to institute its own border guard, and it told citizens not to
resist Soviet attempts to seize their firearms.
   Both sides seemed to be yielding in the war of wills over
Lithuania's March 11 declaration of independence, the strongest
defiance of Mikhail S. Gorbachev in his five years as Soviet leader.
   ``I think Lithuania is seeking a way out, and I think Gorbachev
is seeking a way out,'' said Algirdas Brazauskas, head of the
Lithuanian Communist Party, which split with Moscow in December.
   But the war of words did not die down entirely.
   Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis, asked about the
Defense Ministry's offer, said: ``I don't have much trust in this
promise. There have been instances where very high military
officials have lied.''
   Lithuanian leaders are angry that the military said nothing
before arresting 23 deserters Tuesday. They said the military had
agreed to discuss any such move in advance.
   Defense Ministry officials told Tass that Lithuanians who left
the Soviet armed forces when their republic declared independence
would not be punished if they resumed their military service.
   However, those who continue to hide will be ``searched out,
detained and be subject to criminal punishment in accordance with
current law,'' they said.
   Red Army soldiers on Tuesday stormed two psychiatric hospitals
in Lithuania to apprehend deserters. Witnesses said some of the
deserters and a policeman who tried to stop the detentions were
beaten.
   The Lithuanian prosecutor's office said Thursday it had opened a
criminal investigation into the beating of the police officer. The
republic's Interior Ministry said the policeman sustained a
concussion.
   Lt. Gen. Frants Markovsky of the military General Staff told
Tass a special military commission had been set up to track down
deserters.
   Soviet officers visited the families of 97 soldiers who
deserted, and in 40 cases were told the soldiers would return,
Markovsky told Tass. In 42 other cases, parents said they were
willing to help the military but did not know where their sons
were, Markovsky said.
   ``No reasoning and appeals for common sense and for parental
wisdom, however, worked with the parents of the other 15
deserters,'' he said.
   Markovsky said 51 soldiers already had returned to their units.
   Soviet officials estimate 250 Lithuanian soldiers have deserted.
Lithuanian figures put the number at about 900.
   Wednesday was the deadline for Lithuanians to comply with
Gorbachev's order issued last week to turn in their firearms or
have them seized.
   Deputy Interior Minister Vaclavas Zabarauskas said Thursday that
only 1,500 of the 30,000 registered guns had been turned in. Local
officials have said they will not cooperate with Moscow to collect
them.
   Lithuania's chief prosecutor, Arturas Paulauskas, said a general
of the Soviet Interior Ministry, Vladimir Maximov, had arrived in
Vilnius to take charge of the collection of guns.
   ``I gave him (Maximov) a warning that using force to break into
homes is a violation of the law,'' Paulauskas said. ``He said, `I
am here to fulfill Gorbachev's order,' but I don't know how he's
going to do it.''
   Tass said the sign-up for a volunteer Lithuanian ``territorial
defense'' border guard continued in the port of Klaipeda and in
Lithuania's second-biggest city, Kaunas, despite Lithuanian
leaders' assurances it was being suspended.
   Landsbergis, meanwhile, appealed again for the U.S. Congress to
extend recognition to Lithuania, which was forcibly annexed by the
Soviet Union in 1940.
   ``Support for Lithuania is support for freedom and democracy in
Eastern Europe,'' he said in a telegram to congressmen and
senators. ``This support would also undoubtedly help Mr. Gorbachev
_ it would stop him from making a great mistake.''
   Czechoslovakia's state news agency reported Thursday that
President Vaclav Havel had offered his country as a neutral site
for talks between Gorbachev and Landsbergis.
   The offer came in a telegram sent to the two men, the CTK news
agency reported.
   It reported the telegram said: ``Any forms of force, including a
mere threat, can severely damage the peaceful arrangement in
Europe.''
   The government of Iceland on Thursday also offered to mediate
the dispute and provide a venue for possible talks between
Lithuania and the Soviet Union.

<HEAD>Libyan Refueling: `Matter of Deep Concern' for U.S.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   Libya has conducted in-flight refueling tests
for jet fighter-bombers, a key step for increasing the range of
Moammar Gadhafi's military aircraft throughout the Middle East,
Pentagon sources said Thursday.
   Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams, declined to confirm the report
of such tests publicly but said such a development would be
``troubling'' to U.S. officials.
   ``Obviously, it would be a matter of very serious and deep
concern to the United States,'' Williams said when queried about
the report.
   A Pentagon official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Thursday that the Libyans ``have been working on this for quite
some time.''
   ``We consider it a serious matter,'' said the source.
   The administration's concern about Libya obtaining such
capabilities have been compounded in light of recent reports that
the Middle Eastern nation has been producing chemical weapons.
   Last year, administration officials reported that the Soviet
Union had sold Libya 6 SU-24 Fencers, high-performance
fighter-bombers that can be refueled in flight. This would allow
the jets to conduct long-range strikes, posing a potential threat
to several nations in the region, including Israel.
   According to a report published Thursday in The New York Times,
the recent Libyan test involved a Mirage F-1 and an American-made
C-130 transport plane that had been converted into a refueling
tanker.
   During the test, the report said, a refueling probe mounted on
the C-130 was connected to the Mirage on four out of six attempts,
but it wasn't clear whether fuel was actually transferred during
the maneuver.
   Libya also has tried to obtain an aerial refueling system from
Moscow for the SU-24s, the report said.
   ``We've expressed our concerns about it,'' to the Soviets, the
Pentagon official said.
   According to a publication of the International Institute for
Strategic Studies, the Libyans have a dozen French-made F-1s, a
lightweight fighter-bomber.
   Another official, who also spoke privately, said the development
has prompted renewed expressions of concern inside the
administration.
   ``We'd be worried about any long-range refueling capabilities
the Libyans acquire,'' the official said.
   Libya, under Gadhafi's leadership, has been a major purchaser of
Soviet military equipment in the past 15 years.
   Following the reports of last year's jet purchase, State
Department spokesman Richard Boucher said the administration has
``long been concerned with Gadhafi's erratic and dangerous
behavior. ... Libya continues to act in an unacceptable fashion,
particularly in its support for terrorism and international
subversion.''
   He said the United States had talked to the Soviets about arms
sales in the region. With Soviet bombers ``Libya could threaten all
of its neighbors,'' Boucher said.

<TEXT>
   Authorities imposed a curfew on the occupied
Gaza Strip on Thursday and ordered special precautions in the West
Bank and Arab areas within Israel to prevent violence on the
anniversary of a bloody 1976 Arab riot.
   In Jerusalem, about 200 supporters of the anti-Arab Kach Party
held a march and burned an American flag. They demanded the
expulsion of Palestinians from the occupied territories and accused
the United States of pressuring Israel to swap land for peace.
   The curfew took effect Thursday and confined the 700,000
Palestinians of the Gaza Strip to their homes.
   Arab reporters said roadblocks were set up outside Jerusalem to
stop West Bank residents from entering the city and Israel on the
Friday anniversary.
   The 47 Arab towns and villages inside Israel plan to hold a
general strike Friday to mark the anniversary of the riots, which
broke out over Israel's confiscation of Arab-owned land in the
Galilee. Police shot to death six people in the protests.
   The Israeli daily Maariv reported that authorities were taking
``unprecedented precautions'' because the holiday falls on the
first Friday of the Moslem holy month of Ramadan. It is normally a
tense time in the occupied territories.
   All leaves for police were cancelled and the army readied
reserve forces in case of trouble, newspapers and radio stations
reported.
   An army spokesman said soldiers may close certain areas of the
West Bank. In past periods of tension, police and soldiers have
blocked young Moslems from attending Friday prayer services at
Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa Mosque, one of Islam's holiest sites.
   The army chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron, said on army
radio: ``We will invest all the forces necessary to keep things
quiet in Judea, Samaria and the Gaza Strip.'' Judea and Samaria are
the Biblical names for the West Bank.
   In other developments Thursday:
   _Col. Yehuda Meir, the former army commander in the West Bank
city of Nablus, pleaded innocent to charges he ordered soldiers to
break the arms and legs of a group of bound and gagged Palestinians
in army custody.
   Meir, 37, entered the plea as his trial opened in military court
in Tel Aviv. He faces eight counts, including causing bodily harm
with malicious intent. Meir is the highest-ranking officer to be
tried for deviations in the 27-month Palestinian uprising.
   _A 70-year-old Palestinian man died of stabbing and beating
injuries suffered during an attack by fellow Arabs Tuesday at the
West Bank's Nur Shams refugee camp, Arab reports said.
   The victim, Said Kazmous, was wounded as he tried to protect his
32-year-old son from a group of masked Palestinians. The masked men
accused the son of being an informer for Israeli authorities.
   Kazmous' son also died in the attack.
   It brought to 201 the number of Palestinians killed by fellow
Arabs during the uprising. Most have been accused of being
informers or cooperating in other ways with Israel.
   A total of 669 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soliders
and civilians in the uprising, and 43 Israelis have been slain.

   The Senate voted Thursday in favor of
legislation affirming that abortions are legal in New Hampshire.
   The bill returns to the House, which passed it in different form.
   Thursday's voice vote followed a 14-10 vote for an amendment
that would permit legal abortions until the pregnant woman's doctor
determines that the fetus could live outside the womb on its own.
Abortions would be permitted in some circumstances afterward.
   The House version called for unrestricted legal abortions up to
the 25th week of pregnancy, and under some circumstances afterward.
   Republican Gov. Judd Gregg pledged to veto the House bill, but
his position on a more restrictive version isn't known.
   It would take 16 votes in the Senate to override a veto.
   During debate Thursday, supporters of the bill said it reflects
a New Hampshire tradition of not intruding on the right of people
to make personal decisions.
   Opponents said it sanctioned killing.

   Angola's Marxist government claimed
Thursday that its soldiers killed 270 guerrillas last week, and the
U.S.-supported rebels said they shot down a government supply
plane, killing all 25 people aboard.
   In France, the Foreign Ministry announced that a French
technician abducted by Angolan rebels died during a long, rugged
march with his captors through the southern African country.
   Angola's state airline confirmed a plane was lost and was
investigating the cause of the crash. The other claims could not
immediately be verified. The rebels have been fighting to share
power with Luanda's Soviet-backed government since shortly after
Angola gained independence from Portugal in 1975.
   Angola's state news agency ANGOP said 270 guerrillas of Jonas
Savimbi's National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, or
UNITA, were killed in fighting in six provinces in central and
southern provinces last week. The report said 37 government
soldiers were killed and 63 wounded in the fighting.
   The rebels released a statement in Lisbon saying they shot down
a government supply plane Tuesday as it flew from Huambo to Cuito,
the capital of central Bie province. They said all 25 people on the
plane died.
   The Portuguese news agency Lusa reported from Luanda that a
Spanish-built Casa 212 plane of Angola's TAAG airline crashed 20
miles west of Cuito, killing 25 people, including three Portuguese
nationals. Lusa said the three were technicians with a Portuguese
engineering firm in Luanda.
   TAAG officials were investigating the cause of the crash, and no
government official would comment on the rebels' claim of
responsibility, Lusa reported.
   The rebel statement claimed a Soviet-built Sukhoi 22 aircraft
piloted by Cubans bombed a rebel base at Likwa on Wednesday in
retaliation for the downing of the plane. That report could not be
independently confirmed.
   The U.S. military aid the rebels receive reportedly includes
Stinger ground-to-air missiles. The guerrillas are said to have
used the missiles in attacks on government supply and fighter
planes in the past.
   The French Foreign Ministry condemned the UNITA rebel movement
for the kidnapping of Jean-Francois Grossenbacher and expressed
regret that the rebels had been unable to fulfill a pledge to free
him unconditionally.
   Grossenbacher, 37, was captured Feb. 21 when guerrillas ambushed
a convoy of Angola's state oil company. UNITA announced on Feb. 22
that it was willing to release Grossenbacher. The French statement
said the technician died ``in the course of a prolonged march
through very difficult terrain.''
   Under a peace accord signed in December 1988, by Angola, Cuba
and South Africa, Cuba withdrew 31,000 of its estimated 50,000
troops from Angola. Nevertheless, the fighting in the impoverished
nation has continued.

<HEAD>Senate Narrowly Rejects Assistance Plan for Coal Miners</HEAD>

   The Senate today narrowly rejected a $500
million assistance plan for coal miners despite pleas from senators
from high-sulfur coal states that tougher pollution controls would
drive thousands of miners out of work.
   The senators rejected the amendment offered by Sen. Robert Byrd,
D-W.Va., by a vote of 50-49.
   The vote was a major victory for Senate Majority Leader George
Mitchell, D-Maine, and the White House. Both had strongly opposed
the assistance package as being too expensive and discriminatory
against other workers.
   Byrd, saying he was making ``an appeal for justice,'' had
pleaded with senators to support the aid, arguing that coal miners
were being singled out under the new clean air legislation, which
will require severe cuts in emissions from coal-fired Midwest power
plants.
   Those pollution controls are expected to cause some utilities to
switch from high-sulfur coal to other fuels, threatening the jobs
of as many as 5,000 miners.
   But Mitchell and other opponents called the aid plan
disriminatory because thousands of workers in other industries such
as steel and petrochemical also could lose their jobs, but would
have no such benefits.
   ``This amendment discriminates against all workers who are not
coal miners.,'' declared Mitchell.
   The Byrd proposal has been vigorously opposed by the Bush
administration and the Senate leadership because it goes contrary
to a compromise agreement reached with the White House on clean air
legislation.
   Critics of the amendment also argued that coal miners should not
be singled out when workers in other industries might also face job
losses and would receive no assistance.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, fearing the
assistance plan might threaten the entire bill, has put pressure on
fellow senators to defeat the amendment and has tried to persuade
Byrd to go along with a cheaper assistance package that would
include workers in other occupations.
   Byrd, D-W.Va., told a group of coal miners Wednesday that
Mitchell's compromise ``doesn't do what needs to be done'' and that
he would take his chances on the Senate floor _ a ``roll of the
dice,'' as he has characterized it on one occasion.
   Senators have not been eager to cross either Byrd, the powerful
chairman of the Appropriations Committee, or Mitchell, who can
determine when a senator's pet legislation will come up for floor
action.
   At one point, Byrd was believed to have enough votes for
approval of the coal miner assistance proposal, but Mitchell
refused to bring the matter up for a vote.
   About 500 miners and family members demonstrated outside the
Capitol on Wednesday to protest the clean air legislation.
   ``This is a human issue with real people and real jobs on the
line,'' said Robert Murray, president of Ohio Valley Coal, who
addressed the miners. He said he wanted senators to ``see the
faces'' of the people who stand to become unemployed.

   The rocket that launched a $157
million communications satellite but failed to put it in the proper
orbit burned up harmlessly in the atmosphere or fell into the
ocean, authorities said Thursday.
   The Titan 3 booster came down at 9:20 a.m. EST Wednesday, about
the time the U.S. Space Command had predicted, said Army Maj.
Thomas Niemann, a Space Command spokesman.
   ``We don't have any indication that it survived'' the fiery
descent through the atmosphere, Niemann said, but any fragments
that made it to Earth would have landed in the Pacific southeast of
Taiwan.
   The uninsured Intelsat VI satellite, launched by the rocket
March 14, is about 300 miles above Earth, a temporary position
thousands of miles lower than it is supposed to be.
   ``We can keep it there for several months, if not up to a
year,'' said Tony Trujillo, a spokesman for Intelsat, a 118-nation
consortium that owns the satellite. ``It's basically where we want
to keep it for a while.''
   Officials of Intelsat and Hughes Aircraft Co., the satellite's
builder, on Tuesday held their second meeting with officials of the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration to discuss rescue
possibilities, including a space shuttle rescue.
   ``Obviously, there are a lot of technical issues that have to be
dealt with,'' Trujillo said. ``But we're very heartened by NASA's
willingness to explore the possibility with us.''
   NASA has said a rescue attempt is feasible but more talks are
needed before any decision can be made.
   The 5-ton Intelsat VI satellite was intended for a
geosynchronous orbit 22,300 miles high, from where it would have
transmitted three TV channels and up to 120,000 telephone calls
simultaneously. It was to have eventually replaced two older
satellites over the Atlantic and was supposed to last 13 years.
   The satellite wound up in its uselessly low orbit after failing
to separate properly from the second stage of the booster. Intelsat
engineers managed to separate the satellite via computer commands,
then maneuvered it into the slightly higher, 300-mile orbit.
   The second stage of the booster, however, remained trapped in an
orbit that swung within about 100 miles of Earth and gradually was
pulled down by gravity.
   Martin Marietta Corp., which conducted the $272 million launch,
has blamed the failure on an engineering design error. The same
problem was found and corrected on a Titan 3 rocket scheduled to
launch another Intelsat VI satellite in three months, said company
spokeswoman Judy Stowell.

   Workers hooked up telexes and cleared away
debris in the Palestine Press Service on Thursday after police
lifted a two-year closure of the agency that once served as the
main source of news on the Palestinian uprising.
   The reopening of the Arab-run service was one of the first
easings of the tough restrictions that Israel imposed on
Palestinian journalists at the height of the uprising.
   Yossi Olmert, head of Israel's Government Press Office, said
there was decreased international interest in the 27-month revolt,
so authorities adopted a more liberal attitude.
   ``The uprising is declining, and some of the pressure is off,''
Olmert told The Associated Press. ``We can live with the press and
the uprising at the same time.''
   Arab newspapers still must submit all articles to the Israeli
military censor. The army also continues to block foreign
journalists from entering trouble spots by declaring them closed
military areas.
   Two weeks ago, the army gave a hint of easing restrictions when
its spokesman's office issued a directive ordering its employees to
respond to queries by Arab journalists.
   Such a practice was unthinkable early in the uprising, when
Palestinian journalists often put the spokesman's office on the
defensive with up-to-the-minute reports of troops firing on
Palestinian stone-throwers.
   At the time, the Palestine Press Service was the main liaison
between Palestinians and the foreign press. It distributed
information from a network of dozens of stringers, accompanying
foreign journalists to trouble spots and providing translation
services.
   ``In the beginning of the uprising, hundreds of journalists
would come here. We were the main source of information,'' said the
agency's co-owner, Ibrahim Karaeen, speaking in his office in
Israeli-annexed Arab east Jerusalem.
   On March 30, 1988, four months into the uprising, police ordered
the agency closed. Karaeen said army officials told him the office
was shut because of suspicions it was funded by Yasser Arafat's PLO.
   For the next two years, the four-room office stood vacant, its
door sealed by a police lock. Pigeons sneaked through an open
window, leaving behind piles of droppings and three nests of eggs
on a table in Karaeen's corner office.
   Karaeen said he was given no explanation why the ban was lifted.
   Karaeen said the organization now faces tough competition from
more than a dozen Palestinian news agencies set up in the last two
years, often one-man offices with a computer and a fax machine.
   Since the uprising against Israeli rule of the West Bank and
Gaza Strip began in December 1987, authorities have closed five
Arab-owned news agencies or newspapers, deported six Palestinian
journalists for alleged uprising activities and detained 90 others,
said Abu Ayash, former editor in chief of the Palestine Press
Service.

   State Appeals Judge Richard Brown reviews
court testimony using a video monitor connected to a stenographer's
machine that displays words as they are spoken.
   Being deaf hasn't hindered his performance in court, nor has it
dimmed his aspirations. In Tuesday's non-partisan election, Brown
will challenge Justice Donald Steinmetz for a seat on the Wisconsin
Supreme Court.
   The candidate's deafness hasn't been an issue in an unusually
hotly contested campaign that includes sparring over abortion,
court workloads, and campaign funding.
   In Wisconsin, the seven Supreme Court justices are chosen in
statewide elections for 10-year terms. Incumbents seldom are
challenged.
   Brown, a district judge since 1978, lost his hearing to a brain
tumor in 1983.
   While he relies on the video monitor during campaign debates and
court sessions, he also reads lips, and can now detect sounds with
a device implanted in December in his inner ear.
   ``My brain is still trying to figure out certain sounds,'' he
said.
   Steinmetz, 65, was elected to the bench in Milwaukee in 1966 and
joined the high court in 1980.
   Brown has accused Steinmetz of backing out of a televised debate
because he didn't want to discuss abortion, the environment, and
the Supreme Court workload.
   Steinmetz said the judicial code of ethics prevents him from
stating his personal position on issues, but he's been endorsed by
the political action committee of Wisconsin Right to Life.
Steinmetz's wife is involved with the pregnancy hotline of the
anti-abortion group, but Steinmetz said it was wrong for Brown to
suggest that abortion is a campaign issue.
   Brown has said he personally favors abortion rights, and he's
been endorsed by the abortion-rights group Voters for Choice in
Wisconsin. But he, too, cautioned that ``legally, I have no
position. I'm bound by the law of the state of Wisconsin and the
Constitution.''
   Brown has rankled Steinmetz as well as Chief Justice Nathan S.
Heffernan with a campaign claim that Supreme Court productivity has
declined and justices spend too much time bickering.
   Steinmetz disputes the claim, and alleges that Brown's candidacy
is ``bankrolled'' by special interest groups, particularly unions
and trial lawyers.
   Brown denies he is tied to special interests and has called on
Steinmetz to cancel a television commercial that quotes reports
saying Brown was offered $250,000 from lawyers to challenge
Steinmetz.

<HEAD>Plan to Form Government Reached, Protestors Demand Probe Into
Stasi Ties</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The two major political parties agreed
Thursday on a basic plan to form East Germany's first free
government, but thousands of demonstrators said the leadership was
tainted by ties to the former secret police.
   Crowds marched through major cities to demand that the newly
elected Parliament be purged of members who reputedly worked for
the notorious security apparatus of the old Communist order.
   The rallies were held a few hours after the main political
parties said they had agreed on most of the conditions for forming
a coalition government.
   Lothar de Maiziere, leader of the Christian Democratic-led
alliance that finished first in the March 18 elections, is trying
to form a government with the left-leaning Social Democrats, who
finished a distant second.
   In a joint statement, the groups said they ``concurred on most
basic points,'' and that their differences ``are negotiable.''
   More talks are expected next week, but no date was given. De
Maiziere has said he hopes to have a governent in place in two
weeks.
   A coalition with the Social Democrats would give de Maiziere the
two-thirds majority he needs to control the 400-member Parliament
and muscle through his proposal for swift reunification with West
Germany.
   The Social Democrats have expressed concern about whether they
can work with the more conservative members of de Maiziere's
three-party alliance. The Social Democrats also favor a more
gradual process for reunification than the conservatives.
   The groups that led last fall's revolt, which toppled the former
Communist government, called for nationwide demonstrations Thursday
to demand an investigation of the newly elected members of
Parliament. The groups claim many of the lawmakers were informers
for the hated secret police, known as Stasi.
   The 85,000-member Stasi and its 109,000 informers were used by
East Germany's hard-line Stalinist government for decades to
control the country.
   Under pressure from pro-democracy groups, outgoing Premier Hans
Modrow ordered the secret police disbanded after the overthrow of
hard-liner Erich Honecker last fall.
   About 20,000 people marched through downtown East Berlin to the
Parliament building to protest what they called the continued
influence of the Stasi.
   ``Stasi equals Nazi'' and ``This is irony - Stasi in
Parliament'' read placards.
   Tourists took photograhs, spectators lined the march route and
music blared from speakers as the protesters marched from Alexander
Square to the Parliament building.
   The state news agency ADN reported that about 10,000 people took
part in a demonstration in the city of Leipzig, where the peaceful
revolt against four decades of Communist rule began last year.
   Protests also were held in Jena, Karl-Marx-Stadt, and Dresden,
ADN said.
   The shadow of the massive secret police network has clouded
talks on forming a new government, considered a prelude to eventual
unification with West Germany.
   Ibrahim Boehme temporarily resigned as head of the Social
Democrats until his name could be cleared of allegations he was a
Stasi informant. Similar allegations have been made against de
Maiziere and others. Both men have denied them.

   The enslavement of blacks was ``no big deal''
compared to the current ``breakdown of civilization,'' says onetime
civil rights pioneer James Meredith.
   Meredith, 56, who in 1962 was the first black admitted to the
University of Mississippi and is now an aide to conservative Sen.
Jesse Helms, R-N.C., made his remarks during a speech Wednesday at
Suffolk University.
   ``The making of slavery as an institution does not have near the
significance as is placed on it,'' Meredith said. Other races also
were enslaved, including the ancient Israelites and white
Europeans, he said.
   ``The reason we are where we are is not because we were
slaves,'' he said. ``And if we continue to use that as an excuse,
we're going to default the future of our children. ...
   ``The fact that blacks were slaves is no big deal. The breakdown
of civilization is a big deal.''
   Meredith said blacks remained second-class citizens, however,
and he blamed the nation's liberal elite, most of them white, who
he said have conspired to keep black people down.
   Meredith said there exists no documentation of whites ever
capturing African blacks for slavery. Rather, he said, blacks sold
each other into slavery.
   The enslavement of the blacks ``was the decision and work of the
black race _ and in my judgment a wise one _ to reach the reality
of the human experience at the time,'' he said.
   Literacy rates among blacks were actually higher in the 1800s
than today, Meredith said.
   Ethelbert Miller, director of the Afro-American Resource Center
at Howard University, said Thursday that Meredith's views should
not be taken seriously.
   ``If he gave a seminar I wouldn't go, but he is entitled to his
opinion,'' said Miller, adding that he also acknowledges Meredith's
importance to the civil rights movement.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United States and the Soviet Union should
review their nuclear fail-safe systems, the chairman of the Senate
Armed Services Committee said Thursday.
   ``If nationalists or terrorists overran a Soviet nuclear storage
site in one of the republics, would the superpowers coordinate
their actions?'' Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., asked in a speech on the
changing threat worldwide.
   Ethnic unrest in Azerbaijan and Lithuania's declaration of
independence March 11 have led Moscow to resort to military force.
   The Bush administration, Nunn said, should urge the Soviet Union
to join the United States in conducting separate, but parallel
reviews, of fail-safe and control programs.
   Nunn also suggested using the Nuclear Risk Reductions Centers
for talks about how the two superpowers could avoid an inadvertent
nuclear war.
   In his second major speech in a week, Nunn acknowledged the
lessening Soviet conventional threat and questioned whether the
Bush administration is correctly characterizing the Soviet's
modernization of its strategic forces.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has said unequivocally that there
has been no change in Soviet strategic forces and that the only
change at all has been in improving their forces.
   ``The administration has tended to overstate its case,'' Nunn
said.
   U.S. intelligence, he said, has found a cutback in the Soviet's
Blackjack bomber production. In addition, the Soviets have ceased
patrolling U.S. coasts with its Yankee-class SSBM and patrolling
north of Canada with its nuclear-armed Bear-H bomber.
   In his speech, delivered on the Senate floor, Nunn also
discussed:
   _His complaints last week that the administration's fiscal 1991
defense budget has several major holes Congress will fill if the
Pentagon doesn't.
   Cheney disputed some of Nunn's allegations and said the Pentagon
is accounting for rapid changes in Eastern Europe in fashioning a
spending plan for fiscal 1992 to 1997.
   ``It is crucial to note, however, that Secretary Cheney made no
claim that the administration's fiscal 1991 budget request reflects
all these assumptions,'' Nunn said Thursday.
   Questioned about Nunn's comments, Pentagon spokesman Pete
Williams said Thursday:
   ``It would be very difficult, if not _ dare one say _ imprudent,
to send up a '91 budget on the basis of things that haven't
happened yet. As events change, we will adjust our plans
accordingly.''
   _The likelihood of the Soviet launching a ``go-it-alone'' attack
on Western Europe. The chances of such an offensive is remote,
according to Nunn, who also said the Kremlin would have a difficult
time re-establishing ``a credible threat of a large-scale
conventional attack on NATO.''
   _The dispute within the Bush administration over the potential
for reversing the dramatic events in the Soviet Union and the
Warsaw Pact nations. CIA Director William Webster has told Congress
it will be difficult; Cheney disagrees.
   Shortly after Webster's comments, Cheney said the CIA director's
testimony ``was not helpful'' to Bush's policies.

   Three small aftershocks from last month's
jarring earthquake shook the area early Wednesday, but no damage
was reported, authorities said.
   The aftershocks were centered five miles northwest of Upland.
The first two registered 2.4 on the Richter scale and struck at
6:36 a.m. and 6:38 a.m. Five hours later, 2.3-magnitude tremor was
recorded, said Robert Finn, spokesman for the California Institute
of Technology in Pasadena.
   The Feb. 28 magnitude 5.5 quake jolted most of Southern
California but caused only isolated damage. It has been followed by
hundreds of aftershocks.
   Upland is east of Los Angeles in western San Bernardino County.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase
in magnitude.
   An earthquake of magnitude 3.5 can cause slight damage in the
local area, 4 can cause moderate damage, 5 considerable damage, and
6 severe damage.

<HEAD>Washington State Expects More Seeking Abortions if Idaho Bill
Becomes Law</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Abortion providers in Washington are
gearing up for the possibility of neighboring Idaho enacting
legislation banning abortion as a method of birth control.
   ``We'll probably see an increase in the number of Idaho women
coming to Washington for abortions, and we'll probably see many of
these women taking chances with their lives if the governor signs
the bill,'' said Joyce Cameron, spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood
of Spokane and Whitman Counties.
   Idaho Gov. Cecil Andrus has promised by Saturday to either sign
or veto a bill that abortion opponents pushed through the
Legislature in hopes of getting the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn
the legalization of abortion.
   It would ban abortion except in cases of rape reported in seven
days, incest if the victim is under age 18, severe fetal deformity
or a threat to the mother's life or health.
   Andrus expressed concern Thursday that the bill may be too
restrictive even for his anti-abortion views. ``I'm looking at
that. I'm agonizing over it,'' he said.
   There are six abortion providers in Idaho: three in Boise and
one each in Moscow, Coeur d'Alene and Pocatello. In 1988, there
were 1,650 abortions performed in Idaho, said Jan Wick, of the
Department of Health's statistics unit. There were 1.3 million
legal abortions nationally.
   ``There are a lot of women who are really outraged in Idaho,''
Ms. Cameron said. ``We've had a lot of calls from women, willing to
help shuttle women. They say they'll do whatever's necessary.''
   Many Idaho women already travel to Washington for abortions.
   In 1988, the latest year figures are available, 445 Idaho women
had abortions in Washington, 365 in Utah, 31 in Oregon and four in
other states, Wick said.
   Jim Anderson, spokesman for Rescue Northwest, an anti-abortion
group, said that if the Idaho bill becomes law he did not expect a
dramatic increase in women traveling to Spokane for abortions.
   ``I'm grateful that the people of Idaho have chosen life,
because the inconvenience will cause mothers to rethink their
position and choose life for that child,'' Anderson said.
   Planned Parenthood paints a different picture.
   ``Young women, in particular, are going to be frightened and
they're not going to know what to do,'' Ms. Cameron said.
``Abortion is much safer in the first trimester, but getting money
for the abortion and then rounding up money for travel, and maybe
for overnight accommodations will force women to wait.''
   ``I think Idaho will probably see their rape statistics
skyrocket,'' she added. ``If young women can't have abortion unless
they've been raped, you'll see a lot more women saying they've been
raped.''
   Mayor Sheri Barnard, who considers herself pro-choice, said she
anticipates an increase in anti-abortion activity if Idaho women
come to Spokane for abortions.
   ``I presume the level of protest would rise in Spokane if we see
an increase in abortions here,'' the mayor said. ``In the state of
Washington, abortions are legal and it's our responsibility to see
that our laws are upheld.''

<TEXT>
   After weeks of stormy discussion
and mounting tension between Czechs and Slovaks, Parliament on
Thursday chose a new name for the country and eliminated the
outmoded ``Socialist'' label.
   Since the winter revolution, everbody _ even the ousted
Communists _ had agreed that ``Socialist'' no longer had a place in
their country's name.
   But should the Socialist Republic of Czechoslovakia be changed
to the Czecho-Slovak Republic? The Federation of Czecho-Slovakia?
Or, for those in the anti-hyphen camp, Czechoslovak Federative
Republic?
   The anti-hyphen group finally prevailed after hours of debate,
when the Czechoslovak Federative Republic won the required
three-fifths majority in Parliament.
   The debate over the hyphen, characteristic both of Czechoslovak
love of detail and absurdity, split the Czechs and Slovaks.
   Slovaks make up about one-third of Czechoslovakia's 15.5 million
people. Taking their cue from writer-president Vaclav Havel, who
proposed changing the country's name and coat of arms in January,
they waged a solid campaign for the hyphen.
   They argued the hyphen would show the world that Czechoslovakia
contains two distinct peoples _ Czechs and Slovaks.
   The Slovaks will hyphenate the country's title in writing, to
make it the Czecho-Slovak Federative Republic.
   Czechs and Moravians, who speak the same language and tend to
regard the natives of rural Slovakia as country cousins, felt
Slovak sensibilities had received enough attention.
   In 1969, under Communist leader Gustav Husak _ a Slovak _
Slovakia became a separate republic. That entitled it to half of
most federal resources.
   The name and hyphen debate raged for weeks in newspapers and
over glasses of Czech beer and Slovak wine. It finally moved to
Parliament after the government withdrew an attempt to get the
issue put off until after the June election.
   Havel, hospitalized after a hernia operation, pleaded from his
bed for what he termed the compromise solution of Czecho-Slovak
Republic. That pleased the pro-hyphen Slovaks.
   ``Czechoslovakia so far has had two great presidents, Tomas
Garrigue Masaryk and Vaclav Havel,'' Slovak deputy Roman Zelenay
told fellow legislators. Masaryk was Czechoslovakia's first
president.
   ``Both of them have put their signature under the same name of
the republic,'' Zelenay said, referring to 1918 documents that
agreed to set up a Czecho-Slovak republic. That hyphen was dropped
for reasons of expediency shortly afterward.
   Havel had a second compromise suggestion: Czechoslovak
Federative Republic.
   After intense debate, the Slovak deputies voted, predictably, en
bloc for the hyphen. The Czechs and Moravians outnumbered them and
opposed it, meaning ``Czecho-Slovak Republic'' failed to win the
day.
   ``Czechoslovak Federative Republic'' almost made it the first
time through but fell short. It was approved in a subsequent vote,
after it was agreed that Slovaks can use a hyphen when writing the
name.
   Milos Zeman, a radical economist who sits in Parliament for
Civic Forum, the movement that led the November revolution,
reminded the nation during the televised debate that there were
more crucial issues facing the nation.
   ``There is no connection between the name of the country and its
quality,'' he said.
   But Deputy Premier Josef Hromadka suggested it was a matter of
supreme importance.
   ``When an agreement is not reached in the election of a pope,''
he said, ``the rules say that there should be a one-day break. But
nobody is permitted to leave the conclave, and they may take there
only bread and water, to search their conscience.''

   The Lincoln Town Car that bore North
Dakota license plate ``1'' with Gov. George Sinner behind the wheel
now carries number ``2565'' after being sold in an effort to cut
state travel expenses.
   The car brought $18,500 Wednesday at an auction that included
sale of 74 state vehicles and a boat and trailer.
   The high bid for the 1988 Lincoln was turned in by Linton farmer
Conrad Baumstarck. He bid for the car on behalf of his brother,
Adam, a Linton insurance salesman who was in South Dakota during
the auction.
   ``I didn't think I'd get it for that money,'' said Conrad,
dressed in jeans and worn cowboy boots. He said his brother was
prepared to pay $20,000 for the car, which the state bought for
$19,800.
   Asked why his brother wanted the car, Conrad said, ``Mostly
because he's a Democrat I guess.''
   Sinner, a Democrat, ordered the auction as part of his effort to
reduce the state travel budget by 10 percent, or $550,000. The
auction raised $268,000.
   The car features power windows, an on-board computer and a
self-closing trunk, and has only by a few small scratches.
   Not everybody thought the sale was a good idea.
   Republican Sen. Jens Tennefos noted the state is trying to
improve its image, and suggested the governor ought to travel in
style.
   ``I think in the long pull it's going to cost us,'' he said.
   Sinner has two cars of his own, a 1981 Oldsmobile station wagon
and a new Chevrolet Suburban.

   The Ukrainian Communist Party expelled three
members Thursday for trying to turn the Rukh political movement
into a competing party, the official news agency Tass said.
   In a separate report, Tass said prosecutors in the Soviet
Union's second-largest republic had declared unconstitional a
decision by officials in the western Ukrainian city of Stryy to
raise the Ukrainian national flag above city offices, in addition
to the Soviet flag.
   Tass said Vitaly Donchik, Sergei Golovaty and Alexander
Burakovsky were expelled by the Ukrainian party's Control
Commission, its disciplinary body, for ``separatist aspirations,
slander against the Soviet Communist Party and actions directed at
establishing a new political party.''
   The three, all senior scientists, published a letter in an
authoritative Ukraine literary journal on March 8 setting out their
views for greater autonomy.
   Tass said other Communist Party bodies are reviewing requests by
Rukh members, including leader Ivan Drach, to leave the party.
   Mayor Igor Matiytsev of Stryy, in the Lvov region of the western
Ukraine, told a rally Wednesday that the city council with the
participation of 22 new members had voted to raise not only the
Soviet flag but the yellow-and-blue flag of Ukrainian independence
over its building, Tass said.
   The banner has become the symbol of many informal groups seeking
greater autonomy or Ukrainian independence.
   Vladimir Sinyukov, first deputy prosecutor of the Ukraine, told
Tass the Ukrainian constitution and laws prohibit the flying of the
yellow-and-blue banner.
   The action ``should be curbed by law-enforcement bodies,'' he
said.

   Leaders of the National Commission on AIDS
welcomed President Bush's first major speech on the epidemic as a
good first step, but AIDS activists said he was ``long on
compassion, short on commitment.''
   Dr. June Osborn, the commission's chairwoman, said that even
though the president offered no new initiatives, it was important
that he show concern about the issue and compassion for people with
AIDS.
   ``In terms of changing the public mood, we desperately need that
rhetoric'' as a first step toward action, Osborn said at a news
conference following Bush's speech to the National Leadership
Coalition on AIDS.
   AIDS activists said they were glad to see Bush talking about
AIDS and said he has done more than his predecessor, Ronald Reagan,
on the issue.
   But they were disappointed that Bush did not address some of the
major issues relating to AIDS, including an immigration policy that
bars people with AIDS from entering the country.
   ``He has shown sensitivity and concern that we have yet to
witness from this office, but in the end the speech that we heard
today was long on compassion, short on commitment,'' said Jean
McGuire, executive director of the AIDS Action Council.
   ``If today is the beginning and not an end to the president's
efforts, we can be hopeful. But a decade of neglect requires a more
aggressive and substantive and meaningful leadership than we heard
today,'' she said.
   She warned that ``the sensitivity we're seeing could mask the
inaction we've had for the last decade.''
   In his speech, Bush said his administration is ``on a wartime
footing'' against AIDS and called on Congress to pass the Americans
with Disabilities Act, which would bar discrimination against
people with AIDS and those who are infected with the human
immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, which causes AIDS.
   The president also touted his administration's budget proposal
of $3.5 billion for treatment, research and education about AIDS
next fiscal year.
   But AIDS activists said that Bush was trying to inflate the
administration's commitment to the AIDS battle by including, among
other things, spending on Medicaid and Medicare patients who have
AIDS. That amounts to more than $1 billion of Bush's total for AIDS
spending.
   The Public Health Service budget for AIDS _ which includes money
for the National Institutes of Health and the Centers for Disease
Control _ accounts for $1.7 billion of the total and is 7 percent
above current spending.
   Many activists had hoped Bush would address the immigration
policy, which has prompted dozens of organizations and agencies to
boycott an international conference on AIDS to be held in San
Francisco in June.
   ``We have become an embarrassment in the global community that
is dealing with this disease,'' McGuire said.
   David Rogers, vice chairman of the AIDS commission, whose
members are appointed by Congress and the White House, called the
immigration policy ``critical.''
   The administration has been granting waivers of the policy to
people entering the United States for conferences and to seek
medical attention, but pressure is building on the White House and
Congress to take HIV infection off a list of contagious diseases
used to bar entry to the country.
   Osborn and Rogers, along with commission member Belinda Mason,
who has AIDS, met with Bush at the White House for about 15 minutes
earlier in the day.
   They said they were pleased with the meeting, although they said
they received no commitments from Bush on any specific issue.
``We've set the stage for future conversations,'' Osborn said.
   Mason said Bush's remarks ``leaned rather heavily on rhetoric
... but we have to give the man a lot of points for coming out as
far out as he has.''

<HEAD>Report Says Poor Maintenance of Oil Pipeline Could Lead to Another
Spill</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   No one has been properly watching over
maintenance of the Alaskan oil pipeline to prevent a land spill as
disastrous as the ocean spill in Prince William Sound, says a
government report released Thursday.
   But since the Exxon Valdez ran aground and unleashed nearly 11
million gallons of crude oil into the Pacific Ocean last year, the
appropriate agencies are waking up, the study by the General
Accounting Office said.
   People still should be skeptical, said Rep. George Miller,
D-Calif., chairman of the House Interior subcommittee on offshore
energy rerources.
   ``I will be very skeptical,'' he said.
   Miller has been leading a congressional investigation of the
March 24, 1989 spill and the safety of other oil industry
operations in Alaska.
   ``The regulators and the regulated have been too cozy,'' he said
of the relationship between the government and the oil industry.
   He said it's too early to tell if there has been significant
improvement, but various studies under way by the government and
the criminal case against Exxon for the spill should lead to
improvements.
   The GAO said that while several federal and state agencies have
authority over the trans-Alaska pipeline system, ``the pipeline has
not received the systematic, comprehensive oversight needed to
ensure compliance with operational safety, emergency response and
environmental requirements.''
   That's particularily worrisome because of recent news that the
pipeline is corroding, James Duffus, director of the GAO's division
on natural resources management, said at a hearing before Miller's
subcommittee.
   He said that since the Exxon Valdez spill, the federal and state
governments have increased check-ups of pipeline operations and
efforts are under way to improve coordination among the agencies
with oversight responsibilities.
   ``These efforts show promise if organized and staffed
appropriately,'' he said.
   The Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management has the
major responsibility to make sure the oil industry is operating
properly, but the Department of Transportation and Alaska's
departments of natural resources and environmental conservation
also have enforcement duties.
   The GAO said that because of limited finances, the state has
relied on BLM to monitor the pipeline. But BLM has been criticized
for basically allowing the Alyeska Pipeline Service Co., which runs
the pipeline, monitor itself.
   Alyeska has been blamed for not being prepared for the spill in
Prince Wiliam Sound because of cutbacks it made over the years in
emergency safety procedures.
   Miller said Alyeska is now under new management which is being
open about the problems that exist and has shown interest in making
improvements.
   Michele Brown, of the Alaska Department of Environmental
Conservation, said, however, that in the past Alyeska has fought
the government on environmental improvements.
   ``Until recently, Alyeska took an adversarial approach to state
oversight,'' she testified. She said that wasted state money on
court action that could have gone to collecting data relating to
environmental protection and to doing inspections.

   Some passers-by grimaced at Yuri and the
Lithuanian newspapers he hawked illegally in Moscow's Pushkin
Square.
   But some bolstered him, calling out ``Molodyets!'' Russian for
``Good for you!'' Quite a few forked over a ruble ($1.50) and
snatched up the latest edition, hoping for more news than the
state-run media have been providing about the situation in the
republic.
   The spectrum of reactions reflects the varying attitudes among
Russians toward Lithuania's March 11 declaration of independence
and the influence it may have on the Soviet Union's other 14
republics.
   ``Sometimes they say, `You've done such a mean trick,' or `You
sold out the union to spread this vileness,''' said Yuri.
   But others say, ``Good for you! We support you and we're
watching you to learn from you how to live,''' said the the young
Lithuanian, who lives in Moscow.
   The average opinion of the Lithuanian action, he said, ``is
`It's not bad, what you're doing, but maybe you rushed, maybe you
didn't think things through, maybe you should have waited for more
support.'''
   Spontaneous groups of debaters have become a fixture near the
Moscow News building on the square, and most voices support
Lithuanian independence.
   ``I think every nation should choose its own road, whether for
better or worse,'' said a retired economist who identified herself
only as Valeriya.
   She said, however, that she could understand the Kremlin's
reluctance to recognize the Lithuanian declaration.
   ``No one wants children to run away,'' she said.
   One circle of debaters agreed that if President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev resorted to force, whether imposing martial law or
arresting Lithuanian leaders, it would mark the end of current
reforms.
   ``If Lithuania is crushed, there will be no democracy in
Russia,'' one man said.
   Few seemed to think this would happen.
   Even an outspoken army lieutenant colonel with a penchant for
quoting Lenin and Marx said that ``power should not come by means
of a rifle, but only by political, democratic methods.''
   Objections to Lithuanian independence focused on concern for the
Russians, Poles and other minorities who together make up 20
percent of the population of the Baltic republic.
   ``Our Russian people can't live there! They're persecuting
Communists!'' one woman said.
   An older man said: ``The mistake of the Lithuanian government
was to allow chauvinism.'' He was apparently referring to new laws
that favor the Lithuanian language and culture.
   A middle-aged, tired-eyed woman, who said she was a Russian who
had left Lithuania out of fears for her safety, touched off a hot
exchange.
   ``Why did you go there?'' a man asked her belligerently.
   ``They sent us!'' she replied. Her entire family worked for the
military, she later said.
   Another group debated why the central media, including such
progressive TV shows as ``Glance'' and ``Seven Days,'' have
reported relatively little on Lithuania. Some said the media were
intimidated by Lithuanians accusing them of one-sidedness. Others
believed the media were left in a bind by a Soviet leadership that
hadn't given them a well-formulated line to follow.
   Yuri, the young newspaper seller, also fielded questions from
several buyers about what was happening in Lithuania.
   When the shriek of a whistle sounded the warning that the police
might be coming to clamp down on his illegal sales, Yuri calmly
slipped his packet of newspapers into a gym bag and went on talking.

<HEAD>Commodity Prices at Farm Rise in March, Says USDA</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prices farmers get for raw products increased
1.3 percent from February to March, raising the overall commodity
index 2.7 percent above a year ago, the Agriculture Department said
Thursday.
   Overall, the department's ``prices received'' index matched the
record level set in January. The index declined in February then
rose again to the January level.
   Higher prices for hogs, eggs, cattle and potatoes were mostly
responsible for the increase from February, the department's
Agricultural Statistics Board said in its preliminary report.
   But the report said lower prices for tomatoes, milk and wheat
partly offset the gains for the other commodities. Most prices are
mid-March averages which will be revised next month.
   ``Hog and cattle prices moved up sharply from February while the
all-milk price declined for the second consecutive month,'' the
report said. ``Tomatoes declined sharply from February but
continuing short supplies kept prices well above normal for this
time of year.''
   Milk prices had risen to record levels until they tumbled
sharply in February, reflecting production increases. The price
decline had been predicted by USDA economists.
   ``Prices of feed grain, food grains and oilseeds were mixed,''
the report said. ``Corn and soybean prices increased slightly while
the wheat price was down. Hay prices showed a moderate increase
from February.''
   The report did not include new figures on farm expenses. Those
are computed every three months. In January, however, new quarterly
figures showed that prices paid by farmers were up 1.1 percent from
October, the previous reading, and averaged 2.9 percent more than a
year earlier.
   Department economists say the net cash income of farmers in 1990
may be in the range of $54 billion to $58 billion, compared with
about $53 billion in 1989. The record was $57.2 billion in 1988.
   Net cash income is the money nationally that farmers have left
from gross cash income during a calendar year after deducting cash
expenses. It includes government payments and proceeds from crops
grown previously but sold during the year.
   In another method taking into account changes in inventories,
depreciation and other allowances during a calendar year shows that
1990 net farm income may be in a range of $45 billion to $49
billion, compared with $49 billion last year.
   Consumer food prices are forecast by USDA economists to rise 3
percent to 5 percent this year after posting an average gain of 5.7
percent in 1989, the sharpest rise since 1981.
   Based on the preliminary figures, the March price index for
livestock and poultry was up 2.4 percent from February and averaged
7.5 percent more than a year ago.
   Milk prices dropped an additional 60 cents in March to an
average of $13.80 per l00 pounds. Even so, the preliminary March
price was up $1.10 from March 1989.
   Crop prices, overall, rose 0.8 percent from February but were
2.9 percent below the year-earlier level. Fruit prices, led by
grapfruit and oranges, were up 7 percent from February and averaged
6.4 percent more than a year ago.
   The index for commercial vegetables dropped 4.9 percent from
February but still averaged 39 percent more than in March 1989.
   ``The effect of lower prices for tomatoes was moderated somewhat
by higher prices for sweet corn and onions,'' the report said.
``Even though the tomato prices declined from last month, they are
still well above normal for this time of year due to short supplies
brought on by the December freeze.''
   The report said:
   _Cattle averaged $75.40 per 100 pounds of live weight
nationally, up from $74.60 in February and $72 in March 1989. Those
are averages for all types of cattle sold as beef.
   _Hogs averaged $52 per 100 pounds, compared with $48.20 in
February and $39.30 a year earlier.
   _Corn, at $2.34 a bushel, edged up from $2.32 in February and
was down from $2.60 a year earlier.
   _Wheat prices at the farm, according to preliminary figures,
averaged $3.42 per bushel, compared with $3.56 in February and
$4.07 a year earlier.
   _Rice averaged $7.60 per 100 pounds, compared with $7.52 in
February and $6.60 in March 1989.
   _Soybeans were $5.58 per bushel, compared with $5.57 in February
and $7.51 a year earlier.
   _Upland cotton was reported at 62.4 cents per pound, up from
60.6 in February and 55.6 a year earlier.
   _Eggs were 79.3 cents per dozen, compared with 70.4 in February
and 80.1 in March 1989.
   _Milk was $13.80 per 100 pounds, down from $14.40 in February
but above the average of $12.70 a year ago.
   _Broilers were 36.4 cents per pound, live weight, up from 33.5
cents in February but down from 38.7 cents a year earlier.

   Yevgeny Chazov, personal doctor to Kremlin leaders
and co-winner of the 1985 Nobel Peace Prize for his work with an
anti-nuclear organization, was dropped Thursday as Soviet health
minister.
   The official news agency Tass said President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev had relieved Chazov, 60, of his duties in connection with
his transfer to other work.
   His new job was not specified, and no replacement was named.
Such wording can signify official displeasure.
   Chazov signed the death certificates for the three Soviet
leaders prior to Gorbachev _ Leonid I. Brezhnev, Yuri V. Andropov
and Konstantin U. Chernenko.
   Chazov and U.S. cardiologist Bernard Lown were co-chairmen of
the International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War. The
two men shared the 1985 Nobel Peace Prize for their work in the
organization.
   Chazov had been a deputy head of the Health Ministry for 19
years and the head of the department that provided care to top
Soviet officials for two decades before being named health minister
in February 1987.
   Soviet health care is under frequent attack for poor equipment
and training, shortages of medicines, and personnel that often
seems uncaring and lazy.
   The news agency also said Minister of Civil Aviation Alexander
Volkov was transferred at the same time.

   Parents would be taught prenatal care and ways
to develop their babies' coordination, memory, language and social
skills under provisions of a bill introduced Thursday.
   ``We know that parental involvement in the education of their
children is the key to long-term gains for youngsters,'' said Sen.
Christopher Bond, R-Mo. ``Parents are their child's first and most
influential teachers.''
   Bond was joined in introducing the bill by Sen. Thad Cochran,
R-Miss., and Sen. Howell Heflin, D-Ala.
   The bill would create a national ``Parents As Teachers'' program
based on a Missouri model. A five-year, $100 million competitive
grant program would be set up for states to begin or expand Parents
As Teachers.
   The program, which operates in 26 states, uses homes visits,
group meetings, videotapes and written material to teach new and
prospective parents the skills of raising an infant. There also are
periodic health screening of children.
   Bond said the average operating costs for a Parents As Teachers
program in a school district are about $20,000 per year. He
estimated that about 1,000 school districts nationwide could
participate in the program annually with federal assistance.
   The bill would force states to eventually pick up the cost of
the program, as federal funding would decline to 75 percent in the
third year, 50 percent in the fourth year and 25 percent in the
fifth year of the five-year authorization.
   Heflin said the legislation does not conflict with Head Start
and other early childhood programs.
   ``This focuses on the parents while the others focus on the
children,'' he said.
   Head Start, touted by President Bush and virtually every
proponent of early childhood education, provides day care, health
screening, nutritious meals and other services to disadvantaged
children between the ages of 3 and 5.
   ``Parents As Teachers is even more critically needed than Head
Start because so much of human development is at-risk during
infancy. By beginning at the beginning, prevention can replace
remediation,'' said Heflin, adding that all parents are eligible,
regardless of socio-economic status.

<HEAD>Four Ceausescu Aides Changed with Genocide, to Stand Trial</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Military Prosecutor's Office on
Thursday charged four aides of former Romanian dictator Nicolae
Ceausescu with genocide for their brutal role in suppressing a
popular uprising last December, the state news agency reported.
   The four were identified as Ion Coman, a former secretary of the
Communist Party's Central Committee; Ilie Matei, a former member of
the party Politburo; Cornel Pacoste, an ex-deputy premier; and Radu
Balan, the party leader of Timis county, seat of the revolt that
began in Timisoara.
   Nearly 100 people were officially reported to have died in the
fighting in that western city, where the revolt that eventually led
to Ceausescu's ouster started Dec. 16.
   The Rompres state news agency said the four, who have been in
custody since December, face life imprisonment if found guilty.
   The four were charged with ``carrying out criminal orders given
by the dictator and his wife.''
   ``Through concrete actions they organized, coordinated and led
the brutal armed repression of the demonstrators taking part in the
popular revolt in Timisoara,'' said the indictment.
   They ``perpetrated the crime of genocide,'' said the indictment,
according to the news agency.
   Rompres said the four would be tried by Romania's Supreme
Military Tribunal, but did not specify when.
   Twenty one high-ranking officers of the hated Securitate secret
police are currently standing trial in Timisoara for their role in
the bloody crackdown on street demonstrations against the former
Communist regime.
   Initial reports from witnesses and citizens in Timisoara, where
security forces opened fire on unarmed demonstrators, set the death
toll in the hundreds.
   At one point, there were estimates that 12,000 people were
killed in Timisoara, including 7,000 reportedly executed by the
security forces.
   Four of Ceausescu's closest associates were tried last January
and found guilty of committing genocide. They are currently
appealing their life sentences.
   Ceausescu and his wife, Elena, were found guilty of genocide and
other grave crimes by a military court after their capture on Dec.
22. They were sentenced to death and shot on Christmas Day.

<HEAD>Dollar Plunges Against Yen; Lower Against Other Key Currencies</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

   The dollar plunged against the Japanese yen and
lost ground against other key currencies in choppy trading Thursday.
   Gold prices mostly were higher. On the Commodity Exchange in New
York, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $370.80 a troy
ounce, up $1.80 from late Wednesday. Republic National Bank in New
York quoted a late bid for gold at $371.40 an ounce, up $2.05.
   Traders said the dollar's pace for the day was set in Tokyo,
where a wave of selling and central bank intervention sent the U.S.
currency tumbling by more than 1.2 percent, or nearly two yen.
   In Tokyo, the dollar ended a nine-day winning streak by plunging
to 156.65 Japanese yen, from 158.63 yen on Wednesday. Later in
London, it fell further to 156.50 yen. The dollar continued falling
in New York, where it closed at 156.35 yen, compared with 158.595
yen on Wednesday.
   The dollar had been advancing against the yen for several weeks
as Japanese corporations bought the currency to help bolster their
balance sheets at the close of their fiscal year, which ends March
31, and as the yen weakened on pessimistic economic sentiment.
   But on Thursday, corporate buying interest in the dollar
suddenly dropped as the maket ``turned the corner on the Japanese
year end,'' said Kevin Lawrie, a vice president at the Bank of
Boston's New York office.
   Traders said dollar-selling by the Bank of Japan and the Federal
Reserve was heavy during Tokyo's trading session, and their
dollar-selling activity spilled over into the London session.
   Jack Barbanel, a managing director at Princeton, N.J.-based
First Global Managers, said there was ``substantial profit-taking
from the dealer community'' in addition to the central bank
intervention.
   ``It looks like the dealers are throwing their towels in,'' he
said. Most traders had been unequivocally bullish on the dollar and
believed the currency could continue its climb against the Japanese
yen.
   Barbanel also noted that the dollar's sudden drop against the
yen coincided with losses against virtually every other currencies.
   ``That gives another indication that we have some fundamental
weakness coming in the dollar,'' he said.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.6350 from $1.6285 late
Wednesday. In New York, sterling rose to $1.6395 from Wednesday's
$1.6270.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Wednesday's rates included: 1.6940 West German marks, down from
1.7105; 1.4935 Swiss francs, down from 1.5170; 5.7025 French
francs, down from 5.7490; 1,248.50 Italian lire, down from
1,256.50, and 1.1720 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1755.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late
Wednesday's rates, included: 1.6960 West German marks, down from
1.7078; 1.5005 Swiss francs, down from 1.5135; 5.7070 French
francs, down from 5.7410; 1.9083 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9200;
1,248.75 Italian lire, down from 1,255.25, and 1.1742 Canadian
dollars, down from 1.1758.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid of $372.25 a troy ounce from
$370.15 bid late Wednesday. In Zurich, gold rose to a closing bid
of $371.70 from Wednesday's $369. In Hong Kong, gold dropped $2.69
an ounce to close at $371.93.
   Silver prices rose. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for
current delivery finished at $4.946 an ounce, up from Wednesday's
$4.917. In London, silver closed at a late bid of $4.97 a troy
ounce, up from $4.95.

<HEAD>JAMA Tries to Jump Ahead of New England Journal of Medicine</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENDA C. COLEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's most widely circulated medical
journal is moving its release date to Wednesday from Friday, giving
it a one-day jump on a prestigious rival. But the rival's editor
says ``we don't feel threatened.''
   The Journal of the American Medical Association says the main
reasons for its publishing earlier in the week are improved
production capabilities, a desire to release important findings
quickly and a wish to give news reporters more time at week's end
to develop spinoff stories. The change begins next week.
   But ``if you read the (AMA) press release carefully, they want
to come out first,'' before the New England Journal of Medicine,
said Dr. Arnold Relman, editor of the Boston-based New England
Journal, which publishes on Thursday.
   ``I can't understand any other reason, beyond the obvious
competitive one,'' Relman added in a telephone interview Wednesday.
   Dr. George Lundberg, editor of JAMA, acknowledged in a news
release announcing the change last month, ``I want JAMA to be
poised to be able to publish new research findings before other
medical and scientific journals.''
   But Lundberg maintained on Thursday that competition is a lesser
motive.
   Lundberg said though articles appearing each week in the New
England Journal and in JAMA are independent of each other, they do
cover overlapping subjects ``occasionally.''
   In such instances, ``we would prefer our authors to have an
earlier publication date than theirs,'' Lundberg said.
   ``We at JAMA value media coverage greatly because one of our
basic missions is to educate the public to lead healthier lives.''
   Both journals are heavily covered by the media, and their
release dates have more to do with determining when their contents
reach airwaves and newspapers than when they reach physicians.
   JAMA, published by the Chicago-based AMA, the nation's largest
organization of doctors, has a regular English-language circulation
of 293,000, including the AMA's more than 290,000 members. The
journal also has 290,000 copies going overseas each week in 12
languages, Lundberg said.
   The 178-year-old New England Journal, the nation's oldest
medical journal, is published by the Massachusetts Medical Society.
It has a circulation of about 230,000, including 10,000 society
members and about 50,000 overseas subscribers, Relman said.
   Though it is smaller, the New England Journal carries the
``hottest'' articles, said David Pendlebury of the
Philadelphia-based Institute for Scientific Information. The
institute tracks how many times articles in 3,200 journals
worldwide are subsequently cited in published research.
   Pendlebury said a study about a year ago indicated that the 100
most-cited articles in life sciences in the previous year included
nine from the New England Journal and three from JAMA.
   ``We don't feel threatened by a change in their publication
day,'' Relman said. ``It seems to me that the content of what is
published is vastly more important than the day of the week on
which it is published.''
   Dr. Aran Ron, assistant to the medical director at Beth Israel
Medical Center in New York City, and a reader of both journals,
agreed, though for different reasons.
   ``I think that JAMA has more general interest-type articles and
covers ground a little wider, while the the New England Journal has
more scientific, specialty and in-depth articles,'' Ron said.
   ``I don't perceive a big competition from my perspective for the
two,'' added Ron, who has had research published in JAMA. ``I think
they serve different purposes.''

<TEXT>
   Gov. Cecil Andrus on Thursday expressed his
first public doubts about signing what would be the nation's most
restrictive state abortion law.
   ``I am concerned that this bill may narrow it to the point where
a woman who has suffered rape, who has suffered incest or the
mother's life is in danger might not be able to receive an
abortion,'' Andrus said at an impromptu news conference.
   ``I'm looking at that,'' he said. ``I'm agonizing over it.''
   But the Democratic governor quickly cautioned against
interpreting his remarks to mean he has decided to veto the bill.
   ``Don't read anything into it,'' Andrus said. ``My views being
pro-life haven't changed. ... But I am concerned about the bill.''
   Pro-choice forces, meanwhile, staged another rally on the
Capitol steps, dumping 10,000 potatoes in a show of support for the
campaign to launch a national boycott of Idaho's biggest cash crop
should the bill become law.
   To counter that threat symbolically Thursday, Wisconsin Right to
Life Inc. delivered a half ton of potatoes to the Salvation Army
office in Milwaukee. And a group called Concerned Women for
America, which claims 600,000 members, said it will increase potato
purchases to offset any boycott by the National Organization for
Women.
   ``This is a long-term commitment,'' said Beverly LaHaye,
president of Concerned Women. ``Our membership ... is committed to
this cause out of respect for the courageous men and women in the
Idaho Legislature.''
   A day earlier, the governor said business leaders in key Idaho
industries told him they were already losing sales because of the
evolving boycott. But while expressing concern, he said economic
considerations would not be the crucial factor in his decision.
   Later in the day, a major buyer of Idaho potatoes, McDonald's
Corp., said it had no plans to participate in any boycott over the
abortion controversy.
   Andrus promised earlier in the week he would act by Saturday on
the legislation that would ban abortion as a method of birth
control. Both sides in the debate agree it would make more than 90
percent of the abortions performed in Idaho illegal. If signed, it
would take effect July 1.
   The bill makes abortion illegal except in cases of non-statutory
rape reported within seven days, incest if the victim is under age
18, severe fetal deformity or a threat to the mother's life or
physical health.
   Some legal scholars have said it is so restrictive it will be
voided by the U.S. Supreme Court. But the National Right to Life
Committee helped draft the bill so that a promised challenge will
give the high court the opportunity to reverse its 1973 decision
legalizing abortion.
   Andrus, who has a longstanding record of opposition to abortion
except in cases of rape, incest and a threat to the woman's life,
has been consulting with legal scholars, church officials and
others. He said Thursday there was no consensus on the issue.
   ``There is a difference of opinion,'' he said. ``But my own
personal attorney in the office and some of the others, I think,
are united in that question.'' He would not elaborate.

   The State Department called in Iraq's
ambassador on Thursday and registered concern that the Arab country
is trying to circumvent U.S. restrictions on nuclear technology
shipments.
   ``We do not foresee a near-time Iraqi nuclear capability,''
spokesman Richard Boucher said. ``However, we remain concerned
about the danger...''
   Richard McCormack, the undersecretary for economic affairs, met
with Ambassador Mohamed Al-Mashat and ``expressed our deep concern
over Iraq's attempt to circumvent controls'' over military items, a
U.S. official said.
   McCormack also reiterated U.S. opposition to the spread of
missile technology in the Middle East, said the official, who spoke
on condition of anonymity.
   Iraq in December lauched a long-range three-stage rocket that is
capable of reaching Israel.
   ``I am sure the Israelis are quite concerned,'' another U.S.
official said.
   The other major cause for U.S. concern relates to the seizure
Wednesday by British customs officials of a shipment of U.S.-made
nuclear trigger components destined for Iraq. The FBI cooperated in
the case.
   The ambassador denied on Wednesday that his country is trying to
develop nuclear weapons. He said all Iraqi nuclear facilities were
subject to international inspection under the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty.
   Still, spokesman Boucher said ``the arrest of the Iraqis in
London raises once again the administration's deep concern about
proliferation in the Middle East.''
   Iraq has a nuclear facility near Baghdad that Israel bombed in
1981.
   The Washington Times reported in its Friday editions that Iraq
is installing Soviet-made ballistic missiles capable of hitting
Israel, Turkey and Cyprus.
   The newspaper, quoting unidentified U.S. intelligence officials,
said the missiles were photographed by a U.S. intelligence
satellite earlier this month and are being deployed at three remote
locations in Iraq.
   State Department officials declined to either confirm or deny
the Times' story.
   Boucher said the seizure of U.S.-made nuclear triggers ``raised
our concerns about sales to the Middle East.''
   But, he said, ``we are not aware of any irregularities'' in
Iraq's commitment to permit international inspections under the
non-proflieration treaty.
   Asked if the Bush administration would impose sanctions against
Iraq, the spokesman replied: ``We will be examining very carefully
the information from this case and we are discussing our concerns
with Iraq, both here and in Baghdad.''
   Despite its oil riches, Iraq is believed to have a debt of $70
billion to $100 billion for weapons and other costs of its long
Persian Gulf war with Iran. The Bush administration could hurt Iraq
by trying to block loans to the Middle Eastern country.
   Its record on human rights also has caused concern here. Iraq
was accused by the Bush administration of using poison gas against
Iran and against Kurds, a non-Arab minority.
   President Bush on Wednesday called upon nuclear suppliers `'to
exercise special restraint in providing materials related to the
development of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and
intermediate-range missiles in this volatile area.''
   Bush said Iraqi officials ``are well aware of our views on
nuclear proliferation which we have made clear on several
occasions.''
   On Thursday, Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said
Bush felt ``very strongly about this as a non-proliferation issue.''
   He added: ``I don't have a decision for you in terms of any kind
of conclusions about violation of the treaty and legal process.
Those are matters that we'll have to consider.''

   Nelson Mandela and Zulu leader
Mangosuthu Buthelezi said Thursday they will hold an unprecedented
joint peace rally to stop fighting in Zululand that has killed 25
people in two days.
   ``I hope that when we stand on the platform together and appeal
(for) an end to violence, the people will heed our call,'' Mandela,
leader of the African National Congress, told the independent South
African Press Association.
   ANC spokesman Ronnie Mamoepa said of the gathering to be held
Monday, ``People are dying horrendously in Natal, and that is the
reason it is going ahead as soon as possible.''
   M.V. Ngema, administrative secretary of Buthelezi's Inkatha
party, said, ``It is the most important thing in the world for them
to meet.''
   The two leaders were friends in their youth, but have not met
since Mandela was freed Feb. 11 after 27 years in prison, although
they spoke on the phone.
   They had planned to discuss the violence, but this week's
upsurge prompted the announcement of a rally at Taylor's Halt
township, one of the most violent areas around the Natal provincial
capital of Pietermaritzburg.
   Ngema said Inkatha would contact employers to let workers have
the day off.
   Police and hospital officials said at least 25 people died and
32 were critically hurt in two days of pitched battles and assaults
among war bands armed with guns, knives, clubs and sharpened sticks.
   Since 1983, supporters of the ANC _ mostly from the United
Democratic Front _ and Inkatha have struggled for control of the
townships in Natal and the adjacent Zululand tribal areas governed
by Inkatha. Nearly 4,000 people were killed the past four years.
   The ANC and Inkatha have never met at a joint gathering. Both
oppose apartheid but differ on tactics to fight the racial
segregation system; the form of a future majority government; and
on the status of tribal structures.
   White Democratic Party members of Parliament from Natal met with
President F. W. de Klerk in Cape Town and asked for immediate
action.
   Pietermaritzburg Mayor Mark Cornell suggested at a city council
meeting that the national government declare martial law in the
Edendale Valley where most of the fighting has occurred since
Tuesday.
   About 200 homes were burned and hundreds of refugees fled. Many
villagers were crammed into churches and schools on the outskirts
of the capital.
   ``Edendale is burning and I really fear that `Maritzburg' itself
will become the scene of full-scale fighting,'' Cornell said.
   The council requested more security forces.
   About 5,000 black trade union members, some carrying clubs,
marched through Johannesburg Thursday to protest government plans
to privatize transportation, hospitals and other public assets.
They presented a petition to the Johannesburg Stock Exchange asking
that the economy be nationalized to aid poor blacks.
   Police broke up a similar march of about 2,000 workers in
Pretoria and arrested 39. Union officials said 40 protesters were
bitten by dogs, beaten and tear-gassed. Police said no information
on injuries was available. But the South African Press Association
said bloodied marchers were seen in Pretoria central police
station, where they were charged with taking part in a banned march.
   Police commanders said the situation was quiet around Edendale
Thursday, but some local journalists said they had reports of
clashes in rural areas. Hospital workers, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the toll was higher than listed because relatives
removed some bodies and the deaths went unreported.
   Police denied on Thursday that officers had favored Inkatha in
the fighting, as a member of Parliament, white monitors of the
unrest and some township residents charged earlier.
   The fighting broke out after rival groups stoned buses bringing
Inkatha supporters back from a rally Sunday.
   Police said they did not disarm combatants ``as further
bloodshed would have inevitably resulted.''

   President Bush and British Prime Minister
Margaret Thatcher agree there is a need for restraint on both sides
in Lithuania's struggle for independence from the Soviet Union, a
White House spokesman said Thursday.
   ``Mrs. Thatcher has spoken out publicly about the need for
restraint. We have spoken similarly,'' said Marlin Fitzwater. ``We
still believe that peaceful dialogue is the best way to resolve
this matter and to provide self-determination for the people of
Lithuania.''
   Bush and Mrs. Thatcher are ``pretty much in alignment'' on what
is ``the best course for achieving peaceful dialogue,'' Fitzwater
said.
   A senior administration official said Bush was working intently
behind the scenes to prevent a blowup in Lithuania. The White House
toned down its rhetoric this week after repeatedly cautioning
Moscow against escalating the situation.
   ``It isn't in anybody's interest to have this thing blow up,''
the official said, insisting on anonymity. ``Nobody really wins
from the blowup. Now, it may happen. Some things (are) just like a
Greek tragedy. But nobody profits by it, and therefore what we're
hoping is, with some gentle help and encouragement, that logic will
prevail.''
   The official said the United States hopes Gorbachev survives
this test but that ``it's out of our hands'' and ``is not in the
end anything that the United States is likely to have a decisive
influence on.''
   Bush called Mrs. Thatcher in London on Wednesday after receiving
a cable from the British leader reviewing her 50-minute
conversation with Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev.
   Bush has not talked with Gorbachev since the Lithuanian
parliament declared independence March 11.
   Asked why Bush had not called Gorbachev, Fitzwater said:
   ``The president simply feels that this is not the time to make a
direct contact to Chairman Gorbechev. We believe the appropriate
posture is to consider this matter with our allies.''
   Fitzwater called the situation ``a complex and delicate
diplomatic matter.''
   ``We would not want to take moves that disrupted that diplomatic
effort,'' he said.
   Fitzwater declined comment on the Soviet offer of amnesty for
Lithuanian deserters who return to the Army. He also had nothing to
say about some conciliatory moves by Lithuania's leaders.
   On Wednesday, Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis
suspended plans to set up border posts, and advised his countrymen
not to resist if Soviet authorities came to seize their hunting
guns.
   ``We don't want to put ourselves in the position of approving or
disapproving of daily events over there,'' Fitzwater said.

<TEXT>
   Officials Thursday extended voting in
national elections to a third day because of low turnout blamed on
rain and administrative problems.
   Election director Malcolm Thompson said there had been no
reports of violence or intimidation. During the campaign, however,
there were bloody clashes between the two leading parties.
   President Robert Mugabe, 66, is being challenged for the first
time, but he is expected to easily win.
   His major competitor is Edgar Tekere, 52, of the Zimbabwe Unity
Movement. Tekere was a secretary-general of Mugabe's ruling
Zimbabwe African National Union, but he was fired from the party in
1988 after denouncing top-level corruption.
   Only 26.5 percent of the 4.8 million registered voters had cast
ballots by Thursday, the second of two scheduled days of
parliamentary and presidential voting, Thompson told a news
conference.
   However, some results had not been received from remote polling
stations by late in the day, he said.
   Thompson blamed the low turnout on heavy rain in many parts of
the country and administrative difficultires at polling booths.
   Results are now expected to be announced Wednesday, he said.
   It is the second election for this southern African nation, the
former Rhodesia, since independence from Britain a decade ago.

   Authorities said a U.S.-British investigation was
under way Thursday into alleged illegal exports of naval equipment
to Iraq, a day after customs officers foiled a bid to smuggle
nuclear triggering devices to Baghdad.
   The Customs and Excise Department said the naval equipment had
already been shipped to Iraq, but refused to give details.
   As three people appeared in court in the nuclear devices case,
Britain rejected calls to cut ties with Iraq, but said it was
contacting international agencies to try to prevent future
smuggling of material for nuclear weapons.
   British military experts said the Iraqis have been trying to
acquire sensors to develop advanced sea mines.
   ``It seems that the naval weapons are acoustic detonators,''
Paul Beaver, publisher of Jane's Defense Weekly, said in an
interview on ABC-TV's ``Good Morning America'' program.
   ``It could lead to speculation ... that Iraq is not only
involved in putting warheads onto ballistic missiles but also could
be involved in trying to develop a nuclear depth bomb with perhaps
the idea of taking out the Iranian oil wells in the neck of the
Persian Gulf. And that really sort of ups the ante considerably.''
   Iraq denies seeking nuclear capability. Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein accused the Arabs' enemies Thursday of trying to hinder
Iraq's ``march of progress.''
   The State Department in Washington called in Iraqi Ambassador
Mohamed Al-Mashat on Thursday and registered concern that the Arab
country is trying to circumvent U.S. restrictions on nuclear
technology shipments.
   Department spokesman Richard Boucher said, ``We do not foresee a
near-time Iraqi nuclear capability. However, we remain concerned
about the danger.''
   British customs officials said investigators seized documents on
Wednesday at undisclosed premises in northwestern England and
Scotland. A spokesman said the investigators want to talk to two
officials of an English company who are abroad, but stressed the
probe is only half-complete with no arrests imminent.
   Press Association, the domestic news agency, said the documents
allegedly contain proof at least one acoustic detonator has already
been smuggled to Iraq.
   The naval equipment investigation sprang from an 18-month
investigation by U.S. and British police and customs that
culminated in Wednesday's seizure at Heathrow Airport in London of
nuclear components about to be put on an Iraqi Airways flight to
Baghdad, customs officials said.
   Three people were charged in Uxbridge Magistrates Court in west
London on Thursday with violating the Export of Prohibited Goods
Control Act by trying to export 40 capacitors, essential components
in detonating a nuclear bomb.
   Lebanese engineer Toufic Fouad Amyuni, 37 and Ali Ashour Daghir,
49, a company director with dual Iraqi-British nationality, were
held over until April 5.
   Export executive Jeanine Celestine Speckman, 41, a Frenchwoman
married to a Briton, was granted bail until May 10 provided she
surrender her passport and report weekly to police.
   Iraqi national Omar Latif, who was also arrested, was
immediately served with a deportation order.
   Press Association said without attribution that Latif was also
coordinating the naval equipment operation.
   In San Diego Thursday, an indictment opened in U.S. District
Court charged five people and two British-based companies with
illegally exporting electrical components that could be used in the
detonation of nuclear warheads.
   It named Daghir, Mrs. Speckman, and three Iraqis _ Karim Dhaidas
Omran, Wallid Issa Ahmad and Dafir al-Azawi _ identified as
representating an agency of Iraq's Ministry of Industry and
Military Industrialization. The three Iraqis' whereabouts Thursday
were not known.
   The two companies, Euromac Ltd. and an affiliated company, Atlas
Equipment Ltd., were both operated by Daghir, according to the
indictment. It identified Mrs. Speckman as Euromac's export
executive.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher told the House of Commons:
``The attempted spread of nuclear weapons is very, very serious
indeed.''
   ``We shall be urgently contacting signatories of the
Non-Proliferation Treaty and also those who signed the Missile
Technology Control Regime to see what we can do to see that there
is no repeat of this very, very serious incident.''
   Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said Britain was ``urgently
consulting'' the 139 signatories of the Non-Proliferation Treaty,
which include Iraq, ``to minimize the risk of evasion.''
   He said Britain wanted more countries to sign the Missile
Technology Control Regime, adopted in April 1987 by the seven major
industrialized countries to control the export of missile
components.
   Gerald Kaufman, foreign affairs spokesman for the opposition
Labor Party, urged Britain to sever diplomatic relations with Iraq,
raise the issue at the U.N. Security Council and ask the
International Atomic Energy Agency to inspect Iraq's facilities.
   Hurd said the agency conducted an inspection a year ago, and
added: ``I can see considerable risk and damage by breaking off
diplomatic relations ... and no actual advantage.''
   ``We have two empty embassies in two important Middle East
countries and we do not want to add to that number,'' Hurd said,
referring to Iran and Syria, with whom Britain has broken relations.

   Pentagon officials are hopeful a resolution
will be worked out with Congress to avoid tens of thousands of pink
slips going to military men and women by October, a spokesman said
on Thursday.
   ``I think we're confident that we're going to get what we
need,'' Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams told reporters. ``This is
something that we continue to negotiate and discuss with Congress
in a variety of ways.''
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney is ``personnally involved'' in the
negotiations, Williams said.
   Williams said that in light of such negotiations, ``We're not
about to announce implementation of force reductions. We are
confident that we are going to get an agreement that will allow us
to do what we want to do.''
   House Armed Services Committee Chairman Les Aspin, D-Wis., has
said, however, that he intends to stick to his position of
rejecting the Pentagon request to shift $900 million from other
accounts to spend on personnel. As chairman of one of the four
major committees dealing with the issue, Aspin's stand amounts to a
veto of the request.
   The Pentagon wants to realign its funds to avoid massive layoffs
caused by reductions required under the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings
budget-cutting law.
   If Congress does not allow the Pentagon to switch the money,
Williams said several weeks ago that ``rough estimates'' indicated
that between 44,000 and 68,200 military personnel would have to be
fired outright by Oct. 1, the end of the current fiscal year.
   Tens of thousands of others would have to be frozen in their
current jobs, promotions would be delayed and fewer men and women
could be brought into the services. Currently, there are around 2.1
million men and women in uniform.
   The Senate Armed Services Committee has voted to grant the
Pentagon part of the auhority to transfer money to military
personnel accounts and avert massive layoffs.
   But that action has little overall effect on the department's
request since Aspin has refused to take up the issue in his panel.
   Such shifting of funds must be approved by the House and Senate
armed services panels and the House and Senate appropriations
committees.
   Some members of Congress have argued that the administration
brought the problem on itself, in light of last year's budget
agreement in which the administration got Capitol Hill to agree to
four months' worth of automatic spending cuts under the
Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget law.
   President Bush had the option of exempting military personnel
from the Gramm-Rudman law, but he didn't. Aspin argued that while
Bush's decision is painful for the military, the administration
must realize that accepting the Gramm-Rudman cuts meant accepting
the results.

<HEAD>Newman Denies Offering Food Company Stock to Deli Owner</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Actor Paul Newman denied Thursday that
he ever promised stock from his food companies to a delicatessen
owner, and said his so-called salad-dressing trial was ``longer
than the Academy Awards.''
   Newman and his charity food companies, Newman's Own Inc. and
Salad King Inc., are being sued by Julius Gold, who claims he was
promised stock for services in helping to launch the companies
eight years ago.
   Newman, asked to relate how the companies had developed,
testified that sales were promising when he launched them back in
1982 but there was no guarantee they would succeed.
   ``I've had films open promising and go right through the
floor,'' the Academy Award-winning actor said. ``And on the other
hand, I've had some pictures that started out very badly and became
successful. The most embarrassing thing is the salad dressing is
out-grossing my films.''
   Salad King and Newman's Own, which make salad dressing,
spaghetti sauce, popcorn and lemonade, reaped $42 million in sales
last year. All $28 million in profits since 1982 have gone to
charity.
   Newman denied promising stock in the company to Gold or anyone
else. He also denied ever having any conversations with Gold about
giving him stock.
   ``This is getting longer than the Academy Awards here'' Newman
said when asked to give some background about how the business
began.
   ``It started off as a lark,'' Newman said. ``I did not expect it
to go any place.''
   Earlier Thursday, Newman's corporate lawyer, Leo Nevas,
reasserted on the stand that he did not promise 8 percent of the
companies' stock to Gold, who brought suit in Bridgeport Superior
Court against the actor, his business partner A.E. Hotchner and the
companies.
   Nevas said he recalled discussion at a meeting about Newman
holding two-thirds of the company stock and some shares possibly
distributed to others. But the lawyer said he had no authority to
promise 8 percent to Gold.
   Newman and Hotchner formed Salad King in 1982 on a whim to sell
the dressing Newman had been making for friends in the basement of
his Westport home. The two branched into spaghetti sauce the
following year.
   Gold, a Westport deli owner, says Hotchner contacted him for
help in distributing the dressing, beginning three years of
involvement in the project. He also says Nevas promised him 8
percent of the stock.
   Newman's lawyers deny any such deal. They have tried to minimize
Gold's dealings in the venture, saying he tried to thrust himself
on the project and invited himself to meetings.
   The tiny courtroom, which seats only 30, was full again Thursday
with media and spectators. Television crews manned cameras outside
the courthouse to film Newman during breaks.
   It is the second time the case has gone to trial. The first
ended in a mistrial in June 1988 after the jury mistakenly saw
depositions not admitted as evidence.

<HEAD>Immigration Law Causing Discrimination, Report Finds</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES throughout with comments on the report, details in
regard to `hiring audit' and Kennedy plan to introduce legislation
to repeal sanctions. No pickup</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   An immigration law passed four years ago to
stem the flow of illegal aliens across the southern border of the
United States has caused widespread hiring discrimination, the
General Accounting Office reported Thursday.
   ``GAO believes many employers discriminated because the law's
verification system does not provide a simple or reliable method to
verify job applicants' eligibility to work,'' said the report from
the congressional agency.
   The report triggered calls on Capitol Hill for repeal of the
law's civil and criminal penalties _ or sanctions _ for employers
who hire illegal aliens.
   Immigration and Naturalization Service Commissioner Gene McNary
rejected those calls, describing the report as ``soft'' and
``hedged.''
   As many as 10 percent of the 4.6 million employers considered
under the GAO survey may be discriminating based on national
origins because of confusion over the 1986 Immigration Reform and
Control Act, the report said.
   Discrimination related to the law is ``widespread'' and
``serious but not pervasive,'' according to the 162-page report.
   Employers discriminate ``because the law's verification system
does not provide a simple or reliable method to verify job
applicants' eligibility to work,'' the report said.
   It indicated that those who do the hiring are uncertain about
just which applicants they may hire and discriminate lest they
incur federal sanctions.
   Bias might be reduced, the report said, by more information for
employers and a simpler, more reliable system.
   The law requires employers to complete an eligibility form for
each newly hired worker and allows employees to establish their
eligibility by presenting any of 17 different documents, such as a
U.S. passport or birth certificate or an alien registration card.
   INS and the Labor Department may inspect the forms; employers
who knowing hire unauthorized workers are subject to sanctions.
   The provisions were part of an overall bill designed to reduce
the number of illegal aliens flooding over the nation's southern
border in search of jobs. Concerns were raised in Congress during
debate on the bill that employers would discriminate against
individuals who were ``foreign looking.''
   To compile data for its report, the GAO used methods ranging
from surveying employers to a so-called hiring audit in conjunction
with the Urban Institute in which pairs of ``testers'' went job
hunting in Chicago and San Diego.
   In each pair, one tester appeared and sounded Hispanic while the
other did not. Both were equally qualified.
   Both testers applied for the same jobs. The GAO said 342
``anglo'' testers completed job applications while 327 Hispanics
did. A total of 229 anglos received interviews compared with 172
Hispanics, and 129 anglos were offered jobs compared with 85
Hispanics.
   Although the primary focus of the law was illegal immigration,
the GAO's overall study concerned itself with discrimination based
on ``national origins'' and not just bias against one group.
   McNary said some of the figures in the report are ``also soft
because there is no base of comparison in the past.'' He cited a
statement within the document that some interpreters may not agree.
   ``They own up to the fact that others may disagree, and for good
reason,'' he said at a news conference.
   His remarks brought a swift retort from officials of the
American Civil Liberties Union.
   ``The GAO grappled with this question very specifically and very
carefully,'' said Lucas Guttentag, director of the ACLU immigration
project.
   ``Who is the commissioner to question whether the documentation
is soft?'' asked Wade Henderson, associate director of the ACLU's
Washington office. ``This is not the victims of discrimination who
are complaining. This is the employers themselves.''
   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., said the report ``confirms
exactly what many of us in Congress feared when employer sanctions
were enacted in 1986. The sanctions would be discriminatory against
Hispanic American citizens, Asian-American citizens and other
ethnic minorities, and it would be difficult to implement the law
in a way that avoids such discrimination.''
   Kennedy said he would introduce legislation to repeal the
sanctions in an expedited fashion provided for under the 1986 law.
   However, Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., who has taken a leading role
in writing immigration legislation, expressed strong disagreement
with the GAO report.
   He noted that the report found that only 6.6 percent of
employers said they began not hiring job applicants whose foreign
appearance or accent led the company to suspect they might be
unauthorized aliens.
   While that was the case, the survey also found that 14.7 percent
of the employers began to hire only people born in the United
States and 13 percent stopped hiring individuals with temporary
work eligibility documents.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Food and Drug Administration said Thursday
that two lots of an anti-depressant drug called desipramine are
being recalled because some bottles may contain a blood-thinner
that could cause serious bleeding.
   The manufacturer, Pharmaceutical Basics Inc. of Denver, told the
FDA it was recalling the products after distributor H.L. Moore of
New Britain, Conn., found a mislabeled bottle of the drug earlier
this week.
   The bottle was labeled as containing 25 milligrams of
desipramine, but it contained 5 milligram tabelets of warfarin, a
blood-thinner.
   The FDA said people taking the anti-depressant should examine
their tablets to see if any are marked with the name warfarin.
   Warfarin is a non-coated pink tablet with ``5'' on one side and
``832'' and the word ``warfarin'' on the other side.
   Desipramine is a coated, lavender tablet with the numbers
``832'' and G254'' imprinted on it.
   Pharmaceutical Basics is notifying Moore's 350 customers by
phone of the possible label mix-up, the FDA said.
   The recall applies only to desipramine made by Pharmaceutical
Basics for distribution by Moore. About six other manufacturers
make despiramine.
   The FDA said it is likely that pharmacists would catch
mislabeled tablets because the two tablets are so different.
However, the FDA said people who have filled or refilled a
prescription for Moore's 25 milligram desipramine within the last
six months should return the prescription to the pharmacy to be
checked or replaced.
   The lots being recalled are G873-01 and G685-08.
   Carl Peck, director of the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and
Research, warned that if people taking four to eight tablets a day
of desipramine took the same number of warfarin tablets, ``in the
worst case, they could experience severe bleeding, such as stomach
or intracranial hemorrhage.''

   A missile-development arm of the Iraqi
government allegedly tried to buy nuclear-warhead triggers made by
a California company, according to a federal indictment unsealed
Thursday.
   The alleged role of Al-Qaqaa State Establishment in the scheme
to illegally export the electronic triggers was laid out in the
indictment against five people and two companies.
   Two of the five people named in the indictment, unsealed in San
Diego, were arrested in London Wednesday. The three others were
identified as Al-Qaqaa engineers and are believed to be in Iraq,
authorities said.
   The indictment says that, in discussions with an undercover
agent, the Iraqis did not specifically say the triggers would be
used to detonate nuclear warheads. But they insisted on design
specifications ``that left nothing to the imagination,'' said John
C. Kelley, who directs the U.S. Customs Service's strategic exports
unit.
   Kelley said the Iraqis also expressed an interest in obtaining
other components of timing devices for the warheads.
   The prospect of nuclear-warhead triggers being sold to Iraq ``is
not only illegal, it is a very frightening situation we are dealing
with,'' Customs Commissioner Carol Hallett said.
   The indictment, returned last month by a federal grand jury,
charges that Euromac (London) Ltd., and Atlas Equipment (U.K.) Ltd.
acted on behalf of the Iraqi government to illegally obtain the
devices.
   Mrs. Hallett said Euromac was a purchasing agent for the Iraqi
government and ``had done millions of dollars worth of business''
in buying arms for Iraq during that country's war with Iran.
   The indictment followed an 18-month undercover investigation
conducted by U.S. and British customs agents.
   The indictment's description of Iraq's alleged role in the
scheme contradicts denials by Iraqi officials that their government
is seeking to develop a nuclear arsenal.
   The indictment said that Ali Ashour Daghir, who was ordered held
without bond in London, was managing director of the companies.
   Jeanine Speckman, who was released on bail after her appearance
in a British court, was accused of being an executive for the
companies who participated in the negotiations to buy the triggers.
   The indictment charges that the companies and the five
individual defendants conspired to illegally export the
warhead-detonation capacitors made by CSI Technologies Inc., of San
Marcos, Calif.
   The indictment charged that the defendants did not seek export
licenses from the State Department, as required by U.S. law, after
ordering the detonators from CSI.
   The defendants are also charged with money laundering, arising
from the alleged transfer of $10,500 from Britain to CSI's account
with the Bank of America in Escondido, Calif., to pay for the
detonators.
   The indictment was returned Feb. 23 and amended with an
additional charge last week. The Al-Qaqaa engineers charged in the
indictment are Karim Dhaidas Omran, Dafir Al-Azawi and Wallid Issa
Ahmad.
   Al-Qaqaa is a weapons development unit of Iraq's Ministry of
Industry and Military Industrialization, the indictment said.
   It was not immediately clear when, and if, the defendants in
Britain could be extradited for the crimes charged in the
indictment. Mrs. Hallett conceded there was ``little likelihood''
the three engineers believed to be in Iraq would ever be arrested.
   Justice Department spokesman Dan Eramian said officials were
reviewing which crimes charged in the indictment were subject to
the U.S.-British extradition treaty.
   ``While we could request extradition tomorrow, according to the
treaty they would not be extraditable until they go through the
British legal system.''
   The indictment charges the conspiracy began in September 1988,
when the two British companies allegedly contacted a London
representative of CSI about obtaining the detonators.
   Mrs. Hallett said the company immediately notified Customs
agents of the Iraqi overture. The company entered into negotiations
that fall about the price and design specifications.
   A representative of the British company told CSI officials that
a delegation from Iraq had placed the order, the indictment stated.
   Customs agent Daniel Supnick, posing as a CSI executive, joined
the negotiations last fall in London, the indictment said.
   To disguise the shipment, Speckman suggested that it be labeled
as components for air conditioning, the indictment also said.
   The money-laundering charges stem from the alleged transfer of
money to further an illegal conspiracy.

<HEAD>Ethnic Hungarian Lambastes New Romanian Leadership</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Rev. Laszlo Toekes, an ethnic Hungarian whose
resistance ignited Romania's December revolution, accused the new
regime Thursday of abuses reminiscent of ousted Communist dictator
Nicolae Ceausescu.
   Toekes, 37, an outspoken Ceausescu critic, has been elected
bishop in the Reformed Church. An announcement Thursday by state
Bucharest radio said he will serve in the northwestern city of
Oradea, near the Hungarian border.
   In comments Thursday in Geneva, Toekes said extreme nationalist
Romanian groups were to blame for deadly clashes between ethnic
Hungarians and Romanians last week in Tirgu Mures, a Transylvania
city about 250 miles northwest of Bucharest.
   Toekes, who was traveling in the United States during the ethnic
unrest, accused the interim Romanian government of failing to
intervene and of spreading ``false information'' that ethnic
Hungarians provoked the clashes.
   He questioned the value of a proposed official inquiry, saying
authorities blamed the Hungarian population from the outset.
   Many Romanians believe ethnic Hungarians in Transylvania want to
secede and join Hungary. The ethnic Hungarians say they only want
more cultural autonomy. Last week's unrest in Tirgu Mures
reportedly killed six people and left 300 injured.
   In a statement distributed to a meeting at the Geneva-based
World Council of Churches, Toekes said ``misinformation'' from the
interim government and the Romanian media ``reminds one of the
practices of the Ceausescu-era.''
   ``Ceausescu argued in the same way, in keeping with his
long-standing policy of dividing the nationalities and playing ...
the Hungarian minority, as if the `Jews' of the country, against
the Romanian nation,'' he said.
   Ceaucescu was executed during the revolution, which broke out in
the western city of Timisoara when demonstrators tried to evict
Toekes from his church.
   Toekes had run afoul of authorities by championing Hungarian
rights. After the outbreak of the revolution, Ceausescu loyalists
tried to assassinate Toekes, but he escaped without injury.
   In his statement Thursday, he said allegations that ethnic
Hungarians in Transylvania want unification with neighboring
Hungary are unfounded and intended to incite hatred.
   ``What happened in Tirgu Mures was something like a pogrom; its
perpetrators came exclusively from among Romanians stirred up in
the spirit of Ceausescuism. ...'' he said.
   At a press conference in Thursday in Geneva, Toekes said former
Reform Church leaders had collaborated with Ceausescu and his hated
secret police. He accused senior church officials in the town of
Cluj of ``harassing and persecuting'' him for his outspoken stance.
   He also criticized the World Council of Churches for being ``too
loyal'' to hard-line Communist governments in power throughout
Eastern Europe before last year's changes swept the region.
   He said that while the World Council had consistently criticized
racial discrimination in South Africa, it had shown great tolerance
toward ``atheist regimes that were most dangerous to the Christian
faith.''
   The World Council groups about 300 non-Roman Catholic churches
in more than 100 countries.
   The Reformed Church is the largest Protestant denomination in
Romania. It has an estimated 800,000 faithful, mainly etnnic
Hungarians living in Transylvania.

<HEAD>Crewman Tells of Last, Frantic Minutes Aboard Aleutian Enterprise</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Crew members fought over survival suits in the
final minutes before a fishing boat sank in the Bering Sea a week
ago, a survivor testified at a hearing Thursday.
   Crew member Harvey Dale Philpot also told the Coast Guard and
National Transportation Safety Board inquiry that he couldn't close
the suit he had grabbed because the zipper was corroded.
   Philpot, 20, testified he had received no safety training aboard
the 162-foot trawler Aleutian Enterprise, which capsized and sank
March 22. Nine crew members are missing and presumed dead.
Twenty-two crew members survived.
   The crewman said there was little warning the ship was in
trouble, and that he first noticed something was wrong when it
began to list while he was in a freezer on the lower deck.
   When he went up to the next level the list had increased and the
port side of the deck was covered with four or five feet of water,
Philpot said.
   Philpot said he tried to turn on a pump, but it didn't work.
Crew members then began yelling to abandon ship and he ran to the
next deck up to wake up his friend, Matt Price, 19, and to get a
survival suit.
   At a box where the flotation suits were stored, he and four or
five men struggled over the suits, he said.
   ``People were trying to grab from one another,'' he said.
   Philpot said somebody tried to grab his suit, but ``I was
holding on to it. I wasn't letting go.''
   Once he was topside, Philpot donned the suit and tried to zip it
up, but found the zipper corroded. ``It just wouldn't go,'' he said.
   By that time, the ship had heeled far to port and Philpot and
others on deck were swept into the near-freezing water, he said. He
clung to buoys and debris until he was picked up by one of the life
boats, he said.
   The survivors later were picked up by other fishing boats.
   Philpot said that on another fishing boat he worked on, the crew
ran through safety drills and suit zippers were waxed to ensure
they worked. None of that happened on the Aleutian Enterprise, he
said.
   Terry Baker, chief executive officer of Arctic Alaska Fisheries
Corp., the operator of the cod fishing and processing boat, said
outside the hearing he was surprised at the testimony about the
suits.
   ``It's the first I've heard of it,'' Baker said, adding there
were more than a total of 30 suits at three locations on the boat.
   He declined to comment on Philpot's testimony about safety
training, except to say, ``We try to give as much training as
possible.''
   Philpot, the lead-off witness in the hearing that is expected to
continue through early next week, also said he thought he smelled
marijuana in the ship's pilot house early in the voyage. Under
questioning by Coast Guard officers, he said that was the only
occasion he detected any illegal drugs, and that he did not know
the crewman in the pilot house.
   The Aleutian Enterprise's captain, Mark Siemons, was outside the
pilot house at the time, he said.
   Philpot said alcohol was banned on the boat.
   As the hearing opened, attorneys for Arctic Alaska and Siemons
objected that it was being held so soon after the accident.
Attorney Jim Whitehead, representing the company, said some family
members were still conducting memorial services for the missing,
and the Coast Guard was showing ``unintended insensitivity'' to
them.
   Coast Guard Capt. Rene Roussel, the hearing's chairman, said the
Coast Guard wanted to get the information about the sinking on
record as soon as possible.

<HEAD>Albanian Hard-liners Thinking About Penal Reform</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VIENNA, Austria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Albania's hard-line Communist regime is
considering liberalizing its penal code and creating a justice
ministry to oversee its courts, that country's official news agency
reported Thursday.
   Draft laws before the Council of Ministers propose penal code
changes that would allow for rehabilitation of prisoners and an
early release program, the ATA news agency said.
   Albania's leaders have steadfastly rejected the reforms that
swept other hard-line Communist regimes from power in Eastern
Europe last year.
   However, under Communist leader Ramiz Alia, this small Balkan
country has increasingly emerged from decades of self-imposed
isolation.
   In past years, it has sought more contact with other Balkan
nations. This month, Albania opened direct telephone service with
the West.
   In another sign of cautious change, the official media
acknowledged last month that Romania holds 83 political prisoners.
   Thursday's ATA report, monitored in Vienna, gave no details of
the draft law on rehabilitation and early release. It also did not
explain exactly what the ministry of justice would do.

<HEAD>New York's Highest Court Upholds Howard Beach Convictions</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New York's highest court on Thursday upheld
the manslaughter convictions of three men found guilty in the
Howard Beach racial attack case.
   Jon Lester, Scott Kern and Jason Ladone had appealed their
convictions, contending their lawyers were wrongly prohibited from
rejecting blacks as jurors in the racially charged case.
   Lester, Kern and Ladone, all white, were convicted in December
1987 of manslaughter, assault and conspiracy for attacking three
black men in the predominantly white Howard Beach section of
Queens, a New York City borough, in 1986.
   One of the blacks, 23-year-old Michael Griffith, was struck by a
car and killed as he fled across a nearby highway. Another man,
Cedric Sandiford, was beaten with tree limbs and a baseball bat.
   The case before the state Court of Appeals centered on whether a
1986 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that prohibits prosecutors from
excluding jurors based on race also applies to defending lawyers.
State Supreme Court Justice Thomas Demakos, the presiding judge in
the Howard Beach case, applied that standard to defense lawyers.
   ``We agree with the courts below that such purposeful racial
discrimination is prohibited by ... our state Constitution,'' said
Court of Appeals Judge Fritz Alexander in a 7-0 decision.
   ``Obviously we're disappointed,'' John Pollok, a lawyer for the
three men, said Thursday. He said he hadn't seen the decision, but
that he would consider asking the U.S. Supreme Court to hear an
appeal.
   Pollok argued before the Court of Appeals that prosecutors
systematically excluded whites, without giving justification, to
help gain a conviction. At the same time, the defense was prevented
from doing the same with prospective black jurors, he said.
   As it turned out, only one black was on the 12-person jury.
There were also six whites, three Asians and two Hispanics.
   Brooklyn District Attorney Charles J. Hynes, who was appointed
special prosecutor in the Howard Beach case, praised Thursday's
decision.
   ``It means that 12 judges in two separate rulings have
unanimously affirmed that the defendants received a fair trial,''
Hynes said.
   In criminal cases, lawyers for each side may exclude a set
number of jurors without having to give a reason. However,
prosecutors may be stopped if the court believes they are rejecting
jurors because of race. In the Howard Beach case, prosecutors asked
that the same standard be applied to defense lawyers.
   The Court of Appeals also rejected arguments that the three men
were convicted with insufficient evidence.
   Lester was sentenced to up to 30 years in prison and is in jail.
Kern was sentenced to up to 18 years and Ladone up to 15 years in
prison. Kern and Ladone were still out on bail Thursday, said
Pollok.

<HEAD>Convicted Lebanese Hijacker Tries to Escape</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOCHUZ, Switzerland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Lebanese radical imprisoned after
hijacking a jetliner and killing a passenger was captured following
an abortive escape attempt, Swiss authorities reported Thursday.
   Hussein Hariri sawed through the steel bars of his cell window
late Wednesday, but he set off an alarm when he approached the
outer wall of Bochuz prison, authorities said. He offered no
resistance when guards arrived.
   Hariri commandeered an Air Afrique DC-10 on a flight from
Brazzaville, Congo, to Paris, on July 24, 1987. He was pressing
demands for the release of Lebanese and Palestinians held by
Israel, France and West Germany.
   On a refueling stop in Geneva, he shot to death a French
passenger when his deadline for readying the plane expired. He was
later overpowered by crew members and Swiss police who stormed the
plane.
   There was unconfirmed rumors that the kidnappers of two Swiss
Red Cross workers in Lebanon in October wanted to obtaining
Hariri's release. No group has so far claimed responsibility for
kidnapping Elio Erriquez and Emanuel Christen, who are still
missing.
   But when a Swiss Red Cross delegate was kidnapped in Lebanon
three months before Hariri's trial, the Swiss government said the
abductors sought leniency for the defendant. Hariri was later
sentenced to life in prison.
   The Red Cross delegate, Peter Winkler, was freed after one month
in the hands of unidentified captors. Swiss authorities said no
concessions were made to win his freedom.

<HEAD>Soviet Economy Headed for Polish-Style `Shock Therapy'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARK J. PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet economy is heading inevitably toward
Polish-style ``shock therapy'' to introduce a market system _ if
consumers do not become so disgruntled that they block all reform,
a senior official said Thursday.
   Vyacheslav Senchagov, chief of the State Price Committee, told
deputies of the Supreme Soviet that under the most radical of three
alternatives being considered, prices for raw materials and
consumer goods are likely to rise drastically, the value of the
Soviet ruble will plummet and unemployment will soar.
   The government favors a more moderate approach with a transition
period, he said in remarks before his committee carried by the Tass
news agency.
   But Tass said Senchagov acknowledged that choosing the most
radical approach is ``inevitable, if during the transitional period
... the population's confidence in the government does not fall so
low as to make no reforms possible.''
   Senchagov said the government has not yet decided which approach
it will try to implement.
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said after being sworn in as the
country's first executive president on March 15 that his most
important task was to take more radical steps to cure the economy.
   Last week a source confirmed previous news reports that
Gorbachev economists are working on a 17-point program leading to a
market system and convertibility of the Soviet Union's currency on
world markets.
   The source, who is working on the program, said Soviet
economists were encouraged by Poland's tough measures that went
into effect on Jan. 1, but were worried they might create huge
unemployment and the need for a vast welfare program.
   The source spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Many reports in Moscow say a radical economic shake-up will be
put into effect this summer.
   Senchagov's bureaucracy sets Soviet prices without regard to
actual costs, creating artificially low prices for oil and gas and
many natural resources, as well as for food and basic consumer
goods.
   But the artificially low return for Soviet industry stifles
production and initiative.
   Subsidies to keep prices low now cost the government the
equivalent of one-fifth the total volume of the country's retail
trade, Senchagov reported.
   Soviet consumers have become used to a system that offers a
minimum of choice for low prices, and many react with alarm to
reports that the government is planning to free prices. Public
concern has forced the government to delay key price reforms
several times.
   As a result of government management of prices, one
videocassette costs about twice as much as a 1,200-mile airline
trip.
   Also, the country has long told its people they have a right to
a job. But many enterprises lose money because of bloated payrolls.
   Poland's prices have increased 1,366 percent during the 12-month
period ending Feb. 28, the Warsaw government says, and more than
200,000 people are unemployed. But inflation has dropped from 79
percent in January to an estimated 6 percent in March.
   Poland has restocked its store shelves, while Soviets see their
stores becoming emptier and emptier.
   The most conservative of the three approaches in Moscow would
raise some prices for raw materials and some manufactured goods by
fixed amounts. Another would free completely up to 30 percent of
all prices, set an acceptable range for other prices, and control
prices for staple goods.
   Under the most radical approach, oil and coal prices will
increase 3-5 times. The number of collective and state farms, known
for their inefficiency, will drop by 80 percent, ``unprofitable
enterprises will be closed and unemployment will increase fast,''
Tass quoted Senchagov as saying.
   The official ruble rate against convertible currencies ``will
drop many times.'' Even in the most moderate plan, the ruble's
value will be cut in half.
   A ruble now ranges in value from $1.59 for locals in the Soviet
Union to about 16 cents when foreigners exchange their hard
currency.

<HEAD>Belgian Parliament Votes to End Abortion Ban</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RAF CASERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Parliament moved to end a 123-year ban
on abortions Thursday by voting to allow abortion during the first
12 weeks of pregnancy if the woman is deemed to be in distress.
   The Senate approved the bill last November and it now must be
signed into law by King Baudouin.
   That would leave Ireland as the only European Community nation
with a total ban on abortions.
   The House of Representatives voted 126 to 69, with 12
abstentions, to scrap an 1867 law that made abortion a criminal
offense and provided terms of up to five years in prison for
offenders.
   That law has been spottily enforced in recent years. Belgian
women have been getting abortions for years with little
interference from authorities. Also, many traveled outside Belgium
to have abortions.
   Thursday's vote split Prime Minister Wilfried Martens'
center-left coalition along Christian Democratic-Socialist lines,
but coalition partners agreed beforehand the vote would not result
in a government crisis.
   Church officials in in this overwhelmingly Catholic country
vigorously opposed the bill, though opinion polls indicated most
Belgians feel abortion should be decriminalized.
   Under the new measure, a woman can get an abortion during the
first 12 weeks of pregnancy if she and her doctor feel she is in
``distress'' due to the pregnancy.
   Opponents attacked the term ``distress'' as too vague, creating
a situation of abortion on demand.
   Conservative legislator Annemie Neyts, who supported the bill,
said, ``I have trouble with claims saying the bill is the dawn of
an age of moral depravation.''
   Christian Democrat Paul Hermans, who opposed the measure, said
supporters considered ``the fetus an inferior being which merits
only inferior protection.''
   The government of Flanders, Belgium's Dutch-speaking northern
half, meanwhile granted $5.1 million in subsidies for an
information campaign on preventing undesired pregnancies.
   Over the last 20 years, the abortion issue became a bitter
political fight. Thousands took to the streets in the 1970s over
the issue.
   Protests heated up in 1973 when a doctor was jailed for more
than a month, accused of performing hundreds of abortions. He was
later released.
   The bill approved Thursday capped a 16-year period in which more
than a dozen pro-abortion bills were voted down in parliament.

<HEAD>Thousands of Haitians Celebrate Restored Constitution</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL NORTON</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ About 10,000 demonstrators shouting
``Justice!'' and ``Democracy!'' rallied at City Hall on Thursday to
celebrate the restoration of Haiti's suspended 1987 constitution.
   The new civilian government of President Ertha Pascal-Trouillot
announced Wednesday it was restoring nearly all articles of the
constitution. A national holiday was declared for Thursday, the
third anniversary of the constitution's ratification in a popular
vote.
   The government said it restored all but a few, unspecified
articles of the constitution dealing with certain government
functions, including those of parliament, because no lawmaking body
is in place.
   The restored constitution turns the police force over to control
by a civilian justice minister. The force is now incorporated into
the army.
   Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot was named provisional president March 13
after military ruler Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril fled the country during
a popular uprising.
   ``The constitution is stronger than bayonets,'' said the Rev.
Antoine Adrien, spokesman for the Unity Assembly, a coalition of
political parties that called the rally.
   ``We have taken a giant step forward, even though we do not have
a just society yet,'' said Adrien, speaking on a platform next to
other political leaders in front of City Hall in Port-au-Prince,
the capital.
   The two-hour rally was peaceful. Schools and shops were closed
for the demonstration, the first authorized by police in more than
18 months.
   The constitution, ratified by 99 percent of the voters March 29,
1987, was suspended by then-dictator Lt. Gen. Henri Namphy in July
1988. It was partially restored by Avril in March 1989.
   The demonstrators Thursday also protested against the political
violence that has terrorized the population of this impoverished
Caribbean nation since Avril's ouster.
   Demonstrators carried cardboard signs bearing such slogans as
``Arrest all Criminals'' and ``Justice Now.'' One group of youths
hoisted a marcher on their shoulders and put a tire around his body
in a mock lynching.
   From March 18 to March 23, nearly 40 people were killed and
dozens wounded in a rash of crimes allegedly provoked by opponents
of democracy and Avril supporters.
   The government Wednesday ordered all paramilitary agents to hand
over their weapons to police within 72 hours or face prosecution.
   The dreaded paramilitary thugs, known as Tonton Macoutes, were
outlawed after dictator Jean-Claude ``Baby Doc'' Duvalier was
forced from power by another popular uprising in February 1986.
However, many former Tonton Macoutes were integrated into the army
as special agents and have often been accused of state-sponsored
terrorism.
   Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot did not attend Thursday's rally for
security reasons, said Social Affairs Minister Claudette Werleigh.
   She has promised to hold free elections as soon as possible.

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Medellin cocaine cartel hinted
Thursday it will retaliate for the government's renewed extradition
of drug suspects to the United States.
   The cartel's message came in a communique a day after the
government of President Virgilio Barco sent 29-year-old Fernando
Gutierrez to Arizona for trial on drug-trafficking and
money-laundering charges. It was the first extradition of a drug
trafficking suspect since Jan. 21.
   The cartel, which has been waging a war with the government,
claimed Thursday it had been betrayed by officials who started and
then backed out of talks aimed at a settlement to a bloody conflict
that has left more than 200 Colombians dead since the August
slaying of a presidential candidate.
   Accusing the police of murdering suspects, the group said, ``We
will not remain indifferent in the face of betrayal, torture and
killing of our companions.'' It did not elaborate.
   It again called extraditions illegal and ``attacks against
Colombian sovereignty.''
   The traffickers' communique, given to Medellin news media, was
signed by the Extraditables, the name adopted by the Medellin
cartel.
   The government has been using extraditions, feared by the
traffickers, as a weapon in its U.S.-backed war with traffickers.
   Extradition is considered necessary because traffickers often
evade Colombian justice by killing and bribing judges. Gutierrez
was the 15th Colombian extradited since August, and police are
holding 17 more Colombians wanted by the United States.
   In a statement Thursday, Barco said the government this year had
captured 845 drug suspects and seized more than 19,000 pounds of
cocaine. Other seizures include $31 million in cash, 387 pounds of
gold and about 21,000 pounds of dynamite.
   On Jan. 17, the cartel declared a unilateral truce. It said it
was prepared to surrender to the government in exchange for an end
to extradition.
   Speculation about possible talks between the government and
traffickers increased during the last two months because no one
else was extradited.
   That speculation peaked Sunday, when Interior Minister Carlos
Lemos Simmonds resigned. He said the government had lost its will
to fight the traffickers.
   In Thursday's communique, the cartel said two businessmen acted
as intermediaries in the talks. It said they were received by Barco
on various occasions to negotiate the release of the son of the
president's closest adviser, German Montoya.
   The cartel kidnapped Alvaro Montoya on Dec. 20 and released him
on Jan. 23 in one of a series of what it called goodwill gestures
to show the government its desire for peace.
   Barco denied Thursday that the government had negotiated with
traffickers and said it would continue fighting the criminals.
   ``There has not been _ nor will there be _ official nor
extra-official contacts between the government and representatives
of drug traffickers, much less pacts, treaties and agreements
between the government and drug traffickers,'' Barco said in his
communique Thursday.
   Barco acknowledged that the businessman had been received, but
he called it an informal gathering without official status.
   The cartel communique claimed that while the government was
negotiating with traffickers, it sent police death squads to wipe
them out. The cartel accused police of murdering 40 of its members.
   The Barco administration took more action Thursday against
traffickers, declaring martial law in a Medellin area township that
is reportedly controlled by Medellin cartel leader Pablo Escobar.
   The move allows a military administrator to take over policing
power from the popularly elected mayor of Envigado.

<HEAD>Astronomers From Virginia and Australia Find What May Be Brown
Dwarf Star</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Astronomers have identified for the first time
what they believe is a brown dwarf star, a stellar body that lacks
the mass to trigger the fusion reaction that gives stars their
brilliant light.
   The National Science Foundation announced Thursday that Philip
A. Ianna of the University of Virginia and Michael S. Bessell of
the Stromlo and Siding Spring Observatories in Australia identified
the candidate brown dwarf after taking measurements of its
brightness and mass.
   Visible only in the skies of the southern hemisphere, the dim,
red stellar body equals about 5 percent of the mass of the sun. The
sun emits about 4,000 times more light than the dwarf.
   The dwarf is in the Milky Way, the galaxy which includes the
sun, and is about 68 light-years away, the astronomers said. A
light-year is the distance light travels in a year, a bit less than
6 trillion miles.
   Brown dwarfs have been theorized to exist for years with most
experts predicting they would have 7 percent to 8 percent of the
mass of the sun.
   This would not be sufficient mass for gravitational forces to
compress it and heat it to the point where its hydrogen fuses into
helium. Without fusion, such a stellar body would give off only a
faint red glow caused by its modest gravitational compression.
   Ianna and Bessell said they found the candidate brown dwarf by
studying a group of very, very faint stars first discovered by
Michael R. S. Hawkins of the Royal Observatory in Edinburgh,
Scotland.
   ``We have measured the distance from Earth to what seemed like
the dimmest of these stars and found that the star is truly
faint,'' Ianna said in a statement released by the foundation.
``This supports the hypothesis that this whole group of stars is
faint and contains other brown dwarf candidates.''
   Some astronomers have suggested that brown dwarfs may be the
so-called missing matter of the universe.
   The missing matter question arose when astronomers studying the
movement of stars and galaxies concluded that gravitation forces
acting on visible stellar bodies are too great to be explained by
the mass of the observed objects in space. Some believe that up to
90 percent of the matter in the universe is not seen. Brown dwarfs,
it has been proposed, could be part of the undetected matter.
   There is also a theory that the missing mass is cold, dark
matter such as interstellar molecules, black holes and a subatomic
particles called neutrinos, which cannot be observed.
   Ianna and Bessell studied the candidate brown dwarf using an
electronic camera on the one-meter telescope at the Siding Spring
Observatory.
   Sighting from two different perspectives within the Earth's
orbit of the sun, the scientists were able to calculate the
distance of the object from Earth. The mass of the object was
estimated based on studies of its luminosity, or brightness.

   The country's top investigating agency
Thursday accused four former government officials of accepting
bribes from Airbus Industrie to award a $1.47 billion contract to
the European consortium.
   The Central Bureau of Investigation filed preliminary charges
against S.S. Sidhu, the former aviation secretary; R.K. Prasad,
Indian Airlines' former managing director; Kamini Chadha, another
former managing director of the airline; and former deputy managing
director B.K. Bhasin.
   Also accused were unidentified officials of Airbus Industrie,
based in Toulouse, France, and International Aero Engines, a
company based in Switzerland and East Hartford, Conn. It
manufactured the V-2500 engines used in the A320s.
   Under Indian law, preliminary charges are registered before the
court and state that enough evidence exits to investigate. Final or
regular charges are filed when investigations are completed.
   The charges said the officials accepted kickbacks to reverse a
decision to purchase U.S.-made Boeing 757 jetliners and instead buy
38 Airbus A320s. They did not say how much the alleged kickbacks
amounted to.
   Airbus officials in France said they had not been notified
officially about the investigation. They said they were surprised
by the allegations and refused further comment.
   The charges also said other public servants _ a term that would
include politicians in office at the time of the alleged wrongoind
_ were involved.
   The bureau began investigating the deal, completed in June,
after an Indian Airlines A320 crashed Feb. 14 while landing at the
southern Indian city of Bangalore. The crash killed 92 of the 146
people on board.
   Prasad resigned after the accident.
   The crash triggered criticism in the Indian press. It questioned
the roles played by members of Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi's
government in awarding the contract to Airbus.
   ``The previous government pushed through the deal with undue
haste,'' said India Today, a respected news magazine, a month after
the crash. ``It ignored other options as well as warning signals
about the inadequacy of the ground support system and brushed aside
the need for more time to evaluate the aircraft.''
   Indian newspapers said the Bangalore crash was a result of the
plane's engines not responding in time to a computer command by the
pilot when he found the aircraft was coming in too low for its
landing.
   It was the second crash involving an A320, the only passenger
aircraft with computerized flight controls. Three people were
killed in June 1988 when an A320 crashed during an airshow in
France.
   The government grounded all Indian Airlines A320s pending the
report of a committee investigating the Bangalore crash. Further
deliveries of the plane have been halted.
   The investigation is the third launched by Prime Minister V.P.
Singh's government into deals made by previous governments.
   Singh replaced Rajiv Gandhi as prime minister in December after
triumphing in parliamentary elections. He campaigned on a promise
to end government corruption.
   The Central Bureau of Investigation is also inquiring into the
purchase of artillery guns from the Swedish company A.B. Bofors and
the purchase of submarines from the West German firm Howaldt
Deutsche Werke. Both have been clouded by allegations of kickbacks.

   No group immediately claimed responsibility but suspicion fell
on the Irish Republican Army, which is fighting British rule in
Northern Ireland.
   A police headquarters statement in Belfast said the assailants
were believed to have fired through a window, killing the officer
instantly. It said he had been recovering at home from leg injuries

   Police also said the office of the director of public

   A police statement said investigations disclosed the boy was hit

   The new legislature of the Baltic republic Estonia
on Thursday agreed to debate a more gradual path to restoring
independence than that of Lithuania, a legislator said.
   The Supreme Soviet of Estonia, on the first day of its session,
also elected Arnold Ruutel president of the republic, reported the
official Soviet news agency Tass. Ruutel is a former chairman of
the legislature's presidium.
   Mart Laar, an independent deputy, said in a telephone interview
that the legislators Friday are to debate a declaration saying the
republic will work toward restoring the independence Estonia
enjoyed before it was annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940.
   A second proposal calls for the legislature to cooperate with
the Estonian Congress, an informal group of 500 people that met
earlier this month. They consider themselves the real
representative of Estonians.
   A bill calling for a transition to independence is on the
agenda, but the legislation probably will not be discussed Friday,
Laar said. He said the length of the transition period so far has
not been set.
   Tass said the proposals had been put forward by the Estonian
People's Front political movement, which controls more than 40 of
the 105 Supreme Soviet seats. The legislators were elected in
contested balloting March 18.
   The Estonian legislature's approach to restoring independence
mirrors the path taken by the republic's Communist Party. Meeting
Sunday, the party established a six-month transition period to full
independence from the Soviet party.
   Estonians have taken a more cautious approach than Lithuanians.
That Baltic republic declared independence from Moscow on March 11,
and it has been embroiled in a tense standoff with Soviet
authorities ever since.
   Estonian activists say they must act more cautiously because
they do not have such large ethnic or legislative majorities as the
Lithuanians do in their republic. The Estonians also say they want
to establish the conditions for independence before formally
breaking with Moscow.
   The deputies also must elect a premier. Tass said a close
election was expected between the current head of government,
Indrik Toome, and the leader of the People's Front, Edgar Savisaar.

   A long-awaited government study of cancer among
Vietnam veterans found no evidence linking the disease with
exposure to the herbicide Agent Orange, officials said Thursday.
   The study by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, which looked
only indirectly at Agent Orange, did find veterans at increased
risk of a relatively rare cancer called non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. But
researchers noted the risk was greater among veterans who served on
ships than those who served on land, where the herbicide was used.
   In Washington, Veterans Secretary Edward J. Derwinski quickly
said he would order the Department of Veterans Affairs to pay
disability compensation to vets suffering from non-Hodgkin's
lymphoma.
   The study was immediately attacked by veterans groups, which
complained it failed to sufficiently examine the cancer risks among
the thousands of soldiers who actually worked with the dangerous
herbicide during the war.
   ``It is not an Agent Orange study,'' objected Mary R. Stout,
president of the Vietnam Veterans of America.
   ``This is only a look at Vietnam veterans'' who had cancer,
added John Hansen, spokesman for the American Legion.
   And Sen. Tom Daschle, D-S.D., co-chairman of the Vietnam-Era
Veterans in Congress Caucus, said: ``This action has been a long
time coming. However, it is not the final word. We cannot forget
the many other veterans who are also suffering and dying from Agent
Orange-related diseases and who have just as much evidence
supporting their claims.''
   Agent Orange, sprayed by the U.S. military to remove jungle
cover and crops in Vietnam, contained dioxin, a highly toxic
chemical which some studies have found to increase cancer risks.
   Criticism of the study focused on its methods, which involved
comparing cancer patients of Vietnam-veteran age to healthy
counterparts.
   The study ``only indirectly evaluated'' Agent Orange exposure,
because of the technical difficulties in determining two decades
later how much a patient may have been exposed to the herbicide,
the CDC said.
   Specific analysis of dioxin exposure was impractical, partly
because researchers don't know how cancer may skew the results of
blood tests for dioxin levels, said Dr. Daniel A. Hoffman,
assistant director for science at the CDC's Center for
Environmental Health.
   ``Our study was designed to look at Vietnam experience and
history, and secondly to ascertain the likelihood of exposure,''
Hoffman said.
   The study, conducted over five years, surveyed 2,067 cancer
patients who were of approximate Vietnam service age _ between 15
and 39 in 1968, at the height of U.S. troop involvement. They were
compared to 1,776 men of similar age who had no history of cancer.
   Both groups were studied for risk of six kinds of cancer,
including soft tissue cancer and similar sarcomas, a group of
cancers that the CDC concedes has been ``of great concern among
Vietnam veterans.''
   Vietnam vets were found to have a roughly 50 percent increased
risk for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
   ``The study did not find any evidence that the increased risk
might be due to Agent Orange exposure,'' said CDC Director William
L. Roper.
   That conclusion, the CDC said, came in part because the cancer
risk among Vietnam veterans ``seemed to be the opposite of the
pattern for use of Agent Orange.''
   Vets from the Navy's ocean ships had somewhat higher cancer
risks than those who served on land. And veterans from the region
of heaviest Agent Orange use were at ``somewhat lower risk'' than
others, the CDC said.
   Specifically, the yearly risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is about
one in 10,000 for men 35-59, the age group of most Vietnam vets.
The risk for Vietnam vets overall is about 1.5 per 10,000, Roper
said.
   The risk nearly doubled _ 90 percent higher _ for Navy veterans
stationed on ocean ships.
   The 50 percent higher risk is what epidemiologists call ``a weak
association,'' Hoffman said: It is statistically significant, but
``anything less than a twofold increase can sometimes be caused by
other factors.''
   The CDC found ``no increased risk'' for sarcomas, usually
cancers of the body's connective tissues, or for other cancer types.
   The VA had been awaiting the study before deciding whether to
award benefits to vets exposed to Agent Orange. Nearly 35,000
claims have been filed citing the chemical as a cause of
disabilities including cancer, skin disease and miscarriages by
soldiers' wives.
   In announcing the non-Hodgkin's lymphoma benefits, Derwinski
mentioned only the link between Vietnam service and the lymphoma.
He didn't say the connection was because of Agent Orange.
   Payments, which would be retroactive, are expected to cost $23
million the first year and $25 million a year in succeeding years,
VA officials said. Based on the study, the VA estimated 1,800
veterans are due compensation, and there will be 450 new cases each
year.
   The complaints before the VA aren't the only ones about Agent
Orange. A class-action lawsuit against the seven manufacturers of
Agent Orange was settled in 1984 in U.S. District Court in New
York, and payments began last year.
   The court has estimated that 30,000 veterans and 18,000 survivor
families would be eligible for benefits from a settlement fund of
at least $240 million.
   The settlement's court-appointed administrator, Washington
attorney Kenneth Feinberg, had yet to see the CDC study and
couldn't say what effect, if any, it might have on the case, his
office said.

<HEAD>Report: More Bodies Found Near Stalin-era Camp</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Authorities uncovered hundreds of human
skeleton parts near a camp where Soviet soldiers kept Nazi
prisoners after World War II, East Germany's news agency said
Wednesday.
   The ADN news agency said remains of 200 to 1,000 people were
unearthed from mass graves near a former Soviet internment camp in
the district of Oranienburg, about 30 miles north of Berlin.
   Authorities began excavating at Oranienburg after a 66-year-old
resident told local officials last week that he remembers watching
Soviet soldiers shoot 100 to 400 German prisoners in the area from
1946 to 1948.
   East Germany's Berliner Zeitung newspaper said last week that up
to 12,000 German inmates may have died at another Soviet internment
camp near Fuenfeichen, about 80 miles north of Berlin.
   Many of the camps used by the Soviets had been used as prison
camps by the Nazis.
   Although the paper said most were Nazi soldiers, it said many
innocent people, including youngsters, died at the camp at
Fuenfeichen.
   There have been reports for years that large numbers of Nazi
prisoners died in Stalin-era prison camps, but little evidence
until East Germany shed its hard-line Communist government in last
year's popular revolt.
   During the Nazi era, 6 million Jews were exterminated and
hundreds of thousands of gypsies, Poles and others were killed.
   A West German official said this week that 65,000 to 70,000
German prisoners may have died at the post-war Soviet camps.

<HEAD>Contra Leader Says Most Rebels Have Returned to Nicaragua</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Most of the 12,000 Contra rebels
have returned to Nicaragua from Honduran base camps and the rest
will return by this weekend, ahead of an April 20 deadline, a
Contra chief said Thursday.
   ``They did not wait for the U.N. forces and turn in weapons,''
said Oscar Sovalbarro, a military chief of the Nicaraguan
Resistance, the rebels' umbrella group. ``Only about 3,000
war-wounded and their families remain in the camps.''
   Under an agreement reached Friday between the Contras and
representatives of President-elect Violeta Barrios de Chamorro, the
rebels are to disband and turn in their weapons five days before
the new government takes over April 25 from the leftist Sandinistas.
   Rebels in Nicaragua are to gather in U.N.-supervised security
zones under the Toncontin Accord but there is no deadline for their
demobilization. The agreement takes its name from the Honduran air
base where it was signed.
   ``A large majority of our combatants have already crossed the
Honduran border to go to Nicaragua,'' Sovalbarro said. ``The
Nicaraguan Resistance in that way fulfills its promises.''
   U.S. Ambassador Chris Arcos congratulated President Rafael
Leonardo Callejas for his role in getting the rebels to leave
Honduras.
   ``The Contras have been dissolved ... and Callejas resolved that
problem,'' Arcos said in a news conference at the presidential
offices. ``It was a notable feat by Callejas.''
   Callejas sponsored the negotiations, in which Nicaraguan
Cardinal Miguel Obando y Bravo, archbishop of Managua, also
participated.
   ``In our camps in Yamales there are few weapons and few
combatants left and before the end of the week they will be in
Nicaragua,'' Sovalbarro said.
   Yamales, 125 miles southwest of Tegucigalpa and just inside the
border with Nicaragua, has been used by the rebels since the start
nine years ago of their U.S.-backed war to overthrow the
Sandinistas.
   Sovalbarro, 29, known as Commander Ruben, signed the agreement
with the incoming government.
   ``We want to turn in our rifles in Nicaragua because if there is
going to be democracy in our country then we will exchange our
weapons for the plow to cultivate the land,'' he said.
   ``The camps will be completely deserted in the next three weeks.
No one will remain here,'' he said.
   Reporters who visited camps this week said they were nearly
deserted.
   An estimated 80,000 Hondurans displaced by the rebels, including
20,000 coffee producers, were forced to move to the interior of the
country or traveled illegally to the United States or Mexico to
find work.

   The mother of one of the 87 people killed in a
fire at an illegal social club filed a $510 million lawsuit
Thursday, the first stemming from the inferno, an attorney said.
   The lawsuit seeks that amount in damages from the owners,
lessees and proprietors of the Happy Land Social Club in the Bronx.
It also names the man charged with setting the fire.
   Attorney Harry Lipsig said he filed the lawsuit in Bronx state
Supreme Court, New York's trial-level court, on behalf of Jennie
Mae Danzler, mother of Natalie Danzler, 31.
   Lipsig said he also notified city officials he planned to sue
the city ``because of its reckless conduct in connection with the
club.''
   Earlier Thursday, angry City Council members pressed top city
officials about how Happy Land could have remained open despite
repeated warnings that such clubs were catastrophes waiting to
happen.
   ``If you don't learn from the past you're condemned to repeat
its mistakes,'' council member Sheldon S. Leffler said as he
questioned Police Commissioner Lee Brown at a meeting of the
council's Public Safety Committee.
   ``We all bear the blame,'' Bronx Borough President Fernando
Ferrer said outside the meeting. ``We've got to keep the heat on
until we can resolve this problem.''
   The fire occurred early Sunday as the club's patrons, many of
them Honduran immigrants, danced and drank liquor in a building
that lacked a liquor license and violated much of the fire code.
   Julio Gonzalez, 36, was charged with 87 counts of felony murder,
87 counts of murder through depraved indifference and one count of
attempted murder and arson. Police said he had argued with his
former girlfriend, a worker at the club.
   The City Council itself has come under criticism since the fire
because a bill that would have increased penalties for operating
clubs illegally was allowed to die in committee.
   But on Thursday, council members criticized fire and building
officials over enforcement of existing laws.
   Several council members said they were surprised to learn that
laws giving the city authority to ``seal'' premises were
interpreted as meaning only that a notice could be posted on the
door.
   During several hours of testimony, city officials insisted a
crackdown on unlicensed social clubs was more than a paper threat.
Brown said eight clubs were closed Wednesday night and 15 on
Tuesday by a beefed-up task force of police, fire and buildings
inspectors.
   One establishment ordered closed last year and again Monday was
El Caney, whose board of directors included Mayor David Dinkins'
Hispanic affairs commissioner, William Nieves, the Daily News
disclosed Thursday.
   Dinkins defended his aide at a news conference Thursday, saying
the East Harlem establishment was a non-profit cultural and
educational center, not a commercial social club.
   But he acknowledged that fire and building inspectors found the
building had faulty fire doors and should have been closed. He said
Nieves had resigned from the establishment's board of directors
before taking the city post.
   The building housing Happy Land was owned by real estate
developer Alex DiLorenzo and leased to a group called One Peach
Associates, which is partly owned by Jay Weiss, husband of actress
Kathleen Turner. One Peach sublet the building for $1,950 a month
to club proprieter Elias Colon, who died in the fire.
   The city has been trying since 1988 to close another illegal
Bronx social club in a building owned by DiLorenzo and leased by
Weiss and his partner in One Peach, Morris Jaffe, New York Newsday
reported.
   Weiss's attorneys have said they never were formally notified of
the violations the city found at Happy Land.
   DiLorenzo is the landlord for two other illegal clubs ordered
closed Nov. 20, 1988, The Daily News reported. Those clubs were
ordered shut again this week.
   Separately, DiLorenzo has been accused of 1,585 violations in
four Harlem apartment buildings he owned, 150 of them for
conditions considered imminently dangerous, the News said.
   DiLorenzo's attorney, Mark Friedlander, did not immediately
return a telephone call to his office Thursday.

``In separate,'' to note additonal House and Senate action on clean
fuels</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The Senate by a razor-thin margin turned back
pleas for special aid to coal miners Thursday, rejecting a measure
Senate leaders and the White House said could have jeopardized
broader clean air legislation.
   The $500 million assistance amendment was voted down 50 to 49
after five hours of debate during which supporters argued the
miners needed help because they would be adversely affected by
tougher air pollution controls.
   The measure was seen as the biggest remaining obstacle to
passage of major air pollution control legislation that is
scheduled for a final vote next Tuesday. A similar bill is pending
in a House committee.
   The government has estimated more than 5,000 miners of
high-sulfur coal are likely to lose their jobs as Midwest utilities
switch to other fuels to meet new pollution requirements in the
coming years.
   The narrow vote was a victory for Senate leaders of both parties
_ George Mitchell, D-Maine, and Bob Dole, R-Kan. _ as well as the
Bush administration which had opposed the assistance proposal as
too expensive and discriminatory against other workers.
   The White House had threatened to withdraw support from any bill
that exceeded the current estimated $21 billion-a-year cost, and
Mitchell said the amendment pressed by Sen. Robert C. Byrd,
D-W.Va., probably would have pushed the total beyond that level.
   In separate action late Thursday, the Senate agreed to an
amendment that would require the use, by 1993, of a cleaner blend
of gasoline in automobiles in the nine cities with the worst smog
problems. The measure was approved by a voice vote after an attempt
to kill it failed 69-30.
   In the House, the Energy and Commerce Committee beefed up a
provision in its clean air legislation with a similar requirement
calling for the use of reformulated gasoline in the same nine
cities by 1995. A proposal to require the cleaner fuel in a broader
area covering as many as 40 cities was rejected.
   The vote on the Byrd amendment to help coal miners came after
days of intense lobbying from both sides, including last minute
telephone calls from the White House to key senators _ some calls
coming even as the vote was under way. Byrd, whose power as
chairman of the Appropriations Committee is widely respected, had
visited dozens of senators in search of support.
   He got the votes of 38 of the Senate's 55 Democrats and 11 of
its 45 Republicans.
   Byrd said later that under intense White House pressure ``three
of my votes took wings.'' Among those voting with Byrd was Sen.
Spark Matsunaga, D-Hawaii, who suffers from cancer and was brought
into the chamber in a wheelchair.
   Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., said he voted against the proposal in
the last minutes after a telephone call from White House Chief of
Staff John Sununu, who told him President Bush would veto the clean
air bill if the assistance proposal were included.
   Senate leaders also had feared that if the measure were approved
other senators would seek similar financial aid for workers in
other industries. Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, promised to do just
that.
   ``This amendment discriminates against all workers who are not
coal miners,'' declared Mitchell minutes before the vote.
   Mitchell and other senators said thousands of workers in other
fields, including the steel and petrochemical industries, also
could suffer job losses and would not have such benefits.
   Byrd, who has been a staunch advocate for miners for years,
argued that the issue was a matter of ``fairness ... and justice''
because of the severe impact that new acid rain controls would have
on Midwest utilities and, in turn, on miners in high-sulfur coal
fields.
   The main clean air bill, which is scheduled for a vote in the
Senate next week, calls for sweeping pollution controls on
industry, automobiles and utility plants.
   New controls on sulfur dioxide emissions from Midwest electric
power plants _ an effort to combat acid rain _ are expected to
cause utilities to shift away from high-sulfur coal to cleaner
fuels, causing mines in Appalachia and the Midwest to close and
miners to lose their jobs.
   Calling on senators to ``hear the cries of people'' and respond
to them, Byrd said help for the miners is no different that the
federal assistance given to victims of a hurricane or earthquake,
who suffer because of no fault of their own.
   ``We're not asking for welfare,'' he declared.
   For nearly two weeks, Byrd, a former Senate majority leader who
still wields considerable power as chairman of the Senate
Appropriations Committee, has cajoled, pressured and pleaded with
senators to line up in support of his proposal.
   At the same time, Mitchell, his successor as Democratic leader,
has sought to persuade Byrd to go along with a cheaper compromise
proposal that might be acceptable to the White House. Byrd on
Wednesday said the compromise ``doesn't do what needs to be done.''
   Under the Byrd proposal, miners of high-sulfur coal, who lose
their jobs because utilities switch to other fuels, would receive
up to 70 percent of their salaries for three years and also
additional funds if they undergo a special retraining program.
   The benefits would be available as long as the miner is
unemployed.
   Byrd originally sought a six-year assistance program, costing
$1.3 billion, but he scaled down the proposal twice to garner
additional Senate support.
   The government estimates that about 5,000 miners of high-sulfur
coal _ many of them in Byrd's West Virginia _ are likely to lose
their jobs as Midwest utilities switch to other fuels because of
the new curbs on sulfur dioxide emissions.

<HEAD>Kentucky House Passes to Schools-and-Taxes Bill</HEAD>

<DATELINE>FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An education bill that would radically
overhaul a school system declared unconstitutional by the state
Supreme Court won final passage Thursday in the state House.
   House Bill 940, which also raises taxes by $1.26 billion and
which many called the most important bill of the century in
Kentucky, was passed by the Senate on Wednesday with several
amendments.
   With a single vote Thursday, the House accepted the changes. It
then voted 58-42 to pass the bill and send it to Gov. Wallace
Wilkinson. Senate Majority Floor Leader Joe Wright said Wilkinson
has assured him he would not veto the bill.
   ``We're going to do innovative things in Kentucky for once,''
said Rep. Greg Stumbo, the majority floor leader. ``We're not going
to be a follower anymore. We're going to be a leader.''
   The bill repeals and replaces all Kentucky laws on elementary
and secondary education. The Kentucky Supreme Court last year
declared the entire school system unconstitutional because its
quality varied so greatly between rich school districts and poor.
   The court found that Kentucky students were performing in the
lowest quarter nationally, as measured by standardized tests.
   The legislation will mean more money for schools in general and
dramatically greater funding for poor districts. It also calls for
a large-scale investment in technology, emphasis on early childhood
education and extra help for potential dropouts.
   Under the current system, spending for the state's 570,000
students varies from $1,800 to $4,200 a year per student, depending
on the district. Under the new plan, the minimum spending level
would be $2,900 in the 1990-91 school year. Overall state financing
for elementary and secondary education would increase from $1.5
billion this year to $1.9 billion next year.
   Under the plan, local districts will gain more control over
day-to-day operations of schools, which are to be judged by how
successfully their students learn. Cash rewards will await
employees of schools that improve each year.
   In addition, control of the system would be shifted from an
elected state superintendent to an appointed education commissioner.
   About half of the money from the tax increase would be spent on
schools. The Senate's most important amendment would eliminate
immediately the state deduction that residents receive for federal
tax payments, raising $141 million in the next two years. The House
version of the bill would have phased out the deduction.
   The governor hailed the Senate's passage of the bill Wednesday
as ``history in the making.''

   After 20 years of playing his violin in the
subways, James Graseck had nowhere to go but up. The underground
artist surfaced Thursday night in Lincoln Center, trading the A
train for Alice Tully Hall.
   The special show for Graseck's straphanging fans was a new
experience for the violinist, who usually plays Beethoven over
screeching brakes or performs Paganini on a packed platform.
   ``It is a dream come true in a way,'' Graseck said hours before
his performance. ``But at the same time, the main thing is I've
worked very hard to develop a rapport with my fellow New Yorkers.''
   Those New Yorkers _ 1,096 of 'em at $16 a pop _ bought out the
hall at Lincoln Center for Graseck's show. The violinist planned a
75-minute program of classical music but played at least a dozen
encores. Most were excerpts running no longer than three to five
minutes _ about the time one has to wait for a train.
   ``I learned these playing you-know-where,'' he told his fans
with a grin.
   After the show, he hung out with the audience in the lobby.
   ``Elaine, from the World Trade Center stop! Good to see you,''
he said, hugging one straphanger fan and waving to another. ``Bob,
I'll see you at the Long Island Railroad, OK?''
   Lillian Binder said she knew him from the Broadway-Lafayette
stop on the D line. ``I can't tell you how many times I've missed
my train listening to him,'' she said. ``One time I was late to
work and told my boss, I'm sorry, I was listening to this guy in
the subway play `Scheherazade.' My boss said, 'I know that guy.
He's great.' ``
   ``Everyone in the hall, with the exception of my family, is
someone I've met playing on the street. I'm taking them from
outside in the subways to inside at the concert hall,'' said
Graseck.
   His subway supporters actually helped finance his show. Graseck
said the $5,000 he has paid to rent Alice Tully Hall for the night
came partially from the change tossed his way by commuters.
   Graseck studied at Juilliard; one of his teachers, Christine
Dethier, planned to attend Thursday's performance. He also taught
for a few years in Columbus, Ga.
   His initial mass transit performance came in 1968 on a Long
Island Rail Road car, Graseck said. He made $10 in five minutes,
and a star was born.
   These days, a subway performer can make about $100 a day, said
Graseck, who also does freelance orchestra work. And make no
mistake _ Graseck loves the music, but he started in this line of
work for the money.
   ``At first I did it just for the money,'' he confessed. ``But
the applause, the smiles, made me feel as though I was reaching the
hearts of people. It's very spontaneous, very communicative.''
   Graseck has played on and on since then. His favorite platform
to play on is at 53rd Street and Lexington Avenue, although he pops
up at stations throughout the system. He has memories _ some of
them pretty strange _ about each spot.
   He remembers playing ``The Nutcracker Suite'' for a nude,
dancing man in the 77th Street subway station. He met his wife,
Suzanne, while playing beneath 666 Fifth Ave. He once handled a
request for ``The Billy Tell Overture'' in Times Square.
   And through it all, he says, he's kept smiling.
   ``The enjoyment, the benefit, is when you've finally gotten
through, you know you've touched some people,'' said Graseck.
``It's a nice feeling.''

<TEXT>
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl on
Thursday called on Poland to acknowledge that it inflicted ``an
injustice'' on innocent Germans who came under Polish rule after
World War II.
   Kohl quickly added that there was no obligation to apologize to
his country, saying, ``We Germans are not entitled to such words,
and even less must we try to balance accounts in one way or
another.''
   But he indicated such a gesture would be appreciated in his
speech at a dinner with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
   The occasion in this English university town marked the 40th
anniversary of the Koenigswinter Conference, set up to foster
Anglo-German relations five years after the Allied defeat of Nazi
Germany.
   Kohl recalled that one of Vaclav Havel's first acts as president
of Czechoslovakia was to express his country's remorse at the
expulsion and persecution of its German population after the war.
He suggested Poland could follow Havel's example.
   Mrs. Thatcher declared in her own speech that German unification
should not weaken security and said U.S. and British troops and
NATO nuclear missiles must remain in a united Germany.
   She also unveiled a plan to turn a 35-nation East-West summit
this year into a newly enlarged alliance of democracies across
Europe.
   In the aftermath of World War II, about 13 million Germans were
expelled from prewar German territories that now are part of Poland
and Czechoslovakia.
   Germany also became divided into Communist East and capitalist
West Germany, but with the reforms that swept Eastern Europe last
fall also came the present drive toward German unification.
   Kohl said Thursday that he had ``time and again ... recalled the
untold suffering inflicted on the Polish people by Germans'' during
the Nazi occupation of Poland.
   But, departing from his prepared text, Kohl toned down his
remarks to refrain from directly accusing Poland of mistreating
Germans.
   The prepared text said:
   ``It would no doubt be beneficial for the relationship between
our two people if Poland were to refer with equally clear and noble
words, as President Vaclav Havel did for Czechoslovakia, to the
injustice committed by Poles against innocent Germans.''
   When he spoke, Kohl noted that Havel had mentioned ``the
injustice that was also inflicted on innocent Germans,'' and said
``it would be good'' if such words ``were also possible now between
German and Polish people.''
   He said ``such a word, such a gesture, would point the way to a
future in which the relationship between the Polish and German
peoples is marked by a spirit of good-neighborliness in a common
Europe.''
   The West German newspaper Die Welt quoted Kohl in its Friday
edition as suggesting in an interview that Poland show
``understanding'' to the millions of Germans forced to leave land _
now Polish _ after the war.
   His comments were seen in West Germany as suggesting a new
effort to keep the exiles and their offspring on his side with
federal elections coming up Dec. 2.
   ``We know that horrible things happened in Poland in the name of
the Germans. We should never forget that,'' the paper quoted Kohl
as saying.
   ``But it is also completely true that at the end of the war a
nightmare was created for innocent Germans through flight and
expulsion. A word of remembrance, of understanding, and of
reconcilation sent to those Germans concerned would be a good
deed.''
   According to Die Welt, Kohl added, ``Naturally, I know we cannot
make such a demand.''
   One-third of Poland was German territory before the war, and
Kohl indicated in his Cambridge speech that he was not making a
Polish apology a condition of honoring his pledge to respect
Poland's borders.
   Kohl said a united Germany will enshrine Polish borders in ``an
internationally binding treaty'' with Poland after German
unification.
   He finally made a forthright pledge last month about Poland's
borders after months in which his position on the issue appeared
equivocal, upset Poland and worried officials in other European
countries, particularly Britain.
   Kohl said the West German government and the new democratically
elected East German government should both quickly issue identical
declarations reaffirming the inviolability of the Polish borders.
   ``This declaration should unequivocally express the idea that
immediately after unification of the two German states the
all-German government and Parliament will definitively settle the
border question along these lines in an internationally binding
treaty with the Republic of Poland,'' he said.
   Days before Kohl's arrival in London, the Polish issue became a
source of friction when the Hamburg magazine Der Spiegel said Mrs.
Thatcher claimed Kohl was still saying he did not recognize
Poland's western border.
   A Kohl spokesman denied it, saying the prime minister
misinterpreted Kohl's comments. A Thatcher spokesman would say only
that Der Spiegel accurately reported the interview with her.
   Mrs. Thatcher suggested Thursday that the 35-nation Conference
on Security and Cooperation in Europe should stipulate conditions
for free elections, hold formal meetings of foreign ministers twice
yearly and call emergency sessions in times of crisis. The summit
is expected to take place this fall.
   She also said every nation should guarantee private property and
private enterprise.
   The conference consists of the United States, Canada and all the
nations of Europe except Albania.
   The prime minister said her proposals would stress that West
Germany's defense remains with the 16-nation NATO alliance.
   ``We cannot push aside history, it would be absurd to try to do
so,'' she said. ``We must try to learn the lessons of past peace
settlements. The Americans must not go home, nor must Britain
retreat from the Continent.''
   Her stipulations on NATO troops and nuclear missiles remaining
in a united Germany could make waves for the six-nation group
overseeing the external aspects of German unification.
   The group, the so-called ``two-plus-four,'' consists of the two
Germanys and the victorious World War II allies, the United States,
the Soviet Union, Britain and France.
   Their agreement is to go before the CSCE summit.
   Kohl also said a united Germany must remain in the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization.
   ``Secession from NATO must not be the price for German unity,''
he said at the dinner.

<HEAD>Sandinistas Legalize Home Confiscations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FILADELFO ALEMAN</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
   The National Assembly, still dominated
by Sandinistas, late Thursday legalized the confiscation of
thousands of houses during a decade of leftist rule, including the
luxurious residences of party leaders.
   Property ownership has been one of the touchiest aspects of the
transition talks between the outgoing Sandinistas and the United
National Opposition, which won February elections.
   The Sandinistas have armed thousands of people and urged them to
``defend conquests of the revolution.'' The conservative,
pro-business UNO includes many victims of the confiscations among
its supporters.
   Thursday's move by the assembly also lets party organizations
keep the confiscated homes and buildings they occupy.
   ``When the Sandinistas were in power, they said they wouldn't
own property, that everything belonged to the state and they would
leave as poor as they came,'' complained opposition deputy Carlos
Cuadra of the Marxist Leninist Popular Action Movement.
   The law is expected to benefit about 10,000 people who live in
homes confiscated between the victory of the revolution on July 19,
1979, and the Feb. 25 election. UNO leader Violeta Barrios de
Chamorro is to take over the presidency from Daniel Ortega on April
25.
   The legislation provides some compensation, guaranteed by the
Finance Ministry, to former owners on a sliding scale with 20 years
to pay.
   However, Cuadra lambasted the compensation as absurdly low.
``For $2,000, a top Sandinista ends up in a home worth $50,000 or
$100,000 or more,'' he told reporters. He said the law amounts to
``institutionalizing the spoils of war.''
   The law says it is intended to ``contribute to social order,
national reconciliation and the tranquillity of Nicaraguan
hearths.''
   A transition accord between UNO and the Sandinistas said the new
government will respect the property rights of people who obtained
confiscated homes.
   The Sandinistas have pushed through several measures in the
final weeks of their term, including an amnesty for party members
as well as the U.S.-backed Contra rebels they fought.

   Hoping to defuse weeks of tension with
Moscow, Lithuania's president has told citizens of the Baltic
republic not to resist if Soviet troops tried to confiscate their
weapons.
   A deadline set by the Kremlin passed Wednesday without incident
in the republic, which has been at odds with Moscow since it
independence March 11.
   Both sides showed restraint Wednesday, with Lithuania also
shelving plans for border guards and the Soviet army refraining
from seizing more Lithuanian buildings or rounding up more military
deserters in the republic.
   ``At present, establishing border points would be stepping up
confrontation,'' Lithuanian President Vytautas Landsbergis told a
news conference in the capital of Vilnius.

   Cancer cells have been killed in the
test tube by sabotaging their genetic machinery, an early step in
what could someday become a new form of therapy, a researcher says.
   Scientists used a molecule that latched onto a key substance in
cancer cells, preventing a crucial gene from relaying its orders to
the cells.
   The research is among early work in the so-called ``anti-sense''
strategy that seeks to block the effect of particular genes in
cancer cells.
   The new results were described Wednesday, at an American Cancer
Society science writers seminar, by Dr. John Reed of the University
of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.

   President Bush's nominee for top savings and
loan regulator is getting a chilly reception from Democratic
senators who question his experience and ethics.
   T. Timothy Ryan Jr., 44, a former senior Labor Department
official, parried mostly hostile questions from the Senate Banking
Committee during a 4{-hour confirmation hearing Wednesday.
   Now a private attorney specializing in pension and employee
benefit law, Ryan has no direct experience in banking or savings
and loans.
   Nevertheless, Ryan replied, ``Absolutely,'' when senators asked
if he was fully qualified to direct the Treasury Department's
Office of Thrift Supervision, which supervises 2,600 thrift
institutions.
   Ryan said he was an experienced manager of large organizations,
citing his 1981-83 tenure as solicitor of the Labor Department
where he managed 600 attorneys working in Washington and 16 field
offices.

   Horst Bauernsachs looks at the
blackened, prewar factory buildings where outdated Trabant cars are
built and says, ``It can only get better.''
   ``I may well wind up unemployed for a time, but that's not the
end of the world,'' says the 47-year-old forklift driver, one of
11,500 workers at the plant. ``I'll just have to look around. We
won't starve.''
   Optimism prevails at the Sachsenring plant. Even though many of
its workers are likely to lose their jobs, they are looking forward
to the promise of Western-style prosperity once Germany is united
in a free-market economy.
   Volkswagen, West Germany's largest car maker, has signed a

the plant, which dates back to 1904 and uses virtually no

   Another new Nixon emerges from Richard Nixon's
new book _ at 77, a man at peace with himself who says that despite
the ordeals and crises ``I can look back and say that the day has
indeed been splendid.''
   Nixon still has the media to kick around _ ``too often they
shoot first and literally ask questions later,'' he says, adding
that Watergate ``has elevated Peeping Tom journalism and character
assassination to a new level of respectability.''
   Still, instead of an enemies list, Nixon prints a list of his
friends among journalists and says, ``I could not possibly have
gone as far as I did in the political arena without having the
benefit of some balanced as well as negative coverage.''
   ``In the Arena,'' his seventh book since leaving the presidency,
is his most personal.
   ``In the end what matters is that you have always lived life to
the hilt,'' he writes. ``I have won some great victories and
suffered some devastating defeats. But win or lose, I feel
fortunate to have come to that time in life when I can finally
enjoy what my Quaker grandmother would have called `peace at the

<HEAD>Turkish System Stops Trafficking, but Farmers Unhappy</HEAD>
<HEAD>By EMEL ANIL</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOLVADIN, Turkey (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Anti-narcotics inspectors now supervise
cultivation of opium poppies, which have grown on the dusty
Anatolian plain for 5,000 years. That pleases narcotics police, but
farmers say they're losing money.
   In 1971, poppy production was halted by a military-controlled
government under pressure from the United States to cut the supply
of opium to heroin traffickers.
   Cultivation resumed in 1974, after civilian rule was restored,
with controls intended to restrict production to pharmaceutical use.
   U.S. and Turkish narcotics police praise the system, which they
say is smuggle-proof. A small army of inspectors makes sure the
crop is used exclusively for medical purposes and does not make its
way to traffickers.
   Farmers do not share the official pleasure. They say the program
costs them money.
   ``In the old days, we could marry off two sons in one season
with the earnings from our poppy fields,'' said Halil Altimtas,
headman of Ozburnu village in Bolvadin township. ``Now the bride
prices are up, but the price for poppies remains too low.''
   Just as the current U.S. battle against cocaine focuses on South
American coca leaves, Turkish poppies were the target of an
anti-heroin campaign in the late 1960s and early 1970s.
   The United States claimed at least half the heroin reaching its
territory originated in the poppy fields spread across seven
provinces of central Turkey.
   Most problems encountered since the new system took effect in
1974 have to do with production and pricing.
   U.S. narcotics officials say no heroin from the Turkish poppy
crop has been discovered on the illicit market.
   One important reason is that farmers must use the ``poppy
straw'' harvesting method. Instead of slitting the tangerine-sized
pods to let opium gum ooze out, the method used for heroin, they
let the pods dry in the fields.
   Morphine derivatives, used as painkillers, can be extracted from
dried poppies only in a sophisticated alkaloids plant.
   Turkey spent $90 million to build the world's largest and most
advanced alkaloids factory 150 miles southwest of Ankara, the
capital, in the heart of the poppy-growing region.
   Over a decade, while the factory was being built, the government
paid another $15 million to farmers, whose poppies it was legally
obligated to buy.
   About 76,000 tons of unprocessed pods piled up in storage
because it was difficult to export something of such light weight
and great bulk. That kept the factory going at full capacity for
four years.
   Low official prices for the poppy pods discouraged cultivation
and the plant was in full production by 1986. The Turkish Alkaloids
Board captured more than half the U.S. market and 40 percent of the
world market for morphine and codeine, and earned about $10 million
a year.
   The good times did not last. The plant has been idle since
December for lack of pods to process.
   Last year's pod crop was only 3,000 tons because of autumn
drought, winter frost and the unwillingness of farmers to grow
poppies for the equivalent of 14 cents for a kilogram _ 2.2 pounds
_ of dried pods.
   India is the only other legal producer of poppies on a large
scale, but Australia recently entered the market. The United States
supports the control efforts of India and Turkey with a pledge to
buy 80 percent of its needs from them.
   Demand for morphine and its derivatives is not flexible and
averages about 200 tons a year. Competition is fierce and the price
has dropped to about $180 a kilogram. It was $800 when Turkey drew
the plans for its factory.
   The government tripled its price for pods this year to encourage
growers, but Attila Yildirim, manager of the akaloids plant, said
paying too much could put Turkey at a competitive disadvantage.
Farmers and officials agree the poppy is the most suitable cash
crop for the sandy soil of the arid Anatolian plain.
   Yildirim and officials of the State Soil Products Office are
proud of their security arrangements.
   About 600 inspectors, aided by reconnaissance planes, keep track
of the fields to prevent unlicensed cultivation or slitting of pods
for opium gum.
   Morphine is stored behind steel doors at the alkaloids plant.
Armored trucks with military and police excorts carry the products
to cargo planes.
   ``This place is better protected and less accesible to outsiders
than most military bases,'' Yildirim said.

<TEXT>
   The government says having many
children is a woman's patriotic duty, but decades of large families
have overloaded the school system and created a serious
unemployment threat.
   In the 1950s, the communist government set out to increase the
population of Mongolia's 930,000 square miles by offering money and
special privileges to couples with more than four children.
   ``In other countries ... the population policy is to keep it at
the same level or to keep it low, but Mongolia is different,''
Navch, head of the government demography department, said in an
interview.
   ``We have a small population,'' she said. ``That's why we have
such a policy,''
   Mongolia's population was 649,300 when it became independent in
1921. It experienced a baby boom in the 1960s and 1970s and the
birthrate peaked in 1963 at 43 per thousand people, well over the
1980-1985 world averge of 27.7 births per thousand.
   By 1989, government incentives combined with better living
conditions and health care had raised the population to 2.09
million.
   Yanjinsuren, a 46-year-old herdswoman who lives outside Ulan
Bator, the capital, has 10 children ranging in age from 28 to 2.
   ``I like babies,'' she said. ``I think it's lucky to have many
children. I'm a working woman, but still, the Mongolian family and
Mongolian traditions are the most important thing.''
   Mothers with more than four children receive $133 to $1,033
annually for each child under 16, depending on the child's age and
the total number of children.
   Those with more than five children get a medal and the title
``mother of the second degree,'' and a woman with eight or more
children is a ``mother of the first degree.'' The records say
92,600 women received medals and titles in 1988.
   Encouraging large families had unforeseen results. Nursery
schools can accommodate only one child in six and kindergartens
only one in three, the Communist Party newspaper Unen reported.
   Three shifts operate at some schools in Ulan Bator, where
one-fourth of all Mongolians live, the paper said, and only 21
percent of the nation's doctors are pediatricians.
   Unemployment is a major potential problem. About 50 percent of
Mongolians are under age 18 and will create a glut when they enter
the labor market unless the economy grows more rapidly.
   ``Now our policy is not just increasing the population, but also
to raise the quality of the population,'' said Gerel, head of the
population bureau. ``We have to look at the labor force and balance
everything.''
   A new health law that took effect in January gives women the
right to decide how many children they will have, and when.
   It makes abortions free to all and lengthens maternity leave
from nine months to two years. Abortions previously were restricted
to women over 35 with four or more children.
   Many younger women balk at raising large families and feel they
can show their patriotism in other ways.
   Navch, 35, has a 12-year-old daughter and a son of 9. She does
not intend to have more.
   ``That's enough,'' she said. ``After 35, it's too old.''
   A recent survey found that 57 percent of women questioned
thought four was the ideal number of children. Last year, the
average number of children per woman of child-bearing age was 4.8,
down from seven 20 years ago.
   Baasay, 44, a herdswoman with eight children, said a married
daughter told her recently she wanted only two.
   ``Two is okay,'' Baasay said. ``The times are different, the
family is different. Young women don't want many children.''

<HEAD>Familiar Faces In Two New Shows, Including Carol Burnett</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This has been a season in which many new shows
gave bush league a bad name. But miracles do occur, like CBS'
``Bagdad Cafe,'' premiering tonight, and a Saturday preview of
NBC's ``Carol &amp; Co.''
   CBS' show, a situation comedy, co-stars Whoopi Goldberg and Jean
Stapleton.
   NBC's effort, which will get a regular Saturday slot, is
anthology comedy, a series of different shows performed by Carol
Burnett and a talented troupe.
   Each debut episode is excellent in its own way, particularly
``Carol &amp; Co.,'' which has the different kind of look and feel a
network needs to battle the diverse wares offered by the
ever-growing cable TV monster.
   ``Bagdad Cafe,'' adapted from the 1988 movie of the same name,
is by no means revolutionary.
   But it is unique in that it's from the same network that this
year has given you ``Sydney,'' ``Normal Life,'' ``City,'' and ``His
&amp; Hers,'' all examples of how not to commit comedy.
   ``Bagdad'' shows how to do it right _ not with a string of
feeble one-liners, but with believeable characters, a fine cast and
the awareness that the best humor often has the edge of sadness to
it.
   At the show's start, Stapleton, the sweetly dense Mrs. Archie
Bunker of ``All In the Family,'' becoes somewhat of a middle-aged
waif when she can take no more of her husband's verbal abuse and
walks out on him.
   A small problem. She's in the middle of California's Mojave
Desert when she walks. Their car has broken down. But in time, she
wearily trudges into Goldberg's dingy, rundown cafe and motel,
located somewhere between desolation and hard times.
   In future episodes, she'll start working there, even though
tonight's episode indicates the place should be called Cafe Woe.
   Goldberg's philandering husband (Cleavon Little), caught while
attempting adultery, walks out on her. Her teen-aged daughter
(Monica Calhoun), takes up with a greasy-haired biker whose idea of
speech is to grunt.
   There are problems, too, for her grown son (Scott Lawrence), a
decent guy and the father of a baby girl. His wife has run off,
leaving him to tend the tyke and help his mother.
   All this might be fodder for a situation tragedy. Instead, it's
a forum for gentle humor _ even with Goldberg's explosive style _
and compassion, both neatly illustrated when Stapleton notices that
Goldberg has been crying.
   Goldberg nods. ``I've been peeling a husband,'' she explains.
   These and other scenes are well-sketched and well-played, with
nice little off-beat touches here and there _ like the son playing
classical music on an ancient upright piano in the cafe or the
lecherous old cowboy who introduces himself to Stapleton thusly:
   ``My name is Rudy. I'm from Hollywood.''
   Written by Mort Lachman and Sy Rosen, this is the kind of show
that's both interesting and easy to like.
   So is the debut Saturday of Carol Burnett as an NBC regular
after her long, successful stay at CBS as the star of an hour
series famed for its comedy sketches.
   In ``Carol &amp; Co.,'' which starts with a chap giving her roses
and saying, deadpan, ``Welcome back, Nancy,'' she greets the studio
audience and explains the premise of the evening's story.
   In tonight's case, she is a perfect, loving wife who discovers
that her overbearing husband, Paul (Richard Kind), is cheating on
her for the third time.
   She decides to have him bumped off after a neighbor, a young
widow, explains that's what she did, as did another new widow down
the block.
   The idea is to make it look like an accident. With that
established, Darrel Campbell's script proceeds toward daft doom,
namely a Murder Inc. operation lurking in the phone book as Hit
Parade Parties.
   The company offers a wide range of fatal services, among them
Midnight Grenade and A Floozy With An Uzi. ``I just don't know,''
Burnett sighs to the salesman who comes calling. ``Paul is so hard
to shop for.''
   It gets sillier, yet each plot twist is turned with precision
and generally acted straight, which makes things funnier than if
the players were called on to ham it up a bit or even mug.
   The players working with Burnett are first-rate. In addition to
Kind, they are Terry Kiser, Meagan Fay, Anita Barone and Jeremy
Piven. Alas, NBC's press release on the show specifies only the
role Kind plays.
   On the bright side, ``Burnett &amp; Co.'' definitely will be on NBC
on coming Saturday nights. True, that isn't the best of all nights.
It's when the fewest viewers watch network programs, generally
speaking.
   But those who do tune in for Burnett's return to weekly TV will
find a well-written, solidly professional show. As the trombonist
said when he missed his bus, I rest my case.

   Elsewhere in television ...
   HO-HO HISTORICAL NOTE: ``60 Minutes'' may have Andy Rooney, The
Beleagured Humorist. But humor of a different kind _ reruns and new
stuff _ is afoot Sunday from cable TV's ``HA! The TV Comedy
Network.''
   The newcomer will start at 7 p.m. EDT, which by sheer
coincidence is when CBS' durable news show begins. The first
``HA!'' offering is a ``Saturday Night Live'' repeat featuring
Eddie Murphy. The night's only first-run show is ``The Big Room,''
featuring Mort Sahl.
   ``HA!'' will bring to two the number of 24-hour chuckles
channels in cable, the other being The Comedy Channel begun last
fall. Whether there's room enough for two has yet to be decided by
viewers and cable system operators.

<HEAD>World Events Prompt Curriculum Changes at Military Colleges</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD PYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEWPORT, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Sweeping changes in the world political
order and localized conflicts such as Panama and the Persian Gulf
are prompting swift, wholesale revision of the lessons being taught
at America's advanced military colleges.
   At the Naval War College, the nation's oldest such institution,
officials say 98 of the 145 readings assigned to students last fall
no longer are on the list for the third trimester that began this
month.
   ``That's just one measure of the changes that are taking
place,'' said William E. Turcotte, a former naval officer who heads
the school's National Security Decision Making Department and is a
key planner of its curriculum.
   As the morning fog rolls in from Narragansett Bay, the 360
students at the NWC are focusing their attention on
``contingencies'' _ military scenarios involving U.S. forces in a
role far more constricted, and less predictable, than the
NATO-Warsaw Pact showdown that has been the basis of military
doctrine for 40 years.
   Increasingly, say officials of the college, their curriculum and
war gaming will stress urban warfare, terrorism and ``low
intensity'' crises in which the United States' interests are
ambiguous and its capacity to act is affected by special political
or geographical factors.
   Students also will be asked to consider monetary costs, a factor
the officials say has not figured significantly in classroom
discussions before.
   The cost of military operations is one of many questions that
must be examined in a new light, Turcotte said.
   ``This year will be especially traumatic for the students, but
it's also a great time for the students, a very dynamic period in
which they will be as close to the problems as the major policy
advisers, the Congress and the press,' he said.
   Turcotte also said that for the school's faculty experts, the
supposed end of the Cold War is doing much more than simply
altering their lesson plans.
   ``Never have we spent so much time trying to learn for ourselves
what's happening,'' he said. ``But it is the most exciting time
that I've ever been in the classroom here.''
   The Naval War College, founded in 1884 in this picturesque
seaport famed as a summer resort of the superrich, is one of a
half-dozen colleges run by the Defense Department to provide
advanced schooling in military and political subjects for career
officers, government officials and other selected individuals,
including military officers from other countries.
   While each school is mainly concerned with the mission of one
branch of the armed forces, the Pentagon's policy of ``jointness''
in military affairs means faculty and students are drawn from all
services.
   Thus a typical NWC seminar of 15 to 20 students might be led by
a civilian or an Army officer, and include officers from the Navy,
Army, Air Force, Marines and Coast Guard.
   Turcotte, who has taught at the NWC since 1974, said curriculum
changes reflecting political upheavals in the Soviet bloc actually
began last summer, and the first trimester ended just as the Berlin
Wall was starting to crumble in November.
   In place of the Cold War doctrines spawned by four decades of
tension between the two superpowers, the revised program will
concentrate on the types of crises that might now arise and how
U.S. strategy and forces should be designed to deal with them.
   ``In any contingency we are most likely to have the preponderant
force, but the objectives are confusing,'' said Turcotte. ``We will
win, but the nature of how we win and what we leave behind is
complex. There are a lot of dark alleys in contingencies.''
   Among new issues to be examined, he said, are such questions as
whether smaller countries, freed from superpower influence, become
less stable and more aggressive toward their neighbors, and whether
the United States can or should continue to press Japan and Germany
to spend more on self-defense as Washington cuts its military costs
and the two Germanys draw closer together.
   The Persian Gulf, where the Navy conducted a major operation in
1987-88 to safeguard commercial shipping endangered by the
Iraq-Iran war, offers an important case study: a regional conflict
in which the United States is not directly involved, but has
crucial interests to protect.
   Another model for the classroom was provided by the Bush
administration's invasion of Panama, which NWC officials said
raised not only political issues but moral and practical questions
about the conduct of urban warfare in which civilian lives are at
risk.
   They also cite the proliferation of missiles and other modern
technology, possibly even nuclear weapons, among smaller nations,
the question of whether U.S. military forces should be used in drug
interdiction, and the lack of an effective policy on terrorism and
hostage-taking.
   Turcotte said the changes in Europe have led NATO to extend its
presumed warning time for a Soviet attack from several days to six
months, but might also increase the relative importance of
strategic nuclear forces, which remain in place, and Moscow's
internal security forces.

   From King Kong's banana breath to E.T. From
Jaws to the 1906 San Francisco earthquake.
   Universal Studios is arriving in Orlando like gangbusters to
compete with the oldest established entertainment show in town.
   The $600 million Universal Studios Florida, based on some of
Hollywood's great movies, goes public in May, exactly a year after
the Disney-MGM Studios theme park opened for business a few miles
down the road.
   ``Come to Universal and ride the movies,'' says Steven
Spielberg, the bearded movie genius acting as creative consultant
for the 440-acre attraction.
   Company executives speak in terms of waging war against Walt
Disney World for the hearts, minds and pocketbooks of the millions
of tourists who will be dividing their attention between the
competing studio theme parks.
   ``I think they're very vulnerable,'' says Jay Stein, an MCA vice
president, about the Disney-MGM Studios.
   ``It IS a little like war. It means that when you invade you
make damn sure that your army is big enough and strong enough to
win.''
   The Florida attraction is a bigger, modernized version of
Universal's studio tour in California and is owned jointly by MCA
Inc. and the Rank Organization of London. Stein is president of the
division that created and built the park, MCA Recreation Services.
   Company officials say the key differences between their park and
Disney's is Universal's more sophisticated technology and its
``full-fledged involvement of the customer'' in each of the 15
attractions. They speak of ``super-realistic technology'' providing
``wrap-around experiences'' for young and old.
   In a blunt attack on the competition, Stein said in a recent
interview that ``what the Disney-MGM Studios are offering their
guests is approximately one-third of what we're offering. ...
Across the board, we're going to deliver a more impressive
entertainment experience.''
   Stein acknowledged, however, that the Disney organization was
``a strong, well-financed company with a marketing potential that
is intimidating at worst.''
   Because of that, he said, Universal ``needs to create and
deliver an entertainment experience that is so different and
superior that we can assure ourselves that we're going to capture
enough segments of the market to make this thing profitable.''
   Stein and MCA President Sid Sheinberg have for years disputed
Disney Chairman Michael Eisner's claims that the Disney-MGM Studios
theme park is the realization of Walt Disney's ideas from 50 years
ago.
   Stein and Sheinberg contend that Disney copied the concept from
Universal's Studio Tour, which has been in operation in the
Hollywood area since 1964, and that Eisner rushed into construction
to beat Universal into Florida.
   Eisner and other Disney officials usually soft-pedal the
criticism and the rivalry, insisting that the competition is good
for each other as well as Florida.
   Besides the theme park attractions, Universal Studios Florida
has the largest movie and television production area outside
Hollywood. It has three times the amount of sound-stage space that
Disney has.
   Production has been under way since 1988.
   Scheduled to go before the cameras this year, studio executives
say, are 13 feature films and 500 television episodes.
   The back lot tour includes 50 locations, including famed
Hollywood Boulevard, a New England Village, the San Francisco Wharf
and New York's Penn Station. There are 40 restaurants and snack
shops, including Schwab's Drug Store, the Studio Commissary and
Mel's Diner from ``American Graffiti.''
   Also a part of the complex will be the first Hard Rock Cafe in
Florida.
   With Universal's long tradition of blending public participation
and filmmaking, the Florida park encourages superlatives:
   _ ``Kongfrontation'' pits a skyway tram containing 50 people
against the 37-foot tall, computer-animated gorilla in what is
billed as the largest sound stage in the world. King Kong will be
so real that visitors will be able to smell his banana breath. The
six-story King Kong building has 50 facades modeled after midtown
Manhattan.
   _ In ``Jaws,'' a 24-foot-long, computerized shark weighing three
tons crunches its jaws onto a 40-passenger boat on 7-acre Amity
Bay, rocking the craft in both directions before the shark is
``killed.''
   _ A subway train carrying 200 guests into a San Francisco
station is buffetted by an ``earthquake,'' a re-creation of the
1906 San Francisco temblor that measured 8.3 on the Richter scale.
Trains crash into each other, the overhead roadway comes tumbling
down and 60,000 gallons of water flood the scene.
   _ ``Ghostbusters'' is a re-creation of the largest set ever
built on a Hollywood sound stage: eight-stories high. The action is
a special effects thriller, with 13 larger-than-life mechanical
ghosts getting zapped by Neutrana Wand beams until their
ectoplasmic energy explodes.
   _ Spielberg's pet project, ``E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial,'' is a
soaring, obstacle-filled adventure on a dirt bike. It starts with a
chase through a forest and takes the visitor all the way to E.T.'s
home, the Green Planet.
   The movie-themed rides and participatory attractions include a
high-speed chase inside the world of Hanna-Barbera cartoons, a
``Phantom of the Opera'' horror make-up show and visitor input into
Alfred Hitchcock's stylized thrillers.
   And so it goes, one ``funtastic'' happening after another in the
park that officials say will take visitors two days to cover fully.
   Universal plans a ``soft opening'' in early May. The official
grand opening is June 7, with Spielberg and a collection of
Hollywood stars presiding.
   Spielberg, who dreamed up ``E.T.,'' ``Jaws'' and other film
fantasies, calls his job as creative consultant a storyteller's
dream come true.
   ``We've made the movie experience something that fans can see,
feel, touch and smell,'' he says.
   The park's most ambitious undertaking, ``Back to the Future,''
will not be ready for the park's opening.
   It will have two adjacent theaters, each measuring 80 feet in
diameter, and use projected images along with complex motion
simulators topped with Delorean automobiles. Visitors will ride 12
of the cars in each dome as they go crashing through the centuries
with the mad scientist Doc Brown.
   Because of the complex technology, it is taking longer to build
than originally contemplated, said its inventor, Peter Alexander,
vice president of shows and rides for MCA's Recreational Services
Group.
   ``It's probably the most responsive and complex motion simulator
ever built,'' said Alexander.
   Nickelodeon, the TV network for kids, celebrated its 10th
birthday in March by beginning construction of a new home at the
Orlando park.
   The Nickelodeon production complex will consist of two sound
stages and an interactive entertainment area for children. It will
produce shows here throughout the year, and visitors to the park
will be able to audition for shows as well as to view production,
video, audio and control room operations.
   Universal expects to draw at least 5 million people in its first
year, and Stein and other officials say those who see will become
``instant converts'' passing the word on to others.
   ``We're going to be the new kid on the block, and people are
going to give us a try,'' he said. ``And we're going to deliver.''

<HEAD>Democrats Struggle To Find Common Voice</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Democrats used to dine out on the old Will
Rogers wisecrack: ``I belong to no organized party _ I am a
Democrat.''
   The joke doesn't fit these days. Democrats are organizing all
over the place, choosing up sides and lining up in factions and
caucuses. But they can't get together on policy or on spokesmen to
carry it to the voters. Their congressional majorities seem
immobilized more often by intramural disputes than Republican
opposition.
   Theirs always has been a fractious coalition; that's what Rogers
was joking about. But they usually found ways to glue it together
at campaign time. Sometimes they kept warring; then they lost.
   What's happening now is not so dramatic or clearly defined as
the old battles over civil rights or the escalation of America's
involvement in the war in Vietnam. In confrontations like those,
Democrats acknowledged their unyielding differences on one point,
bargained over them, then quietly collaborated on other matters.
   Their differences now are more mundane, and the handling is more
businesslike. That won't necessarily make them easier to bridge.
   The situation is a mirror image of the one Republicans faced 25
years ago, out of power, lacking a pulpit and a spokesman. They
dealt with it by creating the awkwardly-named, soon-to-be-forgotten
Republican Coordinating Committee, a panel of party leaders
convened periodically to issue policy pronouncements.
   The better-known voices of the GOP came from Congress, in
regular joint appearances by Sen. Everett M. Dirksen of Illinois,
the minority leader, and his House counterparts. That became the Ev
and Jerry Show, when Rep. Gerald R. Ford of Michigan was the House
leader. It featured a Senate showman and a House straight man.
   Congress is short on showmen these days. The Democrats' leaders,
Sen. George J. Mitchell of Maine and House Speaker Thomas S. Foley
of Washington, tend to business, work together, but usually speak
separately. They tried a joint appearance before the television
cameras late last year, but it didn't click.
   Ev and Jerry had one clear advantage over George and Tom. The
speaker and the majority leader have to make Congress run. Minority
leaders don't.
   But in a divided government, Congress is the Democratic branch,
and could become the platform for opposition initiatives and
rebuttals to President Bush. So far, that's been done as a series
of solos, with no clear message or voice.
   That tendency was underlined last weekend by conflicting
schedules that put the Democratic National Committee in
Indianapolis at the same time the Democratic Leadership Council was
holding a conference in New Orleans.
   The national committee is dominated by state party leaders; the
leadership council is an organization set up five years ago by
moderate and conservative Democrats seeking to pull the party
toward the center.
   After three months of congressional hedging, the national
committee endorsed Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan's bill to cut
Social Security taxes, so as to bar government use of surpluses
they produce to offset deficit spending on current programs.
   ``The Democratic National Committee can do exactly what it
wants,'' said Rep. Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House
majority leader. ``They are not in the Congress and they don't have
the responsibility to actually produce a budget.''
   So much for consensus on what would seem a popular, salable
Democratic proposition: cutting a payroll tax. The Moynihan measure
used to make the White House nervous because the Democrats could
have used it to force Bush into vetoing an election-year tax cut.
That prospect has faded.
   Organized into their rival caucuses and umbrella groups,
sometimes with competing agendas, the Democrats show no sign of
progress toward finding their voice.
   Gephardt insists that they are the ones coming up with ideas for
national leadership, even if the message is not coming through that
way.
   In the familiar lament of the party out of White House power, he
said that is because the president is the dominant player, the only
leader who can push a program to national acceptance and block
congressional moves with vetoes that one-third minorities in either
house can sustain.
   ``He has a pen in his pocket that's worth two-thirds of us,''
Gephardt said.

   The cops raced up the subway station stairs,
looking for two men who'd robbed a passenger at knife point. They
wheeled into the park and almost bumped into a girl holding out a
plastic bag of crack.
   ``Her jaw dropped,'' said Officer William Smith. ``And my jaw
dropped.''
   She was just a child, all baby face and wide eyes. Then she
opened her mouth.
   ``She called us every name you can think of,'' Smith said.
   Jeanette, at 12, was carrying a beeper and 20 vials of crack.
Twelve days before Christmas, in the middle of Herald Square, she
became one of three dozen boys and girls her age arrested last year
on felony narcotics charges.
   Jeanette also was not the first in her family arrested in
connection with crack. A year earlier her mother, known on the
street as Miss Candy, was arrested at the same spot; police said
they found 430 vials of crack inside her brassiere.
   Now, they say, she has someone else to hold her wares: her kids.
   Jeanette _ The Associated Press agreed to a judge's request not
to divulge her last name in return for access to Family Court
hearings _ turned heads in the prosecutor's office. But more and
more children are entering the lower levels of the cocaine business
as touts, lookouts, runners, holders and dealers.
   In the first 10 months of 1989, New York City police arrested
1,330 children 15 and younger on felony narcotics charges, a 20
percent increase over 1988 and a 530 percent increase over 1983,
when the crack epidemic was just emerging.
   Nationally, according to the FBI, arrests of children 16 and
younger for dealing in cocaine or heroin have risen 900 percent in
five years.
   To a drug dealer, a child can seem the perfect employee:
inconspicuous, loyal and _ perhaps their chief attraction _ almost
immune.
   Children are overlooked by officers who can't believe the kid in
braids on the corner is a drug courier. If arrested, children go
free faster than adults; if convicted, they are less seriously
punished. In one crucial sense, children are more reliable: they
are less apt than older teens to use crack.
   The kids are rewarded with danger, long hours and irregular
wages. Terry Williams, a sociologist who has studied the crack
trade in New York, says big payoffs are a myth; children are
attracted, he said, because legitimate opportunities are so limited.
   The crack kids don't get rich; they just get hard. ``When you
read `12 years old' in a newspaper, that sounds young,'' said
Officer Thomas McHale, who patrols the area where Jeanette was
arrested. ``But these kids are 30-year-olds.''
   Jeanette's mother says she was herself a crack addict. She
doesn't admit to dealing but says that ``in the world of survival,
anything is possible. ... I've had to do a lot of things in my life
to make ends meet.''
   She is a big woman _ almost 6 feet tall, well over 200 pounds.
Her hair is pulled back in a neat bun. In conversation she is
articulate, forceful and intelligent.
   Jeanette is hefty, too. She has smooth chocolate-colored skin,
large brown eyes and short, curly brown hair. At a recent court
appearance, one tuft protruded from under her knit hat, sticking
out over her forehead.
   Her lawyer, a young public defender, declined requests for an
interview with Jeanette, who five weeks ago was found guilty of
crack possession and faces confinement to an institution for up to
18 months.
   Her mother told the family's story.
   The mother was born 34 years ago in Harlem. Her own mother
wasn't around much, so her father placed the kids in foster care.
She had her first child when she was 15. A year later she married a
man who was not the child's father. They had four children but
divorced after he infected her with a venereal disease and she
caught him with another woman.
   Besides Jeanette, her children are Keesha, 18, who has one child
and is expecting another; Edward, 16, who has been arrested several
times on drug-selling charges; Jalanda, 11, who has stayed out of
trouble, and Rasheen, 10, who has one robbery arrest.
   About five years ago the family was evicted from a Brooklyn
housing project for not paying rent. They wound up at the
Martinique Hotel, the city's most notorious welfare hotel.
   Built in 1897, the Martinique was a massive essay in French
Renaissance elegance. By the time the family moved in, it fugee camp. Roaches
roamed the rooms, pimps, pushers and
muggers the hallways.
   The children of the Martiniwas an
urban reque literally played in traffic. Some
imitated drug dealers in their games. Some went further.
   ``Children never recover from an environment like that,'' the
mother said. ``My kids sort of went astray. ... Jeanette got in
with a bad crowd at the hotel.''
   The family was crammed into two rooms. Outside the only place to
gather was Greeley Park, a concrete and asphalt triangle in the
middle of bustling Herald Square.
   On Aug. 6, 1988, the mother said, she was sitting on a bench
with her boyfriend, handing out bags of potato chips to
neighborhood kids. The four officers who arrested and searched her
found a black, zippered pouch in her bra, crammed with 430 vials of
crack.
   Despite the amount of crack seizof a hard-line Shiite Moslem cleric
who is the leader of
pro-Iranian militants holding Western hostages, witnesses said.
   The witnesses spoke on condition of anonymity for reasons of
personal safety. They said Sheik Subhi Tofaili, Secetary-General of
Hezbollah, was not hurt in the attack in south Beirut. His car was
riddled with bullets, the witnesses said.
   The motive of the attack was not immediately clear. It was not
known if it was related to the 18 Western hostages held in Lebanon.
   Most of them are believed held by factions linked to Hezbollah
and imprisoned in hideouts in the southern slums, Hezbollah's main
stronghold.
   Tofaili's convoy came under fire at 2:50 p.m. as the clergyman
was heading for a mosque in the Bourj el-Barajneh shantytown.
   Witnesses said Tofaili's bodyguards engaged the Syrians in a
firefight. Hundreds of people ran for cover as dozens of Hezbollah
gunmen took to the streets.
   The witnesses spoke by telephone from buildings overlooking the
scene of the clash.
   Police confirmed there was shooting for four hours in Bourj
el-Barajneh, where a sprawling Palestinian refugee camp is located.
   They said four civilians were wounded before the gunfire tapered
off at nightfall. They did not say who was involved in the fighting.
   The Syrians have lately tightened a ring around the southern
slums to prevent the kidnappers from smuggling the hostages out.
   A police spokesman, who cannot be named under standing
regulations, said the Syrians were ``even stopping funeral
processions and searching coffins'' in southern districts of the
city.
   The shootout flared hours after Iran's president, Hashemi
Rafsanjani, was reported to have sent his brother to Lebanon in a
fresh effort to win the hostages' release.
   Beirut's conservative ad-Diyar daily said Mahmoud Hashemi, whom
Rafsanjani has frequently used on sensitive missions, slipped
quietly into Lebanon last week for an unannounced visit.
   The newspaper said Hashemi, a deputy foreign minister in charge
of affairs with Lebanon, Syria and other Arab countries, met some
Hezbollah leaders before leaving Tuesday.
   They included Hussein Mousawi, leader of the Islamic Amal
movement based in the Bekaa Valley of east Lebanon's Bekaa valley.
His group forms Hezbollah's pro-Syrian wing.
   The hostages include eight Americans. The longest held is Terry
Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press.
He was kidnapped in Beirut March 16, 1985. Several other hostages
have been held almost as long.
   A spokesman at the Iranian Embassy in Beirut refused comment on
the newspaper report.
   President Rafsanjani, leader of Iran's so-called pragmatists,
seeks to improve links with the West. But he is opposed by
anti-Western Iranian radicals.
   In Damascus, the Syrian capital, Foreign Minister Farouk
al-Sharaa met Anglican Bishop John Brown on Thursday to discuss
efforts to free the hostages.
   ``I'm concerned about all the hostages, especially Brian Keenan,
who's a member of the Church of Ireland,'' Brown said after his
50-minute meeting with Sharaa.
   Keenan, 39, an English teacher at the American University of
Beirut who holds dual British and Irish nationality, marks his
fourth year as a hostage April 11.
   Brown would not make any statements about his talks but said he
was optimistic the captives will eventually be freed.
   Sharaa refused comment.
   Elsewhere, Gen. Michel Aoun's troops and Christian warlord Samir
Geagea's Lebanese Forces militiamen exchanged artillery fire north
of Beirut Thursday, straining a 26-day-old cease-fire.
   Police said 155mm howitzers, multi-barreled rocket launchers and
tank cannon were used in the sporadic exchanges that broke out
before dawn and continued through mid-morning.
   No casualties were reported. The rival Christian forces are
fighting for control of Lebanon's Christian enclave.

   At a hearing in Family Court, Jeanette admitted she had a bag
with crack that night but said it was given her by a neighborhood
boy named Sean. ``He didn't say (what was in) the bag. He just
asked me to take it to Brooklyn for him.''
   The judge who convicted Jeanette described her story as
``incredible.'' Smith says he saw Jeanette near the park about 10
days after her arrest _ at 1:30 in the morning. ``She just smiled
at me and said hello. I didn't know what to say.''
   The mother blames the Martinique period for Jeanette's run-ins
with the law and, notwithstanding the girl's arrest, maintains her
daughter has been better behaved since the family moved. She says
Jeanette regularly attends junior high school, where she does well
in reading but needs work in math. Other than that, she stays home
and helps care for the younger children.
   ``Jeanette loves the house,'' the mother said. ``She doesn't
like to jump, to go out. ... She loves singing. She's always wanted
to write rap music.''
   The mother was standing on the street, next to her boyfriend's
car. As she spoke, Jeanette looked on silently, occasionally
nodding in agreement. Finally, bored, she slapped a cassette into
the car tape deck, closed her eyes and moved to the rhythms of rap.
   When police are told the mother's story, they laugh.
   ``She's running the park'' _ controlling crack sales there, said
McHale. He said he hadn't seen her at night in several months, but
was told she now has youngsters, including some of her own, doing
most of the street dealing.
   The family continues to visit Herald Square, even though they
now live almost an hour's subway ride away, even though they
complain of police harassment.
   The mother said they return because they know the shops and the
people; Smith says it's because ``they know the neighborhood and
the customers. That's their turf.''

<DATELINE>NORTH CREEK, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For this time of year, it was a
deceptively warm day. Tall pines and hemlocks reached for a
cloudless sky. Big, thick-coated dogs sprawled along dusty roads.
Locals walked to lunch in shirtsleeves.
   But breaking through the still mountain air was the rhythmic
thwack of hammers, the whine of drills, the beep of heavy equipment
backing up and the roar of bulldozers.
   In North Creek these days, modern ``townhouse communities'' seem
to sprout from the mountainsides more thickly than wildflowers, and
a developer is reshaping two blocks that make up nearly half of the
business district in this tiny Adirondack village.
   This kind of development has environmentalists worried about the
future of the Adirondack Park, a 6 million-acre tract of forest and
mountains bigger than any other state or national park in the lower
48 states.
   But it also represents the kind of economic revitalization that
some North Creek natives, like restaurant owner Francis Smith, have
been waiting for. Smith's Restaurant, a pine-paneled coffee shop
and tavern, has been in his family since the early 1920s.
   ``I'm a businessman, so to me the development is a good thing,''
said Smith, sitting in a worn red vinyl-padded booth. ``On the
other hand, there seems to be just too much construction going on.
Maybe it's going overboard.''
   How much is too much is on the minds of many in the Adirondack
Park, a vast patchwork of private and public land, much of the
latter guaranteed by the state constitution to remain ``forever
wild.''
   The state regulates all new development in the park through a
21-year-old land-use plan. Its provisions have made for plenty of
strife among those wanting to protect the park's undeniable beauty,
those trying to make a living and a home within its boundaries, and
those looking to make money exploiting its riches.
   With the 20th anniversary of Earth Day just three weeks away,
the battle over land use in the 98-year-old park has flared in
anticipation of a report, to be presented to Gov. Mario Cuomo on
Sunday, from the Commission on the Adirondacks in the 21st Century.
   Cuomo cited increasing property values, development and land
speculation last year when he appointed the commission to help map
the park's future.
   In 1969, a similar commission appointed by then-Gov. Nelson
Rockefeller devised what was at the time considered a bold plan to
control development seen as a threat to the Adirondack wilderness.
   Of the park's 3.5 million acres of private land, 53 percent was
restricted to having just one house for each 43 acres. Home sites
of 7{ acres were mandated for an additional 35 percent. The
remaining 12 percent of private land fell into six various use
categories.
   The plan slowed development immediately but bred contempt among
many local residents, officials and developers. The next several
years were a time of angry words, broken windows, slashed tires and
punches. Mounds of animal waste were delivered to the Adirondack
Park Agency, the state body set up in 1973 to regulate development.
   Bad feelings are welling again as many Adirondack people
anticipate the Cuomo commission will recommend even stricter land
use controls.
   ``When these people were picked (for the commission) we knew
their position,'' said Francis Casier, a 71-year-old Saranac Lake
builder.
   ``The state has designated 1.5 million acres as wetlands for
grasses and bugs, but only a few thousand acres for human beings,''
he said. ``The highest and best use for our land should be for
homes and amenities for people and their families.''
   Development would bring jobs and money to a region where ``the
quality of life is great, as long as you don't need to spend any
money,'' said Barbara Delczeg, who works for the Gore Mountain
Region Chamber of Commerce.
   The per capita income of the 130,000 park residents is just 72
percent of the state average. It's about 94 percent of the average
for the state's rural counties.
   ``We need this growth so much,'' said Delczeg. ``We need the
jobs, we need the money. We need it to survive.''
   North Creek isn't the only place ringing with the sounds of
development and dissent.
   In Lake Placid, a developer wants to rebuild the Lake Placid
Club, a rambling, turn-of-the-century hotel that is on the National
Register of Historic Places but has fallen into disrepair. But the
development would include hundreds of luxurious second homes and a
golf course.
   ``We're seeing increased development pressure everywhere,'' said
Eric Siy of the Adirondack Council, a regional environmental group.
``If we don't act now, we may not have a park by the year 2000.''
   The Adirondack Council advocates a two-year building moratorium
in much of the park, as well as major additions to the park's
wilderness and wild forest areas. They say developers, fearful
about the Cuomo commission recommendations, are rushing to build
while they still can.
   Development and subdivision applications submitted to the
Adirondack Park Agency will rise by 75 percent, from 631 in 1989 to
about 1,100 this year, agency Executive Director Robert Glennon
predicts.
   The commission itself, in an interim newsletter, gave a strong
indication that tighter controls might be in the cards.
   ``Controls once seen as daring and stringent are now considered
weak and ineffective,'' the newsletter said. ``Environmental
policies and laws once heralded as being on the cutting edge of
environmental protection now seem outdated.''
   George Davis, executive director of the Cuomo commission, helped
create the current Adirondack land-use map while working for the
Rockefeller commission. Davis said the original plan failed to
foresee that wealthy city dwellers in the 1990s would be able to
afford ``little mini-wildernesses'' _ 50-acre building lots for
second homes that fit the land-use restrictions.
   Like Davis, Casier has noted the impact of rich second-home
owners. ``People come in from the city and they want their little
piece (of the Adirondacks),'' said the developer. ``The minute they
get their little piece, they don't want anyone else to have a
little piece.''
   But he regards George Davis as ``an enemy of Adirondack
people.'' The lot-size limitations have made it almost impossible
to build affordable housing in the region, Casier said.
   To keep things affordable and save jobs, some environmentalists
are concentrating less on halting development and more on
persuading officials to expand the state easement acquisition
program. Under this, the state buys development and recreation
rights to a parcel of land, but the property owner keeps title and
can use the land for timber production.
   The easements, cheaper than buying the land outright, also give
the state more for its money, said Neil Woodworth of the Adirondack
Mountain Club. And, he noted, even when loggers are finished with
the land, the state will control the development rights.
   ``A lot of the land we need to preserve, to protect from
development, is also land critical to the forest products industry
and provides an awful lot of jobs,'' Woodworth said. ``So
(preservationists) can't just buy it all up.''

   It once was known as the Fortune 500
drugmaker that soothed millions of throats with Robitussin cough
syrup, coated dried lips with Chap Stick balm and gave generously
to charities and higher education.
   Today, A.H. Robins still makes those products and other
remedies, but it's owned by another company after a long bout with
bankruptcy court.
   To many women, its name now is more synonymous with cruel
stinginess, all tied to one of the most notorious products ever
sold, the Dalkon Shield birth control device.
   The family that formerly ran the company still has considerable
wealth but keeps a low profile, partly because of the furor over
the Dalkon Shield. The device, which maimed thousands of women in
one of the nation's worst product liability cases, is no longer
sold.
   As the leading family member said when he surrendered the
company late last year, ``Some of the unhappiest people I've known
are people who have a lot of money.''
   The surrender was one of the most traumatic moments in the life
of E. Claiborne Robins, a millionaire whose grandfather, Albert
Hartley Robins, founded the company as a three-employee apothecary
shop.
   E. Claiborne Robins took over the business in 1933, parlaying it
through hard work into one of the largest U.S. pharmaceutical
companies.
   As the business prospered, Robins and his relatives became known
for their philanthropy, with gifts to the University of Richmond.
Its graduates include Robins, 79, and his son, E. Claiborne Robins
Jr., 46.
   The senior Robins and other members have donated millions of
dollars to the university, including $50 million in 1969 that at
the time was the largest personal gift ever made to a private U.S.
college.
   Women seeking payment for Dalkon Shield injuries have a
different view of the Robins' largesse. Many argue that despite
immense public and legal pressure, the company erected obstacle
after obstacle to prevent them from receiving compensation.
   Earlier this month, 85,000 Dalkon Shield claimants, the last of
the 200,000 eligible for redress, were mailed packets explaining
options for receiving payment for injuries. Some had used the
device more than 15 years ago.
   ``They made it very difficult for the women they injured to get
compensation,'' said Linda Hightower, director of the Dalkon Shield
Victims Association in Atlanta and herself a former Dalkon Shield
user.
   In the users' eyes, Robins never has provided a simple, direct
public apology, not to mention a sympathetic attitude toward
compensation. E. Claiborne Robins has said he doesn't consider
money important and that any amount above what's needed to live
comfortably ``means nothing really.''
   Yet money, or the lack of it, has shaped his life.
   Two years after Robins was born in 1910, his father died,
leaving to his mother the responsibility of holding together the
family business founded in 1878.
   Robins worked his way through the University of Richmond by
stacking books at the city library for 25 cents an hour. He
graduated at the height of the Depression in 1931 and enrolled in
pharmacy school at the Medical College of Virginia, where he
graduated with honors in 1933.
   ``It was a case of financial necessity,'' he once said of
attending summer school to finish pharmacy college early.
   Later Robins borrowed $2,000 to take over the family business
and went on the road selling pharmaceuticals. His work and
salesmanship turned the company into a multimillion-dollar
enterprise by the time the Dalkon Shield was added to Robins'
product line in 1971.
   Before long, however, the corporation began hearing complaints
from doctors and women who used the IUD. Some users suffered
miscarriages; some became sterile. A few died.
   As concerns multiplied about the Dalkon Shield's safety, the
company yanked it off the market. That same year _ 1974 _ Robins
began to have health problems, suffering two heart attacks. He
stepped down the next year as president of the company, but stayed
on as board chairman.
   Both Robins and his son, who became the company's president in
1977, have refused numerous requests for interviews in recent years
as they watched a wave of lawsuits seeking damages from Dalkon
Shield injuries tear at the foundation of their business.
   In 1985, the company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy
reorganization. Last Dec. 15, the case ended, a $2.5 billion trust
fund was established to compensate Dalkon Shield claimants and A.H.
Robins was taken over by the American Home Products Corp. of New
York.
   Neither Robins has a role in the business anymore. Still, they
emerged from the 4{ years of bankruptcy proceedings with their
personal fortunes intact. Forbes magazine has reckoned the family
holdings are worth $325 million.
   Lawyers for Dalkon Shield users long have charged that the IUD
was rushed to market without adequate testing and that attempts
were made to mask its flaws.
   A federal judge once accused E.C. Jr. and two other company
executives of creating ``monstrous mischief'' with ``an instrument
of death, mutilation and disease.''
   ``You have taken the bottom line as your guiding beacon and the
low road as your route,'' U.S. District Judge Miles Lord of
Minneapolis said. ``This is corporate irresponsibility at its
meanest.''
   The Robinses and their aides never were charged with criminal
negligence in the Dalkon Shield case, and the younger Robins said
later that Lord had committed ``gross abuse of judicial discretion
and power.''
   Friends of the family are reluctant to talk about the father and
son, but some say privately that they were more distressed at
losing the company than at the high price of the Dalkon Shield
settlement.
   The men said in a joint farewell letter to employees that they
would remember ``shared times both difficult and rewarding. We have
been tested, and the results achieved in spite of those difficult
times are witness to what good people can accomplish.''
   The troubled history of the Dalkon Shield has affected what the
elder Robins once called the most satisfying accomplishments of his
career.
   ``One has been the joy of watching the company grow,'' he said.
``And there's the fact that you've made some contribution to public
health.''

   A doctor's recommendation that a young
patient wear a helmet while skateboarding or bicycling brought a
familiar rebuke.
   ``The mother was appalled by that recommendation,'' said
Stephanie Rifkinson-Mann, a pediatric neurosurgeon at Westchester
County Medical Center in Valhalla. ``She said wearing a helmet was
socially unacceptable among her son's friends because of the peer
pressure.''
   Rifkinson-Mann already was treating the boy for a head injury,
which would have been prevented if he'd worn a helmet in the first
place, she said.
   More parents might consider Rifkinson-Mann's recommendation.
Trauma, including head injury, is among the leading causes of death
in children under 14, said Samuel Kasoff, neurosurgeon at
Westchester County Medical Center.
   Many head injuries, such as ones suffered in school bus
accidents, could be avoided if the proper precautions are taken,
Rifkinson-Mann said.
   ``School buses don't often load children up appropriately,'' she
said. ``Usually they're two-by-two. In some cases they put them
three together. The kid in the middle is the least protected.''
   Making a child wear a helmet for some recreationl activities is
another way to prevent head injuries. Good-quality helmets can be
lightweight and not hamper movement, Rifkinson-Mann said.
   Rifkinson-Mann also would like to see better safety education
for children in schools. She suggests using a symbol children are
comfortable with, such as Big Bird, to educate youngsters on
accident prevention.
   Parents need education, too, she said.
   But it often takes a tragedy to make people aware of the high
incidence of head injury to children, she said.
   ``It's the gory part that piques people's interest,'' she said.
``Cancer is a generalized fear we all have. The only way to make
people know head injury is to be equally feared is to get the image
of how absolutely crippling it can be, especially to a young
child.''

   From the newly initiated quest to send people to
Mars to the decades-old search for a cure for cancer, the
government's science programs are a source of technological
breakthroughs and national pride. Federal spending on science is
far from the largest or fastest-growing part of the budget, but it
is a favorite target for budget-cutters. This is the first in a
series of articles this year that will track the progress of one
portion of the federal budget _ science spending.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When the White House's chief science adviser
visited the Senate Budget Committee recently, he spent much of his
time responding to a single, recurring complaint.
   The panel's chairman, Rep. James Sasser of Tennessee, said
costly projects such as the space station, $30 billion over several
years, short-change other researchers and science students in favor
of ``a high-visibility, high-media type operation.''
   The adviser, D. Allan Bromley, countered that the expensive
projects will benefit thousands of scientists and ``make possible
scientific understanding of the world, of our universe.''
   The dispute was left unresolved. But it sums up a growing
concern in today's era of relentless federal deficits: that a
burgeoning array of big-ticket science programs threatens to crowd
out a much larger number of less expensive but valuable efforts.
   As part of his proposed $1.2 trillion budget for next year,
President Bush wants to spend $68 billion on research and
development, or R&amp;D _ the studies and experimentation that are at
the core of science.
   Billions more, spread throughout the budget and not totaled,
would be spent for scientific work that has progressed beyond the
R&amp;D stage, such as the space shuttle.
   More than $4 billion would be devoted to five science projects
alone: the space station, a study of climatic change, missions to
the moon and Mars, a giant atom smasher called the superconducting
super collider, and a study of human genes.
   ``Investment in research and development is a top priority for
an administration that believes in investing in the future,''
Bush's budget request said.
   But with congressional work on the fiscal 1991 budget just
beginning, Sasser and many of his colleagues are questioning
whether the government can afford long-term costly initiatives that
threaten to become more expensive each year.
   ``Exploring and uncovering the mysteries of the universe stirs
us all,'' Sasser said. ``But I am afraid we are looking at the
stars right now from a rather deep fiscal hole.''
   Federal spending on science is not large relative to the rest of
the budget. For example, the military will take close to $300
billion this year.
   Nor are federal science expenditures growing at an alarming
rate, compared to other accounts. Adjusted for inflation, they are
barely larger than in the late 1960s. Medicaid spending, meanwhile,
is expected to grow by 15 percent, to $40 billion, this year alone.
   But the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law is forcing Congress
and the White House to find new sources of savings every year,
making science vulnerable.
   Large parts of the budget such as Social Security are too
politically sensitive to be cut dramatically. Nor can the $176
billion in this year's interest payments on the national debt be
cut without causing the government to default.
   Despite pressure to reduce deficits, many people argue that the
United States can't afford to eliminate large-scale science
programs.
   Supporters make the same arguments that were heard in 1957 after
the Soviets launched their Sputnik satellite: The United States
must remain at the forefront of technology, and not just for
economic reasons.
   ``This country had a goal and a dream when we went to the moon.
What this country is looking for now is goals and dreams,'' said
Robert Roe, D-N.J., chairman of the House Science, Space and
Technology Committee.
   ``One thing this country still has is an advantage in its
science and technology base,'' says Frank Press, president of the
National Academy of Sciences. ``From that point of view, the total
investment in science is justifiable.''
   But others worry about the trade-offs.
   ``Science is an unmet need, but it's competing against housing,
education, the human side of the ledger,'' says House Budget
Committee Chairman Leon Panetta, D-Calif.
   Still others complain that too many science spending decisions
are made by politicians interested primarily in jobs and other
economic rewards for their home districts.
   ``It's like everything else; people are getting re-elected by
delivering the bacon,'' says former Sen. William Proxmire, D-Wis.,
who until 1989 chaired the Senate Appropriations subcommittee that
oversees NASA spending.
   Congressional support for science is widespread, and rarely
breaks down along party lines. But to generalize, it has stronger
backing from conservatives than from liberals, who from time to
time try to shift some science spending into social programs.
   As with many areas of the budget, support for specific projects
tends to be strongest from those whose congressional committees
oversee the programs or whose districts will benefit from them.
Hence, Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, one of Congress' most fervent
advocates of spending cuts, strongly supports the costly super
collider because it is to be built in his state.
   Many who question federal support for expensive science programs
say they soak up money that would be better spent for small
projects that involve basic science. That work, often conducted by
individual researchers, involves a search for basic knowledge
regardless of its potential application.
   For example, they note that this year, for the first time in a
decade, the number of research awards by the National Institutes of
Health will fall below 5,000.
   Money also is scarce because of the way the government spends
its research and development money. Of the 1990 $64 billion total,
only $24 billion will be for civilian projects. Nearly two-thirds _
$40 billion _ will go to military work, largely weapons testing
with little or no application to the rest of the economy.
   Adding pressure are the peculiarities of the federal budget
process, which pits programs against each other.
   The budget committees will make recommendations for spending
levels that are politically influential but not legally binding.
The appropriations committees make the final decisions.
   Their subcommittees have jurisdiction over seemingly random
groupings of programs. It is at that level that dollars are
distributed among competing demands.
   Rep. Robert Traxler, D-Mich., chairs the appropriations
subcommittee that oversees NASA, the National Science Foundation,
housing, veterans and environmental programs.
   ``What am I supposed to do for science?'' he asked. ``Take money
from the homeless?''

   Jockeying for federal science dollars is
intensifying as demands increase, but the money available remains
roughly constant.
   When inflation is considered, the government spends barely more
for research and development today than it did at the height of the
Apollo moon program in the late 1960s.
   Adding to the competition is the sheer number of participants
involved in distribution and pursuit of science funding: dozens of
congressional committees and federal agencies, thousands of private
companies and institutions, and an estimated 5.3 million American
scientists and engineers.
   When World War II ended, the government was spending less than
$1 billion annually on research and development, most of it for
atomic weapons work. Spending grew slowly until the Soviets orbited
the Sputnik satellite in 1957, provoking concern about the
competitiveness of American science and sparking the growth of the
U.S. space program.
   As a result, government science spending grew well into the
1960s, leveling off during the Vietnam War. Dollar amounts
increased with the energy crisis of the late 1970s and President
Reagan's defense buildup of the 1980s, but spending adjusted for
inflation changed little.
   President Bush is proposing $68 billion in science spending for
the next fiscal year, up about $4 billion from this year.
   Translated into 1982 dollars to even out the effects of
inflation, the government will spend the equivalent of $48.2
billion this year for research and development _ barely more than
the $46 billion it spent in 1967.
   But nearly two-thirds of the spending goes for military
research, mainly on weapons, making the competition for civilian
research and development money even more intense.
   Again using 1982 dollars, the government will spend $18.1
billion on civilian research and development in 1990 _ less than
the $22.4 billion spent in 1966.
   Today, 26 House and Senate committees are involved in science
policy and spending. Ninety-six federal agencies and agency
subdivisions play a role in research and development, according to
the National Science Foundation.
   But just five agencies spend 95 percent of the money: the
Pentagon, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Energy
Department, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and
the National Science Foundation, which distributes grants and keeps
track of federal science efforts.
   In 1988, 15 agencies accounted for more than 99 percent of
federal academic support for science. They distributed money to
2,769 universities and colleges, 46 offices of academic systems
such as state university headquarters, and 717 non-profit,
independent institutions such as hospitals.
   To conduct its own scientific work, ranging from the study of
AIDS to development of high-speed trains, the government employs
218,000 scientists and engineers, according to the science
foundation.
   Some work at the more than 700 national laboratories the
government either operates directly or pays other institutions to
run. On the large end of the scale are the 8,400 employees at the
Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, N.M., and Livermore,
Calif. At the other extreme are the 16 workers at the Kodiak
National Laboratory in Kodiak, Alaska, where shellfish are studied.
   In his proposed 1991 budget, President Bush is pressing for
annual installments for a number of major scientific initiatives
that will take years to complete.
   Six of the biggest, and their projected overall costs, are:
   _A $3 billion effort to map human genes in an effort to treat
genetic diseases and advance agriculture, medicine and other fields.
   _The $8 billion super collider, a circular atom-smasher that
will measure 54 miles around, about to be built in Texas. It will
be the world's most expensive scientific instrument.
   _The so-called mission to planet Earth, involving NASA and other
agencies, to study global change at a cost of at least $20 billion
over 20 years.
   _The $30 billion space station, scheduled for construction in
the mid-1990s.
   _A return by astronauts to the moon in the 1990s and a manned
mission to Mars early in the next century, which NASA says could
cost $541 billion.
   _The aerospace plane, considered part of the moon-Mars effort
but which could be developed independently. It would take off and
land like a conventional airplane yet reach speeds above 4,000 mph.
If approved, construction of two aircraft would begin in 1993, take
four to five years and cost more than $5 billion.

<DATELINE>MORGANTOWN, W.Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. scientists are examining bits of
leg muscle removed from high-flying rats as part of a joint
NASA-Soviet experiment to determine how injured astronauts would
heal in a weightless environment.
   ``Our hypotheses go everywhere from disaster to normal
healing,'' said William Stauber, a physiologist at West Virginia
University Medical Center and one of two scientists conducting the
study.
   ``A disaster would be if the muscle healed but you got cancer or
just useless cells growing that wasted away,'' said Stauber. ``My
guess is the answer is somewhere in between.''
   Soviet researchers used forceps to crush the calf muscles of 10
specially bred rats from Czechoslavakia before placing them aboard
a Vostok spacecraft for nearly two weeks last September.
   ``The bruise was similar to something a batter would get if he
was hit by a pitched baseball at home plate,'' Stauber said. ``They
tried to make it equivalent to a real-world situation.''
   Within hours of the landing, researchers removed the rats' calf
muscles and froze them. Once in the United States, the muscle
samples were shipped to Stauber and Barry Festoff, a neurologist at
the Veteran's Administration Hospital in Kansas City, Mo.
   Festoff and Stauber are analyzing slides containing the red and
white tissue to trace the healing and regrowth of the rats' muscle
cells and nerve fibers.
   ``We're taking a look at the muscles themselves to see if they
are any different from the rats who suffered the same injury but
healed on Earth,'' Stauber said.
   He and Festoff brought Soviet officials up to date on their
research recently at a meeting at NASA's Ames Research Center in
Mountain View, Calif.
   ``Long-term space flight may cause deconditioning of the
cardio-vascular, musculoskeletal, blood and immune systems,'' A.S.
Kaplansky, who oversees the program for the Soviets, said through
an interpreter. ``It is of crucial importance to clarify mechanisms
underlying the changes and to develop effective countermeasures.''
   The study is expected to be completed this fall. The results
will be reviewed by Soviet scientists before the findings are
published.
   ``Our very preliminary data would seem to indicate that repair
after the crushing did not take place in the flight animals,'' said
Festoff.
   Stauber said researchers also hope to gain a better
understanding of how the human body reacts to heavy work in outer
space _ a critical consideration in light of a planned U.S. space
station.
   ``I think there is a fair amount of knowledge of what happens to
man if you're out there floating around for a long time, but we
really don't know what happens when you start doing hard physical
labor in space,'' Stauber said.
   Stauber said there may be ``occupational hazards that we don't
know about.'' It has been known for years that astronauts' muscles
atrophy during space flights, even relatively short ones.
   And overuse injuries caused by working in a weightless
environment are another concern, Stauber said.
   ``Behavior is going to be very different when we start working
in space,'' he said. ``Legs will become perching devices used to
push off and other light work while the upper body will be used
more.''
   The project is part of a long-standing agreement between the two
superpowers to collaborate on space research.
   ``It goes back to 1973 and the Nixon administration,'' said
Richard Grindeland, bio-specimen program manager for the Cosmos
program at Ames.
   ``We have collaborated on seven space flights since 1975 using
everything from guppies to monkeys,'' Grindeland said. ``It's been
an extremely good relationship, regardless of what the political
climate has been.''
   The experiments have included studies on the effect of space on
the brain, immunity, red blood cells, and the endocrine,
reproductive and digestive systems. The Soviets are committed to
participating in an American space flight slated for 1991, and the
United States is scheduled to take part in a Soviet flight in 1992.

<HEAD>Inventor Working on Garbage Shredder</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT IMRIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ASHLAND, Wis. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Russ Eide says the centrifuge machine he
built to mash garbage encompasses two basic scientific facts _
winds in a tornado can drive straw through a board and paper is
sharp enough to cut skin.
   Challeged with a dare, the 51-year-old inventor, who grew up
remodeling worn-out farm equipment, designed the Dynaforce garbage
processor, a $220,000 centrifuge that may help communities looking
to conserve landfill space.
   The machine is slightly larger than a pair of telephone booths
and uses the cutting edges of garbage itself to shred waste and
reduce its bulk by up to 80 percent.
   ``It is like a big washing machine,'' said Eide, owner of Light
Work Inc., based in Minneapolis.
   Eide, a former mechanic and a one-time auto parts store owner,
has worked on the LW 421 for six years, investing most of his life
savings.
   ``It can revolutionize the handling of a lot of things,'' said
Eide, his 6-foot-4, 250-pound frame circling his invention at the
Ashland landfill where it is being tested.
   A marketing company is hoping to soon sell 130 units to Toronto,
Canada, Eide said. Some cities in Ohio are looking at the machine.
Ashland is leasing one and allowing Eide to do more testing on it.
   Henry Simon, Ashland's director of public works, believes that
coupled with the city's mandatory recycling program, the processor
could prolong the life of the town's landfill from 7.5 years to 50
years.
   A market exists for the machine if Eide can develop conveyors
for moving the garbage in and out of the machine and a way to
detect heavy metals before they get dumped, Simon said.
   ``If he can deal with those two items, the machine is golden,''
he said.
   Sant Arora, a mechanical engineering professor at the University
of Minnesota in Minneapolis, and some of his students spent several
weeks studying Eide's invention and his theories about garbage
disposal.
   Arora said the machine's design is ``similar to old rock
crushers,'' a concept that hasn't been widely applied for shredding
garbage.
   Eide's basic theory is right, but more testing is needed, Arora
said.
   Bob Ham, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at
the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said he had no knowledge about
Eide's invention, but the concept was developed by a British
company years ago.
   ``Unfortunately in (the garbage-handling) business, there are a
lot of new companies that keep reinventing the wheel,'' Ham said.
   But Eide is undaunted, noting he has applied for two patents and
has refused offers for rights to the machine.
   Dumped into the top of the machine, garbage falls onto a series
of 1{-inch thick steel bars that spin at 850 revolutions per
minute, creating a tumbling action.
   ``Things are thrown against the wall. You get that constant
impact. If things are flying around in there, they are going to cut
things up,'' Eide said.
   Shredded garbage flies out of the machine, ready to be composted
or buried, Eide said.
   ``Do you smell anything here? A slight musty smell,'' he said,
sifting shredded garbage through his hands. ``When it goes through
this machine it practically deteriorates it.''
   The processor, driven by a 300-horsepower engine, can reduce 22,
55-gallon barrels of aluminum cans into one barrel of what looks
like shrapnel, Eide said.
   ``I did run a mattress in it. It shredded it up. It was gone
except for the wire,'' the inventor said.
   Eide said his idea started out as a dare over drinks.
   ``Somebody probably said it can't be done. You can't cut without
knives,'' he recalled. ``Having cut myself with paper, I knew how
sharp it was when you put in the right position.''
   Eide and his son built the first processor in the family garage.
   ``I have sold everything I own to do this,'' the inventor said.
``I even had to get divorced. My wife told me I was crazy. But I
believe in it.''

<HEAD>Water Managers Join Melaleuca Fight</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Water managers have joined the
fight against the thirsty melaleuca tree, an Australian import that
in less than a decade may take over three-quarters of the
Everglades.
   Wiping out the tree will take more than $10 million and as long
as 25 years, a task force has concluded, and the Souh Florida Water
Management District governing board has provided $75,000 for the
first year's work.
   Introduced in 1906 by a University of Miami forestry professor
who saw it as a potential timber source, the melaleuca had no
natural enemies.
   Scientists believe it infests 625 square miles. More than 60
square miles of that _ an area nearly as big as Washington, D.C. _
is solid melaleuca, the report says.
   The tree overwhelms habitats, disrupts food chains and takes
three to six times as much water as sawgrass and other plants. It
burns hot and spreads its seeds after fires. It also has a foul
odor and may cause respiratory problems.
   The task force has suggested using chemicals for now and
eventually introducing insects that are its natural enemies. But
there is concern the bugs could become as much a threat as the
trees they kill.
   The task force concedes the tree will never be eradicated. Its
goal is to stop its spread and manage it.
   The tree thrives in warm climates with infrequent frosts,
tolerates a range of soils and water qualities and can grow in
flooded and dry areas. The melaleuca is identified by a papery bark
and white flowers that look like bottle brushes.

<HEAD>Organization for Fat People Wants Discrimination Protection</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A national organization for fat people
wants to make discrimination based on size illegal in Minnesota.
   The National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance recently
asked several state senators and state Human Rights Commissioner
Stephen Cooper to amend the Minnesota Human Rights Act to protect
large people.
   The act protects against discrimination in housing, employment,
education, public accommodations and public services on the basis
of race, color, gender, religious beliefs, marital status and age.
   Fat people, often the target of cruel jokes throughout their
lives, need human rights protection, said Sarah Johnson, chairwoman
of the group's 20-member North Central chapter, which includes
Minnesota, Iowa and western Wisconsin.
   ``You can get hired into an organization and you can do a very
good job, but you will never be put out in front if you're a big
person,'' she said.
   Michigan is the only state in the country which bars
discrimination on the basis of size, Johnson said.
   Cooper said it is probably too late to get an amendment through
the present legislative session. He also said the group would need
to establish that fat people are losing opportunities for jobs,
housing or public services because of their size.
   ``I am willing to talk to them between now and next session and
listen and learn,'' Cooper said.

<HEAD>Use of Battery-Powered Heart Aid Planned</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Texas Heart Institute surgeons plan to implant a
battery-powered heart assist device in a patient this summer if
they get federal approval.
   If successful, the patient could move freely and perhaps leave
the hospital while awaiting a transplant, said Dr. O.H. Frazier,
director of the Houston-based institute's cardiovascular surgical
research laboratories and heart transplant service.
   THI and Thermo Cardiosystem Inc. have applied for a Food and
Drug Administration exemption that would permit them to use the
battery-powered device in patients awaiting transplants.
   THI and the Massachusetts-based bioengineering company have
worked together on heart pumps for several years, and their experts
believe the battery-powered device is an important step forward.
   Currently, such devices are powered by large air-driven pumps,
making movement difficult.
   ``With this newer electrical pump, you do have a wire through
the skin, but it's battery controlled,'' said Frazier.
   The heart assist pump or left ventricular assist device performs
most of the pumping function of a normal heart's left ventricle.
Many patients can live for months with such a device.
   The battery-powered pump is vented to the outside through a
small tube, Frazier said. The only other part that passes through
the skin is the wire that leads to the external battery worn under
the patient's arm.
   Frazier said sending patients home while they await surgery will
save tens of thousands of dollars. Those who have sedentary jobs
might even be able to go back to work, he said.

<HEAD>Perrier Dumps Riney as Ad Agency, Hires Waring &amp; LaRosa</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hal Riney &amp; Partners created the advertising
that said ``It's perfect. It's Perrier.'' But last month, bottles
of the sparkling water were recalled because they were
contaminated. Now Riney has lost a job.
   Perrier Group of America Inc., the U.S. importer of Perrier,
said it was dropping the San Francisco-based agency after four
years of making ads for the Perrier brand, which had been the
leading imported water in the United States.
   The announcement Wednesday was a surprise. Company officials had
said earlier this month that Riney was working on a new ad campaign
expected to be launched once the brand is restocked in stores, bars
and restaurants.
   The company never announced it was looking for a new agency.
   ``We strongly feel it is the right time for a totally new
strategic and creative thrust for our brand,'' said Kim E. Jeffery,
senior vice president for sales and marketing for Perrier Group.
   Perrier said it had hired Waring &amp; LaRosa Inc., a New York-based
firm which preceded Riney as Perrier's ad agency for five years
ending in 1986.
   In its first tour of duty for Perrier, Waring &amp; LaRosa created
an ad campaign that described the brand as ``Earth's first soft
drink.''
   Perrier expects to spend $8 million to $10 million on the new
advertising campaign, which is expected to start this summer.
   At the moment, the importer is using advertising that relies
heavily on humor to keep consumers interested while new shipments
of Perrier are brought into the United States. It is now expected
that the first new bottles, carrying the special mark ``Nouvelle
Production,'' will be available on the East Coast in late April or
early May and later elsewhere.
   Calls placed to Riney's offices in San Francisco and New York
seeking comment were not returned.
   Perrier said Riney continues as its agency for four other
bottled waters _ Arrowhead, Calistoga, Ozarka and Zephyrhills.
   Riney was the agency that created the ad characters Frank
Bartles and Ed Jaymes for the wine cooler from the Gallo Winery and
is also remembered for its lush portrayals of weddings and family
celebrations for Gallo wines.
   Its advertising for Perrier described the unique set of
ecological events that resulted in the creation of the spring in
Vergeze, France, from which Perrier is drawn.
   In February, traces of the chemical benzene were discovered in
bottles of Perrier in North Carolina. Eventually, Perrier was
recalled worldwide. The problem was traced to a dirty filter at the
bottling site.
   Perrier said steps have been taken to prevent recurrence of the
contamination.
   Jeffery said Waring &amp; LaRosa's past association with Perrier
provided ``a unique historical perspective and comprehensive
understanding'' that was a major factor in Perrier's decision to
change ad agencies.
   The new ads will remind ``consumers of the 1990s how Perrier
fits into their changing lifestyles,'' Jeffery said.
   Joseph LaRosa, chairman and creative director, said Waring &amp;
LaRosa got the assignment after ``a series of discussions that
evolved over time'' and grew more intensive in the past few weeks.
He declined to say what his agency had in mind for the new
advertising campaign.
   LaRosa said the brand can rebound. It had been the biggest
selling imported bottled water in the United States and the third
best-seller overall with about 5.7 percent of the $2.2 billion U.S.
market in 1988.
   ``It's a terrific product, and should be back to its original
status,'' he said.

<HEAD>UAL Board Meets; Deal Seen As More Likely</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Directors of the UAL Corp. have met for the
second time in a week but aren't saying whether they are any closer
to approving a buyout deal for the parent of United Airlines.
   ``The meeting is over and there is no statement,'' UAL spokesman
Robert Doughty said Wednesday night following the latest board
session.
   UAL is the Chicago-based parent of United Airlines, the nation's
second-largest carrier after American Airlines.
   A group representing United's pilots, machinists and flight
attendants _ nearly two-thirds of UAL's 71,000 employees _ proposed
on March 19 a buyout that would give UAL's entire workforce 75
percent ownership of the company.
   The proposed deal for $150 a share in cash and $25 in debt
securities plus non-voting stock would leave 25 percent of UAL in
the public's hands.
   The board is seeking a higher price and also is exploring the
possibility of selling some of UAL's assets to make a big payout to
shareholders in an effort to bolster its share price.
   The bid is supported by UAL's largest shareholder, Coniston
Partners, which is threatening to wage a proxy fight to oust UAL's
board at the company's annual shareholders meeting April 26.
   UAL's board agreed last week to negotiate with the unions but
cited ``serious deficiencies'' in their offer, including the price
and a lack of financing commitments.
   The board has been wary of the unions' overtures following the
collapse last October of a $6.8 billion attempt led by the pilots
and UAL's senior management. The offer failed for lack of financing.
   UAL's stock closed at $160.87{ Wednesday on the New York Stock
Exchange, down 62{ cents. But the price was well above $153, the
closing price on March 21 before the last UAL board meeting.

<HEAD>Top Stock Manager Announces Retirement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JONATHAN YENKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For Peter Lynch, retiring as head of the nation's
largest stock mutual fund at the young age of 46 was just another
step that set him apart from most other money managers.
   Lynch managed the Magellan mutual fund for Fidelity Investments
for 13 years, guiding it through bull markets and the Wall Street
crash to establish an unparalleled record of strong growth and
performance.
   On Wednesday, he announced he was cutting short his phenomenally
successful career to spend more time with family and community.
   ``I spent about 21 years with Fidelity,'' Lynch said. ``I'd like
to spend 21 years doing something different.''
   The Magellan fund has $13 billion in assets today compared with
approximately $100 million in 1981, when it became publicly
available to investors.
   Helping draw assets was the fund's performance: $10,000 invested
in the fund on May 31, 1977, would have grown to $270,007 on Dec.
31, 1989, according to Fidelity estimates.
   Lynch also amassed a personal fortune, estimated by Boston
Magazine at $25 million, and now wants to spend his days more
leisurely with his wife and three children.
   Lynch noted that his father died of cancer at age 46.
   ``There's nothing magic about 46,'' he said. ``But you think
about those things.''
   Lynch, who officially retires May 31, will join the board of
trustees for Fidelity, the nation's largest operator of mutual
funds.
   Fidelity Chairman and Chief Executive Edward C. Johnson 3rd
issued a statement saying: ``Even if he never invests another
dollar, Peter Lynch has won a place of honor in the history of
money management.''
   During the last five years, when it was the nation's largest
common stock fund, Magellan has outperformed the Standard &amp; Poor's
500 by an average of 6 percent annually, the company said.
   Underpinning Lynch's success was his method of long-term
investing in sound companies, rather than trying to outguess the
market as a whole _ a strategy he outlined in his best-selling
book, ``One Up On Wall Street.''
   Despite this success, Lynch said in recent months it was
becoming more difficult to find underperforming stocks that can
yield big returns, because stock prices have continued their annual
growth.
   Lynch said Magellan now has about 13 percent of its assets in
cash, about $1.7 billion, a level company officials say is an
all-time high for the fund.
   ``What you need is a drop in the market or a big recession for
big winners,'' he said.
   But Lynch said he's still finding stocks to invest in and is
confident the Magellan fund can continue outperforming the stock
market as a whole.
   ``Fidelity is loaded with talented people,'' he said. ``It's
possible Magellan will do better in the next five years with
another person.''
   Magellan's new portfolio manager will be Morris Smith, 33,
currently manager of Fidelity OTC Portfolios.
   Smith's fund, which focuses on smaller companies listed in the
national over-the-counter market, also has performed well. In the
five years ended Dec. 31, 1989, the fund had an annualized average
return of 25.05 percent, compared with 13.96 percent for all small
company growth funds, according to Lipper Analytical Services.
   Magellan shareholders will be notified of the changes in the
fund's annual report, due to be mailed in May, officials said.
   Joy Smith, a Fidelity spokeswoman, said the company was not
immediately seeing many redemption orders from Magellan investors
in the wake of Lynch's announcement.

<HEAD>Thomson McKinnon Files for Chapter 11</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thomson McKinnon Securities Inc. has filed for
Chapter 11 bankruptcy court protection to hasten its liquidation
after failing to find a buyer since the 1987 stock market crash.
   The 105-year-old firm, once the nation's ninth-largest
brokerage, said the filing was ``long anticipated.'' The firm
stopped doing business eight months ago after selling most of its
operations.
   Wednesday's filing in U.S. Bankruptcy Court freezes pending
legal action against the collapsed Wall Street house and places
other contentious issues in liquidating the firm under the auspices
of a federal judge.
   Thomson McKinnon listed $89 million in assets and $139 million
in liabilities in filing for protection from creditors.
   Last July, the firm sold its retail brokerage offices and
customer accounts to Prudential-Bache Securities Corp. for about
$60 million. That deal followed the collapse of a proposed merger
of the two firms that would have created one of the largest
securities houses on Wall Street.
   Since then, Thomson McKinnon has sold its seats on the nation's
stock and commodity exchanges, but it still needs to liquidate part
of its securities portfolio and other assets.
   ``It became apparent that we were at a point where we could do
better if we have the assistance and protection of the bankruptcy
court,'' said Donald G. McCabe, Thomson McKinnon general counsel.
   Brokerage firms generally are not permitted to seek Chapter 11
protection voluntarily. But Thomson McKinnon officials said the
filing was allowed because the firm no longer had active accounts
and most of its holdings had been liquidated.
   The firm has been liquidating under the auspices of the
Securities and Exchange Commission and the Securities Investor
Protection Corp. The officials said both agencies endorsed the
bankruptcy filing.
   The securities firm has been reduced to about 100 employees from
4,700 before the Prudential-Bache deal, McCabe said.
   Thomson McKinnon said it lost $33.7 million in 1987 and $38.5
million in 1988. In addition to stock and bond losses, the company
said losses from a real estate investment trust heightened its need
for a buyer.
   The bankruptcy filing names Commonwealth Bank of Australia as
its largest unsecured creditor, owed $27.5 million from a
subordinated loan. The second largest claim is an $11 million
subordinated loan from Hill Samuel Bank of London.
   The filing also says Thomson McKinnon wants to segregate $22
million in assets for the accounts of former customers.
   Several class-action lawsuits filed on behalf of former Thomson
McKinnon employees recently were consolidated in federal court in
New York. They allege broad financial mismanagement, including
buying apartments and a yacht with company assets. At least one
suit seeks $100 million in damages.
   Under federal law, all legal action against the brokerage unit
is suspended during bankruptcy proceedings. The lawsuits, though,
also name the parent company, Thomson McKinnon Inc., and that
action can proceed.
   The parent still is seeking to liquidate all its assets. The
company said in a statement that its efforts are focused on
attempting to sell its 63 percent interest in its other operating
entity, Thomson McKinnon Asset Management LP.
   That unit, a mutual fund and private account money manager for
$6.7 billion in assets, is not affected by the bankruptcy filing.
It has operated as a separate entity since a public stock offering
in 1987.

<HEAD>Dollar, Stocks Slide in Tokyo</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar fell against the yen in Tokyo today
following dollar selling by Japan's central bank and by
profit-takers. Stock prices declined.
   The dollar ended the day's trading at 156.65 yen, down 1.98 yen
from Wednesday's 158.63-yen finish. It opened at 158.30 yen, its
high for the day, and fell as low as 156.40 yen.
   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average
lost 237.41 points, or 0.75 percent, ending the day at 31,026.16.
   The rise in the yen followed the U.S. currency's downturn
Wednesday afternoon in New York after intervention by the U.S.
Federal Reserve Board, dealers said.
   ``It was about time for the yen to recover after so much
dollar-buying,'' said Mitsuhiko Kinugasa, a dealer with Daiwa Bank.
   The dollar has gained 6.87 yen since March 1, when it ended
trading at 149.78 yen.
   ``Considering the recent rise in the dollar, the yen's jump
today is significant,'' Kinugasa said. ``But we have to wait for a
few more days to see whether this is a sign of a real change in the
recent trend.''
   He said the dollar continued to weaken during afternoon trading
in Tokyo as participants sold the U.S. currency for profit-taking,
while the Bank of Japan intervened intermittently.
   The Bank of Japan was seen selling at least several million
dollars in an attempt to support the yen. The total amount was not
available immediately, as the bank does not usually comment on its
market interventions.
   Fuji Bank dealer Kenzo Shinomiya said many market players have
accumulated large dollar positions over the recent weeks.
   Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto said Thursday he hopes
exchange rates will come to reflect real economic conditions, Kyodo
News Service reported.
   Kyodo also quoted Hashimoto as saying he intends to urge
cooperation among the Group of Seven industrialized nations in
currency stability at their meeting scheduled for April 7 in Paris.
   Analysts have attributed the stock market's recent plunge in
part to higher interest rates resulting from the yen's weakness
against the dollar.
   On March 20, the Bank of Japan boosted its official discount
rate by one percentage point to 5.25 percent in an attempt to head
off inflation and strengthen the yen.
   Traders attributed the Nikkei's fall today to index-linked
selling that triggered sales by other participants. They said the
Nikkei index failed to maintain an early upswing because of
continuing pessimism in the market.
   ``Although the yen jumped today, market players are still
cautious about currency trends because the yen's strength could be
just a temporary movement,'' said Yoshio Shimoyama, a senior trader
with Nikko Securities Co.
   ``Also, individual market players have come to pay more
attention to company performance instead of to day-to-day changes
in currency and interest rates for their investment criteria,'' he
added.
   The price of benchmark No. 119 Japanese government bonds ended
at 86.72 points, up from Wednesday's 86.14. Their yield fell to 7.2
percent from the previous day's close at 7.32 percent.

   A House panel is proposing $719 million in new
aid to Eastern European countries overhauling their economies, more
than double the amount President Bush is seeking.
   Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y., who proposed the enlarged package
for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1, said it would help soften the
shock as countries such as Poland undertake ``cold-turkey''
switches from centrally planned to market economies.
   As inefficient state enterprises are shut down and people are
thrown out of work, unrest will inevitably result that could
threaten the new democratic governments, Solarz told the House
Foreign Affairs Committee.
   ``It could create a socially and politically explosive
situation,'' he said. ``We need to do more than we've done so far.''
   Poland and Hungary are receiving $293 million in U.S. cash aid
this year, and the administration has proposed $300 million for
Eastern Europe in the new fiscal year.
   Meantime, the House speeded up the ide the U.S. Supreme Court the context

   Proxy fights could be good news for newspaper
advertising managers.
   About a dozen newspapers shared in an advertising windfall
generated by the proxy fight for control of Lockheed Corp. when the
combatants decided to plead their cases in full-page ads over the
past month.
   Neither Lockheed, the California-based defense and aerospace
concern, nor the group led by Harold Simmons that is trying to put
its own slate of nominees on the Lockheed board would estimate
Wednesday how much they spent on ads.
   But it is likely their month-long courtship of Lockheed
shareholders cost them several million dollars for advertising.
   The extra ad revenue has been a welcome, if short-lived, respite
from the recent sluggishness in ad spending, especially in
financial advertising.
   More pleasant surprises could be in store if proxy fights
replace takeover offers as the weapon of choice in deciding who
rules the boardroom.
   Ads for Lockheed and Simmons showed up in The Wall Street
Journal, the New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, San Francisco
Chronicle and the Washington Post.
   In the past 10 days alone, Lockheed and Simmon's group each have
purchased eight full page ads in the Journal and four to five each
in The New York Times.
   Both sides also bought ads in papers near sites where Lockheed
has plants such as the San Jose (Calif.) Mercury News, the Marietta
(Ga.) Daily Journal and The Telegraph in Nashua, N.H.
   ``We are getting some lift, particularly in the last couple of
weeks,'' said Roger May, a spokesman for Dow Jones &amp; Co., publisher
of The Wall Street Journal. ``If proxy fights are back in vogue, we
would be the beneficiaries of it.''
   The Journal's overall advertising linage was down 5.1 percent
per issue in the first two months of the year, May said. Most of
the Lockheed-Simmons proxy fight has been fought in March.
   The Journal charges $99,384 for a single full-page national ad
although companies with regular contracts for ad space pay less,
May said. The comparable one-time charge for a page in Barron's is
$14,478.
   The Lockheed fight ``has made a significant impact on our
financial advertising linage,'' said spokeswoman Laura Morgan of
the Los Angeles Times.
   She estimated the paper has carried 15 pages of ads related to
that battle alone in the past month. The one-time full-page rate is
about $50,000.
   The New York Times ``has seen some increase in business from the
proxy fight but not enough to call it a trend,'' said spokeswoman
Nancy Nielsen.
   She said financial advertising linage was up by an unspecified
amount at the Times this year, owing mostly to ``strong mutual fund
activity.''
   The New York Times charges $51,408 for a single national
full-page ad in its business section during the week, she said.
   The Simmons group developed about a dozen ads. One had photos
and descriptions of its 14 nominees, another outlined the group's
credentials and others featured comments from individual nominees.
   Sidney Herman, a lawyer for the Simmons group, said it planned
to spend $6 million on the proxy fight, including the costs of
mailing, proxy solicitation and advertising.
   Lockheed, based in Calabasas, Calif., said it would spend $8
million on all aspects of the proxy fight, including advertising.
   The company said it developed at least 10 different ads,
including one offering an open letter from its chairman and another
in which the Lockheed board advised, ``Don't Risk Your Investment
on NL's Promises.''
   Both sides said the advertising supplements the message they
deliver shareholders by mail, telephone and in person.
   ``It's just a matter of keeping the message in front of the
shareholders,'' said Lockheed spokesman Ron Meder.
   Jack Von Deck, advertising manager for The Telegraph in New
Hampshire, where a Lockheed division plant is located, said the
proxy fight generated ``some linage we didn't expect'' but that the
increase was short-lived and would not significantly raise profits.
   He estimated the paper, which charges $1,795 for a one-time
full-page ad, got about 10 to 12 pages of ads as a result of the
proxy fight.
   ``It has been helpful and we are glad to get it ... but we are
not going to Florida on it,'' he said.

<HEAD>Import Dealers Say Iacocca Blames Problems on Consumers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM S. BERGSTROM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Chrysler Corp. Chairman Lee Iacocca is wrongly
blaming consumers for Chrysler's stumbling sales, foreign car
dealers say.
   ``Lee Iacocca became famous for ending his commercials by saying
`If you can find a better-built car, buy it,''' said Walter E.
Huizenga, president of the American International Automobile
Dealers Association.
   ``Now he is complaining because the American consumers have
taken his advice,'' Huizenga said.
   Iacocca visited New York on Wednesday as part of a six-city
campaign to convince buyers his company's cars are as good as
Japan's. He launched his tour earlier this month, traveling with an
array of 1990 Chrysler models.
   In addition to touting Chrysler, Iacocca has criticized trade
barriers that keep U.S. companies from competing in Japanese
markets.
   ``What we sell in one year in Japan they sell in 46 hours here.
This crap has got to stop,'' he said at Wednesday's New York news
conference.
   Chrysler spokesman Tom Jakobowski said the company wasn't
bashing imports or telling Americans not to buy them.
   ``What we are saying is Chrysler builds as good a product or
better,'' he said. ``What we are doing is speaking out to dispel
the myth that U.S. cars are inferior.''
   Cars with Japanese nameplates made up 25.8 percent of the U.S.
car market last year, up from 21.1 percent in 1982. The combined
share of the Big Three domestic automakers _ Chrysler, General
Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. _ slipped from 69.8 percent to 67.5
percent during that period.
   In 1989, for the first time, the best-selling car had an import
nameplate, Honda Accord, although 60 percent of Accords are built
in the United States.
   Chrysler's 1989 domestic sales totaled 917,506 cars. Among the
imports, Honda was closest at 389,472.
   Chrysler's national television advertisements featuring Iacocca
contend that Chrysler's quality is as good as Japan's. ``Nobody
knows it, and that's going to change,'' he says in the commercials.
   Huizenga said Wednesday, ``The free market is an excellent
barometer of relative automobile quality and the American consumer
is an excellent judge of that quality.''
   ``They know the quality of imported cars is better _ and they
are better,'' he said. ``No amount of complaining is going to
change that.''
   The import group said Japanese vehicles sold under Chrysler
nameplates, such as the Dodge Colt and Ram 50 pickup truck,
accounted for 7 percent of Chrysler's 1989 sales. It also said more
than half the 400,000 Plymouth and Dodge minivans sold last year
had Mitsubishi engines.
   Huizenga's association represents 9,700 dealers selling Japanese
and other imported cars. Among other things, it lobbies for an end
to the voluntary import restraints on Japanese automakers,
spokesman Paul Donnellan said.

   The stock market pulled back a bit today amid
uncertainty over the outlook for interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials slipped 5.40 to 2,738.29
in the first half hour of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 3 to 2 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 349 up, 563 down and
498 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 19.72 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Interest rates rose modestly in the market for U.S. Treasury
bonds this morning.
   Prices of the longest-term bonds dropped nearly $5 for each
$1,000 in face value, putting their yields in the 8.5 percent-8.55
percent range.
   Analysts said the activity in bonds continued to reflect worries
that an apparently budding revival in economic growth might tend to
push rates higher in the months ahead.
   The latest figures from the Commerce Department, issued on
Wednesday, showed a slightly stronger pace of business activity
than had been previously estimated during the fourth quarter of
last year.
   Losers among the blue chips included Exxon, down &lsqb; at 46&lsqb;;
Coca-Cola, down \ at 75|; General Electric, down \ at 64|, and
International Paper, down \ at 51|.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks lost
.18 to 187.59. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was off .44 at 360.79.
   On Wednesday the Dow Jones industrial average rose 6.75 to
2,743.69.
   But declining issues slightly outpaced advances on the NYSE,
with 700 up, 720 down and 552 unchanged..
   Big Board volume totaled 142.30 million shares, against 131.61
million in the previous session.

   The White House today rejected Democratic
criticism of its selection of attorney T. Timothy Ryan Jr. to
regulate the savings and loan industry, but acknowledged it ``had a
little trouble'' finding a banker who would take the job.
   At a confirmation hearing, Democrats on the Senate Banking
Committee gave a chilly reception to Ryan, questioning his ethics
and lack of experience in banking or savings and loans.
   In response, White House Press Secretary Marlin Fitzwater said,
``Frankly we've had a little trouble finding people in the banking
industry who want to take this job.
   ``And also, frankly, I think it's not at all certain from the
track record from the S&amp;L industry that that's the best place to
draw on expertise,'' the press secretary added.
   ``I think the feeling here is, we need somebody who is a tough
enforcer, who knows how to go in there and get things done and
clean up this mess and knows how to use the law and use the
resources at his command to crack some heads and get things
moving,'' Fitzwater said.
   Ryan, 44, a former senior Labor Department official, now is a
private attorney specializing in pension and employee benefit law.
   He told senators complaining about his lack of relevant
experience that he was surprised when Treasury Department officials
approached him about the job about four weeks ago.
   Nevertheless, Ryan replied, ``Absolutely,'' when senators asked
if he was fully qualified to direct the Treasury Department's
Office of Thrift Supervision, which supervises 2,600 thrift
institutions.
   ``I am not ... an absolute expert on the thrift industry. I can
tell you, though, that in the last four weeks, I've spent an
enormous amount of time trying to educate myself,'' he said.
   Ryan said he was an experienced manager of large organizations,
citing his 1981-83 tenure as solicitor of the Labor Department
where he managed 600 attorneys working in Washington and 16 field
offices.
   Despite their misgivings, senators are under intense pressure to
confirm Ryan quickly. President Bush nominated him March 22, hoping
to blunt a constitutional challenge that has put its S&amp;L bailout
program in limbo.
   A U.S. District Court judge in Washington ruled last week that
the acting director of the thrift office, Salvatore Martoche, and
his predecessor, M. Danny Wall, lacked the constitutional authority
to close failed thrifts because they were never confirmed by the
Senate.
   The Banking Committee could vote on the nomination as soon as
its next meeting on April 3, but Chairman Donald W. Riegle Jr.,
D-Mich., said he could not guarantee the outcome.
   ``Some members have already expressed to me serious reservations
about your nomination,'' Riegle told Ryan.
   Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, who is not a committee member
but attended the hearing, contended that conflicts of interest
between the nominee's public and private careers ``raise basic
questions about Mr. Ryan's sense of propriety.''
   While in government, Ryan helped select former Attorney General
William B. Saxbe as independent counsel overseeing the Teamsters
union's central States Pension Fund.
   After Ryan left the department, Saxbe received court permission
to join Ryan's law firm, bringing hundreds of thousands of dollars
in fees from the pension oversight contract.
   In 1985, the Labor Department asked Ryan to resign as a member
of an advisory council on pension fund issues after it discovered
that he was also serving as counsel to a trade group, the Employee
Stock Ownership Association of America.
   Metzenbaum also criticized Ryan for sitting on the council while
a client, the Washington Business Group on Health, had an interest
in issues before it.
   And, he said Ryan should not have advised the National Maritime
Union of America on a union election that the Labor Department had
begun investigating shortly before Ryan left government.
   In his defense, Ryan said a federal court concluded it was not
improper for Saxbe to join his firm. He said he never participated
in employee-owned stock matters while working for the advisory
council, did not represent the business group on the pension matter
that came before the advisory board and never dealt with the Labor
Department directly concerning the maritime union.
   Ryan was strongly dfended by Sen. John Warner, R-Va., who
employed him as an aide in his last three campaigns.
   ``The president, the secretary of the Treasury and to some
extent I have been involved in this nomination and we're going to
stand by this man,'' Warner said. ``The man's tough. The man's
fair. The man's honest.''
   Some Democrats also are uneasy about Ryan's record as a
Republican activist. He served as an aide or attorney in
presidential campaigns for Richard Nixon in 1972, Gerald Ford in
1976 and George Bush in 1988. He was a legal counsel to Ronald
Reagan's 1980 transition team.
   ``I pledge to you this (agency's work) will be done on a fully
non-partisan basis,'' Ryan told the committee.

<HEAD>Stockholder Outlines Restructuring Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CATHERINE WILSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A major shareholder of embattled General
Development Corp. has outlined a rescue plan calling for the sale
of assets of the scandal-plagued Florida builder.
   United Capital Corp. filed the restructuring plan Wednesday in
response to a letter from the indicted builder saying serious
inquiries had been received about buying the Miami-based company,
its assets or stock.
   GDC pleaded guilty to a mail-fraud conspiracy charge March 22 in
federal court amid allegations the company priced 10,000 homes well
above fair market values and kept buyers from learning the
difference.
   United Capital, a New York-based real estate company that holds
12.6 percent of GDC's common stock, has asked GDC's board to delay
any major decisions until its annual meeting May 4 to give
stockholders a voice in the company's future.
   United Capital paid an average of almost $13 a share for GDC
stock in 1988. GDU stock was up 50 cents to $4.75 a share in early
New York Stock Exchange trading today.
   The restructuring plan filed by United Capital with the
Securities and Exchange Commission proposed selling the company's
time-sharing and utility businesses and undeveloped commercial
property.
   The plan also offered short-term operating funds and pledged to
complete infrastructure improvements in GDC's planned communities,
a big worry for homeowners.
   GDC acknowledged it ``is experiencing severe financial pressures
in large part'' because of the criminal investigation.
   In a separate SEC filing Tuesday, United Capital called for the
ouster of six directors and suggested a replacement slate.
   GDC responded Wednesday by naming Chesterfield Smith, a senior
partner with the Tampa-based law firm of Holland &amp; Knight, to fill
one of the vacancies left by the resignation of GDC's top two
executives days before the indictment. Smith is a former president
of the American Bar Association.
   ``It's my hope that whatever harmed (GDC's) reputation in the
past, my associates and I will correct,'' Smith said.
   Prosecutors alleged that the 35-year-old GDC, which has
developed nine Florida communities, pitched its houses at inflated
prices primarily to out-of-state buyers looking for retirement
homes.

<HEAD>Soybeans Rebound Weakly; Grain Futures Open Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soybean futures prices rebounded weakly today
from a steep decline in the previous session while grain futures
were narrowly mixed in early trading on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   The slight recovery in the soybean market after Wednesday's
tumble of more than 11 cents a bushel mainly reflected speculative
buying, analysts said.
   But commercial players were said to be inclined to sell soybeans
on any significant price increase, keeping a lid on the gains.
   ``The cash attitude is to let 'em rally, then sell 'em,'' said
William Biedermann, director of research for the futures brokerage
Allendale Inc. ``We're in a two-sided market.''
   Corn and wheat futures were narrowly mixed in cautious trading
ahead of Friday's Agriculture Department report on quarterly grain
stocks and spring planting intentions.
   The reports are scheduled for release after the close of trading
Friday. The plantings-intentions report is expected to show that
farmers plan to sow more corn while cutting back on soybean and
spring wheat acreage.
   In early trading, wheat futures were 2{ cents lower to { cent
higher with the contract for delivery in May at $3.48} a bushel;
corn was unchanged to { cent lower with May at $2.59\ a bushel;
oats were unchanged to } cent higher with May at $1.45} a bushel;
soybeans were 1 cent to 3 cents higher with May at $5.89} a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were mostly lower in early trading on
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .05 cent to .35 cent lower with April at 77.67
cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .27 cent lower with
March at 82.55 cents a pound; live hogs were .45 cent lower to .05
cent higher with April at 52.82 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies
were .55 cent to .66 cent lower with May at 53.30 cents a pound.
   Livestock and meat futures settled mostly higher on Wednesday.

<DATELINE>ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The glitter of the casinos that began
operating here 12 years ago is fading, and many say a
billion-dollar Donald Trump resort could make or break Atlantic
City following its debut next week.
   The unsafe streets, trash-strewn lots and rusting casino
projects that surround the city's swank gambling districts suggest
the casinos have failed to deliver the financial well-being
promised when they began reopening in 1978.
   Many say the key to the future of the $3 billion business is the
Taj Mahal Casino Resort, the third casino to be opened by Trump,
who received a one-year gaming license today from the state Casino
Control Comission.
   ``We think it's going to be a tremendous success,'' Trump said
today.
   Both Trump and his competitors hope the novelty and sparkle of
the giant casino will widen the city's drawing power. City
officials hope more money will be generated to cure its problems.
   ``The casinos can be very successful,'' Trump said in a
telephone interview Monday. ``Atlantic City can still be an
entertainment island.''
   The Taj Mahal wilwhere we want to keep it for
a while.''
   The satellite was intended for a geosynchronous orbit 22,300
miles high, from where it would have transmitted three TV channels
and up to 120,000 telephone calls simultaneously for more than 13
years. It was to have eventually replaced two older satellites over
the Atlantic.
   Martin Marietta Corp., which conducted the $272 million launch,
has blamed the failure on a faulty design.
   Officials of Intelsat and Hughes Aircraft Co., which built the
satellite, met Tuesday in Washington with NASA representatives to
discuss the possibilities of saving the spacecraft. It was the
second time the groups had met.
   Among the possibilities being considered is a space shuttle
rescue.
   ``Things are looking quite positive,'' Trujillo said.
``Obviously, there are a lot of technical issues that have to be
dealt with, but we're very heartened by NASA's willingness to
explore the possibility with us.''
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has said a
rescue attempt is technically feasible but more talks are needed
before any decision would be made.

<TEXT>
   A new agency that controls millions of dollars
in federal housing money is the prize in a power struggle pitting
top aides to Housing Secretary Jack Kemp against Kemp's handpicked
choice to head the panel.
   Kemp's personal involvement in the fight for control o the
Federal Housing Finance Board is unclear, but actions by a top
deputy conflict with statements by Kemp and others that the
Department of Housing and Urban Development still wants Mary K.
Bush to lead the agency.
   The battle could come to a head today; Kemp summoned Ms. Bush
for an afternoon meeting in his office.
   The board was created as part of the savings and loan bailout
legislation. It oversees the 12 Federal Home Loan Banks and is to
channel some of their profits into housing programs. The board
selects which projects get housing funds _ nearly $80 million in
the current fiscal year and roughly $100 million annually within a
few years.
   Seven months after Ms. Bush assumed her duties as acting
director, her promised appointment as chairwoman has yet to be
made. Nor have appointments of the three other board members been
made.
   Publicly, HUD and Finance Board officials blame the agency's
slow start on delays in recruiting candidates and a disagreement
over whether board members should serve full time or part time.
   The effect has been to leave the independent agency _ and the
subsidies _ under Kemp's control.
   The agency has about 100 jobs, including about a dozen with
annual salaries in the $100,000 range. About 50 of the staff
positions have been filled.
   ``This place is a lot more important than they thought,'' said
one congressional source. ``Now we have a big fight, they are
trying to take control and she (Ms. Bush) isn't going along with
them.''
   According to several agency sources, HUD Undersecretary Alfred
DelliBovi is at the center of the effort to guarantee that HUD
keeps considerable influence over the Finance Board.
   DelliBovi, however, denied in an interview that he was trying to
discredit Ms. Bush or exert undue influence over her or the agency.
DelliBovi has longstanding ties to Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y.,
and is not among Kemp's inner circle. But his efforts have been
supported by Scott Reed, one of Kemp's two top aides, according to
sources.
   In Congress, meanwhile, Democrats who pushed for the new
infusion of housing money are critical of the delays in naming a
board and wary of HUD's motives.
   At a recent Senate Banking Committee hearing Sen. Alan Cranston,
D-Calif., told Kemp he was worried HUD was trying to set agency
policies and make major hiring decisions before a board was named.
   Several attempts to reach Kemp through top aide Mary Brunette
this week were unsuccessful; she did not return repeated telephone
calls.
   Ms. Bush, who refused to be interviewed, said in a statement:
   ``There have been rumors circulating for some time that there
are people who would rather see someone else in this position. My
loyalties are to Jack Kemp and to the missions of this agency.''
   DelliBovi's public statements appear to conflict with comments
he made seven weeks ago in an internal HUD memo obtained by The
Associated Press.
   Among them:
   _DelliBovi told the AP on Friday that Kemp had slashed Ms.
Bush's contracting powers after learning earlier in the week of
three no-bid contracts she had given to friends. The agency does
not have to put contracts out for competitive bids.
   DelliBovi said HUD officials had been unaware of the contracts,
including one to Kemp's former chief of staff, Wendell Gunn, until
last week.
   But DelliBovi's memo, written Feb. 5, refers to ``Wendell''
twice, once in a listing of people paid by the agency.
   Gunn, in an interview, said he told Kemp of the consulting
arrangement ``face to face'' last late year. Gunn wrote an angry
letter to DelliBovi this week accusing him of ``media mischief''
that ``sets a dangerous trap for you and, unfortunately, Secretary
Kemp.''
   _Supporting Kemp's public statements, DelliBovi said in the
interview that he and the secretary stood by Ms. Bush for the job
despite the concern over the contracts, and dismissed assertions
from Capitol Hill sources who said DelliBovi wanted Ms. Bush to
leave.
   But in his memo to six HUD officials, DelliBovi mentioned that
``Wendell'' was hoping to soon end his consulting arrangement.
   ``If he goes, let's hope he takes Mary with him,'' is how
DelliBovi concluded the memo.
   The struggle is for an agency that at first was treated by the
administration as an unwanted orphan of the S&amp;L bailout.
   Congress made the housing secretary the only permanent member of
the board and left control of the agency with Kemp until a full
board was named. The White House passed its power to find a
chairman to Kemp, who recruited Ms. Bush.
   HUD has kept a presence at the agency since its inception, at
first temporarily assigning Kemp aide Russell Paul to the staff.
When Paul returned to HUD full time in February the agency hired an
$83,000-a-year consultant, Patrick Pizzella, who according to
several HUD and Finance Board sources was appointed over Ms. Bush's
objections at DelliBovi's insistence.
   DelliBovi's memo recounted Pizzella's efforts to get details of
the Finance Board's hiring and staff structure.
   Several sources said Ms. Bush accepted the job with the
understanding that she would be nominated a full-time chairwoman,
only to be told later that HUD officials had determined all board
members should serve part time. That word came, according to HUD
sources, after Kemp deputies determined he would have more
influence over a part-time board.
   HUD has persisted in saying the board can be part time despite
being repeatedly told by Congress that the positions are full time.
   Said a Senate aide who helped draft the bill: ``We didn't
authorize paying $100,000 a year for part-time people.''

<HEAD>Mobil To Delete References To Bag Degradability</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JULIA C. MARTINEZ</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mobil Corp., criticized by environmentalists for
allegedly misleading advertising, said today it would delete all
references to degradability on its Hefty trash bags.
   Mobil's announcement follows a Federal Trade Commission
investigation started earlier this month into charges of deceptive
advertising and packaging. The investigation was prompted by
environmental claims made by a variety of consumer products _ from
trash bags to hair spray _ and criticized by consumer groups as
misleading.
   Mobil Chemical Co., a division of the nation's second-largest
oil company' said it would continue to make Hefty trash bags with
an ``environmentally safe additive'' which speeds their
decomposition when exposed to sunlight, but will delete the
references to degradability on the packaging.
   Mobil spokesman Allen Gray said the company was taking the
action in response to confusion regarding the definition of
degradability.
   Environmentalists say the reference to degradability is
misleading because the majority of trash bags are not exposed to
sunlight long enough to biodegrade but end up in landfills that are
rarely exposed to sunlight.
   ``If left out in Arizona somewhere a bag with the additive can
quickly decompose in a couple of months,'' Gray conceded, ``but in
a northern climate like Chicago it could take well over a year.''
   FTC Chairman Janet Steiger said earlier this month the agency
had joined a task force of state attorneys general to determine
whether environmental claims made by various products could be
substantiated.
   No specific companies were named by the FTC, but various
environmental groups had targeted claims made by various
manufacturers as misleading and in many cases false.
   Mobil Chemical has said its claims that the bags degrade in
sunlight have been fully substantiated by tests and that the
company never said the bags would be the answer to the country's
waste disposal problem.
   Gray acknowledged that the company began marketing the
degradable bags because of competitive pressures.
   Gray said the phaseout of the labeling is expected to take
several months.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eurotunnel PLC, the Anglo-French consortium
building a rail tunnel under the English Channel, said Thursday
that Tony Ridley had resigned as a director.
   Ridley's departure was widely expected after a management
reorganization last month that effectively left Ridley without any
day-to-day management responsibilities of the company.
   Seventeen members remain on the board.
   The executive shake-up last month came during a cost dispute
between the consortium and its main contractors. At that time,
American John Neerhout, an executive vice president of Bechtel
Group Inc. of San Francisco, was brought in as the project's chief
executive. Ridley was the project's managing director.
   Ridley, 56, joined the Eurotunnel board 14 months ago. He
previously was head of London's subway system.
   The consortium is aiming to complete the 31-mile link between
Britain and France by 1993 despite the spiraling costs and some
delays.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   British Telecommunications PLC on Thursday
announced a major restructuring that its chairman said was designed
to make Britain's predominant telephone company ``leaner and more
supple.''
   The restructuring substantially reorganizes the company, but
does not involve any major layoffs. However, some managers might be
let go after the restructuring is completed in about a year, a
spokesman said.
   British Telecom also said that Managing Director Graeme Odgers
would leave the company shortly by mutual agreement.
   Odgers' departure was not related to the restructuring, said the
spokesman, who was not identified in accordance with British
practice. But he declined to be more specific.
   Analysts speculated that Odgers would have preferred more
cost-cutting at the company. British Telecom Chairman Iain Vallance
is more customer-minded, they said.
   The analysts said the streamlining was not particularly
significant beyond improving customer service. British Telecom
still needs cost-cutting, they said.
   The spokesman said the changes would ``remove substantial
barriers and provide a firm foundation'' for cost control. ``A
company the size of BT does present a challenge with control,'' he
said.
   British Telecom said it would divide individual and business
customer services into two divisions and eliminate the confusion of
dealing with 27 service districts.
   Businesses with operations spread across Britain and
multinational corporations will be able to coordinate their various
telecommunications needs with a single branch of what will be the
Business Communications division, the spokesman said.
   In addition to the business service and the Personal
Communications division, British Telecom said it would gather its
special business operations, such as telephone directory
information, into a third unit.
   The company also said it plans to unify its British sales and
marketing team under single management, which eventually will
absorb the international sales force.
   ``Our objective is to become a leaner and more supple
organization, structured to meet the differing needs of all our
customers,'' Vallance said.

<HEAD>Western Europe Looks at Setting Up U.S.-Style Central Bank in 1993</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Western Europe should be able to set up
an American-style central banking system in 1993, under an
accelerated timetable for economic and monetary union, according to
a European Community official.
   Henning Christophersen, vice president of the trading bloc, said
in a recent interview that the economic merger of the 12 countries
``is now going to be part of the European architecture.''
   ``It is not only an ambition for some governments or for the
commission,'' the European Community's executive body, he said.
   Finance ministers of the Common Market nations plan to meet this
weekend in western Ireland to discuss informally their plans for a
monetary union that eventually would lead to a single currency in
Western Europe.
   In advance of the meeting, Christophersen said the governments
could follow a faster schedule to meet their ambitious goals.
   The monetary plans are part of the community's campaign to
remove trade barriers among the dozen nations by late 1992 and
create a single market of some 320 million consumers.
   The recent political upheavals in Eastern Europe have prompted
many to urge a stepped-up pace in efforts to tightly link the
nations.
   Many of the trading partners want West Germany's powerhouse
economy firmly anchored in the community. Many of their currencies
are tied to the strong German mark and decisions by Germany's
inflation-conscious central bank affect their economies as well.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl traveled to Brussels last
Friday to reassure trading partners that Germany had no intention
of going its own way.
   The community is considering a three-stage blueprint for
economic and monetary union that calls for a European System of
Central Banks, dubbed EuroFed, and use of the Ecu _ the European
currency unit _ as the common currency.
   Christophersen said the plan's second stage, marked by the
central bank system, could begin as early as Jan. 1, 1993.
   Last week, he unveiled a proposal drawn up by the community's
executive body to establish the new EuroFed institution to
coordinate monetary policy among the dozen nations. Each country
now has its own central bank to set monetary policy.
   EuroFed was patterned after the independent central banks of the
United States and West Germany. It would be controlled by a council
made up of the 12 central bank governors and a smaller group of
directors. Directors would be appointed for long terms.
   The Common Market leaders plan a special conference next
December in Italy to make needed revisions in their founding Treaty
of Rome for putting the EuroFed system in place.
   Kohl and French President Francois Mitterrand have indicated the
talks should end by mid-1991.
   Once the treaty revisions are drawn up, it will take a year or
so for ratification by all nations, said Christophersen.
   He gave no date for the start of the third stage on monetary
union, during which the Ecu would be introduced as the joint
currency. But, he said, it would be better for the economic system
to move quickly to that phase.
   The first stage of the monetary plan will go into effect on July
1 when governments coordinate much more closely their economic and
monetary policies. Moreover, capital and exchange controls will be
abolished so money can move freely among the nations.
   The plan calls for all currencies to be linked in the exchange
rate mechanism of the European Monetary System, which keeps their
values roughly steady within certain ranges. The currencies of
Britain, Portugal and Greece remain outside the linkage.
   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who has resisted
entering the pound into the mechanism, has promised to do so but
has given no timetable.
   She has opposed calls for the sweeping monetary changes, arguing
that such plans would force countries to give up some of their
sovereignty to new institutions.
   However, a British alternative proposal to make all European
currencies legal tender throughout the Common Market has gathered
little support.

<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Continental Airlines has settled a $336 million
lawsuit against United Airlines that charged United with unfair
competition in the use of its computerized reservation system.
   The airlines agreed not to disclose the amount of the settlement
reached Wednesday.
   ``I think it's fair to say we're pleased,'' said Continental
attorney David Boies.
   As part of the agreement, Houston-based Continental will drop
another suit that alleged Chicago-based United breached its
contract with Continental in operating the reservation system
between 1980 and 1984, Boies said.
   ``At this point, both companies have put all differences between
them behind them,'' he said.
   United spokesman Joe Hopkins said the company had no comment on
the agreement.
   The settlement was reached shortly before the beginning of jury
deliberations in the 10-week trial of the suit in federal court in
Los Angeles.
   Continental had sought $336 million in damages, claiming United
programmed its computer reservation system to unfairly favor United
flights over those of competitors, even if a competitors' flight
was more convenient for a customer.
   ``They rearranged the order in which flights appeared on the
computer screens,'' Boies said.
   Last year, American Airlines settled with Continental over
similar allegations for a reported $100 million.
   In the suit, Continental, a division of Texas Air Corp., also
accused United of overcharging it and other carriers for the
reservation service.
   United, a UAL Corp. division, last December prevailed in a
similiar suit filed in 1984 on behalf of 11 other airlines.

   Lockheed Corp. Chairman Daniel Tellep,
bowing to pressure from major shareholders, promised today at the
aerospace company's annual meeting to make major concessions to
them in the future.
   The concessions came at the behest of big pensions funds and
other institutional shareholders, many of whom defected to the side
of Harold Simmons, the Texas investor who bought 19 percent of
Lockheed and wants to oust the company's board and replace it with
his nominees.
   Results of voting at the meeting, held in a vast hangar, won't
be known for at least a week.
   Tellep said he met with 70 institutions during the proxy contest
over the past two weeks and he considered this his ``baptism by
fire and a highly valuable experience.''
   ``We believe in shareholder democracy,'' he said, offering the
following concessions to prove it:
   _If there is significant support, as expected, for a resolution
that voting by shareholders be confidential, Lockheed would develop
such a procedure.
   _A provision to opt out of the strict anti-takeover provisions
of law in Delaware, where Lockheed is incorporated. Tellep said
even if that provision does not pass but there is a ``significant''
minority vote for it, he would recommend that the Lockheed board
support an amendment at the next meeting to have Lockheed opt out
of those provisions.
   _A promise to seat up to three shareholder representatives on
Lockheed's 15-person board. He earlier offered only one.
   _An offer to meet regularly with representatives of Simmons' NL
Industries Inc. to discuss the future of Lockheed.
   Simmons says Lockheed, with a recent history of sagging earnings
and underestimating costs of developing new programs, must insist
on better profits in its non-core businesses or sell them off.
   The company portrays him as a corporate raider intent on
personal profit with no knowledge of how to run Lockheed, the
nation's sixth-largest defense contractor with 1989 sales of $9.9
billion.
   Simmons, who has lost $100 million on his $530 million
investment in Lockheed because of a slumping share price, insists
he can better focus the company to profit from its core space,
missiles and aeronautics businesses. That would pull up the share
price for all investors, he claims.
   Simmons says he has a solid track record of profitably running
companies he purchases, like NL Industries Inc., Amalgamated Sugar
Co., and Keystone Steel and Wire Co. He maintains he wants to run a
leaner, more streamlined Lockheed, not just cash out.
   Win or lose in today's vote, ``We're in this for the long run,''
insisted J. Landis Martin, president of NL Industries and chief
strategist for the Texas investor.
   Martin said he was particularly optimistic about the prospects
for passage of Simmons-supported shareholder rights proposals,
including measures to overturn Lockheed's anti-takeover provisions.
   Denied seats on the board by Tellep, Simmons solicited support
for his own slate of directors, including John Tower, former head
of the Senate Armed Services Committee, and retired Adm. Elmo R.
Zumwalt Jr., the former chief of naval operations and former member
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
   Tellep and Simmons spent Wednesday the same way they have spent
most of the past few weeks: trying to persuade big pension funds
and other institutional investors that their strategies would serve
the companies best.
   Historically, few proxy battles have succeeded in unseating
directors. However, Harris and other analysts said Simmons has made
surprisingly strong inroads into the ranks of the institutional
investors, who hold 60 percent of Lockheed's shares.
   Simmons' chief coup was persuading California's huge public
employees' pension fund, known as Calpers, to vote its nearly 1
percent of Lockheed shares for him, Harris said. Calpers has led
institutional investors in pressing for more control over companies
they own, and its defection was seen as likely to influence other
big investors.
   ``I still think the incumbent will win the proxy fight,'' said
Harris. ``But given the indication by Calpers recently, it probably
will be closer than I had anticipated.''
   He noted that under Simmons' assault, Tellep had made
concessions to shareholders, saying he would appoint at least one
representative of shareholder groups to the board after today.
   ``The company is sensitive to some of criticisms Mr. Simmons has
made and may pay closer attention to ... return on investment,
earnings per share and cash flow,'' Harris said.
   However, he said that without the speculative interest stirred
up by Simmons, Lockheed shares would be selling for less than their
$36.87{ closing price Wednesday. ``I believe the shares would be
fairly priced in the $30-$32 range.''
   Lockheed stock sold for as high as $54.75 a share last year but
has fallen along with other defense stocks amid expectations of a
steep drop in military spending.
   Martin characterized Tellep's overtures to shareholders as
``deals cut at the last minute for votes.''
   ``We feel very good about the response we're getting from
institutions and we're very hopeful about the outcome,'' he said.
   Asked if he were surprised by the strength of Simmons'
challenge, Tellep said early this week: ``I think that he's waged a
strong campaign. It will be up to the institutions to decide how
strong it is.''

   Hearst Corp. announced Thursday that Gilbert
Maurer, executive vice president of the corporation and president
of its magazine division, had been named chief operating officer of
the parent company.
   Maurer, 61, will retain his title as executive vice president
but will give up the post with Hearst Magazines Division, which
publishes 15 consumer magazines including Cosmopolitan, Good
Housekeeping, Victoria and Country Living.
   D. Claeys Bahrenburg, 42, has been named to replace Maurer as
president of the magazine division. He had been executive vice
president and group publishing director at Hearst Magazines.
   The appointments were announced by Frank A. Bannack Jr.,
president and chief executive of Hearst Corp., which also has
interests in newspapers, radio and television stations, books, TV
programs and cable TV networks.
   Bennack said Maurer did an outstanding job in his 18 years as an
executive at the magazine division, and noted that since Maurer
took over as president of the unit in 1976, the group launched or
acquired six magazines, circulation grew by more than 8 million
copies a month and ad revenues grew more than four times.
   ``I believe he is eminently qualified to share with me the most
important processes of decision making, planning and general
management responsibilities for the whole The Hearst Corporation as
it is structured at the beginning of this new decade of the '90s,''
Bennack said in a statement.
   Bahrenburg was named to his current posts at the magazine
division in 1987. He joined Hearst Magazines in 1981 as publisher
of House Beautiful and became publisher of Cosmpolitan in 1984.
   Before joining Hearst, he was associate publisher of Rolling
Stone for five years and was a sales representative at the Saturday
Review and The New York Times.

   Consumer spending narrowed to a 0.4 percent
increase in February, the government said Thursday.
   Analysts blamed weak car sales for the slowdown, and some said
buying momentum was building in other areas of the economy.
   The Commerce Department said personal consumption totaled a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of $3.63 trillion, the smallest
increase since a 0.3 percent gain in October.
   Consumer spending, which accounts for about two-thirds of the
nation's economic activity, jumped 1 percent in December and
January. The January increase was even stronger than the 0.6
percent originally reported.
   Personal income rose 0.9 percent, to a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of $4.64 trillion, after a 0.7 percent increase in
January, which was revised down slightly from 0.8 percent first
reported. The February income gain matched a 0.9 percent advance
November.
   ``The spread between income and consumption growth in the near
term is a negative (for the economy), because consumers have buying
power but are not unleashing it,'' said Michael P. Niemira, an
economist with the Mitsubishi Bank in New York.
   ``But over the longer term, building up savings is a positive
for future consumption growth,'' he said.
   The spread contributed to a savings rate of 5.7 percent _
savings as a percent of disposable income _ compared with a 5.3
percent rate in January.
   The increase in personal consumption, which includes everything
except interest payments on debt, totaled $15.9 billion.
   Spending on durable goods _ expensive items expected to last
more than three years _ dropped $14.6 billion, due in part to weak
car sales.
   ``Autos were still a depressant going into March,'' Niemira
said. ``But, on the other hand, department store sales were doing
quite well in March.
   ``There seems to be a momentum that is building in the
non-automotive area. Consumer confidence is up'' in recent surveys,
he said.
   Purchases of non-durable goods gained $10.9 billion, while
spending on services rose $19.6 billion.
   ``The February and January increases in personal income were
affected by several special factors,'' the department said,
including farm subsidies that both raised the February change and
lowered the January change.
   ``A pay raise for federal government employees raised the
changes in both months,'' it said. ``The January change was also
boosted by cost-of-living adjustments to several transfer payment
programs and was lowered by an increase in personal contributions
to social insurance.''
   Payroll increases were spread through all industry categories,
it said. Government payrolls also were up, reflecting the federal
pay raise.
   The report said Americans' incomes after taxes rose 0.9 percent
in February, up from 0.8 percent the previous month.
   The key component of the income category, wages and salaries,
jumped $23.5 billion at a seasonally adjusted annual rate.

<HEAD>Smaller Firms Show Signs of Recovering From Crash</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As Wall Street's big investment houses rein in
their payrolls and egos during a broad consolidation, the nation's
regional firms are recovering steadily from the 1987 stock market
crash.
   Profits slumped 28 percent industrywide last year but doubled at
the smaller regional firms, which specialize in trading stocks and
bonds for individual investors and operate in limited geographic
areas.
   The reasons: regionals didn't expand like the major houses
during the heady 1980s, have lower overhead costs and rely on
customer service rather than on marketing newfangled investment
products.
   ``Turning the battleship around is always a lot more difficult
than turning a speedboat around,'' Raymond ``Chip'' Mason, chairman
of Legg Mason Wood Walker Inc. in Baltimore, said Thursday.
   Fourth-quarter performance showed regional superiority: the
industry lost $92 million, while regionals made $12.3 million. The
overall loss was the first since 1987's fourth quarter, when the
stock market crashed.
   Preliminary figures show that for all of 1989 the industry made
$1.8 billion, down 28 percent from $2.5 billion in 1988. Regional
income rose to $215 million, but still was the third lowest in the
1980s and far short of the record $546 million in 1986.
   Since the crash, all forms of business are down, from mergers
and securities underwriting, which fueled Wall Street's boom, to
stock market activity that regionals rely on for retail brokerage
business.
   But regionals such as Legg Mason; A.G. Edwards &amp; Sons Inc. in
St. Louis; Piper, Jaffray &amp; Hopwood Inc. in Minneapolis; and
Raymond, James &amp; Associates Inc. in St. Petersburg, Fla. all
reported record 1989 earnings.
   The nation's two biggest securities firms, Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.
and Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., which have huge retail networks,
both had disappointing years. Together they have laid off more than
5,000 employees in recent months. Shearson recently closed 50
retail offices.
   ``The bigger firms wanted to become financial supermarkets and I
think they're backing away from that now,'' said Carter Jones,
executive vice president of Boettcher &amp; Co., a Denver-based
brokerage. ``We don't seem to be facing the same trauma
financially.''
   Disgust with Wall Street engendered by publicity about turmoil
at Shearson, the collapse of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. and
problems at companies financed by junk bonds also may steer
investors to local brokerage firms, analysts said.
   A public perception of greed on Wall Street _ fueled by current
best-sellers such as ``Barbarians at the Gate'' and ``Liar's
Poker'' _ doesn't help.
   ``In the '90s the client is going to be attracted to service,''
Jones said. Regionals are ``already doing that and it's easier for
them to move to that if they're not.''
   Long-term relationships with brokers are more likely to be found
at a regional firm, analysts said.
   ``Joe trusts Bill and Bill's going to get the business,'' said
Donald F. Howard, deputy chairman of Gray Judson &amp; Howard, a
Cambridge, Mass., firm that consults for regional brokerages.
   Securities executives and analysts said with Wall Street layoffs
soaring _ total industry employment is down by more than 40,000
since the crash _ regionals are hiring top-flight brokers from
large firms.
   Boettcher, a subsidiary of Kemper Financial Companies Inc. of
Chicago, has added about 90 brokers in the last 15 months, many
from major brokerages, boosting its staff to 300. Legg Mason has
hired nearly 200 brokers in the last three years.
   Honing broker skills and improving relationships appears to be
paying off. Productivity per broker increased to $169,000 in
commissions generated at regional firms last year from $140,000 in
1988.
   Still, a slow stock market is slow for everyone. Average daily
volume on the New York Stock Exchange so far this month is 151
million shares, down from 165 million last year and 5.6 percent
below the Big Board's 1990 projection.
   But in a Securities Industry Association survey, 83 percent of
35 regional executives said the 1990s will be good for retail. The
graying of America, with the oldest baby boomers hitting age 45
next year, was cited as a factor that will help.
   ``They are moving into their prime savings and investment
years,'' Adrian L. Banky, an SIA executive vice president, told a
regional brokerages' conference in Chicago Wednesday. ``They are
becoming our kind of people.''

<TEXT>
   House members clashed Thursday over
establishing minimum standards for day-care centers and subsidizing
church-run centers as they began debate on competing versions of
major child-care legislation.
   Their disputes obscured earlier bipartisan agreement on key
portions of the bills, however, and came as the White House renewed
its threat to veto the more ambitious Democratic proposal.
   Both versions would expand tax credits for poor working families
that have child-care expenses and create a system of state-issued
subsidy vouchers for parents who want to use religious day-care
centers. Both would expand the Head Start program for poor children.
   The more expensive, Democratic version would go further to
establish minimum standards and provide money for a new program of
day care based in public schools.
   ``The time has come for us to put our money where our mouths
are,'' said Rep. Thomas Downey, D-N.Y., a sponsor of the Democratic
version. ``Children are our most important national resource in our
country, and for too long we have neglected them.''
   Republicans said the more expensive Democratic plan would face a
veto by President Bush.
   ``This bill does not pay as you go; it spends as they went,''
said Rep. Bill Frenzel, R-Minn. ``What a wierd, tortured way of
taking care of children _ by giving them an IOU for $30 billion.''
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, meanwhile, said Bush
would veto the Democratic version if enacted. The White House's
budget office issued a statement calling the Democratic version
``an exercise in fiscal irresponsibility.''
   Fourteen Democratic governors and one Republican, Gov. John R.
McKernan Jr. of Maine, signed a letter to House Speaker Thomas
Foley endorsing the leadership's version of the child-care bill and
opposing a proposed conservative alternative.
   The House planned a vote on the alternative, sponsored by Reps.
Charles Stenholm, D-Texas, and Clay Shaw, R-Fla., and backed by the
White House.
   The House defeated on a 243-182 vote a Democratic amendment that
would have made the voucher system optional for states. It faced
another that would prohibit subsidies for church-run centers that
offer religious instruction.
   Republicans attacked the Democratic version because it instructs
states to set minimum standards for day-care centers, including a
requirement that day-care workers receive 15 hours of training a
year.
   Rep. Thomas Tauke, R-Iowa, charged the regulatory requirements
``reduce the choices available to parents'' and harm church-run
centers.
   Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., said Congress has passed
regulations for the handling of farm animals and should do no less
for children.
   ``This is not a philosophical argument,'' Miller said. ``This is
an attack on America's children and quality child care.''
   The cause of child care has been embraced by both political
parties, with President Bush supporting some form of increased
assistance to parents during his 1988 presidential campaign. But
the bills bogged down in Congress last year amid partisan and
internal disputes.
   ``If the child-care legislation were an actual child, Congress
would be charged with abuse and neglect,'' said Rep. Olympia Snowe,
R-Maine.
   The Senate approved its version of a child-care bill last year,
when the House approved conflicting versions. The latest House
action was an effort to reach a new position going into a
conference with the Senate, where a final version will be forged.
   ``The conference report will reflect a broad, multi-faceted
approach to child care which, I believe, the president will sign,''
said Foley, D-Wash.
   A principal difference between the two versions centered around
school-based day care. The Democrats would provide federal funds
for school systems to set up programs of year-round, before- and
after-school care, and pre-school care for 3- and 4-year-olds,
based in the public schools.
   The Democrats' version gives conservatives much of what they
wanted on the issue of religious care. It requires states to
provide subsidy vouchers to families that want them for use in
sectarian day-care centers, including those that offer religious
instruction and discriminate based on church membership or tenets.
   The Stenholm-Shaw version would not set minimum standards for
day care. It would create an additional tax credit for families
with infants.
   Both child-care packages would be financed in part by ending the
existing dependent care tax credit for upper-income families. That
credit would be reduced for families earning $70,000 a year and
eliminated for those earning more than $90,000.

   Japanese business executives once thought they
could solve their image problems in the United States by making
corporate charitable donations and hiring lobbyists to represent
them in Washington.
   Now, in response to accusations that Tokyo has been buying
support from U.S. officials and academics, some Japanese protest
what they call a ``Japan-lobby hunt'' reminiscent of McCarthyist
anti-communist campaigns.
   The criticism, they say, is souring constructive ties between
the world's two largest economic powers.
   ``Why pick on us? The consultants and lawyers who have the
misfortune of representing a currently unpopular ally are the very
people that senior business executives and government officials in
Japan have lent an ear to,'' said Kazuo Nukazawa, managing director
of Keidanren, or the Federation of Economic Organizations, Japan's
most powerful business group.
   ``Today's trade policy McCarthyites seem determined to ostracize
those scarce few who have experience and expertise on the country
the U.S. has serious business negotiations with,'' he wrote in a
recent commentary in the Japan Times newspaper.
   Other Japanese also express frustration over accusations in the
United States that many American trade negotiators and scholars are
suspiciously vulnerable to Japanese influence.
   The debate was created largely by a Jan. 22 article in The New
Republic, a prominent American magazine, titled ``The Japanese
Megaphone: Tokyo's Americans That Say Yes.''
   In it, author John B. Judis wrote that the hundreds of millions
of dollars funneled by Japanese corporations to U.S. think tanks
and lobbyists are ``tilting the debate about America's economic
future without the public being aware of it.''
   ``Japan has assembled a virtual who's who of lobbyists and
advisers in Washington,'' Judis wrote. ``This army of lobbyists and
advisers furnishes Japanese companies with the troops necessary to
win battles in Washington.''
   Such charges have generated ``a `Japanologist hunt' reminiscent
of a McCarthyist `Red hunt,''' Tetsuya Shibayama wrote in a recent
issue of the weekly Asahi Journal, alluding to Sen. Joseph
McCarthy's diatribes over what he saw as Communist subversion of
the U.S. government circles in the 1950s.
   Shibayama blamed the problem on what he calls Japanese ignorance
of exactly how their wealth and power are perceived overseas.
   One of Japan's top authorities on the issue agrees.
   ``Japanese companies spare no expense to hire big names, but
often their money is wasted,'' said Masatake Takahashi, a
commentator who has published several books on lobbying in the
United States.
   ``I keep telling executives of companies they should be more
selective. They're being criticized mainly because their approach
is wrong. You have to know how to use lobbyists properly or it's
not worth the trouble and expense,'' he said.
   Japanese officials at several major companies declined to
comment on the issue.
   ``Our activities are mainly community oriented. We commit 0.1
percent of our total sales to grass-roots activities, and we make
academic contributions to professorships at top universities. But
we have no particular comment on lobbying activities,'' said Akira
Nagano, spokesman at Matsushita Electronic Industrial Co., maker of
major electronics brands like National and Panasonic.
   The accusations of excessive Japanese influence have led to
congressional hearings on tightening U.S. control of foreign
agents, with emphasis on lobbyists for Japanese business.
   Unlike the U.S. Congress, Japan's Parliament does not have
institutionalized lobbies, and influential Japanese rarely accept
requests to lobby on behalf of foreign interests.
   The American tobacco, pharmaceutical, rice and electronics
industries have offices working on their behalf in Tokyo. They, and
executives at major U.S. firms like IBM and AT&amp;T, have managed to
cultivate support for easing restrictive regulations through
practices similar to lobbying.
   But they keep a much lower profile than lobbyists in Washington.
   ``American firms mistakenly have paid little attention to
getting things done through private discussions with elected
officials,'' said John P. Stern, executive director of the U.S.
Electronics Industry Japan Office and perhaps Tokyo's best-known
U.S. lobbyist.
   Stern said the criticism of the Japanese lobby in the United
States is understandable.
   ``The main reason it's subject to so much criticism is it's so
huge,'' he said. ``It is used to stifle American misgivings about
Japan and to drown out American voices. It's properly the subject
of criticism.''
   Nukazawa, however, said those criticizing Japan's lobbyists are
using ``smear tactics'' to force U.S. officials to adopt tougher
attitudes toward Tokyo in trade disputes.
   He said criticism of Japanese corporate contributions to U.S.
academic and research institutions could backfire if the donors
reconsider their generosity.
   ``Some in Tokyo who have responded positively to past
solicitations are now saying that if the U.S. starts pointing
fingers at Japanese contributors, it is a situation of `damned if
you do, damned if you don't,'' he said.

   Stock prices posted their first loss of the week
Thursday in light selling attributed to worries about rising
interest rates.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had risen 39.41
points over the previous three sessions, dropped back 15.99 to
2,727.70.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 3 to 2 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
584 up, 861 down and 518 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 132.19 million
shares, down from 142.30 million in the previous session.
Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 159.53 million shares.
   Interest rates rose Thursday in the market for U.S. Treasury
securities. Prices of the longest-term government bonds dropped
more than $10 for each $1,000 in face value, putting their yields
in the 8.59 percent-8.63 percent range.
   Analysts said the activity in bonds continued to reflect worries
that an apparently budding revival in economic growth might tend to
push rates higher in the months ahead.
   The latest figures from the Commerce Department, issued on
Wednesday, showed a slightly stronger pace of business activity
during the fourth quarter of last year than had been previously
estimated.
   Brokers also noted a downturn for the dollar against the
Japanese yen in foreign exchange. A recent rise in the dollar had
been cited as a plus for U.S. interest rates, in part by serving to
attract foreign investors into American securities.
   Thursday's losers among the blue chips included Procter &amp;
Gamble, down | at 68\; Coca-Cola, down &rsqb; at 75{; General Electric,
down &rsqb; at 64{; American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, down \ at 42|, and
International Paper, down } at 51&lsqb;.
   Amax, up 2| points Wednesday on takeover speculation, rose
another \ to 28~ as the most active Big Board issue.
   Curtiss-Wright, also a subject of much takeover conjecture,
gained 1} to 65\.
   Bairnco tumbled 3{ to 10 for the day's biggest percentage loss.
On Wednesday the company said new uncertainties about its finances
had been raised by asbestos claims against its wholly-owned Keene
Corp. subsidiary.
   Intertan Inc., which estimated a 50 percent earnings decline for
the fiscal quarter ending this week, slumped 4{ to 36|.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $9.36 billion, or 0.28
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped .60 to 187.17.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 1.39 to 395.42, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index was down 1.21 at 340.79.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market
dropped 1.27 to 435.42. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index closed at 360.23, down 1.00.

<HEAD>UAL Non-Union Workers Hire Legal Help In Buyout Talks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   UAL Corp.'s non-union employees are seeking legal
advice after failing to arrange discussions with union workers who
are trying to put together an employee buyout of the airline.
   The move, revealed in an internal UAL newsletter, appears to
signal resentment among the company's nearly 26,000 management and
salaried workers, who face certain wage and benefit cuts if the
buyout of United Airlines' parent succeeds.
   Meanwhile, UAL Chairman Stephen Wolf is likely to come
face-to-face with employee frustration in a series of meetings
announced Thursday in a company newsletter.
   In Wednesday's edition of the newsletter, the company said
representatives of non-union workers had authorized their financial
adviser, First Chicago Corp., to negotiate on their behalf with the
buyout group.
   The company also said First Chicago had retained the New York
law firm of Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver and Jacobson to provide
legal advice to the non-union group.
   According to the newsletter, First Chicago told non-union
representatives it had been unable to determine the fairness of the
union group's $4 billion acquisition plan. First Chicago said it
would continue its efforts to initiate a dialogue with the union
leaders and their advisers, the newsletter stated.
   The union group, representing United's pilots, machinists and
flight attendants, proposed on March 19 a buyout estimated at $185
a share that would give UAL's entire work force 75 percent
ownership of the company. The three union groups represent about
two-thirds of the company's 71,000 employees.
   UAL stock closed at $159 Thursday in New York Stock Exchange
trading, down $1.87{.
   The union bid is supported by UAL's largest shareholder, the New
York investment firm Coniston Partners, which is threatening to
wage a proxy fight to oust the company's directors at an April 26
shareholders meeting.
   UAL's board met Wednesday to discuss the bid but has not issued
a statement about the meeting.
   In documents filed earlier this month with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, the union group stated that non-union
employees would provide $55 million in wage and benefit cuts in the
buyout's first year. The SEC filing did not disclose the value of
wage-and-benefit concessions that the union group has offered to
make in proposed five-year contracts.
   Wolf is on a tour of United facilities in seven U.S. cities to
meet with employees and answer questions about the company's future.
   The newsletter said Wolf met Wednesday with more than 3,000
employees in San Francisco and would meet with more employees
Friday in Washington. Meetings are planned next month in Honolulu,
Los Angeles, Denver, Boston and Newark, N.J.

<HEAD>IBM Chairman's 1989 Pay Reflected The Company's Sagging Fortunes</HEAD>

   IBM Chairman John Akers' pay was cut last year
as the computer giant's profit tumbled, according to IBM's annual
proxy statement.
   But although Akers' compensation was shaved, the 3 percent
reduction didn't compare with the 35 percent earnings slide at
International Business Machines Corp.
   IBM's 1989 profit totaled $3.76 billion, compared with $5.81
billion in 1988. The company blamed a costly restructuring plan and
unfavorable currency exchange rates for most of the decline.
   Akers received $1,420,713 cash and IBM stock worth $519,976,
bringing his total compensation as head of the world's largest
computer company to $1,940,689, according to the statement.
   In 1988, Akers received $2,000,500 in cash and stock. That was
the first year his pay exceeded $2 million, said IBM spokesman
Peter Thonis.
   Thonis said the company's profitability was just one factor in
setting Akers' salary.
   ``His pay isn't just a reflection of the year,'' but includes
other factors, such as the company's long-term management, Thonis
said. In addition, the chairman's compensation is kept competitive
with that of heads of other major corporations, he said.
   The pay and bonuses of IBM's top executives are set by the
Executive Compensation Committee, a group of the company's board of
directors that are not covered by the compensation plan.
   Akers' actual salary last year was $712,500. The remainder of
Akers' compensation came from IBM's ``long-term performance plan,''
adopted by stockholders last year to reward executives ``whose
performance ... can have a significant effect on the success of the
company,'' according to the proxy statement.
   Akers received a cash award of $708,213 under this plan. He also
received the $519,976 in stock under the plan, which he must
forfeit if he leaves the company within the next two years,
according to the plan's terms.
   None of IBM's executives received cash or stock last year under
IBM's ``variable compensation plan,'' which is closely linked to
the company's fortunes. In 1988 and 1987, Akers received a combined
$1,776,812 under the plan.
   IBM President Jack Kuehler received total compensation last year
of $1,179,000, according to the proxy statement, down from
$1,195,000 in 1988.

   Assets of the nation's 506 money market mutual
funds fell $522.1 million in the latest week to $391.62 billion,
the Investment Company Institute said Thursday.
   The decline in the seven-day period ended Wednesday followed a
$1.1 billion rise in fund assets the previous week to a record high
of $392.14 billion.
   The week-earlier figures originally were reported as a rise of
$199.04 million to an all-time high of $391.23 billion but the
Washington-based mutual fund trade group subsequently revised those
totals.
   The institute said that in the latest week, assets of 246
general purpose funds rose $495.6 million to $133.87 billion,
assets of 102 broker-dealer funds dropped $414.0 million to $166.36
billion, and assets of 158 institutional funds declined $603.7
million to $91.39 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds rose in
the week ended Tuesday to 7.69 percent from 7.67 percent the
previous week, said Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade journal
based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield rose to 7.66 percent from 7.65 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
45 days, up from 44 days, Donoghue's said.
   The newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of 100 leading
commercial banks, savings and loan associations and savings banks
in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the effective annual
yield available on money market accounts was 6.25 percent as of
Wednesday, unchanged from a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super
NOW accounts, fell to 5.05 percent from 5.06 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 7.89
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, up from 7.88 percent
the previous week. Yields were 8.02 percent on 1-year CDs, up from
8.01 percent; 8.04 percent on 2{-year CDs, up from 8.01 percent;
and 8.08 percent on 5-year CDs, up from 8.06 percent.

<HEAD>Mobil To Delete References To Bag Degradability</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JULIA C. MARTINEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mobil Corp., targeted by environmentalists for
alleged misleading advertising, said Thursday it no longer will
refer to its Hefty trash bags as degradable.
   But the head of a task force of state attorneys general
investigating deceptive advertising and packaging by Mobil and
other companies claimed the oil giant merely was trying to deflect
potential liability ahead of a scheduled negotiating session next
week.
   ``People need to know this didn't come out of the blue,'' said
Hubert Humphrey III, Minnesota's attorney general. ``It comes as
the result of a meeting two weeks ago with state and federal
agencies that are very much looking at enforcement action.''
   Mobil has been criticized for advertising on its Hefty trash
bags that claims the product decomposes ``after exposure to
elements like sun, wind and rain.''
   Environmentalists say the reference to degradability is
misleading because more than 80 percent of trash bags are not
exposed to sunlight long enough to degrade but end up in dry
landfills that rarely are exposed to sunlight.
   In Thursday's announcement, Mobil said its chemical division
would continue making Hefty trash bags with an ``environmentally
safe additive'' that speeds their decomposition when exposed to
sunlight. But the company will delete the references to
degradability on the packaging.
   Mobil spokesman Allen Gray said Mobil Chemical Co. was taking
the action in response to ``mounting confusion'' regarding the
definition of degradability.
   Gray conceded that, ``If left out in Arizona somewhere a bag
with the additive can quickly decompose in a couple of months, but
in a northern climate like Chicago it could take well over a year.''
   Nontheless, Gray said claims that the bags degrade in sunlight
have been ``fully substantiated'' by tests and that the company
never said the bags would be the answer to the country's waste
disposal problem.
   Humphrey and other task force members said Mobil's action could
send a signal to other companies making similar claims.
   ``This retreat by Mobil, however admirable, is just the opening
victory for New York and other states in our war over dishonest
advertising claims about the environmental benefits of certain
products,'' Robert Abrams, New York's attorney general, said in a
prepared statement.
   Gray said the company began marketing the degradable bags
because of competitive pressures. He said the phaseout of the
labeling was expected to take several months.
   Mobil officials are scheduled to meet Monday in St. Louis with
legal representatives from the eight-state task force, including
California, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Missouri, New York, Texas,
Washington and Wisconsin. Humphrey said Mobil may be subject to
fines or further injunctive relief, including a binding legal
agreement to halt similar advertising on other Mobil products, such
as styrofoam plates and plastic grocery bags.
   Officials from the Federal Trade Commission, which joined the
investigation earlier this month, are expected to attend the
meeting, said Ed Barbini, spokesman for Abrams.
   FTC Chairman Janet Steiger said earlier this month the agency
had joined the task force to determine whether environmental claims
made by various products _ from trash bags to hair spray _ could be
substantiated.
   No other companies have been named by the task force or the FTC,
although several companies are under investigation.

<HEAD>Supply Fears Keep Cocoa Futures Climbing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Cocoa futures prices surged to new seven-month highs Thursday on
New York's Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa Exchange on persistent speculation
that economic turmoil in Brazil and the Ivory Coast could cause
significant supply disruptions.
   On other markets, livestock and meat futures mostly were lower;
grains and soybeans advanced; precious metals rose; and energy
futures were mixed.
   Cocoa futures settled $21 to $27 higher with the contract for
delivery in May at $1,190 per ton, the highest settlement of a
near-month cocoa contract since Aug. 16.
   The rally followed a rise of $47 in the May contract on
Wednesday.
   Analyst Harry Schwartz of Cargill Investor Services Inc. said
most of the buying was again by speculators and for the same
reasons as on Wednesday: fears of supply disruptions from the
world's two largest cocoa producers.
   No disturbances were reported Thursday in the Ivory Coast, the
No. 1 cocoa grower, after Wednesday's violent confrontation between
police and demonstrators in Abidjan, the capital of the West
African nation.
   Last year's collapse of cocoa prices to 14-year lows was
disastrous for the Ivory Coast. Citizens recently have been calling
for the resignation of 30-year President Felix Houphouet-Boigny,
who has ordered strict austerity measures to save the country from
bankruptcy.
   Meanwhile, cocoa movement out of Brazil remained extremely slow
amid continuing confusion about economic reform measures introduced
two weeks ago in an attempt to halt hyperinflation.
   Schwartz discounted fears of supply disruptions.
   ``In the fullness of time, Brazil will get its house in order
and start exporting again,'' he said.
   He noted there had been no indication of shipping halts in the
Ivory Coast and said the price rise could trigger the release of
``a significant amount'' of Ivorian cocoa in storage outside the
country as well as hedge selling of futures by the cocoa trade.
   ``I haven't seen any concrete evidence of anything occurring
other than apprehension about what could happen,'' he said.
   Livestock and meat futures fell on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, led by the pork markets on selling ahead of Friday's
quarterly Agriculture Department hogs-and-pigs inventory report.
   The report is expected to show a 2.6 percent decline in U.S. hog
herd but analysts said market gains earlier this week may have
overestimated the bullishness of the report.
   Live cattle futures settled .33 cent lower to .03 cent higher
with April at 77.75 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .08 cent to
.45 cent lower with March at 82.67 cents a pound; live hogs were
.05 cent to .57 cent lower with April at 52.90 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .25 cent to 1.10 cents lower with May at
53.12 cents a pound.
   Most grain and soybean futures advanced on the Chicago Board of
Trade, largely reflecting expectations for a bullish USDA report on
spring planting intentions.
   The report, scheduled for release after the close, is expected
to show that farmers plan to sow more corn than last year while
cutting back on soybean and spring wheat acreage.
   Wheat futures settled 1 cent lower to 3 cents higher with May at
$3.53 a bushel; corn was { cent to } cent higher with May at $2.60
a bushel; oats were 1\ cents to 1} cents higher with May at $1.46}
a bushel; soybeans were } cent to 4 cents higher with May at $5.89{
a bushel.
   Precious metals edged higher on New York's Commdodity Exchange
as the dollar weakened against most major currencies.
   Gold settled $1.70 to $1.90 higher with April at $370.80 a troy
ounce; silver was 2.9 cents to 3.1 cents higher with April at
$4.946 a troy ounce.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate
crude oil settled 5 cents lower to 13 cents higher with May at
$20.03 a barrel; heating oil was .06 cent to .44 cent higher with
April at 56.17 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .22 cent to
.60 cent higher with April at 57.67 cents a gallon.

   Energy futures prices ended mixed in moderate
trading Thursday, with crude oil under pressure from short-term
softening in demand.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the May contract for West
Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil, lost 5
cents to close at $20.03.
   June and July crude also posted small declines while later
months rose.
   Among refined products traded on the exchange, April wholesale
unleaded gasoline rose 0.22 cent to 57.67 cents a gallon, May
advanced 0.55 cent to 65.11 cents and June added 0.37 cent to 63.94
cents a gallon.
   Heating oil for delivery in April gained 0.44 cent to finish at
56.17 cents a gallon. The May contract ended at 53.78 cents, up
0.28 cent and June rose 0.35 cent to settle at 52.95 cents a gallon.
   Analysts said crude oil prices remained under pressure from
slackening seasonal demand and building inventories.
   Conversely, gasoline and heating oil supplies have declined due
partly to the slowdown in refinery operations since last month for
annual maintenance and repairs.
   ``Crude still looks heavy because of high inventories,'' said
Tom Bentz, director of futures trading for United Energy Inc.
   However, Bentz said, the market may soon stage a reversal as
refineries step up operations in time for the spring driving season.

<HEAD>Hanson Buys The Rest of Peabody for $715 Million</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hanson PLC said Thursday it would take full
control of the United States' biggest coal producer by buying
Newmont Mining Corp.'s 55 percent stake in Peabody Holding Co. for
$715 million.
   The British conglomerate bought a 45 percent stake in Peabody
for $504 million last month.
   Newmont, which is 49 percent owned by Hanson, said the sale
would yield about $600 million after taxes and expenses and help it
to reduce its debt.
   ``The sale of our Peabody shares will not only realize a fair
price, but it will also achieve Newmont's basic objective to reduce
debt to appropriate levels,'' Gordon R. Parker, chairman, president
and chief executive of Newmont, said in a statement released from
the company's Denver headquarters.
   Peabody has excellent cash flow and coal should continue to be
an important long-term source of energy in the United States, said
Sir Gordon White, chairman of Hanson's U.S. arm, Hanson Industries.
   New technologies also are likely to increase coal's efficiency
as a low-cost fuel, White said.
   Completion of the transaction is subject to regulatory approvals
as well as approval by Newmont shareholders.
   Hanson bought its original 45 percent stake in Peabody last
month from Boeing Co., Bechtel Investments Inc., and an energy
company, Eastern Enterprises.
   Peabody last year mined about 87 million tons of coal in the
United States, or 9 percent of the country's output. The company
operates in all major U.S. coal areas and has estimated coal
reserves of about 8.3 billion tons.
   Peabody had pretax earnings of $136.5 million on sales of $1.74
billion in 1989. After-tax profit figures were not available,
Hanson said.
   Hanson's main businesses in the United States include SCM
chemicals, Grove cranes, Jacuzzi whirlpools and spas, Kaiser cement
and Ames garden tools.
   For the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, the U.S. businesses had
operating profit of $625 million on sales of $1.62 billion.
   Newmont Mining's principal asset is 90.1 percent of Newmont Gold
Co., the largest North American gold producer. Newmont also has
gold interests in Australia, Papua New Guinea and Indonesia.

<TEXT>
   The two broadest measures of the nation's money
supply rose slightly in the week ended March 19, the Federal
Reserve Board reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 rose $1.5 billion to a
seasonally adjusted $3,271.0 billion from $3,269.5 billion the
previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, rose $600 million to a seasonally
adjusted $4,070.4 billion from $4,069.8 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, remained
virtually unchanged at a seasonally adjusted $802.5 billion, vs.
$802.2 billion the previous week.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted attention from M1 to the two broader money supply measures.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2's growth rate has averaged 6.8
percent, within the Fed annual target range of 3 percent to 7
percent. The growth rate of M3 in the past 13 weeks has been about
3.4 percent, slightly below the Fed annual target range of 3.5
percent to 7.5 percent. The Fed has not set a target for M1 growth
since early 1987.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window, excluding extended credit,
averaged $141 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, down from
$294 million the previous week.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $304.2 billion in the two-week period ended
March 21, up from $301.4 billion two weeks earlier.

<HEAD>Polaroid Announces Reorganization Plan</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JONATHAN YENKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Polaroid Corp., which has been reorganizing since
fending off a hostile takeover effort two years ago, said Thursday
it would take additional steps to restructure itself to boost sales
and respond better to market demands.
   ``The reorganization is a major step in redirecting the company
toward growth,'' said I. MacAllister Booth, president and chief
executive of Cambridge-based Polaroid.
   Polaroid officials said the announcement caps a company-wide
restructuring Polaroid undertook in 1988 while fighting a hostile
takeover attempt by Shamrock Holdings.
   Key elements of the new organization are three business units _
family imaging, business imaging, and technical imaging _ that will
focus on specific markets and product applications.
   Separately, the company will create three major groups that will
provide support in research, sales, and product development and
manufacturing.
   The executives overseeing the business units and support groups
will report directly to a newly created office of the chief
executive officer. Sheldon Buckler, Polaroid's executive vice
president, will join that office and share responsibilities with
Booth.
   Analysts said the changes are important because Polaroid must
show stronger sales growth.
   Polaroid earned $145 million last year, compared with a $22.6
million loss in 1988 during the takeover fight. But sales grew only
2 percent in 1989 to $1.9 billion.
   Analysts said the improved earnings resulted from cost cutting.
To have further increases in profits, the company must accelerate
its sales, they said.
   Eugene Glazer, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., said
the new organization should help accomplish this task by making
Polaroid a more ``market driven company.''
   ``Historically, this company has been research driven,'' he
said, adding that Polaroid's philosophy was ``great inventions
create new markets.''
   An example of Polaroid's new strategy is the way it has marketed
instant photography. The company increasingly has promoted instant
cameras not only for family use, but also for businesses such as
insurance agencies.
   Buckler said, however, the company's direction will not be
dictated completely by market forces.
   ``What you really need is a blend of market drive and technology
drive,'' he said. ``When you combine those forces right, you
getting your batting average way up.''

<HEAD>Discount Broker Raises Commission Rate</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Discount stockbroker Quick &amp; Reilly Inc. said
Thursday it had raised commissions by about $5 a trade, in order to
provide new services for customers.
   Thomas Quick, president of the firm, said the 8 percent increase
was not prompted by the downturn in the retail brokerage industry
stemming from the October 1987 stock market crash.
   Quick said the New York-based firm recently installed a 24-hour
telephone stock quote system for investors in 25 cities and added
free check-writing privileges for money market account clients.
   ``These things cost money,'' Quick said. ``In light of inflation
we didn't feel we were really being piggies.''
   He said the nation's third largest discount brokerage had not
raised its commissions since 1983. The move left Quick &amp; Reilly
commissions still slightly lower than the leaders in the field, San
Francisco-based Charles Schwab &amp; Co. and Boston-based Fidelity
Investments.
   Charles Schwab last raised its commissions by 6 percent in
February 1988 and said it has no plans for another increase. A
spokesman for Fidelity could not be reached for comment.
   Under the change at Quick &amp; Reilly, which took effect Monday,
individual investors will be charged according to the principal
amount of a transaction. Before, Quick &amp; Reilly calculated
commissions based on the number of shares bought or sold and the
price per share.
   Quick said while the average commission was $5 a trade, charges
would be higher for trades involving small principal amounts and
lower for transactions involving high principals.
   Quick &amp; Reilly on Wednesday reported its fourth-quarter profits
rose to $2.52 million, or 27 cents a share, for the period ended
Feb. 28, from $2.09 million, or 22 cents per share, in the same
period a year ago. Revenue rose to $28.3 million from $22.1 million.
   For its full fiscal year, Quick &amp; Reilly's profit increased
about 15 percent to $11.4 million, or $1.21 a share, from $9.97
million, or $1.05 a share. Revenue climbed to $106 million from
$77.6 million a year earlier.
   Discount brokers have reported healthier profits than large Wall
Street firms despite a decline in stock trading activity since the
stock market crash. Disounts have low expenses and benefit from
high business volume because of their relatively lower commission
rates.

   Norton Co.'s board of directors rejected a $1.6
billion buyout offer Thursday from the British conglomerate BTR PLC
and said it might open itself to minority investors and buy back
some of its stock to thwart a takeover.
   But analysts said Norton apparently was trying to raise the BTR
bid, and they expected the company eventually would accept a deal.
   BTR, based in London, announced the $75-per-share offer this
month for Norton, a Worcester, Mass.-based maker of abrasives such
as grinding wheels and sandpaper.
   Since then, Norton stock climbed above that level, and the
company's board described the BTR deal as inadequate. The stock
closed Thursday at $73.87{, down $1.12{ a share, in New York Stock
Exchange trading after the board's announcement.
   John Nelson, Norton's chairman and chief executive officer, also
said the acquisition ``would have a significantly adverse effect on
Norton's employees, suppliers and customers and the communities
served by the company.''
   BTR Chief Executive John Cahill responded with a statement
criticizing the board for ``spurning all our repeated attempts to
meet with it'' and said the company would proceed with its offer.
He urged Norton officials to meet with BTR to ``achieve a friendly
transaction.''
   Alvin Donius, an analyst with Altman Brenner Wasserman &amp; Co. in
New York, said a bidding war likely has just begun.
   ``I think BTR has been holding back,'' he said. ``They have
given body language that they will go higher.
   ``In my judgment, Norton eventually will negotiate with BTR or
with someone else,'' he said. He said the action by Norton's board
was ``to negotiate a better price.''
   BTR has encountered protests from Norton workers and local
officials who fear the company would be dismantled, but BTR
officials have disputed those claims.
   Norton said it needed more time to consider various alternatives
to counter the offer, and as a result the board canceled the
company's annual shareholders meeting scheduled for April 26 and
called for a special shareholders meeting on June 26.
   Nelson said the BTR offer, which was made the day after Norton
mailed its annual meeting notice, apparently was intended to leave
the board ``with the shortest possible amount of time to consider
the offer and develop and explore alternatives.''
   The company said it was discussing with other parties the
possibility of ``strategic, minority investments'' and that it has
approached banks to see whether they might lend money for Norton to
buy its own stock.

<TEXT>
   A former top mortgage-backed securities trader
at Merrill Lynch agreed to a nine-month suspension Thursday to
settle allegations that he made an off-the-books trade that cost
the company $85 million.
   The Securities and Exchange commission announced it had agreed
to accept the settlement offer of Howard A. Rubin, of New York, who
neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing.
   The SEC had accused him, in an administrative action, of failing
to disclose to Merrill Lynch Pierce Fenner &amp; Smith Inc. in 1987
that he had made a $500 million proprietary trade in stripped
mortgage-backed securities.
   Such securities are backed by mortgages but unlike conventional
bonds, the interest and principal are sold off separately.
   The trade obligated Merrill Lynch, which lost approximately $85
million on the deal, to sell $500 million in Government National
Mortgage Association interest-only securities, according to the SEC.
   ``The importance of this case is that if this had happened at a
firm that was not as well capitalized as Merrill Lynch, it would
forced them to liquidate, harming the investing public,'' said
Martin A. Kuperberg, associate regional administrator of the SEC's
New York regional office.
   Rubin, who left Merrill Lynch in 1987, was not available for
comment.
   His lawyer, Ira Lee Sorkin, said that at the time the trade
became known ``there were wild allegations of fraud. This order
today identifies it as a books and records problem _ nothing more _
which he neither admits or denies.''
   In addition to a nine-month suspension from association with any
broker, dealer, investment company, investment adviser or municipal
securities dealer, Rubin will be barred from acting in a
supervisory capacity for at least four years.
   Rubin joined the mortgage trading department at Bear Stearns in
November 1987.
   ``While at Bear Stearns, he has been an exemplary employee,''
the securities firm said in a statement that added: ``We look
forward to his return and reassociation with Bear Stearns in nine
months.''
   At Merrill Lynch, a spokesman, Bill Clark, said: ``We're
gratified that the SEC has imposed a serious sanction which should
serve as a deterrent for this type of conduct.''

   Lockheed Corp. Chairman Daniel Tellep
promised major concessions to big shareholders Thursday but
predicted victory in his battle with Texas investor Harold Simmons
over control of the company.
   ``I'm expecting a clear majority in every category of
shareholder, except of course, Mr. Simmons,'' Tellep said at a news
conference after the aerospace company's annual meeting.
   Simmons, who owns 19 percent of Lockheed, and his chief
strategist, J. Landis Martin, said they believed the contest was
too close to call, although Martin later seemed to acknowledge they
had lost.
   ``It's like a political campaign,'' he said. ``Sometimes you
just have to come back again the next time.''
   Simmons, however, claimed victory in pressuring Tellep to make
concessions to the concerns of big investors seeking more input in
running the company.
   ``I think we achieved an awful lot,'' Simmons said, claiming he
also forced Lockheed to concentrate on profits rather than merely
increasing the amount of business the company does.
   Lockheed spent about $8 million on the proxy battle, while
Simmons said he spent about $6 million. Both sides said they wished
they had not had to do so.
   ``It was a tremendous drain of energy away from running the
company,'' Tellep told reporters.
   During the meeting, held in a giant hangar adjacent to Burbank
Airport, Tellep told shareholders that he met with 70 institutional
investors during the proxy war over the past two weeks and that he
considered it his ``baptism by fire and a highly valuable
experience.''
   Concessions were forced by big pension funds and other
institutional shareholders, many of which defected to Simmons, who
sought to replace Lockheed's board with his representatives.
   Simmons' slate included John Tower, former head of the Senate
Armed Services Committee, and retired Adm. Elmo R. Zumwalt Jr., the
former chief of naval operations and former member of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff.
   Preliminary voting results may be available next week.
   Tellep told the meeting he believes in ``shareholder democracy''
and offered several future concessions, including secret votes if
that is what a significant number of shareholders want.
   Other promises included:
   _A provision to opt out of strict anti-takeover provisions of
law in Delaware, where Lockheed is incorporated. Tellep said that
even if the provision did not pass but there was a ``significant''
minority vote for it, he would recommend that the board support an
amendment at the next meeting to have Lockheed opt out.
   _A promise that he would ask for a list of possible shareholder
representatives to Lockheed's 15-person board and would select up
to three directors from that list. He earlier offered to select
only one.
   _An offer to meet regularly with representatives of Simmons' NL
Industries Inc. to discuss the future of Lockheed.
   Martin and Simmons objected to the way in which some of the
shares belonging to an employees stock ownership plan had been
voted. They said the trustee of the plan, which holds 19 percent of
Lockheed stock, had wrongly voted all the shares even though about
30 percent of the employees failed to vote.
   The 30 percent was voted in proportion with the rest of the
plan's votes, which Lockheed announced late Thursday had gone for
Tellep by more than 90 percent. Martin suggested that if they lost
by a narrow margin, the result might be challenged on those grounds.
   Simmons contends that Lockheed, with a recent history of sagging
earnings and underestimating costs of developing new programs, must
insist on better profits at its non-core businesses or sell them.
   The company portrays Simmons as a corporate raider intent on
personal profit, with no knowledge of how to run Lockheed, the
nation's sixth-largest defense contractor with 1989 sales of $9.9
billion.
   Simmons, who has lost $100 million on his $530 million
investment in Lockheed stock, insists he can better focus the
company and has a good record of profitably running companies he
purchases, including NL Industries, Amalgamated Sugar Co. and
Keystone Steel and Wire Co.
   During the meeting, Simmons and Martin were bombarded with
questions from Lockheed employees and shareholders worried that
Simmons might want to merely dismantle the company for his own
benefit.
   The most vigorous defense of Tellep by an employee came from Bob
Strickland, a worker at Lockheed Aircraft Services in Ontario.
   ``Mr. Tellep and I have one thing in common _ a great love for
our company. Lockheed has always been there for me and now I feel
it's my duty to be there for him,'' Strickland said about voting
his 38 shares for the current board.
   Historically, few proxy battles have succeeded in unseating
directors. However, analysts say Simmons made strong inroads into
the ranks of the institutional investors, who hold 60 percent of
Lockheed's shares.
   Simmons' chief coup was persuading California's huge public
employees' pension fund, known as Calpers, to vote its nearly 1
percent of Lockheed shares for him, said Lawrence Harris, a
securities analyst at the Bateman, Eichler, Hill Richards brokerage
in Los Angeles.
   Calpers has led institutional investors in pressing for more
control over companies they own.

   President Bush's nominee for top savings and
loan regulator appears headed for defeat in the Senate Banking
Committee, the committee chairman said Thursday evening.
   T. Timothy Ryan Jr., a former senior Labor Department official
nominated only last week, met skepticism by committee Demnocrats
during a hearing Wednesday on his nomination as director of the
Treasury Department's Office of Thrift Supervision.
   They questioned his lack of direct experience in banking and
raised concerns about possible conflicts of interest in his work as
a private attorney after leaving government in 1983.
   Sen. Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich., after caucusing with
Democrats on his committee for several hours and consulting the
senior Republican, Sen. Jake Garn of Utah, said in a Senate speech
he did not believe Ryan would win the committee's endorsement.
   ``My sense of the canvass of the votes would be _ and it's not
complete, I have not talked with every member directly _ but I
think that, based on the vote count that I have, that there are not
the votes to confirm this nomination,'' Riegle said.
   Riegle scheduled a vote Friday. An adverse recommendation from
the committee could still be overturned on the floor, but that
would be unusual.
   It was unclear whether the administration would withdraw Ryan's
name. It has had difficulty finding a candidate since M. Danny Wall
announced in early December that he would resign.
   Treasury spokeswoman Desiree Tucker-Sorini said officials had
not discussed what they would do if the committee failed to endorse
Ryan.
   ``We hope he will pass the committee. We stand behind him 100
percent,'' she said.
   The administration has portrayed Ryan as an experienced manager
who supervised 600 attorneys at the Labor Department and a tough
enforcer who helped clean up corruption in the Teamsters Union
Central States Pension Fund.
   Democrats have express dismay with his lack of familiarity with
the thrift industry and questioned whether
   At the department, he helped hire former Attorney General
William B. Saxbe as independent counsel overseeing the pension
fund. After Ryan left the government, Saxbe joined Ryan's firm,
bringing with him hundreds of thousands of dollars in fees from the
fund.

   The first 747 jumbo jet, which changed the look
of jet travel with its huge size and distinctive upper-deck hump,
has flown into retirement, Boeing Commercial Airplane Group said.
   The red-and-white jumbo jet rolled off the assembly line near
Everett on Sept. 30, 1968, made its first flight on Feb. 9, 1969,
and won certification on Dec. 30 that year.
   Boeing has used the aircraft as a test plane for 21 years. Now,
the ``City of Everett'' is being donated to the Museum of Flight in
Seattle.
   Pan American World Airways signed the first contract for 747s,
ordering 25 for a total of $525 million. Today, that amount would
buy four of the jets, Boeing said.
   The test plane's only break in service was from October 1983 to
August 1986, when it was in storage in Las Vegas. It was then sent
to Wichita, Kan., where it was used as a mock-up for two 747-200s
that the Air Force will use to carry the U.S. president and his
staff.
   The plane had only 5,208 hours of flight time. That's very low,
considering a jet in normal commercial service flies 3,000 to 4,000
hours every year, company spokesman Tom Cole said.
   ``But it was tough stuff. They were always putting it into dives
and stalls,'' he said.
   The plane, officially known as RA001, had a short final flight
Wednesday: about 25 miles from Boeing Field in Seattle to Paine
Field, where 747s are built near Everett.
   There, its engines will be taken off and returned to Pratt &amp;
Whitney, which owns them, followed by some restoration work.
   Eventually, the plane will be displayed at the museum's
restoration facility or at a new large-aircraft interpretive center
the museum hopes to build at Paine Field, said Cindy Upthegrove,
the museum's special events manager.
   About 800 747s are in service around the world, Boeing said.

   Former Control Data Corp. chief Robert Price,
whose four-year reign yielded $923.9 million in net losses, has
received $4.24 million in retirement and severance pay and will get
$450,000 a year under a three-year consulting contract, it was
disclosed Wednesday.
   In addition, Price received $1.07 million in bonus income during
the past 3{ years under two separate stock award programs and
possibly could get more bonus money under Control Data's Long-Term
Performance Incentive Plan.
   His pension _ good for the rest of his life _ will bring another
$300,000 a year.
   The compensation was detailed in the company's annual proxy
statement, distributed Wednesday to stockholders, analysts and the
media in advance of the company's May 2 annual shareholder meeting.
   Roger Redmond, a stock analyst for Minneapolis-based Piper
Jaffray &amp; Hopwood Inc., said Price's compensation is excessive
considering the computer company's performance since Price took
control in January 1986.
   Lawrence Perlman replaced Price as chief executive officer in
January after the company posted a net loss of $680.4 million in
1989.
   The company posted $21 million in profits in 1988 and 1987 but
suffered a net loss of $264.5 million in 1986.
   ``Control Data has a history of awarding bonuses arbitrarily,
and that is absolutely incorrect,'' Redmond said. ``Any and all
bonuses should be tied with stockholder equity and company
performance.
   ``It's unconscionable that these senior executives are receiving
that much compensation,'' Redmond said.
   Stockholders and employees complained about the company's
severance agreements at last year's annual meeting, booing retired
deputy chairman Norbert Berg when he was introduced.
   Berg, still a member of the board of directors, received nearly
$4 million under a severance package while the company earned a
mere $1.7 million in 1988.
   Price defended such severance agreements at last year's meeting.
   ``What kind of company is it that doesn't honor its contracts?''
he asked.
   Price did not return a phone call to his office Wednesday. He
retired as an employee on March 15, but the company is providing
him office space and secretarial support under his consulting
contract, the proxy statement said. He also remains chairman of the
board.
   Control Data spokesman Frank Ryan said Price's severance package
was part of a contract signed in 1986 when the company was faced
with an ``arduous'' restructuring.
   ``Certainly over the life of these contracts the stockholders
and Bob would have liked to have seen better performance,'' Ryan
said. ``But having a contract that protects against the risks and
takes into account the tasks before the individual, the contracts
do not seem inappropriate.''
   Price's contract brought him severance pay of $2,774,800, an
amount equal to three times his final annual base pay of $873,600
and the amount of his accrued vacation, according to the proxy
statement.
   He also was entitled to $163,054 in annual supplemental pension,
but elected to receive the lump sum present value of the benefits,
$1,469,932, upon his retirement. The supplemental pension is above
Price's normal annual pension of $300,000, Ryan said.
   Price also had earned options to buy 120,000 shares of Control
Data common stock as of Dec. 31, 1989, but the option price of
$22.27 a share is above the stock's current trading price of $19 to
$20 a share, making the options worthless.
   But if the stock price rises substantially in the next year,
Price would stand to get additional bonus money under the company's
Long-Term Performance Incentive Plan, the proxy statement said.
