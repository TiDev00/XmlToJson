   La moderna Plaza del Mercado de Ponce, que funciona
aqui hace anos con serias dificultades economicas podria ser
privatizada, si el gobierno consigue inversionistas que se hagan
cargo de la estructura, reconocio hoy el Secretario del
Departamento de Comercio, Jorge R. Santiago.
   El funcionario anuncio que la instalacion, que cubre una manzana
en el centro tradicional de Ponce, pierde un millon de dolares al
ano en su operacion y reconocio que esta cifra debe ser absorbida
por su agencia.
   Santiago dijo que la enorme estructura tiene amplios costos que
elevan sus perdidas, entre ellas un sistema de aire acondicionado
central y modernas faciliadades de elevadores y escaleras
electricas.
   ``Esto se planifico asi y hay que bregar con eso'', dijo
Santiago al hablar con periodistas, cuando se le pregunto si las
perdidas de la facilidad son producto de una mala planificacion.
   Santiago reconocio ademas que han fracasado en el pasado
intentos de que companias privadas se encarguen de la operacion de
la plaza, donde operan decenas de pequenos comercios.

   El presidente de la Junta de Libertad Bajo
Palabra, Lorenzo Villalba, anuncio que el proximo ano tratara de
implementar un plan con la Administracion del Derecho al Trabajo
(ADT) para conseguirle empleos a los reclusos que se acojan a los
beneficios de libertad bajo palabra.
   Sostuvo que gran parte del problema de la criminalidad en el
pais se debe al desempleo, al punto de que se requiere que los
reclusos que en el futuro saldran a la calle puedan tener un
trabajo antes de disfrutar de la libertad.
   ``Tenemos un gran ejercito de personas en la calle que estan
empleados en la economia subterranea'', dijo Villalba al anunciar
que ya se reunio con la direccion de ADT para tratar de resolver el
problema de falta de trabajo para los reclusos que se acogen a los
beneficios de libertad bajo palabra de esa agencia.
   Se espera que el proximo ano ADT inicie un plan piloto para
conseguir empleo a las personas liberados bajo los beneficios de la
Junta de Libertad Bajo Palabra.

   MAYAGUEZ (AP) - Un sujeto de 20 anos de edad fue detenido hoy y
acusado en relacion con un incidente donde resulto herida de bala
una mujer de 75 anos de edad que se encontraba en un salon de

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Eastern Europe generally turned its
back on the Soviet Union after the region's Communist rulers bowed
to popular revolt a year ago, but trade and geography make the huge
neighbor impossible to ignore.
   New governments must balance the lingering emotion of revolution
with economic and political reality.
   They rejoice over the departure of Soviet soldiers and the
Warsaw Pact's impending demise, but warily watch the floundering
giant that supplies most of their oil and much of the electricity,
natural gas and timber, and buys their mediocre consumer goods.
   Some East Europeans wonder whether they are trading one form of
domination for another.
   ``It is well known that Hungary's energy supplies are largely
based on Soviet raw materials,'' Laszlo Lengyel, an economist and
political scientist, wrote in the Hungarian labor daily Nepszava.
``There is no need for tanks to maintain their influence in the
region.''
   Anger and distrust toward the Soviet Union are evident among
ordinary people throughout the region.
   In Bulgaria, once the Kremlin's closest ally in the Soviet bloc,
only 30 percent of those polled favored close ties with Moscow and
75 percent were against celebrating Nov. 7, the Soviet Union's
Revolution Day.
   In countries where the study of Russian was required for
generations, hardly anyone seems to understand it. People are
learning English and German instead.
   Statues of Lenin have come down and places named for Soviet
heroes and their local cohorts have been rechristened.
   Andras Hegedues of Hungary, the only living signer of the Warsaw
Pact, feels Eastern Europeans always must keep their powerful
neighbor in mind.
   Even if the Soviet Union disintegrates, Russia, its largest
republic, ``will remain a military power,'' he said.
   Richard Sumann, director of Czechoslovakia's Foreign Investment
Agency, said: ``We must prepare for a situation where the Soviet
republics are independent, or more independent.''
   Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Romania border the Soviet
Union. Bulgaria is tied to the eastern Slavs by language and
custom.
   The Soviet Union says the close ties of four decades were forged
by more than Soviet military might.
   ``Eastern Europe is Eastern Europe, and it will exist as Eastern
Europe forever,'' said Oleg A. Grinevsky, the Soviet delegate to
talks on reducing conventional weapons in Europe. ``We have
historic, economic, and political ties, and it is impossible to
exclude them from everyday life.''
   In addition to most of its oil, Hungary gets about one-third of
its electricity from the Soviet Union. Other Eastern European
countries are equally dependent on the Soviets, with little
opportunity to change.
   Cheap and reliable energy supplies are disappearing along with
Soviet political domination. Beginning in 1991, the Soviets will
demand the market price in dollars for oil delivered to East
European countries instead of the much lower prices by complex
agreements within the Comecon economic alliance.
   Several former Soviet bloc nations sought oil supplies from
Iraq, then the Persian Gulf crisis tightened supplies and drove
prices up. Eastern European countries have pledged to obey the U.N.
sanctions on Iraq.
   Soviet oil supplies to Czechoslovakia this year will be at least
18 million barrels short of the 116 million promised. Poland is
expected to get only 70 million barrels, nearly 20 million less
than expected.
   Hungary and Romania have reeived less electricity from the
Soviet Union than anticipated.
   The Soviet economy is in such chaos that Moscow could not even
promise supplies of chemicals, coal, timber, cellulose, paper
products and consumer goods, said Laszlo Timar, who oversees
Hungary's trade with the Soviet Union.
   ``Their problems and troubles are very big, and we cannot rely
on these problems being solved in a short period,'' Timar said.
   Germany is replacing the Soviet Union as Hungary's main trade
partner, but the Soviets are not likely to fall below second or
third, he said.
   That is a matter of geography. According to Timar, when Hungary
and the others begin paying the world price for Soviet oil, the
Soviets probably will prefer them as customers because pipelines
exist to deliver it.
   When Hungary imposed stiff gasoline price increases in October,
taxi drivers and truckers blocked roads for a weekend, virtually
shutting down the country. The government struck a deal with the
protesters after threatening police or military action.
   Hegedues, who was premier of Hungary at the time of the 1956
uprising against Stalinism, said he felt ``civil war was in the
air'' during the price protests.
   Gasoline price increases in Czechoslovakia set off two rounds of
hoarding this year.
   Czechoslovak officials used looser rules within the Soviet Union
to augment their oil supply. They cut through the Moscow
bureaucracy to swap trucks, buses, bulldozers, cranes and consumer
goods for 3.5 million barrels of oil from the Tyumen region of
Siberia.
   Timar said Hungary was close to an agreement to trade its Ikarus
buses for oil.
   The Soviet Union is a huge, hungry market for machinery,
manufactured items and consumer goods produced in Eastern Europe.
Beginning Jan. 1, that trade also will be conducted primarily in
hard currency.
   Many of the products canno be sold in the West, but East
European countries need to earn convertible currency from them.
   Timar estimated Hungary will lose 20 to 40 percent of its Soviet
business next year, including half of its machinery market, because
Soviet customers will be freer to buy from the West.
   He predicted Hungary will remain a major supplier to the Soviet
Union because ``our products are well known there. We think that
slowly, slowly, our exports will be increased, but they will be
tragically cut back for the time being.''
   Even though Hungarians look west, business will draw them east,
he said: ``There is more personal interest in the West now, but to
make money they will travel to Moscow.''

<HEAD>Gotti Indictment: The Son Also Rises</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Law enforcers say John J. Gotti's indictment
could mean a promotion for his son John, whom they describe as a
quick-fisted, barrel-chested Mafia prince with more brawn than
brains.
   Because most of the top men in the Gambino crime family are
under indictment, behind bars, or both, Gotti ``could very well try
to run the family through his son,'' Jules Bonalovonta, the FBI's
organized crime expert in New York, said in an interview last
month.
   ``Well, nothing could please us more,'' he said. ``You're not
talking about a brain surgeon.''
   Bonalovonta said Gotti recently elevated his 26-year-old son -
known universally as ``Junior'' - to the rank of capo, or captain.
The father was indicted Wednesday on charges that he ordered the
murder of his predecessor, and could be held without bail until his
trial.
   Born Feb. 14, 1964, John A. Gotti was the first child of John J.
and Victoria Gotti. After graduating from a military high school
outside New York City in 1982, he apparently went right into the
family business.
   In 1985, the younger Gotti allegedly slugged an off-duty
policeman who was telephoning for help to break up a fight at a
Queens diner, authorities said.
   In 1986, his driver's license was suspended after he ignored
numerous traffic summonses, authorities said.
   In 1989, he was arrested for beating up three people outside a
Long Island nightclub - one of several such brawls in which he has
been embroiled, usually because one of his friends insulted or
accosted a woman, authorities said.
   But Gotti seemingly inherited his father's talent for dodging
prosecutorial bullets. He was found innocent of the diner assault
after a man he allegedly threatened with a knife claimed to have
kept his eyes closed throughout the fight.
   In the nightclub case, a grand jury refused to indict Gotti
after witnesses said they could not identify any of the assailants.
   The younger Gotti describes himself as president of a Brooklyn
trucking company, but investigators say he has his own crime
``crew'' involved in construction extortion, auto theft,
loansharking and narcotics.
   ``Junior is treated with respect by the other (Mafia) crew
leaders,'' an unidentified law enforcement source told the Daily
News a year ago. ``They kiss him on the cheek like he's somebody
special.''
   But Junior takes orders, too. In a conversation recorded by
investigators, John Gotti complained to his son that one of the
son's friends had dropped Gotti's name in a telephone conversation
about a criminal scheme.
   Gotti told his son the friend should desist or enter the
hospital. ``Before you do anything,'' he said, ``you tell me first.
... Now make sure you see me tomorrow and I'll tell you what I want
you to do there.''
   ``All right,'' the son replied.
   The elder Gotti's lawyer, Bruce Cutler, describes Junior as an
honors student, devoted son and ``health nut'' who has no social
life because he works 14 hours a day as ``a totally legitimate
businessman.''
   As for drugs, Cutler says young Gotti ``won't even take an
aspirin.''
   Although he dresses as flamboyantly as his father, the
5-foot-9-inch Gotti is best known for his muscular physique, the
product of many hours in the weight rooms of various Long Island
health clubs.
   Earlier this year he married Kim Albanese, the daughter of a
carpet installer with no apparent mob ties. His father stayed away
from the ceremony in a successful attempt to make sure journalists
did the same.
   Two months later the new Mrs. Gotti gave birth to a son, John A.
Jr., John J. Gotti's first grandson. The family lives in a split
level house in an expensive waterfront section of the Long Island
suburb of Massapequa.
   Whatever his shortcomings, young Gotti apparently has some sense
of duty. He helps out at his father's annual Fourth of July party
for neighbors of the Gotti crew's Queens clubhouse. ``We don't do
this for ourselves,'' he told a reporter last year. ``I got a house
in the Poconos I'd rather be at.''

   Federal investigators studying a huge
highway pileup reduced the death count from 15 to 13 on Wednesday,
and said it was possible a paper mill added to the dense fog blamed
for the 83-car wreck.
   The confusion over the number of people killed in Tuesday's
crash on Interstate 75 stemmed from problems identifying the
victims, said Robert Barlett, who heads the National Transportation
Safety Board probe.
   More than 50 people were injured in the pileup about 40 miles
north of Chattanooga. Federal investigators did not expect to find
more victims, Barlett said at a news conference in nearby
Cleveland.
   The pileup was caused by two separate chain-reaction crashes in
the same spot of the interstate. Investigators first estimated 75
vehicles were involved, and raised the count to 83 on Wednesday.
   The lead vehicle in the accident on the southbound side of the
road apparently was a truck that had slowed down and was rear-ended
by another truck, said Barlett. A car apparently was the lead
vehicle in the crash on the northbound side, he said.
   ``This was a most unusual fog, very intense, very difficult to
see through,'' said Barlett. He said a fog warning light had been
turned on for southbound lanes but not for northbound traffic.
   Investigators planned to conduct more interviews Thursday, said
Barlett. He said videotapes and computers would be used to help
reconstruct the crash.
   NTSB Vice Chairman Susan Coughlin said earlier that
investigators would be looking at weather, highway design, driver
response and environmental factors.
   Workers removed the last of the wreckage from the scene
Wednesday but the southbound lanes remained closed.
   The rolling stretch of highway has a history of fog-related
accidents and is just north of the Hiwassee River, where Bowater
Southern Industries operates a paper mill east of the highway.
   Ms. Coughlin said investigators would talk to officials at
Bowater and other plants about industry's possible contribution to
the fog.
   But she emphasized that the query was just one part of the
agency's investigation, which she said would take six to nine
months to complete.
   ``To even speculate on anyone's involvement at this point would
simply be prejudicial,'' Ms. Coughlin said.
   A 1978 study done by the University of Tennessee after a similar
accident involving 62 vehicles concluded that the ``primary source
of fog ... appeared to be the Bowater paper plant.''
   Wayne Davis, a civil engineer who directed the study, said
Wednesday that a paper plant by its nature contributes to fog
problems.
   ``A paper plant is a process where you take wood, cook it and
evaporate the water to make paper,'' Davis said. ``A tremendous
amount of water is converted into steam. If you look around the
nation, you will always find the potential for dense fog around
paper plants.''
   Bowater spokeswoman Astrid Sheil said Bowater considered that
study flawed and that Tuesday morning's weather conditions could
have occurred whether the paper plant was nearby or not.
   ``The weather conditions, with the inversion from the hot air
during the day time and the cold ground, trapped the fog in,'' said
Ms. Sheil. ``That is well documented and that's a natural
phenomenon that happens at this time of year, especially in these
areas.
   At least 51 people were taken to hospitals after the crash, and
the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency treated others at the
scene. Six people remained in critical condition Wednesday night.
   ``For three minutes after I stopped, cars kept hitting each
other,'' Virgil Metts, who escaped serious injury, told the
Chattanooga News-Free Press. ``They kept driving into the fog at 60
mph.
   ``It was deadly silent - a real eerie silence. You couldn't see
anything because of the fog, and all you heard was exploding gas
tanks.''
   George and Margaret Dawson were in the southbound lanes Tuesday
in a van packed with valuables for their retirement move from
Michigan to Florida.
   Seconds later, those valuables were scattered across the
highway.
   ``The whole back of the van is gone.'' Mrs. Dawson said. ``But
after seeing some of the other people, we consider ourselves lucky.
What a way to start retirement.''

   An alignment of the planets will
interfere with the Magellan spacecraft's ability to send pictures
of Venus back to Earth for the next six weeks beginning Sunday,
NASA says.
   During late October and early November, the sun was between
Venus and Earth, forcing a two-week halt to Magellan's $744 million
mission to use radar to map the surface of cloud-shrouded Venus.
   ``This time, Venus itself gets in the way,'' although mapping
can continue, said Steve Wall, Magellan experiment representative
at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.
   Because of the relative positions of Earth and Venus as they
orbit the sun, ``a straight line drawn from the spacecraft to the
Earth goes straight through Venus'' for part of each day during the
42-day period, Wall said Wednesday.
   Magellan has already shown Venus is marked by quake faults,
gargantuan flows of solidified lava and countless volcanoes, some
of which may be erupting now.

<TEXT>
   The Writers Guild of America has
tentatively agreed to a three-year extension of its contract with
movie and TV producers.
   ``I never thought it would happen in my lifetime. It means peace
for five more years,'' George Kirgo, president of the guild's West
Coast branch, said Wednesday.
   The agreement, which must be ratified by the guild's 10,500
members, calls for annual contract adjustment meetings.
   The guild staged a 22-week strike in 1988, virtually halting new
projects until writers accepted a contract that was due to expire
in May 1992.
   With the extension, the contract will run until May 1995.

   Donald G. Whatley arrived in Kuwait on Aug. 1 at 10:30 p.m. He
was at the Iraqi border by around 1 a.m., had a sandwich and was
soon after in bed.
   By 3:45 a.m., ``the sky was saturated with helicopters, missile
fire was showering down over my head.'' He never got a chance to
relieve Charlie Amos, another American oil worker who was to have
headed home Aug. 2.
   ``About 25 soldiers drove up (to the oil rig site) and they had
guns,'' Amos said from his home in Gilmer, Texas. ``It was tense.
We were taken into custody at 5:30 a.m. By 6:30 a.m., we were in
Iraq.''
   Among Saddam Hussein's earliest captives, both men by dawn had
spent the first of many sleepless nights. Four months would pass
before their vigil ended last week with the Iraqi leader's decision
to free his ``foreign guests.''
   It wasn't until Tuesday that Amos and Whatley let down. It
wasn't until they'd finally collapsed into the arms of family,
gathered around the kitchen table or nestled deep into familiar
blankets that they truly knew rest.
   ``I've had four or five hours of sleep now and feel real fine,''
Whatley said from Shreveport, La. ``But the willpower's gone. All
during it, I wouldn't let the Iraqis get into my head and break my
mind. ... Now I'm exhausted.''
   Whatley and Amos spoke in whispers, drained by their long
journeys home from Iraq; numbed by the suddeness of Saddam's
turnaround. All at once the monotony was broken, the fear shaken
out of them like a bad dream.
   ``It's been such a long trip,'' Whatley, 48, said before joining
his wife for breakfast, bacon and eggs like on just about any day.
   Amos said he was perhaps most stunned by an unexpected shock of
sympathy for the guards left behind. After praying day and night
for his freedom, ``It was actually rather emotional saying
goodbye.''
   Amos and Whatley were separated at the Baghdad hotel where they
were taken shortly after the invasion.
   During Amos' stay at a barren site near Syria, Iraqi guards
played pool with their captives and scared up a few old spy novels.
If he wanted a little exercise, Saddam's men went along for the
run.
   ``It was a group activity ... they were actually friendly,''
said Amos, 60, who with Whatley works for Santa Fe Drilling Co.
``They didn't like what they were doing any better than we did.''
   Guards told Amos, who has been drilling oil in the Middle East
for the better part of 20 years, that he was being held at an
abandoned phosphates mine. But, he said haltingly, ``It didn't look
like that.''
   The site, he said, looked more like a military or chemical
installation. ``I tried not to think about it,'' Amos said before
going to sleep for the first time since leaving Baghdad for home
Sunday via Germany.
   Whatley said his Iraqi guards never called him a ``human
shield.'' But he, like Amos, could guess at his part in Saddam's
strategy by looking at the series of power plants and satellite
centers that were his home over the weeks.
   ``We were meant to deter attacks,'' Whatley said.
   It was perhaps that threat of death that bound captor and
captive: ``The installation where we were, we'd have been the first
to die,'' Whatley said.
   While living in the shadow of that knowledge, Whatley had
nothing to go on but the wife and family he holds so close. ``Hope
is what I held on to,'' said the oil worker, who received two
letters from his wife while in captivity.
   Doris Whatley, meanwhile, heard nothing at all. Like relatives
of so many of the 900 U.S.hostages, she spent 4{ months as a human
barometer. Their emotions have risen and receded depending on the
threat of war.
   Sarrah Amos slept on a couch in the living room, bathed in the
television's bluish light and ear cocked to the telephone always
somewhere near at hand.
   ``I know emotionally our families had it worse than we did,''
Amos said. ``We knew where our families were located and their
conditions. They knew nothing.''
   Until Sarrah Amos and Doris Whatley awoke last Thursday to the
news, they'd given up hoping for anytime soon: their husbands were
coming home.
   ``It came as a surprise for us, too,'' said Amos, the father of
three adult children. ``It came as such as glorious surprise.''

<HEAD>Gruesome Child-Abuse Case Brings New Criticism of Florida System</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Also in Wednesday AMs report.

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The case of a badly beaten 3-year-old boy who died
after being dumped near a bayfront home has generated new alarm
about Florida's child-protection system.
   The state passed child-abuse reforms and boosted spending after
last year's widely publicized death of 2-year-old Bradley McGee,
who was under state supervision but was returned home in spite of
reports of abuse. He died from being dunked repeatedly into a
toilet because he had soiled his pants.
   Four state social services workers were charged in that case.
One was convicted of felony child abuse for negligence and placed
on three years' probation.
   The latest case involved a boy who was returned to his mother's
custody after she left him with a sitter for three months.
   Chief Dade Juvenile Judge William Gladstone summoned state
social services officials to a hearing Friday to find out what
happened to the boy, initially known as ``Baby Lollipops.''
   He was told of a lack of training and crushing caseloads - the
boy's caseworker had 50 children, compared with a national standard
of 12 per child-protection caseworker.
   ``This case is my failure, too,'' Gladstone said, his eyes
tearing. ``We all failed. Somehow, this child was killed, and he
was killed by every person in this state.''
   Baby Lollipops was found Nov. 2 beside a wall around a bayfront
Miami Beach home. The extensive injuries and severe neglect,
including a days-old diaper held with packing tape, were
``incomprehensible,'' said police detective Tom Hoolahan.
   Before the boy's identity was determined, officers named the
victim after the lollipops on his T-shirt.
   Dade County's medical examiner, Dr. Joseph Davis, said Monday it
was the worst case of child abuse he has ever seen in 34 years in
the office.
   The boy's mother and her female lover were arrested Dec. 5 on
first-degree murder charges.
   Police said the mother, Ana Marie Cardona, admitted she and
girlfriend Olivia Gonzalez, 24, left the boy in a yard in an
upscale neighborhood, hoping he would be found by a wealthy family.
They fled with two other children to the Orlando area.
   The boy wasn't found for four days.
   It turned out the boy was Lazaro Figueroa, who with his sister
had been placed under state supervision two years earlier. That was
after their mother left them with a baby sitter and didn't return
for three months, authorities said. Lazaro's father was a drug
dealer killed four weeks before his birth.
   The children were returned to Ms. Cardona, now 29, because there
was no evidence of abuse, the state Health and Rehabilitative
Services Department said. However, Ms. Cardona and her three
children - the department wasn't aware of the third - subsequently
moved and the agency lost track.
   The caseworker didn't report Ms. Cardona's disappearance to the
court for four months.
   The caseworker has not been charged.
   Department spokesman Steve Konicki said criticism of the
caseworker was unfair because at the time she was hired the state
had no training for child-protection workers. The worker wasn't
aware at the time the mother moved that she should go to court and
seek a police pick-up order.
   The caseworker tried diligently on her own to locate the family,
Konicki said, but simply hadn't been properly trained. She had been
since, he said.
   ``This is a case that proves why we need what we have now,''
Konicki said.
   There also have been reforms in the department's background
checks, computerization of records, and tightening of standards on
separating children from abusive parents.
   State Rep. Mike Abrams, a legislative leader on children's
issues, said the case could bring more reforms.
   Abrams said caseworkers are still ``underpaid, undertrained,
overwhelmed by their caseload.'' Starting pay for workers is
$16,000 to $20,000 a year, and 42 percent quit in their first year.
   Jack Levine, executive director of the advocacy group Center for
Children and Youth, said the wonder is there aren't more such
tragedies.
   ``The only children's program in Florida without a waiting list
is the morgue,'' Levine said.

   Gov.-elect Pete Wilson is giving no
clues about who he'll pick as his successor in the U.S. Senate. The
possibilities include Sonny Bono, Peter Ueberroth and National
Security Council aide Condoleezza Rice.
   ``We neither confirm nor deny any names. The senator is not
talking about it,'' Wilson spokesman Bill Livingstone said.
   ``There's no set timetable on when he's going to make a
decision,'' Livingstone added. He said Wilson's first priority is
preparing the budget message he will deliver three days after
taking office, and that a Senate successor probably won't be named
for several more weeks.
   Wilson's selection of his successor could be one of his toughest
political decisions. The California Republican Party is sharply
divided between anti-abortion and pro-choice advocates and between
conservatives and moderates on fiscal and environmental issues.
   Wilson, who narrowly won the gubernatorial election last month,
must resign his Senate seat before taking his oath of office Jan.
7.
   Under state law, his appointee will assume Wilson's U.S. Senate
seat without any confirmation until California's next general
election in 1992, when the new senator must stand election for what
then will be the remaining two years on Wilson's term.
   California's senior senator, Democrat Alan Cranston, has
announced he will retire when his term ends in 1992, so both Senate
seats will be on the same ballot. Since the winner of Cranston's
seat gets a full six-year term, it is viewed as the greater prize.
But so far, most potential candidates in both parties are waiting
for Wilson's appointment before committing themselves to either
race.
   Wilson and his staff have refused comment on all speculation
except to confirm when a rumored contender has asked to be
eliminated from consideration. So far, three people have done so,
including U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills.
   Bono, the singer-turned-mayor of Palm Springs, has said
repeatedly that he is interested in running. It is not clear
whether Republican power brokers take him seriously, but he has
wide name recognition and presumably could tap wealthy
entertainment interests for campaign contributions.
   Ueberroth, the former baseball commissioner who made millions in
the travel agency business, has been considered a major contender
for public office since he organized the 1984 Olympics in Los
Angeles and turned the games into a major money-maker.
   He has been linked most commonly to running for the U.S. Senate
and in 1986 and 1988 was seen as a possible candidate by some
Republicans. But he was also talked about as a successor to
retiring Gov. George Deukmejian.
   Other rumored prospects include Rice, a National Security
Council adviser who is the highest ranking black woman in President
Bush's administration; U.S. Reps. Tom Campbell, David Dreier, Jerry
Lewis and Robert Dornan; state Sens. Marian Bergeson and Ken Maddy;
and Orange County Supervisor Gaddi Vazquez, one of California's
highest ranking Hispanic Republicans.
   Wilson has said he is looking for someone who agrees with his
moderate GOP views.
   ``I'll try to find someone who s as nearly like myself as
possible,'' Wilson said. But he hasn't commented on what weight he
would give to which of his political priorities, which include a
pro-choice abortion stand, sympathy with environmental causes and
conservative stands on the death penalty.
   Livingstone says the only people Wilson is confiding in are his
wife, Gayle, and his longtime chief of staff, Bob White. They both
refuse to comment.
   ``There's no structure like you have in a judicial selection,
where you have an advisory group,'' Livingstone said. ``There is no
front-runner that I know of. The (eventual) nominee may not even be
on that list.''

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   L. Jay Oliva, a scholar of Russian history who
lives with his wife in a student dormitory at New York University,
has been named the next president of NYU.
   Oliva, who is chancellor of NYU, was designated by the board of
trustees Tuesday to succeed John Brademas as president of the
nation's largest private university in 1992.
   Brademas announced last summer his plans to step down at age 65.
   Oliva, 57, is the first NYU faculty member selected to lead the
university in its 159-year history. The university has 44,000
students.
   He has been at the university since 1960, starting in the
history department before moving into the administrative ranks as
dean, vice president, provost and chancellor. His books include
``Russia in the Era of Peter the Great,'' published in 1969.
   Oliva still teaches a class in Russian history and said in an
interview that he plans to continue.
   In keeping with an accessible, easygoing style that made him the
odds-on favorite for the presidency, Oliva added that he and his
wife plan to stay in student housing after he takes office.
   Brademas, a former 11-term Indiana congressman, served as NYU
president since 1981.
   He was considered a formidable fund-raiser - more than $800
million in a decade - and helped move NYU's fine arts, accounting
and business schools into the front ranks nationally.
   The school also became one of the nation's most expensive. Fixed
charges this fall came to $21,400.
   ``The momentum NYU has achieved provides us the opoortunity over
the next decade to move to the front ranks of the nation's premier
urban research universities,'' Oliva said.

<HEAD>Darman Draws Heat in Policy Dispute With Administration Colleague</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Budget director Richard G. Darman, whose tax
and budget maneuvering drew criticism from both parties, is again
in the eye of a policy storm as he wages an unusual battle against
a junior colleague.
   As he works on what some associates say may be his final budget,
Darman seems to be losing the contest.
   The inveterate gamesman and prankster, who once donned a gorilla
suit to delight President Bush, is finding little to clown about
these days in his snit with James P. Pinkerton, Bush's deputy
assistant for policy planning.
   Darman's decision to go after a junior aide has baffled other
senior administration officials. And conservatives, many of whom
still blame Darman for Bush's shift on taxes, are using the flap as
ammunition in a new get-Darman effort.
   Will the director of the Office of Management and Budget, now
working on the president's budget for fiscal 1992, survive the
latest onslaught? Many insiders say they expect him to leave soon
after the new budget proposal goes to Congress in early February.
   Furthermore, what prompted Darman's scorn - Pinkerton's proposal
for a range of self-help programs for the poor - seems to be
finding support from Bush, the man who counts. In fact, the
president may incorporate some of them in his State of the Union
address in January.
   It all began last month, when Darman gave a speech attacking the
``empowerment'' agenda that Pinkerton prepared for Bush's
consideration. The package includes programs like tenant ownership
of public housing and tax breaks for businesses that locate in
inner cities.
   Darman mocked the plan as ``too pretentious'' and mere
``sloganeering'' and said it was a throwback to ideas that failed
in the 1960s war on poverty.
   The budget director also took a slap at the phrase Pinkerton
chose to describe the programs, ``new paradigm,'' or new model.
Darman called that ``neo-neo-ism,'' and also ``neo-Newt-ism,'' a
stab at House GOP Whip Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., an outspoken supporter
of the concept.
   Just as Darman touched off Democratic criticism last winter by
comparing the federal budget to a ``cookie monster'' and a ``Pac
Man'' that gobbles up resources, his mocking attack on Pinkerton's
work generated heat among conservatives.
   ``There are a lot of phrases going around like empowerment and
new paradigm ... The fact is they all come down to that fundamental
approach of not having a movement toward an overall centralized
process,'' said White House chief of staff John Sununu.
   Gingrich called for Darman's resignation, accusing him of ``an
assault on members of his own party.''
   Vice President Dan Quayle, Housing Secretary Jack Kemp and
William Bennett, President Bush's choice to be the new Republican
National Committee chairman, also quickly made their support known
for an empowerment agenda.
   Quayle told a gathering of GOP governors: ``There is nothing
wrong with a battle of ideas. But once the president decides, it
will not be Republicans vs. Republicans but Republicans vs.
Democrats.''
   Bush himself championed some of Pinkerton's ``new paradigm''
proposals in a speech last spring.
   And at a Rose Garden ceremony last week, the president praised
the concept anew, calling ``this idea of empowering people, not
bureaucracies'' a cornerstone of his effort ``to reduce the heavy
hand of government.''
   Neither Darman nor anyone at the budget office would comment on
the dispute, despite repeated attempts to elicit his views.
   Pinkerton isn't eager to discuss the disagreement either. But he
said, ``I'm just happy the ideas are getting a thorough
discussion.''
   Pinkerton, 32, who was Bush's chief issues researcher during the
1988 campaign, says he knows some people find ``new paradigm''
something of a mouthful. As the president and other administration
officials put forth their agenda ``they'll use their own
rhetoric,'' he added.
   The 48-year-old Darman, who served in six different agencies
under three Republican presidents before getting one of his own to
head, remains the White House aide conservatives love to hate.
   His work in negotiating the $500 billion, five-year package of
tax increases and spending cuts angered many Republicans who saw it
as a big election-year liability.
   Many members of Congress of both parties accused Darman and
Sununu of being heavy-handed and abrasive in negotiating for the
president.
   Gary Bass, director of OMB Watch, a public policy group of
former budget officials that monitors the agency's performance,
said Darman has justly earned a reputation for ``brilliance in
developing schemes. He's always five steps ahead of everyone
else.''
   ``But he is also arrogant. And I think people on Capitol Hill
resent that,'' Bass added.
   He said ``the real issue'' in the Darman-Pinkerton dust-up has
little to do with Pinkerton, but is a ``battle to see who controls
the administration's agenda'' - whether conservatives like Kemp,
Bennett and Gingrich or more establishment-oriented politicians
like Darman.

<DATELINE>SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   At least two people were killed and 40
injured in a fight between riot police and thousands of squatters
who refused to obey a court order to abandon private land in a Sao
Paulo suburb, authorities say.
   The struggle occurred Tuesday in Diadema, an industrial suburb
of this city of 7 million people, South America's largest.
   Scenes aired by TV Globo, Brazil's largest network, showed
hundreds of helmeted riot troopers, some on horseback, charging
into the squatters.
   The police, using shields and armed with rubber truncheons,
hurled tear gas canisters into a crowd of approximately 3,000
people.
   The squatters fought back with rocks, wooden clubs and Molotov
cocktails.
   A Diadema police officer, who asked that his name not be used,
said by telephone that two squatters were killed during the
violence, which lasted 35 minutes. He said it was still unclear how
they were killed.
   The officer also said 25 officers and policemen were injured,
and that more than 20 people were arrested. The squatters had
refused to heed a court order and abandon the 62 acres of
privately-owned land.
   ``We surrounded the place in the morning and tried to convince
them to leave peacefully. Instead, they hurled rocks and Molotov
cocktails at us. e had no choice. We had to resort to violence,''
the police officer said.
   He said a local municipal councilman defending the squatters had
his right hand blown off by a Molotov cocktail.
   The squatters occupied the land in September but the order to
leave it was only issued on Tuesday.
   TV Globo showed several Molotov cocktails, clubs and hatchets
inside one of the many wooden shacks built by the squatters. It
also showed tractors destroying the shacks.

   At 99, the ``father of public relations''
is still promoting clients - and himself.
   Edward Bernays showed signs of outlasting his listeners Tuesday
as he made a whirlwind tour of the University of Massachusetts.
   ``At 99, I work 12 hours a day just as I did before, and if a
client comes in - we make no bones about it - he pays $1,000 an
hour for advice,'' Bernays said during three hours of gab about his
career promoting such clients as Sigmund Freud, Enrico Caruso,
Vaslav Nijinsky, Calvin Coolidge and other presidents.
   In 1923, Bernays taught the first college course in public
relations at New York University. His 1923 book ``Crystallizing
Public Opinion'' is considered the bible of the business.
   Bernays, who lives in Cambridge, dismissed retirement at age 65
as a ``cockeyed idea.'' He said his theory that work keeps him
young was supported during a doctor's visit at 94, when tests
showed he had the body of a 62-year-old.
   ``He made the 16 tests again when I was 95 and I found I was
61,'' Bernays said.
   Colleagues marvel at his ability to captivate the public and his
mastery of getting clients stories into newsprint and onto
broadcasting airwaves.
   ``He is absolutely indefatigable,'' said Scott M. Cutlip, dean
emeritus at the University of Georgia and co-author of a widely
used public relations text.
   Cutlip credited Bernays with establishing two-way communication
between clients and news media, rather than simply distributing
news releases or waiting for reporters to come to the client.
   Another of his principles involves staging the kind of
demonstrations that have since become the norm worldwide.
   ``Actions speak louder than words,'' Bernays said, giving as an
example his efforts on behalf of the tobacco industry decades ago
to make it acceptable for women to smoke in public.
   He said he helped engineer the change in attitudes with the help
of debutante friends who lit cigarettes as so-called ``torches of
freedom'' during Easter Day parades.
   About 30 years later, when the Surgeon General revealed the
hazards of smoking, Bernays said he campaigned to get tobacco
advertising off the airwaves in atonement.
   His contact with Freud, a maternal uncle, resulted in the
American publication of ``Introductory Lectures in
Psychoanalysis,'' which previously had been published only in
Europe.
   And there were efforts to revamp Coolidge's sourpuss image.
   Trying to erase the image created by the frequent sarcastic
comment that ``Calvin Coolidge was weaned on a pickle,'' Bernays
said he promoted a White House breakfast visit by a group of
actors, who were considered slightly raffish in those days.
Newspapers all over the country carried the story.
   ``I recall The New York Times, they had a story that had about
five subheads ... and the fourth headline in the New York Times
was, `President nearly laughed,''' Bernays said.

<HEAD>A New Mecca For Frustrated Inventors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFFREY ULBRICH</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TORONTO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Haven't you ever wished somebody would invent a
doohickey that fastens on the bathtub and holds your book while you
wash?
   How about a gadget that opens and closes toilet lids, no hands?
   Or a box that creates your own subliminal advertising -
injecting microsecond-long messages into your TV, which could help
you kick a cigarette or other drug habit.
   Well they exist, on display at Toronto's New Product Store - a
home for the mad scientist and crazy inventor.
   The business was founded a year ago by Brian Gray, his brother
Joseph, and Ed Zwolinski.
   ``Brian Gray was a frustrated inventor,'' says Zwolinski, who
manages the place. ``He had a line of hardware products - a radon
gas detector, a disco music light box, custom construction hard
hats - and was frustrated by all the doors closed to him, being
told to buzz off.''
   He says the biggest problem for inventors is skepticism.
   ``It's so hard to get attention. You really have to have a lot
of clout behind you. One person alone doesn't have that.''
   The New Products Store can't offer much in the way of clout. But
it can offer exposure, both in shelf space in the store and via the
publicity it has generated.
   It also offers professional evaluation from its board of
engineers and lawyers, distribution leads, contacts with retailers
and a sympathetic ear.
   The typical inventor usually follows a path like this: He gets
an idea, becomes obsessed with it, creates a product and produces
it. At that point, the honeymoon is over because he then has to
sell it.
   ``That's where we come in,'' says Zwolinski. ``We offer them a
start in the market. There is no way an inventor can know how good
his product is without public exposure.''
   The store is not very large, but it is located in one of
Toronto's most fashionable shopping districts. The store manager
can judge customer response to products, even browser response.
   Robert Dubeck invented the device for reader-bathers, an
obsession that has consumed nine years of his life.
   ``No one thought this was going to go,'' says Dubeck. ``Everyone
wanted me to give up the dream, just keep working. I was put down
by friends and family. They basically said work for a living, don't
come up with a dream to better yourself.''
   The secret is getting the big stores and chains to buy and stock
the item. And, according to Dubeck, buyers in these recessionary
times are not given to speculating on unproven products.
   ``Our main concern is marketing, publicity and distribution,''
says Zwolinski. ``We're publishing a distribution catalog in
December, sending it to 10,000 distributors in Canada and the
United States.
   In it, potential customers will find such items as the Leisure
Reader for the bathtub; a lapel or blouse pin for holding
eyeglasses; the Bathroom Butler that opens and closes toilet lids;
erase protection tabs for computer disks; or the box that creates
those microsecond positive affirmation messages for your TV as a
means of changing behavior.
   Some of the stuff, Zwolinski admits, is novelty, such as the
floating toilet bowl posters, but a lot of it is genuinely
practical.
   About 40 percent of the inventors represented in the store are
American.
   ``It's really good working with Americans because they are more
risk- oriented and more willing to take a chance,'' says Zwolinski.

   Fifty-five pilot whales beached
themselves near the Kennedy family compound Tuesday, and rescuers
managed to get fewer than 10 headed out to sea before deciding to
kill many of he mammals to end their suffering.
   Volunteers struggled throughout the day to save the creatures -
most of them mothers and calves - with little success.
   They splashed the beached whales with water and soothed them
with wet towels. The whales - up to 20 feet long and 3,000 pounds -
were listless, with eyes closed, making squeaking and whistling
sounds and occasionally twitching.
   ``I'm offering a little comfort,'' said one volunteer, Karen
Kelly. ``They respond to your touch and your voice. They are scared
and they don't know what's going on.
   ``Say a prayer,'' she added.
   By midnight, two whales had been moved to an aquarium, eight or
nine had been seen swimming away and the rest were either drowning
as the tide rose or being injected with a lethal chemical. The
volunteers were sent home, and the would-be rescuers expected all
the whales to be dead by morning, either from drowning or the
lethal injections.
   Scientists decided on euthanasia becuase the air-breathing
animals were too weak to swim away on the rising tide and drowned
as they submerged. The whales' suffering was worsened because
without being immersed in cooling water, their body temperatures
rose.
   Experts were unable to explain why the whales beached
themselves.
   About 100 volunteers endured high wind and 35-degree
temperatures in the futile effort to save the whales. They used
stretchers to return nine of the whales to open water, but one was
believed to have beached itself again.
   The whales got stuck in shallow pools at low tide at Squaw
Island, said Ian McMillan, associate director of the Cape Cod
Aquarium.
   On the beach, a few floodlights and car headlights illuminated
the moonless night. Ruben Baker, a volunteer, said the sub-freezing
temperatures didn't spoil his enthusiasm for the task.
   ``You get a really neat feeling from the whales,'' Baker said.
``These whales could pick you up and throw you through the air. But
it feels like they know we're trying to help them.''
   ``They're sort of flopping around,'' said Roger Cadrin, a
lieutenant with the Hyannis Fire Department who helped free a few
of the animals. ``We named ours Betsy, and there was Bob, Scraps, a
few others. When we let them go, they were all pointing in the same
direction. They were all anxious to go. They were happy to get
moving.''
   Two freed whales have radio transmitters attached to their tails
and were followed by marine experts in an inflatable boat. They
also have luminescent tags attached to their fins so they can be
seen at night.
   McMillan said it was unusual for whales to beach on the southern
side of Cape Cod.
   ``Historically it's been on the other side,'' he said. ``There
are certain areas where they seem to strand time and time again.''
   Dave Wiley of the International Wildlife Coalition, which
assisted in the rescue, said the test for the freed whales was
whether they remain at sea or beach themselves again.
   The rescue effort was the first test of a 600-person volunteer
whale rescue program set up by the New England Aquarium two years
ago, McMillan said.
   It was the first mass beaching in the area since 70 pilot
whales, a small type of whale, beached at several spots four years
ago. Three young whales that beached on the Cape three years ago
were rescued and returned to the sea.
   Some scientists speculate that the beachings occur when the pod,
or group, of whales follows a sick leader ashore, or that the
mammals become disoriented by magnetic variations along geological
faults.
   McMillan said aquarium scientists are working on a theory that
high tides can cause beachings. Planetary alignments last week
caused the highest tides in 60 years.
   ``Whales may use current flows to navigate, and they may get
confused by a change in the flow that you only see in very high
tides,'' McMillan said.
   Whales give out heat in only three places - the dorsal fin, the
tail and around the flippers. The system is designed to conserve
body heat in the water, so when they come onto land the whales cook
inside.
   ``Some of their extremities could be freezing because of the
cold weather and at they same time they overheat internally,''
McMillan said. ``When this happens their body chemistry goes beyond
any limits that are considered treatable or recoverable.''

   Reputed mafia boss John Gotti was arrested
Tuesday night, reportedly on an indictment that accuses him of
killing the man he allegedly succeeded as head of the nation's most
powerful crime family.
   Gotti was arrested without incident by FBI agents and city
police at the Ravenite social club in Manhattan's Little Italy
neighborhood, along with two other alleged members of the Gambino
crime family.
   Charges against the men were sealed, said FBI spokesman Joseph
Valiquette.
   The New York Times reported Wednesday that Gotti, 50, is the
subject of a wide-ranging indictment accusing him of running the
Gambino crime family since 1986. The paper, quoting officials it
didn't name, said the indictment is being brought under the federal
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Law, or RICO.
   The indictment accuses Gotti of ordering the killing of the
previous Gambino boss, Paul Castellano, who was gunned down outside
Sparks Steakhouse on East 46th Street in December 1985, officials
told the newspaper. Castellano's death enabled Gotti to take
control of the crime family.
   Gotti was taken into custody without incident along with two
associates, Salvatore ``The Bull'' Gravano and Frank ``Locks''
Locasio, the FBI said. A fourth man, Thomas Gambino, an alleged
boss in the Gambino family, was arrested at an undisclosed location
Tuesday night.
   Gambino is believed by authorities to be the richest of the
reputed Mafia members in New York City.
   The four men were to arraigned Wednesday morning at Brooklyn's
federal court, Valiquette said. They were being held at the
Metropolitan Correctional Center after being fingerprinted and
photographed at FBI offices in Manhattan, Valiquette said.
   A police spokesman, Officer Scott Bloch, said details about the
arrests would be revealed at a news conference likely to be held
Wednesday. No other details were immediately available.
   Gotti's attorney, Bruce Cutler, did not immediately return a
call left on his answering service.
   Gotti has been under investigation in the slaying of Castellano
since the shooting, but never has been charged.
   Evidence against Gotti and his co-defendants came from hidden
eavesdropping devices placed with court authorization at the
Ravenite Club, the Times quoted the officials as saying.
   
   Gotti was found innocent in February of state charges related to
the shooting of a union official. It was the third time that he had
been acquitted in recent years of major state or federal charges.
   Jules Bonalovonta, in charge of the FBI's organized crime office
in New York, recently described Gotti as ``the No. 1 target of law
enforcement'' and added, ``It's just a matter of time. He's going
to go.''
   Three times Gotti has appeared in New York City courts on other
charges, and three times he has walked out a free man, earning the
nickname ``The Teflon Don.''
   The acquittals, combined with his reputation for violence and
fine clothing, have given Gotti national notoriety.
   Gotti's attorney recently noted that his client is often linked
to the Castellano slaying, but asserted Gotti's innocence.
   ``Take this poor Mr. Castellano who was killed,'' Cutler said.
``How many times have the newspapers said my client had something
to do with this? He didn't.''
   Bonavolonta also alleged recently that Gotti has increased the
number of Gambino family members since taking over the crime
family, and most of the new members deal in drugs.
   The Gambinos' other sources of income allegedly are gambling,
extortion, loan-sharking, union control, airport rip-offs and
dominance of the garment district.
   Thomas Gambino, who allegedly runs a multimillion dollar garment
center trucking operation, faces other charges by the Manhattan
district attorney's for allegedly controlling the garment district
through extortion and coercion.

   The Communist Party used to advertise itself as
the ``conscience of the nation.'' By the time Andrei Sakharov died,
that title was more commonly accorded to him.
   Since the physicist and political activist's death a year ago
this Friday, friends and colleagues in the human rights movement
have battled for Sakharov's cause. But they say no one has emerged
to take his place.
   ``The conscience of the nation - that has remained a vacant
position,'' said Sergei Grigoryants, editor of the unofficial
journal Glasnost and one of many former political prisoners who
Sakharov pressured the government to free.
   Since Sakharov died of heart failure at age 68, public esteem
has continued to climb for the man who helped invent the Soviet
hydrogen bomb and later won the Nobel Peace Prize.
   He campaigned tirelessly for justice for Stalin's victims,
nuclear disarmament, freedom of emigration and above all democracy.
   In a poll published last week by the Moscow News, Soviets were
asked ``which of the following names will have great meaning for
the people of the U.S.S.R. in the year 2,000: Jesus Christ, Lenin,
Stalin, Gorbachev and Sakharov.''
   Sakharov finished second to Jesus - but well ahead of Lenin,
Stalin and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Moscow News, a reformist weekly, also published an unusual
confession, admitting that it had ``shortened'' and ``corrected'' -
effectively censored - articles by Sakharov as recently as 1988.
   ``If we had listened to him, our road to the truth would have
been shorter and less tortured. But we shortened and corrected him;
we did not listen or pretended that we did not hear,'' the
newspaper said.
   ``I don't know whether he forgave us, but we cannot forgive
ourselves,'' it said.
   A decade ago, Sakharov was denounced in the official press as an
``utterly ignorant person'' and banished to the industrial city of
Gorky for criticizing the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. He spent
seven years in internal exile before being recalled to Moscow by
Gorbachev in December 1986.
   Soviet troops withdrew from Afghanistan last year; that war now
is viewed by Soviets as a national disaster.
   Sakharov's former apartment in Gorky is being turned into a
museum. His memoirs are being serialized by Znamya, a literary
journal with a circulation of 1 million.
   And both his grave in southwest Moscow and his apartment
building on the city's Ring Road have become unofficial shrines,
decorated daily with flowers by visitors.
   Sakharov's name frequently serves as a rallying cry for
reformers, including Boris Yeltsin, president of the Russian
republic, and Moscow Mayor Gavril Popov, his comrades in the
national legislature.
   But idolatry of Sakharov annoys his widow, Yelena Bonner.
   ``Why are we so inclined to create cults ... out of Sakharov,
out of me?'' the magazine Ogonyok quoted her as saying last month.
   ``I think it is absolutely unbearable when people who are trying
to develop a democratic consciousness so easily create a cult o
new heroes,'' she added.
   Bonner was to commemorate Sakharov's death at a memorial concert
today in Strasbourg, France. She was then to fly to New York, where
the second volume of his memoirs, ``Moscow and Beyond,'' is to be
published in January.
   In Moscow, Sakharov's friends and colleagues said they were
dismayed that some organizations and political movements have taken
his name without embracing his ideals.
   At least one of the groups - the ``Sakharov Union of Democratic
Forces,'' which recently called for a national state of emergency -
is far from his political views, said Larisa Bogoraz, a human
rights campaigner and widow of dissident Anatoly Marchenko.
   Grigoryants, Ms. Bogoraz and others said they believed Sakharov
would be embarrassed and upset at becoming a larger-than-life
character, a symbol freely appropriated by politicians and
movements of varying stripes.
   But they also said he would be pleased by some events of the
past year.
   At the time of his death, Sakharov was pushing for elimination
of Article 6 of the Soviet Constitution, which accorded the
Communist Party a ``leading role'' in society.
   Less than four months later, the party agreed to surrender its
constitutional monopoly on power.
   Sakharov's proposed draft of a new constitution was rejected by
the Communist Party Central Committee little more than a year ago.
Today, his vision of truly sovereign republics joining in a
voluntary union is widely embraced as the only way to hold the
country together.
   ``Only now are people beginning to realize how right he was on
the nationalities question and many other issues,'' Ms. Bogoraz
said.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Hard to be Upbeat About Threats of War and
Recession</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   President Bush may have a hard time saying
anything reassuring about the State of the Union next month. After
all, it's hard to be upbeat about the twin threats of war and
recession.
   Finding applause lines for an audience sure to be anxious and
skeptical is bound to present new challenges to the president's
speech writers, who haven't won many plaudits lately.
   Even so, White House advisers are working on a series of ideas,
new policy initiatives and lofty language for Bush's second formal
address to a joint session of Congress on the nation's well-being.
   In what may be a portent of rocky times ahead, chief of staff
John H. Sununu usurped a traditional prerogative of the House
speaker Tuesday by announcing the date of the spech himself - Jan.
29.
   That's two weeks after the United Nations Security Council's
deadline for Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait or face military action.
   The president has said military action will not necessarily be
launched on Jan. 15 if Saddam Hussein continues to defy the U.N.
resolutions. But by State of the Union time, the whole world should
know which side blinked first.
   Congress, which is usually sluggish when it reconvenes after the
holidays to hear the president's annual address, is sure to be wide
awake and combative this year - particularly if Bush has taken
military action without first getting its consent.
   Beyond the issue of whether the nation will be at war by late
January is the current sharp economic downturn, already pronounced
a recession by many private economists.
   Less than a week after Bush gives his State of the Union
address, he must submit his budget for fiscal 1992.
   The economic downturn will make it even harder to meet new
deficit-reduction targets approved by Congress as part of October's
$500 billion, five-year package of tax increases and spending cuts.
   Furthermore, the Desert Shield military operation threatens to
cost tens of billions of dollars in additional federal spending.
   The breakdown of international trade talks in Geneva this week
over the issue of farm subsidies - which the United States wants to
eliminate but Europe doesn't - could take another big bite out of
federal spending.
   Under a newly enacted trade retaliation provision, the
administration must boost spending on U.S. export subsidies by $1
billion a year if no international agreement is reached to cut such
subsidies.
   That all adds up to a pretty bleak budget outlook.
   White House aides said they haven't started drafting a State of
the Union message, although there are plenty of suggestions on what
it should include.
   But don't look for much soaring language this time. John Kennedy
had his ``New Frontier,'' Lyndon Johnson had his ``Great Society,''
Richard Nixon his ``silent majority,'' and Ronald Reagan talked of
``morning in America.''
   Even Bush promised a ``kinder and gentler nation'' in his
campaign and spoke of the ``winds of change'' in his inaugural
address.
   But so far, about the only new catch-phrase being tossed about
is ``the new paradigm.''
   That term has been trumpeted by Bush's deputy assistant for
policy planning, James P. Pinkerton, who says it means a new model,
or a new way of looking at an old problem.
   It includes a range of self-help programs for the poor,
including tenant ownership of public housing and tax incentives for
businesses that locate in inner cities.
   It has won the backing of many conservatives - if not budget
director Richard Darman, who has ridiculed the phrase as mere
sloganeering and ``neo-neo-ism.''
   What does Darman suggest instead? How about ``new balance,'' he
offered in a recent speech, although he quickly added: ``I should
make clear that there is absolutely no threat of a `new balance'
slogan sweeping the nation.''
   For his part, Pinkerton said he knows that ``new paradigm'' may
seem a bit unwieldy. But he said he likes it anyway. ``I'll
probably stick with it even if nobody else does,'' he said.
   Aides said they expect Bush to propose major changes in bank
regulation and limits on congressional terms in his speech.
   But, with so many uncertainties remaining in the Persian Gulf,
they concede that domestic initiatives could easily be
overshadowed.

   Sen. Alan Cranston's banking aide contends she
was acting on her own when she took steps that helped savings and
loan owner Charles H. Keating Jr. in his disputes with federal
regulators.
   Among the actions for which Carolyn Jordan took responsibility
was placing a statement in the Congressional Record in Cranston's
name that supported Keating's position in a lawsuit challenging
federal regulators.
   But Jordan, testifying before the Senate Ethics Committee on
Tuesday, said repeatedly that she could not recall events or
conversations she had on behalf of Keating's Lincoln Savings and
Loan Association in Irvine, Calif.
   Her assertions drew skeptical comments from some members of the
ethics panel, and her faulty recall prompted demands for clearer
answers.
   ``The witness obviously has very good recollection about some
things and very poor recollection about others,' said Sen. Warren
Rudman of New Hampshire, the ranking Republican on the ethics
panel. ``I think we've got to guard against just getting totally
meaningless answers.''
   Jordan testified in the 16th day of hearings into the so-called
Keating Five case.
   The committee planned to begin closed-door questioning today of
James Grogan, Keating's former lobbyist and top aide, who is being
given immunity from prosecution based on his testimony.
   Chairman Howell Heflin, D-Ala., said the panel would announce
later when it would meet in public again. Committee sources said
Grogan may not appear in public until early January.
   Cranston, D-Calif., is one offfive senators under investigation
by the ethics panel. They face allegations of improperly
intervening with regulators on behalf of Keating, a major financial
contributor who with associates provided $1.3 million for the
campaigns and causes of the five senators.
   The others are Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz.; Dennis DeConcini,
D-Ariz.; John Glenn, D-Ohio; and Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich.
   Jordan denied applying pressure on staff members at the Federal
Home Loan Bank Board in May 1988 to ease a decision tightening
regulatory control on Keating's troubled thrift.
   She said Cranston did not ask her to make the call, although she
described it in a memo to him afterward. She said the impetus came
from Keating's lobbyist, James Grogan, who called her immediately
after the bank board met to complain about its action.
   Federal regulator William K. Black testified last week that the
reversal by the bank board two weeks later delayed the ultimate
seizure and permitted Lincoln to sell more junk bonds, in which
investors lost millions of dollars when the thrift collapsed.
   The government seized Lincoln on April 14, 1989, and the cost to
taxpayers is expected to exceed $2 billion.
   Jordan also asserted she was acting on her own when a prepared
statement in Cranston's name was placed in the Congressional Record
on March 27, 1987.
   Her assertion that Cranston didn't know of the statement in his
own name provoked skeptical comments by Rudman and Sen. Jesse
Helms, R-N.C., another panel member.
   ``Now, what is the story? Did he approve that going in the
Record?'' Helms asked.
   ``No, he did not,'' Jordan replied.
   Helms: ``So just staff members put it in without his
knowledge?''
   Jordan: ``That is correct.''
   The statement in Cranston's name directly contradicted a
statement the day before by William Proxmire, D-Wis., then the
chairman of the Senate Banking Committee.
   Proxmire had agreed to drop proposed amendments from
savings-and-loan legislation specifically giving the bank board
authority to limit direct investments, but had inserted in the
Congressional Record a statement saying it was Congress' intent
that the board already had that power.
   The statement published the next day under Cranston's name said
the board did not have that authority over state-chartered
institutions such as Lincoln. That was in line with the position
Keating was taking in a suit against the bank board.

<HEAD>Wheat Prices Expected to Stay Depressed</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wheat farmers have seen prices drop sharply
from a year or two ago, and a new supply-and-demand report by the
Agriculture Department doesn't find much improvement in sight.
   Overall, 1990-91 global wheat production forecasts increased
from a month ago, with gains in Canada, China and Mexico more than
offsetting reduced prospects in Brazil, the European Community and
South Africa.
   The projected average U.S. market price was reduced 5 cents a
bushel from November to a range of $2.50 to $2.70 for the marketing
year that began on June 1. In the previous two years, the farm
price of wheat was $3.72 per bushel.
   According to the report issued Tuesday, exports are still
expected to be 1.075 billion bushels in 1990-91, down from 1.233
billion last year.
   The U.S. wheat stockpile carried over next June 1 into the new
harvest and marketing year was projected at 937 million bushels,
down slightly from the November outlook but still much larger than
the 536 million bushels carried forward last June 1.
   Looking at corn and other coarse grains, the report showed
global production in 1990-91 and the year-ending stockpile to be up
slightly from last month.
   ``Although prolonged dry conditions have cut corn planting in
South Africa ... gains in the EC, Canada and Turkey are more than
offsetting,'' the report said. ``The smaller crop likely will
eliminate corn exports by South Africa during their 1990-91
marketing year.''
   As with wheat, farmers harvested a bumper corn crop this year.
However, unlike wheat, total corn use is expected to exceed output,
meaning some reduction in the stockpile during the 1990-91
marketing year that began on Sept. 1.
   Consequently, corn prices at the farm are projected to average
$2.20 to $2.50 per bushel this season, compared with $2.36 in
1989-90.
   The corn stockpile next Sept. 1 was projected at 1.236 billion
bushels, down from 1.344 billion estimated this Sept. 1.
   World oilseed production, including U.S. soybeans, also is
forecast at a record level in 1990-91, up 2 percent from last year.
   The U.S. soybean carryover next Sept. 1 was projected at 265
million bushels, up 10 million from the November forecast. The
soybean inventory this Sept. 1 was 239 million bushels.
   Farm prices of soybeans were projected to average $5.25 to $6.25
per bushel in 1990-91, down 10 cents on both ends of the range from
November. Last season soybeans averaged $5.70 per bushel nationally
at the farm.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - The Agriculture Department has pushed up its
estimate of 1990 cotton production to almost 15.4 million bales, up
3 percent from prospects a month ago.
   ``Harvest proceeded with little interruption during November,''
the department's Agricultural Statistics Board reported Tuesday.
``Yields and grades in the High Plains were good to excellent, and
Louisiana's production is a record high level.''
   The latest forecast, based on Dec. 1 indications, is up 26
percent from last year's cotton output of less than 12.2 million
bales.
   Upland cotton accounted for 15.01 million bales of the Dec. 1
estimate, and American-Pima, or extra-long staple, 395,900 bales,
the report said.
   The indicted 1990 production of upland cotton as of Dec. 1,
included:
   Alabama, 400,000 bales this year and 383,000 last year.
   Arizona, 800,000 and 649,000.
   Arkansas, 1,100,000 and 851,000.
   California, 2,800,000 and 2,661,000.
   Florida, 46,100 and 29,000 (carried over from previous
forecast.)
   Georgia, 380,000 and 342,000.
   Louisiana, 1,200,000 and 868,000.
   Mississippi, 1,850,000 and 1,555,000.
   Missouri, 305,000 and 269,000.
   New Mexico, 80,000 and 80,000.
   North Carolina, 260,000 and 141,000.
   Oklahoma, 350,000 and 173,000.
   South Carolina, 145,000 and 154,000.
   Tennessee, 490,000 and 476,000.
   Texas, 4,800,000 and 2,870,000.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Germany and Japan are potentially lucrative
markets for American popcorn farmers, the Agriculture Department
says.
   In Germany, popcorn has become ``one of the most recognized U.S.
food products,'' the department's Foreign Agricultural Service said
Tuesday. And In Japan, it's rapidly overtaking sun-dried squid as
the snack of choice.
   But home-popping is limited in both Germany and Japan, the
report said. That may change, however, as microwave ovens become
more popular.
   Per capita popcorn consumption is still relatively low. In
Germany, for example, consumption averages about two quarts of
popped corn, compared with 56 quarts consumed in the United States,
on a per capita basis.

<HEAD>Influx Of Soviet Jews Disrupts Israeli Life</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The influx of Soviet Jewish immigrants is
beginning to hit Israelis in their paychecks and is showing signs
of straining Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's fragile coalition
government.
   While public support remains generally high, the sheer magnitude
of the task ahead - housing, employing and educating 1,000
newcomers a day - is becoming increasingly daunting.
   The impact of the immigration flood - 150,000 so far this year;
an estimated 1 million by the end of 1992 - is now felt throughout
this country of about 4.4 million people.
   Some people are voicing doubts about whether Israel can take the
strain.
   ``There is an atmosphere of panic among the politicians.
Absorbing an immigration wave of the scope we are now facing ... is
a mission beyond Israel's capability,'' warned the respected
Haaretz newspaper.
   But to do anything to stem the flow would negate Israel's very
reason for existing. As Haaretz pointed out, ``this is a Zionist
state. Taking in Jews is its aim and essence, so nobody dares to
say it out loud.''
   The 1991 state budget for the first time allocates more to
immigrant absorption than to defense. The military lost its fight
for a budget increase and had to cancel an order for two
German-built submarines.
   The budget is also stretching Israelis' ability to pay.
   Last month, the Cabinet approved a hike in the value-added tax,
a rough equivalent of a sales tax, from 16 percent to 18 percent.
It also endorsed an ``immigration tax,'' a 5 percent income tax
levy for the next three years.
   An attempt to lower the minimum wage and tax pensions was
thwarted by the Histadrut, the trade union federation, which held a
two-day general strike last month.
   On Tuesday, two government ministers traded accusations on
television over immigration.
   Absorption Minister Yitzhak Peretz, whose ministry sees to the
needs of immigrants, claimed that at a meeting Sunday of the
Cabinet immigration committee, chairman Ariel Sharon behaved ``like
a dictator.''
   ``He roughly attacked the director general of my ministry. He
was banging his fist with full force on the table and shouting,''
Peretz complained.
   Sharon, the tough-talking former general who heads the Housing
Ministry, retorted angrily in a separate interview.
   Peretz, a rabbi supported by the Orthodox Shas faction in the
coalition, tacitly threatened to bring down the government over
Sharon's behavior.
   Interviewed separately, Sharon implied that Peretz's ministry
wasn't pulling its weight.
   ``The Housing Ministry works 18 hours a day and the Absorption
Ministry has to work too,'' he said. ``When I hold meetings ... at
midnight, is that dictatorship? When I, in my capacity as the head
of the coordinating committee, demand that a ministry submit a
certain plan, is that dictatorship?''
   Sharon also alluded to another issue that is bedeviling the
immigration flow: Peretz's controversial claim that up to 30
percent of the immigrants are not Jewish and therefore not entitled
to automatic entry into Israel.
   Sharon was also reported to have chewed out the army for
demanding payment for putting up immigrants at its bases, saying it
was their job to follow orders, not first ask for payment.
   Nevertheless, the Israeli public remains broadly upbeat. Schools
proudly display what they are doing for the immigrants. Radio
stations run programs designed to bring newcomers and old-timers
together. It is a social must for well-established families to
``adopt'' an immigrant family.
   The immigration wave is also a morale boost at a time when the
Persian Gulf crisis has forced the distribution of gas masks and
the Palestinian uprising in the occupied territories enters its
fourth year looking more violent than ever.
   Absorption Ministry officials recently returned to work after a
two-week strike over pay and hours and found long lines of
immigrants outside their offices. Many immigrants had arrived
before dawn and scuffles broke out.
   The strike had deprived many of their only income - the
government stipend of $9,000 a year for a family of three.

   Meals are being shipped by the millions, but
rivets are scarce. New uniforms and desert boots are in production
- and in demand.
   Four months after President Bush ordered U.S. troops to the
Persian Gulf, sustaining the still-growing deployment is proving to
be an extremely complex, and costly, endeavor.
   More than $1.2 billion has been spent on food, clothing and
medical supplies alone, never mind the millions more on weapons,
parts and other materiel needed for the desert deployment.
   The operation is providing at least a temporary boom to many
suppliers who were expecting less military business this year.
Instead of closing plants or cutting shifts, several food and
clothing suppliers are adding workers or offering overtime to meet
Pentagon pleas for quick delivery.
   A sampling of the orders:
   -113 million meals, including 74.4 million Meals Ready-to-Eat,
the basic field ration, 10.8 new entrees, including pot roast and
beef sukiyaki, and 14 million new ``lunch bucket'' entrees to add
chili and macaroni and cheese to the menu.
   -4.8 million pounds of sugar, 3.2 million pounds of flour and
1.4 million pounds of coffee, contracts worth a combined $5.6
million.
   -547,000 sundry packs, at a cost of $194 million, to supply the
troops with razors, shaving cream, toothpaste and the like.
   -1.5 million tubes of lip balm, costing $278,000.
   -796,008 pairs of desert and hot weather boots, a $31.6 million
deal.
   -379,375 cans of foot powder; 165,000 pairs of sunglasses;
371,000 wool sweaters; and 3.3 million desert camouflage uniforms,
just one of several big-ticket clothing buys.
   -More than 600,000 armor-piercing rounds for the Army's Bradley
Fighting Vehicles, a contract worth $14.3 million to GenCorp's
Aerojet Ordnance Division.
   And buying is just half the task - the Pentagon has to get the
goods 7,000 miles to Saudi Arabia and other Mideast points as it
masses a 60-day or better supply cushion.
   The scope of the supply effort is giving pause to some military
planners, who worry the inevitability of sustainment problems will
be used to advance arguments for early use of force if Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein ignores a Jan. 15 deadline to end his
occupation of Kuwait.
   The operation is also expensive, and getting more costly by the
week as stocks now filling Desert Shield requisitions run low,
forcing the Pentagon to issue new contracts.
   So far, there have been only isolated shortages, officials say.
   Roughly 90 percent of parts orders are being filled from
existing stocks, according to Defense Department figures. Scarce
items rush-ordered from suppliers include rivets, electrical cable
and strapping used to hold down pallets on military transport
planes.
   Most orders are shipped by sea, but if a unit in the Mideast
needs something in a hurry, it can turn to ``Desert Express'' - an
emergency next-day delivery service the Air Force is running to
Saudi Arabia from two U.S. bases.
   To date, ``Desert Express'' cargo has mostly been parts in short
supply for tanks and planes, particularly Vietnam-era F4-G ``Wild
Weasel'' anti-radar jets.
   The overall air leg of the supply line, operated by the Military
Airlift Command, has made nearly 7,000 missions to the Mideast
since August, carrying more than 200,000 passengers and 480 million
pounds of cargo. The Navy's Sealift Command has delivered 28
billion pounds of dry cargo and nearly 6 billion pounds of fuel.
   As it orders more food, the Pentagon is trying to spice up the
menu as a morale booster.
   That initiative meant a $44.6 million contract to George A.
Hormel and Co. for sukiyaki, pot roast, spaghetti, lasagna and
other dinners, and a $20.8 million deal for Dial Corp. for beef
stew, chili, macaroni and cheese and other lunches.
   Other big beneficiaries are the Pentagon's clothing suppliers,
who are rushing production of uniforms, the new line of desert
boots and chemical protective clothing. Overall, more than 83,000
requisitions for $411 million in clothing have been processed for
Operation Desert Shield.

<HEAD>Monetary Fund Cuts Interest Rate</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The International Monetary Fund is cutting its
loan interest rate in a move that could save debtor countries about
$100 million a year, sources say.
   At the end of October the fund had about $30 billion worth of
loans outstanding. Mexico, Argentina, Brazil and Venezuela are the
biggest debtors among 78 borrowing countries.
   The fund, with headquarters in Washington, is owned by 154
countries, with the United States the largest contributor.
   The interest that the fund charges is based on rates that five
major governments - the United States, Japan, Germany, Britain and
France - pay on the short-term bonds they sell to the public. The
fund has been charging 91.3 percent of this rate, which it
calculates every week.
   One source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the fund's
Board of Executive Directors decided Monday to cut the proportion
to 87.8 percent, retroactive to Nov. 1. The directors met behind
closed doors and did not announce the change. They review the
formula every three months.
   For the week of Dec. 3, the interest the fund charges to debtors
had worked out to an annual 8.27 percent. The decision to change
the formula reduces that by 32 basis points, or 32-100ths of one
percent, to 7.95 percent.
   On loans of $30 billion, such a cut would amount to $100 million
in savings to debtors if the reduction is maintained for a year.
   In recent years, the IMF has lent largely to Third World
countries in financial trouble. To get a loan, a government
promises to change its policies and put itself in better condition
to repay. This involves devaluings its currency, reducing subsidies
on basic goods and cutting spending, in many cases.
   Critics say the price of the promises can be too high: greatly
increased prices and many lost jobs in the borrowing country. Such
effects have repeatedly led to bloody riots, including in the
Dominican Republic last month.
   The IMF maintains that the pain will be worse if changes are
delayed.
   An arrangement with the fund has often been the ``seal of
approval'' that private banks want to see before making much bigger
loans of their own.

   Major discrepancies in the count of Soviet
weapons will delay Senate approval of a new treaty slashing
non-nuclear armaments in Europe by at least two months,
congressional sources say.
   The Kremlin figures understate the total numbers of tanks,
artillery and other conventional weapons the Soviets would have to
destroy under the agreement by tens of thousands, the sources,
speaking on condition of anonymity, said Tuesday.
   Although the differences involve several weapons, the largest
problem involves tanks. The Kremlin has been gradually moving tanks
out of Central Europe, the area controlled by the treaty, and
basing them east of the Ural Mountains in the Soviet Union.
   Some in Congress fear that instead of dismantling 10,000 to
20,000 tanks, as the pact requires, the Soviets would have to
destroy few or none.
   In a letter to President Bush, Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., the
senior GOP member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,
complained about the wholesale differences in the Soviet figures.
   The Soviets ``may, in fact, be defeating the object and purpose
(of the treaty) from the outset,'' Helms wrote.
   The precise numbers of weapons in eac category held by each
side, although they are part of the treaty, remain secret.
   Leaders of the 16-member North Atlantic Treaty Organization and
the six-nation Warsaw Pact signed the Conventional Forces in Europe
treaty in Paris on Nov. 19. Bush praised the pact then for reducing
``to practically nil the tensions that have existed.''
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said, ``Instead of
military force, our world order will be based on equitable
dialogue.''
   At the same time, the U.S. envoy to the negotiations hinted of
problems underlying the treaty, but congressional officials said
they were not expected to be this large.
   ``We expect and have expected all along, with an unprecedented
data exchange of this sort for there to be mistakes, inaccuracies,
incomplete pieces of information,'' said Ambassador James Woolsey.
   The problems were spelled out on Monday in a briefing for
congressional aides by the State and Defense departments, the CIA
and the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency.
   They also were the subject of discussions between Secretary of
State James A. Baker III and Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze in Houston, a White House source said.
   Several Democratic staff sources said the problems are
correctable and should not derail eventual Senate approval of the
treaty, which had been planned to be one of the first items of
business when the new Congress convenes in January.
   The discrepancies occur at a time when the United States and the
Soviet Union are enjoying their warmest relations in four decades.
   Under the treaty's terms, each side has 90 days - until Feb. 19
- to correct inaccurate data.
   Now, a Republican source said, the administration will not
submit the treaty for ratification until March because of the
accounting problems.
   In addition to the undercounting of tanks, the Soviet data
understate numbers of armored personnel carriers by 12,000,
artillery pieces by 10,000 and combat aircraft by about 3,000,
according to administration calculations.
   One Democratic source said the problem arose in part because
U.S. negotiators had been working from 1989 weapons lists provided
by the Soviets. Between the time the lists were provided and the
treaty was put in final form, the Soviets already had withdrawn as
many as 20,000 tanks from the area governed by the treaty to east
of the Ural Mountains.
   The senior Democratic aide said the situation was viewed as ``an
accounting problem'' and that such numbers discrepancies are not
unusual in the field of arms control.
   Last year as U.S. negotiators prepared their own numbers, they
discovered 900 tanks they didn't know the United States had in
Europe, the source said. Some 750 of those excess tanks have since
been transferred to Egypt in a move not unlike what the Soviets
apparently have done, he said.
   The 160-page treaty limits each side to 20,000 main battle
tanks, 30,000 armored combat vehicles, 20,000 artillery pieces,
6,800 fighter planes and 2,000 combat helicopters.
   Each side has 40 months to reduce its armaments to the ceilings
spelled out in the treaty, which covers a 2.5 million square mile
area stretching from the Atlantic Ocean to the Ural Mountains.

   Pilobolus Dance Theater, formed in 1970 for
communal choreography, opened a month-long 20th anniversary season
at the Joyce Theater with the most interesting dance being the
newest one.
   ``The Particle Zoo,'' danced at Tuesday's opening night, had its
premiere in January in Pittsburgh. It was commissioned by the
Pittsburgh Dance Council.
   It was danced by four men and choreographed by seven people -
three of the company's five artistic directors and four dancers.
Recorded music by 10 composers is used.
   One of the four performers is an outsider. Two face each other
and clasp hands, supporting a third. When the third leaves and the
outsider jumps onto their hands, they let go and he falls.
Sometimes they catch him then drop him.
   They leapfrog, two jumping over each other from side to side,
while one rolls along the floor. The outsider gets into the game in
the ``wrong'' rhythm making the dance fast, hilarious and dangerous
looking.
   It's a fairly long dance with many parts - whirling each other,
diving onto the floor, etc. It's interesting right up to its trick
ending.
   Carol Parker performed the solo ``Moonblind'' from 1978, to
spacey music by Jane Ira Bloom. Once, sitting on the floor, she
extended one leg and turned her foot out at an extreme angle. It
looked impossible. The audience laughed and, when the dancer stared
in disbelief, laughed more.
   Once she spun like a comedian pretending to be a mad top. It had
all begun with her looking like a distraught housewife.
   ``Televisitation'' from 1985 had Kent Lindemer being visited by
Jude Woodcock, who came out of his TV set which he slept and stood
on his chest. She stands on him through much of the dance, on his
legs when he turns over, on his shoulders when he's sitting.
Standing, he lifts her gracefully and twirls her around. She
responds by getting his neck in a hammerlock.
   He also lifts her with a hand on the back of her head and a hand
on her face. And he swings her so her feet are higher than their
heads. She takes bows like a mechanical doll then throws him over
her shoulder.
   After those three amusing pieces, the final dance, ``Debut C''
from 1988 to Debussy music, took itself very seriously. Six lightly
clad dancers were aiming for sensuousness and it struck this viewer
as mostly pretentious and silly. It is very difficult to loll
around to Debussy music and make the motions look like that
translucent music sounds.
   We can remember when Pilobolus dances had dancers come out
melded together like spoons in a drawer then tumble in ways that
pretty much kept their bodies together. The company has gone in new
directions. But Pilobolus still doesn't look like any other dance
company around.

<HEAD>Unapologetic Bush Aide Says He's a `Political Counterpuncher'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   John Sununu says he has no apologies to make
for his pugnacious performance as White House chief of staff, and
furthermore wants it known that he never lands the first blow.
   ``I merely put myself down as a political counterpuncher,''
Sununu said in a vintage performance for an overflow audience at a
National Press Club luncheon Tuesday.
   He lambasted the Democrats, accusing them of forcing President
Bush to raise taxes by holding the economy ``hostage'' and
forecasting more party strife in the next two years.
   He also suggested the Democrats were looking at the Persian Gulf
crisis as an excuse to raise taxes.
   He defended the much maligned budget deal and his own
contentious role in shaping it, which drew brickbats from Democrats
and Republicans alike.
   Sununu, who called a GOP senator, Trent Lott of Mississippi,
``insignificant'' at one stage of the negotiations, said: ``When
push comes to shove, Republicans will work with Republicans to make
sure this country continues to grow and thrive.''
   It has been a rocky past few months for the abrasive former
governor of New Hampshire with a storied temper and capacity for
political invective.
   Sununu denied that he has damaged White House relations with
Congress or that he was becoming, as one questioner put it, ``the
Don Rickles of Washington politics.''
   ``When someone takes a shot at the president of the United
States in a gratuitous manner, I will respond,'' Sununu said in
defense of his truculent style. ``I believe it is part of my job.
   ``I guarantee you that, contrary to the legend, any strong
statements on my part are both controlled, deliberate and designed
to achieve an effect,'' Sununu said. ``There is no random outburst.
   ``I merely put myself down as a political counterpuncher. You've
never seen me initiate an attack,'' he said.
   Sununu blamed the Democrats for a six-month delay in getting the
$500 billion deficit-reduction deal passed, and said that delay
will make it tougher ``to keep this country moving rather than
floundering.''
   Sununu said Bush will not bend again on taxes.
   The president ``was forced to pay the tax ransom once in order
to save the economy. He will not be forced to pay that tax ransom
again,'' the chief of staff declared.
   Bush only gave in on raising taxes this year ``because our
nation's economy was held political hostage by those that control
Congress,'' he said.
   He signaled that Bush will try again in the new year for a cut
in the capital gains tax.
   Sununu said the Democrats ``are already looking for a reason to
raise taxes.''
   ``They're looking for a bumper sticker that justifies it,
whether it's a bumper sticker called `Tax the rich,' or they're
looking for a cause to justify it, whether it is a surtax on the
war,'' said Sununu.
   The Democratic chairmen of the Senate and House Budget
committees, Sen. James Sasser of Tennessee and Rep. Leon Panetta of
California, have raised the possibility of a surtax on income if
America goes to war against Iraq. Sasser has suggested it might be
necessary to raise income taxes by 5-to-10 percent.

   FAT doesn't mean fat in the Washington
state capital. And SNOW is no word for flaky rain.
   Here, in a place that could be nicknamed Acronym City, the
government has created thousands of acronyms - 3,187 by one
legislator's count - for various agencies, situations, conditions
and crimes. With many of the acronyms spelling out words of their
own, the speech spoken around the statehouse can often be
confusing.
   SURF and WAVE, for example, don't mean fun at the beach, and
SMART isn't the opposite of dumb.
   We're talking FAT as in Fish Agencies and Tribes, SNOW as in
School Nurses of Washington, SURF as in Simple Update Reference
File, WAVE as in Washington Award for Vocational Excellence and
SMART as in Summer Motivation and Academic Residential Training.
   All of these can be found in the second edition of the
Dictionary of State Government Acronyms, a fat - er make that thick
- list that has grown from 1,972 acronyms in 1985 to 3,187 in 1990.
   The book, like its predecessor, is the work of Rep. Steve Van
Luven and helpers Monica Tracey and Barry Weiss. The Republican
legislator from Bellevue said the team of acronym-busters labored
long and hard to compile the list. His BF, or ``biggest fear,'' he
said, was E&amp;0. That's ``errors and omissions.''
   The legislator said he paid for much of the work from his own
pocket after the House clerk refused to handle the cost. He is
giving the book away to other legislators and interested
constituents.
   For the future, he suggests that an ``ADA (Acronym Designation
Agency)'' to professionalize the endeavor may be in order.
   While we're waiting for that to happen, how about a pop quiz of
randomly selected acronyms?
   TARMVWOP, ARMS, CARS, HERO, FONSI, POSSLQ, TOE and SOP.
   Answers, respectively: Taking a Ride in a Motor Vehicle Without
Owner's Permission; Automated Register Maintenance System;
Computerized Activity Reporting System; Home-Economic Related
Occupations; Finding of No Significant Impact; Persons of Opposite
Sex Sharing Living Quarters; Try-Out Employment, and Sex Offender
Program.
   Ready for more? How about STORM, PAW, SP, WOP, AP, WARF and CAB.
   Answers: State Office of Risk Management; Planning Association
of Washington; Sexual Predator; Work Orientation Program; Attending
Physician; Washington Association of Rehabilitation Facilities, and
Taxi-Cab (honest!).
   Before you smug few who scored well go forth to master all 3,187
acronyms, remember this: Some with the same spellings or sounds
have more than one meaning.
   MI refers not only to Mentally Ill but also to Manifest
Injustice. LOS stands for Length of Stay, but LOSS means Large
On-Site Sewage System.
   Aw, HEC (Higher Education Coordinating Board). Maybe it's time
to STOP (Social Treatment Opportunity Program).

   CORAOPOLIS, Pa. (AP) - Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright Jason
Miller was fined $700 for being drunk and disorderly aboard a plane
in October.
   Miller was fined Tuesday after pleading guilty. In exchange,
charges of marijuana possession and making terroristic threats were
dropped.
   Miller, 51, won the Pulitzer in 1973 for ``That Championship
Season.'' He also was nominated for an Academy Award that year for
his portrayal of Father Karras in the film ``The Exorcist.''
   Police said Miller was returning home to Scranton from a Notre
Dame football game in South Bend, Ind., on Oct. 20 when he began
causing trouble.
   He was arrested during a stopover in Pittsburgh.

   LONDON (AP) - Lynn and Vanessa Redgrave are carrying on a family
tradition on the British stage as stars of Chekhov's ``Three
Sisters.''
   The Redgrave sisters and their niece, Jemma Redgrave, star in
the play about siblings who long to return from a remote Russian
village to Moscow.
   Sir Michael Redgrave, father of Lynn, Vanessa and their brother
Corin, Jemma's father, appeared in the play at the Queen's Theater
in 1936.
   The current version, which opened at the same theater Tuesday,
marks Lynn Redgrave's first appearance on the British stage since
1973.

   NEW YORK (AP) - Former gymnastics star Cathy Rigby says making
her Broadway debut in ``Peter Pan'' is like old times.
   ``This is like the Olympics of theater,'' Rigby said in an
interview Tuesday. ``You have all those same feelings of

   Rigby, who won a silver medal at the World Gymnastics
Championships in 1970, took up acting and singing after retiring
from competition.
   The 36-year-old mother of four has been on the road for a year
in the revival of the musical about the boy who refuses to grow up.
The show opens on Broadway on Thursday.
   ``This is not just children's theater,'' she said. ``It's lasted
all these years because it has great depth, it's a wonderful story
and it touches children of all ages.''

   HIALEAH, Fla. (AP) - City officials are trying to close a
nightclub owned by rapper Luther Campbell of 2 Live Crew after a
man was killed and another wounded there in a weekend gunfight.
   City Attorney Alex Vilarello filed court papers Tuesday seeking
an injunction closing the Strawberry Too club. A hearing wasn't
expected before Friday.
   Campbell, who has owned the club for two years, was acquitted of
obscenity in October along with other members of the group. They
were arrested for a concert featuring songs from his group's album
``As Nasty As They Wanna Be.''
   Campbell said police were to blame for violence at the club
because they failed to control crowds outside.
   ``I think the city of Hialeah is full of it, personally, because
every club in the city of Miami, Miami Beach, all over the county,
has police outside of the club,'' Campbell said.

<TEXT>
   President Bush is renominating a banking
regulator who has been criticized for creating a credit shortage by
cracking down too hard on institutions with sour real estate loans.
   The White House said Tuesday that Bush planned to appoint Robert
L. Clarke to a second five-year term as comptroller of the
currency, the regulator of nationally chartered banks. He must be
confirmed by the Senate.
   According to government and industry sources who spoke
anonymously last week, White House Chief of Staff John Sununu had
sought to block the nomination.
   Sununu's home state of New Hampshire, where he served as
governor, has been particularly hard hit by the so-called credit
crunch.
   According to a government source, White House aides last week
began soliciting criticism of Clarke from bank and business
executives after receiving a letter of complaint from major
Republican contributors.
   Bankers and borrowers in the Northeast have been saying for a
year that Clarke's examiners have overreacted to the savings and
loan crisis, discouraging bankers from making even sound loans.
   However, Clarke and other regulators maintained that they have
not tightened standards inappropriately. They blame banks'
reluctance to lend on deteriorating real estate markets and on a
lack of loan demand resulting from the sluggish economy.
   Clarke had the backing of Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady,
a longtime friend of the president. The secretary is the
comptroller's boss, but in practice the comptroller has
considerable independence.
   After reports of Sununu's opposition were published, Democratic
and Republican members of the House Banking Committee rushed to
Clarke's defense. They warned that the White House would be sending
the wrong signal to regulators if they failed to reappoint a
regulator for being too tough.
   Although Clarke jokingly embraced the nickname ``regulator from
hell,'' he has since moderated his public remarks.
   In a statement thanking Bush for the reappointment, he said,
``We can work through the current problems if lenders assume their
responsibility to make loans and take reasonable risks, and if
regulators follow a responsive, balanced approach that takes into
account ... the very significant national interest in not
unnecessarily depressing credit availability.''
   ``I believe that now is a time for the application of common
sense, a time when neither lenders nor regulators should overreact
or be unresponsive,'' he said.
   National banks, which are chartered by the federal government,
are about a third of the nation's commercial banks. The rest are
chartered by the states. National banks tend to be larger, and
together account for more than half of commercial bank assets.

<HEAD>Administration Doesn't `Have All the Wisdom' on Gulf Policy,
Lawmakers Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Though the Bush administration is pressing
congressional Democrats to stop sniping at White House policy in
the Persian Gulf, leaders on Capitol Hill say it's their duty to
raise questions.
   ``I don't accept the premise that they have all the wisdom,''
said Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., chairman of the House Foreign
Affairs Middle East subcommittee.
   ``Their job is to present their policy, and ours is to test it,
probe it, understand it, criticize it, and out of that process a
better policy emerges,'' said Hamilton, who has largely supported
President Bush's actions in the gulf so far.
   Since Bush announced Nov. 8 that he was nearly doubling the U.S.
force in the gulf to provide an offensive threat against Iraq,
support for his policies has weakened at home. In seeking to scare
Saddam Hussein, the president also has scared Americans.
   A key indication of that has come in Congress, which has been
holding hearings for more than two weeks hammering away at what
many lawmakers and their witnesses believe is the administration's
overeagerness for a military solution.
   Administration officials say they're worried the criticism will
weaken the U.S. position when Secretary of State James A. Baker III
meets with Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein. Saddam, Baker said at a
hearing last week, ``simply cannot receive discordant, or confused
or mixed messages.''
   So Baker, Bush, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and National
Security Adviser Brent Scowcroft will be meeting privately with
senior members of Congress in an effort to build a united front,
one senior official said Tuesday.
   ``It would be nice if we could figure out a way for at least the
leadership to convey a unified message,'' said the official, who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
   Hamilton called Baker's call for congressional restraint ``the
classic argument of the authoritarian: `Trust me, fellows. Don't
bother me. I can handle it.' That's about as strong an
anti-democratic argument as you can make. You can't turn off
democracy because it's inconvenient.''
   But when the issue involves American lives, is there a time to
put aside legitimate disagreements in favor of presenting a united
front?
   To Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., that's part of the tough job of
being a lawmaker.
   ``We've just got to cut this out,'' said Lugar. ``It suggests to
Saddam Hussein that Americans have at least two alternative
policies, maybe more, none of which has congressional
authorization. That makes the situation confusing for friend and
foe alike.''
   Lugar wants the Democrats who control Congress to call a special
session and force members to take sides in a formal vote.
   Lugar said there are political considerations as well, while few
want to talk about it. Democrats seem to be hedging their political
bets by not taking a formal position, he said.
   Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y., cautioned colleagues in a
closed-door session of conservative Democrats last week that the
party might never regain the White House if the public perceives
that Bush's gulf policies succeeded without help from the
Democratic Congress.
   ``There's no question there will be winners and losers from this
politically,'' said Rep. Vic Fazio, D-Calif., but he added that no
one should act based on those considerations. He conceded that if
Democrats appear too shy of military action it could revive the
``weakness'' charge effectively used against the party by former
President Reagan.

<DATELINE>URBANA, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   So what if the mares don't care? Robins
Parteebuilt is a stud, and his owners care. They want the stallion
to look his best.
   So a plastic surgeon who normally works on patients of the
two-legged variety was summoned to repair the dent in 11-year-old
Robins Parteebuilt's forehead.
   The stallion, nicknamed Partee, got the dent in 1989 when he
galloped head-first into a fence post. This week, a team at the
University of Illinois veterinary school filled in the mark with a
sort of body putty.
   ``This is one of the top 10 sires of halter horses in the nation
- a precious animal,'' said owner Roger DeWitt of Gillespie.
   University veterinarians had patched Partee's face as best they
could in 1989, using wires to hold together broken bones.
   But when it came to a face as pretty as Partee's - the subject
of oohs and aahs at the university clinic - the veterinarians
decided a plastic surgeon was needed.
   They called in Dr. Jim Sheridan from Carle Clinic in Urbana. One
of his specialties is repairing faces.
   It took 19 people using a hoist to get the anesthetized,
1,350-pound stallion onto the operating table.
   ``Boy, he's a handsome dog,'' veterinary surgeon Gordon Baker
said after the dent was filled in. And everyone in the operating
room agreed.

   Most state insurance departments are spending
more money to investigate consumer complaints, but some can't keep
pace because of budget problems, says a new report.
   Spending on consumer services rose an average of 12 percent from
1989 to 1990, says the report prepared by a consumer organization
and several insurance industry groups and released Tuesday. But the
study found wide variations in spending levels.
   State insurance budgets for consumer services ranged from $38 in
Michigan for every 1,000 people, to a high of $712 in Delaware.
Massachusetts spends about $60 per 1,000 people on consumer
services, while Washington state spends $444.
   The average is $230 per 1,000 people in the 36 states that
provided the information, the study found.
   ``The good news is that most departments offer many services to
consumers,'' said Stephen Brobeck, executive director of the
Consumer Federation of America.
   But states such as Michigan and Massachusetts have undergone
statewide budget cuts that have hurt consumer services, the report
said. Michigan's toll-free phone for insurance complaints was
discontinued a number of years ago. Staff size has been cut in
half.
   There is a ``large-scale demand for our services which we are
not encouraging or tapping,'' acknowledged Howard Spence,
Michigan's deputy insurance commissioner.
   Despite the cuts, Michigan recovers more than $2 million a year
for consumers through the complaint process, Spence said.
   Despite the budget cuts in Massachusetts, the state managed to
recover $600,000 last year for consumers.
   The best-run consumer services programs, according to the
report:
   -Florida, with a substantial population of elderly residents,
spends $567 for each 1,000 people.
   -New York, with a $5.5 million budget for consumer services in
1990, the largest of any state. That comes out to $307 per 1,000
population.
   -Texas, which receives almost one-quarter of the 2 million
requests made each year to state insurance departments for
information about the industry.
   -Delaware, which funnels 90 percent of its budget for consumer
services into handling complaints. The remainder goes for
information and education programs.
   -Kansas and Wisconsin, which each spent more than $1 million
this year for consumer services.
   Half of the states responding to the survey have a toll-free
telephone hotline for complaints about insurance.
   More than 40 percent of the states distribute information about
insurance pricing, the insolvency of some insurers and whether
there are large numbers of complaints against a particular company.
   Large states such as Pennsylvania spend a relatively small
amount on consumer services, $1.9 million, which comes out to $158
per 1,000 people. But employees in other parts of the state
insurance department take consumer inquiries, pointed out Amy
Dugan, a spokeswoman for the agency.
   State insurance departments set rates, approve mergers,
investigate consumer complaints and have the power to revoke
licenses of insurance companies. Federal law leaves all insurance
regulation to the states.
   The study was prepared by the Consumer Insurance Interest Group,
the National Association of Professional Insurance Agents, the
American Insurance Association and the American Council of Life
Insurance. The consumer group includes the Consumer Federation of
America, Public Citizen and the National Insurance Consumer
Organization.

<HEAD>The Donald and Ivana are Splitsville, Pricetag Still in Question</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SAMUEL MAULL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Donald Trump is back in the singles game. Now
the question is, how much is his freedom going to cost the virtuoso
dealmaker?
   A tearful Ivana Trump left court a single woman Tuesday after a
judge, citing Trump's ``cruel and inhuman treatment'' of his wife,
dissolved their 13-year marriage.
   That makes Trump, dubbed The Donald by Ivana during happier
times, one of the most eligible bachelors around.
   But with his financial empire crumbling, it's unclear how much
that freedom will cost him - and how eligible he'll be after paying
off.
   ``There are two parts to any marriage: One, are we married? And
two, do I owe you any money? Today we've cleared the way for the
real issue: division of property,'' said Jay Goldberg, Trump's
lawyer.
   The alleged other woman, Marla Maples, kept a low profile.
   ``Marla is out of town on business. She won't be having any
comment,'' said her spokesman, Chuck Jones.
   Michael Kennedy, Mrs. Trump's lawyer, said Ivana had nothing to
say after the uncontested divorce was approved, but Donald issued a
brief statement of good will.
   ``I wish Ivana the best. I have no doubt that she will do very
well in the years to come,'' he said.
   Whether Ivana, 41, will do well with proceeds of a marital
agreement updated in 1987 or with a larger piece of the Trump pie
remains to be seen. The marital pact calls for Ivana to receive $10
million and the couple's Connecticut estate, worth an estimated $12
million, lawyers have said.
   Child support, division of property and the validity of any
marital agreements will be decided at trial, unless they are
settled out of court.
   Mrs. Trump, in court papers filed earlier this year, said she
was seeking $2.5 billion of Trump's estimated $5 billion fortune -
a figure financial experts say has dwindled drastically in recent
months.
   The trial is expected to start April 11, Goldberg said.
   Trump's penchant for publicity backfired somewhat as his marital
troubles were splashed across newspapers, radio and television with
reports of his alleged affair with Miss Maples, a model who wants
to become an actress.
   A New York Post front-page headline quoted Miss Maples, 26, as
saying of her relationship with Trump: ``Best Sex I've Ever Had.''
A picture of a smirking Donald ran next to the headline.
   Further tales of their trysting, some liaisons allegedly carried
out virtually under Ivana's nose at Trump Tower, kept tongues
wagging coast to coast until Donald's financial woes edged news
about the breakup aside.
   Mrs. Trump argued in court papers that the couple's updated
agreement, signed in 1987, was drawn up while her husband was
already committing adultery and intended to leave her. Trump, 45,
maintains the agreement remains valid.
   It was not clear what effect the divorce would have on Mrs.
Trump's position as head of the Plaza Hotel. Trump, speaking later
at the Plaza, said he had not decided whether to keep his ex-wife
as an employee.
   Trump, who has come under pressure from creditors at his Taj
Mahal casino in Atlantic City and had to refinance millions in debt
to stay afloat, was zapped by the judge in the divorce decree.
   Judge Phyllis Gangel-Jacob Gangel-Jacob said, ``Mr. Trump's
cruel and inhuman treatment ... made it unsafe or improper to
continue to be married.''
   The Trumps have three children, ages 12, 8 and 6, who have been
staying with Mrs. Trump since the couple separated last winter.

<HEAD>Businessman: Kuwaiti Supplies Could Sustain Iraq For Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MAUD S. BEELMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Economic sanctions will not force
Saddam Hussein to back down because his legions looted enough from
Kuwait to sustain Iraq for years, a Canadian businessman who fled
the captive nation said early today.
   The Baghdad-born executive said he was ``utterly amazed by the
over-simplification of the issue ... that economic sanctions will
have their effects on Iraq.''
   ``What has been looted from Kuwait is enough to last the system
for up to 10 years,'' the 50-year-old businessman said.
   In addition to computers, cars and other consumer goods, he said
the amount of food taken from Kuwait could last Iraq at least two
years. ``This issue of starvation is highly exaggerated.''
   The University of California at Berkeley graduate lived in
Kuwait 11 years and through his work was closely connected to
Kuwaiti and Western businesses. He spoke on condition that he and
his company not be identified for fear colleagues in Kuwait would
be harrassed.
   There is widespread debate over whether the U.N. embargo on
trade with Iraq could by itself force Saddam to back out of Kuwait.
   The trade cutoff has shut down Iraq's oil exports and food
imports, but Baghdad has taken measures toward achieving
self-sufficiency.
   The Canadian was among 14 people who landed in Frankfurt late
Tuesday. The group included seven Americans, two Britons, two
Canadians, an Irishman, an Italian and an Australian.
   Their U.S.-chartered Boeing 707 was one of three jetliners
delivering former hostages from Iraq on Tuesday. Two others flew to
Bangkok and London.
   U.S. consulate spokesman Craig Springer said the men would take
commercial flights to their destinations.
   Saddam announced last week that he would free all those trapped
by the Aug. 2 invasion, and more than 170 former hostages arrived
in Frankfurt on Monday in the blanket release's first wave.
   Another flight, believed to be the last, is expected in
Frankfurt on Thursday, carrying the U.S. ambassador and embassy
staff from Kuwait.
   Most of the former hostages looked tired and refused to speak to
waiting reporters.
   Tom Litrenta, 28, of Allentown, Pa., said the mood on the flight
``was really quiet, believe it or not.''
   Litrenta, who left behind several Iraqi friends, said he had
mixed feelings about the Persian Gulf crisis.
   ``The people I talked to just said they want no more war,'' said
Litrenta, who was working on an irrigation project for the Iraqi
government. Iraq fought an eight-year war with Iran that ended with
a 1988 cease-fire.
   The Canadian businessman said an Iraqi friend in Kuwait asked
him to give President Bush a message ``that they hope he will not
betray them and they are waiting for him to liberate not only
Kuwait but the Iraqi people from this tyranny.''
   The businessman said he finally left Kuwait at the insistence of
his family, which is waiting for him in Mississauga, near Toronto.
   But he said he planned to continue lobbying for Kuwait's
liberation.
   ``I am willing to fight and encourage the world to flush them
out of Kuwait,'' he said. ``I believe the whole world is held
responsible for the catastrophe and the tragedy of Kuwait because
we don't unite against tyranny.''

<HEAD>Anderson's Sister Expresses Anger Over Plight Of Beirut Hostages</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hostage Terry Anderson's sister says she is
happy for freed Americans returning home from the Mideast this
week, but angry that her brother remains captive nearly six years
after being yanked from a Beruit street.
   ``This is not the first time, nor the second nor the third time
that our families have stood back and watched other hostage
situations being resolved,'' Peggy Say said Tuesday on NBC's
``Today'' show,
   While happy for those families, Mrs. Say said she is ``angry and
frustrated that the Beirut hostages have been known as the
forgotten hostages for almost six years now. And nobody seems to be
angry about that.
   ``I listened to President Bush and senators and congressmen
stand up on television and say America will not tolerate the
holding of its citizens. And my brother has been chained to a wall
in a dirty basement cell in Beirut - this will be his sixth
Christmas.
   ``For years we listened to `quiet diplomacy is the answer.'
Quiet diplomacy is not the answer,'' she said, stressing that
nothing will be done ``until people in the media put the feet of
the administration to the fire.''
   Anderson, The Associated Press' chief Middle East correspondent,
was kidnapped March 16, 1985. He has been in captivity the longest
of the six Americans and seven other Western hostages held by
radical Moslem groups in Lebanon.
   Mrs. Say, in a letter to Bush published in part in Tuesday's USA
Today, asks: ``When did my brother get lost in the course of human
events, Mr. President? Who declared his life and liberty less
valuable than that of any other hostage ever taken?''
   She said that while Bush spoke in ``indignant anger'' about the
hostages in Iraq, ``God help those that fall outside the realm of
political exposure and expediency.
   ``They can only weep in despair and puzzled wonder as their
president and peers continue to accept their desperate situation.''
   She noted that the last picture she received, from Irishman and
former hostage Brian Keenan, showed Anderson pedaling an exercise
bicycle with an 18-inch chain holding his wrist to the wall.

<TEXT>
   Troops have killed at least 26 more
guerrillas in a major offensive against the country's biggest rebel
group, the army says.
   The guerrillas of the leftist Colombian Revolutionary Armed
Forces were killed Tuesday while soldiers fanned out in the
mountains surrounding the rebels' fallen headquarters about 100
miles south of the capital.
   About 2,000 troops backed by fighter aircraft on Sunday stormed
the headquarters, known as ``Casa Verde.'' Observers said the
attack was the largest military move against rebel forces in 30
years.
   The army said 26 guerrillas were killed in Tuesday's fighting.
Newspaper and radio reports said at least 50 rebels have been
killed since Sunday.
   Eleven soldiers died in the weekend assault, an army report said
Tuesday, but no further army casualty reports were available.
   ``The military operations are continuing in order to guarantee
the integrity and security of troops still fighting in the area,''
army commander Gen. Manuel Murrillo told a news conference Tuesday.
   The guerrillas issued a communique Monday saying the army attack
was the beginning of a ``war of unpredictable consequences.'' The
commanders canceled peace talks they have intermittently maintained
with the government since 1982.
   The Revolutionary Armed Forces is Colombia's oldest and biggest
rebel outfit with about 6,000 combatants and tens of thousands of
supporters in the countryside.
   The army offensive began the same day Colombians went to the
polls to choose an assembly that will rewrite the country's
104-year-old constitution.
   M-19, a former rebel group that became a political party,
captured more votes than any other candidate list in the elections
and will control 19 of the assembly's 70 seats.
   The M-19 signed a peace treaty with the government nine months
ago in exchange for amnesty.
   Colombia's Communist Party issued a statement Monday saying the
army attack was an attempt to ``hang a sword'' over the constituent
assembly.

   Water will be rationed throughout Southern
California as the region nears the beginning of its fifth year of

   The Metropolitan Water District, which serves 15 million
customers in six counties, will fine cities and other agencies it
supplies if they surpass limits approved Tuesday.
   Residential use must be trimmed by 5 percent and farm suppliers
face 20 percent cuts beginning Feb. 1. Local agencies that go over
the limits will pay tripled fees.
   The limits directly affect local suppliers, not the 15 million
households, businesses and farms the district serves in Los
Angeles, Ventura, San Diego, San Bernardino, Riverside and Orange
counties.
   Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley said he has not decided whether to
impose mandatory rationing citywide, hoping voluntary reductions

<TEXT>
   The District of Columbia City Council has
given preliminary approval to legislation that would make
manufacturers of semiautomatic assault-style weapons liable for
injuries and deaths those guns cause in the nation's capital.
   The council voted for the bill 8-3, with two abstentions, on
Tuesday. A final vote was scheduled for next Tuesday.
   ``It's time for these merchants of death to pay a price,'' said
council member William Lightfoot, who sponsored the legislation.
``We can set a very meaningful precedent.''
   Carl Rowan Jr., a lobbyist for the National Rifle Association,
decried the law as ``good theater, but frivolous legislation'' that
could not stand constitutional scrutiny.
   ``I don't think it stands a chance in court,'' Rowan said.
   The city already has a very strict gun control law, and sales of
semiautomatic assault-style weapons have been illegal since 1976.
But police say criminals can get firearms in neighboring Maryland
and Virginia, which have less restrictive laws.

   Families of soldiers in the Middle East
lighted candles, sang songs and prayed for the troops in a vigil
held simultaneously in at least 47 cities in seven states along the
Mississippi and Ohio rivers.
   Church bells rang and riverboats aimed headlights skyward while
tooting their horns. People shone flashlights and lighted Christmas
trees on cue.
   ``What you have here I think is a major show of support for the
troops and the families,'' said organizer Marvin Peter of
Evansville, who has a son serving in Saudi Arabia. ``Everyone hopes
for peace.''
   The tribute began at 6:45 p.m. CST Tuesday in Indiana, Kentucky,
Ohio, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Tennessee and Virginia, Peter said.
Most lasted about 30 minutes.
   ``It was really an Ohio River Valley thing that just sort of
snowballed,'' he said. ``We never dreamed it would go this far.''
   Evansville and two other Ohio River cities, Henderson and
Owensboro in Kentucky, announced last month their plans for
simultaneous ceremonies Tuesday. After that, the idea spread to the
Mississippi River and some inland points.
   ``I came because I love my husband and I want him and all the
troops to know I support them,'' said Lisa Bean, who held a candle
among a crowd of more than 1,000 people praying at the Evansville

   Mrs. Beam said her husband, Marine Sgt. Michael Bean, was
scheduled to leave for Saudi Arabia this week.
   Vietnam veteran Russell Abrams joined 1,000 people in Owensboro
who listened as the names of local soldiers serving in the Persian
Gulf were read. He said such a ceremony could have boosted morale
during his three years serving in Southeast Asia.
   ``It would have done my heart a lot of good to know this was
going on at home instead of what was,'' he said.
   On the riverfront in Louisville, Ky., more than 200 people sang
``America the Beautiful'' and other patriotic songs. In Jackson,
Tenn., soldiers' families were given flags and ribbons to decorate
a ``tree of honor.''
   In Cincinnati, about 150 people at a riverside park held onto a
long piece of orange ribbon and sang ``Let There Be Peace on
Earth.'' A passing riverboat tooted its horn as they sang.
   Almost 90 towboats operated by American Commercial Barge Line
Co. were instructed to shine their lights into the air at 6:45 p.m.
and blow their whistles.

   Deposed President Hussain Muhammad
Ershad was arrested and confined to a house in an exclusive
diplomatic area on Wednesday, six days after yielding power under
massive public pressure.
   Ershad was escorted by three police cars and three army trucks
to the former home of the British ambassador, which was hastily
prepared for his detention.
   Ershad, with his wife Raushan and their 8-year-old son Shahd,
looked grim as he rode through the gate of the home in the Gulshan
district.
   The 60-year-old former army general resigned Thursday after
seven weeks of escalating street demonstrations for his ouster. His
opponents demand he stand trial to answer accusations of corruption
and abuse of power during his eight-year rule.
   More than 150 police surrounded the wall-enclosed building to
which Ershad was taken. It is opposite the British embassy, which
once served as a guest house for Queen Elizabeth II. The house had
stood empty for some time.
   A sign near the gate said ``Law Enforcement Commission,''
indicating it belongs to one of the country's security forces or
intelligence units.
   Only a few hours earlier, workmen were installing air
conditioners, beds and carpets in the two-story colonial-style
house. Police tents were pitched in the back garden.
   Also Wednesday, about 6,000 students chanting ``Hang Ershad''
marched from Dhaka University to the president's office just
outside the heavily guarded military compound where Ershad had
lived while in office.
   Students had played a key role in toppling Ershad, who took
power in the impoverished country of 110 million people in a
bloodless 1982 coup.
   On Tuesday, police said they were given orders to arrest Ershad
and some Cabinet ministers and other officials of his deposed
government. Police squads raided a dozen homes in search of
officials who had gone into hiding in fear of mob violence.
   Ershad's home minister, Mahmudul Hassan, was the first to be
placed under house arrest. Specific charges against him have not
been published.
   Mahmudul was in charge of the police and the paramilitary forces
assigned to keep order during the demonstrations.
   An estimated 100 people were killed during the campaign begun in
October that led to Ershad's resignation, most by security forces
and some in clashes between Ershad's supporters and his opponents.
   Ershad handed over the government to an caretaker administration
led by Supreme Court Chief Justice Shahabuddin Ahmed, who was
charged with the task of preparing for parliamentary elections
within 90 days.

   However, the Harrison, N.J.-based pet product giant admitted no

   The company agreed to pay $45,000 of the original $90,000 in

<HEAD>Pfizer Warns Patients About Heart Valves</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pfizer Inc. will conduct an unprecedented
search to warn about 23,000 patients about rare but often fatal
fractures of an implanted heart valve, officials say.
   The Food and Drug Administration said Tuesday it has accepted
Pfizer's plan to locate patients who have the Bjork-Shiley
60-degree convexo-concave heart valve.
   Valve fractures have occurred in about seeen of every 10,000
patients per year, the FDA said.
   The valve was implanted in about 82,000 people worldwide between
1979 and November 1986, when it was removed from the market. About
23,000 of the patients who are still alive are in the United States
and Canada.
   About 295 fractures of the valve were reported to the FDA, with
178 deaths resulting.
   When a valve fractures, a patient's life can be saved if the
valve is replaced quickly.
   ``That's why it is important for C-C valve patients to ask their
doctors how to recognize early signs of valve fracture and what to
do should it occur,'' FDA Deputy Commissioner James Benson said.
   Public Citizen Health Research Group, a Ralph Nader-founded
advocacy group, has been pressing the FDA and Pfizer for years to
notify patients about the danger.
   The company last week sent letters to about 19,000 heart
specialists telling them of the program and asking them to contact
patients who have the Shiley valve. About 450 hospitals are also
being contacted.
   On Thursday, the company will detail plans for a patient
registry that will include a toll-free telephone number for
patients to identify themselves. The program will be run by Medic
Alert, a nonprofit foundation, which has already set up a telephone
number where patients can get further information. The number is
1-800-245-1492.

<HEAD>Congressional Investigators Say EPA Lax on Cleanup Fraud</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Congressional investigators are accusing
auditors at the Environmental Protection Agency of not aggressively
pursuing potential fraud by private contractors involved in
millions of dollars in environmental cleanup programs.
   But EPA' Inspector General John Martin told a House subcommittee
Tuesday that he stands by his office's work and said its
investigations have led to 250 indictments since 1984 as well as
the recovery of $16 million in fines through administrative
actions.
   Investigators for both the House Energy and Commerce Committee
and for the General Accounting Office testified that hundreds of
EPA contracts have not been audited because of backlogs. And in
some cases, they said, questions of possible fraud have not been
pursued adequately.
   Three subcommittee investigators acknowledged, however, that
their year-long investigation uncovered no proof of fraud or
evidence of deliberate wrongdoing by EPA auditors.
   The GAO report said that most of EPA's contracts dating back
four years have yet to be audited because of a backlog both within
the EPA and at the Defense Contract Audit Agency, which handles may
of the contract reviews for the agency.
   The Defense audit agency has 273 outstanding requests for
contract audits from the EPA as of the end of last month, with 40
percent of them made more than two years ago, said the GAO
investigators.
   Martin, who has been the EPA's inspector general since late
1983, said the congressional investigators ``have not found fraud.
... They have not found anything wrong that we did not find
already. ... They found it in our files.''

   Share prices rose for the sixth consecutive day on
the Tokyo Stock Exchange today, while the dollar inched up against
the Japanese yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which gained
172.30 points Tuesday, added 42.44 points today, or 0.17 percent,
closing at 23,999.41. The index now has climbed 2,136.8 points in
six days.
   Heavy profit-taking selling pushed the index down at the start,
but active buying by institutional investors brought it back up,
securities dealers said.
   ``The strength of large capital shares, such as steel and
shipbuilding issues, indicates the bullish sentiment in the
market,'' said a dealer with Daiwa Securities Co., speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   Volume on the first section was estimated at 600 million shares,
up from 530 million Tuesday.
   On the currency market, the dollar closed at 131.88 yen, up 0.13
yen from Tuesday's close of 131.75 yen. It opened at 132.20 yen and
moved in a range of 131.75-132.28 yen.
   Currency dealers said a feeling that the U.S. currency is
undervalued motivated market players to actively buy the dollar.
   But when the dollar climbed above 132.20 yen, investors it to
buy yen, dealers said.
   ``It is unlikely the dollar is going to move in any one
direction,'' said Yukio Mukoyama, deputy general manager of Fuji
Bank's international treasury division.
   Spot trading totaled $7.51 billion, down from Tuesday's $9.47
billion.
   In bond dealings, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds was at 87.90 points at 5 p.m. (3 a.m.

<HEAD>Dead Sea Scrolls Editor's Exit Tied to Anti-Semitic Remarks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Harvard divinity professor's dismissal as
editor in chief of the Dead Sea Scrolls was prompted by remarks
attacking Judaism, The New York Times said today.
   In a newspaper interview published last month in Israel,
Professor John Strugnell was quoted as describing Judaism as
``originally racist'' and suggesting that all Jews should convert
to Christianity.
   In dismissing Strugnell as editor of the scrolls last week, the
international team of scholars overseeing the work had cited health
problems and criticism of the slow pace at which the ancient
documents are being published.
   But the Times said today that Strugnell's colleagues
acknowledged that the anti-Jewish remarks had forced the issue.
   ``The interview certainly contributed,'' said Frank Moore Cross,
another Harvard scholar on the Dead Sea Scrolls team. ``But the
interview was impossible without his illness.''
   Strugnell, 60, who has been editor since 1987, could not be
reached for comment, the Times said. Harvard spokesman Peter Costa
said he was in a hospital, which was not identified, for treatment
of an illness, which was not disclosed.
   The Times reported that several of Strugnell's colleagues said
he had a drinking problem, while others alluded to his ``mental
condition.''
   The Dead Sea Scrolls, discovered in 1947 in a cave in what is
now the Israeli-occupied West Bank, contain the oldest known copies
of the Old Testament, other Biblical writings, ancient literature
and poetry.
   The scrolls illuminate the evolution of Judaism and the origins
of Christianity. About 35 percent to 45 percent of the scrolls
remain unpublished.
   The interview with Strugnell was published Nov. 9 in Haaretz, a
Tel Aviv newspaper.
   In the interview, Strugnell, a Roman Catholic, was quoted as
saying of Judaism: ``It's a horrible religion. It's a Christian
heresy, and we deal with our heretics in different ways. You are a
phenomenon that we haven't managed to convert - and we should have
managed.''
   The Israeli journalist who interviewed Strugnell, Avi Katzman,
said in an article in Biblical Archeology Review: ``Although
Strugnell drank beer throughout the interview - this did not
surprise me as his drinking habits are well known in Jerusalem - he
did not appear to be inebriated. He was lucid and spoke in a firm
voice.''

<HEAD>Japanese Politicians to Seek Understanding from U.S. Black Leaders</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two Japanese legislators flew to the United States
today to meet with American black leaders and seek to cool tempers
inflamed by insulting remarks the justice minister made about
blacks.
   Yoshiro Mori and Motoji Kondo, senior legislators representing
the governing Liberal Democratic Party, were to visit Washington,
New York and Los Angeles.
   ``We're going at Prime Minister (Toshiki) Kaifu's request, but
also because I feel personally worried that we haven't really dealt
with the problem yet,'' Mori said in an interview.
   On Sept. 21, following a police roundup of foreign prostitutes
in Tokyo, Justice Minister Seiroku Kajiyama said they ``ruin the
atmosphere of the neighborhoods they move into. The area is
becoming mixed just like in America where blacks move in and whites
are forced out.''
   Kajiyama's comment was the latest in a series of
minority-related faux pas by Japanese politicians, slips that many
analysts blame on ignorance and insensitivity to racial issues.
   Kajiyama apologized for his remark and was publicly reprimanded
by Kaifu. Leaders of the Congressional Black Caucus and other
groups have demanded more drastic action.
   They want Kajiyama's resignation and the teaching of black
American history and culture in Japanese schools.
   Foreign Ministry spokesman Taizo Watanabe said his ministry
``highly recommended'' the legislators' mission to the United
States.
   ``It should not be a one-shot effort,'' Watanabe said, but the
first of several such bridge-building efforts.
   Mori said he and Kondo hoped to explain to black leaders that
Japan takes the issue seriously, although demanding Kajiyama's
resignation ``was going too far.'' He said the government planned
to promote more awareness of American minorities, although changes
in school curricula usually take time.
   ``Until now, we've tended to avoid teaching about such bad
aspects of American society as racial tensions. We thought it would
be disrespectful. Now, I guess we'd better start,'' Mori said.
   Mori said white Americans were to blame for teaching the
Japanese racist attitudes.
   ``I want to stress that Japanese themselves have no bad feelings
toward blacks or other minorities. And we respect the United States
for making a free and open society with such a diverse mixture of
peoples,'' he said.
   He said Japan must deal with its own complicated racial
attitudes.
   The Korean minority in Japan and people from other Asian
countries face social and economic discrimination. Japanese
designated centuries ago as belonging to the ``Burakumin,'' or
``village people'' caste, also face deep-rooted prejudice.
   ``Japan, with all its wealth, hasn't made Southeast Asian
refugees feel welcome. And we colonized Korea for 37 long years. We
really must reflect on that,'' Mori said. ``It's about time we
resolved these issues.''
   In 1986, former Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone aroused U.S.
anger when he said intelligence levels in the United States were
inferior ``because of a considerable number of blacks, Puerto
Ricans and Mexicans.''
   In 1988, Michio Watanabe, the Liberal Democrats' policy chief,
said American blacks had few qualms about going bankrupt, implying
that they walk away from their debts.
   Such comments incensed minority groups, which also have accused
Japanese firms operating in the United States of deliberately
discriminating against blacks and Hispanics in their hiring
policies.
   Those groups plan rallies outside the Japanese Embassy in
Washington and Japanese consulates in other cities on Saturday to
express their dissatisfaction with Japanese racial attitudes, said
Masatake Takahashi, an international political commentator who
helped organize the legislators' visit.
   They also have called for a boycott of Japanese imports to drive
their point home.

   President Bush will advocate a constitutional
amendment to limit the number of terms for members of Congress,
says his chief of staff.
   Bush has been on record for some time as favoring the idea -
which is enjoying increasing grassroots support - but it remains
unclear how hard he will push the issue.
   The president also is on record as favoring constitutional
amendments to ban abortions and flag burning, to require a balanced
budget and to give president line-item veto power over
congressional appropriations.
   All are issues with intense, passionate support among those who
favor them - but far less support in Congress, where a two-thirds
majority is required to submit a constitutional amendment to the
states for ratification.
   The idea of pushing for a limitation on congressional terms, in
particular, could be politically tempting for a president
attempting to convince voters that his programs are being stymied
by a recalcitrant Congress dominated members of the opposite party
- Democrats, in the current instance.
   John Sununu, Bush's chief of staff, concluded a lengthy speech
at the National Press Club on Tuesday by outlining some of the
agenda Bush will pursue during the upcoming session of Congress.
   ``The president will continue to press for reforms such as a
line-item veto, he will press for reforms in campaign financing,
and he will press for a term-limitation amendment that deals with
the problems associated with perpetuating the life of those who are
elected to govern people - the public life of those who are elected
to govern people,'' said Sununu.
   ``The reality that incumbency breeds a very different attitude
is now sensed by the public and I think if you take a look at what
was intended as a structure by those that founded this country,
you'll see we've moved a great distance from it.''

   According to a statement, a Marine from the assault ship USS Iwo
Jima died of a presumed heart attack after collapsing while
participating in group physical fitness training in Bahrain.
   A medical response team was unable to revive the Marine, who was
pronounced dead at 8:30 a.m.
   The died Marine who died of a presumed ruptured brain aneurysm
was medically evacuated to the hospital ship USNS Comfort after
complaining of nausea, diarrhea and headaches, the military said in
a second statement.
   He was assigned to the 1st Ballation, 2nd Marine Regiment from
Camp Lejeune, N.C.
   On Sunday, an Army soldier serving with Bravo Co. of the 724th
Maintenance Support Battalion was killed when the tractor-trailer
truck he was driving overturned, pinning him in the cab.
   The soldier, who was on a routine water supply training mission,
was pronounced dead at the scene. He was identiifed as Pvt. Scott

<TEXT>
   Six days after yielding power under
massive public pressure, deposed President Hussain Muhammad Ershad
was arrested today and confined to a house in an exclusive
diplomatic area.
   Home Secretary Azimuddin Ahmed said Ershad and his wife Raushan
were ordered detained for 120 days under a law that permits arrest
without charges.
   ``He has been put under safe custody. There are no formal
charges as yet,'' Azimuddin said.
   Police sources said arrest orders were issued for 16 people,
including Ershad, his wife and former Home Minister Mahmudul
Hassan, who was placed under house arrest on Tuesday.
   Ershad, a 60-year-old former army general, resigned Dec. 6 after
seven weeks of escalating street demonstrations for his ouster. His
opponents demand he stand trial to answer accusations of corruption
and abuse of power during his eight-year rule.
   Ershad was escorted by three police cars and three army trucks
to the former home of the British ambassador, which was hastily
prepared for his detention.
   The ex-president looked grim as he rode through the gate of the
home in the Gulshan district. He was in the back seat of a private
car with his wife and 8-year-old son Shahd.
   More than 150 police surrounded the walled house opposite the
British embassy. The two-story colonial-style house once served as
a guest house for Queen Elizabeth II but has been empty for some
time.
   A sign near the gate said ``Law Enforcement Commission.''
Azimuddin said the building was administered by the Home Ministry
and was being used to hold Ershad since he has no personal home in
the capital.
   Thirty minutes before Ershad arrived at the house, guards were
cautioned by their officers not to salute or stand at attention for
the ousted leader.
   A few hours earlier workmen hastily installed air conditioners,
beds and carpets. Police tents were pitched in the back garden.
Azimuddin said no telephone lines would be connected to the house
for Ershad's use.
   Earlier, army officers and police chased reporters away from the
presidential home Ershad had occupied in the city's heavily guarded
military compound. His telephones were apparently disconnected.
   About 6,000 students marched from Dhaka University to the
president's office just outside the compound and chanted ``Hang
Ershad.''
   The students were at the forefront of the campaign to oust
Ershad, who seized power in a bloodless 1982 oup and ruled under
martial law for four years. He then resigned from the army and was
elected president in 1986 in elections his opponents accused him of
rigging.
   Mahmudul, the former home minister, was the first to be
arrested. He was in charge of the police and the paramilitary
forces assigned to keep order during the demonstrations that
toppled Ershad. An estimated 100 people were killed in the protests
that began in October, most by security forces and some in clashes
between Ershad's supporters and opponents.
   When Ershad resigned six days ago, he handed over the government
to a caretaker administration led by Supreme Court Chief Justice
Shahabuddin Ahmed. Shahabuddin says he has no political ambitions
of his own, and his main task is to prepare for parliamentary
elections within 90 days.

   Monday night football got its highest ratings
of the season and made ABC No. 1 for the second time this fall.
   The network grabbed a 27 average rating with the Dec. 3 ``NFL
Monday Night Football'' game between the San Francisco 49ers and
the New York Giants, the A.C. Nielsen Co. reported Tuesday. Each
ratings point represents 931,000 homes.
   ABC won the week with a 12.7 average. The network's only other
win this fall came last month when the game between the Los Angeles
Raiders and the Miami Dolphins helped the network trounce its
competitors with a 13.4 average.
   Usually first-place NBC fell to second last week with an 11.9.
CBS was in its usual third place with an 11.1.
   ``60 Minutes'' on CBS got its highest ratings of the season and
finished second with a 23 average.
   ``Cheers'' on NBC, the No. 1 favorite for much of the season,
dropped to third.
   The three-minute premiere of Fox Broadcasting's new ``Simpsons''
video, shown at the end of Thursday's regularly scheduled episode,
helped push the animated family up the Nielsen ladder.
   The video, titled ``Do the Bartman,'' scored higher ratings than
the 30-minute ``Simpsons'' episode that preceded it. The video
earned a 16.1 average. ``The Simpsons'' earned a 14.9 and landed in
20th place.
   In the network news, ABC, with Peter Jennings, won its 48th
consecutive week with a 12.2 average. NBC and Tom Brokaw tied with
CBS and Dan Rather with a 10.
   Here are the top 10 shows, their network and rating: ``NFL
Monday Night Football,'' ABC, 27; ``60 Minutes,'' CBS, 23;
``Cheers,'' NBC, 21.4; ``Roseanne,'' ABC, 19; ``A Different

<HEAD>Solzhenitsyn Refuses Soviet Prize for `Gulag Archipelago'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Exiled writer Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn has refused
a Soviet literary prize for ``The Gulag Archipelago,'' saying that
``the phenomenon of the Gulag has not been overcome either legally
or morally.''
   The prize, announced Tuesday, was granted by the Russian
republic for Solzhenitsyn's three-volume account of Stalin's prison
amps, published in the mid-1970s but only recently made available
in the Soviet Union.
   In a statement issued by his New York publisher, Farrar, Straus
&amp; Giroux, Solzhenitsyn said, ``This book is about the suffering of
millions and I cannot reap an honor from it.''
   Solzhenitsyn, who was expelled from the Soviet Union in 1974 and
lives in seclusion in Cavendish, Vt., expressed gratitude to the
committee for selecting ``The Gulag Archipelago.''
   The award is part of a process of rehabilitating artists and
writers banned or disgraced under Mikhail Gorbachev's predecessors.
   Despite the changes in his native country under Gorbachev,
Solzhenitsyn has remained a harsh critic of the Soviet government.
   He noted that ``The Gulag Archipelago'' is still hard to find in
the Soviet Union and ``is being sold on the black market at
exorbitant prices.''

<HEAD>Calif. County Imposes Near-Ban on Animal Breeding</HEAD>
<DATELINE>REDWOOD CITY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   San Mateo County has tentatively
approved what is believed to be the first measure in the nation to
require owners of dogs and cats to either buy a breeding license or
get their pets sterilized.
   Over the protests of pet owners, the Board of Supervisors
approved the measure 4-1 Tuesday after a four-hour hearing that
drew breeders from across the country. The ordinance faces a second
vote next week before becoming final.
   The ban on unlicensed breeding is intended to reduce the number
of unwanted animals put to death.
   Under the ordinance, effective in 1992, professionals and
amateurs would have to obtain a license to breed their pets or else
spay or neuter them. Rules for the program, such as the cost of the
license, have not been worked out.
   The ordinance would affect only unincorporated areas of San
Mateo County, or about 10 percent of the 628,000 people in the
primarily suburban, well-to-do county immediately south of San
Francisco. Thus, it would not apply to such communities as Redwood
City, San Mateo, Menlo Park and South San Francisco.
   ``We just lost,'' said Betty-Anne Stenmark, a member of
Responsible Dog Breeders of San Mateo County.
   She and others said they may challenge the ordinance in court.
   The Peninsula Humane Society has said some 10,000 stray dogs and
cats a year are put to death in San Mateo County. Breeders argued
that they were not responsible for the pet overpopulation problem.
They blamed that on stray animals.
   During the meeting, some in the audience hissed rock singer
Grace Slick of the Jefferson Starship as the animal rights activist
spoke in favor of the ordinance.
   ``We're users, the human race. One of the things we use the most
are the animals,'' she said.
   Outside, one of about 50 demonstrators against the ordinance
carried a sign reading, ``If the Humane Society had been in
Hollywood, there would be no Lassie.''
   When introduced, the legislation called for an outright ban on
pet breeding. It was later amended to allow owners and breeders to
obtain licenses.
   It was further amended Tuesday night to require breeders seeking
a license to submit a plan showing how their litter would be used
and pledging that most of the offspring would be spayed or
neutered.

   The dollar was lower against most major foreign
currencies today in early European trading. Gold prices were little
changed.
   Jim O'Neil, international economist at Swiss Bank Corp. in
London, predicted the dollar would continue to fall.
   ``With U.S. interest rates under so much downward pressure, it
is very hard to see it (the dollar) bouncing from these levels,''
O'Neil said.
   In Tokyo, the dollar rose 0.13 yen to a closing 131.88 yen.
Later, in London, it was quoted at a lower rate of 131.45 yen.
   Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Tuesday:
   -1.4740 German marks, down from 1.4790
   -1.2585 Swiss francs, down from 1.2665
   -5.0040 French francs, down from 5.0230

   -1,110.50 Italian lire, up from 1,110.07
   -1.1605 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1591
   In London, the British pound was quoted at $1.9475, up from
$1.9400 late Tuesday.
   Bullion trading was quiet, dealers said.
   ``There isn't much out there to put any sparkle in the market
either way,'' said a trader in London.
   London's major bullion dealers fixed a recommended gold price of
$371.90 per ounce at midmorning, up from $370.75 bid per ounce late
Tuesday.
   In Zurich, the bid price was $371.85, unchanged from late
Tuesday.
   Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $2.74 to close at a bid
$372.62.
   Silver traded in London at a bid price of $4.07 a troy ounce,
from Tuesday's $4.06.

   What was to have been Armand
Hammer's bar mitzvah instead became a tribute to the industrialist
one day after his death.
   ``The beauty of it is that while we are celebrating this
evening, my grandfather is celebrating the best bar mitzvah ever in
heaven,'' said Michael Hammer said Tuesday night at the
star-studded ceremony at the Beverly Hilton.
   Eight hundred guests paid as much as $500 a plate to attend the
event, with the money going to Jewish charities.
   Hammer, who died Monday at age 92, had planned the event as both
a fund-raiser and a long-delayed observance of the ceremony marking
a Jewish boy's passage into adulthood. Hammer was born a Jew but
didn't have a bar mitzvah at the traditional age of 13 because his
socialist father eschewed religious practices.
   As it turned out, the event marked the final fund-raiser
organized by the flamboyant, globe-trotting chairman of Occidental
Petroleum Corp. who raised millions for cancer research and other
causes.
   ``I think he was a trailblazer and contributed a great deal of
resources to cure cancer, to free Soviet Jews and to help children
all over the world,'' said actor Elliot Gould, emcee of the event.
   Others who attended included former Govs. Edmund G. ``Pat''
Brown Sr. and Edmund G. ``Jerry'' Brown Jr; actors Cesar Romero and
Shelley Winters, and Ida Nudel, a Soviet refusenik brought from
Moscow to Israel by Hammer in 1987.
   ``He was a great man,'' she said.
   Hammer, who promoted and profited from trade with the Soviet
Union throughout most of the 20th century, knew every Soviet leader
from Lenin to Mikhail Gorbachev.
   He is to be entombed Thursday in the family mausoleum at
Westwood Village Memorial Park in Los Angeles, not far from
Occidental Petroleum's headquarters and the Armand Hammer Museum of
Art and Culture, which opened last month.

   Courtroom spectators screamed threats at the
judge, prosecutor and jurors when two more defendants were
convicted in the attack on a jogger who was gang-raped and beaten
nearly to death in Central Park.
   Kevin Richardson, 16, on Tuesday became the first of five people
convicted in the April 1989 attack to be found guilty of attempted
murder. He also was convicted of rape, sodomy, robbery, assault and
riot.
   Kharey Wise, 18, was cleared of the more serious charges but
found guilty of assault, sexual abuse and riot. One juror said
physical evidence, like that against Richardson, was lacking in
Wise's case.
   The verdicts came after 12 days of deliberations in the case,
which rested chiefly on videotaped statements the defendants made
to police. The defense had argued that the teen-agers were
intimidated and told what to say by police.
   Family members and other supporters erupted when the verdicts
against Richardson were read, jumping to their feet, yelling
threats and waving fists.
   Some yelled ``white justice'' or ``white racist'' and accused
the judge and prosecutor of railroading Wise and Richardson, who
are black. The victim is white.
   Richardson's mother, Grace Cuffey, fainted in the pandemonium,
and the court was cleared so emergency workers could administer
oxygen.
   As Wise was led from the courtroom in handcuffs, he turned to
Assistant District Attorney Elizabeth Lederer and said: ``You,
bitch, you're going to pay for this.''
   Lederer, who won convictions against three other defendants in
an earlier trial stemming from the attack, was escorted from court
by police.
   The case symbolized rising fears of random violence in New York
City and brought the term ``wilding'' into the city's mainstream
vocabulary. Wilding is a street term for indiscriminate rampages of
violence and robberies.
   Critics in the black community said the case received wide
attention only because the victim, an investment banker, was white
and affluent.
   Wise and Richardson face sentencing on Jan. 9. Richardson,
charged as a minor, could get a maximum of five to 10 years in
prison.
   Wise, who was charged as an adult because he was 16 when the
attack took place, could be sentenced to eight and two-thirds to 26
years in prison.
   Defense attorneys said they would appeal.
   Juror Victoria Bryers said Richardson was convicted of the more
serious charges because of stronger physical evidence, which
included strands of the jogger's hair found on his clothing, and
his underwear, which was heavily soiled on the inside with mud and
grass stains.
   In his videotaped statement, Wise claimed he only fondled the
woman's legs while holding her down as others beat and raped her.
He said the attack ``was my first rape, and it will be my last.''
   Richardson admitted less during his statement but acknowledged
he was there during the attack.
   The woman, now 30, was left near death with severe head
injuries. She was found about four hours later, unconscious,
bleeding and covered with mud.
   She lost three-quarters of her blood and was initially given
little chance of survival. She recovered and returned to her job
but suffers lingering problems with her vision, balance and ability
to smell.
   Antron McCray, Yusef Salaam, and Raymond Santana, all 16, were
convicted in August of rape, assault and other charges. Each was
sentenced to five to 10 years in prison. Steven Lopez, 16, faces
trial early next year.
   Colin Moore, Wise's attorney, repeated complaints that the
defendants received unduly vigorous prosecution because they come
from poor minority neighborhoods.
   ``These young men did not have a snowball's chance in hell,'' he
said.

   Church officials praised a judge's ruling that
the government violated the First Amendment rights of church groups
when it infiltrated and secretly tape-recorded religious
gatherings.
   U.S. District Judge Roger Strand ruled Tuesday the government
``does not have unfettered discretion to conduct investigations and
law enforcement activities.''
   The infiltration came during an investigation of the sanctuary
movement, which provided shelter to undocumented Central Americans
fleeing political persecution in their homelands.
   The investigation resulted in the conviction of eight people in
May 1986 on conspiracy and alien-smuggling charges. No prison terms
were levied.
   Four Arizona churches and two national denominations sued the
federal government later that year over the Immigration and
Naturalization Service's use of paid informers to secretly record
church services in 1984.
   ``This is a good victory for one of the basic founding
principles of this country, and that was the free exercise of
religion from government interference,'' said the Rev. John Fife,
pastor of the Southside Presbyterian Church in Tucson, one of the
churches that sued.
   ``The government is constitutionally precluded from unbridled
and inappropriate covert activity which has as its purpose or
objective the abridgement of the First Amendment freedoms of those
involved,'' Strand wrote.
   But he rejected the churches' claim that their Fourth Amendment
rights against unreasonable search and seizure were violated
because investigators did not obtain search warrants.
   Patrick Kane, acting director of the Phoenix INS region, said
the agency was satisfied with the ruling, claiming a partial
victory because Strand did not find the INS or its agents guilty of
specific crimes.
   ``We see it simply as a validation of the fact that our officers
conducted their investigation according to the proper procedures
and in an appropriate manner,'' Kane said.
   Fife said Kane was interpreting the decision to his advantage
   ``The government was wrong in their sanctuary investigation and
they're wrong in (the INS) assertion,'' he said.
   The other plaintiffs were Camelback United Presbyterian Church
and Sunrise United Presbyterian Church of Phoenix, the Presbyterian
Church (U.S.A.) and the American Lutheran Church.

   A murderer made a 25-year mistake when he appealed
his sentence in a 1986 slaying, a prosecutor said.
   Robert Hernandez was convicted of murder in the slaying of a man
trying to protect his brother during an argument, and sentenced to
65 years in prison. He appealed the sentence on the basis of what
he claimed was an error during the trial's punishment phase and in
1988 won a new trial.
   A new jury on Tuesday sentenced him to 90 years in prison and
added a $10,000 fine.
   ``That appeal turned out to be a 25-year mistake,'' said
prosecutor Clark Birdsall.
   Hernandez was convicted of stabbing Ruben Lueda to death Sept.
27, 1986. Two years later, an appeals court ruled that prosecutors
erred during closing arguments by inviting jurors to consider state
parole laws during their deliberations.
   Because the improper argument occurred during the punishment
phase, the court ruled that he deserved only a new punishment
hearing.
   Jurors were unaware of the earlier sentence Hernandez received
for killing Lueda less than three months after he was paroled from
prison after serving 10 years of a 99-year prison sentence for
aggravated robbery.
   Defense lawyer Brad Lollar said the stiffer sentence is
misleading because any sentence of 60 years or more is weighed the
same by the parole board.
   Hernandez will not be eligible for parole until 2006.
   Lollar said he will appeal the latest sentence.

<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has urged the
Communist Party to fight those ``who are trying to topple the
Soviet Union,'' according to a report published today.
   Publication of Gorbachev's comments came the day after the
chairman of the KGB security police warned that unidentified
foreign powers were waging a ``secret war'' against Soviet
authorities.
   Gorbachev, in remarks Tuesday ending a two-day plenum of the
party's Central Committee, renewed his calls for a new Union Treaty
to retain central control over the politics and economies of the 15
Soviet republics.
   The committee approved Gorbachev's proposed draft treaty,
despite complaints from representatives of some republics that it
did not give them enough power.
   Gorbachev said that Soviet leaders had ``abandoned the policy of
diktat from the center.'' But he took issue with the sovereignty
and independence declarations that have been passed by the
legislatures of all the Soviet republics except Kirgizia in Central
Asia.
   ``We must not give a helping hand to those who are trying to
topple the Soviet Union under the guise of criticizing the old
center,'' Gorbachev said. His remarks were published by the
Communist Party newspaper Pravda.
   ``We must beware of falling from one extreme to the other,
instead of ... strong central government, to have something that
resembles an amoeba,'' he said.
   KGB chairman Vladimir Kryuchkov voiced even stronger concerns
Tuesday night in a nationally televised address.
   ``Workers of the KGB see their duty in preventing interference
into our domestic affairs by foreign special services, and those
foreign organizations and groups who ... have for decades conducted
and continue to conduct a secret war against the Soviet people,''
he said.
   In remarks reminiscent of Cold War rhetoric, Kryuchkov
threatened to crack down against what he described as a efforts to
block food from being sold though state-owned stores.
   Kryuchkov, saying he spoke on Gorbachev's orders, described a
complex conspiracy in which ``special services'' of unidentified
foreign powers were working in tandem with ``ultra-radicals'' to
reap financial and political capital while seeking to ``shatter''
the Soviet state.
   ``The formation of some ultra-radical political movements is not
at all spontaneous but it is deliberate and well thought out. Some
of them have ample material and moral support from abroad,'' he
said.
   ``Destructive elements take the path of organizing what in
effect is economic sabotage, aggravating the situation in the
consumer market,'' said Kryuchkov.
   He said the KGB would work to fight ``economic sabotage'' and
prevent foreign products from being illegally diverted.
   ``Any attempts to hinder these activities will be resolutely
stopped by all means that are at the disposal of the KGB,'' he
said.

<TEXT>
   A powerful state legislator has been indicted on
fraud charges in an alleged real estate scheme involving the sale
of cooperative apartments in New York City.
   Assembly Speaker Mel Miller - the state's most powerful Democrat
next to Gov. Mario Cuomo - was charged Tuesday with Jay E. Adolf, a
top aide and former law partner, with cheating their law clients
out of hundreds of thousands of dollars.
   But Miller said the federal indictment contains ``baseless and
outrageous charges'' that he will challenge in court.
   ``I have never defrauded anyone in my life,'' Miller said
Tuesday.
   The allegations, unrelated to Miller's legislative duties, stem
from three real estate transactions in the mid-1980s allegedly
engineered by Miller and Adolf.
   ``They were taking advantage of their positions as attorneys to
turn a profit without the knowledge of their clients,'' said Andrew
J. Maloney, U.S. attorney.
   Miller and Adolf were named in a 19-count indictment charging
them with mail fraud, conspiracy and falsifying documents. The
federal felonies are each punishable by up to five years in prison
and $250,000 fines.
   If convicted of a felony, Miller would be expelled from the
Legislature.
   The men will be arraigned next week.
   Miller has denied any wrongdoing and said federal law enforcers
targeted him because he was a prominent politician. Maloney denied
the charge.
   Gerald B. Lefcourt, Miller's lawyer, said of his client: ``He
feels among a hunted class of well-known politicians and he is
going to deal with it in court.''
   Adolf also has denied any wrongdoing.
   In one alleged scheme, Miller and Adolf are accused of cheating
clients of their Manhattan law firm, Adolf &amp; Miller, by secretly
investing in valuable apartments in a Brooklyn building that was
being converted to cooperative apartments. At the same time, they
were representing a group of investors who were purchasing
apartments in the same building, according to prosecutors.
   In another scheme involving the same building, Miller and Adolf
allegedly acquired the apartment of a deceased former client by
preparing a false affidavit indicating the client had given her
purchase rights to a co-conspirator of the defendants.
   The defendants quickly disposed of the apartments at two to
three times the original purchase price, prosecutors said.
   Miller, 51, a native of Brooklyn who still lives in that
borough's Flatbush section, has served in the Assembly since 1970,
where he's earned a reputation as outspoken liberal unwilling to
shrink from a battle.
   ``He indicated to me he felt kind of liberated by the
announcement because now he can fight this thing and can fight it
publicly,'' Cuomo said.
   Miller and Adolf have given up their law practice.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Matthew E. Fishbein, who is prosecuting
the case, said that under state law the defrauded clients may seek
the return of some $238,000 paid in legal fees to the Adolf &amp;
Miller firm.

<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union has no plans for any military
involvement in the Persian Gulf, Foreign Minister Eduard
Shevardnadze told lawmakers today.
   ``None of our moves on the international scene and none of our
diplomatic actions implied, given even the wildest fantasy, any
participation of Soviet combat, auxiliary or any other troops or
units in any military operations in the gulf area,'' Shevardnadze
advised Soviet lawmakers.
   ``Speculation on this score was totally groundless,''
Shevardnadze said in a text given to the legislators and reported
by the official Tass news agency.
   The foreign minister, who is in the United States, sent the text
to the Soviet parliament after a right-wing group of deputies
accused him of preparing to send Soviet troops to the gulf without
legislative approval.
   Moscow pulled its troops out of Afghanistan in 1989 after nine
years fighting guerrillas trying to overthrow the Afghan
government.
   ``The Soviet Union does not and never had plans to get involved
in any form in a possible military conflict in the gulf,''
Shevardnadze said.
   ``I dismiss as naive accusations by those who would like to
project matters as if the Foreign Ministry and the minister
personally are heading toward a war in the Middle East,'' Tass
quoted the text as saying. ``We did not nurture this thought even
for a single moment. We totally excluded this.''
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Shevardnadze in recent weeks
have abandoned their cautious tone regarding Iraq's invasion of
Kuwait and threatened to support military action unless Saddam
Hussein's forces end their 4-month-old occupation of the emirate.
   Although Shevardnadze told lawmakers there were no plans to send
Soviet troops to the gulf, he did not rule out the possibility that
sometime in the future the executive branch might have to act
without parliament's consent.
   ``We will act this way if the lives and security of Soviet
citizens appear to be jeopardized, when rapid and decisive actions
are needed to save them,'' he said.
   In his meetings with Secretary of State James A. Baker III,
Shevardnadze urged the Bush administration to find ``a sensible
way'' out of the gulf crisis in negotiations with Iraq. ``There is
still potential for a peaceful solution,'' he said at a joint news
conference Tuesday with Baker.
   At that session, Shevardnadze reiterated Soviet support for U.N.
Security Council resolutions imposing an international trade
embargo on Iraq and threatening military force unless Iraq
withdraws by Jan. 15.
   Of Soviet participation in military action against Iraq,
Shevardnadze said: ``This option is not under consideration. This
option is non-existent.''
   While Baker said on Tuesday he did not request Soviet military
help, he has asked Moscow in the past for at least a token
contribution. The Soviet Union has some ships in waters off Iraq,
but has not deployed any other forces to join the U.S.-led
multinational force assembled against Iraq.
   Fewer than 3,000 Soviet advisers remain in Iraq, a one-time ally
of the Soviet Union. More than 400 have left in the past week.
   On Tuesday, lawmakers from the Russian republic parliament told
national leaders not the let the country get caught up in a
military confrontation in the gulf.
   The Russian Congress of People's Deputies said in a non-binding
resolution that Gorbachev must not let the country be drawn ``into
a military conflict in the gulf that could lead to very grave
consequences for global peace and stability.''

   Lech Walesa resigned as Solidarity
chairman today and asked the trade union he led for a decade to
support the ``big changes'' he intends to make as the nation's
president.
   ``I want to thank you for our common effort, thanks to which we
achieved the greatest honor,'' Walesa told a meeting of the
Solidarity national commission in Gdansk, where the movement was
born in the shipyard strikes of 1980. ``It is an honor, and at the
same time a great responsibility. I hope you will support the
Polish reforms.''
   Solidarity, the Soviet bloc's first free trade federation,
spearheaded changes that led to the toppling of Poland's Communist
government and helped cause peaceful revolutions elsewhere in
Eastern Europe.
   The Solidarity leaders passed by acclamation a resolution
thanking Walesa for his leadership. ``He has well served his
homeland,'' it said.
   Walesa, who is to be sworn in by parliament for a five-year
presidential term about Dec. 21, is conducting ``intensive talks''
about naming a new prime minster and Cabinet, said Solidarity
spokesman Andrzej Drzycinski.
   The president-elect urged Solidarity to be active in free
parliament elections this spring and help Poland weather the
difficult transition to a capitalist economy and democracy.
   Walesa appealed for support in fending off any ``attack of the
Tyminskis,'' referring Stanislaw Tyminski, his defeated opponent in
the presidential race who had promised quick prosperity for
economically struggling Poland.
   Tyminski left for Canada today after posting a $100,000 bond to
assure his return to answer charges of slander. The emigre
businessman lost by a 3-to-1 margin to Walesa in Sunday's runoff.
   Tyminski, who holds Polish, Canadian and Peruvian citizenship,
had to plead with prosecutors to allow him to leave the country
because of a pending case alleging that he defamed Prime Minister
Tadeusz Mazowiecki during the campaign.
   Tyminski, 42, accompanied by his Peruvian wife, Graciela, was
seen off this morning at Warsaw's Okecie Airport by about 50
supporters chanting his name and ``Poland is with You.''
   ``I am of Poland,'' he said, before being boarding a Polish LOT
Airlines flight for London and Toronto.
   The bond arrangements were made during a session Tuesday night
with prosecutors. Tyminski transferred the $100,000 to a bank
account. On Tuesday night, Tyminski told reporters he promised to
return by Jan. 5 to cooperate in the slander inquiry.
   He said he wanted to see his children in Canada and work on his
defense.
   The slander investigation was started by the provincial Nowy
Sacz prosecutor after Tyminski accused Mazowiecki of treason during
a Nov. 17 campaign rally. Tyminski said the prime minister, who was
eliminated from the election in the first round of balloting on
Nov. 25, had betrayed the nation by creating economic chaos.
   Meanwhile, outgoing President Wojciech Jaruzelski delivered his
own farewell in a nationally televised speech Tuesday night.
   Jaruzelski apologized for ``each harm, pain and injustice''
caused during his nine years in power - apparently referring to his
1981 decision to impose martial law in an effort to crush
Solidarity and the repressions and years of stalemate that
followed.
   ``The word of `sorry' may sound all too casual,'' Jaruzelski
said. ``But I cannot find another one.''
   Jaruzelski, as Communist Party chief, was Poland's leader from
October 1981 until July 1989, when he was elected president - an
office whose powers he used only passively. His term will end when
Walesa is sworn in.
   Solidarity's national commission decided its vice chairmen, Lech
Klaczynski and Stefan Jurczak, will run the union until an
emergency national congress to be held as soon as mid-January.
   The congress will formally accept Walesa's resignation, elect a
new chairman and likely decide whether to form a political wing of
Solidarity or stick to union work, representing workers in
negotiations with the government, as some members advocate.

<HEAD>Newspaper Says Honecker Deathly Ill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former East German leader Erich Honecker lies
``deathly ill'' in an intensive care unit at a Soviet military
hospital near Berlin, a newspaper reported today.
   The Bild newspaper said Honecker, 78, was suffering from a
serious heart disorder and that his kidneys were failing.
   Honecker is wanted by Berlin justice authorities on charges of
manslaughter as a result of shoot-to-kill orders he allegedly
issued at the Berlin Wall. Honecker has denied all charges against
him. More than 200 East Germans died trying to escape to the West.
   German police cannot serve a warrant that was issued Nov. 30
because they have been unable to get permission to enter the Soviet
military hospital in Beelitz, 20 miles south of Berlin, where
Honecker sought refuge in April.
   The Soviets claim they are keeping Honecker on ``humanitarian
grounds.''
   Bild said the Soviets had two possibilities to resolve the
problem.
   The first would be to allow Honecker and his wife, Margot, to
travel to the Soviet Union for medical treatment.
   The second would be to turn Honecker over to the Germans.
   The Berlin Wall divided Berlin from 1961 until late 1989, and
was part of the fortifications that prevented East Germans from
going to the West.
   Germany was unified in October, ending the division imposed
after its defeat in World War II.

<HEAD>Heart-Lung Test Done 2 Million Times A Year, Despite Poor Doctor
Training</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Doctors performing a heart-lung test that can
cause fatal complications should receive specialized training and
certification, say researchers who found many doctors have a poor
grasp of the procedure.
   A written exam about the procedure was given to 496 physicians
at 13 U.S. and Canadian hospitals. It found that 47 percent were
unable to derive ``even the most basic information'' from the data
generated by the test, researchers reported in Wednesday's Journal
of the American Medical Association.
   The study did not record any attempt to give the exam to doctors
known to have used the heart-lung test. Rather, researchers gave
the exam at random to doctors in hospital departments that use the
tests the most.
   The test, called pulmonary artery catheterization or PAC, is
performed an estimated 2 million times a year and can provide
life-saving information if used by a doctor with adequate training.
But it can cause fatal complications or lead to treatment errors if
used without adequate knowledge, the researchers said.
   No training standards exist for doctors learning to use the test
and no special credentials are required, they said.
   Dr. Roger C. Bone, chairman of internal medicine at Rush Medical
College in Chicago, said Tuesday a moratorium on the use of the
test ``would be going off the deep end.''
   Bone said in a telephone interview Tuesday that the rate of
serious complications overall is probably 2 percent to 3 percent.
And the rate of life-threatening complications less than 1 percent.
   ``The PAC is very important, very helpful,'' he said. ``It can
give us information that may allow interventions that will be
life-saving.''
   He agreed with the researchers that doctors should have to earn
credentials to use the test. Bone serves on the American Board of
Internal Medicine and the Critical Care Board, which set standards
to certify doctors qualified for those specialties.
   Bone said the ABIM and the Joint Commission on Accreditation of
Healthcare Organizations, which sets quality standards for
hospitals, are evaluating the findings.
   The PAC, introduced in 1970, involves inserting a tube carrying
a monitoring device into a neck or leg vein and threading it
through the heart into a lung artery. There, it can measure blood
flow, temperature and oxygen.
   ``It's been an amazing advance to monitor the effects of
medication, help in the diagnosis of different cardiac conditions
... (and) in patients with lung diseases,'' said Dr. Thomas J.
Iberti, director of critical care at Mount Sinai Hospital in New
ork and lead author of the study.
   ``It also allows you to follow the effects of therapy,'' he said
in a telephone interview Tuesday. ``You can now, rather than asking
patients if they feel better, get data.''
   But the tube, which is sometimes left in place for two to three
days, can cause serious or fatal complications such as rupturing
the lung artery, disrupting the heartbeat or allowing infection to
enter the body, he said.
   Iberti and his colleagues developed a 31-question,
multiple-choice test about PAC and gave it to doctors in the
departments of medicine, surgery and anesthesiology at hospitals
recruited for the study.
   The doctors' average score was 20.7 questions correct, or 67
percent, with a low of six correct and a high of 31, the
researchers said.

   Here, at a glance, are the latest developments in the Persian
Gulf crisis:
   ---&equals;
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has dismissed his defense
minister, one month after sacking the armed forces chief of staff,
state radio said Wednesday. Baghdad Radio said the new defense
minister is Maj. Gen. Saadi Toma Abbas, inspector-general of the
armed forces and a former deputy chief of staff. The outgoing
minister, Gen. Abdel-Jaber Khalil Shansal, 70, was named minister
of state for military affairs - a position of little authority.
   ---&equals;
   Al-Thawra, the newpaper of Iraq's ruling Baath Party, said civil
defense authorities have instructed all owners of buildings with
two or more floors to conver their basements into bomb shelters.
It ordered the owners to post signs informing people where to take
cover in case of attack.
   ---&equals;
   Algerian President Chadli Bendjedid arrived in Baghdad on
Wednesday on a mission aimed at bringing Saudi Arabia and Iraq
together to negotiate a settlement to the Persian Gulf crisis. An
Arab diplomat in Jordan said on Tuesday that Saudi officials had
assured Bendjedid they would meet with Saddam if he begins
withdrawing his troops from Kuwait. The Saudis have previously
refused to talk until after a total pullout.
   ---&equals;
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze said the Soviet
Union has no plans for military involvement in the gulf. The
minister, who is in the United States, sent a message to the Soviet
parliament after a group of deputies accused him of preparing to
send Soviet troops to the gulf without legislative approval.
Shevardnadze did not rule out the possibility that the executive
branch may one day have to act without parliament's consent.
   ---&equals;
   OPEC's president cautioned that current high levels of crude
production could leave the world ``awash in oil'' and markets in
turmoil once the gulf crisis ends. Sadek Boussena made the
statement in opening a conference of the 13-member Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries in Vienna.
   ---&equals;
   More Americans freed by Iraq were to head home Wednesday after
arriving Tuesday night in London and Frankfurt, Germany. A final
evacuation flight from Iraq is expected on Thursday. The five
diplomats working at U.S. Embassy in Kuwait will be brought home
soon, but it has not been decided whether they all will come out on
the evacuation flight planned for Thursday, officials said.
   ---&equals;
   Iraqi newspapers on Wednesday dismissed reports that Iraq is
ready to withdraw from Kuwait. The newspapers said Iraq will never
compromise on the emirate it has designated its 19th province.
   ---&equals;
   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said more than 500
Americans, most of them children, remain in Kuwait and Iraq - some
voluntarily because they have relatives there and some because the
non-American head of household could not get permission to leave.
Boucher said except for three Americans with visa problems, he
believes that all Americans wanting to leave have done so.
   ---&equals;
   Two U.S. Marines have died in separate incidents, one of an
apparent heart attack while exercising with a group and the other
from a suspected brain aneurysm, military officials said Wednesday.
The fatalities, which occurred Monday, raised the number of the
U.S. deaths in Operation Desert Shield to 56, including 49 in air
crashes and other accidents, the U.S. Central Command said.

<TEXT>
   Afghans are tired of fighting and
will welcome the superpowers' decision to stop weapons shipments, a
Moslem guerrilla spokesman said today.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze on Tuesday announced
the U.S.-Soviet agreement to cut off weapons to the Soviet-backed
Kabul government and the Moslem guerrillas, who are backed by the
United States, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.
   The announcement came after a meeting in Houston with Secretary
of State James A. Baker III. In 1989, the Soviets pulled the last
of their troops from Afghanistan, where the 12-year-old civil war
has claimed 1.5 million lives.
   ``Most of the mujahedeen (guerrillas) and most Afghans will
welcome it. They're tired of war,'' said Azim Nasser-Zia, spokesman
for the National Islamic Front of Afghanistan. His group is one of
the seven major Afghan resistance parties based in Pakistan.
   ``It's true everyone in Afghanistan carries a gun. While a gun
may give a degree of safety, it also generates fear,'' he said.
   Both Afghan President Najibullah and Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, leader
of the most radical guerrilla faction, have called for reciprocal
weapons cutbacks.
   Najibullah said last month he would accept a lack of symmetry in
each sides arms, ``including the Soviet arms assistance program to
be cut off, and we would destroy all weapons stockpiles in
Afghanistan and turn it into a totally demilitarized and neutral
country.''
   Diplomats in Islamabad and Pakistani officials called the
announced weapons cutoff a significant development in the costly
political and military stalemate. Most anticipated a joint
statement by Baker and Shevardnadze and had prepared their
responses.
   ``Afghanistan is one of the few irritants remaining in
U.S.-Soviet relations,'' said one diplomat, who insisted on
anonymity. ``It's a detriment and an annoyance. President Bush and
others in the U.S. administration seem convinced it's not worth the
aggravation and just want it off the agenda, so it's difficult to
understand what the holdup is.''
   Shevardnadze said no date has been set for the weapons cutoff.
   Most of the guerrilla groups say they have not received weapons
from the United States since mid-summer. According to reports from
the Afghan capital, the number of Soviet transport planes
delivering arms, ammunition and other supplies has dropped from an
average of 40 per day to about 10 a day.
   But both sides possess huge stockpiles of weapons and
ammunition, and most diplomats and observers believe the fighting
will likely continue for some time between troops loyal to
Najibullah and the guerrillas.
   Within months after Moscow withdrew its 115,000 Red Army troops
from Afghanistan in February 1989, the superpowers began searching
for a solution.
   But their Afghan clients have proved recalcitrant. Moreover, a
superpower deal will be no guarantee of peace in the landlocked,
tribal society, which has traditionally resisted interference by
outsiders.
   The guerrilla leaders so far have refused to negotiate directly
with Najibullah, instead offering their own ideas for ending the
war and holding elections for a new government.
   The United States has provided as much as $300 million a year to
the Moslem guerrillas. Washington has estimated Soviet assistance
at $500 million a month, although most observers say the exact
amount is difficult to calculate because most of the weapons were
pulled out of Eastern Europe and are outdated.
   One of the major obstacles has been agreeing on an acceptable
formula for reducing weapons supplies equally. There have been
questions about when a cutoff would start, who it would involve and
how it would be verified.
   It was unclear whether the announcement regarding a cutoff of
weapons would apply to Saudi Arabia, which reportedly has matched
U.S. assistance to the guerrillas on a dollar-for-dollar basis. In
September, Saudi Arabia re-established diplomatic relations with
Moscow.
   Moscow's involvement in Afghan affairs is at least in part
driven by Soviet fears the Afghan insurgency could spill across the
border into its predominantly Moslem Central Asian republics.

   Todor Zhivkov, Bulgaria's Communist ruler
for 35 years, has been indicted for misappropriating funds -
including money to pay personal nurses, flight attendants and
others.
   Zhivkov, 79, was placed under house arrest after being ousted in
late 1989. He was hospitalized in February for unspecified ailments
related to his age.
   The state news agency BTA, which reported Zhivkov's indictment
on Tuesday, said his closest associate, Milko Balev, also was
indicted on the charges. It was not known if the two men would be
tried together.
   The indictment was presented to the Supreme Court by the
prosecutor general's office on Friday, the agency said.
   Zhivkov recently told journalists he expects to be cleared of
any charges.
   According to prosecutors, Zhivkov embezzled about $3.7 million
between 1962 and 1989 for his own and other people's use.
   Large sums of money were paid to ``nurses, rehabilitation
therapists, air hostesses and other persons who attended to Zhivkov
in person,'' BTA quoted the prosecutor's office as saying.
   Zhivkov also is accused of illegally receiving fees for his
numerous books published in Bulgaria and abroad, BTA said, adding
it had been ``an open secret'' that the publications that came out
under his name were actually written by special teams of scientists
and assistants.
   On Nov. 20, BTA quoted Prosecutor General Martin Gunev as saying
Zhivkov would also be tried for abuse of power.
   BTA said prosecutors were also investigating to determine if
anyone will face charges for the crisis in agriculture, the
construction of ill-conceived industrial projects, the ``disruption
of the ecological balance'' and ``the catastrophic growth of the
foreign debt.''
   Bulgaria's foreign debt stands at about $11 billion, and
Bulgaria halted payments eight months ago because of serious
domestic economic problems.

   Japan and Germany, two of the world's leading
economic powers, have delivered barely one-fifth of the money and
materials they promised in support of U.S. military operations in
the Persian Gulf, the Pentagon says.
   Of the six countries that offered the largest contributions to
Operation Desert Shield at its outset in August, only Kuwait has
given all that it promised, Pete Williams, the chief Pentagon
spokesman, said Tuesday.
   Williams declined to comment on the reasons for the delayed
contributions from other allies. Pledges totaling more than $6.5
billion were made for calendar year 1990.
   Japanese officials denied today that Japan is dragging its feet
in disbursing 2 billion U.S. dollars pledged to support the
multinational forces deployed against Iraq.
   A Japanese Foreign Ministry official said that of a total of $4
billion pledged for the military effort and to support front-line
states, some $600 million has been contracted or disbursed.
   The process for disbursing another $600 million dollars in
emergency commodity loans for Jordan and Turkey will be completed
very soon, said another. The remainder is under discussion at
various levels, they said.
   In Bonn, a spokesman for Chancellor Helmut Kohl today disputed
the Pentagon's figures. Hans Klein said his government already has
made available more than $1.36 billion for the gulf operation,
including $1.09 billion in military equipment and transportation.
   Williams had said the Germans have delivered $337 million in
cash and materials, toward a pledge of $1.5 billion, and Japan,
which said it would give about $2 billion for the gulf operation,
has provided $426 million.
   Neither Japan nor Germany has sent armed forces to the gulf,
citing constitutional restrictions.
   Williams said the United States plans to ask an undisclosed
number of allied nations to increase their financial contributions
for 1991. He said he did not know how much money would be sought or
when the requests would be made.
   ``We will probably seek additional support from other nations to
continue their share of the responsibility for Desert hield,''
Williams said.
   The United Arab Emirates, a federation of gulf sheikdoms
bordering Saudi Arabia, pledged $1 billion and has given $280
million, Williams said. South Korea offered $95 million and so far
has delivered $4 million.
   Williams said Saudi Arabia, which is the host nation for the
vast majority of U.S. and allied forces arrayed against Iraq, was
the only ally to make an ``open-ended offer'' of support. He said
that as of Oct. 31, it had provided material support such as fuel,
food, water and transportation valued at $987 million.
   Kuwait's exiled royal family has delivered $2.5 billion,
Williams said. That is part of a pot of private and foreign
government contributions totaling $3.9 billion - an amount certain
to fall short of covering U.S. costs in the gulf.
   Williams said the Pentagon would ask the Congress in February
for supplemental funds to cover Desert Shield expenses in 1991. He
said the amount was uncertain because the Pentagon did not know how
much the gulf operation will cost and because it's unclear how much
more the allies may be willing to contribute.
   Government and congressional sources said Monday that Desert
Shield may cost $30 billion in 1991. The Pentagon's original cost
estimate was $15 billion, but that was before President Bush
ordered huge reinforcements to the gulf on Nov. 8.
   Williams said American air, sea and ground forces in the gulf
area have risen by 10,000 since last week, to 260,000. The latest
arrivals apparently are the lead elements of Army and Air Force
reinforcements from Europe and the United States.
   The Pentagon said Tuesday that elements of Seventh Corps
headquarters, U.S. Army Europe, began deploying to the Middle East
from their base in Stuttgart, Germany. Also, the U.S. 2nd Corps
Support Command began deploying from Nellingen, Germany.
   By late January, about 430,000 U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force and
Marine Corps personnel are expected to be in the area.
   Williams said forces dispatched to the gulf area from Britain,
France and 24 other allied nations now total more than 220,000. He
said he could not disclose how many forces were sent by each
country.
   The spokesman also announced that Iraq now has more than a
half-million troops in and around Kuwait - 50,000 more than U.S.
intelligence estimates of a week ago and five times the size of the
army that invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.

   Japan's worst tornado in decades ripped through a
Japanese town just east of Tokyo, injuring 78 people and leaving
hundreds homeless, police said today.
   More than 5,000 households remained without electricity and 800
without working telephones today, police said. They said 250 people
whose homes were destroyed by Tuesday night's tornado were now
housed in a gymnasium.
   Electricity to 87,700 households was cut off after the tornado
passed through Mobara and nearby areas in Chiba prefecture, Tokyo's
eastern neighbor.
   The twister destroyed or damaged 938 homes or buildings and 162
cars as it passed through the community of about 77,000 people.
   No one was killed, but seven people were seriously injured,
police said. City officials estimated damage at $13 million.
   Weather bureau officials said small tornadoes occur several
times each year in Japan but that Tuesday's twister caused the
worst damage in decades.
   During the storm, lightning was reported in many areas. Near the
tornado area, at least one greenhouse covered with vinyl was torn
apart by hail.
   Television broadcasts showed residents going through their
wrecked homes today. Other people sat in severely damaged buildings
eating by candlelight.
   One resident told a television crew the tornado lifted his
parked car about three feet off the ground and hurled it several
yards.

   A 13-year-old Palestinian girl was shot to
death today when soldiers and Jewish settlers fired at Arab
students throwing stones at Israeli cars in the West Bank, Arab
reports said.
   The army confirmed the death, and said it was investigating the
circumstances.
   The shooting came two days after Defense Minister Moshe Arens
launched a new offensive against stone-throwing, posting
sharpshooters at key intersections in the West Bank and pressing
for stiffer sentences for convicted offenders.
   Today, Palestinians in the West Bank town of Jericho stoned
Arens' motorcade, an Israeli photographer said. A large stone
smashed the windshield of an army escort vehicle, but Arens' car
was not hit, the photographer said.
   In Arab east Jerusalem, police fired tear gas and rubber bullets
in several locations to disperse stone-throwers. Police arrested
six Palestinians and closed two schools.
   The fatal clash occurred along the highway that links the
occupied West Bank with the Tel Aviv area and is frequently used by
Jewish settlers.
   About 200 students from the Arab village of Biddiya threw stones
at Israeli cars during a demonstration marking the anniversary of
the founding of a radical PLO faction, an Arab reporter said.
   Settlers and soldiers fired at the protesters, and one bullet
struck Ahlam Abed in the head, the report said. Her body was taken
to Ittihad Hospital in the West Bank town of Nablus.
   Her death brought to 778 the number of Palestinians killed by
Israelis since the start of the uprising three years ago. At least
316 other Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs, most on
suspicion of helping Israel. Fifty-four Israelis also have died in
the violence.
   A 16-year-old Palestinian from the West Bank town of Tulkarem
was reported in serious but stable condition Wednesday after he was
shot in the head by a rubber bullet during clashes with the army
Tuesday.
   In east Jerusalem, dozens of Palestinians threw stones and glue
containers at police in the main shopping street. Police responded
with tear gas and rubber bullets and arrested five.
   In the nearby Wadi Joz neighborhood, two Israelis were hurt when
their car overturned after the driver lost control of the vehicle
when it was stoned, police said.
   Police also reported stone-throwing clashes at schools in the
Arab neighborhoods of Atur and Jabel Mukaber. Police closed two
schools and arrested one Palestinian.
   In the Gaza Strip refugee camp of Rafah, troops sealed the homes
of three Palestinians suspected of involvement in killing two
suspected informers and firing at an army patrol, the army said.
   Palestinian reports said the sealings made 50 people homeless.
   The army has sealed and demolished more than 600 houses since
the start of the uprising. Western nations have condemned the
practice, saying it constituted collective punishment.

of Education Lauro F. Cavazos and President Bush's reply, both
dated Dec. 12:
   Dear Mr. President:
   I, Lauro F. Cavazos, hereby resign as United States Secretary of
Education, effective close of business, Dec. 15, 1990.
   I appreciate the opportunity to work with the administration in
helping to further its goals toward excellence in education. I am
especially proud of the contributions I was able to make in
expanding choice in education, promoting the executive order on
excellence in education for Hispanic Americans, and raising
awareness of the growing diversity of America's student population.
   I have only the greatest expectations and highest hopes that
each child in America will be educated to his or her fullest

   ---
   Dear Larry:
   With deep regret I accept your letter of resignation. For more
than two years, and under two presidents, you have distinguished
yourself through your devotion to improving the education of our
nation's children.
   With your help and guidance we assembled the 50 state governors
in Charlottesville for a historic education summit. There, we
established a consensus for a set of national education goals,
which today are the driving force behind our education agenda. Your
tireless promotion and pursuit of these goals has set us on a path
to educational excellence through the end of the decade.
   I was particularly proud, Larry, to stand with you last
September to announce an executive order on educational excellence
for Hispanic Americans based on the findings of the task force you
led. Hispanic Americans in every community are indebted to you for
the inspired leadership you have provided.
   Barbara and I will always be grateful for the sincerity,
diligence and care you brought to the office of the secretary. On
behalf of students, parents and teachers across the nation, let me
thank you for your dedicated service.
   Sincerely,
   George Bush

   The publisher of the New York Daily News says the
tabloid will keep ``plowing ahead'' as long as it is gaining ground
against an employee strike, a move a union spokesman called ``sheer
masochism.''
   Publisher James F. Hoge made the announcement Tuesday after a
board meeting of the News' parent, the Tribune Co. Some Wall Street
analysts had speculated the board would close the paper and cut its
losses.
   ``Our rule is that we are plowing ahead as long was we can show
that we are making significant progress,'' Hoge said.
   Theodore Kheel, the striking unions' legal adviser, countered,
``The decision is a form of sheer masochism.''
   ``The News has no hope of survival whatsoever in the absence of
a settlement or sale,'' he said. ``The sooner the board realizes
that, the better everyone, including the Tribune Co., will be.''
   The News, using managers, replacements and employees transferred
from other Tribune Co. newspapers, has continued to publish despite
the 7-week-old strike by 2,100 employees in nine unions.
   Negotiators for both sides arrived in Washington today at the
Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, which is trying to end
the six-week-old strike.
   Members of the negotiation teams began arriving at the service's
headquarters shortly after 9 a.m., but declined to comment on the
talks. They met with Bernard E. DeLury, director of the service,
and other mediators.
   Hoge said the News is regaining strength daily and increased net
paid circulation by 28,000 to 580,000 since the end of last week
through a network of dealers and hawkers now totaling almost half
the pre-strike number of 12,000 outlets.
   The paper had daily circulation of 1.09 million copies before
the strike began on Oct. 25.
   ``It is the opinion of everyone involved in this process that we
are making significant progress and we are going forward,'' Hoge
said.
   The publisher said the strike is costly ``but not as expensive
as trying to run the paper with all the excess costs and contract
abuses that we had ... in the old contract.''
   Hoge said the paper is losing money but could be profitable if
the company reaches reasonable settlements with the unions. He said
he is confident many advertisers who left for rival tabloids will
return as circulation increases.
   About 100 people, most from various Chicago unions, picketed the
Tribune Tower on Tuesday, led by several of the striking Daily News
workers. Tribune Co. also publishes the Chicago Tribune.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III
hopes to meet with foreign ministers of the other permanent
Security Council members in Europe this month to reassure Iraq it
won't be attacked if it withdraws from Kuwait by Jan. 15, diplomats
said today.
   But the foreign ministers will also tell Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein that they will not accept a partial withdrawal, thus
forestalling any idea that he could hang on to two islands that
control access to the Shatt-al-Arab waterway or part of an oil
field straddling the Iraq-Kuwait border.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, who is in
Washington for talks with Baker and President Bush, urged ``a
sensible way'' out of the Persian Gulf crisis in negotiations with
Iraq.
   ``There is still potential for a peaceful solution,'' he said at
a joint news conference with Baker on Tuesday.
   ``It is very important that a goodwill grace period that expires
on Jan. 15 is taken up by a very active diplomatic and political
effort,'' he said. ``It is also my strong hope that U.S. troops
will not see action.''
   The foreign ministers agreed in principle to meet in Europe
after Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz meets Bush in Washington
this month, but before Baker travels to Baghdad for talks with
Saddam, diplomats said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
   The message is intended to emphasize international solidarity
behind Baker when he travels to Iraq, they said.
   Baker has been waiting for word from Baghdad on a date to see
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. The United States rejected the
Iraqi suggestion of a Jan. 12 date because it is too close to the
Jan. 15 deadline.
   Shevardnadze said, ``We pin much hope on the coming contacts.''
   The meeting would involve the United States, Britain, France,
the Soviet Union and possibly China.
   China's willingness to participate is questionable, though,
since Beijing is opposed to the use of military force to drive Iraq
from Kuwait.
   China abstained on the Security Council resolution passed on
Nov. 29, which authorizes U.N. members to use ``all necessary
means,'' up to and including military force, to liberate Kuwait if
Iraq doesn't pull out by Jan. 15.
   Diplomats have speculated that Iraq might be willing to withdraw
from Kuwait if it was able to retain the southern end of the
Rumailah oil field, which extends from Iraq into Kuwait.
   An unresolved dispute over whether Kuwait was tapping oil that
belonged to Iraq was one reason for Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of the
emirate.
   Iraq also wants a deep-water port, which it was unable to win
during the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war.
   Baghdad had asked Kuwait for a 99-year lease on two uninhabited
islands at the mouth of the Shatt-al-Arab waterway from Kuwait,
which would give it control over access to the passage forming the
border between Iran and Iraq.
   Kuwait declined to lease the islands to Iraq the day before the
invasion.
   The meeting of the foreign ministers would emphasize that Iraq
must withdraw from the islands of Warba and Bubiyan, and from the
Rumailah oil field. Baker has insisted on that point, but has also
said recently that when the emir of Kuwait's government is restored
to power, Iraq and Kuwait could then negotiate the economic and
territorial disputes between them.

   Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers in the
United States and abroad.

   Dec. 11
   Albuquerque (N.M.) Journal on the Persian Gulf:
   What do you know: another un-concession from the United States
in response to the Iraqi announcement that all foreign hostages
could go home. Washington announced that the last U.S. diplomats
would leave the beleaguered embassy in Kuwait after all American
citizens had been allowed to leave.
   Administration spokesmen denied it was a conciliatory move,
saying it was decided based on the hostage departures ending the
embassy's immediate duties in conquered Kuwait, and out of concern
for the situation of the diplomats themselves.
   Perhaps what we are witnessing here is the world's first
instance of back-channel diplomacy by press release. In any event,
it cannot help but reduce the tension of the Gulf standoff if the
remaining U.S. diplomatic personnel in Kuwait were to finish their
job and head home. It certainly has the look, if not the fact, of a
deliberate U.S. decision to eliminate one potential flash point.
   The George Bush of long experience in diplomacy and government
may indeed be handling this crisis with a more subtle touch than
the bombastic rhetoric his pronouncements portray.
   Whatever else the Kuwait embassy gambit signals, it signals that
it is time for Congress and its individual members to lay off the
second-guessing of Bush and let him play his cards with his
military force ace at full strength.

   The Richmond (Va.) News Leader on the Persian Gulf:
   There is in the West a softhearted temptation to declare peace
at hand with Saddam Hussein's release of hundreds of foreign
hostages from Iraq and Kuwait. People who display such sentiment
fall into the trap of treating despots as if they are compassionate
individuals. Saddam Hussein, like those numerous bloodthirsty
communist leaders who enjoyed American jazz and good Scotch, is
unreasonable and uncaring.
   While supposedly making a grand overture for peace by, as
Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney put it, ``stopping a practice that
obviously is abhorrent to the civilized world,'' Saddam has
proceeded to bolster troop deployments and fortifications in
occupied Kuwait. Furthermore, the Iraqi government has refused to
offer Secretary of State James Baker a face-to-face meeting with
Saddam in time for Iraqi troops to withdraw from Kuwait before Jan.
15 following such a meeting.
   On its face, the hostage release might appear to be a
humanitarian gesture, but Saddam does not see it that way, not even
publicly. In announcing the impending hostage release ... , Saddam
said their presence had been necessary to deter military attacks by
the West, but now that Iraqi troops have achieved full force in
occupied Kuwait, it is no longer necessary to hold hostages.
   ---
   Dec. 9
   The Palm Beach (Fla.) Post on the Persian Gulf:
   In taking hostages, Saddam Hussein gained nothing but an extra
measure of scorn. In releasing hostages, Hussein should be allowed
to gain nothing at all.
   Hussein's quest for gain won't end with humanitarian posturing.
Because his invasion of Kuwait and release of hostages came before
any new United Nations action on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,
Hussein undoubtedly will claim credit there. He is capable of
unilaterally declaring that his actions have reinforced U.N.
concern for the Palestinians. And even if U.N. action has no
practical effect, Hussein can - after saving face by declaring
himself vindicated and a hero of the Palestinians - withdraw from
Kuwait.
   Hussein doesn't care about the Palestinians. Neither do most of
the other Arab leaders, except insofar as the Palestinians are a
weapon against Israel.

   Dec. 6
   Philadelphia Daily News on the Persian Gulf:
   Let's all say it together real loud.
   George Bush is not a wimp. Nor is he a weenie. He is the
biggest, baddest critter in the whole forest.
   Maybe he'll hear and we can skip getting carloads of people
killed. This public relations effort to convince us that we should
sacrifice American young people may be one of the most cynical
exercises since Lyndon Johnson told us all how heavy his heart was.
   Moments after the polls say we won't back a war in the Persian
Gulf except to stop nuclear proliferation, the Bush administration
changes its reasoning. ``It's to stop Saddam Hussein from getting
the bomb. Yeah, that's the ticket.'' ...
   Worst of all, though, we continue trying to back ourselves into
a corner. Just as it appears that 400,000 troops and a blockade may
have created a climate for cutting a deal, Secretary of State James
Baker tells us that all he's going to do is lecture and threaten
Saddam.
   None of the rationales for war makes sense, at least not yet.

   Los Angeles Daily News on the space shuttle program:
   It has not been a stellar year for space astronomy. First there
was the monstrously expensive disappointment of the Hubble Space
Telescope, that $1.5 billion eye-in-the-sky that can't quite get
things in focus. Now the $150 million Astro observatory, ...
plagued by computer trouble. ... More than 100 planned
observations, out of about 250, had to be scrubbed.
   Yet, not all is gloomy out there. Hubble, in spite of its
optical flaws, is enabling astronomers to do some serious science
and is returning some spectacular images from the Solar System and
the realm of distant galaxies. The Magellan probe is currently
assembling a remarkable detailed map of the planet Venus. And the
Astro observatory, glitches and all, helped astronauts make a
significant and poignant bit of history. ...
   Columbia's astronauts beamed a lesson from space, just as New
Hampshire schoolteacher Christa McAuliffe had wanted to do nearly
five years ago when she won a place on the disastrous Challenger
mission. ...
   Teaching is probably the most useful thing (along with its usual
national security work, launching spy satellites and such) that
NASA can do for the country right now.
   So it is good finally to see someone teaching from orbit,
answering questions from kids on the ground. (The) lesson from the
shuttle Columbia was a modest comeback for a project that has been
stalled far too long - the project of bringing space down to earth.

   Florence (S.C.) Morning News on our resources:
   Ten years ago an ecologist and an economist took the unusual
step of submitting their opposite theories to a reality test: They
made a bet. The result was written up in (the) influential New York
Times Magazine.
   The more famous lost.
   He is Paul Erlich, Stanford University's butterfly expert and
the mass media's favorite ecologist. His 1968 best-seller The
Population Bomb is among the environmental movement's founding
texts.
   In 1980, Erlich took up the gauntlet thrown down by University
of Maryland economist Julian Simon: To demonstrate the point that,
far from becoming scarcer as population grows, natural resources
actually become more available thanks to human innovation, Simon
offered a challenge to predictors of overpopulation. Pick any
natural resource, Simon said, and he would bet that its price would
decline by any stipulated date.
   Erlich and two colleagues bet $1,000 on five metals - chrome,
copper, nickel, tin and tungsten. The 10 years Erlich stipulated
ended in October. World population grew by 800 million in the
decade - but all five metals declined in real price. Together they
declined by almost 40 percent.
   This adds one more thing to the long list of Erlich's
predictions that have proven false, notably mass starvation in the
1970s and near-depletion of ``many key minerals'' before 1985. .. .
Yet Erlich retains his standing with the mass media as an authority
on the planet's future. ...
   Biologists think in terms of closed ecosystems. But market
economies are flexible and responsive. Instead of disparaging the
economists, ecologists should incorporate the obvious truth that
resources are not static but rather depend on man's power to adapt
and invent.

   The Atlanta Constitution on banking laws:
   Merely a decade late, Washington now appears ready to begin the
huge task of reforming the financial system. With proposals being
drafted by the Treasury Department, the Bush administration is
preparing to revamp banking laws from top to bottom - and Congress
may be ready to join the effort.
   Clearly the system is in great need of reform. The fundamental
laws that regulate commercial banks were developed during the Great
Depression of the 1930s. As the nation gears up for the 21st
Century, new laws are needed to keep up with changing technology,
new competitive pressures and growing international commerce.
   Still, it's not surprising that both the White House and
Congress have been reluctant to meddle with a system that grew out
of the hard lessons learned in the 1920s and early 1930s. Older
Americans still have nightmarish memories of bank runs and lost
savings. Tampering with the deposit-insurance system is not
something to be done lightly.
   But the need for reform is now overwhelming. While a complete
overhaul may sound radical, the real danger lies in taking halfway
steps that leave the system with one foot in the 1930s and the
other in 2000.

   The Daily Oklahoman, Oklahoma City, on trade talks:
   Collapse of the world trade talks in Brussels is bad news for
American producers, especially our farmers. ...
   Chief cause for the breakdown was the European Community's
refusal to cut internal farm price supports. Japan also balked on
opening its closed rice market.
   A successful GATT agreement could increase U.S. exports to
developing countries alone by $200 billion over the next 10 years -
a large portion of which would be agricultural goods. The United
States needs more export sales to help the economy and lower the
trade deficit.
   Negotiators might get the talks back on track in January. If
not, fallout may include increasing trade frictions, rising
protectionism and possibly even a global trade war. Instead of a
new era of free trade and prosperity, the world could split into
regional trading blocs, each with its own barriers.
   This at a time when world leaders should be striving for more,
not less cooperation.
   ---
   Dec. 10
   Houston Chronicle on trade talks:
   For General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade - GATT - substitute
world trade. More to the point, make it: eliminating barriers to
increased world trade. ...
   To further simplify it: GATT is about jobs. ...
   The process of setting new international rules on matters
ranging from banking to patent protection stumbled last week in
Brussels on the issue of agricultural protection. U.S. negotiators,
backed by most of the world's other large agricultural exporters,
wanted to cut internal farm supports by 75 percent; the Europeans
would agree to only a 30 percent cut.
   In effect, the interests of a few heavily subsidized European
farmers now threaten the trade structure that has brought
increasing global prosperity since just after World War II. There's
nothing arcane about that threat; it's plainly and simply wrong. .
..
   The GATT ministers will meet in Geneva after the first of the
year to try to break the deadlock. The subsidies of inefficient
European farmers must be cut in the interest of freer global trade.

   Dec. 10
   The Greenwood (Miss.) Commonwealth on Lech Walesa:
   Americans remember Lech Walesa as the courageous Gdansk shipyard
electrician who led his fellow workers in strikes against Poland's
then communist government.
   Walesa went to jail for his efforts. That was before Eastern
Europe's revolutionary political changes of the past year or so.
   Now Walesa, a 47-year-old electrician with a vocational school
education, is the new elected president of Poland. ...
   Before communism began to crumble, Walesa had built the
Solidarity movement into a broad-based anti-communist social
consensus which united Polish intellectuals, workers and the
Catholic Church. Once Solidarity took over the government, however,
its ranks began to splinter.
   After four decades of communism, Prime Minister Mazowiecki
engineered economic ``shock treatment'' to Poland. It seems to be
working. But Mazowiecki's defeat reminds us that it is easier to
criticize from outside the government than it is to lead from
within, especially when times are hard.
   Walesa no doubt is going to face the same trouble, for it will
not be easy to create a modern market economy in Poland or for that
matter in the rest of Eastern Europe. A hard road lies ahead. It is
easier to rally people against something or someone than it is to
rally people in support of a difficult plan of action, no matter
how necessary that plan may be.

   The Chattanooga (Tenn.) Times on China:
   Only 18 months since China massacred pro-democracy demonstrators
in Tiananmen Square, President Bush was meeting at the White House
with China's foreign minister. And U.S. Ambassador to China John
Lilley was recently in Seattle, chastising demonstrators against
China's gross violations of human rights.
   What is going on? ...
   Never mind that China has shown no remorse for its massacre of
innocents but has continued to persecute those involved in the
pro-democracy movement. ... Bush counted on the shift of public
interest to the Middle East as a cover for reopening the door of
the White House to Beijing. But not everyone was looking the other
way. ...
   Confronted by demonstrators against China's human-rights abuses,
... Lilley got into a shouting match, calling them ``cowards'' and
ridiculously suggesting that if they hadn't been at Tiananmen
Square they had no right to protest. He even shouted at a Tibetan
man that he should ``go back to China and serve China.''...
   The ambassador has since admitted he made a mistake, but
defended himself by saying he was provoked by name-calling from
some of the demonstrators. That is no excuse. Any diplomat so
easily pushed to the point of losing control should be in another
line of work.
   In light of the administration's weak-kneed response to China's
brutal repression of internal dissent, ... Lilley should have been
prepared to take his lumps from demonstrators rightly protesting
Beijing's human-rights abuses. An apology is clearly called for,
but was conspicuously absent from the ambassador's statement
admitting error. And the White House has been silent, derelict in
its duty at least to reprimand ... Lilley for his unseemly and
unwarranted outburst. But that, we suppose, should come as no
surprise.

   Le Monde, Paris, on the Persian Gulf:
   Saddam Hussein has finally accomplished one of the gestures that
the international community ordered of him four months ago. His
decision to free all the hostages without delay or conditions - and
no longer, as he previously announced, between Dec. 25 and March 25
- was swallowed Dec. 7 by the parliament in Baghdad.
   If this initiative, which puts an end to a long scandal,
shouldn't reward him with any gratitude, it nonetheless marks a
political retreat. For the first time since the annexation of
Kuwait, the Iraqi dictator has satisfied one of the principal
demands of the United Nations.
   In the eyes of the United States and its allies, the fate of the
hostages - and in particular the fear of taking the lives of these
``human shields'' dispersed on the strategic sites of the ``host''
country - never played the deterrent role that Baghdad expected.
   Hostages or not, nothing has stopped a logic of war from
unfolding in the Gulf. And the Western military detachment,
reinforced at the end of the month, is from now on credible. In
these conditions, Saddam Hussein has judged it more useful to grant
freedom to his hostages.

   La Repubblica, Rome, on the Persian Gulf:
   For the first time since Aug. 2, the day of the Iraqi invasion
of Kuwait, it is right to say that the caravan of peace has started
to move in the Arabian desert.
   If Saddam Hussein seriously intends to liberate the thousands of
Americans, Western Europeans and Russians who until now have been
used as ``human shields,'' and if this is not the strategy of a
crafty merchant trying to gain time and divide his adversaries,
then the bloodbath in the Persian Gulf is not the one and only
inevitable conclusion to the crisis.

   Dec. 9
   The Observer, London, on trade talks:
   Removing barriers to trade in manufactured goods has led to an
immense growth in world commerce in the post-war years.
   Trade has kept growing even at times of economic difficulty. Yet
now European and American leaders seem incapable of pursuing a
broad common interest, even though they know its long-term benefit
to both their own countries and the world community to be beyond
doubt. ...
   The (Persian) Gulf crisis has revealed the reluctance of most of
America's European allies for vigorous cooperation now that the
Cold War is over. ...
   If rich Europe relapses into selfish regionalism, it will find
itself paying a price. Its prosperity and stability are bound to
lure the less fortunate.
   There is already alarm over the flow of illegal immigrants from
North Africa. The collapse of communist border controls in East
Europe has made it easier for Asians to slip unnoticed into the
West. ...
   It is time for Western leaders to show they recognize the
responsibilities beyond their own parish.

   Sunday Nation, Nairobi, Kenya, on Angola's reform proposals:
   For the United States in particular, it is a chance to make
amends for the deaths, injuries and economic losses occasioned on
Angola through U.S. support to (rebel) Unita.
   It will also be a major prop for President Jose dos Santos who,
at this difficult time, needs all the support he can get from every
quarter.
   With goodwill and support from all, the Angolan case could be
Africa's success story this year, second only to the release in
February of South Africa's foremost nationalist, Nelson Mandela.

<HEAD>Bush Reassures Shamir of Support; Shevardnadze Meeting Today</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: Top 5 grafs new to update with Bush decision on Soviet trade
concessions, Shamir meeting with Senate committee.</NOTE>

<TEXT>
   Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir told
members of Congress today he firmly supports President Bush's
decision to ease trade with the Soviet Union as a reward for its
liberalized policies.
   Israel and its supporters in Congress had spearheaded opposition
to trade concessions for the Soviets but are now trying to help the
strapped Soviet economy since the relaxation of restrictions on
Jewish emigration.
   Shamir spoke to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in a
closed session, but Israeli officials relayed the gist of his
remarks.
   Shamir was meeting later in the day with Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard Shevardnadze. The hastily scheduled meeting, requested by
the Soviets and arranged by the State Department, reflects the
fast-improving relationship between the two countries.
   Before meeting Shamir, Shevardnadze is calling on President
Bush, who has been weighing how to ease immediate Soviet food
shortages and to help the economy in the longer term. Bush has
decided to temporarily waive the 1974 Jackson-Vanik amendment which
limits trade with the Soviets unless they allow free emigration.
   ``We think it (the amendment) could be dispensed with for a year
or more because of the very liberalized policies related to the
emigration of Soviet Jews,'' Shamir told reporters at a conference
of the American Enterprise Institute.
   Gorbachev has been allowing Jews out at a rate of 1,000 to 2,000
a day - a far cry from the virtually closed gates of the Soviet
Union through most of the 1970s and 1980s.
   The subject of the flood of immigrants is expected to come up
with Shevardnadze, Shamir said, as well as Israel's request for
direct flights from the Soviet Union and its desire for resumption
of full diplomatic ties which the Soviets broke in 1967.
   The crisis in the Persian Gulf and prospects for Israeli-Arab
peace talks are also expected to come up, said other officials.
   The session with Shamir will give Shevardnadze an opportunity to
try to persuade him that an international peace conference could
help settle the Arab-Israeli dispute.
   But Shamir said ``Israel will not participate in such a
conference and Israel will not accept imposed solutions.''
   Instead, Israel wants direct talks with its Arab neighbors as
outlined in a four-point peace plan Shamir proposed last year and
the United States endorsed.
   ``Peace plans are neither fashions nor automobiles. We must not
introduce a new model every year,'' Shamir said.
   Israel also has not changed its mind about excluding the
Palestine Liberation Organization from peace talks, and it hopes
the PLO's support for Iraq has convinced the world of its
unsuitability as a peace partner, Shamir said.
   Sounding a conciliatory tone, the prime minister said Israel
wants to cooperate with its Arab neighbors on an arms control plan
that would rid the volatile Middle East of its vast arsenals of
arms.
   Israel also wants to cooperate on a plan to ease the reigon's
increasingly severe water shortages, he said.
   He pledged again that Israel would refrain from a pre-emptive
strike against Iraq unless attacked.
   Shamir's meeting with Bush Tuesday went a long way toward
calming his fears about the steadfastness of U.S. support for
Israel, despite recent strains over the new U.S. alliances with
Arab states aligned against Iraq.
   The meeting ``will enhance the special relationshi between the
United States and Israel,'' Shamir told reporters at the White
House.
   Shamir said his meeting with Bush convinced him the
administration doesn't favor an international conference.
   The administration has been fighting a proposed resolution at
the U.N. Security Council calling for such a conference, mainly to
avoid linking the Israeli-Palestinian dispute with the U.S.-led
drive to force Iraq to leave Kuwait.
   Bush also sought to smooth the strains in his relations with
Shamir.
   He voiced U.S. concerns about treatment of Palestinians living
under Israeli occupation, said Assistant Secretary of State John
Kelly, but he did not bring up the slaying of 17 Palestinians by
Israeli police during an October riot at a Jerusalem holy site.
   Shamir asked Bush for help, possibly in the form of loan
guarantees, in absorbing Soviet Jews who are coming to Israel. The
president said he would think about it.

<HEAD>ACLU Seeks Removal of Creche, Menorah From Public Property</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two California communities are
being challenged by the American Civil Liberties Union to remove
religious symbols that mark the holiday season from public
property.
   In Beverly Hills, the American Jewish Congress and four Jewish
residents, backed by the ACLU, filed a lawsuit in federal court
seeking the removal of a 28-foot Hannukah menorah displayed at a
municipal park.
   In Monterey, the ACLU has demanded that the city remove a
Nativity scene from the City Hall lawn by Thursday, or face a
lawsuit.
   The civil liberties union contends the displays amount to a
government endorsement of religion, but the communities say they
are celebrating the diversity of religious beliefs in the nation by
offering space for holiday displays from a variety of groups.
   Chabad, a movement of Hasidic Jews, installed the large
candelabra in Beverly Hills on Monday for public celebration of the
eight-day Jewish holiday.
   The suit filed by the American Jewish Congress contends the
menorah on public property violates the First Amendment's guarantee
of separation of church and state.
   Carol Plotkin of the Jewish Congress argued that religious
freedom is best preserved by banning all religious objects on
public lands.
   ``There are plenty of opportunities to put up creches or
menorahs or any other religious object on private property.
Government should be free of any religious objects,'' she said.
   City Attorney Greg Stepanicich defended the city's approval of
the Chabad menorah.
   ``We have a lighted Christmas tree, a lighted `Seasons
Greetings' sign, and now we've allowed the menorah as part of that
overall holiday message,'' Stepanicich said.
   He said that state and federal courts have allowed religious
holiday displays if they also show ``cultural diversity and
pluralism.''
   Hanukkah, or the Jewish Feast of Lights, began Tuesday evening.
It commemorates the rededication of the Temple in Jerusalem by the
Maccabees after they ousted foreign occupiers 2,100 years ago.
   It is celebrated by lighting one candle on the menorah for each
of the eight days.
   In Monterey, the city for years has made space on the City Hall
lawn available to the Monterey Civic Club to set up the Nativity
scene. On Tuesday, the city posted a large sign on the lawn saying
the space on the lawn was available for noncommercial holiday
displays.
   The sign also says the city ``does not endorse or support any of
the points of view expressed by the displays or their sponsors; the
message is the sole expression of the person or group erecting the
display.''
   But Michelle Welsh, a lawyer representing the ACLU, said the
sign doesn't make any difference.
   ``It's abundantly clear that the law requires the city to remove
the creche from city property,'' she said.

   Volunteers coaxed eight beached
whales back to sea and took two to an aquarium, but 43 others
grounded near the Kennedy family compound were given up for dead or
put to death overnight to end their misery.
   The whales that returned to the sea appeared to be all right
this morning despite fears on Tuesday that they would be
disoriented, and in danger of beaching themselves again,
authorities said.
   But the whales left behind were less fortunate.
   Rescuers on Cape Cod had struggled most of the day Tuesday to
save the pilot whales, splashing them with water and soothing them
with wet towels as the giant mammals - most of them mothers and
calves - lay listlessly, making squeaking and whistling noises and
occasionally twitching.
   ``I'm offering a little comfort,'' said one volunteer, Karen
Kelly. ``They respond to your touch and your voice. They are scared
and they don't know what's going on.
   ``Say a prayer,'' she added.
   When the weakened whales began foundering in seaside pools
filled by the rising tide and could no longer keep their blow holes
above water and avoid drowning, more than a dozen were put to death
with lethal chemicals.
   The volunteers were sent home around midnight, expecting all the
whales to be dead by morning.
   Experts were unable to explain why the whales beached
themselves. The animals were 6 to 15 feet long and many weighed
more than a ton.
   About 100 volunteers had endured high wind and freezing
temperatures in the effort to save the animals. Working with the
help of floodlights and headlights, they used stretchers to return
some of them to open water.
   One rescued whale later washed ashore and was destroyed. Eight
others were tracked by boat for more than a mile.
   Radio transmitters were placed on two of the rescued whales and
their fins were fitted with glow-in-the-dark tags, but their
ultimate fate remained unknown. Whales pushed back into the water
often beach themselves again.
   ``It's like a person being in a real bad car accident, and then
telling them to go drive again,'' said Colleen Crogan, a National
Marine Fisheries Service official who operated a spotlight during
the rescue.
   Two whales were taken to the New England Aquarium in Boston,
where scientists hope to nurse them back to health. Both were
juvenile females, and both were reported in guarded condition early
today.
   Early today, the New England Aquarium revised its official count
of the number of stranded whales downward by two to 53. Most were
euthanized, but 13 died of natural causes and eight were returned
to the sea.
   Despite the mass deaths, volunteers with the Cape Cod Stranding
Network said the possible rescues outweighed the losses. ``It was
really a fantastic experience,'' said Roger Cadrin. ``You could
tell they knew we were there to help.''
   The whales beached themselves in shallow pools on Squaw Island
at low tide Tuesday. The island is near the Kennedy family
compound, where Rose Kennedy lives.
   In eight whale strandings on Cape Cod and Nantucket Island in
the past decade, 368 whales have beached themselves, including
Tuesday's group. The largest such grounding came when 97 whales
swam ashore near Eastham in October 1984.
   Only three of the 315 previously grounded whales survived, and
they spent seven months at the aquarium. They had beached
themselves in 1986.
   On Tuesday, some people worried that the rescued whales weren't
much better off than they were before they became stranded.
   ``I think these whales at this very moment are confused and
don't know where they are,'' said Charles Mayo, director of the
Center for Coastal Studies in Provincetown, who was in the tracking
boat.
   Reuben Baker of Brewster, a veteran of other strandings, said,
``These whales could pick you up and throw you through the air, but
you can tell they knew we were trying to help them.''
   Theories about what causes whales to beach themselves include
sickness, navigational disorders or drastic changes in tidal and
ocean current patterns.
   ``There are as many theories as there are whales on the beach
today,'' said Jenny Montague, supervisor of marine mammal training
at the Boston aquarium.

<HEAD>Study: Life Span Normal After Repair of Common Heart Defect</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Young people who undergo surgery to repair one of
the most common birth defects of the heart can look forward to
normal life spans, a 30-year follow up shows.
   The study, which looked at people who had been operated on for a
problem called atrial septal defect, showed that those who were
under age 25 went on to live just as long as those with healthy
hearts.
   Older people did not do as well. But surgery still makes sense
for these people because the outlook for survival is still far
better than for those who didn't undergo the operation.
   The study, published in Thursday's New England Journal of
Medicine, was based on the experiences of the first 123 patients
who had the operation at the Mayo Clinic between 1956 and 1960.
   Atrial septal defect is the technical name for a kind of hole in
an interior wall of the heart. In this abnormality, blood
improperly flows from the heart's left upper pumping chamber into
the right. The defect is often discovered in late childhood, and
symptoms can include trouble breathing, fatigue and chest
palpitations.
   The study found that 97 percent of those who were under age 11
at the time of the operation and 93 percent of those between ages
12 and 24 were still alive 30 to 34 years later. This was not
significantly different from a comparison group with healthy
hearts.
   ``From the perspective of employment and insurability, such
patients should be strongly reassured,'' wrote Dr. Joseph G. Murphy
and colleagues.
   However, among those between ages 25 and 41, survival was 84
percent, while 91 percent in this age category in the comparison
group were still alive. Survival among those over age 41 was worse
still: 40 percent among the heart patients and 59 percent in the
comparison group.
   ``The long-term results of repair at older ages are unfavorable
as compared with those of correction at earlier ages,'' they wrote,
but this does not mean that older patients shouldn't have the
surgery.
   Other studies have shown that the outlook is grim for those who
do not get the defect fixed. By age 50, three-quarters are dead,
and by age 60, 90 percent are dead.
   Atrial septal defects account for between 7 percent and 10
percent of all genetic malformations of the heart.

   Two handwritten letters between Albert Einstein
and Sigmund Freud discussing the nature of war sold for $165,000,
and a Louis Armstrong trumpet drew $16,500 at the same auction.
   The exchange of letters was initiated by a League of Nations
official for a limited-edition book published in 1933.
   The letters, which were sold Tuesday by Sotheby's, were
consigned by an educational institution and purchased by a private
American buyer, said Matthew Weigman, a Sotheby's spokesman.
   Einstein's four-page letter of July 28, 1932, asks, ``Is there a
way to liberate man from the doom of war?'' The 14-page reply from
Freud concludes, ``There is no prospect of getting rid of this
aggressive instinct.''
   The signed letters were expected to bring from $150,000 to
$250,000.
   Another private American buyer bought the trumpet and a
manuscript essay on the musician's recollections on the development
of jazz.
   The B-flat trumpet sold for $16,500 and the handwritten essay
for $27,500, Weigman said. They were consigned by Armstrong's
niece.

<TEXT>
   John Gotti, reputed head of the nation's most
powerful crime family, was named today in a federal racketeering
indictment accusing him of ordering the 1985 murder of his
predecessor.
   The 50-year-old Gotti - dubbed the ``Teflon Don'' for his
success at avoiding criminal conviction - was arrested by FBI
agents and police without incident Tuesday at the Ravenite Social
Club, his hangout in New York's Little Italy.
   Gotti, also called the ``Dapper Don'' for his fancy tailor-made
suits, was being held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center
pending arraignment. Three alleged top associates also were
arrested, the FBI said.
   The indictment against them was sealed and not released until
today.
   It charges Gotti under the federal Racketeer Influenced and
Corrupt Organizations Law, or RICO, with running the Gambino crime
family since 1986.
   The 11-count indictment includes charges of illegal gambling,
extortion, loan sharking, obstruction of justice and robbery. The
three co-defendants were accused of racketeering and other charges.
   Gotti was the only defendant accused in the December 1985 Paul
Castellano hit, in which bodyguard Thomas Bilotti also was gunned
down in front of a Manhattan steakhouse. Gotti allegedly ordered
the hit to assume control of the family, authorities said.
   ``No problem,'' a smiling Gotti told reporters after his arrest.
   Bruce Cutler, Gotti's lawyer, said his client is innocent.
Prosecutors are forcing Gotti to ``live life on the installment
plan, locking him up every 10 to 12 months,'' Cutler said today.
   ``This is our fourth frame in five years,'' Cutler said,
accusing prosecutors of conducting a vendetta against his client.
``It's the same kind of crap that we dealt with in 1986 and 1987.
The same kind of Mafia madness, nonsense, that starts with a
two-week blitz in the newspapers.
   ``I know it's a vendetta. It's happened three times. If that's
not a vendetta, I don't know what is.''
   In recent years, prosecutors have failed three times to convict
Gotti.
   Evidence against Gotti and his co-defendants came from
eavesdropping devices planted at the Ravenite club with court
authorization, according to law enforcement sources.
   The arrest capped a five-year FBI investigation into
Castellano's killing.
   The indictment also implicates Gotti in three other murders and
for conspiring on a fourth hit against a New Jersey mobster.
   Law enforcement officials say the Gambino family's sources of
income include drug dealing, gambling, extortion, loan sharking,
union control, airport rip-offs and domination of New York City's
garment district.
   Also arrested Tuesday were Salvatore ``The Bull'' Gravano, Frank
``Locks'' Locasio and Thomas Gambino, described by authorities as
associates of Gotti.
   FBI officials said Gravano and Locasio were taken into custody
at the Ravenite club and Gambino was arrested at an undisclosed
location.
   Authorities say Gambino, son of the late ``boss of all bosses''
Carlo Gambino, is one of the richest crime figures in New York
City.
   Gotti has been arrested three times before on major state or
federal charges but has been acquitted each time. His last
acquittal was in February, when he was found innocent of state
charges related to the shooting of a union official.
   Jules Bonavolonta, head of the FBI's organized crime office in
New York, recently described Gotti as ``the No. 1 target of law
enforcement.''
   ``It's just a matter of time. He's going to go,'' Bonavolonta
said.

   Nine scientists missing for four days in the

snow from an avalanche, authorities said.
   The bodies were recovered at dawn in a remote valley after a

   The victims were part of a group of 12 speleologiss, or
scientists who study caves, caught in a snowstorm Sunday after
exploring caves in the Alps.
   Three were rescued by helicopter Monday. They reported seeing
two of their companions swept away by an avalanche, but authorities
had held out hope the others might still be alive.
   At least 10 other people have died in incidents related to the
heavy snow and rain that has swept Italy in recent days.

   An 11-year-old boy suffering from a rare brain
tumor opened an exhibit on Wednesday of some of the 33 million
cards he received to clinch the world record for most get-well
cards.
   Craig Shergold, who was diagnosed with brain cancer two years
ago, smiled broadly for photographers at the Guinness World of
Records exhibition in central London.
   ``I want to wish happy Christmas to everyone who sent me a
card,'' Craig said.
   Of all the cards sent to his south London home, his favorite
came from singer Michael Jackson, Craig said.
   Craig is listed in the 1991 Guinness Book of Records as having
received 16,250,692 cards as of May 1990. Since then the figure has
doubled, said Craig's mother, Marion Shergold.
   Norris McWhirter, founder of the Guinness Book of Records, said
33 million cards would make 10 stacks each as high as the world's
tallest mountain. Mount Everest is listed at 29,028 feet above sea
level.
   Mrs. Shergold asked that no more cards be sent to Craig, who is
expected to travel to the United States next month for a rare
operation.

   Mailboxes are filled with sometimes
tear-jerking requests for money during this season, and some care
is needed in deciding on charitable gifts.
   Battling disease and protecting the environment, feeding
children overseas and the homeless in America are among the many
causes turning to the mail, airwaves and other media to make their
pitches.
   The National Council of Better Business Bureaus, while normally
thought of in connection with protecting consumers, also tries to
ride herd on the thousands of charities across the nation.
   The council periodically publishes a list showing those
charities that generate the most inquiries to the group. It shows
which do and do not meet 22 voluntary standards set by the Better
Business Bureaus.
   The council's general guidelines for folks considering giving to
charities at any time of the year include:
   -If unfamiliar with the organization, ask for written
information about its programs and finances.
   -Don't succumb to pressure to give money on the spot. A charity
that can use the money today will welcome it just as much tomorrow.
   -Watch out for appeals that bring tears to the eyes but tell
little or nothing about how the donation will be used. Appeals for
money should clearly identify program activities.
   -Don't give cash. Make a check or money order out to the
charity, not to an individual.
   -If candy, calendars or other goods are being sold to benefit
charity, ask how much of the money actually goes to the charity.
   -Ask if the donation is deductible for federal income tax
purposes and keep a record for use at tax time.
   -Check out charities with the local Better Business Bureau or
state charity registration office, usually a part of the state
attorney general's office.
   Copies of the pamphlet ``Give: But Give Wisely'' may be obtained
for $2 and a stamped, self-addressed envelope, from the
Philanthropic Advisory Service, Council of Better Business Bureaus,

   Forget the Super Bowl or the Final Four.
Scalpers are finding that business is booming for ``The
Nutcracker'' ballet and the Tulsa Philharmonic Pops concerts.
   ``Scalping cultural events shows we've got class,'' said Patrick
Boulen of the city's prosecutor's office. Ticket scalping is legal
in Tulsa.
   Tulsa Ballet Theater's annual production of ``The Nutcracker''
traditionally sells out. A ninth performance has been added this
year. The Pops series tickets are usually sold in advance.
   One scalper is asking twice the box office prices for Nutcracker
tickets, which range from $6 to $18. Brisk business also was
reported in the parking garage at the Performing Arts Center for
Pops tickets, which cost from $15 to $28.
   ``This is the first time I've done the orchestra or ballet,'' a
scalper, who identified himself only as Mark, told the Tulsa World.
``My banker told me it would be a good idea.''
   The Nutcracker performances for Saturday and Sunday have been
sold out. Mark is asking $30 for close seats and $25 for seats from
the 13th row and back.
   At those prices, the scalper is getting scalped on his profit
margin, said Tulsa Ballet Theater worker Carolyn Duncan.
   ``Close to the stage is not considered as good as right in the
middle,'' Ms. Duncan said. ``I guess he doesn't know about watching
ballet.''

   The main defendant in the murder trial of
ecologist and union activist Chico Mendes stunned a courtroom today
by confessing to the crime during the first day of the proceeding.
   During questioning by Judge Adair Longhini, Darci Alves Pereira,
23, admitted shooting Mendes in an ambush in 1988. The young cattle
rancher had denied any role in the killing during routine opening
motions this morning.
   As bailiffs led Pereira from the courtoom in this remote Amazon
jungle town, Longhini stopped them and questioned the defendant
again.
   Pereira paused, then looked up and said, ``I confess.''
   ``What?'' said the judge. ``Did you kill him?''
   ``Yes,'' Pereira said.
   There was a buzz in the tiny courtroom, and Longhini called for
order.
   Ilzamar Mendes, the widow of Chico Mendes, clapped her hands and
asked, ``He confessed? It's hard to believe.''
   She added, ``He's probably doing it to protect his father.''
   Pereira's father, 53-year-old cattle rancher Darly Alves da
Silva, is the other defendant in the trial.
   He is charged with planning the shooting and has pleaded
innocent.
   The confession was a startling development in a trial that has
drawn international attention and is seen as a test of Brazil's
commitment to protecting its rain forests and to equal justice for
rich and poor.
   Thousands of Brazilians, politicians and international observers
had traveled to this western village, drawn by one of the biggest
legal spectacles in Brazil's history: the trial of two ranchers
accused of killing Mendes.
   At stake, many say, is the future of the world's largest rain
forest. The struggle in which Mendes was killed pits the
traditional way of life in the Amazon against ranchers and others
who want to open up large tracts of lands.
   Mendes, a 44-year-old rubber tapper who led a movement to stop
destruction of the rain forest, was gunned down Dec. 22, 1988, in
the backyard of his modest wooden home in Xapuri, 2,650 miles
northwest of Rio de Janeiro.
   ``This is a historic trial not only for Brazil, but the world,''
Marcio Thomaz Bastos, the chief lawyer for the prosecution, said
earlier today.
   ``In Brazil, it is a test case against reckless lawlessness, and
for the world, a marker of whether or not man will allow the Amazon
to be destroyed.''
   Private and government development efforts in the Amazon region
have intensified since 1980; the World Resources Institute says as
much as 20 million acres of forest were destroyed in Brazil in 1987
alone. The Amazon rain forest is the sole habitat for thousands of
plant and animal species.
   Peasants from around the region have come to Xapuri in canoes,
mule- and steer-drawn carts, on horseback, by bus or simply on
foot. Tents were popping up in the main square. Hammocks hung on
front porches and matresses were laid wherever there's a free spot
in people's homes.
   ``I want to see what Chico did - justice, and men living at
peace with the forest,'' said Luis Vieira de Souza, a 63-year-old
rubber tapper, who arrived at Xapuri after an eight-hour canoe
journey on the Acre River.
   ``Our lives will fall when the trees do,'' said Souza.
   About 2,000 people make a living tapping rubber and collecting
wild nuts, resins and other forest produce.
   Locals are scampering to accomodate the crush of visitors.
Telephone booths are sprouting on street corners. Street curbs,
park benches and tree trunks are getting fresh coats of white and
green paint.
   Telephone trucks, television vans and food delivery trucks come
head-to-head with horse and steer-pulled carts. Town workers are
removing weeds from in front of the one-room, wooden courthouse.
   To get to the village, Rubber tapper Raimundo da Silva Maia, 51,
walked 30 miles over 12 days through thick forest with more than 30
pounds of rice, beans and manioc slung in packs on his back.
   ``If Darly and Darci are found not guilty, only God will be able
to saave my family and the rain forest,'' said the father of 13.
   Hundreds of politicians, including some government officials and
many representatives of leftist Workers Party of which Mendes was a
member, began to arrive late Tuesday aboard chartered planes and
buses from Rio Branco, 110 miles away.
   More than 100 state troopers were flown in to prevent violence
between ranchers, residents and rubber tappers. Roadblocks of
heavily armed police were set up along the muddy, rutted road that
connects Xapuri to Rio Branco.

   An Amtrak train from Washinton derailed and
slammed into a packed commuter train in Boston's Back Bay station
during this morning's rush hour, injuring 186 passengers, 10 of
them critically, officials said.
   The impact ``threw the trains in the air,'' and spilled 1,500
gallons of diesel fuel which caught fire in the downtown
underground station, said acting city Fire Commissioner John
Harrison.
   The commuter train from Stoughton, south of Boston, was hit by
Amtrak's Night Owl from Washington at 8:33 a.m., said Nancy
Sterling Gleason, a spokeswoman for the Massachusetts Bay Transit
Authority.
   Injured passengers, many of whom were trapped for a half-hour
underground, were taken to seven area hospitals.
   Jon Fasana, director of emergency services for the city, said
186 people were injured, including 10 critically. No deaths were
reported.
   A woman at the scene said one train looked like a ``twisted tin
can.''
   ``The doors all flew open. Some windows shattered. People were
all over the floor, screaming, crying,'' she said.
   Rescuers used hydraulic tools to get into the cars.
   Amtrak spokesman Clifford Black in Washington said the Night
Owl, which left Washington 10:30 p.m. Tuesday, apparently
``derailed on a curve and went into the side of the MBTA train on
an adjacent track.''
   Two passenger cars, two engines and two baggage cars on the
Night Owl went off the track and pushed two commuter cars onto the
next track, said Brent Bahler, a spokesman for the National
Transportation Safety Board.
   Black said it was unclear what caused the train to derail.
Federal inspectors were due in Boston later today.
   Harrison said the trains collided with such force that the
street overhead buckled.
   A shopkeeper inside the station said the shelves in the store
trembled and ceiling tiles fell.
   ``My first reaction was to cover my cup of coffee,'' said Jeanne
Marie Hardin, ``and then somebody poked their head in the store and
said, `Call an ambulance.'''
   The station filled with smoke. Eyewitnesses said many
passengers, dazed and covered with soot, wandered out of the
station, some crying, many assisted by emergency personnel.
   One elderly woman, her face black with soot and wearing no
shoes, asked police: ``Where's my luggage? Where are my shoes?''
   About 50 people were taken to Massachusetts General Hospital but
their injuries did not appear serious, said spokesman Martin
Bander.
   A spokeswoman at Boston City Hospital had received 15 victims
with a variety of injuries, including cuts, broken bones and smoke
inhalation. One person was reported in critical condition with a
head injury.
   ``We were sitting on the train and the next thing - crash, bang,
boom,'' commuter train passenger Kathy Simons said as she was
carried away on a stretcher to an ambulance. ``I ended up on the
floor with a seat on top of me.''
   ``It was so bad, I said `I've got to get out of here in a
hurry,''' said a man who was on the Amtrak train. ``I got out and
just started heading for the light at the end of the tunnel.''
   Joe Povoas, a passenger on the commuter train, said: ``We were
sitting waiting in the station and the train just went lurch. The
lights immediately went out and the car filled up with smoke, real
gritty smoke, smoke you could grind with your teeth, you could spit
it out.''
   Back Bay Station, located near the landmark Hancock Building, is
jointly owned by the region's transit authority and Amtrak. It
draws commuter lines from Needham, Franklin, Framingham, Attleboro
and Stoughton lines as well as Amtrak trains and the Orange subway
line.
   Today's collision occurred 37 months after a nearly identical
crash between a commuter train and another Amtrak tain.
   Ted Lopatkiewicz, a spokesman for the National Transportation
Safety Board in Washington, said his agency was assembling an
investigative team, which should arrive in Boston by this
afternoon.

   Deposed President Hussain Muhammad
Ershad was placed under house arrest Wednesday while the caretaker
government prepared corruption charges against him.
   Ershad was moved under heavy guard to a house in the Gulshan
district formerly occupied by the British ambassador and once used
by Queen Elizabeth II.
   Home Secretary Azimuddin Ahmed said Ershad and his wife,
Raushan, were ordered held for 120 days under the Special Powers
Act, which permits detention without charge.
   Acting President Shahabuddin Ahmed said last week he intended to
repeal the widely resented law, which Ershad frequently invoked
during his eight-year rule.
   Police, who earlier arrested Ershad's home minister, were
searching for 12 other Cabinet ministers and senior officials of
his government. Ershad's government collapsed last week after seven
weeks of street protests.
   A convoy of police and army vehicles escorted a grim-looking
Ershad to the two-story house. Guards were earlier cautioned not to
salute or stand at attention when the 60-year-old former army
general arrived.
   Officers later said Ershad complained he had not been given any
food since Tuesday night. They quoted him as asking his military
guards, ``Is this any reward for 38 years of army service?''
   Ershad was confined with his wife and 8-year-old son Shahd. He
was later visited by at least one member of his wife's family. No
telephone was installed for his use.
   Thousands of political activists, meanwhile, paraded through
main streets of Dhaka, the capital of 7 million people, in what
amounted to the kickoff of the campaign for elections to
parliament. The elections must be held within 90 days.
   News of Ershad's arrest had not spread through the city, and the
marchers chanted slogans supporting their various parties.
Demonstrators did not approach the Gulshan house. Earlier, however,
students marched toward the presidential office chanting ``Hang
Ershad.''
   A leading constitutional lawyer said Ershad would be tried,
probably by a special tribunal, on charges of misappropriation of
funds under anti-corruption laws.
   The tribunal, and others created for other defendents, would be
headed by sitting supreme court justices and likely would be
assisted by commissions of inquiry empowered to quickly assemble
evidence, said Syed Ishtiaq Ahmed.
   ``The existing court machinery is inadequate to deal with the
enormity of the crimes and the high place of the people,'' said
Ishtiaq, who has been asked to join the interim Cabinet.
   Ershad's political opponents accused him or his wife of taking
kickbacks on government deals amounting to millions of dollars.
They have offered no specific evidence.
   Nearly half of Bangladesh's budget is covered by donations
totaling $1.6 billion annually from international agencies and
other nations. The U.S. contribution was projected to be $155
million this year. Diplomats say the aid money is closely monitored
to avoid corruption.
   Army troops pitched tents in the backyard of Ershad's luxurious
prison, and the house was surrounded by 150 policemen and soldiers.
Floodlights lit up the house when night fell.
   Workmen completed preparations on the building just before
Ershad arrived, installing air conditioners, carpets and some
furniture.
   Ershad previously remained secluded in his presidential
residence in Dhaka's Cantonment, a heavily guarded military
complex. United News of Bangladesh said he was only allowed to
bring a blanket, two pillows and a color television set from his
home.
   Acting Foreign Minister Fakhruddin Ahmedi said the ministry was
reviewing several Ershad appointments which he said were
``irregular.'' Mohiuddin Ahmed, the alternate representative to the
United Nations who is Ershad's brother-in-law, has been recalled.

   Lauro F. Cavazos, the first Hispanic American
ever appointed to the Cabinet, resigned today as secretary of
education.
   He is the second member of President Bush's Cabinet to depart in
recent weeks.
   There was no immediate reason given for Cavazos' decision to
resign, and the resignation letter did not say what Cavazos plans
to do.
   Adminstration sources said that Cavazos had tired of criticism
aimed at his performance behind the scenes by White House Chief of
Staff John H. Sununu. His critics had faulted the education chief
as an inadequate salesman for the administration's policies, who
never mastered television skills.
   Cavazos, 63, has led the Department of Education since 1988. He
was appointed by former President Reagan and held over in the job
by Bush.
   The resignation was announced at a meeting of Bush's Cabinet
today.
   Cavazos did not attend the Cabinet meeting. He is out of town, a
White House aide said.
   Bush, in a letter accepting Cavazos' resignation, said: ``For
more than two years, and under two presidents, you have
distinguished yourself through your devotion to improving the
education of our nation's children.''
   Bush mentioned the Cavazos resignation in passing today during a
speech on education today before a group called Jobs for America's
Gradutes. Calling Cavazos ``my dear friend,'' Bush cited his
contributions to setting national education goals and said, ``I
think the country will always be very, very grateful to him for his
service to country.''
   The Department of Education said Ted Sanders, now the deputy
secretary of education and former Illinois schools chief, would
serve as acting secretary upon Cavazos' departure.
   Cavazos, in his own letter, said he was stepping down effective
Dec. 15.
   ``I am especially proud of the contributions I was able to make
in expanding choice in education, promoting the executive order on
excellence in education for Hispanic Americans, and raising
awareness of the growing diversity of America's student
population,'' said Cavazos, former president of Texas Tech
University.
   ``I have only the greatest expectations and highest hopes that
each child in America will be educated to his or her fullest
potential,'' said Cavazos.
   He is the son of a ranch foreman and zoologist by training.
   Cavazos' departure had long been rumored. He was one of the
lowest profile members of Bush's Cabinet and was considered by many
in the education community to be ineffective.
   William Bennett, Bush's drug policy director, also resigned last
month, but subsequently agreed to become the next chairman of the
Republican National Committee. Bennett, Cavazos' predecessor at the
Department of Education, did not hold Cabinet rank.
   Cavazos was a far less controversial secretary of education than
Bennett, who warred with teacher unions and was an acerbic critic
of America's universities.
   Cavazos made peace with the National Education Association and
other leading groups in the so-called education establishment.
   Cavazos had campaigned for efforts to give parents more choice
over what public school their child attends.
   Bush praised Cavazos for his ``help and guidance'' in arranging
last year's education summit with the nation's governors at
Charlottesville, Va., which produced a set of education goals for
elevating standards in America's schools.
   Those goals ``are the driving force behind our education
agenda,'' said Bush. ``Your tireless promotion and pursuit of these
goals has set us on a path to educational excellence through the
end of the decade.''
   Cavazos was only the fourth person to be secretary of education.
The post was created when education was elevated to Cabinet status
in 1980 during the Carter administration.
   Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole announced her resignation in
October, the first of Bush's Cabinet to resign.
   Cavazos had earned a bachelor's degree in zoology and a master's
degree in cytology at the same school, then known as Texas
Technological College, before getting a doctorate in physiology
from Iowa State University in 1954.
   He first taught as an instructor of anatomy, and later as an
associate professor, at the Medical College of Virginia in
Richmond. Later, he was dean of the school of medicine at Tufts
University in Medford, Mass.
   In 1980, he became the first alumnus and the first Hispanic to
be named president of Texas Tech.
   Cavazos' father was a cattle foreman at the King Ranch in Texas.
Cavazos has two brothers, who also attended Texas Tech and went on
to successful careers. Bobby Cavazos was an All-American running
back in college. Afterward he ran his own ranch. Brother Dick
became a four-star Army general.
   The retiring education secretary and his wife, Peggy Ann, have
10 children. Seven of them have degrees from Texas Tech.

   President Bush joined in a Hanukkah
celebration at the White House today, hailing a young Jewish
emigrant from the Soviet Union and reaffirming ``the American ideal
of freedom of worship.''
   Bush, Vice President Dan Quayle and their wives also tried their
hands at dreidel, the children's game played during the holiday
with a top marked with Hebrew letters.
   Eight rabbis gave Bush a silver menorah - which holds the
candles lit during each day of the holiday - saved from the Warsaw
ghetto, and one rabbi likened Bush to Judah Maccabee, a heroic
Jewish warrior, for standing up to Iraq's Saddam Hussein.
   Hannukah ``emphasizes the courage to fight and overcome evil and
wickedness,'' said Rabbi Chaskel Besser. ``Your actions in the
Persian Gulf (are) in the true Macabeean spirit.''
   Judah Maccabee and a small band of followers triumphed in
ancient times against a stronger enemy.
   Bush called Hanukkah ``a holiday of hope for it shows us the
glory of God in our own lives and the power of miracles in the
world.''
   Bush said 150,000 Jews have emigrated from the Soviet Union this
year alone, including a girl at the ceremony, Lidia Shestopalova.
   ``The ancient story of the first Hanukkah is one of victory over
persecution, aggression and intolerance,'' said Bush. ``But the
struggle has continued for your people through the centuries.''
   He cited a letter that George Washington wrote 200 years ago to
a Jewish congregation in Newport, R.I., pledging that the new
government would sanction no bigotry or persecution.
   Washington's words ``embody the American ideal of freedom of
worship, an ideal that we reaffirm here today,'' said the
president.
   Here is the text of Bush's message released by the White House:
   I am delighted to send greetings to Jews in this country and
around the world as you celebrate the festival of Hanukkah.
   The Jewish religion is rich with tradition, and this special
holiday is one of both teaching and joy. It commemorates the faith
and the perseverance of Judah Maccabee and his followers, who were
able to defeat their oppressors and rededicate the Temple in
Jerusalem. According to tradition, even though the Maccabees could
find enough purified oil in the Temple to keep the sacred menorah
burning for only one night of celebration, the oil lasted for eight
days and eight nights.
   This story of abiding trust in the mercy and justice of the
Almighty continues to be a source of inspiration to Jews around the
world. The miracle of the lights illustrates that the power of the
Lord can overcome what seem to be impossible obstacles and that
working together to achieve common objectives can make the world a
brighter place for all.
   Barbara and the entire Bush family join with me in sending our
best wishes for a memorable Hanukkah.

   Scores of former American hostages are giving
the U.S. government valuable information about conditions inside
Kuwait and Iraq over the past four months, officials say.
   One former hostage says he made a diagram of the strategic site
in Iraq where he was held as a ``human shield.''
   About three-fourths of the hostages have voluntarily submitted
to debriefing sessions with officials from the State Department and
the military.
   ``Hundreds have been interviewed and hundreds more have agreed
to be interviewed,'' Joe Reap, a State Department spokesman, said
Tuesday.
   Another U.S. official said the government is interested in
information on the Americans remaining in the two countries, and
``anything else they might have seen while they were there and they
might want to pass on.''
   Miles Hoffman, 33, of Roswell, Ga., said he spent eight to 10
hours earlier this month with Air Force intelligence officers who
quizzed him about his captivity in Kuwait and Iraq.
   Hoffman, a money manager in Kuwait, was evacuated in
mid-November because he needed a bone graft on his arm, which had
been hit by a bullet. He said he had been one of the ``human
shields'' confined to two strategic sites in Iraq.
   ``I diagrammed the actual site,'' Hoffman said.
   The State Department said the debriefing sessions are voluntary
for the returning hostages who are private citizens. They have no
obligation to submit to interviews with the government.
   On the airplane home, the evacuees were handed a piece of paper
asking if they would like to provide information to the U.S.
government. Special teams are sent to question those who agree.
   Some former hostages, however, said they have had no contact
with the U.S. government.
   Bobby Parker, 49, of Vidor, Texas, said he was a ``human
shield'' at a military installation about 25 miles north of
Baghdad. Parker arrived in Houston on Sunday on a flight arranged
by former Gov. John Connally.
   Parker said the installation was teeming with soldiers, rockets,
helicopters and other military equipment. ``I think it was a repair
facility,'' he said in a telephone interview.
   But Parker, who worked for Kuwait Drilling Co., said no one has
approached him to tell his story. He received a call Sunday from
Rep. Charles Wilson, D-Texas, who helped arrange for Parker's son,
Eric, 25, to return home for a temporary leave from his assignment
in Saudi Arabia with the Army.
   Dawn Bazner of Palm Desert, Calif., said U.S. officials were
keen to talk to her about the ``attitude of the Iraqis'' and other
Americans when she left the country in September.
   But she said her husband, Mark, hasn't talked with anyone since
he returned Sunday.
   About 510 American citizens, most of them children with dual
citizenship, have opted to remain in Kuwait and Iraq, State
Department spokesman Richard Boucher said today.
   The final American chartered flight is scheduled to leave early
Thursday, with about 15 Americans from Iraq on board, including the
last remaining person who was a ``human shield.''
   The State Department has not made a final decision on whether
five diplomats at the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait will be on the flight,
he said. That will be made when officials determine there are no
other Americans who want out in Kuwait.
   After the U.S.-chartered flight end, Americans could presumably
get out of Kuwait on regular Iraqi airways flights that have begun
between Kuwait City and Baghdad, he said.
   Since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, the U.S. government has
evacuated 2,520 American citizens and their family members on 13
chartered flights.
   Americans whose paychecks were halted after the invasion are
eligible to apply for financial aid from the U.S. government.
Congress passed a $10 million aid plan in October.
   The former hostages can draw the equivalent of $24,705 a year,
pro-rated for the length of time they had been held captive.
   In addition, they and their families were granted federal health
benefits and life insurance for the duration of the hostages' stay
plus one year.
   The State Department released the regulations on how to apply
for the money last week.

   Tens of thousands of Albanians chanting
``Democracy, democracy'' hailed the founding today of their
country's first non-Communist party, an eyewitness reported.
   Crowds surged into University Square in Tirana, the Albanian
capital, and cheered wildly as students and others addressed the
throng, announcing formation of the Democratic Party of Albania,
said a Tirana engineer reached by telephone from Vienna.
   Chants of ``Democracy, democracy,'' ``We want Albania to be like
Europe'' and ``We want democratic Albania'' reverberated from the
huge peaceful crowd, the engineer said. He asked not to be
identified by name.
   However, there was also a cheer for President Ramiz Alia for his
decision to allow alternative political parties, the engineer said.
   Alia met Tuesday with students who had boycotted class since
violent clashes with police on Sunday. Hours before, the Communist
Party announced it would permit alternative political movements,
sack five members of the 13-member ruling Politburo and reshuffle
the government.
   The engineer said the new party's guiding committee would meet
in coming days to choose a leader and that it intended to contest
parliamentary elections scheduled in February.
   ``We want to go ahead without blood, absolutely without blood.
All will be solved by speaking and by discussion,'' the man said.
   The moves by Albania's Communist leadership came after daily
student protests. They appeared to signal a major defeat for
Communist hard-liners in Europe's last bastion of Stalinist rule.
   Albania, a nation of 3.1 million that opened its borders
slightly this year after decades of isolationism under the late
Enver Hoxha, would be the last country in Europe to introduce a
multiparty system.
   One student died as a resultof injuries received when
club-wielding police battled the students in the city of Tirana
during the weekend, Yugoslavia's Tanjug news agency said. The
report from the Albanian capital, citing an unidentified informant,
was monitored in Vienna.
   Diplomats could not confirm the casualty report.
   A student rally late Tuesday ended with a decision by student
leaders to ``found our own democratic party,'' the Austria Press
Agency said, citing an unidentified source in Tirana.
   Demonstrations by thousands of students that began on Sunday and
have led to clashes with police have been the most serious since
July, when thousands of people took refuge in foreign embassies
until were allowed to emigrate.
   Elections scheduled for Feb. 10 are seen as a test of the
government's willingness to live up to pledges of gradual reform
and of the people's ability to exercise a measure of political
freedom after decades of authoritarian rule.
   Some observers believed the Politburo reshuffle and the call for
the creation of independent parties amounted to a defeat of the
hard-liners led by Nexhmie Hoxha, 69, widow of Hoxha.
   The Communist Party Central Committee also scheduled a party
congress for June 1991 and a national party meeting on Dec. 26 ``to
define the electoral platform of the party and endorse the list of
its candidates for deputies to the People's Assembly.''
   The Belgrade, Yugoslavia daily newspaper Politika said students'
slogans Tuesday included ``We want freedom'' and ``We demand
democratic changes.'' No violence or arrests were reported Tuesday.
   According to state Radio Tirana, Alia told the students he later
met that top national leaders had followed the protests ``and from
the beginning had expressed themselves in favor of dialogue.''
   Among other demands, students have sought more heat and light
for their dormitories. A severe drought has curbed supplies of
power, which comes mostly from hydroelectric plants.
   Alia has conceded that Albania's economy is ``on the brink of a
state of emergency.''

   Survivors of a roughly 75-car pileup that
left at least 15 people dead saw the road vanish behind a shroud of
fog, then heard nothing but ``bangs and booms'' as one vehicle
after another collided.
   At least 50 people were injured in Tuesday's chain-reaction
crash, Tennessee's worst traffic accident in at least 20 years. At
least six tractor-trailers burst into flames and the fire raced
across more than two miles of Interstate 75, reducing dozens of
vehicles to burned-out shells.
   ``It's just so much destruction in one place, all up and down
the highway,'' said firefighter Brent Runyon. ``It's just three
miles of hell.''
   National Transportation Safety Board investigators arrived late
this morning to open their probe, noting at a news conference today
that a 1978 accident at the same site led to safety recommendations
which the state adopted.
   Emergency workers resumed sifting through the wreckage looking
for victims today. They said it was likely more would be found in
the twisted, charred hunks of metal.
   ``There could be another couple of bodies in there,'' said Cecil
Whaley, director of the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency.
``Several of those tractor-trailer rigs were fused together so
badly it's hard to tell. We're trying to be as delicate as we can
removing them because we just don't know.''
   Three fingerprint specialists from the FBI headed to the
southeastern Tennessee crash site today to help identify victims.
   By this morning, only two of the victims had been identified:
Patsy Robbins, 52, of Athens, Tenn., and Melinda Jones, age
unavailable, of Chattanooga.
   Survivors said the crashes began when motorists hit a stretch of
highway shrouded in fog.
   ``All of a sudden, everybody started stopping right in front of
us,'' said Ralph Fisher of Cleveland, Tenn., who managed to get to
the side of the highway as vehicles all around him collided and
burst into flames. ``After that I started hearing bangs and booms
from everywhere.''
   The stretch of highway 40 miles from Chatanooga has long been
notorious for dangerous fog and has had several chain-reaction
crashes over the years. Runyon recalled that several people were
killed in a similar pileup there in 1979.
   The section is lined with flashing yellow warning lights.
   Authorities said the crashes began on the southbound side of the
highway. The wrecks then spread to the northbound lanes.
   Most of the cars and trucks did not burn, but many were crushed
beyond recognition. Others were strewn along the shoulder and
center divider at bizarre angles, some of them wrapped around each
other likes layers of an onion.
   Many people leaped from their cars after stopping and scrambled
to safety in the median. At least one person was struck by a car as
he stood outside his vehicle.
   ``There was a lot of confusion,'' said Clyde Wilder, a truck
driver from Knoxville. ``There was people scattered out in the
fields on both sides. People were checking cars. They found one boy
over here with broke legs and broke ribs.''
   ``When we got here, it was so foggy you couldn't see your hand
in front of your face,'' said Hal Munck, director of the Bradley
County Office of Emergency Preparedness.
   ``It was terrible. People were just walking around. They didn't
know what happened. They couldn't see.''

   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze
had an unprecedented meeting today with Angola's anti-communist
rebel leader Jonas Savimbi and discussed ways of ending Angola's
15-year civil war.
   ``The foreign minister has assured us of their desire to help
the Angolans achieve peace, stability and democracy,'' Savimbi said
after their 45-minute meeting at the Soviet Embassy.
   Shevardnadze said that if there is a cease-fire, ``it would be
easier for us to address the possibility of a cutoff of arms.'' The
Soviets have been providing arms to the leftist government in
Angola for more than a decade while Savimbi's forces have received
U.S. weaponry since 1986.
   As Shevardandze and Savimbi met, Secretary of State James A.
Baker III was holding talks with Angolan Foreign Minister Pedro de
Castro Van Dunem.
   Shevardnadze described the flurry of diplomatic activity as
being part of ``an interesting process'' aimed at bringing the
Angolan conflict to a peaceful conclusion.
   Savimbi made his appearance at the embassy shortly after Van
Dunem conferred for about 45 minutes with Shevardnadze.
   The two meetings represented the most dramatic evidence yet of
Moscow and Washington setting aside differences over Angola to
promote national reconciliation in the African country.
   ``We are trying to do what we can to help bring the parties
closer together so the next round of negotiations set for January
in Lisbon will be successful,'' a State Department official said
Tuesday.
   Savimbi is the leader of the UNITA rebel group that has been
fighting Angola's Soviet-backed army for 15 years. Of the major
Third World civil conflicts, nonehas dragged on longer than the
one in Angola.
   The war has killed 350,000 people, the Angolan government
estimates.
   The devastation of war has been compounded by drought that has
affected a huge area of the southern part of Angola. A United
Nations-sponsored relief effort began earlier this fall.
   The Soviets have spent billions of dollars in weaponry over the
years in efforts to defeat Savimbi's forces. The Angolan army has
received backing from Cuban troops virtually since the start of the
conflict, although the last of the Cuban contingent is scheduled to
leave Angola by next July under a 2-year-old agreement.
   Shevardnadze announced the meeting as he was winding up talks
Tuesday in Houston with Baker.
   A joint Soviet-American statement issued late Tuesday said the
session would include discussion of such issues as a cease-fire,
free participation of UNITA and other parties in Angola's political
process and the convening of free and fair elections with
monitoring by neutral observers.
   Also on the agenda was the termination of deliveries of all
lethal material to Angola upon agreement on a cease-fire.
   The negotiating environment for the January peace talks in
Lisbon seemed to brighten last weekend when Angola's ruling MPLA
party agreed to a multi-party system.
   U.S.-Soviet tensions over Angola date back to 1975 when the
leftist MPLA faction took power following the end of Portuguese
colonial rule. When South Africa intervened, Cuba sent forces to
defend the fledgling government.
   The Ford administration responded with a covert aid program for
Savimbi, but Congress prohibited all U.S. military involvement. The
ban was lifted under President Reagan, and Savimbi has received
U.S. support since 1986.
   In late October, Congress approved legislation that would halt
the $60 million aid program to the rebels if the Angolan government
agrees to a free election and the Soviets halt arms deliveries to
government forces.

<HEAD>Iraq Replaces Defense Minister, Orders Bomb Shelters</HEAD>

   Saddam Hussein on Wednesday replaced his aging defense minister
with a battle hero and ordered building owners to install bomb
shelters. But the Iraqi leader also met with an Arab emissary to
discuss ways to avoid war.
   Western analysts questioned why Saddam Hussein would change
defense ministers now, and speculated that the move indicated
opposition within the military to Saddam's refusal to leave Kuwait.
   The Iraqi announcement came as the evacuation of Western
captives neared completion.
   Twenty Irish nationals, three Canadians and two Italians flew
from Baghad to Amman, Jordan on Wednesday, and Americans were
heading home from London and Frankfurt, Germany, where they flew on
Tuesday. A final U.S. evacuation flight from Baghdad was set for
Thursday.
   At the United Nations, diplomats said the foreign ministers of
the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union had agreed
to meet in Europe within a month to again demand Iraq's full
withdrawal from the emirate it seized Aug. 2.
   The chief allies in the anti-Iraq coalition also intend to
assure Iraq that it will not face attack if it leaves Kuwait before
the Jan. 15 deadline set by the U.N. Security Council, the
diplomats said on condition of anonymity.
   In Baghdad, state radio said Saddam fired Gen. Abdel-Jaber
Khalil Shanshal as defense minister. He was replaced by Maj. Gen.
Saadi Toma Abbas, a hero of the 1980-88 war with Iran.
   Abbas, who is in his 50s, was credited as the strategist behind
the defense of the southern port city of Basra during that war,
using formidable defensive lines. The Iraqis, who have an estimated
450,000 troops in and around Kuwait, have built a similar defense
around the emirate.
   Abbas was the inspector-general of the armed forces and a former
deputy chief of staff, the radio said.
   The radio, quoting a decree from Saddam, said Shanshal, 70, was
retiring because of his age. But military analysts questioned the
timing behind the the firing, which came a month after Saddam
sacked his military chief of staff.
   ``This would tend to underline that there is opposition to his
strategy of holding onto Kuwait,'' said Paul Rogers, a defense
analyst at England's Bradford University and an expert of Middle
East military affairs.
   The appointment of Abbas ``could mean that Saddam is less than
ready to compromise'' on Kuwait, Rogers said.
   In a related development, Iraq's ruling Baath party newspaper,
Al-Thawra, said civil defense authorities have instructed all
owners of buildings with two or more floors to convert their
basements into shelters. It ordered the owners to post signs
informing people where to take cover.
   Under Iraqi law, landlords can be fined or imprisoned for
failing to build the shelters and prepare them to receive people in
time of war.
   Saddam, however, also talked peace on Wednesday, meeting with
Algerian President Chadli Bendjedid. Arab officials say Bendjedid
is trying to bring Saudi Arabia and Iraq together to negotiate a
settlement to the Persian Gulf crisis.
   An Arab diplomat in Jordan, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said Tuesday that Saudi officials have assured Bendjedid they would
meet with Saddam if he begins withdrawing from Kuwait.
   The Saudis have previously refused to talk until after a total
pullout.
   In other developments Wednesday:
   -Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze said the Soviet
Union has no plans for military involvement in the gulf. The
foreign minister, who is in the United States, sent a message to
the Soviet parliament after a group of deputies accused him of
preparing to send Soviet troops to the gulf without legislative
approval.
   -OPEC's president cautioned that current high levels of crude
production could leave the world ``awash in oil'' and cause turmoil
in the markets once the gulf crisis ends. Sadek Boussena made the
statement in opening a conference of the 13-member Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries in Vienna.
   -Germany and Japan disputed the Pentagon's claim that they have
been slow to make payments toward the cost of the U.S.-led gulf
force.
   Saddam last week ordered the release of all remaining
Westerners, citing positive diplomatic developments and his
country's readiness to defend itself.
   About 510 American citizens, most of them children with dual
citizenship, have opted to remain in Kuwait and Iraq, State
Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Wednesday.
   The final American chartered flight is scheduled to leave early
Thursday, with about 15 Americans from Iraq expected aboard,
including the last remaining captive who served as a ``human
shield'' at a strategic site, U.S. officials said.
   Since Iraq invaded Kuwait, the U.S. government has evacuated
2,520 American citizens and their family members on 13 chartered
flights.

   Mounting discontent and a ruined economy
are forcing reform in Albania, Europe's last bastion of Stalinism,
where leaders are buying time by making surprising concessions.
   Three days of student protest in the Albanian capital, Tirana,
prompted the startling decision Tuesday by the ruling Communists to
permit other political movements. Five members of the 13-member
ruling Politburo also were dropped and government changes promised.
   The decisions came just before President Ramiz Alia, head of
state and of the ruling Albanian Labor Party, met a group of the
striking students, urging them to return to class and to work
peacefully within the law for the reforms they seek.
   Students on Wednesday announced formation of the country's first
non-Communist party, the Democratic Party of Albania, to the cheers
of crowds in the capital, a witness reported.
   Albania has a turbulent history. For centuries, it was dominated
by Italian or Ottoman Turkish rulers, and it gained true
independence only after World War II under the Stalinist Enver
Hoxha.
   Alia, who took over when Hoxha died in 1985, appears to be
trying to contain an explosion of popular anger with swift
political maneuvering and timely concessions.
   In July, he defused the most serious crisis to date, allowing
thousands of Albanians jammed into foreign embassies in Tirana to
emigrate and reshuffling the leadership to offer the public
scapegoats to blame for political repression and economic misery.
   Wage increases also were promised, but Albanians say they have
not materialized.
   But this afforded only temporary respite from the leaders' basic
dilemma: how to make the changes needed to get the economy going
while retaining control and avoiding open rebellion.
   At a Communist party meeting last month, premier Adil Carcani
painted a picture of catastrophe in the economy. Alia bluntly told
workers on Nov. 29 that the economy ``is on the brink of a state of
emergency.''
   The drought has severely curbed electric supplies, mainly
generated from hydroelectric stations in the country's rugged
mountains, and affected crops grown on the fertile coatal plains.
   The students' protest that brought this week's historic changes
reportedly began with demands for more heat and light in their
wintry Tirana dormitories.
   Alia has attempted to ease food shortages, particularly of meat,
by allowing private shops that sell at two or three times the state
prices. He has also promised imports of food and other items, but
lacks the necessary hard currency to carry out the pledge.
   Isolated for decades, Albania is also seeking foreign
investment. As Alia himself warned the students Tuesday, that won't
come if there is political instability.
   But there is much cause for discontent. In towns, most homes are
in slumlike, three-story apartment blocks. Factories are outdated
and extremely dilapidated. In the countryside, children trudge
miles to school while women tend fields with primitive picks and
hoes.
   Most Albanians seem to express their disgust with this state of
affairs by working less and less, ignoring the leadership's many
appeals to toil for economic improvement.
   But a leadership steeped in decades of authoritarian rule is
finding it hard to adjust to the new changes.
   It remains to be seen whether any new political parties will be
allowed to contest scheduled parliamentary elections in February.
The Communists have made no mention of giving up their
constitutional monopoly on power.
   Also, a population unused to democracy might find it difficult
to organize any opposition to the Communists, who have dominated
public life since taking power in 1944.
   Students were a powerful force behind many of Eastern Europe's
revolutions last year, and are among the few groups in Albania who
have the courage and unity to challenge the Communists.
   With the highest birth rate in Europe, Albania is a country of
young people. About 75 percent of its 3.2 million people are under
40. They learn about the outside world from television broadcasts
from neighboring Yugoslavia, Greece and Italy and from the
Albanian-language service of Voice of America.
   This contact with the outside world and the reforms made this
year have emboldened the young, who do not have the deeply
instilled fear of those who survived Hoxha's harsh rule.

<HEAD>Northern California Community Approves Law to Prevent Dog, Cat
Litters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>REDWOOD CITY, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Faced with too many stray dogs and
cats, San Mateo County officials have tentatively approved the
nation's first law that requires nearly all pets to be neutered to
prevent unplanned litters.
   The ordinance approved Tuesday night would impose a moratorium
on all breeding by private dog and cat owners for six months
beginning in July.
   After Jan. 1, 1992, only dogs and cats owned by professional and
hobbyist breeders who hold special permits would be allowed to
reproduce. All other cats and dogs in unincorporated areas of the
county 15 miles south of San Francisco would have to be neutered.
   ``We're very, very pleased. We definitely made history tonight
and we hope (others) will follow suit around the country,'' said
Sherry Richert, spokeswoman for the Peninsula Humane Society.
   Supervisor Tom Nolan, who wrote the ordinance, agreed: ``We took
an historic first step ... toward solving the animal overpopulation
problem.''
   Nolan introduced the measure in October after learning the
humane society kills 10,000 strays each year.
   If approved on final reading next Tuesday, the ordinance will
become law, setting up a committee to set the specific rules and
fees for licensing professional and hobby breeders. Violators would
be fined $500.
   Angry pet owners, including professional and amateur breeders,
have threatened to sue if the law passes.
   ``It's going to be heavily litigated,'' predicted Mark Rudy, a
lawyer representing local dog breeders.
   ``Our canine defense fund has $350,000 in it and we will use
it,'' said Betty-Anne Stenmark, a member of Responsible Dog
Breeders of San Mateo County.
   ``A (breeding) moratorium is blackmail,'' added J. Alan Stern,
spokesman for the American Kennel Club. He urged the board to seek
other means of solving the problem and called for more education
and tougher leash laws.
   The board approved the ban 4-1 after a four-hour hearing that
drew breeders from as far away as Washington, D.C. Among those who
spoke in favor of the measure was singer Grace Slick of the
Jefferson Starship, an animal rights activist who lives in Marin
County north of San Francisco.
   ``We're users, the human race. One of the things we use the most
are the animals,'' Slick said.
   Outside, one of about 50 demonstrators against the ordinance
carried a sign reading: ``If the Humane Society had been in
Hollywood, there would be no Lassie.''

   Lech Walesa stepped down Wednesday as
leader of Solidarity, telling the union he led in its 10-year
battle against Communism to expect major changes once he becomes
Poland's president.
   The president-elect also held talks in the Baltic resort of
Sopot, his base of operations during the transition, on naming a
new government.
   Union sources and a report in the daily Gazeta Wyborcza said
Walesa's most likely nominee for prime minister is Jan Olszewski, a
lawyer known for defending opposition activists.
   Meanwhile, the man Walesa defeated in Poland's first popular
presidential elections, emigre businessman Stanislaw Tyminski, left
the country after posting a $100,000 bond to assure his return by
Jan. 5 to answer charges of slandering the prime minister.
   Announcing his resignation as Solidarity's chairman, Walesasaid:
``I want to thank you for our common effort, thanks to which we
achieved the greatest honor.'' He spoke at a Solidarity National
Commission meeting.
   When he becomes president, he said, there will be ``big changes
... an earthquake.'' But he pledged they will be ``peaceful.''
   Solidarity spearheaded changes that led to the toppling of
Poland's Communist government and helped bring about peaceful
revolutions elsewhere in Eastern Europe.
   Walesa urged the union to be active in free parliamentary
elections this spring, and to build a base to support his
presidency through the transition to a capitalist economy and a
European democracy.
   ``There will be a great attack of the Tyminskis,'' Walesa said,
referring to his rival, who had won support from members of the
former Communist Party. ``We should be prepared so there will be no
counter-revolution that could topple the president.''
   The National Commission decided that union vice chairmen Lech
Klaczynski and Stefan Jurczak will run Solidarity until an
emergency congress can be held - perhaps as soon as next month - to
elect a new chairman.
   The congress also likely will decide whether to form a political
wing of Solidarity or to confine itself to traditional union work,
representing workers in negotiations.
   The union leadership passed a resolution thanking Walesa,
Solidarity's only chairman since its founding during shipyard
strikes in August 1980, as the Soviet bloc's first legal free trade
union.
   ``He has well served his homeland,'' the resolution concluded.
   Walesa is expected to be sworn in Dec. 21 to a five-year term as
president.
   He will not announce his choice for prime minister until the
Supreme Court validates his election and parliament accepts the
resignation of Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki's Cabinet,
expected Friday, said Walesa's spokesman Andrzej Drzycinski.
   ``Talks are being held with all people who are under
consideration for government and state posts,'' Drzycimski said. He
said he could not say who was consulted or when the discussions
would end.
   Walesa's first foreign visitor as president-elect was U.S.
Ambassador Thomas Simons, who brought a letter of congratulations
from President Bush. Walesa and Simons discussed Poland's foreign
debt, Drzycimski said.
   Walesa also received Rabbi James A. Rudin of the American Jewish
Committee.
   ``The president and I had a very warm, friendly and open meeting
in which he expressed himself in the strongest possible terms
denouncing all forms - all forms - of anti-Semitism,'' Rudin told
reporters afterward.
   He said Walesa pledged ``to tend and care for the (Jewish)
tradition which was destroyed during the Nazi Holocaust and to
provide for proper remembering and commemoration of the Jewish
Warsaw Ghetto Uprising in 1943.''
   Walesa's campaign was dogged by accusations of anti-Semitism,
charges he vociferously denied.
   Tyminski's departure for Canada followed an agreement with
prosecutors who wanted to guarantee he would return to answer
charges that at a campaign rally last month, he slandered
Mazowiecki by accusing him of economic mismanagement and selling
off state assets too cheaply.
   The candidate was allowed to go after posting bond. Two senators
and the election commissioner vouched for Tyminski, saying he
should be allowed to spend Christmas with his children in Canada.
   Tyminski was seen off by 50 supporters chanting, ``Poland Is
with You.'' ``I am of Poland,'' answered the candidate before
boarding his flight.

   Reform rabbis have urged the United States to

   The executive board of the Central Conference of American

Saddam Hussein.
   The board, in a statement Tuesday, also insisted that the United

invasion of Kuwait and Israeli presence in the West Bank and Gaza.
   ``They are fundamentally different in origin and
administration,'' the statement said.

Saddam Huissein in power will lead to greater death and destruction

<HEAD>Rule Changes May Make It More Difficult to Get Some Mortgages</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Both first-time home buyers and move-up buyers
may find it somewhat more difficult to obtain a mortgage under rule
changes announced Wednesday by a major government-sponsored
purchaser of loans.
   The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., known as Freddie Mac, said
it would phase out its purchases of low-documentation mortgages and
of adjustable-rate mortgages with less than a 10 percent
downpayment.
   Purchases of those types of loans, both considered somewhat
riskier than standard mortgages, will be eliminated entirely after
March 31.
   In a low-documentation or no-documentation loan, the lender, in
order to speed the loan approval, waives some of the usual proof
demanded of the borrower's financial condition, sometimes including
income and employment verification.
   Typically, so-called no-doc or low-doc mortgages are used by
people with substantial equity in a home they are selling and who
want to get fast approval on a mortgage for a new home.
   Low-downpayment, adjustable-rate mortgages are most popular with
renters who barely have enough money to buy a home.
   The Federal National Mortgage Association, Fannie Mae, which
announced two months ago that it was tightening its
low-documentation loan program, lauded Freddie Mac's decision as
``a prudent and positive step.''
   Both will continue to purchase alternative-documentation
mortgages in which a borrower's financial standing is verified with
more easily obtainable documents such as paychecks stubs.
   Freddie Mac estimates about 25 percent of the loans it is
purchasing this year will be low-documentation mortgages. It said 9
percent of the adjustable-rate loans in its portfolio are
low-downpayment mortgages.
   James Nelson, president of the Mortgage Bankers Association of
America, a trade group, conceded that the changes will lengthen the
loan processing time for some move-up buyers and pinch some
first-time home buyers. But, he said they were desirable because of
the deterioration of the economy nationally and of home prices in
some areas.
   ``It's a sound move, given the times we are in,'' he said.
   Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are congressionally chartered, but
stockholder-owned companies. They finance about one quarter of the
nation's single-family home sales by buying loans from banks and
other lenders. They retain some and repackage others into
securities for resale to investors.
   During the past year, both companies have come under pressure
from the Treasury Department to tighten their procedures. Although
both have only limited government backing, most investors assume
they would be bailed out by the government if they got into
trouble.
   Fannie Mae continues to buy low-downpayment, adjustable-rate
mortgages. It said it has not had a default problem with the loans
because it purchases only from established lenders with a proven
track record.
   Fannie Mae Senior Vice President Robert Engelstad refused to
disclose how many such loans the agency buys or the default rate.

<HEAD>AT&amp;T, MCI Settle Ad, Sales Lawsuits, Offer Rules on Customer
Switches</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   AT&amp;T and MCI agreed Wednesday to settle
lawsuits that charged false advertising and customer theft, and
proposed new federal standards to prevent consumers from being
switched from one long-distance company to another against their
will.
   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. and MCI Communications Corp.,
which had sued one another over their multimillion-dollar ad
campaigns, agreed to settle the suits out of court, along with an
AT&amp;T suit against MCI and its telemarketing agent that alleged
false and deceptive sales practices.
   Terms of the agreement were not disclosed.
   MCI spokeswoman Pam Small said company officials were bound by
the agreement not to comment on the settlement.
   But lest anyone think the two arch rivals were going to
discontinue their all-out scrap for new customers, she said ``we're
still competitors.''
   And AT&amp;T spokesman Herb Linnen said his company ``will continue
to pursue customers and try to retain existing ones with the same
resourcefulness and aggressiveness we have pursued in the past.''
   That has included negative ad campaigns in which ``customers''
are shown getting fed up with sales pitches from MCI, or skits in
which they declare competing long-distance companies should put
their claims of lower prices and better service in writing.
   But Linnen said AT&amp;T wanted to ``get beyond'' the recent legal
squabbling, which he said ``is really not good for either AT&amp;T or
MCI, or for the customer.''
   As part of the agreement, the two companies agreed to propose to
the Federal Communications Commission industry-wide standards to
help prevent unauthorized switching of customers by long-distance
companies.
   State and federal authorities and local phone companies have
received tens of thousands of complaints about unauthorized
switching.
   The proposed standards would permit switches only by one of the
following means:
   -A customer-initiated call to an 800 number of the carrier to
which the customer is switching.
   -Independent third-party confirmation.
   -Signed letter of authorization.
   -A call placed by the customer to their local or long-distance
telephone company.
   AT&amp;T, which had claimed it was losing customers because of
unauthorized switching by MCI and its telemarketing agent, had
asked the FCC in January to require a customer's written
authorization before a switch could be made. Current rules require
only that a long-distance company be able to present, if demanded
by a local phone company, written authorization from a customer.
   Linnen said AT&amp;T still considered written pre-authorization the
best method, but since the FCC has not acted, AT&amp;T thought the
compromise ``was better than waiting for the perfect solution that
might never arrive.''
   The two companies, along with US Sprint, have been locked in a
fierce battle for customers. AT&amp;T and MCI, or their agents, have
been placing calls to millions of phone users each month trying to
get them to switch their long-distance service.
   Since the breakup of the old Bell System in 1984, AT&amp;T's share
of the long-distance market has fallen to below 70 percent. MCI,
the nation's second largest long-distance carrier, now has about 15
percent of the market.
   MCI had sued AT&amp;T in U.S. District Court in Washington on Oct.
10, 1989, alleging false and deceptive advertising practices. AT&amp;T
countersued on Oct. 26.
   On Jan. 10 this year, AT&amp;T sued MCI and its telemarketing agent
in Newark, N.J., federal court, alleging false and deceptive
telemarketing practices.
   Both sides denied any wrongdoing and no dollar amounts were
specified in the suits.

<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Former Gov. John Connally predicts the United
States will go to war in the Persian Gulf and President Bush will
be destroyed in a manner that President Johnson was destroyed by
Vietnam.
   ``I hope to hell we don't get in a war, but it looks like we are
going to,'' said Connally.
   Connally, who served as President Nixon's Treasury secretary and
once sought the Republican presidential nomination, traveled to
Iraq this month with Oscar Wyatt, chairman of Coastal Corp.
Connally, a member of the board of directors of the Houston energy
firm, returned from Baghdad early Sunday aboard a Coastal jet with
21 former hostages.
   Connally said Tuesday that Baghdad looked ready for war.
   ``You look at the city and it's operating in a normal fashion,''
he said. ``You go see the president and you go a very circuitous
route with obstacles and guards everywhere at every turn, every
intersection. One of them is already wearing a gas mask, so they
are expecting trouble.''
   Asked about the situation's effect on Bush, Connally replied:
``I think it'll destroy him. I saw it destroy Johnson and it will
destroy Bush. He'll be popular as hell for 60 days.''

<HEAD>Hostage Receives Red-Carpet Welcome Home</HEAD>

   John Henry Cole is looking forward to
holding his grandson for the first time, thanks to the efforts of
his wife and the relatives of other hostages who came to Iraq to
plead for his release.
   ``If the media hadn't been there working and the women and the
wives hadn't been there working, we would have still been there,''
Cole said Tuesday.
   Cole, 50, was in Kuwait when Iraq invaded Aug. 2. He remained in
hiding, but was captured and held as a ``human shield'' in
September at an oil refinery south of Baghdad.
   His wife, Donnita, was among a group of 17 people who had
traveled to Baghdad with other family members before Saddam
Hussein's decision to release all hostages.
   The Coles returned Tuesday to a red-carpet welcome from the
Odessa Chamber of Commerce at Midland International Airport.
   ``I told you I'd bring him home,'' Mrs. Cole told cheering
family, friends and city officials.
   Cole joked that Saddam suddenly released all hostages because,
``he was afraid of facing the American women who came to get their
husbands.''
   Mrs. Cole said her group had difficulty getting through
immigration in Baghdad ``because they didn't know what to do with a
bunch of women and two men.''
   ``They had all these women who were starting to breathe fire and
look mean and nasty and tough. The ones that weren't from Texas, we
made honorary Texans out of them,'' Mrs. Cole said.
   Cole, who had worked for Houston-based OGE Drilling Inc., had
not yet seen his 4-month-old grandson, John Kiefer Cole. The boy's
father, John Edward Cole, 23, is with the Special Forces in Saudi
Arabia for Operation Desert Shield.
   Cole said he supports President Bush's actions in the Middle
East.
   ``I back the president right now,'' Cole said. ``I voted for the
man. I can't turn down now.''
   Since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, the U.S. government has
evacuated 2,520 American citizens and their family members on 13
chartered flights.
   The final American chartered flight is scheduled to leave early
Thursday, with about 15 Americans from Iraq on board, including the
last remaining person who was a ``human shield.''
   After they pop open a bottle of champagne, the Coles planned to
take it easy.
   ``I got my husband home and now I can relax,'' Mrs. Cole said.
``Now, the old adrenalin can kind of slow down.''

   Germany and Japan on Wednesday disputed a
U.S. accusation that they have delivered barely one-fifth of the
aid they promised to back U.S. military operations in the Persian
Gulf.
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl's chief spokesman, Hans Klein, said
Germany has already made available well over half of the $2.24
billion it promised. The Defense Ministry said the aid made
available includes $1.09 billion in military equipment and
transport.
   Some of the military supplies are waiting at German ports for
delivery to the Middle East, said a Defense Ministry spokesman,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   Klein said Germany ``does not know the basis for these
calculations (the Pentagon's). In any event, they do not correspond
with facts.''
   A Japanese Foreign Ministry official said that of $4 billion
pledged for the military effort and to support Arab states affected
by the gulf crisis, $600 million has been spent.
   The process for disbursing another $600 million in emergency
loans for Jordan and Turkey will be completed very soon, said
another ministry official. ``It is not the case that the Japanese
government is delaying disbursement,'' he said.
   Both Japanese officials spoke on condition of anonymity under
normal briefing rules.
   On Tuesday, Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said Japan had
delivered only $426 million in cash and material support, and
Germany only $337 million.
   Neither Japan nor Germany has sent armed forces to the gulf,
citing constitutional restrictions.
   Of the six countries that offered the largest contributions to
Operation Desert Shield at its outset in August, only Kuwait has
given all that it promised, Williams said.
   He declined to comment on the reasons for the delayed
contributions from other allies. Pledges totaling more than $6.5
billion were made for calendar year 1990.
   The spokesman said the United States plans to ask an undisclosed
number of allied nations to increase their contributions for 1991.
He said he did not know how much money would be sought or when the
requests would be made.
   U.S. sources said Monday that Desert Shield may cost $30 billion
in 1991. The Pentagon's original cost estimate was $15 billion, but
that was before President Bush ordered huge reinforcements to the
gulf on Nov. 8.

<HEAD>Residents Rally to Keep One-Room Schoolhouse Open</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRISTOL, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of two remaining one-room schoolhouses
in New Hampshire is on the verge of being closed to save money, but
parents who say their children thrived there are fighting the plan.
   ``Here's something that works. People care about that school,''
said Bob Wolff, a resident who helped circulate a petition opposing
the plan to temporarily close the Alexandria Village School.
   School Superintendent George Corrette suggested the temporary
closure to save an estimated $40,000 a year. But residents who fear
that temporary might mean forever presented the petition at a
school board meeting Monday.
   ``I've seen temporary taxes that have been in effect all my
life,'' Wolff said. ``You say you're going to reopen it when you
have extra money? It's not going to happen.''
   The schoolhouse, which was built in the 1840s, is one of two
left in New Hampshire. The second is in Landaff, a community of
fewer than 300 people.
   Former Alexandria school board member Fletcher DeWolf said a
piece of history would be lost with the school. Eleven other
one-room schoolhouses in Alexandria from the pre-Civil War era have
been turned into summer cottages, he said.
   Parents at the meeting said their children would not do as well
if they were transferred to the more impersonal environment of the
larger regional elementary schools.
   Community involvement singles out the schoolhouse, said Lori
Benson, who teaches its 17 first- and second-graders.
   Parents drop in daily, to help with projects such as making
applesauce and potting spider plants, she said.
   Even in the face of rising property taxes, several people at the
board meeting said they would be willing to pay more to keep the
school open.
   ``A lot of the parents went here, their grandparents went
here,'' said Benson, who has taught in the 800-member community for
two years. ``It's a very small community. They love and support
their one-room schoolhouse.''

   Rival black leaders Nelson Mandela
and Mangosuthu Buthelezi on Wednesday urged an end to fighting that
has claimed 124 lives. But they declined to meet as they toured
this township to urge peace.
   African National Congress leader Mandela and Zulu leader
Buthelezi visited diffekoza, telling followers to
end the fighting. Heavily armed soldiers and police in armored
vehicles ringed the black township east of Johannesburg and lined
the streets to ensure there was no violence.
   Police said Wednesday that 124 had been killed rent parts of Tosince
fighting
flared in Tokoza on Sunday. No fighting was reported Wednesday, but
police were finding bodies of people killed earlier.
   Mandela's convoy turned back when it approached some Zulu
hostels and about 100 angry Zulu men and women yelled threats,
including ``Away Mandela.'' Troops ringed the chanting Zulus and
Mandela's group did not appear to be in danger.
   Black factional fighting in the Johannesburg area has claimed at
least 1,000 lives since August. The fighting pits Xhosas and other
blacks loyal to the ANC against Zulus tied to Buthelezi's Inkatha
Freedom Party.
   Buthelezi, accompanied by Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok,
told about 3,000 Zulus armed with spears, knives and axes there

   Thousands of Albanians chanting
``Democracy, democracy'' on Wednesday hailed the foundation of the
tiny Stalinist country's first non-Communist political party.
   Albanians reached by telephone said thousands of people surged
into University Square in Tirana, Albania's capital, to support
students who won unprecedented concessions from the Communist
leadership in several days of protests.
   The developments appeared to herald the end of one-party rule
not only in the Balkan nation, but in all of Europe. Albania, a
country of just over 3 million, has been the last on the continent
to cling to one-party Communist rule.
   President Ramiz Alia addressed the nation late Wednesday and
asked for calm.
   He called on ``the political and patriotic conscience of you all
to avoid mistakes which could have consequences for the entire
country.'' His taped radio message was monitored by the British
Broadcasting Corp. in London.
   Alia and his Communist leadership declared Tuesday that they
would allow formation of non-Communist parties in Albania, which
was isolated for decades by its hard-line rulers.
   The crowds cheered wildly Wednesday as students and others
announced formation of the Democratic Party of Albania, according
to a Tirana engineer reached by telephone from Vienna.
   Zamira Koleze, a reporter for Albania's official radio, said
students would try to register the party Thursday at the Ministry
of Justice.
   The huge peaceful crowd chanted ``Demcoracy, democracy,'' ``We
want Albania to be like Europe'' and ``We want democratic
Albania,'' the engineer said. He spoke on condition of anonymity.
   There was also a cheer for Alia for allowing alternative
political parties, the engineer said.
   An editor for the official ATA news agency said those who
attended the rally filled a big field, as well as nearby hillsides
and the staircases of a student residence.
   ``It was without disorder, completely regular,'' Koleze said.
``It all went well. When it was over, everyone returned to their
homes.''
   Estimatesof the number of people who rallied ranged from 10,000
to 100,000.
   Alia, who has been seeking to slowly introduce moderate reforms,
succeeded Tuesday in ousting five hard-line members of the
13-member ruling Politburo of the Communist Party. He called on
Premier Adil Carcani to reshuffle the government as well.
   The Communist Party, formally called the Albanian Labor Party,
decided to hold a national meeting Dec. 26. The meeting is to work
out the party's electoral platform, but it could also make more
leadership changes.
   The engineer said the new opposition party's guiding committee
would meet soon to choose a leader. He said the party intended to
contest parliamentary elections scheduled for Feb. 10.
   But it was not immediately clear whether the Communists would
allow the party to take part.
   Last month, the legislature adopted a new election law
permitting more than one candidate, but officials said then that
pluralism would not be permitted.
   Alia told representatives of the students he met with Tuesday
that any new political organization would have to apply for
registration with the Justice Ministry.
   Alia previously rejected the type of democratic reforms that
swept Communists from power in Eastern Europe last year.
   On Tuesday, he appealed to the police as well as the students to
``act correctly, in a civilized and democratic way,'' ATA reported.
   The engineer indicated the people who attended the rally also
wanted to avoid bloodshed.
   ``We want to go ahead without blood, absolutely without blood.
All will be solved by speaking and by discussion,'' he said.
   Since assuming power in 1985 after the death of his predecessor
and Albania's founder, Enver Hoxha, Alia has sought to lead his
country out of self-imposed isolation, establishing diplomatic
relations with dozens of countries and seeking to renew ties with
the superpowers.
   Wednesday's mass rally followed four days of protest by students
and weekend clashes with police in which several people were
injured and some arrested. Reports that one or more people may have
been killed could not be confirmed.
   Students, who boycotted classes this week after Sunday's
violence, returned to classes Wednesday, according to an official
reached by telephone from Vienna. He also spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The Albanian official said there were no reports of unrest
elsewhere in the country.
   The student demonstrations were the first known major opposition
to the Communist leadership since July, when thousands of Albanians
stormed foreign embassies and refused to leave until they were
granted permission to emigrate.
   On Tuesday, about 10,000 people who gathered in the university
quarter welcomed the announcement that pluralism would be permitted
with chants of ``Down with the dictatorship,'' ``Long Live
Freedom'' and ``Long live Democracy,'' the Austria Press Agency
reported.
   An Italian member of the European Parliament visiting Albania,
Alexander Langer, told APA in a telephone interview that officials
were becoming ``increasingly pluralistic by the hour. This appears
to reflect what is happening.''

   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze
extended the hand of reconciliation Wednesday to the Angolan
anti-communist rebel leader whose forces have been at war with the
Soviet-backed government in Angola for 15 years.
   ``The foreign minister has assured us of their desire to help
the Angolans achieve peace, stability and democracy,'' insurgent
leader Jonas Savimbi said after an unprecedented 45-minute meeting
with Shevardnadze at the Soviet Embassy.
   ``The most important thing is that all the big powers understand
they can cooperate to find peace and stability of our country.''
   Shevardnadze said if the MPLA government and the UNITA rebels
are able to reach a cease-fire agreement, ``then it would be easier
for us to address the possibility of a cutoff of arms.''
   The Soviets have been a generous arms supplier of the MPLA
government since 1975. The United States has been aiding Savimbi's
forces for the past four years.
   The Bush administration's rationale for continuing to arm UNITA
is that the leftist government would otherwise have less incentive
to negotiate a settlement.
   The end of the Cold War generally has had little impact on the
series of regional conflicts spawned during the era of
Soviet-American hostility.
   For some time, though, the momentum has been on the side of a
political settlement in Angola as opposed to a military victory by
either side. That perception was underscored when Savimbi ascended
to the second floor of the Soviet Embassy Wednesday for his meeting
with Shevardnadze, passing below a large portrait of Lenin while en
route.
   Almost simultaneously, Secretary of State James A. Baker III was
meeting with Angolan Foreign Minister Pedro de Castro Van Dunem.
The idea of a Savimbi-Shervardnadze meeting was first broached
privately by Baker when he met here with Savimbi in early October.
   To make sure Van Dunem could arrive on time for the hastily
arranged talks, the Bush administration took the unusual step of
allowing the Angolan aircraft in which he flew here to land at
nearby Andrews Air Force Base, Md., sources close to Van Dunem
said. He went straight to the Soviet Embassy for a meeting with
Shevardnadze.
   After his talks with Baker, Van Dunem said, ``Progress is being
made towards an agreement which can lead to a cease-fire.''
   Wednesday's discussions will be followed up on Thursday with a
five-party meeting involving representatives of the two Angolan
factions, the United States, the Soviet Union and Portugal, the
former colonial power which has been mediating the conflict.
   Portugal's chief mediator, Jose Manuel Durao Barroso, told
reporters in the Angolan capital of Luanda on Tuesday that a
cease-fire agreement could be in place by March. A stumbling block
is the timing of an election once a cease fire is reached.
   Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos said recently he
believes an election could be held within three years of a
cease-fire. But Savimbi, in a written statement issued after his
meeting with Shevardnadze, said he told the Soviet diplomat that a
long delay would risk the collapse of the truce.
   Dos Santos has said he believes that an extended delay is
required because roads have to be cleared of mines and problems
involving voter registration.

   The nation should raise its educational sights
to reach world class standards, President Bush said Wednesday.
   ``American kids already rank too low compared to our chief
industrial competitors,'' Bush said at an awards ceremony for the
Jobs for America's Graduates Program. ``America's schools must, and
will, aspire to world-class standards.''
   He said schools have been stifled with ``requirements and red
tape. Let's give our schools something teachers and principals
don't have enough of - authority.''
   Bush invoked a catchword, ``empowerment,'' which is emerging
among some officials as an administration theme for achieving
better educational performance.
   Using the empowerment notion by allowing parents to decide what
schools their children should attend ``is the fundamental reform
that drives forward all the others'' in education, Bush said.
   Parental choice involves a variety of methods to allow parents
to send their children to public schools outside their
neighborhoods.
   ``We've got to raise our sights - for our students, for our
schools,'' Bush said.
   Jobs for America's Graduates is a 19-state program that helps
place high school graduates in job training programs. The
organization is funded privately, with matching funds from the Job
Training Partnership Act, and with state funds.
   As vice president, Bush was a founding member of the board of
directors,
   He said the program has helped low-income young people who might
otherwise have had little career success.

<HEAD>FEC Says Wright Failed To Disclose Use of S&amp;L Execs Plane</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JENNIFER DIXON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Federal Election Commission said Wednesday
that two fund-raising committees for former House Speaker Jim
Wright accepted an illegal contribution from a Texas businessmen
later imprisoned in connection with the savings and loan scandal.
   FEC spokesman Scott Moxley said Wright's principal fund-raising
committee and his leadership political action committee have agreed
to pay penalties totaling $1,500 to settle the case.
   At issue was Wright's use of a chartered airplane that
crisscrossed Texas between June 30 and July 2, 1985, to promote a
``Cowtown Jamboree'' in Fort Worth. The fund-raiser sought $1
million for Wright's principal campaign committee, the Wright
Appreciation Committee, and his leadership PAC, the Majority
Congress Committee.
   Wright, a Fort Worth Democrat who was House majority leader at
the time, was on his way to Haiti Wednesday and could not be
reached for comment, a spokesman said.
   Under the conciliation agreement, the two committees
acknowledged they accepted an illegal contribution from the owner
of the plane, Kenneth C. Hood, and that they failed to disclose the
receipt of the contribution. The committees also acknowledged a
violation stemming from the way they repaid Hood for the use of the
plane 46 months later, Moxley said.
   Wright repaid Hood $8,050 in April 1989, in the midst of a House
ethics committee investigation that led to his resignation a month
later. At the time, Wright said the failure to pay the bill was an
``oversight.''
   Hood had purchased the plane from Sunbelt Savings Association, a
failed thrift in Dallas, through a $1.3 million loan from Sunbelt.
Hood owed Sunbelt Savings $90 million by the end of 1986, the FEC
said.
   Hood told the FEC that Edwin McBirney, then owner of Sunbelt
Savings Association, said Wright needed the airplane, and that
McBirney promised that he and Thomas M. Gaubert, owner of another
S&amp;L, would pay for the trip.
   After the flight, Hood said McBirney and Gaubert told him that
it would be a ``positive gesture'' to absorb some of the costs,
Moxley said. Hood then billed them $8,050, two-thirds of the actual
cost, Moxley said.
   Gaubert told the FEC he was merely a passenger on the flight and
was not connected to the campaign committee or to Hood, Moxley
said. McBirney denied he pressured Hood to let Wright use the jet.
   Gaubert, whose S&amp;L was closed by state regulators in 1987, had
persuaded Wright to intervene with federal regulators on behalf of
the Irving-based thrift, Independent American Savings Association.
   FEC's general counsel had recommended that the commission find
Wright violated the law because he was on the airplane, but the FEC
found no reason to believe that was the case. The commission also
said it had no reason to believe McBirney or Gaubert paid for any
costs of the flight.
   The commission, however, said it found reason to believe Hood
made excess, illegal contributions to Wright.
   Hood was sentenced Feb. 15, 1990, to two years in prison and
fined $50,000 for making false statements to a federally insured
institution - Sunbelt Savings. He also was sentenced to five years'
probation and fined another $50,000 for conspiring to defraud the
Internal Revenue Service.
   McBirney was indicted in July on 17 counts alleging bank fraud,
misappropiation of funds, false entries and making false
statements to regulators.

   Secretary of State James A. Baker III
hopes the Soviet, British, French and Chinese foreign ministers
will join him in Europe this month to demand again that Iraq
withdraw from Kuwait by Jan. 15, diplomats said Wednesday.
   The foreign ministers would also assure Iraq that it won't be
attacked if Iraqi troops leave Kuwait by that date, the diplomats
said on condition of anonymity.
   The ministerial meeting by the five permanent Security Council
members would be intended to abolish any impression that Iraq could
retain two islands that control access to the Shatt-al-Arab
waterway or part of an oilfield straddling the Iraq-Kuwait border.
   Baker has said, however, that when the emir of Kuwait's
government is restored to power, Iraq and Kuwait could then
negotiate any economic and territorial disputes between them.
   Diplomats said the permanent Security Council members don't want
Saddam Hussein to feel that the U.S.-led multinational force in the
Persian Gulf is determined to attack Iraq whether it obeys the
council or not.
   Saddam would have no motive to withdraw if he believed attack is
inevitable, they said.
   The foreign ministers would meet in Europe after Iraqi Foreign
Minister Tariq Aziz meets President Bush in Washington this month,
but before Baker goes to Baghdad for talks with Saddam, the
diplomats said.
   Baer has been waiting for word from Baghdad on a date to see
Saddam since he turned down Jan. 12 because it was too close to the
U.N.-ordered Jan. 15 deadline for withdrawal of Iraqi troops.
   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, who is in
Washington for talks with Baker and Bush, said Tuesday that ``It is
very important that a goodwill grace period that expires on Jan. 15
is taken up by a very active diplomatic and political effort.''
   Shevardnadze said, ``We pin much hope on the coming contacts.''
   The United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union agree
in principle that their foreign ministers should meet in Europe
with China's foreign minister to send a message to Baghdad,
diplomats said.
   China's willingness to participate is in question, because
Beijing opposes using military force to drive Iraq from Kuwait.
   China abstained when the Security Council voted 12-2 on Nov. 29
to adopt a resolution authorizing U.N. members to use all necessary
means, including military force, to liberate Kuwait unless Iraq
withdraws by Jan. 15.

   President Slobodan Milosevic and his
renamed Communist Party crushed all opposition in first-round
balloting in Serbia, Yugoslavia's largest republic, according to
official results released Wednesday.
   Milosevic, the hard-line leader of the former Serbian Communist
Party, carried 65 percent of the vote, Caslav Ignjatovic, the head
of the Serbian Electoral Commission, told reporters.
   That was enough to be re-elected to Serbia's powerful presidency
outright. His leading challenger, Vuk Draskovic of the Serbian
Renewal Movement, won only 16.4 percent.
   Milosevic's Socialist Party, the renamed Communist Party,
crushed all opposition in the first-round vote Sunday, capturing 87
of the 250 parliamentary seats in the republic's first multiparty
election since 1938, the results showed.
   Runoff elections will take place in 152 electoral districts,
where no candidates won a majority. Twenty opposition parties on
Wednesday announced they would form a coalition to oppose
Milosevic's Socialist Party in the second round Dec. 23.
   Milosevic captured 65 percent of the vote - a 4-to-1 triumph
over his nearest challenger, Draskovic, according to the Serbian
Electoral Commission.
   His party won 45.8 percent of the parliamentary vote, the
Serbian Renewal Movement won 15.7 percent and independent
candidates 9 percent. More than 20 other parties took smaller
percentages of the vote.
   The runoffs are not expected to substantially alter the
overwhelming victory of the Socialists.
   The sweeping victory, along with a similar Communist victory in
the neighboring republic of Montenegro, may push Yugoslavia's
fragile federation one step closer to disintegration.
   Milosevic's win threatens to deepen the rift between Serbia and
Western-minded republics of Croatia and Slovenia.
   While Serbia is holding its runoff elections, Slovenia will be
voting in a plebiscite on independence from Yugoslavia.
   The Slovenian daily Nezavisni Dnevnik ascribed the Socialist
victory ``primarily to the fact that the authority had the power to
introduce a veritable media occupation of Serbia.''
   The Socialists' victory in Serbia was marred by a boycott in
Kosovo province, which is dominated by ethnic Albanians.
   Elections there will have to be repeated in 30 of 34 districts
in which less than half of the voters participated.
   Communist authorities in Serbia dissolved Kosovo's parliament
and government and shut down influential Albanian-language media
after parliament tried to proclaim Kosovo a republic earlier this
year.
   The Serbian leaders said they had to take control to prevent
Kosovo from seceding from Serbia and Yugoslavia to join neighboring
Albania, and to protect the non-Albanian population.
   In runoff balloting, the boycott will be ineffective because a
simple majority of the voters who cast ballots will be enough to
elect deputies.

   Some Nobel Prize winners will wake up
Thursday in their hotel rooms surrounded by golden-haired young
women with candles on their heads, singing carols.
   It's Lucia Day, when Swedes brighten up the darkest period of
the year with celebrations embracing a Roman Catholic martyr and a
pre-Christian light festival.
   Before the Gregorian calendar was adopted, the feast of St.
Lucia was on the shortest day of the year. It commemorated a virgin
who was martyred in Syracuse, Sicily in 304 A.D.
   Pagan Swedes had their own mid-winter celebrations of light on
the year's shortest day. After Sweden was Christianized, the Roman
Catholic saint portrayed with lights in her golden hair became a
natural favorite.
   Nowadays Lucia processions occur throughout Sweden in offices,
on the streets and in schools. Singing young women with
electric-candle crowns lead the parade. People dressed as gnomes
hand out ginger snaps. Little ``star boys'' march along with
cone-shaped caps and star-topped wands.
   The festival falls three days after the Nobel Prize awards
ceremony. Many of the scientists, authors and statesmen are still
on hand, giving lectures and participate in seminars.
   Gun Lannergren, who has directed the processions at the Grand
Hotel for 15 years, said the laureates always are told in advance
about the 7 a.m. Lucia Day wakeup calls. With the laureates'
agreement, young music students are given keys to enter their rooms
and awaken them with song.
   ``The girls go from room to room and sometimes the laureates
join the procession in their pajamas to hear the girls sing once
again,'' said Lannergren.
   Traditionally, only Nobel Prize winners have enjoyed the private
spectacle. Other hotel clients can enjoy the singing later in the
morning when 20-25 young women perform a brief concert in a
separate room at the hotel.
   Swedish children sing for their parents on Lucia morning before
going to school to participate in choir performances. Young women
go about with strands of tinsel in their hair. Cookies, saffron
bread and mulled wine are consumed at impromptu parties.
   The popular Neapolitan song, ``Santa Lucia'' is always sung.
It's about the oldest part of Italy's Naples, the Santa Lucia
quarter which was named after the saint.
   Lucia is considered the patron saint of Syracuse and the
patroness of eyes. She is frequently shown with two eyes in a dish,
a possible reference to her martyrdom. The name Lucia comes from
the Latin word for light.
   The first accounts of Lucia celebrations in Sweden date to the
17th century.
   In the old medieval calendar the ``Lussi'' night between Dec.
12-13 was the longest night of the year and associated with
mysterious happenings. Country folk believed all children should be
christened before Lucia or the devil could take them from their
parents.

   Saddam Hussein has dismissed his aging
defense minister and replaced him with a battle-hardened commander
who was a hero of the war with Iran, Iraq's official media reported
Wedneday.
   It was the second major shuffle in Iraq's high command in a
month.
   Baghdad Radio, quoting a presidential decree, said the
70-year-old defense minister, Gen. Abdel-Jabbar Khalil Shanshal,
was retiring because of his age. He held the post for just over a
year.
   The radio said the new defense minister is Maj. Gen. Saadi Tuma
Abbas, the inspector-general of the armed forces and a former
deputy chief of staff.
   Abbas, who is in his fifties, was a hero of the 1980-88 war with
Iran. He commanded the defense of Basra against the Iranians, whose
attacking armies came within a few miles of the southern port city.
   He was the strategist behind the formidable defensive lines
built to protect Basra from Iranian ``human wave'' assaults. The
Iraqis, who have an estimated 450,000 troops in and around Kuwait,
have built similar fortifications around Kuwait.
   Abbas later commanded troops involved in heavy fighting with the
Iranians in the southern Iraq theater, the main battleground in
that conflict.
   Shanshal's dismissal comes just over a month before the U.N.
Security council's Jan. 15 deadline for him to quit Kuwait or face
a possible military assault.
   Some analysts said that by appointing Abbas, Saddam was
underscoring readiness to go to war.
   U.S. officials have reported a steady buildup of Iraqi forces in
Kuwait and southern Iraq in recent weeks. They estimate there are
now more than 500,000 troops, half Saddam's army, in the Kuwait
theater.
   By mid-January, the Iraqis will face a 650,000-strong U.S.-led
multinational force with formidable firepower in the region.
   The official Iraqi News Agency, monitored in Cyprus, quoted
Saddam as telling Shanshal in a letter that it had been agreed
earlier that ``your assumption of this post would not exceed two
years and would not be less than one year.''
   Shanshal was named a minister of state for military affairs, the
post he held before he was appointed defense minister. Analysts
said the post carries no authority or influence.
   ``It may be that Shanshal supported negotiations and supported a
position that represented too much of an adjustment in Saddam's
attitude for him to be able to accept,'' said Don Kerr, an analyst
with London's International Institute for Strategic Studies.
   ``The implication is that he's making sure that all those
involved in military decision-making will toe the line,'' said Paul
Rogers, a defense analyst at England's Bradford University and an
expert of Middle East military affairs.
   Appointing an officer of Abbas' caliber ``could mean that Saddam
is less than ready to compromise'' on Kuwait, Rogers said in a
telephone interview.
   Saddam dismissed his chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Nazir al-Khazraji,
Nov.8 in a surprise shuffle.
   Analysts said at the time it indicated dissent within the upper
echelons of the army over the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait and the
risk of a showdown with the U.S.-led multinational force.
   U.S. officials said Khazraji, who had been one of Saddam's inner
circle of military advisers, was apparently sacked for opposing
Saddam's strategy.
   Syrian newspapers and Arab sources later reported that Khazraji
and seven other senior officers were executed. But there was no
independent confirmation of that and no official word in Baghdad.
   Khazraji was replaced by Gen. Hussein Rashid, deputy chief of
staff for operations and commander of the elite Republican Guards
divisions.
   He is a hard-liner and comes from Takrit, Saddam's hometown
north of Baghdad. The Iraqi leader has filled key positions with
relatives and others from Takrit.

   Jewish settlements in the occupied territories
``are growing and blossoming'' and their population has increased
to 100,000 despite the Palestinian uprising, Defense Minister Moshe
Arens said Wednesday.
   President Bush is an outspoken opponent of Israeli settlement
building in the lands captured in the 1967 Middle East war. He
considers these enclaves to be a major obstacle to peace efforts.
   Arens spoke in an Israel radio interview hours after his
motorcade was stoned in the West Bank town of Jericho, shattering a
window of the lead escort vehicle, Israeli reports said. Arens' car
was not hit.
   In other developments Wednesday:
   -A teen-age Palestinian girl was shot to death in the occupied
West Bank when soldiers fired at Arab students throwing stones at
Israeli cars, Arab and Israeli reports said.
   -The government barred prominent Palestinian activist Sari
Nusseibeh of east Jerusalem from leaving the country for three
months, noting unspecified security reasons, Israel TV reported.
Nusseibeh has been mentioned in the past as a prospective peace
negotiator. Israel has accused him of playing a leadership role in
the 3-year-old uprising.
   Arens said, ``Today there are 100,000 Jews in Judea and
Samaria,'' using biblical names for the West Bank. He said this was
higher than before the uprising began, without giving further
figures.
   Previous estimates said about 70,000 Jews lived in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip.
   Settlement activity, Arens said, ``isn't being stopped by the
intefadeh,'' the Arabic word for uprising. ``To the contrary it is
blossoming ... and growing.''
   The United States has conditioned $400 million in loans to build
housing for Soviet immigrants on the homes not being built in the
occupied territories.
   In Wednesday's fatal clash, about 200 students from the Arab
village of Biddiya stoned Israeli cars on a highway in a protest
marking the anniversary of the founding of a radical PLO faction,
Arab reports said.
   Soldiers fired and one bullet struck Ahlam Abed in the head,
killing her, the reports added.
   Arab reports listed her age as 13, and said Jewish settlers also
fired guns during the confrontation. Israeli radio stations and TV
said she was 16.
   The army said it was investigating.
   It brought to 778 the number of Palestinians killed by Israelis
in the uprising. Fifty-four Israelis also have died. At least 316
other Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs, most on
suspicion of helping Israel.
   At least eight other Palestinians were wounded and two soldiers
injured by rocks in scattered clashes Wednesday in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip, reports said.
   Troops sealed the homes of three Palestinians suspected of
involvement in killing two suspected informers and firing at an
army patrol in Rafah in the Gaza Strip, the army said.

   About 3,500 Americans were trapped by
Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, but most of those wanting to leave had
already made their way out by the time Saddam Hussein agreed last
week to free all foreigners.
   By Wednesday, four days after the mass releases of Westerners
began under Saddam's decree, the State Department said only a few
Americans were known to be awaiting evacuation from Iraq.
   The final American chartered flight is scheduled to leave early
Thursday, with about 15 Americans from Iraq expected aboard,
including the last remaining captive who served as a ``human
shield'' at a strategic site, U.S. officials said.
   Since Iraq invaded Kuwait, the U.S. government has evacuated
2,520 American citizens and their family members on 13 chartered
flights, the department said.
   About 510 American citizens, most of them children with dual
citizenship, have opted to remain in Kuwait and Iraq, Boucher said.
   Iraq sealed its borders Aug. 9, a week after its lightning
takeover of Kuwait. The border closing came the same day the first
American troops landed in Saudi Arabia to defend the kingdom
against any further Iraqi aggression.
   In the early days of the crisis, an undetermined number of
Americans managed to escape, many by driving across the the desert
to remote border crossings.
   Early on, foreign governments were reluctant to refer to the
trapped foreigners as hostages, fearing that would inflame the
situation at a time when their release might still be arranged.
   But Iraqi troops began rounding up Westerners, and it became
clear that Saddam intended to try to use them to force concessions
from Western governments forming a coalition against him.
   On Aug. 20, fears for the safety of trapped Westerners were
heightened when Iraq said some of the captives were being scattered
at strategic sites around the country to serve as ``human shields''
against attack.
   The first large group of Americans allowed to leave consisted of
52 wives and children of diplomats at the American embassy in
Kuwait. They were permitted to cross overland into Turkey on Aug.
26, but were forced to leave husbands and fathers behind.
   On Aug. 28, denounced by governments around the world for his
hostage-holding, Saddam said all foreign women and children would
be free to leave. U.S. officials chartered flights to ferry them
out.
   The first U.S.-chartered jet to evacuate Americans and other
Westerners left Baghdad on Sept 1. for London and Washington.
   By the time the tenth American charter left on Nov. 18, U.S.
diplomats estimated 2,300 to 2,400 Americans had managed to leave
Iraq and Kuwait.
   After the series of U.S.-chartered flights, Americans continued
to trickle out of Iraq. Some got out on regularly scheduled flights
to Jordan, others departed on planes chartered by other governments
and still others on flights arranged by various dignitaries who
traveled to Iraq to bargain for hostages.
   The private hostage-freeing missions caused some dissent within
the anti-Iraq alliance. The U.S. government saw Saddam's piecemeal
release of the hostages as a bid to divide the coalition.
   On. Nov. 18, Iraq offered to release all the hostages in batches
over a three-month period extending from Christmas to March 25 if
nothing happened to ``mar the atmosphere of peace.'' That was seen
by U.S. officials as an effort by Saddam to drag out the process
during a likely time frame for any attack.
   Saddam also said hostages' relatives could come for
Christmastime visits, and suggested that those who traveled to Iraq
might be allowed to bring loved ones home with them. That prompted
some relatives to make the trip to Baghdad, against State
Department advice.
   Last Thursday, with the numbers of hostages dwindling daily,
Saddam decided to release all foreigners. His rubber-stamp
parliament endorsed the decision on Friday.
   Former U.S. Treasury Secretary John Connally flew out of Iraq
last Saturday with 21 former American hostages. They were the first
to leave in the wake of Saddam's decision, although their release
was arranged prior to it.
   On Sunday, the evacuation began in earnest. A U.S.-chartered
Iraqi Airways jet took 174 Americans and 149 other Westerners to
Frankfurt. Fourteen other Americans left Baghdad on Tuesday on a
British charter to London and on an American charter to Frankfurt.

   President Bush today announced plans to meet
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in Moscow Feb. 11-13 , and
said he hopes the two will be able to sign a treaty slashing
long-range nuclear weapons.
   Bush also said he was making the Soviets eligible for credits
totaling $1 billion to buy U.S. agricultural products ranging from
grain to cheese.
   ``The Soviet Union faces tough times,'' Bush said at a Rose
Garden appearance also attended by Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
A. Shevardnadze and Secretary of State James A. Baker III.
   The twin announcements provided a fresh reminder of how much
U.S.-Soviet relations have progressed in a few years - from grim
superpower rivals to partners in the effort to force Iraq's
withdrawal from Kuwait and negotiate reductions in nuclear weapons.
   Shevardnadze hailed Bush's comments as a ``very important
statement'' and said he looked forward to seeing Bush and Gorbachev
sign the arms control treaty, which has been years in negotiations.
   He said he also looked forward to agreements covering trade,
science, technology and investments.
   The arms control treaty would reduce the most powerful and
dangerous nuclear weapons in both countries arsenals by about 30
percent.
   Bush granted the Soviets a temporary waiver of legislation that
has linked expanded U.S.-Soviet trade to liberalized Soviet
immigration policy.
   Bush said he welcomed the ``generally excellent progress'' of
the past year during which the Soviets have permitted tens of
thousands of Jews to emigrate to Israel.
   But he added, ``I still look forward to the passage of a Soviet
immigration law.''
   Bush departed the Rose Garden without taking questions from
reporters.
   Baker told reporters that some highly technical issues remain to
be settled before the arms control treaty can be signed. But he
expressed hope the obstacles could be cleared in time for the
February summit.
   Baker and Shevardnadze met Monday and Tuesday in Houston to
discuss the arms treaty, food aid and other issues affecting their
two countries.
   The two nations have already begun to eliminate short- and
medium-range nuclear weapons, and a treaty slashing non-nuclear
forces in Europe was signed at a ceremony last month in Paris.
   Baker said the main issues still to be resolved on a long-range
treaty involve verification.
   A February Bush-Gorbachev summit would be the fifth meeting
between the two presidents in a little more than a year. The two
men held their first summit last December in Malta, and have since
met in Washington, Helsinki and Paris.
   Bush met with his Cabinet earlier today to put the finishing
touches on the aid package.
   Shevardnadze said he knew that it was not easy for the president
to waive the legislation. ``I'm sure everyone in the Soviet Union
will welcome and appreciate that decision,'' he said.

   The prospect of someone feasting high on
the hog - the Vietnamese potbellied variety that some people keep
as pets - had one pig owner squealing.
   Three of the miniature porkers were to be among the menagerie in
the Biosphere II project, scheduled to begin in March. There was a
possibility that one of the critters might become dinner for the
closed environment's human tenants.
   ``They're domestic pets; they've never been raised or used for
food in this country,'' said Ingrid Henze, 32, of Los Angeles, a
pig owner who protested.
   Fear not: Their ribs have been spared.
   The portly potbellied porcus has been removed from the larder.
The Ossabaw swine, a feral pygmy breed found in Georgia, will
forage in its stead.
   The pigs were to join about 3,800 other plant and animal species
and a crew of four men and four women in March on a two-year stay
in a 3-acre, sealed compound like a giant greenhouse.
   The Biosphere's areas of desert, ocean, marshes, savannah and
rain forest make it the most comprehensive effort to duplicate
Earth's environment as a possible prototype for space living.
   Its environments, plus an intensive agriculture area and housing
for the humans, will be sealed and all air, water and wastes will
be recycled.
   Pigs are needed because they are extremely efficient recyclers,
capable of rapidly converting to fertilizer roughages such as the
stems of broccoli plants that other animals will not touch.
   ``Sort of like a quick compost machine,'' said Biosphere
spokeswoman Kathleen Dyhr.
   And in a closed environment, smallness counts.
   Potbellied pigs weigh 50 to 150 pounds, about the size of the
Georgia pig. Some varieties of swine raised for food weigh up to
1,000 pounds.
   A proposal to substitute the Georgia pig as more appropriate for
the Biosphere's needs had been under review for about the last nine
months, ``independently of the pig people,'' Ms. Dyhr said.
   She said Biosphere II received four or five complaints, but she
declined to say if they caused the switch. She noted that several
animal species, including types of deer, chicken and goat, have
been changed during the planning.
   And in any case, said Kayla Mull, ``these are not good pork
chops. These are lard-hogs. They make fat.'' Mrs. Mull has bred
potbellied pigs since 1985 through Creatures of Comfort in Norco,
near Los Angeles.
   The wild Georgia pigs, accustomed to the warm and humid climate
in Biosphere II, also will be more adaptable to eating greens, Ms.
Dyhr said. Their role as ham will be secondary, though they are
more suitable for meat production than the potbellied pigs, she
added.
   Another factor against the potbellied variety, Ms. Dyhr said,
was that they're expensive.
   Their popularity as pets means a healthy neutered male, tamed
and vaccinated, can cost $1,500 to $2,500, and breeding stock at
least $5,000, said Kiyoko Hancock. She operates the International
Gold Star Registry Service, publishes Pig Tale Times and breeds
potbellied pigs in Pescadero, Calif., south of San Francisco.
   The pets, also known as Chinese potbellied pigs, are indigenous
to Southeast Asia. Mrs. Hancock said virtually all the animals in
the United States stem from potbellieds sent from Vietnam to the
East Berlin Zoo in the 1950s. Twelve sows and four boars were
imported from Germany into Canada around 1985, with offspring
brought into this country, she said.
   Mrs. Mull put the potbellied pig population at between 6,000 and
10,000, ``multiplying like mice.''
   Ms. Henze and her boyfriend have had their porcine pal, named
Forbes, for more than a year. She had wanted a pet ``more
sophisticated and interesting than a dog,'' without smell, barking,
shedding or fleas.
   ``And we've never been happier,'' she said. ``He's small, he's
clean, he's quiet. He's basically a housepig, he's housebroken,
he's a very sophisticated, intelligent animal, very interesting.''
   Said Mrs. Mull: ``Visualize a dog that never smells bad, never
has to have a bath, that will sleep on the bed all night without
waking you up barking at the sound of a fire engine.''

   Here is the text of President Bush's remarks
Wednesday on aid to the Soviet Union and plans for a Feb. 11-13
summit in Moscow to sign a Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or
START.
   
   I have just had an opportunity to discuss with Foreign Minister
(Eduard) Shevardnadze a number of issues of U.S.-Soviet relations,
including cooperation in the (Persian) Gulf, and I'm pleased with
the great progress we've made on START and hopeful that we'll be
ready to sign a treaty at a summit in Moscow on Feb. 11 through 13.
   We also talked at length about the situation in the Soviet Union
and the response of the United States to the economic problems
there. I asked Minister Shevardnadze to convey to President
(Mikhail) Gorbachev my desire to respond both to the short-term
needs of the Soviet Union and to contribute to fundamental economic
reform. I've long supported perestroika and continue to.
   We discussed frankly the relationship of economic change in the
Soviet Union to the critical task of democratization and I
reiterated our strong desire to see both political and economic
reform continue because they are inextricably linked. I outlined
specific and important steps that we're willing to take in support
of reform, and after consulting closely with Secretary (of
Agriculture Clayton) Yeutter as well as Secretaries (Nicholas)
Brady (of Treasury) and (James A.) Baker (of State), I told
Minister Shevardnadze that I am prepared to respond to a Soviet
request for credit guarantees for purchase of agricultural
commodities through a waiver of the Jackson-Vanik amendment. While
I've taken this step, I still look forward to a passage of the
Soviet immigration law codifying the generally excellent practices
of the past year. And this then will permit us to make further
progress toward the normalization of the U.S.-Soviet economic
relationship.
   In addition, we have proposed to the Soviets a special technical
assistance project to help in assessing their food distribution
problem and to support market reforms.
   I will also authorize a joint public-private medical assistance
effort to help the Soviet Union cope with immediate shortages of
pharmaceuticals and basic medical supplies.
   In the longer term, only steps that the Soviet Union itself
takes can assure the economic health there. Thus to promote
fundamental economic reform, I will propose that the World Bank and
the IMF (International Monetary Fund) work out with the Soviet
Union a special association to give the USSR access to the
considerable financial and economic expertise of those
institutions.
   I have asked Secretary of the Treasury Nick Brady, as U.S.
governor of both institutions, to pursue this proposal with them
and also without other allies, whom I'm sure will be in accord.
   As I've said before, I want perestroika to succeed. The Soviet
Union is facing tough times, difficult times. But I believe that
this is a good reason to act now in order to help the Soviet Union
stay the course of democratization and to undertake market reforms.
The United States has an interest in a Soviet Union able to play a
role as a full and prosperous member of the international community
of states. And I'm hopeful that these initiatives will further that
goal.

<HEAD>Five Napa Wines, One From Washington State, Make World's Best List</HEAD>

   California wines outnumbered French
varieties for the first time in a magazine ranking of the world's
top 10.
   Five wines from California and one from Washington state were
among the best on the list of the 100 greatest wines ranked by
quality and price by Wine Spectator.
   The magazine has compiled the list for three years. Two Napa
Valley wine topped the list, which was released Tuesday. The other
California wines and the Washington wine were in the top 10.
   Beringer Cabernet Sauvignon Napa Valley Private Reserve 1986,
$30, was No. 1, followed by the $50 Caymus Cabernet Sauvignon Napa
Valley Special Selection 1985.
   Other Napa Valley wines in the top 10 were: $60 Heitz Cabernet
Sauvignon Napa Valley, Martha's Vineyard 1985, No. 5; $68 Opus One
Napa Valley 1987, No. 6, and $36 Spottswoode Cabernet Sauvignon
Napa Valley, 1987, No. 9.
   It was the first time a Washington state wine broke into the top
10. Woodward Canyon Cabernet Sauvignon Columbia Valley, at $18.50,
was in 10th place.
   The Wine Spectator put two French wines among the top 10.
Chartron et Trebuchet Chassagne-Montrachet Les Morgeots 1988, $34,
was ranked third, and Daniel Rion Nuits-St.-Georges Les Vignes
Rondes 1987, $35, was in seventh place.
   Italy's $36 Poggio Antico Brunello di Montalcino 1985 was ranked
fourth, and Germany's $24 Joh. Jos. Prum Riesling Spatlese Wehlener
Sonnenuhr (Cask 2) 1988, took eighth place.
   The top 100 included 44 California wines, 24 French wines, 15
from Italy, 5 from Spain, 4 from Washington State, 3 from Germany,
2 from Oregon, 2 from Australia and 1 from New Zealand.
   Two of the judges are from San Francisco, two from New York and
two from Europe. The tastings are blind, but when wines are judged
to be comparable in quality, the least expensive one gets the nod.
   U.S. wines had an advantage this year, with the franc rising 20
percent against the dollar.
   Harvey Shanken, the Wine Spectator's editor and publisher, said
that while price might make a difference, quality is the most
important ingredient.
   He noted that 1987 was not a great year for French wines and
this is the first year that vintage reached the market.

<HEAD>Investigators Say Hatch Failed on Fatal Plane</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Investigators found a broken emergency release in
the tail of a Northwest Airlines DC-9 in which eight people died
after it collided with another plane on a runway, federal officials
said Wednesday.
   A flight attendant and a passenger tried to escape through the
hatch, but the two died after the release jammed and trapped them
inside, The Detroit News reported Wednesday, citing an unidentified
source.
   A Boeing 727 was racing toward takeoff at Detroit Metropolitan
Airport on Dec. 3 when it struck the taxiing DC-9, which had turned
in front of it. The Northwest 727's right wing clipped the DC-9
behind the co-pilot's seat and knocked an engine off the DC-9. The
ensuing fire moved quickly through the DC-9, which had 39
passengers and four crew members aboard.
   The 145 passengers and eight crew on the 727 escaped injury.
   ``Investigators have found, after extensive testing, that the
interior tail cone release mechanism failed to separate the tail
cone and deploy the emergency slide,'' National Transportation
Safety Board member John Lauber said.
   ``The interior release handle was found partially raised from
its stowed position during the safety board's initial examination.
Investigators inspected the interior release handle and have found
the stem of the handle broken.''
   The source told the newspaper that investigators determined the
flight attendant and the passenger made it through one emergency
hatch to a catwalk in the plane's tail cone, and one of them pulled
a red handle designed to pop off the tail cone and release a slide.
   Alan Pollock, an NTSB spokesman, said the board was only
reporting the broken handle, and wouldn't speculate on whether the
flight attendant or passenger had pulled it. ``We can't get into
that kind of analysis at this time,'' he said.
   ``The NTSB did not interpret the findings, and neither can
Northwest,'' the airline said in a statement. Spokesman Doug Miller
said airline officials wouldn't elaborate.
   The airline checked the tail-cone release mechanisms on its 139
DC-9s Sunday night and Monday, said spokesman Bob Gibbons from
Northwest headquarters in Eagan, Minn.
   The unidentified investigator told the News the bodies of flight
attendant Heidi Joost, 43, of Dearborn, and Kingsley Brown, 30, of
Pittsburgh, were found a few feet from the tail cone release lever.
   Autopsies showed Joost died of soot and smoke inhalation, and
Brown died of head injuries along with soot and smoke inhalation.
   Christy Clapp, a Northwest spokeswoman, said the red handle in
the tail cone section pulls cables that release four latches
holding the cone.
   The cone is spring-loaded and designed to pop away from the
aircraft, Clapp said. She said an inflatable slide automatically
deploys from the tail hatch, 5 feet above the ground, allowing
people to escape.
   Cheri Quinn, an off-duty Northwest flight attendant who was on
the DC-9, said a similar chute at the plane's left front exit
failed to open and passengers were forced to jump or were lowered
to the ground. The chute at the front right side of the plane
opened properly.

   A heartstopping lurch shattered windows and
plunged the cars into darkness as train lights went out. Then the
passengers had to make their way above ground through thick, gritty
smoke from a diesel fire.
   Others were trapped below ground and had to wait for crews to
pull them from the wreckage.
   It was a commuter nightmare come to life Wednesday when an
Amtrak train derailed and smashed into a Massachusetts Bay
Transportation Authority train at a Back Bay station, injuring 264
people.
   Jeffrey Weitzenkorn, who travels daily on the train from his
hometown of Stoughton, had been reading the newspaper and was
getting ready to move out of his chair when the Amtrak train hit.
   ``There was a big bang and I got thrown to the floor. I went
into a fetal position to protect myself,'' said Weitzenkorn, who
suffered bruises on his face, lost his glasses and hurt his knee.
   Joe Povoas, a passenger on the commuter train, said that
immediately after the crash one fellow passenger said: ``Let's
everybody keep calm and go out of the exits calmly.''
   People filed out the open car doors, and began groping for an
exit through the smoke.
   ``You just don't have a concept of when you're going to get
fresh air,'' said Povoas, 35, who has used the train for seven
years.
   Finally, passengers found stairs leading out of the station.
``It was like a chimney. The smoke was just flowing up the
stairway,'' he said.
   Lt. Mike Walsh, a firefighter who arrived at the scene two
minutes after the first alarm, said there were no signs of panic.
   ``There was an eerie calm,'' said Walsh, whose face was black
with soot.
   Walsh, like other firefighters, said he gave his oxygen mask
away to victims. ``I don't even know where it is now,'' he said.
   Fire Lt. Jack Joyce brought breathing equipment for two Amtrak
engineers, and waited with them for more help to arrive while other
firefighters kept flames at bay outside the car. ``They were
totally dazed and completely out of it,'' Joyce said, adding that
they suffered head injuries.
   The trains were so mangled that Joyce said he had no idea what
part of the train the engineers were trapped in. ``All we were
doing was crawling into holes,'' he said.
   At the point of impact, the trains were indistinguishable from
one another, smashed and twisted together ``like a coathanger,''
Walsh said.
   The crash took out concrete and steel support columns in the
train tunnel, and buckled the road above. One set of railroad
tracks was tangled and pushed several feet up against a wall. A
diesel leak left the station smelling like a fuel tank.
   One car was carrying mail, and diesel-soaked Christmas catalogs
were strewn around the site of the crash.

   The Food and Drug Administration said
Wednesday it will soon impose minimum quality standards for medical
gloves worn by health care workers to protect themselves agaist
AIDS and other diseases.
   The federal Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta recommends
that physicians, dentists and other health care workers wear
protective rubber or plastic gloves.
   Under current FDA regulations, manufacturers of medical gloves
conduct their own testing. The FDA had no standard it could
enforce.
   New regulations, published in Wednesday's Federal Register and
scheduled to go into effect in 90 days, will standardize the
testing and define the failure rates, the agency said.
   It said gloves that do not meet the standards will be seized if
necessary to keep them off the market.
   As part of the new testing, the agency said randomly selected
samples of gloves will be examined for tears, holes and any foreign
matter embedded in the gloves. The gloves will also be filled with
about a quart of water and checked for leaks.
   Sale for medical uses will be forbidden for batches of gloves if
leaks are found in more than 25 per 1,000 for surgeons' gloves and
40 per 1,000 for patient-examination gloves. Surgeons' gloves were
given a stricter standard because they are in contact with a
patient's blood and other bodily fluids for a longer period of time
than those used in examining patients.
   The Centers for Disease Control knows of 20 published cases in
which a health care worker has been infected with the AIDS virus on
the job.
   Most of these were believed to have been accidental needle
pricks, but at least four were believed to have been infected when
chapped or scratched skin was exposed to the virus.

   Big time, big city customers are paying big
bucks for used clothes broken in by real Montana cowboys.
   A Montana native who's lived in New York City for 30 years says
customers at his Whiskey Dust store pay $65 for ``Montana Broke''
jeans.
   ``Two years ago I decided I wanted to try out the Montana look
in New York and it's really taken off,'' Mervin Bendewald said in a
telephone interview Tuesday. ``People don't want to wear new boots
or jeans and look like a dude. They want them broken in. ... It's a
certain look you can't manufacture.''
   Bendewald has scouts in Montana, including some of his 26 nieces
and nephews, who track down used cowboy clothes. He gets his
Montana Broke jeans from Judy McFarlane, who sells the brand from
her office in another Manhattan - a tiny town in southwestern
Montana, about 15 miles west of Bozeman.
   McFarlane began her end of the business about a year ago, when
she joked to a friend that Easterners were so enamored with Montana
that she could even sell them used jeans.
   Every pair that wears her Montana Broke label has been worn, and
often worn out, by a Montana bronc rider, roper, rancher or farm
hand, she said.
   So far she has sold 160 pairs of Montana Brokes to Whiskey Dust
and a store in San Francisco. Each comes with a sepia-toned label
offering information about the cowboy who wore the pants.
   All the labels come with this advice: ``In the spirit of our Big
Sky cowboys, talk quiet, ride tall and wear your jeans with
pride.''
   There are a few problems, of course. Most real cowboys are not
built like most real New Yorkers.
   McFarlane said the typical cowboy is a 30-slim. Most New Yorkers
are not.
   ``I try to find pants from steer wrestlers,'' she said.
``Generally, they're brawnier.''

   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) - The self-proclaimed head of the
Tonton Macoute militia vowed on Wednesday to prevent a leftist
Roman Catholic priest from becoming Haiti's president.
   Haiti's first democratic national elections since independence
are scheduled for Sunday. The Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who is
adored by the Caribbean country's impoverished masses, is widely
viewed as the front-runner.
   The 37-year-old Aristide, who was ousted from his order for
political activism, was denounced by Tonton Macoute chief Roger
Lafontant, who called him a menace and an ``ultra-Communist.''
   ``We will do everything to prevent this danger. My country will
never be delivered to Communism,'' said Lafontant, who himself was
barred from contesting the election.
   Aristide is an advocate of Liberation Theology, which holds that
the Roman Catholic church should help the poor better their lives
through political action.
   Lafontant said he was not calling for violence by his forces,
but said ``there is always something bad that can happen.''
   ``We will do our best to prevent it,'' he said.
   Aristide, advised of the remarks, said, ``Lafontant has a right
to say whatever he wants.'' But, he said: ``The law has to be
followed.''
   Lafontant told reporters he would ask the police and army to
increase security for the balloting. More than 600 international
observers, including former President Jimmy Carter and
representatives from the United Nations and Organization of
American States, will monitor the vote.
   Lafontant, who was one of 11 candidates disqualified from
participating in the election for technical reasons by the
independent Electoral Board, fled Haiti after the overthrow of
Jean-Claude ``Baby Doc'' Duvalier.
   Lafontant returned to Haiti in July to run for president. A
warrant for his arrest accusing him of crimes committed during the
Duvalier years has never been served.
   Lafontant, speaking to reporters at the fortress-like
headquarters of his Union for National Reconciliation Party, said
he was ``proud'' to be chief of the militia that violently enforced
the Duvalier dictatorship for 29 years.
   ``I am leading the Duvalierists. I'm the chief. I'll never deny
I'm a Duvalierist,'' he said.
   Lafontant blamed Aristide for last week's grenade and gun attack
that killed seven people and wounded 50 others as an Aristide
campaign rally was breaking up.
   Aristide blamed the attack on Lafontant and urged the army to
arrest him.
   ``He should be on trial,'' Aristide told reporters.
   But Lafontant boasted: ``No one can arrest me.''
   The capital of Port-au-Prince was calm Wednesday, although many
city residents were heading for the interior to avoid possible
violence during the elections.
   At least 34 voters were killed at the polls in Port-au-Prince by
army-backed thugs during the 1987 elections. The Electoral Council
was pushed aside by the army, which controlled the national
elections in January of 1988.
   Haiti has been wracked by political violence since Jean-Claude
Duvalier's departure, which ended nearly three decades of a brutal
family reign begun by his father, Francois ``Papa Doc'' Duvalier.

<HEAD>Ol' Blue Eyes' 75th Birthday Celebrated at the `My Way Cafe'</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MALTA, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   There's nary a corer in the My Way Cafe
where your gaze won't meet Ol' Blue Eyes. Frank Sinatra is the
appetizer, main course and dessert at this roadside tavern and
mini-shrine to the entertainer, who turned 75 Wednesday.
   ``It didn't start out to be a shrine,'' owner, bartender and
chef John Bove said as he prepared for an evening birthday bash.
``I must put up 30 to 50 pieces of memorabilia a year.''
   Bove, 54, converted his two-story home 20 miles north of Albany
into the cafe seven years ago. He had sold his 150-seat Italian
restaurant in nearby Clifton Park and was looking for something a
little more intimate, something with a theme.
   He considered Marilyn Monroe and John Wayne before settling on
Sinatra.
   ``The place itself leaned toward being a roadhouse, and that's
where he (Sinatra) started out, playing in little places in New
Jersey. It just seemed to fit the bill,'' Bove said.
   Bove holds a combination My Way anniversary-Christmas-Sinatra
party every Dec. 12. The day has always been a big one for his
business. Bove expected several hundred people to celebrate Francis
Albert's 75th birthday their way.
   ``It's busy on his birthday every year, but this year it's been
crazy,'' Bove said.
   When he opened the restaurant in 1983, Bove had five Sinatra
album covers decorating the walls. He now has more than 100.
   Sinatra's image covers nearly all available wall space in Bove's
three-room establishment. Hundreds of album and magazine covers,
song sheets, movie posters, billboards and photographs chart
Sinatra's rise from his big band days with Harry James and Tommy
Dorsey to ``chairman of the board'' status in the entertainment
industry.
   A white paper silhouette of Sinatra's likeness, complete with
glowing blue eyes, hangs near the bar.
   Most of the items were given to him by friends, relatives and
customers.
   Two-thirds of the songs on the juke box are by Sinatra. When the
bar's stereo system is turned on, it plays nothing but Sinatra
tapes, said Bove, who has 96 Sinatra albums in his apartment above
the restaurant.
   Each dish Bove prepares is named for a Sinatra song. Diners can
start out with the ``Yesterday'' onion soup and ``New York, New
York'' chicken wings, work their way through the ``My Way'' prime
rib or ``Strangers In The Night'' baked manicotti and top it off
with ``The Nearness of You'' strawberry shortcake.
   The Sinatra motif and music create a mood that attracts people
from 23 to 83, mostly couples, Bove said. Their common bond is a
love of Sinatra and his music. Most don't care about Sinatra's
well-publicized run-ins with the press, the three divorces or the
reputed connections to organized crime, he said.
   ``When you go to see somebody, who really cares who he's with or
what he's doing, as long as he's up there entertaining people and
making them happy,'' Bove said.
   Bove has attended five Sinatra concerts, including one in Albany
earlier this year when he and his wife Beverly had fourth-row
seats. While she got close enough to touch the singer, Bove said he
wouldn't know what to say to Sinatra if he ever got the chance.
   ``But it would be a real pleasure to cook for him. That would
make me feel good,'' Bove said.

   John Gotti, whose acquittals gained him the
reputation of ``The Untouchable Don,'' was charged Wednesday with
ordering his Mafia boss slain so he could take over the nation's
most powerful mob organization.
   Gotti was charged in a federal racketeering indictment with
ordering four murders, including that of reputed Gambino crime
family head Paul Castellano and with conspiring to kill a fifth
person.
   The 11-count indictment also accused Gotti of gambling,
loansharking, obstruction of justice and tax evasion.
   Gotti was arrested Tuesday night, as were three other reputed
crime figures, including the son of the late Mafia Boss of Bosses
Carlo Gambino.
   Prosecutors called Gotti a danger to the community and said they
would seek to have him held without bail.
   If convicted, the man also known as ``the Dapper Don'' for his
expensive suits, would face life in prison without parole.
   Gotti pleaded innocent at his arraignment Wednesday. He was
ordered held without bail.
   Gotti and his two top associates - underboss Frank ``Frankie
Loc'' Locascio and adviser Salvatore ``Sammy Bull'' Gravano - were
arrested at Gotti's Manhattan hangout, the Ravenite Social Club in
Little Italy.
   Thomas Gambino, an alleged family ``capo'' or captain, was
picked up about the same time when he left the Garment District
office of his trucking company, said James M. Fox, head of the
FBI's New York office.
   Gambino, Locascio and Gravano also pleaded innocent. Gambino was
released Wednesday on a $500,000 personal recognizance bond.
Locascio and Gravano were jailed without bail. A hearing on
possible bail for Gotti and the two other defendants was set for
Monday.
   ``To my knowledge, this is the first time that we have taken
down the entire hierarchy of an organized-crime family - the boss,
the underboss, the consigliere (counselor),'' said Fox.
   Federal officials say Gotti took over the leadership of the
Gambino crime family with the Dec. 16, 1985, assassination of
Castellano on the street outside a Manhattan steak house. A
bodyguard also was killed.
   Law enforcers believe Castellano was shot by three gunmen -
Anthony Rampino, John Carneglia and Gotti's younger brother Gene, a
law-enforcement source said on the condition on anonymity. The
three, who have not been charged in the slaying, are in jail on
unrelated charges.
   Gotti, who allegedly headed a crew of Gambino ``soldiers,''
reportedly had Castellano gunned down because of ``Big Paul's''
rule that any member or associate of the Gambino family who was
found to be involved in narcotics trafficking would be murdered.
   At the time of the killing, Castellano himself was on trial on
racketeering charges.
   Law enforcement officials say the organization's sources of
income include drug dealing, gambling, extortion, loan sharking,
union control, airport rip-offs and domination of New York City's
garment district.
   Gotti's lawyer, Bruce Cutler, maintained his client was the
innocent victim of a prosecution vendetta.
   Gotti has beaten three government cases since 1986.
   ``It's the same kind of crap that we dealt with in 1986 and
1987. The same kind of Mafia madness, nonsense, that starts with a
two-week blitz in the newspapers. I know it's a vendetta. It's
happened three times. If that's not a vendetta, I don't know what
is,'' Cutler said.
   Cutler maintains the 50-year-old Gotti is a salesman for a
plumbing company and for a company that sells zippers and hangers
to the fashion industry.
   ``His real job is boss of the most powerful crime family in this
country. That's his real job and the real source of his income,''
said U.S. Attorney Andrew J. Maloney. ``He's a murderer, he's not a
folk hero.''
   Gotti has been indicted three times in recent years on a variety
of state and federal crimes, but prosecutors have been unable to
convict him.
   The previous state cases against Gotti were an assault in Queens
and an assault and conspiracy trial in Manhattan, neither of which
was considered a very strong case. The federal case was prepared
before Gotti's alleged ascension to mob boss, although the
acquittal came after the Castellano slaying.
   Maloney told reporters it would be different this time. He said
the evidence against Gotti includes eyewitnesses and secretly
recorded conversations between Gotti and his minions.
   Gotti, Locascio, 58, and Gravano, 45, each are charged under
federal racketeering statutes with murder, gambling, loansharking,
obstruction of justice and other crimes.
   Gambino, 61, is accused of gambling and loansharking.
   If convicted, Gravano also faces life imprisonment without
parole. Locascio faces up to 65 years and Gambino a maximum of 40
years.

<HEAD>Snow In Colorado And Minnesota</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Snow fell over parts of Minnesota and Colorado on Wednesday, but
otherwise only light precipitation was scatered over parts of the
West.
   A weak upper-level weather disturbance produced snow over
Colorado's ski resort country, with up to a foot of snow forecast
in the mountains of the state's southwestern corner. Some places
had 3 inches by midday.
   Colorado State Patrol officials said roads were icy and
snowpacked in the southern sections of the state, and adequate snow
tires or chains were required on Red Mountain and Wolf Creek
passes.
   The weather change followed on the heels of a heat wave. Earlier
this week, the Denver area had unseasonably warm weather with
temperatures hitting the high 60s, about 20 degrees above normal,
weather officials said.
   Another upper-level weather disturbance brought snow to northern
Minnesota from late Tuesday into Wednesday morning. North-central
sections of the state received 4 to 6 inches of snow.
   Elsewhere in the West, a few snow showers were over Wyoming and
eastern Montana.
   A few light showers were scattered over southern California and
southern Arizona, and southern Utah got a few rain and snow
showers.
   Light showers associated with a cold front also spread along the
northern Pacific Coast.
   Strong southwesterly wind prevailed ahead of a cold front in the
central part of the nation. Temperatures were in the 50s as far
north as lower Michigan at midday.
   Early afternoon temperatures were in the 20s and 30s in the
north central part of the country and in northern New England and
upstate New York. Caribou, Maine, had a morning low of 5 above
zero.
   Readings dipped below freezing in the plateau region and the
rocky mountain region.
   Overnight lows in the teens and single digits were reported in
parts of Oregon, Idaho and Montana, the National Weather Service
said.
   Wednesday's low for the Lower 48 states was zero at McCall,
Idaho.

<HEAD>Immunity Offered to Son of Suspended Navajo Chairman</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WINDOW ROCK, Ariz. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Prosecutors in the latest trial of
suspended Navajo Chairman Peter MacDonald and his co-defendant son
moved Wednesday to force the son to testify against his father.
   Special prosecutor Robert Rothstein submitted a motion to
dismiss the conspiracy charge against Peter ``Rocky'' MacDonald Jr.
and a separate motion that would require him to testify under
immunity.
   Opening statements were presented Tuesday in the trial of the
two on charges stemming from the tribe's 1987 purchase of the Big
Boquillas Ranch for $33.4 million hours after it had been sold to a
third party for $26.25 million.
   In another development Wednesday, tribal Judge Robert Yazzie
granted a prosecution motion and dismissed election-fraud charges
against suspended Vice Chairman Johnny Thompson in exchange for his
testimony against MacDonald in the Big Boquillas trial and an
upcoming one on election-fraud charges.
   In the Big Boquillas trial, the elder MacDonald is charged with
single counts of bribery, fraud and conspiracy and 10 ethics
violations. His son, an unemployed lawyer from San Jose, Calif.,
faces a single conspiracy count.
   After the motions aimed at the younger MacDonald, Yazzie granted
a continuance in the trial until Thursday in order to give defense
attorneys time to research immunity laws.
   MacDonald was suspended by the tribal council, now known as the
Navajo Nation Council, on Feb. 17, 1989, after a U.S. Senate
committee heard testimony from Rocky MacDonald and others that the
elder MacDonald accepted cash payments and other favors from people
doing business with the tribe.
   Thomas Hoidal, an assistant federal public defender who said he
has been appointed by the U.S. District Court in Phoenix to
represent Rocky MacDonald, appeared in tribal court and expressed
concerns as to whether testimony by his client in tribal court
could be used against him in federal court.
   Rothstein said Assistant U.S. Attorney Wallace Kleindieist has
agreed to present a letter saying his office will honor a tribal
court's grant of immunity and not use that testimony to prosecute
Rocky MacDonald in federal court.
   A federal grand jury in Phoenix has been investigating matters
related to the MacDonald administration, though neither MacDonald
nor his son have been charged in federal court.
   Asked later by a reporter whether Rocky MacDonald was prepared
to testify against his father, Hoidal replied: ``We'll see.''
   Other attorneys declined to comment.
   The MacDonalds were convicted on Oct. 17 in tribal court of
bribery, conspiracy and ethics violations. That trial involved
allegations that the elder MacDonald took bribes and kickbacks from
businessmen operating on the reservation.
   The elder MacDonald is also to stand trial Jan. 16 on election
fraud charges.
   Thompson had faced more than 60 counts in that case stemming
from the tribe's 1986 election.
   But, Thompson's legal advocate, Daniel Deschinny, said: ``He was
totally unaware of what was happening with the Big Boquillas Ranch
and the election of 1986.

<HEAD>Bush Administration Accuses Iraq of Blocking Talks</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Gulf Rdp, Bjt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration on Wednesday accused
Iraq of blocking any agreement to schedule talks more than a few
days before a U.N. deadline for withdrawing Iraqi troops from
Kuwait.
   Meanwhile, a U.S.-chartered plane was expected to leave Baghdad,
Iraq early Thursday with 15 Americans aboard, the last official
flight out for the foreseeable future. State Department spokesman
Richard Boucher said no decision had been made on whether five
American diplomats at the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait would be aboard.
   Boucher said the Iraqi government was refusing to budge from its
proposal to have Secretary of State James Baker III visit Baghdad
on Jan. 12.
   The United States has rejected that date, saying it is too close
to Jan. 15. The U.N. Security Council has voted to authorize force
if the Iraqis have not quit Kuwait by then.
   President Bush proposed a diplomatic exchange - including a
White House meeting with Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz - as a
last-ditch effort to find a peaceful solution to the gulf crisis,
and Iraq accepted the idea.
   However, Boucher said, ``We have offered 15 dates and Iraq has
offered none. ... Iraq continues to block agreement on dates.''
   Iraq has suggested that its foreign minister come to Washington
to see Bush on Dec. 17. Boucher said the United States would not
accept that date unless a date had been fixed for Baker's trip to
Iraq.
   Joseph Wilson, the U.S. charge d'affaires in Baghdad, has been
discussing dates with Nizar Hamdoon, Iraq's deputy foreign
minister, Boucher said. Hamdoon talked with Wilson most recently on
Wednesday by telephone.
   ``The Iraqis had no new proposals,'' Boucher said.
   Baker noted that ``We have said that we would be willing to go
to Baghdad for a meeting on any one of the 15 days between Dec. 20
and Jan. 3 because we think these meetings are important and
because we are serious about them.''
   Meantime, Boucher said no final decision had been made on
whether the five American diplomats at the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait
would leave on Thursday's flight.
   An estimated 15 evacuees from Baghdad were planning to be aboard
the plane, including one man who was held as a ``human shield'' at
a strategic site in Iraq.
   The Kuwait embassy staff will be allowed to leave when they have
determined finally that no Americans who want to get out of the
area are left, Boucher said.
   All told, about 188 Americans have been flown out of Iraq and
Kuwait the past few days, he said. They include 70 people who were
in hiding, 86 ``human shields'' held at strategic sites in Iraq and
32 private citizens who were at the U.S. embassies in Kuwait or
Iraq.
   Some 500 Americans - mostly children - apparently will stay. If
Americans want to leave Kuwait in the future, they will be able to
fly by commercial Iraqi carrier to Iraq and then on to Jordan,
Boucher said.
   The spokesman said the former hostages are providing information
to U.S. officials.
   ``We're obviously talking to the people coming out,'' he said.
``We've talked to them during the course of the trip and once they
get back here.''
   ``We're most interested in what they might know about other
Americans,'' he said.
   On Capitol Hill, a former Reagan administration official told
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that any war that breaks out
would be seen in the Middle East as a U.S. war against Iraq, and
added that the perception could be even worse.
   ``A number of Americans are concerned that we may end up in this
whole affair on the wrong side of history, defending emirs and
kings,'' said Richard Murphy, who was assistant secretary of state
for the Near East.
   Across the Capitol, a former Army chief of staff, Gen. Edward C.
Meyer,
   said that if Bush decides to give sanctions a year to 18 months
to work, a presidential mobilization of up to one million men and
women in the ready reserves would be necessary.
   ``You can't do it with active forces,'' agreed Rep. Les Aspin,
D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services Committee.

<HEAD>Soviet Commission Chosen to Crack Down on `Sleaze'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN FRIEDMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A commission has been chosen to enforce a
presidential order to crack down on pornography, the Soviet culture
minister said Wednesday, but he promised it won't be ``a new
Inquisition.''
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev this month ordered Culture
Minister Nikolai Gubenko to form the committee to ``protect public
morality'' from pornography.
   Gubenko said the committee consists of 30 people and includes
chiefs of creative unions, state committees, public organizations,
representatives of religious movements and prominent cultural
figures, the Tass news agency reported.
   He said it will begin work after its membership is completed
next week.
   In his order, Gorbachev cited public concern about the spread of
erotic photos and videos as well as pseudo-medical literature.
   Gorbachev's policy of glasnost, or openness, and a new law on
the press has virtually ended censorship, allowed democratic debate
to flower and let many new people into the publishing business. But
many Soviets find offensive some of the new private publishers'
choice of material.
   Soft-core ``erotica'' has been flourishing in the traditionally
puritan Soviet Union.
   Pinup-style posters and calendrs of naked women are sold openly
near the entrances of many Moscow subway stations, sometimes tacked
up in full view of commuters. Sex manuals are sold on city streets.
   Popular movies such as ``Little Vera'' and ``Interdevochka''
(Intergirl) have featured some nudity and explicit scenes, although
they were comparatively mild by Western standards. Soviet
television also broadcasts movies from other countries that are
somewhat more explicit than those shown on American TV.
   Tass headlined its story on the commission's meeting Wednesday,
``Soviet Union Prepares to Clamp Down on Sleaze.''
   Its report said the ``emancipation of public morals and the
freedom of commercial activities have had a negative impact on the
moral health of Soviet society.
   ``It is necessary to stop the squall of pornography,
pseudo-medical literature, erotic films and propaganda of violence
and cruelty.''
   The agency said the commission will study the experience of
countries such as Denmark, Sweden, France, the United States and
Germany in fighting pornography.
   ``In order to solve this problem, we won't resort to tough
measures, for instance, like in China,'' Tass quoted Gubenko as
saying. China this year launched a widespread campaign that meted
out harsh penalties for those convicted of disseminating
pornography.
   ``We have no plan to launch a new Inquisition here,'' he said.
   Gubenko told Soviet TV that commission priorities will be to
``work out mechanisms to regulate processes in the framework of
culturally traditional and religious coloring of various
territories of our country.''
   Asked if the commission will focus on barring certain materials,
Gubenko replied: ``Not at all, otherwise we would cut our own
throat as far as the freedom of information is concerned.''
   ``An adult person who has access to all kinds of information -
it's their personal affair,'' he said. ``We are talking about the
younger generation, which we must protect from the danger of
destroying its psyche.''
   Gubenko said the Soviet parliament and the president, not his
commission, probably would be the final authority.

   The remains of two servicemen who had been
listed as missing in action in Vietnam have been identified, the
Pentagon said Wednesday.
   The remains of Air Force Lt. Col. William R. Andrews and Navy
Lt. Cmdr. Frederick W. Wright III were among those of 20 others
repatriated by Vietnam in September. One other set of remains was
identified earlier.
   The Pentagon said the remains of Andrews and Wright would leave
Hickam Air Force Base in Hawaii with a full honors ceremony
Thursday and be flown to Travis Air Force Base in California.
   Andrews, of Eugene, Ore., was reported missing in action Oct. 5,
1966; Wright, of Haworth, N.J., on Nov. 10, 1972.

<TEXT>
   Young people see drugs as by far their
generation's No. 1 problem, and 77 percent favor random employee
drug testing in a national poll released Wednesday.
   The Gallup Organization asked people ages 16-24 what they think
is the biggest problem facing the youth of today, and 58 percent
named drugs. No other issue was named by more than 5 percent.
   When asked what is the biggest problem facing the United States
as a whole, the young people mentioned a variety. Among them were:
drugs, 23 percent; federal deficit or economy 16 percent; welfare,
poverty, homelessness, 9 percent; environment, pollution, 8
percent.
   Psychologist and author David Elkind said the results confirmed
what he had observed as a professor of child study at Tufts
University.
   ``Kids are very concerned about drugs and they're very concerned
about the world we live in today,'' he said. ``Kids no longer see
this idea of progress, that the world is getting better.''
   The young people were asked about problems such as illegal drug
use and the environment, and whether each had gotten better, stayed
about the same or gotten worse over the last five years.
   The predominant answer was ``worse'' - 73 percent felt the
country was losing ground on drugs, 72 percent on AIDS, 63 percent
on the environment. But 72 percent thought the United States had
gotten better or stayed the same in literacy.
   Fifty-three percent saw improvement toward world peace. But the
poll was conducted in June and July, before the Persian Gulf
crisis.
   The poll was commissioned by Fuji Photo Film U.S.A. Inc. and
included a marketing survey on the purchase of cassette tapes and
compact discs. In a related issue question, 64 percent said they
thought prerecorded music should have warning labels regarding the
lyrics.
   Gallup conducted the poll by phone, reaching 1,003 young people
in a random sample with a margin of error of just over 3 percentage
points in either direction.

<HEAD>Scrolls Editor's Dismissal Tied To Anti-Semitic Remarks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By AMY WESTFELDT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A Harvard divinity professor's anti-Semitic remarks in an
Israeli newspaper contributed to his dismissal as chief editor of
the Dead Sea Scrolls project, his colleagues said Wednesday.
   But others said John Strugnell was removed last week because of
longstanding problems managing the project's scholars, who still
haven't published up to 45 percent of the scrolls nearly four
decades after they were discovered.
   The scholars voted to dismiss Strugnell last week, one month
after appointing a co-editor to share his duties, said Eugene
Ulrich, a member of the editing team and a University of Notre Dame
theology professor.
   ``The main reason for the removal was his health,'' Ulrich said.
   But Ulrich acknowledged Wednesday that Strugnell's anti-Jewish
remarks in an interview with Haaretz, a Tel Aviv newspaper, ``all
the more confirmed that the decision was a correct one.''
   Strugnell, a Roman Catholic, was quoted in the interview as
saying: ``I think that Judaism is a racist religion. It is a
religion for a race, just like Hinduism. Something very primitive
... what I would call folklore.''
   He said Judaism was ``a folk religion. It's not a higher
religion.''
   He suggested that all Jews abandon their beliefs and convert to
Christianity.
   The interview, which appeared in Hebrew on Nov. 9 and will
appear next month in the English-language Biblical Archaeology
Review, also quotes Strugnell as saying of Judaism: ``It's a
horrible religion. It's a Christian heresy and we deal with our
heretics in different ways.''
   Asked if his views affected his work on the Scrolls, which trace
the evolution of modern Judaism, Strugnell said: ``I don't, when
I'm working on a Qumran (area where scrolls were found) text, think
how stupid and wrong the Jews were. I'm concerned with trying to
find out what a document is saying in its context.''
   Strugnell insisted he had nothing against Jews, saying ``I don't
love or hate Jews more than I love or hate anybody else.''
   The New York Times on Wednesday quoted Frank Moore Cross,
another Harvard scholar working on the scrolls, as saying the
interview ``certainly'' contributed to Strugnell's dismissal.
   Ulrich, who was appointed as one of three editors to replace
Strugnell, called the remarks ``highly and inflammatorily
anti-Semitic.''
   But Ulrich also said he doesn't believe Strugnell meant what he
said.
   ``I have known John for 20 years and I've never heard him say
anything like that,'' Ulrich said.
   Strugnell, 60, who has been editor since 1987, has been
unavailable for comment. Harvard spokesman Peter Costa said he was
in an unidentified hospital for treatment of an undisclosed
illness.
   Ulrich, however, said Strugnell told him Sunday ``he does not
see it as all over and done with.''
   The Dead Sea Scrolls were discovered by Bedouin shepherds in
1947 in a cave in what is now the Israeli-occupied West Bank. They
contain some of the earliest known biblical texts, including copies
of the Old Testament dating to the second and third century B.C.
They are kept at the Rockefeller Museum in Jerusalem.
   Scholars say the 800 scrolls shed light on the life of the
Essenes, an ancient sect of Jews, as well as the roots of early
Christianity.
   Strugnell has been criticized for the scholars' slow pace in
publishing the scrolls, some of which were found in fragments as
small as a dime.
   ``It's been very clear for awhile that John has not been moving
quickly enough,'' said New York University professor Larry
Schiffman, a Dead Sea Scrolls scholar who is not on the editing
team.
   Schiffman said Wednesday poor management was the real reason
behind Strugnell's dismissal, although the anti-Jewish remarks
didn't help.
   Hershel Shanks, editor of Biblical Archaeology Review, dismissed
the explanation that Strugnell was fired for health problems.
   ``You don't fire a man because he's ill,'' Shanks said. ``It's
because they don't want to be associated with an anti-Semite.''

<TEXT>
   A congressionally mandated study panel is
preparing to recommend nationwide testing of 3-year-olds and
6-year-olds, an Education Department official said Wednesday.
Critics said the tests might not be reliable or useful for the
younger children.
   The Special Study Panel on Education Indicators concluded two
days of meetings in Bethesda, Md. after developing a draft report,
said John Ralph, study director.
   The panel, formed a year ago to suggest to Congress how to
update indicators that are used to measure education quality,
operates within the National Center for Education Statistics, part
of the Education Department.
   The most controversial item under consideration by the 19-member
group is the proposal to assess a sampling of 6-year-olds to
determine how prepared they are to enter school and to assess
3-year-olds so educators can identify and measure things that put
them at risk of failure in school.
   The proposal was first reported by the trade publication,
Education Daily.
   The group will meet again early next year to refine its report
before submitting it to Congress in May.
   ``We're extremely concerned about the plan for a nationwide
assessment of 3-year-olds,'' said Barbara Willer of the National
Association for the Education of Young Children.
   The study group, she said, appears to be unaware of the problems
of testing young children. She said the items they want to assess
``are virtually impossible to assess, all of these are emerging
areas'' for testing in 3-year-olds, and ``to test them doesn't seem
to be a wise use of money.''
   Roy Truby, executive director of the governing board of the
National Assessment of Educational Progress, said, ``I don't know
of any real good assessments or valid tests for 3-year-olds that
can be given to large samples of students.''
   The sampling approach suggested by the study group is similar to
that used by the national assessment, popularly called ``the
Nation's Report Card'' because it measures what students know in
grades four, eight and 12 and what skills they possess.
   ``Society can undertake early preventive measures that minimize
the deficits these children might carry with them into their
subsequent educational experiences,'' said the study group's draft
report.
   The early testing can help determine ``the sources of
educational inequities near their roots, rather than after children
have already spent time in elementary school.''
   ``Separate information may also be useful for the subgroups of
children that differ in the number of parents living in the
household, maternal education levels, preschool-kindergarten
experiences, and geographic regions,'' said the report.
   It said testing of 3-year-olds and 6-year-olds must measure
reading and mathematics skills such as pattern recognition,
vocabulary, knowledge of concepts such as far and near and motor
skills, attitudes and social behavior.

   President Bush is gambling that a new treaty

Moscow in February for a summit meeting with Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   After eight years of negotiations and several crash efforts, the
treaty to slice long-range nuclear bombers, missilesand submarines
on both sides by about 30 percent remains elusive.
   Bush had made completion of the treaty a precondition for going
to Moscow. And yet he set Feb. 11-13 as the date to meet with
Gorbachev with the accord still incomplete.
   A senior U.S. official said the President had never ruled out
setting a date before the treaty was done. Asked if it would be
ready by the time he saw Gorbachev, the official, who insisted on
anonymity, said:
   ``Nobody can be certain. Things can always come up. The
assumption is we have made progress and are very hopeful we will
have a treaty to sign. There are no guarantees.''
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet Foreign
Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze tackled some of the remaining
issues at a two-day meeting in Houston that ended Tuesday night.
   ``We made some very good progress in Houston,'' Baker said
Wednesday. ``There are still some issues that remain.''
   They are mostly technical, Baker said. He singled out the
monitoring of solid rocket and missile assembly facilities.
   Others include a Soviet demand to inspect U.S. B-2 bomber plants
and how much information from missile flight tests will be
exchanged.
   In recent weeks some other nagging issues were resolved. These
include some kinds of restrictions to be imposed on Soviet SS-18
missile tests and leeway for the United States to divert some
Trident submarine technology to Britain.
   Even after all the problems are resolved it will take about
three weeks to put the provisions in treaty language - in English
and in Russian.
   Initially, Bush hoped the treaty would be ready by January.
   By scheduling the summit for February he not only leaves more
room for the details to be worked out. It also means the President
will not be in Moscow when the crisis in the Persian Gulf could
reach the boiling point.
   The U.N. Security Council, at the urging of the administration,
has set Jan. 15 as the deadline for Iraq to quit Kuwait or risk
war.
   Gorbachev has supported the resolution threatening force as well
as a trade embargo and other sanctions aimed at President Saddam
Hussein. And yet the Soviet leader has sought to stress seeking a
diplomatic way out of the dispute over Iraq's seizure of Kuwait.

   Forty-three of 53 pilot whales that
ran aground on a Cape Cod beach died, but scientists took solace
Wednesday from the few they managed to save.
   Eight of the whales that were discovered beached Tuesday on
Squaw Island peninsula were returned to the sea. Two were taken to
the New England Aquarium in Boston.
   Of 315 whales previously stranded on area beaches over the past
10 years, only three are known to have survived and successfully
returned to sea.
   Scientists began dissecting the carcasses of the dead whales
hauled to a secluded corner of the town dump but held out little
hope that they might explain the mysterious occasional tendency of
the whales to beach themselves.
   ``We're not really building toward the ultimate answer,'' said
Greg Early, associate curator for animal care at the New England
Aquarium and coordinator of the rescue effort.
   Blood from the 43 whales, many of which were put to death to end
their misery, will be checked for contamination that might have
caused the whales to become disoriented. Biologists said previous
examinations of beached whales have provided few clues.
   They theorize that whales may be disoriented by the gentle
slopes of sandy beaches, or by extreme high tides like those that
battered Cape Cod last week, or that diseased male guide whales
lead the rest to shore, or the whales, which are descended from
land-based creatures, may follow their instincts when in danger and
head inland.
   The mass beaching was the first in three years on Cape Cod. The
biggest earlier beaching was of 97 whales in Eastham in 1984.
   The three whales known to have survived were taken to the New
England Aquarium and stabilized before being released.
   Predicting that the high tides and full moon of last week might
disorient some whales and cause a stranding, experts called an
alert over the weekend and moved their research boat from its berth
less than a mile from Squaw Island to Sesuit, on Cape Cod's bay
side.
   The research boat is equipped to play the sounds of whales
feeding underwater to try to lure the animals away from shore. But
the boat was positioned exactly opposite of where the stranding
ultimately happened.
   ``We were half right,'' Dave Wiley, co-coordinator of the Cape
Cod Stranding Network, said Wednesday.
   Three other pilot whales were stranded on Cape Cod on Tuesday
and Wednesday in unrelated incidents. Only one survived.

   Peter Goelden, who ran for governor in
1987 as an independent, apparently hanged himself, police said. He
was 48.
   The body was found Tuesday night, hanging from the middle of the
showroom in a Shreveport carpet store, where Goelden worked as a
salesman, police said.
   No suicide note was found at the store, police said.
   Anger over nearly $700 million in new taxes prompted Goelden to
start a recall drive in 1984 against Democrat Edwin Edwards, who
was then governor.
   He fell 35,000 signatures short of the 750,000 needed for a
recall election.
   Goelden was among seven people who ran against Edwards in the
1987 election won by Democrat Gov. Buddy Roemer.

   Education Secretary Lauro Cavazos, the
nation's first Hispanic-American Cabinet member, resigned without
explanation Wednesday and a White House source said he had been
fired.
   The source, who insisted on anonymity, said Chief of Staff John
H. Sununu personally told Cavazos about the firing Tuesday.
   In his two years as Education Secretary, Cavazos was best known
for promoting the idea of allowing parents to decide where to send
their children to school. He also advocated bilingual education.
   But another official, who also spoke on condition of anonymity,
said Cavazos was seen as lacking dynamism and not making enough
progress in education, an area Bush designated as a high priority
for his administration.
   A White House source said Cavazos was out of town and had let it
be known he would not be back, not even for the kind of personal
departure appearance that Bush made with the other top officials
who have left his administration.
   Other administration sources said Cavazos, 63, had tired of
criticism from the White House and elsewhere.
   Cavazos himself gave neither a reason for his resignation nor
details about his future plans, said Education Department
spokeswoman Etta Fielek.
   The resignation was announced at a Cabinet meeting, which
Cavazos didn't attend.
   Fielek said Cavazos didn't attend the meeting because ``he's not
very good at farewells and he thought this is the most comfortable
way to do it.''
   Cavazos is the third major administration official to resign
since October. Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole quit to join the
American Red Cross and William Bennett, head of the Office of
National Drug Control Policy, stepped down and later was named head
of the Republican National Committee.
   ``Basically, it would be hard to tell what would have been
different if we hadn't had a secretary of education at all during
this period of time,'' said longtime critic Albert Shanker,
president of the American Federation of Teachers. ``I hope they
don't keep the position vacant for another three years.''
   But Keith Geiger, president of the National Education
Association, said Cavazos ``proved to be a decent man with the
interest of America's children at heart.''
   The resignation is effective Saturday, with Deputy Education
Secretary Ted Sanders serving as acting head of the department.
   Sources said that Sanders has been lobbying for Cavazos'
position. Also considered to be possible successors are Lynne
Cheney, chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities;
former New Jersey Gov. Thomas Kean; Rep. Patricia Saiki, a former
schoolteacher who lost her November bid to unseat Sen. Daniel
Akaka, D-Hawaii; and Rep. Lynn Martin, who also has been mentioned
as a possible successor to Mrs. Dole.
   Cavazos, whose father was a cattle foreman at the King Ranch in
Texas, earned a bachelor's degree in zoology and a master's degree
in cytology at Texas Technological College, which later became
Texas Tech University. He received a doctorate in physiology from
Iowa State University in 1954.
   Cavazos was president of Texas Tech when he became the first
Hispanic Cabinet official in the waning days of the Reagan
administration. Bush kept him in the job.
   ``For more than two years, and under two presidents, you have
distinguished yourself through your devotion to improving the
education of our nation's children,'' Bush said in a letter
accepting Cavazos' resignation.
   Cavazos said in his letter that he was proud of the
contributions he made in ``expanding choice in education, promoting
the executive order on excellence in education for Hispanic
Americans, and raising awareness of the growing diversity of
America's student population.''
   Cavazos was a far less controversial secretary of education than
Bennett, his predecessor, who warred with teacher unions and was an
acerbic critic of America's universities.
   Cavazos made peace with the National Education Association and
other leading groups in the education establishment.
   But Antonio Rigual, president of the Hispanic Association of
Colleges and Universities, said it was widely known that the
administration wasn't supportive of Cavazos because ``he just
wasn't fitting the mold that the administration wanted to head the
Education Department.''
   Rep. William D. Ford, D-Mich., incoming chairman of the House
Committee on Education and Labor, said he had ``remarkably little
contact'' with Cavazos. But Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, ranking
Republican on the Senate Education and Labor Committee, said
Cavazos ``brought increased visibility to the importance of
education for all Americans.''
   Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman of the Senate Subcommittee
on Education, Arts and Humanities, said Cavazos' ``commitment to
educational opportunities for minorities and the poor has been
without question.''
   Cavazos was only the fourth person to be secretary of education.
The post was created when education was elevated to Cabinet status
in 1980 during the Carter administration.

<HEAD>Pentagon Purchasing Chief Quits; Criticized In Stealth Mismangement
Report</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN KING</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   John A. Betti, the Pentagon's top procurement
official who was roundly criticized last week in an internal report
on mismanagement in a $50 billion stealth aircraft program, said
Wednesday he was resigning.
   Betti, a former Ford Motor Co. executive who had been
undersecretary of defense for acquisition for 16 months, said in
his letter of resignation he would leave effective Dec. 31 so he
would not be covered by new ethics laws next year that impose
tougher post-employment restrictions on former government
officials.
   In his letter of resignation, Betti made no mention of the
unfolding story of mismanagement in the development of the Navy's
A-12 attack plane.
   Speaking privately, two Pentagon officials said Betti had
intended to leave soon anyway but the timing of his announcement
was connected to the recent revelations about the A-12 being
developed by McDonnell Douglas Corp. and General Dynamics Corp.
   One of the two said Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's plans to
slash the responsibilities of the job also led Betti to quit.
   A Navy admiral was forced to retire last week and two other
officers were reassigned after disclosure that they had failed to
pass word up the chain of command about cost increases and schedule
delays in the A-12.
   The A-12, called the Avenger, is a radar-evading ``stealth''
plane supposed to replace the elderly A-6 aboard carriers starting
in 1995.
   Betti's office referred calls to a Defense Department
spokeswoman, who said she had no information on whether Betti
already had lined up a new job.
   In a written statement, Betti said he believed he had
considerably improved the Pentagon's oft-criticized purchasing
system. But he also said ``substantive, lasting improvements in
defense acquisition will not occur overnight.
   ``Rather it will be a long, slow and arduous process requiring
patience and constancy of purpose.''
   Cheney, in a letter accepting the resignation, also made no
mention of the A-12 controversy and told Betti ``Your dedicated and
successful efforts to strengthen the acquisition process ... have
been instrumental in maintaining a strong national defense.''
   Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee, said Betti's resignation ``shows how resistant the
Pentagon is to change.'' Aspin said the job was created by Congress
``to buy weapons that work on time and at cost,'' but was soon to
be vacant for the third time in four years.
   Rep. John Conyers Jr., D-Mich., chairman of the Government
Operations Committee, said the resignation ``would not put an end
to the cozy old-boy's network at the Pentagon, where problems are
swept under the rug while airplanes crash and contractors reap
unearned billions.''
   The A-12 development program is now a year behind schedule and
20 percent over the planned $4.7 billion cost.
   Defense Department Inspector General Susan J. Crawford said in a
report last week that word of the problems didn't reach Cheney and
other top Pentagon officials in large part because the contractors
had control over the work done by government inspectors.
   But she also said Betti had been informed of some of the
problems by a deputy but ``failed to report the conclusions reached
by his own staff regarding the A-12.''
   ``Mr. Betti relied on general assurances, which he invited, from
the contractor and prior Navy assurances that the A-12 development
contract would be completed within ceiling costs,'' Crawford's
report said. ``We find Mr. Betti's failure especially troublesome
in view of a prior warning.''
   The A-12 controversy was not the first time Betti has faced
criticism for his office's policies.
   In July, Betti faced hostile questioning from a members of a
congressional panel who demanded he accept a Justice Department
recommendation that Northrop Corp. be barred from Pentagon business
for its criminal fraud conviction on charges it faked tests
involving nuclear cruise missiles.
   Betti rejected the demands but admitted he had never reviewed
evidence from several federal investigations of Northrop's conduct.
In the same testimony he also acknowledged he was not aware the
military had repeatedly waived contract requirements for cruise
missiles, even after allegations of misconduct arose and a federal
prosecutor warned that such waivers could harm the government's
case against Northrop.
   ``You don't know what your managers are doing, your managers
don't know what Northrop is doing, your costs are going up and you
have criminal investigations going on,'' Committee Chairman Rep.
John Dingell, D-Mich., said at the July hearing. ``I am worried
that no one knows what is going on.''

   John McEnroe, the tennis world's notorious

Hawaii on Wednesday as he does at missing a serve.
   McEnroe and two gate agents were escorted to the San Francisco
Airport police station after an apparent shouting and shoving
match, said airport police Sgt. Gary O'Donnell.
   McEnroe was traveling with his wife, actress Tatum O'Neal, their
two children and a nanny, O'Donnell said.
   It was evident after about 45 minutes that neither side wanted
to pursue the incident, he said.
   United spokeswoman Sara Dornacker refused to confirm the police
account, saying only that there was ``an incident'' after the
McEnroe party missed Flight 31 from San Francisco to Kona. McEnroe
was booked on a later United flight to Hawaii, she said.
   The airline ``has not signed any complaint or pressed any
charges in this matter, and we do not intend to,'' Dornacker said.
   Dornacker said the flight was held several minutes to wait for
McEnroe and his party.
   The tennis star couldn't be reached for comment on the incident.
ornacker wouldn't say what flight he was traveling on and his
whereabouts were unknown.

<TEXT>
   Already grappling with debt and
governmental problems, this beleaguered town of 1,650 is under
federal investigation of its sewage plant that could lead to
indictment.
   ``Obviously the whole town can't be put in jail,'' town attorney
Eugene E. Waldron said Tuesday. ``But this could result in
substantial penalties on the town.''
   Zolfo Springs received the latest bad news Monday night, when
Waldron told other town officials he had been summoned to a
``pre-indictment'' conference in Tampa.
   Waldron said he expects to be informed at the Friday conference
of possible charges the town faces in connection with its lone
sewer plant. He believes the hamlet could be indicted as a
corporation. The charges would be based on intentional
environmental violations at the plant, Waldron said.
   ``Certainly, we deny it,'' Waldron said.
   He wouldn't comment on whether treated sewage was flowing into a
nearby river, as state inspectors have claimed.
   Problems at the plant have prompted the town, about 70 miles
southeast of Tampa, to ban new residential or commercial
construction since 1989. The plant can't handle the extra sewage,
engineers say.
   The $3.2 million plant, built with federal Farmer's Home
Administration grants and loans, began operation in 1987. Within a
year, the U.S. Department of Agriculture began looking into its
operation.
   Florida Department of Environmental Regulation inspectors have
said they discovered that treated sewage discharge from the plant
was flowing into a tributary of the Peace River. The discharge was
supposed to be absorbed into soil at the site.
   Steve Thompson, one of the state inspectors, said last week he
had appeared before a federal grand jury in Tampa to answer
questions about the plant. Bob Peters, who was on the Zolfo Springs
Town Council at the time the plant was being built, also said he
testified before the panel.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Robert Munk would not comment. Federal
law prohibits his discussing grand jury matters.
   Cost overruns from the plant were a major reason the town ran
out of money last year and was forced to declare a financial
emergency. The mayor and most of the town council resigned in the
wake of the problems and November's municipal election had to be
delayed because not enough candidates had signed up to run.

   Santa is such a busy man these days his helpers

   If the wait to see Kris Kringle at Frederick &amp; Nelson is longer

   Parents are given a coupon assigning their children a time to

   Fisher said appointments aren't necessary most of the time, but
the wait can be an hour or two on Friday nights and weekends.
   One of Santa's red-suited helpers, who gave her name only as

shop and eat lunch than stand in the rain.
   Some people complain ``because they like the traditional way of

   A British forces radio station being started to
cheer up troops in the Gulf has barred Christmas carols from its

   The British Forces Broadcasting Service has ruled out religious
programs and Christian references - including carols.
   Chris Russell, in charge of starting BFBS Middle East on Dec.
17, said: ``In deference to the host nation, Saudi Arabia, we are
making one or two adjustments to our normal output.
   ``For instance, there will be no religious broadcasting, and no
Christmas carols with overtly Christian words. But there will be
plenty of seasonal music and lots of laughs.''
   The Ministry of Defense is financing the $161,500 radio station
that will transmit a mix of entertainment, news and features on the
VHF waveband.
   Initial broadcasts will be from Al Jubayl, where Britain's
Desert Rats soldiers are based, and have a range of about 30 miles.
   Later, more transmission sites will be set up for forces closer
to the Kuwaiti border, on guard for possible action against Iraqi
troops in occupied Kuwait.

   Leftist rebels forced down a
government helicopter Wednesday in a series of attacks that left at
least 51 dead.
   The armed forces said the heaviest combat was in the eastern
provinces of San Miguel and Usulutan. Sporadic fighting continued
throughout the day.
   Honduras said about 200 Salvadoran soldiers, some seriously
wounded, crossed its border after a battle with the rebels on
Salvadoran territory.
   Honduran Foreign Minister Mario Carias Zapata said U.N. military
observers were sent to the area to verify the incident and provide
assistance. Rebels did not pursue the soldiers into Honduras, he
said.
   The incident has been reported to the Salvadoran government, and
the troops will be sent home, the ministry said.
   The ministry also said that Miguel Saenz, a senior official of
the rebel Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, had scheduled
a meeting with President Rafael Callejas to discuss the incident.
Salvadoran military officials were not available for comment.
   The FMLN attacks began with a rebel assault Tuesday night on
army positions on the fringes of San Jorge, 95 miles southeast of
San Salvador. The army said 11 soldiers and 30 guerrillas died in
the San Jorge fighting.
   The rebels' clandestine Radio Venceremos said guerrilla ground
fire forced down a government UH-1H helicopter early Wednesday near
the Honduran border.
   The armed forces said the helicopter was only slightly damaged
but acknowledged that one gunner was killed and the pilot, co-pilot
and a second gunner were wounded.
   The FMLN also attacked an army garrison 45 miles north of the
capital in Chalatenango.
   The military said the rebel mortars fell short, hitting the
nearby City Hall and four adjacent houses instead. There were no
reports of casualties.
   The rebels wounded two soldiers in an attack on a nearby
outpost, the armed forces said.
   Radio Venceremos said FMLN fighters captured 11 soldiers near
Chalatenango and gave the soldiers' names. The armed forces refused
to comment.
   Guerrillas also attacked the 3rd Infantry Brigade in San Miguel,
100 miles east of the capita, on Wednesday morning, and the armed
forces said three soldiers were killed and 11 wounded.
   In the capital, rebel explosives exploded at four bank branches
Wednesday, causing substantial damage but no casualties.
   The armed forces said rebels halted morning traffic on the
international highway on the outskirts of Santa Tecla, 10 miles
from the capital; burned a bus and flattened the tires of dozens of
vehicles.
   Three soldiers and three guerrillas were killed in Jiquilisco,
75 miles southeast of San Salvador, the army said.
   In San Vicente, 37 miles east of San Salvador, 10 soldiers and
eight guerrillas were wounded, the armed forces said.
   Rebel radio said 69 soldiers were killed or wounded in heavy
fighting in Usulutan province. The armed forces gave no
province-wide count.
   The FMLN began stepping up the pace of combat Nov. 20 in what it
said was a campaign to force the right-wing government into
concessions at the negotiating table and punish the armed forces
for human rights abuses.
   At least 73,000 people - many of them civilians killed by
military-linked death squads - have died in more than a decade of
war between the rebels and a succession of U.S.-backed governments
in this Central American nation of more than 5.5 million people.

<HEAD>Storm Leaves 6 Missing, High Winds Blow Little Auks Off Course</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Fierce northerly winds Wednesday blew a flock of
arctic seabirds over Britain, one of the largest movements of
little auks ever recorded here.
   Little auks, relatives of guillemots and puffins, were spotted
flying in an almost continuous stream off Whitburn, Tyne and Wear
in northeast England near the Scottish border.
   ``This is one of the greatest movements of these normally scarce
visitors to British waters ever recorded,'' said Peter Collins, the
National Trust warden at Whitburn.
   Almost 4,000 little auks were spotted in five hours, and
birdwatchers manning Whitburn Observatory said they may have missed
many more flying low among the waves.
   The birding report came as gales swept the North Sea on
Wednesday, capsizing a fishing boat with six men aboard,
threatening oil rig crews and driving mountainous waves onto
Britain's east coast.
   The storm followed weekend snowstorms that buffeted Britain and
much of Europe, leaving about 20 people dead, stranding hundreds of
travelers and downing power lines supplying thousands of homes.
   Flood alerts were issued along the east coast on Wednesday.
   Helicopters lifted oil workers off wind-lashed rigs miles from
the coast, but after a day-long search the Scottish coast guard
called off efforts to find the six missing fishermen - three of
them brothers. There was no hope of finding them alive, a spokesman
said.
   Coast guard spokesman Robert Crowther at Lerwick in the Shetland
Islands north of Scotland, said the 68-ton fishing boat Premier,
registered at Inverness, had been sighted 30 miles out to sea,
capsized and with an empty life raft nearby.

   Nancy Cruzan's parents will find out
Friday whether a county judge will allow a halt to their comatose
daughter's food and water so she can die.
   The U.S. Supreme Court cleared the way in June in its first
right-to-die decision by ruling that Missouri could keep a patient
on life support in the absence of ``clear and convincing'' evidence
the person would want to die.
   Probate Judge Charles Teel announced Wednesday he will hand down
his decision in Carthage, in southwest Missouri, on Friday.
   Ms. Cruzan, 33, has been hospitalized in a persistent vegetative
state with no hope of recovery since a 1983 car accident. She is
kept alive by feedings through a stomach tube at the state-run
Missouri Rehabilitation Center in Mount Vernon.
   Last month, three people told Teel they believe Ms. Cruzan would
rather die than live in her current condition. They based their
comments on statements they said Ms. Cruzan made between 1978 and
1982.
   The state was dropped from the case by Teel in October at the
request of Missouri Attorney General William Webster, who said the
state has ``no recognizable legal interest.''
   The woman's court-appointed guardian, Carthage attorney Thad
McCanse, has sided with the parents, Joe and Joyce Cruzan of
Carterville, saying that allowing Ms. Cruzan to die would be in her
best interest.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. Army has signed a pact with
Soviet scientists to develop a vaccine to combat hemorrhagic fever,
a deadly disease found in Asia, the Soviet Union and elsewhere, the
military said Wednesday.
   It is the first agreement of its kind between Army medical
researchers and a Soviet scientific agency.
   Army scientists have developed a vaccine that they believe will
work against hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome. Under the
agreement, Soviet scientists will work with them to refine the
vaccine and test it on thousands of volunteers.
   ``This kind of collaboration is another confirmation of the
openness that is developing and the willingness to draw closer
together on scientific matters and other things,'' said Col. Thomas
Monath, chief of virology at the U.S. Army Medical Research
Institute of Infectious Diseases.
   The Fort Detrick institute is the Army's lead laboratory in
medical defense against biological weapons, but hemorrhagic fever
is not considered a biological warfare threat, Monath said. The
Army would use the vaccine to protect soldiers deployed in parts of
the world where the disease is prevalent.
   The World Health Organization estimates that 100,000 to 500,000
cases of the disease occur each year. The disease is a major health
problem in the Soviet Union, Asia and Scandinavia, Monath said.
Significant outbreaks have been reported in parts of Eastern
Europe.
   Thousands of U.S. soldiers contracted the disease during the
Korean War. Fewer American soldiers die of it today, but the
potential for losses exists if troops are deployed in areas where
the disease is widespread, Monath said.
   In 1987, 18 U.S. Marines contracted the disease in Korea; two
died.
   Hemorrhagic fever produces flu-like symptoms and low blood
pressure. In its most serious stages, the disease causes kidney
problems and internal bleeding in the brain, lungs and digestive
system.
   The disease is spread by rodents, Monath said. It is found in
airborne dust contaminated by rodent urine.
   Fort Detrick researchers will work with about 10 scientists at
the Institute of Poliomyelitis and Viral Encephalitides. The
institute is part of the Academy of Medical Sciences, a government
agency for medical research in Moscow.
   Tests to determine whether the vaccine is safe and effective
will be conducted on rats and monkeys at Fort Detrick for at least
six months, Monath said. After that, the vaccine will be tested on
up to 12 human volunteers at Fort Detrick, he said. It will then be
tested in Bashkiria, Siberia, where most cases in the Soviet Union
are found.
   Researchers at Fort Detrick plan to travel to the Soviet Union
next spring to prepare for trials using placebos and the vaccine.
The trials will involve as many as several thousand volunteers.
Testing in the Soviet Union could begin as early as 1992, Monath
said.

   The family of Brian Watkins, the Utah tourist
slain in a subway mugging last summer, has notified the city it
intends to file a lawsuit seeking $100 million, the comptroller's
office said Wednesday.
   The notice said the city and the Transit Authority, which
oversees the subways, failed to provide ``a competent, adequate and
safe place for the general riding public'' the night Watkins was
killed.
   Watkins, 22, of Provo, Utah, was on an annual trip to the U.S.
Open tennis tournament with his family when they were mugged Sept.
2 in a subway station by a group of youths.
   Watkins interceded when one youth punched his mother in the
face. He was stabbed in the chest and died a short time later.
Eight suspects have been arrested and charged with murder.
   Watkins' death capped a summer of seemingly escalating random
violence and helped trigger Mayor David Dinkins campaign to hire
thousands of new police officers.
   The notice of intent to sue also said the city Emergency Medical
Service was negligent in its response and treatment of Watkins. The
notice was received by Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman's office Nov.
23.
   The family's attorney, Charles S. Brofman of Carmel, was ou of
his office Wednesday and could not be reached for comment on when
the lawsuit would be filed, his secretary said.
   The family has until December 1991 to file suit.

   Parliament gave the government the
green light on Wednesday to apply to join the European Community
next year, under a timetable that could make Sweden a member by
1995.
   The move increased pressure in Norway and Finland to join, too.
   ``Only as a member can our country fully participate and have an
influence on the EC cooperation,'' the parliamentary majority said
in a statement. ``A Swedish membership in the EC, while still
keeping Sweden's policy of neutrality, is in accordance with our
country's national interests.''
   Present members of the world's biggest trading bloc are Belgium,
Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the
Netherlands, Britain, Spain and Portugal. Spain and Portugal, the
last additions, joied in 1986.
   EC Commission president Jacques Delors says the bloc will not
expand before 1993. By then, the existing members are to have
completed consolidating their economies into a single market.
   ``Norway has to move together with Sweden in its European
policies,'' Jan. P. Syse, Norway's Conservative leader and former
prime minister said in reaction to Wednesday's news.
   ``An EC with Sweden as a member will move Scandinavia's center
of gravity into Europe.''
   Syse's coalition government fell apart in October in a dispute
over negotiations with the EC.
   Finnish Foreign Minister Pertti Paasio said the question of
Finnish membership may ``become a more central issue'' in next
year's election campaigns. ``I think the pressures (to join) have
been increasing all the while.''
   The Social Democrats, who control Sweden's minority government,
were supported on the motion by the Moderate and Liberal parties,
which have formed a coalition to try to win next year's elections.
The Center Party changed its previous position and voted for the EC
application.
   The Environment Party and the Left Party, formerly the
Communists, voted against. The vote in the 349-seat Riksdag was 287
for EC membership, 40 against, and 22 abstentions.
   ``It looks as if the application will come next year,'' said
Lars Vargo, spokesman for the Foreign Affairs Committee which
drafted the plan.
   The EC takes no official position on prospective members until
they apply. But the Nordic countries, with their well-developed
modern economies, have the impression their applications would be
looked upon favorably.
   Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland favors eventual
EC membership.

<TEXT>
   The U.N. General Assembly on Wednesday
unanimously endorsed a ban on mining in Antarctica and said it
wanted a role in any decisions on protecting the frozen continent.
   A resolution, adopted 98-0 with 7 abstentions, ``expresses
regret'' that the U.N. secretary-general had not been invited to
meetings of the Antarctic Treaty nations considering such
environmental measures.
   The United States, Soviet Union, France, Australia and New
Zealand were among a number of nations that said they were not
participating in the vote. Decisions on Antarctica have
historically resided within the Antarctic Treaty signatory group.
   Twelve of the 39 Antarctic Treaty nations - particularly France,
New Zealand and Australia - are seeking to designate Antarctica a
vast nature preserve or world park.
   No commercial mining or oil exploration is being conducted in
the southernmost continent, but a ban on future activity is
considered a key to the plan.
   The treaty nations recently met in Chile to discuss how to
implement a ban on commercial mining in Antarctica, which is
believed to contain large quantities of minerals beneath its
surface.
   The U.N. resolution said issues on Antarctica should be brought
before a U.N. summit on the environment scheduled in June 1992 in
Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.
   Environmentalists say at least several of the 26 Antarctic
Treaty nations with decision-making power generally resist moves to
yield any of their authority to the United Nations or world
community.
   Bruce Manheim of the Environmental Defense Fund in Washington
noted that rising fears about possible exploitation of the
continent, recent oil spills and burgeoning tourism have led the
world community to call for a greater voice in the process.

   The German maker of an anti-depressant that
was sold worldwide said Wednesday it will plead guilty to charges
it waited too long to notify U.S. regulators the drug killed two
patients in Europe.
   Hoechst AG marketed the drug nomifensine in the United States
under the name Merital and voluntarily pulled it from shelves in
1986.
   The company's U.S. subsidiary, Hoechst-Roussel Pharmaceuticals
Inc. in Somerville, was not charged. A spokeswoman there said the
German company intended to plead guilty to the charges and pay the
maximum fine of $202,000. A court date has not been set.
   The charges were filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in
Newark against Hoechst AG and its former research director, Rainer
Zapf.
   The case marks the first time a foreign drug maker has been
prosecuted for failing to inform the Food and Drug Administration
of adverse drug reactions that occurred outside the United States,
said U.S. Attorney Michael Chertoff.
   More than 14 million people in 96 countries used the
anti-depressant between its introduction in the early 1970s until
it was approved for use in the United States in December 1984, the
company said. Hoechst began marketing the drug in the United States
in July 1985.
   Charges were filed because Hoechst waited until 1986 to inform
the FDA of a 1984 nomifensine-related death in France and a 1981
death in Italy, authorities said.
   ``Accurate and timely reports of serious drug complications -
irrespective of where in the world those reactions occur - are
critical to millions of Americans who rely on the Food and Drug
Administration to help ensure that prescribed medications are safe
and effective,'' Chertoff said in a statement.
   Hoechst pulled the drug after it noticed an increase in
hemolytic anemia, a potentially fatal form of leukemia in which the
red blood cells that carry oxygen through the body are destroyed
faster than the body can replace them.
   The two patients in Europe died from hemolytic anemia associated
with the drug, court papers showed.
   Andrea Stine, a spokeswoman for both the parent company and the
U.S. subsidiary, said she did not know how widely the drug was used
in the United States. She said the company recorded $5 million in
U.S. sales from the anti-depressant, but she did not know what it
cost.
   Rick Blumber, an attorney for the FDA, said Hoechst acted
properly when it reported another death associated with the drug in
Europe in April 1985. He said the anti-depressant was relabeled as
a result of that fatality to warn that the drug could cause
hemolytic anemia.

   In classrooms across the city, students and
teachers paused for a moment of silence Wednesday for a high school
pupil they never knew.
   Kingsley Allen, 17, was stabbed to death Tuesday in a hallway of
Boston High School. Witnesses told police Allen was killed when he
resisted a robbery attempt, said police spokesman Scott Gillis.
   Allen was the 140th in the city's record number of homicides
this year and acting Superintendent Joseph McDonough said he
believes it was the first killing inside a Boston school. The
previous homicide record was 135 in 1973.
   Allen's classmate, Robert L. Reynolds, 18, pleaded innocent to
murder charges Wednesday and was held without bond.
   Educators said the most difficult part for students may be
coming to grips with an act of violence in a place they considered
safe.
   ``The schools have been perceived in the city as a haven, and up
to now they have been,'' said Michael Contompasis, headmaster at
Boston Latin High School. ``The young people have, by and large,
felt comfortable leaving behind the stresses of the streets and
neighborhoods.''
   School officials and parents Wednesday began organizing a
systemwide campaign aimed at preventing such violence. And
administrators at Boston High School said students will face
stepped-up security when they return Thursday.
   The campaign ``will focus on how young people can resolve their
problems without resorting to violence,'' said schools spokesman
Larry W. Faison.
   As a first step, administrators asked the city's 115 schools to
begin with a moment of silence Wednesday. McDonough also asked
teachers to discuss the implications of the tragedy with the
system's 57,000 students.
   At Boston High, where classes were canceled Wednesday,
administrators held a daylong program to prepare teachers to deal
with their returning classes.
   ``We let the staff air out their feelings and discuss the grief
that normally comes with this kind of incident,'' said Headmaster
Thomas Hennessey.
   Teachers were instructed to acknowledge the incident with
students, dispel rumors and ``tell them its okay to have strong
feelings about it,'' he said. ``Most important, you get back to the
normal routine as quickly as possible.''
   But that may be difficult when school officials use hand-held
metal detectors to frisk students as they enter the building
Thursday.
   ``Due to the nature of the tragedy, we're going to have some
extraordinary precautions,'' Hennessey said.
   Faison said the anti-violence campaign must show students ways
other than violence and drugs to deal with anger or despair.
   ``We have to show them a way out,'' he said.
   In addition, young people must be made to understand the
long-lasting impact of violent acts, he said.
   ``Of two young people yesterday, one is dead and the other's
life is actually destroyed,'' he said. ``We want to make sure they
understand that this is the end result when you use violence.''

   An Amtrak train operated by a trainee derailed and
slammed into a rush-hour commuter train in a tunnel Wednesday,
injuring 264 passengers in a crash so violent cars were flung into
the tunnel ceiling and buckled the road above.
   ``All the lights went out, people started screaming, the place
was filled with smoke, a few people were trapped under seats,''
said Chris Good, a passenger on the suburban Stoughton Line train.
   About 1,500 gallons of diesel fuel spilled and ignited after the
impact, sending dense smoke into the cars that passenger Joe Povoas
said ``you could grind with your teeth, you could spit it out.''
   Many passengers, dazed and covered with soot, wandered out of
the station, some crying, many assisted by emergency personnel.
   One elderly woman, her face black with soot and wearing no
shoes, asked police: ``Where's my luggage? Where are my shoes?''
   Ten people were in critical condition, including the engineer of
Amtrak's Night Owl train from Washington, D.C., said Jon Fasana,
director of the city's emergency services.
   Overall, 264 people, including four rescue workers, were hurt,
said Thomas Glynn, general manager of the Massachusetts Bay
Transportation Authority. The injured passengers were among 190
aboard the Amtrak train and about 900 on the commuter train. They
suffered from cuts and bruises, smoke inhalation, broken bones and
head injuries.
   An Amtrak trainee was operating the train under the supervision
of an engineer with 25 years' experience, said D.J. Beatty, general
supervisor for Amtrak. Richard Abramson had three years of training
and was qualified to operate the train under the guidance of the
engineer, Beatty said. Abramson regularly operated trains as part
of his training, Beatty said.
   Abramson was listed in stable condition at St. Elizabeth's
Hospital with a broken collarbone, an injured back and facial
injuries. The engineer, Willis Copeland, was in critical condition.
   Amtrak spokeswoman Marci Larson said Copeland was the engineer
in a head-on collision on a New York City trestle in July 1984 in
which one person was killed and 115 were injured, but that he was
``completely exonerated.''
   That was verified by news reports on the NTSB's investigation of
the accident.
   Federal officials were investigating Wedneday's accident, which
occurred in the same Back Bay station in downtown Boston as an
almost identical crash three years ago caused by a faulty signal
system.
   ``We'll be very interested in seeing if there are any
connections,'' said NTSB spokesman Brent Bahler.
   The Federal Railroad Administration also sent a team of
inspectors and administered mandatory alcohol and drug tests to the
crew. The results will not be available for several days.
   Glynn would not comment on recorders taken from the cabins of
both trains, which have been turned over to NTSB investigators. The
speed of the Amtrak train will be determined by analyzing cabin
data.
   The crash left parts of the two trains twisted ``like a coat
hanger,'' said Fire Lt. Mike Walsh, who arrived at the scene two
minutes after the first alarm.
   ``There was an eerie calm,'' Walsh said. He said he and other
firefighters gave their oxygen masks to victims.
   The commuter train, which originated in Stoughton, south of
Boston, was sitting on an adjacent track running in the same
direction as the Night Owl when it was hit toward the rear at
around 8:30 a.m., said Nancy Sterling Gleason, a transit authority
spokeswoman.
   The Night Owl, which left Washington at 10:30 p.m. Tuesday,
apparently derailed on a curve and went into the side of the other
train, said Clifford Black, a spokesman for Amtrak in Washington.
   Two engines, two passenger cars and two baggage cars on the
Night Owl derailed and smashed into the parked train, hitting the
engine that was in the rear of the commuter train.
   The Amtrak train jackknifed, hit the ceiling tunnel and broke
concrete and steel support pillars, said John Harrison, acting fire
commissioner.
   ``We were sitting on the train and the next thing - crash, bang,
boom,'' passenger Kathy Simons said just before she was carried
away on a stretcher to an ambulance. ``I ended up on the floor with
a seat on top of me.''
   A nearly identical crash occurred at the same station between an
Amtrak train and a commuter train in 1987. The NTSB determined that
crash was caused by an improperly designed signal system, with
human error considered a secondary factor.
   Transit Authority spokesman Jim Ball said that signal system was
repaired shortly after the accident.
   But for Phyllis Laorenza, the crash brought frightening memories
of the 1987 crash, which she also experienced as a passenger on a
commuter train.
   ``The first thing I thought of was, `No, I can't believe this is
happening to me again,''' Laorenza said. ``It was very scary.''
   Officials said the train station would be out of service through
the weekend while the wreckage was cleared away.

<HEAD>Four-Year Drought Forces Mandatory Rationing in California Cities</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Parched by four years of drought, Southern
California cities and water agencies face stricter conservation
measures, including mandatory rationing and hefty fines for those
who fail to comply.
   Efforts to conserve dwindling water supplies accompany a growing
fear that winter precipitation won't be enough to stave off a
devastating fifth year of drought.
   Wednesday, the City Council's intergovernmental committee
approved a proposal to seek statewide water rationing patterned
after the city's own conservation ordinance. The measure must be
approved by the full council, where it is expected to pass easily,
Council President John Ferraro said.
   The board of the Metropolitan Water District, Southern
California's largest water supplier serving about 15 million
people, imposed a strict mandatory rationing plan Tuesday on its
client cities and agencies.
   The district serves Los Angeles, Orange, San Diego, Riverside,
San Bernardino and Ventura counties.
   Both actions point to a growing realization that the region is
running out of water rapidly and that voluntary conservation
measures may not be enough.
   ``What if next year the drought should continue?'' asked
Metropolitan Water District spokesman Bob Gomperz. ``What we've
done is we've drawn down reservoir sources of water and now we're
down to the bare bones.''
   In seeking statewide water rationing, Los Angeles risks
aggravating a longstanding conflict with Northern California over
water rights.
   The rift has grown in recent months as residents of several
Northern California cities, including San Francisco and San Jose,
have been ordered to conserve water.
   ``Anytime we start talking about this (statewide legislation) in
Southern California, Northern Californians think we're trying to
steal their water,'' Ferraro said. ``We've got to be careful
sponsoring legislation because that's so sensitive.
   ``As the shortage develops, I think they'll be more receptive,''
he said.
   No bill has been drafted yet.
   Under the district's rationing plan, water agencies and cities
must achieve reductions equal to a 5 percent cut in residential use
and a 20 percent reduction in agricultural use. Violators will be
charged triple the usual price for each acre-foot of water over the
limit. An acre-foot is about 326,000 gallons.
   The district left it to local entities to determine how to
accomplish the reduction goals.
   Following the district's action, Mayor Tom Bradley said the city
will look at imposing similar mandatory conservation measures. But
a decision likely will be delayed until February, when officials
can better assess the effect of winter precipitation.
   Since early this year, the city has relied on voluntary
conservation to achieve a 10 percent reduction in consumption. The
program is part of a conservation plan that calls for restrictions
that become increasingly strict as they are phased in.
   In Phase 2, the 10 percent reduction becomes compulsory and
violators are assessed substantial fines. Phase 5, the plan's final
segment, requires a 25 percent reduction in water use.
   San Diego, another large Southern California water consumer, has
no immediate plans to impose mandatory rationing on residents, said
Paul Downey, spokesman for Mayor Maureen O'Connor.
   He said water use had been cut voluntarily 10.7 percent between
June and September, indicating no need for mandatory restrictions.
   Stanley Sprague, general manager for the Municipal Water
District of Orange County, said voluntary cutbacks had reduced
water use by 8 percent during the past year.
   He did not expect local water agencies to move to mandatory
measures.
   ``Very few water agencies in the county have mandatory
ordinances in place,'' he said. ``Even if they wanted to go
mandatory, they'd have to go through the whole ordinance procedure.
That can take two to four months.''

   While deposed Panamanian dictator Manuel
Noriega claims poverty from his Miami prison cell, a newspaper
reported Wednesday he and his family had quite a penchant for
plastic money.
   The fallen general amassed a fortune of $31.5 million and
charged nearly $280,000 from 1986 to 1988, USA Today reported.
   The newspaper said it had obtained Noriega's Visa credit card
accounts and many of his previously undisclosed bank records.
   Records indicate during that time that the Noriega family ran up
charges to almost $280,000, mostly at establishments like Christian
Dior and Valentino's in Paris, and Harvey Nichols in London,
Princess Di's favorite luxury department store.
   In Miami, where the family spent more than $38,000, the focus
was on family and household needs, frequently at sprawling Dadeland
Mall, south of Miami. Typical among the flurry of charges were Toys
R Us, Baker Shoes, Docktor Pet Center, Linens N Things and J.C.
Penney.
   One Miami charge made by Noriega's wife, Felicidad, in 1987 was
for $1,642 at A Christmas Place.
   Noriega claims he is now destitute, unable to pay his lawyers in
his drug conspiracy case.
   Federal prosecutors have frozen $21 million in Noriega's funds
in 27 bank accounts. His lawyers are threatening to pull out of the
case and the judge has said he will appoint a public defender.
   Frank Rubino, Noriega's lawyer, doesn't deny his client may have
once controlled hundreds of millions of dollars. But, he adds: ``I
don't believe today he has the ability to get one penny. If he did,
I'm sure he would (pay his lawyers) so we could go on with the
case. I mean he is really upset.''
   The general is now a Prisoner of War, receiving a monthly
federal stipend of $59 and CARE packages from the Red Cross while
held at the federal Metropolitan Correctional Center outside of
Miami.
   Meanwhile, in a $6.5 billion civil lawsuit, the Panamanian
government says Noriega looted his nation of at least $300 million
through corrupt military and government officials. It also claims
Noriega shifted funds to personal accounts from Panama's casinos,
lotteries, ports and immigration offices.

<HEAD>Army Publication Calls for More Than Doubling Defense Spending</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with 11 grafs to CORRECT percentage increase to 150

<TEXT>
   A publication of the China's People's
Liberation Army has called for a 150 percent increase in defense
spending over the next decade.
   Such an increase could substantially strengthen the army at a
time when some Asian neighbors have been worrying that Beijing
might seek to settle territorial disputes with its neighbors by
force.
   The call came in the May edition of a Chinese military magazine,
Military Economic Research, which is generally restricted to the
military and the Communist Party. A copy was obtained by The
Associated Press in Hong Kong.
   In the report, writer Li Yuansheng, an officer in the logistics
department of the Chengdu Military Region, argued that China's army
has ``lived in debt for a long time.''
   Li said increasing the army's budget to $15.5 billion by the
year 2000 - from 1990's figure of $6.16 billion - would be ``both
appropriate and feasible.''
   The jump would mean an increase of 150 percent in a military
budget that grew only 30 percent between 1980 and 1989.
   ``The world has not yet ushered in an era of peace and
prosperity,'' Li wrote, ``and China's security is still subjected
to actual and potential military threats from some of the
peripheral countries.''
   The magazine is published by the army's Academy of iilitary
Economics, its think tank for defense spending. A Western military
official said the report appeared to reflect the current thinking
of policy-makers.
   Professor Ngok Lee, an expert in the Chinese military at the
University of Hong Kong, said such a spending increase would appear
to be an attempt by China to assert what it sees as its traditional
influence in Asia.
   ``Ministers from all ASEAN states are scared like hell,'' he
said, referring to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
grouping of Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, the
Philippines and Brunei.
   Lee said he believed the army had the political capital to
obtain a 150 percent budget increase, especially given the crucial
role it played in suppressing a movement for democracy on June 4,
1989.
   He said several other developments point to the potential for a
more ambitious China during the next decade.
   Over the last two years, China's military has fundamentally
revised its force doctrine, called ``people's war,'' from a
defensive strategy to an offensive one, following improved ties
with its longtime No. 1 enemy, the Soviet Union.
   The key element of the new doctrine is called ``local war,''
founded on the concept that China will be the aggressor in warfare
conducted within limited space, time and means for limited
objectives.
   Secondly, the army is believed to have recently obtained
in-flight refueling technology for its jet fighters, which would
allow the army to project force hundreds of miles outside China's
borders.
   Western military officers and press reports say China has
received the technology from Iran, which obtained it from the
United States when Washington enjoyed good relations with Tehran.
   Additionally, China's military has been training
rapid-deployment forces, called Fist Battalions, since 1988. In
October, 600 paratroopers conducted a mock attack on an island in
the South China Sea, according to China's official Liberation Army
Daily.
   Troop cuts are also helping China fashion a professional
fighting force. Since 1985 the army has demobilized 700,000 troops,
25 percent of its total military strength, in a move away from a
``peasant army.''
   China has border disputes with India, Vietnam and the Soviet
Union. It fought a brief, victorious border war with India in 1962
and almost fought again in 1987. In 1979, it attacked Vietnam in a
failed attempt to teach Hanoi ``a lesson'' for invading Cambodia,
then a Chinese client state.
   One flashpoint has been identified as the Spratly archipelago, a
group of islands 600 nautical miles south of China's Hainan
province, believed to be rich in oil deposits and minerals.
   China, Malaysia, the Philippines and Taiwan have all made claims
on the territory.
   In March 1988, the Chinese navy sank one Vietnamese military
vessel and damaged two others during a skirmish near the islands.

   The opposition Social Democrats
scored big gains in parliamentary elections Wednesday, but
Conservative Prime Minister Poul Schlueter said he will try to stay
on by expanding his center-right minority government.
   ``I will seek to build the broadest possible foundation for a
non-socialist government,'' he said.
   Schlueter, who has headed successive center-right coalitions
since 1982, said final results showed a continued non-socialist
majority of 91 seats in the 179-seat Folketing, or parliament.
   With all ballots counted, the Social Democrats had gained 14
seats for a total of 69.
   Social Democratic Party leader Svend Auken demanded that
Schlueter resign, saying, ``Now is the time for a change of
government and a new majority in Danish politics.''
   But Schlueter said he will invite two small centrist parties,
the Center Democrats and the Christian People's Party, to join his
coalition of Conservatives, Liberals and Social Liberals, which
dropped one seat for a total of 66.
   ``We must discuss the three-party coalition tomorrow (Thursday),
but it's clear there is a non-socialist majority,'' he said.
   If formed, it would control 89 seats in parliament - one shy of
a majority.
   The Social Democrats' success was largely at the expense of the
allied Socialist People's Party, which slipped from 24 to 15 seats.
   It was uncertain if the Social Liberals, who dropped three of
their 10 seats, would stay in the government.
   Economy Minister Niels Helveg Petersen, the Social Liberal
leader, said the party would support Schlueter's efforts to head a
new government in any case.
   The Center Democrats and Christian People's Party took part in a
round-table discussion among party leaders after returns were in,
but declined to say if they would accept Schlueter's offer to join
a new coalition.
   Foreign Minister Uffe Ellemann-Jensen's Liberals gained seven
seats for a total of 29, while Schlueter's Conservatives dropped
from 35 seats to 30.
   The Center Democrats held their nine seats and the Christian
People's Party kept its four.
   Thirteen parties fielded candidates, but only the eight that sat
in the outgoing parliament secured the 2 percent of the vote needed
to be represented.
   Schlueter called the election on Nov. 22 when the Social
Democrats blocked parliamentary passage of the government's finance
bill.
   Voter turnout from among the 3.9 million registered voters was
82.8 prcent, compared with 85.7 in the 1988 ballot. It was
Denmark's fourth parliamentary election in six years.

<HEAD>Judge: Fair Housing Law Can't Be Applied to Insurer Accused of
Redlining</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRIAN BASHINSKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge has ruled the federal fair housing law
cannot be applied to insurers, rejecting two of five charges
against an insurance company accused of discriminating against
black homeowners in Milwaukee.
   U.S. District Court Judge Stadtmueller on Tuesday dismissed two
of five claims in a class action lawsuit against American Family
Mutual Insurance Co. by the NAACP.
   Lawyers for eight black homeowners, including Milwaukee Alderman
Marvin Pratt, and the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People said the decision will be appealed.
   The NAACP has said it is attempting to apply the federal law
guaranteeing fair access to housing to providers of homeowners
insurance because homeowners who cannot get such insurance are
unable to buy homes.
   The case is ``significant because it addresses a problem that
has substantial adverse impact on housing in the cities across the
nation,'' said William Lynch, a lawyer for the plaintiffs.
   The U.S. Justice Department's Civil Rights Division and the
National Fair Housing Alliance, a Washington-based advocacy group,
have filed briefs in support of the lawsuit.
   The lawsuit claims American Family discriminates in a practice
known as redlining, in which insurers instruct agents to avoid
selling policies in areas with more than 25 percent black
population.
   The lawsuit includes a memo the NAACP alleges was written by a
American Family supervisor instructing an insurance agent to ``stop
writing those blacks.'' It also alleges the insurer failed to hire
and retain black agents, did not locate offices in black
neighborhoods and offered blacks ``less advantageous'' policies
than whites.
   The two claims dismissed against the company were that
individuals need court action against the company because state law
doesn't allow them to take direct action against insurers and that
it is unlawful for insurers to discriminate against homeowners
based on location of house
   In dismissing those claims, Stadtmueller said any discriminatory
practices by insurance companies could not be considered in
violation of the U.S. Fair Housing Act.
   Stadtmueller cited a 1984 decision that said the Fair Housing
Act, enforced by the Department of Housing and Urban Development,
was not aimed at insurance agencies.
   John Powell, ACLU national legal director, disagreed with the
judge, saying other court decisions since 1984 apply the Fair
Housing Act in lawsuits against insurance companies.
   ``I'm fairly confident the 7th Circuit Court (of Appeals) will
overturn his decision because they've already spoken'' and ruled
fair housing statutes apply to insurance companies, he said.
   The insurance company's attorney, Tom Shriner, said he expected
the judge to dismiss the two counts because ``Congress and the
state Legislature pass the laws, judges don't.''
   Felmers Chaney, president of Milwaukee's NAACP, said he was not
surprised by the ruling, but said the judge should have interpreted
the Fair Housing Act differently.
   ``I remember back in the days before the civil right laws were
put into effect - if Congress didn't rule, the courts had to act,''
Chaney said.

   A bomb exploded Wednesday night in a

four others in Medellin, officials said.
   No details were immediately available on the circumstances of
the attack nor on who was responsible for the blast in Medellin,
which is Colombia's second largest city and home base to the
world's most violent cocaine cartel.
   More than 250 police have been killed between August 1989 and
July in bombings, shootings and attacks by hitmen hired by the
Extraditables, who oppose the government's policy of extraditing
noted drug trafficking suspects to the United States to face trial.
   The Extraditables, an arm of the cartel, called Tuesday for a
truce in their war and said they would not attempt further
terrorist attacks.

<TEXT>
   The premiers of North and South Korea
met in closed session Thursday to seek common ground for easing 45
years of confrontation, but a vacant place at the table symbolized
their gap.
   Prime ministers Yon Hyong Muk of Communist North and Kang
Young-hoon of capitalist South shook hands and chatted briefly
before taking their places with official delegates on either side
of a large rectangular table in a hotel ballroom.
   ``Both sides need to exchange frank opinions,'' Kang said.
``Even if there are differences in various matters, we must solve
them one by one.''
   The talks are the third round since September in the
highest-level meetings between the Koreas since the peninsula was
divided in 1945 and the border tightly sealed. The North Koreans
return home Friday.
   The vacant place belongs to Kim Jong-hwie, an official South
Korean delegate and special presidential aide for diplomacy and
national security.
   Kim was traveling to Moscow Thursday with South Korean President
Roh Tae-woo for a summit meeting with Soviet President Mikhail S.
Gorbachev. North Korea has bitterly criticized the trip.
   North Korea said Wednesday that its relations with Seoul could
not improve unless South Korea stops what the North called its
flunky-like diplomacy of soliciting foreign influence to help ease
tensions on the peninsula.
   Roh said he would ask Gorbachev for help in ending Cold War
tensions in Korea and to pressure the totalitarian northern regime
to open up its society.
   At Wednesday's two-hour opening session, both sides offered
proposals that were little changed in substance from past talks.
   ``The talks showed how big and wide are the valleys of distrust
between the two sides,'' said Limb Dong-won, a delegate and
spokesman for the South.
   While talks were going on, about a dozen North Korean reporters
slipped away from their official guides and explored Seoul by taxi
and subway.
   South Korea lodged a protest with the North Korean delegation
Thursday, which said the impromptu trips would stop.

   Even the ghost of Jack Benny couldn't save
Ebenezer Scrooge on Wednesday when a judge refused to clear the
name of the miserly main character of ``A Christmas Carol.''
   The tongue-in-cheek ruling by Municipal Judge George Choppelas
came at the Court of Historical Review and Appeals, a mock court
that met to decide if the name of the character created by Charles
Dickens should continue to be synonymous with greed and avarice.
   In the past, the court has ruled on such weighty questions as
the existence of Santa Claus or if chicken soup deserved to be
considered Jewish penicillin. Yes on both, the court found.
   The puns during the court's 65th session moved fast with
``little Dickens'' and ``you've been Scrooged'' bringing moans from
100 or so spectators.
   Scrooge, dressed in black and wearing a top hat, pleaded his
case, saying he had been ``sorely hurt by an early, early love.''
   Scrooge, portrayed by retired drama teacher E. Wyman Spalding,
claimed his mentor, Jacob Marley, should be blamed.
   ``It was Marley, Marley,'' he told the judge. ``Marley was the
real Scrooge.''
   The miser was defended by Frank Winston, who said the world
actually owed a debt to ``Eb,'' insisting that comedian Jack
Benny's tightwad image was inspired by the Scrooge character.
   Even the names were familiar, the lawyer said. BENny and
eBENezer. Get it?
   ``Eb was always a grand guy,'' Winston said.
   The references to Benny led Choppelas to try an impression of
the late comedian.
   ``I'm thinking, I'm thinking,'' he said at one point, a slight
Benny tone in his voice.
   Prosecutor Angela Alioto said Scrooge deserved his bad name
despite his change of heart at the end of the novel turned into a
popular Christmas movie.
   ``Those nightmares would scare the hell out of anybody,'' she
said. ``You can't change with a four-hour period of being nice.''
   Scrooge also drew the fire of Noah Griffin, a San Francisco
Examiner columnist who wrote a poem for the event. One stanza read:
   ``But tears from Scrooge were mean and vile
   Befitting but the crocodile.
   His so-called heartfelt transformation
   Was nothing but media manipulation.''

   The Security Council on Wednesday
postponed a vote on a resolution endorsing a Mideast peace
conference until after Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze
meets PLO chairman Yasser Arafat.
   The deputy Soviet ambassador, Valentin Lozinskiy, asked the
delay in light of ``negotiations on the political level which have
been recently occurring'' and to give the council more time to
reach consensus.
   The United States and eight other members voted to postpone;
four voted against; France and China abstained. The meeting was
postponed until Monday.
   Shevardnadze, who was in Washington on Wednesday meeting
separately with Israeli Premier Yitzhak Shamir and President Bush,
will meet Arafat on Friday in Ankara, Turkey, said diplomats,
speaking on condition of anonymity.
   PLO officials confirmed Shevardnadze would be meeting Arafat,
but declined to provide details.
   Shevardnadze will pressure Arafat to distance his Palestine
Liberation Organization from Iraq, which has been championing the
Palestinian homeland issue since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2.
   The delay will give the United States and the non-aligned
nations on the Security Council more time to try to work out a
compromise on the resolution on the Israeli-occupied territories.
   The United States has been struggling to remove from a Security
Council resolution language endorsing a Mideast peace conference,
fearing it would look like a concession to Iraq.
   Rumors circulated that the paragraph endorsing the conference
would be taken out of the resolution at America's insistence and
put in a separate, non-binding statement from the council
president.
   However, the Yemeni ambassador, who also is a co-sponsor of the
resolution, said, ``That has been a suggestion, but we have not
moved an inch.''
   When U.S. Ambassador Thomas R. Pickering was asked if any
understanding had been reached, he replied, ``Not that I know of.''
   The situation became more complicated Wednesday when France
announced it could not support any resolution that did not contain
the call for a peace conference. France did not indicate whether it
would cast a veto, however.
   A vote on the resolution has been put off six times in a week.
   Israel, the traditional U.S. ally in the Middle East, strongly
opposes any international peace conference that would encompass the
issue of Palestinians in occupied lands.
   The Israelis say they will not accept any imposed settlement,
and fear a peace conference would force them into a
``land-for-peace'' deal with their Arab neighbors. They want
bilateral talks with their Arab adversaries.
   The United States has been caught in a diplomatic bind.
   U.S. officials say they must veto the resolution if it endorses
the peace conference because it gives the appearance of linking
that issue with the Persian Gulf crisis.
   Iraqi President Saddam Hussein says he will withdraw from Kuwait
only in the context of a comprehensive Middle East peace conference
that would address all problems in the region.
   But U.S. officials fear a veto could weaken support from Arab
nations that joined the coalition against Iraq following its
invasion.

   A combination of faulty brakes and
insufficient warning caused a fiery interstate crash that killed
eight people, the lawyer for a trucker charged in the deaths said
Wednesday.
   Manuel Cruzado Jr., 26, of Buffalo, N.Y., went on trial
Wednesday in Magistrate Court on eight misdemeanor counts of
negligent homicide stemming from the July 26 accident on Interstate
79.
   The accident occurred because the brakes on Cruzado's
68,000-pound loaded car-carrier failed as he descended a
2-mile-long hill, rounded a blind curve and came upon stalled
traffic at a construction site that had closed the right lane of a
bridge, said Cruzado's attorney, Gary Collias.
   Prosecutor William Martin argued that Cruzado was going faster
than the 50 mph speed limit and ignored warning signs that started
more than a mile before the construction site. He also said Cruzado
had been behind the wheel without a break for a period longer than
allowed by federal regulations.
   A family of five from New York were killed when their car was
crushed between Cruzado's truck and a parked highway dump truck.
Three Fairmont residents were killed when a vehicle fell off
Cruzado's car-carrier atop their car.

   The Census Bureau has found at least 750,000
people it missed during the April 1 national head count, officials
said Wednesday.
   ``At this point we feel we have done a very thorough census,''
said Barbara Everitt Bryant, census director.
   More than 6,000 local governments have filed challenges saying
the census was inaccurate. They include all of the 51 largest
cities.
   ``Virtually everybody's count will go up,'' Bryant said.
   New York Mayor David Dinkins and William Althaus, mayor of York,
Pa., scheduled a meeting with Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher
to discuss correcting the count in major cities. The mayors
represent the U.S. Conference of Mayors.
   Bryant and Michael Darby, under secretary of commerce for
economic affairs, said the newly counted people were found through
five programs designed to check the census' accuracy.
   The Census Bureau compared its count against parole and
probation records; asked people to come forward if they were
missed; sent workers to recanvass some households that mailed in
forms to check the accuracy of the forms; sent canvassers to count
people in households that had not mailed a form back and checked
vacant and uninhabitable housing to see if someone lived there
after all.
   Officials refused to say exactly how many people had been added
since the April 1 count. They would say only how many people or
households had been checked under the programs and what percentage
had produced additions to the census.
   Bryant said the bureau checked 1.2 million parole and probation
records and found 34 percent should be aded to the initial count.
That's about 408,000 people.
   Most parolees and probationers are men in their 20s and 30s, the
bureau said.
   The bureau's ``Were You Counted'' program asked people to
contact the bureau if they thought they hadn't been counted. Nearly
166,000 responses produced additions to the census count, according
to Bryant's figures. Some responses may have added more than one
person.
   Also:
   -Workers found at least 125,000 missed households through
recanvassing.
   -Nearly 46,000 households thought to be vacant were found to
have residents.
   -Workers found people living in nearly 9,000 houses that were
thought to be uninhabitable.
   The newly counted people will be added to the preliminary U.S.
population count of 245.8 million.
   Census numbers are used to determine how many representatives a
state sends to Congress and how federal aid is divided among the
states.

<HEAD>Queen Elizabeth Holds Palace Ball to Mark Four Royal Birthdays</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   More than 800 guests attended a glittering ball
held by Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace on Wednesday night
toate the 90th birthday of her mother this year and three
other royal anniversaries in 1990.
   The ball marked the 90th birthday of Elizabeth the Queen Mother
on Aug. 4, the 60th birthday of the queen's sister Princess
Margaret on Aug. 21, the 40th birthday of the queen's daughter
Princess Anne on Aug. 15 and the 30th birthday of the queen's
second son Prince Andrew, the Duke of York, on Feb. 19.
   Guests at what the palace called ``the dance of the decades''
included personal friends of the royals from the arts, politics and
high society and scores of other celebrities and dignitaries.
   The palace in a brief statement described it as a private
function as opposed to a formal state occasion. Almost every member
of the royal family was present to welcome the guests.
   The British domestic news agency Press Association described it
as the biggest party at the palace since the one in November 1988
marking the 40th birthday of Prince Charles, the queen's eldest son
and heir to the throne.
   Guests held dinner parties at top restaurants throughout
London's West End before driving to the palace for the ball, which
began shortly after 10 p.m.
   Because of the large number of guests, the palace picture
gallery with its valuable collection of Old Master paintings was
transformed into a ballroom.
   Its gilded ceiling was hung with blue draperies and the gallery
was lit by a starry constellation of white lights. Drawing rooms
and and the music room leading from the gallery were filled with
huge arrangements of flowers.
   Guests included songwriter Tim Rice; singer Cleo Laine; Maj.
Ronald Ferguson, the father of Prince Andrew's wife the Duchess of
York, formerly Sarah Ferguson; Mark Thatcher, son of former Prime
Minister Margaret Thatcher, and Thatcher's American wife Diane.

   A judge Wednesday ordered the man charged in the
assassination of Rabbi Meir Kahane to be removed from Bellevue
Hospital and returned to Rikers Island jail.
   The judge, Ira Gammerman, ruled that El Sayyid Nosair's wounds
and other ailments were not serious enough to keep him at Bellevue,
as his lawyer, Michael Warren, had requested.
   ``You don't have to keep a patient in a hospital because he has
wax in his ears and stiffness in his neck,'' Gammerman said.
   He said Nosair could be treated at the hospital as an
out-patient.
   Nosair, 35, an Egyptian immigrant who lives in Cliffside Park,
N.J., was shot in the neck by a federal officer Nov. 5 as he fled
the Manhattan hotel where he allegedly shot Kahane to death after
the Zionist rabbi had given a speech.
   The judge ordered an examination of Nosair by a private doctor
after Warren disputed a Bellevue report that his client could
return to the jail's general population. Warren charged that the
city doctor was biased.
   Bail of $300,000 for Nosair was suspended and a hearing to set a
new bail scheduled for Dec. 18.

Wednesday.
   ``We're doing good,'' said Melanie Mowry, a spokeswoman for the
state Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services.
   The advisories recommended that people stay indoors in the
evening when the mosquitoes were active. Although they have been
lifted, people should still use insect repellent and wear long
pants and sleeves, Ms. Mowry said. She added that overnight camping
should be delayed for a couple more weeks.
   On Wednesday, the number of confirmed cases in Florida stood at
153 and presumptive cases - people who have tested positive in one
of two tests needed for confirmation - at 56.
   No one has reported symptoms starting after Nov. 16, Ms. Mowry
said. And only three cases have developed in the last five weeks.
   Since the flu-like illness, which can turn fatal with brain
inflammation, was first reported in mid-August, eight deaths have
been reported.

<TEXT>
   A 22-year-old rancher's son confessed
Wednesday that he killed famed rainforest activist Chico Mendes,
bringing a surprising end to the opening session of the murder
trial.
   Darci Alves Pereira stunned a packed courtroom by admitting he
shot Mendes on Dec. 22, 1988, shortly after dark outside his home
in this remote Amazon town near Bolivia's border, 2,650 miles
northwest of Rio de Janeiro.
   Pereira's confession came minutes after he had twice denied
shooting Mendes, who was one of Brazil's most outspoken critics of
development of the Amazon basin. Mendes' case has reached such
proportions that film producers and authors have besieged his widow
with competing offers to tell his story.
   Pereira, whose father also is charged with plotting the murder
of the noted ecologist, faces a 12- to 30-year sentence. Sentencing
is expected on Thursday.
   The trial had drawn worldwide attention as a test of Brazil's
commitment to protecting its rainforests against encroachment and
to meting out equal justice for rich and poor.
   Mendes, who defended the rainforest from landowners and ranchers
who wanted to cut it down to develop the fragile Amazonian basin,
has become a symbol of Brazil's impoverished.
   Ilzamar Mendes, widow of Chico Mendes, was sitting in the
gallery when the confession occurred. She clapped her hands in
surprise.
   ``He confessed?'' she asked incredulously. ``It's hard to
believe.''
   She added, ``He's probably doing it to protect his father.''
   Pereira's father, rancher Darly Alves da Silva, also is on trial
on charges of planning the shooting. He pleaded innocent.
   Mendes had repeatedly told police that da Silva was plotting to
kill him, after rubber tappers prevented the rancher from clearing
a tract of rainforest.
   The trial began at 9 a.m. A boy picked the names of seven jurors
out of a hat containing 21 slips of paper with local resident's
names written on them.
   Outside, two dozen state police in army camouflage pants and
bulletproof vests stood guard with submachine guns and pistols.
Officials feared violence between rubber tappers and gunmen
reportedly hired by ranchers.
   The 240 officials, politicians, family members, and journalists
allowed in were frisked before entering the 36-by-48-foot
courtroom.
   Four state troopers led in the defendants, who sat staring down
as the charges were read.
   Da Silva, 54, wearing an unbuttoned blue shirt, slacks and thick
glasses, was called to the bench. He denied accusations he plotted
Mendes' death and had ordered his son to carry it out.
   Then Pereira approached the bench and also denied the murder
charge against him. He claimed he was in another town when Mendes
was killed.
   The short, muscular Pereira was shown evidence found by police
near where Mendes' killer hid: a 16-gauge shotgun, a black nylon
raincoat, a burlap sack, two bottles and cigrette cartons. Asked
if he recognized the items, Pereira shook his head.
   Then, as bailiffs were leading Pereira from the courtoom, Judge
Adair Longhini leaned over the bench and asked again if the
defendant committed the crime.
   Pereira paused, stared at Longhini and said, ``I confess.''
   ``What?'' said the judge. ``You killed Chico Mendes?``
   ``I shot him, yes,'' Pereira said.
   There was turmoil among the 240 observers packed into the tiny
wooden courtroom. Longhini called for order.
   Speaking softly and slowly, Pereira recounted in chilling detail
how he carried out the murder.
   On the afternoon of the killing, Pereira said, he picked up a
shotgun loaded with one cartridge at his father's Parana ranch 7
miles outside Xapuri and rode his motorcycle into town ``with the
intention of killing.''
   ``I was alone,'' he said. ``No one else was involved.''
   Pereira said he waited for nightfall and then walked along the
Acre River that runs behind Mendes house. Shortly before 7 p.m., he
crept into Mendes' yard through an open gate and waited.
   Ten minutes later, he said, Mendes emerged from the back door,
reportedly to go to a shack in the rear of the yard to go to the
bathroom.
   ``I saw his face in the light of the lamp he held,'' Pereira
said. ``I raised the gun and squeezed the trigger. I did not see
him fall, I was already walking back along the river.''
   He did not say why he reversed his plea of innocence.
   However, Marcio Thomaz Bastos, chief lawyer for the prosecution,
said the confession was a planned maneuver to spare his father.
   ``Darci is being an obedient son,'' Bastos said during a break.
``His father told him to kill, and he killed. Now he told Darci to
lie, and he's lying to protect his father.''
   Bastos hopes to convict the elder rancher on the strength of
testimony from a 15-year-old boy who worked on da Silva's ranch.
The boy will reportedly testify da Silva threw a party the night
after the killing, in celebration.
   Defense lawyer Ruben Lopes Torres said he was ``completely
surprised'' by the confession.
   ``Until the moment he confessed I didn't think he committed the
crime,'' said Torres. ``Darci's decision to say `I killed Chico
Mendes' was completely his own.''
   Pereira and his father, who also faces prison terms of 12 to 30
years, are not eligible for bail because both face charges for
other killings.
   Ilzamar Mendes, in a yellow T-shirt stamped with Chico Mendes'
face, concluded, ``We believed in justice.''
   The town had a festive atmosphere after hearing the news, people
celebrating with glasses of rum-like cachaca in the town's
tree-lined streets.

   A federal judge Wednesday blocked
Friday's scheduled execution of a convicted murderer.
   U.S. District Judge Henry Mentz set a Jan. 2 hearing to examine
conflicts in the record of the trial of Robert Sawyer, 40.
   Earlier Wednesday, the State Pardon Board refused to recommend
that Gov. Buddy Roemer commute Sawyer's sentence to life in prison.
   Sawyer and Charles Lane were convicted in 1980 of the murder of
Frances Arwood of Avondale. They were accused of beating and raping
Arwood and setting her on fire after a night of drinking.
   Sawyer was sentenced to die in the electric chair. Lane was
given a life sentence.

<TEXT>
   The ax fell Wednesday on NBC's ``Grand,''
``Ferris Bueller'' and ``Parenthood'' series and on the year-old
cable talk show of Morton Downey Jr. on NBC-owned CNBC.
   NBC also announced three new series that it said will join its
prime-time schedule in January: ``Dark Shadows,'' a new version of
the old daytime gothic horror series; ``Blossom,'' a comedy; and
``Sunday Best,'' a one-hour Sunday series that uses new material
and clips from existing NBC shows.
   CNBC's ``Downey'' cancellation marked the second time since 1989
the aggressive talk-show host has gotten the chop. His syndicated,
confrontational-style ``The Morton Downey Jr. Show'' was dropped
after a two-year run.
   ``We're sorry to see him go,'' said Susan Greene, an NBC
vice-president for business development. But CNBC is revamping its
prime time lineup and `` `Downey' does not fit in with the
direction we're taking,'' she said.
   NBC's ``Grand'' was in its second season. The low-rated ``Ferris
Bueller'' and ``Parenthood,'' each based on movies, were in their
first season. The premiere dates for the new shows will be
announced shortly, NBC said.

   Japan and Germany, two of the world's leading
economic powers, have delivered barely one-fifth of the money and
materials they promised in support of U.S. military operations in
the Persian Gulf, the Pentagon says.
   Of the six countries that offered the largest contributions to
Operation Desert Shield at its outset in August, only Kuwait has
given all that it promised, Pete Williams, the chief Pentagon
spokesman, said Tuesday.
   Williams declined to comment on the reasons for the delayed
contributions from other allies. Pledges totaling more than $6.5
billion were made for calendar year 1990.
   The spokesman said the United States plans to ask an undisclosed
number of allied nations to increase their contributions for 1991.
He said he did not know how much money would be sought or when the
requests would be made.

   VIENNA, Austria (AP) - Challenged by three straight days of
student protests, Albania's Communist leadership has promised to
allow competing political parties and fired five members of the
ruling Politburo.
   The actions Tuesday appeared to signal a major defeat for
Communist hard-liners in Europe's last bastion of Stalinist rule,
which President Ramiz Alia has described as being on the verge of
economic disaster.
   The Balkan nation of 3.1 million, which opened its borders
slightly this year after decades of isolationism under the late
Enver Hoxha, would be the last country in Europe to introduce a
multiparty system.
   Alia met with student representatives in Tirana late Tuesday and
said the government is willing open up a dialogue. He also urged
them to return to classes or ``incidents which nobody desires could
occur.''

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir says his
meeting with President Bush went a long way toward calming his
fears about the steadfastness of U.S. support for Israel.
   But his problems may not be over: Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard
A. Shevardnadze wants to talk to him about agreeing to an
international Mideast peace conference, a concept that is anathema
to Shamir.
   Shevardnadze and Shamir meet in Washington tonight, and their
talks are expected to focus on the Persian Gulf crisis and on the
flood of Jews emigrating from the Soviet Union to Israel.
   Shevardnadze met earlier this week in Houston with Secretary of
State James A. Baker III. The two decided to head back to
Washington on Tuesday night instead of today, partly to give
Shevardnadze time to see Shamir, said U.S. officials who spoke on

   MOSCOW (AP) - The Communist Party used to advertise itself as
the ``conscience of the nation.'' By the time Andrei Sakharov died,
that title was more commonly accorded to him.
   Since the physicist and political activist's death a year ago
this Friday, friends and colleagues in the human rights movement
have battled for Sakharov's cause. But they say no one has emerged
to take his place.
   ``The conscience of the nation - that has remained a vacant
position,'' said Sergei Grigoryants, editor of the unofficial
journal Glasnost and one of many former political prisoners who
Sakharov pressured the government to free.
   Since Sakharov died of heart failure at age 68, public esteem
has continued to climb for the man who helped invent the Soviet
hydrogen bomb and later won the Nobel Peace Prize.

<HEAD>Taxes a Never-Ending Problem for Politicians</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>PINEHURST, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>

   There's a one-word diagnosis for the
headache issue politicians can't seem to shake, and the word is
taxes. That chronic problem is worsened by voter suspicion that 49
cents of every tax dollar goes to waste.
   Pollsters and Republican political consultants warned GOP
governors here that the budget and tax dilemma most states face is
likely to deepen before the next elections. They urged the
executives to start dealing with it early, to ease the sting before
the 1992 campaign season.
   ``There's no place for a governor to hide,'' said Richard
Wirthlin, who conducts polls for the White House. He said the
governors should shape clear strategies for handling the budget
squeeze and the tax issue, and tell their constituents about it.
   Wirthlin said a poll his organization conducted in September
found that the average American believes that local, state and
federal governments waste 49 cents of every dollar taxpayers send
them.
   Eighty-two percent of the people think government wastes the
money it gets, Wirthlin said.
   ``That's a presumption as a governor that you've got to take on
and take on very directly,'' he told the Republican governors
conference this week.
   The peril in taxes hardly came as a surprise to the governors.
Fourteen states switched party control in gubernatorial elections
this year. In almost every case, when incumbents or their parties
lost, taxes were a factor.
   Surveys by Wirthlin after the Nov. 6 elections showed that among
people who made their choice on the basis of a single issue, 9
percent said the issue was taxes. Only 1 percent of single-issue
voters were swayed by taxes in the prior election.
   Neal Newhouse, an analyst with the Wirthlin organization, said
that when the question before the voters is whether or not to
increase taxes, Republicans hold the advantage - but when it
becomes what taxes ought to be raised, the edge shifts to
Democrats.
   Congressional Democrats succeeded in shaping the issue of
federal taxes into a debate about fairness, accusing the Bush
administration of seeking tax breaks for the rich.
   ``When it's tax versus no tax, Republicans win,'' Newhouse said.
   But that may not be the question in the next two years, with the
economy slipping, state revenues declining and no help in sight
from a strapped federal government. Indeed, the governors
complained that Washington is increasing the burden on their
treasuries with laws that mandate state spending.
   ``They say, `where's the money coming from?' '' Vice President
Dan Quayle said after conferring with the governors.
   Winding up their conference on Tuesday, the GOP governors said
they want President Bush to know that they are frustrated about
program mandates they blame on Congress, and want him to do
something.
   Gov. Carroll A. Campbell of South Carolina, their new chairman,
said federal requirements that force state spending on health care
and the like are taking money away from education and other vital
programs, and governors are frustrated by it.
   ``Our message to the president is please stop it, use your
veto,'' said Gov. Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin.
   Federally mandated spending is a longstanding complaint of
governors in both parties. It irks them more in a time of strained
budgets, when some of them may be forced to seek tax increases
despite the political peril.
   ``When you get into the tax issue, be sure you know which taxes
are supported and which are not,'' Wirthlin told the governors,
``because that is in fact very dangerous ground.''
   Linda DiVall, president of American Viewpoint, Inc., said
governors should cover that territory as early in the election
cycle as they can, explaining to constituents as they do so.
   ``And do it again and again and again,'' she said. ``... The tax
issue is still incredibly strong.''

<HEAD>Presbyterian Look at Critics Finds They're Appreciated</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Checking up on an organization that has been a
persistent and cutting critic, the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)
found that many members seem to appreciate the onslaughts.
   This has been somewhat of a stunner for church leaders. But in
the denomination's open operating style, it laid the matter all out
plainly.
   Responses ran nearly 3-to-1 in support of the dissenting
organization, the Presbyterian Lay Committee, said the Rev. James
V. Johnson Jr., chairman of a special committee set up to look into
the group's ways.
   ``It would be accurate to say that the special committee has
been very surprised by the breadth and depth of support'' for the
group, he added.
   The Presbyterian Lay Committee, based in Springfield, Pa.,
consists of an 18-member board of directors, which puts out a
bimonthly newspaper, The Presbyterian Layman. It reports a
circulation of 400,000 and regularly assails church policies and
programs.
   Charging that the denomination supports leftist and socialist
causes and views, the editor, J. Robert Campbell, said the church
should stay out of politics and stick to its ``unique mission.''
That is ``the proclamation of the Gospel and making of disciples,''
he said in a telephone interview.
   He said the church findings mean ``the denominational leaders
have refused to listen to people out across the church. There's a
tremendous gap between what the denominational leaders think and
what the people in the pews think.''
   Victor Jameson, editor of the denomination's monthly,
Presbyterian Survey, based in Louisville, Ky., interprets the
findings quite differently.
   ``Our people have a kind of feeling that everybody should have
their say, even if they don't like what's said and even if it's
wrong and ought not to be said,'' he said.
   The special committee set up by the church's 1989 governing
assembly to check into relationships with the Presbyterian Lay
Committee solicited responses from the church-at-large.
   Sixty percent of about 200 responses considered the criticizing
group ``a valuable voice of dissent in the church, even though it
tends to overdo it,'' Johnson said.
   He said 10 percent supported the paper without reservation and
30 percent considered it harmful to the church. Johnson said the
committee also received more than 6,000 pre-printed forms
distributed by the critical group that supported it.
   In testimony to Johnson's committee, elected national assembly
representatives, serving in five program areas, charged the lay
committee's paper with errors, misstatements and personal attacks.
   The 3 million-member denomination's representative assembly
repeatedly has objected to the group's fund-raising methods and
charged journalistic excesses and unauthorized use of church
mailing lists.
   Editor Campbell said his group supplied material to John S.
Tomkins, a Presbyterian layman and author of an article in the
current Reader's Digest sharply critical of his denomination and
some other Protestant bodies.
   Also credited as a source for the article is the
Washington-based Institute on Religion and Democracy, a backer of
conservative causes.
   Like the critical Presbyterian lay organization, Tomkins charges
that bureaucrats have taken over the denominations and that a wide
gulf exists between the bureaucrats and average parishioners.
   The Rev. S. David Stoner of Louisville, executive director of
the Presbyterian General Assembly Council, said both the Institute
on Religion and Democracy and the dissenting Presbyterian group
have ``strongly political agendas of their own.''
   He said Tomkins has a right and duty to state where he thinks
the institutional church has erred, but those disagreeing have a
similar duty to clarify the facts.
   Rebutting the contention that bureaucrats have taken over the
denominations and are out of touch with church members, Stoner
cites the Presbyterians' democratic processes. He said members
elect their representatives who choose their leaders and said staff
are hired using carefully set guidelines.
   He also challenged Tomkin's implication that mainline churches
are losing many members to conservative churches.
   ``Scientific surveys conducted in recent years indicate that
very few former members of mainline churches have left to join
conservative churches,'' he said. ``Most members who leave are lost
not to conservatism but to non-affiliation with any church.''
   The special Presbyterian committee, set up to consult with the
dissenting group and discuss its asserted refusal to comply with
denominational guidelines for special organizations, is to make its
final report to the 1991 assembly in June.
   Johnson said some things his committee learned so far are:
   - There is a ``widespread feeling in the church'' that the
criticizing group ``performs a useful function as a dissenting
voice,'' but many who see its value ``have questioned its
journalistic tactics.''
   - There is a compelling need for the church to ``work for
reconciliation among various factions in the church who do not
trust and are afraid of each other.''

   It's not like Nancy Drew or The Hardy Boys.
They're detectives. They chase bad guys and drive cars.
   The girls in the Baby Sitters Club books mostly just have
trouble with neighborhood snobs, bullies or, maybe, parents.
   Author Ann M. Martin's characters - seven distinctly different
girls who form a baby-sitting cooperative - are like friends to
11-year-old Lynette Kirkman and other admirers of the series, which
has put into print 41 million books over the last four years.
   ``The books are about being a normal kid today,'' said Lynette,
of Bristol, Pa. ``They talk about real life and things.''
   Being a kid today can be tough. Parents get divorced, and
sometimes they marry other people. Then you have two families. Or
maybe you move, or a grandparent dies, or your father loses his
job. It gets complicated.
   ``So when you're having problems with your parents or there's
something you don't understand, it helps to have a friend around,''
said Megan Brown, 13, of Indianapolis.
   Into each story are integrated situations that reflect life as
it really is lived across America, and that includes elements such
as stepfamilies, working mothers, death, adoption and friends or
relatives with disabilities.
   The girls also encounter all sorts of smaller prepubescent woes
in each monthly addition to the 43-book series.
   ``And if I can believe what the kids write to me, they are
responding to ... the realism. Kids will write and say, `I really
enjoy your books because I can identify with the characters,'''
Martin said.
   Martin, 35, who lives in New York City with a cat named Mouse,
plays it straight with her mostly 8- to 12-year-old readers. She
doesn't talk down to them or gloss over difficult topics.
   ``More kids today have been exposed to divorce ... or moved
around a lot. They start watching television at an earlier age and
watch things that are more sophisticated than what we watched at an
early age,'' she said.
   Jean Feiwel, editorial director at Scholastic Inc., came up with
the series idea about five years ago, melding young girls' dual
passion for books about clubs and books about baby-sitting.
   The formula was an instant hit that has topped chain store
best-seller lists of children's books 90 percent of the time since
the first title appeared in August 1986. Two home videos also are
on the market.
   ``It's one of the most successful series for children ever,''
said Diane Roback, children's book editor at Publishers Weekly.
``And I don't see any signs of its popularity diminishing.''
   Meanwhile, the imaginary town of Stoneybrook, Conn., has become
a pre-teen's fictional mecca, the place where the Baby Sitters Club
meets three times a week to accept clients' phone calls and review
sticky situations.
   ``Like in No. 10 - well, maybe not No. 10 - but in one of the
books, one of the kids they baby-sit for gets a hand stuck down the
drain in the bathroom tub,'' offers 8-year-old Marian Walsh of
Watertown, Conn.
   ``My favorite one is `Boy-Crazy tacey,' where she goes
baby-sitting at the beach and gets crushes on all the boys,'' says
11-year-old Melonie Marnien of Bristol, Pa. ``That was really
funny.''
   A lot of girls like Stacey the best. In fact, in a Baby Sitters
Club Super Special Contest, 27,000 fans cast their votes for the
sophisticated, clotheshorse who moved to Connecticut from New York
City.
   But others prefer Claudia (slightly insecure and artistic), Dawn
(an ex-Californian who shuns junk food), Kristy (the bossy club
president based on one of Martin's close childhood friends), Mary
Anne (a shy and responsible girl based on the author herself),
Mallory (a would-be children's books author from a big family) or
Jessica (an outgoing black ballet dancer).
   ``I just love them so much ... because you think these girls
could be you in a few years,'' enthused Marian, who hopes to start
baby-sitting when she gets a little older. ``You'd never think of
Pippy Longstocking as a baby sitter.''
   Adds Marian's 10-year-old neighbor, Carla Oliva: ``They're not
just books to read for enjoyment. They teach you a lot of things .
.. like how life is different for different people and how to get
along with each other.''
   Although Martin weaves serious themes into her books, she
chooses not to address such weighty topics as sexual or substance
abuse of any kind.
   It's not that the issues shouldn't be dealt with, the author
said.
   ``I think there are a lot of girls who would benefit from
reading about (them), but there are also first-graders out there
who are reading these books and those subjects are too heavy for
them,'' she said.
   So Martin sticks to more manageable problems, including the
perennial trials of youth:
   ``Questions about their self-esteem, their self-worth. How
important is it to be pretty, to be popular? All sorts of things
that we worried about when we were younger. I don't think those
things ever change.''

<HEAD>Another Marilyn Monroe Documentary At Large</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY SHARBUTT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Television Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Wowee, the Fox network tonight is showing a
special about Marilyn Monroe, ``Marilyn: Something's Got to Give.''
Now the bad news. It may be to documentaries what ``Ishtar'' was to
film comedies.
   Oh, sure, it's daring. Not many Marilyn Monroe documentaries,
for example, would put on the screen a slide identifying an
interviewee as MONROE'S PSYCHIATRIST'S DAUGHTER.
   Not many, either, would come right out and say the late actress
was ``said to be having an affair'' with President John F. Kennedy.
   And not many would disclose that the troubled actress, said to
have committed suicide in 1962, often was absent from what proved
her last movie and ``one morning she nearly fainted under a
hairdryer and had to go home.''
   But then, this report on her sad last months and the film, the
never-finished ``Something's Got to Give,'' is the very first
documentary by Fox Entertainment News and must do something to
stand out.
   FEN is Fox's new show-biz news unit. It has vowed to do far more
than puff pieces. We should believe them because they say it is so.
   Tonight's grand opening includes the famous scenes of Monroe
cavorting nude - no bare bosoms are sighted - in a sound-stage
swimming pool at 20th Century Fox studios.
   The show is written and narrated by Henry Schipper, who is very
earnest and carries on as if chronicling Important Stuff, which is
refreshing in this era of TV reporters who smile a lot.
   (A former print reporter of entertainment news, he has a new
book due out soon - ``Bridge Over Troubled Water: An Inside History
of The Grammy Awards.'')
   Schipper appears to be a fan of Monroe, who would be 64 now had
she not died at 36 and made it kind of impossible to press on.
   His thesis is that she wasn't a drug-wracked wreck, as is
commonly thought, when fired from ``Give'' after eight weeks of
filming. She even was quietly re-hired later, he reports, so nyah,
nyah, nyah.
   Early on, he discloses that she had her personal demons, but as
accompanying clips of her screen tests show, she also was ``working
hard as an actress and lighting up the screen as only she could.''
   ``To the very end, Marilyn Monroe had a beauty and a sensual
glow that no other actress could touch.''
   Schipper gets a seconding motion from a film editor who worked
on ``Give,'' a light-hearted sex comedy. Says the editor: ``She was
like a goddess. ... She looked absolutely beautiful.''
   Moving right along, Schipper also interviews various others who
worked on the film, up to and including the producer.
   But perhaps the show's main value, such as it is, is the footage
from ``Give'' that had been thought destroyed.
   The, er, historic shots of a mostly happy, radiant Monroe
include her with two kids who played her children - they're
interviewed, too - and with Jess, a poodle hired for the film. Jess
keeps forgetting to bark on cue.
   The off-screen dog trainer is heard to snap: ``Jess, speak!
Speak! Jess, speak!''
   It is a high moment in the show, better even than the
nude-Monroe swimming scenes, which seem quite modest now but wowed
'em in '62.
   She was said to have had a cold when she did the scene, but was
a trouper, Schipper says, asserting that ``although her four hours
in the pool had aggravated her virus, Marilyn continued to work,
and work well.''
   The other highlights in the show include Schipper's report that
Monroe's absences from ``Give,'' its ensuing budget overruns, and
the studio's bloated ``Cleopatra'' caused stern measures to be
taken at Fox.
   Not only were other productions stopped, but the watering of
lawns on the lot was halted, and the studio commissary was - gasp -
shut down.
   Despite such fascinating reportage, Fox's Monroe special just
doesn't turn up anything scandalous, or even exciting.
   Schipper tries hard, by golly. But when he concludes that the
poor lady ``was a scapegoat for Hollywood's dying studio system''
and ``was not an assembly-line star,'' well ...
   Better he had devoted the entire hour to insights about the
actress from Monroe's Psychiatrist's Daughter.
   ---
   Elsewhere in television ...
   THE AXMAN COMETH: As expected, NBC's new based-on-a-movie
series, ``Ferris Bueller'' and ``Parenthood,'' have been axed, as
has the second-season ``Grand.'' Three newcomers are due January on
NBC: ``Dark Shadows,'' a new version of the old gothic horror
series, ``Blossom,'' a sitcom about a teen-age girl who lives with
two older brothers and her divorced father, and ``Sunday Best.''
   The last, the latest hopeful opposite CBS' toprated ``60
Minutes,'' is billed as a one-hour ``topical and comedic magazine
show featuring mostly original material.'' It also will offer
``select clips of NBC programs.'' Oh, boy, a new art form:
minireruns.
   On the bright side, CBS' ``Lonesome Dove'' miniseries, which
became the nation's 14th most-watched show of its kind when aired
last February, will be rerun Jan. 20 and 22-24.

<HEAD>New Leading Economic Indicator: Jobless Insurance for Homeowners</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID E. KALISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   First they bought a piece of property. Now, as
fears of joblessness spread, homeowners are being urged to buy some
peace of mind.
   More and more lenders have been trying to sell coverage to
homeowners that promises to pay monthly mortgage bills in the event
of a job loss.
   The new insurance pitch, appearing in glossy brochures recently
mailed out by banks to prospective and current homeowners, is one
of the latest leading indicators of today's rising unemployment.
   The Labor Department reported last week that the nation's
jobless rate shot up to a three-year high of 5.9 percent in
November.
   ``We're getting swamped now with requests from all over for the
coverage,'' said Richard T. Harris, president of Morgard Inc., of
St. Davids, which is one of the largest insurance agencies offering
this sort of coverage.
   Roughly 40 banks and mortgage companies recently began marketing
the new insurance, he said, including Chase Manhattan Corp.,
Shearson Lehman Bros.' mortgage division and California Federal
Savings  Loan.
   For years banks have offered consumers the chance to buy
insurance that covered the minimum balance on their monthly credit
card bills in the event of unemployment, death or disability.
   Banks say the new mortgage coverage is good for them as well as
mortgage holders - protecting the bank's monthly loan payments and
guarding a homeowner's most valuable asset against foreclosure.
   But consumer groups, who have vigorously criticized credit card
insurance as a high-profit product that costs consumers too much,
say that homeowners should approach the new mortgage insurance with
similar caution.
   ``We found that various forms of mortgage insurance are priced
extremely high and are one of the primary methods banks are making
their profits,'' said Peggy Miller of the Washington-based Consumer
Federation of America.
   Miller said the group had not yet studied the new unemployment
insurance offerings. But, she added, prospective homeowners are
particularly vulnerable to buying insurance without shopping around
because they are ``extremely worried about getting a mortgage.''
   Morgard said it graduates rates according to the occupation and
geographic location of the policy holder. Its insurance is
underwritten by large insurance firms, including Montgomery Ward
Insurance Co.
   Using monthly reports from the U.S. Labor Department, Morgard
deems some occupations and locations riskier than others in terms
of their job-loss potential and raises rates accordingly, Harris
said.
   Morgard's average national rate is 3 percent of a homeowners
monthly mortgage payment, he said. For a homeowner with a monthly
payment of $1,000, that would mean an insurance premium of around
$30 a month.
   However, some consumer groups said the window through which
policy holders can collect seemed narrow. For example, the
insurance doesn't begin paying benefits until 31 days after the
homeowner becomes unemployed, or the second mortgage payment.
   If the homeowner becomes unemployed within 90 days following the
inception of coverage, benefits are limited to a refund of
premiums. After the second year of coverage, the 90-day cap is
eliminated.
   Coverage also is limited to a year of monthly payments and a
maximum of $2,500.
   Considering the payback, ``it's a fairly high premium,'' said
Robert Hunter, president of National Insurance Consumer
Organization. He said that it made sense for homeowners who are
``very high risk for losing your job and are not going to get laid
off too soon but maybe some day.''
   Harris expects 5 percent to 8 percent of Chase's roughly 200,000
mortgage holders to sign up for the insurance. Initial mailings
went out to 30,000 Chase customers on Dec. 1.
   Harris said the bank's profit on the premium was minimal, with
commissions averaging 5 percent to 10 percent of the premium and
usually covering only the bank's cost of adminstering the
insurance.

   Lena Olin was a tomboy. She didn't want to be
pretty. She cut her hair short and refused to wear dresses. She
preferred sports to dolls and fighting to tea parties.
   She changed once she turned 13 - no one who's seen ``The
Unbearable Lightness of Being'' and ``Enemies, A Love Story'' would
question that. But watch those films, the way she uncorks a wine
bottle with her teeth or the erotic tension between Olin and other
women and you'll see a masculine spirit that runs much deeper than
a bowler hat.
   And she hasn't stopped looking for new ways to bring that
quality into her professional life. As a Swedish actress, she's
been compared to Garbo, but when Olin speaks of tackling classic
roles it's not only ``Camille'' that's on her mind.
   ``One of my first stage parts was in a comedy called `Able
Drugger,' an English comedy,'' Olin, dressed in jeans and a simple,
white blouse, recalled in a recent interview. ``I played a man and
I enjoyed that. I very much would like to play a man. I'd like to
do `Hamlet.'''
   Hamlet is a tragic male, incapable of making up his mind. But
Olin might be too tough as the Danish prince. Her characters -
Sabina in ``The Unbearable Lightness of Being'' and Masha in
``Enemies, A Love Story'' - are erotic cynics: intelligent,
complex, highly sexual, painfully self-aware.
   There's something otherwordly about them; they're objects of
desire yet very much alone. They make their own rules. Fair play no
longer matters; they've been hurt too often.
   Sabina is an avant-garde artist living in Czechoslovakia during
the 1968 uprising, a free spirit in an oppressed country, the
mistress of a seductive doctor who can make tugging a curtain seem
pornographic. Masha, for which Olin received an Academy Award
nomination for best supporting actress, is an embittered Holocaust
survivor, a force of life but an even stronger force of death.
   In ``Havana,'' her new film, Olin plays Roberta Duran, a Swede
trapped in a ``Casablanca''-like love triangle, torn between
American playboy-gambler Robert Redford and Cuban revolutionary
Raul Julia. Roberta - or Bobbi as she's called -is somewhat softer
than Masha or Sabina. She's more passive, easier to manipulate and,
for Olin, an easier person to like.
   ``Sabina's so bored with life, so fed up with life,'' Olin said.
``And Masha's so distraught. She was hard to live with. I like to
be able to close the door to the studio, but it's very difficult
with some characters. I also felt very vulnerable when I did Bobbi.
I wanted to be good when I did Bobbi, and I kept that with me.
   ``Masha was very hard to come back to every night, to sleep with
every night. You touch areas in yourself that I don't think are
very healthy to touch.''
   Olin, 35, was born in Stockholm. Her parents were actors, her
father, Stij Olin, appearing in Ingmar Bergman's classic ``The
Seventh Seal.'' But they divorced when she was little and for all
her all spirit, she remembered herself as self-conscious and
insecure, more at home with inner thoughts than with the outside
world.
   ``I was a weird child and I still see things differently,'' she
recalled in a soft voice, smiling shyly. ``I always remember very
strange things. I have a capacity to walk in an apartment where
there are boxes and papers, and someone will say, `Excuse the boxes
and papers.' And I'll say, `Oh, I didn't see that.' I think I
concentrate on other things, small things that can be revealing.''
   Acting was the perfect way to express herself, and at age 20
Olin entered the Royal Dramatic Theater School, joining Bergman's
famed company of players. On stage, she starred in the plays of
Shakespeare, Strindberg and Chekhov and she also worked with
Bergman on films, appearing in ``After the Rehearsal'' and ``Fanny
and Alexander.''
   Olin sees nothing peculiar or silly about her tomboy roots. It
was a phase to build upon rather than outgrow, a yearning to be in
touch with all sides of herself, a rebellion against the rules that
men and women are supposed to obey that went beyond mere
role-playing.
   ``If I ever had a daughter I'd bring her up the same way,
encourage her to do what I did,'' said Olin, a single mother whose
son, August, is named after Strindberg.
   ``I think it's important for everyone to stay open, not to be
afraid, and if you push that way, I think that makes a difference
for an actor. The great thing about Marlin Brando, he's very macho
and all of that, but there's a huge woman in there as well.''

<HEAD>CDs: Perfect Sound, Forever? Collectors Disagree</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Victor Bisio doesn't consider himself a fanatic
about music, even if he does own some 10,000 albums and 2,500
compact discs.
   But when he buys CDs, he expects them to live up to their
original slogan - ``perfect sound, forever.'' No pops. No hisses.
No scratches. Music that brings you right in the studio.
   That's why Bisio's massive collection includes a credit slip,
good for three albums, from Columbia Records. The slip arrived last
summer, a few months after he had purchased CDs of Barbra
Streisand's first three records.
   ``There had been mention from Columbia that they couldn't find
the original tapes but they put out the CDs anyway,'' said Bisio, a
recording engineer who lives in Encino, Calif. ``They were are the
worst sounding CDs I ever heard. They were screechy and distorted.
When she hit the high notes, it just shattered your speakers.''
   Compact discs arrived in the mid-1980s, and pushed LPs out of
stores. Since then, Bisio and other collectors have spent long
hours comparing notes and keeping the pressure on record companies.
   Phil Cohen, a Florida collector who owns over 6,000 records,
bought the CD of Jimi Hendrix's ``Electric Ladyland'' three times
before he found a satisfactory copy. Background noise made some
tracks on James Taylor's ``Sweet Baby James'' virtually
unlistenable for another collector.
   Collectors blame CD problems on laziness and greed, insisting
records made from inferior tapes were rushed onto the market and
that songs were shortened or eliminated to fit albums on single
discs. The record companies admit mistakes, but say some problems
were unavoidable in switching from LPs to CDs.
   ``In the beginning, at least, for the people who were asked to
handle it, it took a little bit more understanding of technology
than to just say, `Pull this tape and have it mastered,''' said
Bill Levinson, director of catalog development at PolyGram Records.
   ``We had a handful of records, (Eric Clapton's) `461 Ocean
Boulevard,' that were just not done from correct tapes. The `461'
record was bad enough that we put out a new one, and I told people
in the press that we had done it.''
   Among the worst CDs:
   -Fleetwood Mac's ``Rumours.'' A multiplatinum record originally
released in the mid-1970s, it was pressed by Warner Bros. Records a
decade later from an old production tape and the result was a
muffled, badly distorted CD. A dramatically improved version was
later released.
   -The Jefferson Airplane's ``After Bathing at Baxter's'' was
released in such poor condition that RCA Records apologized,
remastered the tape and offered an exchange.
   Collectors also had complaints about albums by Elton John, Simon
and Garfunkel, Boz Scaggs, Jimmy Buffett, Carly Simon and Yes.
Harry Chapin's ``Verities and Balderdash'' come without the booklet
of photos and lyrics that was included on the LP; Gordon
Lightfoot's ``Gord's Gold'' was minus a song available on the LP.
   ``There are some companies where no one in the music department
makes the decision,'' Levinson said. ``Someone at the managerial
desk says, `These next six ones are for reissue because the
computer says these are the ones to go.' Maybe they're good, maybe
they're not.''
   Artists are beginning to take an active interest. John Arrias,
Streisand's personal engineer, put together remastered versions of
her first three records, which have not yet been released.
Guitarist Jimmy Page was so unhappy with the condition of several
Led Zeppelin CDs released by Atlantic Records he went back to the
studio and helped produce a box set. The Bee Gees consulted with
PolyGram on a recent anthology which collectors say is very good.
   And Columbia, which received the most criticism from collectors,
started Columbia-Legacy Records this year. Legacy has already put
out well-received box sets of blues great Robert Johnson and the
Byrds, made with the assistance of former band member Roger
McGuinn.
   Rich Bauer, product manager of catalog reissues at Legacy, said
he hoped the problems were behind them.
   ``When you try to put together a package from a record that's
20-25 years old, it can be difficult to do everything as well as it
can be done,'' he said. ``There are some records that haven't come
out, such as the first two Jeff Beck records, because of problems
finding the original tapes.''
   PolyGram, one of the first companies to set up its own domestic
plant for producing CDs, received the most praise from collectors.
Rhino Records is also well regarded, especially since it's an
independent label and needs permission from other companies to
acquire master tapes.
   ``We put out a compilation of hits of the 1970s and it was
difficult,'' explained Gary Stewart, vice president of A&amp;R (Artist
and Repertoire) at Rhino. ``Major labels are very professional,
good to deal with. But for independent sources, we have a hard time
tracking them down and making deals, especially companies no longer
in the music business.''
   CDs are digitally mastered (as opposed to analog for LPs), a
concept first tested in France in the 1920s. Digital is thought to
produce a ``cleaner'' sound, with less noise and distortion than
analog.
   Digital recordings (also known as PCM, or Pulse Code Modulation)
were first demonstrated in the late '60s and became available to
the general public in 1972 when Denon released the Mozart Hunting
Suite by the Smetana Quartet.
   PCM recordings were only available on vinyl and cassette until
the '80s when they were issued in the form of a 5-inch ``compact
disc'' developed by Sony and Philips.
   Collectors have few complaints about new albums, but records
made more than 10 years ago create problems. Companies may have a
hard time tracking down the original master and end up using a
second- or third-generation tape. Also, technology has advanced so
rapidly that re-creating sounds produced on old equipment can
require drastic measures.
   ``I recently completed several classical records released in the
1950s and 1960s,'' said Dennis Drake, PolyGram's vice president of
studio and technical operations. ``To transfer this catalog to CD
we had to reconstruct the original machines: a tube tape recorder
and tube console. These machines playing back the masters gave us
the exact sound of the original recordings.''
   Collectors hope the worst is over.
   Pete Howard, publisher and editor of International CD Exchange
(ICE), a monthly newsletter that reviews compact discs, notes that
letters he receives these days deal more with minor compliants -
song length, lyrics etc.
   Still, hard feelings remain. Collectors have asked record
companies to drop the price of CDs not made from the original
masters, and to label discs to inform the customer whether they've
been remastered from an earlier version.
   ``But the sticker could mean different things,'' said PolyGram's
Levinson. ``The implication of remastering could mean the previous
one was no good, or the previous one might have been good and
you're making it better.
   ``I also wouldn't want to have to put it in the artwork all the
time. It costs more to do that than to do remastering. ...It's a
tough issue of balancing information and consumer needs. Sometimes
the consumer thinks he deserves more than we can give.''

<HEAD>Episcopalians Debate Arizona Convention After King Rebuke</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Episcopalians are caught up in agonizing debate
over plans to hold their 1991 national convention in Arizona now
that the state's voters have rejected a holiday honoring Martin
Luther King Jr.
   Even if the site remains the same, as now seems likely, leaders
say it will be a different sort of convention, shorn of celebrative
frills and highlighting racial justice.
   The debate has become so emotionally strained that the Episcopal
Church's presiding bishop, the Most Rev. Edmond Lee Browning, has
called a special executive council meeting for Jan. 5 to consider
ways to trim down the affair.
   After weeks of debate, contentious conference calls and
consultations with church members, especially blacks, Browning said
he was convinced the church must adhere to its scheduled meeting
place in Phoenix July 10-20.
   ``I believe that this rougher road is the one that the church is
meant to walk,'' he said. He has authority to determine the site,
with advice and consent of the executive council of the 2.5
million-member denomination.
   The convention won't be ``business as usual,'' Browning said,
suggesting that it could be shortened and modified and also that it
could offer a powerful witness in Arizona to racial equality.
   At his invitation, South Africa's Anglican archbishop, the Rev.
Desmond Tutu, widely honored for his struggles against racism,
agreed to lead a rally to open the convention.
   Browning's comments haven't quieted the arguing, although the
denomination has avoided a racial split. Whites and blacks are on
both sides of the debate.
   Twelve of the 99 domestic Episcopal dioceses - and scores of
local congregations - have formally urged that the triennial
governing convention either be canceled or held somewhere else.
   Warnings have come that some elected representatives might
refuse to take part if the meeting stays in Phoenix. The
Washington, D.C., diocesan council, for example, recommended its
representatives not participate if it's in Arizona.
   In urging another site, the Diocese of Atlanta, the birthplace
of King, offered to play host to the convention, which usually
draws more than 10,000 church people.
   The furor broke out after Arizona voters in a Nov. 6 referendum
narrowly defeated a proposed state holiday honoring the slain civil
rights leader.
   Although months of advance planning already had been made for
the Episcopalians' once-in-three-years convention, calls quickly
arose for a switch in plans.
   Holding the convention in Phoenix ``and the economic benefits
associated with it'' would be ``an inappropriate witness'' to the
church's stand for racial equality, the New York diocesan council
declared.
   Ohio became a virtual intrastate battleground. The Ohio diocesan
convention, based in Cleveland, called for a new site, but the
southern Ohio diocese, based in Cincinnati, urged sticking with
Phoenix.
   Southern Ohio Bishop Herbert Thompson, a black, said that it was
important to go to Phoenix to show support for racial equality and
that it would be costly and irresponsible to abandon numerous
contracts made for the convention.
   He said pulling out would imply abandoning Arizona blacks and
``we need to stand with them at this time'' to ``overcome this
injustice and prejudice.''
   But Ohio's Suffragan Bishop Arthur Williams Jr., also black,
said he didn't see how the convention could help much since ``we
will spend most of the 20 days in an air-conditioned hall ... or
eating and sleeping.''
   Ohio Bishop James R. Moodey, a white, said some money might have
to be paid to cancel advance guarantees, ``but moral leadership,
not money, should guide our decision.''
   Other diocesan bodies calling for moving the meeting included
the Rio Grande Diocese, based in Albuquerque, N.M., which includes
southwestern Texas, and the New England province, which has seven
dioceses.
   Many secular and some auxiliary Episcopal organizations scrapped
plans for Arizona meetings after the defeat of the King holiday.
The commissioner of the National Football League said he will
recommend the 1993 Super Bowl be moved from Phoenix.
   ``We do not have that choice,'' Browning said. ``We are in this
for the long haul. We cannot turn our backs on the injustices done
to minorities ...''
   He said many Arizonans have worked hard to overcome prejudice
and need support. He urged that ``we stand with them and together
make a vigorous witness to the dignity of all God's people.''
   Browning said the church's executive council would discuss ways
to scale down the convention rather than move it during the special
meeting next month in Elizabeth, N.J. But that question conceivably
could be opened by the 40-member council.
   Several church leaders who have met with Browning have suggested
the convention should make an ``economic witness'' such as
particularly patronizing minority-owned businesses.

   The monthly U.S. Catholic said that 76 percent of
readers responding to a survey would welcome female priests in
their parishes and that a third believe that perpetuating the
male-only priesthood is sinful.
   The magazine, which is published by the Claretian order, said
the results were based on responses from 274 of the 1,300 readers
to whom questionnaires were mailed. A majority of the respondents
were women.
   Sixty-nine percent said they thought that if Jesus were living
today in the United States, he would ordain women.
   If women were admitted to the Roman Catholic priesthood, 50
percent of those responding said they would encourage their
daughters to become priests. But 68 percent said they saw little
hope in their lifetime of women being allowed in that role.

   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) - The Knights of Columbus says the

   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) - The Southern Baptist executive committee
has elected a new vice president for public relations for
distinctly promotional purposes, separating that job from news
services.
   The post previously was seen strictly as a news-reporting task,
prior to the firing earlier this year of the top journalists of
Baptist Press at the behest of new fundamentalist leaders.
   ``Our convention at this time needs to hear about good and
positive things that are occuring within the convention,'' said the
executive committee's chairman, Sam W. Pace of Antlers, Okla.
   In naming Mark T. Coppenger, an Indiana state Baptist leader, to
the new post, Pace said that ``we feel this is more of a public
relations responsibility than a press responsibility.''

   WASHINGTON (AP) - Nearly 2,000 ministers of the United Church of
Christ signed a newspaper advertisement calling on President Bush
to refrain from war with Iraq.
   The full-page ad, which appeared in the Washington Post on Dec.
11, said:
   ``Mr. President, do not go to war with Iraq. We ... call on you
to work through the United Nations and with other nations for a
just and peaceful solution of this crisis.
   ``It is our prayer that war can be avoided, that the lives of
thousands of innocent people can be spared, and that a just peace
will prevail in the Middle East.''

   RYE, N.Y. (AP) - The Union of American Hebrew Congregations says
using force against Iraq would be ``an acceptable moral option''
after other means of resolving the Middle East crisis had been
considered and explored.
   The 200-member policy-making board of trustees of the union,
representing Reform Judaism, said using force would be acceptable
to eliminate Iraq's nuclear capabilities and to free invaded Kuwait
if peaceful means did not work.

   RICHMOND, Va. (AP) - Members of the Discovery United Methodist
Church have produced a Christmas video that portrays the story of
the birth of Jesus and also the history of Santa Claus.
   ``Many people just don't realize the connection between Santa
Claus and the birth of Christ,'' said the Rev. Jim Lavender, the
church's pastor. ``We want to bridge that gap between religious and
secular philosophies and let people know that, indeed, two
historical legends are intertwined.''
   Church members wrote, produced and acted in the 30-minute video,
using help from a Richmond-based production company. The video has
a cast of 70 people, 30 sheep, 4 camels and a donkey.

<HEAD>Daihatsu Charade: Spartan Economy, but With Legroom</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto, Graphic</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ANN M. JOB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>For The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The Daihatsu Charade is a practical car that has special appeal
for budget-minded households, environmentalists, quality-conscious
consumers and anyone who frets over the safety of small cars.
   Built by the 83-year-old Japanese manufacturer Daihatsu Motor
Co., the Charade is a relative newcomer to the United States. It
arrived in the 1988 model year and sales thus far have totaled only
about 36,500.
   The little car has gained attention in a short time, however.
   The Charade is among the most fuel-efficient cars sold in the
United States, which admirers say makes it both economical and
cleaner than many competitors. The consumer group Public Citizen
named it one of the top environmentally sensitive vehicles in the
country on the basis of fuel economy.
   In October, the automotive marketing research firm J.D. Power
and Associates reported that the Charade received more owner
recommendations per vehicle than any other nameplate except Acura
in Power's 1990 customer satisfaction survey.
   And last year the Charade ranked top in its class in
crashworthiness tests by the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration.
   The car protects its owners' wallets pretty well, too: The base
price of $6,597 is less than half that of the average car, and fuel
economy in mixed city-highway driving is over 40 miles per gallon.
   The thriftiness is squeezed out of a three-cylinder, 1-liter
engine that develops only 53 horsepower. Pickup suffers with an
engine that small, and Daihatsu should consider a tachometer to
help drivers make their way through the five-speed manual
transmission.
   The 1990 hatchback offered for testing got good marks for
maneuverability, however, thanks to its small size - 144.9 inches
long - and rack and pinion steering.
   The exterior was simple: a 3-door hatchback design similar to
the Ford Festiva and Dodge Colt. There wasn't even molding on the
sides of the Charade body. But fit and finish were admirable.
   The interior was Spartan and fairly loud from engine and road
noise, though without rattles. There were no side map pockets on
the doors but there was a coin holder beneath the parking brake
lever, and the rear seat was fairly well cushioned. Another nice
touch: The ventilation fan did a good job of moving air around
inside.
   Rear legroom was surprisingly good when the front seats were
moved up a ways, though my knees touched the seatbacks when they
were moved all the way back on their tracks and reclined slightly.
Daihatsu says there is 31.8 inches of rear legroom in the car,
nearly equal to the 31.9 inches in the new Toyota Tercel, which is
nearly 17 inches longer on the outside.
   There was a handy rear tray to help cover items stowed in the
hatchback area. Rear carpeting in the hatchback area was thin and
had a tendency to bunch up behind the rear seat. The seat, by the
way, folds down for additional cargo space.
   The car meets its goal of providing basic transportation and is
a worthy competitor in the crowded subcompact field, which includes
the Tercel (starting at $6,488), the Nissan Sentra (starting at
$7,999) and the Honda Civic (starting at more than $6,600).
   Daihatsu says on average its buyers are about 30, have some
college education and an annual household income of between $25,000
and $40,000.
   The 235 Daihatsu dealers in 22 states are still selling 1990
models, the company says. It does not expect 1991 models to arrive
in showrooms until February. Prices of the 1991 models have not
been announced.
   Consumer Reports did not have an owner trouble report for the
Charade.

   Thomas Nast elevated American political
cartooning out of the realm of whimsy in the late 19th century,
shocking the public with his scathing portrayals of politicians and
other public figures.
   His drawings were credited with electing one presidential
candidate and blamed for contributing to the death of another.
   He held New York City's political machine up to ridicule across
the nation, and he left us several enduring symbols - the
stars-and-stripes-suited Uncle Sam, the Democratic Party donkey,
the Republican elephant, the Tammany Hall Tiger and the rotund,
red-jowled image of Santa Claus.
   In the 150th year since his birth, Nast and his work are the
subjects of renewed interest. His Christmas scenes are becoming
more popular; a biography is nearing completion; and his
sesquicentennial is being celebrated in major exhibitions in
Morristown, his long-time residence, and Landau, Germany, his
birthplace.
   ``He was indisputably the father of American political
cartooning. He really defined the art form as we know it,'' said
Richard Samuel West, author of a 1988 biography of cartoonist
Joseph Keppler, a Nast contemporary.
   West said Nast transformed the droll, genteel world of political
cartooning that existed in pre-1860 America.
   ``Nast came along and said: `This politician is like the devil.
He is evil. He is stealing your money,' and it shocked people,''
said West. ``He was dogmatic, he was angry and he cared deeply
about what was happening in the country.''
   An example was Nast's Tammany Tiger - representing the New York
political machine of Tammany Hall - often seen attacking the values
of American society.
   Draper Hill, an editorial cartoonist with the Detroit News who
is writing a Nast biography, said Nast's style was influenced by
German, French and English cartooning - such as using animals and
Shakespearean references - and his own political convictions.
   ``He had a sense of integrity and independence from editorial
policy that was nonexistent at the time,'' said Hill.
   Nast left Landau for New York at age 6 and was drawing
illustrations for city publications by his late teens. He launched
his career in 1860 by covering the campaign of Italian patriot
Guiseppe Garibaldi for illustrated publications in London and
Paris.
   He reached his peak in the 1870s drawing for Harper's Weekly,
the nation's most widely read magazine. His work was prodigious -
more than 8,000 drawings for his career.
   He turned New York City political power William Marcy ``Boss''
Tweed into a metaphor for corruption, often depicting him as a
bulging sack of money.
   He did generous portrayals of Civil War hero Ulysses S. Grant,
who credited Nast with helping him win the presidency in 1868.
   Some people felt Nast went too far in his attack on publisher
Horace Greeley, a 1872 candidate for president against Grant.
   Nast's lengthy assault on the candidate included illustrations
of Greeley defiling Lincoln and eating his own words. One drawing
showed Greeley's white hat and coat on a pole, storm-tossed and
labeled ``something that will blow over.''
   Greeley lost overwhelmingly and died soon after the election.
There were claims that Nast contributed mightily to the rigors of
Greeley's campaign, according to Hill.
   Jim Borgman, a nationally syndicated editorial cartoonist for
the Cincinnati Enquirer, said Nast may have exercised too much
power.
   Nast ``could paint the world the way he saw it and a lot of
people did not have a counterbalance. I don't want to have that
kind of responsibility,'' Borgman said.
   He added that cartoonists today often eschew backing a cause in
favor of lampooning just about everything.
   Herb Block, a Washington Post cartoonist who favors the Nast
approach, agrees.
   ``A lot of cartoonists today are doing just a kind of a gag
cartoon without having any policy angle,'' Block said.
   He said one of his Nast-inspired drawings showed Caspar
Weinberger, former U.S. defense secretary, with a $640 toilet seat
around his neck, symbolizing waste in the military.
   The biggest Nast displays this year have been in Landau and
Morristown, where the Macculloch Hall museum has a large permanent
collection on display.
   The Landau museum has more than 2,000 Harper's Weeklies, said
Nicole van Aanholt, organizer of Nast exhibitions there. She said
another major exhibit is planned for Bonn, Germany, in December.
   Nearly a dozen Nast political drawings also can be seen at the
Fraunces Tavern Museum in New York City through late January.

   The long list of photography books this year
ranges from the 13th collection of photojournalism by Life's Alfred
Eisenstaedt, now 91, to the very edge of the photography as art
debate with the works of the 29-year-old Starn Twins.
   In between, there are many familiar names, with elegies to
Western photographer Ansel Adams, to photographer and filmmaker
Paul Strand and to Robert Mapplethorpe.
   But 1990 also reflected an increasing awareness for the work of
women and of conceptual photographers.
   ``Women Photographers'' (Harry N. Abrams, $65) provides a full
survey of women photographers. They include pioneers such as Julia
Margaret Cameron and Gertrude Kasebier and emerging work such as
the startlig documentary shots from Central America of Susan
Meiselas and the conceptual art of Jan Groover.
   ``Lisette Model'' (University of Chicago Press, $35.96) is among
the best of the books on individual photographers. It is the
catalog for an exhibit that opened in Ottawa this fall, the first
major retrospective on one of this century's most innovative
photographers and effective teachers, whose pupils included such
luminaries as Diane Arbus. The text, which takes great pains to
demystify Model, an often intentionally baffling pesonality, is as
enjoyable as the photographs of the odd assortment of characters on
whom she focused her camera.
   Cindy Sherman's ``Untitled Stills'' (Rizzoli, $37.50) is a
collection of her works from the 1970s, when she made a tremendous
splash with her concept of photographing herself in Hollywood-style
poses. She has since moved on to other things, but her stills
remain a provocative case study in post-modern art, well treated in
the lucid introductory essay by philosopher Arthur Danto.
   Lucia Moholy, Florence Henri and other women get fair notice in
``Photography at the Bauhaus'' (MIT Press, $75). It is a sweeping
work with elaborate essays and about 450 photographs covering every
phase of the exciting and important experimental art movement of
the '20s and early '30s, with biographies on all of the artists.
   Of the place books, the best are of historic interest and are by
women, including ``Photographing Montana - 1894-1928'' (Alfred
Knopf, $60), a look at the old West through the eyes of Evelyn
Cameron, a Britisher to the manor born who fell for the Big Sky
country during a visit and decided to stay.
   Published last year - but on a slow journey to bookshelves - is
``Eudora Welty: Photographs'' (University of Mississippi Press,
$50), offering scenes from the South by a writer who has been one
of its most distinctive chroniclers for 50 years. Her photography
has especially strong documentary value because of her penchant,
even as far back as the '30s, to focus so often on ordinary
citizens.
   Also noteworthy, both for content and as a look at a good
personal collection of photographs, is Nancy Hathaway's ``Native
American Portraits: 1862-1918'' (Chronicle Books, $16.95). These
portraits, riveting as a sad chronicle of the Indians during their
demise, is from New York attorney Kurt Koegler's collection.
   ``Werner Bischof'' (Bulfinch Press, $65), is a testament to the
Swiss photojournalist who died young in 1954. The book includes his
famous Life photo essay on famine in India and work from China,
Japan and Indochina. It also includes his well-written
correspondences telling of a young photographer's battle to
maintain integrity while feeding a world market hungry for shots of
exotic suffering.
   Bischof's appearance seems so timely given the continued current
attention to Sebastiao Salgado, whose work in South America hints
at the kinds of shots Bischof and others who worked for Robert Capa
in the 1940s might have taken. Salgado's ``An Uncertain Grace''
(Aperture, $60) is largely made up of powerful scenes of
deprivation.
   Gentler is ``Ansel Adams: The American Wilderness.'' It is
published by Bulfinch, with 146 pages and 107 duotones in
impressive, large format that give his vistas more the scope they
deserve. But at $100 it is an expensive look.
   Equally costly is the fine retrospective on Paul Strand, put out
by Aperture and the National Gallery of Art, which catalogs a show
that opened at the National Gallery this month and travels over the
next two years to Chicago, St. Louis, Houston, New York, San
Francisco and London.
   Strand, always a reluctant printer of his own works, teamed with
Richard Benson to produce a project of prints, completed as he lay
dying at his home in France. It must have been painful for him, but
given the paucity of his prints that were extant, the project made
for both a fine show on the centenary of Strand's birth and an
important archive.
   Robert Mapplethorpe's ``Flowers'' (Bulfinch, $50) might be the
final chapter for some time in the career of the man who drew wider
attention to photography in a shorter time than almost anyone
before him. The photographs are lovely in their technical
production and in their startling sensuality. As his friend Patti
Smith indicates in her introduction, Mapplethorpe was the lily and
the orchid, but also their sinister shadow.
   The most pleasingly different approaches are ``An Angler's

   Mounting discontent and a ruined economy
are forcing reform in Albania, Europe's last bastion of Stalinism,
where leaders are buying time by making surprising concessions.
   Three days of student protest in the Albanian capital, Tirana,
prompted the startling decision Tuesday by the ruling Communists to
permit other political movements. Five members of the 13-member
ruling Politburo also were dropped and government changes promised.
   The decisions came just before President Ramiz Alia, head of
state and of the ruling Albanian Labor Party, met a group of the
striking students, urging them to return to class and to work
peacefully within the law for the reforms they seek.
   The students said they would hold more rallies and start their
own party.
   Albania has a turbulent history. For centuries, it was dominated
by Italian or Ottoman Turkish rulers, and it gained true
independence only after World War II under the Stalinist Enver
Hoxha.
   Alia, who took over when Hoxha died in 1985, appears to be
trying to contain an explosion of popular anger with swift
political maneuvering and timely concessions.
   In July, he defused the most serious crisis to date, allowing
thousands of Albanians jammed into foreign embassies in Tirana to
emigrate and reshuffling the leadership to offer the public
scapegoats to blame for political repression and economic misery.
   Wage increases also were promised, but Albanians say they have
not materialized.
   But this afforded only temporary respite from the leaders' basic
dilemma: how to make the changes needed to get the economy going
while retaining control and avoiding open rebellion.
   At a Communist party meeting last month, premier Adil Carcani
painted a picture of catastrophe in the economy. Alia bluntly told
workers on Nov. 29 that the economy ``is on the brink of a state of
emergency.''
   The drought has severely curbed electric supplies, mainly
generated from hydroelectric stations in the country's rugged
mountains, and affected crops grown on the fertile coastal plains.
   The students' protest that brought this week's historic changes
reportedly began with demands for more heat and light in their
wintry Tirana dormitories.
   Alia has attempted to ease food shortages, particularly of meat,
by allowing private shops that sell at two or three times the state
prices. He has also promised imports of food and other items, but
lacks the necessary hard currency to carry out the pledge.
   Isolated for decades, Albania is also seeking foreign
investment. As Alia himself warned the students Tuesday, that won't
come if there is political instability.
   But there is much cause for discontent. In towns, most homes are
in slumlike, three-story apartment blocks. Factories are outdated
and extremely dilapidated. In the countryside, children trudge
miles to school while women tend fields with primitive picks and
hoes.
   Most Albanians seem to express their disgust with this state of
affairs by working less and less, ignoring the leadership's many
appeals to toil for economic improvement.
   But a leadership steeped in decades of authoritarian rule is
finding it hard to adjust to the new changes.
   It remains to be seen whether any new political parties will be
allowed to contest scheduled parliamentary elections in February.
The Communists have made no mention of giving up their
constitutional monopoly on power.
   Also, a population unused to democracy might find it difficult
to organize any opposition to the Communists, who have dominated
public life since taking power in 1944.
   Students were a powerful force behind many of Eastern Europe's
revolutions last year, and are among the few groups in Albania who
have the courage and unity to challenge the Communists.
   With the highest birth rate in Europe, Albania is a country of
young people. About 75 percent of its 3.2 million people are under
40. They learn about the outside world from television broadcasts
from neighboring Yugoslavia, Greece and Italy and from the
Albanian-language service of Voice of America.
   This contact with the outside world and the reforms made this
year have emboldened the young, who do not have the deeply
instilled fear of those who survived Hoxha's harsh rule.

<HEAD>Joyce Burditt Spends Days Plotting Murders: Religiously and
Legally</HEAD>

   Joyce Burditt has bumped off 72 people by one
devious means or another. And she has no regrets.
   Miss Burditt admits to having a good time as she confines her
bent for murder to the scripts of ABC's ``Father Dowling
Mysteries'' and the NBC legal drama, ``Matlock.'' She is a
co-producer on each series.
   ``It's difficult to think of all those murders,'' she said,
``but it's such fun. I have no regrets whatsoever. It's wonderful
when we have our story meetings and come up with interesting ways
to do away with people. Can we hang someone? No, we hanged someone
last year. What kind of poison kills instantly? The only murder
that made me uneasy was on `Matlock.' The victim was in a bathtub
and someone threw a hair dryer into the tub.''
   Although she's an experienced writer, Miss Burditt said she
found it difficult to adapt to the mystery format.
   ``I'd written two books and several movies, but until I started
on `Father Dowling' and `Matlock,' I'd never plotted a killing that
had to be solved,'' she said. ``It was a whole new way of thinking
- and writing - for me. You have to come up with a murder that will
interest people.
   ``You have to let the audience know what Father Dowling knows
and what Sister Steve knows. I work out the premise of the story
and the beginning. It has to be in a setting that will involve your
character. Then I skip to the end.
   ``The acts in between will take you through all the twists and
turns to the solution. The murder mystery tends to be formulaic.
You start out with Dowling. You have to connect the victim or the
killer to him. There must be some personal relationship. The clues
have to be there for everyone to see.''
   At the time of the interview, she was working on a political
assassination story for ``Father Dowling.''
   ``It's a real puzzle,'' Miss Burditt said. ``It takes you in one
direction and then another. Dowling is the friend of a black
Baptist minister, and we open in his church with gospel music. The
target is a candidate for district attorney. If we do it right, the
audience will think the target is one candidate, while it's really
the other.
   ``We also have another murder, that of a young black musician.
The minister's grandson is a suspect. The suspect's father is a
police captain, and he disapproves of him playing in a jazz club.
So it's a generational story and a chase to prevent the
assassination.''
   Miss Burditt had worked as a program executive at ABC and had
been vice president for comedy development at NBC. At ABC, she had
formed a relationship with Fred Silverman, who was then president
of ABC Entertainment and now is an executive producer of ``Father
Dowling'' and ``Matlock.''
   She was asked to join the writing staff of ``Matlock'' after
writing a movie for Silverman's company. Then the Writers Guild
went on strike and she had to wait six months to start work.
   ``I was working on `Matlock,' but I would see the dailies on
`Father Dowling,' '' Miss Burditt said. ``I loved the relation
between the priest and the nun. I'm Catholic and went to parochial
schools for 12 years, so that gives me a good foundation to work
on.''
   The requirements for each show are different. ``Father Dowling''
is more of a traditional mystery. Dowling and Sister Steve, played
by Tom Bosley and Tracy Nelson, solve murders as amateur
detectives. ``Matlock'' is in the tradition of ``Perry Mason.''
Andy Griffith stars as a defense attorney who must prove his client
innocent.
   Although each show uses free-lance writers, they rely heavily on
a staff of producers who perform double duty as writers because of
the time pressures of getting out a weekly show.
   Miss Burditt also is the author of two books, ``The Cracker
Factory,'' which was made into a movie with Natalie Wood in 1979,
and ``Triplets.'' She wrote the movie ``Under the Influence,''
which starred Andy Griffith.
   ``The Cracker Factory'' was based on Miss Burditt's recovery
from alcoholism.
   ``It takes place in a psychiatric ward in a Cleveland
hospital,'' she said. ``I was treated there for alcoholism because
at that time, they didn't regard it as a disease. That was 23 years
ago, and that was when I had my last drink.''

   On Mondays, it was meatloaf with string beans and a baked
potato. The ritual evening meal, usually served around 6:30 or so,
was alive with laughter and the inevitable family squabbles.
   The arguments generally were settled before the dinner hour
rolled around again. What lingered were memories of the corny
jokes, a little parental wisdom, perhaps the brief quiet after
grace was said.
   Dinner time in America conjures images of the hearth, the nest.
Family members gather around the table to share their lives and,
perhaps, learn a little from one another.
   That's the snapshot we hold. It's the way families are supposed
to be. But the idyll of regular, warm togetherness at the table
often doesn't work out.
   The nuclear family of yesteryear has in many cases splintered.
Today, more than half of mothers hold down jobs outside the home.
Kids, too, are busier than ever with afterschool sports and other
activities.
   All too often, the dinner hour is fast food inhaled in front of
the television set instead of around a table set with silverware
and napkins.
   Yet recent polls have shown the vast majority of Americans make
an effort to dine together regularly. Parents recognize that
mealtime often is the only real chance family members have to get
involved in each other's lives.
   ``We are all caught between reality and the expectation of ...
`Leave It to Beaver,' where everyone sits around the table and
makes chirpy conversation,'' said Susan Ginsberg, editor of Work &amp;
Family Life newsletter.
   ``The reality is that we are all so busy that we find it hard to
sit down together,'' said Ginsberg, who also directs work and
family programs at Bank Street College in New York. ``We have less
time than we did 25 years ago.''
   But most parents believe dining together should be a priority.
It encourages openness, helps kids develop conversational skills,
strengthens the family unit.
   ``The goal of dinner time is not to sit silently and eat,'' said
Thomas Weisner, an anthropologist at the University of
California-Los Angeles. ``The goal is to share knowledge and
information ... reaffirm cultural values.''
   Weisner and Eleanor Ochs, a linguist and colleague at UCLA,
spent three years studying videotapes of mealtimes in 20 Los
Angeles households struggling to preserve the dinner hour amid
modern life's competing demands.
   ``The most important thing that we found was that regardless of
socieconomics or the dinner arrangements, all the families used the
time to talk about problems ... and problem-solving,'' Ochs said.
   It's a nice scenario, the image of loving parents, brothers and
sisters participating in each others' lives.
   But don't despair if dinner table conversation at your house
tends more toward complaints about undercooked spaghetti and
sibling taunts and blowups over grades, chores or next year's
family vacation destination.
   ``We all have this fantasy about the perfect dinner,'' said
Ellen Galinsky of the Families and Work Institute of New York.
``Then you sit down and nobody likes the food, or people fight. ..
.
   ``You feel really rotten because you think that at other
people's houses, they're having discussions about the election or
coming recession or some other meaningful topic,'' said Galinsky,
who conducts parenting seminars.
   The fact is, family dinner hours don't always make for erudite
conversation. Sometimes they are raucous, or downright rocky. But
that's all right, the experts say. What counts is the act of
sitting down, of setting time aside.
   June and Tom Darling's seven children know that. Their memories
differ, but all hold close the chaos that was dinner time at their
home, ``The Almosta Ranch,'' in southern Michigan.
   ``Having rituals is important,'' said the family's 71-year-old
matriarch. ``Ours was a big, round table with two extra leaves. It
could easily sit 10, and we all knew when Daddy got home ... it was
time to gather round.''
   The Darling children's lives have veered far from that 1950s
tableau. They now are adults with kids of their own and, like much
of America, they struggle to keep family tradition alive despite
life's complications.
   ``We need to make choices here,'' said Janice Darling, one of
five daughters who all went on to become mothers. ``We need to
sacrifice a few things so we have a little calm in our lives, time
to enjoy each other.''

   They've come to cherish a whole childhood's worth of dinners
shared around a solid maple table near an open kitchen hearth. But
Tom and June Darling's seven kids have branched out in seven
directions, making new traditions for themselves in their own
homes.
   Theirs are the dinner tables of today.
   The eldest, Nancy Darling Hutchinson of Houston, with her
husband raised three sons who are starting families of their own.
The youngest, Tom and Michael, run the family hardware store in
Marshall, Mich. They make it home for dinner pretty much every
night, the way their father did.
   In between are the four middle daughters who, like so many
parents across America, are carving new traditions from a family
legacy.
   Here's a glimpse of how the Darlings' dinner time ritual has
evolved:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>DINNER AT JANICE'S HOUSE:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Janice Darling's variety store is nestled among the twinkling
lights and garlands that festoon Main Street. All of Marshall,
Mich., seems to be in the old-fashioned holiday spirit.
   It's the time of year when Janice feels slightly nostalgic, a
little mournful for old times like dinner with her parents and six
brothers and sisters gathered round.
   It's also the time of year the single mother keeps her shop open
seven days a week instead of the usual six; the time of year when
life is even more frenetic than usual.
   ``Dinner is the first thing to go,'' said Janice, 44, who is
struggling to adapt the 1950s traditions she and her siblings knew
growing up to the realities of today's changeable world.
   ``There's just no time,'' she said. ``I would like to be home
around 5:30 and have dinner all ready, turn off the TV and just sit
and talk ... just chat. I miss that.''
   But Janice's 15-year-old daughter, Jennifer, needs to be at band
practice (she plays clarinet), or swim team (she's got a great
freestyle stroke), or the library (a book report is due).
   And Janice, who works 70-hour weeks, needs to get back to
Darling &amp; Daughter, the dime store she runs for her father.
   Dinner is generally a fast-food affair. Hamburgers, pizza or
takeout chicken wolfed down in front of the evening news or, most
often, en route somewhere.
   ``We have our mealtime in the car. That's our time together,''
Janice said. ``You spill stuff down your front, but no matter what
... we're still getting in touch.''
   Janice and her daughter have traditions. They're just not
traditional traditions. Their rituals are tailored to a single mom
and daughter, whose lives and needs can't be scripted.
   ``Dinner time at my house it very unruly. It makes me feel bad
that we don't have enough time to sit and listen to each other,''
Janice said. ``It can't be, but I long for the days when you sat on
the front porch, rocking and watching your neighbors walk by.''

<HEAD>DINNER AT GAIL'S HOUSE:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   On just about any evening, you'll find Gail Darling Morgan, her
husband and three children gathered for dinner at their two-story
home in West Palm Beach, Fla.
   They use cloth napkins and placemats. The atmosphere generally
is calm and the discussions a bit civilized. It probably won't
last.
   Her kids will be teen-agers in a few short years.
   ``But right now my kids are still young,'' said Gail, 39.
``There's a six- or seven-year period where they're accepting of
whatever is put in front of them ... before they become
sophisticated and busy.''
   Already Gail's elder two kids by a previous marriage are
beginning to participate in sports and join afterschool clubs.
   ``So far, we definitely make it together for one meal a day,''
Gail said. ``I really think that it's an important time for us and
it's something I want to continue.''
   It helps that Gail's job managing a dental office is only part
time and that her husband, photographer Red Morgan, works out of
their Florida home.
   ``I have the luxury of being here and having time to prepare
things,'' Gail said. ``But I'm already beginning to use the
microwave a whole lot more and I feel guilty about that.''
   The phone is always ringing, their 1-year-old baby needs
diapering and the refrigerator forever needs stocking. That's where
the best of old traditions crops up: Everyone pitches in.
   A recent study of U.S. families found that the female head
prepared dinner in 85 percent of households, set the table in 65
percent and cleared the dishes in 68 percent.
   Preserving the tradition of dinner together requires a joint
effort. The idealized portrait of mother with an apron and warm
cookies perpetually at the ready just doesn't apply for a lot of
families. These days, she's more likely to be carrying a briefcase.
   ``My daughter sets the table at our house. It's part of the
occasion,'' Gail said. ``It's the only time of day we can talk
about what happened at school, whatever is going on. It's the time
of day when everyone is present and seated and, maybe, listening.''

<HEAD>DINNER AT JANE'S HOUSE:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Jane Darling Duell and her husband, Bob, remember simpler times,
the days when dinner hour fell like clockwork. No negotiation.
   But those days are long gone. With three teen-agers
participating in seven sports between them, the Duells have learned
that flexibility is the only way any peace can be kept at their
home in Goshen, Ind.
   ``It's just not `Leave It to Beaver' anymore. There are very few
families where dinner is served at 5:30 and everyone sits down at
the table,'' said Jane, a high school French teacher and Janice
Darling's twin sister.
   They do their best to dine together, but the logistics are a bit
daunting. To get around scheduling conflicts that cut into family
dinner time, the Duells have worked out other ways of sharing each
other's lives.
   Sometimes the kids do their homework at a table in the living
room, side-by-side with Jane as she grades her students' papers. Or
the family holds a meeting before everyone turns in for the night.
   ``It's the best way we know to handle the situation,'' said Bob
Duell, who as principal of Goshen High School also looks after
other people's teen-agers.
   ``The roles and expectations today are so confused,'' he said.
``Used to be that kids knew a meal was going to be cooked and
everybody was going to be there. Now kids don't even know if anyone
will be home.''
   The Duells don't want their kids to feel that way. Every chance
they get, they establish an hour at which their kids are expected
home for dinner.
   ``It's an excellent chance for the family to get together and
communicate,'' Bob said.
   And communicate they do, usually in loud voices. Dinner is
nothing fancy, but there's time to ask how the kids are doing in
chemistry, tell funny stories, hear how things went at football
practice, or swim team, or soccer, softball, chorus, student
government ...
   ``My calendar looks like President Bush's,'' Jane said. ``But
whether it's the traditional route or not, time together is a
priority. And you have to work to get that time ... to be a
family.''

<HEAD>DINNER AT ANN'S HOUSE:</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   By the time Ann Darling Perryman finishes the hour-long commute
from her New York office home to suburbia, her husband has dinner
on the stove.
   It's not a traditional arrangement, but it's a system that
works.
   ``And probably the only way we were going to ... commit to
dinner as a ritual,'' said Ann, director of publications at Lehman
College. ``Cooking was never one of my claims.''
   James Perryman figured that out about the time the couple had
their daughter 15 years ago.
   ``He finally said, `Ann, prisoners are eating better than I am,'
'' the second eldest Darling daughter recalled. ``And he took over
the cooking. I haven't been to a supermarket in 10 years.''
   Ann's husband, a free-lance writer, has over the years learned
how to turn out a decent salmon loaf and a table conducive to
conversation.
   ``It means a lot to him,'' said Ann, 49. ``And I think it's
terrific. Dinner time is the time when we sort of do our audit. We
talk about current events ... what happened on the subway ...
things in our daily lives.''
   This is a modern family, an unconventional family. Ann has
sometimes been critical of the way she and her six brothers and
sisters grew up in Michigan.
   But in the end, she says, ``I guess my parents did something
OK.''
   They provided a big, round table where dinner hour was regular
and a game of hearts often followed after the dishes were cleared.
   They provided a sense of the family as a unit, a sense of
security in an unpredictable world.
   ``I remember my father used to shout ... when I was tipping back
in my chair. He'd also say that we couldn't get through a meal
without somebody spilling their milk,'' Ann remembered.
   ``We had a big family ... a noisy family,'' she said. ``But I
think you've got to sit down together. If you're never in the same
place at the same time, that's a loss.
   ``And the dinner table, well, that's not the only way of doing
it. It's just a nice way of doing it.''

<HEAD>When Quality Isn't Enough</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>

   The memo from executive producer John Sacret
Young to the cast and crew of ABC's ``China Beach'' was cheerfully
glum, if such a thing is possible.
   ``In all this I sometimes wonder why we struggle but I'm
attaching two letters we received yesterday. They make it all
worthwhile,'' it said.
   The acclaimed creator of one of television's most innovative
shows now knows firsthand the ultimate rule of iconoclastic TV
making:
   Fan mail, rave reviews, loyal audiences, Emmy awards and just
plain talent are not enough. A television show lives by the A.C.
Nielsen Co. ratings. And dies by the ratings.
   ``China Beach'' still has a pulse, but it's in a coma. NBC's
``Parenthood,'' another highly acclaimed but little-watched
program, is likewise in limbo.
   Their predicament is nothing new in the world of television,
where quality and success quite often are mutually exclusive.
   What is new is the lengths to which some producers will go to
pressure a network into standing by a dismally rated, but
quality-minded, show.
   In the face of threatened cancellation, people like Young and
Andrew Susskind of ``Parenthood'' are talking back to networks that
have the power to make them and their staffs eligible for
unemployment.
   ``I think they're caught in real short-term thinking right
now,'' Susskind said of NBC. ``They're No. 1, but their lead is
shrinking. I'm not sure they have the same kind of confidence they
had when they were No. 3 and shooting for No. 1 - which was to give
quality shows a chance.''
   ``The sad part is that, overall, ABC has supported the show the
way you support someone you love and then shoot off another limb,''
Young said of ``China Beach.''
   The Fox Broadcasting Co. gave probably the biggest chance of any
network to its highest quality series.
   ``The Tracey Ullman Show'' - which spawned ``The Simpsons,'' won
Fox its first Emmy and ran for four seasons - was often the
least-watched show on television. Still, Fox never yanked it. It
ended this year only after Ullman quit.
   ``We loved the show,'' said Fox Entertainment Group President
Peter Chernin. ``We had enormous respect and admiration for the
people who were doing it.''
   NBC will not say if ``Parenthood'' will be canceled, but it has
not aired since Nov. 19 and its last two original episodes are not
on the prime-time schedule.
   ``They've said it's very iffy right now,'' said Susskind, the
president of Imagine Television, which produces the show. ``I'm
doing what I can to at least let people know that the show is in
trouble.''
   What Susskind is doing is a calculated effort to place pressure
on NBC. By calling television critics who gave ``Parenthood''
favorable reviews and making himself available for interviews,
Susskind is upping the cancellation game's ante.
   Of some 30-plus new shows this season, ``Parenthood'' stood out
for several reasons. It was produced by the television division of
Ron Howard's highly successful Imagine Films, it was a take-off
from the popular feature film of the same name, and it featured an
ensemble cast that included Ed Begley Jr. (``St. Elsewhere''),
Jayne Atkinson (``A Year in the Life'') and William Windom (My
World and Welcome to It'').
   It also got great reviews.
   It didn't, however, get great ratings, a fact that Susskind
blames in part on its time period of 8 p.m. Saturdays.
   Susskind wants NBC to move the show and stick with it just a
little longer. ``Given the research we've done, any time period is
better than the one we're in,'' he said. NBC executives declined
comment.
   Changing time periods is a common network maneuver for
resuscitating dying shows. In most cases, though, it only prolongs
the inevitable.
   Young knows this well. ``China Beach'' has changed time slots
two times in two years. Marked for cancellation last season, the
award-winning Vietnam War series was saved at the last minute, only
to be moved to the kiss-of-death time period of 9 p.m. Saturdays -
up against NBC's formidable ``Golden Girls.''
   There it has languished, dropping to the bottom third of the
Nielsen rankings.
   Last month, ABC announced ``China Beach'' would be placed on
hiatus after the Dec. 15 episode and return at an undisclosed date
to finish its season run.
   Asked if he thought the series would return for another new
season, Young replied, ``I think it's a possibility, but not a
great likelihood.''
   Young asserts that ``China Beach'' did quite well in its
original time period of 10 p.m. Wednesdays. But when ABC moved it
to Mondays and then to Saturdays, viewers couldn't keep up, he
said. ABC executives declined comment.
   Young countered the network's latest ``China Beach''
announcement by faxing a copy of his acerbic internal memo to the
country's largest news organizations.
   Young and Susskind's approaches are high profile, but no one
waged a more public campaign to save his show than Barney
Rosenzweig, the executive producer of ``Cagney &amp; Lacey.''
   Indeed, Rosenzweig may have elevated network pressure to an art
form.
   The year was 1983 and Rosenzweig was making television history
by producing a cop show starring two women who did not jiggle, have
big hair or wear bikinis in the line of duty.
   Cagney and Lacey were tough, smart, sometimes grumpy, sometimes
self-destructive cops. CBS, citing poor ratings, canceled the show
after two seasons.
   Rosenzweig, out of a job and his marriage, hit an emotional and
professional low. With nothing better to do, he answered all 2,000
fan letters protesting the show's cancellation.
   ``I said it was my perception that no one in power at the
network was reading their mail,'' Rosenzweig recalled. ``I
suggested that they write to their local newspapers on the theory
that the network executives might not read their mail, but they do
read their newspapers.''
   And write they did. Newspapers followed suit. By summer, the
show's ratings began to climb. ``Cagney &amp; Lacey,'' in reruns,
captured the No. 1 spot.
   In August, the Emmy nominations were announced. Out of five CBS
nominations, four were for ``Cagney &amp; Lacey.''
   A month later, the network called to say it had made a mistake.
``Cagney &amp; Lacey'' was reinstated.
   ``That had never happened in the history of modern television
and it's never happened again,'' Rosenzweig said.
   Now the executive producer of CBS' ``The Trials of Rosie
O'Neill,'' featuring former ``Cagney &amp; Lacey'' co-star Sharon
Gless, Rosenzweig said he didn't know if his approach would have
the same impact in today's television market.
   ``I think now it lacks the juice that it had when it was all
sort of happening spontaneously,'' he said.
   So what should a network do in the ever-competitive fight for
viewers who now can choose from cable, independent stations and
home video rentals?
   ``If you're doing something qualitative, let it stay on,''
Rosenzweig said. ``Don't pull the trigger. Give that show a chance
to connect. Leave it on for at least a season.''

<HEAD>Wary USDA Economists Downplay Chances of Another Great Depression</HEAD>
<BYLINE>DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For some Agriculture Department analysts with
good memories, old textbooks or both, there are some disturbing
similarities between what's been going on since about 1981 and the
boom-that-busted era of the 1920s and '30s.
   Current speculation about whether the United States is already
in an economic recession hasn't boosted holiday spirits, either.
   But John Kitchen and Gregory Gajewski of the department's
Economic Research Service think a recession will be mild by
historical standards. Unless a few things go completely haywire.
   Kitchen and Gajewski, writing in the current issue of
Agricultural Outlook magazine, say their prediction is based on
things staying relatively stable - no war in the Mideast and no big
hammering by other problems.
   ``While there is the potential for a mild recession, and a slim
chance for a severe downturn, the outlook is for continued mediocre
growth in the economy over the next year,'' the report said.
   The nation's economy was said to be ``especially weak'' in the
final quarter of 1990 and probably will be ``fairly weak'' through
the first half of 1991 before reviving.
   A number of worrisome items confront agricultural economists,
not the least of which is the stalled Uruguay Round of trade talks
that was recently recessed in Geneva because of disputes over
limiting commodity price supports and export subsidies.
   Whether the talks will resume in the weeks or months ahead on
any kind of harmonious note remains to be seen.
   The Persian Gulf crisis also has had an effect on domestic
energy prices and federal spending on maintaining the large U.S.
military presence in that region.
   Kitchen and Gajewski said the uncertainties over GATT and the
Persian Gulf, along with ``a relatively tight monetary policy'' by
the Federal Reserve the past several months are big factors.
   Putting it all together has led some analysts to draw parallels
with the late 1920s and early 1930s.
   The U.S. economy grew strongly in the late '20s, but then
faltered, leading to financial failures and, in retrospect, policy
mistakes that led to the Great Depression of the 1930s.
   According to the report, some of the policies undertaken during
the crisis period of 1930-32 included higher income tax rates,
heightened protectionism through increased tariffs and a
restrictive monetary policy by the Fed.
   ``Lower-income earners saw their tax rates rise sixfold to
eightfold, and higher income earners saw their rates double or
triple,'' the report said. ``Similarly, tariff rates were raised
sharply. The average rate jumped from 38 percent in 1925 to 59
percent in 1932.''
   Further, the Federal Reserve's tight money policy of the early
1930s and the contraction of the money supply by one-third during
1929-33 are well-documented. In 1929, there were more than 25,000
banks. By 1933, fewer than 15,000 were left.
   The report said that in 1921 - and again in 1981 - there was a
crumbling of expectations that farm income would continue growing.
Farmland values fell 26 percent in 1921-28, and 48 percent during
1981-88.
   Prices received by farmers in the 1920s and the 1980s declined
relative to prices paid for goods needed to produce crops and
livestock.
   ``Income was essentially the same in 1929 as in 1919,'' the
report said. Likewise for income in 1989 compared with 1979. It
plunged early in each period and then recovered by the end of each
decade.''
   But agriculture moved down with the rest of the U.S. economy
during the 1929-33 plunge, the report said. All key indicators
slipped sharply, including farmland values, prices of commodities,
prices paid by farmers and exports.
   Despite some of the parallels, the report said that upon closer
examination today's policy shifts and instabilities are ``not
nearly as severe'' as those of 60 years ago.
   ``While the recent federal budget package reduces the
expansionary nature of fiscal policy, the package certainly is not
excessively restrictive,'' the report said. ``Most individuals'
income tax rates will not change.''
   The budget package agreed to by Congress and the Bush
administration calls cuts of nearly $500 billion, including $13.5
billion from USDA programs over the next five years.
   ``Also, the spending cuts are largely either cuts from planned
growth in expenditures, or planned cuts from a year earlier that
depend on future economic growth,'' the report said.
``Specifically, the planned spending cuts could be eased
significantly if the economy performs worse than some fairly
optimistic assumptions spelled out in the package.''
   The analysis also said consumer confidence in banks, although
down recently, is higher than in the late 1920s and early 1930s, in
part because of federal deposit insurance, which didn't exist then.
   ``Back then, banks held off from making loans to keep cash on
hand, thus reassuring depositors,'' the report said. ``But with
fewer loans, many companies contracted or went out of business.''
   Finally, it said, downward spiral in trade protectionism on a
scale of the 1930s does not appear likely.
   ``Even if protectionist policies increase, the world's economies
probably would evolve into competing `free-trade areas.' So trade
would not contract as much as it did in the 1930s.''

<TEXT>
   Scientists pursued mysteries in outer and inner space in 1990,
mapping Venus, peering into the most distant heavens, and burrowing
ever more deeply into the tangled strands of DNA inside the living
cell.
   Here are 10 of the top scientific advances of 1990, notable for
the promise they hold of long-term changes in how we view our world
and deal with our infirmities.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>FIRST GENE THERAPY</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   W. French Anderson and colleagues at the National Institutes of
Health infused a thimbleful of genetically altered white blood
cells into the body of a 4-year-old girl with a rare immune system
disorder. The effort, an attempt to correct the inherited genetic
defect responsible for the disorder, was the first use of gene
therapy on a human being. ``Medicine has been waiting thousands of
years for this,'' said an NIH scientist.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>CANCER LINK TO `ELEPHANT MAN'S DISEASE'</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Researchers discovered the gene responsible for the illness
often mistakenly called elephant man's disease but known correctly
as neurofibromatosis. They then made the surprising finding that
the gene was a genetic cancer switch, suggesting that
neurofibromatosis was related to cancer.
   The tumors associated with neurofibromatosis may be a kind of
halfway point between normal tissue and cancer tissue. The finding
promises to speed research toward both a cure for neurofibromatosis
and an understanding and possible new treatments for cancers of the
brain and nervous system, scientists said.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>HUBBLE TELESCOPE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The star-crossed Hubble Space Telescope made headlines mostly
for its problems, but it did take some remarkable pictures. Among
them were the clearest pictures yet of Pluto and its moon Charon.
It also photographed Saturn in more detail than has been possible
from the ground.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>LONG-ACTING CONTRACEPTIVE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Norplant, the
first major new contraceptive for American women in about 30 years.
It consists of six thin capsules implanted under the skin of the
upper arm. It can prevent pregnancy for up to five years.
   Doctors say it is up to 99 percent effective. The major side
effect is menstrual irregularities.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>MAGELLAN'S EXPLORATION OF VENUS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The Magellan spacecraft began mapping the surface of Venus,
giving scientists much more detailed information on Earth's sister
planet. Radar pictures suggested that Venus's tallest peak might be
coated with fools' gold and revealed 15-mile-wide lava domes on the
planet's surface. It also relayed evidence that huge lava flows had
once covered more than half of the planet.
   Despite technical troubles that interrupted the spacecraft's
mapping and photographing operations, NASA scientists said the
mission added greatly to the storehouse of knowledge about the
planet.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>CHILDBIRTH AFTER MENOPAUSE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Doctors reported a new method of test-tube fertilization can
produce pregnancy in menopausal women. The technique involves
removing eggs from healthy donors, fertilizing them in a lab dish
and implanting them in the womb.
   ``The limits on childbearing years are now anyone's guess,'' the
New England Journal of Medicine editorialized. ``Perhaps they will
have more to do with the stamina required for labor and 2 a.m.
feedings than with reproductive function.''
</TEXT>
<HEAD>FETAL SURGERY</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Doctors announced they had corrected a severe defect in a
24{-week-old fetus. Experts said it was the most ambitious fetal
surgery yet.
   The surgeons partly removed the fetus, rearranged its internal
organs to correct a condition called fetal diaphragmatic hernia,
and tucked it back inside. The baby was born premature but healthy.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>CANCER GENE DEFECT CORRECTED IN TEST TUBE</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   A defective gene that leads to the growth of colon cancer tumors
was corrected when researchers inserted a normal copy of the gene
into tumors growing in a laboratory dish.
   The tumors carried a defect in a gene called p53, which is
believed to be a kind of anti-cancer gene - protecting against
cancer in its normal form but allowing cancer to grow when it is
defective. The study is an important step toward ultimately using
the exploding knowledge of cancer genetics to devise new
treatments, scientists said.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>APPROVAL OF AZT FOR AIDS CHILDREN</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. Food and Drug Administration extended the use of the
anti-AIDS drug AZT to children. AZT is the only drug so far known
to extend the lives of adults with AIDS, and researchers believe it
can do the same for children.
   ``The drug is now officially considered to be a standard therapy
for children with AIDS,'' said Health and Human Services Secretary
Louis Sullivan.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>DRUG REDUCES ASPECTS OF AGING</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Doctors showed that giving injections of genetically engineered
human growth hormone to old people can build their muscles, melt
away fat and reverse some of the ravages of two decades of aging in
as little as six months.
   The treatment is expensive and doesn't correct all the
infirmities of old age, such as failing eyes and dying brain cells.
But scientists said it may be as close to the fountain of youth as
they will ever get.

<HEAD>Tens of Thousands Still Die, But for Once a Glimmer of Hope</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DANIEL Q. HANEY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For the first time in the brief, tragic history of
AIDS, the news was not all bad in 1990.
   No one found a cure for the disease. Nor was there yet a vaccine
to prevent it. And certainly AIDS still spread and killed.
   But the unremitting gloom parted a bit. Scientists spoke of
hope, of real possibilities just over the medical horizon. The goal
was to keep healthy people from getting infected and to keep those
who were infected from falling ill.
   In 1990, it became more clear that such aims are realistic:
Controlling AIDS should be possible.
   Among the milestones of 1990:
   -During the first half of the year in the United States, fewer
deaths from AIDS were reported than during the last half of 1989.
It was the first such decline since record-keeping began in 1981
and probably results from treatment with the medicine AZT.
   -The epidemic clearly tapered off among homosexual men, who
account for almost two-thirds of AIDS cases in the United States.
   -Repeated experiments showed that vaccines can prevent AIDS in
chimps and monkeys.
   -Dozens of new AIDS drugs were in development, and two of them,
DDI and DDC, moved well along in human testing.
   Of course, the year also had its share of gloomy AIDS
developments:
   -Worldwide, the disease still spread rapidly. An estimated 8
million people are infected, 5 million of them in Africa, where in
some cities 20 percent of adults carry the AIDS virus. Unlike in
the United States, AIDS in Africa spreads mainly through
heterosexual intercourse, facilitated by untreated venereal
disease.
   -Ryan White, the Indianapolis boy who became a national symbol
of the fight against AIDS, died of the disease. So did the designer
Halston, female impersonator Craig Russell and an estimated 20,000
other Americans.
   -The U.S. Centers for Disease Control warned that AIDS is
becoming increasingly common among women. In 1991, it will be the
fifth leading cause of death for women of childbearing age.
   -Between October 1989 and October 1990, 43,000 new AIDS cases
were reported in the United States. During that period a year ago,
there were 35,000 new cases.
   While the disease tapered off in 1990 among gay men,
heterosexual transmission of AIDS is ominously on the rise. The
numbers are still small - 2,667 new U.S. cases in 1990. Most of
those who got AIDS this way were black and Hispanic women infected
through sex with male drug addicts.
   ``Our expectation is that even though the majority of cases
continue to be in white gay men, increasingly AIDS will become a
disease of poor black and Hispanic people, particularly IV drug
abusers, their sex partners and their children,'' said Dr. Harold
Jaffe of the Centers for Disease Control.
   Farthest along among new AIDS drugs is DDI, being used
experimentally by more than 15,000 people. Bristol-Myers Squibb
plans to ask for U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval to sell
it early in 1991. Hoffman-La Roche will decide early next year
whether it's ready to seek FDA approval for its new AIDS drug, DDC.
   Six vaccines are now in human testing as ways to prevent
infection with the AIDS virus, and six are being tried in an effort
to delay disease in people who already carry the virus.
   ``There is an upbeat tone,'' said Dr. Wayne Koff, chief of
federal AIDS vaccine research. ``There is a lot of work ahead, but
just the idea that a number of different approaches are protecting
in the animals is a good sign. It really comes down to what are the
best approaches and how fast can we do it.''

   Alan Weigel shrugs off the notion he is an adventurer. But few
would find his workplace anything but a dangerous other world where
few have been or would want to go.
   The Navy lieutenant commander and his two-man crew took the
mini-submarine Sea Cliff into the inky darkness 2{ miles down in
the Pacific in September to retrieve the lost cargo hatch from a
United Airlines Boeing 747.
   ``I wouldn't really consider myself an explorer,'' said Weigel,
34. ``I see what we do is really neat, but I very rarely question
that we are going to succeed.''
   The feat was among accomplishments that confirmed the spirit of
adventure was alive and well in 1990, a year in which the quest for
knowledge took explorers to the polar ice caps, unnamed mountains,
rainforests, outer space and the ocean floor.
   Some of the ventures were arduous. Sea Cliff dove eight times to
find the jetliner door; the crew spent up to 18 hours per dive in
cramped quarters. They sat in chilly darkness lit only by
phosphorescent sea life and the glow of instruments. It took five
hours alone to ascend the 14,100 feet to the surface.
   Retrieval of the airliner's hatch will allow investigators to
determine why it blew off the jumbo jet at 22,000 feet, sweeping
nine passengers to their deaths in 1989.
   ``We have made dives where the conditions were more difficult,''
Weigel said. ``The marvel of this came when you're all done and
realize how remarkable it was to find it.''
   While the Navy men's extraordinary endeavor got relatively
little fanfare, some of 1990's other adventure stories received
worldwide coverage.
   Television cameras were waiting in March when an international
team led by Will Steger of Ely, Minn., and Jean-Louis Etienne of
France completed a seven-month, 3,741-mile trek by dogsled across
frozen Antarctica.
   The group braved temperatures of 53 degrees below zero and a
two-month storm with winds of up to 50 mph. Steger accomplished a
similar feat at the North Pole in 1986.
   In the Arctic this year, Norwegian scientists joined with
Soviets to explore a northery route for ships traveling between
Europe and Asia. Back on land, the United Nations sponsored
international scholars tracing the travels of 13th-century explorer
Marco Polo. And under the sea, U.S. and Mexican divers explored the
U.S. Navy brig Somers, which sank off Veracruz in the
Mexican-American War.
   The relics of war excited explorers elsewhere as well.
   Divers viewed the wreck of the Civil War ironclad Monitor off
the North Carolina coast, for example. And a team of Americans
lowered themselves 250 feet into the Greenland icecap to a World
War II bomber that crash-landed 48 years ago and has since been
buried in the rising ice.
   Two sunken warships from the War of 1812 gave U.S. and Canadian
schoolchildren a chance to be explorers in their own classrooms.
Live video images were transmitted via satellite from a robot
submarine cruising wrecks of the merchant schooners Hamilton and
Scourge, lying at the bottom of Lake Ontario.
   Robert Ballard, leader of the expedition that found the Titanic
at the bottom of the Atlantic, narrated as the camera showed
cannons, railings and an intricately carved figurehead. Four lucky
students got to operate the sub via satellite link.
   Ballard said the project's goal was to interest youngsters in
science and exploration.
   ``The scientist has been portrayed in the media as a social
misfit,'' he said. ``Projects like these show science is done by
people with the right stuff, that it's fun and cool.''
   But much of the year's exploration went unheralded. Eileen
Harsch, manager of The Explorers Club, the New York institution
founded in 1906, says noteworthy expeditions went to the Arctic,
Mount Everest, the South China Sea, Egypt's Valley of the Kings and
elsewhere.
   The club funds research projects by high school and college
students, as well as by 40 young scientists in 1990. It also lends
its prestige and its red-white-and-blue flag, with compass logo, to
scores of other undertakings.
   One such expedition went to Ellesmere Island in the Canadian
Arctic, where many barren, glacier-choked mountains have never
borne a human footprint. Among the explorers was Dr. George Van B.
Cochran, an Ossining, N.Y., orthopedist and Explorers Club board
member who first traveled to Ellesmere in the 1970s.
   Cochran describes 24 hours of daylight in which the mountains
dramatically change their look as a low sun circles around them in
the sky.
   ``It's a beautiful area,'' he said. ``It's a good feeling to
know that you're the only people who have been here.''
   With plenty of places left on Earth to explore, Cochran said, he
had no doubt exploration will always be a part of human nature.
   ``It is the basic instinct to explore,'' he said. ``You can
suppress it but it's always there.''

<HEAD>Are You Sure That Voice Said Jon Bon Jovi?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY McSHANE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis Bon Jovi?
   One person believed 1990 would bring wedding bells for tattooed
New Jersey rocker Jon Bon Jovi and the former first lady: Irene
Hughes, one of 10 top psychics assembled by the National Enquirer
in December 1989 to peer into the year ahead.
   A visit to the Delphic optometrist appears in order, judging
from the sights Irene and her fellow seers saw coming in the 365
days now ending.
   ``In the shocker marriage of the year, Jackie Onassis will tie
the knot with young rock star Jon Bon Jovi,'' opined Hughes,
described by the Enquirer as ``the Chicago seer who has helped
oolve numerous crimes.''
   Hughes also incorrectly predicted that a barroom brawl over
another man's wife would lead to Bryant Gumbel's departure from the
``Today'' show. She offered no similar prognostication for Joe
Garagiola, who has both joined and left the morning news show in
the past 12 months, or the rumored-to-be-gone Deborah Norville.
   Not to be outdone, New York psychic John Monti - who reportedly
foresaw the 1981 shooting of President Reagan - offered this take
on the Kennedy clan for 1990.
   ``Ted Kennedy will suffer a mental breakdown and become
convinced he is his dead brother John. His ex-wife Joan will rush
to his side to nurse him back to health, rekindling their lost
love,'' Monti warned.
   Ted, of course, is well and remains a thorn in George Bush's
side.
   For all his problems, the president did dodge one bullet -
actually, something much, much bigger than a bullet - in the past
year.
   ``A meteorite will plow into the White House Rose Garden,''
predicted Maria Graciette, who eerily forecast the Manson family
murders. ``The First Family will be put in peril by levels of
radiation emitted by it.''
   Such myopic looks into the future were not limited to the pages
of the Enquirer. Both the well-known (syndicated astrologist Jeanne
Dixon) and the obscure (cable TV's psychic window-washer, Morris
Fonte) were a little off base this year.
   ``For President Bush, 1990 will be a year of vindication. His
policies at home and abroad will pay off big,'' Dixon wrote.
   Instead, Bush was locked in a bitter budget battle with Congress
and dispatched U.S. troops to the Middle East - two moves that led
to his approval rating hitting its lowest ebb since his arrival at
the White House.
   Fonte's flubs were a bit more enjoyable. ``Madonna marries a
prominent rocker around November,'' he said. ``Giuliani's
gubernatorial bid will rattle Mario Cuomo's skeletons.''
   End of the year update: Madonna, single. Rudolph Giuliani, never
a gubernatorial candidate. Cuomo, quietly elected to a third term.
   In addition to the Jackie Bon Jovi prediction, the Enquirer went
out on a limb with this celebrity romance: talk-show-host love
between Arsenio Hall and Oprah Winfrey. (Don't tell Steadman,
Oprah's oft-mentioned beau.)
   The Arsenio-Oprah union was to be professional, not just
personal, said Clarisa Bernhardt, who specializes in divining
earthquakes: ``(They) will team up onscreen as a singing-and-comedy
duo, remaking one of the old Bob Hope-Bing Crosby `Road' movies.''
   ``The Road to Syndication''? Doesn't matter; didn't happen.
Chill out, Bob; stop turning over in that grave, Bing.
   As for the rest of the decade, well, don't worry if you never
see the 21st century. The Enquirer team of 10 also offered these
prophecies for the next nine years:
   For space reasons, the ones already proven wrong - i.e, Mike
Tyson heavyweight champ until 1998, Liz Taylor marrying the late
Malcolm Forbes - will be deleted. But the future still holds ...
   -Telly Savalas will be hospitalized when he sucks on a poisoned
lollypop given to him by a crazed fan!
   -Pee Wee Herman will bulk up his body through weightlifting,
grow a Clark Gable-style moustache - and emerge as a movie leading
man with serious performances that will have critics raving!
   -Madonna (her again!) will take fertility drugs - and give birth
to a set of quintuplets!

   The nation's purchasing managers predicted a
recession will grip the economy in the first half of next year, but
forecast a turnaround by early next summer.
   The report, issued Tuesday by the National Association of
Purchasing Management Inc., reflects the views of many financial
analysts who say the economy has or soon will slip into a
recession.
   The association's semiannual economic forecast reported its
members were ``extremely pessimistic'' about the economy for the
first half of 1991.

   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Industrialist Armand Hammer was remembered as
a tireless crusader for international peace who improved the huan
condition by investing millions in education, medicine and the
arts.
   The flamboyant, globe-trotting chairman of Occidental Petroleum
Corp., the nation's 16th largest industrial company, died Monday at
his home in the Westwood district late Monday following a brief
illness. He was 92.
   There was speculation his death could make Occidental a takeover

   WASHINGTON (AP) - A big new decline in bank earnings makes it
increasingly clear the government fund insuring deposits will sink
to a historic low and need more money, a top regulator said.
   Hurt by sinking real estate values in the Northeast, commercial
banks earned $3.75 billion in the July-September quarter, down 29
percent from the previous quarter, the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp. said Tuesday.
   Profits slipped from $5.4 billion in the second quarter and $6.3
billion in the first three months of the year.
   FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman predicted continued bleak news
when results are reported for the final three months of the year.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - President Bush renominated a top banking
regulator over the reported objections of his chief of staff, John
Sununu.
   The White House, in a brief statement, said Tuesday that Bush
planned to appoint Robert L. Clarke to a second five-year term as
comptroller of the currency, the regulator of nationally chartered
banks. He must be confirmed by the Senate.

   VIENNA, Austria (AP) - OPEC oil ministers were told that crude
prices should remain robust as long as the military standoff
continues in the Persian Gulf region.
   But one minister called on the 13-nation cartel Tuesday to cap
its gushing output immediately to help bolster prices.
   ``In view of the situation in the oil markets at the moment, I
am worried about the production figure,'' said Iranian Oil Minister
Gholamreza Aqazadeh.
   The cartel, badly battered by the Gulf crisis, will open its
formal winter strategy session on Wednesday.

   WASHINGTON (AP) - The nation's foreign trade deficit, hurt by
higher oil prices and increased military spending from the Persian
Gulf crisis, widened a sharp 13.9 percent in the July-September
quarter, the government said.
   The Commerce Department said Tuesday the $25.6 billion
third-quarter deficit was up from a second-quarter deficit of $22.5
billion. It was the largest quarterly imbalance since a $26.7
billion gap in the final three months of 1989.
   The higher deficit in the July-September quarter was viewed as
especially ominous because an improving trade balance had been the
only bright spot in a lackluster economy this year.

   NEW YORK (AP) - A court order consolidating nearly 70,000
asbestos lawsuits against Eagle-Picher Industries Inc. got an
important legal boost, but representatives of injured workers
promised to fight the settlement effort.
   U.S. District Judge Jack B. Weinstein in Brooklyn on Tuesday
proceeded with imposing a class action for Eagle-Picher after a
request to place the company in involuntary bankruptcy in
Cincinnati was withdrawn.
   Weinstein issued written orders certifying the class, suspending
all asbestos claims involving Eagle-Picher but ordering the company
to begin paying $45 million to victims who already have settled
their cases.

   NEW YORK (AP) - The Equitable, the nation's third-largest life
insurer, said it will convert from a mutual company to one owned by
stockholders so that it can more easily bolster its troubled
finances.
   The Equitable, which has more than $135 billion in assets, would
become the the largest insurer to take such a step, industry
analysts said Tuesday.
   By converting from a mutual company, which is owned by its
policyholders, to a stockholder company, the Equitable will be able
to raise funds by selling shares to investors.

   LONDON (AP) - Shares in Britain's 12 regional electricity
companies surged as much as 66 percent on their first day of
trading, prompting opponents to accuse the government of selling
the industry off too cheaply.
   Prime Minister John Major on Tuesday rejected the charge, and
called the $10 billion privatization the most popular in the
government's decade-old program. It's also the biggest and most
complex.
   A package of 1,000 of the 12 stocks jumped to 1,578 pounds, or
$3,061, by the close of trading from an opening price of 1,000
pounds, or $1,940.

<HEAD>A Phone in Every Village, New Telmex Owners Promise</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The new owners of Mexico's phone system have
promised to double the size of the company within six years.
   A consortium including St. Louis-based Southwestern Bell, France
Cable &amp; Radio and Mexico's Grupo Carso conglomerate is buying a
controlling interest in Telefonos de Mexico, the state-owned
telephone company, for $1.76 billion.
   Grupo Carso is the lead partner and will run the newly
privatized Telmex.
   ``We promise the investment and effort necessary to grow
rapidly, 12 percent a year, a rate that means the size of the
company will double in six years,'' Grupo Carso President Carlos
Slim said Tuesday.
   He said the number of public telephones would be quadrupled in
four years and every village with at least 500 residents would have
access to a telephone by 1994.
   The emphasis, he said, will be on expanding and modernizing the
service by investing ``at the most intense rhythm possible.''
   Digital equipment, mobile telephones, better support services
for major clients and decentralization are top priority, he said.
   But it will take time, he warned, to give Mexico a truly modern,
efficient telephone system.
   ``One must have patience,'' he said.
   Slim also said the new owners will do their ``utmost to avoid
reducing personnel and instead train them for new jobs that
modernization will demand.''
   Telmex, which now provides only about 5 million lines to this
nation of more than 80 million people, has 50,000 people on its
payroll.
   Union opposition to the privatization eased somewhat after the
government agreed to provide $325 million in financing so the
employees can buy stock representing 4.4 percent of Telmex.
   In addition, the government plans to sell Telmex stock on the
Mexican and international stock exchanges.
   Slim said the resources, experience and technical expertise of
Southwestern Bell and France Cable &amp; Radio will be important to
Telmex's success
   Even though the foreign partners will not play a role in
administering Telmex, they will have a decision-making role.
   The privatization of Telmex is a centerpiece of President Carlos
Salinas de Gortari's campaign to modernize Mexico's economy and
attract foreign investment.

   Two inventors have crafted their own Santa's
workshop in a Fort Worth suburb, breaking into the tough toy
industry while helping others do the same.
   After running into closed doors at several leading toy
companies, Gary Blankenship and Dorian Sandlin formed a merry, if
loose-knit, band of toymakers who are developing their own
products.
   ``We try not to let the everyday drudgery of business,
bookkeeping bring us down on our creativity. The main thing here is
to have fun and create,'' Sandlin said.
   Blankenship, 34, and Sandlin, 39, started talking toys when they
met in church two years ago. Blankenship asked Sandlin, a
commercial artist, to design a package for a stuffed dog he'd
created.
   Sandlin then started pitching toy ideas of his own and last year
they formed Yapco Toy Co., named for that first stuffed dog, Yappie
the Yuppie Pup.
   The pair, who now operate out of a small office in Bedford,
first achieved success with KidsFlex, which hospitals have
purchased to help develop the eye-hand coordination of therapy
patients.
   The toy is a crescent-shaped tube filled with water and a rubber
ball. Grips at both ends of the tube are squeezed to move the ball
from one side to the other.
   The toy is the lead product for Yapco, which is projecting more
than $1.5 million in sales next year. Blankenship and Sandlin said
they are negotiating with a Japanese company to distribute KidsFlex
there.
   To finance more creations, Blankenship and Sandlin started
helping other inventors launch theirs. This year, they created
Toyquest Inc. to provide other toy creators advice and help with
packaging, patenting and making a prototype.
   Toyquest can develop simple toys, like card games, for as little
as $5,000, Sandlin said. More sophisticated toys, such as
electronics items, may take an investment 10 times that size.
Initial inquiries are free.
   ``We found ourselves in a situation where we go to toy companies
with an idea and they'd basically laugh you right out,'' Sandlin
said.
   ``We saw a market out there, friends of ours who had ideas, good
ideas from good people out there. That's what we wanted to tap into
and hopefully make part of the Yapco line. That would help us and
help them, too.''
   Inventors have the option of joining Yapco's toy line, and many
have. Blankenship and Sandlin and more than 30 of their clients
will unveil abot 50 products at the New York Toy Fair, the
industry's showcase event, in February.
   ``It's pretty exciting once you've had an idea and you see it
being exhibited in one of these shows. It's pretty spectacular,''
Blankenship said.
   ``Gary and Dorian really bring a quality agenda with Toyquest,''
said Dale Brandon, a Cleveland-based toy consultant. ``There's
plenty of room for champions to come along in this industry.''
   Brandon, who founded a specialized toy retail chain, is one of
26 people whom Blankenship and Sandlin turned to for advice and
guidance. He believes the toy industry has suffered by squeezing
out creative inventors such as them.
   ``We're still propped up by Teen-age Mutant Ninja Turtles and
sedentary video games,'' Brandon said.
   About 30 percent of the sales by toy giant Mattel Inc. are items
that come from idea submissions outside of the company, said Mattel
spokeswoman Donna Gibbs in Los Angeles.
   Mattel's Magic Nursery doll was an inventor's idea and has
become one of the company's top-selling items this holiday, Ms.
Gibbs said.
   ``There's a stable of inventors that we stay pretty much in
constant contact with,'' Ms. Gibbs said. Those inventors usually
have previous experience in the toy industry, though, she said.
   In addition to Yappie and KidsFlex, Yapco has developed a series
of stuffed cats built around Cruising Charlie, who looks like a
gaudy tourist, several educational products, some board games and a
few gag items.
   Yapco already sells some of the items in specialty stores in
California and Texas.

<HEAD>Eagle-Picher Action Just First Step in National Legal Crisis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge's order consolidating nearly 70,000
claims against Eagle-Picher Industries Inc. is a first - and by no
means guaranteed - step in resolving the nation's biggest product
liability problem, legal experts say.
   Lawyers for victims said they will appeal the move by U.S.
District Judge Jack B. Weinstein, which they claim would lead to a
settlement that short-changes workers suffering from lung cancer
and other diseases.
   Attorneys for other companies with large asbestos liabilities
plan to wait for the Eagle-Picher case to develop before seeking
class action status. And experts warned that Eagle-Picher's claims
represented just a fraction of a crowded legal docket.
   ``It is unprecedented, innovative and one way to attack the
problem, but it does not represent a solution,'' said Drew Berry, a
Newark, N.J., lawyer who represents several defendant companies.
   For instance, one hitch in a global settlement is that nearly
all of the 100,000 asbestos claims clogging state and federal
courts name several companies whose products were used at a work
place.
   Therefore, resolution of claims against Eagle-Picher would
represent only partial settlement of a victim's demands. Lawsuits
would remain on court dockets until claims against all defendants
were resolved.
   Nonetheless, Weinstein got an important legal boost Tuesday when
a federal bankruptcy judge in Cincinnati dismissed a motion to
throw Eagle-Picher into involuntary bankruptcy proceedings. That
could have suspended all action in the case.
   The motion was a last-minute attempt by victims' lawyers to stop
Weinstein from declaring the class action, which consolidates all
present and future claims against Eagle-Picher for settlement.
   In addition to declaring the class, Weinstein suspended all
asbestos litigation involving Eagle-Picher but ordered the company
to begin paying $45 million to victims who already have settled
their cases.
   A proposed settlement plan calls for creating a trust estimated
at $625 million over 20 years to pay Eagle-Picher claimants.
Victims representatives complained it offers too little money, few
safeguards and allows the company to pay its bills but not settle
claims.
   ``Under the plan, asbestos victims are the last in line to
receive awards for compensation for their illnesses and deaths,''
said Heather Maurer, executive director of the 18,000-member
Asbetos Victims of America.
   Plaintiffs lawyers said they would challenge the class action in
the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on numerous legal grounds.
They said Weinstein lacked jurisdiction, appointed lawyers unfit to
represent their clients and supported a plan that would
short-change victims.
   Also unresolved is whether Weinstein can usurp jurisidiction
from cases now in state courts. In addition, no method of payment
has been established, which both victim and company lawyers would
be likely to fight.
   ``We believe the judge does not have the power to do what he is
purporting to do,'' said Fred Baron, a Dallas lawyer for several
thousand victims, who said attorneys would mount a ``frontal
attack'' on Weinstein's order.
   The battle over Eagle-Picher could shape the future of what is
by far the biggest product liability problem ever to confront the
U.S. legal system. Cases clog state and federal courts nationwide
and new claims are being filed daily.
   Asbestos was used widely in insulation, boilers, automobile
brake linings and other products. Illness from inhaling asbestos
fibers often takes decades to appear, and cases have been mounting
since the early 1970s.
   Weinstein favors mass settlements to save the time, enormous
cost and damage to companies' reputations in bankruptcy
proceedings. But he is charting new waters, and some companies with
large asbestos liabilities said they were not eager to plunge in.
   ``We're very interested in what the judge is doing. We have some
question about whether he can pull it off,'' said John O'Brien,
associate general counsel of Keene Corp., which is struggling to
cope with about 70,000 lawsuits stemming from insulation products
made by a subsidiary for more than 50 years.
   More than a dozen companies already have filed for bankruptcy
court protection because of their asbestos liabilites, including
Celotex Corp. and National Gypsum Co. in the last six weeks.
   To declare a class action, companies must demonstrate their
funds are so limited that they cannot meet claims and continue
normal operations. Eagle-Picher said it faces bankruptcy soon
without a resolution.

<HEAD>Influential Trade Group Predicts Recession</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROB WELLS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A prominent trade group predicts the nation will
dip into a recession next year, but says export growth and a strong
dollar will brighten the economy by next summer.
   The National Association of Purchasing Management issued its
semiannual economic forecast Tuesday. It matches the views of many
financial analysts who say the economy has entered or soon will
slip into a recession.
   ``The only difference I have with them is my recession has
already started,'' said Edward J. Campbell, senior economist with
the investment firm Brown Brothers Harriman &amp; Co.
   The trade group, which is composed of purchasing managers at
manufacturing companies nationwide, reported its members were
``extremely pessimistic'' about the economy for the first half of
1991. The association conducts regular research on the economy,
including a monthly survey of its members.
   ``Although pessimistic about a recession in 1991, purchasers
expect a recovery to begin in the later half of the year fueled by
continued relatively strong growth in exports and a declining trend
in inflation,'' said Robert J. Bretz, chairman of the association's
business survey committee.
   Overall economic growth will be 2.2 percent next year, with
costs for wages and benefits rising 4.2 percent, the report
predicted.
   The association also dramatically cut its forecast for capital
spending in 1990. In May, it predicted an 8.1 percent increase in
capital spending this year. Now it has reduced the growth estimate
to 1.4 percent.
   The group's purchasing managers index for November, first
reported last week, stood at 41.3 percent - its lowest point in
eight years. The index, developed in conjuction with the U.S.
Commerce Department, gauges production, employment, new orders,
vendor performance and inventory.
   Companies surveyed also reported they are operating at only 82
percent of their normal capacity, down from 85 percent a year ago.
   Mild inflation is forecast, despite the recent runup in oil
prices spurred by the Persian Gulf crisis.
   ``It sounds like a pretty good and standard forecast for next
year,'' said Mike Penzer, senior economist for Bank of America in
San Francisco.
   Penzer agreed with the group's prediction of export growth and a
stronger dollar next year. But economist Lacy Hunt disagreed with
the association's forecast that the economy will expand through
enhanced trade.
   ``Exports are not going to be the panacea that we hoped for,''
said Hunt, chief U.S. economist with the Hong Kong Bank Group Inc.
in New York.
   The softening economies in Japan and Germany mean there will be
``a smaller pie in which to generate these exports,'' he added.
   Several analysts agreed with the association's prediction of a
short-lived recession. Giulio Martini, economist for the investment
firm Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co. Inc., said prospects for a faster
economic rebound are enhanced because businesses aren't burdened
with large inventories. Overbuilt inventories accelerate the shock
of a recession, he said.
   The 40th semiannual forecast is consistent with the
association's earlier predictions of economic hard times. In its
report last week, the group said the economy continued to decline
for the fifth consecutive month, leading to a drop in new orders
and declines in production and employment.

   Bank earnings are headed down and won't
reverse course until the economy emerges from its slump, analysts
say.
   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said Tuesday that the
nation's 12,399 commercial banks earned $3.75 billion in the
July-September quarter, down 29 percent from $5.4 billion in the
econd quarter. Banks earned $6.3 billion in the first three months
of the year.
   FDIC Chairman L. William Seidman blamed the deterioration on a
rise in sour real estate loans, particularly in the Northeast. He
described the outlook for the final three months of the year as
bleak and declined to predict when bank earnings would recover.
   The problem ``will drag on just as long as the economy is in
whatever it's in now,'' Seidman said. ``I won't say the R-word,''
he said, referring to the Bush administration's reluctance to
describe the economic downturn as a recession.
   Economist Paul Getman of Regional Financial Associates in West
Chester, Pa., said, ``I wish I could say it's going to get better,
but it's going to get worse before it gets better.''
   Seidman warned that banks' problems are translating into
mounting strain on the government insurance fund protecting bank
deposits.
   He raised his estimate of the FDIC fund's 1990 loss from $3
billion to $4 billion or more and said it was becoming
``increasingly clear'' that banks will have to inject more money
into the fund.
   The loss would leave only $9 billion to protect $2 trillion in
deposits.
   ``We're probably under more pressure in the banking system than
we have been at any time since the 1930s,'' said economist David
Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co. ``I'd look for continued strains
on the system in general.''
   Jones said the health of the economy and of banking are
deteriorating in a vicious circle: slumping economic conditions
create loan losses for banks. That causes banks to cut back
lending, which fuels the economic slump.
   Still, 89 percent of commercial banks made money in the third
quarter. The profitability of small banks, those with less than
$100 million in assets, suffered only slightly, but problems in
larger institutions in the East dragged down the industry totals.
   Banks posted losses in the District of Columbia and eight
states: Arizona, Connecticut, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New
Hampshire, New Jersey and New York.
   Delinquent real estate loans, in which borrowers are three
months or more behind on their payments, rose 12.9 percent to $31.3
billion in the third quarter.
   The real estate delinquency rate was highest in Rhode Island,
14.66 percent, followed by Arizona, Massachusetts, Connecticut,
Texas, Oklahoma, New Hampshire, Louisiana, New York, the District
of Columbia, New Jersey, New Mexico and Colorado.
   However, the rate was headed down in the Southwestern states and
up in the East.
   Getman noted that recent weakness in West Coast real estate
markets has yet to surface in bank data. ``The other shoe has yet
to drop and the other shoe is California,'' he said.
   Consumer loan delinquencies also are rising. They were up 10.4
percent to $14 billion in the third quarter. Getman predicted that,
as the recession progresses, credit card delinquencies will emerge
as the next big area of concern to bankers.
   For the first time, the FDIC issued a report on the 479 savings
banks it supervises. These state-chartered institutions - a hybrid
of a commercial bank and a savings institution - are located
primarily in the Northeast and concentrate on real estate lending
even more than commercial banks.
   They lost $771 million during the third quarter. During the
first nine months of the year, 35 percent of the savings banks lost
money and as a whole lost $1.2 billion, compared with $20 million
in earnings during the same period of 1989.
   However, they remain well capitalized. On average, their owners'
investment represented 7.02 percent of the savings banks' assets.
Capital acts as a cushion between losses and the insurance fund.

   Thomson-CSF SA, one of France's biggest defense
contractors, plans to lay off 3,800 to 4,000 employees because of
declining demand for military products, union sources said
Wednesday.
   The sources, who requested anonymity, said Thomson will announce
details of the payroll cut at a worker-management committee meeting
on Thursday.
   Thomson, citing legal restrictions, refused to comment.
   The reported layoffs would involve more than 10 percent of the
company's work force of 37,800.
   Alain Gomez, Thomson's chairman, told financial analysts last
month that the company would undertake a ``reconfiguration'' in
1991 to cope with declining demand for its defense-related
products.
   He said annual growth of the world defense and electronics
market will slow to 1.5 percent over the next eight years from 8.5
percent in the 1980s.
   Gomez also said the company's profit in 1990 will decline
compared with 1989, but predicted that earnings will recover over
the next three years.
   Thomson's consolidated revenue in 1989 was 33.693 billion
francs, or about $6.7 billion at current exchange rates.

<HEAD>Boeing Implements Drug Plan Over Union Objections</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Boeing Co. plan for handling alcohol and other
drug abuse has been implemented over vehement objections by the
aerospace giant's largest union.
   Under the policy put in effect Tuesday, Boeing's approximately
150,000 U.S. employees, from janitors to executives, may be tested
after on-the-job accidents or when company officials find a
reasonable suspicion that an employee used drugs.
   ``There are sufficient checks and balances built into the
testing portion of our policy so that it can't be applied
arbitrarily or capriciously,'' said Russ Young of Boeing.
   Employees found to have prohibited substances in their system
could enter a treatment program after the first offense but would
face dismissal for a second offense. Employees who voluntarily
entered the treatment program would be allowed a second chance.
   In the past, Boeing officials say, employees caught with or
using drugs on company property were fired.
   `I think the workers are going to be astonished, as I am, that
the company would implement an agreement that the membership
doesn't want,'' said Tom Baker, president of International
Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District Lodge 751.
   ``They believe that they should be able to test by any reliable
source, any source that they consider reliable, whatever that
means,'' Baker said, adding the union thinks that could lead to
abuse by management.
   Members of the union, which represents about 40,000 Boeing
workers in and around Seattle and another 10,000 in Portland, Ore.,
and Wichita, Kan., voted 86 percent last month to reject the plan
sought by Boeing.
   Baker said then the plan would foster ``a police-state
mentality.''
   ``We are presently in discussion with our legal counsel to see
what appropriate legal action we should take, whether that be
through the courts or whether that be through unfair labor practice
charges'' filed with the National Labor Relations Board, Baker
said.
   In negotiations during August, September and October, union
leaders sought unsuccessfully to impose greater limits on testing
and gain greater assurances of confidentiality under a plan
administered by both the union and Boeing.
   A second Boeing union, the Seattle Professional Engineering
Employees Association, agreed in September to accept the company's
plan. The association represents about 27,000 Boeing engineers and
other professional workers.

<HEAD>Marvin Davis Reveals First Interstate Stake, Suggests Sale</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By E. SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Billionaire investor Marvin Davis revealed
that he is a major stockholder of First Interstate Bancorp and
urged the company to cut overhead or consider a buyout by another
banking firm.
   In a surprise letter Tuesday, Davis expressed dissatisfaction
with First Interstate management.
   ``Along with other First Interstate stockholders we have watched
with distress First Interstate's deteriorating financial condition
and results of operation over the past few months,'' Davis wrote.
   ``This is an ideal time for the First Interstate board to either
achieve the operating economies which are long overdue or to
consider a sale of the bank to another banking institution.''
   First Interstate is struggling to rebuild itself after massive
problems at its Arizona and Texas banks contributed to a $124.5
million loss last year.
   First Interstate's stock traded as high as $48 per share during
the past year, but recently has fallen to about half that level.
The stock rose 37{ cents to close at $25.12{ a share Tuesday in New
York Stock Exchange trading.
   Davis wrote to Chairman and Chief Executive Edward M. Carson,
who replaced the fiery Joseph J. Pinola as head of the company last
year.
   ``We've seen (Davis') letter and we do take his concerns
seriously as we do with all shareholder concerns,'' said Ken
Preston, a First Interstate spokesman.
   ``But we're also encouraged by the progress we've made so far
for the first nine months,'' Preston said. ``Under our new
management team, we've returned to profitability this year.''
   Davis revealed that his family interests own a ``significant
amount'' of First Interstate stock. He didn't say how much,
although investors are required to reveal their stakes to the
Securities and Exchange Commission when they acquire more than 5
percent.
   He noted in his letter that John Neff, portfolio manager of the
Windsor mutual fund, has said the fund might join other big
shareholders in pressuring First Interstate to put itself on the
block.
   However, Neff made his suggestion in a letter eight months ago
when talk of consolidation in the banking industry was rife and
First Interstate's major problems seemed more immediate.
   ``This is hardly an ideal time to sell a bank or parts of a
bank,'' Neff said Tuesday.

<TEXT>
   Texas Instruments Inc. has reached a new 10-year
royalty agreement with Toshiba Corp. of Japan covering a broad
class of Texas Instruments' microchip technology, the company
announced.
   Terms of the agreement announced Tuesday were not disclosed. But
analysts say the deal - the first of several expected between TI
and Japanese chipmakers - could net the Dallas-based technology
firm hundreds of millions of dollars.
   The pact stems from a 1986 patent infringement lawsuit filed by
TI against nine semiconductor manufacturers. It replaces a
five-year agreement expiring at the end of the year.
   Terri West, spokeswoman for Texas Instruments, said the company
expects the agreement to increase Toshiba's annual royalty
payments. The payments will be based on worldwide sales of Toshiba
semiconductors.
   Texas Instruments has been negotiating with other semiconductor
manufacturers whose licensing agreements also expire at the end of
the year. They include most of the nine companies TI sued in 1986,
Ms. West said.
   Toshiba is the first of the companies to renegotiate the royalty
arrangement. The lawsuit also named Fujitsu Ltd., Hitachi Ltd., Oki
Electric Industry Co., Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., NEC
Corp., Mitsubishi Electric Corp. and Sharp Corp. of Japan and
Samsung Co. of South Korea.
   Texas Instruments holds basic patents on the integrated circuit,
the memory chip and other semiconductor technology.
   In recent years, the company has been aggressively enforcing its
semiconductor patents, suing U.S. and foreign manufacturers it
believes are using its technology without paying royalties.

<HEAD>Survey: Gulf Crisis Pivotal for Energy Industry</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL GRACZYK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Persian Gulf crisis should be viewed as a
``decisive event'' in energy history and its outcome will change
the dynamics of the oil industry, an annual oil and gas study says.
   ``Significant changes have occurred in world oil fundamentals
that will have profound and lasting effects after the conclusion of
the current Gulf crisis,'' Victor Burk, managing director of oil
and gas industry services for Arthur Andersen &amp; Co., said Tuesday.
   Daniel Yergin, president of Massachusetts-based Cambridge Energy
Research Associates, said he believed the crisis will lead to an
emphasis on energy security and diversification of supply sources,
plus give ``a new kick to exploration and production around the
world.''
   The comments came as Cambridge and the Houston office of Arthur
Andersen released their annual survey of world oil trends.
   The survey found the financial considerations of the Persian
Gulf crisis to be substantial for OPEC.
   In 1986, for example, OPEC earnings fell to $77 billion. This
year, the trends survey estimated OPEC earnings could top $160
billion.
   The effect of the higher prices, however, also has been to cut
demand somewhat.
   ``By November ... demand had fallen because of higher prices and
economic downturn,'' the survey showed. ``The world oil market was
in balance - but a very precarious balance with no margin for
error.''
   Yergin said a war in the Persian Gulf would send oil prices
soaring, but he believed the jump would be short-term.
   The annual survey showed world oil consumption in 1989 reached
record highs, while U.S. consumption was at its highest level in 10
years.
   At the same time, non-OPEC oil production was declining for the
first time since 1973 with two major oil producers - the United
States and the Soviet Union - both posting production drops that
are expected to continue.
   Yergin referred to the United States and the Soviet Union as the
``two sick men of world oil.''
   In the United States, production has declined by 2 million
barrels a day from 1986 to summer of 1990.
   ``The loss of that output is a greater volume than Kuwait was
producing before the Gulf crisis began,'' Yergin said. ``In other
words, the fall in U.S. production is as though a major oil
exporting country has been obliterated or snuffed out.''
   Yergin said the effects were momentous both in the United States
and overseas because the decline upset the global balance in oil
production.
   ``In this country, there's been a hazy fog where people have not
recognized the significance of the seriousness of this drop,'' he
said.
   The result, according to the survey, was U.S. oil imports rose
from 4.4 million barrels a day in 1985 to 7.7 million a day in
first half of 1990.
   In the Soviet Union, the sweeping fundamental changes and the
fall of communism in eastern Europe are having effects on the
energy industry worldwide as well because of reduced production and
export of Soviet oil, Yergin said.
   But he said the changes in the Soviet Union also meant
opportunities for oil companies.
   ``Here is a door that was slammed shut 70 years ago,'' he said.
``That door has been abruptly opened. The problem they (oil
companies) face is who to deal with. The question is: `Who's in
charge here?'''
   Yergin said the threat of an economic recession also hangs over
the industry.

<HEAD>Quasar Ordered to Pay $2.5 in Discrimination Lawsuit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A U.S. District Court ordered Quasar Co. to pay
nearly $2.5 million to three former employees charging
discrimination on the basis of age and nationality, officials said.
   Quasar also must pay court costs and attorney fees, making the
total judgment greater than $3 million, said attorney Norman
Berger, who represents the plaintiffs. The exact total of those
fees was not available late Tuesday.
   Quasar was found guilty of violating both the Civil Rights Act
of 1964 and the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, according to
Berger.
   ``This is the first case we're aware of that, after a trial, a
Japanese company has been found guilty of this type of
discrimination,'' Berger said.
   The company said it disagreed with the ruling and intended to
appeal.
   Quasar, based in suburban Elk Grove Village, handles sales and
distribution of consumer electronics and employees about 50 people.
The company is a division of the Japanese-owned Matsushita Electric
Corp. of America.
   Quasar officials said they were disappointed in the case's
outcome.
   ``We are fully confident of the merits of our position and
believe the court has made substantial errors in both law and in
fact,'' said Quasar spokesman John Monaco, reading an official
statement. ``Of course, we intend to appeal the decision and firmly
believe that ultimately our position in this case will be upheld.''
   The plaintiffs, John Fortino, Carl Meyers and F. William Schulz,
were fired from their management positions during Quasar's 1986
company restructuring and 50 percent work force reduction, Berger
said.
   Before the company's reorganization, Quasar had 89 managerial
employees. After the restructuring, the staff was cut to 23, Berger
said. Of that total 14 were Americans and nine were Japanese, he
said.
   ``The evidence showed that Quasar had full knowledge of the laws
which prohibit discrimination, and yet it tried to circumvent these
laws,'' Berger said. ``The court found that Quasar would not have
fired any of our clients but for their national origin.''
   In a 1988 ruling, a jury awarded $1.9 million to the plaintiffs
in settlement of the age discrimination lawsuit. All three were
over 50 at the time of their dismissal. The three were told that
their jobs were being eliminated, but their functions were
reassigned to younger people, Berger said.
   U.S. District Judge James Alesia upheld the jury's 1988 decision
in post-trial motions and assessed additional fines in the
nationality discrimination case Friday.

<HEAD>Analysts Say Occidental May Cut Dividend, Sell Assets</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Hammer-Memorial</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By E. SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   With its longtime chairman gone, the future
of Occidental Petroleum Corp.'s dividend is in question and the
company may sell some assets, analysts say.
   Armand Hammer's death at 92 on Monday sparked a surge of
activity on Wall Street, where Occidental stock was the most
actively traded stock Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange. It
rose $1.87 to $22.62 per share in heavy trading Tuesday on the New
York Stock Exchange - a gain of 9 percent.
   Some analysts said the $2.50 per share annual dividend appears
in jeopardy.
   Several said an outsider may borrow heavily to buy Occidental,
then profit by selling off its pieces: oil and gas; chemicals;
natural gas pipelines; coal; beef and pork processing. A less
likely scenario had Occidental management buying the company.
   But the economic downturn, combined with dried up junk bond and
bank lending for takeovers, has made a buyout seem less likely for
Occidental, the 16th largest U.S. industrial company with about $20
billion in annual sales.
   Occidental itself may now sell some of its holdings to reduce
its staggering $8 billion debt. One possible sale would be a 5
percent interest in the company that makes Arm &amp; Hammer baking
soda, which people mistakenly thought Hammer founded.
   Ray R. Irani, Occidental's president and chief operating
officer, immediately succeeded Hammer as chairman and chief
executive. He declined Tuesday to discuss Occidental's future.
   Warren Shimmerlik, an independent energy analyst, said under
Irani's management Occidental will likely undergo a ``major
philosophical change'' and significant restructuring.
   ``Hammer's style prevented a rationalization that would be
beneficial to the company,'' Shimmerlik said, noting Hammer
preferred to position Occidental as an income-producing stock
rather than a growth company.
   ``There didn't seem to be any real momentum in the company.''
   Eugene Nowak, vice president and director of the energy group at
Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., said he expects Occidental ``to take a
very hard look at all the assets. ... The company will move from an
entrepreneurial concern to professional management.''
   Nowak said Occidental was an unlikely takeover candidate.
   ``The company has been left in very strong hands,'' he said.
``The star of Occidental's operations will continue to be foreign
energy exploration and production.''
   Alan Gaines, president of energy stock specialist Gaines,
Berland Inc., took a bleaker perspective.
   ``This is not a growth company,'' Gaines said. ``And I don't
think they're saleable.''
   He said Occidental's dividend was in immediate jeopardy.
   ``The death of Hammer portends a dividend reduction,'' Gaines
said. ``I think the company has very poor fundamentals and I don't
think the dividend can be maintained - it was imprudent to begin
with.''
   He said Hammer ``is the one who controlled the banks and the
directors were beholden to him.'' Gaines said some banks may be
unwilling to support what Gaines feels is an excessive dividend and
may call on Occidental to improve its balance sheet.
   Gaines said the company is highly leveraged, with a dividend
payment of $800 million annually and crippling interest expense.
   ``That's $2.1 billion out the door before taxes, gone,'' Gaines
said. ``And what buyer is going to assume $8 billion in debt? It's
an overleveraged petrochemical company. Who wants it?''

<HEAD>New Measures to Support German Exports to East</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY THORSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Some 2,000 companies in former East Germany will
be able to keep their export markets in the Soviet Union and other
East European countries under measures announced Wednesday.
   Exports to the ruble-based trading bloc were economic mainstays
of East Germany before it united with West Germany in October. But
the conversion to the West German mark threatens to put an end to
such business, depriving wobbly economies in the east of their
traditional source of modern equipment.
   German economists say hundreds of thousands of jobs in eastern
Germany depend on continuation of exports to the east.
   Officials of the Treuhandanstalt, the trust agency charged with
disposing of most of the former state-owned assets of East Germany,
said the government-backed Hermes export insurance agency will
support, under certain conditions, new contracts that companies in
eastern Germany are able to make with Soviet or other East European
customers.
   The contracts must be in hard currency, and the Treuhand will
have to verify that the German companies are making progress toward
the efficiency standards of the free-market economy, Wolfram
Krause, the Treuhand's finance director, told a news conference.
   Many companies in former East Germany that the Treuhand hopes to
privatize face a deadline of Jan. 1 to convert long-term contracts
from the inconvertible Soviet ruble into hard currency.
   The German government is backing $10.8 billion worth of such
ruble-denominated east-bound exports in 1990, Krause said. That
support expires at the end of this year, but the new export
insurance will help to continue the valuable direction of business.
   The companies will be more attractive to purchasers, he said,
adding, ``We know that this is the time to sell.''
   ``What makes eastern Germany so attractive for investment is
this is the only country in the world where you have two directions
of the economy,'' said Treuhand spokesman Thomas Schneider. ``West
Germany has the western direction, and East Germany has the eastern
direction. If you are looking for a new market, it will be in the
east.''
   Eastern German companies will only be attractive in the future
if they retain their markets in the east, he said, and the export
insurance measure was one way to support such business.
   The Soviet Union is an especially important customer for
concerns in eastern Germany, he said, showing Treuhand statistics
that gave the Soviets 80 percent of the production of excavators,
cranes and rail equipment; 70 percent of production of fishing
vessels and 60 percent of eastern Germany's electronics output.

   The stock market headed higher today, bidding to
revive its yearend rally.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 13.86 points to
2,600.00 in the first half hour of trading.
   Gainers outnumbered losers by about 5 to 4 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 536 up, 412 down and
573 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 25.36 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Since climbing to a 2{-month high for the Dow Jones industrials
a week ago, the market has run into resistance from sellers.
   But analysts noted that the ensuing pullback proved to be
shallow, suggesting that stocks were still benefiting from solid
support not far below their recent levels.
   Brokers also say many investors seem convinced that the Federal
Reserve will take whatever steps are necessary to cushion the
effects of the economic slump.
   With assistance from the Fed, many optimists in the financial
world believe, the economy could begin to show renewed signs of
vigor as early as mid-1991.
   Nike class B shares gained 1} to 37{. The company said its
earnings for the fiscaal quarter ended Nov. 30 came in above
analysts' estimates.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks rose
.58 to 179.00. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was up .10 at 306.21.
   On Tuesday the Dow Jones industrial average fell 10.64 points to

<HEAD>EC Maintains Controls over Subsidies to Auto Industry</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The European Community Commission said
Wednesday it had extended for two years its controls over state
subsidies to the beleaguered auto industry in the EC's 12 member
states.
   The commission's authority to bar large state awards to car
manufacturers ``is crucial to ensure that a climate of normal and
fair competition prevails'' as the industry approaches an uncertain
future, the commission said in a statement.
   The commission's 2-year-old framework says all state subsidies
exceeding 12 million European currency units, or $16.4 million,
must be approved by the EC's executive commission.
   The commission said it fears that current intense competition in
the EC auto industry could push some member states into approving
huge subsidies if the commission's powers to curb state aids were
ended.
   Separately, the EC allowed France to fund 40 percent of a $240
million research project between car makers Renault and Peugeot for
fuel-efficient automobiles with clean-burning engines.
   The commission said it approved French aid of about $97 million
for the eight-year project, which will involve several research
organizations and focus on clean-burning engines, development of a
new two-stroke engine and electric and gas-powered vehicles.
   The commission said the framework on member subsidies was vital
in preparing for a unified motor vehicle market once the trade bloc
unifies after 1992.
   It said clamping down on huge state subsidies was ``the best
guarantee that the industry will be able to improve its
competitiveness on world markets.''
   EC demand for cars in 1990 and 1991 is expected to decline
before returning to a longer-term annual growth of 1 percent a
year, the commission said.
   It said the ``uneertain outlook for the industry as a whole adds
to the case for vigilance in the control of state aids.''

<HEAD>Data General Chairman to Retire</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WESTBORO, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Data General Corp. today announced today
that Edson D. de Castro, the 52-year-old chairman of the troubled
computer maker, would resign on Dec. 31.
   Vice Chairman Herbert J. Richman, 56, will retire at the end of
its fiscal year in September.
   A company statement gave no reasons for the retirements of the
two executives, who helped found Data General in 1968.
   Ronald L. Skates, the company president and chief executive
officer, praised de Castro as ``an industry legend.'' He also
commended Richman for leading the company's sales and marketing
efforts. Skates said Richman deserved much of the credit for Data
General's rapid rise in the market for mid-range minicomputers.
   That market has fallen on hard times. Data General has not
enjoyed a profitable year since 1985, when its employment peaked at
17,700. Since then, the company has suffered a string of losses,
and employment has shrunk to around 9,500.
   Analysts say Data General has responded with some strong
products, particularly its AViiON workstations. But the
minicomputer slump has continued to act as a drag on earnings,
hampering the company's repeated efforts to turn a profit.
   The company lost $139 million in its most recent fiscal year.
Revenues were $1.22 billion, compared with $1.31 billion the year
before.
   Neither de Castro nor Richman will seek re-election to the board
of directors, but Richman will continue to serve as executive vice
president for the AsiaPacific region until he retires, the company
said.

<HEAD>Delta Announces Bonus Program for Frequent Fliers
^Eds: RETRANSMITTING to fix coding.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Delta Air Lines has fired a new salvo in the
battle for business fliers, announcing a bonus ticket program for
frequent fliers.
   Delta said Tuesday it will award a free ticket to any member of
its frequent flier club who completes eight ``segments'' on coach
fares between Dec. 15 and March 15. The program also gives
passengers a choice of first-class upgrades rather than free trips.
   Two round trips with a change of planes each way would provide
eight segments. If the flights were non-stop or one-stop with no
plane change, it would take four round trips to qualify.
   The bonus was announced five days after rival Eastern Airlines
made a similar move. The Eastern program offers a weekend ticket
for $91 to anyone who makes a single round trip at a ``corporate
rate'' fare during December or January.
   Bonus tickets for Eastern, which is trying to survive by gaining
business fliers at Delta's expense, are redeemable from Jan. 3
through June 18. Delta's are good for travel between May 15 and
Dec. 31, of 1991.
   Delta spokesman Neil Monroe said this morning that the latest
promotion comes at a time when sluggish demand for air travel and
higher fuel costs are hurting the air travel industry, but he said
the freebies should not harm the bottom line at Delta because most
passengers are expected to opt for the first-class upgrades.
   That costs Delta virtually nothing, he said.
   Delta will limit the number of seats available on each flight
for passengers who choose the free travel, Monroe said.

<HEAD>Auto Struggles to Continue, Ford President Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The recession the nation's auto industry
slipped into this year likely will continue in 1991, when car and
truck sales are expected to dip by 5 percent, Ford Motor Co.'s
president said today.
   In a year-end briefing with reporters, Philip Benton estimated
automakers would sell 14.2 million cars and trucks this year in the
United States.
   ``Beyond that, there remains considerable uncertainty,'' he
said, adding Ford estimates U.S. industry sales of 13.5 million
vehicles in 1991. He said a soft U.S. economy, consumer caution and
the continuing Middle East crisis lend to the industry's
uncertainty.
   General Motors Corp., Ford and Chrysler Corp. all expect to lose
money in the fourth quarter, which would be the first quarter since
mid-1981 that all the Big Three posted losses.
   ``The relative weakness is in North America,'' Benton said.
``This is basically a North American problem.''
   Ford counts on North America for a large portion of its profits
to offset such overseas troubles as weak vehicle demand in Britain
and Spain, an economic crisis in Brazil and three European labor
strikes.
   Benton said he expects ``substantial improvement'' overseas,
especially in Europe, but looks for North America ``to continue to
have a difficult year in '91.
   ``Profits are under enormous pressure in North America, and they
started out from an abysmal level.''
   On other matters, Benton said:
   -Ford's dividend of 75 cents a share appears safe for now.
However, because of the econoimc and Mideast uncertainty, ``you
can't say the dividend is secure.''
   -Ford will cut an unspecified number of white-collar jobs beyond
the normal 5 percent attrition rate to trim costs. He said a 1- to
2-percent cut is probable. Ford's 1989 annual report said 66,900 of
its 175,100 workers were salaried.
   -Product development into the mid-1990s is on track. ``The '92
push is going to be very heavy in trucks.''
   -Ford is moving cautiously into Eastern Europe, giving priority
to establishing dealers, parts and service networks for cars
brought into the region from Western Europe. ``I don't see us, in
the near term, with any assembly plants.''

   The cash-strapped city government, rebuffed
by Wall Street in its last attempt to pay its bills, has made
another formal proposal to sell short-term notes.
   Mayor W. Wilson Goode said today the proposal had been sent
Monday night to several potential investors, including the city
pension fund and local banks.
   A statement released by Goode's press secretary, Karen
Warrington, said the city hoped to complete the deal by the end of
next week. It did not disclose how much the city was seeking.
   Goode and other state and local Democratic leaders previously
have said the city would need $250 million to $300 million to avoid
running out of sufficient cash to meet city payroll, vendor
payments and other bills until major tax payments come due in
February and March.
   A $375 million note sale flopped in September amid concerns
about the city's shaky fiscal condition. Its credit rating has
dropped to junk-bond levels, the lowest among major U.S. cities.
   Goode said the proposed transaction includes ``a process by
which state funds otherwise owed to the city between now and May
31, 1991, would be paid by the state directly to a trustee for the
noteholders.''
   He said the arrangement, approved Tuesday by state Treasurer
Catherine Baker Knoll, would lend additional security to the deal.
   Many workers and retirees have opposed using any of the $1.5
billion city pension fund to buy Philadelphia notes. The Board of
Pensions and Retirement meets Thursday and Friday.
   The Public School Employees' Retirement Board, which oversees
the $16 billion state teachers pension fund, also meets Thursday
and Friday.
   Each pension fund is limited to buying 25 percent of a debt
issue, or $75 million of a $300 million issue.

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures opened slightly lower
today on the Chicago Board of Trade.
   The market shows signs of firming in the wake the Agriculture
Department's supply and demand report. The report, released
Tuesday, is being viewed by traders as broadly neutral to slightly
supportive to futures.
   Adding to the firm tone of the market is anticipation that
President Bush today will announce U.S. food aid or export credits
to the Soviet Union, said Barney Janecki, an analyst with Dean
Witter Reynolds Inc. The president is meeting in Washington with
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze.
   Wheat futures may be boosted by a pickup in export activity, and
weakness in soyoil is expected to weigh on soybean prices.
   In early trading, wheat was a \ cent to 1 cent lower with the
contract for delivery in December at $2.53{ a bushel; corn was a {
cent lower to a \ cent higher with December at $2.26} a bushel;
oats were a { cent to } cent lower with March at $1.19} a bushel;
soybeans were 1 cent to 1} cents lower with January at $5.93\ a
bushel.
   Livestock and pork futures were mixed in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange. Strong demand for pork offset pressure
on future caused by lower cash prices for live hogs.
   Livestock futures received some support from high cash prices,
with gains limited by profit-taking.
   Live cattle were unchanged to .15 cent higher with December at
80.87 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent lower to .05 cent
higher with January at 88.70 cents a pound; live hogs were .05 cent
lower to .10 cent higher with December at 49.80 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .70 cent lower to .65 cent higher with
February at 66.30 cents a pound.
   Livestock and pork futures settled mixed in Tuesday's trading.

<BYLINE>Attorneys General of Six States Sue Large Mortgage Lender
^By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Attorneys general in six states have filed suit against the GMAC
Mortgage Corp., accusing the lender of overcharging consumers by
millions of dollars in excessive escrow payments.
   The action seeks to bar the Detroit-based lender from building
big cushions into escrow accounts and to force GMAC to recalculate
the way it determines escrow payments. GMAC holds about 400,000
mortgages nationwide.
   Attorneys general from California, Iowa, Massachusetts,
Minnesota, New York and Texas filed suit Tuesday in federal court
in Manhattan.
   The six states acted because the federal government has not
enforced its own laws against the practice, New York State Attorney
General Robert Abrams said.
   Abrams said that if the suit succeeds, homeowners could receive
millions of dollars in refunds.
   Officials from GMAC Corp. declined immediately to comment on the
suit.
   In April, the attorneys general released a study critical of
mortgage lenders' practice of requiring excess funds in escrow
accounts.
   ``When we released the report of the illegal escrow practices of
GMAC and other lenders, we urged the federal government to enforce
its own statutory limits on escrow payments. So far, it has taken
no action, thus prompting suits like (this one) at great cost to
the states,'' Abrams said.
   That study said consumers were being overcharged $2 billion to
$4 billion by the nation's mortgage lenders.
   Lenders maintain escrow accounts to make payments for propertyttaxes,
insurance and other items that borrowers must pay. Extra
money in escrow accounts hurts consumers but is a bonanza for
lenders, who regulators say get to use the funds for free or by
paying a very low rate of interest on it.
   About two-thirds of the nation's home mortgages involve escrow
accounts.
   Federal law limits lenders to keeping a two-month ``cushion'' in
escrow, or enough money to make payments for two months. The
cushion allows lenders to make tax and insurance payments even if
the consumer is late making a monthly payment.
   ``Our report estimated that the `excess cushion' averages about
$150 per homeowner,'' Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller said. ``That
means we think lenders are holding several billion dollars that
should be in the hands of their customers.''
   The report called on Housing and Urban Development Secretary
Jack Kemp to tighten enforcement of the law. The attorneys general
said inaction by HUD led them to file the suit.
   The two-year study focused on big lenders who operate
nationwide. A survey of four of the largest - Citibank, GMAC
Mortgage Corp., Fleet Mortgage Corp. and Lomas Financial Group. -
``indicated that lenders may be holding excessive and illegal
cushions in more than 70 percent of escrow accounts.''

   A former executive of Bolar Phamaraceutical
Co. pleaded guilty today to making false statements and obstructing
a Food and Drug Administration inquiry in order to help her company
get approval for a generic drug.
   Gloria H. Schetlick, former manager of regulatory affairs for
the company, entered the guilty plea to making a false statement
and obstruction of justice before a federal judge in Baltimore, the
Justice Department said.
   Prosecutors said Schetlick and other company officials submitted
false scientific data to the FDA in 1984 and 1985 to support
Bolar's application to produce a generic version of the
hypertension drug ``Dyazide.''
   The Justice Department said it had information that Schetlick
and other Bolar executives also tried to obstruct inquiries by the
House Energy and Comerce oversight and investigations subcommittee.
   The guilty plea was part of a continuing investigation into
corruption of the FDA's procedures for approving applications for
new drugs or generic equivalents.
   U.S. Attorney Breckinridge L. Willcox said in a statement that
the investigation was continuing and more charges were expected.
Schetlick, who could be sentenced to up to five years and fined
$250,000 on each count, has agred to cooperate with the
investigation, officials said.
   So far 16 people, including five former FDA officials, and three
generic drug companies have pleaded guilty in the investigation.
   Bolar, based in Copiague, N.Y., posted sales of $140 million for
its generic equivalent of the hypertension drug between 1987 and
1990.

   American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. and MCI
Communications Corp. said today they had reached an out-of-court
settlement on lawsuits and countersuits that had alleged theft of
customers and false advertising.
   Terms of the settlement were not disclosed.
   As part of the agreement, the two companies agreed to propose
adoption by the Federal Communications Commission of industrywide
standards to protect consumers from being switched to other
long-distance companies against their will.
   The proposed standards would permit long-distance carriers to
switch a customer's service only by one of the following means:
   -A customer-initiated call to an 800 number of the carrier to
which the customer is switching.
   -Independent third-party confirmation.
   -Signed letter of authorization.
   -A call placed by the customer to their local or long-distance
telephone company.
   The two companies, along with US Sprint, have been locked in a
fierce battle for customers. AT&amp;T and MCI, or their agents, have
been placing calls to millions of phone users each month trying to
get them to switch their long-distance service.
   State and federal authorities and local phone companies have
received tens of thousands of complaints about unauthorized
switching.
   Since the breakup of the old Bell System in 1984, AT&amp;T's share
of the long-distance market has eroded to below 70 percent. MCI,
the nation's second largest long-distance carrier, now has about 15
percent of the market.
   AT&amp;T, which had claimed it was losing customers because of
unauthorized switching by MCI and its telemarketing agent, had
asked the FCC to require a customer's written authorization before
a change could be made.
   MCI spokeswoman Pam Small said officials were bound by the
agreement not to comment further on the settlement.
   AT&amp;T spokesman Herb Linnen said the company wanted to ``get
beyond'' the ``squabbling,'' which he said ``is really not good for
either AT&amp;T or MCI, or for the customer.'' But he emphasized that
AT&amp;T ``will continue to pursue customers and try to retain existing
ones with the same resourcefulness and aggressiveness we have
pursued in the past.''
   MCI had sued AT&amp;T in U.S. District Court in Washington on Oct.
10, 1989, alleging false and deceptive advertising practices. AT&amp;T
countersued on Oct. 26.
   On Jan. 10 this year, AT&amp;T sued MCI and its telemarketing agent
in Newark, N.J., federal court, alleging false and deceptive
telemarketing practices.
   Both sides denied any wrongdoing and no dollar amounts were
specified in the suits.

   The prescription drug industry today defended
itself against accusations that it is driving up drug prices by
squandering millions of dollars on lavish and unnecessary gifts and
trips for doctors.
   Drug companies' representatives are a crucial link to physicians
and their practice of offering symposia and conferences provide
important information to physicians, the head of the Pharmaceutical
Manufacturers' Association told the Senate Labor and Human
Resources Committee.
   ``To develop the knowledge necessary, medical practitioners must
have prompt, reliable and detailed information regarding products
and the diseases they treat,'' Gerald Mossinghoff said.
   ``The entity in the best position to provide in-depth
information is the company that develops the new drug,'' he said.
   Mossinghoff also defended the use of gifts of ``nominal value''
which he said help remind physicians of the name of a particular
product.
   Dr. Daniel Johnson, a Louisiana radiologist and an American
Medical Association official, told the panel that while some
questionable promotional practices still exist in the drug
industry, physicians have taken steps to identify unethical
behavior and steer clear of it.
   Both the AMA and the pharmaceutical manufacturers last week
adopted ethical guidelines on the issue, he said.
   Asked specifically about expense-paid conferences for
physicians, Johnson said, ``there should be no accepting of money
directly or indirectly'' by physicians.
   But witnesses who testified before the panel Tuesday cited
example after example of drug companies offering everything from
frequent-flyer miles to outright cash to physicians in exchange for
prescribing a company's product.
   ``Drug companies have institutionalized deception,'' said David
C. Jones, a former public relations official for Ciba-Geigy Corp.
and Abbott Laboratories.
   ``The price of prescription drugs is determined by what the
market will bear,'' he said. ``Pain, suffering and desperation will
support a high price.''
   Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., the committee chairman, said his
staff had determined that the pharmaceutical industry spends more
than $5 billion a year on promoting drug products in the United
States.
   Much of the spending is legitimate, but some is not and is
contributing to the rise in drug prices that has outpaced
inflation, he said.
   Companies spent $85 million in 1988 on symposiums often held in
plush resorts, with expenses paid for both physician and spouse,
Kennedy said. In some cases, physician are paid honoraria for
attending.
   ``Doctors who accept lavish industry gifts are jeopardizing
their objectivity and compromising the trust of their patients,''
Kennedy said.
   Four drug companies were asked by Kennedy to testify, but all
four - Ciba-Geigy, Abbott Laboratories, Hoffman-LaRoche and
Wyeth-Ayerst - declined.
   A spokesperson for Ciba-Geigy said the company declined to
testify unless two other companies also agreed. At Senate hearings
in 1973, the company was the only one to testify and ``ended up
getting blamed for the sins of the industry.''
   Abbott Laboratories said it declined because it has complied
with Kennedy's request for written background material on the
company's educational and promotional practices, said spokesman Jed
Weiner.
   Hoffman-LaRoche spokeswoman Nancy Mattison said her company
declined because it was unable to get specific enough information
about the questions the senators would be asking.
   Wyeth-Ayerst spokeswoman Audrey Ashby said the company had
already provided the committee ``fully and promptly'' all the
information that was requested.

<HEAD>Shareholders of Wall Street Firm Approve Restructuring</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   CS First Boston Inc. said Wednesday its
institutional and management shareholders had approved a $725
million restructuring designed to reverse the investment firm's
sagging fortunes.
   The plan calls for the sale of $300 million in equity by CS
First Boston to its Swiss owner, CS Holding, and the injection of
$425 million in cash in exchange for the bulk of a troubled loan
portfolio.
   After the restructuring, CS Holding will control about 60
percent of the privately controlled investment bank, up from 44.5
percent. First Boston Corp. is the North American subsidiary of CS
First Boston.
   In a statement, CS First Boston said the loan portion of the
deal is expected to be completed on Friday with the rest of the
restructuring done by Monday.
   ``The depth of our commitment to CS First Boston is clear and
the strength of our investment banking affiliate is beyond
question,'' said CS Holding Chairman Rainer Gut.
   First Boston, though, has undergone a major shakeup in recent
weeks to clean up its balance sheet and cut costs during a severe
downturn in business on Wall Street. The firm has been hurt largely
by troubles in the junk bond, merger and real estate markets.
   As part of its overhaul, several top First Boston executives
have resigned or been ousted in the last six weeks and the firm has
been laying off about 200 employees in the last two months of the
year.
   The company said all of CS First Boston's institutional
shareholders and 94 percent of its management shareholders approved
the restructuring.
   The bailout by CS Holding, which owns the the Swiss bank Credit
Suisse, is the second this year by the parent of an ailing Wall
Street subsidiary. American Express Co. early this year injected
$1.3 billion into Shearson Lehman Holdings Inc. and took the
company private.
   The First Boston restructuring rids the firm of the majority of
$1.1 billion in temporary ``bridge loans'' made to corporate
clients that the firm has been unable to sell because of the
collapse of the junk bond market.
   Under the restructuring, CS First Boston is placing all its
bridge loans, except for those to Campeau Corp.'s Federated
Department Stores subsidiary and to Jerrico Inc., into a special
limited partnership.
   In exchange, CS First Boston will receive a stake in the
partnership and the $425 million in cash. The firm still will be
exposed to $377 million in bridge loans.
   Additionally, CS First Boston is writing off $360 million in
soured investments. That is expected to reduce the firm's 1990
earnings. First Boston made just $11 million last year and
reportedly has losses so far this year.

   The official November job report was one of the
bleakest in many years, further documenting the process by which
elements of a sliding economy reinforce each other and lead to
recession.
   Depicted graphically, it would look like a Rube Goldberg
contraption in which one action generates another and another and
another, the end result being nothing produced but a waste of time,
energy and capital.
   In terms of a sliding economy, you might begin with big debts
and tight money, which lead to lower consumer and business
spending, which produces lower profits, income strains and layoffs,
forcing further spending cuts.
   Viewed in that sense, the consequences of the terrible November
job report become clear: Fewer workers working fewer hours means
less money for retailers, who cut their orders to wholesalers and
wholesalers, who cut jobs and spending.
   There was almost no good news in the report, delivered by Janet
Norwood, commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
   In her own words:
   -Employment declined sharply, and the declines were widespread
throughout both the goods and the service sectors of the economy.
   -The unemployment rate rose from 5.7 percent to 5.9 percent. The
rate is now more than 0.5 percent higher than it was in the first
half of the year.
   -The number of payroll jobs declined sharply for the second
month in a row. A reduction of 265,000 jobs in November followed a
loss of 180,000 in October. We have not had consecutive job losses
of this magnitude since the end of 1982.
   -Three-quarers of the November reduction occurred in the
already weak manufacturing industry. Nearly 800,000 factory jobs
have been dropped since January 1989.
   Even service-sector jobs were affected. Jobs in retail trades
fell by 70,000. Wholesale trade employment fell sharply. And, as
has been well publicized, big losses occurred in the real estate
and finance industries.
   The one piece of news that might be construed as positive really
wasn't. Employment in the health services industry rose by 80,000
jobs, bringing to more than 600,000 the number of jobs added in
that category within a year.
   Why isn't that good news? For those who found employment it was,
of course, good news, but for the rest of us it was ominous. Health
service spending has been out of control for years. Each year it
consumes more of the gross national product. Each year its
inflation rate exceeds that of the general economy.
   How can the deterioration be changed? In the old days you primed
the pump with government spending, but government already is
spending too much. Because of that, an unusually large role falls
to the Federal Reserve.
   The Fed can do its part in a number of ways, such as easing
credit restraints, putting more money into the economy and allowing
interest rates to fall.
   So far, it hasn't done a great deal in that respect. In the
past, Chairman Alan Greenspan has espoused a goal of zero
inflation, and inflation for the current quarter might be 6 percent
- not terribly bad, but not zero.
   Greenspan is one of the most dedicated anti-inflationists ever
to sit as Fed chairman. He has sound reasons for fearing it,
considering the amount of debt already existing, the dollar's value
and the fragile financial system.
   But that November jobless report - not just the increases in
joblessness but the speeding up of the process - might force him to
forgo the pursuit of zero inflation and get more Americans back to
work.

   The U.S. dollar finished mixed against other major
currencies in thin European trading today.
   Gold prices also were mixed.
   Traders said the session was dominated by technical factors and
a general caution ahead of Thursday's scheduled meeting of the
German Bundesbank's policy-making council.
   Dealers said volume was particularly thin in what they
characterized as typical ``year-end'' trading. ``This ... should
continue more or less into January unless we get some big news
developments,'' one dealer said.
   In Tokyo, the dollar fell to a closing 131.88 Japanese yen from
131.75 yen at Tuesday's close. Later in London, it was quoted lower
at 131.75 yen. At midday in New York the dollar was trading at
131.74 yen.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.9435 from $1.9400 late
Tuesday. In New York it cost $1.9468 to buy one pound.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday's
rates included: 1.4788 German marks, down from 1.4790; 1.2650 Swiss
francs, down from 1.2665; 5.0240 French francs, up from 5.0230;
1.6675 Dutch guilders, down from 1.6683; 1,113.25 Italian lire, up
from 1,110.07, and 1.1599 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1591.
   Selected midday dollar rates in New York included: 1.4760 German
marks, 1.2630 Swiss francs, 1,112.75 Italian lire and 1.1606
Canadian dollars.
   Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $371.75 a troy ounce
from $370.75 bid late Tuesday. In Zurich, the metal fell to a
closing bid of $371.60 from $371.85.
   Earlier in Hong Kong, gold fell $2.74 to close at a bid $372.62.
   Silver bullion fell in London to a late bid price of $4.03 a

   CBS Inc. today announced an offer to buy back $2
billion of its own stock and disclosed that it lost $55 million
from its coverage of major league baseball this year.
   The company also said its board has unanimously elected the
company president and chief executive, Laurence A. Tisch, for the
additional post of chairman, succeeding William S. Paley who died
on Oct. 26.
   The company said it would repurchase up to 10.5 million shares
of its common stock at $190 per share, a significant premium over
recent prices.
   CBS stock has been hit hard recently by the network's disclosure
that it would report a loss for the fourth quarter and lower
earnings in 1991. The loss would be its first for any quarter
excluding a restated loss in the fourth quarter of 1986. CBS has
been hit hard by losses on sports programming and weakening ad
revenue.
   As part of the buyback, CBS said the Paley estate, which
controls an 8 percent stake, and Loews Corp., the Tisch-controlled
company that holds a 24.9 percent interest in CBS, would tender
their shares.
   A portion of their stakes would be repurchased, but their
relative holdings of CBS common stock would not change. The estate
has been negotiating with CBS to sell the shares to pay tax
obligations.
   The announcement boosted the price of CBS stock, which was up
$4.25 a share to $174.12{ in midday trading on the New York Stock
Exchange. The stock recently traded below $160 a share.
   ``This offer will provide CBS shareholders with the opportunity
to receive a premium over recent market prices of CBS shares for a
significant portion of their shares while retaining a substantial
equity investment in the company,'' Tisch said in a statement.
   Tisch said that after the buyback CBS still will have $800
million in cash and securities to finance currnt operations.
   The statement also said that ``in light of the repurchase of
shares and the outlook for 1991'' CBS expected to reduce its common
stock quarterly dividend below the currrent $1.10 a share.
   CBS for the first time disclosed an after-tax operating loss of
$55 million for the 1990 fourth quarter and the year from its
expensive contract for baseball programming. The network was hurt
by weak advertising and the Cincinnati Reds four-game sweep over
the Oakland Athletics.
   CBS also said it would take a $115 million charge against
fourth-quarter earnings to pay for anticipated losses over the
course of its four-year, $1.06 billion major league baseball
contract.
   CBS last month announced that it would lose money for the
October-December quarter. Estimates on its baseball losses for 1990
had been reported at under $100 million. The network earned $60.1
million, or $2.33 a share, in the same 1989 period.
   Other factors cited by the network for the losses included lower
advertising revenue because of the economic downturn, increased
news costs covering the Middle East crisis and reduced demand for
advertising at its television and radio stations.
   The company last month also announced that it would cut payments
to television network affiliates next year for carrying its
programs by 20 percent, a move expected to save the company about
$30 million in 1991. CBS also has laid off workers to cut costs.
   CBS said the stock buyback offer would begin in the next several
days and expire on Jan. 21. If the offer is fully subscribed, CBS
would buy back an equal percentage of the amount tendered by all
stockholders.

<TEXT>
   Great Western Financial Corp. bowed
out of the stagnant real estate brokerage business Wednesday,
saying it would close its Great Western Real Estate subsidiary.
   The shutdown, combined with layoffs announced last month at the
real estate company, puts 1,506 people out of work - 241 staff
members and 1,265 real estate agents who had contracted to work for
Great Western full time.
   Little effect was expected on the parent compny's financial
statement, according to Great Western Financial, whose biggest
subsidiary is Great Western Bank, the nation's second-largest
savings and loan.
   The real estate company was a tiny fragment of Great Western's
business. The Beverly Hills-based parent company had $3.8 billion
in revenues in 1989; the Yorba Linda-based realty subsidiary had
just $50 million in gross sales commissions.
   There has been a host of recent layoffs and cutbacks at real
estate companies throughout California, where the market has slowed
drastically in the past year after several years of booming sales
and soaring prices.
   No attempt was made to find a buyer for the Great Western real
estate unit, spokesman Steve Hawkins said. He said employees of
some field offices had inquired about taking over those offices.
   In November, Great Western Real Estate laid off its new-home
sales force in Yorba Linda.
   Great Western Financial is generally regarded as healthy but has
had big losses recently on commercial real estate loans in the
Northeast.
   Great Western said the real estate unit never consistently met
profit objectives since it was acquired in 1983. Hawkins described
the closure as part of Great Western's attempts to refocus on its
core businesses of mortgage lending and retail banking.
   Hawkins said the company would complete all transactions in
escrow before shutting down so that customers would not be
affected.

<HEAD>`Likeable' Harris Brings New Leadership to Beleagured Continental</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSAN FAHLGREN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hollis Harris built a reputation in the airline
industry as an easygoing executive with an optimistic, cheerleading
management style.
   When he left Delta Air Lines Inc. in August after 36 years,
Harris seemed to be just what Continental Airlines Inc. needed -
someone with the financial savvy to keep the carrier afloat and an
exuberant personality to encourage dispirited employees.
   ``It may sound a little corny, but I say, `Continental team,
let's go get them!''' he told employees when he was introduced as
chairman-elect.
   But Harris will have to use all those spirited traits - and more
- if he's to see Continental through Chapter 11 federal bankruptcy
proceedings.
   The nation's fifth-largest carrier filed for protection from
creditors earlier this month, citing soaring fuel costs and
mounting interest payments on its $6.2 billion debt. It was
Continental's second bankrutpcy filing.
   Harris' predecessor, Frank Lorenzo, built Continental through a
series of mergers and acquisitions over nearly two decades. But he
incurred the wrath of union workers during the first reorganization
in 1983 when he insinuated greedy unions were hurting the company.
   Harris has painstakenly tried to avoid such confrontations.
   ``Our 37,000 employees have earned a reputation for working hard
and smart while providing American travelers with the services they
need,'' he remarked, following the company's bankruptcy filing
announcement.
   Harris, still commuting from his home in Georgia, was
unavailable for an interview, Continental officials said.
   Harris has said he sees his role as part of a leadership
continuum for the company and believes his job is to make the
airline run more smoothly. Lorenzo's role, he said, was building
the airline.
   ``In the '80s, people were concentrating more on growing. Now
the focus is on competing with service,'' he said.
   In four months, the 58-year-old Harris has endeared himself to
his employees.
   ``Mr. Harris is a very positive, people-oriented person which is
something we haven't known a lot of around Continental for
awhile,'' said pilot Robert Finley. ``It seems like a breath of
fresh air to see a man like him in that job.
   ``If anyone can pull us through these difficult times - where
fuel costs are skyrocketing and all costs are elevating at an
enormous rate while the fares are still being depressed and the
fare wars are going on - I think Mr. Harris is the guy who can do
it.''
   Friends and associates had equally kind words.
   ``He's a very likeable person. I can't remember anybody saying
anything unkind about him,'' said Clara Bailey, who graduated high
school with Harris in 1949 in Carrollton, Ga., about 55 miles west
of Atlanta.
   Ms. Bailey, who keeps in touch with Harris and his wife, fellow
Carrollton native Joyce Harris, said the Continental leader has
always been a private person who cared about others.
   The son of the Rev. C.L. Harris, a retired Methodist minister,
Harris excelled in school. But Ms. Bailey said he never flaunted
his achievements.
   ``He was one of the most intelligent people in the class, but he
was also the most unassuming,'' she said.
   Harris holds a bachelor of aeronautical engineering degree from
the Georgia Institute of Technology. The father of two sons and a
daughter, he gained a reputation in Atlanta for his involvement in
several community projects including the Boy Scouts of America.
   Harris was instrumental in setting up a fund-raising system for
the council that provided about $200,000 for the group last year
alone.
   Harris remains active in other civic activities. He serves on
the advisory council of the National Multiple Sclerosis Society and
was past chairman of the American Institute of Aeronautics and
Astronautics, among others.
   Harris joined Delta in 1954 as a transportation agent in the
marketing division and later became an aircraft engineer,
eventually rising to head of that department. He subsequently
served in key management roles in the facilities department,
inflight service, passenger service and operations.
   Harris was named president of Delta in 1987 and was responsible
for all marketing, operations, technical operations and personnel
functions.
   ``He was very much liked here,'' said one former employee, who
asked not to be named. ``And his hometown and Georgia were very
proud of him. I'm sure Houston and Texas will be, as well.''

   Grain and soybean futures closed mostly higher
Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade in anticipation of the
granting of export credits to the Soviet Union.
   The market opened lower in reaction to the release Tuesday of
the U.S. Agriculture Department's supply and demand report, said
Gerald Zusel, an analyst with E.D.&amp;F. Man International Futures
Inc.
   The market rallied later in the morning after Sen. Bob Dole,
R-Kan., said immediate action was needed to extend $3 billion in
credits to the Soviet Union.
   Dole's request was considered bullish because the market has
been speculating the export initiative would be around $1.5
billion.
   ``We mainly had a lot of speculative buying in anticipation the
government will announce a big credit package,'' Zusel said.
   At the close, wheat was 1{ cents lower to a { cent higher with

   How merry Christmas 1990 will be depends on
economic and geographic basics - what you do for a living and where
you do it. But it also depends on some intangibles, like luck,
timing and creativity. The following vignettes, reported by AP
writers Jonathan Yenkin in Boston, Steven P. Rosenfeld in Des
Moines, Gry Eriksen in Los Angeles, Marc Rice in Atlanta and Joyce
M. Rosenberg in New York, look at the holiday season from a variety
of vantage points.

   Homer's jewelry store sits in the heart of Boston's downtown
shopping district, and like the holiday seasons of years past, the
aisles are crammed with people who peer into glass cases and try on
gold bracelets.
   But this scene does not sparkle like it normally would for store
manager Donald Cohen.
   After 108 years in business, Homer's is holding one last sale
before closing its doors, becoming another casualty of hard times
in New England.
   ``This is the only place I ever worked,'' said Cohen, 55, who
first came to the shop as an errand boy in 1950. ``It's going to be
quite different after 40 years getting up each day and coming to
work here.''
   Homer's is a virtual landmark in Boston, but its fate is not so
unique. The Massachusetts economy, sinking into recession for more
than a year, has forced thousands of people out of work.
   That gave may retailers a dim outlook for this Christmas
season. Jewelers find it is difficult to sell gold and diamonds to
people keeping a close eye on their wallets.
   ``We have so many people coming in, talking about relatives
losing their jobs,'' said Cohen. ``It's more important that they
have food on their table.''
   With business declining, Homer's owners decided to close down
now rather than watch the shop sink further.

   For Iowa farm wife Debbie Hardersen, spending $60 on a blouse
and skirt is unusually extravagant.
   But the clothes were on sale and times are good - if not great -
for farmers. So she bought the outfit for herself on a shopping
spree recently during the Iowa Farm Bureau convention.
   ``I didn't feel too badly buying it,'' Hardersen said.
   ``I've spent $350 here and I'm not done yet,'' she said.
``Christmas is a time I do like to splurge.''
   There's no scrimping or pinching pennies this year.
   Iowa manufacturers such as Winnebago Industries Inc. and Deere &amp;
Co. may be laying off workers this fall as sales slump, but the
farm economy is on the mend from the freefall of the 1980s.
   Hardersen, 36, went to the convention with her husband, Don, 41.
Their two children stayed at their home outside the eastern Iowa
community of Anamosa, where the couple farms 600 acres and raises
hogs and cattle.
   Cattle prices were at all-time highs during convention week and
hog prices remained comfortably above the break-even point. While
corn and soybean prices have been slumping, the crop was good and
cheap feed grains reduce the expense of raising livestock.
   ``Overall, the mood out in the country is much more
optimistic,'' Debbie Hardersen says.

   The economy is weak, it's a dismal holiday season for retailers,
and Bob and Susan Rabascho braved three hours on the freeway from
San Diego just to go to a discount home furnishing store in
Burbank, Calif.
   They had to wait another hour to get inside the Ikea store, but
they didn't care. Nor have other shoppers who have mobbed the
110-room store since it opened last month.
   The Sweden-based Ikea is a rare Southern California retailing
success story at a time when sagging real estate prices and layoffs
in aerospace and construction have put the brakes on spending.
   So many people have gone there that Burbank police have assigned
29 officers to handle the traffic jams that followed the store's $3
million advertising campaign.
   Things got so bad that cars on the Burbank Boulevard off-ramp
backed up on the Golden State Freeway. Police finally implored the
state Transportation Department to put a sign on the freeway
directing drivers to another exit.
   After the Rabaschos finally made it inside, they spent six hours
and about $200 at Ikea. The store features assemble-it-yourself
furniture and offers amenities such as supervised childcare and
free diapers to keep families happy while they shop.

   Every year artisans from all over the Northeast flock to the
annual holiday crafts fair at Columbia University in New York to
sell their pottery, jewelry, quilts and clothing. But this year,
the market for crafts - like that for goods sold by more
traditional retailers - is in a slump.
   Cherry Schacher has been selling patchwork goods at the fair for
10 years, but this year, she sold more placemats and pillows than
$500 quilts.
   ``It is off a bit,'' she said of her sales. But after having had
a slow year, Ms. Schacher came into Manhattan expecting business to
be down from the robust sales she enjoyed at past fairs.
   Like many artisans, Ms. Schacher depends on her handiwork for a
large portion of her income. However, she and her husband, who live
in upstate Ballston Spa, N.Y., also make their living by playing in
a country band several nights a week. The music business helps make
up for a drop in crafts sales.
   Alan Goldfarb, a glassblower from Burlington, Vt., also expected
his business to be down at the fair, but he was pleasantly
surprised.
   Goldfarb's goblets and glass fish range from $12.50 to $350 in
price, and he came prepared with more lower-priced than higher-end
pieces. Yet by the end of his three days at the fair, Goldfarb had
his highest sales total ever for the New York show.
   He also found that the new works he displayed sold very well.
   ``We were taking a chance ...'' he said. ``But if you follow
your heart, it works.''

   Instead of buying Christmas gifts for his family, David Ryan has
been shopping for something else lately: a job.
   At 26, Ryan is among the young adults coping with unemployment
during the economic slump in Massachusetts. Ryan lost his job at a
Boston investment firm several months ago, and that means a holiday
season without glitter.
   ``My relatives have told me not to buy any gifts until after I
get back to work,'' Ryan said. ``It's a little hard for me. I would
like to give some gifts to express my feelings about what they do
for me during the year.''
   Ryan has had to budget his money tightly. He even is cutting
back on greeting cards.
   Unemployment officials say they have encountered many similar
tales this year. Mary Muir, director of the state employment and
training office in Woburn, Mass., said she sees more young
unemployed people these days.
   ``For many of these people, it's the first time they've been
unemployed,'' she said. ``It's a shock to them.''
   Ryan said initially he didn't think he would have much trouble
dealing with unemployment. But he has had to let some bills slide
and he receives help from his family.
   And with no luck so far in finding a new job, Ryan said he's had
trouble getting into the holiday spirit.

   This may be the season of austerity in gift-giving, but Thank
Your Lucky Stars is selling what some might consider a frivolity:
astrological gift certificates.
   The company, a career-oriented astrological firm based in
suburban Atlanta, is selling certificates for its services, which
range from a personalized astrological profile for $19.95 to a
business-friendship compatibility report for $29.95 to a full-scale
consultation for $80.
   Many retailers have reported consumers are looking for practical
gifts this season, like flannel shirts and sweaters, but Thank Your
Lucky Stars is confident there's a market for its services.
   ``Our astrological practice, if this is not an oxymoron, is a
very conservative astrological practice,'' said Sandy Keefe, a
partner in the firm.
   Ms. Keefe, who also runs a standard personnel firm out of the
same office, also offers star-guided suggestions for holiday gift
giving.
   But all people do not fare equally under Ms. Keefe's
astrological gift guide.
   For example, because a Leo yearns for appreciation and
recognition, it is suggested that season tickets to the theater or
gold jewelry would make a fine present.
   A Sagittarius, on the other hand, wants to find out more about
the world. An atlas is advised as an appropriate gift.
   It's enough to make someone lie about their birthday.

   The stock market jumped ahead to a three-month
high today, reviving its yearend rally.
   Over the past week the market has run into resistance from
sellers.
   But analysts noted that the pullback proved to be shallow,
suggesting that stocks were still benefiting from solid support not
far below their recent levels.
   Brokers also say many investors seem convinced that the Federal
Reserve will take whatever steps are necessary to cushion the
effects of the economic slump.
   With assistance from the Fed, many optimists in the financial
world believe, the economy could begin to show renewed signs of
vigor as early as mid-1991.

<HEAD>Delaware Judge Awards $110 Million to Former Shell Shareholders</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Delaware judge Wednesday awarded approximately
$110 million to about 1,000 former Shell Oil Co. stockholders who
relinquished 1 million shares in a merger deal five years ago.
   The shareholders, most of whom are present or former Shell
employees, were awarded $71.20 per share for their stock by Vice
Chancellor Maurice Hartnett III in Delaware.
   Houston-based Shell Oil Co. became a wholly owned subsidiary of
the giant Royal Dutch-Shell Group of Cos. on June 7, 1985,
completing a $5.7 billion merger.
   As part of the merger, the shareholders were given the option of
accepting $60 per share or seeking a court appraisal of stock
value, said Houston attorney Lee Godfrey, lead counsel for the
shareholders.
   The shareholders who received the $71.20 had sought the court
appraisal rather than the $60-per-share offer. The judge also
awarded interest to the shareholders on the $71.20 price at 10
percent interest from June 1985, increasing the amount to about
$110 per share.
   ``Our contention all along was that Shell's foreign-owned parent
paid far too little in the 1985 cash-out merger,'' said Lee
Godfrey, lead counsel for the 1,000 shareholders.
   Plaintiffs' attorneys maintained the fair value was $89 per
share, while experts for Shell said the value was $55 a share.
   Shell officials can appeal the decision issued Wednesday, but
company officials would not discuss their plans.
   ``We don't have a comment at this time. Our attorneys are still
studying the document,'' said Shell spokeswoman Eydie Pengelly.
   Last month, Hartnett awarded some 20,000 other former Shell
stockholders an additional $2 per share for 15 million shares
relinquished in the same merger deal. Those shareholders were given
$58 per share, plus $2 a share for giving up their right of
appraisals.
   That award followed a June 1990 court finding of disclosure
violations in materials Shell distributed to shareholders
describing their options in the buyout.
   Hartnett ruled last June that the material mailed to
shareholders failed ``to disclose the existence of oil and gas
reserves having a value of approximately $1 billion.''
   Plaintiffs' attorneys still are seeking interest on the
$2-per-share award and attorneys' fees.

<HEAD>Attorneys General File Suit Against Mortgage Lender</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government's inaction against mortgage lenders with
excessive amounts held in escrow forced legal action against the
GMAC Mortgage Corp., attorneys general in six states said
Wednesday.
   Attorneys general in Iowa, California, Massachusetts, Minnesota,
New York and Texas filed the suit Wednesday in U.S. District Court
for the Southern District of New York.
   GMAC Mortgage Corp. of Detroit and several of its subsidiaries
``routinely hold in these mortgage accounts more funds than either
federal law or the homeowners' mortgage contracts allow,'' the
lawsuit alleges.
   ``The suit would bar GMAC's illegal practice of requiring excess
money to be held in homeowners' mortgage escrow accounts,''
Massachusetts Attorney General James M. Shannon said in a statement
Wednesday.
   GMAC ``will take appropriate action'' to defend against the
allegations in the suit, said Rick Gillespie, a GMAC vice president
in Elkins Park, Pa.
   ``GMAC Mortgage Corp. is confident it has been and remains in
full compliance with federal and state laws and industry practices
and that these practices are fair to each consumer and our
company,'' Gillespie said. He said the corporation voluntarily gave
information to the attorneys general to aid their research. GMAC
has about 400,000 residential mortgages nationwide.
   Escrow accounts are kept by lending institutions to make
payments for property taxes, insurance and other items that
borrowers must pay. Extra money in escrow is a bonanza for lenders
because they can use the money for free or pay only a low rate of
interest on it.
   About two-thirds of the nation's home mortgages involve escrow
accounts.
   Federal law limits lenders to keeping a two-month ``cushion'' in
escrow, or enough money to make payments for two months. The
cushion allows lenders to make tax and insurance payments even if
the consumer is late making a monthly payment.
   In April, the attorneys general issued a report critical of the
practice of requiring excess money in the accounts. They asked
Housing and Urban Development Secretary Jack Kemp to tighten
enforcement of the escrow law.
   ``When we released the report of the illegal escrow practices of
GMAC and other lenders, we urged the federal government to enforce
its own statutory limits on escrow payments. So far, it has taken
no action, thus prompting suits like the one filed today, at great
cost to the states,'' New York Attorney General Robert Abrams said.
   ``Our report estimated that the `excess cushion' averages about
$150 per homeowner,'' Iowa Attorney General Thomas Miller said.
``That means we think lenders are holding several billion dollars
that should be in the hands of their customers.''
   The two-year study said consumers were being overcharged $2
billion to $4 billion by the nation's mortgage lenders.
   The study focused on big lenders who operate nationwide. A
survey of four of the largest - Citibank, GMAC Mortgage Corp.,
Fleet Mortgage Corp. and Lomas Financial Group - ``indicated that
lenders may be holding excessive and illegal cushions in more than
70 percent of escrow accounts.''
   Bob Brammer, an administrative assistant in the Iowa attorney
general's office, said inquiries still are being made into escrow
practices of the other lenders.
   ``We don't contemplate any lawsuits regarding them in the
immediate future,'' Brammer said.
   Massachusetts Assistant Attorney General Ernest Sarason, who
handled the suit for Shannon, said the states have been studying
the issue for more than two years.
   ``The reason that we filed the suit is that we were very
concerned about mortgage companies not complying with federal law
limiting the amount of mortgage escrow,'' Sarason said.

   OPEC will continue pumping oil at high
levels to offset crude losses caused by the Persian Gulf crisis,
officials said late Wednesday.
   Indonesian Oil Minister Ginandjar Kartasasmita said the 13
nations of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries would
sign a statement Thursday endorsing continued increased production.
   He said in an interview that they also would promise to reduce
their output to levels set in late July, once the gulf crisis has
ended.
   In August, after Iraq invaded Kuwait, the cartel temporarily
suspended its quota system to permit higher pumping by nations with
spare capacity.
   ``We will continue with the August agreement,'' Ginandjar said.
   ``We are reaffirming everything,'' said Gabonese Oil Minister
Jean Ping.
   The August accord was put together so that heavyweight Saudi
Arabia and other producing nations could make up for lost Iraqi and
Kuwaiti crude.
   About 4 million barrels of oil a day have been pulled from the
market because of international sanctions imposed after Iraq
invaded Kuwait Aug. 2.
   Ginandjar said that when the gulf troubles subside, the cartel
would reimpose the output caps in force in late July. Under that
accord, all 13 nations agreed to hold production to 22.5 million
barrels a day in an effort to reach a target of $21 dollars a
barrel.
   The cartel's current production is pegged at around 23 million
barrels a day. Saudi Arabia, the world's largest crude exporter, is
close to pumping 8.5 million barrels a day, sources have said. Its
quota under the July accord was 5.4 million barrels.
   Other members pumping above their previous levels are Venezuela,
Nigeria, the United Arab Emirates, Iran and Libya.
   The ministers, who agreed to meet again in early March, made
their decisions during five hours of formal and informal talks on
the opening day of their winter strategy session.
   It was the first time since the invasion that all 13
oil-producing representatives have been represented. Iraq and Libya
did not attend the meeting at which the cartel's quota system was
suspended.
   No sparks were reported between Iraq and Kuwait, seated next to
each other in the conference room's alphabetical arrangement.
   Ramzi Salman Abdul Hussain, director of Iraq's State Oil
Marketing Organization, said little. But he told reporters that
Iraq could increase its crude production to strong levels ``as soon
as we want.''
   ``None of the facilities are damaged,'' he said.
   Iraq is estimated to be producing a mere 400,000 barrels a day,
compared to earlier levels of more than 3 million barrels.
   Rasheed Salem al-Ameeri, the oil minister for Kuwait's
government-in-exile, also insisted his country could get its oil
industry back to former levels quickly with a peaceful resolution.
   He said Iraqi invaders ``have done extensive damage to our oil
industry. ... But we have plans to reconstruct it in a short
time.''
   Earlier in the day, OPEC President Sadek Boussena opened the
strategy session by criticizing oil-consuming nations for failing
to do much to ease the oil crunch.
   Instead of tapping crude in their inventories, he said, the rich
nations appeared to have added oil to their storage tanks in case
of a worsening of gulf troubles.
   As a result, he said, OPEC has been forced into ``extreme levels
of output.''
   ``This is clearly an ill-contrived move,'' Boussena, the
Algerian mines minister, told his counterparts.
   ``If such an escalation does not occur and - as we all hope - an
early, peaceful solution is found to the crisis, then the world
will be awash with oil,'' he said.
   He warned that OPEC would ``be faced with another decade of
turmoil'' like the roller-coaster 1980s.
   ``Nobody in our organization wants a repetition of that era of
rampant instability,'' said Boussena.
   The cartel has been in disarray since the gulf crisis. After the
invasion, ministers agreed to lift their production caps to offset
the loss of crude from Iraq and Kuwait.
   The result has been a flood of oil on the market and sharp
swings in prices.
   Prices for light sweet crude peaked in October at $41 a barrel.
They since have skidded to under $30 a barrel on hints of peace in
the Middle East and worries about an oil glut.
   The average price of a basket of crudes monitored by the cartel
was $26.25 a barrel Monday, well above its target price of $21 a
barrel set in July.
   OPEC members are: Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Indonesia, Iran,
Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates and Venezuela.

<HEAD>Grains, Soybeans Higher As Market Anticipates Credits to Soviets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HERBERT G. McCANN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures closed mostly higher Wednesday on the
Chicago Board of Trade in anticipation of the granting of export
credits to the Soviet Union.
   On other markets, silver plunged while gold gained, livestock
and pork futures were mixed and energy futures fell.
   Grain and soybean futures opened lower in reaction to the
release Tuesday of the U.S. Agriculture Department's supply and
demand report, said Gerald Zusel, an analyst with E.D.&amp;F. Man
International Futures Inc.
   The market rallied later in the morning after Sen. Bob Dole,
R-Kan., said immediate action was needed to extend $3 billion in
credits to the Soviet Union.
   Dole's request was considered bullish because the market has
been speculating the export initiative would be around $1.5
billion.
   ``We mainly had a lot of speculative buying in anticipation the
government will announce a big credit package,'' Zusel said.
   After the close of trading, President Bush announced a waiver of
trade restrictions on the Soviet Union and granted credit
guarantees.
   Secretary of State James Baker said the amount of credits would
be between $500 million and $1 billion, significantly less than
what Dole asked for and what a U.S. Agriculture Department official
last week told Congress could be made available.
   Wheat settled 1 cent lower to { cent higher with the contract
for delivery in December at $2.55 a bushel; corn was \ cent lower
to 1 cent higher with December at $2.27 a bushel; oats were } cent
to 1\ cents lower with December at $1.10 a bushel; soybeans were 1\
cents to 2} cents higher with January at $5.96} a bushel.
   Silver prices fell on the New York's Commodity Exchange amid
fund and technical selling.
   Willian O'Neill, an analyst with Merrill Lynch Futures Inc.,
said silver is following a trend downward that was established at
the beginning of the year.
   ``Silver is functioning as an industrial metal rather than as a
precious metal,'' O'Neill said. ``That places silver in a weak
position. Investment demand is sluggish to non-existent. And with
the economy not expected to do well into next year, the industrial
side does not look all that positive, either.''
   Gold prices gained during Wednesday's trading.
   Gold benefited from continued uncertainty in the Persian Gulf
and the failure of the United States and Iraq to agree on a date
for a meeting of their diplomats, O'Neill said.
   Gold was 70 cents to $1.80 higher with February at $373.50 a
troy ounce; silver was 4.1 cents to 4.9 cents lower with December
at $4.026 a troy ounce.
   Energy futures were lower on the New York Mercantile Exchange,
with the weakness in the heating oil market the main feature of
trading.
   ``The market has become aware that there is too much heating oil
out there,'' said Jim Ritterbusch, an analyst with PaineWebber Inc.
in Chicago. ``We are not having the kind of December we had last
year. Temperatures are warmer than normal and they are expected
remain that way (for a time).''
   The energy market tended to shrug off the meeting in Vienna of
13 ministers of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries,
Ritterbusch said. The ministers decided late Wednesday to continue
current levels of crude output.
   Light sweet crude was $1.01 to $1.22 lower with January at
$25.35 a barrel; heating oil was 2.36 cents to 3.11 cents lower
with January at 74.63 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 2.23
cents to 2.30 cents lower with January at 64.49 cents a gallon;
natural gas was .08 cent lower to .005 cent higher with January at
$2.204 per thousand cubic feet.
   Livestock and pork futures were mixed on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange.
   Live cattle were .33 cent lower to .13 cent higher with December
at 88.85 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent lower to .30
cent higher with January at 88.72 cents a pound; live hogs were
unchanged to .25 cent higher with December at 49.85 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .35 cent lower to .27 cent higher with
February at 66.92 cents a pound.

   The stock market pushed ahead to a three-month
high Wednesday, reviving its yearend rally.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 36.14 points to
2,622.28, its highest close since it stood at 2,625.74 on Sept. 12.
   Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 3 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
952 up, 594 down and 507 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 182.27 million
shares, up from 145.33 million in the previous session. Nationwide,
consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in
those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter
market, totaled 219.28 million shares.
   Over the past week the market has run into resistance from
sellers. From last Wednesday through Tuesday's close, the Dow Jones
industrial average dropped 24.26 points.
   But analysts noted that the pullback proved to be shallow,
suggesting that stocks were still benefiting from solid support not

   Traders were also looking ahead to some expected favorable news
on inflation Friday, when the government issues its monthly report
on the producer price index of finished goods.
   If advance estimates are accurate, the index will show an
increase of just 0.1 percent for November after rising more than 1
percent in each of the three preceding months.
   Hilton Hotels, discussed as a possible takeover target, jumped

   Trying to rediscover a recipe for success, Digital
Equipment Corp. has shuffled some of its top executives while the
computer maker tries to cut costs by about $1 billion.
   Also looming on the horizon are possible layoffs, which would be
the first in Digital's 33-year history.
   For months, Digital has been seeking ways to cut costs to cope
with a slump in computer sales. Mark Steinkrauss, director of
investor relations for the Maynard-based company, said Digital is
trying to reduce its expenses by about $1 billion, though the
figure is only a rough target.
   ``In this economic environment, one has to assume a low level of
profitability,'' Steinkrauss said Wednesday.
   The cost-cutting steps have included slashing the payroll
through voluntary means and consolidating operations.
   Digital, which employs about 123,500 people worldwide and had
revenues of $12.9 billion in its last fiscal year, is trying to
eliminate 5,000 to 6,000 employees this fiscal year.
   So far, the world's second-largest computer maker has avoided
layoffs by using a voluntary severance program.
   Nikki Richardson, a Digital spokeswoman, said Wednesday about
600 people have left the company under the recent severance
program, which is set to expire Dec. 31. She said many employees
will wait until the last minute to make a decision whether to take
the severance package.
   Digital's stock rose $2.37{ a share Wednesday to close at $57 in
New York Stock Exchange trading.
   ``The work force reduction program is going slowly,'' said Barry
Willman, an analyst at the New York investment firm Sanford C.
Bernstein &amp; Co.
   Digital likely will make a decision in January whether to extend
the severance program or take the more forceful step of layoffs,
Richardson said.
   ``We will look at it in conjunction with the business climate,''
she said, adding that layoffs ``may be a possibility.''
   Digital President Kenneth Olsen has refused to rule out layoffs.
   Digital posted its first-ever quarterly loss earlier this year,
and its earnings for the quarter ended Sept. 30 plunged 83 percent,
while revenues dipped 1 percent.
   In the wake of these results, Digital has decided to restructure
part of its senior management.
   David Grainger, who was vice president of Digital's U.S. sales
and service organization, will now head a newly created group
overseeing the company's worldwide network of distributors and
resellers, who tailor products to individual customers.
   Digital ``may have let some opportunities slip by'' in this
area, Steinkrauss said, adding that the company will look at new
ways to distribute its products.
   Donald P. Zereski, formerly vice president for customer service,
is taking over responsibility for Digital's U.S. business, under a
structure that will reduce bureaucracy in sales, Steinkrauss said.
   Russell A. Gullotti, who headed Digital's corporate consulting
services, will also assume customer service duties.
   In another recent switch, Bill Hanson, who oversaw manufacturing
operations, assumed worldwide responsibility for the flow of
materials and other asset management. Robert Palmer, who headed
semiconductor operations, became vice president of manufacturing.
   Cliff Friedman, an analyst with Bear Stearns &amp; Co., said these
management moves signal another change at Digital, where John
Smith, the senior vice president for operations, is gaining more
authority to make the necessary steps.
   Smith appears to be taking over more day-to-day responsibility
for running Digital from Olsen, who co-founded the computer maker,
analysts say.
   Like other computer companies, Digital has suffered from an
industrywide downturn in sales in recent years. Digital also has
seen sales slip in its minicomputer line, its mainstay products, as
customers switch to increasingly powerful personal computers for
some uses, analysts say.

<HEAD>New York Could Get Second Oil Futures Market</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DIRK BEVERIDGE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Is this town big enough for two oil futures
markets?
   Now that the Persian Gulf crisis has made crude oil a hot
commodity, the New York Mercantile Exchange may be in for some
competition.
   The neighboring Commodity Exchange, which shares the same
trading floor with the Merc, has discussed a deal with London's
International Petroleum Exchange that could lead to crude oil
trading on the Comex, officials said Wednesday.
   The Mercantile Exchange, currently the world's largest market
for crude futures, hasn't faced any competition in this country
since the Chicago Board of Trade gave up oil trading a few years
ago.
   Oil experts say breaking into the oil market would be difficult
for any newcomer.
   ``There is a rule of thumb that only one contract in the same
commodity would succeed in any given time zone,'' said Peter
Beutel, an oil analyst with Pegasus Econometric Group Inc., in
Hoboken, N.J.
   The Comex, located with other New York futures exchanges in the
World Trade Center in lower Manhattan, deals primarily in precious
metals.
   ``We've been considering agreements with many exchanges and now
we're talking with the IPE about joint trading benefits,''
Commodity Exchange President David A. Halperin said in a statement.
   A Comex official who would speak only on condition of anonymity
said crude futures were part of the discussions, but the official
was not sure what the plans entailed.
   The official was not sure how soon an offering might be made,
assuming the Comex and London can strike a deal. A phone call
placed to IPE's New York office was not immediately returned.
   Crude oil has been the ``sexy'' futures contract in recent
months, since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in August sent oil
prices swinging wildly, said Christian Gohler, an oil broker with
Merrill Lynch Energy Futures. The bustle of trading at the
Mercantile Exchange oil pit has contrasted sharply with relatively
weak demand for metals.
   If the Comex offered sweet crude oil contracts, it would compete
directly with the Mercantile Exchange. But the Comex might offer
contracts in sour crude, which could put it a step ahead of the
Mercantile Exchange, which is now considering a sour crude
contract.
   Sweet crude has a low sulfur content and is most desirable for
refining. Sour crude has more sulfur and is more difficult to
refine.
   The two New York futures markets have failed in past discussions
to reach agreement on a merger. IPE was also once talking with the
Mercantile Exchange about a trading agreement, but those talks fell
through.
   Oil traders said the emergence of a crude contract on the
Commodity Exchange could stir bad blood between the exchanges. The
Mercantile Exchange said it would not fear any competition.
   ``We think we're the best at what we do, so we're ready to take
on any comers,'' said Robert R. Davis, senior vice president at the
Mercantile Exchange.
   Analysts who follow oil futures pricing doubt that the Comex
would be successful in offering a contract that competed with the
Mercantile Exchange's light sweet crude futures.
   Generally there is just room for one market for each commodity,
because the big players tend to gravitate to the place where the
volume is greatest and they can get the best deals, Beutel said.
   At the time the Mercantile Exchange first offered its futures
contracts for light sweet crude in 1983, the Chicago Board of Trade
began offering contracts for Louisiana Light Sweet crude, but those
sales were soon abandoned, traders said.
   But Beutel said an oil contract that could be traded in both
London and New York would create advantages for the biggest oil
trading companies that maintain offices in both cities.
   ``The fact that you could enter a position in London and remove
it in New York would come close to that 24-hour trading that some
people want,'' he said. It would put local traders and smaller
companies at a disadvantage, he said, because they would have a
harder time keeping abreast of trading for so many hours each day.
   London oil traders can now deal in futures of Brent Blend, a
North Sea oil. Oil futures are also available on the Singapore
International Monetary Exchange, but its contracts for Dubai crude
oil are not widely traded, analysts said.

<HEAD>Dollar Drifts Lower in Quiet Trading, Gold Higher</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar drifted lower against foreign
currencies Wednesday in what traders said was one of the quietest
trading days of the year.
   Gold prices were mixed.
   With currency trading thinned by the pre-holiday season, the
dollar eased largely on technical factors, mostly ignoring the
day's few external influences.
   ``A lot of people are already sidelined for the holidays. We had
absolutely no indicators come out today,'' said Gabriele Schmitt,
vice president for Bank of New York.
   Traders said the British pound showed signs of strength after
Chancellor of the Exchequer Norman Lamont said British interest
rates would remain at their current level and not be lowered.
   Sterling strengthened to $1.9502 in New York from late Tuesday's
$1.9380, and in London, the pound rose to $1.9435 from $1.9400 late
Tuesday.
   But traders said the market shrugged off an early-day rumor that
Iraq would withdraw its troops from Kuwait before the Jan. 15
deadline imposed in a resolution passed last month by the United
Nations. The rumor later proved to be untrue.
   The resolution permits the use of military force against Iraq if
the country remains in occupied Kuwait beyond the mid-January
deadline.
   ``People are pretty happy to stay square and not really get
involved that much,'' said Renato Strauss, currency trader at Bank
Julius Baer &amp; Co. ``I had one of the lowest volume days of the
year.''
   The dollar lost ground against the Japanese yen in New York,
closing at 131.45 yen from 132.40 late Tuesday. In Tokyo, the
dollar rose to a closing 131.88 Japanese yen from 131.75 yen at
Tuesday's close, and later in London it was quoted at 131.75 yen.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Tuesday's
prices, included: 1.4756 German marks, down from 1.4784; 1.2610
Swiss francs, down from 1.2650; 5.0120 French francs, down from
5.0190; 1,112.00 Italian lire, down from 1,114.00; and 1.1606
Canadian dollars, unchanged.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday's
rates, included: 1.4788 German marks, down from 1.4790; 1.2650
Swiss francs, down from 1.2665; 5.0240 French francs, up from
5.0230; 1.6675 Dutch guilders, down from 1.6683; 1,113.25 Italian
lire, up from 1,110.07; and 1.1599 Canadian dollars, up from
1.1591.
   Gold rose in New York, closing up 70 cents a troy ounce to
$372.70 on the Commodity Exchange. Republic National Bank later
quoted a bid of $371.45 a troy ounce, down 55 cents from late
Tuesday.
   In London earlier, gold rose to a late bid price of $371.75 a
troy ounce from $370.75 bid late Tuesday. In Zurich, the metal fell
to a closing bid of $371.60 from $371.85.
   But in Hong Kong earlier, gold fell $2.74 to close at a bid
$372.62.
   Silver fell on the Commodity Exchange in New York to $4.026 a
troy ounce, down 4.1 cents. The metal also fell in London to a late
bid price of $4.03 a troy ounce, from $4.06 bid late Tuesday.

<HEAD>Data General Chairman To Retire</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JONATHAN YENKIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Struggling with a string of losses, Data General
Corp. announced Wednesday that two of the computer company's
founders will take early retirement, including 52-year-old Chairman
Edson D. de Castro.
   De Castro will retire Dec. 31, and Vice Chairman Herbert J.
Richman, 56, will leave the company at the end of its fiscal year
in September.
   A statement from the company gave no reasons for the retirements
of the executives, who were among the founders of Data General in
1968. Company spokesman James Dunlap said De Castro was not
available for comment.
   Data General's stock closed unchanged Wednesday at $4.37{ a
share in New York Stock Exchange trading.
   Ronald L. Skates, Data General's president and chief executive
officer, praised de Castro as ``an industry legend.''
   He also commended Richman for leading the Westboro-based
company's sales and marketing efforts, saying Richman deserved much
of the credit for Data General's rapid rise in the market for
mid-range minicomputers.
   That market has fallen on hard times. Data General has not
enjoyed a profitable year since 1985, when its employment peaked at
17,700. Since then, the company has suffered a string of losses,
and employment has shrunk to around 9,500.
   Analysts say Data General has responded with some strong
products, particularly its AViiON workstations. But the
minicomputer slump has continued to act as a drag on earnings,
hampering the company's repeated efforts to turn a profit.
   Data General faces the added strain of lower profit margins as
it puts more focus on ``open'' computer systems, or those that
adhere to industry standards. Because the market is more
competitive, open systems are less profitable than the proprietary
machines that fueled much of the the company's growth.
   Data General lost $139 million in its most recent fiscal year.
Revenues were $1.22 billion, compared with $1.31 billion the year
before.
   Barry Willman, an analyst at the New York investment firm
Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co., said de Castro had been assigning
increasing responsibility to Skates, who assumed his present title
last year.
   Willman described de Castro as a ``visionary'' industrialist.
   But Sonny Monosson, president of Monosson Technology
Enterprises, a Boston firm that monitors high-tech industries, said
he believed Data General would gain from de Castro's departure.
   ``Really he was a hindrance to development,'' Monosson said.
``He was a strong-minded guy.''
   De Castro served as president from 1968 until he was named
chairman of the board and chief scientist in November 1989.
   The company said both de Castro and Richman would not seek
re-election to the board of directors. But Richman will continue to
serve as executive vice president for the AsiaPacific region until
he retires.

<HEAD>General Mills Profits Up 29.3 Percent in Second Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GOLDEN VALLEY, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   General Mills Inc.'s core businesses
performed solidly in the second quarter but a 29.3 percent increase
in profits included a one-time $9.2 million gain, the food and
restaurant company said Wednesday.
   Net earnings of $118.2 million, or 72 cents a share, for the
quarter ended Nov. 25 compare with $91.4 million, or 55 cents a
share, in the second quarter of fiscal 1990. Sales grew 13 percent,
from $1.63 billion to $1.84 billion.
   Excluding the net after-tax gain of $9.2 million, or 6 cents a
share, from the sale of the Lancia Bravo pasta operation and a
restructuring charge for Yoplait yogurt operations, profits for the
quarter were up 19.2 percent.
   Chairman H.B. Atwater, Jr. said expense controls contributed to
the growth in net income.
   The company said its consumer foods, including Cheerios,
Wheaties and Betty Crocker products, had a 12 percent gain in
second-quarter sales and a 23 percent increase in operating
profits. Those figures exclude the gain related to the pasta sale
and Yoplait restructuring.
   Atwater said the restaurants division had a 15 percent increase
in sales and a 16 percent gain in operating profits. The increases
were led by strong gains by The Olive Garden chain and moderate
increases by Red Lobster operations in the United States.
   General Mills is experimenting with a new restaurant concept,
China Coast, which restrained overall restaurant earnings growth,
Atwater said. Development costs associated with the fast-growing
Olive Garden chain also affected earnings, Atwater said.
   For the six months ended Nov. 25, the company had net income of
$247.7 million, or $1.51 per share, compared to $206.3 million, or
$1.25 per share, in the first six months of fiscal 1989. Revene
increased to $3.58 billion from $3.13 billion.
   Atwater said the company expects continued operating gains from
both of its divisions in the second half. He said overall results
also will reflect a gain on the sale of the O-Cel-O sponge
business, completed Friday, that will be reported in the
third-quarter results.

<TEXT>
   Merchants along the country's
northern border are floating on a tide of Canadian dollars,
watching sales figures swell at a time when shopping elsewhere in
the United States is slumping.
   Canadians have been traveling by car and bus from as far as 100
miles away this year to snap up goods that sell in the United
States for as low as half their cost back home.
   As a result, stores all along the border that reported record
sales last year - when retailing nationwide was stagnant - say
business is even better this Christmas.
   Bob Bowen, merchandising manager of a Kmart Corp. store outside
Niagara Falls, N.Y., said sales were up 15 percent over last year.
``And last year was a banner year, too,'' he said.
   Down the road, stores at the Factory Outlet Mall have been
reporting sales increases of anywhere from 5 percent to more than
10 percent over last year, said Pat Doyle, the mall's marketing
manager. She said up to 90 percent of the mall's customers are
Canadian.
   Parking lots at the Kmart and the mall were filled Wednesday
with cars bearing Ontario license plates, and chartered buses from
Canada were parked at the front.
   But seven miles away, at a Kmart in Niagara Falls, Ontario, only
three cashiers were on duty and the store was noticeably quiet.
   ``You Buffalo people are killing us,'' said merchandising
manager Dan Gimpel. ``There's not a heck of a lot we can do. People
are convinced there's bargains over there and they go over.''
   Richard Delisle, assistant district manager of Canada Customs in
Niagara Falls, Ontario, said the number of people paying duties on
goods purchased in the United States between April and October, the
most recent figures available, jumped 75 percent from last year's
record high.
   ``Each year we're looking at increases to unprecedented
levels,'' Delisle said.
   The story is the same in border towns across the country. In
Bellingham, Wash., 45 miles south of Vancouver, business at the
Bellis Fair Mall is up slightly thanks to the Canadians, said
marketing director Wendy Ripley.
   ``People are always amazed to see our parking lot and all the
Canadian cars in it,'' she said.
   In northern New York, motels are full of shoppers from as far
away as Ottawa and Montreal, and three-hour delays have been
reported on the international bridges.
   A recent study estimated that Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario,
businesses lose $140 million a year in sales to stores in much
smaller Sault Ste. Marie, Mich. The study, by Ernst &amp; Young in
Toronto, estimated the loss nationwide at $2 billion.
   Shopping by Canadians has surged even though Canada officially
is in a recession. Bern Rotman, spokesman for the New York State
Department of Economic Development, said the hard times in Canada
might actually spur more cross-border shopping.
   ``As the expendible income gets smaller in Canada - if that's
the case - it may very well be that the bargain that's had in the
United States is even more a siren song,'' he said.
   The price differences on many everyday items are staggering. An
eight-pack of batteries, for example, costs $3.97 in the United
States but $6.85 in Canada. A roll of color slide film that would
be less than $10 in New York is $14.59 in Ontario. Canadians pay
the equivalent of $2.16 a gallon for self-serve unleaded gas, while
those in Buffalo pay $1.43.
   ``A Canadian Kmart could probably come over here and buy power
tools cheaper off my counter than they could from their distributor
in Canada,'' said Thomas Reddy, general manager of the Niagara
Falls, N.Y., Kmart.
   Pam Clarkin said she drives 65 miles round-trip from her home in
Grassie, Ontario, to do her weekly grocery shopping in Niagara
Falls.
   ``Usually at home I pay about $120'' for a week's worth of
groceries, Clarkin said. ``Here I can get it for about $70.''
   Brian Kellett, a 19-year-old student at the University of
Toronto, said his fellow students make the 90-mile drive to Niagara
Falls as often as every two weeks to stock up on cheap booze and
cigarettes.
   ``Everybody comes down, they buy like a big jug of schnapps or
something,'' he said.
   Last year, Niagara Falls, N.Y., residents grumbled about the
traffic and litter problems they blamed on the Canadians. Merchants
said they had heard fewer complaints this year and speculated that
American shoppers have simply learned to put up with the crowds.
   ``They stay off the roads or go to Amherst (15 miles south)
where it's not so bad,'' said Bill Hench, manager of a Wallet Works
store at the outlet mall.

   A U.S. telecommunications company said
Wednesday it had signed an agreement to build and operate a
cellular phone network for the Soviet republic of Byelorussia.
   CommStruct International Inc. is committing an initial
investment of $7 million to introduce service to about 4,000
residential and mobile customers in the city of Minsk by mid-1991,
the company said.
   More than 200,000 customers in Minsk will be able to receive the
service when the system is completed.
   ``CommStruct looks forward to taking an active role in speeding
the development of communications in Byelorussia, the USSR's
gateway to Eastern Europe,'' said James Lewis, chairman of US
CommStruct Inc., a subsidiary of CommStruct International.
   Residents of the Minsk region must wait years for a private
phone, Lewis said. A cellular network would immediately serve a
portion of the hundreds of thousands of people awaiting phone
service in Byelorussia, he said.
   Two other cellular phone agreements with other non-Soviet
companies have been announced for the cities of Moscow and
Leningrad, he said.
   US CommStruct Inc. will build the system, while TLK &amp; Associates
of Yorba Linda, Calif., will engineer the system's radio frequency.
TLK also is a subsidiary of CommStruct International Inc., a
privately held, Vestal-based telecommunications company.

<TEXT>
   MGM-Pathe Communications Co. said
Wednesday it will delay paying interest for nearly a month on $400
million in debt incurred in the MGM-UA Communications Co. buyout.
   Delaying the payments will not put MGM-Pathe into default on the
debt because a 30-day grace period on payments is permitted.
   But Moody's Investors Service Inc., one of the big debt-rating
companies, immediately raised a red flag, announcing it was
downgrading some MGM-Pathe debt ratings.
   Payment will be delayed from Dec. 15 until Jan. 11 on two junk
bond issues underwritten by the now-defunct Drexel Burnham Lambert
Inc. When the bonds were issued, MGM-UA was owned by Kirk
Kerkorian, who sold it last month to Italian financier Giancarlo
Parretti's Pathe Communications.
   The company resulting from the merger is MGM-Pathe.
   MGM-Pathe spokesman Craig Parsons said the payment was delayed
primarily because the company already was burdened this fiscal
quarter with incidental costs of the MGM-UA $1.3 billion buyout,
including relocations and layoffs.
   MGM-Pathe's statement also cited ``higher than anticipated
MGM-UA payables.'' Spokeswoman Cecelia Wilkinson said two to three
times the normal amount of monthly bills had been allowed to
accumulate before Parretti took over, and he wanted to pay the
vendors as soon as possible.
   Asked about the downgraded debt rating, Parsons said the company
was merely exercising its rights under the debt agreement and did
not ``understand why there's the downgrading.''

<HEAD>German Company Charged With Not Telling FDA Drug Killed Patients</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEWARK, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A German manufacturer of an anti-depressant
drug that was sold worldwide said Wednesday it will plead guilty to
charges that it waited too long to notify U.S. regulators that the
medication killed two patients in Europe.
   Hoechst AG marketed the drug nomifensine in the United States
under the name Merital and voluntarily pulled it from shelves in
1986.
   The charges were filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in
Newark against Hoechst and its former research director, Rainer
Zapf, who will not be extradited to the United States, prosecutors
said.
   The company's U.S. subsidiary Hoechst-Roussel Pharmaceuticals
Inc., based in Somerville, was not charged.
   A court date for the plea has not been set.
   U.S. Attorney Michael Chertoff said the case marked the first
time a foreign drug maker has been prosecuted for failing to inform
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration of adverse drug reactions
that occurred outside the United States.
   More than 14 million people in 96 countries used the
anti-depressant from its introduction in the early 1970s to its
approval for use in the United States in December 1984, the company
said. Hoechst began marketing the drug in the United States in July
1985.
   Charges were filed because Hoechst waited until 1986 to inform
the FDA of a 1984 nomifensine-related death in France and a 1981
death in Italy, authorities said.
   Hoechst pulled the drug from the market after it noticed an
increase in hemolytic anemia in certain users, a potentially fatal
form of leukemia. The two patients in Europe died from hemolytic
anemia associated with the drug, according to court papers.
   Andrea Stine, a spokeswoman for the company, said she did not
know how widely the drug was used in the United States. She said
Hoechst recorded $5 million in U.S. sales from the anti-depressant.
   FDA attorney Rick Blumber said Hoechst acted properly when it
reported another death associated with the drug in Europe in April
1985. He said the anti-depressant was relabeled as a result of that
fatality.

<HEAD>Multimedia Expects Improved Results Despite Economic Slowdown</HEAD>

   Multimedia Inc. said Wednesday strength in its
cable television and entertainment businesses has more than offset
the adverse impact of a soft advertising market on its newspaper
and broadcasting businesses.
   Chairman and Chief Executive Walter Bartlett said the company's
revenue and income from continuing operations should be higher this
year than in 1989 and show improvement again in 1991.
   Bartlett's upbeat review of the Greenville, S.C.-based media
company's prospects at the 18th annual PaineWebber media outlook
conference contrasted with a number of gloomy industry forecasts
expressed earlier this week.
   ``Multimedia will be up this year and will be up again next
year,'' he told the securities analysts.
   Robert E. Hamby Jr., treasurer and chief financial officer, said
the company should meet analysts' earnings forecasts of $3.80 to
$3.90 a share this year excluding a previously-disclosed writeoff
of 25 cents a share.
   The company earned $3.11 a share in 1989.
   Multimedia owns 14 daily and 43 non-daily newspapers including
papers in Greenville, S.C., Asheville, N.C., and Montgomery, Ala.;
four TV stations and eight radio stations. It has applied for
Federal Communications Commission approval of the purchase of a 51
percent interest in a fifth TV station.
   Bartlett said the slump in retail advertising has kept pressure
on growth in newspaper and broadcasting revenue, which may continue
into next year until the economy improves.
   But he said this has been outweighed by improved results in its
cable TV system operations, which claim 347,000 subscribers, and in
entertainment operations, which include production of the
syndicated daily talk shows Donahue and Sally Jessy Raphael.
   The chairman said he expects to boost ad rates at its newspapers
by 6 percent to 7 percent next year and by 5 percent to 6 percent
in cable TV.
   Bartlett said the company has $375 million available for
acquisitions, but said it is in no rush to spend it. He said the
company recently passed up a chance to buy a television station
offered at eight times its annual cash flow.
   ``We are pleased to have the money in our hip pocket if
opportunities arise,'' he said.

   The first major Florida indictments growing out of
the savings and loan crisis charged Wednesday that bank officers
funded illegal campaign contributions and diverted $38 million in
deposits to cover losses on speculative investments.
   ``Had there been a mask and gun involved, we almost could have
called this bank robbery,'' said FBI agent William Gavin.
   Three ex-officers of the failed Fort Lauderdale-based
Commonwealth Savings and Loan and an investment broke were named
in two indictments carrying potential prison sentences of 15 to 256
years.
   Prosecutors charge the former executives' acts were a
significant reason for Commonwealth's failure in July 1989 after
the thrift absorbed a $33 million loss. The S&amp;L remains under the
control of the Resolution Trust Corp.
   Depositors were largely protected against losses by federal
regulations, but taxpayers will be stuck with Commonwealth debts.
   ``These individuals defraud the American public, these
individuals defraud the investors and the bank, these individuals
defraud the taxpayers in this kind of behavior,'' U.S. Attorney
Dexter Lehtinen said in announcing the indictments. ``The taxpaying
public is having to cover a horrendous loss.''
   The indictments charge that money set aside by a Catholic
charity, a construction union and other institutional investors was
diverted from the purchase of certificates of deposit to secret
accounts used to conceal losses on trades controlled by
ex-Treasurer Jason Chapnick.
   The accounts were credited with fake interest payments to lull
depositors into the belief that their investments were prospering,
prosecutors said.
   Bogus monthly brokerage-house statements, $11 million in
unrecorded Treasury bill sales, fake letters of credit and false
reports to independent auditors were part of the scheme to keep
anyone from discovering the diversions, the indictment charged.
   The criminal investigation was prompted by reports from
Commonwealth and regulators before the thrift failed, said
Lehtinen, who called S&amp;L fraud ``the largest crisis that the
country faces.''
   Chapnick, brother of Commonwealth Chairman Barry Chapnick, also
was accused of converting $1.5 million to his personal use,
including $700,000 to repay personal debts. A tax-perjury charge
covers his federal income tax returns.
   Barry Chapnick is mentioned in the indictment as the one who
selected the candidates for political contributions, but he was not
charged in the indictment itself. Lehtinen cautioned against making
much of the omission because the investigation is continuing.
   The probe was led by two prosecutors hired specifically to root
out S&amp;L fraud under federal bailout legislation, Lehtinen said.
   The additional staff is concentrating primarily on Commonwealth
and on Miami's failed CenTrust Savings, which has not yet been
charged.
   ``The scope of savings and loan fraud in South Florida in
general and the inability to staff the investigations here and
nationwide properly does impede some of the investigations,''
Lehtinen said.
   The expanded staff has been assigned to ``CenTrust, Commonwealth
and a few other known investigations, leaving many other
investigations in the district extremely short of either FBI or
U.S. attorney manpower, but not CenTrust or Commonwealth.''
   The fraud conspiracy indictment named: Jason Chapnick, 42, of
Fort Lauderdale, former vice president and treasurer; Kenneth
Fletcher, 41, of Davie, ex-president of Commonwealth's securities
trading subsidiary Commvest; and investment broker Herbert Leslie
Kalbach, 46, of Fort Lauderdale.
   Felix Adams, 41, of Bushnell, former executive vice president
and assistant secretary, was accused in a separate indictment of
misapplying Commonwealth funds on the political donations. Employee
contributions allegedly were reimbursed by Commonwealth.
   Charges and potential sentences are: Chapnick, 52 counts, 256
years in prison, $12.5 million fine; Fletcher, 32 counts, 160
years, $8 million fine; Kalbach, three counts, 15 years, $750,000
fine; and Adams, six counts, 30 years, $1.5 million fine.
   All four appeared Wednesday afternoon before U.S. Magistrate
Lurana Snow in Fort Lauderdale, where the grand jury issued the
indictments. Adams pleaded innocent, and arraignments were delayed
until Thursday for Chapnick and Friday for Fletcher and Kalbach.

   General Motors Corp., which already has a modest
vehicle assembly agreement in the former East Germany, will build a
new assembly plant in the region, a GM executive said Wednesday.
   Vice Chairman Jack Smith said the $675 million plant in Eisenach
will build 150,000 small Opel cars a year. Production is to begin
in the fall of 1992.
   GM has a joint manufacturing venture in Eisenach that began
building Opel Vectra midsize cars Oct. 5. Its target production is
10,000 vehicles a year, considered very low volume.
   GM has been the most aggressive of the Big Three in moving into
the former Communist nations of Eastern Europe. Among its ventures
are dealer networks in Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Poland and
Yugoslavia.

<TEXT>
   Texas Instruments Inc. and Toshiba Corp. of Japan
reached a 10-year cross-licensing agreement covering a broad class
of TI's microchip technology, Texas Instrument announced.
   Terms of the agreement, which replaces a 5-year accord expiring
at the end of the year, were not disclosed. The payments will be
based on worldwide sales of Toshiba semiconductors.
   Toshiba is the first of several semiconductor manufacturers in
negotiations with TI to reach an agreement. The companies, whose
licensing agreements expire at the end of the year, include most of
the nine semiconductor manufacturers TI sued for patent
infringement in 1986.
   The lawsuit also named Fujitsu Ltd., Hitachi Ltd., Oki Electric
Industry Co., Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., NEC Corp.,
Mitsubishi Electric Corp. and Sharp Corp. of Japan, and Samsung Co.
of South Korea.
   TI officials said in a news release that the new agreement
``reinforces TI's belief that it has the opportunity to earn a
significant ongoing stream of royalty revenues from its worldwide
patent portfolio.''
   Analysts say the deal could net the Dallas-based company
hundreds of millions of dollars.
   TI holds basic patents on the integrated circuit, the memory
chip and other semiconductor technology. In recent years, the
company has been aggressively enforcing its semiconductor patents,
suing U.S. and foreign manufacturers it believes are using its
technology without paying royalties.

   Oil prices dropped about $1 per barrel on the
futures market Wednesday, as OPEC ministers wrestled with a
potential glut of crude and demand by U.S. refineries tapered off.
   Light sweet crude for next-month delivery settled at $25.35 per
barrel, its lowest level since Aug. 3, the day after Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait. Contracts for January delivery finished down
$1.06. Later months also traded lower.
   Despite the latest fall and an overall bearish mood among oil
traders over the past two weeks, crude has seemed unwilling to give
up a remnant ``war premium'' of around $5 a barrel in recent
sessions on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
   With supply strong and demand weakening, oil traders said prices
would likely have fallen below $20 per barrel recently without the
lingering threat of a war in the Persian Gulf. But Iraq's
insistence that it will keep oil-rich Kuwait has kept crude above
$25 per barrel.
   The market ``seems to want to include at least a $5 to $6
premium while this incredible military standoff occurs,'' said
Thomas P. Blakeslee, an energy analyst at Pegasus Econometric Group
Inc., in Hoboken, N.J.
   Crude staged a brief rally Wednesday as traders responded to a
continued diplomatic stalemate between U.S. and Iraqi officials
over a date when Secretary of State James A. Baker III should go to
Baghdad to discuss the crisis.
   The United States wants the meeting to occur in early January,
but Iraq insistson waiting until just before Jan. 15. The U.N.
Security Council has given Iraq until that date to either get out
of Kuwait or face a possible military strike.
   But the market was more intently focused on the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries meeting in Vienna.
   OPEC ministers were warned their gushing crude production could
lead to an oil glut and falling prices when the Gulf crisis ends,
but they appeared reluctant to quickly cut output and lift slipping
prices.
   Traders in New York were also put in a bearish mood by the
weekly American Petroleum Institute report, issued Tuesday evening,
which indicated the nation's refinery utilization had dropped from
88 percent of capacity to 83 percent of capacity in the past week.
   That means demand for crude oil will be down, experts said.
   ``When that many refineries decide to cut runs, they don't shift
those dials every day or every week, so it's pretty structurally
bearish,'' said Christian Gohler, an oil broker with Merrill Lynch
Energy Futures.
   As crude fell, futures prices for refined petroleum products
also took a dive.
   Home heating oil dropped 3.05 cents to 74.63 cents a gallon on
contracts for delivery in January. Unleaded gasoline fell 2.30
cents to 64.49 cents a gallon on contracts for delivery in January.
   Natural gas, which is not threatened by the possibility of war
in the Middle East, dropped 8.1 cents to $2.204 per 1,000 cubic
feet on contracts for January delivery.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The accounting firm of Coopers &amp; Lybrand,
charged by federal regulators with making a faulty audit of a
failed Colorado savings and loan, has agreed to tighten its
auditing procedures, the government announced Wednesday.
   The Office of Thrift Supervision said its settlement with
Coopers &amp; Lybrand was its first major enforcement action against a
big accounting firm. Experts have noted that accountants played an
important role in the $500 billion savings and loan scandal, but
until now regulators have focused their attention mainly on S&amp;L
operators and directors.
   The charges against Coopers &amp; Lybrand stemmed from its 1986
audit of Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan Association of Denver,
whose board of directors included President Bush's son Neil. The
collapse of Silverado in December 1988 is expected to cost
taxpayers $1 billion.
   The Office of Thrift Supervision had accused Coopers &amp; Lybrand
and Arthur L. Knight, who headed the firm's team that handled the
Silverado audit, of, among other things:
   -Accepting an unjustified understatement of Silverado's
allowance for loan losses on its $1.3 billion loan portfolio.
   -Relying on appraisers' judgments that were not justified by
market conditions or by financial statements applying to the
properties behind the loans.
   -Not following accounting principles.
   The loan loss allowance should have been $35 million higher, the
Ofice of Thrift Supervision said.
   The auditors ``did not possess the expertise required to
properly complete the Silverado audit,'' the office asserted in a
legal brief released with its announcement.
   ``This is a significant case for OTS, for those who provide
professional services to insured institutions and for the public,''
said Timothy Ryan, director of the office, in a written statement.
``It says loud and clear that we hold accountants, lawyers and
other professionals accountable for their actions, just as we do
S&amp;L directors and officers.''
   In its settlement, the accounting firm agreed to meet a number
of auditing requirements over the next five years. In addition,
Knight agreed not to audit any insured savings institutions.
   ``In today's emotional and super-charged environment Coopers &amp;
Lybrand decided as a prudent business matter not to incur the
expense, aggravation and substantial publicity that would have been
associated with fighting the Office of Thrift Supervision,'' the
firm's general counsel, Harris J. Amhowitz, said in a statement of
his own.
   Amhowitz's statement indicated that Coopers &amp; Lybrand believes
its Silverado audit was not faulty.
   ``During the relevant 1986-87 period, the firm conducted several
hundred audits of savings institutions with no indication of any
endemic audit failures,'' the statement said. ``The GAO's report to
Congress regarding audits by various accounting firms of failed
savings assocations expressed no criticism of Coopers &amp; Lybrand's
audits.''
   Coopers &amp; Lybrand agreed, among other things, to ensure that
employees on S&amp;L audits are competent, and to comply with
accounting principles for those audits.
   If Coopers &amp; Lybrand had not settled the charges, it could have
been required to participate in a public administrative hearing.
That hearing could have resulted in orders to the firm to do, or
stop doing, certain things.
   Neil Bush has been charged with conflict of interest in not
fully disclosing his business ties with two big Silverado
borrowers. The thrift agency is seeking an administrative order
against Bush, an oil and gas developer, that could lead to barring
him from the banking and savings industries.
   Bush, 35, has denied any wrongdoing. Administrative Law Judge
Daniel J. Davidson is expected to recommend by Jan. 2 what
sanctions, if any, should be taken against Bush.
   Bush and other former Silverado directors, as well as the
thrift's law firm, have been charged with negligence in a $200
million lawsuit filed in September by the Federal Deposit Insurance
Corp.

   The combined circulations of Newsday, the Long

Sunday for the first time, the joint publisher said Wednesday.
   Newsday sold 600,000 copies and New York Newsday sold 400,000,

strike at the rival Daily News began Oct. 25.
   ``This is a milestone in our publishing history and something
that we can all be proud of as the pinnacle of our 50th
anniversary,'' Johnson said.
   Before the Daily News strike began, Sunday circulation had been
562,000 for Newsday and 150,000 for New York Newsday. Since the
strike, the five-day average daily circulation of New York Newsday
has increased from 221,000 to just under 350,000. Newsday's weekday
editions have risen from a prestrike 492,000 to almost 525,000.
   Newsday was founded in 1940. New York Newsday, with a separate
editorial staff, began publishing in 1985. Both are owned by Times

<HEAD>T. Boone Pickens' Mesa Looks To Change Debt</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mesa Limited Partnership, led by investor T. Boone
Pickens, is working on a second transaction to repay 95 percent of
its bank debt, a spokesman said Wednesday.
   The deal, coupled with the sale of natural gas properties
finalized last week, will ``significantly strengthen the balance
sheet,'' said Sidney Tassin, who works with general partner Pickens
on Mesa's financial transactions.
   Mesa has been looking for ways to repay $1 billion in short-term
bank debt. Its cash flow has been hobbled by low natural gas
prices.
   Tassin said a broker is looking for buyers for Mesa's debt
through a so-called private placement. American Banker reported
Tuesday that Mesa hopes to raise $600 million through the
placement.
   The funds raised would be used to repay Mesa's bank debt, Tassin
said. The result would be debt that could be repaid over a longer
period of time, 15 to 20 years, he said.
   Mesa incurred debt through the purchase of natural gas
properties, which are long-term assets. Repayment of the new debt
will match with the life of Mesa's natural gas assets, Tassin said.
   Mesa has also eliminated some of its debt through the sale of
assets.
   The partnership last week finalized an agreement to sell about
13 percent of its reserves to Houston-based Seagull Energy Corp.
The transaction will trim about $350 million from Mesa's debt. Its
completion hinges on Seagull obtaining financial commitments.
   After the deal is closed, which is expected to be early next
year, Mesa's primary interests will be in the Hugoton field of
southwest Kansas, the West Panhandle field of Texas, the San Juan
Basin of New Mexico and in the Gulf of Mexico.
   The private placement and sale to Seagull will repay about $950
million of Mesa's $1 billion in bank debt.
   Mesa's debt for more than 10 years has been secured by its prize
properties in the Hugoton field.
   Mesa earlier this year decided not to pay common or preferred
dividends to partners because of the lower cash flow. That left
Pickens, who is compensated with 1 percent of Mesa's cash
distribution, without a regular salary.

<HEAD>Hilton Stock Shoots Up on Report of Buyout Interest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hilton Hotels Corp. stock shot up
$6.67{ to $42.12{ a share Wednesday on a report that an investor
group was mulling a $75 per share offer for the hotel-gaming
concern.
   Trading volume was more than 2.5 million shares - 10 times the
normal trading for Hilton on the New York Stock Exchange.
   A spokesman for the hotel-casino concern said no one had
approached it about a buyout.
   Hilton had put itself up for sale and the stock hit an all-time
high of $115.50 in summer 1989. The company took itself off the
market last March after entertaining offers, including some from
Japanese companies, that came in lower than expected.
   That decision, along with weak earnings, worries about the
travel business and the Persian Gulf crisis, sent the stock to as
low as $27 in recent months.
   Hilton spokesman James Galbraith cited a televised report
Tuesday night by financial commentator Dan Dorfman as the reason
for the big jump in Hilton's share price. Dorfman said some
Japanese investors were included in the interested group.
   Michael Mueller, an analyst who follows hotel and gaming
companies for Montgomery Securities Inc. in San Francisco, noted
that Hilton's stock price had been on the rise before the report.
   ``I turned positive on these stocks when the oil prices went
down and it looked like there might be peace in the Gulf,'' Mueller
said.
   Although the Japanese have recently bought such ``trophy''
properties as the Pebble Beach golf resorts and MCA Inc., Mueller
said he was skeptical about the chances of getting financing for a
bid such as described by Dorfman in today's tight credit markets.
   ``That would be a $4.5 billion transaction,'' Mueller said. ``It
would be very tough right now to finance a real estate-hotel
transaction of that kind.''

   DePree founded Zeeland-based Herman Miller in 1923, buying Star
Furniture Co. with the help of his father-in-law, for whom the new
company was named. DePree served as general manager until 1949 and
president until 1962, when he was named chairman.
   The company is the second largest of its kind after Steelcase
Inc. of Grand Rapids.
   DePree, a Zeeland native, was not a designer, but the company
became known for hiring now-famous industry names such as Gilbert
Rohde, Charles Eames and Robert Probst.
   Herman Miller furniture has been featured at the New York Museum
of Modern Art and the Smithsonian Institution.
   During DePree's tenure, the company produced the ``House of
Tomorrow'' for the 1934 World's Fair, the modular wall storage
system, molded plywood and plastic chairs of the 1940s, and the
stacking chairs of the 1950s.
   Earlier this year, DePree was named to the American National
Business Hall of Fame, which recognized his development in the
1950s of a ``humanistic'' approach to the work place, including
participatory management, profit sharing and employee incentives.
   The publicly held, Fortune 500 company has been named one of the
``10 most admired'' companies by the magazine.
   DePree served nearly 10 years as pastor of Ventura Baptist
Church in Zeeland. He also served as international president of the
Gideons Society.
   DePree's son, Hugh, is president emeritus of the company and
another son, Max, is chairman. His other surviving children are
Merle Schaap of Lansing and Betty Van Kley of Zeeland.
