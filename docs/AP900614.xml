   Cardinal John O'Connor on Thursday warned that
Roman Catholic officials who support abortion rights could face
excommunication, but church experts and politicians dismissed the
threat.
   The cardinal delivered his strongest and clearest statement yet
on the subject of excommunicating pro-choice Catholic politicians
in a 12-page piece in Catholic New York, the weekly archdiocesan
newspaper.
   ``Where Catholics are perceived not only as treating Church
teaching on abortion with contempt, but helping to multiply
abortions by advocating legislation supporting abortion, or by
making public funds available for abortion, bishops may decide that
... such Catholics must be warned that they are at risk of
excommunication,'' wrote O'Connor, who is the chairman of the
bishops' Committee for Pro-Life Activities.
   ``If such actions persist, bishops may consider excommunication
the only option,' he added. O'Connor did not mention any
politicians by name, and said any bishop would ``engage in
considerable prayer and discussion'' before taking such action.
   Excommunication blocks a Catholic from receiving most sacraments
within the church.
   U.S. Rep. Charles Rangel, who was barred from speaking at a high
school graduation at St. Patrick's Cathedral last week because of
his pro-choice stance, said he did not want to believe O'Connor had
issued ``such a mean-spirited statement.''
   ``The cardinal obviously has a closer working relationship with
God than I do, so therefore I would not risk challenging his
authority,'' Rangel, D-N.Y., said in Washington. ``On the other
hand, I feel very comfortable that comes Judgment Day, we will be
on equal footing.''
   Gov. Mario Cuomo, speaking at City Hall, reaffirmed his position
of personal opposition to abortion but public support of a woman's
right to decide. The governor then acknowledged the talk of
excommunication bothered him.
   ``I don't like to hear it. How could you? This is something
fundamental to our family,'' said Cuomo.
   Experts in church policy disagreed with O'Connor, saying support
of a pro-choice stance was not grounds to expel politicians from
the church.
   ``He's wrong,'' said the Rev. Richard McBrien, chairman of the
theology department at the University of Notre Dame in South Bend,
Ind. ``On the question of abortion, the only person clearly
subjected to excommunication would be the person who procures the
abortion.''
   That would mean the woman and perhaps her doctor, but not
politicians, he said.
   ``Mario Cuomo is not performing abortions. Mario Cuomo is not
running an abortion clinic on the side,'' said McBrien. ``He
(O'Connor) doesn't really have a canonical leg to stand on.''
   The Rev. Robert Drinan, a former Massachusetts congressman,
agreed that O'Connor's statements were misguided.
   ``That goes against what the bishops have been saying,'' said
Drinan, a Georgetown University Law Center professor. ``I think
that won't be taken that seriously. Catholics and everyone else
would resent it.''
   But the Rev. Joseph Penna, speaking for the Archdiocese of New
York, said Thursday evening that a person could be excommunicated
even if they do not directly take part in an abortion.
   ``It goes beyond who procures an abortion,'' said Penna, of St.
Joseph's Seminary in Yonkers. If church officials determined that
an individual served as an accomplice to an abortion by ``giving
scandal to other people,'' that person could be excommunicated, he
said.
   ``And by giving scandal, I mean a person would look at someone
else and say, `If that person can do it, so can I,''' said Penna,
speaking of the leadership roles that politicians play in society.

<TEXT>
   The bodies of two climbers missing on
Mount McKinley were found by rescue helicopters hovering near the
16,000-foot level of North America's tallest peak, a National Park
Service spokesman said.
   The bodies of Michael Koshuta, 33, of Centreville, Va., and
Stuart Jones, 29, of Washington state were spotted Tuesday
afternoon, said spokesman John Quinley. No hometown was immediately
available for Jones.
   The men were declared missing Tuesday, one day after a troubled
Japanese climbing party that suffered the season's first fatality
was airlifted off the mountain.
   There was no effort to remove the bodies from the 15,800-level
because of the slope of the mountain and the threat of avalanche.
Officials will decide later when it will be safe to return, Quinley
said.
   The men were roped together and appeared to have died after a
fall, the spokesman said. They were last sighted June 1 at the
16,100-foot level. Mount McKinley is 20,320 feet tall.
   Koshuta and Jones were experienced mountaineers who had climbed
elsewhere in the Denali Range, Quinley said. There were no
immediate clues as to what caused the accident or when it happened.
   The two climbers were scheduled to complete their descent four
days ago. Three food caches they left along their planned route
down the mountain hadn't been touched, Quinley said.
   Denali National Park rangers began looking for them Monday as
rangers and two Army Chinook helicopters rescued three frostbitten,
ill Japanese climbers and lowered the body of a fourth Japanese to
14,000 feet. The helicopters began looking for the missing
Americans on Tuesday.
   The body of Hairoaki Ito, who died Sunday of altitude sickness,
was expected to remain at 14,000 feet until friends could arrange
for its removal or until an Army helicopter is called to the area
on other business, Quinley said.

<TEXT>
   Jack Henry Abbott, fighting to keep the rewards
of the writing career he developed in prison with Norman Mailer's
help, said Thursday that when he killed a young actor in 1981, he
caused no financial loss to the widow.
   Acting as his own attorney in defense against a $17 million
wrongful death lawsuit, Abbott said his victim, Richard Adan, had
no more than $500 when he was killed and was being supported
largely by his wife, Ricci, now 32.
   He also has insisted that he killed Adan swiftly with a knife
stab to the heart, and therefore Mrs. Adan deserves no payment for
Adan's pain and suffering.
   Following the judge's final instructions, the jury deliberated
briefly, then was excused until Friday.
   Abbott, 46, gained fame from writing ``In the Belly of the
Beast,'' a best-seller composed of letters he sent from prison to
Mailer from 1978 through 1981.
   Mailer supported Abbott's parole that year. Abbott had been out
of prison six weeks when he slew Adan outside the Bini-Bon
restaurant on Manhattan's Lower East Side on July 18, 1981.
   Abbott spent more than three hours in closing arguments Thursday
trying to convince the jury of six that Adan, 22, was one of
thousands of young actors of modest talent who had a
``one-in-a-million'' chance of success before he died.
   Abbott sneered at a Pace University economist's projections that
Adan might have netted $17 million in his lifetime. Abbott said the
projections assumed that Adan ``would have been a movie star of the
caliber of Paul Newman.''
   Mrs. Adan's lawyers have proceeded on a theory of Adan's
``future value,'' Abbott said, ``because they have nothing more to
go on.''
   As Abbott belittled Adan he stood at a lectern, dangling his
left hand, which has the letters J-A-C-K tattooed on the four
fingers.
   Mrs. Adan reacted to Abbott's argument by laying her head on the
knee of Henry Howard, her stepfather.
   On Wednesday, Abbott reduced Mrs. Adan to tears, then said her
weeping would prejudice the jury against him.
   ``Mrs. Adan, I noticed you have a lot of tissues,'' he said as
he cross-examined Mrs. Adan. ``Did you anticipate weeping on the
stand? Do you have any children?''
   ``No!'' she said.
   ``Just you?'' Abbott said.
   ``Yes,'' she said as she started to weep more loudly.
   Abbott then demanded a mistrial because of ``prejudice and
bias.'' The judge denied the motion.
   Daniel Leonard, one of Mrs. Adan's lawyers, told the jury in a
12-minute summation Thursday that the future was all the couple had.
   Observing the defendant's constant references to himself,
Leonard told the jury that the case was not about Abbott. ``It's
about the promise of a great life, about two young people's future
together,'' the lawyer said.
   Abbott, who said he has been out of prison a total of 11 months
since he was 12, is serving 15 years to life for a first-degree
manslaughter conviction in Adan's death.
   Mrs. Adan sued him for $10 million for wrongful death and pain
and suffering. Her lawyers upped the lawsuit to $17 million after
testimony by the economist, Edmund Mandell.
   While Abbott maintains Adan endured no pain because the knife
thrust killed him almost instantly, Leonard said there was proof
that ``Richard suffered greatly for 10 or 15 minutes before he
died.''
   Mailer, very visible during Abbott's criminal trial, has been
absent from this one. He has not been reached for comment.
   Mrs. Adan's lawyers estimate that Abbott has a little more than
$100,000 in escrow held by the Manhattan sheriff in case of a civil
judgement in Mrs. Adan's favor. Abbott also has $15,000, earned
from his writings, that is being held by the state Crime Victims
Board.
   Abbott asked each witness, ``Did you read my book?'' At one
point he even asked Judge Carol Arber. She replied that she had
looked at parts of it.
   He attacked Mrs. Adan and her family, saying they wanted to
punish him by insuring that no publisher will deal with him because
of the legal lien on his finances.
   ``These proceedings have been brought by Mrs. Adan to stop me
from publishing again,'' Abbott said.

<HEAD>Trying To Grab the IRA: Extradition Disputes Worsen</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Dermot Finucane, Northern Ireland
jailbreaker and IRA gunman wanted by Britain, is enjoying a fine
Dublin summer, savoring freedom and drawing welfare checks.
   ``It's a great victory,'' said Finucane, 29, who has spent most
of his adult life in jail or on the run. ``For someone suddenly to
say you're free ... it's also frightening and bewildering and
wonderful at the same time.''
   To the British government, his freedom is infuriating and the
reasons are disturbing.
   In March, the Irish Supreme Court refused to extradite Finucane
to British-ruled Northern Ireland. It said his offense of
possessing weapons was politically inspired, since the Irish
Republican Army is fighting to unite Ireland.
   The five judges added that Finucane probably would be beaten by
prison guards if returned to the jail from which he escaped in 1983.
   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain called the ruling
``deeply offensive'' and said it encouraged ``terrorists to the
view that they will probably find a safe haven in the Republic of
Ireland.''
   Disputes over extradition have long clouded relations between
the two countries, but things reached a new low after Finucane and
an IRA comrade, James Clark, walked free March 13 into the arms of
jubilant supporters. Both were convicted in Northern Ireland and
sentenced to 18-year prison terms.
   Prime Minister Charles Haughey's Fianna Fail party, political
heirs of the Irish nationalist heroes who wrested independence from
Britain in the 1920s, is instinctively opposed to handing Irish
people over to the British.
   The IRA is dedicated to overthrowing the institutions governing
the Irish Republic, as well as British rule in Northern Ireland.
Ireland, like Britain, outlaws the organization and keeps its
supporters off radio and television.
   Extradition remains a problem, however, because of the deeply
rooted belief that an Irish nationalist will not get fair treatment
from the British.
   In the past year, British appeal judges have quashed the
convictions of four Irish people jailed for IRA bombings in Britain
in 1974 and three who were accused of plotting to assassinate a
British government minister.
   Six Irishmen serving life sentences for a 1974 bombing in
Birmingham that killed 21 people have won widespread support for
their campaign to prove they were unjustly convicted.
   It all ``reinforces widespread unease about the conduct of court
cases in Britain in which Irish people are charged with terrorist
offenses,'' said columnist Mary Holland of the Irish Times, which
opposes the IRA.
   Among those who got away is a Roman Catholic priest, Patrick
Ryan. The Irish attorney general refused his extradition on
terrorism charges in 1988, declaring British politicians and
newspapers had damned Ryan in such intemperate language that a fair
trial was impossible.
   Britain and other Irish political parties are putting pressure
on Haughey to amend the extradition laws. Critics want it spelled
out that such crimes as murder or possessing weapons cannot be
deemed political.
   ``The idea that such barbarism should somehow be construed as a
form of political action is nauseating and immoral and cannot
continue,'' said Desmond O'Malley, leader of the Progressive
Democrats, the Fianna Fail's junior coalition partner.
   Recent bombings in London have increased the pressure on Haughey.
   The British say the attacks herald a summer onslaught in
mainland Britain as part of the IRA campaign to unite
Protestant-dominated Northern Ireland with the overwhelmingly
Catholic republic.
   Haughey says a 1987 act curtailing the plea of political
motivation will ``do away with the present difficulties.'' He tells
critics to wait and see how the courts apply the 1987 statute,
which incorporates the European Convention on the Suppression of
Terrorism.
   ``Our extradition laws are amongst the best in the world,'' he
told Fianna Fail's annual convention soon after Finucane was
released.
   Also, however, delegates endorsed a resolution opposing any
extraditions ``to Northern Ireland and Britain in present
circumstances.'' It said suspects should be tried instead under the
republic's anti-terrorist laws.
   Although Finucane's case predates the 1987 act, some critics say
his release has undermined it and is good news for five Northern
Ireland fugitives fighting extradition under the stricter law.
   Cases still take a year or more to grind through appeals, and
scope remains in the 1987 act for fighting extradition on political
grounds2, Britain has made 112 applications for extradition of
security offenders, Northern Ireland officials say, with seven
granted, 41 refused, and five still being fought. The rest lapsed.
   To Northern Ireland's unionists, the Protestant.
   Since 197 majority,
Ireland looks like a haven for their terrorist foes. The British
feel let down, because improved extradition procedures were
supposed to be the reward for giving Ireland a say in the running
of Northern Ireland under the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement.
   Ireland's Progressive Democrats began a campaign May 14 to
toughen the extradition law, and found the opposition Fine Gael and
Labor parties generally supportive.
   ``It is a huge scandal that that man (Finu on suspected safe houses
in 1987.
   His brother Patrick, a lawyer who defended IRA suspects, was
shot to death and Protestant militants claimed responsibility.
Another brother, Gerard, is in an Irish jail for IRA activity and
John Finucane was killed in an auto accident en route to an IRA
operation.

   Explosions ripped through a gasoline
storage plant in southwest Indiana on Wednesday, seriously injuring
three men.
   The largest of seven cylindrical tanks at the Greene County Farm
Bureau Co-op exploded about 2:30 p.m. and was still burning
Wednesday night, state police Cpl. Omar Davis said in Bloomington.
   Davis said officials of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
were determining whether to smother the blaze with foam or let it
burn itself out.
   Although fears that the fire would spread to the other tanks
subsided, residents up to two miles away were evacuated.
   ``Two businesses are very close and there are a few scattered
homes nearby, but it's mostly rural,'' said sheriff's dispatcher
Sheri Campbell.
   The size of the tank and the amount of gasoline it held had not
been determined, Davis said, noting conflicting reports that it
contained 8,000 gallons or 42,000 gallons.
   Davis said the accident occurred as workers emptied a gasoline
truck into the tank using a pump.
   ``The pump apparently sparked and ignited the truck and from
there, somehow or other, the tank caught fire,'' he said.
   The three injured were taken to hospitals to be treated for
burns.
   Leo Goodwin, listed in critical condition, was taken to Riley
Hospital in Indianapolis; Dick Smiley, also listed as critical, was
taken to Wishard Hospital in Indianapolis; and Richard Knight, who
was in serious condition, was taken to Deaconess Hospital in
Evansville, Davis said. Their ages and hometowns were unavailable.
   Dark smoke was seen as far away as six or seven miles from the
plant, which is outside Switz City, 75 miles southwest of
Indianapolis.

<TEXT>
   The KGB has identified a park outside the
Ukrainian city of Kharkov as the likely burial site of 3,900 Polish
officers massacred by the Soviet secret police in 1940, the Polish
PAP news agency reported.
   The victims represent part of the approximately 15,000 Polish
officers from three internment camps who were systematically killed
in what has become known as the Katyn Massacre.
   More than 4,300 bodies of the executed Polish officers were
discovered at Katyn near Smolensk in 1943, but the exact fate of
the other missing officers has remained a mystery. The 15,000
officers were seized by the Soviet Union in the early days of World
War II.
   Soviet officials acknowledged in April that the officers were
killed by the NKVD, Stalin's secret police and the KGB's
predecessor. For decades, Soviet governments had maintained that
the officers died at the hands of invading German armies.
   PAP quoted the chief of the KGB office in Kharkov, a city of 1.2
million 500 miles south of Moscow, as saying the Polish soldiers
were buried in a wooded park around the city. The KGB chief was not
identified. The report was published Wednesday in the Polish
government newspaper Rzeczpospolita.
   PAP said the burial site also contained some Soviet victims of
the NKVD.
   The officers whose remains were found at Katyn had been interned
at a camp in Kozielsk, in western Russia.
   Still unknown is the final resting place of the more than 6,000
Polish officers interned at the third Soviet camp at Ostashkov, a
town 200 miles northwest of Moscow.

   The financial center of Frankfurt is Western
Europe's most prosperous city _ followed by Brussels, Venice,
Munich, and Amsterdam, a university report says.
   The Belgian, Italian, Dutch and West Germany cities led 117
urban areas ranked by University of Reading economics professor
Paul Cheshire.
   Only European Community cities with a minimum population of
300,000 were considered and Portugal and Greece were not included
because they could not provide adequate figures, said Cheshire.
   To determine the cities' rankings, Cheshire said he looked at
their per capita gross domestic product, unemployment, migration
and other factors.
   The three poorest cities in the survey were all in Spain:
Malaga, Cordoba and Seville.
   The results, based on figures up to 1988, are to be published in
the July issue of Urban Studies, an international journal published
in Britain. Cheshire made a copy of his article available to The
Associated Press on Wednesday.
   The cities that fared best are large, have big service sectors,
and are centrally located in Europe, Cheshire said: ``European
economic integration is of much greater benefit to the more central
regions of Europe than it is to the more peripheral ones.''
   The rest of the list also was dominated by West German cities.
   Here are the remaining 25 most prosperous urban areas:
   6. Strasbourg, France
   7. Bonn, West Germany
   8. Nice, France
   9. Stuttgart, West Germany
   10. Florence, Italy
   11. Palma, Spain

   Police hurled tear gas
canisters to disperse protesting student teachers outside the
Education Ministry in a rare confrontation on this French Caribbean
island.
   One protester was struck by a tear-gas canister and injured in
the clash, police said Wednesday. They said an academic inspector
from France was attacked while leaving the ministry.
   Another protester, who had been staging a hunger strike at the
government building for more than a week, was hospitalized because
of weakness.
   About 60 people had been taking part to protest the French
government's refusal to allow student teachers to complete their
training on the island rather than in France.
   Residents said it was the first violent clash between police and
protesters on the island in at least 20 years.
   Martinique, with a population of 333,000, is a French overseas

The island is part of the Windward chain 425 miles south of Puerto

   Massachusetts' Democrats have filed a lawsuit
accusing a White House aide and the Springfield police union of
conspiring to disrupt the party's convention.
   The union picketed the convention hall in Springfield on June 2,
preventing delegates from entering for several hours.
   Among those named in the lawsuit filed in state court Wednesday
were Ronald Kaufman, deputy assistant to President Bush for
personnel, and union president Robert Jacobson.
   The lawsuit alleges that Kaufman and the union conspired to
violate Democratic delegates' right to assemble and that pickets
struck, shoved and spit on people who tried to enter the convention
hall.
   Kaufman was in Springfield at the time of the convention, spoke
with Jacobson the night before the protest and also met with
members of the union in Washington before the convention.
   But he and Jacobson have repeatedly denied they conspired to
interfere with the convention. Jacobson said the protest was part
of a dispute with the city.
   ``I'm glad they're filing because I've got a secret weapon:
truth,'' Kaufman said Wednesday.
   The lawsuit seeks an unspecified amount in damages.

<HEAD>Fast-Killing Monkey Virus Could Shed Light on AIDS</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Slight genetic mutations allowed a monkey AIDS
virus to kill within days rather than months, a finding that could
improve scientists' understanding of human AIDS, researchers
reported today.
   The result raises the possibility that a human AIDS strain may
exist that kills within days or weeks of infection, rather than
years, said study co-author Patricia Fultz.
   A federal AIDS expert said he strongly doubts such a human
strain exists. But he and Fultz said the monkey virus may still
help scientists study AIDS.
   The new work is presented in the British journal Nature by
Fultz, of the Yerkes Regional Primate Research Center at Emory
University in Atlanta, with scientists there, at Harvard University
and the Stanford University School of Medicine.
   They studied a recently isolated strain of a simian
immunodeficiency virus. Scientists study these monkey viruses,
called SIVs, to gain clues about AIDS.
   In monkeys called pig-tailed macaques, the fast-acting SIV
produced bloody diarrhea and death in as little as six days after
it infected the animal, researchers reported. In contrast, the
virus from which this strain evolved allows eight months or more of
survival after infection, Fultz said Wednesday.
   The genetic makeup of the fast-acting virus strongly resembles
that of other SIVs and gained its wallop by acquiring only subtle
mutations, so the possibility that a fast-acting human AIDS virus
exists must be considered, the researchers said.
   But Malcolm Martin of the Laboratory of Molecular Biology at the
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda,
Md., said it is highly unlikely such a virus exists.
   No such virus has been observed in the hundreds of thousands of
people infected with the AIDS virus, and if a fast-acting human
version were going to appear, it would have shown up by now, he
said.
   Further study of the fast-acting SIV strain may identify the
genes that make it act so quickly, which in turn may give clues for
fighting the human AIDS virus, Fultz said.
   Martin said that since the virus causes severe disease more
quickly than other SIVs, it may also provide a way to test AIDS
therapies more quickly.

   Tommy Martin is a single woman's dream.
He's a mature, easygoing bachelor, he's a good cook and he even
does windows.
   Boy, does he do windows!
   Every day this week, Martin scales the sheer face of the
30-story Gannett Co. Inc. headquarters building, one of the tallest
in metropolitan Washington, D.C., to scrub its 5,000 windows from
the outside.
   The annual spring cleaning takes Martin, 53, and his buddy,
Lucien Coleman, 62, about three weeks. They finished Gannett's twin
USA Today building last week, and both gleaming towers will be
washed again this summer and fall.
   From his perch on a gently swaying platform only three feet
wide, Martin has a breathtaking view of Washington's monuments and
tree-shaded malls across the Potomac River. The 380-foot plunge
from Gannett's rooftop to the busy streets below is an acrophobic's
nightmare, but a downward glance doesn't bother Martin.
   ``It's a good job,'' he says. ``A lot of people look up to you.''
   Martin's been a professional window washer for 30 years and he's
never suffered high anxiety from the time he climbed trees as a
kid. No sweaty palms, no churning stomach, no dizzy spells. He
doesn't take tranquilizers, and sleeps like a baby at night.
   He did utter a prayer once when his platform tipped over and he
took a four-story free fall until he was caught by the heavy safety
rope attached to his belt. He escaped with only rope burns on his
hand.
   Martin is such a relaxed fellow that when one of his platform's
electrically powered hoist cables stalled, leaving him swinging 100
feet in the air for half an hour, he simply laid down until an
engineer fixed the problem.
   ``It wasn't going anywhere, so I took a little nap,'' he said.
   Martin likes the fresh air and sunshine, the pay is good ($140 a
day) and the solitude of working at great heights gives him plenty
of time to think, he says.
   For entertainment, he waves at startled office workers as he
suddenly drops into view, a sort of high-rise peeping Tommy. The
other day, an airliner roared so close to the Gannett building on
its approach to nearby National Airport that ``I could see the
passengers inside,'' he said.
   Martin says he can ride up or down the building in 20 minutes,
swabbing windows and aluminum paneling with a sudsy solution of
household detergent and ammonia and scraping them dry with a
squeegee.
   A lifelong bachelor, Martin cooks his own dinner when he returns
home for the evening. His favorite is meatloaf and collard greens.
But he offers a warning to any females who might be hunting for a
husband:
   ``I don't do windows around the house.''

   Mayor Marion Barry, struggling against drug
possession and perjury charges, said Wednesday he would not seek
re-election to a fourth term. ``Now is a time for healing,'' the
embattled mayor said.
   Barry hastily summoned his cabinet to reveal his decision
shortly before he told his constituents via a televised
announcement.
   His move sparked speculation of an effort to rekindle plea
bargain talks that broke down over a week ago. However, Barry
denied that his political decision had anything to do with his
trial.
   Barry has pleaded innocent to 10 misdemeanor cocaine possession
charges, one misdemeanor cocaine conspiracy charge, and three
felony counts of lying to a grand jury about his alleged drug use.
As jury selection crawled along, U.S. District Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson said he hoped to seat a jury on Monday.
   ``Now is a time for healing, healing for me personally and for
you politically,'' Barry said.
   Barry said public opinion polls indicated he could win another
term, but he added, ``What good does it do to win the battle if in
the process I lose my soul?''
   Barry's pre-taped address was broadcast on Howard University
radio and television.
   Barry ``is seeking to portray himself as a victim, someone who's
given up something very important in the wake of these charges,''
said one source who has spoken to Barry several times in the past
week. ``The thinking is, the jury may go easy on him if they feel
he's voluntarily dropped something so dear.''
   Barry decided over the weekend not to seek re-election, but
postponed making the announcement because of publicity surrounding
the efforts of Jesse Jackson and others to act as mediators in
Barry's case, sources said.
   Barry's decision was expected to boost the mayoral candidacies
of D.C. Council member John Ray and Walter Fauntroy, the District
of Columbia's non-voting delegate to Congress. Barry's successor
will take office Jan. 1.
   Barry said his decision ``will go a long way toward lifting the
shadows'' over other candidates' campaigns. He noted that some have
called on him to resign immediately, but said that would be
``disruptive'' for the city.
   Barry supporters have organized a rally for Thursday outside the
courthouse where the mayor's case is being tried. Anita Bonds,
Barry's campaign manager, has circulated a letter to city workers
urging them to attend.
   Meanwhile, six potential jurors questioned Wednesday said they
would not be affected by either an announcement that Barry would
forgo seeking a fourth term or a declaration that he would run.
Prosecutors had raised the issue with the prospective jurors.
   Interviews of the prospective jurors will end at noon Friday,
the jury will be seated Monday and opening statements will be
Tuesday morning, said Jackson. Seventy-seven people have been sent
into a pool of potential jurors since the process began June 4.
   Barry aides had floated the idea of a plea bargain last week in
which the mayor would agree to plead guilty to misdemeanor charges.
But sources close to U.S. Attorney Jay Stephens' office said the
prosecutor would not accept a deal that did not include a felony
conviction.
   Stephens has said any decision Barry made on re-election would
be irrelevant to the criminal case.
   But for the first time on Wednesday, lawyers raised questions
with the prospective jurors about Barry's political plans.
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Judith Retchin asked one woman if her
work on the criminal case would be affected if she learned Barry
were not going to seek re-election.
   No, replied the prospective juror, who had worked a number of
years ago in a city summer youth employment program. Nor would she
be affected if Barry announced he would run, said the woman, who
reiterated her answers when questioned similarly by R. Kenneth
Mundy, the mayor's lawyer.
   A second prospective juror said he wouldn't be affected by a
Barry announcement on his political future.
   ``If it's not part of the trial, I would not consider it,'' said
the man.
   One man said that he would regard a decision by Barry not to run
for re-election as an admission of guilt. He said he thinks Barry
should resign because the publicity surrounding the investigation
and prosecution of the mayor ``has hurt the city.'' That man was
one of seven excluded from the jury pool.

<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A plan to reduce logging by 46 percent in
Washington's largest national forest was announced Wednesday, and
more drastic reductions may be ordered to protect the northern
spotted owl, officials said.
   Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest supervisor Doug
MacWilliams briefed a few dozen interest-group representatives on
the 10-to-15-year plan for land and resource management.
   He said it represents a major shift in favor of recreation and a
``very severe'' blow to the timber industry.
   The proposed timber harvest reductions would cost about 1,800
jobs, MacWilliams said. ``Every one of us in this room will feel it
in some way or another,'' he said.
   ``When you go to buy a 2-by-4, you're going to be paying through
the nose for it,'' he said.
   The plan, replacing one dating from 1963, takes effect 90 days
after publication Friday in the Federal Register and will remain in
effect pending the outcome of appeals, MacWilliams said.
   Representatives of industry, landowner and environmental groups
all say they will appeal various aspects of the plan. It is the
product of 10 years of research and debate, but is subject to
amendment by the Forest Service.
   Mount Baker-Snoqualmie, covering 1.7 million acres from the
Canadian border to the area around Mount Rainier National Park, is
the second largest timber-producing national forest in Washington.
   At the same time, it probably has the heaviest recreation
demands of any national forest in the state, said forest spokesman
Warren Olney.
   The plan would set the average annual timber harvest at 108
million board feet _ 46 percent less than the average for the past
decade and 36 percent less than proposed in a draft plan two years
ago.
   The forest would produce $526 million in income a year,
MacWilliams said.
   The harvest would drop to 45 million board feet, however, if a
scientific report on protection of the owl is accepted by the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service, he said.
   Fish and Wildlife officials are scheduled to decide by June 23
whether to list the owl as threatened, a decision that would
trigger further logging restrictions.
   However, MacWilliams said, the harvest would rise by a total of
roughly 40 percent over the two decades following the planning
period and then level off at a sustained-yield level.
   About 95 percent of the roadless acreage would remain intact and
97 percent of the 643,000 acres of old growth would remain in the
year 2000.
   Old growth was defined in the plan as trees at least 21 inches
in diameter measured 4{ feet from the ground.
   Using the Wilderness Society's definition of at least 32 inches,
however, there is only about half as much virgin forest left, said
Jean Durning, regional director of the environmental group.
   Other features of the plan include a recommendation that 30
rivers stretching along 462 miles be designated as wild and scenic,
a protection now accorded in Washington only to the Skagit River
system. The draft plan had proposed wild-and-scenic designation for
five rivers.
   The plan also calls for construction of 220 miles of trails,
rebuilding of 493 miles and maintenance of 891. The draft plan had
called for 80 new miles, 240 for rebuilding and 1,144 for
maintenance.

   Zsa Zsa Gabor has opted to serve a three-day
jail sentence for slapping a motorcycle policeman rather than
pursue an appeal.
   ``She's just tired of it, and 72 hours isn't going to kill
her,'' spokesman Phil Paladino said Wednesday.
   The 72-year-old Miss Gabor probably will go to jail within a
month, he said.
   ``As Zsa Zsa would say, you can't beat City Hall,'' Paladino
said. ``In her heart, she's innocent.''
   Miss Gabor was convicted of smacking Beverly Hills Officer Paul
Kramer during a traffic stop a year ago. She also was sentenced to
community service at a homeless shelter and ordered to pay court
costs and fines totaling $12,000.

   Comedian Jackie Mason has been ordered to pay
$2,000 a month in child support to a 37-year-old former girlfriend
he denies getting pregnant.
   A state appeals court Tuesday upheld a ruling in favor of Ginger
Reiter, who filed a paternity lawsuit three years ago alleging
Mason had fathered her 4-year-old daughter, Sheeba.
   The 60-year-old comic denies he is the father and had appealed
the earlier child-support ruling.
   A judge had ruled that blood tests show there is a 99.94 percent
chance that the girl is Mason's daughter.
   ``I feel thrilled because now I can send Sheeba to a religious
school,'' said Reiter, who operates a singing telegram service. ``I
have collection agencies hounding me.''
   Mason's lawyer, Gerald Mager, declined to comment.

   Mr. Universe Matthew Dufresne faces
federal charges of conspiring to smuggle body-building steroids
into the country.
   Dufresne, 24, of Hampden was indicted Tuesday on charges of
conspiring to import steroids from Belgium and with possession of
5,000 doses of the drug.
   In October, he was chosen Mr. Universe by the North Atlantic
Body Building Association, the second person to win that title in
the same year he was Mr. America.
   Anabolic steroids are used to build muscles and stamina but can
have dangerous side-effects and are banned by international
athletic organizations.
   The charges against Dufresne carry up to 13 years in prison and
fines of $260,000.
   Dufresne did not immediately return a call to his home.

   A drifter who nearly killed Theresa Saldana
in a knife attack eight years ago has been ordered to stand trial
on charges of sending the actress threatening letters from prison.
   Municipal Judge Alma Soper issued the ruling Wednesday in the
case of Scottish-born Arthur Jackson, 54.
   ``I am very grateful,'' Miss Saldana said in a statement. On
Tuesday, the actress, who was in the movie ``Raging Bull,''
testified Jackson had sent her terrifying death-threat letters.
   Jackson, an obsessed fan who stalked the actress and attacked
her, was convicted of attempted murder and sentenced to 12 years in
prison in 1982.
   His sentence was cut in half for good behavior and he was due
for release in April, but the new charges have kept him behind bars.
   The charges carry up to six years in prison.

   A gasoline barge sprang a leak Wednesday night,
spilling at least 1,200 gallons and prompting officials to close
two busy waterways that have been plagued by spills, authorities
said.
   The source of the spill into the Arthur Kill waterway was
believed to be a tank on the barge holding more than 222,000
gallons of unleaded gas, said Coast Guard Petty Officer Don Burt.
   The tank was emptied about two hours after the leak was reported
to the Coast Guard at 8:05 p.m., but officials were waiting for
divers to confirm no other tanks were leaking into the Arthur Kill
waterway dividing New York's Staten Island and New Jersey.
   It was not immediately known what caused the spill. More than 10
million gallons of fuel were loaded into 10 tanks on the barge at
Carteret, N.J., during the afternoon, then the vessel traveled
across the Arthur Kill to a Mobil Corp. operation on Staten Island.
   After the spill, the Fire Department sent about 10 units to the
Port Mobil section of Staten Island, spokesman John Mulligan said.
   The Arthur Kill and adjacent Kill Van Kull were closed shortly
after 9 p.m. as a safety precaution while firefighters attempted to
disperse the gasoline to speed evaporation.
   Brooks said it was not immediately known how long the kills
would remain closed. Booms were laid at entrances to nearby creeks
to prevent the gasoline from spreading inland, he said.
   He said the barge was owned by Bouchard Transportation of New
York. Calls to the company were not answered Wednesday night.
   The amount of oil accidentally released into the two kills this
year is four times as much as was reported in all of 1989.
   The most recent accident occurred last week when an 811-foot
tanker leaked 260,000 gallons of oil into the Kill Van Kull. On
Jan. 2, a pipe from an Exxon refinery leaked more than 567,000
gallons of oil into the Arthur Kill.

<HEAD>House Passes Its Version of Multibillion AIDS Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM M. WELCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two huge spending bills to help cities and
states cope with the AIDS crisis are heading to a conference
committee now that the House has approved its $4 billion version.
   The House bill was approved 408-14 on Wednesday, sending it to a
panel that will compromise it with a Senate version that would
spend $1 billion less over five years.
   The overwhelming House vote came in the face of opposition by
the Office of Management and Budget, which argued that the bill was
too costly and should not have been focused on a single disease.
   ``The bill's narrow disease-specific approach sets a dangerous
precedent, inviting treatment of other diseases through similar ad
hoc arrangements,'' a budget office statement said.
   ``This approach also runs counter to the government's existing
health care financing system, which will provide more than $870
million in federal Medicaid payments for HIV disease in 1991,'' it
said, referring to the AIDS-causing human immunodeficiency virus.
   The House bill authorizes $400 million in each of the next five
fiscal years for grants to provide a variety of AIDS preventative
health services. Half the money would go to state governments, and
the rest directly to health care facilities.
   It authorizes another $275 million a year for the next two
years, and ``such sums as may be necessary'' for the following
three years, to go directly to cities with the largest number of
AIDS cases. The money would go to AIDS health care and support
services.
   The bill authorizes smaller amounts for a series of other AIDS
projects, including $20 million a year for research into helping
pediatric patients and grants to states for purchasing drugs to
treat AIDS and related conditions.
   The House adopted amendments that scaled back the estimated
five-year cost of the bill from $4.6 billion to around $4 billion.
   It rejected amendments that would have required states to test
all citizens annually for the AIDS virus, and would have required
institutions to report anyone who tests positive to state
authorities.
   Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., likened AIDS to natural disasters
that have prompted Congress to appropriate money to local
governments.
   ``This bill says to cities like New York, which has 25 percent
of total AIDS cases in the country, that we understand your
problem,'' he said. ``Hospitals are collapsing with the financial
burden placed on them'' by AIDS.
   Besides New York, other cities expected to receive emergency
grants under the House bill are: Atlanta, Boston, Chicago, Dallas,
Houston, Jersey City, N.J.; Los Angeles, Miami, Newark,
Philadelphia, San Diego, San Francisco, San Juan, Puerto Rico; and
Washington, D.C.
   The Senate last month approved, 95-4, to approve a similar bill
that would spend an estimated $2.9 billion over five years.
   The AIDS virus is transmitted through blood and other body
fluids. Homosexual contact and intravenous illicit drug use are
primary transmitters.
   The 14 members voting against the bill were all Republicans.
They were: Philip Crane, R-Ill.; John Duncan Jr, R-Tenn.; Mickey
Edwards, R-Okla.; George Gekas, R-Pa.; Mel Hancock, R-Mo.; Clyde
Holloway, R-La.; Duncan Hunter, R-Calif.; Jon Kyl, R-Ariz.; Ron
Marlenee, R-Mont.; Carl Pursell, R-Mich.; Dan Schaefer, R-Colo.;
Gerald Solomon, R-N.Y.; Bob Stump, R-Ariz.; and Robert Walker, R-Pa.
   Not voting were: Reps. Bill Frenzel, R-Minn.; Augustus Hawkins,
D-Calif.; Joseph Kennedy, D-Mass.; John LaFalce, D-N.Y.; Jim
Lightfoot, R-Iowa; Romano Mazzoli, D-Ky.; Bill Nelson, D-Fla.;
Charles Rangel, D-N.Y.; Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill.; and Denny Smith,
R-Ore. Not voting by tradition was House Speaker Thomas S. Foley,
D-Wash.

<TEXT>
   The U.S. government is illegally withholding from
Manuel Noriega's lawyers file cabinets full of thousands of secret
Panamanian documents seized during the American invasion, a defense
attorney says.
   Michael O'Kane, attorney for co-defendant Daniel Miranda, said
an inventory that a private investigator found in a U.S. Army
warehouse in Panama showed the government gave a shorter list of
all seized material to the defense.
   ``We found wadded up in one of the boxes as garbage what we
think is the real inventory,'' O'Kane said Wednesday.
   He said the defense was given a sanitized list as part of a
``coverup effectuated in Panama by unknown elements within the
government of the United States.''
   Omitting evidence would violate a U.S. magistrate's order that
an inventory of all Noriega-related documents seized in the
December invasion be turned over to the defense, O'Kane said. On
Wednesday he filed a motion demanding a full accounting of the
files.
   O'Kane said there was no indication the Miami U.S. attorney's
office knew its list was sanitized.
   Diane Cossin, spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office, had no
comment on the motion. Nor did Pentagon spokeswoman Maj. Kathy
Woods.
   The newly discovered list indicates the Army confiscated file
cabinets containing Panamanian intelligence files, weapons
import-export records, confidential correspondence and files on
anti-Noriega coup plotters, O'Kane said.
   The lawyer emphasized that many of the missing documents
appeared to be essential.
   Noriega contends many of his activities were sanctioned by the
United States, and that U.S. and Panamanian records would show he
cooperated with the CIA, Drug Enforcement Administration and other
investigative agencies.
   Jon May, an attorney for Noriega, said he had not seen O'Kane's
list but that the general's defense is eager to examine the lists
and documents.
   O'Kane's client, Miranda, is charged with helping to fly drug
profits from Fort Lauderdale to Panama. He faces up to five years
in prison.
   Noriega faces up to 145 years in prison on charges of accepting
$4.6 million from Colombia's Medellin drug cartel to turn Panama
into a haven for U.S.-bound drugs.

   Dave Durenberger has been in the Senate for 12
years, but his colleagues now regard him from across a great divide
_ they the judges and he the judged.
   No attempt at mild humor, no appeal to mutual concerns, no
allusion to past relationships was enough to evoke a smile or even
a change of expression from the six solemn men who will decide
Durenberger's future.
   They are trying one of their own _ a Republican from
squeaky-clean Minnesota, a man who has served on good-government
panels for decades, a former member of the Senate Ethics Committee
itself, and now accused of intentionally skirting and violating
Senate rules to make himself richer.
   The ethics committee had scheduled up to two weeks of hearings,
but it agreed to a request Wednesday from Durenberger's lawyer, Jim
Hamilton, to end the hearings early because of the legal fees the
senator would incur.
   Instead, Durenberger turned over 23 volumes of documents into
evidence for the committee to consider.
   The panel's lawyer, Robert S. Bennett, has recommended that
Durenberger be denounced by the Senate, a severe reprimand that
while short of expulsion, usually leads to the end of a lawmaker's
career.
   ``Gentlemen, I don't need to tell you that reputation is the
lifeblood of public service,'' Durenberger said amiably as he began
his statement of self-defense on Wednesday.
   No flicker.
   ``I have never once `worked' the facts in this case with my
colleagues, even though we have all of these political and personal
relationships,'' he continued.
   No flicker.
   Durenberger chuckled that a son's college graduation last
weekend had entailed eight years and four different schools. He
wondered, jokingly, who in his right mind would try to evade Senate
rules by creating an outfit called ``Piranha Press'' to publish his
books.
   No one on the panel smiled.
   He spoke of his four sons, his first wife's early death, his
marriage to a Vietnam War widow, the sorrow that ``made bonding
difficult in our family.'' He talked of religion, lessons learned,
his ``acute sense of sadness'' and resolve to be a model public
servant.
   His six judges sat impassively.
   If no sympathy was apparent from those behind the long
velvet-draped dais, Durenberger did command some support among
spectators in the huge marbled hearing room. There was his youngest
son, Dan, 23. And there was Sen. Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn., a
surprising presence to some.
   Durenberger is too well-liked to have become a pariah, at least
not yet. He was appointed last week, as expected, to a conference
committee on the clean air bill. He is scheduled to speak Friday at
his state's Independent-Republican Party convention.
   Nevertheless, ``senators aren't rushing to do photo
opportunities with him,'' as one Capitol Hill staffer put it.
   Durenberger defends himself partly by saying he did only what he
believed other lawmakers were doing; he also says his aggressive
approach to his job created ``strains and vulnerabilities'' in his
family life and in his decision-making process.
   Neither argument seems to be going over well. There is concern
that Durenberger's well-publicized troubles will tar an institution
that gets little enough respect as it is. There is also a feeling
that while many senators have financial and personal problems, they
have managed to play by the rules.
   Durenberger's fans in the audience are worried that his case
could be used as a warning to other senators, at his expense.
   ``It sounds like they feel like they need to make a statement,
to say this just can't continue,'' said Meredith Musaus, 33, pastor
of a visiting church youth group from Faribault, Minn.
   In Durenberger's pleasant Senate office, two receptionists and a
couple of young aides watched his speech on television. The wall
behind the TV set was covered with photographs of prominent
Minnesota politicians and a sign that said: ``No man's life,
liberty or property are safe while the legislature is in session.''
   Business proceeded as usual, except for a smattering of calls
from people expressing support for the senator and an occasional
right-on sign at the TV screen when Durenberger made an emphatic
point.
   ``My life and my reputation are at stake,'' Durenberger, on
television, was saying emotionally as a man walked into his office
and plunked down a briefcase.
   ``For the mistakes I have made, I repeat that I am sorry,'' said
the senator, an imploring note in his voice.
   ``I have an 11:30 appointment with Anthony,'' the man with the
briefcase said. He never even glanced at the TV.

   Researchers have created a ``wand'' that
alters living animal cells by bombarding them with microscopic
DNA-coated pellets, Duke University scientists said Wednesday.
   ``There is a whole range of genetic applications,'' said Stephen
Johnston, a molecular biologist at Duke.
   ``I think we are just at the frontier of realizing what the
potentials are of being able to modify cells in the living
organism,'' he said.
   The scientists say the technology could be ready for use within
a year and eventually could help treat liver and heart diseases.
   But they added that its future depends on further breakthroughs
and on society's attitude toward genetic engineering.
   The research results were reported Wednesday at the annual
meeting of the Tissue Culture Association in Houston.
   Duke researchers, in collaboration with scientists at Cornell
University and the DuPont Co. used the ``wand'' to alter cells of
living mice by injecting new genes, with little or no adverse
effects, they said.
   The ``wand'' eventually may be used to treat some liver diseases
by supplying the missing gene that causes certain defects, to alter
pancreatic cells to produce insulin, or to alter muscle cells to
treat heart diseases, the scientists said.
   ``It's an interesting new approach to a very important problem
in modern molecular biology,'' said Lee Hood, professor of biology
at California Institute of Technology.
   Using pressurized helium gas, the ``wand'' propels, at 1,000
feet a second, microscopic DNA-coated pellets into the tissue.
About 10 million pellets, each containing about 30 genes, are
introduced. The pellets are so small _ .00003 inches across _ that
they do not cause extensive damage, researchers said.
   DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is the collection of genes in
living cells that determine individual characteristics.
   Because the pellets do not penetrate deep into the tissue, the
animal does not suffer any trauma or skin irritation, Johnston
said, adding that a human subject might feel a slight stinging
sensation.
   The ``wand'' must be improved before it can be applied to human
diseases, researchers said. They said questions remain about
whether the altered genes can permanently take hold in animal cells.
   To date, the genes have been effective only as long as the
pellets remained in the tissue, about 10 days in the ear of a mouse.
   Existing techniques for modifying the DNA of living organisms,
such as bone-marrow transplants, involve an indirect process in
which cells are removed from the patient, altered and then
re-introduced, the researchers said.
   DuPont said it will make a version of the ``wand'' available to
researchers.
   The precursor to the ``wand'' is a mechanism that uses gunpowder
to fire gene-coated tungsten pellets into plant cells, the
researchers said. That instrument was invented by John Sanford of
Cornell University, who also worked on the ``wand'' team.
   DuPont bought the rights to the earlier instrument and markets
it to agriculture and industry.

<HEAD>Glasnost Slow to Reach Rural Regions, Officials Say</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Small-town and rural Soviet citizens are
missing out on many of the new freedoms urban residents enjoy under
glasnost, a State Department official says.
   Residents of outlying areas still must contend with the old
Communist Party power structure, Richard Schifter, assistant
secretary of state for human rights, said Wednesday.
   In those areas, ``a person's job assignment and housing remain
dependent on the good will of the local party boss, who will most
assuredly discriminate against anyone who steps out of line,''
Schifter told the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on human
rights and international organizations.
   However, he said, ``What we might refer to as First Amendment
freedoms have come to the Soviet Union's urban areas and the clouds
of fear which hung over them have lifted.''
   Schifter noted that restrictions on religious freedom are not
being enforced and that on Tuesday, the Supreme Soviet approved a
law ending media censorship.
   On Wednesday, the Soviets agreed to begin easing its 2-month-old
economic embargo against independence-minded Lithuania. The Tass
news agency quoted Lithuanian Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene
as saying the Soviet government had agreed to restore some fuel and
raw material supplies to the Baltic republic.
   Curtis Kamman, deputy assistant secretary of state for European
and Canadian affairs, noted that under the Soviet embargo,
``Lithuania by now should have been brought to its knees, and
obviously it has not.''
   Lithuania got help from the other two Baltic republics, Latvia
and Estonia, and from other sources, he said.
   Also attending Wednesday's hearing was Mart Niklus, an Estonian
who spent most of his adult life in Soviet prisons and labor camps
for political dissidence.
   He said he agreed that conditions are vastly improving, but
added that if the Soviet Union removed its troops from the Baltic
republics, ``many other problems would be automatically resolved.''
   Niklus, who was released from prison in July 1988, is traveling
through the United States, Canada and Europe to seek support for
Baltic independence.
   Schifter said the Soviet Union faces serious problems with its
economic crisis and severe ethnic conflicts in some areas.
   But he added, ``One cannot help, when visiting the country, but
be encouraged by this resurgence of the human spirit.''
   ``Yet, the KGB is still in place,'' Schifter told the House
panel. Although it no longer pursues political dissidents, he said
there was concern that ``the KGB could quickly revive the apparatus
of repression if ordered to do so.''
   Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., said the end of censorship means
``there is little that cannot be said or written nowadays in the
Soviet Union, provided one can find the paper and ink.''

   Dave Durenberger would become the ninth
senator to suffer the Senate's second most severe punishment if his
colleagues agree he should be denounced for financial misconduct.
   The Senate Ethics Committee is weighing possible punishments for
the Minnesota Republican after abruptly ending trial-like hearings
against him on Wednesday by accepting 23 volumes of documents into
evidence.
   The committee's special counsel, Robert S. Bennett, suggested
the panel recommend to the Senate that Durenberger be publicly
denounced for ``reprehensible'' financial misconduct that brought
``dishonor and disrepute'' on the chamber.
   Denouncing a senator is tantamount to condemning or censuring
him, and it usually leads to the end of the lawmaker's career,
authorities said
   ``In a collegial body, it's a severe reprimand,'' said Don
Ritchie, associate Senate historian.
   The committee had scheduled up to two weeks of hearings, but it
agreed to a request from Durenberger's attorney, Jim Hamilton, to
end the sessions early because of the legal fees Durenberger would
incur.
   The panel's vice chairman, Sen. Warren B. Rudman, R-N.H., said
the committee could make its decision based on written documents
and statements by Durenberger, his lawyer and Bennett.
   ``There is not a great deal of dispute about the facts,'' Rudman
said. ``There's obviously a great deal of dispute about what those
facts mean.''
   A decision is not expected for several weeks.
   Durenberger made an emotional appeal to the committee Wednesday
to show compassion. He denied he intentionally broke ethics rules
but acknowledged he had caused the Senate ``real damage.''
   The committee has found ``substantial credible evidence'' that
Durenberger violated Senate rules and the law by evading honoraria
limits through a book promotion deal and hiding his ownership in a
Minneapolis condominium so he could collect travel reimbursement
for staying there.
   Ritchie said the committee can essentially render or recommend
one of three different punishment for a senator:
   _A reprimand, also called admonishment or rebuke, that would
require only the approval of the committee.
   _Censure, denunciation or condemnation. This would require a
majority vote of the Senate.
   _Expulsion. A two-thirds vote of the Senate is required to
remove a member. The Senate has almost never acted to expel a
member who wasn't convicted of a serious crime, Bennett said.
   Sen. Joseph McCarthy, R-Wis., was ``condemned'' by the Senate in
1954 for his witch hunts of supposed communists. Two others have
been censured since then: Thomas Dodd, D-Conn., in 1967; and Herman
Talmadge, D-Ga., in 1979, both for financial misconduct.
   In this century, two others have been censured: Benjamin Tillman
and John McLaurin, South Carolina Democrats who were punished for a
brawl on the Senate floor, Ritchie said.
   The damage to a senator's career has almost always been mortal.
Tillman is the only censured senator who won re-election.

   The Nixon presidential library opening next
month will become ``the most complete source of materials about
President Nixon and his life and presidency,'' even though it will
have no original White House documents, a spokesman says.
   The White House announced Wednesday that President Bush will
attend the library dedication in Yorba Linda, Calif., on July 19,
almost 16 years after Nixon resigned the presidency in the wake of
the Watergate scandals.
   Former Presidents Reagan and Ford also will attend. Former
President Carter was invited, but said he had another engagement.
   Nixon's assistant, John Taylor, said from the former president's
office in New Jersey that Nixon would be accompanied by former
first lady Pat Nixon and members of their family.
   Only the exhibit portion of the library, along with the restored
home in which Nixon was born in 1913, will be immediately opened to
the public. The archival portion, containing pre- and
post-presidential Nixon papers and copies of White House documents,
is scheduled to open sometime next year.
   Nixon resigned from office on Aug. 8, 1974, after the House
Judiciary Committee had voted to impeach him on grounds that
included a cover-up of White House involvement in a break-in at
Democratic Party headquarters in the Watergate office building.
   Both Reagan and Bush have conferred at times with the former
president, but Bush's appearance in Yorba Linda will mark one of
the few times since Nixon's resignation that a president has shared
a public platform with him.
   Reagan spoke at a departure ceremony at the White House on Oct.
9, 1981, as Nixon, Ford and Carter left for Egypt to represent the
president at the funeral of slain Egyptian President Anwar Sadat.
   Nixon has not attended any of the four Republican national
conventions since his resignation.
   Unlike other presidential libraries, the Nixon library will be
operated by the private foundation that raised the money to build
it. The eight others are run by the National Archives, as the
Reagan library will be after it opens its doors next year in Simi
Valley, Calif.
   Also unlike the other libraries, the Nixon library will not
contain original White House documents. They are stored in a
National Archives building in Alexandria, Va., where they are being
processed and made public.
   Taylor said the library will contain papers from Nixon's years
in the House and Senate, his campaigns and the period since he left
the White House. He said it will also house some of his vice
presidential papers. Some were deeded to the government and are in
a National Archives facility in Laguna Niguel, Calif.
   In addition, the Nixon aide said, preliminary discussions are
being held about making copies of some 1.5 million pages of
presidential documents now in the Alexandria archives building.
   ``When the archival level of the library opens in 1991, the
Nixon library and birthplace will be the most complete source of
materials about President Nixon and his life and presidency,''
Taylor said. ``It will include copies of all critically important
presidential documents.''
   The National Archives holds about 40 million pages of Nixon
White House documents, but Taylor said these ``include a lot of
Christmas cards and Life magazine collections of staff members and
various less important documents.''
   He said copying would focus initially on the special files of
the archives' Nixon Project, containing work papers of the
president and key staff members.
   ``We have not even begun to investigate how the copies are going
to be made,'' said Taylor. ``It may even be that technology will
enable us to transfer the documents to a laser disk at a much
reduced cost.''
   Jill Brett, public affairs director of the National Archives,
said agency regulations permit people to do copying on their own,
with approved equipment, under staff supervision.
   Congress gave control of Nixon's presidential papers to the
archives in 1974. Nixon challenged the act's constitutionality, but
it was upheld in 1977 by the Supreme Court. The former president
also lost a challenge to regulations adopted under the act.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The agency that put men on the moon, rescued
lost satellites and sent spacecraft to distant planets is looking
for new worlds to conquer. And it wants ideas from you.
   The National Aeronautics and Space Administration decided
recently to go outside the agency, away from its normal
contractors, to get fresh thinking on ways to establish a permanent
base on the moon and put humans on Mars.
   Not only the public, but universities, engineering schools and
professional science and engineering organizations were invited to
contribute.
   NASA even set up a toll-free telephone line for the ideas:
800-677-7796.
   NASA Administrator Richard H. Truly has sent more than 3,200
letters to the heads of schools asking for their help. The Rand
Corp. in Santa Monica, Calif., will filter the good ideas from the
bad before passing them on to Washington. The toll-free number
reaches Rand.
   The search for ideas, from an agency noted for turning science
fiction into reality, started last July with a pledge by President
Bush that the United States was headed back to the moon _ ``this
time to stay'' _ and would push on to Mars.
   Bush set that goal in a speech observing the 20th anniversary of
man's first footsteps on the moon. More recently, he said the Mars
landing should be accomplished by the 50th anniversary of the Neil
Armstrong-Buzz Aldrin moon landing _ in the year 2019.
   A NASA-sponsored study estimated the cost of going to Mars at
$500 billion or more, a sum that would require more money each year
than the agency's current budget for all space activities
   Vice President Dan Quayle, as head of the National Space
Council, has been pressing NASA officials to go outside normal
channels and ``cast their net widely'' for more efficient and
cheaper ways to return to the moon and to plant the U.S. flag on
Mars.
   The space agency also has been challenged by others, such as
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory which said astronauts could
be landed on Mars for $11 billion using existing rockets and
inflatable spacecraft. And the Aerospace Industries Association has
urged that a study group be set up outside of NASA to receive
proposals and evaluate them.
   In answer to such unaccustomed outside pressure, Truly announced
his agency was organizing a formal search-for-ideas program called
the Space Exploration Initiative.
   He named retired Air Force Lt. Gen. Thomas P. Stafford, a former
astronaut who has four times flown in space, including a trip
around the moon. The plan calls for Stafford's group to study the
ideas after they've been cleared by Rand.
   Truly said his outreach program ``will leave no stone unturned
to reach out the best and brightest in our nation.'' That includes
even a phone call to 800-677-7796.

<HEAD>World Markets Edgy Over U.S. Grain Prospects</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign countries that rely on imports of corn
and other coarse grains are getting edgy about the global supply
and price outlook for the year ahead, an Agriculture Department
analysis says.
   ``While the outlook for the 1990 world wheat crop continues to
be generally favorable, heavy rains across the major corn-growing
areas of the United States have delayed corn planting,'' the report
said Wednesday.
   As a result, it added, this is ``causing concern in the
marketplace about prospects for the 1990 U.S. crop and _ because of
the United States' dominance _ the world's coarse grain price
outlook as well.''
   In addition, analysts said there has been ``rather strong
late-season import demand'' for coarse grains that ``will result in
a large drawdown in world coarse grain stocks'' during the
remainder of the 1989-90 season.
   On Tuesday, the USDA projected 1990 corn production at 8.1
billion bushels, up from 7.53 billion harvested last year. Despite
the increase in production, total exports and domestic use are even
larger, meaning that the nation's stockpile will dwindle further in
1990-91.
   Also, the projections are highly tentative and were based on
yield trends and planting indications derived from March surveys.
Wet weather, however, has delayed planting this spring and has
prompted concern about reduced yields and acreages.
   The department's first official corn estimate will not be
released until Aug. 9, along with prospects for soybeans, sorghum,
cotton and other 1990 spring-planted crops.
   Looking further at the global coarse grain situation, which
includes sorghum, barley and rye as well as corn, the report said
``shifting trade patterns'' are beginning to affect the outlook for
the 1990-91 marketing year.
   ``Crop shortfalls, especially in Brazil, are already influencing
import patterns,'' it said. ``In addition, foreign exportable
supplies will be limited until new-crop output is available for
export.''
   Thus, it said, there will be continued greater reliance on the
United States for coarse grain, particularly as the 1990 crops
develop.
   According to the projections, corn prices at the farm may
average in the range of $2.35 to $2.75 per bushel in the 1990-91
marketing year that will begin Sept. 1. Prices in the current
season are forecast to average $2.35 to $2.40 per bushel.

   Five researchers have been inducted into the
Agriculture Department's science hall of fame.
   The five were recognized this week by the Agricultural Research
Service, the department's chief scientific agency. To be eligible
for the hall of fame, scientists must either be retired or eligible
to retire and to have gained recognitions by national and
international colleagues for their work.
   R. Dean Plowman, administrator of the agency, said the
achievements of the five ``are worthy of being emulated by younger
agricultural scientists.''
   The five new inductees included:
   _Retired biologist Theodore C. Byerly, who died May 17, for his
investigations of how nutrition, genetics and the environment
affect the hatching of chicken eggs. His findings helped boost the
hatching rate to 85 percent from 65 percent.
   His studies were based at the agency's Beltsville, Md., research
center until 1963 when he left for a series of high-level USDA
administrative posts.
   _Retired geneticist Gordon E. Dickerson, who was responsible for
developing major concepts and methods to genetically improve
productivity in cattle, sheep, swine and poultry.
   Before retiring in 1987, Dickerson worked at the Roman L. Hruska
Meat Animal Research Center in Clay Center, Neb.
   _Chemist Robert W. Holley, who won the 1968 Nobel Prize in
physiology and medicine. He discovered the class of ribonucleic
acids now known as transfer RNA, one of the essential building
blocks in the body's instruction system for the production of
protein.
   Holley's work for the agency was based at the Plant, Soil and
Nutrition Laboratory in Ithaca, N.Y. He is now with the Salk
Institute in San Diego.
   _Wheat researcher Virgil A. Johnson, co-developer of 28 improved
wheat varieties that have set new standards of productivity for
hard red winter wheat. Varieties that he worked on have, at times,
made up as much as 25 percent of the total U.S. wheat acreage.
   Before retiring in 1986, Johnson worked at the agency's Wheat
Research Unit in Lincoln, Neb.
   _Corn researcher George F. Sprague, whose integration of
theoretical quantitative genetics and applied plant breeding led
him to develop methods that have resulted in the production of
superior corn hybrids.
   Sprague was leader of the Corn and Sorghum Investigations
Laboratory at the Beltsville center before he retired in 1973.

   Public comment is being sought on an
Agriculture Department proposal to allow salty whey to be covered
by federal whey standards.
   Salty whey is the moisture removed from cheese curd through a
salting process. The standards would apply to whey after the salt
is removed.
   Daniel D. Haley, administrator of the department's Agricultural
Marketing Service, said Wednesday that current rules allow U.S.
grading only on whey that originates as saltless.
   At present, salty whey represents a small amount of the total
whey that results from cheesemaking and is discarded because it is
so salty, he said. But new technology can economically remove the
salt from salted whey.
   Dried and condensed whey are significant sources of vitamins and
protein for humans and are used to some extent in animal feed,
Haley said.
   Comments on the proposal can be sent by Aug. 13 to: Director,
Dairy Division, AMS, USDA, Room 2968-S, P.O. Box 96456, Washington,
D.C. 20090-6456. Copies of the proposal are available from that
office, or telephone 202-447-4392.

   A cat owner whose pet was bashed to

   Michael Wood, 34, and John Zeros, 33, were arraigned Wednesday
on charges of maliciously destroying an animal belonging to someone
else. The offense carries up to four years in prison. They were
released on $3,000 bond.
   Hegler, who wasn't charged, said his two friends were at his
house Firday.
   ``One guy was petting the cat and it scratched him. The cat was
thrown and it stunned the cat,'' he said. ``I called out her name _
`Killer!' I don't think they understood what I said.''

yourself and make a change,'' the first lady said, quoting a line
from a Michael Jackson song, at the graduation ceremony Wednesday
at Dunbar High School.
   She proffered much the same advice about the importance of
family, joie de vivre and altruism that she gave the graduates of
Wellesley College in a nationally televised address June 1.
   But if some seniors at that exclusive women's college had
misgivings about whether President Bush's homemaker wife was a
suitable role model, the 287 Dunbar graduates gathered in
Constitution Hall seemed thrilled to hear from her.
   Senior class president Michael Watts said he was ``proud that
such an outstanding lady, and the first lady of our nation, cares
so much to take the time to encourage, motivate and demonstrate to
us that we can better ourselves.''
   Dunbar once was a showcase school for the District of Columbia's
brightest black students in an era of official segregation. Today
it is a regular public school in a crime-ridden neighborhood.
   Mrs. Bush read from the roster of such famous graduates as blood
plasma pioneer Dr. Charles Drew and Brig. Gen. Benjamin O. Davis
and called Dunbar ``one of the most illustrious high schools in the
country.''
   She urged the graduates to ``believe in something bigger than
yourself. Get involved in some of the big ideas of our time,'' such
as cleaning up the environment or fighting hunger and homelessness.
   ``The most important role model you will ever have is the man or
the woman in the mirror,'' she said. ``If you think you can't, you
won't. And if you think you can, you will.''
   She reminded the graduates that life is ``supposed to be fun.
Find the joy in life.''
   And finally, as she told Wellesley graduates, she admonished the
Dunbar students to put family ahead of career.
   ``However important your obligations as a doctor, a lawyer, or
business leader will be, you are a son or a daughter first, a
husband or a wife first, a mother or a father first,'' she said.
``If you decide to have children, love them, listen to them, put
them first.''
   Mrs. Bush also was the commencement speaker at Southeast
Community College in Cumberland, Ky., the University of
Pennsylvania and St. Louis University last month, and she spoke at
Kennebunk High School near her summer home in Maine last Sunday.

<HEAD>Two Horses, One Rear End, Two Politicians</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   It was a rare sight on Capitol Hill: a
Hungarian teaching a Texan about horses.
   It started when Rep. Tom Lantos, a Hungarian-born Democrat from
California, used a Hungarian proverb to illustrate to Secretary of
State James A. Baker III why the United States should stop its
dialogue with the Palestine Liberation Organization.
   Unfortunately, it backfired.
   ``It seems to me that there comes a point where we cannot square
the circle, and our desire to continue the dialogue (with the PLO)
and our desire to live up to our own commitments and fight
terrorism conflict,'' Lantos said at a hearing of the House Foreign
Affairs Committee.
   The United States has threatened to cut off the dialogue begun
in 1988 because of a thwarted attack by a PLO faction on an Israeli
beach May 30.
   ``As an old Hungarian proverb says, `You can't ride two horses
with one rear end.' And I believe that that's really what we have
been attempting to do for some time. And if you think about it,
that's an awkward posture,'' Lantos said.
   ``I've never seen two horses with only one rear end,'' responded
Baker, a Houston lawyer-turned-politician.
   ``No, riding _ the rider has to have one rear end,'' Lantos
tried to explain.
   ``I understand,'' said Baker, laughing.
   But Lantos wasn't sure.
   ``Two separate horses, one rider,'' he insisted.
   ``I understand. One rear end. I was only ...'' Baker said before
being interrupted.
   ``OK, I just want to be sure.''

   The White House says Moscow's easing of
economic pressure on Lithuania is a positive step but doesn't go
far enough.
   ``It's better than doing nothing,'' presidential spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater said. ``It's not the ultimate objective.''
   Even so, the administration clearly was pleased by an
announcement Wednesday that the Kremlin would restore 15 percent of
Lithuania's natural gas supplies. The fuel and other raw materials
were cut off April 18 to pressure Lithuania to abandon its drive to
secede from the Soviet Union.
   The crisis over Lithuania has emerged as a major stumbling block
in U.S.-Soviet relations. Bush has called on the Soviet Union to
lift the sanctions and conduct a dialogue with leaders of
Lithuania, as well as the other Baltic republics of Estonia and
Latvia.
   Bush told a news conference it was ``good news'' that Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev had met Tuesday with the leaders of
three Baltic states.
   ``I hope that what we saw ... is a first step in a dialogue that
will lead to the self-determination that we strongly support,'' he
said.
   The president did not comment on the easing of the economic
sanctions, but his national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft,
said, ``It's encouraging.''
   On Capitol Hill, Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell,
D-Maine, said, ``I am hopeful that the Soviet Union will lift its
economic blockade against Lithuania and I welcome Soviet steps
toward that end. Both sides should exert every effort to ensure
that negotiations are conducted in an equitable and respectful
manner.''
   However, Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., said: ``I think 15
percent is a slap in the face; you're trifling with people. The
embargo remains in place.''
   Fitzwater said the administration still wants a full lifting of
the embargo.
   ``Our role is to nurture this process toward a dialogue that
will result in self-determination,'' he said. Fitzwater said the
easing of the embargo was a positive step. ``How significant it is,
we don't know. It may not be a big step.''
   Lithuanian officials said Moscow offered to lift the embargo
only if they agreed to stop implementing the March 11 declaration
of independence for the duration of negotiations over the future of
the Lithuania.
   At his news conference, Bush said the United States hopes for a
``peaceful resolution of this confrontation, one that will result
in dialogue, negotiation ... in lifting of this economic blockade
against Lithuania.''
   Referring to Gorbachev's meeting with the Baltic leaders, he
said, ``I don't want to overstate it, but I was very, very pleased
to see this occur in the wake of ... what I think was a successful
summit meeting.''
   The reporters, representing newspapers outside of Washington,
also quizzed Bush on several other subjects, including offshore oil
drilling and the fate of the northern spotted owl.
   Bush said his long-delayed decision on restricting oil drilling
off the coasts of Florida and California would be made within days.
   He said he wanted to make sure he had all the information he
needs. ``We're still getting opinions,'' the president said. ``It's
a very hot item, as you know.''
   Bush said protection of the northern spotted owl under the
Endangered Species Act left him ``very much concerned about the
potential loss of jobs.''
   Vast tracts of forest in the Pacific Northwest would be shut to
timber operations if the owl is deemed endangered, and Bush said
the law gives the administration ``very limited control'' in making
such a determination.
   On another subject, the president said the Soviet Union should
stop subsidizing the government of Cuba, which he said receives $5
billion a year.
   ``If that totalitarian and brutal society were not propped up by
an enormous subsidy from the Soviet Union, I have every reason to
believe that Cuban people would have a right to achieve the freedom
that other countries have achieved,'' he said.

<HEAD>Music Industry Seeking to Head Off Sales of Improved Recorders</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAY ARNOLD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Composers and publishers are making a
last-ditch effort in Congress to ban U.S. sale of tape recorders
that can make near-perfect copies of musical recordings.
   With foreign manufacturers poised to introduce so-called digital
audio tape _ or DAT _ recorders this summer, a group of music
publishers, writers and composers urged a Senate panel Wednesday to
reject legislation that would allow the machines to be sold if they
incorporated anti-copying technology.
   The bill before the Senate Commerce communications subcommittee,
sponsored by Sen. Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz., would require
manufacturers to install computer-chip technology called a Serial
Copy Management System on DAT machines. This system would allow a
user to copy a compact disc onto as many digital audio tapes as
desired, but the tapes could not be copied.
   The bill is based upon an agreement reached in Athens last year
between manufacturers and record companies. But songwriters and
composers, who like musicians earn a percentage of the price of
each recording sold in stores, complained that their interests were
disregarded.
   The artists believe the virtually perfect copying ability of DAT
machines will make them more popular than today's relatively
inferior tape recording systems that use ``analog'' technology to
duplicate sound waves. Digital taping use the 0s and 1s of computer
language to re-create sound.
   Artists claim the bill for the first time would legalize home
copying _ a gray area of copyright law that Congress increasingly
is being pressed to resolve through legislation.
   George David Weiss, representing the Copyright Coalition, said
the bill ``forces songwriters to give away copies of our music
without payment of any kind.''
   Manufacturers say these claims are unfounded and that home
taping actually stimulates record sales.
   However, the artists found sympathy Wednesday from several
subcommittee members, including the panel's chairman, Sen. Daniel
Inouye, D-Hawaii.
   ``The time has come for the people who create to get a piece of
the action,'' Inouye said.
   A move for quick passage of the Senate DAT bill hit another snag
Wednesday when a recording industry executive said he wanted to
hold talks with manufacturers on a new technology called ``digital
compact cassette.''
   The new compact cassette machines from Philips Consumer
Electronics will record and play both digital and analog tapes.
   Jay Berman, president of the Recording Industry Association of
America, said the Philips machine had not been discussed in Athens
and he wanted to talk to manufacturers about it.
   He suggested an amendment to the Senate bill that would allow
the commerce secretary to bring such new technology under the
proposed DAT law.
   Berman said 380 million blank tapes are sold in this country
each year and that home taping costs record companies at least $1
billion in lost sales annually. But he said Japanese manufacturers
oppose a royalty system for copying.
   Ralph Oman, U.S. register of copyrights, told the hearing that
because of the unresolved issues on DAT, ``It is questionable
whether it will ever be mass produced.''
   Edward Murphy, president of the National Music Publishers
Association, said the coalition had asked Commerce Secretary Robert
Mosbacher and U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills to ``look at
the DAT problem.''
   He also said the coalition still was considering suing to block
imports of DAT machines.

   A House vote on a proposed constitutional
amendment to ban flag burning is likely to be close, even though a
powerful subcommittee is recommending against tampering with the
Bill of Rights.
   ``I don't want to see it change and become America, the land of
the free as long as you agree _ that loses me,'' Rep. Pat
Schroeder, D-Colo., said Wednesday as the plan emerged with an
``adverse'' recommendation from the House Judiciary subcommittee on
constitutional and civil rights.
   Supporters said the flag deserves special protection. It
``represents all that America stands for, embodies all that
American means,'' Rep. Craig James, R-Fla., told the subcommittee.
   The panel voted 5-3 to send the proposed amendment to the
Judiciary Committee with an ``adverse'' recommendation.
   The ``adverse'' label is guaranteed to have little or no impact
as the measure races toward the floor where both sides say the real
decision will be made.
   Five subcommittee Democrats, all critics of the amendment, voted
in favor of sending it forward with the ``adverse'' recommendation.
Three Republicans voted against, because they wanted a
``favorable'' recommendation.
   Plans call for a House floor vote as soon as the amendment
clears the Judiciary Committee, perhaps as early as next week.
   Both sides say the vote is likely to be close.
   House Speaker Thomas Foley, D-Wash., says he plans to break
custom and participate in the vote. Aides said Wednesday that in
the year he has been speaker he has voted only once, on Nov. 16 for
a governmental ethics bill.
   ``As much as I deplore and decry flag burning, much as I am
alienated and annoyed and repulsed by it as are other Americans,
this is not a time when we should rush to tamper with the most
sacred political document of our country's tradition,'' Foley told
reporters on Tuesday.
   Supporters are openly threatening to use this fall's campaign
season to bombard critics with television ads in a rerun of the
flag-waving politics of the 1988 presidential campaign.
   To become part of the Constitution, the measure would have to
win two-thirds majorities in both houses and approval in 38 state
legislatures.
   Retired Supreme Court Chief Justice Warren E. Burger, who has
cautioned against amending the Constitution, declined to give
advice to his former colleagues or anyone else on the subject as he
appeared with Barbara Bush on the White House lawn along with
students who won a poster contest honoring the Constitution.
   ``Retired justices shouldn't have any thoughts as to what
present justices should do,'' Burger said.
   The proposed amendment will not come under Senate scrutiny until
June 21 when Judiciary Chairman Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del., plans
a hearing.
   ``I don't think its going to be an overwhelming vote, but we
will get the two-thirds,'' said Rep. James Sensenbrenner, R-Wis.
Subcommittee Chairman Don Edwards, D-Calif., a leading opponent of
the amendment, merely said it would be ``very close.''
   The amendment would allow the federal government and the states
to pass laws outlawing desecration of the flag.
   The Supreme Court on Monday threw out last year's statute
barring flag mutilation, saying it violated the right to free
speech.
   Edwards was asked if Democratic critics were hurrying the
measure to the floor to head off lobbying campaigns by supporters.
   ``We ought to get it behind us so we can go on with the
country's business,'' he replied.
   Edwards told of passing out copies of the Constitution to
students in Prague recently and how eagerly those young people
snatched up the document.
   ``I hate to think that I'd have to stand before the same
students and say, yes, here's the Bill of Rights, but we've just
weakened it, we've just mutilated it,'' Edwards said.

<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When the saints come marching in, Southern
Baptist evangelists hope a few Bourbon Street regulars will be
among them.
   The blue-suited evangelists who have been attending a convention
by day descended into the notorious French Quarter at night
Wednesday to distribute Bibles and religious tracts outside such
places as Le Booze Bar and The Orgy.
   ``I was here eight years ago, and Bourbon Street was still
Bourbon Street. Not one thing has changed,'' said Glen Harlin of
Odessa, Texas. ``Our witnessing may not have an effect on the
atmosphere of this part of the city _ this street _ but it will
affect the individuals we reached.''
   The more than 40,000 Southern Baptists in the city for their
annual meeting this week have proved to be a mixed blessing.
   Bar owners, for example, were singing the blues.
   ``I think they ought to go back to where they belong,'' said
C.W. Williams, as he stood idle in one of the doorway bars along
Bourbon Street. ``It's the worst week I've had since December.''
   Tourism officials said the Baptists nevertheless are filling
hotel rooms and restaurants during a traditionally slow period.
   ``They might not be the highest ticket items, but they're
certainly a boost at this time of year,'' said Beverly Gianna,
spokeswoman for the Greater New Orleans Tourist Commission. ``We
love them anyway.''
   So do those assigned to keep the peace in the French Quarter.
   John Laine, a security guard, said things are a lot quieter on
Bourbon Street since the Baptists came to town.
   ``It makes things a lot easier for us,'' he said.
   Still, the scattered evangelists along Bourbon Street only
served as a reminder of the dismal business being done this week by
the strip joints and bars in what one Southern Baptist referred to
as ``the edge of hell.''
   Jim Monaghan, owner of Molly's at the Market, said he and other
bar owners would prefer a convention of auto dealers. ``We're
looking for two-fisted hard drinkers,'' he said.
   A woman who gave her name only as Bunny said a group of Baptists
insulted her and other dancers at the Bourbon Burlesque Club.
   ``I think they should stay out of our club,'' she said.
   Jay Strack, president of the Conference of Southern Baptist
Evangelists, said he was able to reach an amiable agreement with a
youth trying to con him into paying $30 for a shoeshine.
   ``I said, `Would you settle for $5 and I won't preach to you
more than 15 minutes?' He said, `It's a deal.'''
   Before he went to Bourbon Street on Wednesday, Strack challenged
thousands of church workers attending the Conference of Southern
Baptist Evangelists to distribute 10,000 New Testaments and
religious tracts on city streets.
   Strack, who said he was physically and sexually abused as a
child and once participated in the seamier side of life in the
French Quarter, said it is important for Baptists to evangelize in
such places.
   ``I think one of the things that's happening to a lot of
Southern Baptists is we're against those sins, but not against
those people,'' he said.
   Some doubted whether visiting religious groups such as the
Southern Baptists would have any lasting impact.
   ``They think they'll go down there and convert a few pimps and
prostitutes and drunken people, but they've done it before. And it
hasn't worked,'' said the Rev. Robert Fisher of St. Augustine
Catholic Church. ``And it probably won't work now.''

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Two huge flags were being unfurled in New York City and tiny
banners were being planted on lawns in a Minnesota town for Flag
Day today _ a practically forgotten holiday until the Supreme Court
helped stir affection for Old Glory.
   Shopkeepers reported flag sales are up as well since the high
court on Monday struck down a federal law against flag burning. The
ruling has spurred the drive for a constitutional amendment against
desecrating the flag.
   In Philadelphia, 14-year-old Katie Appelget was to read her
winning essay in the annual ``What the Flag Means'' contest. The
ceremony was sponsored by the museum and home of Betsy Ross, who
legend has it made the first Stars and Stripes.
   ``The American flag unites us all,'' wrote Katie. ``Even though
we may speak different dialects or come from different backgrounds,
we share one common element, the American flag.''
   Two 20-by-30-foot flags were to be hoisted today at the site of
the 1964 World's Fair in New York City, the first time flags of
that size have been flown since the fair.
   Later in the day, 100 newly arrived Soviet Jews were to be given
American flags and a boat ride past Ellis Island and the Statue of
Liberty, courtesy of a tourist boat company and the New York
Association for New Americans.
   In Northfield, Minn., some 25 workers at a realty planned to
place 3,000 plastic flags on residents' lawns. Broker Millie Berg
said city officials and police have given the go-ahead, but
flag-planters will skip the homes of two people who complained.
   Not everyone in the town of 10,000 was happy with the
``intrusive political statement,'' as resident Gloria Stier put it.
   In Omaha, Neb., merchants said flag sales have been booming
since the Supreme Court ruling.
   ``A lot of it has to do with the flag controversy,'' Paul
Cullen, sales manager at Cosgrave Church Goods, said Tuesday.
   Cullen said the store sold 40 flags in two days this week,
compared to just five on an average day. Although sales increase
around Memorial Day and the Fourth of July, he said, customers
usually forget about Flag Day.
   Buyers this year seem to be ``making a statement'' by buying
flags for Flag Day, said Dave Anderson, owner of Anderson Catholic
Supplies.

   Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. has gone from junk
bond king to junkyard dog.
   Once the envy of Wall Street, the investment house known for its
financial wizardry and hardball tactics came under the auctioneer's
gavel Wednesday in a sale of items from the corporate kitchen to
the CEO's rolltop desk.
   Lot 1, Power Shred model 410 paper shredder, went for $450.
Bidding was brisk.
   ``Now Drexel never had to shred any documents, so it's probably
never been used,'' motor-mouthed auctioneer Ross Dove said to
laughter from thousands of potential bidders at the Jacob K. Javits
Convention Center.
   The one-day auction included office furniture, brass coat racks,
stock trading desks, personal computers and other paraphernalia
from the firm, the epitome of American corporate finance in the
go-go 1980s.
   The auction, the first involving a Wall Street firm's leftovers,
was expected to raise a few million dollars _ a pittance compared
to Drexel's megadeals and megasalaries but money nonetheless for
hungry creditors.
   In a three-day preview, prospective buyers and curious others,
the sorts of people attracted to movie stars' funerals, wandered
through Drexel's deserted headquarters near Wall Street examining
items tagged for sale.
   ``Some of the conference rooms make you wonder why they didn't
go under sooner,'' said Michael Reilly, a systems developer at the
brokerage Murphy &amp; Durieu, who planned to bid on computer equipment.
   A framed bond from a $100 million New Jersey municipal offering
hung in one office, cardboard charts detailed a proposal to the
Idaho Power Authority, resumes were scattered on a desk.
   Cabinets bulged with files no one bothered to empty when the
firm went out of business in February.
   ``You could start a business picking through these files,'' said
Barry Newman, a real estate broker from Pawling, N.Y., who
videotaped choice pieces of furniture.
   Spooky reminders of the firm's ascent and fall were scattered
about. A Wall Street Journal dated Feb. 14 detailed the firm's
decision to file for bankruptcy court protection a day earlier.
   Two bound volumes of confidential documents from a big 1985
takeover sat in a conference room. They apparently belonged to top
Drexel dealmaker Leon Black, whose name was etched in gold leaf in
the lower right-hand corner.
   But most didn't care that Mike Milken May Have Sat Here. Some
knew only bits of the Drexel saga _ ``What was his name?
Mitchell?'' said J.C. Riemer, a video producer from Lebanon, N.J.,
who planned to bid on office furniture.
   ``I felt there was a certain amount of arrogance there,'' said
Linda Armani, whose market research firm was hoping to grab 10
personal computers. ``Everything was in fabulous shape. Meanwhile
the company was teetering.''
   More than 8,000 people registered to bid at the auction
conducted by Ross-Dove Co. of Foster City, Calif. Slides depicting
items on the block were projected on a big screen. A total of 4,022
lots were tagged.
   Still looking for the best deal, Drexel expects to make far more
at auction than by selling off its innards on its own. ``They'll
get a lot more money this way,'' said Ross Dove, chairman of the
auction house whose next sale is a $100 million piece of Arizona
land.
   Some prospective buyers were turned off by the escalating bids.
Joe Loiacono, a Brooklyn accountant, hoped to spend $1,500 on Lot
26 to furnish a six-person office. He dropped out long before the
winning bid of $3,500.
   ``There's no bargains here,'' Loiacono said, leaving the hall.
Then again, on Wall Street, Drexel never was known for giving away
something for nothing.

<HEAD>U.S. Would Discuss Final Settlement of World War II in Berlin</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Secretary of State James A Baker III wants to
discuss elements of a final settlement of World War II at a major
meeting in Berlin June 22, a State Department official says.
   Baker will meet with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze
and their counterparts from France, Britain and East and West
Germany.
   Raymond G.H. Seitz, assistant secretary for European affairs,
said at a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee hearing Wednesday that
Baker will not present a draft treaty.
   He said possible topics include ``the principles that will guide
the resolution of the borders issue of Germany _ part of that
affects the Polish question, of course.
   ``And secondly there will be an effort to at least have a
discussion of the elements that would make up a final settlement.''
   Poland is eager to have a reaffirmation of Germany's present
eastern border to forestall any future claim by a united Germany of
territory that is now Polish.
   Seitz said the United States wants to terminate the rights of
the four victors of World War II over Germany, such as their
occupation of Berlin.
   That would be part of the final settlement, he added.
   ``Our belief is that (the victors' rights) ought to be
terminated as quickly as possible and probably at the time of
German unification,'' he said.
   The United States would then recognize the unification though it
may not be legally necessary, he said, explaining that was because
the United States already recognizes West Germany as the successor
state to Adolf Hitler's Third Reich, which included both East and
West Germany.
   Earlier in the day Baker outlined to the full Foreign Affairs
Committee his ideas on a settlement.
   ``It would be counterproductive to perpetuate a special status
for Germany or to prolong any limitations on German sovereignty,''
he said.
   ``Discriminatory limitations could only sow the seeds for future
instability. For this reason we are opposed to using these
discussions to put limits on strictly German military
capabilities.''
   He added that limits could be discussed at different
negotiations at the same time as other ``confidence building
measures.'' Such measures are usually discussed at the Conference
on Security and Cooperation in Europe. They include advance notice
of military maneuvers, arrangements for foreign officers to observe
them and other ways to assure governments that they will not be the
victims of a surprise attack.
   Many Europeans see CSCE as the major security organization of
the future. It includes the United States, Canada, the Soviet Union
and 32 European governments. Seitz said that at its meeting in
Copenhagen, Denmark, last week the United States approved observer
status for Albania, the only European government which has not
joined.
   Seitz told the subcommittee that Baker would support making the
conference into an international organization with a permanent
headquarters. An aide told a reporter that Germans would like to
see the headquarters in Berlin, while Czechoslovaks are pushing for
their capital.

<HEAD>Democrats Likely to Oppose Bush Effort to Shield NASA From Cuts</HEAD>

   Congressional Democrats are likely to react
negatively if the Bush administration tries to use high-level
budget talks to help shield the space agency from spending cuts.
   Officials said Wednesday that the White House will ask
congressional negotiators at the talks to give special treatment to
the space program, which is one of President Bush's top domestic
priorities.
   But following the latest session of the bargaining on Wednesday,
Democrats said opposition was likely if the administration wants
its favorite programs singled out for protection from budget
slashes.
   ``We've had a lot of committee chairmen who say, `Hey, I want
mine''' protected as well, said Sen. Wyche Fowler, D-Ga., a budget
negotiator.
   Officials speaking on condition they not be identified said the
White House would propose that negotiators work out a specific
spending figure for next year's budget for the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration.
   In budget summits of past years, administration and
congressional officials agreed to a single spending amount covering
thousands of domestic programs, including NASA. The budgets for
individual agencies were then determined by Congress during the
regular legislative process.
   Bush would thus greatly enhance his role in determining NASA's
budget if it is negotiated directly between White House and
congressional negotiators.
   That would be important to the administration because Congress
does not want to increase the space agency's budget by as much as
the president would like.
   The administration's proposal to consider NASA separately would
also leave the thousands of remaining domestic programs vulnerable
to cuts that may be agreed to by budget bargainers. Negotiators are
looking for ways to shrink next year's federal deficit by $45
billion to $60 billion.
   In his budget for fiscal 1991, beginning Oct. 1, Bush proposed
giving NASA $15.2 billion, a 24 percent increase over this year's
$12.3 billion. That was the largest increase requested for any of
the government's major agencies.
   ``The exploration of space has benefits for the United States
that go far beyond the quantifiable,'' the president said in the
budget plan he presented in January.
   The Democratic-controlled Congress has been less generous with
the space agency.
   NASA would receive $14 billion next year under a spending
blueprint approved in May by the House. A separate plan developed
by the Senate Budget Committee last month would give the agency
$14.2 billion.

<HEAD>Logging Restriction Will Help U.S. Influence Abroad, Senator Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Senate-passed bill to restrict logging in
America's largest national forest will make the United States
better able to argue for protection of rain forests elsewhere in
the world, a leading sponsor says.
   ``No longer are we going to be embarrassed about what we're
doing in the Tongass,'' Sen. Timothy E. Wirth, D-Colo., said after
the Senate voted 99-0 Wednesday to approve the Tongass Timber
Reform Act.
   The bill would ban logging on more than 670,000 acres of
old-growth timber in the 17-million-acre Alaskan forest, which
besides being the largest U.S. forest is the largest remaining rain
forest in the temperate zone.
   The rain forest, larger than West Virginia, shelters bald
eagles, grizzly bears and prime salmon-spawning grounds. But it
also sustains a logging industry that provides 3,400 jobs and
sustains 25 percent of the economy in southeastern Alaska, the
state's two senators argued.
   Sponsors say the bill was needed because too much timber was
being cut from the public land and taxpayers were receiving too
little in fees because of old exclusive contracts favorable to the
logging industry.
   Sens. Frank H. Murkowski and Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, said they
supported the Senate compromise version over a stricter version
passed by the House. The White House has also endorsed the Senate
bill, which must be reconciled with the House version in
negotiations.
   The vote came after senators set aside a disputed amendment that
would have required the U.S. Forest Service to trade mining rights
in the Greens Creek area of Admiralty Island in southeastern Alaska.
   The exchange with the native-Alaskan owned Sealaska Corp. would
have given the government other mining rights and land, including
the last 6,000 acres of old-growth timber on Admiralty Island.
   Under an agreement worked out among senators, the secretary of
agriculture will try to speed up negotiations on a voluntary land
and mining-rights trade. Also, the Senate Energy and Commerce
Committee will hold hearings beginning June 28 to determine if the
items to be traded are of comparable value.
   The Senate bill would modify rather than cancel two existing
timber sale contracts. Canceling the exclusive contracts with the
Alaska Pulp Co. and Louisiana Pacific-Ketchikan would require the
government to pay higher compensation payments to the two
companies, the Office of Management and Budget says.
   Besides setting aside protected areas and modifying the major
contracts, the Senate bill would eliminate a timber harvest quota
of 4.5 billion board feet each decade. Instead, the harvest will be
more actively managed by the Forest Service.
   Wirth and others argued that the current contract enabled the
two companies to cut only the highest grade timber and sell it at
below market prices.
   The bill also prohibits logging in so-called buffer zones along
spawning streams.

<HEAD>Bill Would Put New Limits on Loans to China</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A $15.8 billion foreign aid bill for the
coming year includes new penalties aimed at discouraging the World
Bank from making loans to China for anything other than basic human
needs.
   The House Appropriations foreign aid subcommittee approved the
sanctions on a voice vote late Wednesday, saying the United States
must hold back its share of any amount lent to China beginning this
year from whatever contributions it normally would make to the
world lender.
   U.S. contributions amount to about 20 percent of money the World
Bank lends, and the gesture underscored Congress' continuing
impatience over what it sees as an inadequate American response to
China's bloody crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators a year ago.
   ``This provides the bank some incentive not to go forward with
these loans,'' said Rep. Matthew McHugh, D-N.J., sponsor of the
amendment. ``If they disregard it, inevitably we are going to be
talking about heavier punishment next year.''
   Two weeks ago, the World Bank approved a $300 million loan for a
tree-planting program, the largest approved since the crackdown in
and around Tiananmen Square. That brought the total of loans
approved for China since the massacre to $440 million.
   The overall foreign aid bill for the fiscal year that begins
Oct. 1 seeks to begin what subcommittee Chairman David Obey,
D-Wis., called an adjustment of foreign aid to new world realities.
It would shift some $200 million from funds the administration had
sought for military aid to support the political and economic
reforms in Eastern Europe.
   Rep. Mickey Edwards, R-Okla., sought and failed to boost the
military aid total from $3.8 billion to $4.1 billion to bring it
closer to this year's $4.25 billion and to the nearly $5 billion
sought by President Bush.
   ``The threat to the West is not from Soviet tanks,'' Obey argued
in a vehement rebuttal, but from the possibility that Soviet
President Mikhail Gorbachev's reform efforts could fail. ``The
world has changed,'' he said.
   For Eastern Europe, the bill would provide $430 million for
economic development of countries undergoing the transition to
market economies, and $70 million for the European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development.
   The bank contribution would be made contingent on forgiveness of
what Obey termed uncollectable debts owed by Poland to foreign
creditors, primarily in West Germany.
   The subcommittee also moved to grant to Pakistan another
one-year waiver of a requirement that it refrain from developing
nuclear weapons in order to be eligible for U.S. aid. But even
Pakistan's supporters abandoned what one lawmaker called a
long-running charade that the weapons do not exist.
   Rather than contend that Pakistan does not possess nuclear
weapons, as supporters have in the past, Rep. Charles Wilson,
D-Texas, argued that the country has not detonated one.
   The bill also includes a provision that would withhold half of
El Salvador's expected $85 million in military aid and make further
cuts or release of the withheld amount dependent on the progress of
peace talks between the government and the leftist rebels who have
waged a 10-year civil war.
   That provision was seen primarily as an incentive for the Bush
administration to resume discussions with congressional Democrats
aimed at finding a new bipartisan policy toward El Salvador, where
70,000 have died in the decade of fighting.
   The bill also would reduce the aid now flowing to Turkey and
Greece to $400 million and $280 million, respectively. Turkey is
getting $500 million this year, and Greece $350 million.

   Peter Elchaar and Karen Hopwood can be
forgiven for wanting a couple of quiet nights at home.
   In less than 48 hours, they have survived a plane crash and
found themselves in the middle of a high-speed car chase.
   ``I think we've had enough excitement for one week,'' said
Elchaar, 25.
   On Tuesday, they were among five passengers in a light plane
that lost power at 7,000 feet and plunged into a swamp. No one was
injured.
   So they went to visit friends on Wednesday night to describe
their miraculous escape. Driving home at 2 a.m., they found
themselves behind a speeding stolen car and in front of a pursuing
police cruiser.
   As Elchaar pulled over to get out of the officers' way, the
driver of the stolen car dodged traffic, skidded on wet pavement
and veered across several lanes to make a turn.
   ``He nearly collected us,'' said Ms. Hopwood, 20.
   The stolen car stopped shortly afterward, and police arrested
the 19-year-old driver.

   Throughout the city the smell of
burned paint mixed with the odor of gasoline fumes, recalling a day
and night of violent clashes between police and anti-government
protesters.
   The streets were no longer so crowded.
   Still, about 400 pro-government demonstrators, just as many
soldiers and police occupied Victory Square in front of government
headquarters early today.
   They had responded to a call by President-elect Ion Iliescu to
protect the building _ and were backed by armored personnel
carriers.
   Government supporter Alexandru Nicolae was diverting cars from
the square, much the same way people did during the December
revolution that toppled Nicolae Ceausescu. He said his people had
to be very careful.
   ``We apprehended someone who was about to set the cars parked
here on fire and shouted `Death to Communists.' Is this
democracy?,'' he asked.
   Dan Iosif, a leader of Iliescu's ruling National Salvation
Front, announced over a loudspeaker that workers would come from
various counties, including 27 trainloads of miners, to protect the
government.
   The square was rather quiet.
   Not so at television headquarers, where cordons of soldiers
blocked the entrance and ambulances went in and out, taking injured
people to the hospital.
   ``They provoked us and we planned not to answer back. But when
they hurt our colonel we could not take it any more,'' said a
steel-helmeted soldier at the gate.
   At a different part of the station, about 200 demonstrators
threw stones and firebombs. The protesters accuse state television
of biased programming and have demanded that an independent station
be established.
   Someone poured water down from the upper floors to keep the fire
under control. But the demonstrators persisted, and every time a
bottle touched the wall or a window, the crowd gave a loud
``hurrah!''
   Later, the army advanced far enough to make the
firebomb-throwing impossible.
   The situation took a more dramatic turn at the devastated police
headquarters, where demonstrators threw firebombs at soldiers and
two tanks, which fired lengthy rounds to repel them.
   It was impossible to get too close to the building because of
the firing. Demonstrators had earlier ransacked the headquarters
and set it ablaze, along with cars and other vehicles parked nearby.
   Finally, it was back to University Square, where the violence
started before dawn Wednesday when police cleared a square where
anti-Communist demonstrators had held out and blocked traffic for
53 days.
   With the pro- and anti-government demonstrators scattered in
different parts of the capital, the square was very peaceful. Only
about 50 people were there, along with charred buses, trucks and
cars.
   Nearby streets looked like they had been through a civil war:
thousands of bits of shattered glass, tracks on the asphalt from
passing tanks, a big pool of blood on a boulevard, traces of
gasoline from the firebombs.
   Asked what the few people in the square thought they were going
to do next, Marian Falticeanu shrugged his shoulders. ``Let's wait
and see what the new morning brings,'' he said.

<HEAD>World War II Love Story Helps Soften ``Ugly Japanese'' Image</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENIS D. GRAY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BANGKOK Thailand (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   When Lt. Kobori of the Japanese Imperial
Army died in the arms of his pregnant Thai wife, blase teen-agers
and staid society matrons alike confessed to breaking down in tears.
   And millions of other Thais were left with images of the
Japanese very different from those they previously held: the
fanatical, samurai-style warriors of World War II or today's
aggressive economic leaders.
   Since January, the Thai public has become addicted to a
serialized TV drama called ``Khuu Kam,'' or ``Star-Crossed
Lovers.'' The series ended last weekend. Bangkok's notorious
traffic jams thinned when episodes were broadcast, and social
engagements often were canceled. Senior government officials have
reportedly cut meetings short in order not to miss the program.
   Fans wrote the producers, pleading for a change to the tragic
ending. Others proposed marriage to the stars.
   The series was based on a still enormously popular novel penned
by Vimol Siripaiboon in the late 1960s. It tells of a Japanese
officer who falls in love with a Thai college undergraduate during
World War II.
   Although Kobori carries his army sword even into the bedroom, he
is willing to do anything for his love, even neglect some of his
soldierly duties. Angsumalin, the Thai woman, hides her own strong
feelings for him out of Thai patriotism until the moment Kobori
dies in an Allied bombing raid.
   Thais already have seen the novel adapted twice on the screen
and twice for television.
   The popularity of the latest version has stemmed in large part
from the appeal of Tongchai McIntyre, one of Thailand's top pop
singers. The handsome son of a Thai mother and Scottish father put
in a soulful performance.
   Many Thais say the portrayal of the hero is an effective
antidote to the hard-edged image of Japanese in Thailand. Japanese
are resented by many Thais for their aggressive business dealings
and what Thais see as an attempt to gain an economic stranglehold
on the country.
   One Thai who has criticized aspects of Japanese behavior is
Mechai Viravaiyda, a leading development expert and former actor
who portrayed Kobori in the first adaptation in 1969.
   ``This is very, very good public relations for the Japanese,''
he said. ``But if you look at Kobori's character this type of
Japanese has yet to be born.''
   ``With Kobori's notions about the heart being more important
than flag and country, he would have been put in jail _ or at least
given a low-ranking job in a Japanese corporation,'' Mechai said.
   Some in the large Japanese community here agree that ``Khuu
Kam'' makes for some of the best public relations for Japanese in
years.
   But some have reportedly taken offense at a scene in which
Kobori releases an American prisoner of war, as well as depictions
of Japanese soldiers as lax and rude.
   Nonetheless, it is unlikely that such a basically sympathetic
portrayal would be featured in countries like South Korea, the
Philippines, Indonesia and other Asian countries which suffered at
the hands of the Japanese army in the last world war.
   Thailand's wartime experience was mixed. The Japanese army was
allowed to use Thai territory to invade neighboring Burma and in
1942 Bangkok declared war on the Allies.
   The Thai ambassador in Washington, however, refused to deliver
the declaration and started an anti-Japanese ``Free Thai''
movement. As the war drew to an end the Japanese in Thailand became
increasingly harsher, but many were unaffected.
   Some of Thailand's wealthiest families owe their fortunes to
dealings with the Japanese.
   Among most Thais today, ``Khuu Kam'' evokes emotion rather than
history.
   ``I've read the book several times and every time I have to
cry,'' said Pharadee Narkkarphunchiwan, an office administrator.
Her father, she said, was due to have an eye cataract operation but
postponed it so he could watch the final episode.

   The key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange edged up
Thursday, while the dollar closed lower against the Japanese yen.
   The dollar ended at 153.53 yen, down 1.02 yen from Wednesday's
close of 154.55 yen. It opened at 153.90 yen and ranged between
153.35 yen and 154.25 yen.
   The 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 296.34 points, or 0.92
percent, ending the day at 32,668.11. The index gained 49.46 points
Wednesday.
   Securities traders attributed the Nikkei index's gain to the
yen's strength against the dollar.
   ``Most participants were assured by the yen's rise, and some
investors made index-linked large-scale purchases,'' said Kozo
Hasunuma, a trader with Yamaichi Securities Co.
   But the strength waned as investors became cautious ahead of a
series of releases of U.S. economic indicators due later Thursday
and Friday, he said. Producer prices for May are scheduled to be
released later Thursday, with consumer prices for May and trade for
April due Friday.
   Currency dealers said the dollar's low opening followed its
weakness in New York overnight.
   Masato Hayashi, a Bank of Tokyo trader, said a rumor that the
Bank of Japan sold dollars in the Sydney market prompted selling of
the U.S. currency in Tokyo.
   Yuichi Tsuchiko, a dealer with Fuji Bank, said the dollar's
decline resulted from market players buying the yen in exchange for
the British pound to take profits on the pound's recent
appreciation.
   In bond dealings, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bond rose to 87.98 points from Wednesday's
close of 87.62. The yield fell to 6.975 percent from 7.05 percent.

   New or remodeled chemical plants will have to
meet tighter standards to cut the release of smog-producing
compounds under new Environmental Protection Agency rules.
   The agency also announced new requirements Wednesday for 1,400
hazardous waste treatment, storage and disposal facilities that
should cut emissions by 76 percent.
   The synthetic organic chemical industry will need to spend $38.5
million initially to comply with the new anti-smog rules, designed
to cut emissions by 30 percent and will bear an additional $21.6
million in annual costs, the agency said in a statement.
   The rules require use of ``best demonstrated technology'' for
air oxidation, distillation, and reactor processes involving
production of more than 200 chemicals.
   The EPA estimates the rules will reduce the emissions of
smog-forming volatile organic compounds by 58,000 tons per year on
equipment built or substantially modified since 1983.
   About 70 percent of the 3,300 plants likely to be affected by
the new rules are in Texas, Louisiana and New Jersey.
   The hazardous waste rules are supposed to cut emissions by about
28,000 tons per year from all affected installations, no matter
when built. Complying with the rules will cost the industry $128
million to $151 million initially and then $33 million to $46
million per year, the EPA said.
   In many cities, waste treatment plants are major sources of air
pollution because chemicals stripped out of the sewage stream are
released into the atmosphere.

   A former U.S. Marine private who fled to
Canada after basic training has ended 21 years of self-exile and is
awaiting a decision on his fate.
   Ron Jacko, a Cleveland native who has lived in Toronto since
1969, turned himself Wednesday in at the Marine base in Quantico,
Va., said Capt. Betsy Sweatt.
   Jacko, 42, said he would ask the base commander, Lt. Gen. W.R.
Etnyre, to allow him to avoid a court-martial and leave the Marine
Corps with an ``other-than-honorable discharge.''
   If Etnyre grants that request, Jacko could be free in a few
weeks, Sweatt said. ``Every case is handled individually,'' the
spokeswoman said.
   In the meantime, the Marines will check Jacko's background to
make sure no other charges are pending against him.
   He will not be imprisoned but will be confined to the base,
living in a barracks with other privates.
   ``He'll be treated as any other Marine PFC,'' Sweatt said.
``He'll be in what's called a casual status. He can see his
civilian lawyer any time he needs to and a military lawyer will
also be assigned to assist him.''
   Returned deserters are no novelty at Quantico. ``We average
about three a week,'' she said.

for me to serve you, and God, in other ways.
   Therefore, tonight I'm announcing that Marion Barry would not be
a candidate for re-election for my fourth term. ...
   I'm proud to say to you tonight with the grace of God, and a
good treatment program, today is my 145th day clean of any
chemicals. For some, that's a short time. For those of us in the
recovery community, it's a long time. I continue to try to keep
this achievement _ one day at a time.
   In terms of my decision, I know many of you probably feel that
my decision not to seek re-election is the wrong thing for me to
do. But I hope that you will let go of your strong feelings and
believe that my announcement tonight is the best thing for me
personally, best for my family _ that is, my wife and son _ but
also for my beloved city that I respect so deeply.
   I prayed on this. And I think it's the best decision.
   Let me say to you in strong terms, this decision is not related
to my legal situation. It is related to my recovery and to what I
know is best for my wife and son, who've suffered so long in this
ordeal. ...
   The candidates who've announced for political offices in the
district, particularly those who are running for mayor, have not
been able to address the issues to the full time and attention of
you all, because of the distraction that my personal situation has
caused.
   I want to assure you though, that even though I'm not seeking
re-election, I'm not abandoning my commitment to the city. I've not
forsaken you. I've been reminded over and over that God is not
through with me yet. And in my heart I believe it's time for me to
serve God and you in other ways.

<HEAD>Dollar Falls, Nikkei Edges Higher</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar plunged against the Japanese yen today
after rising for more than two weeks, while the key index on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange edged higher.
   The dollar closed at 153.53 yen, down 1.02 yen from Wednesday's
154.55-yen finish. It opened at 153.90 yen and ranged between
153.35 yen and 154.25 yen.
   Since May 28, it had climbed on 11 of 12 trading days, gaining a
total of 5.10 yen before today's fall.
   The dollar opened lower in Tokyo after an overnight decline in
New York, and fell further on a rumor that the Australian and
Japanese central banks had intervened in the Sydney market by
selling dollars, dealers said.
   Toru Kanai, a foreign exchange analyst with New Japan Securities
Co., said the dollar continued to fall in the afternoon as trading
houses sold the currency at around 153.50 yen.
   ``But the currency did not fall much further because many
participants picked it up around 153.40 yen,'' he said.
   ``Market players are basically inclined to sell the dollar
because they think U.S. economic growth has been slowing. But
participants are waiting to see a series of economic figures coming
out later today and Friday,'' Kanai said.
   The United States was to announce its May wholesale price index
later today, followed by the May consumer price index and April
trade figures on Friday.
   About $15.9 billion changed hands in spot trading, up from
Wednesday's $10.6 billion.
   The 225-share Nikkei Stock Average climbed 296.34 points, or
0.92 percent, closing at 32,668.11. The index rose 49.46 points the
previous day.
   Traders said share prices were higher across the board.
   ``The Nikkei's increase was largely due to the yen's strength
against the dollar, which reassured market players,'' said a trader
with Nomura Securities Co., speaking on condition of anonymity.
   But some market players remained on the sidelines to await the
U.S. economic indicators, he added.
   First section volume was estimated at 450 million shares,
unchanged from the previous day.
   In bond dealings, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds rose to 88.09 points at 5 p.m. (4 a.m.
EDT) from Wednesday's 87.62-point close. The yield fell to 6.955
percent from 7.050 percent.

<HEAD>Smashed Car of Quake Freeway Collapse Survivor to Be in Museum</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUENA PARK, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Believe it or not, Ripley's plans to
feature in its new museum the smashed car in which a 57-year-old
man survived for 89 hours in the rubble of an earthquake-flattened
Oakland freeway.
   Buck Helm, the burly Oakland longshoreman who survived without
food or water, was rescued on Oct. 21 but died less than a month
later of respiratory failure.
   Ripley's Believe It Or Not said Wednesday that displaying the
smashed Chevy Sprint at its new Buena Park museum would be a
tribute to Helm's heroism. The museum opens in August.
   Dubbed ``Lucky Bucky,'' Helm gave hope to weary rescuers and
came to symbolize human indomitability, said Edward Meyers, vice
president for exhibits and archives for Ripley Entertainment Inc.
in Toronto.
   ``That's the whole angle, a memorial to the will to survive, one
man's heroism amid widespread devastation,'' he said.
   Helm's car will be displayed amid twisted metal bars and actual
pieces of the freeway to offer a sense of what it was like in the
tiny pocket of rubble, Meyers said.
   Until two weeks ago, Helm's car had been stored with 55 other
vehicles towed from the fallen freeway at an auto yard in East
Oakland.
   Helm's ex-wife, Lorrie Helm, donated the car to Ripley's in
December. She said she she hoped the exhibit would be a reminder of
nature's fury and of the alleged faulty construction that led to
the freeway collapse.
   ``Because of Buck and all the people who died, there should be
something out there to remind us that it could happen again,'' she
said.
   The quake that struck Northern California on Oct. 17 had a
magnitude of 7.1 on the Richter scale, killed 67 people and caused
an estimated $7 billion in damage.

<HEAD>Fighting Reported Fierce As Latest Bid For Talks Fails</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PATRICK CRUEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Government troops backed by helicopter
gunships, artillery and thousands of reinforcements fought fierce
battles with Tamil rebels today in the embattled north and east,
witnesses and officials said.
   The government's latest bid to end the fighting collapsed when
rebel leaders said they were unwilling to come to the strife-torn
eastern town of Batticaloa for talks, said Deputy Defense Minister
Ranjan Wijeratne.
   Defense Secretary Gen. Cyril Ranatunge told a news conference
that government troops were launching aerial attacks against the
rebels in Batticaloa.
   ``In such a situation there should be civilian casualties,'' he
said.
   So far, at least 90 government troops, rebels and civilians are
believed to have died in four days of fighting, the worst violence
since negotiations began between the government and the dominant
rebel Tiger militia in May 1989.
   One unconfirmed report said Tiger rebels also killed 125 to 150
policemen who were among 600 officers captured by the Tigers when
they overran 11 police stations Monday.
   The bloodshed has raised the specter of a return to the all-out
war between Tigers and government forces that prevailed before
India sent thousands of peacekeeping troops to Sri Lanka in July
1987.
   India withdrew its forces in March on Sri Lanka's request after
an unsuccessful 32-month effort to disarm the Tigers.
   Tamil rebels have been fighting for more political autonomy in
Sri Lanka since 1983. They claim they are discriminated against by
the majority Sinhalese. Tamils form 18 percent of Sri Lanka's 16
million people, while Sinhalese make up 75 percent.
   Today, residents of Vavuniya, 135 miles north of Colombo, said
Tamil Tiger rebels continued their seige on police stations in the
east and northwest. Vavuniya was the only northern town reachable
by telephone from Colombo.
   Residents said government troops using helicopter gunships,
artillery and reinforcements were repulsing attacks by the rebels.
   They said the rebels lost at least 15 men in an abortive attack
on the Kilinochchi garrison, 45 miles north of Vavuniya. Two
defending soldiers were also killed.
   Wijeratne described the fighting as ``fierce'' but said that did
not mean the government had ``closed the doors on negotiations.''
   Still, the prospect for a quick settlement appeared bleak. A
cease-fire announced Tuesday night for Wednesday was ignored. And
the government has rushed about 4,500 fresh troops to the region.
   Wijeratne said that while President Ranasinghe Premadasa hoped
to resolve the problem through discussions, military steps were
being taken to protect lives and government property.
   He said he was confident government troops would defeat the
Tigers if war again broke out.
   The Tigers took virtual control of the northeastern districts
after Indian peacekeeping forces withdrew.
   At least 11,000 people, including 1,200 Indian soldiers, have
been killed in the Tamil war since it started in 1983. Another
6,000 have been killed since 1987 in a backlash to Tamil demands
whipped up by ultranationalist Sinhalese guerrillas.

   Storms rumbled through the Midwest and northern Great Plains
today, while much of the rest of the nation enjoyed fair weather.
   Today's forecast called for thunderstorms over Michigan,
Illinois and Missouri, and rain and storms stretching from Idaho
and Nevada into Nebraska and South Dakota.
   Storms and high winds raced across Illinois on Wednesday,
damaging several small planes at Rockford's airport, downing trees
and damaging roofs.
   Temperatures rose above 80 degrees in most areas east of the
Rockies, with readings in the 90s as far north as Illinois and
Indiana. In the desert Southwest and in parts of Texas, the mercury
edged above 100.
   The high for the nation was 105 at Phoenix.

<DATELINE>ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government said today that the
fundamentalist Islamic opposition has won a clear majority of seats
in Algeria's municipal and provincial elections.
   The fundamentalist victory in the country's first multiparty
elections since independence from France in 1962 was the first
outright election victory for an Islamic fundamentalist party in
any Arab country.
   In neighboring Tunisia and Morocco, which have refused to
recognize the fundamentalists as political parties, leaders
expressed fears that the apparent success of extremism in Algeria
would eventually affect all the countries of northern Africa.
   In France, the ruling Socialist Party called the fundamentalist
victory ``cause for deep concern.'' It cited the fact that numerous
women had their right to vote ``confiscated'' by their fathers or
husbands.
   Under the Islamic family code, men can vote on behalf of their
wives or daughters without their permission.
   Sheikh Abassi Madani, president of the victorious Islamic
Liberation Front, thanked the Algerian people and government
Wednesday for the ``high level of political maturity'' that made
his victory in Tuesday's voting possible.
   He demanded the dissolution of the National People's Assembly,
to be followed by legislative elections. But he stopped short of
asking for the resignation of President Chadli Bendjedid.
   National elections are now scheduled for February 1992. The
government had no immediate response to Abassi Madani's demand.
   The ruling National Liberation Front, for 28 years Algeria's
only political party, had been widely expected to win because of
its grip on government machinery and the media, as well as its
greater financial resources. It holds every seat in Parliament.
   But the official Algerian News Agency said today that with a
third of the official results tabulated _ including those from most
of the large cities _ the 16-month-old Islamic Salvation Front had
won by absolute or relative majorities.
   Earlier, Interior Minister Mohamed Salah Mohamedi told reporters
the fundamentalists had won 327 seats of the first 612 races
tabulated. The ruling party was running second with 208 seats.
   The French news agency Agence France-Presse, citing sources,
said the fundamentalists captured councils in Algeria's four
largest cities _ Algiers, Oran, Constantine and Annaba _ and swept
45 of the 48 provincial councils.
   Final official results were expected this evening.
   Abassi Madani dismissed as ``incidental'' the decision of two of
Algeria's major political parties to call for a boycott of the
elections.
   However, it was the boycott by former President Ahmed Ben
Bella's Movement for Democracy in Algeria and Berber leader Ait
Ahmed's Front of Socialist Forces that made the fundamentalist
victory possible.
   The average total of abstentions was above 45 percent, the
highest in any Algerian election since the end of colonial rule. In
the Kabylie region which is Ait Ahmed's homeland, average voter
participation was less than 15 percent.
   The parties urged the boycott because they feared the balloting
was rigged in favor of the ruling party. They also objected to the
short period of time they were given to prepare for the ballot.
   The boycott ``weighed heavily in the (Islamic fundamentalist)
victory,'' the state news agency said.
   Officials of all parties complained Wednesday of widespread
irregularities, including multiple voting, missing ballots and
interference at polling places by outsiders and election officials.
   It was not clear exactly what the impact of the fundamentalist
victory would be in Algeria, a country of 24 million.
   Politically, most major decisions are made by the central
government _ local councils cannot, for example, impose Islamic law
on a local basis.
   But the victory clearly has emboldened the fundamentalists, who
are now likely to operate as a government-in-waiting and expect
their demands will be taken seriously.
   Socially, the victory is likely to make Algerians concentrate
more on the issue of what kind of society they want.
Non-fundamentalists are likely to realize they will need to become
more active and organized if they want stop the fundamentalists'
advance.
   Abassi Madani, a 59-year-old philosophy professor, denied his
movement wishes to turn the country into a one-party religious
state. ``We guarantee the freedom of all who have ideas on
Algeria's future,'' he said.
   The Islamic Salvation Front seeks to establish the Islamic legal
code, the Sharia, as law. The party assigns women to a subservient
role. None of the front's 12,000 candidates for office in Tuesday's
voting were women.
   For months, fundamentalist supporters have been accused of
harassing single women and disrupting nightclubs in Algiers.
   The party boasts 650,000 members. Many are drawn from the ranks
of unemployed youth, who are attracted by the party's fiery mix of
Islam and politics.
   The National Liberation Front was the sole political party until
constitutional changes in February 1989 opened the way to competing
parties.
   The party was forced to end its monopoly on power after soldiers
killed scores of people in October 1988 riots sparked by
deteriorating economic conditions.

   Bernadette Locke has been named an
assistant men's basketball coach at the University of Kentucky, the
first woman to hold such a post in a major collegiate sports
program.
   Locke, 31, has been an assistant coach of the women's basketball
team at the University of Georgia since 1985. She was the
university's first female All-American in 1980-81.
   Kentucky head coach Rick Pitino said Wednesday that Locke's
duties would be the same as those of his other assistants but that
she would have special emphasis on career placement.
   ``After today I'm part of the team and I want to be treated like
the other coaches,'' Locke said.
   Mary Fenlon was an assistant for the men's basketball team at
Georgetown University, but ``her purview was the academic side of
things,'' said Georgetown spokesman Bill Shapland.
   Pitino said he expects no problems involving Locke's access to
the locker room.
   ``There are a lot of men's coaches in women's sports today,'' he
said. ``As soon as they shower up, they're in the locker room.
Before the game it's no problem because they're all dressed.''

<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 4 grafs for 3rd pvs, `Conservative lawmaker...' to

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House of Commons early today approved
legislation to allow 50,000 heads of households from Hong Kong and
their families to enter Britain when the colony is handed back to
China in 1997.
   Some members of the Conservative Party fought their government's
proposal, saying it would flood the country with Hong Kong refugees.
   In Beijing, the Chinese government reiterated its objection to
the plan.
   ``The Chinese government has repeatedly expressed its just and
solemn position and demands with regard to this question,'' Foreign
Ministry spokeswoman Li Jinhua said at a weekly briefing.
   ``Now the British side still is pursuing its plans to change the
citizenship of some Chinese citizens in Hong Kong. The British side
will be held responsible for all the consequences arising
therefrom,'' she said without elaborating.
   In London, Conservative lawmaker Tony Marlow said the household
heads and their families could total 250,000 people of different
culture and ethnic background. He said the government's duty was to
put Britain first.
   Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd has said he wants key people to
remain in Hong Kong after Chinese rule. He says the best way to
achieve that is to guarantee them a British passport so they know
they can always leave.
   The House passed the bill by a voice vote, sending it for
consideration to the House of Lords, the non-elected upper chamber
of Parliament.
   The Lords can approve the bill, amend it with the Commons'
approval or reject it. Rejection, which is unusual, would probably
result in the government trying to reintroduce the proposal with a
new bill.
   Under an agreement with Britain, the colony on China's
southeastern coast reverts to Chinese rule in 1997. China has
pledged to retain Hong Kong's capitalistic and legal systems for 50
years after the takeover, but fear has mounted in the territory
that Beijing may renege on its promises.
   Those fears grew deeper after the Chinese government's bloody
crackdown on the pro-democracy movement in Beijing one year ago, in
which troops killed hundreds of unarmed civilians.
   Former Conservative Party chairman Norman Tebbit led opposition
to the bill and tried with other Tories to persuade legislators to
reduce the number of immigrants from Hong Kong.
   Labor legislators opposed the bill on opposite grounds, calling
it elitist and divisive.

<TEXT>
   The Coast Guard has tentatively approved
the experimental use of oil-eating bacteria on the spill from the
supertanker Mega Borg.
   State officials had suggested the approach and discussed it
Wednesday with the Environmental Protection Agency, Coast Guard and
other agencies.
   ``It's worth a try. Anything we can do to clean up the spill,
we'll try,'' Coast Guard Capt. Thomas Greene said. He said,
however, he did not consider the technique a major part of the
cleanup, which also involves skimmers, booms and chemical
dispersants.
   As the federal on-scene coordinator, he asked state officials to
submit a plan today on how they will conduct the test without
interfering with the salvage efforts in the Gulf of Mexico.
   The process, called bioremediation, uses naturally occurring
bacteria to reduce oil to an emulsion of fatty acids. This emulsion
sinks and is consumed by marine life.
   Bioremediation has been used for years to clean up hazardous
waste sites, treat sewage and wastewater, extract oil from tight
geologic formations and clean some rocks on shore after the Exxon
Valdez accident in Alaska last year, said Texas Land Commissioner
Garry Mauro.
   But this will be the first time bioremediation has been used in
the water to clean up an oil spill, he said.
   ``Now we have the chance to put to real use innovation and new
technology that can provide all of us with a means to avoid the
potential environmental devastation of an oil spill,'' Mauro said.
   Greene said the Coast Guard would provide a boat to scientists
to apply the sandlike bacteria to the oil slick.
   B.J. ``Buck'' Wynne III, chairman of the Texas Water Commission,
said he expected to mix the bacteria in 100-gallon tanks of salt
water and shoot it through hoses from a Coast Guard cutter.
   Wynne and Mauro suggested using 100 pounds of the bacteria a day
for three to four days on freshly spilled oil near the vessel. The
test will cost the state about $50,000, Mauro said.

<TEXT>
   Capt. Dick Tracy of the Chicago Police
Department loved the movie. But he couldn't solve the crime.
   ``I suspected somebody else,'' said Tracy after watching the
movie ``Dick Tracy.'' Judging from the gasps from the audience,
very few people suspected the culprit.
   Tracy _ yes, that's really his name _ was among 500 guests at a
preview of the movie here Wednesday night. Woodstock was the home
of Chester Gould, who created the Dick Tracy comic strip. The movie
opens nationally Friday.
   ``It was great,'' said Tracy, who at 56 is just two years
younger than the comic strip. ``It had an interesting plot, lots of
action, the scenes were uniquely done.''
   Others agreed.
   ``It was fabulous,'' said Woodstock resident Betty Hamilton. ``I
was never a Dick Tracy fan, but now I am. I'm going to go back and
read all the comic books.''
   ``The cinematography is phenomenal and Madonna is great,'' said
Bob Billimack, a real estate broker from Woodstock.
   Guests paid $100 each for seats at the Woodstock Opera House.
Proceeds will benefit the Chester Gould Memorial Library, a museum
planned to commemorate the late cartoonist and his famous
characters like 88 Keys, Mumbles, Breathless and Pruneface.
   Black-haired, steely-eyed Dick Tracy first appeared during the
Depression, the first comic strip to deviate from the ``funnies''
approach and venture into graphic violence.
   Gould created _ and knocked off _ enough bad guys and really bad
guys for Woodstock and the whole country.
   ``I told myself, `I'm gonna draw a guy that shoots them,'''
Gould said before his death at age 84 in 1985. ``It was kind of
nice to have a cop who would shoot first and ask questions later.''
   There's plenty of shooting in this fast-paced, rock 'em sock 'em
Walt Disney movie, but it's not graphic enough to jeopardize the PG
rating. On the other hand, Madonna, playing the sultry speakeasy
singer Breathless, has some racy scenes that probably wouldn't make
the comic pages of a family newspaper.
   Capt. Tracy, a 34-year veteran officer, said the ``flirtatious''
scenes were important.
   ``The fact that Dick Tracy didn't succumb to that is part of the
movie. Warren Beatty played the role the way we would like to
imagine police were in that time. At least Dick Tracy wasn't
wearing an earring,'' Tracy said, alluding to two Peotone, Ill.,
police officers disciplined recently.
   ``Besides, Madonna was in town and unfortunately, she didn't
crawl around on my desk like that,'' Tracy said, laughing.
   The movie culminated a week of Dick Tracy Days in this town 50
miles northwest of Chicago.
   Disney officials were adamant that the real premiere, with
stars, 3,000 invited journalists and all, is today at Florida's
Walt Disney World.
   But Woodstock Mayor Jim Shoemaker said that showing won't be the
same. ``You'll see brighter red carpet, bigger celebrities, fancier
limousines,'' he told Jean O'Connell, Gould's daughter, who planned
to travel to Orlando for the premiere.
   ``The one thing that Orlando's not going to have is 14,000
people who loved your dad. Dick Tracy, you're finally home,''
Shoemaker said, his voice choking with emotion.

   A bride-to-be whose fiance got cold feet
has decided to hold the reception anyway _ and invite the homeless.
   Kathleen Gooley, 41, said she stood to lose the caterer's $4,000
non-refundable deposit when her husband-to-be backed out of the
June 23 wedding.
   ``The money is tied up anyway,'' she said. ``Why not give it to

   Her best friend and would-be maid of honor, Rinda Farnham,
contacted homeless shelters and drug rehabilitation clinics. So

   ``I hope we can make people who are less fortunate have a nice

<HEAD>Minister Denies Blaming Low Birthrate on Educated Women</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A highly influential Cabinet minister is denying he
blamed Japan's plunging birthrate on the higher educational levels
being reached by women, news reports and government officials said.
   The alleged remark received extensive news coverage, and one
women's leader said Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto had no
understanding of the concept of equality between women and men.
   Hashimoto was quoted as telling a Cabinet meeting Tuesday that
Japanese women are having fewer babies in part because more are
receiving higher educations.
   Hashimoto acknowledged Wednesday that he had called for a review
of education policies in view of the dropping birthrate, but denied
having singled out women's educational levels, Kyodo News Service
reported.
   ``I am afraid we will not be able to discuss this matter
seriously now,'' it quoted him as saying.
   A senior administration official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the government ``has no intention of denying the
need for a high academic level for women.''
   The comments appeared intended to head off further criticism of
the reported remarks by Hashimoto, a powerful figure in the
governing Liberal Democratic Party and a likely future candidate
for prime minister.
   Liberal Democrats remember the so-called ``madonna boom'' in
last year's upper house elections. Women voters, dissatisfied with
a series of governing party bribery and sex scandals, propelled a
record number of opposition women candidates into office.
   Last week, a government report said only 1.25 million babies
were born last year and the average Japanese woman had only 1.57
children, the lowest levels since statistics were first compiled in
1899.
   Cabinet members reportedly expressed worry that a lower
birthrate would result in a smaller work force, unable to support
Japan's growing number of older people.
   Hashimoto reportedly was quoted by several Cabinet ministers,
including Health and Welfare Minister Yuji Tsushima, as having
questioned whether all young people needed higher education, and
adding that ``women's higher education may also be related to the
matter.''
   But a Health and Welfare Ministry official denied today that
Tsushima had reported such a comment by Hashimoto.
   Another Cabinet minister, Management and Coordination Agency
head Jun Shiozaki, said he had misunderstood and therefore
misstated Hashimoto's remarks.
   ``Hashimoto has no understanding of the concept of equality
between women and men,'' said Aiko Carter, secretary of the Women's
Committee of the National Christian Council of Japan.
   ``He hasn't learned the real lesson of last year's election.
Women are advancing in society, and it's the men who can't keep
up.''
   In 1925, the average Japanese woman gave birth to 5.1 children.
The birth rate has dropped since as population pressures have
compressed housing space, average marriage ages have risen, costs
of educating and raising children have climbed and fewer people
depend on children for support in old age.
   In 1989, 24.5 percent of 847,153 male high school graduates
entered universities and 36.7 percent of 853,636 female high school
graduates entered two-year or four-year colleges, the Education
Ministry says.

   A Seventh-day Adventist pastor set a
fire that destroyed his 60-year-old church in a scheme to collect
insurance money for remodeling, authorities said.
   Paul Bray Jr., 32, was booked for investigation of arson
Wednesday and held on $10,000 bail after he admitted starting the
gasoline fire Sunday morning, authorities said.
   ``He apparently planned to burn only a portion of the church,
but it got away from him,'' Assistant Fire Chief Keith Marshall
said.
   The pastor turned himself in after investigators told him he was
a suspect.
   ``He seemed happy to be confessing,'' Inspector Pete Tokarski
said.
   The blaze caused an estimated $1 million damage to the wooden
church, where Bray had been pastor for three years.

   A woman who falsely accused a man of raping
her has been ordered to run advertisements apologizing to him.
   District Judge John Murphy also sentenced Elizabeth Irene
Richardson to six months in jail for perjury.
   Ms. Richardson, 24, of Lexington is sorry about the incident and
will spend about $1,000 fulfilling the judge's order Friday that
she run half-page ads in each newspaper in the county and 10 radio
spots, said her attorney, Tod McKeone.
   Ms. Richardson told authorities she was raped in 1988 by a
painter who had visited her home inquiring about a job.
   Gary Nitsch, 44, of Overton was arrested several days later. Ms.
Richardson identified him from a police photo and later testified
he raped her.
   Charges against Nitsch were dropped in February after Ms.
Richardson admitted she made the accusation up to get attention
from her husband, Charles K. Kenning, a truck driver often away
from home.
   ``She was desperate to get him back and acted very impulsively
without giving consideration to the thing, and it kind of
snowballed on her,'' McKeone said Wednesday.
   Nitsch said Wednesday that although the judge is letting him
approve the wording of the ads, they won't make a difference.
   ``You can't change a wrong to a right. And I think the sentence
could have been stiffer,'' he said. ``I lost a job. I had to get a
lawyer. The kids at school were saying to my kids, `Your dad's a
rapist.'''
   Nitsch has sued four sheriff's deputies for $100,000, alleging
they arrested him and searched his home without sufficient cause.

<HEAD>Eleven-Year-Old Jewish Boy Stabbed In East Jerusalem</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Palestinian woman stabbed an 11-year-old
Jewish boy in the back today as he stood at a bus stop in Arab east
Jerusalem, police said.
   The attack came two days after a Palestinian stabbed a
17-year-old Jewish seminary student outside east Jerusalem's walled
Old City.
   The 11-year-old, identified as Idan Mizrahi, was being operated
on at Jerusalem's Hadassah Ein Karem Hospital, said police
spokesman Yitzhak Greif. Hospital officials said his life was
apparently not in danger.
   The stabbing occurred at the edge of the Jewish neighborhood of
East Talpiot in the Israeli-annexed eastern sector of the disputed
city.
   Nir Avrahami, 8, who witnessed the attack, said the Palestinian
woman, dressed in jeans and a white shirt, was also waiting at the
bus stop.
   ``I saw her take out a knife and saw her stabbing him (Idan) in
a downward direction,'' Avrahami said on Israel's army radio.
   Police said the suspect ran toward the nearby Arab neighborhood
of Tzur Baher. Police cordoned off the Arab neighborhood and
conducted searches.
   In other developments, a military prosecutor on Wednesday
ordered that three soldiers and a civilian army employee be charged
with assault and brutality in the beating of a Western news agency
photographer.
   The prosecutor, Lt. Col. Rachel Dolev, also said four other
soldiers would face disciplinary action in the March 22 attack on
Havakuk Levinson of the Reuters news agency.
   The incident occurred near the West Bank town of Ramallah after
a bus carrying soldiers and civilian army employees was stoned.
Some passengers got off the bus and started chasing suspects, Dolev
wrote in her decision.
   Levinson witnessed the chase and photographed a soldier as he
led away a Palestinian youth, the prosecutor said.
   ``One of the soldiers charged Levinson and kicked him to the
ground. The other soldiers assaulted him and tried to take his
camera away,'' Dolev wrote.
   A reporter from Israel radio who witnessed the event said at the
time soldiers beat and kicked Levinson as they shouted: ``You have
to kill all the journalists and then kill the Arabs.''

<HEAD>Terrorist Suspect Says Secret Police Let Her Live in East Germany</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A reputed West German terrorist told
investigators that East Germany's former secret police furnished
her with a phony identity and allowed her to live in the country,
officials said today.
   Susanne Albrecht, wanted in the 1977 shooting death of a top
West German banker, was arrested June 6 outside her apartment in
East Berlin.
   On Wednesday, officials arrested another reputed West German
terrorist, Inge Viett, who had been living in the East German city
of Magdeburg.
   Both women are linked to the left-wing Red Army Faction, which
has claimed responsibility for a string of bombings and killings of
prominent West German businessmen over the past two decades.
   Both women had been living in East Germany under assumed names.
   East German Interior Minister Peter-Michael Diestel told a news
conference today that Albrecht said she was set up with a new
identity by the feared Stasi secret police of the old Communist
regime.
   In a police statement, she said she was sent by the Red Army
Faction to live in East Germany in 1979 because she believed she
posed a security risk after the 1977 slaying of Dresdener Bank
President Juergen Ponto outside Frankfurt, West Germany.
   Diestel did not say whether Albrecht admitted a role in the
killing.
   She said she later met with a contact of the secret police in
the East German city of Frankfurt an der Oder, Diestel said.
   She said she was informed that the East German government
disapproved of the group's methods but agreed with its
anti-imperialist objectives, the interior minister said.
   Both Albrecht and Viett are being held pending expected
extradition proceedings to West Germany.

   The dollar dropped lower against key currencies in
European trading this morning.
   Gold prices plunged to the lowest level in four years before
rallying.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 153.53 yen, down 1.02 yen from
Wednesday's finish. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at
153.57.
   Other European dollar rates compared with late Wednesday:
   _1.6845 West German marks, down from 1.6925
   _1.4255 Swiss francs, down from 1.4335
   _5.6705 French francs, down from 5.6880
   _1.8945 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9045
   _1,237.00 Italian lire, down from 1,241.00
   _$1.1705 Canadian, down from $1.1722
   The British pound was quoted at $1.7133, up from $1.7070 late
Wednesday.
   Before today's fall, the dollar had gained 5.10 yen in Tokyo
since May 28.
   Toru Kanai, a foreign exchange analyst with New Japan Securities
Co., said the dollar found buyers at around 153.40 yen.
   ``Market players are basically inclined to sell the dollar
because they think U.S. economic growth has been slowing. But
participants are waiting to see a series of economic figures coming
out later today and Friday,'' Kanai said.
   Spot gold crashed through the psychological barrier of $350 an
ounce this morning, bottoming at $341.00 in early trading.
   At mid-morning, London's five major gold dealers fixed a
recommended price at the higher level of $346.75 per troy ounce
this morning, down from $350.15 a troy ounce late Wednesday.
   Gold traded at $346.00 per ounce in Zurich at 6 a.m. EDT, down
from $350.50 bid per troy ounce.
   In Hong Kong, gold dropped $4.36 an ounce today, to close at
$350.80.
   Some dealers said the biggest orders in the market were coming
from Middle East interests, most prominently commercial players in
Saudi Arabia. Arab selling was not confirmed, but analysts said
developments were in line with recent moves by Arab investors who
sold when gold was exposed at key technical points.
   Silver bullion traded late in London at a bid $4.90 a troy
ounce, down from $4.95 late Wednesday.

<TEXT>
   Israeli workers staged a general strike today
to press for a new wage agreement, paralyzing the country only
three days after the new right-wing government was installed.
   The job action by 900,000 of Israel's 1.5 million workers shut
down schools, banks, government offices, the airport and the stock
exchange. State-run Israel radio and television stayed off the air.
   Chaim Haberfeld, the No. 2 official in the Histadrut Trade Union
Federation, warned that job actions would continue if the one-day
strike did not lead to a quick wage agreement.
   ``I hope that this strike will produce some results. There is no
point in striking today and then doing nothing for several
months,'' Haberfeld said on Israel army radio.
   Finance Minister Yitzhak Modai had appealed to the Histadrut to
call off the strike, saying it would cost the economy up to $150
million, the radio report said.
   The strike was seen as a show of strength by the left-leaning
Labor Party, which controls the Histadrut and was relegated to the
opposition this week after Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir formed a
right-wing government.
   The strike, the first major job action in five years, was called
to press for new wage contracts for public sector employees and
workers in state-run companies.
   All government offices were closed, expect for the Finance
Ministry whose employees defied the strike order. Public
transportation operated, and shops in some areas were crowded with
workers using the day off to go shopping.

<TEXT>
   A plan that would cut logging by almost half in
Washington's largest national forest came under attack by
representatives of the timber industry, environmental and landowner
groups.
   The groups said they would appeal various aspects of the plan by
the U.S. Forest Service for the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National
Forest. It will determine logging rights there for the next 10 to
15 years.
   The plan revealed Wednesday is a major shift in favor of
recreation, and deals a ``very severe'' blow to the timber
industry, said Doug MacWilliams, supervisor of the forest.
   He told interest group representatives at a briefing the
proposed 46 percent reduction in timber harvesting would increase
retail lumber costs and affect 1,800 jobs.
   Although representatives of affected groups had not seen copies
of the complete plan, they said the would appeal. The plan was made
after 10 years of research and debate.
   It takes effect 90 days after publication Friday. The plan can
be appealed to the Forest Service.
   ``It's not the last action we'll take on this plan,''
MacWilliams said.
   Ted J. LaDoux, director of forestry affairs for Northwest
Independent Forest Manufacturers in Tacoma, said his group was
``very disappointed'' by the plan.
   ``By no means do we consider this a balanced plan,'' he said.
``What's more, they clearly ignored the public sentiment.''
   Ron D. Morgenthaler of Woodinville, chairman of the Public Land
Users Society, said he felt ``shock when I look at what it did to
landowners and public land users.''
   Both said they would appeal.
   Wilderness Society Director Jean Durning said the planners made
``great steps forward'' in addressing recreational concerns. But
greater logging reductions were needed, regardless of an expected
decision June 23 on the Northern spotted owl, which could further
reduce the timber harvest.
   Under the plan, about 95 percent of the roadless acreage would
remain intact and 97 percent of old growth trees would remain in
the year 2000.
   The plan also calls for construction of 220 miles of trails,
rebuilding of 493 miles and maintenance of 891.

<TEXT>
   Hanover, a West German industrial city seeking a
higher international profile, was chosen by a one-vote margin today
to be host of Expo 2000, an ecologically oriented turn-of-the
century world's fair.
   Hanover was selected by the Paris-based International Bureau of
Expositions in a 21-20 vote over Toronto, Canada, the only other
candidate after the Italian government decided to drop a campaign
on behalf of Venice.
   Hanover, a northern city of 500,000 known for an annual trade
fair, was considered a strong contender because many of the
exposition bureau's member countries have close economic ties to
West Germany.
   The bureau's 43 members, who vote by secret ballot, include 25
from Europe, 11 from the Western Hemisphere, four from Africa, two
from Asia and one from Australia. It was not known which two
members did not vote today.
   Toronto had argued that it was North America's turn, since the
next two fairs are in Europe _ Seville, Spain, in 1992 and
Vienna-Budapest in 1995.
   The bureau, formed in 1928, seeks to ensure that contending
cities have an appropriate site, adequate transit, government
backing and enough hotel rooms. The winning country then draws up
final plans and finds sponsors, financial and public support.
   Hanover was the first West German city to contend for the right
to host an officially sanctioned ``universal'' exposition _ the
largest type of event overseen by the bureau.
   The city has proposed a theme of ``Man, Nature, Technology'' for
the fair. The event is tentatively scheduled to run from June 1 to
Oct. 31, providing an estimated 70,000 new jobs in the region and
costing roughly $1 billion.
   In the past, some cities have backed out, as Moscow did in the
1960s, clearing the way for Canada to play host to its first fair
in Montreal.
   Late last year, Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney wrote to
the exposition bureau, extolling Toronto as ``a vibrant symbol of
excellence, tolerance, humanity and pluralism.''
   At that time, Venice was also in the running, but the Italian
government withdrew the candidacy earlier this week.
   Venetians, as well as the Italian government, were divided as to
whether the exposition's estimated 60,000 daily visitors would help
revive the canal city or create unmanageable environmental problems.

<TEXT>
   The partner of a Miami police officer convicted of
manslaughter in two deaths that sparked a race riot was charged
with lying during her testimony in the trial.
   Officer Dawn Campbell, 25, was relieved of duty with pay and
released on her own recognizance Wednesday after the Dade County
state attorney's office charged her with two felony counts of
perjury during a judicial proceeding.
   Each count is punishable by five years in prison and a $5,000
fine.
   Prosecutors were openly skeptical of Campbell's testimony last
November during the trial of Officer William Lozano, 31, who is
appealing a seven-year state prison sentence. He was dismissed
earlier this year.
   Lozano has said the perjury charges were filed to hurt his
appeal.
   Campbell allegedly changed her version about the night Lozano
fatally shot a speeding motorcyclist, who crashed. The crash killed
a passenger, and the deaths triggered three nights of racial
violence in January 1989.
   Lozano is a white officer born in Colombia, and the two victims
were black.
   Campbell testified she was standing in the street and did not
duck behind her patrol car when Lozano fired, an affidavit filed
with the arrest warrant said.
   Six other witnesses testified she was on the sidewalk and ducked
during the shooting, calling into question her view of the incident
and her conclusion that Lozano fired in self-defense.

Communists won the opening round of voting for Bulgaria's first
freely elected Parliament in more than five decades, according to
final results released today.
   The governing Socialist Party, formerly known as the Communist
Party, won the most seats in the 400-seat Parliament, defeating the
main opposition alliance in direct balloting for candidates and in
voting for parties.
   The Socialists won 172 of the 319 seats decided in last
weekend's first round voting, final results showed.
   Under Bulgaria's complex electoral law, half the seats are
distributed according to the percentage of votes each party
receives. The other half go to individual candidates elected by
direct ballot.
   The results mean the Socialist Party only needs to win 29 of 81
candidate races that will be decided in Sunday's runoff to capture
an absolute majority in the unicameral Grand National Assembly, or
Parliament.
   Bulgaria was the only country in the disintegrating Soviet bloc
where the Communists, who changed their party's name in April,
remained the strongest political force.
   The Socialist Party gained 47 percent of the proportionally
distributed votes for 97 of the 200 seats contested among the
parties, Zhivko Stalev, head of the Central Electoral Commission,
told reporters. The main opposition Union of Democratic Forces was
a distant second with 36 percent or 75 seats.
   Finishing third was the mainstream Agrarian Party with 8 percent
and thus 16 seats, and fourth was the mostly ethnic-Turkish
Movement for Rights and Freedoms with 6 percent and 12 seats, he
said.
   Despite recurrent charges of alleged manipulation and other
irregularities, Union of Democratic Forces leaders accepted the
returns in principle.
   When the Socialist victory was first signaled by projections
earlier this week, anti-Communist and Union of Democratic Forces
protesters blocked traffic in Sofia, claiming the election was
rigged.
   However, a majority of Western observers said Monday that the
balloting process was essentially fair, although some of them
pinpointed individual cases of infringement of the rules.

<HEAD>Lithuania Plans To Call Back Workers if Embargo Eases</HEAD>

   Lithuanian officials said today that more than
1,600 workers who were laid off at a fertilizer plant will be
called back to work if Moscow eases its embargo and steps up
natural gas supplies.
   Leaders of the Baltic republic's 3-month-old independence drive
said Wednesday that Moscow promised to restore 15 percent of
Lithuania's natural gas needs as the two sides tried to reach a
compromise. Moscow imposed a crippling embargo on many natural
resources after Lithuania declared independence.
   Also today, Lithuanians paused to mark 49 years since the
Soviets deported thousands of people to Siberia after seizing
control of the republic.
   Lithuanian Parliament spokeswoman Rita Dapkus said there was no
sign the additional gas was being provided today. However, ``Today
is not a working day,'' she said in reference to the memorial day.
   ``And I don't think something like that would be done overnight
anyway,'' she said in a telephone interview from the Lithuanian
capital, Vilnius.
   The promised supply of 122 million cubic feet of natural gas per
day, which will bring Lithuania back to about 30 percent of its
usual level, will allow a fertilizer plant to reopen and 1,650
workers to return to their jobs, she said.
   The Soviet Union cut off the republic's entire oil supply, most
of its natural gas and some raw materials in mid-April to try to
force the republic's leaders to back away from their March 11
independence declaration. The shortages have forced factories to
close, putting 26,000 people out of work.
   Ms. Dapkus said Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov on Wednesday told
his Lithuanian counterpart, Kazimiera Prunskiene, some gas would be
restored.
   Ryzhkov made no promises on restoring other supplies, Ms. Dapkus
said. But the official Soviet news agency Tass quoted Mrs.
Prunskiene as saying after meeting Ryzhkov in the Kremlin that the
embargo would probably be lifted.
   The conciliatory gesture came as Ryzhkov and Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev offered Lithuania a trade: cancellation of the
embargo and negotiations on independence if Lithuania agrees to
freeze the implementation of its independence drive during the
talks.
   Gorbachev ``is not insisting on this precise formula,'' his
spokesman, Arkady Maslennikov, told a news conference Wednesday.
   ``We are searching for critical solutions acceptable to all
sides without degrading the dignity of people who elected the
parliament that adopted those acts,'' Maslennikov said.
   Gorbachev and Ryzhkov met with the presidents of all three
Baltic states Tuesday and, significantly softening their stance on
secession, offered deals that would lead toward negotiations on the
republics' independence demands.
   In Washington, the White House applauded the moves toward
compromise. Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater called them
``positive steps.''
   U.S. lawmakers have suggested they would not approve a trade
pact signed during the superpower summit in Washington until
Gorbachev opens negotiations with the Baltic states and lifts the
economic embargo on Lithuania.
   The trade agreement is considered important to Gorbachev's
efforts to turn the ailing Soviet economy around.
   Estonian President Arnold Ruutel told his republic's parliament
the situation was ``far from euphoric'' but that ``a tremendous
change'' had taken place in the Soviet view of the secessionist
demands of the three Baltic states, the Estonian news agency ETA
reported.
   Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia were forcibly annexed by the
Soviet Union in 1940 and are seeking restored independence _
Lithuania most stridently.
   Ryzhkov favors having Lithuania remain part of the Soviet Union
under a new treaty granting the republic special status or
privileges, Ms. Dapkus said.
   Mrs. Prunskiene did not immediately respond to Ryzhkov's plan,
but the presidents of Latvia and Estonia were both reported on
Wednesday to have repeated their calls for full independence.
   On Tuesday, Gorbachev proposed the transformation of the Soviet
Union into a looser federation of more independent republics. The
Soviet leader is trying to keep together his huge, economically
troubled union of 15 republics with more than 100 nationalities and
289 million people.

   The much-touted benefits of lowering cholesterol
may be especially effective for people who already have heart
disease, according to a study published today.
   The findings, based on a 10-year research project, confirm the
widely held belief that people with low levels of cholesterol in
their blood are far less likely to die of heart disease than those
with high cholesterol.
   But the study in the New England Journal of Medicine also shows
that high cholesterol is especially dangerous when heart arteries
are already partially clogged with cholesterol buildups.
   The study was not intended to see what happens when people
change their cholesterol levels.
   The researchers wrote, however, that it suggests that ``the
potential impact of changes in lipid (cholesterol) levels on the
risk of death from cardiovascular disease may be considerably
greater for men with pre-existing cardiovascular disease than for
healthy men.''
   The analysis, based on the Lipid Research Clinics Prevalence
Study, was conducted by Dr. Juha Pekkanen and others from the
University of North Carolina.
   In the study, desirable cholesterol levels were under 200, while
high levels were over 240.

   A reporter who tried to take up a State
Department challenge for Israel to call the White House when it was
serious about peace was told today he had reached the wrong number.
   The sound of the White House phone ringing was played over the
Army Radio's morning news show. A woman operator answered: ``White
House.''
   The reporter, Yaacov Eilon, told her he was following up on a
statement by Secretary of State James A. Baker III on Wednesday
that Israeli leaders should phone the White House ``when you're
serious about this (peace talks).''
   But the the operator replied: ``You would have to call the State
Department. ... That number is 647-4000.''
   ``You mean he (Baker) made a mistake?'' Eilon asked.
   ``Yes sir,'' she responded.
   Baker made the challenge before the House Foreign Affairs
Committee. He hoped to persuade the Israelis to begin peace talks
with the Palestinians.

   The European Parliament today passed a
resolution urging European Community governments to maintain all
sanctions against South Africa until apartheid is abolished.
   The Parliament approved the measure 177-to-47 with 5
abstentions, a day after black nationalist leader Nelson Mandela
told them a lifting of sanctions would undermine his drive to end
South Africa's policy of racial separation.
   Mandela, deputy president of the African National Congress, is
on a six-week tour of Europe and North America, calling on
governments to maintain sanctions despite reforms adopted by South
African President F.W. de Klerk.
   Jean-Pierre Cot, leader of the Socialist group, the largest in
the assembly, told reporters after today's vote that ``Nelson
Mandela's message was heard by the Parliament.''
   The parliamentarians appealed to the 12 European Community
governments to continue ``all sanctions, including economic,
cultural and sporting sanctions ... until apartheid is completely
and irrevocably abolished.''
   The resolution also called on EC governments and the EC
Executive Commission to make more money available to South Africans
returning home from exile and for a ``negotiations trust fund'' to
support the democratic process.
   The Parliament's members are elected by voters in the 12
European Community nations but have little real power.
   In 1986, the EC banned imports of iron, steel and gold coins
from South Africa, then valued at $600 million a year.
   They also banned new investments in South Africa but did not
halt imports of South African coal, then valued at $1.3 billion a
year.
   Britain has lifted the ban on new investments after South Africa
in February freed Mandela, who spent 27 years in prison. The
71-year-old leader was convicted of sabotage and plotting to
overthrow the government.
   Mandela tours the United States from June 20 to July 1.

   Skeletons that Vietnamese refugees
said were those of 30 Americans killed in the Vietnam War were
handed over to the U.S. Embassy today, officials said.
   The bones were to be flown to Hawaii for tests, but embassy
officials said they did not know when that would happen.
   The bones, stuffed into seven barrels, were handed over to
Malaysian police by nine Vietnamese boat people who landed Monday
on the beach at Tanjung Sedili, 150 miles southeast of Kuala Lumpur.
   Red Cross officials said they sent the bones by truck to the
U.S. Embassy.
   The embassy's charge d'affaires, Paul Blakeburn, said earlier he
doubted the bones could be those of mising American servicemen, but
that only forensic tests in Hawaii could determine whether they
were.
   Other embassy officials said boat people previously claimed to
have bones of Americans, but the claims had been proved false.
   The Vietnamese brought along with the latest bones
identification tags bearing names and other details. They said they
were found on the skeletons.
   Police said the refugees hoped to get preferential treatment for
settlement in the United States for bringing the bones.
   U.S. Embassy press officer, Mary Ellen T. Gilroy, said no
preference would be given even if the bones turned out to be those
of Americans.
   Malaysian officials said the boat people would face the normal
screening process, under which those deemed to be fleeing politican
persecution are approved for resettlement in Western countries, and
those considered economic migrants face repatriation.
   The nine Vietnamese have been placed in a temporary refugee camp
in Mersing, near Tanjung Sedili. They were to be moved in the next
few days to the Pulau Bidong refugee camp, 180 miles northeast of
Kuala Lumpur, for screening.
   Malaysia accepts boat people only for temporary asylum. There
are about 20,000 Vietnamese refugees in Malaysian camps.
   Police said the refugees were on their way to Singapore to hand
in the skeletons to the U.S. Embassy there when their boat sprang a
leak. They were forced to land at Tanjung Sedili, about 60 miles
from Singapore.
   The Vietnamese had painted signs on the boat saying they were
carrying the remains of Americans.

   The Bush administration announced today it
will not impose economic sanctions on India for trade barriers the
United States deems offensive.
   U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills termed India's barriers to
investment by Americans and other foreigners and its exclusion of
U.S. insurance companies as an unreasonable burden on U.S. commerce.
   But she said that retaliation was inappropriate at this time
given ongoing global free trade talks. She said the administration
would try to resolve its dispute with India as part of those
discussions.
   Those discussions, being held under the auspices of the
96-nation General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, are due to wrap
up at the end of this year. India is considered a key participant
in these talks, known as the Uruguay Round, because of its
influence over other developing countries.
   Hills said India's announcement on May 31 that it would remove
some of its barriers to foreign investment was a hopeful sign.
   ``Our message that foreign investment brings jobs, technology
and prosperity may be getting through,'' Hills said. ``I hope this
attitude will be reflected in India's approach to these issues in
the Uruguay Round.''
   The administration's decision was relayed on Wednesday to Abid
Hussain, India's new ambassador to Washington.
   The administration faced a June 16 deadline to decide whether to
boost tariffs on Indian imports or impose other retaliatory trade
sanctions because of India's refusal to negotiate the dispute.
   The case against India involves that nation's barriers to
foreign investment and its refusal to allow American insurance
companies to do business in the country.
   India was one of three countries placed on a trade ``hit list''
last year by the administration for erecting the most offensive
trade barriers against American products.
   The other two countries, Japan and Brazil, both successfully
reached agreements with the United States to remove the offending
barriers. However, India has refused to negotiate under threat of
U.S. sanctions which are provided by a section of the 1988 trade
law known as Super 301.
   While the decision removes the possibility of economic
retaliation immediately, the administration in April renamed India
to a ``hit list'' for the current year, citing the same trade
barriers. The deadline for reaching a conclusion on that action
will not come until June 1991.
   The decision to cite only India in the second round of
negotiations and to leave Japan off the list triggered heavy
protests in Congress, where Japan's huge $49 billion trade surplus
with the United States has attracted attention.
   The administration contended that Japan had negotiated in good
faith to remove barriers to sales of American satellites,
supercomputers and wood products in Japan and therefore should not
be targeted again.
   The administration also pledged to press forward with separate
discussions on broad-ranging structural trade barriers with Japan.
Those discussions are focusing on such issues as increasing
penalties for anti-monopolistic practices, streamlining the
country's retail distribution procedures and making other changes
to expand opportunities for foreign businesses.
   There have been complaints in recent days that the talks with
Japan on structural impediments to trade had bogged down. A final
report on these talks is scheduled to be issued in July.

<HEAD>Cardinal Warns Catholic Politicians on Abortion Issue</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Roman Catholic politicians who support abortion
rights risk excommunication, warned New York's Cardinal John
O'Connor in this week's archdiocesan newspaper.
   ``Where Catholics are perceived not only as treating Church
teaching on abortion with contempt, but helping to multiply
abortions by advocating legislation supporting abortion, or by
making public funds available for abortion, bishops may decide ...
such Catholics must be warned that they are at risk of
excommunication,'' O'Connor wrote in a 12-page article on abortion.
   ``If such actions persist, bishops may consider excommunication
the only option,' he added in the publication, Catholic New York.
   O'Connor has discussed the excommunication of pro-choice
Catholic politicians in the past, but the newspaper article
appeared his strongest and clearest statement yet on the subject.
O'Connor is also the chairman of the U.S. bishops' Committee for
Pro-Life Activities.
   The statement appeared several days after the archdiocese
rescinded an invitation to Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., who is
Catholic, to speak at a Catholic high school graduation ceremony
because of his support for abortion rights.
   O'Connor also wrote that some bishops, hoping to avoid severe
penalties such as excommunication, are imposing lighter penalties
as a warning. He cited barring speakers from church events is one
such tactic.
   In his statement, the cardinal specifically criticized
politicians who have what he described as a ``personally opposed
to, but'' position on the issue.
   Some politicians, including Gov. Mario Cuomo, have said although
they personally oppose abortion, they support a woman's right to
make a choice.
   ``The `personally opposed' phrase says, in effect: `In public
life I will act indistinguishable from someone who sees abortion as
a positive social good, but please know that I will do so with
personal regret,'' the cardinal wrote.
   ``This agenda is hardly effective, since ... it serves the
agenda of those who actively favor abortion,'' he concluded.
   The actions of Catholic politicians, O'Connor wrote, ``should be
consistent with the faith and moral principles taught by the Church
in which they claim membership.''

   The U.S. Customs Service has called in a
survey team to help search for a possible second drug-smuggling
tunnel.
   U.S. and Mexican authorities last month raided a warehouse in
Douglas and a home in Agua Prieta, Mexico. They found a tunnel
which officials have said was used to smuggle drugs from Mexico
into the United States.
   The Customs Service received information about a possible second
tunnel from documents seized after the first tunnel was found, the
agency's hot line, and other means.
   In the search for a second tunnel, authorities raided a vacant
home in Douglas and an occupied home in Agua Prieta last week, but
found nothing.
   The team arrived late Wednesday and will use seismic equipment
to look for irregularities beneath the earth's surface at sites
officials think might contain another tunnel, Customs spokeswoman
Judy Turner said.

   A political party that fared
poorly in the nation's historic election suspended its chairman
today after he was accused of being a former secret police agent.
   The People's Party also declined to join the new coalition
government being formed by incumbent Premier Marian Calfa, a former
Communist.
   On the eve of the weekend election, aides to President Vaclav
Havel publicly accused People's Party Chairman Josef Bartoncik of
having worked for the recently disbanded secret police for the last
17 years.
   This is ``not a matter of trust, but a practical decision,''
said deputy People's Party chairman, Bohumil Svoboda. He indicated
the Bartoncik affair affected the party's election results.
   The People's Party, a former Communist ally that broke with the
Communists just before last winter's pro-democracy revolution, was
one of three in a Christian Democrat coalition that finished third
in last weekend's election.
   Jiri Cerny, party general secretary, said the election results
were ``some 10 percent below what we expected.''
   Havel's Civic Forum and its Slovak ally, Calfa's Public Against
Violence, won 170 of the 300 seats in Parliament, but fell short of
the three-fifths majority it needs to pass key constitutional
changes.
   Bartoncik's suspension will remain in force at least until the
party's national conference in September, People's Party officials
said.
   The party has failed to defend Bartoncik against the
allegations, but has attacked Havel for the way in which they were
made public.
   On June 5, Bartoncik was hospitalized, apparently suffering a
heart attack after a meeting with Havel at which he reportedly
promised the president he would resign because of his alleged
secret police links.
   The People's Party said he would probably be released from the
hospital within one or two weeks.
   Bartoncik was elected to Parliament in last weekend's vote. His
party said the legislature's immunity commission will decide
whether to remove his mandate.
   Cerny said the People's Party would not take part in Calfa's
coalition government because it had been offered too few posts.
   ``A party must have a guarantee that it will be able to
influence the decisions of the government'' if it takes part, he
said.
   On Tuesday, Jan Carnogursky, a leader of the Christian Democrats
in Slovakia, said his Slovak party would not participate in the new
government.

<HEAD>Court Limits Manufacturers in Giving Discounts in Texaco Case</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today barred manufacturers
from giving discounts to wholesalers and not to retailers when the
discounts are unrelated to any savings for the supplier or to the
wholesaler's costs.
   The court unanimously upheld a $1.35 million antitrust award
Texaco Inc. was ordered to pay to 12 service stations in the
Spokane, Wash., area.
   Justice John Paul Stevens, writing for the court, said there was
no evidence that Texaco's discounts ``constituted a reasonable
reimbursement for the value to Texaco of (the wholesalers')
marketing functions.''
   Texaco's appeal had been supported by leading business groups,
including the National Association of Manufacturers and the
American Petroleum Institute.
   They had said a defeat for Texaco could undermine ``the most
common distributional arrangement in American business: the dual
channel system in which a manufacturer or supplier sells to
wholesalers at discounted prices lower than those it charges direct
purchasing retailers.''
   But the court today said Texaco's discounts amounted to illegal
price discrimination barred by a federal antitrust law, the
Robinson-Patman Act.
   A federal jury ordered Texaco to pay $449,900, a sum that was
tripled by the judge to $1.35 million in accord with the act.
   The 12 service station dealers that sued said from 1972 to 1981
they were placed at an unfair competitive disadvantage because
Texaco supplied gasoline to two Spokane-area wholesalers, John
Dompier Oil Co. and Gull Oil Co., at discounts ranging from 2.5
cents to 5.75 cents per gallon less than Texaco charged the
retailers.
   Dompier sold the gasoline to other retailers under the Texaco
trademark. Gull marketed it under private brand names.
   The 12 service stations said they suffered because at least part
of the discounts were passed on to consumers by competing retailers
who bought from Dompier and Gull.
   Texaco argued that the discounts were legitimate since they were
available to all wholesalers who purchased from the oil comany
giant.
   Stevens today noted there was evidence the services offered by
Gull and Dompier were insubstantial and did not justify the
discount.
   For example, there was evidence that Gull's role as a middleman
amounted only to engaging in paper transactions and, in fact,
Texaco delivered gasoline directly to some of Dompier's customers.
   The case is Texaco vs. Hasbrouck, 87-2048.

<HEAD>Court Allows Administration to Limit Welfare Aid in Virginia Case</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court today allowed the Bush
administration to limit how much welfare aid some needy families
receive.
   By a 5-4 vote, the court said Social Security benefits paid to
children must be considered in determining a family's eligibility
for benefits under the government's Aid to Families with Dependent
Children (AFDC) program.
   The decision reversed a federal appeals court ruling in a
Virginia case last year that favored welfare families in a dispute
over how AFDC eligibility is to be determined.
   At issue was whether the first $50 in Social Security benefits
received by a family's children each month must be taken into
account when calculating the family's eligibility for AFDC benefits.
   The Richmond-based 4th U.S Circuit Court of Appeals said no.
Today, the Supreme Court said yes.
   Today's decision is a defeat for the Virginia welfare families
who had successfully challenged the Bush administration's
interpretation of the relevant law.
   The disputed welfare law language says participating states are
to ``disregard the first $50 of any child support payments.''
   Writing for the court today, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist
said Bush administration officials were correct in limiting that
language to payments from absent parents _ and not applying it to
Social Security benefits received by children.
   ``Congress used `child support' throughout (the relevant welfare
law) as a term of art referring exclusively to payments from absent
parents,'' Rehnquist said.
   He was joined by Justices Byron R. White, Sandra Day O'Connor,
Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy.
   Justices Harry A. Blackmun, William J. Brennan, Thurgood
Marshall and John Paul Stevens dissented.
   ``This crabbed interpretation of the statute is neither
compelled by its language nor consistent with its purpose,''
Blackmun wrote, ``and arbitrarily deprives certain families of a
modest but urgently needed welfare benefit.''
   Justice Department lawyers had told the court that the
$50-disregard provision, enacted in 1974, could cost $44 million
more each year in AFDC benefits if interpreted as the 4th Circuit
court had.
   The case is Sullivan vs. Stroop, 89-535.

<HEAD>Soviet Legislature Delays Increase in Bread Price</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAREY GOLDBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet legislature today delayed for at least
two months the government's plan for a controversial increase in
the price of bread, the main staple of the nation's diet.
   The Supreme Soviet, in a rebuff to the government of Premier
Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, said that plans to triple the price of bread in
stages starting July 1 would have to wait until September or later.
The vote was 319-33.
   Government officials had said the price increase would have
brought in $24 billion, but that all the money would be turned back
to Soviet consumers by other means. However, they acknowledged that
they had not fully worked out plans to turn the money back to them.
   The bread price increase was one of the most visible and
controversial parts of an economic program presented to the Supreme
Soviet by Ryzhkov last month. The program touched off panic buying
in Moscow and led the capital's government to require proof of
residence to make purchases.
   On Wednesday, the Supreme Soviet ordered the government to have
other elements of the plan to move toward a market economy ready by
October.
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has said that bread is so
cheap that children sometimes use a loaf for a soccer ball. In the
meantime, the country spends its hard currency reserves to buy
grain from foreign countries.
   One deputy complained after the vote that because producer
prices for grain already have been raised, keeping bread prices
constant would swell the government budget deficit by several
billion rubles.
   But the lawmakers, rushing toward a summer adjournment with a
slate of several other pieces of major legislation still pending,
voted against lowering the producer price again.
   The producer price increase is to provide farmers with an
additional $12.6 billion in an effort to improve agricultural
incentives.
   The government needed the Supreme Soviet's approval for the
price increases because of its 1989 pledge it would not raise
prices on any essential items throughout this year.

   Robert D. Blackwill, a senior foreign policy
adviser to President Bush, will return to Harvard University's John
F. Kennedy School of Government as a lecturer in late July, the
White House announced today.
   Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said that President Bush
``accepts his departure with great appreciation for his role in
shaping U.S. policy towards Europe in these dramatic times.''
   ``Bob was instrumental in the success of both Gorbachev summits
and in the president's many deliberations on NATO,'' the spokesman
said.
   Blackwill, 49, is senior director for European and Soviet
affairs in the office of the White House national security adviser.
   Fitzwater said no replacement has been selected yet.
   However, Condoleezza Rice, Blackwill's deputy and a top adviser
on Soviet affairs, is widely believed to be in line for the post.
   Blackwill is a former associate dean and faculty member at the
Kennedy School.

<TEXT>
   Scientists say they have made the most
detailed look at the center of the Milky Way galaxy and found what
appears to be a massive black hole gobbling up one star every 5,000
to 10,000 years.
   Computer-generated pictures released Wednesday at a American
Astronomical Society meeting show an object 1 million times the
size of the sun that seems to be spinning off what appears to be
clusters of gas, said Northwestern University astronomer Farhad
Yusef-Zadeh.
   ``This is the most detailed look at the center of our galaxy,
and it is similar, in a scaled-down version, to what we expect to
see in the nuclei of active galaxies,'' said Yusef-Zadeh in a
telephone interview Wednesday night.``Super-massive black holes are
believed to be imbedded at the center of these galaxies.''
   A black hole is believed to be an imploded star, a massive
object so dense that even light cannot escape its gravitational
pull. It is sucking in one star every 5,000 to 10,000 years, he
said. It is 25,000 light years from Earth.
   ``It's an arena where gravity has a complete triumph over all
other forces,'' he said of his research that involved three years
of observations through the Very Large Array radiotelescope.
   The pictures of the object, called Sagittarius A, show at least
seven clumps of gas surrounding it and seeming to spiral outward
from it, as if being sprayed out from something rapidly spinning.
   ``This is the first time you can actually see bloblike sources
near the galactic center,'' Yusef-Zadeh said.
   Until now, he said, it had not been clear whether Sagittarius A
or a star cluster called IRS 16 was really at the center of the
galaxy.
   ``We believe that we have good evidence that Sagittarius A is
truly at the center of our galaxy and is responsible for energizing
its immediate vicinity,'' he said.
   Although nothing can escape the interior of a black hole,
Yusef-Zadeh said that gas, dust and stars drawn toward it are
believed to form a swirling disc. The black hole's gravity,
astronomers believe, heats this material to such an extent that
some of the matter is blown back outward by the radiation pressure
and by a wind similar to solar wind.
   Scientists cannot actually see the black hole but can record the
energy spewing out from it _ an amount roughly equal to the power
that would be radiated by 10 million suns. The radiotelescope can
measure radio waves and infrared radiation.
   The study was done in collaboration with astronomers Mark
Morris, of University of California, Los Angeles, and Ron Ekers of
the Australian Telescope at Epping, Australia.

   White House Chief of Staff John Sununu has
accepted an invitation to go to Moscow to help Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev organize his office, a spokesman said today.
   Sununu already has been offering advice, meeting this week with
a delegation of visiting Soviet officials who are interested in how
the White House works.
   Bush's spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said Sununu was invited by a
member of the group to visit Moscow and had accepted. The date of
his trip has not been set.
   Fitzwater said Sununu would advise Gorbachev on organizational
matters related to the executive office of the president. Gorbachev
was elected to the new post of president this year, in addition to
his position as general secretary of the Communist Party.
   ``I think that they would like him to come to the Soviet Union
to take a look at their ideas and their plans and see if he has any
advice,'' Fitzwater said.

<TEXT>
   He's been arrested in Florida and attacked in
Texas, but the leader of the raunchy 2 Live Crew band found two
friends in the Big Apple: Geraldo and Phil.
   Lead singer Luther Campbell on Wednesday unleashed a fiery,
foul-mouthed defense of the group's album ``As Nasty As They Wanna
Be.'' Campbell appeared live on ``Donahue'' and did a taping for a
Friday ``Geraldo.''
   With Geraldo Rivera, Campbell spouted a torrent of obscenities
at the sheriff who arrested him, denounced a black Florida judge as
an ``Uncle Tom,'' and questioned the credentials of the sheriff's
legal adviser.
   ``He hasn't given more to the black community than I have,''
Campbell said of the adviser, then attacked Broward County Sheriff
Nick Navarro over the police shooting of a black in Fort Lauderdale
earlier this year.
   ``It will definitely be our most bleeped show ever. No
question,'' said Jeff Erdel, the publicist for the show.
   But Campbell wasn't finished. He went live on the syndicated
``Donahue'' show, where he was joined by previously censored
performers Jello Biafra and Wendy O. Williams.
   Campbell kept it clean for Phil Donahue's show. But Bob DeMoss,
director of the conservative Focus on Family, stunned viewers with
an expletive broadcast live into millions of homes.
   ``I'd like to keep this job,'' Donahue said in asking his guests
to calm down. DeMoss later apologized, and NBC received dozens of
phone calls about the expletive.
   Biafra and Williams vigorously defended Campbell.
   ``I'm a little sick of the system,'' said Williams, who once
wore only electrical tape above her waist at a show. ``What are we
going to do next?''
   The twin TV appearances should keep fueling sales of ``As Nasty
As They Wanna Be,'' which are fast approaching the 2 million mark.
   A federal judge in Florida has declared the album obscene, and
San Antonio store owners pulled the record from shelves this week
after they were threatened with arrest.
   In Columbia, S.C., solicitor James Anders on Wednesday deemed
``Nasty As They Wanna Be'' obscene and said he will give Richland
County record store owners 10 days to clear the album from their
shelves.
   Campbell and two other band members were arrested Sunday after a
live gig at a Florida club. The judge has called the band obscene,
but Campbell and his supporters claim First Amendment protection
and suggest they are victims of racism. Band members are black.
   Navarro has denied the racism charges, as he has done repeatedly
since the arrests. ``I'm not after anybody because of race,''
Navarro said.

<HEAD>Mozambique, Rebels Postpone Direct Peace Talks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BLANTYRE, Malawi (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The first direct peace talks between
Mozambique's government and right-wing rebels have been postponed.
   A communique Wednesday by officials of Mozambique's leftist
government and mediating countries said the talks did not begin as
scheduled Tuesday in Malawi, which borders the troubled southeast
African nation.
   The discussions were to include Mozambican Cabinet ministers and
Alfonso Dhlakama, head of the Mozambique National Resistance
guerrilla army, known by its Portuguese acronym Renamo.
   The communique said without elaboration that the talks were
postponed because of ``difficulties experienced by the Kenya and
Renamo delegations.''
   ``Efforts are continuing to set a new date in the near future
for the process to begin in Malawi,'' said the statement, published
by the official Malawi News Agency, Mana.
   Renamo has been fighting for control of the territory for 13
years and opposes the one-party rule of President Joaquim Chissano.
The war has left hundreds of thousands of people dead, mostly
civilians.
   The Mozambique national news agency, AIM, had reported from
Blantyre on Tuesday that Mozambican Cabinet ministers and the
leader of the guerrillas had gathered in the city for the talks.
But Renamo did not sign Wednesday's communique. The host government
for several days declined to grant visas for Western correspondents
seeking to report on the meeting.
   Renamo has opposed Malawi as a venue, favoring either Kenya or
Portugal, Mozambique's former colonial ruler that granted
independence in 1975.
   Malawian officials, contacted by telephone from the Zimbabwean
capital, Harare, said they were not authorized to discuss the
aborted meeting beyond what was published in the communique.
   The Blantyre talks were expected to focus on President
Chissano's proposals for a new constitution to allow independents
to oppose the ruling Front for the Liberation of Mozambique at
elections.
   But Chissano has rejected demands for the creation of opposition
parties.
   Kenya and Zimbabwe have for several months brokered low-level
peace talks.

   Thousands of telephone calls clogged the White
House switchboard after Secretary of State James A. Baker III gave
out the phone number Wednesday in a public hearing, a spokesman
said today.
   During a time period when the White House might typically
receive 100 or 200 calls, between 6,000 and 8,000 callers dialed
the presidential residence after Baker sarcastically recited the
number in a Senate hearing.
   ``The switchboard was finally blocked to the point where it
couldn't handle it anymore. And they had to put it on automatic
thank-you tape,'' White House Press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said.
   Baker gave out the number, 202 456-1414, as he prodded Israel on
its commitment to the Mideast peace process. He said that when the
Israeli government was ready to talk seriously about peace, it
could call the president's number.
   Fitzwater amplified today on Baker's comments. Asked if the
United States questions Israel's commitment to peace, he said, ``We
have not yet seen the dialogue start. There is a question,
certainly _ on both sides.''
   The United States wants to help the peace process and has tried
to get the warring parties to the negotiation table, Fitzwater said.
   However, he said, ``In the final analysis the parties of the
region have to want peace for it to happen. We can't want it for
them. But he was saying basically that if they want peace enough to
get a dialogue going, it will happen and give us a call.''
   Baker's unusually blunt statements did not produce any calls
from Israel's new conservative government, Fitzwater said.
   But the broadcast of his remarks on television and radio news
programs all day Wednesday prompted thousands of calls from the
public.
   ``They were all over the issue on all sides,'' he said. ``It's a
fairly incredible volume.''
   Apparently the White House operators tired of taking calls
prompted by Baker, who works several blocks away at the State
Department.
   A reporter from Israel, Yaacov Eilon, said that when he called
in and said he was calling in response to Baker's comment, the
operator told him, ``You would have to call the State Department.
... That number is 647-4000.''
   Asked what all this meant, Fitzwater quipped, ``It means the
White House operators can expect a thick Christmas present this
year from the State Department.''

   Tens of thousands of workers responded
to a call for help in putting down anti-government protests by
streaming into Bucharest today, clubbing people and ransacking
opposition party offices.
   Health Ministry officials said five people were killed and 277
injured in two days of violence, the country's worst since the
December revolution that toppled and executed dictator Nicolae
Ceausescu.
   There were unconfirmed reports of more than a dozen deaths.
Deputy Health Minister Radu Dop said 80 people were hospitalized.
   The clashes began before dawn Wednesday, when club-wielding
police broke up a nearly two-month, anti-government protest in
central University Square. Later, police opened fire on
demonstrators who attacked state television, the Interior Ministry
and the headquarters of the new intelligence service.
   Early today, soldiers fired at demonstrators who threw firebombs
at police headquarters and sporadic gunfire echoed across Bucharest.
   In Washington, the Bush administration condemned ``in the
strongest possible terms'' what it called ``government inspired
vigilante violence.'' White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater
said the violence ``departs from the commonly accepted norms of
democracy and the rule of law.''
   The pro-government workers who streamed into Bucharest today
heeded a call from President-elect Ion Iliescu in a televised
speech to put down what he termed an attempt by ``fascists'' to
overthrow the government. He repeated the call today in a speech to
supporters outside government headquarters.
   Thousands of miners packed University Square, clubbing reporters
and people they thought were opposition sympathizers.
   After the clash, state TV said Interior Minister Mihai Chitac
had been replaced. Chitac, a general, was criticized for alleged
involvement in the suppression of the pro-democracy revolution last
year and for the way police put down protests Wednesday. But no
reason was given for his dimissal.
   Chitac was replaced by Doru Viorel Ursu, chief judge of the
three-man panel in Sibiu residing over the trial of Nicu Ceausescu,
the son of the former dictator. He is charged with complicity to
genocide.
   During the violence today, people in military trucks handed the
government supporters milk and bread.
   Unidentified people in a van carrying loudspeakers warned
passers-by: ``don't incite the miners ... you would thus give birth
to fierce violence.''
   The speakers also instructed the miners, some of whom were armed
with police truncheons, to get hold of cameramen, photographers and
reporters and take them into the van.
   ``We will take care of them,'' the speaker said.
   Ovidiu Bogdan, 28, a photographer for Gamma, said he was
attacked by men armed with iron-ended clubs a few hundred yards
from the square.
   Associated Press reporter Christina Pirvulescu was clubbed and
had her press card seized before being rescued by an acquaintance
in the army.
   Other government suporters ransacked the headquarters of the
opposition Liberal Party and Peasant Party _ which they accused of
instigating Wednesday's rioting _ as well as buildings such as the
Bucharest University's Faculty of Foreign Languages.
   Iliescu is the first ex-Communist to win a popular presidential
election in Eastern Europe. He and the National Salvation Front
took power in the bloody December revolution, then won May 20
elections by a landslide.
   Anti-government protesters claim the Front is dominated by
Communists and accuse it of the same heavy-handed tactics of the
Ceausescu regime. Iliescu is among several top Front leaders who
were once high-ranking Communists.
   A Front statement carried by the Rompres state news agency said
``journalists who use lies and slander to incite open violence and
destabilizing actions'' were partly to blame for Wednesday's
rioting.
   Anti-government demonstrators on Wednesday ransacked and set
fire to police headquarters, set a smaller government building
ablaze and forced their way into television headquarters, halting
all broadcasting for an hour.
   Along the way, they overturned and set fire to cars and other
vehicles.
   Soldiers and police defending government buildings or moving to
retake them periodically fired on demonstrators. Rompres reported
``many'' arrests.
   State media estimated damage to the television headquarters from
firebombs at $2 million.
   The demonstrators who held a round-the-clock vigil in University
Square for 53 days claim Iliescu doesn't want a free market and
Western-style democracy, which they advocate. They also demanded a
10-year ban on ex-Communists holding public office and an
independent television station.
   The pro-government demonstrators, mostly workers from the
capital's factories and mines, chanted: ``Iliescu, the workers are
with you.''
   ``It is all their fault ... they have injected shame and
distrust in people,'' construction worker Ioan Marcovei said of
opposition leaders, who issued statements denying any
responsibility for Wednesday's unrest.
   Marcovei spoke as a crowd of workers shouted slogans against the
main opposition leaders, Ion Ratiu and Radu Campeanu.
   Vasile Sima, a miner from Livezeni, carried a police truncheon
as he crowded with his colleagues into University Square.
   He said the miners wouldn't leave until they ``put things in
order.''

<TEXT>
   A House investigative panel voted Thursday to
subpoena Texas developer Leonard Briscoe to testify about his
dealings with the Department of Housing and Urban Development and
former HUD officials.
   Rep. Tom Lantos, D-Calif., chairman of the subcommittee that has
spent more than a year probing the HUD scandal, said Briscoe would
be compelled to appear June 21. The subpoena was approved by a
unanimous 5-0 vote of the employment and housing subcommittee of
the Government Operations Committee.
   Lantos said that despite Briscoe's initial statements that he
was willing to testify voluntarily, the panel had been unable to
gain a commitment from him and Briscoe's attorneys had sent
conflicting signals about whether he would appear.
   ``In order to put an end to this childish game of `red
light-green light,' and to ensure Mr. Briscoe's appearance before
the subcommittee on June 21, I'm requesting a subpoena be issued,''
Lantos said.
   DuBois Gilliam, a former deputy assistant secretary of HUD now
serving a prison sentence, testified under immunity last month and
named Briscoe in describing how lucrative federal housing and
community development grants were steered to favored developers.
   Briscoe is a former Texas state legislator and Fort Worth city
council member. He was a business associate of Lance Wilson, once a
top aide to former HUD Secretary Samuel Pierce, and was involved in
development of projects in Texas and Florida that benefited from
HUD grants.

   Negotiators at East-West talks on
reducing conventional forces in Europe are close to agreement on
limits for tanks and armored combat vehicles for each military
bloc, diplomats said today.
   An accord would push ahead the overall talks, and an initial
agreement might be reached by the end of the year, they said.
   The East-West talks are to cut troops and non-nuclear weapons of
the two military alliances from the Atlantic Ocean to the Ural
mountains. The 16 NATO and seven Warsaw Pact countries are taking
part.
   The breakthrough proposal came from the French and the Poles. It
suggests an overall ceiling for each side of 30,000 armored combat
vehicles and 20,000 tanks.
   French chief delegate Francois Plaisant said at a news
conference given jointly with Polish chief delegate Wlodzimierz
Konarski today there was ``informal but overall consensus'' on the
proposal.
   Diplomats said they expected imminent formal agreement on
ceilings in the two categories.
   Negotiators from both sides had charged petty bargaining was
slowing the talks. Western diplomats said the Soviets appeared to
be foot-dragging until the future security allegiance of a united
Germany was decided.
   But both sides hope to have an agreement ready for signing by
December, when leaders from 35 nations are scheduled to meet in
Paris. The other 12 participants in the Paris talks are neutral and
non-aligned European countries.
   In his plenary statement, Konarski said discussions between U.S.
and Soviet experts during last month's Washington summit had
``produced results which made it easier to formulate a `compromise
package.'''
   One of the toughest issues has been finding common definitions
for tanks and other armaments, diplomats said.
   The French-Polish proposal also sets weight limits of 16.5 tons
for all tanks and it would no longer distinguish between armored
troop carriers, and other armored vehicles.
   According to U.S. estimates, the West has 23,600 tanks to the
Warsaw Pact's 52,500; NATO has 34,025 armored combat vehicls and
the Warsaw Pact has 59,400.
   Konarski said the use of broader categories of definitions was
the only way to conclude a deal ``in a situation where there is
such a pluralism in Europe of types of weapons.''
   But Konarski and Plaisant said there were still many issues to
be resolved before a final agreement can be signed. Konarski said
the issue of ceilings and definitions on aircraft and helicopters,
and terms for verification still must be resolved.
   NATO has proposed a maximum of 4,700 combat aircraft for each
side, with an additional 500 air defense interceptors, but the East
would like a higher ceiling.
   The superpowers have agreed to a ceiling of 195,000 troops each
in Central Europe, with the United States permitted to maintain up
to 30,000 troops elsewhere in Europe.

<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 5th graf, `A ferry...', to give island location.</NOTE>

   The city couldn't provide them homes when they
were alive. But after the two men died _ killed when their cave
beneath a razed building collapsed _ they were given a final
resting place on a grassy, quiet island.
   Quiet because only the dead reside on Hart Island. About 700,000
bodies are buried on the 100-acre island. A paupers' graveyard for
121 years, it is among the most intensively used pieces of real
estate in New York City.
   Miguel Marrero and Jose Diaz were buried Wednesday, 34 days
after the shelter they dug collapsed in a rainstorm.
   The body of a third man who died with them was claimed by his
family. But because the bodies of Marrero and Diaz lay unclaimed in
the morgue for more than two weeks, they were sent to Hart Island.
   A ferry bearing a stack of 14 pine caskets containing the bodies
of Marrero, Diaz and other indigents chugged to the island in Long
Island Sound, about a mile from the borough of the Bronx.
   Diaz's and Marrero's names were written in black marker on their
rough-hewn caskets. Another casket had the markings UNK WHT M, for
unknown white male.
   The bodies headed for Hart Island are not embalmed and the
caskets are thin. That way, nature can reclaim them and the burial
plots can be used again in a few decades, in a macabre recycling
program.
   ``A box sometimes falls apart as we're moving it and a body
rolls out,'' said Jerome DiSisto, a corrections officer
accompanying the burial detail. ``If that happens, we just get an
empty box, put the body in and that's all.''
   Capt. Gene Ruppert, another corrections official, said an
average of 1,500 adults are buried each year on the island, in
addition to 1,500 infants, most of them stillborn. A quarter or
more of those buried are believed to have been homeless.
   The Corrections Department manages the island and all burials
are performed by inmates, who earn 50 cents an hour, department
spokesman Tom Antenen said.
   The few buildings on the island, such as a onetime insane
asylum, are overgrown with vegetation, except for a recently
abandoned prison barracks, which still has fences with concertina
wire.
   Every plot of 150 bodies has a white marker. The location of
each body is recorded in case a relative comes to claim it. About
90 bodies are exhumed each year.
   Al Saunders, a city employee, uses a backhoe to dig the trench
where the caskets are laid two across and stacked three high. He
has buried thousands of coffins since 1984 _ and has had to dig a
few up.
   ``It isn't the nicest job going, but it has to be done,'' he
said. ``You have to develop a callous attitude, because how much
death can you see without it having an effect on you?''
   Saunders said one of his predecessors became so preoccupied with
death he had nightmares and quit.
   The prisoners, many shirtless in the sun, hoisted Diaz's casket
into the trench, then put three more inside. No words were said as
Diaz and Marrero were buried. The inmates reached for the next
casket and the next until their chore was done.
   Saunders dropped the soil onto the common grave with his
backhoe. The prisoners smoothed out the loam with rakes and shovels.
   Diaz and Marrero were known as Mike and Joe, according to a New
York Newsday article that appeared shortly after their deaths.
   ``They were good people,'' one friend, Daisy Aldebedo, told the
newspaper. ``They got high, but they worked for their money. They
never robbed anyone.''
   The city planned to build low-income housing on the lot where
Diaz, Marrero and the third man, Benjamin Olivera, were killed.
   There are an estimated 70,000 homeless people in New York City.
In recent weeks, hundreds of homeless people have been evicted from
train stations and bank-machine vestibules.
   City shelters have a reputation for violence, and many homeless
people shun them because of rules that residents must be drug- and
alcohol-free, said Marjorie Valleau, a spokeswoman for the city
Human Resources Administration.

   The New York Stock Exchange will begin trading
stocks outside its normal hours and off its trading floor later
this year, a first in its nearly 200-year history, sources
confirmed today.
   The plans are an attempt to recapture trading volume in Big
Board stocks from foreign markets, especially London and Tokyo, as
the world moves toward around-the-clock trading.
   The new trading will be conducted electronically and may bypass
the specialists, the floor traders through whom stock transactions
are routed currently, said officials familiar with the plan who
asked not to be named.
   The plan first was reported in The New York Times.
   NYSE spokesman Richard Torrenzano declined to confirm the
report. However, he said the exchange has been studying the
possibility of off-hours trading for two years.
   ``If we see a need by our customers to have an off-hour trading
system, we will move very innovatively and quickly to meet that
customer demand,'' he said.
   The Times said the exchange plans to begin two limited
after-hours trading sessions sometime this year, with different
rules applying than during daytime trading.
   Sometime in 1991, the exchange plans to conduct auctions of each
Big Board stock at 8 p.m., midnight and 5 a.m. New York time, the
newspaper said. Each stock would trade only once at each auction,
with all trades combined at a single agreed price.
   The three auction times would coincide with the start of the
Tokyo business day, the middle of the Tokyo day and the early part
of the London business day.
   It is estimated that 15 million to 20 million shares of NYSE
stocks trade each day outside of exchange hours. Average volume
during the exchange's 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. session has been running
at about 160 million shares recently.

<TEXT>
   Police have shot and killed the
mastermind of the Medellin cocaine cartel's 10-month-old war
against the government that has left hundreds of people dead,
authorities said today.
   The killing occurred Wednesday night in an exclusive Medellin
suburb, and this morning a car bomb went off near a police post in
the suburb, killing at least two people and injuring 20, the RCN
radio network reported. No one immediately claimed responsibility
for the blast.
   John Jairo Arias Tascon, considered the cartel's No. 5 leader,
was killed in the El Poblado neighborhood when police, acting on a
trip, found and tried to arrest him, said Gen. Octavio Vargas,
operational police director.
   The killing was the biggest victory for the government's war on
drugs since the slaying of Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, the cartel's
No. 2 boss in December.
   Vargas did not say if any police were hurt in the shootout, but
he said four more law officers were killed in Medellin Wednesday
night. Their deaths bring to 110 the number of Medellin policemen
assassinated so far this year.
   Arias, 28, led a terrorist organization that killed scores of
Colombians, including an attorney general, a state governor, a
judge and a leading journalist, Vargas said in an interview today
on RCN.
   ``He served as chief of the armed organization of the Medellin
cartel,'' Vargas said, and was considered the cartel's fifth most
important leader.
   He said Arias was also responsible for two car bomb attacks on
Colombia's secret police chief, Gen. Miguel Maza Marquez.
   The blasts killed at least 70 people, but Maza escaped unharmed.
   Authorities blame drug traffickers for killing more than 400
Colombians since August, when the government begn a sweeping
anti-drug crackdown.
   Vargas said police relied on cooperation from Medellin's
residents to locate Arias. He said the person who provided the
crucial information will receive a $200,000 reward.
   The terror campaign came in response to a crackdown on the
cartels that President Virgilio Barco began in August after a
leading presidential candidate was assassinated and the traffickers
were blamed for the killing.
   Since then Barco's administration has extradited 15 drug
suspects and confiscated hundreds of properties belonging to the
cocaine magnates.
   On Wednesday, the government announced it would dispatch 570
more police officers and soldiers to the trafficking center of
Medellin, where cartel-hired assassins have killed 106 police
officers this year.
   Drug traffickers in April offered a $4,300 bounty for each
officer killed.
   Medellin, Colombia's second largest city, has about 3 million
residents.
   At one time, the Medellin cartel was believed responsible for
most of the cocaine that is smuggled into the United States.

   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa ran into a
little labor trouble himself Thursday en route to a flight to
Switzerland for a meeting of the International Labor Organization.
   Walesa's auto was stopped four times in successive roadblocks
organized by farmers to protest low milk prices.
   The delays took place near Mlawa, about 80 miles northeast of
Warsaw on the main highway from his home in Gdansk to Warsaw.
   Farmers were protesting low milk prices paid by their local
dairy cooperative, a monopoly.
   Walesa talked to the farmers, calling their protest
``justified'' and promising to help them on his return from Geneva.
   ``A process of dissatisfaction is taking place in many groups of
society,'' Walesa said in Warsaw. ``It worries me a little because
there _ in Mlawa _ it is a local problem. But they are all cursing
the government.''
   Under Poland's radical economic reform plan, prices have risen
while real incomes have plunged.
   Walesa is to address the union organization Friday.

   The Food and Drug Administration on Thursday
warned cattle producers against using a non-prescription veterinary
product designed to prevent copper deficiency in beef cattle and
calves.
   The FDA said it had received reports of about 240 cattle deaths
from copper toxicity after injections of Bovi-Cu.
   Veterinary Research and Development Inc. of Truckee, Calif.,
which developed Bovi-Cu, is recalling the product. The product is
made by Anthony Products of Arcadia, Calif. Cattle producers should
return it to the place of purchase, the FDA said.
   The manufacturer shipped 3,723 100-milligram vials to
distributors in California, Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Missouri,
Nebraska, New Mexico, Oregon and Texas, the FDA said. Those
distributors sell the product to farms from Kansas to Hawaii, the
agency said.
   About 2,211 vials are still in distribution channels, the FDA
said.

   The demonstrators who held out on
Bucharest's central University Square for more than 50 days were
students, pro-democracy activists and rowdies who seemed unclear
what they wanted.
   They claimed that more than 5 million people across the country
had signed a petition backing their chief demand _ a 10-year ban on
former Communist leaders such as President-elect Ion Iliescu from
entering politics.
   That demand is supported by some of the country's leading
intellectuals, who also don't trust Iliescu's promises of democracy
and believe he and other ex-Communists in his National Salvation
Front have usurped the revolution.
   But Bucharest and Timisoara are the only cities since December
to have seen demonstrations of more than a few hundred people
against the government.
   The overwhelming victory of Iliescu and his Front in last
month's elections suggest the demonstrators' demands found little
support in other areas, where citizens see Iliescu as the man who
rid them of the hated Nicolae Ceausescu.
   More than 100 of the 200 demonstrators on University Square were
arrested when police moved against them on the 53rd day of their
protest Wednesday.
   It remains unclear who the demonstrators were who later set fire
to police headquarters and attacked other key buildings such as the
state television.

<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A human rights group urged the Hong Kong
authorities Thursday to abolish capital punishment before this
British colony reverts to Chinese rule in 1997.
   Although the law still exists, Hong Kong has not carried out
capital punishment since 1966, and death sentences are commuted to
life imprisonment.
   The Hong Kong branch of Amnesty International said it was
apprehensive of the use of the penalty after 1997 because it is
still widely imposed and carried out in China.
   ``Amnesty International opposes the death penalty as a violation
of the right of life,'' it said in a statement. ``It is also the
ultimate form of cruel, inhumane and degrading punishment.''
   The call for its abolishment was contained in the human rights
group's submission on the territory's proposed Bill of Rights,
which is expected to be enacted into law this year.
   The bill was unveiled by the government in March in a move to
reassure people here that their human rights will be safeguarded
after the Chinese takeover.
   China has warned it would repeal the bill if contravenes the
Basic Law, the constitution for Hong Kong's post-1997
administration.
   The Chinese government has pledged to retain Hong Kong's legal
and capitalistic systems for 50 years after 1997.

<TEXT>
   Three army officers accused of sharing
bribes linked to the purchase of 2.5 million pairs of black socks
for troops could face execution if convicted, court officials said
Thursday.
   The officers, among seven arrested in the scandal, allegedly
received a portion of $109,000 in bribes paid by a hosiery dealer
last year to win the $1.82 million socks contract, prosecutors at
Taipei District Court charge.
   Some of the bribe money reached Chiang Chung-lien, a cousin of
the chief of staff to President Lee Teng-hui, officials allege.
Chiang Chung-lien was arrested Wednesday.
   The socks supplier, Hsiao Chun-liang, told court prosecutors the
three officers also had demanded $218,200 in kickbacks to accept a
shipment of substandard socks, but he refused to pay them.
   Hsiao and Chiang Chung-lien's son, Ching-hsiung, were arrested
Wednesday, along with Tsai Hsiung, head of the National Assembly's
Public Relations Department.
   The three arrested officers were identified as Maj. Gen. Liu
Pao, Col. Chen Tao-ming and Col. Liao Yun-hsun. All three
supervised military purchases.
   If convicted of bribery, the military officers could be
sentenced to death and the civilians could receive a maximum
seven-year prison sentence.
   Formal charges will be filed when the investigation is
completed, prosecutors said.
   Prosecutors said Hsiao complained it was difficult to meet all
the standards set by the military for the socks, including a
guarantee the black socks would not fade even if soaked in hot
water for 40 minutes.
   Hsiao said some of the socks were manufactured at factories in
Shanghai, China, to lower production costs.

   The privacy rights of motorists are not
violated when police try to curb drunken driving by stopping them
at sobriety checkpoints, the Supreme Court ruled today.
   The 6-3 ruling upheld Michigan's sobriety checkpoint program
and, by extension, similar programs in most states.
   In another decision, the court allowed the Bush administration
to limit how much welfare aid some needy families receive.
   By a 5-4 vote, the court said Social Security benefits paid to
children must be considered in determining a family's eligibility
for benefits under the government's Aid to Families with Dependent
Chidren program.
   The court also ruled the government may impose severe fines
against air polluters even when federal officials are slow to
decide on proposals for cleaning up the atmosphere.
   And it ruled that hospitals and nursing homes may sue in federal
court to challenge how a state-run Medicaid program reimburses
their costs.
   Lower courts had split on the sobriety-checkpoint issue. Some
had upheld the use of checkpoints, at which all motorists are
pulled off the road and checked for signs of intoxication. Other
courts, like those in Michigan, had barred police from using
checkpoints.
   ``No one can seriously dispute the magnitude of the drunken
driving problem or the states' interest in eradicating it,'' Chief
Justice William H. Rehnquist wrote for the court.
   ``Conversely, the weight bearing on the other scale _ the
measure of the intrusion on motorists stopped briefly at sobriety
checkpoints _ is slight,'' he added.
   Drunken drivers killed 23,000 people nationwide last year.
President Bush called drunken driving a problem ``as crippling as
crack'' cocaine, and last December asked state and local
governments to step up the fight against drunken drivers.
   ``It's as crippling as crack, as random as gang violence, and
it's killing more kids than both combined,'' the president said
then as he noted that federal aid was being given to promote the
use of sobriety checkpoints.
   Today's ruling echoed the president's concern.
   Joining Rehnquist were Justices Byron R. White, Sandra Day
O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy. Justice Harry A.
Blackmun joined in the result but not in Rehnquist's majority
opinion.
   Justices William J. Brennan, Thurgood Marshall and John Paul
Stevens dissented.
   ``I do not dispute the immense social cost caused by drunken
drivers, nor do I slight the government's efforts to prevent such
tragic losses,'' Brennan wrote. But he added, ``In the face of the
`momentary evil' of drunken driving, the court today abdicates its
role as the protector of'' the fundamental right of individual
privacy.
   In a separate dissenting opinion, Stevens said, ``The most
disturbing aspect of the court's decision today is that it appears
to give no weight to the citizen's interest in freedom from
suspicionless, unannounced investigatory seizures.''
   ``Sobriety checkpoints are elaborate, and disquieting, publicity
stunts,'' Stevens said. ``This is a case that is driven by nothing
more than symbolic state action _ an insufficient justification for
an otherwise unreasonable program of random seizures.''
   Nadine Strosser, general counsel of the American Civil Liberties
Union, said today's ruling ``strikes at the heart of the Fourth
Amendment,'' which bans unreasonable police searches and seizures.
   ``This is the first time in American history that the government
is allowed to conduct searches and seizures with a view of
enforcing criminal laws without any individualized suspicion at all
that the person is committing or about to commit a crime,'' she
said.
   The traditional method police use to identify suspected drunken
drivers is to observe traffic. Determining that method is not
wholly effective, states in recent years began experimenting with
other detection methods.
   Michigan state police first used sobriety checkpoints, which
they modeled after a program in Maryland, in 1986.
   At a checkpoint site, police directed all traffic headed in one
direction to a roadside area where officers talked to motorists.
   If there was no immediate evidence of intoxication, the motorist
was given a traffic safety brochure and allowed to drive away. The
average delay was about 30 seconds.
   If some signs of intoxication were detected, a driver was
directed to another area for further questioning and perhaps a
breath test.
   At one such checkpoint, Michigan state police troopers stopped
126 cars in less than an hour and detained two drivers for sobriety
field tests. One driver was arrested on drunken-driving charges.
   Six Michigan legislators sued state police soon after the
checkpoint program began. Their lawsuit alleged that the
checkpoints violated the Fourth Amendment's ban on unreasonable
police seizures and searches.
   State courts struck down the practice, citing ``the potential
for an unreasonable subjective intrusion on individual liberty
interests.''
   Today, the nation's highest court said the Michigan courts were
wrong.
   The Supreme Court in 1979 barred police from randomly stopping
vehicles to check registration papers. In that Delaware case,
officers had total discretion over which vehicles were stopped.
   But the 1979 decision did not rule out spot checks in which an
officer's discretion was not so unconstrained. ``Questioning of all
oncoming traffic at roadblock-type stops is one possible
alternative,'' the court said 11 years ago.
   In this case, Michigan courts relied on another 1979 Supreme
Court ruling in which the justices said the constitutionality of a
police seizure made without ``probable cause'' to suspect a crime
should be determined by three factors:
   _The gravity of the public concerns being served.
   _How the seizure advances the public interest.
   _The severity of the police interference with individual liberty.
   Today, the court said the Michigan sobriety checkpoint program
satisfies all three factors.
   ``The balance of the state's interest in preventing drunken
driving, the extent to which this system can reasonably be said to
advance that interest, and the degree of intrusion upon individual
motorists who are briefly stopped weighs in favor of the state
program,'' Rehnquist wrote.
   In the pollution case, the justices upheld by a 9-0 vote the
Environmental Protection Agency's power to seek fines of up to
$25,000 a day against a General Motors plant in Massachusetts.
   However, the impact of the ruling for future cases may be
limited. The House and Senate have passed separate bills revising
the federal Clean Air Act that establish new timetables to address
the kind of problem at issue in the General Motors case.
   In the Medicaid case, the justices by a 5-4 vote let a Virginia
hospital association invoke a federal civil rights law in suing the
state over Virginia's Medicaid reimbursement rates.
   Officials from most of the 50 states had urged the court to rule
against the association. They said allowing such lawsuits could
affect hundreds of millions of dollars in federal and state
funding, and lead to a litigation explosion.
   The checkpoint case is State Police vs. Sitz, 88-1897.

   As many as 60 boats attacked a spreading
oil slick with skimmers and booms to try to protect the shoreline
today as fuel leaked from a 5.5 million-gallon tank on the burning
Mega Borg.
   The oil slick about 30 miles off Galveston was an estimated 30
miles long and 10 miles wide in spots. Officials said they could
not determine where the oil might wash ashore or how soon.
   A Coast Guard officer said at an inquiry today that the Mega
Borg was in good condition in April when it passed a Coast Guard
inspection.
   ``Both the engine and the pump rooms were in very good
condition,'' said Coast Guard Petty Officer Richard Miles of the
April inspection. ``I didn't see any excessive leaks. The bilges
were clean and the vents were intact.''
   Fireboats showered water on a ``low-level fire'' still burning
in the engine room this morning. Firefighters were to return to the
vessel later today to try spraying flame-smothering foam on the
blaze again, the Coast Guard said.
   About 880 gallons of foam was used on the fire Wednesday, but
the operation was halted when it caused the fire to flare.
   The oil slick was the rusty brown remains of about 3 million
gallons of light African crude that the Coast Guard says leaked
from the tanker in the five days since the first of a series of
explosions aboard the Norwegian ship.
   Coast Guard officials said most of the spilled oil had either
burned or evaporated, but as the ship's fire diminished, the slick
from the 886-foot ship nearly doubled in length because oil was no
longer being consumed by flames.
   The oil was spewing from a hole in the vessel's center tank,
Coast Guard Capt. Thomas Greene said. ``I don't see any risk of
losing cargo from the other tanks,'' he said.
   The leaking tank's capacity is 5.5 million gallons, but it
wasn't known whether it had been full or how much oil remained,
Ensign David Nichols said.
   Jim O'Brien, of O'Brien's Oil Production Services, said his
company, also known as OOPS, had recovered about 30,000 gallons.
   Along with skimming, officials turned to an experimental
procedure of dropping oil-consuming bacteria into the water.
   ``We're going to try it,'' Greene said. ``Anything we can do to
clean up the spill, we'll try.'' But he said that the process,
called bioremediation, is a new technology and is not considered a
major part of the cleanup.
   A day after the ship fire was declared under control,
firefighters Wednesday tried blanketing hot spots with foam. But
the heat was so intense it ignited trapped vapors and caused a
flare-up, forcing salvage crews to return to spraying water on the
ship.
   ``The reflash is a minor setback,'' Coast Guard Chief Petty
Officer Todd Nelson said. ``There is very little fire left on the
ship.''
   The ship's superstructure and stack are collapsed, its rear has
dropped more than 60 feet and waves wash over the deck.
   The ship was carrying 38 million gallons of oil when its pump
room exploded while it was transferring oil to a smaller vessel
late Friday. The incident was reported to the Coast Guard about 1
a.m. Saturday. Two of the 41 crew members died, two were missing
and presumed dead and 17 were injured, none seriously.
   The government of Norway started an inquiry Wednesday in
Galveston to question crew members.
   The captain said he didn't know what sparked the explosion and
that the crew went over a safety checklist before transferring the
fuel.
   C.M. Mahidhara, 36, a sailor for 17 years and captain for nine,
said he was in the radio room alone when he felt a ``sort of a
bump'' and moments later ``the door swung open, the lights went out
and glass was crashing down.''
   In the confusion, Mahidhara moved his wife and children to
safety, but he said that thick black smoke kept him from locating
and commanding his crew.
   ``I looked forward and saw bright flames were coming from the
pump room and ventilators,'' he said. ``The flames were licking up
right over the bridge. The top of the pump room had been completely
blown off.''
   Mahidhara said the explosion occurred around 11:30 p.m. Friday,
contrary to earlier reports that it happened early Saturday.
   Ole Leithe, a Norwegian maritime investigator who questioned the
crewmen, said: ``I don't think we can find the reason for the
explosion from this hearing. Maybe later when the ship is empty and
cleaned we will know more.''
   Officials said that when the fire is out it will take days for
the superstructure to cool enough to start unloading oil.
   An 825-foot British-registered tanker stoody by to begin
receiving the remainder of the ship's $22 million cargo from Angola.

   Money problems have forced the World
Theater, former home for Garrison Keillor's ``A Prairie Home
Companion,'' to lay off 10 of its 12 full-time employees.
   The decision became public Wednesday when employees of the
elegant, 76-year-old former vaudeville show house were informed.
The layoffs are effective on different dates through July 15.
   Of the theater's full-time employees, only Director Patrick
Ruble and Operations Manager Ken Schumacher will remain.
   The World was restored as a permanent home for Keillor's radio
program even though an effort to raise $3.5 million fell short. The
city helped out with a $250,000, 12-year loan at 3 percent interest.
   The theater was left without a show when Keillor left St. Paul
about a year after it reopened in 1986.
   The changes announced Wednesday mean the World will no longer
present programs under its own auspices, but will continue to be
available for rental, theater officials said.
   Previously booked events also will go on, said Ruble.

   A moonshiner who prided himself on

   William Russell Stewart, 46, was sentenced Wednesday after
pleading guilty to possessing a still, possessing illegally
manufactured liquor and selling liquor illegally.
   The Royal Canadian Mounted Police discovered Stewart's moonshine
business in May. Bookkeeping ledgers found by police indicated an
extensive commercial operation, prosecutor Anthony Allman told the

   Stewart sold 40-ounce bottles of his distilled product for $20
and pint bottles for $7.
   ``Was it good stuff?'' asked the judge.
   ``The best,'' said Stewart.

   President Bush visited the Vietnam War
Memorial at daybreak today to watch one U.S. flag being lowered and
another raised. ``It was an appropriate way to observe Flag Day,''
said spokesman Marlin Fitzwater.
   Bush, who has been outspoken over the past few days in pressing
for a constitutional amendment protecting the flag, did not speak
at the brief ceremony and would not take questions from reporters.
   The White House renewed its push this week for the flmendment after
the Supreme Court on Monday struck down
the 1989 federal law against flag-desecration.
   Fitzwater later said no link was intended between Bush's active
lobbying for the flag-protection amag
protection aendment and his decision to
visit Vietnam Memorial to be photographed watching the flag being
raised.
   ``He went to the memorial because he thought it was an
appropriate place to commemorate Flag Day,'' Fitzwater said.
   He denied that the White House was seeking to politicize the
issue.
   But, on Capitol Hill, Senate Democrats used Flag Day speeches to
criticize the proposed amendment and Bush's support for the change.
   ``We will be whimpering wimps if we at the Justice Department is committed
to the
investigation, prosecution and incarceration of those who ripped
off our financial institutions and have left the taxpayers of the
United States holding the bag,'' U.S. Attorney Dick Thornburgh said
in a statement.
   Dixon was accused of encouraging employees to make about $7,000
in political contributions and then reimbursing them with expense
money or phony bonuses to skirt restrictions on corporate campaign
contributions.
   Among other things, Dixon was charged with conspiring with other
Vernon officials to give money to Texas Democrat Jim Wright, the
former House speaker who was pressing federal regulators to stop
trying to close insolvent Texas thrifts.
   The indictment alleged Dixon also billed Vernon $10,500 for
prostitutes for himself and others at a 1985 Vernon board of
directors' party at Dixon's Solana Beach, Calif., beach house and
on a yacht cruise in San Diego harbor.
   In 1985, Dixon allegedly used Vernon money for hunting trips
with senior Vernon officials to Kansas and San Diego. L. Linton
Bowman III, then commissioner of the Texas Savings and Loan
Department, went along, the indictment said.
   Lodging, meals, female companionship and other expenses cost
$4,866, the indictment said.
   Dixon also was accused of using his airplane for an illegal
activity _ transporting prostitutes from Texas to California.
   Former Vernon vice president Patrick Malone testified at King's
1989 trial that contributions were solicited from King and other
top thrift executives. The money was for the 1986 gubernatorial
primary campaign of former Rep. Tom Loeffler, R-Texas, and the
re-election bids of Wright, who resigned after a House ethics
investigation unrelated to the Vernon case; former Rep. Jack Kemp,
R-N.Y., now secretary of Housing and Urban Development; Sen. Jake
Garn, R-Utah, and Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif.
   Dixon threw parties for other S&amp;L operators aboard his yacht on
the Potomac River in Washington to raise money for the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee, chaired by then-Rep. Tony Coelho,
D-Calif., the indictment said.
   At Coelho's request, Wright intervened with federal regulators
to discuss Vernon, according to a report to the House Ethics
Committee by Richard J. Phelan, an outside counsel hired to
investigate Wright.
   Phelan reported that Wright telephoned Edwin Gray, chairman of
the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, and asked if Vernon were going to
be shut down.
   Wright told the ethics panel he did not know Dixon. But Phelan's
investigation produced a picture of Wright and Dixon aboard the
yacht. The photograph bore the inscription, ``My best personal
regards, Jim Wright.''
   Wright's administrative assistant in Fort Worth did not
immediately return phone calls seeking comment today.
   Dixon was the lead defendant in a $540 million federal fraud
lawsuit brought after the Vernon shutdown but had not faced
criminal charges until Wednesday.
   The lawsuit alleged that Dixon and other thrift officers grossly
overstated Vernon's profits and net worth in order to pay $22.1
million in illegal dividends to Dondi Financial Corp., a holding
company headed by Dixon.
   The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. lawsuit said top
officials ``began to loot Vernon for their personal financial
benefit and defraud its depositors, creditors and the FSLIC.''

<HEAD>Congressman Wants Israel to Reopen West Bank Schools</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TAMARA HENRY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Like food, education should not be used as a
military weapon, Rep. Howard Nielson said Thursday as he pushed for
a congressional resolution pressuring Israel to reopen schools in
the West Bank and Gaza.
   Nielson, at a news conference opening a conference of The
Palestinian Academic Freedom Network, said he has introduced a
resolution that urges Israel to take immediate steps to reopen all
six universities in the West Bank and Gaza, which have been closed
for more than two years.
   Israel captured the territories from Jordan and Egypt in the
1967 Middle East war and has maintained military control there.
   Israeli military authorities closed all Palestinian institutions
of higher education when the intifadah, or Palestinian uprising,
began in December 1987.
   Israeli authorities, arguing that the schools served as the
focal point of the stone-throwing campaign against Israeli
soldiers, also sometimes have closed all primary and secondary
schools in the West Bank, including those run by the United Nations
Relief and Works Agency.
   ``I think it's important that we continue to send the message to
the Israeli government that education should not be used as a
political tool,'' Nielson said. ``Education ought to transcend
politics. It's as fundamental a basic human need as food. I
understand the security concerns of the Israeli government, but I
still find it unacceptable that school closings be used as a weapon
against the intifadah.''
   Although Israel has reopened West Bank primary and secondary
schools, Michel Shehadeh of the Palestinian Network said 40,000
high school graduates are now languishing because they are not
allowed to study at a university.

   Here, at a glance, are highlights of actions
taken Thursday by the Supreme Court.
   
   SOBRIETY CHECKPOINTS
   
   The court ruled that privacy rights of motorists are not
violated when police try to curb drunken driving by stopping them
at sobriety checkpoints, the Supreme Court ruled today.
   The 6-3 ruling upheld Michigan's sobriety checkpoint program
and, by extension, similar programs in most states.
   The case is State Police vs. Sitz, 88-1897.
   
   WELFARE
   
   The court allowed the Bush administration to limit how much
welfare aid some needy families receive.
   By a 5-4 vote, the court said Social Security benefits paid to
children must be considered in determining a family's eligibility
for benefits under the government's Aid to Families with Dependent
Chidren program.
   The case is Sullivan vs. Stroop, 89-535.
   
   POLLUTION
   
   The court ruled the government may impose severe fines against
air polluters even when federal officials are slow to decide on
proposals for cleaning up the atmosphere.
   In the pollution case, the justices upheld by a 9-0 vote the
Environmental Protection Agency's power to seek fines of up to
$25,000 a day against a General Motors plant in Massachusetts.
   However, the impact of the ruling for future cases may be
limited. The House and Senate have passed separate bills revising
the federal Clean Air Act that establish new timetables to address
the kind of problem at issue in the General Motors case.
   The case is General Motors vs. U.S., 89-369.
   
   MEDICAID
   
   The court ruled that hospitals and nursing homes may sue in
federal court to challenge how a state-run Medicaid program
reimburses their costs.
   The justices by a 5-4 vote let a Virginia hospital association
invoke a federal civil rights law in suing the state over
Virginia's Medicaid reimbursement rates.
   Officials from most of the 50 states had urged the court to rule
against the association. They said allowing such lawsuits could
affect hundreds of millions of dollars in federal and state
funding, and lead to a litigation explosion.
   The case is Wilder vs. Virginia Hospital Association, 88-2043.
   
   DISCOUNTS
   
   The court barred manufacturers from giving discounts to
wholesalers and not to retailers when the discounts are unrelated
to any savings for the supplier or to the wholesaler's costs.
   The court unanimously upheld a $1.35 million antitrust award
Texaco Inc. was ordered to pay to 12 service stations in the
Spokane, Wash., area.
   The case is Texaco vs. Hasbrouck, 87-2048.

   A convicted burglar can be ordered to pay
for a new burglar alarm for his victims as part of restitution, the
Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled.
   In a 5-2 decision Wednesday, justices upheld a lower court order
that Louis J. Heyn pay $4,000 for the purchase and installation of
a burglar alarm.
   Heyn had been ordered to pay $4,082 in restitution for the items
he stole. He argued that he could not be ordered to pay for the
alarm because it not covered by state restitution laws.
   But the high court majority said such a payment ``aids the
offender's reformation by educating him or her that a burglary is
not simply a taking or destruction of personal property,'' but also
``destroys the sense of security that each person has a right to
expect in his or her home.''
   The victimized couple had told the trial court that the Nov. 13,
1987, burglary was traumatic, forcing the woman to seek medical
care, so they installed the alarm system to ease their fears.

   You can get your name on a brick if you help
fund the building. Now you can boost civic pride by adopting a
light bulb.
   City Councilwoman Michelle Madoff says she is serious about her
bright idea. The ``Adopt a Bulb'' project is designed to maintain
bulbs that will decorate 11 city bridges.
   A donor who pays the cost of maintaining a single bridge light
bulb would take great pleasure in pointing out their bulb to
friends as they drive past, Ms. Madoff said.
   ``It may sound silly, but it could save us money,'' she said.
``It's workable.''
   Pittsburgh officials want to decorate the city's bridges with
lights as a tourist attraction, but no one knows how to finance the
project.
   Officials have estimated it will cost about $5 million to wire
11 bridges, $330,000 per year for electricity and $220,000 for
bulbs and maintenance.

<TEXT>
   An American miner held captive by Colombian
guerillas is surviving on armadillo and monkey meat, according to a
letter his family released today.
   Scott Heimdal told his family he is being moved daily in the
jungle by his captors. The handwritten letter was dated June 2 and
delivered late Wednesday to his parents, Roy and Marge Heimdal, in
Peoria.
   The family learned Wednesday that the kidnappers wanted
$612,000, more than 10 times the $60,000 ransom paid.
   ``We understood that $60,000 is what they wanted,'' Roy Heimdal
said. ``There's no way we could raise $612,000. That's impossible.''
   Scott Heimdal's letter confirmed reports that the kidnappers
became angry after seeing a television report week about
fund-raising efforts in Peoria.
   In his letter, the Heimdal said the kidnappers think the family
lied about their finances after seeing their modest rented home.
   ``I have to do everything in my power to convince them we don't
have anything,'' Scott Heimdal wrote.
   He said his infected feet are healing and believes ``somehow
this nightmare will be over soon.''
   Scott Heimdal was working as a gold miner for the Ecuadoran
company IMINCO when he was abducted by armed men April 28 while
traveling by boat in the jungle near the Colombian border. The boat
driver was killed in the attack.
   The guerrillas have identified themselves as members of the
People's Liberation Army.
   The elder Heimdal said the family had done everything possible
to convince the kidnappers it doesn't have any money. The family
raised the ransom during a furious, four-day public appeal.
Donations came in from around the country.
   ``We sold everything we had and had to get help from strangers
to raise $60,000. We don't have anymore,'' Mrs. Heimdal said. ``I'm
on the verge of losing my sanity. I'm a nervous wreck. This added
pressure is overwhelming.''
   Jeffrey Fino, IMINCO general manager, said from his office in
Quito, Ecuador, that the $60,000 was only a down payment ``to
guarantee his life.''
   Fino said a meeting with rebels Monday ended in failure. The
guerrillas were upset because the go-between had tried to deliver
the payment in dollars instead of Colombian pesos even though they
originally demanded dollars, Fino said.
   ``To make clear how irrational and unlogical these guys are,
they told our intermediary to take the dollars from the middle of
the jungle and be back within three hours with Colombian pesos or
they were going to kill Scott,'' Fino said.
   ``He had to get back in a canoe, go back to the little river
port he had left from, grab a taxi and go into the main town of
Lago Agrio. He cleaned out the town of pesos.''
   But there was not enough Colombian currency in the tiny
Ecuadoran oil town 25 miles from the rendezvous site. The
guerrillas set a date later this month for the balance of the
payment. Fino would not reveal the date.
   ``At that time we will demand Scott's release for that amount of
money,'' he said. ``They need to understand that's all the money
they're going to get.''

   President Bush and Thai Prime Minister
Chatichai Choonhavan today pledged to work together to fight
narcotics and bring peace to war-ravaged Cambodia through ``free
and fair elections'' under the United Nations' lead.
   The two leaders, in nearly 2{ hours of meetings and a working
luncheon at the White House, also agreed to forge new ties between
their commerce ministers to promote investment and defuse trade
disputes.
   Bush called Thailand ``one of America's oldest friends and
closest allies.''
   ``What is most remarkable about Thailand is that it has combined
a double-digit economic growth with the emergence of parliamentary
democracy,'' said Bush.
   Bush said he and Chatichai agreed to keep pressing for a
comprehensive solution under the United Nations' auspices to ``the
tragic conflict in Cambodia.''
   Both nations will ``continue our diplomatic efforts to end the
violence'' and assure ``genuine self-determination through free and
fair elections under U.N. auspices and in the presence of an
international peacekeeping force'' in Cambodia, Bush said.
   Chatichai, speaking in English, said, ``Our two countries are
committed more than ever to work together in bringing peace to
Cambodia and to end the suffering of the Cambodian people.''
   Bush said the two countries' commerce ministers will form a new
Joint U.S.-Thai Committee for Commercial Cooperation.
   Chatichai said they were seeking to establish ``a new framework
for economic cooperation ... (that) would allow us to regularly
discuss any potential trade issues before they become trade
disputes.''
   The United States currently imposes duties on $165 million of
Thai products to pressure the country to stop infringement of U.S.
patent and intellectual property rights on products ranging from
computers to Hollywood videotapes to pharmaceuticals.
   Bush expressed ``profound appreciation'' for Thailand's
providing asylum to Indochinese refugees and assured Chatichai that
America will welcome ``our share of Vietnamese refugees.''
   Bush said there is ``one kind of business we agree we will not
tolerate and that is narcotics.'' He promised to keep working to
reduce U.S. demand for drugs.
   Chatichai said drugs are ``tearing apart the very fabrics of our
societies. ... I pledge to you the full support of the Thai
government in the war against drug trafficking.''
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III also joined the leaders
for the talks. Chatichai was also meeting with leaders of Congress
and addressing the National Press Club on Friday.
   Thailand boasted the world's fastest growing economy last year,
burgeoning at nearly an 11 percent rate.
   It is a transit point for half the heroin reaching the United
States from the so-called Burma-Laos-Thailand ``golden triangle.''
   The United States has applauded asset seizure and anticonspiracy
measures that Chatichai's government recently introduced in
parliament to crack down on drug traffickers.
   Thailand also bears the burden of 300,000 temporary refugees
from the civil war in neighboring Cambodia. It has drawn criticism
from some human rights groups for turning away Vietnamese boat
people.
   The pullout of Vietnam's occupying forces from Cambodia has
eased the immediate threat to Thailand's own security, a senior
U.S. official said Wednesday, making this ``an opportune time'' to
press for a diplomatic solution to the strife in Cambodia.
   The United States and Thailand have worked together to encourage
a settlement under the auspices of the United Nations.
   Thailand recently helped arrange talks in Tokyo between Prince
Sihanouk and Hun Sen, installed as head of Cambodia's government
after the Vietnamese invasion in 1978. Chatichai also conferred
recently with Xu Dunxin, a top Chinese official who recently
traveled to both Bangkok and Vietnam.
   The United States has opposed the flow of Chinese arms to the
communist Khmer Rouge, strongest of the warring Cambodian factions,
who are blamed for killing more than 1 million of their countrymen
during their bloody 1975-78 rule.
   Some environmental groups were staging a protest march today
against what they called ``crass hypocrisy'' by Chatichai's
government in prohibiting logging within Thailand while granting
more than 40 licenses to Thai companies to harvest teak and other
rain forest timber in Burma.

<HEAD>Coal Miners Call for Prime Minister to Resign</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Coal miners from across the Soviet
Union, gathered to debate the formation of an independent union and
a possible strike, have urged Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov and
his government to resign.
   ``The government of the U.S.S.R. does not have our trust,'' read
a telegram sent to the national Supreme Soviet legislature by the
First Congress of Miners of the Soviet Union, meeting at the
largest Soviet coal field.
   ``We urge workers in other industries to quickly cut their ties
with the government,'' said the resolution, which was sent
Wednesday and read Thursday at the Supreme Soviet in Moscow.
   The telegram also criticized an economic reform plan proposed
last month by Ryzhkov and defended on national TV by President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   In the Ukrainian city of Donetsk, Mining Minister Mikhail
Shchadov fielded angry questions from the workers, then stormed
from the conference hall after the delegates voted by a 330-14
margin to disband an advisory committee he had appointed and
replace it with one named by the union Congress.
   ``Resign! Resign!'' delegates shouted as Shchadov took their
questions and accusations for some 30 minutes.
   One miner, shouting from the floor of the conference hall,
demanded to know why Shchadov remained minister of the mining
industry despite his failure to fulfill promises made to end the
nationwide coal strike last summer.
   ``I think I am qualified to be mining minister,'' Shchadov
replied.
   But his answer was cut off by the acting speaker of the
congress, Bulat Mukhazanov, who accused him of not responding
directly to the miners' questions.
   The miners were expected to vote Friday on whether to form a new
union in place of the old union that they say is controlled by the
ministry, which owns all mines and most related industries in the
Soviet Union.
   The miners also were divided on whether to organize a strike
this summer to protest the government's failure to fulfill promises
made to end last summer's nationwide walkout.
   The telegram to the Supreme Soviet mentioned neither Ryzkov nor
Gorbachev by name, but in Soviet political parlance the term
``government'' generally refers to the Council of Ministers headed
by the premier.
   It accuses the government of being responsible for the
``worsening of the social-economic system in the country,'' and
lacking the ability to make crucial decisions ``to lead the country
out of the economic crisis with a minimum of social suffering.''
   The miners' congress, consisting of 712 delegates representing
every coal shaft and pit in the country, was organized following
strikes that shut down coal production last summer and crippled
heavy industry.
   Delegates said they might be swayed by the newly elected
president of the Russian Federation, Boris N. Yeltsin, who last
week urged the miners not to strike.
   However, the miners are angry. They said the government has
failed to fulfill promises to increase their supply of food and
consumer goods, improve mine safety or give them greater power in
setting prices.
   The agreement ``is hardly being implemented,'' said Yuri L.
Makarov, a member of the organizing committee. ``The biggest thing
is the purchase price of coal. Now the price is 24 rubles a ton. We
want it increased to 80-85 rubles.''
   At a realistic exchange rate, that would still be lower than the
world price of $32 a ton for Soviet coal. The official exchange
rate puts 80 rubles at $133, but it is just $13 at the government's
tourist rate, and less than $10 at the black market rate.
   ``They offer us economic independence but leave the old prices
fixed. That is absurd,'' he said.
   Safety does not appear to have improved either, as fatal
accidents have been reported this month in the two largest Soviet
coal fields, the Kuznetsk Basin in Western Siberia and the Donetsk
Basin.
   In the Donetsk, ``Each million tons of coal cost the lives of
two or three coal miners,'' the newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda
reported Wednesday in a dispatch from the congress.

<HEAD>US Says Bulgarian Election May Have Been Tainted</HEAD>

   Widespread intimidation of voters may have
plagued the balloting in which the party of former Communists won
opening round victories in Bulgaria's parliamentary elections, the
State Department said Thursday.
   Results announced Thursday showed that the former communists,
running under the Socialist Party banner, won 172 of the 319 seats
in the Bulgarian Parliament that were decided in the first round of
voting. A runoff election is scheduled for Sunday to decide the
remaining 81 seats.
   The problems that have come to light ``raise serious questions
about the electoral process,'' State Department spokeswoman
Margaret Tutwiler said.
   ``There are many reports of local officials threatening voters
with loss of jobs, pensions or other benefits,'' she said.
   ``In addition, proper measures to ensure secrecy were not taken
in all locations, with un-curtained polling stations and
transparent ballot envelopes reported in some places.''
   In some villages, Ms. Tutwiler said, local officials reportedly
handed out Socialist Party ballots to voters in polling places.
   She said American observers noted the atmosphere of fear in the
countryside during the election process.
   Bulgaria was the only country in the Soviet bloc where the
Communists, who changed their party's name in April, remained the
strongest political force.

<HEAD>Drugs, Migration Could Be Part of US-Mexico Trade Talks, Official
Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   The Bush administration will consider
including problems of drugs and migration in free-trade talks with
Mexico, U.S. Trade Representative Carla A. Hills told congressmen
Thursday.
   She said Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, who deals with
illegal migration, and William J. Bennett, head of the Office of
National Drug Control Policy, had been in on recent talks with
Mexican officials.
   ``They were heartened by the kind of cooperation they got,'' she
said.
   ``I think that two areas where we will benefit from the free
trade agreement in the drugs area is by the creation of jobs and
opportunities. There will be less reason to turn to drugs as a
means of well-being, and cooperation is enhanced where you have a
good economic relationship between governments,'' Hills said in
testimony before the House Ways and Means subcommittee on trade.
   She was pressed by Rep. Frank J. Guarini, D-N.J., whose district
is just across the Hudson River from New York City, where drugs and
migration are major problems.
   ``Why not put them on the table at this point?'' he asked. ``Why
miss this opportunity?''
   He suggested that Thornburgh and Bennett join in the free trade
talks, agreed to earlier this week by President Bush and Mexican
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
   ``Well, we'll consider that,'' Hills said. ``There are so many
problems you could have quite a table and...
   ``I know. But what an opportunity, what an opportunity to become
better neighbors,'' Guarini interrupted.
   Rep. Charles B. Rangel, D-N.Y., also pressed Hills on the drug
issue.
   ``To have it inferred that a threat to our national security
would not be on the table as we talk with our friends who are
joining us in trying to prevent the hundreds of tons of opium,
marijuana and cocaine that are pouring across this border, to me
would be sending a wrong message to our friends in Mexico,'' he
said.
   Hills said she intends to work with Congress on the trade talks,
which she said would begin in earnest next year.
   Her prepared testimony mentioned neither drugs nor migration.
She reviewed and praised President Salinas' new economic policies
but said liberalization could go further by:
   _Further lowering of Mexican tariffs and other barriers to
imports.
   _Passage of laws favorable to foreign investment, rather than
present regulations.
   _Greater opening by Mexico to activity of foreign firms in
banking, securities, insurance and transport.
   _Changes in Mexican patent and copyright laws to protect foreign
rights.

   He's one of their highest officers, but
some National Organization for Women members suspect Dave Stewart
is like the wolf dressed in grandma's clothing trying to trick
Little Red Riding Hood.
   ``I think David knows that anytime he meets new women, there's a
certain suspicion,'' admitted Kathy Sandrock of Bettendorf, former
president of the Quad-City NOW Chapter. ``There's a hint of,
`What's he doing here? How can he know our issues?'''
   But one after another, Stewart has knocked down those suspicions
and last month he was elected to a seat on NOW's 30-member
governing board, representing the Prairie States region of Iowa,
Minnesota, Nebraska and the Dakotas. There is only one other man on
the board, John Katz, representing the Washington, D.C., area.
   ``I don't have any personal goals,'' he said in a telephone
interview from his home in Davenport. ``My goals are NOW's goals. I
didn't use my sex to get elected. ... When you're involved as long
as I have been, you prove your point that you're not involved for
the fun of it, not just there to have friends and parties. After a
while, your sex becomes moot. They can see you're not a flash in
the pan.''
   As for the suspicions, Ms. Sandrock said Stewart puts most wary
women at ease within minutes.
   ``He debunks the suspicions within 10, 15 minutes,'' she said.
``He has never treated anybody with less than respect. There are
still some women who resent him, but they're the women who have
been so mistreated and abused by the system that the only way they
can translate it is that men are bad.''
   She said Stewart handles these women with patience, asking only
to be heard.
   Stewart, 33, joined NOW in 1982 and became active in the drive
to ratify the national Equal Rights Amendment, which eventually
failed.
   ``For many people, that was burn-out time, but since I was new,
I just stayed involved,'' he explained.
   Before his NOW days, Stewart was active in campus issues at
Western Illinois University in Macomb. It was the ERA that drew his
interest to NOW. ``It just made such common sense; I couldn't see
the controversy.''
   Stewart predicts the ERA will rise again, but he is now
concentrating on preserving abortion rights.
   Stewart said he never thought it unusual to pursue feminist
issues with one of the more outspoken women's groups, saying that
it's important for people to act on their beliefs.
   ``Some men might say, `Well, I couldn't join that group.' And I
say, `If you agree with their issues, you should walk your talk.'
That's why my bumper sticker says, `Walk Your Talk,''' he said.
   Past chapter president Nita Eagle-Frink of Rock Island, Ill.,
said Stewart has convinced even the more skeptical members that he
is sincere.
   She said Stewart does have to be coached now and then. For
instance, he once said he liked the annual Sports Illustrated
swimsuit issue, she said.
   ``We'd say, `Oh, David,' Ms. Sandrock said. ```OK, David, here's
why we don't do that.'
   ``But he took it with grace.''
   Aside from his NOW activities, Stewart works at a group home
where he counsels adults with physical and mental disabilities. He
is single.
   ``I've got two cats, 13 plants and NOW. There's no time for
anything else,'' he said.

<HEAD>After 40 Years, Beetle Bailey Wins Over The Army</HEAD>

   Beetle Bailey, the lazy but lovable GI who has
stumbled through comic pages for the past 40 years, finally won an
admiring salute Thursday from the U.S. Army.
   In a Flag Day ceremony at the Pentagon, cartoonist Mort Walker
received a framed ``certificate of appreciation for patriotic
civilian service'' from Brig. Gen. Bill McClain, who declared an
armistice in the Army's decades-old hostilities against the
slovenly buck private.
   ``Through it all, you have entertained us, although sometimes we
haven't always liked it,'' said McClain, the Army's public affairs
chief. He observed: ``If you can't laugh at yourself, something is
intrinsically wrong with you.''
   Tongue in cheek, Walker replied that it was always ``the dream
of Gen. Halftrack and mine to hear from the Pentagon,'' and it took
40 years to get the call.
   ``I can't believe I'm actually here,'' Walker said. ``As hard as
it is to find anything in the Pentagon, they finally found a sense
of humor.''
   Since Walker created the popular comic strip in 1950, based on
his experiences as an Army draftee in World War II, Beetle Bailey
and his cartoon friends have annoyed some Pentagon brass who
complained they presented an unflattering image of Army life.
   In 1954, the Tokyo edition of The Stars and Stripes military
newspaper drummed Beetle off its pages because the strip poked fun
at officers. The official explanation was that ``Beetle Bailey had
a low interest value,'' but the move was denounced in newspaper
editorials as silly.
   Stars and Stripes banned the strip again in 1970, as did some
Southern newspapers, when Walker introduced Lt. Flap, a feisty
black character. Miss Buxley, the bosomy secretary to Gen.
Halftrack, drew protests from feminists.
   Putting the controversy behind, the Army heaped praise on Walker
in its citation Thursday.
   ``His ingenuity in portraying Army members in a humorous manner
has contributed significantly to the morale of our soldiers as they
provide for our national security,'' it read.
   ``I read it and laugh at it, and others do, too,'' McClain
confessed afterward. Said Maj. Gen. Richard E. Stephenson, who
attended the ceremony: ``Beetle Bailey is the vehicle that enables
us to see the lighter side of our profession and keeps us from
taking ourselves too seriously.''
   Accompanied by life-size Beetle and Sarge characters, Walker
gave Army officials a cartoon diorama based on his special Flag Day
strip. It appeared Thursday in the more than 1,800 newspapers
worldwide that carry Beetle Bailey. The diorama will hang on
permanent display in a Pentagon hallway near the main entrance.
   While the Beetle and Sarge characters roamed the corridors
waving to Pentagon secretaries and taking salutes from passing
generals and admirals, Walker was a guest at a cake-cutting
ceremony in the Pentagon's inner courtyard marking the 215th
birthday of the U.S. Army on Thursday.

   Two cows were stuck in a 25-foot-deep
sinkhole for six hours until crews using a crane rescued them
Thursday, authorities said.
   ``They mooed some but they didn't seem to be distracted in any
way,'' said Alachua County spokesman Steve Russell.
   County emergency workers, volunteer firefighters, paramedics and
a veterinarian spent six hours trying to figure out how to get the
cows out.
   Until the crane pulled them out, the cows were given hay and
water to keep them calm.
   The cows' owner was walking around his pasture Wednesday night
when he found a 10-foot wide sinkhole and spotted his cows in it.
   ``We have had sinkholes before ... but to my knowledge, I don't
remember a sinkhole with two cows,'' Russell said.
   ``They were just in the pasture and they happened to go. They
were in the wrong place at the wrong time.''

   She's gone from co-star to girlfriend, but
actress Nicole Kidman isn't kissing and telling about beau Tom
Cruise.
   Miss Kidman co-stars in Cruise's ``Days of Thunder,'' a

Oscars ceremonies with him in the wake of his marital split with
actress Mimi Rogers.
   But the Australian-born actress isn't boasting about her

best actor in ``Born on the Fourth of July.''
   ``There's nothing more to say except, yeah, we're together,''
the actress tells Rolling Stone in its July 12 issue.
   She says she and Cruise have gone skydiving but she doesn't
share his passion for the automotive world. Cruise has driven
competitively, and he portrays a race car driver in ``Days of
Thunder.''
   ``I'm not a very good driver,'' she said. ``There's a scene in

   ``Gonzo'' journalist Hunter S. Thompson was more
than fashionably late to a free-form ``lecture,'' but the packed
house that waited for him didn't care.
   The irreverent writer and syndicated columnist arrived two hours
late before fielding questions Wednesday from a feisty crowd of 700
who paid $17.50 each for an evening with the literary anti-hero.
   He was asked about his recent court case in Colorado that
started when a former X-rated film producer accused him of sexual
assault.
   ``I wouldn't have taken her to a concert around the corner,'' he
said.
   All charges were dropped in that case last month.
   Thompson, the author of ``Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,''
``The Great Shark Hunt,'' and ``Generations of Swine: Tales of
Shame and Degradation in the '80s,'' was introduced by longtime
friend C. David Burgin, editor in chief of The Houston Post.
   Thompson's lecture never materialized in a conventional sense.
He ranted for a few moments about American youth and then opened up
the evening to questions.

   Actress Suzanne Somers told lawmakers that
alcoholism crushed her self-esteem as a child and would have made
her entertainment career impossible had she not sought professional
help.
   ``If you don't feel good about yourself, you can't win,'' Miss
Somers told the House Subcommittee on Substance Abuse on Wednesday.
She urged them to create programs to help children of alcoholics
seek treatment.
   She said she and members of her family would cower in a locked
closet during her father's drunken rages. She said she would dream
of being on stage entertaining an audience to shut out her father's
screaming.
   ``I remember every crazy violent night,'' she said. ``I remember
every time he hit my mother, and I remember every time he hit me. I
remember walking home from school and seeing my father passed out
on a street corner.''
   The anti-alcoholism crusader and star of TV's old ``Three's
Company,'' wrote ``Keeping Secrets'' two years ago. The book tells
about her life as the child of an alcoholic and how her family
changed because of treatment programs.

   Donald Trump's casino tour for tennis
star Gabriela Sabatini broke state gaming rules because she's too
young to go into the pit, but no action is planned against him,
authorities said.
   The Argentinian athlete was 19 when Trump led her on a tour of
the Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino in September. Visitors to casino
gambling areas must be 21, but officials said no one is complaining.
   ``If we get a legitimate complaint, we'll investigate it,'' said
Wayne Marlin, spokesman for New Jersey's Division of Gaming
Enforcement.
   A casino official who spoke on condition of anonymity said Ms.
Sabatini had not gambled. The official said Trump merely showed her
around the casino.
   Trump aide Norma Foerderer said the Manhattan developer and
casino owner would not comment on the incident, first reported
Wednesday by the New York Post.
   The casino tour came after Ms. Sabatini, now 20, lost a U.S.
Open match in New York, Casino Control Commission spokesman Tom
Flynn said Wednesday.

   The governor's husband is the author of a
cookbook but he lost the not-so-coveted title of ``His Blinding
Magnificence, the King of Cornhusker Cookery'' in a cookoff on main
street.
   The spoof culinary showdown pitted Bill Orr, husband of Gov. Kay
Orr and author of ``The First Gentleman's Cookbook,'' against Roger
Welsch, a regular contributor on CBS' ``Sunday Morning.''
   Welsch first named Orr the Cornhusker cooking king and promptly
challenged him for the title.
   The challenger provided both competitors' entries, offering a
plump mesquite-broiled steak for himself, while Orr was judged on a
scrawny piece of meat spotted with green food coloring and
accompanied by a pail of cow chips as seasonings.
   ``I came in a close second while Welsch finished next to last,''
Orr said after the gag Wednesday.
   Proceeds from Orr's book are being used for a planned remodeling
of the governor's mansion.

   The Dance Theater of Harlem, the ballet company
that canceled two tours this year because a financial crisis,
received a $1 million conditional grant Thursday.
   The Lila Wallace-Reader's Digest Fund will give $600,000 to help
reduce the company's deficit and $400,000 for dancers' salaries and
company operations _ provided the company raises additional funds
by Sept. 30, the end of its fiscal year, said M. Christine DeVita,
president of the fund.
   Officials declined to say how much money the company needed to
raise.
   In January, after two tours by the company were canceled, the
board voted to cancel the New York season and lay off 51 dancers.
   ``The Dance Theater of Harlem is a world-class ballet company
and clearly a national treasure,'' DeVita said. ``Given the fund's
interest in building bridges between artists and communities, we
would be remiss if we did not come forward to help DTH.''
   The Dance Theater of Harlem was the first American ballet
company to tour the Soviet Union and for two decades it has
performed on stages around the world.
   Its artistic director is Arthur Mitchell, former principal
dancer with the New York City Ballet.

<HEAD>Gov't Vetoes Public Funds for High Speed Rail Link</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   The government on Thursday said it would not pay
for a proposed multibillion-dollar, high-speed rail link between
London and an English Channel tunnel.
   The decision, announced in the House of Commons by Transport
Secretary Cecil Parkinson, cast doubt on whether such a link to the
capital would be built in Britain. One is being built in France.
   Critics say failure to construct such a line would hurt
Britain's trade prospects with the Continent and increase the
misery of tens of millions of commuters who will have to share
already crowded roads and trains with millions more foreign
visitors.
   Parkinson said the link's builders, European Rail Link, have
declined to proceed without public money. Rail Link is led by
government-owned British Rail, but Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher
hopes to privatize the railway.
   The opposition Labor Party attacked the government's decision.
   ``Britain will enter the 21st century with an inadequate 19th
century railway link,'' Labor lawmaker John Prescott said.
   France already is building a high-speed link from Paris to
Calais, which will hook up the tunnel's freight and passenger
traffic to a high-speed system being planned across Europe.
   The French railways SNCF last year offered to help finance a
British high-speed rail link from London to Folkestone. British
Rail currently is negotiating with that company, the British Rail
spokesman said.
   In addition, European Rail Link had sought about $600 million in
public funds toward the project in return for commuter use of the
new line.
   British Rail has not publicly announced how much a link would
cost, but estimates put the price tag at $4.4 billion to $6.2
billion.
   One reason the French are more enthusiastic is that their tunnel
entrance is in one of the most depressed areas of France. The
British end is in England's rural and prosperous southeast.
   Many Britons cling to their insularity and are ambivalent toward
``the Chunnel,'' which some think would allow an invasion of
England.
   Mrs. Thatcher defended her Cabinet's decision, telling the House
of Commons that British legislation prohibits the government from
subsidizing international travel links.
   Mrs. Thatcher said the government already was spending $3.4
billion on roads and railways to and from the tunnel.
   The veto is another blow for the beleaguered Anglo-French
consortium which is building the 31-mile rail tunnel under the
English Channel entirely with private funds.
   Eurotunnel has suffered from soaring costs, which are forcing it
to seek extra funding from its banks and shareholders. The latest
cost estimate is $13.1 billion.
   The tunnel is still targeted to open in June 1993.
   When finished, Eurotunnel will carry passengers from London to
Paris in about three hours, about the same time as an air flight _
inlcuding time getting to and from the airport _ and half the time
of a car-ferry journey.

<HEAD>Federal Agents Investigate Walrus Kills off Alaska</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Federal investigators are looking into
what appears to be poaching and mutilation of walruses for ivory in
the Bering Sea.
   Officials first learned of the kills Tuesday after Coast Guard
safety inspectors boarded a fishing boat that recently had returned
to port from the Bering Sea herring fishery. They found two walrus
skulls and two sets of tusks aboard.
   ``They were in the process of cleaning them out, boiling them,''
said Coast Guard Chief Petty Officer Ed Moore.
   The evidence has been turned over to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife
Service.
   A second seizure of walrus remains was reported Wednesday by a
Coast Guard boarding group after a safety inspection of the fishing
vessel Maverick.
   Both seizures were made at Naknek, a port city about 300 miles
southwest of Anchorage, where the Coast Guard had set up a
temporary safety inspection detachment.
   According to the Coast Guard, Maverick skipper Delton Repnow
said walrus parts were retrieved after they were found floating in
the water.
   And Steven J. Hansen, the skipper of the first vessel, the
tender Chichigoff, told investigators that on June 4 his vessel
found a dozen walrus carcasses floating about 40 miles south of
Nome in Norton Sound.
   Ten walrus carcasses were headless and two still had their
heads, said Walter E. Soroka, a fish and wildlife field supervisor.
   In the process of cleaning the heads and removing the tusks, the
crewmen found at least one small-caliber bullet in one of the
walruses, officials said.
   Crew members told the Coast Guard they thought they legally
could keep the walrus ivory and had intended to report their find
as required by law. The Coast Guard said discovery of the carcasses
had been entered in the vessel's log book.
   The Marine Mammal Protection Act makes it a federal crime to
recover ivory from walruses found at sea, Soroka said. It is legal
to recover walrus carcasses found on shorelines.
   Eskimos and other Alaska natives are allowed to hunt walruses
for subsistence use, but cutting off walrus heads and leaving the
rest of the carcass is illegal, even for natives, said Soroka.
   ``We don't know who removed the heads,'' he said. ``We plan to
find out. That's something that we look at seriously.''
   Soroka said Hansen has cooperated in the investigation. ``He
contacted me. ... He told me he misconstrued the laws,'' Soroka
said.
   Robert Brophy, president of Seattle-based Icicle Seafoods Inc.,
the owner of the vessel, said he doubted his employees
intentionally broke the law.
   Walrus ivory is used in Alaska and around the world as a craft
substitute for elephant ivory. With the recent crackdown on illegal
elephant hunting in Africa, Alaska ivory has become more popular
among carvers.
   Penalties for poaching are strict. If the crew of a fishing
vessel is found to have been poaching walruses, the government may
seize the vessel, Soroka said. Individuals convicted of violating
the Marine Mammal Protection Act face up to a year in prison and
$100,000 fine.

<HEAD>A New Monument for the City of Monuments</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   This city of monuments, statues and memorials
has a new attraction to stir the emotions and evoke the glories of
the past.
   This newest of Washington's monuments, 22 of the original 24
columns from the U.S. Capitol, literally had to be pulled from the
mud of the Anacostia River and painstakingly stripped of 35 coats
of white paint.
   Now, after a mighty effort by a few people, the columns stand on
the highest point of a great meadow at the National Arboretum,
cleaned up, repaired and splendid again, holding up nothing but sky
and glory. Set between the columns are 500 marble slabs once used
as steps on the Senate wing of the Capitol.
   In the middle of all this is a small fountain, from which water
flows into a reflecting pool designed so that the full image of the
columns is mirrored in the water.
   The National Capitol Columns, as they are called, were dedicated
Wednesday with all the pomp due a newborn shrine. The Air Force
Band played, an all-service color guard presented the flag, the
president sent a message and heat put the audience into a patriotic
sweat.
   ``It is most fitting that the columns will have a permanent new
home,'' said Clayton Yeutter, the secretary of agriculture. ``They
are a spectacular addition to the scenery of our great city.''
   Bill Allen, architectural historian of the Capitol, was on hand
to supply the history of the 10-ton sandstone columns _ and a long
one they have had. Twenty-seven presidents, from Martin van Buren
to Dwight D. Eisenhower, took the oath of office in their shadow.
   When they were first installed on the east front of the Capitol
in 1826, congressmen left their benches to help pull the ``strong
carriage'' on which the columns had been placed up Capitol Hill.
   The columns were the finishing touch to the rebuilding of the
Capitol after the British burned the House and Senate wings in
1814. The columns were put between the two wings, in the rotunda,
which was completed in 1824.
   Sam Rayburn, the longtime speaker of the House, went out of the
Capitol every evening to look at and be inspired by the columns,
which are unadorned except for acanthus leaves carved into the caps.
   The columns were the principal feature of the Capitol until a
new front was put on in 1958 and completed just in time for John F.
Kennedy's inauguration in 1961.
   The columns, replaced by bigger ones made of marble, were
unceremoniously taken to the Capitol power plant and lay there for
15 years. In 1973, they were trucked to the banks of the Anacostia
River and left to sink in the mud.
   A determined woman, Ethel Garrett, campaigned for more than 20
years to have the columns put on public display at the arboretum.
She died without seeing her plan come to fruition.
   Betty Rae, chairman of the project, said all of the nearly $2
million spent on the project was raised from private donors, many
of whom were at the ceremony Wednesday.
   The columns ``will draw people to the arboretum who never would
have come to the arboretum,'' she said. The National Arboretum, 300
acres of great trees and shrubs, is one of Washington's best-kept
secrets, located miles away from the city's more famous attractions.

<HEAD>White House Phone Lines Jammed After Baker Gives Out Number</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Calls swamped the White House switchboard
after Secretary of State James A. Baker's public entreaty for
Israeli officials to call the number ``when you're serious about
peace,'' a spokesman said Thursday.
   Baker publicly gave out the number during a Senate committee
hearing on Wednesday, and by the end of the day, some 6,000 to
8,000 calls had clogged the White House lines, said President
Bush's press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater.
   ``The switchboard was finally blocked to the point where it
couldn't handle it anymore. And they had to put it on automatic
thank-you tape,'' Fitzwater told reporters.
   On Thursday, the call volume remained heavy.
   It took 24 rings for a switchboard operator to answer one call.
``It's busy here today,'' she acknowledged.
   Baker, whose State Department office is at a different location
and different phone number, sent flowers Thursday to the operators,
his spokeswoman, Margaret Tutwiler said.
   Although Baker's remark about the telephone number came during a
discussion of Israel, Tutwiler made the point that at several times
in his testimony he referred to the ``parties'' in the peace
process, in the plural.
   As to whether Baker intended to pinpoint the Israeli government,
she said, he ``intended the phone number to be used by all.''
   Asked if the Bush administration questions whether Israel wants
peace, Fitzwater said, ``We have not yet seen the dialogues start,
so there is a question, certainly, on both sides.''
   Baker sarcastically recited the White House number, 202
456-1414, in the Senate hearing where he bluntly prodded Israel on
its commitment to peacefully settling the Mideast turmoil.
   Asked about giving out that number instead of his own, Baker
told reporters on Thursday, ``I worked over here four years and I
had that one memorized.''
   Baker was chief of staff to President Reagan.
   He said in his testimony Wednesday that his message to
``everybody over there,'' was ``when you're serious about peace,
call us.''
   But the Israeli government did not call, said Fitzwater.
   Instead, the broadcast of Baker's remarks on television and
radio news brought thousands of calls from the public, wanting to
talk ``all over the issue on all sides.''
   Typically, the switchboard might get 100 or 200 calls in the
time period that saw thousands after Baker's Wednesday comments.
   An Israeli reporter, Yaacov Eilon, said the White House operator
who answered his call on Wednesday said, ``You would have to call
the State Department. ... That number is 647-4000.''

<HEAD>Plane Slips Past Border Guards to Leave Flowers for Gorbachev</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   As flower deliveries go, it was spectacular.
   A light plane swooped from the Soviet sky without warning and
dropped off flowers for President Mikhail S. Gorbachev at an
airport near Turkey before zipping back across the frontier, Soviet
media said Thursday.
   Clearly, at least some Soviets have gained a sense of humor
since a 19-year-old West German youth buzzed the Kremlin and landed
his Cessna on Red Square before startled KGB guards in May 1988.
   That young man, Mathias Rust, spent 14 months in a Soviet prison
after the photo of his plane in front of St. Basil's Cathedral made
front pages around the world. Soviet authorities fired their
defense minister and air defense chief after Rust flew from Finland
to Moscow undetected.
   The latest incident was reported in a mocking article in
Izvestia under the headline, ``Rust Number Two?''
   Izvestia and Tass, quoting the labor newspaper Trud, said that
on June 9, a Cessna sneaked into Soviet airspace undetected by
flying barely 600 feet above the mountainous southern border with
Turkey.
   It touched down at the Batumi municipal airport for less than 40
seconds, just long enough to drop off a bouquet of carnations,
greetings for Gorbachev, and a $20 bill.
   ``We Germans are very grateful to him,'' said the note to
Gorbachev. The author signed the note, ``Hans Schneider.''
   The Ministry of Defense said air defenses ``did not act,''
Izvestia reported.
   ``Translating this into simple language, we dare to say this
means they failed to notice him,'' the newspaper concluded. ``Thank
God, the second Rust had enough tact not to land at a military
base!''
   Trud said border guards and air defenders failed to coordinate
their actions. It said helicopters should have been sent after the
plane.
   ``After all, he is still a violator, even though he has an
excellent sense of humor,'' Trud said.

<HEAD>Soviet Legislature Delays Increase in Bread Price</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAREY GOLDBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The legislature ordered a two-month delay Thursday
in an unpopular threefold increase in bread prices, a centerpiece
of Mikhail S. Gorbachev's market reforms.
   The Supreme Soviet voted 319-33 that the government should
produce another version of the plan in September, easing the effect
of price increases. Bread prices, the staple of the Soviet diet,
would have increased July 1.
   Gorbachev had indicated the price increase was a test of the
Soviet Union's willingness to tolerate a free market. It was
intended to help pay the cost of recently increased payments to
grain farmers.
   The increase was part of an economic program that touched off
panic buying in Moscow and led the capital's government to require
proof of residence before allowing purchases.
   Lawmakers rejected the measure because of its great unpopularity
among voters, said one deputy, Alexei Boiko, a member of the
committee that examined government proposals on economic reform.
   ``The people have been cheated more than once, they're
mistrustful, and they feared they would be cheated again,'' he said.
   Boiko said delegates from poor regions of Central Asia, where
consumption of bread is particularly high, ``are really afraid.
They're worried that this will give rise to real discontent.''
   He said the decision also was influenced by violent ethnic
clashes _ fueled by poverty _ in Central Asia. In the republic of
Kirghizia, 155 people died in ethnic fighting in the past two
weeks, the Soviet Interior Ministry said.
   Government officials had promised that all $28 billion brought
in by the price increase would be handed back to consumers through
compensation programs. However, officials acknowledged they had not
fully worked out such programs.
   The bread price increase was one of the most visible and
controversial aspects of the economic program, presented to the
Supreme Soviet by Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov last month.
   On Wednesday, the Supreme Soviet gave Gorbachev a mandate to
speed economic reforms. It said the government had until October to
prepare more radical measures to move the country toward a market
economy.
   The July 1 price increases would have applied to all grain-based
products, including pasta. Soviet bread comes in dozens of
varieties and is virtually the only foodstuff that is almost always
readily available without long lines.
   It remains extremely cheap at less than 33 cents a loaf.
   Gorbachev has said that bread is so cheap children sometimes use
loaves for soccer balls. At the same time, the country spends its
scarce foreign currency to buy grain from foreign countries.
   One deputy said that because prices paid to grain farmers
already have been raised, keeping bread prices constant would swell
the government budget deficit.
   But the lawmakers, rushing toward a summer adjournment with
several other pieces of major legislation still pending, voted
against lowering the price to producers again. The producer price
increase will provide farmers with an additional $15 billion.

   The Soviet Union, which has repeatedly balked
at allowing the entry of U.S. labor leaders, has issued visas for
two AFL-CIO representatives, Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole said
Thursday.
   Soviet Labor Minister V.I. Shcherbakov agreed to the visas after
a private meeting with Mrs. Dole in Geneva, Switzerland, Mrs.
Dole's office said. They were in Geneva for the annual
International Labor Organization meeting.
   Dick Wilson, the AFL-CIO's coordinator of Central and Eastern
European affairs, and John J. Banovic, secretary treasurer of the
United Mine Workers, become the first AFL-CIO representatives to
ever officially visit the Soviet Union. They plan to meet with
Soviet independent mine workers.
   The Soviet government has still refused AFL-CIO President Lane
Kirkland's official delegation request. Kirkland also had sought
visas for Lynn Williams, president of the United Steelworkers of
America, and Al Shanker, president of the American Federation of
Teachers.
   The AFL-CIO, which represents 14.2 million Americans belonging
to 90 U.S. trade unions, has been a longtime critic of the Soviet
Union.
   ``We don't know that one granting of visas will make a policy.
It certainly is a step in the right direction. We hope it is the
start of a free and open relationship,'' said AFL-CIO spokesman Rex
Hardesty.
   Mrs. Dole said Wilson and Banovic left for the Soviet Union
immediately after the visas were granted Wednesday.
   ``Their sole purpose is to talk to Soviet workers about the free
trade union movement _ not to foment unrest,'' Mrs. Dole said in a
statement.
   Earlier this year, the AFL-CIO hosted a month-long visit by nine
Soviet miners trying to form independent unions.
   Kirkland has compared the struggle of Soviet miners to that of
Solidarity organizers in Poland in the early 1980s. He pledged to
offer the federation's support, even if it meant defying the Soviet
government.
   The AFL-CIO's support of Solidarity included the smuggling of
printing and other communications equipment into Poland when
Solidarity was outlawed. In all, the federation gave about $5
million worth of equipment and other assistance to Solidarity.

   Here are excerpts from the Supreme Court's
decision that said police do not violate motorists' privacy rights
by stopping them at sobriety checkpoints.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   From Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist's opinion for the
majority:
   This case poses the question whether a state's use of highway
sobriety checkpoints violates the Fourth and 14th Amendments to the
U.S. Constitution. We hold that it does not and therefore reverse
the contrary holding of the Court of Appeals of Michigan.
   No one can seriously dispute the magnitude of the drunken
driving problem or the states' interest in eradicating it. Media
reports of alcohol-related death and mutilation on the nation's
roads are legion. The anecdotal is confirmed by the statistical.
   Drunken drivers cause an annual death toll of over 25,000 and in
the same time span cause nearly one million personal injuries and
more than $5 billion in property damage.
   Conversely, the weight bearing on the other scale _ the measure
of the intrusion on motorists stopped briefly at sobriety
checkpoints _ is slight. We reached a similar conclusion as to the
intrusion on motorists subjected to a brief stop at a highway
checkpoint for detecting illegal aliens (in a 1976 ruling).
   Experts in police science might disagree over which of several
methods of apprehending drunken drivers is preferable as an ideal.
But for purposes of Fourth Amendment analysis, the choice among
such reasonable alternatives remains with the governmental
officials who have a unique understanding of, and a responsibility
for, limited public resources, including a finite number of police
officers.
   In sum, the balance of the state's interest in preventing
drunken driving, the extent to which this system can reasonably be
said to advance that interest, and the degree of intrusion upon
individual motorists who are briefly stopped weighs in favor of the
state program. We therefore hold that it is consistent with the
Fourth Amendment.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   From Justice Harry A. Blackmun's concurring opinion:
   I concur only in the judgment.
   I fully agree with the court's lamentations about the slaughter
on our highways and about the dangers posed to almost everyone by
the driver who is under the influence of alcohol or other drug.
   I add this comment only to remind the court that it has been
almost 20 years since in (a 1971 ruling) I noted that the slaughter
on the highways of this nation exceeds the death toll of all our
wars.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   From Justice William J. Brennan's dissenting opinion:
   I do not dispute the immense social cost caused by drunken
drivers, nor do I slight the government's efforts to prevent such
tragic losses.
   Indeed, I would hazard a guess that today's opinion will be
received favorably by a majority of our society, who would
willingly suffer the minimal intrusion of a sobriety checkpoint
stop in order to prevent drunken driving. But consensus that a
particular law enforcement technique serves a laudable purpose has
never been the touchstone of constitutional analysis.
   The Fourth Amendment rests on the principle that a true balance
between the individual and society depends on the recognition of
the right to be let alone _ the most comprehensive of rights and
the right most valued by civilized men.
   In the face of the `momentary evil' of drunken driving, the
court today abdicates its role as the protector of that fundamental
right.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   From Justice John Paul Stevens' dissenting opinion:
   The court overvalues the law enforcement interest in using
sobriety checkpoints, undervalues the citizen's interest in freedom
from random, unannounced investigatory seizures and mistakenly
assumes that there is virtually no difference between a routine
stop at a permanent, fixed checkpoint (as was at issue in the 1976
ruling involving aliens) and a surprise stop at a sobriety
checkpoint.
   In my opinion, unannounced investigatory seizures are,
particularly when they take place at night, the hallmark of regimes
far different from ours; the surprise intrusion upon individual
liberty is not minimal.
   The most disturbing aspect of the court's decision today is that
it appears to give no weight to the citizen's interest in freedom
from unannounced investigatory seizures. The decision that seems
diaphanous today may be intolerable tomorrow.
   Sobriety checkpoints are elaborate, and disquieting, publicity
stunts. The net effect of sobriety checkpoints on traffic safety is
infinitesimal and possibly negative.
   This is a case that is driven by nothing more than symbolic
state action _ an insufficient justification for an otherwise
unreasonable program of random seizures. Unfortunately, the court
is transfixed by the wrong symbol _ the illusory prospect of
punishing countless intoxicated motorists _ when it should keep its
eye on the road plainly marked by the Constitution.

<TEXT>
   President Bush and Thailand's Prime Minister
Chatichai Choonhavan agreed Thursday to a new Cabinet-level
committee to defuse trade disputes and promised to press for free
elections in war-torn Cambodia under the U.N. flag.
   The two leaders emerged from nearly 2{ hours of talks and a
luncheon at the White House promising to work together to stem both
the U.S. thirst for drugs and their flow from Southeast Asia.
   The visit from the leader of what Bush called ``one of America's
oldest friends and closest allies'' came at a time of intensified
diplomatic efforts to bring peace to Cambodia.
   Four different factions are fighting to topple the Cambodian
government of Hun Sen, installed by Vietnamese invaders in 1978.
   Bush said the common U.S.-Thai aim is to assure the Cambodia
people ``genuine self-determination through free and fair elections
under U.N. auspices and in the presence of an international
peacekeeping force.''
   ``We will do all we can to accelerate the on-going peace
process,'' said Chatichai, adding that ``we are prepared to work''
with the U.N. Security Council on a peace initiative.
   Bush said the two countries' commerce ministers will form a
Joint U.S.-Thai Committee for Commercial Cooperation to promote
trade.
   Chatichai said its aim will be to establish ``a new framework
for economic cooperation ... (that) would allow us to regularly
discuss any potential trade issues before they become trade
disputes.''
   Thailand is on the U.S. trade representative's ``priority watch
list'' for pirating products from computer software to Hollywood
videotapes to pharmaceuticals.
   The United States retaliates with duties on $165 million of Thai
products.
   Thailand is leading an economic resurgence in Southeast Asia,
and its 10.7 percent growth in 1989 was the fastest in the world.
   Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia Richard Solomon said
Chatichai asked Bush to help convince the Chinese to stop arming
the Khmer Rouge, the communists blamed for the genocide of 1
million Cambodians during their bloody rule in 1975-78.
   Bush told Chatichai the United States remains strongly opposed
to any role for the Khmer Rouge in a possible coalition government
in Phnom Penh.
   Thailand recently helped arrange talks in Tokyo between Prince
Sihanouk and Hun Sen, installed as head of Cambodia's government
after the Vietnamese invasion in 1978.
   Bush expressed ``profound appreciation'' for Thailand's
providing asylum to Indochinese refugees, and assured Chatichai the
United States will welcome ``our share of Vietnamese refugees.''
   Chatichai, whose country is the transit point for half the
heroin reaching the United States from Burma and Laos, pledged
``the full support of the Thai government in the war against drug
trafficking.''

<TEXT>
   Pre-glasnost Soviet propaganda posters will be
displayed on Capitol Hill later this month as a reminder of the
anti-Semitism that still pervades Soviet society, exhibition
sponsors said Thursday.
   More than two dozen anti-American and anti-Jewish posters,
cartoons and other materials collected secretly by Evgeny Lein and
his wife, Irina, two prominent ``refuseniks'' from Leningrad, will
be exhibited June 25-26 in the foyer of the Rayburn House Office
Building.
   The materials, published mostly in the early 1980s, were
secretly brought to the United States two years ago by Abraham
Sofaer.
   Sofaer, outgoing legal adviser to the State Department, and his
wife, Marian, are friends of the Leins. The Soviet couple were
allowed to emigrate to Israel last December after a decade-long
fight.
   Rep. James Scheuer, D-N.Y., a congressional sponsor of the
exhibit, told a news conference that the documents betray a deep,
persistent strain of anti-Semitism in the Soviet Union that is
flourishing under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's glasnost policy
of openness.
   In the 70 years since the Communists seized power in Moscow,
Scheuer said, the Soviet government has ``adroitly and cynically
manipulated the anti-Semitic genes'' of its people through
state-subsidized propaganda materials.
   He said he hoped President Bush and Secretary of State James A.
Baker III would urge Gorbachev to denounce anti-Semitism and allow
the Soviet Union to become ``a cradle for nurturing freedom'' for
all its people.
   One poster, published in 1982 and titled ``Zionism _ Today's
Fascism,'' shows the skeleton of Adolf Hitler goose-stepping across
the bodies of mutilated Lebanese with a blood-stained Israeli
soldier carring a U.S.-made missile.
   Another poster depicts the CIA using religion and Radio Free
Europe as anti-Soviet tools, with caricatures of a Jew, a Christian
and a CIA agent collaborating as spies.
   Recent additions to the exhibition include two anti-Jewish
cartoons published this year in the magazine of Komsomol, the
Soviet Communist youth organization.
   Mrs. Sofaer, who organized the exhibition with the help of
private donations, said the posters were printed by Soviet
government agencies and sold at subsidized prices in local Soviet
bookstores as part of the government's domestic propaganda effort.

<HEAD>Farm Exports Highest In Five Years, Government Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Exports accounted for more than 18 percent of
last year's U.S. farm production value, the highest rating in five
years, an Agriculture Department report said Thursday.
   The farm value of exports in calendar 1989 was $31.8 billion,
said the report by the department's Economic Research Service.
Farmers had a gross cash income of $174 billion.
   That meant the farm value of exports was 18.3 percent of last
year's gross income, the largest share since 1984 when the farm
export value was $30.4 billion and the gross was $155.3 billion _ a
share of 19.6 percent.
   The indicator dropped after peaking at 24 percent in the early
1980s, reaching a low of 13.8 percent in 1986 and 1987. It rose to
16.5 percent in 1988.
   The report means farmers exported the production of two out of
every five acres last year, matching the record set in 1984.

   A strong earthquake struck a lightly populated
area near the Soviet nuclear test range and the Chinese and
Mongolian borders Thursday, but Soviet authorities reported no
injuries or damages.
   The Defense Ministry denied rumors circulating around the
Semipalatinsk test range that it had exploded a nuclear bomb, the
Soviet news agency Tass reported.
   The Swedish national news agency TT quoted the Seismological
Institute in Uppsala as saying the quake measured 7 on the Richter
scale. That is a major quake, capable of causing widespread, heavy
damage in populated areas.
   The Hong Kong Observatory recorded the quake as a 6.8 on the
open-ended scale, which measures the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by ground motion recorded on a seismograph.
   Tass said the quake was centered 30 miles north of the village
of Zaisan in Kazakhstan, about 1,900 miles southeast of Moscow.
   There were no reports of injuries or damage, according to both
Tass and Sergei Bogdanov, a duty officer at the Communist Party
headquarters in Alma Ata, the Kazakh capital, about 450 miles from
the epicenter.
   The shock was registered 15 miles below the earth's surface,
Tass said.

   A young policeman who was shot by Tamil
separatists and left for dead among the bodies of his colleagues
said Thursday he crawled into the jungle and hid while more
policemen were killed.
   Piyeratna Ranaweera said he was one of 115 policemen who were
captured at Kalmunai police station Monday when the rebels overran
11 police stations in the Eastern Province.
   The fighting, which began Monday, was the worst violence since
negotiations began between the government and the Tigers in May
1989.
   At least 110 government troops have died, but one unconfirmed
report said the Tamil Tiger rebels also killed 125 to 150 policemen
who were among the 600 officers captured. A spokesman for the
Tigers said the report could be anti-rebel propaganda.
   Ranaweera said that all 115 policemen captured with him were
blindfolded and the Tigers took their watches and wallets, tied
their hands and gave them water. They were then taken in three
buses from Kalmunai, 135 miles east of Colombo, to a rebel camp 20
miles to the south.
   Ranaweera, lying in a hospital bed with his broken left arm in a
sling and bloodstained cotton on the bullet wound in his left ear,
said one busload of the captive policemen were taken from the Tiger
camp shortly before midnight Monday.
   ``At 12:45 (that) night they took the second busload again to
the jungle,'' he said in a weak voice.
   He said he was blindfolded when he got off the bus so he could
not see if the men from the first bus were there.
   ``They lined us all up and made us lie on the ground face down
and they opened fire with T-56 rifles. Then they held a torch to
our heads and if they heard a cry they shot again.''
   Ranaweera said the bullet grazed his left ear. The Tigers
apparently thought he was dead and left.
   He said he crawled into the jungle and realised his left arm was
broken and he fixed a sling for it.
   While he was lying in the jungle he heard the third bus arrive
and then he heard more shots. He estimated it was about 3 a.m. He
said he saw no one else alive.
   After the third bus left he started making his way inland
towards government lines but ``I fainted a couple of times. I was
very thirsty. I found a lake with elephans ... and I drank.''
   The young Sinhalese policeman said he came to a small farmer's
hut. ``Some Tamil people were there. I explained what happened but
they left me.''
   About 3 p.m. Tuesday, when he estimated he had walked about 14
miles towards Damana, a Sinhalese-dominated town 18 miles southwest
of Kalmunai, he reached a second hut, he said.
   ``I saw a Sinhalese man and he took me and there were Sinhalese
boys and they took me on a motorcycle to Damana.''
   Ranaweera was admitted to the Government Hospital in Kandy, the
largest town near Damana.
   The spokesman for the Tigers, Dominic, said the mass killings of
policemen ``could have happened or it could be anti-Tiger
propaganda. Communications are difficult and we are trying to find
out what really took place.''
   Dominic, who uses only one name, was speaking to reporters in
the northern town of Jaffna, the headquarters of the Tigers.
   The Tamils, who are mainly Hindu, have been fighting for an
independent nation, claiming discrimination by the majority
Sinhalese, who are mainly Buddhist.
   At least 11,000 people, including 1,200 Indian soldiers sent to
the region as peacekeepers, have been killed in the Tamil war since
it started in 1983.

   Police seeking to curb drunken driving do not
violate motorists' privacy rights by stopping them at sobriety
checkpoints, the Supreme Court ruled Thursday.
   The 6-3 decision upheld Michigan's checkpoint program and, by
extension, similar operations in most states.
   ``The balance of the state's interest in preventing drunken
driving ... and the degree of intrusion upon individual motorists
who are briefly stopped weighs in favor of the state program,''
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist wrote for the court.
   The three dissenters said the decision sacrificed individual
liberty in favor of a police tactic that might not make any
difference in the fight against drunken driving.
   In other decisions, the court:
   _Ruled, 5-4, in a Virginia case that hospitals and nursing homes
may sue in federal court to challenge how a state-run Medicaid
program reimburses their costs.
   _Ruled unanimously in a case from Massachusetts that the federal
government may impose severe fines against air polluters even when
regulators are slow to decide on clean-air proposals.
   _Allowed the Bush administration, by a 5-4 vote in a Virginia
case, to limit how much welfare aid some needy families receive.
   The sobriety-checkpoint ruling was hailed by various groups
seeking greater crackdowns on drunken drivers, but was denounced by
the American Civil Liberties Union.
   Micky Sadoff, national president of Mothers Against Drunk
Driving, called the decision ``a great victory for all of us who
care about the safety of our loved ones on the highways.''
   The chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, also
applauded the ruling but said, ``More needs to be done.'' He called
on states to allow police to confiscate licenses on the spot if
motorists fail or refuse to take chemical tests.
   But the ruling will have no effect in at least one state.
Louisiana State Police said Thursday they are barred from setting
up sobriety checkpoints by their state constitution, which affords
greater individual privacy than does the federal Constitution.
   And police in Michigan may not be able to reinstate their
checkpoint program until a challenge based on that state's
constitution is resolved.
   Nadine Strosser, the ACLU's general counsel, said the ruling
``is fundamentally wrong, both as a matter of constitutional
principle and as a matter of public policy.''
   ``This strikes at the heart of the Fourth Amendment,'' which
bans unreasonable police searches and seizures, Ms. Strosser said.
   Writing for the court, Rehnquist said, ``No one can seriously
dispute the magnitude of the drunken driving problem or the states'
interest in eradicating it.''
   He said drunken drivers ``cause an annual death toll of over
25,000 and in the same time span cause nearly one million personal
injuries and more than $5 billion in property damage.''
   The court's dissenters, however, cited statistics indicating
that those figures have been declining steadily.
   ``Conversely, the weight bearing on the other scale _ the
measure of the intrusion on motorists stopped briefly at sobriety
checkpoints _ is slight,'' Rehnquist said.
   He was joined by Justices Byron R. White, Sandra Day O'Connor,
Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy. Justice Harry A. Blackmun
joined in the result but not in Rehnquist's opinion.
   The decision echoed President Bush's stated concern about
drunken driving.
   ``It's as crippling as crack, as random as gang violence, and
it's killing more kids than both combined,'' the president said
last year as he noted that federal aid was being given to promote
the use of sobriety checkpoints.
   Justices William J. Brennan, Thurgood Marshall and John Paul
Stevens dissented from Thursday's ruling.
   Calling sobriety checkpoints no more than ``elaborate and
disquieting publicity stunts,'' Stevens said the net effect ``on
traffic safety is infinitesimal and possibly negative. This is a
case that is driven by nothing more than symbolic state action _ an
insufficient justification for an otherwise unreasonable program of
random seizures.''
   He added: ``The court is transfixed by the wrong symbol _ the
illusory prospect of punishing countless intoxicated motorists _
when it should keep its eyes on the road plainly marked by the
Constitution.''
   The traditional method police use to identify suspected drunken
drivers is to observe traffic. Determining that method is not
wholly effective, states in recent years began experimenting with
other detection methods.
   In Michigan, police who set up such a checkpoint directed all
traffic headed in one direction to a roadside area where officers
talked to motorists.
   If there was no immediate evidence of intoxication, the motorist
was given a traffic safety brochure and allowed to drive away. The
average delay was about 30 seconds.
   Six Michigan legislators sued state police soon after the
checkpoint program began.
   Michigan courts banned the checkpoints, relying on a 1979
Supreme Court ruling in which the justices said the
constitutionality of a police seizure made without ``probable
cause'' to suspect a crime should be determined by three factors:
   _The gravity of the public concerns being served.
   _How the seizure advances the public interest.
   _The severity of the police interference with individual liberty.
   The court Thursday said the Michigan checkpoint program
satisfies all three factors.

   Britain on Thursday said Hong Kong will have to
forcibly return more Vietnamese boat people to their Communist
homeland unless the United States agrees to house about 9,000 of
the refugees on Guam.
   In the Philippines, the government allowed more than 250 boat
people to debark from U.S. Navy ships only after U.S. and other
foreign officials agreed to resettle them outside the Philippines
within three years.
   Britain, representing its colony Hong Kong, and six Asian
nations are expected soon to warn the U.S. State Department
formally that they will abolish boat people's right to debark
unless they can send the would-be migrants back forcibly.
   Tens of thousands who fled Vietnam since the Communists defeated
ths U.S.-backed South Vietnamese government in 1975 have jammed
refugee centers in neighboring countries.
   ``The United States has a responsibility it can't evade,''
Foreign Office Minister Francis Maude said in an interview.
``Either it joins in the consensus of other nations (on forced
repatriation) ... or it provides an alternative.''
   ``But it is quite indefensible to block the consensus and at the
same time to refuse what one might call an intermediate solution,''
he added, referring to the Guam proposal, which Washington rejected
three weeks ago.
   Maude, however, will press his proposal for U.S.-controlled
holding centers in Guam during a U.S. visit next week.
   Last December, 51 Vietnamese were sent home from the Hong Kong
camps against their will _ bundled on to an aircraft in tearful
scenes that caused an international uproar.
   On Monday, a Philippine envoy delivered a formal warning to the
Vietnamese Foreign Ministry in Hanoi that Britain and the
six-member Association of South East Asian Nations may abolish
landing rights for new arrivals, the Foreign Office said.
   The warning carried no deadline but amounts to an ultimatum that
drastic action may follow. The State Department will get a similar
warning within days.
   The Asian group comprises Brunei, Indonesia, Malayasia, the
Philippines, Singapore and Thailand. Some have warned they will
push boatloads of refugees back out to sea.
   In the Philippines, more than 250 Vietnamese rescued on the high
seas last month by U.S. Navy ships were allowed to leave the ships
Thursday, ending a two-week dispute.
   The Philippine government said it received assurances from the
U.S. ambassador, the British ambassador and the Manila
representative of the U.N. High Commissioner on Refugees that the
refugees will be resettled in another country within three years.
   The issue has been a sensitive one for the U.S. Navy since a
military jury at Subic Bay convicted a Navy captain of dereliction
of duty for turning away a boatload of Vietnamese in the South
China Sea in June 1988. Thirty-one of the Vietnamese died, and
survivors turned to cannibalism to stay alive.
   There are more than 109,000 boat people in camps in Southeast
Asian countries, including 54,541 in Hong Kong, according to U.N.
and British figures.
   Britain has classified 10,500 of the Vietnamese in Hong Kong as
genuine political refugees. Britain wants to send to Guam about
9,000 it says are purely seeking a better way of life and have no
right to asylum.
   The rest are awaiting screening and British officials expect
nearly 90 percent to be classifed as economic migrants.

   An Israeli human rights group said Thursday
that soldiers violated firing orders by shooting 14 Palestinians in
the head, chest or back despite regulations calling for them to aim
for their legs.
   The Israeli Center for Human Rights in the Occupied Territories
said another woman reportedly died after a solider hit her with a
club, and that the army failed to investigate how all the deaths
occurred.
   An army statement attributed to military sources did not respond
to allegations that firing procedures were violated and said
investigations into the deaths were incomplete.
   The human rights group examined deaths that occurred during 11
days of disturbances following the May 20 massacre of seven unarmed
Arab laborers by an Israeli civilian.
   The study showed that 14 of the 18 people killed in the
subsequent unrest were shot in the head, chest or back, although
regulations call for aiming at rioters' legs.
   Many victims were shot at close range, according to the 23-page
report based on medical reports and witness testimony. Those killed
included an 8-year-old boy, four children aged 13 to 16, and three
women, it said.
   Army orders were tightened three days into the rioting,
requiring soldiers to get permission from senior officers before
shooting.
   ``It was obvious that they didn't stick to the regulations in
this case,'' said Zehava Galon, the director of the rights group.
``It wasn't necessary ... to shoot at the upper body.''
   The group said it could not investigate all 18 deaths because
army curfews kept researchers from reaching witnesses. The army
also blocked journalists from visiting the shooting scenes for more
than a week.
   Victims' families also complained that soldiers broke into their
homes and beat them, that live ammunition was often used instead of
plastic and rubber bullets and that some soldiers provoked rioting
and humiliated grieving families.
   The rights group said that in at least six of the deaths,
military police had not talked to the victims' families more than
two weeks after the killings. Reporters who have inquired into
other deaths have often been told for months that investigations
were not complete.
   An army officer said: ``We investigate every single case. You
can hardly say that in cases where a few days or a couple of weeks
have passed, we can be criticized for not speaking to all the
people involved.'' The officer spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The army said 107 soldiers had been indicted for misuse of force
in the 30-month uprising against Israeli occupation of the West
Bank and Gaza Strip. Seventy have been found guilty.
   The rights group apparently got wrong information on at least
one case _ the shooting death of 16-year-old Mohammed Halhuli from
the West Bank village of Qibya, whose uncle said soldiers entered
the village and opened fire.
   The AP interviewed more than a dozen people _ including the
youth's father _who all said he was shot and killed when he and
about 50 other youths stoned an army base in neighboring Burdus
village, and some tried to climb the fence.
   In its overall judgment on May's riots, the report said soldiers
did not give Palestinians enough latitude to express their anger at
the massacre and instead tried ``to nip any signs of protest in the
bud.''
   The report rejected army contentions that bloodshed was kept to
a minimum because soldiers had gained experience in handling
disturbances during the Palestinian uprising.
   The rights group said 12 people were killed and 800 wounded in
the first three days of the May riots. It said four Palestinians
were killed and dozens wounded in the first three days of the
uprising that began in December 1987.
   During the uprising, 717 Palestinians have been killed by
Israelis, and 45 Israelis have been slain by Palestinians.

   When state police received an urgent
dispatch last fall from a desperate officer pleading for help,
dispatchers frantically tried to find off-duty police units to see
if any were in trouble.
   None were.
   The call turned out to be a hoax. It also started a string of
sporadic calls on police frequencies from a hacker that so far has
eluded capture.
   ``He's back big-time and it's a real headache,'' Trooper Lon
Fields, spokesman for the state police in Morehead, said Thursday.
``It's aggravating for the troopers in the field and also the
dispatchers.''
   And it's a dangerous problem, said Capt. John Lile, a state
police spokesman.
   ``When they put out some false information as far as pursuits
and things like that ... it can place some officer and citizens in
danger,'' Lile said.
   Fields said that earlier this week a dispatcher in Morehead
received a call at about 9:30 p.m. from Unit 960. With sirens
wailing in the background, the officer in the car said he was under
fire from automatic weapons and requested assistance.
   One problem: There's no unit 960.
   ``For about an hour, he really wreaked havoc,'' Fields said.
   Identical calls were received in Cincinnati and Columbus, Ohio.
The transmissions ended about 11:30 p.m., when police sent a
helicopter out to canvass the area and made each officer check in.
   The hacker also has taunted officers, telling them to wake up
and call headquarters.
   He has been cutting into transmissions since September, but
until this week, he had been silent for several months.
   The hacker can only be traced when he is transmitting. And since
his calls are sporadic and he changes frequencies, he's hard to
trace, Lile said.
   Irby Tallant, engineer in charge with the Federal Communications
Commission in Detroit, said it's difficult to say how often
something like the situation in Kentucky and Ohio occurs.
   But if it's a one-time thing, Tallant said, it's very difficult
to pursue. When the calls occur on a continual basis, the FCC is
able to trace signals electronically.
   In that case, Tallant said, ``you have to have a scanner up
listening to all the frequencies he may bother.''
   Fields said state police are trying to trace the hacker.
   Interfering with police broadcasts or unauthorized use of a
police radio is a misdemeanor, carrying a sentence of up to a year
in jail, a $500 fine and forfeiture of equipment. Federal penalties
include a fine of up to $100,000 and a year in prison.

   Harvard University said Thursday it will cancel
the annual international AIDS conference in 1992 unless the United
States removes travel restrictions on people infected with the AIDS
virus.
   The university is scheduled to be host of the meeting, the
principal forum for presenting scientific information on the fight
against the disease.
   Many groups have protested U.S. policy that makes AIDS infection
one of several contagious diseases for which foreigners can be
barred from the country. Almost 100 organizations are boycotting
this year's meeting, scheduled to begin next week in San Francisco.
   ``We don't believe we can host a conference dedicated to the
elimination of AIDS to which people with AIDS cannot freely
travel,'' said Harvard's Alan Fein, director of the 1992 meeting.
``A conference that was held under these circumstances would be so
contentious and ineffective that it would render it not very
productive.''
   Dr. Max Essex, chairman of the Harvard AIDS Institute, disclosed
the threatened withdrawal from the meeting in a letter to Dr. Lars
Kallings of the Swedish Ministry of Health, who is president of the
International AIDS Society.
   ``Unless it becomes clear that the restrictions will be lifted
shortly, we will withdraw as sponsor for the next U.S.-based
meeting and cancel the conference scheduled for Boston in 1992,''
Essex wrote.
   While Harvard did not set a specific deadline, Fein said it will
scrap the meeting unless it sees an indication of ``swift
movement'' by Congress or the administration to eliminate the
travel restrictions.
   A Senate amendment three years ago ordered the Public Health
Service to add infection by the AIDS virus to the list of diseases,
including leprosy and tuberculosis, that may bar foreigners.
   In response to an outcry against the rule, the Immigration and
Naturalization Service announced a waiver policy that allows people
infected with the virus to stay in the United States up to 30 days
for business, conferences, medical treatment or family visits. The
policy eliminated the requirement of permanent identifying marks on
their passports.
   In April, it said it would issue 10-day visas for those coming
to this country for professional or scientific conferences. Those
applying do not have to say whether they are infected with the AIDS
virus.
   ``We have been trying our best, as have a lot of others, to see
some sign that our federal government will change its policy,''
Essex said in an interview. ``But after talking to everybody we
could find who would talk to us, we came to the conclusion
reluctantly that there is not a lot of action occurring.''
   He said the International AIDS Society will decide during the
San Francisco meeting whether to try to relocate the 1992 meeting
or cancel it.
   Whether the meeting could be held somewhere else is unclear.
Fein said it would be difficult for another institution to put
together a meeting with only two years' planning. He said that
Boston's major convention hall and 8,000 hotel rooms were reserved
a year ago.
   Dr. Robert M. Wachter of the University of California, San
Francisco, program director of the San Francisco meeting, said that
even though the travel restrictions have eased considerably, he
still considers them to be unacceptable and discriminatory.
   ``They (Harvard) have laid their cards on the table,'' said
Wachter. ``We agree.''
   The announced boycott is expected to have little effect on the
scientific reports at the San Francisco meeting. Few presentations
have been withdrawn, and 12,000 people are expected.
   The 1991 AIDS meeting will be held in Florence, Italy.

   White House chief of staff John Sununu,
writing a new chapter in East-West cooperation, will go to Moscow
to help Mikhail S. Gorbachev organize his new office as president
of the Soviet Union, it was announced Thursday.
   Sununu, who oversees a White House staff of more than 400
people, has been meeting this week with a visiting delegation of
Soviet officials, explaining details of presidential scheduling,
communications systems and personnel organization.
   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said a member of
the delegation, Mikhail Shkabardnya, had invited Sununu to Moscow
for further consultations and that he had accepted. The date has
not been set.
   Fitzwater said Sununu would offer advice on organizational
matters related to the office of the presidency. ``I think they
would like him to come to the Soviet Union to take a look at their
ideas and their plans ... if he has any advice for them.''
   Gorbachev, the general secretary of the Communist Party,
expanded his powers earlier this year when he was elected to the
new post of president.

   Israel's new foreign minister, David Levy, was
hospitalized Thursday in the intensive care unit following
complaints of weakness, hospital officials in Afula said.
   Levy, 52, was taken to Haemek Hospital in the northern Israeli
city near his hometown of Bet Shean, said the hospital's deputy
director, Dr. Udi Kantor.
   Kantor said there was no sign of immediate danger, adding that
Levy was hospitalized for medical observation.
   ``We hope to release him as soon as possible,'' Kantor said.
   Israel army radio and the national Itim news agency said Levy
was under great strain in recent days following the formation of a
new government Monday and his appointment to the foreign minister's
post.
   The Moroccan-born Levy, a captivating orator, began his career
in the ranks of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's right-wing Likud
bloc as a labor union boss championing the causes of the
disadvantaged.
   Levy, a fluent Arabic speaker, quickly gained prominence in the
party and is regarded by some as a possible successor to Shamir.

   The century-old Ladies Reading
Circle, its membership whittled down by age and changing
lifestyles, on Thursday closed the book on a tradition dating back
to a more genteel era.
   A luncheon at the Gideon Putnam Hotel in this city famed for its
mineral waters and horse racing was the last meeting for the
literary club, which is disbanding after watching its ranks shrink
over the years from 25 to 10 active members.
   ``We're all getting older,'' said club president Ellen Qua, a
member since 1957 who turns 80 in September. ``I'm one of the young
kids.''
   The last book read by the club was Bruce Courtenay's ``The Power
of One,'' about South Africa. The first was ``In Darkest Africa''
by Henry V. Stanley, the famed explorer who published the
two-volume work in 1890. The club was founded that year by women
parishioners at the local Baptist church.
   ``That was before television, radio and telephone. That's the
way they got together. Reading circles were common then,'' Ms. Qua
said.
   The club met once a week, but over the years that was reduced to
every other week, then every month and finally whenever members
could get together. The last meeting before Thursday's was in
February, although winter meetings became infrequent as more
members spent the season in Florida, Ms. Qua said.
   Club meetings featured readings and discussions of books on
history, architecture, geology, economics, poetry, as well as
biographies and various works of fiction.
   ``Everything from cooking to Mozart,'' said vice president
Althea Moncsko.
   Members chose the books they wanted to read, with no
restrictions.
   ``Even if you don't like a writer, you should read him anyway to
find out what his views are,'' Ms. Qua said. ``The written word is
sort of holy.''
   Today's women have less time to devote to meet and talk about
books, members said.
   ``Women are too busy with families and businesses to carry on in
the afternoon with something like this, reading and reviewing
books,'' Ms. Qua said.
   Ladies Reading Circle meetings offered an opportunity for
afternoon get-togethers for its elderly members, who don't like to
go out at night, Ms. Moncsko said.
   ``It has been quite a social, close-knit group,'' she said. ``We
do just hate to give that up.''

<HEAD>Request For More S&amp;L Bailout Money Draws Fire</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of Congress on Thursday attacked the
administration's request for more money to rescue savings and
loans, accusing the White House of bungling the first bailout and
failing to pursue fraud vigorously.
   A torrent of criticism greeted Treasury Secretary Nicholas F.
Brady after he warned the House Banking Committee that the thrift
cleanup likely would run out of money before the end of the year.
   Brady, testifying three weeks after the administration doubled
its estimate of S&amp;L cleanup costs to a range of $89 billion to $132
billion, said the administration would need from ``about $30
billion to slightly over $50 billion'' more in the next fiscal year
alone.
   Panel members, clearly worried about a backlash from angry
constituents, attacked the administration for delays in prosecuting
the growing backlog of fraud cases and selling the mountain of sour
loans and problem real estate inherited from failed thrifts.
   ``I think we're sitting on a volcano of public opinion on this
issue,'' said Rep. Richard E. Neal, D-Mass. ``I hear continuously
at the corner store and the supermarket and at the gas station,
`When are you guys going to do something about putting the crooks
in jail?'''
   Neal's criticism spurred Housing Secretary Jack Kemp, along with
Brady a member of an administration board overseeing the bailout,
to warn Democrats not to make S&amp;Ls a partisan issue.
   ``I think there's enough blame to go around and I just hope this
is not going to erupt into the kind of political attack ... on
either side,'' he said.
   However, Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., distinguished between
blame for the first bailout, enacted last August, and the coming
second bailout. He said President Bush has paid scant attention to
the S&amp;L cleanup and has allowed it to founder.
   ``The first one ... there was plenty of blame to go around. ...
In this second S&amp;L crisis, there's not plenty of blame to go
around. ... We've heard more from the president about broccoli than
we've heard about this crisis,'' he said.
   Even Republicans, including Rep. Chalmers Wylie of Ohio, the
senior GOP member on the panel, joined in the assault.
   ``The Department of Justice's efforts to prosecute thrift fraud
are well intentioned but fall way short of the mark,'' Wylie said.
``Apparently, S&amp;L crimes are not a high priority for federal
prosecutors.''
   He, like Democrats, complained that the administration was
spending only $50 million on increased fraud prosecution, rather
than the $75 million Congress authorized.
   Brady defended the administration's performance, pointing to
Wednesday's 38-count indictment in Texas of Don Dixon, former owner
of Vernon Savings and Loan Association, a collapsed institution
that cost taxpayers $1.3 billion. Dixon, if convicted, faces a jail
sentence of up to 190 years.
   ``As important as the number of scalps we hang on our belts, is
the fact that when we get one, they're dealt with firmly, harshly
and with the appropriate justice for the kind of crime that they've
committed,'' Brady said.
   He pointed out that it took four years of work before Dixon
could be charged and said 17,000 suspected cases of fraud have been
referred to the Justice Department.
   ``We, like everyone, want to make sure the crooks are
prosecuted. But we have to realize these are white collar cases. It
isn't like a bank robbery where a guy comes in with a gun, sticks
up a bank ... and there's cameras taking pictures of him. ... When
you're talking about bringing one of these (white collar) people to
justice, you're talking about an enormous amount of time with
accountants, lawyers and files,'' he said.

<HEAD>Kan. Governor, State Attorney General Bark Back at California
Critics</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN HANNA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Critics of a new law that's designed to
protect Kansas laboratories that use animals for testing are
``bozos from California,'' the state's attorney general says.
   ``Any self-respecting Kansan would tell them to go to hell,''
said Attorney General Bob Stephan.
   The legislation makes it a crime to photograph or destroy
property at an animal research laboratory, testing or breeding
grounds. The law was crafted to keep animal-rights activists from
entering a research lab and photographing animals for their
campaigns against animal testing, officials say.
   Much of the criticism led by a California assemblyman has
centered on allegations that Kansas protects ``puppy mills,''
substandard breeding operations that ship sick animals out of state.
   Stephan said the measure, which was signed into law last month,
does not apply to commercial dog kennels.
   ``It's very easy to say Kansas has a problem, because we're
dealing with those problems up front,'' Stephan told reporters
Wednesday. ``Meanwhile, California does nothing. Frankly, I think
it's very clear. If those folks in California who are complaining
could read, they could read the bill.''
   A truck carrying 5,000 pounds of dog biscuits set out from
Sonora, Calif., for Topeka on Tuesday to protest the legislation.
Organizers in California would not disclose when it would arrive.
   The protesters originally planned to send 9,000 pounds of dog
bones but worried they would be turned back as a health hazard.
   ``Why shouldn't we react this way when some bozos from
California decide at first to send some bones to our state, then
some dog biscuits?'' Stephan asked.
   Gov. Mike Hayden said he would donate the biscuits to the Humane
Society.
   The two Kansas officials say the state's animal inspection laws
are stronger than those in California. They also say California
officials cannot cite a single complaint involving dogs bred in
Kansas.
   California state Assemblyman Sam Farr has led the protest,
introducing legislation that would require California pet stores to
post where dogs were bred and that would make it illegal for the
pet stores to knowingly sell a sick dog.
   ``We're very disappointed that the governor and the attorney
general had to resort to name calling to avoid the fact that Kansas
has a lot of puppy mills that send a lot of sick puppies to
California,'' said Farr's aide, Darryl Young.
   ``There's a real problem in Kansas,'' Young said. ``The governor
and attorney general are heavily into denial and not the problem.''
   The protesters want a repeal of the Kansas legislation.
   Stephan said the 1990 Kansas law does not apply to dog breeders
but only those animals used in food, fur or fiber production,
agriculture, testing or education.
   Stephan also noted that a 1988 Kansas law, under which the state
inspects federally licensed animal laboratories once a year, and
those not licensed by the federal government twice a year, was left
untouched.
   Hayden noted that California law does not call for that state to
license or inspect animal dealers at all. But some critics say the
Kansas inspection program is underfinanced, understaffed and
ineffective.

<HEAD>Bush Calls For Soviet Dialogue With Baltic Republics</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Bush proclaimed Thursday ``Baltic
Freedom Day'' and renewed his call for Moscow to engage in
``productive dialogue'' with Baltic leaders aimed at ending unrest
in those Soviet republics.
   Bush signed a proclamation the Senate had requested in a
resolution.
   ``The right to liberty and self-determination, free and fair
elections, a better life for themselves and for their children,
these are just aspirations of the people of Estonia, Latvia, and
Lithuania. On this Baltic Freedom Day, we reaffirm our support for
them,'' Bush said in the proclamation.
   He reiterated the U.S. position, which does not recognize the
forced incorporation of the three countries by the Soviet Union in
1940.
   ``During that fateful summer, Soviet troops invaded and occupied
the Baltic States. The rigged elections that followed put an end to
Baltic self-determination.''
   Bush noted, however, the self-determination moves in Latvia,
Estonia and Lithuania in the past year and the democratic elections
held.
   ``In decisions reflecting the will of the Baltic people,
Lithuania, Estonia, and Latvia have asserted their intention to
restore their independence.''
   ``We support self-determination for the Baltic peoples and we
call upon the Soviet Union to enter a good-faith dialogue with
representatives of the Baltic governments who received popular
mandates in free and fair elections. We are encouraged by recent
steps in that direction and hope that a full and productive
dialogue will materialize,'' Bush's proclamation said.
   Bush earlier in the week lauded Soviet President Mikhail
Gorbachev's talks with Lithuanian leaders as ``a significant
change.''
   The Baltic states all are struggling for independence from the
Soviet Union.
   In Lithuania, the most aggressive in its breakaway move, the
Soviets retaliated with an economic blockade, but began to lift the
blockade by restoring a small amount of fuel export on Wednesday.
   The Bush administration has tried to walk a fine line in its
reaction to the Soviets' heavyhandedness in the Baltics so as not
to further weaken the domestically embattled Gorbachev.
   Administration officials initially raised Lithuania as a
stumbling block to normalizing trade relations with the Soviet
Union, but subsequently eased off that demand, saying Lithuania was
never directly linked to U.S. willingness to enter a trade pact.

   A police officer shot during off-duty
heroics died Thursday, becoming the second off-duty officer fatally
shot in the last 10 days.
   Officer Joaquin ``Jack'' Montijo, 35, was shot in the head
Wednesday night and died Thursday afternoon when life support
systems were shut off at Temple University Hospital, officials said.
   Doctors said Montijo showed no vital signs when he was brought
to the hospital emergency room, and was resuscitated twice. A
bullet struck him between the eyes and lodged in the back of his
skull.
   Michael Lacava, 25, was arrested Thursday for investigation in
the slaying, said police Lt. Joseph Witte.
   The incident began when the officer heard a gunshot. Montijo
dashed out of the house with his gun drawn, went up to an armed man
and ordered him to drop his pistol, witnesses said. A gun battle
ensued.
   ``He took actions when he saw someone with the weapon,'' police
Commissioner Willie L. Williams said. ``He thought someone was in
trouble and immediately put himself on duty and attempted to make
an apprehension.''
   Montijo, who joined the force 19 months ago, was visiting his
girlfriend, Zoreida Perez, who lives with her sister and
brother-in-law. They pleaded with him not to go after the gunman,
but were unable to stop him.
   ``I guess he wanted to be a hero,'' said Gladys Sanchez, Ms.
Perez's sister. ``He didn't want nobody else to get hurt.''
   It was the second shooting of off-duty officers in 10 days.
   Officer Winfred Hunter was shot to death and Officer Kelvin
Merritt was seriously wounded June 4 in a gun battle outside an
after-hours club.

<HEAD>Neighbors Blast Coastal Commission Ruling on Singer's House</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Singer Olivia Newton-John was honored this
week by the United Nations as a special ambassador for the
environment, then was slammed by Malibu neighbors who call her
seaside home-under-construction a mess.
   The California Coastal Commission on Wednesday ruled that a
seawall built to protect the 6,000-square-foot home is taking too
long to finish, but found no fault with methods used to make it.
   Neighbors had complained about the seawall, calling the massive
pile of sand an eyesore and an environmental hazard.
   Gretchen Buck, who lives several hundred feet away, said the
seawall construction involved dumping dirt, sand and debris on the
beach.
   Some washed out to sea, she said, and the ocean was so muddied
for a time that she was forced to suspend her daily swims in the
exclusive Paradise Cove area of Malibu.
   The commission ruling angered her. ``A railroad job, that's what
I'd call it,'' she said.
   Investigators for the state panel acknowledged that Miss
Newton-John and her husband, Matt Lattanzi, had violated the
Coastal Act by carrying out construction without a permit
extension. But no penalties were levied.
   ``I'm glad it's over and I know Olivia is,'' said Lattanzi.
``Neither of us would knowingly do anything to hurt the
environment.''
   The couple bought the property in 1981. They're building a
solar-powered house designed to resemble a sand castle.
   The commission might seek civil fines later, said Nancy Cave,
the agency's chief enforcement officer. It can seek penalties of up
to $5,000 a day in cases where applicants knowingly violate coastal
building codes.
   The commission issued a permit for the seawall last June. It
expired Nov. 1. The panel approved an after-the-fact permit for the
work Wednesday, criticizing the couple for not requesting an
extension.
   ``This is a project out of control,'' said William Litvak, an
attorney for several neighbors who also contend that grading has
destabilized bluffs overlooking their properties.
   An attorney for the couple disagreed.
   ``Because we're dealing with a celebrity who also happens to be
an environmentalist, the whole issue has been blown out of
proportion,'' Elizabeth Watson said. ``It's a hullabaloo about
nothing.''
   Critics said the singer was receiving special consideration
because she is a celebrity. Miss Newton-John received the United
Nations tribute this week for her work furthering environmental
causes.

<NOTE>Eds: SUBS 2nd graf pvs, `The 21 ...' to UPDATE with all 22
Democratic members of committee signing letter</NOTE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of House Democrats sought Thursday to
expand a special prosecutor's investigation to include allegations
that former Housing Secretary Samuel R. Pierce Jr. lied to Congress.
   All 22 Democratic members of the House Judiciary Committee urged
Attorney General Dick Thornburgh to refer the issue of whether
Pierce lied last year in congressional testimony to the independent
counsel, who is already investigating other allegations of criminal
wrongdoing by the former housing secretary.
   The lawmakers cited recent testimony by DuBois L. Gilliam, a
former assistant housing secretary, who said Pierce ordered him to
award federal housing grants to politically connected developers.
   Thornburgh was attending an anti-terrorism conference in Ireland
and his spokesman, Dan Eramian said ``we would have to evaluate the
letter before we made any comment.''
   Gilliam recently told a House subcommittee that Pierce used the
Department of Housing and Urban Development's discretionary grant
program as ``a private political slush fund.''
   Gilliam's testimony last month prompted Thornburgh to ask
independent counsel Arlin M. Adams to investigate allegations of
political favoritism in the operation of the discretionary fund and
the Urban Development Action Grant Program.
   Adams has issued a series of grand jury subpoenas to Pierce and
former HUD aides, according to sources who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
   The independent counsel, who is preparing to widen his
investigation, has decided to grant immunity to Gilliam, who is
already serving an 18-month prison term for conspiracy and
accepting illegal gratuities, said one source familiar with the
case.
   Adams was originally appointed to determine if Pierce and other
top HUD officials committed crimes by showing political favoritism
in the operation of the Moderate Rehabilitation Program.
   The latest request by the lawmakers triggers a provision of the
independent counsel statute that forces the Justice Department to
determine if there is a ``specific and credible'' allegation that
should be referred to the special prosecutor.
   When he sought Adams' appointment earlier this year, Thornburgh
declined to include allegations of perjury in the independent
counsel's mandate.
   Thornburgh said at the time that the questions Pierce was asked
by the House Government Operations employment and housing
subcommittee and the answers the former secretary gave were not
specific enough to provide evidence of perjury.
   Pierce told the subcommittee that he ``did not have hands on''
involvement in disbursing money through the Moderate Rehabilitation
Program, adding that he ``never told these people to fund
anything.''
   In their letter to Thornburgh, the 21 Democrats said that
Gilliam ``described at least two instances in which Mr. Pierce was
directly involved in abuses of the Moderate Rehabilitation
Program.''
   But Robert Plotkin, one of Pierce's defense attorneys, said that
Gilliam's testimony does not amount to evidence that Pierce lied to
the subcommittee.
   Gilliam ``was never asked directly about anything that Pierce
testified about that was of a specific enough nature for him to be
able to contradict anything,'' Plotkin said.
   But Rep. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., who circulated the letter he
and his colleagues signed, said ``Gilliam has added new cause to
look into perjury.''

<TEXT>
   Thugs wielding guns and machetes broke
into the home of a former Cabinet minister who advocates an end to
one-party rule, seriously injuring his wife, the former official
said Thursday.
   The former official, Kenneth Matiba, said the attack may be
linked to his political stand, which has incensed the ruling party.
   ``I do not want to make any insinuations, but let me say it is
very hard for me and my family not to associate my stand in public
affairs with this attack,'' he told a news conference.
   Matiba, who was not home at the time, said the attack occurred
at about midnight Wednesday at his 40-acre farm and residence 15
miles north of Nairobi, the capital.
   He said a group of about 15 men ``calling each other corporal
and captain,'' broke through heavy iron grills over the windows and
into his bedroom where his daughter and maid had sought refuge with
his wife.
   The attackers, who repeatedly asked for Matiba, rifled through
some drawers, took a handbag and necklace of little value, and hit
his wife, Edith, on the head with an instrument heavy enough to
fracture her skull, he said.
   The Swahili-speaking attackers also beat up his daughter and
maid, neither of whom required hospitalization.
   The thugs fired two shots at neighbors who came to help, and
then fled, Matiba said.
   While residential break-ins are not uncommon in Kenya, Matiba
said the attack at his house was not over valuables.
   ``Seeing that they stole nothing, what else did they want? It's
me, they made it clear,'' he said.
   Matiba, a prosperous hotelier who was at one of his
establishments on Kenya's coast at the time of the attack, said his
daughter described the intruders as ranging in age between 25 and
35 years old.
   He said police were investigating the incident.
   Since launching his campaign earlier this year calling for
public debate on returning Kenya to multiparty politics, Matiba has
been condemned repeatedly by ruling party leaders and
parliamentarians.
   He said he also had been threatened and regularly is followed by
what he believes are government intelligence officers.
   President Daniel arap Moi, who has described Matiba's campaign
as divisive, in 1982 pushed a law through parliament making the
ruling Kenya African National Union the sole legal political party.
Moi is president of the party, which has ruled the former British
colony since independence in 1963.
   This is not the first time Matiba has riled the government.
   He was expelled from the ruling party early last year after he
refused to back down on claims that party elections the previous
year were rigged. He resigned his Cabinet post as minister of
transport and communication over the same issue in late 1988.

<HEAD>Administration Backs Off Economic Sanctions Against India</HEAD>

   The Bush administration said Thursday it would
not impose economic sanctions against India even though that
country has refused to negotiate over trade barriers the United
States deems offensive.
   In announcing the decision, the administration said it would
pursue the issues in the current round of global free-trade talks
but would not retaliate by boosting tariffs on imports by India
into the United States.
   India was targeted last year along with Japan and Brazil for a
possible sanctions under the toughest section of the 1988 trade
law. Known as Super 301, the provision required the administration
to draw up a priority ``hit list'' of the most offensive barriers
to U.S. trade exports.
   Both Japan and Brazil negotiated their way off the Super 301
list by reaching market-opening agreements. However, India has
steadfastly refused to negotiate over U.S. claims that it is
unfairly blocking foreign investment and operation of foreign
insurance companies.
   But U.S. Trade Representative Carla Hills said the
administration was encouraged by India's announcement on May 31
that it would remove some of its investment barriers.
   ``Our message that foreign investment brings jobs, technology
and prosperity may be getting through. I hope this attitude will be
reflected in India's approach to these issues in the Uruguay
Round,'' she said.
   The administration has made the Uruguay Round, named for the
country where the talks began in 1986, its top trade priority for
the year. India is considered a key participant in those talks,
being held under the auspices of the 96-nation General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade, because of its influence over other developing
countries.
   The United States hopes to win support from developing countries
for its push to eliminate farm subsidies, strengthen copyright
protection for U.S. companies and expand GATT rules to cover trade
in services such as banking and insurance.
   The Indian government, which has contended that the United
States was violating global trading rules through its unilateral
threats of retaliation, praised the U.S. decision.
   ``One would hope this decision marks the return of the United
States to the multilateral process,'' said Shipra Biswas, a
spokeswoman for the Indian Commerce Ministry in New Delhi. ``Few
would argue that our policies on investment and insurance are
unreasonable, because they have to be in line with our
socio-economic goals.''
   While Thursday's decision removes the possibility of economic
retaliation immediately, the administration in April renamed India
to a ``hit list'' for the current year, citing the same trade
barriers. The deadline for reaching a conclusion on that action
will not come until June 1991.

   President Bush praised fathers Thursday as
playing ``a very important role in shaping the character of our
nation.''
   In a proclamation recognizing Sunday's celebration of Fathers
Day, Bush said the day is a time to ``thank dads everywhere for all
they do.''
   ``As children, we cannot fully fathom the depth of our father's
love for us. Neither can we fully realize the weight of his
responsibilities,'' said the president, himself a father of five
and grandfather of 12.
   Children rarely ``perceive in their father's tender gaze the
worries, frustrations and concerns'' that are a part of parenting,
the proclamation said.
   ``With each passing year, and especially as we have children of
our own, we become ever more grateful for our father's love and
discipline, and for the many sacrifices he has made. We begin to
see clearly how being a father requires faith and fortitude,'' Bush
said.
   He called Father's Day a time to ``thank dads everywhere for all
they do, throughout the year, for our families and country.''

   Negotiators at East-West talks on
reducing Europe's conventional forces are close to agreement on
overall limits for the number of tanks and armored combat vehicles,
diplomats said Thursday.
   They said they expected imminent formal agreement on ceilings in
the two weapons categories and said this would speed negotiations
for an initial agreement at the talks by the end of the year.
   The negotiations on Conventional Forces in Europe are designed
to reduce troops and non-nuclear weapons of the two military
alliances from the Atlantic Ocean to the Ural mountains.
   The 16 member nations of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
and seven Warsaw Pact countries are taking part.
   The breakthrough came from the French and the Poles.
   Their proposal suggests an overall ceiling for armored combat
vehicles of 30,000 for each side and a ceiling of 20,000 tanks for
each side.
   It sets minimum weight parameters of 16.5 tons for tanks
regardless of whether they have tracks or wheels.
   French chief delegate Francois Plaisant said at a joint news
conference with Poland's Wlodzimierz Konarski there was ``informal
but overall consensus'' on the proposal.
   A press statement by Soviet delegation leader Oleg A. Grinevski
said ``an important step has doubtlessly been made. ... This
solution means substantial progress at the Vienna negotiations.''
   A minor setback occurred, however, at a closed-door meeting of
delegates from all 23 countries at which the proposal had been
expected to be made final, said a Western diplomat, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   The Soviet side said it first wanted to see an equipment list
that is to accompany the agreement, the diplomat said. No one at
the Soviet delegation could be reached for comment.
   The Western diplomat called the development a ``negative step''
but expressed hope it could be worked out quickly at current
informal meetings.
   The breakthrough came after weeks when negotiators from both
sides complained petty bargaining was slowing the talks. Western
diplomats said the Soviets appeared to be dragging their feet until
the future security allegiance of a united Germany is decided.
   But the diplomats said they had detected a ``willingness to move
forward'' in recent weeks.
   Both sides hope to have an agreement ready for signing by
December when leaders from 35 nations _ including the 23 involved
in the Vienna talks _ are scheduled to meet in Paris.
   The other 12 participants are neutral and non-aligned countries
in Europe that also would be affected by reducing tensions on the
Continent.
   Finding common definitions for tanks and other armaments has
been a contentious issue at the Vienna talks.
   Thursday's proposal no longer makes a distinction between
armored troop carriers and other armored vehicles, removing a
further obstacle.
   Konarski said the text in a future treaty will include a list of
the arms they would carry, classifying all the weapons the two
sides now have.
   He said this would be unprecedented in East-West relations. He
said these lists would then become the basis for the reductions.
   According to U.S. estimates, the West now has 23,600 tanks and
the Warsaw Pact, 52,500, and 34,025 armored combat vehicles to the
Warsaw Pact's 59,400.
   Konarski said the use of broader categories of definitions was
the only way to conclude a deal under the circumstances. But he and
Plaisant said many issues remain to be resolved before a final
agreement can be signed.

   A report that John F. Kennedy Jr. was
negotiating to appear in a soap opera was incorrect, a spokesman
for Kennedy said Thursday. A producer who was quoted as the source
of the report has since said he did not provide the information.
   A man who identified himself as producer Ruben Malaret told The
Associated Press on Monday that he had negotiated with the late
president's son about a part in a projected soap opera,
``Families.''
   In a telephone conversation on Wednesday, a man identifying
himself as Malaret denied he had ever spoken to Kennedy about the
part, and denied he had discussed the subject with the AP. He
agreed to meet with an AP reporter on Thursday, but did not appear.
   AP reporters said the caller identifying himself as Malaret on
Monday and Wednesday sounded like the same person.
   Kennedy's office referred questions about the report to Michael
Berman, who acts as his spokesman. Berman said Kennedy had never
talked with anyone about the soap opera and would not consider such
an appearance. ``That story is just absolutely not true,'' he said.
   Kennedy works as an assistant district attorney in New York.

   Hospitals and nursing homes may challenge a
state's Medicaid reimbursement system, the Supreme Court ruled
Thursday in a decision that could have a major financial impact.
   The justices, in a 5-4 vote, said the Virginia Hospital
Association may use a federal civil rights law to sue Virginia over
the state's Medicaid payment rates.
   At a time of soaring medical costs and an increasing demand for
Medicaid services, the decision could force the federal and state
governments to cough up more money for the program that provides
medical care for the poor.
   ``This should increase ... the amount of reimbursement that
hospitals will get for providing Medicaid patients with care,''
said Fredric J. Entin, general counsel for the American Hospital
Association.
   He said he could not estimate how much reimbursements might rise
if hospitals are successful with their lawsuits.
   If the hospital association wins its case in federal court, the
state's hospitals would get $25 million to $27 million more per
year in Medicaid reimbursements, said Laurens Sartoris, association
president. About half would come from the federal government and
half from state coffers. Virginia hospitals now get about $230
million from Medicaid, he said.
   In this fiscal year, total Medicaid expenses for the nation are
expected to approach $71 billion, about 56 percent borne by the
federal government and the rest by the states.
   Hospitals in Colorado, Pennsylvania and Michigan have won
lawsuits similar to the Virginia Hospital Association's, though
some of the decisions are on appeal. Cases also are pending in
Wisconsin, Oregon and Ohio, said Mary Babich, a spokeswoman for the
American Hospital Association.
   Officials from most states had urged the Supreme Court to rule
against the Virginia association. They said allowing such lawsuits
could affect hundreds of millions of dollars in federal and state
funding, and lead to a litigation explosion.
   ``The Medicaid program in almost every state is having financial
difficulties,'' said Jeff Harris, a researcher for the Medicaid
Management Institute, which is part of the American Public Welfare
Association.
   ``This opens the door to tremendous increases in costs,'' he
said, adding that it also ties the hands of state legislatures by
allowing ``judicial rate setting for hospitals, nursing homes and
doctors.''
   Sartoris disagreed, saying: ``I don't think the floodgates are
going to open.''
   He added that ``it wouldn't surprise me that some (states)
would'' file suit, but he said providers have a ``tremendous burden
to prove that the state's program doesn't meet the federal standard.
   Whether the Supreme Court decision would help physicians who
might challenge Medicaid reimbursements was unclear. Harris said it
would, but Martin A. Donlan, an attorney for the Virginia
association, was doubtful.
   The court, led by Justice William J. Brennan, said Congress
never intended to bar Medicaid care providers from suing in federal
court when reimbursement disputes arise.
   The court said Congress gave health care providers the right to
sue in federal court when it amended the Medicaid Act in 1980.
   That amendment, introduced by Sen. David Boren, D-Okla.,
requires states to reimburse health care providers according to
rates ``the state finds, and makes assurances satisfactory to the
secretary (of Health and Human Services) are reasonable and
adequate.''
   Writing for the majority, Brennan said the amendment ``creates a
right, enforceable in a private cause of action ... to have the
state adopt rates that it finds are reasonable and adequate rates
to meet the costs of an efficient and economical health care
provider.''
   Brennan was joined by Justices Byron R. White, Thurgood
Marshall, Harry A. Blackmun and John Paul Stevens.
   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices Sandra Day
O'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy dissented.
   In its 1986 lawsuit, the Virginia Hospital Association sued the
state, alleging that the too-low rates violate the federal Medicaid
Act and the rights of participating hospitals to due process.
   Virginia officials sought to have the suit dismissed, contending
that only health care recipients _ not individual or associated
health care providers _ have the right to sue under the Medicaid
Act.

   Imelda Marcos began weeping Thursday when a
witness at her federal racketeering trial mentioned one of her
daughters while tracing funds Mrs. Marcos allegedly used to buy
lavish gifts.
   The judge immediately broke for lunch, and Mrs. Marcos was
examined by her doctors at the nurse's office in the courthouse.
   Lawyers said Mrs. Marcos' blood pressure had shot up but then
stabilized, and the trial continued after the lunch recess.
   The trial in U.S. District Court was adjourned three times
before because of Mrs. Marcos' health problems, most recently on
May 31 when she was hospitalized for a stomach ailment related to
stress. Earlier, she experienced two attacks of high blood pressure.
   A doctor's report submitted to U.S. District Judge John F.
Keenan last week said Mrs. Marcos's blood pressure and heartbeat
increased when she discussed ``her strong desire to vindicate her
family name.''
   On Thursday, Mrs. Marcos became upset when an accountant for the
Philippine government explained charts that traced millions of
dollars allegedly stolen from a government-owned bank to personal
purchases for Mrs. Marcos.
   Mrs. Marcos, who was seated at the defense table, began crying
when the witness, Maria Goreddi Jimenez, said some of the money was
used to buy Nautilus exercise equipment for her eldest daughter,
Imee Marcos Manotoc.
   Lawyers said Mrs. Marcos became distraught at any mention of her
family, especially Imee, whom she hasn't seen in four years and who
reportedly is living in Northern Africa. Mrs. Marcos' two other
children, Ferdinand Marcos Jr. and Irene Marcos Araneta, have
periodically attended the trial.
   The funds outlined on the charts were part of the $222 million
that the government alleges was siphoned out of the Philippines
treasury by Mrs. Marcos and her late husband, President Ferdinand
Marcos.
   Mrs. Marcos is accused of having used the stolen money for
luxury purchases and secret investments in New York real estate.
   Her co-defendant, Saudi financier Adnan Khashoggi, is alleged to
have backdated documents to help the Marcoses protect the real
estate holdings from a 1986 court order freezing their U.S. assets.
   The charts showed $28.6 million deposited into a New York bank
account of Mrs. Marcos' personal secretary, Fe Roa Gimenez, between
1980 and 1986.
   The accountant said the money included about $6.7 million from
the New York branch of the government-owned Philippine National
Bank, of which more than $3 million was used to buy jewelry for
Mrs. Marcos.
   The remaining money was used to buy designer clothes for Mrs.
Marcos and her daughters, fur coats and other expenses such as
hotel and limousine bills, the accountant said.
   Prosecutors have said Mrs. Marcos used the Philippine National
Bank's New York office as her ``personal piggy bank'' for spending
sprees during visits to New York.
   Jimenez said she was an accountant for the Philippine Commission
on Good Government, which was established after Marcos was deposed
in February 1986 to trace money he allegedly took from the treasury.

<HEAD>Irish-Language Writer Dead at 89</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Seosamh Mac Grianna, who adapted simple
folk tales into Irish-language stories before virtually abandoning
writing 55 years ago, has died near his boyhood home. He was 89.
   Mac Grianna died in a hospital Monday in Letterkenny in
northwest Ireland, The Irish Times reported. Cause of death was not
given.
   Mac Grianna wrote his last book, ``Mo Bhealach Fein'' (My Own
Way), in 1935. Some of his most important work, thogh, was not
published until 1969. He entered a mental hospital in 1935 for
treatment of depression and wrote little afterward.
   ``Mac Grianna sought isolation, he was ready to accept the
reputation of being eccentric and unsociable, because he sought a
vision of which he could never speak,'' wrote critic Seamus Deane
in 1940 following the publication of ``Mo Bhealach Fein,'' a partly
fictionalized autobiography.
   Mac Grianna was born Joseph Green on Jan. 15, 1901, in an
Irish-speaking community in County Donegal. His family was known
for generations as storytellers, singers and poets.
   After leaving school, he taught school briefly and was involved
in the fight for Irish independence from Britain in the early
1920s, spending time in jail before becoming a full-time writer.
   As a young man, Mac Grianna contributed to newspapers and
periodicals and wrote several novels and short stories. He also
prepared Irish translations of a dozen books, including ``Ivanhoe''
and ``Ben Hur.''
   One of his best-known works, ``An Druma Mor'' (The Big Drum),
tells of an Irish community in the 1920s wrangling over a marching
band. It was not published until 1969.
   Two years later, it was awarded the Irish-American Butler prize
and became required reading in university Irish courses.
   In recent years, Mac Grianna had appeared at literary festivals.
   Mac Grianna was the brother of Seamus O Grianna, who wrote under
the name ``Maire'' and died in 1969.
   The Irish language, often called Gaelic, is spoken frequently
now by only about 5 to 10 percent of Ireland's 3.5 million people.
   Funeral arrangements were incomplete.

<TEXT>
   Even as crews tried to lasso a widening oil
slick off the Texas coast Thursday, lawmakers in Washington tried
to patch up legislation designed to prevent future oil spills.
   Rep. Gerry Studds, D-Mass., proposed a compromise that he hopes
will break a legislative logjam holding up such legislation. The
bill would toughen penalties against oil spillers, quadruple limits
on liability for tanker operators, require double hulls on new oil
tankers and establish a $1 billion fund available for cleanup
emergencies.
   The legislative manuvering comes amid a spate of oil spills.
   In the past week, a fire and spill on the Norwegian tanker Mega
Borg off Galveston, Texas, threatened the gulf coastline with a
major environmental disaster. A tanker grounding off Staten Island,
N.Y., sent tar balls up on the Jersey Shore. And a cruise ship that
struck rocks near the Cape Cod Canal spilled 7,500 gallons of fuel
oil, soiling nearby Cape Cod beaches.
   But a House-Senate conference committee has run aground on
whether to participate in international oil-spill protocols.
   The House version would have the U.S. participate, even though
the protocols are somewhat more lenient toward ship owners
responsible for spills in international waters. The Senate wants to
hold ship owners entirely responsible when spills harm the U.S.
coast.
   ``Unfortunately, the debate over the international convention is
exactly where it was six months ago and six years ago,'' Studds
said. ``If we don't do something to break the logjam, we'll be
debating this issue until every beach in America has been coated
with oil.''
   Studds wrote to 100 members of the conference committee Thursday
to explain his compromise proposal.
   Under Studds' compromise, the United States would participate in
the international protocols for up to five years and during that
time would try to strengthen their oil spill provisions. ``If the
negotiations are successful, we would continue to participate in
the global agreements,'' Studds said. ``If not, we would go our own
way.''

<HEAD>House OKs Amendment to Water-Projects Bill</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The House overwhelmingly passed legislation
Thursday that would prevent huge corporate farms from receiving
federally subsidized water and force growers to chose between crop
price supports and low-cost water.
   The two measures, directed primarily at farmers in California
and other western states, aim at curbing what critics say is an
abuse of the Bureau of Reclamation system. The federal government
has been building dams in the West since early in this century to
supply water for farming.
   Both measures were amendments to a routine water projects bill
that passed by a voice vote. The projects bill authorized spending
for modifications to the Buffalo Bill Dam and reservoir in Wyoming.
   The first of the two amendments, which passed by a 316-97 vote,
would tighten ownership rules to end abuses of size limit on farms
that can receive federally subsidized water.
   The General Accounting Office and other investigations found
that corporate farms of as much as 23,000 acres were receiving
subsidized water, despite a 960-acre limit. This was done through
creating a patchwork quilt of farms that were separately owned only
on paper.
   ``We're not telling people they have to get rid of their land or
their water,'' said Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., sponsor of the
amendment. ``We're saying that a farmer reaches a certain point
where he no longer needs to receive a costly federal subsidy.''
   The second of the two amendments, which passed 338-55, would
phase out irrigation subsidies to grow surplus crops. That
amendment was introduced by Rep. Sam Gejdenson, D-Conn.
   ``It does not do away with irrigation subsidies altogether,''
said Rep. Thomas E. Petri, R-Wis., in support of the amendment.
``It merely requires farmers to chose one subsidy or the other.''
   The Agriculture Department says that in 1986, commodity payments
of nearly $380 million went to farmers using Bureau of Reclamation
projects. At the same time, according to the Interior Department
figures cited by backers of the amendment, farmers growing surplus
crops received $830 million worth of irrigation subsidies.
   Rep. Charles Pashayan Jr., R-Calif., said the subsidy bill could
be particularly harmful to small farmers.
   ``It is an amendment whose result will be to discourage
production of that very thing at which Americans are the very best
at in the world: namely food and fiber,'' he said.

   Government and education officials said
Thursday that the nation has failed non-college bound youth but
efforts are underway to better connect the path students travel
from school to the work force.
   ``From birth to the end of their working lives, we invest less
in our blue collar work force than any of the major countries with
which we compete,'' said Marc Tucker, president of the National
Center on Education and the Economy.
   ``We give them less care when they are infants and children. We
expect less of them in school. We give them less job training when
they start out. We let them sink or swim when they try to get into
the work force. And we provide them with less training once they
are at work.''
   Tucker's comments echoed a report by the General Accounting
Office that claimed the attention of a hearing by a Joint Economic
subcommittee. The report said 9 million Americans are ill-equipped
to hold entry-level jobs, while England, Germany, Japan and Sweden
all do a better job of preparing non-college bound youth for
employment.
   Raymond Uhalde of the Department of Labor said the agency
``generally agrees with the findings'' but stressed the upcoming
reauthorization of the Carl D. Perkins Vocational Education Act
``is likely to promote new connections between academic and
occupational skills and curricula.''
   Uhalde said the legislation would encourage the development of
new curricula and technology that teach basic skills in the context
of occupationally oriented education.
   Franklin Frazier, director of the GAO Office of Education and
Employment Issues, said the study found the four competitor nations
have national policies that guide students' transition from school
to work.
   Many of the countries establish competency-based national
training standards that they use to certify skill competency. The
common U.S. practice is to certify only program completion.
   The study also found that competitors invest extensively in
jobless out-of-school youth to assure them a job or further
education and training. U.S. employment and training programs reach
only a modest proportion of youth in need.
   The study had been requested by Rep. James Scheuer, D-N.Y.,
chairman of the committee's Education and Health Subcommittee, and
Rep. Augustus Hawkins, D-Calif., a JEC member and chairman of the
House Education and Labor Committee. They asked for a comparison of
how the United States and competitor countries prepare non-college
youth for employment because of the perception that foreign
competitors excel in world trade with better-educated workers.
   Gordon Ambach, executive director of the Council of Chief State
School Officers, said resolving the problem has become the group's
top priority for the next year.
   Ambach, noting action should begin in November, said the council
is designing new ways for youth to enter the work force, including
apprenticeships.

   Carolyn Reynolds, former program director of
the Arts &amp; Entertainment cable television network, will become
director of television and special projects for the John F. Kennedy
Center for the Performing Arts, it was announced Thursday.
   Neither James D. Wolfensohn, the Kennedy Center's new chairman,
nor the center's press office would say what Wolfensohn had in mind
for the TV venture that Ms. Reynolds will direct.
   It was not known whether he envisions televising the center's
regular theater, dance and music programs, or whether the center
would originate its own TV productions. Wolfensohn had said
previously he wanted to expand the Kennedy Center's audiences
nationwide.
   Television ``holds great promise for the center,'' he said in a
statement. ``Reaching beyond the six wonderful theaters we have in
the building, television offers us a ``seventh stage,' a stage with
tremendous possibility for the performing arts to reach millions of
people the world over.''
   Ms. Reynolds, who also was community development director in her
six years at A&amp;E, also will be responsible for planning and
supervising such special projects as the Kennedy Center's Texas
Festival in June 1991 and the Festival of the Americas planned for
1992.

   Hundreds of rioting Jews rushed into a
Palestinian neighborhood and hurled stones at homes Thursday after
an Arab woman stabbed an 11-year-old Jew in east Jerusalem.
   The wounding of the boy was the second such attack in mostly
Arab east Jerusalem in three days. Mayor Teddy Kollek blamed the
stabbing on Arab fears of Israel's new right-wing government.
   After dark, angry Jewish residents blocked a major road in East
Talpiot, the Jewish neighborhood where the stabbing took place.
They shouted ``Death to the Arabs!'' while others drove around in
their cars, honking the horns, witnesses and police said.
   Police brought in reinforcements, but some rioters broke through
police lines and threw stones at houses in neighboring Sur Baher,
an Arab village. They also set fire to bushes and an olive grove
there, police reports said.
   Groups of Palestinians from Sur Baher met the attackers with a
barrage of stones, and paramilitary border police fired tear gas to
disperse them. Police then forced the Jewish protesters back to
East Talpiot.
   There were no immediate reports of any injuries or arrests in
the riot, which lasted for about three hours. The national Itim
news agency estimated about 500 Jews took part in the protest.
   The stabbed boy, Idan Mizrahi, was waiting at a bus stop at the
edge of East Talpiot in Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem when the
woman approached and stabbed him, according to authorities and
media reports.
   Idan was reported in good condition at a hospital after surgeons
removed the knife from his back.
   Police said the woman fled toward Sur Baher. Police cordoned off
the area and searched for her, taking 25 Palestinian women in for
questioning, Police Chief Arye Bibi said.
   Bibi said the attacker was motivated by Palestinian nationalism.
   On Tuesday, a Palestinian knifed and wounded a 17-year-old
Jewish seminary student outside east Jerusalem's walled Old City.
Police said they are holding a suspect who confessed.
   Before Thursday's riots, Jewish residents in the East Talpiot
area, angry about the stabbing, had demanded better security from
Police Minister Ronnie Milo.
   ``There is no doubt this is a serious incident, and it requires
us to think again ... how to recruit the full amount of resources
and forces to confront the problem of uprising here in Jerusalem,
in Israel and other places,'' Milo said.
   Palestinians in December 1987 began fighting occupation of
territories seized by Israel from neighboring Arab states in the
1967 Middle East War. Most of the violence has been confined to the
Gaza Strip and West Bank, but some Palestinians want resistance
stepped up in Arab east Jerusalem.
   Israeli also seized east Jerusalem in 1967, later annexing it
and declaring Jerusalem the capital of the Jewish state.
   Kollek, a Jew, blamed Thursday's stabbing on the breakdown of
the peace process and also cited the formation of a new right-wing
government in Israel.
   ``I imagine the Arabs are scared and worried. ... I'm certain
there won't be war, and this government would do all it can to
bring peace about. But until something happens, people who are
scared do all kinds of foolish things,'' Kollek said.
   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, leader of the right-wing Likud
bloc, took the helm of a new government this week with backing from
hard-line religious parties.
   The left-of-center Labor Party brought down the previous
government, saying it should have accepted U.S. proposals to open
peace talks with Palestinians.
   In the occupied West Bank on Thursday, the decapitated body of
Ibrahim Sahnawi, a suspected Arab informer, was found on a hilltop
near Jenin refugee camp, Arab reporters said. The army confirmed
the death.
   In the 30-month-old uprising, 717 Palestinians have been killed
by Israelis, and 45 Israelis have been killed.

   You say 2 Live Crew's too bad for you?
   Meet Mary Morello, a 66-year-old retired school teacher
organizing some like-minded folk in Chicago's suburbs and beyond to
defend the right to rock from those who would might rather have it
muzzled.
   ``I think we have to be really careful about ... freedom of
speech, '' said Morello, who has sent about 350 letters to rally
support for her fledgling group, Parents for Rock and Rap.
   ``It seems sometimes people don't notice if some of their rights
are taken away,'' she said recently.
   The former teacher of African Studies and World History went to
work for rock after seeing a promotional film by the Arlington,
Va.-based Parents' Music Resource Center, which has helped in the
fight against explicit lyrics.
   The film, shown by a police officer at a PTA meeting in her town
of Libertyville, a suburb northwest of Chicago, was ``a little
dull,'' but nonetheless sensationalized the impact of rock and rap
music on young people's thinking, she said.
   ``I introduced myself ... and spoke for about 10 minutes about
the right of artists to have their music and art be uncensored,''
she said.
   She got another push from her son, Tom, a 26-year-old Harvard
University graduate and full-time musician in Lock Up, a hard-rock
band, who sent his mother some material on music censorship.
   The elder Morello last month obtained a mailing list from Long
Beach, Calif.-based Rock and Roll Confidential, which distributes
an anti-censorship pamphlet.
   Using $100 in seed money, she asked people on the mailing list
to be on the alert for possible censorship and to join her
coalition.
   So far, she has received about 30 responses to the initial
mailing, and envisions a state-by-state organization that will
monitor legislation and ``be an alternate voice on this issue of
censoring.''
   ``I don't think anyone should feel fear about writing something
or performing something in a democracy,'' Morello said.
   However, the Parents' Music Resource Center said the issue is
not censorship, but an entertainment culture that is increasingly
violent and explicit.
   ``We need to work with parents to help teach their children to
be more critical and to make better choices,'' Executive Director
Jennifer Norwood said Thursday.
   Morello's son, lead guitarist for Lock Up, said his mother comes
to her cause naturally.
   ``My mom has always been a very independent thinker,'' Tom said
from Dallas, where his band was performing. ``She introduced me to
the Temptations and Stevie Wonder. I returned the favor by
introducing her to Jimi Hendrix and Led Zepplin.''
   The elder Morello said she even defends 2 Live Crew, a raunchy
rap band thrust into the national spotlight after a federal judge
in Florida last week declared their last album, ``As Nasty as They
Wanna Be,'' obscene.
   ``I bought their album, I listened to it,'' she said.
   ``Have you heard it? Well, that isn't the way I talk or the way
people talk to me,'' she said. ``But that's the album _ and that's
2 Live Crew's own business.''

   He's only 9, but Michael Hanner already is a hot
sports commodity _ playing hardball on the field and at the
bargaining table.
   The Little Leaguer raised a ruckus when he refused to join a
team competing in a higher division after it drafted him in
mid-season. League officials then tried to enforce a rule to keep
the pitcher-shortstop from playing with his original team, the
Phillies.
   ``The rule still stands,'' said his lawyer, Paul Carey. ``But
Michael gets to play baseball, and that was the outcome we wanted
from day one.''
   Attorney David Berkey, who represented Kirkland National Little
League, said it settled the case because a legal battle would have
been too costly.
   ``The Little League couldn't see spending a bunch of money to
see if the rule was valid,'' Berkey said.
   The Phillies have three more games, including the season finale
on June 20, Michael's 10th birthday.

   A powerful bomb exploded at a
British Army training area outside Hanover on Thursday, badly
damaging an unoccupied building and breaking windows in nearby
homes.
   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack.
However, the British military has been the target of a rash of
bombings and shooting attacks in Western Europe carried out by the
Irish Republican Army as part of its terror campaign to end British
rule in Northern Ireland.
   Maj. Leslie Hutchison, spokesman for the 4th Armored Division,
said no one was near the site of Thursday's explosion.
   However, he added, ``There was quite severe damage to the side
of an unoccupied building which is normally used as a lecture
hall.''
   The training area is on the Weser River 12 miles southwest of
Hanover in Lower Saxony state. Hutchinson said it is used primarily
by the British Army's 35th Engineer Regiment and the 28th
Amphibious Regiment.
   A 4th Armored Division spokeswoman, Lynne Gammond, later told
The Associated Press in a telephone interview that investigators
had determined the explosion was caused by ``a bomb, probably made
up of plastic explosives.''
   She said the bomb also broke windows in German homes across a
busy highway about 25 yards away.
   ``It's a wonder some Germans were not injured,'' Ms. Gammond
said.
   She said it was too early to determine who had carried out the
attack.
   ``To say at this point it was the IRA would be speculation. The
investigation is still being conducted,'' Ms. Gammond said.
   Thursday's explosion comes 12 days after the IRA claimed
responsibility for the shooting death of British Army Maj. Michael
John Dillon-Lee as he was returning to his home in Dortmund before
dawn on June 2.
   The same day one British soldier was shot to death and two
soldiers were wounded in a daylight attack at a rail station in
Lichfield, central England.
   Dillon-Lee was the 14th person killed by the IRA in Europe since
1978.
   The predominantly Catholic IRA is fighting to unite Northern
Ireland, which is 60 percent Protestant, with the 95 percent
Catholic Irish Republic.

<HEAD>Gore Questions Administration Committment To Combat Global Warning</HEAD>

   The Bush administration came under renewed
attack for its policies on global warming Thursday as a senator
charged that oil-rich Saudi Arabia was allowed to scuttle an
aggressive response strategy at a recent international conference.
   Sen. Albert Gore, D-Tenn., questioned why a United Nations
panel, headed by the United States, recently failed to include
among its option for dealing with global warming specific targets
for pollution controls.
   ``Instead you seemed to be recommending that we do nothing,'' he
told the head of the U.S. delegation to the conference, Frederick
Bernthal at a Senate hearing on global warming.
   Bernthal was chairman of the working group that at a conference
in Geneva recently drafted a formal series of responses that
nations should take to deal with the global warming issue. The
final draft which will be released later this year will not include
specific recommendations or timetables for pollution controls,
Bernthal said.
   Gore charged that at the conference the delegation from Saudi
Arabia repeatedly blocked any attempt to come up with specific
pollution controls without the United States responding. The
burning of fossil fuels, including oil, is the source of carbon
dioxide, which accounts for about half of the global warming
pollutants that go into the atmosphere.
   Gore questioned why the U.S. delegation did not counter the
arguments made by the Saudi delegation, which he said was
represented that country's oil ministry.
   ``Instead, the U.S. delegates sat on their hands, saying very
little while the Saudis and some others blasted the hell out of any
policy option that would have led to (pollution) reductions,'' said
Gore.
   Bernthal said there was no hope of gaining a consensus on
specific pollution control goals. ``Every country in the room would
have had a different answer,'' he said.
   Scientists generally agree that manmade pollution, primarily
from the burning of fossil fuels, is causing the earth to become
warmer. The Bush administration has argued repeatedly, however,
that no specific commitments for pollution control should be made
until the severity of the threat becomes clearer.
   Three study groups of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change have attempted for more than a year to examine
the severity of the problem and what responses nations should take.
   Bernthal's working group is focusing on response strategies.
   Environmentalists have for months criticized Bush for failing to
announce specific reductions in carbon dioxide emissions. Several
European countries, including the Dutch, West Germany and Great
Britain, have announced such goals.

<TEXT>
   President Vaclav Havel's Civic
Forum, victor in Czechoslovakia`s free elections, refused to take
no for an answer Thursday and said it still wants a coalition with
the Christian Democratic alliance.
   The Civic Forum and its Slovak ally, Public Against Violence,
won 170 of the 300 seats in Parliament last weekend, but fell short
of the three-fifths majority it needs in both chambers to pass
major constitutional changes.
   The Christian Democratic Union, a loose grouping of three
parties, won 40 seats, far less than it expected but enough to
block constitutional changes in the Slovak part of parliament's
150-seat House of Nations.
   The Slovak Christian Democratic Movement is the strongest of the
three parties. Its leader, Jan Carnogursky, said on TV Tuesday
night he will not play ``fifth fiddle'' in the government and
wanted half the seats in the new Cabinet.
   Informed sources close to the coalition talks said Carnogursky
also saw himself as a candidate for the job of premier. Havel has
already charged the incumbent, ex-Communist Marian Calfa, with
forming a government.
   Observers see the nomination of Calfa, a career Communist Party
official who only turned in his party card in January, as the
likely source of friction in the talks. Civic Forum officials said
they still hope to break the deadlock.
   Civic Forum spokeswoman Jana Ryslinkova told journalists
Thursday, ``During the last talks between the Civic Forum and the
Christian Democratic Union, there was nothing said or done that
could be considered as the final end of coalition talks. No
ultimatums were given on either side.
   ``On behalf of the Civic Forum, I can confirm that we shall do
our best to form a coalition with the Christian Democrats.''
   One key issue in the talks is the Interior Ministry.
   Richard Sacher, a leader of the People's Party, which is in the
Christian Democratic Union, is the incumbent minister. But Sacher
has come under fire for alleged reluctance to investigate past
operations of the hated secret police.
   He has further been hurt by allegations by Havel aides that
People's Party Chairman Josef Bartoncik was a paid secret police
agent for 17 years.
   Bartoncik's party announced his suspension on Thursday.
   People's Party General Secretary Jiri Cerny resigned hours later
over what party officials described as a personal matter.
   The disarray in not confined to the Christian Democrat camp. Jan
Urban abruptly resigned as Civic Forum's campaign manager on
Monday, the day after its election victory.
   At least two prominent people who won parliamentary mandates for
Civic Forum said they will not take their seats, meaning lesser
known, inexperienced people will become deputies.
   Talks on forming governments in the country's two republics, the
Czech and Slovak republics, proceeded more smoothly.
   Slovak Interior Minister Vladimir Meciar, a member of Public
Against Violence, was given the job of forming the Slovak
government on Thursday, the official news agency CTK said.

<HEAD>Energy Secretary Orders Go-Ahead on New Mexico Waste Installation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Energy Secretary James Watkins on Thursday
ordered his department to go ahead with development of a
radioactive waste repository in New Mexico, saying it meets all
required environmental laws.
   But he said the plant near Carlsbad, N.M., will not receive any
radioactive wastes until January at the earliest because of
continuing tests.
   ``I will not compromise health or safety concerns to meet any
schedule,'' said Watkins.
   The department's Waste Isolation Pilot Plant will accept highly
radioactive waste over a five year test period beginning next year,
he said.
   Watkins signed a formal ``record of decision'' on a supplement
to the environmental impact statement for the plant, certifying
that the plant meets federal environmental laws.
   The department said, however, further tests would be conducted
on some environmental issues such as gas generated from metal drums
and wastes created as a result of corrosion or bacterial action.
   The plant will be the country's first central repository for
radioactive wastes from nearly a dozen nuclear weapons plants. The
wastes will be placed in salt beds 2,150 feet under the ground.
   The department ``has made significant progress in resolving the
issues under our direct control in order to conduct the test phase
in an environmentally safe manner,'' said Watkins.
   ``We have a consensus from the scientific community that DOE
should begin the test phase at the earliest time possible
commensurate with satisfactory completion of applicable safety
requirements,'' he said.
   In Boise, Idaho, Gov. Cecil D. Andrus said he was encouraged by
Watkins' announcement, but ``Idahoans have seen many previous
deadlines for opening WIPP come and go.''
   Idaho and some other western states have refused to accept more
waste from the Energy Department.

<HEAD>FAA Finds Some Fairchild Planes Prone to Mid-Flight Window Loss</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Owners of small passenger planes made by
Fairchild Aircraft Corp. have been ordered not to let passengers
sit by windows that may be prone to break in mid-flight.
   The Federal Aviation Administration airworthiness directive
issued Tuesday bars passengers from riding in seat ``2E'' on the
right side of the plane unless a double-paned window is installed.
   Horizon Air President John Kelly said Tuesday that double-pane
windows were being installed on the company's Fairchild Metro III
turboprop under a company decision made before the directive was
issued.
   The directive stems from an incident Saturday in which a window
broke on a Horizon flight between Portland, Ore., and Yakima,
leaving a hole an inch in diameter.
   Three weeks ago, a Portland man on a Horizon flight from
Portland to Seattle was partially sucked out of a Metro III when
the window by his seat _ 2E _ shattered about 14,000 feet over
Olympia.
   A similar incident occurred in Europe in 1988.
   ``The FAA has received three reports of the second passenger
window on the right side breaking in flight on Fairchild SA226 and
SA227 series airplanes. In each of these reports the airplane was
flying in icing conditions,'' the directive said.
   ``Ice shed from the propeller may have struck the window,
causing either holes or cracks. In two reports the weakened window
could not contain the cabin pressure, which resulted in rapid cabin
decompression.''
   Plane owners have 30 days to follow the directive. Until they
do, they must post signs at 2E saying: ``Do not occupy this seat at
any time.''
   Michele Owsley of the FAA in Texas said the problem of
mid-flight window breakage may be unique to Fairchild planes.
   She said concern was raised after a cockpit window blew out and
caused an injury in 1988. That incident resulted in an FAA order
for inspection of windows to check for cracks after every 2,500
hours of service, roughly five months.
   Bob Kennison, assistant to the president of Fairchild Aircraft
Corp., said Monday he did not know whether the company had more
window problems than other manufacturers of small passenger
airplanes.

   President Bush marked Flag Day with a dawn
visit to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Thursday while a Medal of
Honor-winning senator said he was ashamed of Bush's recent actions
concerning a constitutional amendment on flag burning.
   ``Today, in quiet glory, the Stars and Stripes continue to
proclaim the shining promise of America,'' Bush said in a statement
released after he visited the memorial. He proclaimed not only Flag
Day but Flag Week.
   Later, veterans in American Legion and Amvets caps, along with
camera-carrying tourists, swarmed over Capitol Hill where rows of
American flags hung limp in the heat while lawmakers poured forth
Flag Day oratory.
   On Main Streets across the nation, Americans decked front
porches with American flags in honor of the day.
   Bush called on ``all Americans to observe Flag Day and Flag Week
by flying the Stars and Stripes from their homes and other suitable
places.''
   He said nothing about the proposed constitutional amendment,
which passed its first hurdle in the House on Wednesday, two days
after the Supreme Court threw out last year's flag protection law.
   To become part of the Constitution, the amendment will need
two-thirds support in both the House and the Senate and
ratification by 38 state legislatures.
   ``On this joyous occasion, may we also renew our determination
to uphold the ideals enshrined in our Constitution and Declaration
of Independence,'' the president said in his statement.
   Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., who won the Medal of Honor in Vietnam,
called the push for a flag amendment ``an attempt to divide
America, to divide fathers against sons.'' He said it would reopen
``the generation gap'' of the Vietnam era.
   Kerrey held up a picture of Bush laughing at a White House
meeting as Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan., held a flag _ a picture, the
senator said, that showed the real point of the debate was to gain
``political advantage.''
   ``I am ashamed of what he did,'' Kerrey declared in an
impassioned speech on the Senate floor.
   ``He has chosen to divide his country on an issue that, frankly,
in my opinion, should not be given this much attention,'' Kerrey
later told a rally of congressional veterans against the amendment.
   Sen. John C. Danforth, R-Mo., parting company with conservative
colleagues, took the Senate floor to oppose the amendment.
   ``We, thank God, do not live in a brittle, fragile country,
because in our country anybody is free to express himself,''
Danforth said.
   The debate over the flag resounded in incidents across America.
   Townspeople of Northfield, Minn., awoke to find 3,000 small
plastic flags planted in their lawns by employees of a real estate
company ``as an important part of our heritage.'' But one local
critic grumbled that it was `an intrusive political statement.''
   Elsewhere:
   _Retired Cincinnati librarian Paul Payne, 81, vowed to burn a
flag to protest a U.S. policy of ``bullying little nations,
supporting murder and massacre.'' But he changed his mind and the
scene in Fountain Square turned into a celebration as a radio
station gave away small American flags.
   _Vermont State Archivist Gregory Sanford in Montpelier declared
himself ``enflamed by the controversy over flag burning'' and said
the government should require flag makers to use fireproof cloth.
   _Pittsburgh Boy Scouts marched, sang and recited the Pledge of
Allegiance as a flag featuring a star cut out by each of the
nation's governors was hoisted in a downtown plaza.
   _Bloomfield, N.J., flag maker Ann Oliver complained about the
Supreme Court's decision Monday. ``I understand the legal point,
but after 22 years of making the flag, you don't like to see it
burned,'' she said.
   _Harvard law Professor Alan Dershowitz told a Philadelphia Bar
Association luncheon that diluting guarantees of free speech would
be a mistake: ``I don't believe the constitution should be amended
during a time of frenzy.''
   _In Omaha, 350 people wearing red, white and blue shirts formed
a human version of the American flag. Radio station WOW AM-FM
sponsored the early morning flag fest at which American Legion
members fired a 21-gun salute.
   Dole, the Senate Republican leader, won a commitment from Senate
Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, to hold a Senate vote on
the flag amendment before Congress' Fourth of July recess.
   In the House, Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., has said a vote
could come as early as next week and certainly before the holiday
break.
   The issue was rekindled Monday when the Supreme Court in a 5-4
decision threw out as unconstitutional a federal law approved last
year that would have banned burning and other desecration of the
American flag.
   Dole scoffed at the notion that flag burning represents free
speech and thus should not be outlawed. ``It's malicious, stupid,
irresponsible conduct, not speech,'' Dole said.
   On the other hand, Sen. Terry Sanford, D-N.C., scorned
statements that a flag-burning ban would put only a small limit on
free speech.
   ``That's like saying I'm going to take a little tiny sliver out
of your heart,'' Sanfashington-based
Paralyzed Veterans of America.
   Elsewhere, former Solicitor General Erwin N. Griswold joined
American Bar Association leaders in denouncing the flag-burning
amendment as a dangerous attack on the Bill of Rights.
   By proposing the amendment Bush ``responded too quickly and too
readily to some of his political adisers who saw during the last
election campaign what a potent vote getter wrapping yourself in
the flag was,'' said Griswold, a former Harvard Law School dean who
served Presidents Johnson and Nixon.

   With a proposal this week, the New York Stock
Exchange has laid plans it hopes will lead to round-the-clock stock
trading.
   Financial observers caution that 24-hour trading, an idea that
has been under discussion and study for the past two decades or
more, is likely to develop only slowly and in stages.
   In any event, they say, the image of mad midnight scrambles to
buy IBM or sell AT&amp;T remains a distant prospect rather than an
impending reality.
   The NYSE, which now operates from 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. Eastern
time Monday through Friday, has come up with plans to begin
experimenting with after-hours trading later this year. Chairman
John J. Phelan Jr. said Thursday the plan could lead to
round-the-clock trading by the year 2000.
   In its early stages, the proposal provides for ``auctions'' to
handle orders in individual stocks in batches at 8 p.m., midnight
and 5 a.m., starting sometime in 1991.
   This presumably would provide individual investors with a chance
to act more quickly on news that breaks or decisions they make when
the market now is closed.
   But analysts agree that is not the primary driving force behind
the plan. Rather, they say, the NYSE is trying to keep or regain
business involving large institutional customers that is drifting
away to competitors, notably markets in Europe and Japan.
   Secondly, they add, the proposal is a response to pressure from
technological advances that have made international trading by
computer and advanced communications systems increasingly
attractive and economical.
   ``This is an awareness by the management of the NYSE that
electronic trading will be more and more important as we move
through the 1990s,'' said Perrin Long, a securities industry
analyst at the firm of Lipper Analytical Services.
   Wall Street has been moving, however slowly, in the direction of
24-hour stock trading for a long time. In 1974, the NYSE and other,
smaller markets based in the eastern United States extended the
close of business from 3:30 p.m. to 4 p.m.
   Then in 1985, the opening was advanced from 10 a.m. to 9:30
a.m., in a direct response to growth of European trading in U.S.
stocks.
   Also, observers point out, as finance has become an increasingly
global business, markets for foreign currency exchange and bonds
already have gone to what amounts to around-the-clock global
trading.
   Why not just adopt a we-never-close policy for the stock market
as well, and be done with the question? Many members of the stock
exchange's various constituencies long have had reasons for
resisting the idea.
   Brokers who deal with the public, for example, have been
reluctant to take on the extra operating expense without better
assurance that there will sufficient demand for their services
during the off-hours.
   At the same time, automation of trades is seen as a threat to
the brokers, called specialists, who operate on stock exchange
trading floors as a kind of meeting point for buy and sell orders.
   If their function could somehow be filled at night by ``black
boxes,'' the reasoning goes, it probably wouldn't be long before
the same machines were taking over in the daytime as well.
   For their part, specialists maintain that they serve their
function better than computers could any time.
   The prospect of after-hours trading also raises other questions:
How would the transactions be reported in the news media, and how
would they be accounted for in the market averages and indexes?
   If stocks can trade at midnight, what about options and futures
contracts on stocks and stock indexes? If there no were no official
``closing'' price each day, what substitute standard might be used
for such legal purposes as the valuing of gifts and estates?
   Some of these questions might yield easy answers, and others
prove more stubborn. But in the eyes of a good many observers, even
the most difficult seem likely only to delay, not to prevent, the
movement toward an around-the-clock, around-the-world stock market.
   ``We are on the road to 24-hour trading,'' said Harrison Roth, a
specialist in stock options trading at the New York firm of Cowen &amp;
Co. ``There's no doubt about it.''

   Tens of thousands of miners called to
the capital by President-elect Ion Iliescu to help put down
anti-government protests on Thursday clubbed passers-by and
journalists and occupied the offices of the main opposition
newspaper.
   Few police and soldiers were visible late Thursday in Bucharest.
The miners, armed with cudgels, their faces and work clothes still
smudged with coal dust, were apparently left to maintain order in
this city of 2.2 million residents as they saw fit.
   In reaction to the disorder in this capital and violence that
left at least five people dead and 350 injured, the state news
agency Rompress said the newly elected Parliament, which had been
scheduled to meet on Thursday, had delayed its session until Monday.
   Miners streamed into Bucharest from as far away as 240 miles
after two days of unrest in which security forces clashed with
demonstrators who claim the governing National Salvation Front of
Iliescu is dominated by Communists associated with the ousted
regime of dictator Nicolae Ceausescu.
   Ceausescu and his wife, Elena, were executed Dec. 25, three days
after an uprising began when 94 protesters were killed by
government forces in the western city of Timisoara. The government
says a total of 1,038 civilians and soldiers died in the
pro-democratic revolution.
   The latest casualties occurred when police cleared a 2-month-old
demonstration from a central square Wednesday, then fired on
protesters who attacked government buildings and overturned cars,
setting them ablaze.
   It was the worst violence in Romania since the uprising paved
the way for free elections last month that were won by Iliescu, the
interim President, and his National Salvation Front.
   In Washington, President Bush's office condemned ``in the
strongest possible terms'' what it called ``government-inspired
vigilante violence.'' White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater
said the violence ``departs from the commonly accepted norms of
democracy and the rule of law.''
   Iliescu late Wednesday called in a televised speech for all
``democraticforces'' to come to the aid of his embattled government.
   Iliescu shortened the miners' workweek and raised their pay
after the revolt, and in return the miners have been staunch
supporters of his National Salvation Front.
   Early Thursday, soldiers fired at demonstrators who threw
firebombs at police headquarters and sporadic gunfire echoed across
Bucharest.
   Then the miners arrived, carrying clubs, rubber hoses and other
crude weapons.
   Dozens of people were assaulted, others butted repeatedly by the
helmeted miners, estimated to number in the tens of thousands.
   As a Western radio reporter was pulled away from a group of
grim-faced miners in central University Square, a heavy-set woman
egged the miners on, urging them to kill the reporter's colleagues.
   In another development, the government Thursday announced the
resignation of Gen. Mihai Chitac as interior minister.
   No official reason was given, but Chitac had already been under
fire for allegedly helping to put down anti-Communist protests in
December. Because his ministry is responsible for the police, his
replacement also was thought to be linked to the police attack on
the demonstrators Wednesday.
   Less than a mile from the square, about 10 miners besieged the
residence of Iliescu critic Dimitru Mazilu for several hours before
dispersing, said Mazilu and a neighbor. The former vice president
of the post-revolutionary government stepped down following charges
that he collabrated with the Securitate, the secret police force
that killed hundreds during the revolution.
   The miners were apparently directed by several men who Mazilu
said were ``Securitate or former Securitate'' agents. Mazilu told
reporters who arrived at his apartment that the agents urged the
miners to kill him.
   Mazilu said the miners left after he called government officials.
   In London, the son of Romanian National Peasant Party leader Ion
Ratiu told The Associated Press his father had been beaten and
taken from his house in Bucharest by miners.
   Nicolae Ratiu, who lives in London, said his cousin told him by
telephone from Bucharest that he saw the miners pummel Ion Ratiu
and three other people and drag them from the house. Men who
claimed to be police were operating with the miners, he said.
   In Lyon, France, authorities said Thursday that 23 Romanian
tourists fearing a new dictatorship in their country have asked
France for political asylum.
   The miners in Bucharest also occupied opposition party
headquarters.
   Other government suporters ransacked the headquarters of the
opposition Liberal Party, as well as Bucharest University's Faculty
of Foreign Languages.
   Miners milled around University Square at nightfall Thursday,
demanding identity papers from foreign journalists and those they
suspected of being anti-government symphathizers.
   There was no indication when the miners would return to western
Romania. Some were seen leaving early Friday in trucks, but their
destination was unknown.
   Rompress quoted an unidentified miner as saying, ``The
hoolingans stayed for a couple of weeks. But we will stay until we
are sure that we reinstate order in the Romanian capital.''
   Rompres quoted a miners' communique demanding the closure of
Romania Libera, the main newspaper critical of Iliescu and his
government.
   Romania Libera said later its editorial offices were occupied by
people who claimed they were print workers, a staff member was
roughed up, and executive offices were ransacked, according to
Rompres.
   A group of miners took control of the corridor outside the
editorial board's offices, disrupting work, and the board appealed
to the government in the name of freedom of the press for help,
Rompres said.
   During the violence Thursday, people in military trucks handed
the government supporters milk and bread.
   Unidentified people in a van carrying loudspeakers warned
passers-by: ``Don't incite the miners ... you would thus give birth
to fierce violence.''
   The speakers also instructed the miners to grab journalists and
take them into the van. ``We will take care of them,'' the speakers
said.
   Ovidiu Bogdan, 28, a photographer for the Gamma photo agency,
said he was attacked by men armed with iron-ended clubs in central
Bucharest.
   An AP reporter was clubbed before being rescued by an
acquaintance in the army.
   Iliescu is the first ex-Communist to win a popular presidential
election in Eastern Europe. He and the National Salvation Front won
May 20 elections by a landslide.

   Police delivered another blow to the
powerful Medellin cocaine cartel by killing the man who
masterminded a 10-month-old terror campaign that has killed
hundreds of people, police said Thursday.
   Hours after police killed the drug chieftain during a shootout
Wednesday night in an exclusive Medellin suburb, a car bomb
exploded near a police station in the same area Thursday.
   The blast killed four people, including two suspected terrorists
inside the car, and injured 43, a police spokeswoman said on
condition of anonymity.
   The bomb may have been in retaliation for the police killing of
Juan Jairo Arias, who officials said led the Medellin cocaine
cartel's vast network of hired killers.
   Members of Colombia's Elite Police Corps, a group specially
trained to fight drug traffickers, were tipped off on Arias's
whereabouts and tried to arrest him at a Medellin apartment, the
spokeswoman said.
   Arias resisted arrest and police shot and killed him, said the
spokeswoman, who commented on condition of anonymity in line with
government practice.
   A woman and a 6-month-old baby were also in the apartment but no
one else was harmed in the shooting, the spokeswoman said.
   A national police director, Gen. Octavio Vargas, told the
national radio network RCN that Arias's killing represented the
government's second most important victory in its war on drugs.
   ``He served as chief of the armed organization of the Medellin
cartel,'' Vargas said.
   The most important victory came in December when the Elite Corps
killed Gonzalo Rodriguez Gacha, the Medellin cartel's No. 2 boss.
   Vargas said Arias, 28, was the Medellin cartel's fifth most
important leader. The police director blamed him for the murders of
an attorney general, a state governor, a judge and a leading
journalist.
   Vargas said Arias was responsible for two car bomb attacks
against Colombia's secret police chief, Gen. Miguel Maza Marquez.
Those blasts killed at least 70 people, but Maza was not harmed.
   The Medellin cartel's campaign to murder police officers
continued Wednesday, when four more lawmen were slain.
   The cartel said in a statement Tuesday it was killing policemen
to avenge the ``tortures and murders'' by police of its associates
in Medellin.
   In April, drug traffickers offered to pay $4,300 to anyone
willing to kill a policeman. So far this year, 110 law officers
have been assassinated in Medellin, police say.
   The police spokeswoman said authorities relied on the ``support
and cooperation'' of Medellin residents to locate Arias. Police
have offered to pay $200,000 for information leading to the capture
of cartel leaders.
   Officials blame drug traffickers for killing around 400 people
since last August, when the government of President Virgilio Barco
began its most sweeping anti-drug crackdown.
   The cartel's reputed leader, Pablo Escobar, remains at large
despite a massive manhunt to find him.
   The drug war began in August, when traffickers were blamed for
the assassination of leading presidential hopeful Luis Carlos
Galan. Two more presidential candidates were assassinated before
last month's election, and traffickers were linked to at least one
of those.
   Since August, Barco's administration has extradited 15 drug
suspects and confiscated hundreds of properties belonging to the
cocaine magnates.
   Medellin, Colombia's second largest city, has about 3 million
residents.
   At one time, the Medellin cartel was believed responsible for
most of the cocaine that is smuggled into the United States.

<HEAD>Soviets Confirm Accident at Leningrad Nuclear Plant in 1975</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HELSINKI, Finland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union confirmed Thursday
that a major accident occurred at a nuclear power plant in
Leningrad in 1975, Finnish officials said.
   The officials said the nuclear reactors in the Leningrad plant
were similar to those at Chernobyl and that the accident was
``possibly of grade 3 _ in other words, a serious accident.''
   Radioactivity spread over parts of northern Europe in April 1986
after the reactor exploded at the Chernobyl nuclear plant in the
Soviet republic of Ukraine. At least 31 people were killed as a
direct result of that nuclear accident, the worst in history.
   However, the Finnish Center for Radiation and Nuclear Safety
said no radiation from the 1975 accident was detected in Finland,
60 miles at the nearest point from the plant. It made no mention of
any casualties.
   The center said the accident occurred when ``the fuel channel of
the number one reactor unit at the Leningrad nuclear plant was
damaged on Nov. 30, 1975, when it was started up, and short-term
radioactive substances were released into the atmosphere.''
   The recorded message said the information came from Soviet
nuclear officials after inquiries Thursday by the Finnish center.
   The message said, according to Soviet authorities, the release
of radioactivity was far less than the 1.5 million curies reported
in earlier press accounts. The Soviets have said 50 million curies
of radiation were released in the Chernobyl accident.
   ``Officials saw no reason to take special measures in the
immediate vicinity of the power plant, and the reactor was back in
use two weeks after the incident,'' the message added.

   Proceedings collapsed Thursday on the final
day of the Southern Baptist Convention because most of the
delegates had abandoned the scene, with the big battle for the
presidency over.
   Discussion of major moral and social issues _ including a severe
condemnation of homosexuals _ had to be scrapped for lack of a
quorum, with most of the circular tiers of seats empty in the vast
Louisiana Superdome.
   ``Once the row over election of a president was over, that was
it,'' said the Rev. Felix T. Zeigler of Venice, Fla. ``The crowd
couldn't be bothered.
   ``But there are other issues that are more important to
Christian faith than the personality of one man.''
   Longtime observers said it was the first time in memory that
convention decisions had to be dropped because people didn't show
up.
   The main draw was Tuesday's election of the Rev. Morris Chapman,
a fundamentalist from Wichita Falls, Texas, as president of the
14.9 million-member denomination. He defeated the moderate
candidate, the Rev. Daniel Vestal of the Atlanta suburb of
Dunwoody, by a 58 percent to 42 percent margin.
   Registered attendance at the convention had totalled 38,478, the
third largest in the history of the nation's largest Protestant
denomination. But under the rules, a quarter of them were needed to
conduct business.
   From 4,000 to 5,000 people were estimated on hand for the
morning session Thursday, and the number dwindled as the day went
on.
   The Rev. Mark Corts of Winston-Salem, N.C., chairman of a
resolutions committee, apologized from the podium for the
impossibility of taking up 11 pending proposals, some keenly
controversial.
   ``We worked through some significant issues and wanted your
opinion expressed,'' he said, adding that the untended proposals
were left for ``your encouragement and predilection.''
   The resolutions included one to oppose ``all efforts to gain
civil rights protection for homosexuals on the basis of sexual
preference.''
   The resolution called homoseuxality a ``morally unconscionable
learned behavior and lifesytle, not deserving of government support
and special civil rights protection as a minority.''
   Other proposals condemned government funding of ``offensive,
morally repugnant and sacrilegious'' art; called for changes in tax
laws to encourage mothers to stay home with their children; and
called for restrictions on broadcast advertising of alcholic
beverages.
   With decision-making on those issues gone by the wayside, the
remaining delegates listened to reports from commissions,
seminaries, boards and committees, interspersed with music,
hymn-singing and preaching.
   For 12 years running, fundamentalists have won the presidency,
whose appointive power determines the administration of the
denomination's huge network of agencies and institutions.
   Chapman said he would insist on adherence to specified standards
of belief, elaborated from a literalistic view of the Bible.
   The campaign watchword of fundamentalists has been that the
Bible is ``inerrant,'' without error historically, scientifically
and in other fields, that creation, Adam, Eve and biblical miracles
happened as as recounted.
   Screening has been inaugurated for personnel in several agencies
to assure conformity with those points, and some seminary
professors and others have come under fire for their views.

<TEXT>
   A party made up of former Communists won
the opening round in Bulgaria's first free elections in 58 years,
results showed Thursday, and was expected to win an absolute
majority in Parliament in weekend runoffs.
   The United States said widespread voter intimidation may have
figured in last Sunday's first-round balloting. But Zhelyu Zhelev,
leader of the main opposition alliance, hailed the showing his
people made in so short a time.
   Zhelev late Thursday ruled out any coalition with the governing
Socialist Party, though the Socialists said again they were
reluctant to go it alone. The Communist Party changed its name to
the Socialist Party in April.
   The opposition has only an outside chance of victory in Sunday's
runoff.
   Bulgaria is the only country in the Soviet Union's
disintegrating East bloc where former ruling Communists remain the
strongest political force.
   Final results announced Thursday gave the Socialists 172 of the
319 seats decided in the first round. They need to win 29 of 81
seats at stake next Sunday to capture a two-thirds majority in the
single-chamber, 400-seat Grand National Assembly. They already have
pledges of support from two independents.
   Zhelev's 16-party Union of Democratic Forces won 105 seats
Sunday and smaller opposition parties shared the rest. Observers
said if they teamed up in the runoffs, they conceivably could keep
the Socialists from controlling Parliament.
   Allegations surfaced of election irregularities in last Sunday's
balloting. Opposition supporters, angered at the prospect of a
victory by the former Communists, held protests and erected traffic
blockades in Sofia.
   In Washington, the State Department cited reports of polling
booths without curtains, transparent ballot envelopes and local
officials handing out ballots.
   ``There are many reports of local officials threatening voters
with loss of jobs, pensions or other benefits,'' spokeswoman
Margaret Tutwiler said. She said problems that came to light
``raise serious questions about the electoral process.''
   Zhelev declared at a news conference, however, ``This is a great
victory for the opposition which in only six months has raised
itself to become the second political force.
   ``It is also a great success that more than half of the voters
have voted against the Communists. The results are very good,''
   He said his alliance does not want to enter any coalition and
favors a government of ``competent people and experts.'' Western
diplomats here said this was a good possibility.
   Leaders of two smaller opposition parties, the Agrarian Party
and the mostly ethnic-Turkish Movement for Rights and Freedoms,
told separate news conferences they opposed a government alliance
with just the Socialists.
   Socialist leader Alexander Lilov predicted ultimate victory for
the Socialists after Sunday's runoff and promised faster changes
after the new government takes over.
   But Lilov reiterated at a news conference, ``We think democracy
in Bulgaria now needs all political forces'' to unite toward
resolving national problems.
   Prime Minister Andrei Lukanov and other Socialists called
earlier for a broad coalition to tackle Bulgaria's deep economic
troubles, including rising unemployment, food shortages and a $10
billion foreign debt.
   Lilov, a veteran Communist ideologist, had been sidelined by
Bulgaria's longtime, hard-line Communist leader, Todor Zhivkov.
   Defense Minister Dobri Dzhurov, a Socialist and the nation's
most popular political leader according to opinion polls, said the
party ``underwent a profound and positive change'' following
November's ouster of Zhivkov.
   In an interview with the newspaper Duma, Dzhurov said voters
endorsed the Socialists because of their new advocacy of
parliamentary democracy, a socially oriented market economy and
universal human values.
   Lukanov on Thursday held talks with Goldert Posthumus, executive
director of the International Monetary Fund, on Bulgaria's request
for IMF membership. The state news agency BTA said Bulgaria could
be admitted in September.
   The new parliament is also expected to draft a revised
constitution, which requires a two-thirds majority. It could take
up to 18 months to bring reforms to a vote.

<HEAD>Moscow City May Send Gasoline to Lithuania to Ensure Milk Supply</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: LEADS with six grafs to UPDATE with report Estonia rejecting

   Moscow city council on Thursday talked of sending
gasoline to Lithuania in violation of the Kremlin embargo because
Lithuania is running out of fuel to deliver milk to the Soviet
capital, a local news service reported.
   It was the latest sign of crumbling support for President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev's order to cut off all oil, most natural gas
and some raw material shipments to the Baltic republic in hope of
forcing it to rescind its declaration of independence.
   On Wednesday, the Kremlin gave the first sign it may be ready to
ease the blockade because of mounting domestic opposition. Kremlin
leaders offered a compromise that could lead to removal of
sanctions which have idled 26,000 workers.
   Estonian Premier Edgar Savisaar on Thursday rejected the latest
Kremlin offers of greater independence within a Soviet
confederation, saying Gorbachev was still presenting the Baltic
republics with an ``ultimatum'' to suspend their independence
drives, Dutch media reported.
   Savisaar was in the Netherlands to attend a gathering of
12th-century Northern European cities known as the Hansa League.
   Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov was reported to have told
Lithuanian Prime Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene on Wednesday that 15
percent of the republic's natural gas supply would be restored
soon. That would bring gas supplies to 30 percent of normal.
   No sign of the promised gas emerged Thursday, but the fertilizer
factory Ryzhkov said would be supplied was closed in any event for
a day of mourning, said Rita Dapkus, a spokeswoman for the
Lithuanian parliament.
   Residents in all three Baltic republics held services Thursday
remembering the 36,000 Lithuanians and 10,000 Estonians who were
deported to Siberia and the Far North on June 14, 1941, on orders
from Soviet dictator Josef Stalin. Many died in the harsh
conditions there.
   The three republics were forcibly annexed by the Soviet Union
while under army occupation in 1940. The deportations, even of
infants, were allegedly due to anti-Soviet agitation.
   Postfactum news service said the Moscow city council, which is
dominated by radical reformers, is considering sending gasoline to
Lithuania in rail tank cars guarded by council members.
   Food is always in short supply in the Soviet Union, but with
recent panic buying touched off by the government's plan to raise
food prices, Moscow officials are especially concerned about
keeping their current sources of dairy products.
   Newly elected Russian President Boris Yeltsin already has
promised to send supplies to Lithuania, and presidents of several
other republics reportedly told Gorbachev in a Kremlin meeting
Tuesday that the embargo should be stopped.
   At that Tuesday meeting, Gorbachev suggested transforming the
Soviet Union into a new, looser union of ``sovereign states,'' in
the hope that will hold his country together.
   Latvia and Estonia have joined Lithuania in demanding
independence, and several other republics have large organizations
pushing for secession. Russia challenged Gorbachev's authority on
Tuesday by declaring that its laws would take priority over
national ones, and the Ukraine may follow suit.
   A member of Gorbachev's Presidential Council advisory board,
Grigory Revenko, was reported as saying on Thursday that the
proposal for a new union treaty would allow each of the 15 Soviet
republics to set its own conditions for joining the union, on
federative or confederative principles.
   In Russian, these words are used to distinguish between a
U.S.-style federation of states within one country and a
confederation of independent nations like the European Community.
   ``Let them join the Common Market if they want it, and if a
republic has sufficient potential,'' Tass quoted Revenko as saying.
   Revenko suggested that the central government be left with
minimal duties, including constitutional and human rights, defense
and border protection, and part of foreign relations.
   ``Republics themselves, when joining the union with their
treaties, will determine which rights they will delegate to the
center,'' Tass quoted Revenko as saying.
   None of the three republics' parliaments took action Thursday on
compromise offers made by Gorbachev.
   He told Lithuania the Kremlin will lift the embargo and open
negotiations on independence if Lithuania agrees to freeze putting
its declaration into effect while negotiations are going on.
   Latvian legislators criticized President Anatoly Gorbunov for
saying he is ready to discuss freezing Latvia's May 4 declaration
of independence, because he had no authorization, according to the
Estonian news service ETA.
   Estonian President Arnold Ruutel said in a newspaper interview
that Gorbachev recognized Estonia's declaration that it is in a
transition period to full independence, ETA said.

   State Republicans rallied Wednesday behind
U.S. Sen. Dave Durenberger, who apologized to his colleagues and
constituents as the Senate Ethics Committee ended a hearing and
prepared to weigh his financial conduct.
   Opposition politicians renewed their calls for Durenberger's
resignation, saying he ducked his obligation to fully answer
allegations of misdeeds.
   ``He did not tell anything new and apparently did not dispute
the evidence,'' said Robert Vanasek, Democratic speaker of the
state House. ``It leads me to conclude that the senator has decided
he can tough this out. That it can go behind closed doors and that
the public will forget about it.''
   In an emotional, hourlong speech before the committee,
Durenberger said he takes ``full responsibility'' for ethical
lapses even though he never set out to break the rules.
   The committee ended its trial-like proceedings early as
requested by Durenberger's attorney, Jim Hamilton, who said
prolonging them would cost the senator too much in legal fees.
   Having accepted 23 volumes of evidence against Durenberger, the
committee now will weigh a recommendation by its special counsel,
Robert S. Bennett, that the Senate denounce the Minnesota
Republican for financial improprieties.
   The panel's vice chairman, Sen. Warren B. Rudman, R-N.H., said
the committee would have no problem making a judgment based on
written documents and statements by Durenberger, his lawyer and
Bennett.
   But Vanasek said Minnesota voters deserved to hear from
witnesses in an extended trial to better understand the case.
   He said Durenberger's apology and defense that ``all the key
decisions'' were taken with legal advice merely repeated what he
has said for five months.
   ``He should go to the governor, indicate to him he will resign
and he will run in a special election this fall,'' Vanasek said.
   State Democratic Party Chairman Todd Otis also called on
Durenberger to resign and let voters decide whether he should
return to Washington.
   ``If he is at peace with what he's done, that should not be a
problem,'' Otis said. ``It's just an outrage that a curtain is
coming down in front of them (the voters) before the play has even
started.''
   But Republican Bill Schreiber, state House minority leader,
labeled the resignation calls ludicrous.
   ``I never expected Dave Durenberger to step down,'' Schreiber
said. ``The Democratic spin doctors have been playing that
resignation game a long time.''
   U.S. Rep. Vin Weber, R-Minn., said, ``Today's statement and the
decision by the special counsel to seek no greater sanction than
denouncement now makes clear that Dave will weather this ordeal and
return to his work in the U.S. Senate.''

   Crews used skimmers, booms and chemicals
Thursday to battle a 30-mile-long slick from the burning
supertanker Mega Borg, and officials geared up to unleash
oil-eating bacteria.
   Officials planned to apply the bacteria Friday, the first use of
microbes in water to clean up an oil spill, state officials said.
   Also Thursday, the Mega Borg's chief engineer told a Norwegian
panel meeting in Galveston that one of the vessel's pumps had been
leaking about six hours before the blast.
   Balinder Singh said the pump leaked as the tanker's crude oil
cargo was being transferred to a smaller ship. Singh said he had
stopped the leak by tightening a coupling about six hours before
the Friday blast.
   Six days after the first of a series of explosions in the area
of the engine room, a small fire continued to burn aboard the
crippled Norwegian vessel, in the Gulf of Mexico 57 miles offshore.
   ``It looks like the fire is being contained to a very small area
in the engine room,'' Coast Guard spokesman Gene Maestas said.
   Flames could be seen on the deck's rear section, and four
fireboats showered the Mega Borg with water cannon. The rear
section, shrouded in smoke, continued to be awash.
   Oil escaping from a hole in the vessel's 5.5 million-gallon
center tank apparently was spilling at a slower rate, although
Coast Guard officials had no specifics. No other leaks have been
found.
   The 886-foot Mega Borg, which carried 38 million gallons of
light African crude oil, already has lost about 3 million gallons
of oil since late Friday's explosion; most of it has burned off or
evaporated.
   About 12,000 gallons remained on the water Thursday, Coast Guard
Capt. Thomas Greene said.
   An oil slick stretched about 12 miles northwest of the ship,
with scattered patches extending another 18 miles. Its width
varied. The Coast Guard offered no specific figure Thursday. The
previous day, it said the width stretched to 10 miles in spots.
   A plane spread up to 2,000 gallons of dispersant on sections
near theship Thursday, and at least a dozen skimmers and several
booms sucked oil off the water's surface. Five booms were working
in the ship's vicinity.
   Salvage crews planned to begin transferring oil from the No. 4
cargo tank, where the leak occurred, to the No. 5 cargo tank, which
is empty, Greene said. The effort should stop the spill, cut off
the fuel feeding the fire, and help correct the listing of the ship.
   State officials said the experimental microbe process, called
bioremediation, would be used as a demonstration and would not be a
major part of the cleanup.
   Bioremediation has been used for years to clean up hazardous
waste sites, treat sewage and wastewater, extract oil from tight
geologic formations and clean some rocks on shore after the Exxon
Valdez accident in Alaska last year, said Texas Land Commissioner
Garry Mauro.
   But this will be the first time bioremediation has been used in
the water to clean up an oil spill, he said.
   The dispersant works by breaking up the oil, creating a light
sheen and tar balls _ a rather common sight on Texas beaches.
   ``Tar balls are ugly but they're not that environmentally
damaging,'' said B.J. ``Buck'' Wynne III, chairman of the Texas
Water Commission.
   Coast Guard officials said the slick was about 30 miles from
Galveston, but they declined to give any predictions about where
the oil might reach the shore, if it does.
   Sharon Christopherson of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration said some of the tar balls could hit the Texas
shoreline as early as Friday.
   Also Thursday, a pumpman testified that he was opening a valve
when the blast ripped through the pump and engine room area last
Friday.
   Putham Mahamood, whose left leg was injured in the blast, spoke
with inspectors by telephone from his hospital bed.
   About three minutes before the explosion, Chief Officer Tojo
Sagar told Mahamood to open a valve for a crude oil washing,
Mahamood said. He did not elaborate on the procedure.
   As he was trying to open the valve, the explosion occurred,
Mahamood said. Sagar, 27, of India, died in the explosion.
   Mosvold Rederi of Farsund, Norway, owners of the Mega Borg,
already have spent $2 million for firefighting, salvage and
pollution control efforts, said Robert L. Klawetter, attorney for
firm.
   Two of the 41 crew members died in the blast, two were missing
and presumed dead and 17 were injured, none seriously.
   Klawetter identified the other seaman killed in the blast as
Seaman Bernardo T. Cortez, 41, of the Philippines. The missing men,
who are presumed dead, were 4th Engineer Wilfredo S. Gulfan, 36, of
the Philippines and wiper Vincent M. Pastor, 37, of the Philippines.

<HEAD>Judge Says Override Rule Within Resolution Thrift Corp.'s Authority

<TEXT>
   A judge Thursday upheld a federal agency's
authority to override state branch-banking laws as it sells off
failed savings and loans, the first such decision in the nation.
   The decision by U.S. District Judge Santiago Campos regarding
the Resolution Trust Corp.'s authority could have far-reaching
effects. The agency controls 248 failed thrifts in 21 states where
branching laws for banks that could buy defunct savings and loans
are more restrictive than those for thrifts.
   Campos dismissed a challenge to the regulation by the
Independent Community Bankers of New Mexico and the state Financial
Institutions Division.
   The ruling means the sale of the defunct New Mexico Federal
Savings and Loan to the First National Bank of Albuquerque can
proceed, unless the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver blocks
the transaction on appeal. Officials for the bankers group and the
state agency did not say whether they would appeal.
   The override rule, which took effect June 1, would effectively
let First National operate branches in counties outside Bernalillo
County, even though inter-county branch banking is prohibited by
state law.
   ``The override is well within (the RTC's) authority,'' Campos
said after a half-day hearing.
   New Mexico law prohibits banks from operating branches outside
the bank's headquarters county. But savings and loans may establish
branches anywhere. New Mexico Federal has branches in Santa Fe,
Espanola and Taos.
   The Resolution Trust Corp. was set up under the savings-and-loan
bailout law to dispose of failed thrifts under federal
conservatorship.
   Campos' ruling is contrary to a judicial decision earlier this
year in a similar federal case in Colorado. Bankers and state
regulators also have challenged the override rule in Arkansas, said
Michael Tucci, senior counsel for the agency.
   John Bernstein, an attorney for the Resolution Trust Corp., told
Campos that the agency was set up to salvage assets and bring
private money into the bailout program while minimizing taxpayers'
losses.
   In the Colorado case, splitting the thrift's branches cut the
premium bidders paid for the thrift from $675,000 to $75,000, which
will cost the taxpayers, said Bernstein.
   The cost of the nationwide bailout was pegged at $50 billion
last year but the Bush administration now estimates the cost at $89
billion to $132 billion.
   ``The purpose of the override is simply to do what Congress has
told the RTC to do,'' said Bernstein. ``To allow the state to come
in and restrict these kinds of transactions totally defeats the
mandate and authority granted by Congress to the RTC.''
   Bernstein said the override rule was designed to head off the
chaos that would occur if the agency could not sell an entire
network. Dividing branches would mean dividing centralized data
processing and other common assets, which would be cumbersome and
would lower their value, he said.
   And if the pending sale falls through, another arrangement may
be less satisfactory for New Mexico Federal's 21,000
account-holders, he said.
   The bankers and the state argued that Congress never intended
for banks to violate state branching laws.
   ``If we lose today, we will have in New Mexico basically an
unsupervised dual banking system,'' argued state Assistant Attorney
General G.T.S. Khalsa, representing the state regulatory agency.
   Leonard Rubin, a Washington-based lawyer for the independent
bankers, said the override rule violates the federal McFadden Act,
which requires national banks to conform to state laws limiting
branching.
   Rubin said the law creating the RTC specifically excludes banks
from the section governing the purchase of a failed thrift's
branches.
   ``Congress knew how to override the federal law if it wanted
to,'' said Rubin.
   He told Campos the RTC prefers selling entire thrifts, including
branches, with one transaction because they can get rich banks and
thrifts to pay a premium for a network of financial institutions.
   ``They're selling, for a premium, a license to violate state
banking laws,'' said Rubin.

<TEXT>
   The Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday
endorsed a constitutional amendment to require a balanced federal
budget.
   The amendment was sent to the full Senate by a vote of 11-3.
   If approved by two-thirds of the Senate and the House, and then
by 38 states, the amendment would prohibit federal spending from
exceeding revenues except in time of war or if both chambers waive
the requirement by a 60 percent vote.
   It would also require that a majority of each chamber of
Congress, instead of just a majority of those present and voting,
approve any tax increase.
   The amendment would take effect in the second fiscal year after
ratification.
   Balanced-budget amendments have been approved before by the
committee. The provision most recently was subjected to a full
Senate vote in 1986 and failed by one vote. It passed the Senate in
1982 but died in the House.
   Thursday's action came as House, Senate and White House
negotiators continued their budget ``summit'' in the Capitol, aimed
at reducing the federal deficit. Democrats and Republicans have
been unable to agree on how to bring the fiscal gap below $100
billion, never mind zero.
   They met for less than two hours and participants said they
discussed a variety of budget process reforms without reaching any
agreements. The talks are scheduled to resume next Tuesday.
   Because Congress' normal budget process has been sidetracked
during the lengthy negotiations, the Senate approved a resolution
Thursday night to keep a legislative backlog from building.
   By voice vote, the Senate approved the technical equivalent of a
budget for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. But the document was
devoid of the policies and fiscal decisions a budget normally
embodies, those details to be filled in later if the summit
succeeds.
   The purpose of the vote, supported by the White House, was to
let the Congress begin work on its annual spending bills for
federal agencies.
   The House on May 1 approved a $1.2 trillion budget spelling out
federal spending priorities including a shift from military
spending to domestic programs. The Senate then stopped short
because of the bipartisan budget talks.
   The Senate resolution approved Thursday night simply sets a $503
billion total target, same as the current year, for domestic and
defense programs outside of ``entitlement'' programs like Social
Security and other spending not set annually.
   Both must agree on a single resolution for it to become binding
on the two chambers. It doesn't require the president's signature.
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., said Thursday that the
House did not intend to abandon its plan. House-Senate talks are
expected to begin next week, even as the budget summit continues.

<HEAD>Federal Government Moves Against Shale Processor</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LAFAYETTE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal government moved Thursday to
close down a hazardous waste recycling company that the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency claims is actually a disposal site.
   The complaint filed in U.S. District Court by the EPA and the
Department of Justice also sought more than $40 million in fines
from Marine Shale Processors.
   ``Sham recycling is deplorable,'' James M. Strock, the EPA's
assistant administrator for enforcement, said in a statement. ``We
will continue cracking down on companies that exploit what they
perceive to be loopholes.''
   Marine Shale President Jack Kent accused the EPA of plotting
with his competitors in a campaign to shut down the company.
   ``We are confident that the district court will see this suit
for what it is, an action motivated by private interests to stifle
new technology,'' Kent said.
   The company in 1985 started its 275-foot kiln, which employs a
high-temperature process to transform toxic wastes such as
petroleum byproducts into a pebble-like aggregate which is used as
fill for road beds.
   In 1988, Marine Shale handled toxic wastes from 2,500 companies
in 48 states and had revenues of $40 million.
   Environmentalists and residents who live near the kiln outside
Morgan City have long claimed it is dangerous. The company already
faces $5 million in federal and state fines for environmental
infractions.
   Earlier this month, the company asked the state to allow it to
operate a second kiln while seeking air-quality permits for it.
   The complaint says Marine Shale is in the disposal rather than
recycling business, and doesn't have the proper permits to dispose
of wastes.
   The government is seeking $25,000 a day in penalties, dating
back to the start of incineration in July 1985, alleging the
company violated the Clean Water Act and federal hazardous waste
management law.
   It also accuses the company of offering hazardous wastes for
transport to handlers without permits and discharging pollutants
into Bayou Boeuf, part of the Intracoastal Waterway, beside which
the plant is located.
   The EPA said samples collected around the plant in 1989 detected
creosote-contaminated soil containing phenols and chrysene, various
solvents such as toluene and benzene, and heavy metals such as
chromium and lead in the incinerator residue.
   The inspectors did not find any immediate danger to public
health, but regional EPA administrator Robert E. Layton Jr. said in
the agency's statement there was a potential for health effects.
   ``We will be relentless in pursuing companies that operate on
the edge,'' he said.
   Kent said the EPA's finding of no imminent danger proved his
point.
   ``Nothing we produce is harmful or toxic in any way,'' he said.
``They have attacked us on a technicality.''

   Word that a local hardware and farm

   According to a New York Times report Thursday, Joe T. Meador
transported the priceless pieces to Texas from Quedlinburg, an
ancient castle town in what is now East Germany.
   The Army investigated the theft but dropped the matter in 1949
when Quedlinburg became part of East Germany.
   The newspaper quoted an unidentified source as saying the
treasures are in the vault of the First National Bank of
Whitewright, reportedly as collateral for a loan.
   Bank officials declined to comment on the reports. Harrell
Stowers, bank executive vice president, said he could not confirm
whether the treasures are or ever have been in the vault.
   Meador died in 1980. His brother, Jack, and his sister-in-law,
Jean, declined to comment Thursday.
   The Times based its report on interviews with art experts,
lawyers and neighbors of Meador.
   The treasures include a small silver reliquary, inlaid with
enamels and precious stones, with side panels of carved ivory; a
liturgical ivory comb; a manuscript dated 1513; several rock
crystal flasks and gold and silver crucifixes. Some of the
treasures were gifts from kings and emperors who ruled German
states in the 9th and 10th centuries.
   Meador was an officer with the 87th Armored Field Artillery, the
unit that occupied Quedlinburg and guarded the mine shaft where the
treasures reportedly were kept. They disappeared a few days after
American troops took over the area in 1945, the Times said.
   Three years after Meador died, his brother-in-law, Dr. Don H.
Cook, of Mesquite, Texas, sought to have two medieval manuscripts
evaluated, John Carroll Collins, a Dallas estate appraiser, told
the newspaper.
   A former employee of Meador's, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said Meador reportedly showed his employees richly bound
gold and silver manuscripts.
   But three longtime Meador employees said Thursday they'd never
known their boss to show off any art works when they were around.
The three declined to give their names.
   Most of the people interviewed Thursday said they didn't know
Meador had even been in the Army or World War II.
   ``Joe was a quiet man. I think Joe, in my way of thinking, was a
very, very intelligent man ... he seemed to mind his own
business,'' Mayor Clarence Tillett said.
   Tillett said he'd visited Meador in the house he shared with his
mother but didn't recall any unusual works of art.
   ``It wouldn't have surprised me for anything to come out of
Germany,'' Tillett said.
   Many residents recalled Meador as a loner whose most memorable
trait was his passion for growing orchids.
   ``He didn't seem like the type of guy to me who would do
something like that,'' said Troyce Spencer, a resident.

<HEAD>Democrats Abandon Second Attempt to Override</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Senate Democrats have abandoned the idea of
trying for a second time to override President Bush's veto of the
$2 billion Amtrak bill, their leaders announced Thursday night.
   The House last week voted overwhelmingly to override but on
Tuesday the Senate failed by a vote of 64-36 to garner the
two-thirds majority needed to pass the bill over the president's
objections.
   The vote would have been 65-35, except Majority Leader George
Mitchell, D-Maine, voted on the president's side so that he could,
under Senate rules, ask for a reconsideration of the vote. Only
members of the winning side may ask for a second look, and Mitchell
promptly did so.
   But apparently the Democrats could not find the two additional
votes they needed.
   Sen. J. James Exon, D-Nebr., chairman of the Commerce
Committee's subcommittee on surface transportation, said Thursday
night that the Democrats would move a new bill deleting the
provision which drew the veto, an expansion of Interstate Commerce
Commission power to regulate railroad takeovers.
   Bush has vetoed 11 bills with no overrides.

<TEXT>
   The Philippines on Wednesday refused
to allow 154 Vietnamese refugees to disembark from a U.S. navy ship
at the U.S.-run Subic naval base, officials said.
   That brought to 255 the number of Vietnamese refugees stranded
at Subic aboard American vessels. The Philippines will not allow
the Vietnamese ashore until Washington guarantees their
resettlement in the United States.
   The U.S. has refused to make such guarantees.
   Robert Coble, a spokesman at the Subic facility, said the latest
group of Vietnamese arrived aboard the helicopter landing ship USS
Peleliu on Wednesday. The ship rescued the refugees last weekend in
the South China Sea.
   U.S. Embassy spokeswoman Victoria Middleton said officials from
the United States and the United Nations High Commissioner on
Refugees were meeting with Philippine foreign affairs department
authorities but have not resolved the impasse.
   Philippine refugee officials have said their refusal was to
``show the displeasure on the continued defiance of the U.S. and
Vietnam on the proposed repatriation policy of first asylum
countries.''
   Southeast Asian countries, where most of the refugees land
first, want to send back people who flee for economic reasons and
only accept those who have escaped political persecution.
   The United States opposes forced repatiration. But Southeast
Asian nations say the United States also refuses to take in many of
the boat people.
   On Friday, Manila Archbishop Cardinal Jaime Sin requested the
department of foreign affairs to accept the refugees on
humanitarian grounds.
   But Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus repeated the government
position that the United States must first guarantee their
resettlement, officials said.

<TEXT>
   Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corp. has agreed
to pay $700,000 to settle a lawsuit involving water pollution from
one of its plants along the Ohio River, a citizens group announced
Wednesday.
   The fine covers 1,713 violations of the federal Clean Water Act
since 1985 at Wheeling-Pitt's steel galvanizing plant in Martins
Ferry, said John Rumpler, president of the Ohio Public Interest
Research Group, which sued the company.
   ``We hope this settlement sends the message to polluters that
it's cheaper to comply than defy,'' Rumpler told a news conference.
   The settlement will be submitted to a federal bankruptcy court
for approval, said Wheeling-Pittsburgh spokeswoman Charlotte
Palmer. The Wheeling, W.Va.-based company is reorganizing under
Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy laws.
   ``It will benefit Martins Ferry, the government and the
environment,'' Ms. Palmer said of the agreement. She said the
company would not comment further.
   The company has dumped dangerous metals, toxins and other wastes
into the Ohio River for 18 years, said Anna Aurilio, the staff
scientist for the citizens group. Martins Ferry is nearly 70 miles
south of Youngstown.
   She said the company's records show that it exceeded legal
limits for emissions of zinc, solids, hexavalent chromium and other
pollutants. She said zinc is dangerous to fish and wildlife, and
hexavalent chromium is dangerous to people and aquatic life.
   The privately funded group sued the company in U.S. District
Court in Columbus in 1988, seeking the maximum $25,000 fine for
each offense. A consent decree is to be filed in federal court
Thursday, said Steve Samuels, the group's lawyer.
   Under the settlement, the company will pay $230,000 to the Ohio
Department of Natural Resources to reduce acid mine drainage into
the river, $200,000 to the non-profit Virginia Environmental
Endowment for projects in the Martins Ferry area, $170,000 to the
non-profit Nature Conservancy to buy and preserve wetlands on the
river, and $100,000 to the U.S. Treasury.
   Wheeling-Pitt also will put pollution control devices on its
Martins Ferry plant and submit monthly reports on its efforts to
reduce emissions.

   A woman who said she killed her husband
by shooting him five times before her gun jammed was given
probation by a judge who said he didn't send her to prison because
she was a battered wife.
   ``I am sending no message to any group, but I cannot in good
conscience send her to jail,'' Superior Court Judge Edgar P. Taylor
said Tuesday in sentencing Terry Shapiro.
   Mrs. Shapiro was given five years probation after she pleaded no
contest to involuntary manslaughter in a plea bargain.
   The judge also ordered her to perform 200 hours of community
service and to continue undergoing counseling she began after Abe
Shapiro's death.
   Mrs. Shapiro told a probation officer that she couldn't see any
other way out of her situation.
   Mrs. Shapiro, 26, was extensively bruised and covered with blood
when she called authorities to the couple's home Feb. 11 to report
the shooting, according to police. The couple had a 2-year-old
child and an infant.
   While the couple lived in Chicago in 1988, Abe Shapiro was
arrested for beating his wife with a belt, leaving buckle-shaped
welts on her back. He was given a suspended sentence.
   Her attorney, John Sullivan, said his client left her husband,
but Shapiro hired a private detective to find her, then threatened
to harm her unless she returned.

<HEAD>Poland to Introduce Tax Reforms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   No self-respecting capitalist economy can
be without it: tax reform.
   Finance ministry officials on Wednesday unveiled proposals for
Poland's first universal income tax and a ``value added'' tax on
manufactured goods.
   The new system could go into effect by 1991, but a lengthy
parliament debate is expected.
   Polish tax laws imposed levys on government industries but not
the people who worked in socialized industries.
   People with private incomes were required to pay taxes, but
there were many legal exemptions.
   Restructuring the tax system is a ``major component'' of the
economic reform plan, Deputy Finance Minister Marek Dabrowski said.
   A new tax enforcement force will be created to make sure the
levies are collected, he said at a news conference.
   The new system will have other elements familiar to the Western
tax debate: it is to be simple, uniform and stripped of breaks for
special interests.
   The highest income tax rate will be 40 percent, Dabrowski said.
   According to examples presented by the Gazeta Wyborcza daily,
people earning the equivalent of $32 a month will be taxed 84 cents
while people earning $1,053 will be taxed $315.
   About 20 million of Poland's 39 million people will pay taxes,
the newspaper said.

<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   About 30,000 people held an
anti-Communist rally Wednesday in Belgrade in an unprecedented show
of support for opposition demands that free elections be held in
Yugoslavia's one-party state of Serbia.
   Demonstrators bore banners reading ``Down with Communism,''
``Free Elections Now!'' and ``We Want the King'' as they assembled
in Republic Square.
   In the first such public expression of royalist sentiment in
decades, demonstrators chanted ``We want our king back!'' and
carried portraits of past Serbian monarchs. The monarchy was
abolished and the royal family exiled when the Communists siezed
power in 1945.
   Riot police ringed the square but did not intervene during the
main rally.
   Several hours after the rally ended peacefully, however, police
with clubs dispersed about 500 protesters who tried to approach
nearby Belgrade Television station to demand unbiased coverage of
opposition demands, witnesses said.
   No immediate reports emerged of arrests or injuries during the
brief melee.
   The rally was organized by a coalition of five newly established
independent parties.
   ``We demand a chance to freely decide about our future _ just
like all other East European countries,'' Kosta Cavoski, a leader
of Serbia's Democratic Party, told the crowd.
   ``Communists are now trembling because they know their days in
power are numbered.''
   Yugoslavia's first free elections in 45 years were held in April
in the liberal northern republics of Slovenia and Croatia where
center-right parties won a majority in regional legislatures,
ending Communist one-party rule there. Multiparty elections are
scheduled in the republics of Bosnia, Macedonia and Montenegro, and
federal authorities say elections will be held next fall for the
national parliament.
   Communists in Serbia, Yugoslavia's largest republic, have so far
rejected Western-style elections. Serbia's hard-line president,
Slobodan Milosevic, and other Communist leaders accuse the
opposition coalition of ``betraying Serbia'' with its demand for
immediate free elections.

<TEXT>
   The Coast Guard plucked a retired
Arkansas congressman and his wife to safety from their disabled
sailboat in stormy seas, a grateful Ed Bethune said Wednesday.
   As night fell Tuesday, a rescuer dived from a helicopter into
the Atlantic Ocean and swam through 25-foot waves to help Bethune,
54, and his wife, Lana, whose sailboat hit a gale about 210 miles
south of Cape Cod.
   ``If somebody would have said 60 days ago, `Let's figure out the
toughest scenario, and put two people in their early 50s out there
and rescue them,' well, this was it,'' former U.S. Rep. Bethune
said in a telephone interview. He added that winds had been at 40
knots, gusting to 50 knots and seas were heavy.
   The Bethunes, who suffered only from exhaustion, were taken to a
Coast Guard Air Station, officials said.
   The Coast Guard said the Bethunes' boat had lost engine power,
and they were unable to hoist sails because of high winds.
   After drifting for 1{ days in their 30-foot sailboat Salute, the
couple, exhausted and fearing the craft would capsize, called for
help at 3 p.m. Tuesday, the Coast Guard said.
   Bethune said he waited to call because ``we have a good
blue-water boat and felt perhaps the weather might improve. It's
not uncommon to hit a storm when crossing the ocean. So we decided
to see if we could ride it out.
   ``But it became apparent that we needed to call the Coast
Guard.''
   When the helicopter arrived, the boat's rigging was swinging so
violently the couple couldn't be lifted directly from the craft,
the Coast Guard said.
   They were told to abandon the boat and get into a life raft.
   Petty Officer Roderic Parker dove from the chopper into the
ocean and helped Mrs. Bethune into a rescue basket to be hoisted up.
   But Parker then found that the life raft, with Bethune, had been
blown about 75 yards away, and he had to swim through 25-foot waves
to reach it, the Coast Guard said.
   The basket was lowered twice more and the men were hoisted
aboard.
   Bethune said the Coast Guard had told him they'd practiced the
very same maneuver two weeks ago.
   ``Because of that this went off without a hitch,'' he said.
``And this young man helping us was making his first rescue
attempt.''
   The next time Bethune sees U.S. Rep. Gerry Studds, D-Mass., who
deals with Coast Guard matters, he said, ``I'm going to tell him my
story and offer to testify about just how good these people are.''

   The former owner of the collapsed Vernon Savings &amp;
Loan has been indicted on federal charges he spent thousands of
dollars in thrift money on pleasure trips, prostitutes and illegal
contributions to politicians.
   Donald Dixon, 50, was charged Wednesday with conspiracy,
misapplication of funds, making false statements and other offenses.
   The indictment alleges the political contributions were made
``for the purpose of currying favor and influence'' in anticipation
of regulatory action by the Texas Savings and Loan Department and
the Federal Home Loan Bank Board.
   Prosecutors said the politicians didn't know the contributions
were illegal, and none was charged. Nor were any thrift regulators.

   Two huge spending bills to help cities and

committee now that the House has approved its $4 billion version.
   The House bill was approved 408-14 on Wednesday, sending it to a

spend $1 billion less over five years.
   The overwhelming House vote came in the face of opposition by
the Office of Management and Budget, which argued that the bill was
too costly and should not have been focused on a single disease.
   ``The bill's narrow disease-specific approach sets a dangerous
precedent, inviting treatment of other diseases through similar ad

   When the saints come marching in, Southern
Baptist evangelists hope a few Bourbon Street regulars will be
among them.
   The blue-suited evangelists who have been attending a convention
by day descended into the notorious French Quarter at night
Wednesday to distribute Bibles and religious tracts outside such
places as Le Booze Bar and The Orgy.
   ``I was here eight years ago, and Bourbon Street was still
Bourbon Street. Not one thing has changed,'' said Glen Harlin of
Odessa, Texas. ``Our witnessing may not have an effect on the
atmosphere of this part of the city _ this street _ but it will
affect the individuals we reached.''
   The more than 40,000 Southern Baptists in the city for their
annual meeting this week have proved to be a mixed blessing. Bar
owners, for example, were singing the blues.
   ``I think they ought to go back to where they belong,'' said
C.W. Williams, as he stood idle in one of the doorway bars along
Bourbon Street. ``It's the worst week I've had since December.''

   Hubert Rulitschka knows
exactly what he's going to do when he swaps his East German money
for West German marks next month.
   ``It's going right into the bank. I can't afford to go crazy
with money. After all, I might lose my job after July 2,'' said
Rulitschka, who sells baked goods on this border town's tiny market
square.
   East Germany is less than three weeks from its official plunge
into capitalist waters, and there's much concern about how high and
dangerous the resulting waves will be.
   West Germany's powerful mark will become East Germany's legal
tender and the two nations will merge as a single economic entity.
   East Germans will be able to exchange up to 4,000 East marks at
a 1-to-1 rate and the remainder at 2-to-1 under the economic merger
agreement. Exchanging the first 4,000 marks will give an East
German the equivalent of nearly $2,400.

   Tens of thousands of miners accosted
people at random and ransacked opposition party offices Thursday
after being summoned by the president-elect to help put down
anti-government protests.
   Few police and soldiers were visible in the capital by late
Thursday, and the miners, armed with cudgels and their faces and
work clothes still smudged with coal dust, were apparently left to
maintain order as they chose.
   The miners arrived after two days of violence in which security
forces clashed with demonstrators who claim the governing National
Salvation Front is dominated by Communists associated with the
ousted Ceausescu regime.
   The government said at least five people were killed and 350
injured when police cleared a 2-month-old demonstration from a
central square Wednesday, then fired on protesters who attacked
government buildings later in the day.

   Police seeking to curb drunken driving do not
violate motorists' privacy rights by stopping them at sobriety
checkpoints, the Supreme Court ruled Thursday.
   The 6-3 decision upheld Michigan's checkpoint program and, by
extension, similar operations in most states.
   ``The balance of the state's interest in preventing drunken
driving ... and the degree of intrusion upon individual motorists
who are briefly stopped weighs in favor of the state program,''
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist wrote for the court.
   The three dissenters said the decision sacrificed individual
liberty in favor of a police tactic that might not make any
difference in the fight against drunken driving.

   The impact of the Islamic fundamentalist
election victory in Algeria spread across North Africa on Thursday,
worrying moderates and cheering fellow religious hard-liners whose
movements are suppressed.
   The Algerian government, seemingly stunned by the results of the
country's first free elections, withheld official comment and
postponed until next week the announcement of full results from
Tuesday's balloting.
   In France, once Algeria's colonial ruler and now home to
hundreds of thousands of Algerians, apprehensive politicians warned
of a new wave of immigrants fleeing the growing power of the
fundamentalists.
   With the count complete in one-third of all electoral districts
_ including most major cities _ the victory of Sheikh Abassi
Madani's Islamic Salvation Front seemed decisive.

   The Bush administration, worried about a lack
of progress in trade talks with Japan, insisted Thursday that the
Japanese honor commitments to open markets to American and other
foreign goods.
   U.S. negotiators have grown concerned over what they perceive as
Japanese foot-dragging in the talks, aimed at reducing the United
States' $49 billion trade deficit with Japan.
   Critics have said Japan's intransigence is directly linked to a
decision by the Bush administration to remove Japan from under a
tough section of trade law known as Super 301, which carries the
threat of economic sanctions.
   Recent negotiations in Hawaii produced little progress toward
the text of a final report on negotiations aimed at reforming the
economies of both countries as a way of attacking the underlying
reasons for the huge trade imbalance.

   When female guppies get the urge to raise a
family, they go for the fancy guys with the big, bold colors. If
you're a male guppy, researchers find, it pays to be orange.
   But guppy life isn't simple, it seems. Predators like the bright
orange guys, too.
   Female guppies, Princeton University researcher Anne E. Houde
said Thursday, ``do indeed seem to prefer males that have overall
brighter colors ... such as how much orange they have in their
patterns.''
   Houde and John A. Endler of the University of California, Santa
Barbara, researched the color preferences of guppy love by taking
fish from six different locations in Trinidad, a tropical island
where the vividness of guppy colors varies from stream to stream.
   They found that when a female guppy showed a preference in her
mate selection, she went for the guys with those dazzling orange
colors.

   Crews used skimmers, booms and chemicals
Thursday to battle a 30-mile-long slick from the burning
supertanker Mega Borg, and officials geared up to unleash
oil-eating bacteria.
   It would be the first use of microbes in water to clean up an
oil spill, state officials said.
   Six days after the first of a series of explosions in the area
of the engine room, a small fire continued to burn aboard the
crippled Norwegian vessel, in the Gulf of Mexico 57 miles offshore.
   ``It looks like the fire is being contained to a very small area
in the engine room,'' Coast Guard spokesman Gene Maestas said.
   Flames could be seen on the deck's rear section, and four
fireboats showered the Mega Borg with water cannon. The rear
section, shrouded in smoke, continued to be awash.
   Oil escaping from a hole in the vessel's 5.5 million-gallon
center tank apparently was spilling at a slower rate, although
Coast Guard officials had no specifics. No other leaks have been
found.
   The 886-foot Mega Borg, which carried 38 million gallons of
light African crude oil, already has lost about 3 million gallons
of oil since late Friday's explosion; most of it has burned off or
evaporated.

   President Bush marked Flag Day with a dawn
visit to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Thursday while a Medal of
Honor-winning senator said he was ashamed of Bush's recent actions
concerning a constitutional amendment on flag burning.
   ``Today, in quiet glory, the Stars and Stripes continue to
proclaim the shining promise of America,'' Bush said in a statement
released after he visited the memorial. He proclaimed it Flag Week.
   Bush did not mention the proposed constitutional amendment,
which passed its first hurdle in the House on Wednesday, two days
after the Supreme Court threw out last year's flag protection law.
To become part of the Constitution, the amendment will need
two-thirds support in both the House and the Senate and
ratification by 38 state legislatures.
   Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., who won the Medal of Honor in Vietnam,
called the push for a flag amendment ``an attempt to divide
America, to divide fathers against sons.'' He said it would reopen
``the generation gap'' of the Vietnam era.
   ``He has chosen to divide his country on an issue that, frankly,
in my opinion, should not be given this much attention,'' Kerrey
later told a rally of congressional veterans against the amendment.

   Forty years after it divided the European
continent, the Iron Curtain has parted for the Peace Corps, the
idealistic creation of President Kennedy.
   One of the first 122 U.S. volunteers leaving this weekend for
Eastern Europe, 66-year-old Felix Lapinski, has a highly personal
motive for traveling to Poland to teach English.
   ``I learned Polish at my mother's knee,'' he said in an
interview Thursday. ``I had always heard the stories of the old
country. Now I have a chance to teach Poles English, which is
really the access language of the modern world.''
   Lapinski, who has been teaching English to foreign students at
night for nine years, was one of those selected from thousands of
volunteers.
   At the invitation of the new Polish and Hungarian governments,
the Peace Corps aims at creating a network of trained teachers to
spread the use of English, which Peace Corps Director Paul D.
Coverdell said has become the essential ``language of commerce,
science, mathematics and computer technology,'' as Eastern Europe
turns its face to the West.

   Since federal regulators forced Dixon from the controls of
Vernon Savings and Loan Association in 1986, seven of the thrift's

charges.
   On Thursday, Dixon himself surrendered to the FBI on 38 counts

face 190 years in prison and a $9.5 million fine if convicted of
all counts.
   Also Thursday, former Vernon Chairman Woody F. Lemons

the longest ever ordered for an executive convicted in
investigations stemming from the nation's S&amp;L problems.

   Barre Toelken will tell you a Navajo coyote
story in January, but no amount of prodding will get it out of him
in June.
   ``They have to be told in the winter or you will screw up the
weather pattern,'' he says.
   The traditional tribal moratorium on coyote yarns begins with
the first lightning strike in the spring. Then mum's the word until
the first killing frost of autumn.
   Toelken, 55, has spent years collecting and studying the
folklore of the Southwest _ tales, folk songs and ballads that echo
ever fainter down the decades. To many modern minds, his obsession
is, well, puzzling.
   ``There is still a notion that folklore is baloney. I don't know
any other field that has to explain itself any more than we do,''
Toelken says. ``If someone says they are a doctor or a plumber,
people say that's fine. But when I say I'm a folklorist, people
say, `That must be wonderful for your children, but what do you do
for a living?'''
   Toelken ``does'' folklore as a professor at Utah State
University. Although his doctoral degree is in medieval literature,
he became enthralled with American Indian culture in 1954 when he
and a group of friends left college to mine uranium on the Navajo
reservation in southeastern Utah.
   ``We started out driving down there on weekends and got more
interested in living among the Indians than going to school,'' he
says.
   After uranium mining played out, Toelken was invited to stay on
the reservation at Montezuma Creek with a Navajo family by the name
of Yellowman. It was during that first winter that he learned about
coyote stories, which are not all humorous but always carry a moral.
   ``Instead of lecturing people, the Navajos tell stories about a
coyote,'' he says.
   At first, he was simply entertained by the tales. But as his
studies in folklore progressed, he returned to the reservation and
made several tapes of the stories after agreeing never to repeat
them during the summer.
   Storytelling is an integral part of the study of folklore. For
Toelken and others, it reveals elements of society not recorded
anywhere else.
   ``Folklore is about the live part of the culture rather than the
dry part you get through the books,'' he says. ``The values and
ideas important to a group of people are often too abstract to talk
about, and when they are told in stories they are more vivid in
their explanation.''
   Toelken says Navajos aren't the only people who use stories to
explain themselves. Mormons, for example, tell stories about three
Nephite men from the Book of Mormon who have been allowed to roam
the Earth for ages, never dying.
   In the stories, he says, the three sometimes perform heroic acts
such as saving a child's life when no other adult is around. In
some versions, they appear as people in need. When the faithful
help them, they are blessed.
   Folklorists, Toelken says, are not in the business to determine
the truth of the stories they study, but focus on the purpose they
serve for the people who tell them.
   ``Studying the unwritten vernacular of a society reveals
important and mostly unrecorded facts about it,'' he says.
   While the Nephite tales may promote faith among Mormons, coyote
tales are sometimes used to explain nature. One tells that the
animal's eyes are yellow because a coyote once threw his eyes high
in the air so he could see long distances.
   ``Of course, it didn't do any good,'' Toelken says. ``And then
he had to use (yellow) pine pitch to make them stick again.''
   The stories often carry a health message. ``From the Navajo
point of view, the religion is based on health and anything out of
balance creates sickness,'' he says.
   But collecting coyote stories is not without hazard. Last fall
Toelken was asked to be a patient in a ``blessingway'' ceremony on
the reservation aimed at promoting harmony in a person's life and
warding off ``skinwalkers,'' or witches.
   ``Witches take language apart and analyze it. My scholarship of
Navajo coyote stories was making people nervous,'' he said.
   After Yellowman died while being treated for Navajo witchcraft,
Toelken agreed to participate in four such ceremonies to ease the
minds of other family members. He will go through another later
this year.
   For Toelken, a big part of his study of folklore is the Fife
Folklore Conference each June at Utah State. This year the
conference focused on storytelling, but again served to boost the
legitimacy of the odd discipline.

   Ah, yes, MTV. Rock videos. Quick-cut, posturing,
mini-musicals for those who love synthesizers, rock stars who mouth
the words of their hits, and the robo-rhythms of electronic drum
machines.
   But there is weirdness afoot. Check out MTV Sunday night. It
might startle you to see a show with flash-rock king Elton John,
just himself and his piano, surrounded by about 100 fans in a small
New York studio.
   It's part of a relatively new weekly MTV series, ``Unplugged,''
wherein major and minor stars of rock do their thing in an intimate
setting, not the usual 50,000-seat stadium full of fugitives from
homes for the strange.
   The show is odd in other ways. The musicians generally play what
younger tads, raised on microchip rock, call ``acoustic.'' Like
real guitars, real drums and, in one Don Henley show, even real
violins and cellos.
   The video is no frills, four cameras taping a complete
performance.
   And the singers actually sing, which is slyly noted in Sunday's
one-hour show as John welcomes viewers to ``the program that
lip-synchers dare not come on.'' The audience cheers.
   ``Ooh, nasty, nasty,'' he says, mock-chiding himself. ``Right _
since that cuts out about 75 percent of the Top 100, it's only the
old ones like me that can do it.''
   Then, clad in a pink baseball cap and pink and black jogging
togs, he briskly proceeds to do seven classics, among them a
boogie-woogie version of one of his most golden oldies, ``Bennie
and the Jets.''
   His gospel-tinged piano accompaniment at times is monotonous. So
is the close-up, long-shot, medium-shot camerawork. But it is a
welcome change from the high-gloss, overproduced rock videos that
have become New Wave old hat.
   Billed as MTV's ``First Acoustic Music Series,'' ``Unplugged''
began in January. The first show featured the British rockers,
Squeeze.
   Thirteen more shows since have been taped and aired, starring
such artists as Sinead O'Connor and 10,000 Maniacs (the group, not
the audience). New ones featuring Aerosmith and Eric Clapton are
planned.
   The series has gotten a good reaction from all ages of MTV fans,
according to MTV senior vice president Judy McGrath.
   But it wasn't started, she says, as a reaction to what some rock
analysts see as an increasing turn by the public away from
lip-synching rock stars and techno-rock in which the synthesizer is
the star.
   ``No, it really isn't a reaction against anything,'' she says.
Rather, it was part of MTV's goal of doing ``original, unexpected
things,'' she says. ``We wanted to say there's another way to do
music.''
   ``Unplugged'' might seem new to many MTV viewers for whom
``thirtysomething'' is a show about old folks.
   But it's more a back-to-the-future effort resembling public TV's
``Soundstage'' of the '70s. That was an acclaimed music series that
also put pop stars of the day, Barry Manilow among them, in a
quiet, no-frills studio setting.
   ``When I look at `Unplugged,' I get a sense of deja vu,'' says
Ken Ehrlich, who was executive producer of ``Soundstage'' and now
produces other music shows, including cable's ``Showtime ... Coast
to Coast'' specials.
   ``I think that perhaps the most telling thing is that kids ...
are going to be able to see once again what the music is and what
the performers are like, instead of having to follow 400 cuts in a
video,'' he says.
   MTV's McGrath says ``Unplugged'' is aimed at a broad audience,
not just the fast-growing, aging baby boom collection of citizens
aged 35 to 44.
   Ehrlich agrees, saying he doesn't think baby boomers even watch
MTV.
   ``I think what's happening,'' he says, ``is that there are
probably a lot of kids watching `Unplugged' and saying, `Gee, we've
discovered a new way of looking at music.' ''

   ABC's Peter Jennings appeared last Wednesday on NBC's

NBC's ``Later With Bob Costas.'' Deborah Norville of NBC's
``Today,'' who has visited ``Late Night With David Letterman,'' is

<HEAD>Christian Democrats Seek Leading Role in Eastern Europe</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DANISZEWSKI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A political movement associated with the
churchgoing, conservative middle class is trying to fill the vacuum
left by the collapse of Communist parties in Eastern Europe.
   Leaders of the movement say center-right Christian Democratic
parties like those in Western Europe and Scandinavia could become
the dominant political force in the former Soviet bloc.
   Wladyslaw Sila-Nowicki, chairman of Poland's Christian
Democratic Party of Labor, said Christian Democracy should be ``one
of the basic centers of building pluralism and normality in
political life after decades of one-party Communist Party rule.''
   Christian Democratic parties were born after World War I,
particularly among Roman Catholics in Western Europe. They urged
Christians to participate in politics based on social teachings of
the religion.
   The doctrine advocates cooperation between employers and
employees, rejecting both Marxism and unfettered capitalism.
   It differs with the Social Democratic tradition, which dates
from the 1870s and is closely tied to trade union movements, mainly
in its attitude toward state intervention in the economy. Social
Democrats are more inclined to advocate state ownership of major
industries.
   East Germany's Christian Democrats were the big winners in
parliamentary elections in March.
   Democratic Forum, the winner in Hungary that same month, is more
of a mix, but emphasized ``Christian values'' in its campaign. It
formed a governing coalition with two sympathetic parties, one
called the Christian Democrats.
   In Czechoslovakia, Christian Democrats did not achieve their
goal of finishing second to Civic Forum in this month's election,
but did place third after the Communists.
   In Polish politics, Solidarity towers above all groups. Its
support ranges from morally conservative, market-oriented Catholics
to liberal intellectuals and populist-minded workers whose ideal is
something on the lines of socialist Sweden.
   Political aides of Solidarity leader Lech Walesa have tried
recently to draw center-right elements together in a political
union called the Center Alliance, with strong Christian Democratic
overtones.
   Sila-Nowicki's party, formed before World War II, has received
quiet encouragement from the Catholic Church.
   Romania and Bulgaria have budding Christian Democratic parties
and one has been formed in Moscow.
   Antongiulio De Robertis, an official of the Christian Democrat
International in Rome, said it had established links with Christian
Democrats throughout Eastern Europe.
   ``Prior to last year, we had ties with skeleton committees of
pre-Communist political groupings that had been kept alive by
emigre communities,'' he said. ``With the liberation of Eastern
Europe, these parties returned to their respective countries and
continued to work.''
   A reaction to communism accounts for part of the support, said
Carl Ordnung, a Christian Democratic activist working for Lothar de
Maiziere, the new prime minister of East Germany.
   ``It's because these parties are Christian parties,'' he said.
``Christianity to a certain extent is quite the opposite of Marxism
and communism. After this whole progressive attitude of Communists,
people say, `Now let us stick to a more conservative program'.''
   In East Germany, the Christian Democrats confounded pollsters by
overtaking the Social Democrats in the last days of the campaign.
They benefited from ties to the Christian Democratic Union of West
Germany and its leader, Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who advocated
speedy German reunification.
   Bruno Orsini, head of the international department of the
Christian Democrat International in Rome, sees a parallel between
Eastern Europe now and Western Europe in the late 1940s.
   ``In the period immediately after World War II, the two
countries which had been ruled by dictatorships chose the Christian
Democratic path to achieve their reconstruction,'' he said.
   ``Both Germans and Italians overcame the bitterness of the Nazi
period through their adoption of what was a Christian Democratic
value: the belief in unity.
   ``Now it is the same for Eastern Europe. The hopes of East
Europeans who have escaped oppression after years of authoritarian
rule and underdevelopment are based on liberty and solidarity.''
   ``Both these values are central'' to Christian Democracy, Orsini
said.
   Advocates say it appeals to people who suffered under extremist
regimes.
   ``We are a centrist party,'' Sila-Nowicki said. ``We are
decidedly opponents of mono-parties, regardless of whether they are
leftist like the Communist Party or rightist like the totalitarian
parties of fascist Italy and Nazi Germany.''
   Sandor Keresztes, chairman of the Hungarian Christian Democrats,
sees the movement as a counter to divisive nationalism in Eastern
Europe.
   ``With so many ethnic Hungarians in neighboring countries, this
is especially vital'' to his party, Keresztes said.
   Christian Democratic parties deny they are controlled by any
church, but tend to be linked to Roman Catholicism and follow
Vatican teachings on such issues as abortion and pornography.
   Pope John Paul II, a native of Poland, went to Czechoslovakia in
April and plans to visit Hungary and Poland next year. He has
expressed hope that new public policies in Eastern Europe will
reject both communism and excessive Western consumerism.

<HEAD>Hermit Culture Dying in Mountain Retreat</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN POMFRET</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DHARMSALA, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Atop a steep slope overlooking this
mountainous retreat is the hut of a Buddhist hermit, festooned with
flags of prayer.
   Spring breezes puff through the evergreens. The flags flap. As
they do, says Tibetan lore, prayers inscribed on the sun-bleached
cloth are released.
   Outside, it's peaceful, but inside the hut agitation reigns.
   Jampa Tenzin, the hermit, fiddles with the cap on a can of
``Springtime'' air freshener. He says the number of Buddhist
recluses is dwindling and their culture, once held in awe by
Tibetans, is dying.
   ``This is an age of degeneration,'' he declares, passing a
visitor a cup of Tang orange drink. ``We have no right to compare
ourselves to the saints of the past.
   ``Today's mind is always thinking. We have no time to really do
anything, always skipping from this and that.''
   This day, Tenzin also is pressed for time. He's about to set out
on the hourlong journey to the town below to ready a water pump for
his hermitage.
   A water pump?
   What's that got to do with nirvana, and what's Tenzin doing with
Tang and ``Springtime'' air freshener?
   ``Times have changed,'' he says.
   Their predecessors abandoned the material world for lonely crags
and caves in their homeland, but today's Tibetan hermits are slowly
embracing creature comforts.
   From thousands in Tibet, the Buddhist hermits have dwindled to a
mere 50 around Dharmsala, headquarters of the Dalai Lama's exile
government.
   Some hermits remain in Tibet, although their numbers dropped
precipitously during China's Cultural Revolution in 1966-1976, when
bands of Red Guards routinely killed Tibetan monks.
   Most hermits fled Tibet with the Dalai Lama, their spiritual
leader, after an abortive uprising in 1959.
   At that time, many ended their isolation. For those who have
remained in the woods, the pursuit of enlightenment is more
difficult.
   ``Modernity touches us and it's very hard to resist,'' Tenzin
said. ``Comfort makes us lose discipline. We become soft.''
   Few, if any, of Dharmsala's hermits are capable of following the
rigorous lifestyle of earlier hermits, he said.
   The fabled 11th century hermit Milarepa spent decades meditating
in snowbound caves. Legends say a diet of nettles turned him green.
   Today's hermits meditate for barely half the day, Tenzin said.
   Most also appear well-fed. Tenzin is quite rotund. His happy
round face has a double chin.
   His hut is filled with books, a sturdy kerosene stove, electric
lamps, jars of dried fruit and packets of chocolate-drink mix.
   Tenzin, 54, became a hermit 20 years ago. He entered the Tibetan
Buddhist clergy when he was 7 and studied scriptures for the next
14 years in a monastery near his upper-class family's home in
southern Tibet.
   He fled Tibet with the Dalai Lama and, after several more years
of study, decided to abandon the material world to seek
enlightenment.
   Enlightenment, or Buddhahood, is described as a state of
``no-mind'' where the vagaries of everyday existance do not affect
the core of a person's being.
   About 50 other monks joined him in hills above Dharmsala,
supported by monthly stipends of about $10 from the Dalai Lama's
office and donations from Tibetans and Westerners.
   Tenzin succeeded in mastering an advanced form of meditation in
which the body temperature is raised. In 1981, Herbert Benson, a
Harvard University medical professor, studied him and several other
hermits.
   Benson recorded a rise of between 7 and 15 degrees Fahrenheit in
the skin temperature, particularly on the fingers and toes.
   Since the early 1980s, Tenzin said, his abilities have
deteriorated.
   ``The pursuit of nirvana is more difficult when all these things
line the way,'' he said.

   A threatened scientific boycott over U.S.
travel restrictions on foreigners infected with the AIDS virus has
failed, but the policy will remain a major issue at this week's
international AIDS meeting.
   The French and Swiss governments, the European Parliament and
other groups had urged scientists to boycott because of U.S.
immigration policy.
   But officials say registration for the Sixth International
Conference on AIDS, which opens Wednesday, will come close to the
original estimate of 12,000.
   Among those registered are Luc Montagnier and other members of
France's Pasteur Institute, one of the world's leading AIDS
research centers.
   Only 50 research papers were withdrawn from the 2,500 studies
originally submitted, conference spokesman Dana Van Gorder said.
   ``No one wants to see the law interfere with the work of this
conference,'' Van Gorder said. ``People are coming here to improve
the work they are doing in response to AIDS. They felt this is the
highest responsibility.''
   So do some two dozen AIDS activist groups, which announced plans
to attend the five-day meeting to protest the immigration policy
and publicize their claims of government inaction and drug company
profits on AIDS medications.
   ``Not joining the boycott was a painful decision for us,'' said
Tom Cunningham, a member of the New York chapter of the AIDS
Coalition To Unleash Power, better known as ACT UP. ``But we do
need the opportunity to challenge AIDS researchers and the
pharmaceutical companies.''
   The controversy is over a 1987 Senate amendment ordering the
Public Health Service to place infection by HIV, the virus that
causes AIDS, on the list of contagious diseases that may bar
foreigners from entering the United States.
   The list also includes leprosy, tuberculosis and five sexually
transmitted diseases.
   The restriction has been condemned by scores of AIDS groups,
including the National Commission on AIDS, as an infringement on
human rights. The commission's chairman, Dr. June Osborn, said the
policy fosters the impression that AIDS and HIV infection can be
easily transmitted.
   A number of groups involved in AIDS education programs and care
of AIDS patients are boycotting the conference.
   The list includes almost 100 non-governmental organizations,
including the International Planned Parenthood Foundation and the
League of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, a Geneva-based
federation of Red Cross organizations from 149 countries.
   The World Health Organization also criticized the immigration
policy and, for a time, contemplated backing out as co-sponsor of
the conference.
   Dr. Bruce Dick, health department director at the League of Red
Cross and Red Crescent, said many of the boycotting groups could
lend valuable ``ground-level experience'' to scientists at the
conference.
   ``The most negative thing about us not participating is the
missed opportunity to use a big conference like this to form
partnerships,'' he said.
   Dick said the society had 40 people from 30 countries at last
year's conference in Montreal and originally had planned to send
more representatives to San Francisco.
   The Bush administration twice has tried to blunt the outcry.
Last year, the Immigration and Naturalization Service adopted a
waiver policy that would allow those infected with HIV to stay in
the United States up to 30 days for business purposes, conferences,
medical treatment and family visits.
   The waiver also offered foreign visitors greater
confidentiality, eliminating permanent identifying marks on their
passports.
   In April, the INS said it would issue new 10-day visas for those
coming to this country for professional or scientific conferences.
Those applying for the visas are not required to state if they are
infected with HIV.
   The new visa plan cooled some of the protest, but many remain
opposed to any singling out of AIDS- or HIV-infected people.
   ``The administration has made some efforts, but we still find
the policy objectionable,'' said Sue Lucas, co-ordinator of the
United Kingdom AIDS Consortium for the Third World, a group of 40
British organizations with AIDS programs in developing countries.
   ``We are particularly concerned that this type of discrimination
in the United States would have an impact on discrimination in
other countries,'' she said.
   The controversy has brought calls for the administration to
remove AIDS and HIV infection from the list.
   Legislative leaders point to a Government Accounting Office
opinion that the secretary of health and human services can remove
the restriction, but administration officials maintain a directive
from Congress cannot be eliminated that way.
   Rep. J. Roy Rowland, D-Ga., introduced legislation in April that
would give the Department of Health and Human Services authority
over deciding which diseases are on the list.
   ``It is my opinion the administration would like a way out of
this,'' said Rowland. ``The present rule reflects adversely on the
United States, which has been a leader in scientific and medical
research for many years.''
   The United States always has placed health and social limits on
those entering the country. In the late 18th century, a prohibition
existed on ``prostitutes and beggars.''
   Today, 33 separate categories limit travel to this country, such
as medical conditions, mental disease, political ideology, bigamy
and homosexuality.
   During the wave of immigration through New York's Ellis Island,
people were forced to run up and down stairs to see if they winded
easily _ a sign of tuberculosis, INS spokesman Duke Austin said.
   The present law, which dates back to 1952, first barred those
with tuberculosis and leprosy. By 1987, the list included five
sexually transmitted diseases: gonorrhea, infectious syphilis,
chancroid, granuloma inguinale and lymphogranuloma venereum.
   AIDS was added to the list by the Public Health Service in June
of that year; HIV infection was placed on the list by congressional
mandate in August.
   Thirty-three other countries place entrance restrictions on
foreigners with AIDS or HIV infection, usually on those seeking
extended stays. Iraq demands AIDS tests for anyone staying more
than five days. Those seeking permanent residence or a stay longer
than 12 months in Australia also must be tested. Bahrain tests
certain foreign workers, such as hotel staff and hairdressers.
   Those seeking permanent entry to the United States must have a
full physical examination, but visitors are not tested for disease.
   ``Basically, it is an honor system,'' said Austin. ``There is no
way to tell unless an inspector ascertains through the discovery of
drugs or certain physical characteristics that the inspection
should be pressed further.''
   Opponents of U.S. policy say the issue is one of setting a
standard for the rest of the world. They hope a final resolution
can be reached before 1992, when another international AIDS
conference is scheduled for Boston.
   ``To many countries, the United States is a leader in terms of
its policies,'' said Dick, of the League of Red Cross and Red
Crescent. ``It is essential that we have non-discriminatory
policies because it is through non-discrimination that we are going
to control this disease.''

   Norma Chavarria, a former teacher, has
opened a makeshift store to keep going until President Violeta
Barrios de Chamorro makes the stalled economy run and ``times get
better.''
   ``We have to give Violeta time,'' she said. ``How can a
president do in 40 days what the Sandinistas couldn't do in 10
years? My husband and I are confident things will get better in
about six months.''
   Mrs. Chavarria, 24, leaned on the counter in the dirt-floored
wooden shack, where she sells single cakes of laundry soap, soft
drinks, envelopes of soup mix and other inexpensive items.
   A neighbor who had just come in said: ``That's right. Those
Sandinistas didn't do anything except make us go to meetings. A
meeting for this, a meeting for that. We have to give a little time
to poor Dona Violeta.''
   Mrs. Chavarria's husband, Jose, is a bricklayer who brings home
$20 a month, slightly more than she earned as a grade school
teacher. Her teaching papers were lost they moved here recently
from Esteli, so they decided she should open the store.
   Many people seem to share the guarded optimism of Mrs. Chavarria
and the neighbor, but there also is a ``show me'' attitude that
good times are not just around the corner.
   Nicaraguans voted the Sandinistas out Feb. 25 and inflation
still is high nearly two months after Mrs. Chamorro's pro-American
government was inaugurated.
   Inflation reached 36,000 percent in 1988, then declined to 1,800
percent in 1989.
   Francisco Mayorga, president of the central bank, now gauges it
weekly. His figures were 47 percent for the first week of May, then
17 percent, 12 and 11 for the next three.
   Mayorga, who was educated at Yale and devised Mrs. Chamorro's
economic recovery plan, accused the Sandinistas of using the
two-month transition period to undermine the new government.
   He said they spent money wildly and printed more to cover the
deficit.
   President Bush signed a $300 million aid package May 26. The
first $60 million arrived quickly and, between May 25 and May 31,
the black market price of a dollar declined from 310,000 cordobas
to 290,000.
   ``The exchange houses are supplying dollars again; that's why it
went down,'' said Jose Gutierrez, one of two dozen currency dealers
on a street near the Mexican Embassy.
   Gutierrez and his colleagues wave wads of cordobas at passing
motorists, and police look the other way.
   Another sign of improvement is a 20 percent increase in planted
farm acreage over last year, Mayorga said. Food production fell
steadily under the Sandinistas.
   On the negative side, Nicaragua's currency has been devalued
frequently since Mrs. Chamorro took office. The parallel exchange
rate, which governs most dollar transactions, had gone from 70,800
cordobas to 226,600 by May 31.
   Some Chamorro supporters are beginning to grumble.
   ``Maybe we would have been better off under the Sandinistas,''
said Julio Gonzalez, 33, who runs an auto repair shop with his
cousin. Former President Daniel Ortega, he said, ``had the economy
more or less under control.''
   What does he expect to happen now? ``Maybe we'll see an
improvement in six months, a year, but it better happen. Just like
we knocked down Somoza, we knocked down the Sandinistas. Well, we
can knock down this government too.''
   The Sandinista revolution overthrew the late President Anastasio
Somosa in July 1979.
   Rolando Perez Sanchez, a 29-year-old Sandinista union leader,
listened with skepticism to Gonzalez, his friend and neighbor.
   ``It's not going to happen,'' he said, shaking his head. ``This
government if full of bourgeois who will hoard all the capital and
leave the workers the crumbs.
   ``What we have to do is what Daniel said _ rule from below to
defend the conquests of the revolution.''
   ``Ruling from below'' took the form of a crippling strike by
public employees in May, after which the government gave broad
concessions to unions.
   Mrs. Chamorro has had to proceed carefully because of the
militant Sandinista opposition.
   Her government plans to review confiscations of property under
the Sandinistas and continues to trim the huge bureaucracy, firing
public employees.
   Sandinista threats of more strikes if the firings continued have
not materialized, and their protest marches draw smaller crowds. If
economic improvement continues, the Sandinistas could lose the
leverage of being the defenders of worker's buying power.
   Another Sandinista rallying point, the Contra rebels, might
disappear once the guerrillas demobilize.
   ``I'm like St. Thomas; I'll have to see it to believe it,''
Gonzalez said.
   For Mrs. Chavarria, who has three small children, abolition of
the two-year draft for boys of 16 is great progress.
   ``You don't know what a relief this is for us mothers,'' she
said. ``As for the rest of it, we'll have to wait. At least we eat
every day.''

<HEAD>After Fighting for Freedom, Women Demand Their Rights</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LANEY SALISBURY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Joyce Mujuru fought so fiercely in the
war for independence that she earned the name ``Spill Blood.'' Now,
10 years later, she fights for women's rights in a male-dominated
culture.
   Mujuru, 35, is minister of community development in President
Robert Mugabe's government and finds the new battle, in its own
way, as daunting as the old one.
   ``We have come a long way since independence, but there is still
a lot of work to be done educating people about women's rights,''
she said in an interview.
   In the civil war, she said, ``we fought side by side with our
men and they realized we deserved what we were asking _ laws giving
women equal rights.'' A woman historian, who asked not to be
identified, said: ``Women have retrogreessed since independence.
They only made progress because of their contribution to the war,
but now men in government are ... asserting traditional attitudes.''
   Women were a strong force in the seven-year war that ended nine
decades of white minority rule and transformed Rhodesia, a British
colony, into independent, black-ruled Zimbabwe.
   Many ferried arms, sheltered fighters or were spies for the
insurgents.
   Others engaged in combat. It was said of Joyce Mujuru that she
was the first woman to shoot down a Rhodesian helicopter.
   Women have made some advances since independence. Laws that once
barred them from certain jobs and denied them full legal rights
have been repealed. They can make contracts, own land and are no
longer regarded legally as minors.
   Turmoil has accompanied change in this African nation of 9.5
million people, more than half of whom are women.
   Wife beating, rape and baby murders are on the rise. Reports
appear almost daily of newborns found abandoned in ditches, tossed
into bushes, jammed into sewer pipes, even buried alive.
   Elizabeth Rider of Women's Action Group, blames the ``baby
dumping'' and illegal backstreet abortions on economic and social
stresses facing women.
   ``Changes in traditional culture are not keeping up with rapid
urbanization, and women are taking the brunt of it,'' she said.
   In African villages, grandmothers and aunts traditionally advise
young girls about sex. Without that help, many schoolgirls in
cities and towns become pregnant, Rider said.
   Faced with expulsion from school and shame in a culture that
ostracizes single mothers, they often have little choice but
self-induced abortions, and some even kill their babies, she said.
   Farm women still do most of the work in the fields while men sit
under the trees drinking home brew.
   ``My husband does the planning and I do the work,'' said Susan
Marewo, a farmer in northeastern Zimbabwe.
   Male judges carry traditions rooted in polygamy and male
domination into their courtrooms.
   One magistrate, after hearing the case of a man who beat his
wife to death because she refused to cook him a meal, fined the man
the equivalent of $100 and set him free. The woman had ``asked for
trouble,'' the judge said.
   Another obstacle to sexual equality is the bride price. A cow
and two goats was considered a good sum 50 years ago, but some
fathers now demand several thousand dollars for a
university-educated daughter.
   The government is reluctant to outlaw the tradition. Mugabe has
said the bride price should be considered ``a custom of expressing
thanks, not of buying a woman or a passport for oppressing her,''
but few heed his advice.
   Women's rights groups say many African men believe the more they
pay for a a wife, the greater their right dominate her.
   ``Attitudes and values are ... ingrained in our minds'' and,
unfortunately for women, hard to change, said Victoria Chitepo, the
information minister.

<HEAD>Ford Explorer: Ready To Go Off-Road</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto, LaserGraphic</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ANN M. JOB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>For The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Ford Motor Co.'s longstanding reputation for durable, rugged
trucks is safe with the 1991 Explorer, the new utility vehicle that
replaces the Bronco II at Ford dealerships.
   The Explorer Eddie Bauer 4-door 4X4 test vehicle included
push-button, shift-on-the-fly four-wheel-drive and large Firestone
AXT radial tires.
   And its electronic fuel-injected V-6 engine and four-speed,
automatic transmission handled gravel, mud and sand with ease. The
4-liter engine is rated at 155 horsepower and this model's towing
capacity is 5,700 pounds.
   The test model had sporty leather bucket seats in the front and
a firm rear bench seat that offered decent hiproom for three
adults. Rear legroom was good, helped by the 112-inch wheelbase.
   The Explorer looks compact from the outside. It handles well and
maneuvers easily into shopping center parking spaces, that despite
its nearly 80 cubic feet of cargo space with the rear seat folded
down. That's 9 cubic feet more than the Bronco II.
   Ford compares the Explorer's cargo space with others in its
class, including the Chevrolet S-10 4-door Blazer (74 cubic feet)
and the Jeep Cherokee (72). The Explorer also is the only compact
utility vehicle that offers an optional front bench seat to allow
it to carry six people.
   As expected in a utility vehicle, visibility was exceptional
because of the Explorer's high ground clearance. But like others,
the Explorer can't handle extremely abrupt moves because its high
stance contributes to significant body roll. I also noted a
somewhat soft suspension that allowed quite a number of jiggles to
creep into the ride and give the Explorer a rather trucklike feel.
The suspension, by the way, features front coils and rear leaf
springs.
   The Explorer did swallow the gas in my demanding test drive, and
the EPA fuel economy is rated at 15 miles per gallon in the city
and 20 on the highway.
   Also, buttons for tuning the AM-FM cassette radio were rather
small. I was thankful that the gear shift lever coming off the
steering column had a curve in it that allowed me to rest my hand
as I worked to change stations, especially during particularly
jumpy rides.
   Additionally, the test model had cruise control, but there was
no indicator on the dashboard to show when it was engaged.
   Thoughtful touches on the Explorer include the special rear
cargo door handle to make it easier to open the back. The standard
full-size spare tire is mounted to the frame outside the vehicle,
beneath the rear loading floor, which allows for a wonderfully
flat, unhindered and nicely carpeted storage space. The ventilation
system was powerful, and cooled and heated the interior quickly,
and the vinyl sunroof cover was a snap to release and re-install.
   The Explorer won the Four Wheeler of the Year award from Four
Wheeler magazine and was Motorweek magazine's Driver's Choice for a
multipurpose vehicle.
   Earlier this month Ford recalled 2,700 Explorers to replace
hinges on the sunroofs, saying owners could misalign them when
replacing the roof. The company said that doing so could allow the
sunroof to blow off when driving.
   Production of the new model started in mid-March and Ford hopes
eventually to make 200,000 two- and four-door Explorers annually.
Sales for the first two months were nearly 24,000, up 37 percent
from the 17,799 Bronco IIs sold in the same period a year earlier,
Ford said.
   The company expects the vehicle to be most popular with married
college graduates in their 30s and 40s with upscale jobs. Ford
expects almost half the buyers to be women.
   Competitors include the Chevrolet S-10 4-Door Blazer, priced at
$16,905 with six-cylinder engine and automatic transmission; the
Jeep Cherokee, priced at $16,405 for a model with automatic
transmission and six-cylinder engine, and the Toyota 4Runner with
V-6 engine and automatic transmission for $15,500.
   The test vehicle was a top-of-the-line Eddie Bauer version with
a base price of $21,315. A less luxurious four-door model with V-6
engine and automatic transmission carries a base price of $17,698.
   Because the Explorer is a new vehicle, Consumer Reports magazine
does not have an owner trouble report.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   According to one of his followers, the Senate
majority leader is the poor guy who works late, after most senators
are ``back home at night in pajamas, watching on television.''
   A Republican senator adds that he couldn't imagine a worse job.
   Sen. George J. Mitchell of Maine ran hard for that job, winning
the authority to shepherd senators and Senate business, or try. It
has its moments. The majority leader is a national spokesman for
his party, a man to reckon with on any federal government decision.
It also has headaches.
   Mitchell, the Democratic senator from Maine, usually is stoic,
calm and businesslike, but some days the frustration shows. His
Senate enforcement powers are limited. An earlier generation of
congressional leaders had rewards to grant and punishments to
wield. Reformers have eliminated many of them, and party discipline
has faded, as it has in the House.
   But the House does its legislative business under procedural
rules that limit debate, regulate amendments, and generally insure
that the majority on an issue will get its way. The Senate doesn't
have such a legislative traffic code, and there are no limits to
debate unless three-fifths of the senators vote to restrict it.
   The system protects not only dissenters but also absentees, who
often want actions delayed until they get back to vote. As a
result, much of the Senate's work is done under intricate
agreements worked out to protect all sides, and enforceable only
because nobody objected when they were adopted.
   Lately there have been more objections than agreements.
   A major crime bill was swamped in a sea of amendments, 337 of
them, when Mitchell said he was going to drop the bill even though
a majority wants it passed, because Republicans had twice blocked
efforts to limit debate and force it to a vote.
   Three other measures were blocked, too, one by a threatened
filibuster, one by amendments and sparse attendance, and one by the
objections of absentees who insisted on delaying the vote.
   On June 8, a Friday, Mitchell said 27 of the 100 senators were
absent, which meant those who were left couldn't do any significant
business because nobody wanted their measures brought to a vote
with that many people missing.
   ``We're just reaching the point where it is very, very difficult
to move forward on any piece of legislation,'' Mitchell said that
day.
   Like a teacher with an unruly class, he said he might take away
recess.
   He said he may start scheduling morning votes on Mondays and
Fridays, a move that would cut down on long weekends. He threatened
to shorten the four-week August recess, and said Congress may have
to work longer into the fall, even though it is an election year
and candidate-members want to quit a month before the Nov. 6
elections.
   That kind of recess discipline, or the threat of it, has been
tried before, by other majority leaders, to enforce their
schedules. Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas said he sympathized, because
when the Republican minority he leads was in the majority, he tried
to dream up ways to speed Senate business, and nothing worked.
   Sen. Alan J. Dixon, D-Ill., called the majority leader ``this
poor guy who gets here before us in the morning and leaves after we
are all back home at night in pajamas watching on television to see
what time the poor devil gets to go home.''
   Mitchell listed some of the major measures that haven't yet come
up for action: civil rights, campaign finance reform, a farm bill,
defense appropriations, housing legislation, and the biggest of the
lot, a budget resolution still under negotiation with the White
House.
   There's talk that it may take a lame-duck, post-election session
to deal with the budget. Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., thinks it will
be necessary in order to settle on a budget, to end what would by
then be sharp and automatic spending cuts. Sen. Warren B. Rudman,
R-N.H., speculates that a lame-duck session might also deal with
Senate pay and campaign reform.
   Even the deadlines and calendar pressures of a holiday-season,
lame-duck session would not guarantee swift, down-to-business
behavior. Delay becomes an even more formidable weapon against
legislation when everybody wants to quit for Christmas. And another
headache for the leader.
   ``I cannot imagine a worse job than to try to organize this
body,'' said Sen. John C. Danforth, R-Mo. ``I think it would be
absolutely terrible.''

<HEAD>Norman Ornstein Always Has the Last Word</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If snappy quotes sold for a buck apiece,
Norman J. Ornstein would be a wealthy man.
   A political scientist at the American Enterprise Institute, a
right-of-center think tank, Ornstein is hardly a household name.
But he happens to be one of the most widely quoted people in
Washington.
   At the ring of a telephone, he spouts expert opinions on just
about any topic, from perestroika to peanut subsidies, from ethics
to ethnic restaurants.
   He's the ``King of Quotes,'' the sultan of sound bites, the imam
of instant analysis, the titan of talking heads. He's the darling
of TV producers and the garrulous savior of quote-hungry newspaper
reporters battling a deadline.
   ``If I have an opinion, I'll give it,'' he says.
   Jo-Ann Moriarty remembers her introduction to Ornstein in 1986,
when she was a rookie Washington reporter for States News Service
and needed some quotes for an election-year story she was writing
about Rep. James Broyhill, R-N.C.
   ``The guy at the next desk said, `Have you called Norm Ornstein
yet?' I said, `Norm who?' He said, ``He's Mr. Congressional
Comment.' So I phoned Ornstein, and he returned my call
immediately.''
   She felt flattered, then astonished.
   ``I asked him about Broyhill, and it was like pressing a button.
He just spit it all out, everything I wanted to know,'' said Ms.
Moriarty, who was grateful for Ornstein's punchy one-liners but a
bit embarrassed that she'd never heard of him before.
   ``I just didn't realize he was such a big cheese,'' she said.
   Journalists praise Ornstein for his insider's savvy, his
accessibility and his ability to cut quickly to the essence of a
complex subject in lively, easy-to-understand language.
   ``He's a master of the pithy quote,'' says Peggy Robinson,
senior political producer for public TV's ``MacNeil-Lehrer
NewsHour,'' where Ornstein frequently appears as a guest
commentator.
   ``I try to restrain myself and not quote Ornstein too often,''
says Helen Dewar, congressional correspondent for The Washington
Post. ``But when I'm analyzing a situation, I'm frequently curious
what he thinks. And he will unfailingly say something I just have
to quote. It's too good to pass up. No one puts it so concisely or
so well.''
   How did Ornstein become Washington's most quotable man?
   ``I was sitting in a Laundromat a couple of blocks from near my
apartment on Capitol Hill in the early 1970s, twiddling my thumbs
while my clothes were in the dryer,'' he recalled.
   He'd just finished reading a book about former Harlem
congressman Adam Clayton Powell, and thought it would make for an
interesting book review.
   ``I had a yellow pad and a pen, so I just dashed off a review in
an hour, and sent it to the Post. They printed it on the front page
of the Style section with a picture.''
   A short time later, he talked to a feature writer about his
favorite country inns. His quotes popped up in a Page One story in
the Wall Street Journal. ``I was thunderstruck,'' Ornstein said.
And bitten by the media bug.
   He started writing reviews and Op-Ed pieces for the Post and The
New York Times, which led to stints as a commentator and
documentary editor for public television, which led to appearances
on network TV talk shows.
   As his visibility grew, reporters started calling him for quotes
to lend an authoritative ring to their stories. Ornstein happily
obliged.
   ``I had a pretty good feel for what journalists were looking
for, and I found frankly that it served my own interests,'' he
said. ``I could learn an awful lot by talking to reporters who were
working on stories in ways that I didn't have the time to do
myself. There could be a pooling, a sharing of information.''
   To keep abreast of things, Ornstein, 41, reads voraciously _ at
least five newspapers every day plus stacks of magazines and
academic journals. He goes to Capitol Hill three days a week to
roam the corridors. He spends about two hours a day talking to
journalists.
   He attends luncheons, seminars, receptions and speaking events
to ``schmooze and pick things up.'' He even quizzes fellow airline
passengers and fathers on the sidelines of neighborhood soccer
games.
   Spoofing Ornstein's supposed omniscience, the irreverent New
York magazine Spy peppered a special Washington edition last month
with no fewer than 17 opinions from Ornstein on everything from
taxi fares to sex scandals. President Bush ranked second with 14
references.
   ``One of Spy's editors called to say they'd gotten hundreds of
letters,'' Ornstein said with a chuckle. ``Most of them asked, `Who
the hell is this guy Norman Ornstein?'''

<HEAD>Small-Scale Farmers Might Profit From Proper Use of Flower Power</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Raising specialty flowers could mean the sweet
scent of success for small farmers who study markets and learn the
tricks of the trade.
   It can be downright tasty, too.
   ``Dried or fresh, certain specialty flowers can stimulate not
only the eyes but also the sense of taste or smell, empowering new
marketing enterprises for small-scale enterprisers,'' says a new
report by the Agriculture Department.
   The overall business of growing flowers and other floriculture
crops is nothing to sneeze at. Last year's wholesale value was
about $2.43 billion, up 6 percent from 1988.
   By comparison, corn was the most valuable crop at more than $17
billion. But floriculture, as a group, exceeded the 1989 estimated
value of many notable commodities, including sorghum, $1.28
billion; oats, $557.5 million; durum wheat, $319 million; rice,
$1.1 billion; and sugar beets, $2.39 billion.
   Specialty flowers represent a portion of the total floriculture
industry, rather like lambs or pigs being part of livestock
production.
   The possibilities of growing and selling specialty flowers are
examined in a new one-sheet report, part of a series by the
department's Office for Small-Scale Agriculture.
   Previous topics have included tree farming, sheep, goats,
mushrooms, foliage plants, herbs, wildflowers, specialty vegetables
and ``exotic'' livestock such as ostriches, llamas, alpacas, water
buffalo and European fallow deer.
   And now specialty flowers.
   ``Such flowers can be marketed fresh, dried, sugarcoated, in
bulk, as singles, or by the pound, ounce, or sometimes gram,'' the
report said. ``This exciting market, although subject to whims of
designers, chefs or fashion, continues to grow to meet demands.''
   Growers meet specific needs, including rare cut flowers, edible
flowers for garnishes or salads, potpourri mixes, and medicinal
plants.
   But as in any specialty, flowers must meet consumer expectations
reflected in production, packaging and presentation, the report
said. Small-scale entrepreneurs also should become acquainted with
members of local chefs' associations or state restaurant groups.
   The report urged would-be specialty growers to read trade
journals and other publications to learn more about techniques and
demands.
   Stan and Susan Devoto of Sebastopol, Calif., learned at a local
farmers' market how edible flowers could be a marketing aid for
produce, they told The Furrow magazine.
   ``You need something different to get noticed,'' Susan said.
   Gourmet chefs and discerning grocery shoppers are seeing a wide
range of old favorites these days, including calendula,
chrysanthemum, dianthus, dandelion, geranium, hibiscus, lily,
nasturtium, pansy, rose and blue violets.
   ``Others include certain herb flowers like mint, sage, basil and
bergamot, and even vegetable flowers such as pumpkin, okra and
squash,'' the USDA report said.
   Farmer David Aydelotte of Salisbury, Md., said chefs using his
field-grown mint flowers and herb flowers are always looking for
new garnishes.
   ``Many chefs are looking for a social event, a story that goes
with the food,'' he said.
   Another example cited by USDA is the Victorian technique of
candying flowers used by Jo and Rob Pendergraph of Midlothian, Va.,
and reported in the Delmarva Farmer newspaper.
   In this technique, each flower petal is painted with egg white
and sprinkled with granulated sugar. After the sugar has
crystalized, the flowers are stored in airtight containers.
   The Pendergraphs said the candied flowers sell for $45 per 100
at a major New York City department store.
   Competition is even fiercer in the dried-flower market, the USDA
report said. A number of references and guides were listed, along
with their costs and addresses for ordering copies.
   The report was prepared by Thomas S. Handwerker of the
University of Maryland-Eastern Shore, and George B. Holcomb of the
department's Office of Public Affairs.

<TEXT>
   The Columbia River drains a Texas-sized
corner of northwestern North America, its historically pristine
waters rushing to the Pacific Ocean.
   Seemingly spared the industrial pollution threatening other
great rivers, the Columbia is the heart of a vast and fertile land.
   Majestic bald eagles nest along its lower reaches. Salmon fight
their way upstream in an annual ritual of renewal.
   But all may not be well on the river. Environmentalists, armed
with federal studies, say a nearly imperceptible adversary
threatens to drain the life out of the Columbia.
   The 1989 studies by the Environmental Protection Agency show six
pulp and paper mills on the Columbia in Oregon and Washington dump
dioxins and related toxic compounds into the river, where they are
accumulating in fish in unprecedented amounts.
   An EPA official concluded the pollution poses a significant
threat to human health and the environment.
   The EPA sampled bottom fish in the Columbia. Unlike migratory
salmon, bottom feeders, such as carp and sturgeon, spend their
lives in the river.
   Dioxins, the chemical that caused the evacuation of Love Canal,
cause cancer in laboratory animals, and some scientists are
questioning studies that so far have found no cancer link in
humans. The compounds also persist in soil for years.
   Dioxins and other chlorinated organic compounds are byproducts
of bleaching wood pulp to make white paper. While many industrial
processes produce dioxins, environmentalists say the pulp mills are
the greatest offenders on the river.
   Based on EPA guidelines, the Oregon Department of Environmental
Quality and the Washington Department of Ecology are considering
limits on discharges of the most toxic of the dioxins, 2,3,7,8-TCDD
of 0.013 parts per quadrillion in water just downstream from the
mills. A concentration that low cannot be measured using current
technology, so the states would use a mathematical formula to
calculate whether the mills are in compliance.
   The limits on dioxin discharges are written into permits for the
mills, but final action is being delayed by appeals in Oregon,
where new permits have been issued. Washington's Department of
Ecology is in the final stages of preparing new permits.
   The regional pulp and paper industry says meeting the new
standards would be too expensive, $815 million over three years for
all the mills in the region. And it says its own study shows dioxin
levels that are undetectable or well within U.S. Food and Drug
Administration limits. Its conclusion: River fish are safe to eat.
   All this is enough to rile people like Mary O'Brien, staff
scientist of the Northwest Coalition for Alternatives to Pesticides
in Eugene.
   ``This is the most toxic compound known to humans,'' she said.
``And if we can't tell the industry `no' to dumping the most toxic
compound known to humans into the river for some superfluous
purpose like whiteness of paper, what are we willing to regulate in
the world?''
   O'Brien's group, along with Columbia River United, want dioxin
discharges eliminated.
   ``Stop talking to me about how much dioxin is acceptable,''
O'Brien said, ``and start talking to me about how to get rid of it
all.''
   Publicly, one of Oregon's top public health officials, Dr.
Laurence Foster, has agreed there is no reason to advise most
people to eat less fish.
   But privately, in a March 16 letter to Llewellyn Matthews,
executive director of the Northwest Pulp and Paper Association,
Foster tore into the industry's study.
   After several months of review, he said, the Oregon Health
Division found the study did not support the conclusion that
Columbia River fish are safe.
   ``It would seem the good citizen's responsibility to do
everything possible to prevent future generations from being
exposed to ever-increasing body burdens of this toxic chemical,''
said Foster, acting health officer and deputy administrator of the
Oregon Health Division.
   ``I encourage you, for the sake of future Oregonians, to do
everything possible to stop all discharge of dioxin into the
environment.''
   In an interview, Foster said he had no comment beyond the
letter, made public by John Bonine of the Western Natural Resources
Law Clinic at the University of Oregon. Foster added he did not
mean to question the good intentions of the industry, only the
science upon which the conclusion that the fish are safe to eat was
based.
   The state eventually plans its own study of the fish.
   Industry spokesmen say they are reducing dioxin discharges. But
they argue it is unfair to set standards at undetectable levels.
   ``We're going to undertake every reasonable effort to reduce,''
Matthews said. ``We're shooting for 80 percent.''
   She said environmentalists blow the danger out of proportion.
``Dioxin is overrated as a carcinogen,'' Matthews said.
   Alternatives exist to the chlorine bleaching process that
produces dioxins. One mill, the James River mill in Camas, has
produced dioxin-free paper as an experiment.
   However, industry officials say consumers want the bright white
paper produced by chlorine bleaching. They are reluctant to make
the expensive transition to alternatives as long as there are
doubts about whether consumers will buy the new products.
   But that's not good enough for O'Brien. ``These animals just die
out silently,'' she said. ``No one comes around and says, `Hey, I'm
dying.' ''

<HEAD>Mr. Tornado Creates Violent Storms for Research</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STANLEY D. MILLER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Tetsuya Theodore Fujita saw his only natural
tornado near Denver in 1982. ``It was like meeting my lover,'' he
says.
   ``Since then, my passion really went up,'' said Fujita, a
professor of geophysical science who has been studying tornadoes
for 42 years and is considered one of the world's foremost
authorities on the violent storms.
   Fujita, 69, spends much of his time in his lab at the University
of Chicago creating tornadoes for research.
   He creates tornadoes over a large fan, which makes a swirling
motion; another fan above simulates a low-pressure system by adding
an updraft to the mix. With a bit of steam added to make the
phenomenon visible, he gets twisters 6 to 8 feet tall.
   The miniature versions are as impossible to redirect or squelch
as their full-sized cousins, he says. He's tried by crawling right
up next to them and using rulers or books to change their direction.
   Fujita came to the United States from Japan in 1953, partly
because there are so many tornadoes in this country.
   ``Tornadoes are very rare in Japan,'' Fujita said. ``They have
just about 10 to 15 a year. But one occurred within about 15 miles
of my hometown. I was quite impressed with the localized severity
of the wind.''
   When he saw his first, he and a team of scientists were studying
wind shear and its effect on aircraft.
   ``It's a beautiful thing,'' Fujita said. ``Of course, I was 20
miles away from that one.
   ``If you're in it,'' he added, ``it's a terrible thing.''
   Forecasters still have trouble predicting tornadoes.
   But Fujita has helped define the conditions most likely to spawn
them. Groups of thunderstorms are not as likely to spawn tornadoes
as single, large storms because multiple storms in the same area
compete.
   ``Each one tries to rotate, but they all can't. They're just
like human beings: The rich may become richer and the poor may get
poorer.''
   Fujita also discovered that most strong tornadoes are actually
six or seven small twisters he called suction vortices, rotating
around the center of a larger tornado.
   ``A suction vortex can pick up a car or a small house or
something, but when you're standing right next to it you can be
completely safe.''
   He has studied tornadoes that have dropped houses into lakes,
made off with one car and left another right next to it untouched,
and moved whole flocks of cows and sheep _ which lived through the
experience.
   He also developed a scale for measuring the strength of
tornadoes, called the Fujita scale. It runs from zero _ a tornado
that might break twigs on trees _ to five _ a twister that can rip
houses from their foundations.
   But Fujita considers his work on other air movements called
downbursts and microbursts some of his most significant.
   Downbursts are powerful drafts of air moving down from a
thunderstorm cloud. Scientists long thought the drafts dissipated
before reaching the ground.
   Microbursts are smaller versions of downbursts, which are more
dangerous because they give pilots less time to react, Fujita said.
   The National Transportation Safety Board has cited microbursts,
a term coined by Fujita, as the cause of 17 aircraft accidents in
the past 15 years, causing 577 fatalities.
   Among them was the 1985 crash of a Delta L-1011 at Dallas that
killed 137 people. A downburst also was implicated in the collapse
of a wall at a school in Newburgh, N.Y., that killed nine children.
   Fujita's work helped persuade the Federal Aviation Administation
to begin installing a new radar system at 47 major airports
beginning in the early 1990s.
   The Doppler radar system was credited with helping three
jetliners at Denver's airport avoid potentially catastrophic
microbursts last year.
   Fujita retires from teaching this year, but will continue his
research at the university.
   ``In Texas one time, five people were killed when they drove
right into a tornado. They just didn't know any better,'' Fujita
said. ``I want to make people safer.''

<HEAD>Doghouse, Volcanic Ash Give Clues to Mysterious Mounds Creation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA ASHTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A geologist who built a doghouse with some
dusty plywood believes he may have discovered the obvious to
explain the mysterious prairie mounds that dot the landscape.
   The mounds, also known as Mima or pimple mounds, are scattered
across Washington, Oregon, California, Wyoming, Colorado, northern
New Mexico, southeastern Oklahoma, eastern Texas, Arkansas and
western Louisiana. They long have baffled scientists.
   Andrew Berg, a geologist for the U.S. Bureau of Mines, believes
the mounds were formed by earthquakes thousands of years ago. Some
other scientists did not discount his theory but said more research
is needed.
   ``Right after the St. Helens ash-fall 10 years ago, I was
working in my backyard here in Spokane on a kennel for my dog.
There was a plywood board on the ground. It had a little dusting of
St. Helens volcanic ash on it,'' Berg said.
   He laid some 2-by-4s on the board to nail a frame.
   ``I started hammering away and all of the sudden, I looked at
the board and here were these little bumps of ash.''
   It's the same principle that clumps sawdust when vibrated by a
table saw.
   Berg, 64, wondered if the vibrations on a larger scale, such as
seismic activity, might have created the hillocks.
   So he tried again, this time with a bread board-sized sheet of
plywood and some loess, a fine-grained soil. ``I tapped it with a
hammer and sure enough, vibrations caused little miniature
mounds,'' Berg said.
   The hammer creates shock waves. Some parts of the board vibrate
hard and others are still as the waves intersect. Similar wave
interference during earthquakes could have created Mima mounds in
areas where loose soil sits on a hard surface, such as rock, Berg
said.
   The minimounds were not wiped out by subsequent blows of the
hammer, leading Berg to believe the mounds are stable.
   He said his theory could help explain why the mounds, first
written about 150 years ago, form in such different climates.
   At Mima Prairie, south of Olympia, hundreds of mounds range from
8 feet to 50 feet across and up to 6 feet high. They're not always
easy to see except from the air.
   Some scientists have said they were built by gophers or formed
by glacial action. No one really knows.
   ``There's probably almost as many ideas on the origin of these
things as there are people who have looked at them,'' said Charles
Higgins, a geology professor at the University of California-Davis.
   Higgins said he doesn't know if Berg is correct, but he admits
the theory answers some geological questions. ``I'm inclined to
think that the mounds are more the result of some kind of field
stress _ desiccation cracking or frost cracking,'' he said.
   ``I would like to have seismologists either verify it (the
theory) or set it aside. I hope it's widely discussed and kicked
around,'' Berg said.
   Albert Lincoln Washburn, a retired geology professor at the
University of Washington, said the idea needs research.
   ``It's intriguing, but the basic evidence remains to be
forthcoming,'' Washburn said. ``I don't think it's been proved that
all these mounds in different parts of the country have the same
origin, by any means.''

<HEAD>Fruit Desserts: Indulgences for the Health-Conscious</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY MacVEAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   One of the things that makes a healthy diet hard
to stick to is the feeling that you're missing out.
   Try fruit.
   Fruit is, of course, tempting when local fruits are at their
peak. Then, they are the ``first and foremost of the fast food
desserts,'' say cookbook authors Sheryl and Mel London.
   But year-round, dressed up, fruit can be elegant and wipe out
any sense of deprivation.
   Herbs or flowers mixed with fruit seems a new combination in
American cooking, but, in fact, it's an idea that dates back
centuries and is now being revived as cooks search for more local,
healthful foods to replace the butter and cream and chocolate that
have so often signaled dessert.
   Sorbets are fat-free, easy to make and can be adapted to just
about any fruit.
   In warm weather, fruit can be grilled. The natural sugars in
fruit carmelize over the coals, so all that's needed is to skewer a
selection of fruits and place them on the barbecue. A yogurt-based
fruit sauce makes it fancy.
   ``We are both addicted to a healthful diet: low in fat and
relying mostly on fish and chicken for our protein needs,'' the
Londons write in their new book ``Fresh Fruit Desserts: Classic and
Contemporary'' (Prentice Hall Press, $24.95).
   While theirs is not a diet book, they kept health in mind: ``We
have attempted to address our concerns about cholesterol by relying
more upon spices, herbs, citrus and liqueurs to provide flavor,
while being quite prudent in paring down the amounts of cream,
eggs, butter and sour cream.''
   To that end, they think about fruits as ``the featured
players.'' The flavor is brought out, not disguised. For
out-of-season or tropical fruits, shipped from far away, that might
mean poaching, baking or gratineeing.
   In designing recipes, Mrs. London said in a telephone interview,
``We sort of did a countdown backward and eliminated.''
   ``We'd look at a recipe and say, `Six eggs! Let's try it with
one and egg whites.' You'd be surprised at how often it works,''
London said.
   A banana souffle, for example, calls for just a half-cup of milk
and two egg yolks to serve four. Strawberry witches froth, served
in wine glasses, needs just fruit, egg whites and a half-cup of
sugar, along with flavorings, to serve eight people.

<HEAD>Whites and Older Americans Drink More Coffee, Study Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans drink more than 24 gallons of
coffee per man, woman and child annually, but according to the U.S.
Department of Agriculture, whites and older people drink more than
their share.
   ``Age and race are factors associated with consumption of
coffee,'' said Sharon J. Mickle of the Human Nutrition Service at
the Agriculture Department.
   A USDA study was based on interviews in 2,800 homes around the
country from April 1987 to Aes and 35 percent of blacks interviewed said
they drank coffee
during the three-day survey period.
   ``I really was surprised by the difference,'' Ms. Mickle said.
   Ms. Mickle spoke recently at the Fourth Annual Conference of the
Association for the Study of Food and Society at Drexel University.
The convention featured nutritionists and sociologists from the
United States, Europe, Mexico and India.
   Ms. Mickle said in 1988, the amount of coffee consumed in the
nation equaled 24.3 gallons per person.
   Paul Rozin, a psychology professor at the University of
Pennsylvania, said people who prefer black coffee may do so for its
stimulating effects. He said his research indicates those who like
black coffee often do not favor other coffee products such as
coffee ice cream.
   ``You can't predict from how much someone likes black coffee
whether they will like coffee yogurt,'' he said.

   The Commerce Department said Wednesday that sales skidded 0.7
percent to a seasonally adjusted $146.84 billion after falling a
revised 0.9 percent in April and 0.4 percent in March. Sales had
not fallen for three straight months since the fall of 1981.
   Commerce had said originally that sales were down 0.6 percent in
April and 0.2 percent a month earlier. They were unchanged in
February after rising 2.8 percent the previous month.

   Worries about the quality of loans to finance
takeovers and commercial real estate spread to the West Coast as a
leading rating agency downgraded the debt of two top California
banks.
   Moody's Investors Service on Wednesday lowered its ratings on
the long-term debt of Security Pacific Corp. and Wells Fargo Corp.
by one notch.
   The action came just two days after the agency downgraded the
debt of Chase Manhattan Corp., holding company for the nation's
second largest bank, because of concerns about real estate lending.
   Also in recent weeks, Moody's and rival rating agency Standard &amp;
Poor's Corp. have lowered their ratings on Citicorp, the nation's
biggest bank, citing real estate and takeover loans.
   Moody's latest action affected $3.2 billion in debt of Wells
Fargo and its subsidiaries, and about $7.4 billion at Security
Pacific. Despite the downgrades, the debt retains a solid
investment-grade rating.
   The actions drew protests from the two companies, whose main
subsidiaries, Security Pacific National Bank and Wells Fargo Bank,
are the second- and third-largest banks in California and among the
top ten in the nation.
   Moody's did not describe specific problem loans, but said ``the
California real estate market has only begun to soften.''
   Wells Fargo and Security Pacific have diversified real estate
portfolios and apparently sound underwriting standards, Moody's
said. Both companies may be forced to beef up reserves against
losses because of the weakening California market, though, it said.
   Both companies also have substantial exposure to highly
leveraged transactions, such as corporate buyouts and
recapitalizations, Moody's said. The adjustments reflected growing
concern that California may be about to suffer real estate woes
common elsewhere in the country. On Tuesday, for example, San
Diego's HomeFed Bank said its nonperforming assets rose by $81
million in May, due mainly to bad commercial real estate loans in
California.
   HomeFed's stock fell $8.25 a share to $25 on the New York Stock
Exchange Wednesday, dragging down other California bank and thrift
stocks. Wells Fargo, for example, was off $2.37{ at $81.67{;
Security Pacific lost 75 cents to close at $40.37{.
   Moody's announced its downgrades after the market closed.
   The agency lowered its ratings on the two bank holding company's
senior debt to single-a1 from double-a3. Significantly, however, it
did not change its ratings on the companies' commercial paper.
   Banks tend to rely on commercial paper for short-term funding,
and a downgrade there could have triggered an immediate rise in
funding costs for the two banks.
   Wells Fargo and Security Pacific officials protested the lower
ratings.
   ``We have maintained a well-balanced loan portfolio consistent
with the demands of the marketplace, and with adequate and
appropriate levels of reserves,'' Security Pacific Chief Executive
Robert H. Smith said in a statement.
   Leslie Altick, Wells Fargo senior vice president for investor
relations, said the bank was not convinced California real estate
is headed for new problems. Softness in the office building and
hotel markets is well-documented, but Wells Fargo believes
California's underlying economy is too strong for a major downturn
to occur, she said.
   As for loans for corporate buyouts, she noted that Wells Fargo's
portfolio, while still about $4 billion, had been steadily
declining because of the drying up of takeover and buyout activity.

<HEAD>Ameritech, Bell Atlantic in $2.4 Bln Deal to Buy New Zealand's
Phone Co.
^Eds: Figures are in U.S. dollars</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   In the biggest investment to date by any regional Bell telephone
company, Ameritech and Bell Atlantic are teaming up with two New
Zealand partners to buy New Zealand's state-owned phone company for
$2.4 billion.
   The two Bell companies announced the purchase agreement Thursday
morning in Wellington, New Zealand, and issued a news release late
Wednesday in the United States.
   The Telecom Corporation of New Zealand is the country's
principal supplier of domestic and international communications
services. It is being sold as part of the government's campaign of
selling off state-owned enterprises.
   Steve Ford, a spokesman at Ameritech's headquarters in Chicago,
said the two Baby Bell companies and their New Zealand partners won
the phone company in a bidding contest against other New Zealand
and international companies.
   He said it was the biggest single investment by any of the
regional Bell companies since they were created in the breakup of
American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Co. six years ago.
   ``This represents a significant step forward as we look to
become a major global telecommunications company,'' Ford said. The
New Zealand company has good growth prospects in its home market
and serves as a telecommunications gateway to the Pacific Rim, he
said.
   Raymond W. Smith, chairman and chief executive of Bell Atlantic,
said the purchase ``supports our strategy to be a leading
international information and communications company.''
   Under the deal, Ameritech and Bell Atlantic will buy all of the
phone company from the New Zealand government, then reduce their
combined stake to 49.9 percent, with each company owning 24.95
percent.
   The companies' two New Zealand partners _ Fay, Richwhite and
Freightways _ will buy 5 percent stakes each from Ameritech and
Bell Atlantic.
   The two American companies then will sell shares for the
remaining 40.1 percent on the New Zealand stock market and
internationally. The stock offering will be aimed at maximizing
participation by New Zealand investors, the companies said.
   Ameritech's Ford said the companies plan to complete the
purchase within 90 days and begin the stock offering in the first
quarter of 1991.
   Telecom of New Zealand had net income of $148 million on
revenues of $1.31 in the year ended March 31.
   Ameritech teamed up with Bell Atlantic because the two companies
have a similar strategy and their combined financial strength was
needed to make the purchase without affecting domestic operations,
Ford said.
   Ameritech will finance its share of the purchase with its own
cash and short-term borrowings, he said. The purchase won't affect
phone rates in the Midwest, he said. Ameritech owns Bell companies
providing phone service to 12 million customers in Illinois,
Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Wisconsin.
   Bell Atlantic is based in Philadelphia and provides telephone
service in the Mid-Atlantic region.

<HEAD>Incentive Decline, Consumer Jitters Hurt Car and Truck Sales</HEAD>

   Lower incentives and sagging consumer confidence
combined to push early-June car and truck sales down 13.1 percent
from a year ago, analysts and automakers say.
   The 10 major U.S. automakers said Wednesday they sold cars and
trucks at an average daily rate of 30,412 during the June 1-10
period this year, compared with a rate of 34,994 during the same
time last year.
   Car sales fell 15.5 percent and truck sales were off 8.8 percent.
   In line with the recent pattern, sales by the Big Three U.S.
automakers fell sharply while Japanese companies continued to boost
sales from their plants in this country.
   The main reasons for the overall decline were slow demand and
smaller incentive packages this year, said economist Tom Webb of
the National Automobile Dealers Association in McLean, Va.
   ``The reason they are cutting back on incentives is that they
haven't overstocked the dealers,'' Webb said of the automakers.
   Ward's Automotive Reports said that at the end of May, new-car
inventories among the 10 major U.S. automakers stood at 59 selling
days, considered good for late spring.
   Meantime, the U.S. Commerce Department reported Wednesday that
May retail sales fell 0.7 percent, the third straight month of
decline. Some analysts interpreted the drop as an indication of
sagging consumer confidence.
   Sales of the domestic cars made by General Motors Corp., Ford
Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. dropped 19.2 percent in the latest
period while sales of U.S.-made cars with Japanese company
nameplates rose 34.8 percent.
   The Big Three held 89.1 percent of the car market in late June
and the Japanese ``transplants'' held 10.9 percent.
   Through June 10 this year, domestic car and truck sales were
running 4.4 percent behind last year's pace, with car sales down
5.6 percent and truck sales down 2.2 percent.
   For the entire year, Big Three car sales were down 10.8 percent
and transplant car sales were up 42 percent.
   Chrysler showed the largest decline in early-June car and light
truck sales with an 18 percent decline. The company's vehicle sales
so far this year are off 13 percent from last year.
   GM said its combined early-June car and truck sales were 16.7
percent behind last year's pace. So far this year, GM has sold 4.8
percent fewer vehicles than last year.
   Ford reported a 12.4 percent drop in early-June and is down 8.8
percent for the year to date.

   Here are sales results for the 10 major U.S.
automakers for first period of June 1990.
   Percentage changes in sales are based on average daily sales
during each period rather than comparisons of straight totals.
There were eight selling days in the period this year and nine
selling days last year, and 136 selling days so far this year,
compared with 136 selling days in the corresponding period a year
earlier.
   Cars and trucks made in the United States by Honda, Nissan,
Toyota, Mazda, Subaru, Isuzu and Mitsubishi are counted as domestic
and appear in this table separately and combined as transplant cars.
   Cars and trucks imported for sale under the GM, Ford and
Chrysler names are counted as foreign. Sales of imported cars and
trucks are reported at the end of each month.

<HEAD>Big Board Volatility Report Doesn't Win Any Converts on Capitol
Hill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A New York Stock Exchange report that found
little fault with program trading and recommended the Securities
and Exchange Commission rule over stock-index futures did little to
advance the political debate over the two issues.
   Supporters of the embattled Commodity Futures Trading Commission
_ engaged in a jurisdictional battle with the SEC over
stock-related futures _ said Wedensday the report backed their
arguments while some SEC partisans said it doesn't go far enough to
support theirs.
   But politicians and others who have been dealing with proposals
for broad market reforms since after the 1987 crash indicated the
new study would have little or no effect on positions already taken.
   Among the recommendations of the stock exchange's 18-member
panel was the establishment of a single regulator for stocks and
stock-related futures. Legislation for such a change is being
considered by Congress.
   Publicly, Senate and House members were restrained in their
comments about the report by the panel, which was ordered to
investigate market volatility following the stock market plunge
last Oct. 13.
   Sen. Donald W. Riegle, D-Mich., chairman of the Banking, Housing
and Urban Affairs Committee, said the Senate panel would ``review
these recommendations carefully.''
   Rep. Edward J. Markey, D-Mass., chairman of the House
subcommittee that oversees the SEC, called for passage of pending
market reform legislation to bolster the SEC's enforcement powers.
   Congressional aides, who spoke only on the condition of
anonymity, said the report would be interpreted differently by
supporters of the SEC or CFTC to bolster their respective causes.
   ``It'll be used on both sides of the argument,'' said one Senate
aide familiar with the issues. ``I don't think it's going to have
any effect on the pending legislation.''
   Recommendations by the panel, headed by General Motors Corp.
Chairman Roger B. Smith, included consolidating regulation of
stocks and stock-related futures under one federal agency to
improve investor confidence.
   Program trading strategies involving simultaneous trading of
huge amounts of stock and stock-index futures have been blamed for
causing or worsening big price swings in the stock market.
   Such trading was criticized after the Oct. 13, 1989 market drop,
when the Dow Jones industrial average fell 190 points, and blamed
for worsening the Oct. 19, 1987 crash in which the Dow fell 508
points.
   Legislation to put stocks and index futures under one regulator
is bitterly opposed by the CFTC, the Chicago futures exchanges and
members of House and Senate agriculture committees that oversee the
CFTC.
   ``I think this bill builds our case against switching
jurisdiction,'' said a Senate Agriculture Committee aide. ``The
panel found no evidence that a single regulator would affect
volatility.''
   However, the aide noted, there was no evidence that
consolidating regulatory authority would prevent a future stock
market crash.
   ``That contradicts the belief that Congress needs to act (on
switching authority) to prevent one,'' said the aide.
   That point was echoed by a spokesman for the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission.
   ``A couple of the recommendations were not supported by the
analysis,'' said CFTC spokesman David Gary. He said the report
found no evidence that shifting regulatory authority for stock
index futures from the CFTC to the SEC affects market volatility,
but recommended doing so ``to improve investor confidence. What's
the basis?''
   On the issue of program trading, said Gary, ``I think we will be
in the same corner'' as the panel.
   The NYSE panel found nothing inherently wrong with program
trading, indicating it was more of a public relations problem than
a threat to market stability.
   A market reform bill passed by the House contains a provision
for curbing program trading during periods of extreme market
volatility. The Senate version of the bill, which has stalled in
committee, contains no program trading provision.
   Markey, a strong opponent of program trading, didn't address the
program trading aspect of the report. But he said the panel's
report ``makes a compelling case for cracking down on intermarket
trading abuses like front running.''
   Front running is the trading practice of taking advantage of
advance knowledge of a large and potentially market-moving customer
order in one market by taking an offsetting position in another
market.

<HEAD>Worried About Paying Your Bills? You're Not Alone, Survey Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Americans are worried about paying bills run up
in the '80s and pessimistic about the '90s, according to a poll
done for financial planners.
   The findings were not unexpected, said Robert A. Hewitt,
chairman of the Atlanta-based International Association of
Financial Planners. The group commissioned the survey by the Gallup
Organization.
   ``I think those of us who deal with the public on a daily basis
... we've been pretty much aware of it,'' Hewitt said.
   The poll, being released today, found 46 percent of the
respondents expressed worry about their ability to meet all of
their financial responsibilities, and 52 percent said they were
concerned about outliving their retirement savings.
   Baby boomers had more anxiety than most. Among respondents
between the ages of 35 and 44, 59 percent were worried about their
ability to meet financial responsibilities and 62 percent were
concerned about outliving their savings, the survey said.
   Hewitt called that age bracket ``triple squeeze boomers''
because they are having to deal with the costs of raising children
and taking care of their aging parents, as well as tending to their
own needs and desires.
   ``All of a sudden they have this discretionary income and
discover, `Gosh, I'm going to have to pay for college for little
Johnny,''' Hewitt said.
   College costs have risen beyond the reach of most American
families and severe inflation is likely to be a problem in this
decade, according to 80 percent of respondents.
   As a result, 61 percent said they were less inclined to take
financial risks than during the 1980s, the survey said.
   Conducted in April among 1,058 households in a random sample and
an additional 600 with incomes of at least $50,000, the survey had
a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percent.
   Along with the concerns about long-term security, Americans are
starting to increase their savings rate, Hewitt said, adding that
he is a staunch advocate of saving more.
   ``I'm not suggesting spending less. I'm suggesting we go on a
cash and carry basis _ a more prudent spending habit,'' he said in
an interview from New York.
   ``Maybe you're going out to eat three times a week,'' Hewitt
said for example. ``Maybe you can go out two times a week, or three
times a week at a less expensive place.
   ``We're not going to kill the restaurant business by doing
that.''

<HEAD>FDIC May Restrict or Prohibit Delaware Law on Banks Selling
Insurance</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By THERESA HUMPHREY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DOVER, Del. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Delaware's bank commissioner says the state
will cooperate with a federal agency that has suggested banks be
prohibited or restricted from underwriting insurance, despite a
Delaware law that allows it.
   The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. has proposed regulations on
the subject, but they have never been implemented. State Bank
Commissioner Keith H. Ellis said Wednesday the writers of the
Delaware law had copies of the FDIC's proposals when the law was
written.
   Ellis reviewed the state law Monday with FDIC officials.
   ``We discussed the safeguards that were in the Delaware
legislation and the fact that those were put in the legislation
with the proposed rules of the FDIC before us,'' Ellis said.
   Ellis would not discuss the details of the meeting, but said all
parties expressed a spirit of cooperation.
   ``We discussed what was in the bill and the types of things
we'll be looking at as the bill begins to take effect,'' Ellis
said, adding he does not foresee any changes in the law. No more
meetings are scheduled.
   ``The scope of regulatory authority (in the state office) and
that of the FDIC (is), I believe, to be sufficient to address any
concerns that we will discuss,'' he said.
   Nonetheless, FDIC Chairman William Seidman plans to have his
staff recommend that banks either be prohibited from underwriting
insurance or the activity be limited to subsidiaries whose sources
of capital have been separated from the bank, spokeswoman Caryl A.
Austrian said.
   The Delaware law allows state-chartered banks to sell and
underwrite insurance through a subsidiary, department or division.
   The law allows any bank to put up to 25 percent of its capital
into the insurance operation, but the assets, liabilities and
records of the insurance subsidiary must be kept separate from the
bank.
   In a statement, Seidman said he was concerned about extending
FDIC protection to banks with insurance operations.
   The Delaware law ``opens up a whole host of issues about safety
and soundness and the appropriateness of extending the federal
safety net to banks that engage in `new' or nontraditional
activities like insurance underwriting,'' Seidman said.
   ``We started to consider these issues a few years ago _
specifically in regard to real estate development and insurance
underwriting activities. I think it is time, given recent
developments, to revisit these issues,'' Seidman said.
   Citibank, the nation's largest bank, and Chase Manhattan Corp.,
the nation's second-largest, both have plans to open insurance
operations in Delaware.
   Citibank has received approval from Ellis' office, but still
must receive approval from the state insurance commissioner.
   Ellis said preliminary talks have begun with Chase, which must
become a state-chartered bank before it can engage in the insurance
business.
   Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve Board has yet to act on a request
from five insurance trade organizations to block Citibank from
selling insurance from its Delaware offices.

   Stock prices were higher at midday Thursday,
pushed up by rising stock-index futures.
   London's stock market opened a bit lower but soon picked up as
futures prices surged ahead. Stocks have been supported lately by
growing overseas demand, helped by a steadier British pound and
speculation that sterling could soon enter Europe's exchange rate
mechanism.
   Shortly after midday in London, the Financial Times-Stock

<BYLINE>Moody's Puts Chrysler Under Review
^By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Moody's Investor Services Inc. is reviewing its
credit ratings for Chrysler Corp., indicating concern about the
company's finances, an official said today.
   Fitch Investors Service Inc., another New York rating agency,
said Chrysler was not under review. Telephone calls to Standard &amp;
Poors Corp. officials were not immediately returned this morning.
   News of Moody's review comes as the nation's No. 3 automaker
struggles with declining sales and market share and the loss of key
executives.
   ``There has been deterioration of their performance in the
marketplace and competition is making inroads,'' said Harold H.
Goldberg, chairman of Moody's corporate rating committee.
   He said new minivans and sport-utility vehicles other automakers
are beginning to sell are pointed directly at Chrysler's popular
Dodge and Plymouth minivans and Jeeps. Much of Chrysler's profit
stems from sales of those vehicles.
   Chrysler said Wednesday it had sold 752,935 North American-made
cars and trucks through June 10, down 13 percent from the same
period last year. The company's share of the U.S. car market is
11.4 percent, down from 13.1 percent a year ago, and its portion of
the truck market dropped to 21.8 percent this year from 23.2
percent last.
   Goldberg said he expected Moody's would decide whether to change
Chrysler's Baa2 rating by the end of the month. The Baa2 rating
reflects a medium level of investment-grade securities.
   Chrysler issued a statement calling Moody's review
``inappropriate and unwarranted.''
   ``Chrysler believes that its first-quarter profitability was
impressive given the massive reduction in dealer inventories and
points out that the company's $1.5-billion ongoing cost-cutting
program contributed substantially to those results,'' the company's
statement said.
   Chrysler said it earned $71 million in the first quarter of this
year, down 80 percent from year-ago profits. In January, the
automaker's earnings were dented severely by a big incentive
program featuring $1,000 rebates on Dodge Caravan and Plymouth
Voyager minivans.
   Big incentive programs and temporary production cuts during
January by Chrysler, No. 1 General Motors Corp. and No. 2 Ford
Motor Co. slashed a huge buildup of unsold new vehicles.
   Meantime, a report in Wednesday's Wall Street Journal said
Chrysler is considering buying Dollar car rental, one of the few
remaining rental car companies not owned in large share by an
automaker.
   Officials from Dollar and Chrysler, which already owns Thrifty
Rent-A-Car System Inc. and Snappy Rental Inc., declined to confirm
or deny the report.
   Goldberg said such an acquisition could be good for Chrysler
since rental car companies provide stable markets for automakers.
   ``Any further participation in the rental business would be at a
modest cost and we would view it relatively positively,'' Goldberg
said.
   Goldberg also said Moody's was concerned about the recent drain
on top executives at Chrysler.
   During the past six weeks, Gerald Greenwald quit as vice
chairman to head a $4.54-billion union bid to buy United Airlines,
and Michael Hammes left as vice president for international
operations to run Black &amp; Decker Corp.'s huge toolmaking
operations. Chrysler Motors Chairman Bennett Bidwell said he will
retire at the end of the year and Treasurer Frederick Zuckerman has
said he will leave this summer.
   ``It's a disappointment to see all of the defections, mainly
because they have this challenge on their plate to restore the
degree of profitability and market share they had before,''
Goldberg said.

<TEXT>
   Wholesale prices rose a moderate 0.3 percent
in May as a fourth consecutive drop in energy prices helped offset
a rise in food costs, the government said today.
   Energy costs fell 1 percent last month while food costs
increased 0.6 percent, according to the Labor Department's Producer
Price Index for finished goods, one stop short of retail.
   Today's report was roughly in line with economists' projections.
   It was the fourth straight moderate report since a severe cold
snap sent prices spiraling 1.9 percent in January, a 15-year record.
   For the first five months of the year, inflation at the
wholesale level was running at a 4.0 percent annual rate, down from
4.8 percent for all of 1989, the government said.
   Private analysts viewed the report as good news on the inflation
front, especially after the huge price increases caused by the last
winter's freeze.
   ``We're back on trend after the wiggles of December and
January,'' said Donald Ratajczak, director of economic forecasting
at Georgia State University.
   ``The inflationary fears that picked up in the winter months
clearly did not have a good foundation,'' Ratajczak said.
   Today's moderate inflation data might strengthen arguments that
the Federal Reserve no longer needs to keep such a tight grip on
interest rates to hold down inflation, analysts said.
   ``What we're seeing is a reversal in an earlier inflationary
trend, which may indicate that the time has come for the Fed to
ease up on credit by reducing interest rates,'' said Ron Schreibman
of the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors.
   He noted that over the past 12 months, wholesale prices have
risen a modest 3.1 percent.
   ``This report shows that we are neither veering into recession
or are we in a situation where inflation is accelerating rapidly,''
Schreibman said.
   The Labor Department revised the data for the first two months
of 1990, saying wholesale prices soared 1.9 percent in January
rather than 1.8 percent. February prices fell 0.1 percent rather
than holding steady. Wholesale prices also fell slightly in March
and April.
   In May, energy prices dropped 1 percent after having fallen by
even larger amounts the previous three months. Gasoline prices were
down 2.1 percent and fuel oil fell 6.2 percent. Natural gas
increased 0.9 percent.
   Food overall was up 0.6 percent after having declined by that
amount the previous two months.
   The price of fruits dropped 8.4 percent, vegetables fell 3.9
percent and eggs were down 21.8 percent.
   But that wasn't enough to offset increases in the costs of other
foods, such as the 7.7 percent hike in the cost of pasta, 4.9
percent increase in pork and 8.8 percent rise in the cost of fish.
   Excluding the volatile food and energy sectors, prices rose a
mild 0.2 percent, the identical increase of a month before.
Economists often consider this ``core'' number a better indicator
of underlying inflationary pressures in the economy.
   Automobile prices rose 0.3 percent in May after falling the
previous two months.
   Women's and children's clothing costs were up while men's fell
slightly.
   The price of tobacco was up 3 percent while the cost of
household flatware, appliances and home electronic equipment fell.
   The various changes put the index for all finished goods at
117.7 in May. That means a hypothetical selection of goods that
cost $100 in 1982 cost $117.70 last month, up from $114.20 a year
earlier.
   Price pressures in earlier stages of the production process were
down in May. Intermediate goods and crude goods both fell 0.1
percent. An example of the three processing stages would be bread
for finished goods, flour for intermediate and wheat for crude.
   Consumer prices, up at an annual rate of 6.8 percent for the
first four months of 1990, have been rising at a steeper pace than
wholesale costs. May consumer numbers are due out Friday.
   Producer prices reflect only the cost of goods while consumer
prices are heavily influenced by the cost of services.

   The Supreme Court ruled today the government
may impose severe fines against air polluters even when federal
officials are slow to decide on proposals for cleaning up the
atmosphere.
   By a 9-0 vote, the justices upheld the Enviromental Protection
Agency's power to seek fines of up to $25,000 a day against a
General Motors plant in Massachusetts.
   The impact of the ruling for future cases may be limited. The
House and Senate have passed separate bills revising the federal
Clean Air Act that establish new timetables to address the kind of
problem at issue in the General Motors case.
   Congress is expected to complete action on the legislation this
year.
   Today's case involves pollution from car paint at a GM assembly
plant in Framingham, Mass., and focuses on the joint federal-state
system for cracking down on dirty air.
   GM shut down the Framingham plant last year in a cost-cutting
move.
   Under the federal Clean Air Act, the EPA sets national air
quality standards. The states are required to adopt plans to meet
those standards and submit them to the federal agency.
   The EPA in 1980 approved a Massachusetts plan for reducing
pollution from paint at auto assembly factories.
   The plan required car makers to comply fully with the federal
rules by Dec. 31, 1985.
   But EPA officials extended the deadline for any plant switching
from lacquer paints to enamel, which emits less pollutants.
   GM initially planned to stay with lacquer at the Framingham
factory but in June 1985 announced it would convert to enamel by
the summer of 1987. The company asked that it be exempt from the
Dec. 31, 1985, standards for 20 months.
   Massachusetts officials approved GM's proposal and submitted a
revised plan to the EPA on Dec. 30, 1985.
   Without waiting for federal approval, GM began building a $200
million plant in Framingham to use the enamel system while
continuing to operate its factory that uses lacquer paint.
   EPA officials went to federal court in August 1987 seeking fines
of up to $25,000 a day against GM for 20 months of air-quality
violations at the old Framingham plant.
   It was not until September 1988 that the EPA rejected the
state-approved pollution control system at the new plant.
   A federal judge barred the EPA from imposing fines against GM
for violations of the Dec. 31, 1985, standards. The judge said the
federal agency itself violated the Clean Air Act by taking more
than four months to rule on the state-approved plan submitted Dec.
30, 1985.
   But the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 1988 said the EPA's
failure to meet the four-month deadline does not disqualify it from
fining companies that violate previously approved pollution control
rules.
   The appeals court ordered further lower court hearings to decide
the size of the fines.
   The Supreme Court today upheld the appeals court ruling.
   Justice Harry A. Blackmun, writing for the court, said
references to the four-month deadline in the law do not ``create a
general requirement that (the EPA) process all proposed revisions
(in clean-air plans) within four months.''
   ``Passing mention'' of the four-month period cannot be
``inflated into a requirement that (the EPA) process each and every
proposed revision within four months,'' he said.
   The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, siding with GM, said a ruling
favoring the government is an incentive to the EPA to delay and
treat businesses unfairly.
   The case is General Motors vs. U.S., 89-369.

<DATELINE>HEILIGENSTADT, East Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Hubert Rulitschka knows
exactly what he's going to do when he swaps his East German money
for West German marks next month.
   ``It's going right into the bank. I can't afford to go crazy
with money. After all, I might lose my job after July 2,'' said
Rulitschka, who sells baked goods on this border town's tiny market
square.
   East Germany is less than three weeks from its official plunge
into capitalist waters, and there's much concern about how high and
dangerous the resulting waves will be.
   West Germany's powerful mark will become East Germany's legal
tender and the two nations will merge as a single economic entity.
   East Germans will be able to exchange up to 4,000 East marks at
a 1-to-1 rate and the remainder at 2-to-1 under the economic merger
agreement. Exchanging the first 4,000 marks will give an East
German the equivalent of nearly $2,400.
   Economic merger will be a huge step toward German unification
and dislocations are inevitable.
   As many as 2 million people could lose their jobs as inefficient
factories and businesses disappear. But no one is certain how high
unemployment will really climb.
   There also is worry that handing marks to East Germans could
cause a nationwide buying spree and a rise in inflation on both
sides of the border.
   Residents of this town of 16,000 appear to have faith in Western
promises of eventual affluence.
   Their optimism is not surprising. The East German economy is
near collapse as the result of four decades of Communist
mismanagement.
   But East Germans also are worried that the possible aftershocks
_ especially the loss of jobs _ could be severe.
   Heiligenstadt's giant Solidor factory, which makes zippers,
buckles and other small items, will likely emerge relatively
unscathed from the merger because it already has a good position in
the international market.
   But even at Solidor, workers worry about job security.
   ``This job is boring, but I don't fancy the idea that I might
lose it. I have not been told whether I'll have it after the
ecomomic merger,'' said a young woman working on an assembly line.
   Hartmut Scherf, Solidor's general director, said up to 160
people among the 2,400-strong work force may have to be let go
immediately.
   Hope and trepidation are reflected in East Germans' plans for
their newly acquired marks.
   There are people like Rulitschka, who figure it's best to build
up a security net in case the transformation to capitalism gets
rocky.
   But there are others anxious to use their hard currency to
improve their lifestyles.
   Rudolf Kessel, a Heiligenstadt gynecologist, has big plans for
the marks he and his wife will receive. His wife is also a
physician, and she wants to start a private practice at home.
   ``We'll buy new equipment to be used at home. It all comes from
West Germany, and costs a lot of money,'' said Kessel.
   A colleague of Kessel's said she is eager to get marks, but also
worried because her rent will go up as East German subsidies are
scrapped.
   ``I'm paying 100 marks (about $30) right now,'' she said. ``I
figure that will triple.''
   In Muehlhausen, an industrial city about 12 miles away, a young
woman said she's going to buy a second-hand Mercedes.
   ``We've been dreaming about the West's wealth for a long time,''
said the woman. ``I'm not going to miss this chance to get exactly
what I want.''
   Even though the official starting date for economic union is
July 2, it has in fact already begun.
   A man from the West German city of Kassel has set up a used-car
lot in East Germany, just across the border. East Germans driving
in and out of their homeland can get a good look at his cars.
   The prices average 5,000 marks, or $2,958, just about the right
price for an East German who has just been handed a wad of marks.
   For weeks, West German traveling salesmen have been roaming East
German roads, making deals and scouting out places where they can
set up their own outlets after the merger.
   West German tourist agencies have set up offices in East German
communities, offering travel deals to exotic places like Majorca
and Paris, sites many East Germans have only read about or seen on
television.
   Much of the produce now sold on East German squares was grown in
West Germany.
   Workers _ from factory employees to chimney sweeps _ are
undergoing retraining by West Germans to help prepare them for new
kinds of work in a quickly changing nation.
   Bernd Beck, the Heiligenstadt mayor, says he is worried because
his city hall employees aren't trained for the Western-style
bureaucracy that will quickly develop in communities across East
Germany. Retraining of city employees has already begun, he said.
   But he's convinced the fruits of economic union will far
outweigh the discomforts.
   ``People are for the most part optimistic, because they know
they'll have real money and that they can buy good products with
it,'' said Beck.
   ``Daily life has already become better for us,'' he said.
``We're able to buy video recorders and good television sets at
lower prices then before.
   ``We can only be winners.''

   Stock prices slipped today in a listless
response to the latest statistics on inflation.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 3.71 to 2,926.24
in the first 90 minutes of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 5 to 3 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 442 up, 756 down and
523 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 43.75 million shares as of 11
a.m. on Wall Street.
   The Labor Department reported that the producer price index of
finished goods rose 0.3 percent in May, toward the upper end of the
range of advance estimates on Wall Street. The index fell 0.3
percent in April.
   Excluding its volatile food and energy components, analysts
noted, the index was up 0.2 percent, matching its April showing.
   Brokers said the news presented neither any cause for severe
worry nor any signs of dramatic progress in the Federal Reserve's
campaign to rein in inflation.
   Thus, they said, it gave investors little or new fresh
encouragement for hopes that the Fed might soon move toward a more
stimulative credit policy.
   Banking and other financial issues generally showed fractional
losses. Federal National Mortgage fell 1&lsqb; to 42\; Citicorp dropped

   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
.71 to 198.29. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down .72 at 364.32.
   On Wednesday the Dow Jones industrial average closed with a 3.47
loss at 2,929.95.
   Declining issues slightly outnumbered advances on the NYSE, with
711 up, 774 down and 507 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 158.91 million shares, against 157.10

<HEAD>Philips Warns 1990 Profits Will Drop During Overhaul</HEAD>
<DATELINE>EINDHOVEN, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Philips NV electronics
multinational on Thursday warned that the replacement of its
president and a major company overhaul would not prevent this
year's profit from falling far behind normal.
   The unusual warning to investors that 1990 earnings would be
``very low'' marked a major move toward openness by the electronics
giant.
   Philips faces a lawsuit by U.S. stockholders who claim they were
misled by the company, which allegedly issued overly optimistic
predictions over the first quarter of this year.
   On May 14, Philips chairman Cor van der Klugt resigned after
accusations that he failed to disclose until the very last minute
that Philips would barely be breaking even over that period.
   Philips net profit from normal operations were a mere 6 million
guilders, the equivalent of about $3.2 million, in that quarter,
down from 223 million guilders, or $117 million, in the first
quarter of last year.
   In a brief statement released Thursday, Philips warned this
year's second-quarter profit will be ``appreciably lower'' than
last year's second-quarter figure of 197 million guilders, or $104
million.
   ``Net result for normal business operations for 1990 as a whole
will ... be at a very low level,'' said the statement, blaming the
setback on a major restructuring program.
   Philips' income for all of 1989 totaled 792 million guilders,
$417 million.
   Details on the overhaul will be disclosed on July 2, a day after
Van der Klugt's successor Jan Timmer takes over, Philips spokesman
Ben Geerts said.
   Dutch newspapers have speculated that Timmer, who is credited
with salvaging Philips' Consumer Electronics Division through
widespread staff reductions, may sell off its computer division,
which has been blamed for the disappointing first-quarter results.
   Industry analysts attribute Philips' woes to poor managment and
tougher competition from Asian electronics companies.

   Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady told
Congress today that the administration's savings and loan bailout
could exhaust its borrowing authority as soon as the
October-December quarter.
   The Resolution Trust Corp., the 10-month-old agency responsible
for cleaning up the S&amp;L mess, ``could, with an aggressive schedule
of case resolutions, run out of funds by the end of this calendar
year or early next year,'' Brady told the House Banking Committee.
   His latest testimony followed by three weeks a dramatic increase
in the administration's estimate of the cost of the S&amp;L problem.
Brady had roughly doubled the estimate to between $89 billion and
$132 billion, after earlier insisting that $50 billion provided by
Congress last year could cover most S&amp;L losses.
   Any estimate of how much more money is needed from taxpayers is
``highly uncertain,'' Brady said, but a ``representative range''
for fiscal year 1991 beginning Oct. 1 would be ``about $30 billion
to slightly over $50 billion.''
   He did not specify how the administration believed the money
should be raised, saying only that the matter should be considered
in budget negotiations between the White House and congressional
leaders.
   He strongly suggested that Congress should provide an open-ended
authorization for more rescue spending, rather than a specific
amount that may prove inadequate.
   Providing a specific amount ``means having to face the prospect
of returning at relatively short intervals as markets change and,
with them, the estimates,'' he said.
   Brady said the bailout program could continue beyond the end of
this year without new funds by slowing down the pace of its S&amp;L
rescue program and gambling that real estate markets and interest
rates will improve. But, he rejected that.
   ``We believe that there is too much speculation already. Our job
is to be steady, do the work, and take no further gambles with the
taxpayers' money,'' he said.
   Brady's assessment of when the money will run out is supported
by the Congressional Budget Office, which told the committee's
chairman, Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas, that the RTC ``will
exhaust its $50 billion ... early in fiscal year 1991.''
   RTC Chairman L. William Seidman, in remarks to reporters
Wednesday, indicated his agency has at least enough borrowing
authority left to handle another 95 to 120 failures. The RTC so far
has seized 443 failed S&amp;Ls, ``resolving'' 148 by paying off
depositors or by selling the institutions to new investors.
   It plans an additional 45 resolutions by the end of June. And,
Seidman said, it expects to handle 50 to 75 in the July-September
quarter.
   But the agency still is having difficulty keeping up with the
failure rate. Thrift regulators have indicated at least another 299
institutions still operating independently appear headed for
failure.
   Despite the dramatic increase in the administration's new S&amp;L
cost estimate, the Congressional Budget Office is attacking it as
too conservative.
   Brady had based his new cost estimate on assumptions that 925
S&amp;Ls would topple. However, CBO director Robert D. Reischauer said
that does not include an additional 792 institutions that are
technically solvent but would fail if forced to list their assets
at market value.
   Reischauer said his office expects many marginal institutions to
fail, leaving only about 1,200 healthy S&amp;Ls. Even if few marginal
thrifts fail, Brady's cost estimate should be $150 billion,
Reischauer said in a letter to Gonzalez. The administration is not
factoring in the cost of likely delays in closing so many S&amp;Ls, he
said.
   In a separate development, the RTC intensified its effort to
sell repossessed S&amp;L real estate, offering to provide potential
buyers with personalized computer lists of properties that may
interest them.
   Effective today, 35,908 properties valued originally at $14.9
billion will be open to offers. More than half the properties,
19,067, with a value of $10.2 billion, are in Texas. The rest are
scattered through 45 other states, the District of Columbia and
Puerto Rico.
   Mostly the agency is offering residential parcels _ 29,977
properties _ but it is also listing 232 pieces of land and 5,699
commercial properties.
   ``We have everything available from a $15,000 pool hall in
Houston to uranium mines,'' said Lamar C. Kelly Jr., RTC director
of asset and real estate management.
   The new inventory is current through next March 31. In January,
the RTC released its first list of 30,123 properties, current
through Sept. 30. The agency has sold 13,200 of those, leaving
about 17,000 to be carried over to its new list.
   Kelly said the agency hopes a new marketing strategy _ using
computers _ will expose the RTC's real estate to more buyers.

   Forecasts for good growing conditions in the
Midwest sent grain and soybean futures tumbling this morning on the
Chicago Board of Trade.
   Prices opened lower across the board, as expected after
Wednesday's losses. But the declines in the corn and soybean
markets were unexpectedly steep.
   Analysts attributed much of the selling to the National Weather
Service's latest 30-day outlook, released late Wednesday, which
predicts normal to above-normal temperatures and rainfall in
Midwestern growing regions through mid-July.
   The agency's new six-to-10-day outlook projects similar
conditions during the period June 19-23.
   The forecasts prompted selling by commodity funds at the opening
bell ``and no one was there to buy it,'' said Mark Weidner, an
analyst with Cargill Investor Services Inc. in Chicago.
   In early trading, wheat futures were 1 cent to 2{ cents lower
with the contract for delivery in July at $3.32} a bushel; corn was
1{ cents to 5 cents lower with July at $2.85} a bushel; oats were
3{ cents to 6{ cents lower with July at $1.37{ a bushel; soybeans
were 9 cents to 10{ cents lower with July at $5.96 a bushel.
   Livestock and meat futures were lower in early trading on the
Chicago Mercantile Exchange, led by sharp declines in the pork
markets due to sluggish demand for pork products and bearish chart
signals.
   Live cattle futures were .20 cent to .55 cent lower with June at
76.70 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .05 cent to .37 cent lower
with August at 84.60 cents a pound; live hogs were unchanged to
1.40 cents lower with June at 62.90 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were 1.10 cents to the permitted daily limit of 2 cents
lower with July at 68.45 cents a pound.
   Cattle futures settled mostly higher on Wednesday while pork
futures were mixed.

   The stock market headed down, reflecting concern
about corporate earnings and new evidence of economic sluggishness.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 3.72 points on
Wednesday, dropped 12.62 to 2,917.08 by noon on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 9 to 4 in trading of New
York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 388 up, 896 down and 526
unchanged.
   Brokers said the market was brought down partly by technology
stocks, which slipped after reports of lower earnings estimates
affecting two companies.
   Digital Equipment Corp. said external forecasts were too
optimistic for the Maynard, Mass.-based company's fourth-quarter
earnings. James Osterhoff, vice president of finance, said the
company's U.S. market continues to be sluggish, as are certain
markets overseas.
   Michael Metz, a managing director at Oppenheimer &amp; Co., said the
news triggered a round of futures-related computerized program
selling which brought down technology stocks.
   Digital was down 2~ to 85\ at noon.
   Meanwhile, United Telecommunications stock fell 4 to 40&lsqb; in
heavy trading after PaineWebber Inc. analyst Jack Grubman cut his
earnings estimates for the company's 1990 second quarter and full
year.
   The market's general direction was off after the Labor
Department reported that the producer price index of finished goods
rose 0.3 percent in May, toward the upper end of the range of
analysts' estimates.
   Brokers said the news was disappointing but not unexpected, and
gave investors little encouragement that the Fed might move soon to
relax interest rates.
   Banking and other financial issues generally showed fractional
losses. Federal National Mortgage fell 1\ to 42&lsqb;; Citicorp dropped
| to 23; Chase Manhattan slipped | to 24|; and BankAmerica slid }
to 31\.
   Precious metals stocks also fell, with Newmont Gold down 1} to
36&rsqb;.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
1.37 to 197.63. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down 1.31 at 363.73.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 71.19 million shares at noon,
down from 78.61 million at the same point Wednesday.
   Due to an NYSE closing price error on Wednesday for Chevron, the
closing average for the Dow Jones 30 industrials was 2,929.70,
rather than 2929.95, as reported earlier.

   The former owner of the collapsed Vernon Savings &amp;
Loan today said he is innocent of charges that he spent thousands
of dollars in thrift money on pleasure trips, prostitutes and
illegal contributions to politicians.
   Donald R. Dixon, 50, was charged Wednesday with conspiracy,
misapplication of funds, making false statements and other offenses.
   ``Perhaps when my day in court comes, if they'll listen, they'll
find out what really happened and the blame can be properly
assessed and properly assigned,'' Dixon said.
   Dixon appeared before U.S. Magistrate John B. Tolle this morning
and was freed on a personal recognizance bond.
   He did not enter a plea at his court appearance, but told
reporters afterward that he intended to plead innocent.
   ``For the moment, the U.S. government is making a scapegoat of
me because they're unaccountable for their role in the $500 billion
or greater loss the American taxpayer has to pay,'' he said.
   His attorney, William Ravkind, refused to let Dixon answer a
question about his personal finances.
   The indictment alleges the political contributions were made
``for the purpose of currying favor and influence'' in anticipation
of regulatory action by the Texas Savings and Loan Department and
the Federal Home Loan Bank Board.
   Prosecutors said the politicians didn't know the contributions
were illegal, and none was charged. Nor were any thrift regulators.
   If convicted on all charges, Dixon faces 190 years in prison and
a $9.5 million fine.
   Government attorneys said the thrift is a prime example of abuse
in the S&amp;L industry. Under Dixon, who moved the thrift to Dallas
from the town of Vernon, assets of the thrift grew tenfold until
federal regulators shut it down.
   Five other Vernon officials have pleaded guilty to crimes in the
$1.3 billion collapse of the S&amp;L. Former president Patrick G. King
and former chairman Woody F. Lemons have been sentenced to prison
for their part in the 1987 collapse.
   ``These complicated, white-collar crime cases take time to
develop, but the Justice Department is committed to the
investigation, prosecution and incarceration of those who ripped
off our financial institutions and have left the taxpayers of the
United States holding the bag,'' U.S. Attorney Dick Thornburgh said
in a statement.
   Dixon was accused of encouraging employees to make about $7,000
in political contributions and then reimbursing them with expense
money or phony bonuses to skirt restrictions on corporate campaign
contributions.
   Among other things, Dixon was charged with conspiring with other
Vernon officials to give money to Texas Democrat Jim Wright, the
former House speaker who was pressing federal regulators to stop
trying to close insolvent Texas thrifts.
   The indictment alleged Dixon also billed Vernon $10,500 for
prostitutes for himself and others at a 1985 Vernon board of
directors' party at Dixon's Solana Beach, Calif., beach house and
on a yacht cruise in San Diego harbor.
   In 1985, Dixon allegedly used Vernon money for hunting trips
with senior Vernon officials to Kansas and San Diego. L. Linton
Bowman III, then commissioner of the Texas Savings and Loan
Department, went along, the indictment said.
   Lodging, meals, female companionship and other expenses cost
$4,866, the indictment said.
   Dixon also was accused of using his airplane for an illegal
activity _ transporting prostitutes from Texas to California.
   Former Vernon vice president Patrick Malone testified at King's
1989 trial that contributions were solicited from King and other
top thrift executives. The money was for the 1986 gubernatorial
primary campaign of former Rep. Tom Loeffler, R-Texas, and the
re-election bids of Wright, who resigned after a House ethics
investigation unrelated to the Vernon case; former Rep. Jack Kemp,
R-N.Y., now secretary of Housing and Urban Development; Sen. Jake
Garn, R-Utah, and Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif.
   Dixon threw parties for other S&amp;L operators aboard his yacht on
the Potomac River in Washington to raise money for the Democratic
Congressional Campaign Committee, chaired by then-Rep. Tony Coelho,
D-Calif., the indictment said.
   At Coelho's request, Wright intervened with federal regulators
to discuss Vernon, according to a report to the House Ethics
Committee by Richard J. Phelan, an outside counsel hired to
investigate Wright.
   Phelan reported that Wright telephoned Edwin Gray, chairman of
the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, and asked if Vernon were going to
be shut down.
   Wright told the ethics panel he did not know Dixon. But Phelan's
investigation produced a picture of Wright and Dixon aboard the
yacht. The photograph bore the inscription, ``My best personal
regards, Jim Wright.''
   Wright's administrative assistant in Fort Worth did not
immediately return phone calls seeking comment today.
   Dixon was the lead defendant in a $540 million federal fraud
lawsuit brought after the Vernon shutdown but had not faced
criminal charges until Wednesday.
   The lawsuit alleged that Dixon and other thrift officers grossly
overstated Vernon's profits and net worth in order to pay $22.1
million in illegal dividends to Dondi Financial Corp., a holding
company headed by Dixon.
   The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. lawsuit said top
officials ``began to loot Vernon for their personal financial
benefit and defraud its depositors, creditors and the FSLIC.''

   Share prices finished lower Thursday on London's
Stock Exchange in trading made nervous by a drop on Wall Street.
   Dealers said shares powered ahead throughout most of the session
on a combination of a blue-chip stock shortage and robust demand
for stock-index futures.
   But a poor showing on Wall Street sparked an afternoon sell-off
in London, they said.
   By the close of the London market, the Dow Jones industrial
average was off 17.82 points at 2,912.13.
   However, some traders said the London market's dip Thursday,
after several sessions of extremely good gains, wasn't worrisome.
   At the close, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index
was down 2.4 points, or 0.1 percent, at 2,403.0.
   The index finished well below its peak for the day of 2,430.5
and was just a shade better than the low of 2,401.9.
   The Financial Times 30-share index was down 4.6 points at
1,928.6 at the close. The Financial Times 500-share index rose 0.03
point to close at 1,299.62.
   Volume was 554.2 million shares, compared with 611.2 million
shares Wednesday.

   The stock market headed down today, reflecting
concern about corporate earnings and new evidence of economic
sluggishness.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, down 3.72 points on
Wednesday, was down 4.95 to 2,924.75 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 9 to 5 in trading of New

   Digital was down 1~ to 86\ at 2 p.m.
   The most heavily traded stock on the NYSE was United

   The market's general direction was off after the first of
several economic reports due by week's end. The producer price
index of finished goods rose 0.3 percent in May, which brokers
found disappointing but not unexpected. The report provided little

   The market is also approaching Friday's ``triple witching
hour,'' an event that happens four times a year on Wall Street,
when quarterly contracts to buy or sell futures and options tied to
stock indexes expire. It has been known to create sharp,
unpredictable price gyrations in stocks and can trigger heavy
trading toward the close.

   Business inventories inched upward 0.1 percent
in April while sales fell 1.1 percent, the government said Thursday
in the second report this week showing increasing consumer caution.
   ``It is disconcerting that the consumer sector is so weak,''
said Evelina Tainer, senior domestic economist with the First
National Bank of Chicago. ``The consumer sector is supposed to be
the underpinning of economic growth and the weakness does not bode
well for growth in the second quarter.''
   The Commerce Department said business sales totaled a seasonally
adjusted $533.04 billion, down from $535.99 billion in March when
they rose 0.6 percent. Sales on the retail level were down 0.9
percent in April.
   In a report Wednesday, the department said retail sales in May
fell 0.7 percent. It was the first time they had declined for three
consecutive months since the fall of 1981, during the last
recession.
   Analysts have attributed consumer caution to a sluggish job
market and weak wage gains.
   Retail sales represent about half of consumer spending, which
has been a driving force for the economy during much of the last
eight years. Overall, consumer spending accounts for about
two-thirds of the nation's economic activity.
   However, Ms. Tainer said, inventories are keeping in line with
sales and their slight increase in April ``does not lead to any
recessionary outlook.''
   If inventories were to rise excessively, it could mean cutbacks
in production and a loss of jobs.
   Commerce said business inventories in April totaled a seasonally
adjusted $794.46 billion, up from $793.67 billion in March, when
they were unchanged from the previous month.
   The April business activity produced a 1.49 ratio of inventories
to sales, up slightly from a 1.47 ratio a month earlier but down
from the 1.53 ratio last November.
   The ratio means it would take 1.49 months to exhaust inventories
at the April pace. It peaked at 1.70 in October 1982 during the
last recession.
   In addition to the drop in retail sales, manufacturing sales
were down 1.2 percent and wholesale sales were off 1.1 percent.
   Retailers had the biggest increase in inventories, up 0.3
percent, followed by a 0.1 percent gain in the manufacturing
sector. Wholesalers' inventories, on the other hand, dropped 0.2
percent.

<HEAD>Southland Announces Revised Restructuring Proposal; Missed Payment</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: AMs version planned.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Debt-ridden Southland Corp., owner of some 6,900
7-Eleven convenience stores, Thursday announced a sweetened
restructuring proposal for its bondholders and said it would miss
an interest payment due Friday on its public debt.
   The revised restructuring, a key condition of the troubled
company's agreement to sell a controlling interest to its
Japan-based partners, also would reduce the stake held by
Southland's founding Thompson family.
   Southland has been struggling to continue making payments on the
billions of dollars in debt it incurred in 1987 when the Thompson
family took the company private in $4.9 billion leveraged buyout.
   In March, it agreed to sell a controlling interest to its
Japanese partners, Ito-Yokado Co. Ltd. and 7-Eleven Japan Co. Ltd.,
for $400 million and the assumption of debt.
   Under the revised proposal, bondholders would receive debt
securities with an aggregate principal amount of about $550
million, bearing cash interest at rates of 12 percent to 14 percent
and maturing in six to seven years. The original restructuring
proposal offered bondholders $350 million for their debt.
   Preferred stockholders would get shares of a new issue of
preferred stock or common stock of the same value. Bondholders and
preferred shareholders also would end up with a total of 18.5
percent of Southland's common stock.
   The Thompson family would see its stake in Southland reduced to
6.5 percent.
   ``We estimate that the terms of the revised exchange offers
represent an increase in current value of approximately $200
million over the original offers,'' said Clark Matthews,
Southland's chief financial officer. ``Our goal in significantly
improving the proposal is to put Southland on solid financial
footing as quickly as possible.''
   The company said it would not make certain interest payments due
Friday on its public debt, but would meet continuing obligations to
its trade creditors.
   7-Eleven Japan, the largest convenience store operator in Japan,
operates 3,940 licensed stores. Ito-Yokado, which Southland
described as Japan's most profitable supermarket chain, owns 50.3
percent of 7-Eleven Japan. Southland has had a 17-year affiliation
with the Japanese concerns.
   Heightened competition in the convenience store business, plus
disappointing sales and earnings growth, have made it tough for
Southland to keep making payments on its huge debt, much of which
is in high-interest junk bonds.
   Matthews said the debt and stock restructuring was necessary to
give Southland the leeway to make capital expenditures necessary to
remain competitive.
   Southland reported a first-quarter loss of $69.4 million.

   By way of introduction, 75-year-old Thomas F.
Fallon Sr. lifts his knit yellowshirt to display a scar that cuts
an arc from near the spine around the rib cage to the center of the
chest.
   The mark of surgery in 1981, along with smaller scars from tubes
inserted into his body for a month, are among the more visible
reminders of the penalty for nearly 50 years of working with
cancer-causing asbestos.
   Fallon's wife, Josephine, says he used to be ``a big Irishman.''
Now he struggles to lift himself from a chair, breathes heavily and
tires easily, whether on the short walk to the corner store to buy
the Daily News or while painting the kitchen doorframe.
   Asbestos encased the boilers that Fallon built and repaired
throughout his career. It tumbled in chunks from ceiling pipes at
the Brooklyn Navy Yard in the 1950s. Workers often cut blankets
from rolls of asbestos to protect themselves from heat.
   ``We used to lay on it. We used to handle it with our bare
hands,'' Fallon says, pulling out pictures of ship engine boiler
rooms, technical diagrams, faded medical bills and legal
correspondence.
   ``We never thought it was poison in those days,'' he says.
``People were dying. They never knew they had it.''
   Fallon has mesothelioma, a tumor in the lining of lungs caused
by inhalation of asbestos particles. Doctors cut out part of one
lung lining and subjected him to chemotherapy. Though they only
gave him three years to live, he's survived 10.
   Fallon is among tens of thousands of victims of ``meso,'' which
along with lung cancer and other lesser ailments are remnants of
either scientific ignorance or willful negligence by U.S. asbestos
manufacturers and users.
   He also is one of 571 plaintiffs suing Manville Corp.'s asbestos
trust fund and other companies that supplied asbestos to the
Brooklyn shipyard, where battleships such as the U.S. Missouri and
U.S. Iowa were built during World War II. If a settlement fails, a
mass trial is set for the fall.
   While lawyers haggle over the price for asbestos-related
injuries, Fallon says he simply wants fair compensation for the
pain he feels on humid days and the travel-filled retirement he was
denied.
   Fallon says he never had fair warning. From 1932, when he
learned to be a boilermaker, until retiring in 1980, no one told
him asbestos could cause diseases that now kill about 10,000 people
annually and disable thousands of others.
   Like many who handled asbestos in shipyards, on construction
sites, in chemical plants and elsewhere, Fallon believes the makers
of the insulation and building material _ and the government _
concealed its hazardous effects.
   ``I hope to get a good settlement because the last 10 years have
been wasted,'' Fallon says. ``I can't go no place. I can't do
nothing. We planned to travel. We can't go too far _ as far as
Staten Island and back.''
   ``The way I feel know I want my life back,'' he says. ``I feel
lost.''
   Fallon and his 78-year-old wife live in Bay Ridge, a
working-class neighborhood in the shadows of the Verrazano-Narrows
Bridge that links Brooklyn and Staten Island, where one of their
two daughters lives.
   Theirs was a mixed marriage _ he's Irish, she Italian; he's from
Brooklyn, she's from the Bronx. Fallon says for a while he swept up
a bar in the morning, repaired boilers during the day, and did
freelance typing with his wife at home at night.
   ``They grew up truly believing in the American dream,'' says
Fallon's daughter, Jo Ellen Falconello. ``They were betrayed, pure
and simple.''
   Fallon says he never made more than $17,000 a year, but loved
his work. The Fallons still rent a one-bedroom apartment in a
two-family house, where they have lived 20 years, for $400 a month.
Family pictures adorn the end tables; the arm chairs have plastic
seat covers.
   The couple lives on Social Security payments of $1,350 a month,
and despite his illness and her hip surgery and rapid heartbeat,
medical bills haven't been devastating. The Fallons saved about
$20,000 in their half-century together, and use the interest for
luxuries like gifts for the grandchildren.
   Fallon in 1986 rejected settlement offers totaling $2,500 from
two companies. Jury awards in some cases have exceeded $1 million,
but Fallon just wants enough to compensate for the suffering and
maybe help his family.
   ``I expected him to get older but not the way it happened. It
just cut him down,'' his daughter says. ``In a way we're very
lucky. We still have my father here. The quality of his life isn't
what it should be, but he isn't dead.''

<HEAD>Pollution Fines Upheld; Texaco Loses Appeal of Antitrust Award</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government may fine air polluters even
when federal officials are slow to decide on proposals for cleaning
up the atmosphere, the Supreme Court ruled Thursday.
   The justices voted 9-0 to uphold a lower court ruling supporting
the Enviromental Protection Agency's power to seek fines of up to
$25,000 a day against a now-closed General Motors Corp. plant in
Massachusetts.
   In a separate decision Thursday, the court barred manufacturers
from giving discounts to wholesalers and not to retailers when the
discounts are unrelated to any savings for the supplier or to the
wholesaler's costs. The decision came in a case involving a $1.35
million antitrust award Texaco Inc. was ordered to pay.
   The future impact of the pollution ruling may be limited. The
House and Senate have passed bills revising the federal Clean Air
Act that set new timetables to address the kind of problem at issue
in the GM case.
   Congress is expected to complete action on the legislation this
year.
   The case involved pollution from car paint at a GM assembly
plant in Framingham, Mass.
   Under the Clean Air Act, the EPA sets national air quality
standards. The states are required to adopt plans to meet those
standards and submit them to the federal agency.
   The EPA in 1980 approved a Massachusetts plan for reducing
pollution from paint at auto assembly factories.
   The plan required car makers to comply fully with the federal
rules by Dec. 31, 1985, but the EPA extended the deadline for
plants switching from lacquer paints to enamel, which emits less
pollutants.
   GM in June 1985 said it would convert to enamel by the summer of
1987 and sought a 20-month exemption from the Dec. 31, 1985,
standards.
   Massachusetts officials approved GM's proposal and submitted a
revised plan to the EPA on Dec. 30, 1985.
   Without waiting for federal approval, GM began building a $200
million plant in Framingham to use the enamel system while
continuing to operate its factory that uses lacquer paint.
   EPA officials went to federal court in August 1987 seeking fines
of up to $25,000 a day against GM for 20 months of air-quality
violations at the old Framingham plant.
   In September 1988, the EPA finally rejected the state-approved
pollution control system at the new plant.
   A federal judge barred the EPA from imposing fines against GM
for violations of the Dec. 31, 1985, standards. The judge said the
EPA violated the Clean Air Act by taking more than four months to
rule on the state-approved plan submitted Dec. 30, 1985.
   But the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 1988 said the EPA's
failure to meet the four-month deadline did not disqualify it from
fining companies that violate previously approved pollution control
rules.
   The appeals court ordered further lower court hearings to decide
the size of the fines.
   The Supreme Court upheld the appeals court ruling.
   GM closed the Framingham plant last year in a cost-cutting move.
   In the Texaco case, the court unanimously upheld a $1.35 million
antitrust award Texaco Inc. was ordered to pay to 12 service
stations in the Spokane, Wash., area.
   Justice John Paul Stevens, writing for the court, said there was
no evidence that Texaco's discounts ``constituted a reasonable
reimbursement for the value to Texaco of (the wholesalers')
marketing functions.''
   Business groups that supported Texaco's appeal had said a defeat
for the company could undermine ``the most common distributional
arrangement in American business: the dual channel system in which
a manufacturer or supplier sells to wholesalers at discounted
prices lower than those it charges direct purchasing retailers.''
   But the court said Texaco's discounts amounted to illegal price
discrimination barred by a federal antitrust law, the
Robinson-Patman Act.
   A federal jury ordered Texaco to pay $449,900, a sum that was
tripled by the judge to $1.35 million under the act.
   The 12 service station dealers that sued said from 1972 to 1981
they were placed at an unfair competitive disadvantage because
Texaco supplied gasoline to two Spokane-area wholesalers, John
Dompier Oil Co. and Gull Oil Co., at discounts ranging from 2.5
cents to 5.75 cents per gallon less than Texaco charged the
retailers.
   Dompier sold the gasoline to other retailers under the Texaco
trademark while Gull marketed it under private brand names.
   The 12 service stations said they suffered because at least part
of the discounts were passed on to consumers by competing retailers
who bought from the Dompier and Gull.
   Texaco argued that the discounts were legitimate because they
were available to all wholesalers who purchased from the oil comany
giant.
   Stevens noted there was evidence the services offered by the
Dompier and Gull were insubstantial and did not justify the
discount.

   NEW YORK (AM) _ The stock market edged downward today,
reflecting concerns about corporate earnings and new evidence of
economic sluggishness.
   Brokers said technology stocks were partly responsible,
suffering slips after reports of lower earnings estimates for
Digital Equipment Corp. and United Telecommunications Inc.
   Digital said external forecasts of the company's fourth-quarter
earnings were too optimistic. James Osterhoff, vice president of
finance, said the company's U.S. market continues to be sluggish,
as are certain markets overseas.
   Michael Metz, a managing director at Oppenheimer &amp; Co., said the
news triggered a round of futures-related computerized program
selling which brought down technology stocks.
   United Telecom also fell after analysts cut their earnings
estimates for the second quarter and the year.
   The market's general direction was off after the first of
several economic reports due by week's end. The producer price
index of finished goods rose 0.3 percent in May, which brokers
found disappointing but not unexpected. The report provided little
encouragement that the Fed might move soon to relax interest rates.
   The market is also approaching Friday's ``triple witching
hour,'' an event that happens four times a year on Wall Street,
when quarterly contracts to buy or sell futures and options tied to
stock indexes expire. It has been known to create sharp,
unpredictable price gyrations in stocks and can trigger heavy
trading toward the close.

   The prospect of automated off-hours trading at
the New York Stock Exchange has some Wall Streeters echoing the
sentiments of blue-collar workers displaced by machinery on the
assembly line.
   Stock brokers and trading-floor specialists said Thursday they
were confident their clients would be better served by trading
shares through the traditional NYSE methods. They were skeptical
that the plan would work using computers, rather than people on the
trading floor, to execute trades.
   Some also wondered whether there is enough business in the
middle of the night to warrant additional hours for the NYSE.
   ``If the restaurant is open all night, does that make you any
hungrier?'' one broker asked.
   On the floor of the exchange and during cigarette breaks on a
Wall Street sidewalk, some exchange workers said they were
confident customers get better service through so-called
specialists who bring buyer and seller together.
   Seeking to emphasize advantages of the current system, the
traders said specialists occassionally reach compromises between
buyers and sellers that bring the seller a higher price than
originally sought.
   ``Show me a machine that can do that,'' said one broker and
former specialist who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   ``I'm doubtful it would work, but it's a foot in the door'' for
computerized trading, said a specialist who also asked that his
name not be used. ``I have the feeling it's a Trojan horse,'' he
said, adding that an automated system likely would be introduced
during daytime hours if it is accepted at night.
   The plan to expand trading hours was first reported in The New
York Times and later confirmed through sources. A NYSE spokesman
would not confirm the report, but said the exchange has been
talking about moving to off-hours trading for two years.
   Sources who were familiar with the plan said the off-hours
trading would eventually lead to three trading sessions through the
night. Each stock would be traded once at each session, with all
trades handled at a single price.
   The Big Board hopes after-hours trading would bring back
business lost to the Tokyo and London exchanges.

<HEAD>Southland Announces Restructuring, Missed Bond Payment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Debt-ridden Southland Corp., owner of 7,000
7-Eleven convenience stores, on Thursday sweetened a deal to pay
off its bondholders in a proposal that slashes the amount of
control the founding Thompson family will have.
   The company also said Thursday it would not pay $69 million in
interest due on two bond issues Friday, a move that an analyst said
opens up the possibility of an involuntary bankruptcy petition
being filed against Southland.
   The bondholder proposal, which Southland called the second phase
in its attempt to climb out from under $1.8 billion in debt, cuts
the amount of control that the Thompson family and other existing
shareholders will have, from 15 percent of the shares in an earlier
proposal to 6.5 percent.
   The company is offering bondholders $550 million to exchange
$1.76 billion in outstanding securities. In addition, bondholders
and preferred shareholders would share 18.5 percent of the
company's common stock.
   The new offer for the bonds is about $200 million higher than an
earlier plan.
   The first phase of the restructuring, announced in March, called
for Southland's Japanese partners, Ito-Yokado Co. Ltd. and
Seven-Eleven Japan Co. Ltd., to pay $400 million cash for 75
percent of the company. But the Japanese investors agreed to hold
off consummating that deal until August 15 pending the new
restructuring scheme.
   ``Assuming an agreement can be reached over the next couple of
days, the hope is that a specific proposal would be filed with the
SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission) by about the middle of
next week,'' said John Gordon, president of Deltec Securities Corp.
of New York and head of a bondholders committee that worked out the
agreement with Southland management and others.
   Gordon said he was ``enthusiastic'' about the negotiations and
said it provided an opportunity for Southland to ``really get back
on its feet.''
   Suffering disappointing sales and earnings growth, Southland has
been strained by debt associated with its $4.9 billion leveraged
buyout in 1987, which gave Dallas' Thompson family control of the
chain.
   The company lost $69.4 million in the first quarter of this
year, and sold its Citgo subsidiary in January to raise $661.5
million in cash.
   ``I thought that their initial offer was totally unacceptable,
and in fact I would be hard-pressed to think of an offer that could
have been more unacceptable than the one they made,'' Gordon said.
   But he said he was impressed with the negotiations this week
that led to Thursday's offer.
   At least one other bondholder was not as enthusiastic.
   ``It's incredible the size of the pill that they're asking
bondholders to swallow,'' said Jay H. Lustig, head of the high
yield department for Drake Capital Securities Inc. of Santa Monica,
Calif.
   ``They're asking bondholders to forgive $1.2 billion in debt in
exchange for 18 percent of the company. They have absolutely zero
shot of getting 100 percent acceptance,'' he said.
   The missed interest payment Friday also raises the possibility
that Southland could be forced into involuntary bankruptcy if a
payment or agreement is not worked out in 30 days, Lustig said. But
Gordon said he was optimistic all parties would work out an
agreement that would sidestep such a move.

<HEAD>Gold Off Sharply; Dollar Mixed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gold prices fell sharply Thursday while the
dollar finished mostly higher in domestic dealings after putting in
a mixed performance overseas.
   Gold bullion lost about $5 a troy ounce following heavy selling
overseas. Unidentified Middle East investors were believed
responsible sending gold to a four-year low of $341 a troy ounce
before the metal recovered about half its losses in foreign trading.
   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current
delivery settled at $346.80 a troy ounce, down $5.20 from late
Wednesday. Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late bid for
gold at $345.85 an ounce, off $5.15 an ounce.
   ``All the action took place overnight,'' said Steven Pepper, a
vice president at Republic. Gold held to a very narrow range in
domestic trading, he said, but the market remained ``confused and
demoralized'' by the metal's recent volatility.
   Traders had ``thought gold could hold'' at the $350-an-ounce
level, Pepper said.
   Earlier in London, gold fell to a late bid price of $345.25 an
troy ounce from $350.15 late Wednesday. In Zurich, the metal fell
to a closing bid of $345.50 from $350.50, and in Hong Kong, gold
dropped $4.36 an ounce to close at $350.80.
   Currency trading was moderate in Europe, but interest in the
dollar was rekindled when activity shifted to the United States.
Traders attributed the dollar's advance to optimism ahead of
Friday's release of merchandise trade figures for April.
   Market players are ``expecting a very good number,'' said Bob
Morrissey, senior trader at the Bank of Boston's New York office.
The market consensus is that the Commerce Department will report a
trade deficit of about $7.2 billion, which would represent a
significant decline from March's wider-than-expected $8.45 billion
deficit.
   But Morrissey said rumors began circulating in the market that
the figure could be as good as $5 billion. In that case, he
predicted the dollar would break out of its current trading range.
   A lower dollar helps the deficit by making U.S. goods more
competitive on foreign markets, thereby increasing exports. A low
deficit would indicate that ``U.S. goods are competitive, and there
is room for the dollar to go higher,'' Morrissey said.
   Also to be released on Friday are reports on the consumer price
index and industrial production and capacity, both for May.
   Dealers said Thursday's goverment report showing U.S. wholesale
prices rose a moderate 0.3 percent in May did not provide any
surprises.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 153.53 Japanese yen, down 1.02
yen from Wednesday's finish. Later in London, the dollar was quoted
higher at 153.90 yen. In New York, the dollar closed at 154.20 yen,
down from 154.75 yen on Wednesday.
   The British pound was quoted at $1.7080 late in London, up from
$1.7070 late Wednesday. In New York, it cost $1.7080 to buy one
pound, less expensive than Wednesday's $1.7115.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Wednesday's
late rates, included: 1.6948 West German marks, up from 1.6865;
1.4355 Swiss francs, up from 1.4240; 5.7015 French francs, up from
5.6720; 1,244.50 Italian lire, up from 1,238.00; and 1.1713
Canadian dollars, down from 1.1720.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with Wednesday's
late rates, included: 1.6920 West German marks, down from 1.6925;
1.4330 Swiss francs, down from 1.4335; 5.6940 French francs, up
from 5.6880; 1.9045 Dutch guilders, unchanged; 1,242.75 Italian
lire, up from 1,241.00; and 1.1700 Canadian dollars, down from
1.1722
   Silver prices fell. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for
current delivery settled at $4.770 a troy ounce, down from $4.915
an ounce Wednesday. Earlier in London the metal settled at a bid of
$4.80 a troy ounce, down from $4.95.

   Assets of the nation's 504 money market mutual
funds rose $988.6 million in the latest week to $382.14 billion,
the Investment Company Institute said Thursday.
   The rise in the seven-day period ended Wednesday followed a
$385.1 million decline in fund assets the week earlier. The
Washington-based mutual fund trade group originally reported that
drop as $804.8 million but later revised it.
   Fund assets hit a record high $392.14 billion in the week ended
March 21, 1990.
   The institute said that in the latest week, assets of 239
general purpose funds rose $1.01 billion to $131.32 billion, assets
of 105 broker-dealer funds increased $432.5 million to $159.23
billion, and assets of 160 institutional funds fell $455.0 million
to $91.59 billion.
   The seven-day average yield on money market mutual funds fell in
the week ended Tuesday to 7.65 percent from 7.67 percent the
previous week, said Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a trade journal
based in Holliston, Mass.
   The 30-day average yield fell to 7.68 percent from 7.69 percent,
Donoghue's said.
   The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was
43 days, down from 44 days, Donoghue's said.
   The newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of 100 leading
commercial banks, savings and loan associations and savings banks
in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the effective annual
yield available on money market accounts fell to 6.19 percent as of
Wednesday from 6.20 percent a week earlier.
   The North Palm Beach, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective
annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super
NOW accounts, fell to 5.04 percent from 5.06 percent.
   Bank Rate Monitor said the effective annual yield was 7.92
percent on six-month certificates of deposit, down from 7.94
percent the previous week. Yields were 8.12 percent on 1-year CDs,
down from 8.14 percent; 8.12 percent on 2{-year CDs, down from 8.15
percent; and 8.18 percent on 5-year CDs, down from 8.22 percent.

<TEXT>
   A fourth consecutive monthly drop in energy
prices helped offset higher food costs in May and hold overall
wholesale prices to a moderate 0.3 percent increase, the government
said Thursday.
   Analysts viewed the soft increase in the Labor Department's
Producer Price Index for finished goods as encouraging news on the
inflation front, especially given last winter's huge price gains
caused by a severe cold snap. That freeze sent wholesale prices
spiraling 1.9 percent in January to a 15-year record.
   ``We're back on trend after the wiggles of December and
January,'' said Donald Ratajczak, director of economic forecasting
at Georgia State University in Atlanta.
   ``The inflationary fears that picked up in the winter months
clearly did not have a good foundation,'' Ratajczak said.
   The report should help dampen inflation worries for the Federal
Reserve, which has been under pressure to ease its
inflation-fighting campaign and lower interest rates to boost the
economy, analysts said. Still, most analysts expected no immediate
shift in the central bank's policy.
   ``The question is how long does the Fed feel it can keep the
economy subdued? They may say, `Let's keep our nose to the
grindstone on inflation and really see a payoff,''' said Robert
Dederick, chief economist at the Northern Trust Co. of Chicago.
   On Wall Street, investors took the inflation report as a
disappointing sign that the Fed would not move anytime soon to
relax interest rates. By midday, the Dow Jones average of 30
industrials had dropped 12.62, though by day's end it was down just
1.48 to 2,928.22.
   Many economists were awaiting the government's data on consumer
prices for May, due out Friday, for a better picture of the
nation's inflation situation.
   Consumer prices, up at an annual rate of 6.8 percent for the
first four months of 1990, have been rising at a steeper pace than
wholesale costs. Producer prices reflect only the cost of goods
while consumer prices are heavily influenced by the cost of
services.
   For the first five months of the year, overall inflation at the
wholesale level was running at a 4.0 percent annual rate, down from
4.8 percent for all of 1989, the government said.
   Over the past 12 months, wholesale prices have risen a modest
3.1 percent.
   ``This report shows that we are neither veering into recession
or are we in a situation where inflation is accelerating rapidly,''
said Ron Schreibman of the National Association of
Wholesaler-Distributors.
   In May, energy prices dropped 1 percent after having fallen by
even larger amounts the previous three months. Gasoline prices were
down 2.1 percent and fuel oil fell 6.2 percent. Natural gas
increased 0.9 percent.
   Food costs overall were up 0.6 percent after having declined by
that amount the previous two months.
   The price of fruit dropped 8.4 percent, vegetables fell 3.9
percent and eggs were down 21.8 percent.
   But that wasn't enough to offset increases in the price of other
foods, such as the 7.7 percent hike in the cost of pasta, 4.9
percent increase in pork and 8.8 percent rise in the cost of fish.
   Excluding the volatile food and energy sectors, prices rose a
mild 0.2 percent, the identical increase of a month before.
Economists often consider this ``core'' number a better indicator
of underlying inflationary pressures on the economy.
   Automobile prices rose 0.3 percent in May after falling the
previous two months.
   Women's and children's clothing costs were up while the price of
men's clothing fell slightly.
   The price of tobacco was up 3 percent while the cost of
household flatware, appliances and home electronic equipment fell.
   The various changes put the index for all finished goods at
117.7 in May. That means a hypothetical selection of goods that
cost $100 in 1982 cost $117.70 last month, up from $114.20 a year
earlier.
   Price pressures in earlier stages of the production process were
down in May. Intermediate goods and crude goods both fell 0.1
percent. An example of the three processing stages is bread as
finished goods, flour as the intermediate stage and wheat at the
crude level.
   The Labor Department revised the data for the first two months
of 1990, saying wholesale prices rose 1.9 percent in January rather
than the previously reported 1.8 percent. February prices fell 0.1
percent rather than holding steady. Wholesale prices also fell
slightly in March and April.

   The stock market was down slightly in quiet
trading Thursday, reflecting concern about corporate earnings and
reports on the state of the economy.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which slipped 3.72
points Wednesday, lost another 1.48 to close at 2,928.22.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 7 to 5 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
560 up, 917 down and 500 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board totaled 135.77 million
shares, down from 158.91 million in the previous session.
   The market started slowly with release of a government report
showing the producer price index rose 0.3 percent in May. Traders
said the figure was disappointing but not unexpected, and provided
little encouragement that the Federal Reserve might move soon to
relax interest rates.
   Stocks also fell after reports of lower earnings for two
technology companies, Digital Equipment Corp. and United
Telecommunications Inc.
   Digital said external forecasts of the company's fourth-quarter
earnings were too optimistic because of softness in the company's
domestic and international markets.
   Michael Metz, a managing director at Oppenheimer &amp; Co., said the
news triggered a round of futures-related computerized program
selling which brought down technology stocks.
   Digital closed down 1} to 86&rsqb;.
   United Telecom, the most heavily traded stock on the NYSE, fell
3\ to 40~ after analysts cut their earnings estimates for the
second quarter and the year.
   But the market remained relatively quiet, as some traders waited
for more economic data on Friday, including the May consumer price
index and April trade deficit figures.
   Some brokers were nervous about Friday's ``triple witching
hour,'' an event that happens four times a year on Wall Street,
when quarterly contracts to buy or sell futures and options tied to
stock indexes expire. It has been known to create sharp,
unpredictable price gyrations in stocks and can trigger heavy
trading toward the close.
   ``There's a lot of concern for tomorrow with the triple
expirations,'' said George H. Boyd III, manager of equity research
at Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co. ``It makes today a difficult day to say
whatever's happening is part of a trend. It's probably pretty
difficult to say this week is significant of a trend.''
   The Dow Jones industrial average has seesawed since peaking at
2,935.19 last Monday. It fell 72.81 points in the next four days
and then surged a cumulative 71.04 points Monday and Tuesday.
   Banking and other financial issues were generally down Thursday.
Federal National Mortgage fell ~ to 42{; Citicorp dropped { to 23&lsqb;;
Chase Manhattan slipped | to 24|; and BankAmerica slid ~ to 31&lsqb;.
   Precious metals stocks also fell, with Newmont Gold down 1{ to
36|.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 161.10 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $16.66 billion, or 0.48
percent, in value.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
1.02 to 197.98.
   Standard &amp; Poor's industrial index fell 1.65 to 424.51, and
S&amp;P's 500-stock composite index fell 2.00 at 362.90.
   The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market fell
1.76 to 467.10. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index closed at 364.30, down .74.
   Due to an NYSE closing price error on Wednesday for Chevron, the
closing average for the Dow Jones 30 industrials on Wednesday was
2,929.70, rather than 2929.95, as reported earlier.

<HEAD>Boeing Will Lose Money Again This Year On Defense Business,
Chairman Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Boeing Co., whose commercial airplane orders
helped it report an 87 percent jump in its first-quarter profit,
will lose money this year on its military business, the company's
chairman said.
   On the heels of a 1989 deficit of $559 million for its military
business, the outlook is dim.
   ``I won't speculate on which of our military programs will
ultimately be canceled or scaled back, but a number of them are
clearly vulnerable,'' Frank Shrontz, Boeing's chairman and chief
executive officer, told an investment conference Tuesday.
   Nonetheless, Boeing remains committed to the defense and space
business, Shrontz said. The Seattle-based company hopes to be able
to continue to pull in about $5 billion in defense sales annually.
   On the commercial side, Shrontz projected that Boeing's share of
$600 billion worth of world airplane sales over the next 15 years
will keep the company's production lines busy.
   Boeing has a commercial-order backlog approaching $100 billion.
   Boeing earned $302 million, or $1.31 a share, on sales of $6.4
billion for the first three months of 1990, compared with a profit
of $161 million, or 70 cents a share, on sales of $4 billion in the
first quarter of 1989.

   Domestic advertising spending is expected to
rise 7.5 percent to $140 billion in 1991 following this year's
disappointing results, which will be hampered by weak local ad
budgets, a prominent forecaster said Thursday.
   Robert J. Coen, who heads the forecasting unit at the
advertising agency McCann-Erickson, reduced his earlier projections
for this year to a 5.3 percent gain, or a total of $130.4 billion,
from the 6.2 percent gain he estimated in December.
   In a semi-annual report on ad spending, Coen said ``the economic
indicators have not been very good since the fall of 1989, and they
are the cause of most of the slowdown in ad spending.''
   He blamed sluggish retail spending and poor retailer profits for
depressing the local advertising market this year. Local ad
revenues are expected to increase just 4.7 percent this year _ to
$57.54 billion _ instead of the 6.2 percent gain he forecast six
months ago.
   Local advertising is concentrated heavily in newspapers and
local television stations, both of which had poor ad sales in the
first quarter of the year.
   In newspapers, total ad revenue was off 1.3 percent in the first
quarter. A 2.7 percent gain in retail advertising was unable to
offset a 6.4 percent decline in classified ad spending.
   At local television stations, ad spending by local car dealers
slumped 21 percent in the first quarter, while bank and department
store ad expenditures fell by 14 percent and 13 percent,
respectively.
   Coen noted in the report, however, that the advertising budgets
of many major brands have risen significantly on a national level
this year. He predicts a 6.3 percent gain in national ad spending,
to $73.85 billion this year, in line the projections he issued in
December.
   Syndicated television ad revenues were up a sharp 31 percent
during the first four months of the year, while national ads on
cable television stations were up 17 percent in the period.
   The three major television networks had an average 11 percent
gain in national ad spending through April when compared with the
year-ago period. During the first quarter, spending on advertising
food products on network TV jumped 18 percent, toiletries ads rose
15 percent and drugs and personal care products were up 14 percent.
   Fewer ads for cigarettes and cars kept magazine advertising
revenue up only 1 percent. Revenue from national ads in newspapers
was up 5.4 percent in the first quarter.
   For the remainder of the year, Coen predicted, national
marketing budgets will continue outpacing local advertising
budgets. But in a sluggish economy, it will be ``a tough ad sales
year for many media,'' his report said.
   If Coen's 7.5 percent growth estimate for 1991 is accurate, it
would mark the largest gain since 1988, when domestic ad spending
was up 7.7 percent over the previous year.
   While double-digit gains in ad spending have been reported
overseas as recently as 1988, domestic ad spending has not improved
by double-digit margins since 1984, when a 15.8 percent increase
was reported. Still, Coen's projection marks a roughly $38 billion
increase in ad spending since 1986, the first year domestic ad
spending rose above the $100 billion mark.
   The outlook for advertising growth overseas this year is
expected to rise 5 percent over 1989 levels to $133.8 billion, when
taking into account a stronger dollar.
   Total worldwide ad expenditures are expected to reach $264.2
billion this year, up 5.1 percent from last year. Though worldwide
ad growth averaged just 5 percent last year, off from three years
of double-digit growth, Coen predicted worldwide spending will
``begin to pick up steam in 1991, fueled by the expansion in free
market economies and growing competition in consumer markets.''

<HEAD>Saudi Selling Presses Gold Below $350; Silver Hits 12-Year Low</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   A new round of Saudi Arabian selling pressed gold futures prices
below $350 an ounce Thursday for the first time in nearly four
years and triggered a sympathetic sell-off in the silver market,
where prices plunged to 12{-year lows.
   Steep losses also were posted in futures prices for many other
commodities including soybeans, hogs, pork bellies, coffee, sugar
and cocoa. Near-term crude oil futures likewise fell but other
energy futures as a whole were mixed.
   In the second straight day of heavy selling pressure on New
York's Commodity Exchange, gold futurs settled $5.20 to $6.10 lower
with the contract for delivery in June at $346.80 a troy ounce, the
lowest daily finish for a Comex gold contract since July 14, 1986.
   Silver futures ended 14.5 cents to 17.1 cents lower with June at
$4.77 a troy ounce, the lowest close since Dec. 27, 1977.
   For the fourth time in the past three months, the gold market's
plunge was precipitated by large sales of gold bullion in London by
Saudi interests, analysts said.
   The $40-an-ounce drop in gold prices that began with the first
bout of Saudi selling on March 26 has quashed investor interest in
precious metals, said William O'Neill of Merrill Lynch Futures.
   ``Gold is a market that greatly deals in psychology,'' O'Neill
said. ``The market psychology is so negative right now that it
would take something of a very significant nature to change the
scenario.''
   O'Neill said the possibility of further heavy bullion sales by
the Saudis or by gold-producing countries such as South Africa and
the Soviet Union, which have also been large sellers lately, make a
drop to $325 an ounce a not-unlikely prospect.
   ``There's no reason to assume it's over,'' added analyst Bette
Raptopoulos of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   In other commodities, soybean futures fell sharply on the
Chicago Board of Trade, mimicking the previous day's action in the
corn market amid forecasts for a month of ideal growing conditions
in the Midwest. Grain futures also closed lower across the board.
   Bearish chart signals also figured in the decline, as did
Wednesday's steep drop in corn futures prices, said Anne Frick,
senior oil seed analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
   ``I think beans are very cognizant of movement in corn,'' she
said.
   Wheat futures settled 1{ cents to 2 cents lower with July at
$3.32} a bushel; corn was 1{ cents to 3\ cents lower with July at
$2.87 a bushel; oats were 2} cents to 5 cents lower with July at
$1.41 a bushel; soybeans were 13{ cents to 15\ cents lower with
July at $5.91\ a bushel.
   Near-term hog and pork-belly futures plummeted their respective
daily limits of 1.5 cents and 2 cents a pound on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange, pressured by sluggish demand for pork products
and weak technical signals.
   The selling interest spilled over into the adjacent cattle pits,
where prices finished moderately lower.
   Live cattle futures settled .10 cent to .50 cent lower with June
at 76.67 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .25 cent
lower with August at 84.72 cents a pound; live hogs were .80 cent
to 1.5 cents lower with June at 62.67 cents a pound; frozen pork
bellies were 1.3 cents to 2 cents lower with July at 68.45 cents a
pound.
   Prices also tumbled on New York's Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa
Exchange, on a combination of technical sell signals, signs of
greater-than-expected supplies and selling to raise money for
margin calls on other markets, analysts said.
   Coffee futures plunged 3.35 cents to 4.7 cents with July
settling at 87.10 cents a pound; sugar finished .50 cent to .67
cent lower with July at 12.25 cents a pound; cocoa was $27 to $31
lower with July at $1,191 per ton.
   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate
crude oil settled .45 cent lower to .17 cent higher with July at
$17.13 a barrel; heating oil was .07 cent to .60 cent lower with
July at 48.50 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .45 cent lower
to 1.27 cents higher with July at 60.12 cents a gallon.

<HEAD>S&amp;P Lowers Chrysler, Ford Credit Ratings</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Standard &amp; Poor's Ratings Group on Thursday
downgraded its credit ranking for Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler
Corp., signaling sagging faith in the auto industry's finances.
   Another major Wall Street credit rating company, Moody's
Investor Services Inc., said it would decide by the end of the
month whether it would change Chrysler's rating.
   The ratings reflect how Wall Street views the credit worthiness
of companies and their subsidiaries. Lower ratings generally mean
companies must pay higher interest to borrow in the credit markets.
   S&amp;P dropped Ford one notch to ``double-A-minus,'' from
``double-A,'' considered a high level of investment grade
securities. Chrysler fell to S&amp;P's lowest investment-grade level of
``triple-B-minus'' from ``triple-B.''
   S&amp;P Vice President Scott Sprinzen and Moody's credit rating
Chairman Harold Goldberg stated separately that Chrysler's main
profit-makers, its minivans and Jeeps, were coming under direct
attack by competitors.
   ``The company (Chrysler) will require substantial spending in
the next several years to position themselves in a broader array of
products and to be a more effective competitor,'' Goldberg said
Thursday.
   S&amp;P also said Ford is boosting new product spending, which will
delay debt reduction in connection with its recent acquisitions of
The Associates Corp. consumer finance concern and Jaguar PLC, the
British luxury automaker. The two acquisitions cost Ford nearly $6
billion.
   Ford reported first-quarter earnings of $506.2 million, down 70
percent from a year ago.
   Ford spokesman Tom Foote said the company was disappointed with
the S&amp;P decision, saying the company's balance sheet is strong
``and we expect our investments to lead to further strengthening of
our financial situation.''
   Chrysler spokesman Tom Houston said S&amp;P's action was unwarranted.
   ``Moreover, Chrysler also notes that just recently the market
readily accepted the landmark offering of $1.1 billion, 30-year
Auburn Hills Trust certificates, thereby expressing high confidence
in the company over a very long term,'' Houston said.
   In April, Chrysler announced that it would sell its
yet-to-be-completed technical center in Auburn Hills, north of
Detroit, through 30-year certificates and then lease it back. The
deal was expected to raise nearly $800 million.
   Chrysler shares fell 25 cents to $15.62{, Ford was unchanged at
$46.37| and General Motors Corp. was down 37{ cents at $49.62{ in
Thursday trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
   S&amp;P said GM also was coming under competitive pressure. But the
giant automaker was better suited than Ford and Chrysler to
withstand it and a reassessment of its credit quality was not
warranted, Sprinzen said.
   On Wednesday, Chrysler called Moody's review announcement
inappropriate and unwarranted.
   ``Chrysler believes that its first-quarter profitability was
impressive given the massive reduction in dealer inventories and
points out that the company's $1.5-billion ongoing cost-cutting
program contributed substantially to those results,'' Chrysler
stated Wednesday.
   Chrysler reported $71 million in profit during the first
quarter, down 80 percent from a year ago, but better than what many
analysts had expected. The earnings came despite huge incentive
costs in January, when the company offered a $1,000 rebate on its
popular minivans.
   The Big Three offered larger incentive packages and temporarily
shut down factories in January to shrink new-car inventories. The
strategy worked and since the first of the year, the companies have
been trimming incentives.
   New minivans and sport-utility vehicles that other automakers
are beginning to sell are pointed directly at Chrysler's popular
minivans and Jeeps.
   Chrysler said Wednesday it had sold 752,935 North American-made
cars and trucks through June 10 this year, down 13 percent from
last year. The company's share of the U.S. car market was 11.4
percent, down from 13.1 percent a year ago, and its portion of the
truck market dropped to 21.8 percent this year from 23.2 percent
last year.
   Moody's also is concerned about the recent drain of top
executives from Chrysler, Goldberg said.
   In the past six weeks, Gerald Greenwald quit as vice chairman to
head a $4.54-billion union bid to buy United Airlines and Michael
Hammes left as vice president for international operations to run
Black &amp; Decker Corp.'s huge toolmaking operations. Chrysler Motors
Chairman Bennett Bidwell said he will retire by 1991 and Treasurer
Frederick Zuckerman has said he will leave this summer.

   Contel Corp. said Thursday it is offering early
retirement to about 900 employees as part of a previously announced
cost-cutting program.
   The telecommunications company said it was launching the
retirement program to avoid layoffs while reducing the workforce.
   Under the plan, a retirement ``window'' will be created in July,
during which retiring employees will receive three years toward
their ages and three years toward their service dates in
determining individual benefits.
   The program will be offered to employees 52 and older who have
at least seven years of service with the company as of Dec. 30, and
are in job classifications and locations that may be affected by
the restructuring of the Telephone Operations Sector.
   Contel said in April it was starting a two-year restructuring to
make the sector more efficient, market-focused and responsive to
consumers. The restructuring is expected to reduce the workforce by
4 percent and result in up to $25 million in pre-tax costs.

<HEAD>EFTA Ready For Negotiations With The European Community, Leader
Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>GOTEBORG, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Foreign trade ministers of the six West
European nations comprising the European Free Trade Association put
final touches Wednesday on a joint platform that could provide the
base for close cooperation with the European Community.
   ``We are ready to proceed with formal negotiations (with the EC)
without delay,'' said the European Free Trade Association's current
chairman, the Swedish Minister of Foreign Trade, Anita Gradin.
   The ministers of EFTA also signed a declaration of cooperation
with government representatives of Czechoslovakia, Hungary and
Poland.
   The declaration aims at improving the conditions for free trade
between the three countries and the EFTA nations: Austria, Finland,
Iceland, Norway, Sweden and Switzerland. Steps include reducing
technical barriers to free trade and promotion of trade via
seminars and exhibitions.
   ``Free trade requires market economies, convertible currencies,
political pluralism ... it will take time,'' said Hansjorg Reng, an
EFTA official.
   He said Israel, Turkey, the Gulf states and other Eastern
European countries had shown interest in similar cooperation
declarations with EFTA.
   The EFTA delegates are seeking ways to make their nations part
of a united Europe without compromising their sovereignty.
   Gradin told reporters the EFTA nations are ``in no doubt in a
position to speak with one voice'' after the talks in Goteborg.
   She said delegates had trimmed a list of ``fundamental
interests'' in which EFTA members want to be exempted from EC
regulations to a dozen. They include areas where EFTA standards are
higher, such as in health, safety and environmental matters, she
said.
   ``We are not prepared to lower our standards ... but I am sure
we can find solutions,'' she said.
   The formula for the envisioned close cooperation between the EC
and EFTA is called the European Economic Space. As envisioned,
agreement on the plan would lead to a free flow of goods, labor,
services and capital among 350 million people in 18 west European
countries. The EC has 12 member states.

<HEAD>Cholesterol-Free Milk to Hit The Market Monday</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC RICE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DECATUR, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Georgia dairy on Thursday introduced a
cholesterol-free milk product that uses vegetable fat in place of
animal fat.
   Officials at Mathis Dairy touted the new drink as safe for the
millions of people who can't drink milk because of medically
restricted diets.
   The drink, which is not technically milk because it contains no
milkfat, is targeted at a limited market and will cost about 30
cents more per half-gallon than regular milk, dairy officials said.
It is the latest bid by the dairy industry to make its products
more appealing to health-conscious consumers.
   ``We're excited as to what this could mean to the dairy industry
as a whole,'' said Jack Mathis, dairy vice president.
   The product, to go on sale around Atlanta Monday, will be
introduced elsewhere depending on its success. Mathis said he
expected other dairies, some of which already have low-cholesterol
milks on the market, to develop similar products.
   Mathis said the new product, called Mathis@Sun-up, is a joint
venture with Sun Up Farms Inc., a smaller Atlanta dairy that
developed the drink. It has been served to 8,000 people in taste
tests over the last six months with overwhelmingly positive
results, he said.
   Joe DiBruno of Sun Up Farms said the technology for making a
cholesterol-free milk has existed for years. But he said his is the
first one that avoids the watery taste common to skim milks, which
contain a tiny amount of fat and cholesterol.
   Though Mathis@Sun-up is believed to be the first
cholesterol-free milk to hit the market, researchers in Peoria,
Ill., reported last year they had developed a concentrated milk
that is low in fat and free of cholesterol and also uses vegetable
oils.
   DiBruno said the new product is made in a manner similar to
standard lowfat milks. Whole milk, which contains 3.5 percent
milkfat, is funneled through a clarifier, which removes the fat.
But instead of the normal practice of putting back measured amounts
of milkfat, a soybean-based vegetable fat is mixed in.
   The resulting drink, which contains 2 percent vegetable fat, has
a texture and taste similar to regular 2 percent lowfat milk. It
has 120 calories per serving, same as 2 percent lowfat milk, and
has a similar vitamin content, DiBruno said.
   Americans consume about 6.2 billion gallons of milk a year,
although sales of whole milk have declined sharply since 1971,
according to the Agriculture Department.

<TEXT>
   The Bush administration, worried about a lack
of progress in trade talks with Japan, insisted Thursday that the
Japanese honor commitments to open markets to American and other
foreign goods.
   U.S. negotiators have grown concerned over what they perceive as
Japanese foot-dragging in the talks, aimed at reducing the United
States' $49 billion trade deficit with Japan.
   Critics have said Japan's intransigence is directly linked to a
decision by the Bush administration to remove Japan from under a
tough section of trade law known as Super 301, which carries the
threat of economic sanctions.
   Recent negotiations in Hawaii produced little progress in
writing the text of a final report on negotiations aimed at
altering the economies of both countries as a way of attacking the
underlying reasons for the huge trade imbalance.
   Japan and the United States signed an interim agreement on the
talks, known as the Structural Impediments Initiative, in April and
face a deadline of early July for producing a final report.
   However, in several key areas, the Japanese are refusing to make
commitments sought by U.S. negotiators.
   ``As we go from the interim report to the final report, we want
to keep the pressure on to make sure that all the commitments make
it through into that final report,'' White House Press Secretary
Marlin Fitzwater told reporters.
   Fitzwater downplayed reports that administration officials
believed the Japanese side was stonewalling now that the threat of
economic sanctions under Super 301 was no longer present.
   But Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher refused to dismiss the
possibility that Japan was using a stonewalling technique in the
current negotiations.
   ``I hope for all our sakes they are just testing us to see if we
have lost any of our resolve,'' Mosbacher said when asked about the
talks during a congressional hearing. ``They did take some very
good first steps but they have got a lot farther to go, as we do.''
   Two other senior administration officials, briefing reporters on
condition that their names not be used, expressed clear
disappointment Thursday with the lack of progress.
   ``It would be highly regrettable that if, at this stage, this
process lost momentum and reversed itself,'' one official said. He
said he believed there had been a reduced level of involvement by
senior Japanese officials in the process.
   The U.S.-Japan trade talks were stalemated earlier this year
before a hastily arranged summit meeting between Japanese Prime
Minister Toshiki Kaifu and President Bush got the negotiations back
on track.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III is scheduled to meet
Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Nakayama in San Francisco on Friday
and the administration is hoping those discussions will break the
current stalemate.
   Japanese officials have insisted that they have gone as far as
they can go with the commitments made in the April report, while
the U.S. is characterizing the April report as only a ``way
station,'' with much more concrete language needed to carry out the
vague promises.
   The next round of talks on structural barriers is scheduled for
June 25-26 in Tokyo, with the final report due before the economic
summit meeting in Houston on July 9.
   If not cleared up beforehand, a trade fight between the United
States and Japan would cast a pall over the annual economic summit
of the world's seven richest industrial countries.
   In the April report, Japan promised to open its retailing
system, boost spending on public works projects, strengthen
antitrust legislation and loosen restrictions on foreign
investment, all in an effort to expand opportunities for foreign
companies to do business in Japan.
   The United States pledged to cut the federal budget deficit and
take measures to increase savings and investment, all proposals
economists agree are needed to reduce Americans' appetite for
foreign goods.
   The new Japanese negotiating stance has not gone unnoticed in
Congress, where lawmakers were upset by the administration's
refusal to rename Japan to a Super 301 ``hit list'' as a way of
keeping pressure on the Japanese to open their markets.
   Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., warned the administration this week
that Congress ``may have no choice'' but to respond with
retaliatory legislation of its own if Japan is not more forthcoming.

<HEAD>UAW-Big Three Talks Open 3rd Week of July</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The United Auto Workers and the nation's Big
Three automakers will begin contract negotiations in the third week
of July for about 500,000 workers, the union said Wednesday.
   Company spokesmen who declined to be identified said tentative
dates for the beginning of talks were July 18 at General Motors
Corp., July 19 at Ford Motor Co. and July 20 at Chrysler Corp.
   A UAW spokesman, who also refused to be identified, confirmed
those dates.
   Contracts between the union and each of the Big Three expire
Sept. 14, the first time in 11 years the three contracts have had
common expiration dates.
   In Canada, talks between the three companies and the Canadian
Auto Workers union are expected to get under way the following
week. Those agreements also expire Sept. 14.
   The UAW has set job security as its top priority in the
negotiations. Other issues include wages, pension improvements,
health care and more responsive management.
   The opening of talks is largely ceremonial, with dozens of
people packed into the main negotiating room at each of the U.S.
automakers' headquarters. UAW President Owen Bieber and chief
negotiators for the companies shake hands across a huge table.
   Much of the bargaining takes place in subcommittees that focus
on specific areas of the contracts. Economic matters usually are
among the last negotiated.
   An hourly worker on an assembly line now makes about $15.75 an
hour.
   Traditionally, as the deadline draws near, the UAW selects a
``target'' company on which to focus efforts and suspends talks at
the other two. Terms of an agreement at the target company, called
a pattern contract, then are modified slightly and brought to the
other two.
   This year, Chrysler labor Vice President Anthony St. John has
hinted that the financially struggling company may break from the
pattern.

   The two broadest measures of the nation's money
supply rose in the week ended June 4, the Federal Reserve Board
reported Thursday.
   The Fed said the measure known as M2 rose to a seasonally
adjusted $3,263.9 billion from a revised $3,259.4 billion the
previous week.
   An even broader measure, M3, rose to a seasonally adjusted
$4,057.3 billion from a revised $4,050.5 billion.
   The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, rose to a
seasonally adjusted $808.2 billion from a revised $803.9 billion.
   M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts
and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings
deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid
accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations
of $100,000.
   In judging its monetary policy, the Fed has indicated it is
monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the
difference between short- and long-term interest rates. It also has
shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply
measures.
   The annual growth rate in M2 so far this year is 4.1 percent,
which is within the Fed's target range of 3 percent to 7 percent.
The annual growth rate in M3 was 1.5 percent, which is below the
Fed's target range of 2.5 percent to 6.5 percent. The Fed has not
set a target for M1 growth since early 1987.
   For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $3,268.1 billion, a 3.9
percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous
13 weeks. M3 averaged $4,062.0 billion, up 1.2 percent, while M1
rose 4.1 percent to an average of $805.8 billion.
   In other reports:
   _The Federal Reserve said bank borrowings from the Federal
Reserve System at the discount window, excluding extended credit,
averaged $1.021 billion a day in the week ended Wednesday, up from
$442 million the previous week.
   _The Federal Reserve said net borrowed reserves averaged $384
million in the two weeks ended June 13, compared with free reserves
of $390 million in the previous two-week period.
   _The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis reported that the
monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank
reserves held at Federal Reserve banks and cash in bank vaults and
in circulation, was $306.4 billion in the two-week period ended
June 13, up from $304.9 billion two weeks earlier.

   as president as he did on the campaign trail when he sought the
presidency in 1988,'' said Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell,
D-Maine.
   ``There simply are not the votes available to us to frustrate
passage,'' said an opponent, Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss. ``We
concede the Senate's will is to pass this bill.''
   Business groups opposed the bill, and their lobbyists said some
senators who opposed it wanted to avoid a recorded vote and were
acting in hopes that Bush would veto it and that the House would
sustain that veto before the Senate had to vote.
   If it turns out that way, senators would not have to go on the
record on the issue. A vote in either House to sustain a veto kills
the bill. The Constitution requires votes on overriding vetoes to
be by roll call.
   The bill requires business and government employers to provide
workers with up to 12 weeks of unpaid medical leave or leave for
the care of a new child or an ill child, parent or spouse.
   It exempts businesses with fewer than 50 workers, and workers
who are the highest-paid 10 percent within a company.
   Employers would have to continue health insurance benefits for
those on leave and restore returning employees to their previous
jobs or equivalent positions.
   ``Thanks to the leaders, both the majority and minority leaders,
a decision was made not to contest the matter and to pass the
bill,'' said its sponsor, Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn. ``I've
learned long ago you don't argue about a victory when you get one.
I'm also also convinced that had it come to a (recorded) vote we
would have prevailed.''
   Dodd argued in brief debate a day earlier that the job-protected
leave was a minimum guarantee any worker should receive.
   ``The bottom line is this: American parents ought to be able to
have jobs and their families as well,'' Dodd said. ``Parents ought
to be able to deal with a rare family crisis without losing those
jobs.''
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, opposed the bill, saying he favored
leave for workers but opposed a federal requirement that employers
offer it.
   ``I don't want to see anybody fired because they have a baby, or
an adoption ... or a serious illness in the family,'' Hatch said.
``I think we could come up with a way to give business incentives
to do this, but I don't think we should force them.''
   Business association representatives met with White House chief
of staff John Sununu May 7 and said he promised them Bush would
veto the bill.
   In the House, opponents argued in long debate that the bill
would be costly, a bad precedent and burdensome for businesses,
ultimately hurting American competitiveness. Supporters said nearly
all industrialized nations already provide such minimum job
security to workers, however, and many have provisions for full or
partial pay.
   The bill's sponsors said it would cost virtually nothing for
employers, while opponents charged it would carry additional costs
for training, temporary employees and overtime.
   The bill would cover federal employees, with even more generous
leave provisions. It would cover House employees but not employees
of the Senate.

   Here are brief details about the New York Stock
Exchange's plan for after-hours stock trading and an explanation of
the current system.
   The exchange has been presenting the ideas to Wall Street
brokerage firms recently. Exchange Chairman John J. Phelan Jr. on
Thursday confirmed plans for a five-step program to phase in
after-hours trading, perhaps leading to 24-hour trading by the year
2000.

<HEAD>CURRENT SYSTEM</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The NYSE is open from 9:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. Eastern time. Stocks
of U.S. and foreign companies comprise the 1,700 listed on the
exchange.
   Trades are entered either manually or electronically on the
exchange floor. Specialists on the floor ``make markets'' for
individual stocks by matching buyers with sellers and generate
action in less heavily traded stocks.
   Brokers who take orders at banks of yellow telephones on the
floor often trade with other brokers at a stock's post; in those
cases specialists serve as traffic cops, making sure the trade is
properly recorded.
   If there is no buyer or seller, the specialist records the order
and awaits a corresponding transaction. Or, the specialist will
step in and complete the trade in order to keep the market active.

<HEAD>AFTER-THE-CLOSE TRADING</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   In the first stage, the NYSE would hold two 15- to 45-minute
sessions after the market closes in an attempt to recapture some
trading currently lost to the London Stock Exchange. That activity
mainly involves program trading and other techniques typically not
used by small investors.
   One session would allow traders to trade stocks at the day's
closing prices and the other would let them disclose their own
trades. Both practices could help program traders complete
transactions. Such trades now often are completed in London or via
independent electronic trading services.

<HEAD>NIGHT TRADING</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   Sometime in 1991, the NYSE would begin holding auctions of each
listed stock at 8 p.m., midnight, and 5 a.m. Eastern time. The
stocks would trade once at each auction, with trades combined at
one agreed-upon price for each issue traded.
   Brokers could enter electronic orders for stocks at their
offices in the evening in New York, as the trading day begins in
Tokyo. They would be able to see what other orders had been placed
and alter their own.
   At 8 p.m., the exchange would pair off as many orders as
possible in one huge trade that could involve millions of shares
and hundreds of buyers and sellers. The process would be repeated
at midnight and 5 a.m., when the London market opens.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>LATER STAGES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
   The plan calls for moving at some stage to a form of
conventional trading overnight, leading finally to round-the-clock
trading. Exchange officials didn't give details about the later
stages, although Phelan said 24-hour trading could be in place by
the year 2000.
