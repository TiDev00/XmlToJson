<HEAD>CNN Official: CNN and CBS to Share Berlin News Bureau</HEAD>

   In a cost-saving experiment that may be tried
elsewhere overseas, Cable News Network and CBS News will share a
bureau and satellite equipment in Berlin, a CNN official said
Friday.
   The test will start in mid-June and is a ``a limited
experiment'' in which the two organizations will maintain separate
news correspondents and producers, said Ed Turner, executive vice
president of CNN.
   Turner's comments came during a telephone interview about the
upcoming 10th anniversary of CNN.
   CBS News officials would not comment on the unique sharing of
office space with a still-growing cable rival. ``We have no
announcement to make,'' said CBS spokesman Tom Goodman.
   The Berlin bureau arrangement marks the second deal between CBS
and a company owned by Atlanta cable tycoon Ted Turner, who
unsuccessfully tried to buy CBS in 1986.
   Last September, Turner Network Television announced a $50
million contract with CBS that lets TNT show 50 hours of coverage
from the 1992 and 1994 Winter Olympics. CBS owns the U.S.
television rights to those Games.
   The CNN-CBS News arrangement in Berlin is ``really more symbolic
than anything else,'' said Ed Turner, who is not related to CNN's
owner.
   What is unusual about it is two rival TV news organizations
``cohabiting under the same roof and sharing a (satellite) feed
point and saving each other a little money,'' he said. ``And we'll
see where it goes from there.''
   Asked if there might be similar CBS-CNN arrangements elsewhere
overseas, Turner replied that ``we're looking at some, but right
now there's nothing to talk about.''
   The cost-saving effort comes at a time that all the major
networks are trying to find ways to reduce or share costs of news
coverage overseas.
   Several years ago, NBC bought nearly 38 percent of Visnews, a
London-based overseas TV news service. Visnews' majority owner is
the Reuters news company, but the British Broadcasting Corp. also
owns an 11.25 percent interest.
   NBC and Visnews recently began sharing the same office in
Moscow, and the BBC uses NBC's satellite equipment there to
transmit stories to London, NBC said.
   ABC owns 45 percent of another London-based overseas TV news
service, Worldwide Television News. Subscribers to the service
include ABC News, CBS News and CNN.

   Gov. Gaston Caperton and Wheeling
Symphony conductor Rachael Worby were married Friday evening in the
walled back yard of the governor's mansion.
   A handful of close relatives and friends attended the wedding,
the second trip to the altar for both bride and groom.
   Bill Drennen, commissioner of culture and history who holds a $2
license from the Universal Life Church, performed the ceremony.
Caperton and Worby wrote their own vows, Drennen said.
   Caperton, 50, wore a blue suit. Worby, 41, wore a white linen
suit.
   The couple took members of the media on a whirlwind tour of the
mansion, but reporters were scooted out before the ceremony.
   Worby said she felt ``terrific.''
   Caperton said, ``I'm not nervous, really, I don't think.''
   ``I've never seen her look so beautiful,'' he said.
   As they admired their white wedding cake, Caperton told
reporters, ``Rachael got up very early this morning to bake it.''
   ``This is a very special day for us and we say thank you for
everybody who's been so supportive,'' he said.
   The couple planned to stay in Charleston on Saturday for the
Vandalia Gathering, an annual state festival at the Capitol, then
head to The Greenbrier luxury resort for a brief honeymoon.
   They very nearly missed their wedding date, arriving at the
Kanawha County clerk's office at 4 p.m. Friday to get the marriage
license.
   ``I forgot about having to get it,'' the governor said.
   A judge waived the three-day waiting period required by state
law.
   Caperton and his wife of 23 years were divorced last year. Worby
and her husband of a year-and-a-half also were divorced last year.

<HEAD>Former Mental Patient Committed in Slayings of Studio Guards</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A former mental patient was found innocent by
reason of insanity Friday of fatally shooting two Universal Studios
guards who refused to let him see actor Michael Landon.
   Nathan Nicholas Trupp acknowledged that he killed guards Jeren
Beeks, 27, and Armando Torres, 18, at a studio gate Dec. 1, 1988,
but he has never offered a coherent explanation.
   Superior Court Judge Clarence A. Stromwell declared Trupp
innocent by reason of insanity and committed him to a state mental
hospital in a plea bargain with prosecutors, who said Trupp could
be institutionalized for the rest of his life.
   Trupp, 43, said he understood the terms of his plea, but was not
asked if he knew why he had committed the murders.
   Trupp was sought by New Mexico authorities for questioning in
the slayings of three people in Albuquerque a few days before he
went to Universal in search of Landon.
   Prosecutors have said Trupp went on the Universal Studio Tour,
then returned to the gate asking to see Landon, who was then
starring in the ``Highway to Heaven'' television series.
   When guards refused him entry and would not let him use their
telephone to call Landon, Trupp left, then returned with a handgun
and shot them.
   As the slender, bearded Trupp entered his pleas, families of the
two victims sat sobbing in the courtroom. Two of them said outside
they were pleased that Trupp was now unable to harm anyone else.
   Deputy District Attorney Sterling Norris asked Trupp if he
understood that ``you may be held in the hospital for the rest of
your life.''
   ``Yes,'' Trupp answered quietly.
   Norris noted that Trupp can periodically apply for release but
suggested that the sentence is the equivalent of life in prison.
   He said his office and New Mexico authorities would oppose any
effort to free Trupp.
   New Mexico authorities were consulted about the plea bargain,
Norris told reporters. He said they would not proceed with
prosecution of Trupp for the slayings of three people in an
Albuquerque bagel shop Nov. 29, 1988.
   Trupp had said in the past he believed that those he killed were
Nazis.
   Trupp's public defender, Steven Hobson, said outside court that
Trupp, who is Jewish and spent time in Israel in his youth, remains
obsessed with Nazis and says he hears voices as well as God telling
him to do things.

<HEAD>Vacationing President Signs Central American Aid Bill</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: INSERTS 6th graf: ``The president,'' quote from Bush

   President Bush began a pre-summit
vacation Friday by signing into law an aid package for Panama and
Nicaragua swollen by tens of millions of dollars worth of pet
projects for members of Congress.
   The measure provides $420 million for Panama, which is
rebuilding after U.S. economic sanctions and an invasion of
American forces last December to topple Manuel Antonio Noriega from
power.
   Nicaragua's new government, led by U.S.-backed President Violeta
Chamorro, will receive $300 million.
   Overall, the spending measure provides $4.4 billion in domestic
spending and foreign assistance. The administration's high priority
on winning aid for Panama and Nicaragua led Bush to swallow
pork-barrel spending added by Congress.
   The measure was flown to Bush's seaside Maine compound for his
signature, and a White House statement said Bush signed it Friday
night.
   The president said in a written statement he regretted that
``Congress has used this important legislation to enact many
special interest provisions that are not in response to dire
emergencies.''
   Bush was greeted by sunny skies as he arrived for four days of
golf and boating before next week's summit with Soviet President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   Bush, in an interview released Friday, called Gorbachev ``a
strong Soviet leader, clearly in charge, with whom we have a lot of
business items.''
   ``And they range from contentious ones like the Lithuania
problem to more reconcilable problems like arms control and to some
other difficult ones like a post-German unification Europe,'' said
Bush.
   The interview was conducted Thursday with a French television
station.
   Asked if Gorbachev was having difficulty with military leaders
in his country, Bush said, ``I don't think we know that, but that's
certainly a concern, but ... I gather he's in pretty strong control
now but facing enormous problems. But it's not my role to figure
out whether Gorbachev is having a problem with his left or his
right; it's mine to deal with what's on the table.''
   There was no indication Bush would spend much of the weekend
honing up for the superpower meeting beginning Thursday, although
he did bring along a briefing book.
   No special briefings were planned and most of his top aides
remained in Washington, including chief of staff John Sununu,
national security adviser Brent Scowcroft and even press secretary
Marlin Fitzwater, who accompanies Bush on virtually every trip.
   Weekend guests for Bush and his wife Barbara included
Transportation Secretary Samuel Skinner and his wife, Honey, and
Houston friends Charles and Sally Neblett. Also joining Bush on the
Air Force One flight were his son, Marvin, his wife, Margaret and
their children Marshall and Walker.
   Bush and Skinner began the weekend on a golf course, and the
president said he hoped to finish 18 holes in a speedy two hours
and then go fishing. ``Got to get out, the mackerels are running
out to sea,'' said Bush.
   Before leaving Washington, Bush called Mrs. Chamorro and
Panamanian President Guillermo Endara to tell them Congress had
approved their aid package.
   Stephen Hart, White House deputy press secretary, said the
leaders called the aid ``a major step forward in solidifying and
supporting the growth of democracy in Panama and Nicaragua.''
   Bush expressed ``the continued U.S. desire for close relations
and for the continued partnership with Panama and Nicaragua and the
rest of Latin America,'' Hart said.
   In Central America, Panamanian and Nicarguan leaders said the
aid would help their economies but wouldn't solve all their
problems.
   President Guillermo Endara at a news conference promised
judicious use of the money for ``the greatest benefit to all
Panamanians,'' while Nicaraguan presidential spokesman Danilo
Lacayo said the money would ``stabilize a little the situation we
live in'' at the start of the planting season.
   Bush had asked Congress for $800 million for Panama and
Nicaragua, but Congress pared his request while adding money
elsewhere. When passed, the bill contained $4 in domestic spending
for every dollar of Latin aid.
   For example, the measure included nearly 40 individual grants
through the Department of Housing and Urban Development totaling
$28 million, most of them for communities whose members of Congress
are on the House and Senate Appropriations committees.
   On the list was $400,000 to fill in a collapsed utility tunnel
in Salisbury, N.C., sought by Rep. Bill Hefner, D-N.C., and
$990,000 to fix up a waterfront park in Bay City, Mich., in the
district of Democratic Rep. Bob Traxler.
   The measure also provides several billion dollars for domestic
programs, such as the $1.2 billion needed to make up a shortfall in
food stamp funds for the current fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30;
$545 million for veterans benefits; $166 million for Head Start;
and $432 million for fighting forest fires.
   It also included other foreign assistance: $75 million to meet
refugee needs around the world, $45 million in anti-narcotics aid
to Bolivia and Peru, $30 million for aid to Caribbean countries and
$30 million for Africa.

<DATELINE>SHIYAN, China (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Mules pull the loads and there's hardly a
car to be seen in Motor City, China.
   This city of 378,000 in the mountains of central China is home
to the Second Automobile Works, the nation's largest truck
manufacturer, which employs 80,000 people and indirectly provides
livelihoods for many more.
   It made 135,000 trucks last year, about one-fourth of all the
motor vehicles China produced.
   The Second Automobile Works has brought the 20th century, and
prosperity, to a backwater where peasants still use mules and water
buffalo to scratch a living from the rocky terrain.
   When China was in the throes of the Cultural Revolution in the
late 1960s and relations with the Soviet Union were extremely
tense, Mao Tse-tung decided to move key industries out of the way
of upheaval and invasion.
   In 1969, it was decided trucks would be made in Shiyan, a small
town in the poverty belt of northwest Hubei province.
   ``There was nothing here but rice paddies then,'' said Ma Yue,
executive vice president of the plant, who arrived in 1971. ``There
was no place to live, so we had to stay with farmers.''
   Young men brought in as workers had difficulty finding wives, so
a textile mill was built to attract young women.
   Today, per capita annual income is about 2,800 yuan ($595) for
workers at the truck plant and 2,300 yuan ($489) for Shiyan
residents in general. Both are roughly double the national average.
   Trucks from the Second Automobile Works are in great demand _
all 140,000 vehicles to be made this year are sold _ so Shiyan has
escaped an economic slump that began affecting most of China six
months ago. The city's industrial output in the first four months
of 1990 grew by 5.1 percent.
   Unemployment is a problem in China as a whole, but not in
Shiyan. Because the area is so remote, the truck plant relies on
local sources for 70 percent of its parts.
   Company officials also say the state-run enterprise will not lay
off workers as it automates, although the factory appears
overstaffed.
   During a visit to the final assembly plant, 146 people were
working along a 785-foot production line. Children of workers are
usually guaranteed jobs at the plant.
   Shiyan has shown off its affluence by building a musically
synchronized fountain, costing the equivalent of $170,000, that
provides residents with a colorful water symphony every weekend.
   Mayor Wu Fayu said that, by supporting the truck factory and
``marching along the socialist road,'' the people of his city were
``leading a comfortable life.''
   Poverty still reigns outside the city. Beyond the drab,
functional apartments for factory workers, farmers hack at tiny
vegetable patches next to one-room huts of brick and mud.
   Water buffalo pull plows through rocky soil. Women wash clothes
in streams while their children bathe.
   After leaving Shiyan, the road quickly deteriorates into
potholes and stretches of construction, where young boys chip at
the mountainsides with pickaxes.
   Buses, jeeps and trucks cruise on the city's wide, empty
streets, but there are virtually no passenger cars. Carts pulled by
men or mules carry produce and supplies.
   The few traffic lights in the self-designated Motor City of
China were turned off during a visit to Shiyan. Street lights on a
main avenue did not come on after dark and couples strolled down
the middle of the moonlit street.
   Guo Shuyan, the provincial governor, said northwest Hubei was so
remote the the government did not know of a serious food shortage
in one area until a newspaper reporter wrote an expose. He said
authorities quickly sent 44,000 tons of grain.
   Company officials acknowledge being more than 600 miles inland
from Shanghai is a drawback to competing in the expanding Chinese
auto industry.
   ``We are in the mountains, so we have to provide our own schools
and welfare facilities,'' Ma said, and about 10 percent of the 1989
profit of 600 million yuan ($127 million) went to welfare programs.
   Asked about the original decision to build the plant in Shiyan,
Ma replied: ``It was the 1960s, and we had no choice.''
   Shiyan will remain the company's base, but it has ambitious
plans and is looking elsewhere.
   A joint venture with Citreon of France to produce 150,000 small
passenger cars annually by 1993, and up to 300,000 later, will be
built in Wuhan, the Hubei provincial capital. Wuhan is on the
Yangtze River, an ideal route for shipping finished cars.
   Xiangfan, on the plains 120 miles east of Shiyan, will be the
site of a plant to produce up to 400,000 engines a year for the
joint venture.

   Thirty times in the past two years, free-lance
writer Bonnie Kaufman got letters from strangers who said her work
wasn't good enough.
   She's used to such rough treatment. Free-lance writers belong to
a mongrel breed renowned for its ability to take a kicking and keep
on licking.
   But now she's tired of turning the other cheek. She wants to get
even.
   The aim of her new American Society of Rejected Writers is to
``have fun with the rejection thing by trashing editors.''
   Membership is open to any writer who can produce a rejection
letter. She envisions a group that will meet annually and present
prizes for the greatest number of rejections, the slowest and
funniest rejections, the rejection that contained the most
grammatical and spelling errors and the cruelest rejection.
   How cruel can a rejection letter be? Ms. Kaufman recalls that a
friend once received a letter that consisted of five words.
   ``I can't. I just can't,'' the editor wrote.
   Ms. Kaufman, 29, doesn't have to write to be rejected. She moved
to New York five years ago, ``in the hopes of getting married. My
hopes were dashed.''
   She has accumulated a passel of rejections from her free-lance
work, including two from The New York Times ``Hers'' column.
Trouble is, she had not submitted the article to that department _
it was a profile, not the kind of feminine introspection that is
published in ``Hers.''
   ``I figure that their computer just spit out the wrong form
rejection letter. Twice,'' she said.
   While struggling as a free-lance writer, Ms. Kaufman works
part-time as an editor for a Manhattan weekly newspaper, a job that
has forced her to reject the work of other writers.
   One writer responded not with anger or anguish, but with
gratitude.
   ``I was nice to him,'' Ms. Kaufman said. ``I told him that the
idea was good, but I thought the execution could be improved. And
he was so grateful.''
   That got her thinking about rejection letters that were not so
kind. And that got her thinking about forming a group to unite
downtrodden writers.
   She placed an ad in this week's New York magazine, asking anyone
who was interested in such a group to call. ``That wasn't an easy
decision. New York had just rejected an article of mine,'' she
said, and she didn't know whether she wanted to pay money to a
magazine that had rebuffed her.
   In the first two days the magazine was out, she received 15
calls. There were some pretty pathetic cases among them.
   ``One woman called and said to call her anytime, day or night,
please call,'' Ms. Kaufman said. ``Another had not been rejected in
the United States but had been rejected in the Philippines. Was
that acceptable?''
   Another man said he had thrown away all his rejection letters.
Could he join? Informed that he could not, he asked if the
rejection letter from the American Society of Rejected Writers
would count as a rejection.
   ``This is getting more complicated than I had anticipated,'' Ms.
Kaufman said.

   The Associated Press reported erroneously
on Friday that Earth First! spokeswoman Kelpie Wilson said Judi
Bari was an ``eco-warrior'' who advocated tree-spiking, the
practice of driving large spikes into trees to spoil them for

   Wilson said Bari, who was arrested on Friday on charges of
possessing and transporting explosives after she was injured when
her car blew up Thursday, opposed tree spiking and has supported
peaceful methods of opposing timber harvesting.

<TEXT>
   A Russian woman has won custody of her
2-year-old daughter until a hearing next month on whether the child
should live with her mother in Leningrad or with her father in New
Orleans.
   Alexsandra McFaull had been living with her father, attorney
Roderick McFaull, since he won a court order April 23 to take her
off a plane that was about to leave New York City for Leningrad.
   Galina McFaull must surrender her passport and tickets for a
flight to Leningrad to ensure that she won't leave with Alexsandra
before the permanent custody hearing June 13, Civil Judge Yada T.
Magee ruled Wednesday.
   She said McFaull may visit his daughter each day until the
hearing.
   The couple met in 1984 while McFaull was on a trip to the Soviet
Union and were married there the following year.
   Civil Judge Max Tobias had granted McFaull temporary custody in
April to prevent Mrs. McFaull from taking Alexsandra out of the
country.
   After three days of hearings, Magee ruled Wednesday that it was
in the child's interest to be with her mother.
   ``I hoped the judge would be fair and she was fair for the
child,'' said Mrs. McFaull.
   McFaull said Magee didn't give enough weight to testimony that
Mrs. McFaull on several occasions had left their daughter
unattended for up to two hours in their New Orleans home while she
went out to shop.
   ``There are state laws here which say you can't leave children
by themselves'' for long periods, McFaull said.
   Magee ruled several weeks ago that she didn't have jurisdiction
in an international custody case, but the state 4th Circuit Court
of Appeal overturned that decision and ordered a custody hearing.

   A former U.S. Agency for International
Development official was sentenced to prison and fined Friday for
taking bribes while heading an assistance program for the
Nicaraguan Contra rebels.
   Donald F. Enos, 47, former deputy director of AID, apologized
for accepting $93,000 in bribes from the owner of a medical
consulting firm that won $2.6 million in government contracts with
Enos' help.
   U.S. District Judge Claude M. Hilton sentenced Enos to two
one-year prison terms to be served concurrently and ordered him to
pay a $5,000 fine. The judge also ordered Enos to pay $1,040 in
restitution to the federal government.
   Enos will be placed on two year's unsupervised probation once he
has completed his prison term.
   Enos pleaded guilty last March to giving George Kraus of Kraus
International confidential AID information and arranging for the
New York company to win a $57,000 contract to study the
administration of medical services to the Contras in 1988 and 1989.
   He could have been sentenced to as many as 30 years in prison
and fined as much as $500,000.
   ``I am extremely remorseful. I violated the trust of my
co-workers,'' The Washington Post quoted Enos as saying.

   A pair of human feet, still clad in

the feet while gutting an 8- to 10-foot-long shark, Coast Guard
radioman Jon Morris said.
   The Coast Guard dispatched a boat to pick up the remains and
turned them over to Jacksonville homicide detectives.
   The feet were tentatively identified Thursday as those of
missing Jacksonville police officer Thomas Caron, said Dr.
Margarita Arruza of the Duval County Medical Examiner's Office.
   Caron's family was shown a picture of the sneakers, and said he
was wearing a similar pair when he left for a fishing trip April 27.
   Caron and companion Robert Duncan have been missing since their
boat capsized April 27 about 12 miles southeast of Mayport.
   The body of a third man, police officer Robert Jones, was later
recovered off the Georgia coast. An autopsy showed that he had
drowned.

   Acidic gases from an active volcano
have damaged 20,000 acres of nearby crops, and the government says
it will help reimburse farmers for their losses.
   Under an emergency decree signed Thursday by President Rafael
Angel Calderon, more than 1,000 farmers near the Poas Volcano will
be able to receive payments, officials said. No amounts were
mentioned.
   Authorities say the volcano has spewed gases in recent days that
mixed with humid air to form acidic gases that damaged the crops,
including coffee, strawberries and other fruits and vegetables. No
recent lava eruptions have been reported.
   The 8,900-foot-high volcano, about 20 miles north of San Jose,
is one of the country's most popular tourist attractions. The
volcano entered a new cycle of eruptions in 1986.
   National University scientists have recommended that children
and the elderly stay away from the volcano because of the gases.

   Volunteers today began rescuing

Australia that has already killed more than 100 of the birds.
   Schoolchildren joined in the effort to find dead or injured
birds along a 150-mile stretch of coastline of Victoria state.
   Fifty-six of the oil-covered penguins, close to death, were
being cared for at a special rescue center, said Kris Reinertson,
head ranger of the Otway Range National Park.
   An investigation was under way to find the ship responsible for
the six-mile-long oil slick, which has largely broken up in the
heavy seas since it was first sighted Monday, the Port of Melbourne

   The slick spread through major feeding grounds for the penguins,
which can swim up to 180 miles a day in search of food.

<HEAD>Lawmakers Moving to Stop Trade Benefits to China</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOAN MOWER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Members of Congress are trying to stop
President Bush from giving another year of trade benefits to China,
whose leaders they called butchers and pirates.
   Bush announced on Thursday he would extend most favored nation
trade status to China for an additional year, despite the
administration's unhappiness with Beijing's human rights policies
following the June 1989 massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators at
Tiananmen Square.
   This is the second time in a year the president has fought with
Congress over China. The last time, when the issue was how to
protect Chinese students studying in this country, Bush won a
narrow victory.
   The announcement touched off a firestorm on Capitol Hill, in
part because many lawmakers thought Bush might impose some
conditions on Beijing at the same time he approved trade benefits.
   Most of the criticism came from Democrats, but a few Republicans
were angry, too.
   ``The president's repeated concessions for the Chinese
government have been met with intransigence,'' said Senate Majority
Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine. ``The answer is not more
concessions. That doesn't make sense.''
   House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, D-Wash., criticized Bush for
failing to put any conditions on the one-year extension to prod
China toward reforms.
   ``I think he faces some very severe problems here,'' Foley said.
``At the present time, I would say there are not the votes to
approve it.''
   Mitchell vowed to ``aggressively and vigorously'' pursue
legislative action to revoke China's trade benefits.
   Most members criticized China's human rights record. By
extending favored trade status, ``We are only legitimizing the
bankrupt and repressive butchers of Beijing,'' said Rep. Tom
Lantos, D-Calif.
   One of the president's few defenders was Rep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa.
``Closing down the economy may slam the door on political reform''
in China, he said.
   House Minority Leader Bob Michel, R-Ill., said earlier he would
back the president.
   Members didn't waste any time introducing bills that could end
most favored nation status for China.
   Resolutions disapproving the extension were introduced in the
House and Senate. If passed, Bush could veto them. Both houses
would need a two-thirds vote to override the veto.
   Alternatively, the Senate Finance Committee and the House Ways
and Means Committee could initiate legislation to revoke the trade
benefits.
   When Congress returns June 5 from its Memorial Day recess, China
is sure to be a dominant issue. Members can expect to hear from
business interests about the issue on their vacations.
   Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., said toy manufacturers have ``beat
the door'' in their lobbying effort to gain an extension of favored
trade. But D'Amato said he still opposes Bush because it's wrong to
``trade with any killer, do business with any pirate.''
   Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas, said the finance committee will
hold hearings on the issue in early June. The Senate Foreign
Relations Committee plans another round of hearings.
   Bush had until June 3 to make a decision, but he likely wanted
to avoid announcing his decision around the time of the June 4
one-year anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre.
   Most favored nation status gives China the same preferential
trade treatment _ including lowest-possible tariffs _ that is
extended to most major trading partners. China has had the status
for 10 years.
   Denial would send tariffs rising sharply on about $12 billion in
annual imports from China of textiles, toys and other products. It
also would have hurt business in Hong Kong, a British territory.
   The American Association of Exporters and Importers has
estimated that removal of favored trade status would have boosted
tariffs on Chinese goods by an average 40 percent. The president
said these costs would be passed on to U.S. consumers.
   Shortly after Bush announced the decision, Richard H. Solomon,
assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs,
defended the China decision on Capitol Hill.
   ``In the end, the president concluded that denial of MFN (most
favored nation status) would inflict grievous harm on the
multitudes of intellectuals, workers, managers and officials inside
China who struggle daily to keep alive the flame of reform and
openness to the outside world,'' he told members of the House
Foreign Affairs Committee.

<HEAD>Democrats in `Gentlemanly' Runoff, Attack Helms, Not Each Other</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DENNIS PATTERSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The two Democrats locked in a runoff for
the U.S. Senate nomination are going easy on each other and aiming
their fire instead at potential Republican opponent Sen. Jesse
Helms.
   Democrats Mike Easley and Harvey Gantt have carefully avoided
attacking each other during the first two weeks of the runoff
campaign. But they frequently jabbed at Helms.
   ``They have a lot of common supporters and it's hard to insult
people who are fairly close to you,'' said Thad Beyle, a political
science professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel
Hill.
   Beyle characterized it as a ``gentlemanly'' runoff designed in
part to avoid alienating voters who could choose to sit out the
November general election.
   Easley is the Brunswick County district attorney, and Gantt is a
former Charlotte mayor who is hoping to become the state's first
black Senate nominee this century.
   Meanwhile, Helms, a three-term incumbent with a nationwide
network of conservative financial contributors and supporters, says
he isn't taking re-election for granted.
   ``I hear far too often, `Jesse's got it made,''' Helms said at
one weekend campaign appearance. ``Well, Jesse ain't got it made.''
   The state's political history favors Easley in the June 5
Democratic runoff, even though Gantt outpolled him by 50,000 votes
in the six-way May 8 primary.
   Black candidates such as Gantt traditionally have lost runoffs
against a single white candidate after leading a field of several
whites in the first primary, Beyle said.
   That history led minorities last year to successfully push for a
change in state election law that allows a candidate to win a
primary with 40 percent of the vote, rather than the old standard
of 50 percent. Black voters account for 26 percent of registered
Democrats in North Carolina.
   While the change in election law was expected to help Gantt, he
fell short of the new threshold and finished the primary with 37.5
percent. Easley was second with 30.2 percent. Three other white
candidates and one black candidate were eliminated.
   Easley, during a weekend campaign appearance, said Democrats
should ``focus on the issues and make (Helms') record an issue.
We've never done that; we've always got caught up in national
politics and that's a mistake.''
   Gantt, meanwhile, criticized Helms' vote last week against a
spending bill designed to help cities and states cope with growing
numbers of AIDS cases. Helms charged that money was being diverted
from other diseases and that the bill would encourage homosexual
practices, which he termed immoral.
   ``I thought he embarrassed the people of North Carolina by
showing no compassion for the AIDS victims in our society, for
showing a lack of understanding as to what in fact has caused that
problem to exist,'' Gantt said.
   ``I just thought it was an embarrassing performance and another
example of how irrelevant he is to the times we live in,'' Gantt
added.
   Both Democrats have been scrambling to raise money while Helms
has raised and spent more than $5 million so far. Easley had raised
$481,000 and Gantt had raised $402,000 as of May 16.
   Helms told a Goldsboro rally over the weekend he is worried
about complacency.
   ``No matter who the other side nominates, if it's Mortimer
Snerd, they're going to get 40 or 45 percent of the vote in
November, right off the top,'' he said. ``It's going to depend on
people in this state who believe in conservative principles to get
to the polls.''
   Beyle said that while Gantt and Easley are gunning for Helms,
they also may be thinking about future bids for office.
   ``They're keeping their sights on the main target _ which is in
November _ and there is no question they are trying to shape the
issues rather than give Helms the chance to shape them,'' Beyle
said.
   ``But I think also there is some feeling that if they don't do
well in June or November, they want to do well in 1992.''

<HEAD>NATO Sharply Slashes War Maneuvers in Europe, Replaces With
Computer Games</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SALLY JACOBSEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MONS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A waning Soviet threat has prompted NATO to
slash war games nearly in half, replacing them with computer
simulations, and to slacken the response time of some forces, the
alliance's chief military commander says.
   ``People don't want big exercises because the looming threat of
an immediate war has lessened,'' U.S. Gen. John R. Galvin, the
supreme allied commander in Europe, said Thursday.
   ``We have cut down significantly on the amount of noise,
maneuver damage (and) general bother, and yet we have accomplished
our exercises to train to the standards that are required,'' he
said in an interview at his official residence in Mons, about 40
miles southwest of Brussels.
   That should come as good news to West Germans, who have
increasingly called for a cutback in NATO maneuvers on the ground
and in the air that have been prone to sometimes deadly mishaps.
Most of the exercises are held in West Germany.
   The changes in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization follow the
fall of hard-line Communist regimes in Eastern Europe and come as
East and West Germany prepare to merge.
   A new NATO report shows authorities have canceled or trimmed 47
percent of the approximately 100 exercises that will begin late
this year and run over three years in Europe.
   Ten major maneuvers have been scrapped; 22 exercises have been
linked together, and an additional 22 have been reduced, it said.
   Some exercises held annually now will take place every three
years. Fewer tanks and other heavy equipment will be used.
   The report estimated the slimmer training schedule would mean an
annual savings of about $21 million in property damage in West
Germany. Heavy tanks tear up farmers' fields and cut into roads
used in the maneuvers.
   Galvin said that with the tightened military exercises, senior
officers use computer simulations of crisis situations to get their
training. Smaller units, often swallowed up in the big maneuvers,
get more chances to run through drills and perfect their skills.
   ``This is better training than we had before,'' he said.
   ``I'm not trying to whitewash a reduction in training by saying
we still get better training,'' he insisted. ``I could prove it to
any professional.''
   Galvin also said that under a new plan to ease response times in
war, quick-reaction combat planes will remain at full alert, but
some front-line soldiers will have twice as long to react to an
enemy attack.
   The response times of air and ground forces in Western Europe
could be relaxed further if the Soviet Union pulls more troops out
of Eastern Europe, he said.
   ``There is no use keeping as many people snugged right up close
on response times unless it's absolutely necessary,'' he said.
``With the changes (in Eastern Europe), it's not quite as
necessary.''
   The new response times, which refer to the amount of time it
takes a unit of soldiers to react to an enemy attack, will go into
effect on July 1.
   All ground and most air forces, including helicopters and
surface-to-air missile units, in Europe will be affected by the
changes, Galvin said.
   There will be no easing of the reaction time for full-alert
interceptors, which have only a few minutes notice to be in the air
to fend off an attack.
   ``As long as we have forces, we want some quick-reaction
capability that is right down to a matter of minutes to get
airborne,'' he said. Well under 100 planes, he said, are ready to
do that.
   The changes, he said, could mean substantial cost savings over
time.
   He said it was expensive, for instance, to keep an anti-aircraft
missile crew, with backup assistance, at a high level of readiness.
   Galvin said NATO guidelines give him the authority to relax the
reaction times to a certain extent but additional reductions would
require agreement of the member nations.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and other NATO defense ministers
announced Wednesday the decision to ``lower the readiness and
availability of a number of our standing forces.''
   The move is part of a series of measures likely to be taken in
the coming months to revise the military strategy that guided the
alliance in the Cold War years.

   Shuttle Columbia is set to blast off
Wednesday with seven astronauts and a $150 million observatory that
will examine high-energy ultraviolet light and X-rays emitted from
stars and galaxies.
   Columbia's launch, initially scheduled for May 9 and then for
around May 17, was delayed because a faulty cooling valve had to be
replaced in the shuttle's payload bay.
   Liftoff now is scheduled for Wednesday at 12:38 a.m. EDT, the
fifth nighttime launch of a shuttle.
   ``We're ready to go,'' NASA spokeswoman Lisa Malone said after a
flight readiness review meeting Thursday. The mission managers who
met at Kennedy Space Center praised technicians for their work,
Malone said.
   ``There were no problems during that whole repair process,'' she
said.
   Technicians last week removed a valve with a torn filter and
replaced it with a new one. It was the first time such work had
ever been performed on an orbiter at the launch pad.
   A final check of the cooling system this week found everything
in order, Malone said. Technicians removed a makeshift platform
erected in the payload bay and other work items Wednesday and spent
Thursday closing out the shuttle's rear engine compartment.
   The Astro ultraviolet and X-ray observatory will photograph the
ultraviolet sky and simultaneously measure the high energy of
ultraviolet and X-ray radiation wavelengths, which are absorbed by
the atmosphere and therefore invisible from the ground.
   Four astronomers on the crew will operate Astro's three
ultraviolet telescopes and one X-ray telescope.
   The Astro mission originally was scheduled for March 1986, but
the Challenger explosion on Jan. 28, 1986, resulted in a lengthy
delay.
   The nine- to 10-day mission will be the 36th shuttle flight.

<TEXT>
   With the demise of communism in Eastern
Europe, the White House is wondering why the United States should
continue broadcasting radio programs to those countries.
   A review by the National Security Council is recommending that
the broadcasts by Radio Free Europe be reduced, according to a
source familiar with the preliminary report scheduled for
completion May 30.
   Radio Free Europe, based in Munich, West Germany, has been
broadcasting to Eastern Europe throughout the Cold War and was much
reviled and jammed by the communist governments in those countries.
   Although the changes in Eastern Europe have given Radio Free
Europe unprecedented reporting and broadcasting opportunities, they
also have called into question the need for its existence.
   The network announced Thursday it was opening offices in Prague
and Warsaw at the invitation of the leaders of Czechoslovakia and
Poland. Czech President Vaclav Havel attended the bureau opening in
Prague and praised Radio Free Europe for its programs that
contributed to the fall of communism.
   The bureaus, as well as the one opened in Hungary last
September, also will help train local journalists in Western-style
news gathering, the Radio Free Europe statement said.
   ``We expect to be there for quite some time to come,'' said
Radio Free Europe's Washington representative, Pat Gates Lynch.
   But the NSC review is expected to call on Radio Free Europe to
eventually cut its programs to Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland,
said the source. It recommends that Radio Free Europe initially cut
its repeat programs and eventually its original broadcasts, too.
   The money saved would be channeled into other foreign
broadcasting services, possibly the Voice of America or the U.S.
Information Agency's television network, said the source. Radio
Free Europe has a congressionally funded budget of $190 million.
   The panel also is expected to recommend the creation of a
bipartisan presidential commission to examine the future of U.S.
government broadcasts abroad.
   The recommendations are expected to set off a tussle between
various agencies seeking to retain their share of programming or to
enhance it.
   The panel also is recommending cuts in the planned construction
of a $300 million transmitter in Israel, which Radio Free Europe
and VOA intend to use for broadcasts to Eastern Europe, Asia and
Africa, said the source who spoke on condition of anonymity.
   The NSC believes that Radio Free Europe broadcasts to Eastern
Europe will be sharply reduced by the time the transmitter becomes
operational in 1996, said the source.
   An independent advisory commission last week issued a report
recommending that Radio Free Europe be gradually phased out and its
assets passed to VOA. The report by the U.S. Advisory Commission on
Public Diplomacy drew a heated protest from the Board for
International Broadcasting, which controls Radio Free Europe.
   The board argues that Eastern Europe needs Radio Free Europe
during its transition to democracy, that its audiences are far
greater than those of VOA, and its functions are completely
different.

<DATELINE>MADAWASKA, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A bright turquoise pipeline spans the
St. John River between Maine's northern tip and Canada, linking two
halves of a pulp and paper mill a mile apart.
   The pipes carry wood pulp and steam, but they also stand as a
symbol of a union between two towns that see themselves as one
despite the international border that separates them.
   ``If you could put blinds on for a minute you'd forget there's
an international border,'' said Bert Martin, manager of the Fraser
Inc. pulp mill in Edmundston, New Brunswick. ``It's really two
towns in two countries, but one community.''
   For the most part, people in Madawaska and Edmundston work for
the same company, shop in the same stores, speak the same language
_ French _ and share a common Acadian background.
   Children ride their bicycles across the bridge joining the two
countries to play with their friends on the other side; workers who
cross the line daily address immigration officers by their first
names.
   With no hospital nearby on their side of the border, many
Madawaska women choose to go to the Edmundston hospital to have
their babies, one reason why so many children grow up with dual
citizenship.
   Also mixing the pot are Americans who marry Canadians, and
Canadians who become American citizens after working on the U.S.
side. Job transfers and promotions add to the mishmash of
citizenship and sense of homogeneity.
   ``I'm a Canadian working in the U.S., married to an American
working in Canada,'' said Barry K. Voss, manager of the Fraser Ltd.
paper mill in Madawaska. ``I'm not unusual.''
   Another case in point is Al Soucy, a Canadian-born Madawaska
mill worker who is now an American. Soucy's oldest daughter is also
American, but his son and twin daughters are Canadian. He describes
Madawaska-Edmundston, which have a combined population of 17,500,
as safe day and night and ``a nice place to bring kids up.''
   Things were peaceful even when the area, wedged between northern
Maine's rich potato fields and New Brunswick's forested hills, was
at the center of a bitter international border rivalry.
   From the late 1700s until the present lines were agreed upon in
1842, the British and American governments each claimed a large
chunk of land along the St. John.
   It was the site of a colony that had been settled by Acadians
ousted from their eastern Canadian homeland, along with French
Canadians and Yankees. The groups formed their own little melting
pot and peacefully inhabited a self-governed area about four times
the size of Rhode Island.
   Ever since, ``Madawaskans'' from both sides of the border have
viewed themselves as one people. The mayor of Edmundston retains
the honorary title of president of the ``republic'' of Madawaska.
   Still, differences between the two communities are apparent.
   Street and store signs on the Edmundston side are in French, in
English on the Madawaska side.
   Each side also offers its particular amenities. Clothing is of
superior quality and there's a better choice of restaurants and
night spots on the Canadian side, Soucy said. But many Canadians
head south to buy milk and gas, cheaper on the U.S. side, Voss said.
   While the border itself may go unnoticed, the time difference it
represents is a constant source of confusion even to longtime
residents. Maine is in the Eastern time zone, an hour earlier than
the Atlantic time zone in New Brunswick.
   Separate national holidays are marked on each side of the border.
   Voss said his family celebrates both the Canadian Thanksgiving
in October and the American holiday a month later. Others celebrate
Canada Day, which falls on July 1, as well as the Fourth of July.
   Dealing with two nations' tax laws is not so simple. Dual
regulations can bedevil people living in one country and working in
another. Voss has to hire an accountant to sort out his tax
paperwork before he files.
   Because Fraser's operations straddle the border, it must comply
with separate national labor, environmental and other regulatory
laws.
   While the American and Canadian governments are working to
remove trade barriers and eliminate most tariffs through their
free-trade agreement, Fraser _the economic backbone of the region _
already effectively end-runs U.S. import hurdles through its unique
setup.
   The Edmundston mill, whose 670 employees are virtually all
Canadian, produces pulp, the essential ingredient of paper. It also
produces box board, the material used in cereal boxes and frozen
food cartons.
   The mill is connected to its other half in Madawaska by the
7,000-foot pipeline that carries pulp and steam used to manufacture
products such as paper for books, catalogs and telephone
directories.
   There is no duty on the pulp nor on the steam that provides most
of the power consumed in the Madawaska mill, where upwards of 90
percent of the 1,200 employees are U.S. citizens. And because the
paper is manufactured in the United States _ a huge market for
finished paper _ there is no import duty.

<HEAD>Senators Say Pressure Building to Kill Anti-Crime Bill</HEAD>

   Senators say their crime bill limiting nine
kinds of semiautomatic guns and prohibiting the death penalty for
mentally retarded convicts in federal cases could be running into
severe trouble.
   ``It seems to me there is great pressure from certain groups ...
to kill the bill,'' Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said
Thursday after 271 possible amendments surfaced. The measure was
shelved until after a 10-day congressional recess set to begin
today.
   The Senate earlier Thursday upheld 59-38 a ban contained in the
bill on putting to death mentally retarded individuals convicted of
capital crimes in federal cases. It voted 58-38 to drop a provision
allowing death row inmates to use statistics to prove on appeal
that their sentences involved racial bias.
   The Senate also reversed a decision it made Wednesday and
approved 52-46 a stringent version of legislation on how courts
review capital punishment cases to determine whether they were
conducted in a constitutional manner.
   The ``habeas corpus'' provision adopted would give defendants at
most 60 days after their conviction to seek a federal review to
determine if their case met constitutional standards.
   Courts would have 110 days to reach a decision. The Senate on
Wednesday approved a version that would give the prisoners a year
to file and impose no time limit on the courts.
   The bill also calls for the death penalty for 30 federal
offenses, including assassination of the president.
   No corresponding legislation is on the calendar in the House.
   Senate Democratic leaders, saying it was necessary to keep the
bill from going into a stall, set June 5 on a vote to limit debate.
   They said that without invoking cloture, or limiting debate, the
Senate could become hopelessly bogged down in discussion of each
individual item.
   But senators said it was not certain that such a constraint
could be imposed. The National Rifle Association remained upset by
an action Wednesday in which lawmakers voted to keep the bill's
restrictions on semiautomatic weapons.
   More than 30 of the 184 Republican and 87 Democratic amendments
that materialized Thursday concerned firearms, senators said.
   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, said he hoped
there would be no delay. He reminded lawmakers that President Bush
has ``repeatedly indicated his desire for action on this
legislation, as recently as this week.''
   Hours earlier, however, Bush told reporters at the White House
that he wanted ``a good, strong anti-crime bill'' without the curbs
on semiautomatics.
   Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph R. Biden, D-Del., told
reporters Thursday night he feared that unless limits were placed
on debate the bill might be doomed.
   ``If you don't get cloture, I think you bring it down,'' Biden
said. He said it was ``a crapshoot'' as to whether Senate leaders
could mobilize the 60 votes needed to limit debate.
   Biden led opposition Thursday to efforts to drop the bill's
language prohibiting execution of mentally retarded people
convicted of capital crimes under federal law.
   The prohibition comes in reaction to a Supreme Court decision
last year that cleared the way for execution of the mentally
retarded. But it would not fully reverse that ruling, since it
would not apply to state cases.
   ``For God's sake, if you acknowledge you should not put children
to death, acknowledge that you should not put to death the mentally
retarded,'' Biden urged the Senate.
   Conservatives said that under the legislation virtually every
defendant in a capital case would claim to be mentally retarded.
``Seventy percent of them are claiming that now,'' said Sen. Orrin
Hatch, R-Utah.

   A pipe bomb explosion in a car Thursday
injured two members of a militant environmental group, and a member
of the group said police planned to file explosives charges against
the two.
   Karen Pickett, a member of the Earth First! group questioned by
police about the bombing, told radio statio KCBS in San Francisco
they had told her evidence indicated the two activists were
carrying the bomb in the car when it exploded.
   Police refused to say whether they planned charges against Judi
Bari, 40, and Darryl Cherney, 33, both of Ukiah.
   Bari said recently she had received death threats for helping
organize a campaign to slow logging in Northern California's
old-growth forests and other environmental activities.
   The explosion occurred shortly before noon near Oakland High
School, said a garage worker who identified himself only as Charles.
   ``It sounded like a cherry bomb in a tin can,'' said the worker.
``It was pretty loud. I kind of felt it in my body and I was
inside.''
   After the explosion, the car rolled about 50 yards before
hitting another vehicle and coming to a stop, witnesses said.
Pieces of seats and windshield covered the street.
   Earth First! spokesman Daniel Barron identified the victims as
Bari, a passenger in the white Subaru station wagon registered in
her name, and Cherney, the driver.
   Bari suffered facial injuries and a pelvic fracture and was in
serious but stable condition at Highland Hospital, hospital
spokesman David Berry said. Cherney was treated for a minor injury
above his left eye, Berry said.
   No other injuries were reported.
   Supporters were infuriated by the suggestion that Bari and
Cherney might have been transporting a bomb.
   ``Local Earth Firsters are totally outraged. We know both of
them to be completely nonviolent,'' said organization spokeswoman
Kelpie Wilson.
   About 30 members of Seeds of Peace, a group that works with
Earth First!, waited inside the lobby of the Oakland Police
Department on Thursday night, where they said police and FBI were
questioning Cherney.
   The activists said they would stay there until police let
Cherney go. One woman who would not give her name accused the
police of trying to ``frame'' the injured environmentalists.
   ``Preliminary investigation indicates it was a device that
exploded inside the vehicle, and it's been characterized (by
police) as a pipe bomb,'' FBI spokesman Duke Diedrich. He said he
did not know where the bomb was in the car.
   Bari and Cherney were organizers of the upcoming ``Redwood
Summer'' campaign to slow what some environmentalists say is
excessive logging in California, Earth First! spokeswoman Kelpie
Wilson said.
   Redwood Summer is based on the nonviolent civil rights movement
of the 1960s, Wilson said.
   In an interview published Sunday in the San Jose Mercury News,
Bari said she has received several death threats in recent months.
   Other Earth First! members involved in anti-logging activities
were attacked by loggers during demonstrations in Ukiah last year.
In August a logging truck rammed into the back of a car driven by
Bari and carrying her two young daughters and the child of another
activist.
   Wilson said Bari is a well-known ``eco warrior'' who advocated
``tree spiking,'' the driving of long metal spikes into trees to
damage lumbering equipment.
   For the Redwood Summer campaign, Earth First! members on the
Northern California Coast had vowed to give up such radical
activities for more peaceful practices.

<HEAD>Parks Concessionaires Reaping Excess Profits, Congress Told</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Two congressional panels are looking into
whether ``sweetheart'' contracts are allowing concessionaires to
rake in excessive profits at national parks.
   ``Our national parks were established for people, not for
profiteers,'' Rep. Bruce Vento, D-Minn., said Thursday as his House
subcommittee on national parks and public lands considered two
Interior Department reports critical of concessionaire practices.
   The department's inspector general said many long-term
contracts, at times running more than 30 years, are allowing
concessionaires to earn a much greater return on investment than
they could expect elsewhere.
   As a result, he said, the federal government has earned about
$100 million less in fees since 1984 than it should have received,
and $90 million more will be lost over the next four years. He said
the contracts often include a clause making it virtually impossible
to renegotiate unless the concessionaire agrees to do so.
   Investigators also found little attempt to promote competition
once a contract is up for renewal, the Interior Department report
suggested.
   Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan in December ordered the
investigation as well as a report on concessionaires by a National
Park Service task force.
   He promised to change the way contracts are negotiated, seek
higher franchise fees and shorten the duration of contracts, but he
told the subcommittee he does not think legislative changes are
needed.
   In addition to Vento's panel, a subcommittee of the House
Government Operations Committee dealing with the environment and
natural resources is expected to hold hearings soon on the parks
concession issue.
   While concessions at smaller parks frequently are run by ``mom
and pop'' operations, concessionaires at large parks often are
subsidiaries of such major corporations as the MCA Inc.
entertainment giant, whose Park &amp; Curry Co. operates at Yosemite
National Park.
   Concession contracts usually are written by inexperienced local
park officials, officials said.
   ``Park service employees who are trained as park rangers are
outmatched when dealing with sophisticated business executives and
their accountants,'' James Richards, Interior inspector general,
told Vento's subcommittee.
   Richards said concessionaires reported $500 million in gross
receipts from national park operations in 1988, while the
government collected only $12.5 million in franchise fees.
   Fourteen companies accounted for more than half of the receipts
and about $6.2 million in fees, he said.
   ``These findings seem to paint a picture of sweetheart deals,
whether intended as such or not, resulting in excess profits at
taxpayer expense,'' said Vento.
   The Conference of National Park Concessioners obtained a
temporary restraining order in federal court late Wednesday to keep
major portions of inspector general's report from being released,
on the grounds that financial information was proprietary.
   Portions of the report circulated at Thursday's hearing were
blanked out in compliance with the court order so that financial
information about specific concessionaires at specific parks could
not be read. The Interior Department contends the data should be
made public.
   Richards said the government frequently has agreed to low
franchise fees in exchange for promises by concessionaires to make
park improvements. But he said those improvements usually allow a
concessionaire to make more money without directly enhancing the
park.
   In one instance, the government sought to promote sales of
Indian crafts by not including revenue from such sales in the
formula used to determine a franchise fee.
   The concessionaire sold $45 million worth of crafts over four
years at profit margin of 122 percent, said Richards, estimating
the government lost $2 million under the fee arrangement.

<HEAD>Five Companies to Develop Plane 25 Times Faster Than Sound</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HARRY F. ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five companies that usually compete for
aerospace business will work as a team, with government permission,
to develop an airplane 25 times faster than sound.
   ``They will work as if they were one,'' said Lee Beach, NASA's
director of the National Aero-Space Plane project. ``Each company
will share in all of the data, which is a very different kind of
thing than they are used to.''
   The goal is to have the NASP, known as the X-30, flying by
1996-1997 if the project gets a final go-ahead three years from
now. The X-30 will be a research vehicle to develop technologies
for planes of the future.
   ``This is not a full-scale development program for an
operational vehicle,'' Beach said. ``We are talking about a
technical demonstration program.''
   The X-30 would fly directly into orbit from a conventional
runway, unlike the space shuttle, which requires a booster rocket
and an expendable fuel tank for launching. It also would be capable
of long-range hypersonic travel within the atmosphere.
   The five companies forming the new National Contractor Team are
General Dynamics, McDonnell Douglas, Rockwell International,
Rockwell's Rocketdyne Division and Pratt &amp; Whitney.
   They agreed in January to end competition for developing the
plane and modify fixed-price contracts with the government to
reflect the team concept. A joint NASA-Department of Defense
announcement Thursday confirmed the government's acceptance of the
plan.
   ``The normal mode of operation would be to select an engine and
an airframe,'' said Beach. ``You would basically select a winner
from competing designs and, therefore, good ideas from nonselected
designs would not be used. In this mode, the good ideas will be put
on the table and have the potential for inclusion in the final
design.''
   Barry J. Waldman, formerly vice president and program manager of
Rocketdyne's NASP efforts, was selected by the team as program
director. Rockwell International will be the lead contractor.
   Congress appropriated $254 million for the NASP project this
year.
   The immediate task, said Rockwell's Erik Simonsen, is to come up
with a single configuration for the aircraft by the end of the
year. ``Right now, Rockwell's model, McDonnell Douglas' and General
Dynamics' are slightly different shapes. Their task is to come up
with a single shape,'' Simonsen said.
   Antitrust issues raised by the teaming are not expected to be a
problem since the X-30 is not a commercial product and not for
profit.
   Earlier this week, in an unrelated action, the French aircraft
builder Aerospatiale announced an agreement to set up ``an
international study group'' to look into the feasibility of
building a successor to the aging supersonic Concorde.
   Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, along with the German Airbus, will
cooperate with Aerospatiale and British Aerospace in a study for a
Concorde replacement.
   Aerospatiale has said if the study finds a new supersonic model
is feasible, a faster, larger and longer-range plane than the
Concorde could be in the air by the year 2005.

   Budget negotiators are beginning a two-week
break, divided by party lines over the amount of deficit reduction
they need and pointing fingers over who created the problem in the
first place.
   Bush administration officials and congressional leaders held
their fourth negotiating session on Thursday, a three-hour meeting
that participants described as argumentative.
   Once again, they made no final decisions. They continued
debating how much they should cut from next year's deficit, which
the administration now concedes could approach $206 billion.
   In January, Bush said the shortfall appeared to be $100.5
billion and under control. The White House has blamed an uncertain
economy and the ever-expanding problems of the savings and loan
industry for the bleaker budget picture.
   The day's talks were overshadowed by the latest round of
battling between President Bush and congressional Democrats, this
time over who is responsible for the deficit mess.
   Bush complained that it is Congress' fault, telling reporters at
the White House that Congress holds the power to pass spending and
tax bills.
   ``People understand the Congress bears a greater responsibility
for this,'' he said.
   Democrats wasted little time in firing back.
   ``He is one of the first presidents in recent history to say
Congress has greater power than the presidency to determine the
course of the economy,'' said House Budget Committee Chairman Leon
Panetta, D-Calif. ``I don't think anyone believes that.''
   Others renewed their call for a presidential speech detailing
the deficit problem and explaining why new taxes or spending cuts
may be necessary.
   Bush rejected that demand again Thursday. Democrats contrasted
his decision with the Soviet Union's announcement of a referendum
on the direction of their economy.
   ``The leadership of the Soviet Union is coming forward now and
talking about their economic problems,'' said Senate Budget
Committee Chairman James Sasser, D-Tenn. ``I would hope the leaders
of this country would do likewise.''
   In their closed-door meeting Thursday, negotiators spoke of
seeking some combination of new taxes and spending cuts that would
yield $45 billion to $60 billion in savings next year, participants
said.
   They want to save between $425 billion to $600 billion over the
next five years.
   Democrats want the higher range of savings, while Republicans
prefer the lower amounts. Both parties realize that the higher the
savings, the more likely it is that new taxes will be needed _
threatening Bush's campaign pledge to shun higher levies.
   The administration also released new figures Thursday that
further boosted the possible federal cost estimate of shoring up
the savings and loan industry.
   They showed that over the next six years, the bailout could cost
from $102.5 billion to $154.7 billion.
   A day earlier, Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady told Congress
the government will have to borrow between $90 billion and $130
billion to clean up the S&amp;L mess. Unlike Brady's figures, the
numbers released Thursday included the government's interest costs
for borrowing the funds.
   The administration insisted for more than a year that the bulk
of the problem could be resolved with the $50 billion in borrowing
authority included in the S&amp;L bailout bill.
   The talks will resume in early June, when lawmakers return from
their Memorial Day recess.

   Leaders of a House subcommittee accuse federal
aviation officials of discriminating against air traffic
controllers who take drugs to control diabetes or AIDS.
   The FAA told a hearing of the subcommittee on the Civil Service
on Thursday that controllers who take the drugs insulin or AZT pose
a hazard to air safety in the sensitive job of monitoring and
directing air traffic.
   A diabetic football player with a $4.4 million contract, a young
air traffic controller who has been removed from the screens and a
prominent doctor who runs a diabetics center all disagreed.
   A controller who is being treated with AZT, after testing
positive for the AIDS-causing HIV virus, also said outside the
hearing that he feels fit to continue behind the radar screens. AZT
is the only drug authorized for anti-viral treatment of acquired
immune deficiency syndrome.
   Reps. Gerry Sikorski, D-Minn., subcommittee chairman, and
Constance Morella, R-Md., ranking minority member, said they would
draft a letter urging the FAA to change what they consider a
discriminatory policy.
   Sikorski said the FAA decided to exclude insulin users last
December after a false rumor that a controller on the drug had
collapsed on the job.
   He said of the FAA policy to exclude AZT users, ``Lord knows
what vague rumors that decision was based on.''
   ``That's discrimination,'' Sikorski added.
   ``It's discrimination for the sake of safety,'' testified
William Hark, an FAA medical specialist.
   Darlene Freeman, FAA deputy associate administrator for aviation
standards, said the agency has given administrative jobs to 22
controllers who take insulin or AZT.
   She said controllers who take insulin could suffer episodes
called hypoglycemia, which can include faintness, palsy, confusion,
visual disturbances or weakness.
   Sikorski criticized the FAA for its refusal to allow Washington
Dulles International Airport controller Ron Wilkinson to continue
on the job after he began taking AZT last year.
   Wilkinson said the FAA suggested this week that he get a desk
job at Dulles. He said he is under a doctor's care in Florida and
believes he should be given a position there as a controller.
   Hark said no final action had been taken to disqualify
Wilkinson, who he said went on leave in July to seek treatment for
``an undisclosed illness.''
   The FAA official said the agency was re-examining its policy on
AZT in light of a recent reduction in the dosage given patients,
but probably would not change it without at least several months of
study.
   Dr. William Reiter, a Fort Lauderdale, Fla., AIDS expert who is
treating Wilkinson, has said that tests of patients on AZT showed
no significant sleepiness, dizziness or other problems.
   Minnesota Vikings quarterback Wade Wilson, who spoke for the
American Diabetes Association, said his diabetes had not affected
his performance as a player or his $4.4 million, four-year contract.
   Stephen J. Pazarena, 26, said he has lost pay and any chance for
advancement because he takes insulin. He works in an administrative
job at the Indianapolis Air Route Traffic Control Center.
   ``The FAA is a flying circus,'' he said. ``Now they've got me
wasting away upstairs in an office.''
   Dr. Robert Ratner, director of the diabetes center at George
Washington University, said the risk of a heart attack in
controllers with mildly high blood pressure is greater than the
chance of an insulin user having hypoglycemia, although blood
pressure is not used to exclude controllers.

   A street that runs beside Mickey
Spillane's old elementary school now bears the author's name.
   One of Spillane's grade school teachers showed up for the
dedication ceremony attended by the writer Thursday, along with
dozens of young students from the Theodore Roosevelt Elementary and
Middle schools.
   ``At least it's paved,'' the 72-year-old Spillane said of Mickey
Spillane Way, which runs by the schools. ``If it wasn't paved, I

   Spillane, who has written more than 40 detective novels
featuring the hard-boiled private eye Mike Hammer, said he attended
grades three through six at Roosevelt Elementary.
   The writer's family moved to Elizabeth in 1918, when he was a
month old. He lived here until his senior year of high school, he
said.
   Spillane has been living in Murrell's Inlet, S.C., where he's
finishing a novel and rebuilding his home. The novel was lost and
the house destroyed last fall in Hurricane Hugo.

<TEXT>
   Manuel Noriega's defense lawyers, saying they were
betrayed by the U.S. attorney's office in a botched deal to pay
their fees, have threatened to reveal the details of the CIA's
secret payments to their client.
   A prosecution-sponsored proposal to have the government pay the
lawyers as much as $350 an hour fell apart Thursday when a federal
judge said he could find no legal basis for the arrangment.
Opponents had called it a ``legal slush fund'' for Noriega.
   As their part of the deal, Noriega's defense had agreed to
postpone a showdown over $11 million they say their client received
from the CIA and other intelligence agencies. That agreement is now
void, lead defense attorney Frank Rubino said after a hearing on
the issue.
   ``They couldn't take the heat that came out over this
agreement,'' Rubino said of the U.S. attorney's office. ``Now we
shall litigate every dime Gen. Noriega's been paid by this
government, and we shall litigate it as publicly as possible.''
   U.S. District Judge William Hoeveler said both sides must now go
back and litigate the issue of $20 million seized by federal
authorities in 27 bank accounts around the world, and said he
wanted a quick resolution. The defense is demanding some of the
money to pay expenses they estimate could reach $5 million. They
say the government has hired two dozen attorneys to prosecute their
client, and is prepared to spend almost $40 million.
   Hoeveler has questioned the prosecution's contention that the
frozen money is all drug-related, and their reluctance to turn any
of it over to Noriega.
   The judge said the final word was his.
   ``I will take the government, the U.S. attorney, off the hot
seat _ I'll make the decision,'' the judge said.
   Noriega, who agreed to the arrangement in court Monday, is
jailed in the Metropolitan Correctional Center outside of Miami. He
was brought to Florida after surrendering to U.S. troops in Panama
on Jan. 4, two weeks after they invaded the country.
   The former Panamanian leader is charged in a February 1988
indictment with turning Panama into a way station for Colombia's
Medellin drug cartel, accepting $4.6 million in bribes to allow
them to process and ship cocaine to the United States through his
Central American country.
   The deal for the government to pay Noriega's legal fees began to
unravel when outside attorneys questioned the plan. They said
federal law only sanctions the payment of $75 an hour to one
attorney for a defendant.
   Michael O'Kane, a defense attorney for Noriega co-defendent
Daniel Miranda, fired off a letter to the U.S. comptroller of the
currency. O'Kane argued that the government has no right to pay the
excess fees, nor to accept an assignment from Noriega to pay back
the Treasury.
   The conservative Washington Legal Foundation also wrote the
judge to complain.
   ``Congress simply did not appropriate a legal slush fund to be
paid to Noriega's attorneys _ I'm sorry,'' said Paul Kamenar,
executive director of the foundation.
   The deal also was denounced on the floor of Congress.
   U.S. Attorney Dexter Lehtinen denied at Thursday's hearing that
his office ever specifically approved government payment of fees
over the $75 per hour.
   ``There is not actually any agreement here, or deal,'' Lehtinen
told Hoeveler. But he suggested the judge could salvage the
arrangement by declaring the fee limit law unconstitutional because
it violated Noriega's right to a fair trial.
   Hoeveler expressed doubt about taking such action. He said the
collapse of the deal ``has brought us back to square one.''

million in so-called ``soft money'' in the past 16 months, with the
biggest donations coming from major labor unions and scores more
from major corporations and rich Americans.
   The Democratic National Committee released a list of 550 soft
money donors on Thursday, a month after the Republican Party
allowed access to a list of 4,200 donors who gave $7 million to its
soft money accounts last year.
   Neither party has to disclose its soft money receipts because
the money is kept in accounts that do not have to be reported to
the Federal Election Commission. But both have faced public
pressure to list the donors because of criticism of the loophole by
public interest groups.
   Also Thursday, the FEC released a report detailing fund raising
and spending by the two parties in the first 15 months of the 1990
cycle _ January 1989 through March 1990. That analysis, based on
reports to the FEC from the three major fund-raising arms of each
party, showed the GOP with a clear edge.
   Soft money is used by the political parties to pay for
administrative costs, voter registration and other election
activities in targeted areas. In the 1988 presidential election,
the parties raised a combined $40 million in such funds, tapping
labor unions and corporations for huge donations that cannot
legally be made directly to campaigns. Most of the money is
funneled through state parties, making it difficult to track in a
comprehensive fashion.
   Critics of the soft money loophole contend it allows otherwise
illegal campaign contributions by unions, corporations and banks
and gives the wealthy too much political influence. Curbs on soft
money is among the issues being debated as the Senate considers
changes to election financing laws. Party leaders contend the money
helps pay for legitimate party-building activities.
   The DNC said it raised $2.4 million for its soft-money accounts
last year and $1.2 million through the end of April this year. A
party statement said 52 percent of the soft money spent last year
went to candidates and related election programs. Twenty-nine
percent went to administrative costs and 19 percent for new
fund-raising costs.
   Virtually every major labor union made hefty donations to the
DNC soft-money accounts, with the United Autoworkers, United
Steelworkers, National Education Association and American
Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees giving $100,000
or more.
   Allied Signal, Archer Daniels Midland, AT&amp;T, General Electric,
General Dynamics, Shell Oil, Phillip Morris, Upjohn and Warner
Communications were among the major corporate donors to the
Democrats. Prominent Democratic fund-raiser Monte Friedkin of
Florida was listed as a $100,000 donor. More common were individual
donations in the $1,000 to $15,000 range; some were as low as $200.
   The separate FEC report covered the first 15 months of the 1990
election cycle _ January 1989 through March 1990.
   The FEC said the Republican National Committee, the National
Republican Senatorial Committee and the National Republican
Congressional Committee raised a combined $112.6 million in the
15-month period.
   That was more than four times the $24.4 million raised during
the period by the three Democratic groups, the DNC, the Democratic
Senatorial Campaign Committee and the Democratic Congressional
Campaign Committee.
   The three GOP groups spent $99.6 million in the 15 months,
compared with $24.2 million in spending by the three Democratic
groups. Much of the spending was for 10 special congressional
elections held in the past year. Contests this November involve 34
Senate seats and all 435 House seats.
   Democrats are incumbents in most of this fall's races. The
Republicans' fund-raising advantages is offset in many cases by the
incumbents' individual fund-raising powers.
   Of the $112.6 million raised in 15 months, the GOP groups gave a
combined $1.17 million to House and Senate candidates, while the
Democrats donated $940,103 to congressional candidates, much of it
for special elections.
   The Republican groups gave $1.1 million to other party
organizations, primarily to state parties for special elections,
compared with slightly more than $500,000 in Democratic donations
to state party organizations in the same period.
   The GOP groups reported combined debts of $1 million, virtually
all of it owed by the House campaign group. The Democratic groups
owed $1.7 million, of which $1.3 million was reported by the
party's cash-strapped House campaign body.

<HEAD>Roh Urges Japan to Own Up to Dark Side of Its History</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY THORSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   South Korean President Roh Tae-woo told lawmakers
today that Japan must openly deal with the dark side of its history
if it wants to present a new image to Asians.
   ``There must be true understanding between our two peoples on
the basis of truth so that a bright future can be ensured for our
bilateral relationship,'' Roh said in the first speech by a South
Korean president to a joint session of Japan's Diet, or parliament.
   Roh also urged the Japanese to improve the status of roughly
680,000 Koreans living in Japan, most of whom are the descendants
of people brought from Korea as forced laborers before and during
World War II.
   ``Only when they become able to live in this land as good
neighbors of the Japanese and without artificial inconvenience,
will both our peoples feel genuine friendship to each other,'' Roh
said.
   Although many of the Koreans living here were born and raised in
Japan, few have taken the trouble to be naturalized as Japanese
citizens. As aliens, they must be fingerprinted and are not
eligible for many jobs, such as teaching in schools or the civil
service.
   Roh was on the second day of a state visit to Japan that is
aimed at healing the still-festering wounds from Japan's 1910-45
colonization of the Korean Peninsula.
   On Thursday, Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu and Emperor Akihito
offered the most explicit apologies ever for Japan's harsh colonial
rule. Akihito expressed ``deepest regret'' for Japanese actions,
and Kaifu acknowledged that Japan had ``inflicted unbearable
suffering and sorrow'' on the Korean people.
   Although Japan and South Korea normalized their diplomatic ties
25 years ago, relations between the two countries are still cool.
Roh is only the second Korean head of government to visit Japan
since 1965.
   Roh contrasted Japanese-Korean relations with the close ties
developing among European countries that were bitter enemies in
World War II.
   Roh said a ``psychological barrier'' prevents the development of
friendship and bilateral ties. He poignantly recalled how Japanese
colonialists refused to allow Korean schoolchildren to use their
Korean names and native language.
   The South Korean president praised Japan's stunning economic
recovery after the war and development of parliamentary democracy.
   ``Japan has now become a new country, much different from what
it used to be,'' Roh said.
   But he added, ``When Japan fully opens up to history and the
world, it will be able to present a new image, especially to
Asians.''
   Roh held forth a vision of a future with a tunnel under the
125-mile Korea Strait that would link Japan and Korea and permit
people from both countries to journey together ``on a tour of
friendship to link continents and make all humanity one family.''
   In South Korea, many Koreans were not willing to accept the
words of regret expressed by the emperor and other Japanese leaders.
   Thousands of radical students staged violent anti-Japanese
protests Thursday, burning Japanese flags and demanding that Roh
cancel his ``humiliating'' visit to Tokyo. Elderly citizens have
staged noisy protests for 10 days in front of the Japanese embassy.
   ``It's not enough to satisfy the people's sentiments toward
Japan. We can hardly accept Akihito's remarks as an apology,'' said
Park Yung-nok, a vice president of the opposition Party for Peace
and Democracy.

   Relatives of a gunner's mate blamed by Navy investigators for an
explosion that killed him and 46 other sailors aboard the USS Iowa
hailed the decision to reopen the probe.
   ``My son is not guilty. The Navy was barking up the wrong
tree,'' Earl Hartwig said of the announcement Thursday.
   The Navy concluded last September that the April 19, 1989, blast
probably was sabotage by Hartwig's son, Clayton Hartwig, who Navy
investigators claimed was disgruntled over his treatment.
   The Pentagon said it was reopening the investigation and
ordering an end to the firing of 16-inch guns aboard all
battleships after the ``unexplained ignition'' of bags of gunpowder
during testing at Sandia National Laboratory in New Mexico.
   ``I consider this a total victory,'' said Hartwig's sister,
Kathy Kubicina.
   The Navy's announcement came the day before the General
Accounting Office, Congress' watchdog agency, was to release a
report on the investigation and conclusions. The GAO report, based
on testing at Sandia, was expected to show there was no conclusive
evidence that a detonator device was placed between gunpowder bags,
igniting gunpowder and creating a huge fireball at one of the
ship's gun turrets.
   Hartwig's father said the GAO report forced the Navy to reassess
its earlier conclusion.
   ``It seems awful strange that the Navy pulled this now that the
lab findings are coming out,'' said Hartwig, who was a Navy
gunner's mate in World War II.
   Families of other Iowa victims also were overjoyed with the
Navy's decision to reopen the probe, but said there is much work to
be done to determine what happened aboard the Iowa.
   ``I hope they go back to square one on the investigation,'' said
Darleen Schelin, whose son, Geoffrey, was killed. ``I hope the
investigation will be unbiased.''
   The Navy report drew protests from some of the families of the
dead sailors. The relatives demanded that the investigation be
reopened.
   Nancy Lewis, whose son, Richard, died in the blast, kept the
families in touch about the investigation through a newsletter. She
said many families had doubts about the stability of the powder
used to fire the Iowa's massive guns.
   ``This is a tremendous sense of relief that we may finally get
to the bottom of this,'' Ms. Lewis said. ``I have always felt that
there was something unsafe.''
   Ms. Kubicina has said green fragments found in some of the Iowa
corpses would prove the gunpowder was old and more likely to
explode. The gunpowder on the battleship had been stored on barges
in extreme heat and had started to turn green, a sign of
deterioration, she said.
   Critics of the Navy investigation have contended the Navy
ignored numerous possible causes of the explosion in order to find
a scapegoat.
   Sharon Ziegler, whose husband, Reginald, died in the explosion,
said he had complained several times about conditions in the turret
where the blast occurred.
   ``I think it was an accident waiting to happen,'' she said.

<HEAD>Food Subsidies To Be Removed, Prices To Go Up in July</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The government says that as part
of its market-oriented reform it will cut all food subsidies and
raise the prices of about 30,000 items in July by an average of
nearly 25 percent.
   Annual food subsidies totaling $1.68 billion in a yearly budget
of $26.3 billion will be diverted to other sectors of the economy,
Price Office chairman Vladimir Dvorak told reporters Thursday.
   Communist authorities kept food prices steady and relatively low
during their 41-year rule that ended last year after massive
pro-democracy demonstrations.
   Dvorak described the removal of food subsidies as ``a
preparatory step to the rectification of price relations in our
economy ... another step in gradual transition to market economy,
convertible currencies and world prices.''
   The measure will increase the prices of about 30,000 items by an
average of 24.6 percent, effective July 9. Dvorak said the increase
will hit milk and dairy products by as much as 51 percent, while
prices of meat will go up only moderately.
   The official said meat prices will remain partially subsidized.
   Labor Minister Petr Miller said the country intends to fully
decontrol its prices by the first of next year. Miller also
confirmed energy costs and other consumer goods prices will rise as
much as 30 percent in autumn.
   A 25 percent rise in the price of cigarettes and a doubling of
bus and rail fares were announced Wednesday.
   Asked about inflation in Czechoslovakia, which is currently
estimated at 7 percent to 8 percent annually, Dvorak said the price
increases this year are likely to take that figure above 10 percent.

<HEAD>Group Advocates Open Adoption Records, Open Adoption</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A push to open adoption records is ill-advised
and may violate the privacy rights of people trying to put a
painful past behind them, according to a group representing more
than 100 adoption agencies.
   ``We believe in protecting the privacy of those that want to
maintain their privacy, while allowing those that want to have
contact to have it,'' said Mary Beth Seader of the National
Committee For Adoption.
   ``Women who made adoption plans 20 years ago may not want to see
that child,'' Seader said Thursday. ``Some adopted people also do
not want to have that contact.''
   Seader was reacting to a renewed effort by another group
involved in the adoption issue, the American Adoption Congress, to
change laws to allow adoptees, birth parents and adoptive parents
access to adoption records.
   Historically, adoption records have been sealed. But Alabama,
Alaska and Kansas have enacted laws opening them.
   Several other states, including California and Pennsylvania, are
considering such measures, said Kate Burke, president of the
Washington, D.C.-based adoption congress. It represents some 50,000
people who have been personally involved in adoption.
   Adoption groups estimate that about 5 million people in the
United States are adopted.
   Burke said open records make sense from a medical standpoint,
enabling adoptees to be aware, for example, of illnesses they may
have inherited.
   Perhaps more importantly, she said, is the ``gut-level need'' to
know.
   ``What most adoptees feel is that gnawing need to know where
they came from,'' Burke said. ``Adoptees grow up ... frequently
with a lack of self-esteem and other problems. The reunion is a
very healing process for adoptees, as well as birth parents.''
   The National Committee For Adoption, also based in Washington
and representing 146 non-profit adoption agencies, favors a mutual
consent registry, like those currently in place in 22 states,
Seader said.
   Seader's group favors an exchange of medical information between
adoptees and their birth parents. That exchange is possible
``without sharing identifying information,'' she said.
   The American Adoption Congress said a registry doesn't go far
enough.
   ``The bond to that birth mother is always there,'' said Ken
Watson, chairman of the Child Welfare League of America's national
adoption task force. ``We can separate the child legally, but we
cannot cut that psychological bond.''
   ``The best we can do when we put a child in an adoption is to
allow the child and the adoptive parents to respect that bond and
to support that child in re-exploring it,'' he said.
   Some group members believe the adoption process itself should be
changed, and relations among birth parents, adoptive parents and
the adoptee should be encouraged.
   Seader disagrees.
   ``That kind of relation denies what adoption is all about,'' she
said. ``Adoption is creating a family for a child. We need to
protect the integrity of that family.''
   The conference, which opened Thursday, was being attended by
about 500 people.

<HEAD>Scientists Isolate Immune Cells Involved In MS</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Scientists are looking at a type of immune
cell that attacks nerve tissue in the brain and may be a cause of
multiple sclerosis.
   Separate research in Boston and Stanford University isolated two
types of immune cells found in the brain tissue of MS victims.
   Understanding the role these cells play in the crippling disease
could help in developing a way to control it.
   In a study published today in the journal Science, Dr. David A.
Hafler of Harvard and the Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston
said his team isolated from the blood samples of multiple sclerosis
patients a unique immune cell that attacks myelin, the nerve tissue
that is destroyed in the MS disease process.
   Hafler, in a telephone interview, said the specific immune cell
was isolated in high numbers from the blood of five multiple
sclerosis patients, but was found in only very small numbers in the
blood of five people who do not have MS.
   The researcher said it is very likely that other types of immune
cells also are involved in the MS disease process, but that the
cell found by his team may have a major role.
   Another research group, led by Dr. Lawrence Steinman of Stanford
University, reported on Thursday in the journal Nature that they
had isolated another type of immune cell from the brain tissue of
patients with MS. The cells found in the brain studies by
Steinman's group are different from the cells isolated by the
Hafler group from the blood of MS patients.
   But both of the cells found by the two groups are parts of the
immune system called T-cells. Normally, T-cells are a vital to the
body's defense against infection. The body makes them by the
millions and each type is equipped with a type of receptor, a
protein that is attracted to specific viruses or bacteria.
   In MS, it is believed that for some reason not now understood,
the receptors on some T-cells are attracted to myelin. This causes
the T-cells to attack the nerve tissue as if it were an enemy of
the body. Such an action, called an autoimmune response, leads to
the crippling of MS.
   Hafler said that by identifying the specific T-cells that play a
role in MS, researchers could design drugs that would cause these
enemy T-cells to be killed or inactivated.
   Eventually, said Hafler, his group will propose tests in MS
patients of a medication that would specifically attack the
V-beta-17 T-cells found by his group.
   ``Whether or not this will cure the disease will have to await
the clinical trials,'' he said. Most likely, said Hafler, ``We
would have to identify all T-cells involved in MS and learn how to
turn all of them off or eliminate them before the disease could be
absolutely controlled.''
   Such clinical trials are still years away, said Hafler.
   Dr. Stephen Reingold, the vice president for research at the
National Multiple Sclerosis Society, said studies by the Hafler and
Steinman groups are ``complementary'' and are important advances in
the battle against MS.
   ``The impact of these studies is that as we get closer to an
understanding of this disease, there is a possibility of developing
a specific immunotherapy'' that would block the nerve tissue damage
caused by the enemy T-cells, said Reingold.
   Hafler said the Brigham and Women's Hospital research team took
blood samples from MS patients and isolated T-cells that react to
the protein that is in myelin. The group then tested this group of
T-cells to identify the specific amino acid chains in each cell.
   The researchers found that in 36 of 64 T-cell samples from MS
patients there was a T-cell type called V-beta-17.
   A similar study on blood from people without MS found that only
9 percent of the T-cell samples contained the V-beta-17 amino acid
chain.
   Hafler said that the finding suggests that many people may have
the V-beta-17 cells in their bodies, but that something causes the
immune cells ``to turn on'' and start attacking brain or nerve
cells.
   ``If you don't have any T-cells in you that recognize (react to
the) brain, then you will never get MS,'' he said. ``If you do have
T-cells that can recognize brain, then something else has to happen
for the disease to develop. We haven't identified yet what that
is.''
   Coauthors of the Science paper with Hafler were Howard L.
Weiner, K.W. Wucherpfennig, Kohei Ota, Noriaki Endo, J.G. Seidman
and Anthony Rosenzweig of the Harvard Medical School.

   National Safety Council officials are preparing
for their grim duty this weekend _ counting the number of motorists
who are killed on the highways.
   Last year, 441 died and 20,000 were injured over the three-day
Memorial Day weekend.
   This year, at least 380 people will die on the nation's roads
between 6 p.m. Friday and 11:50 p.m. Monday, the council estimated
Thursday.
   ``Additionally, 18,000 to 23,000 people may suffer disabling
injuries,'' said Lisa Grady, spokeswoman for the Chicago-based
council.
   ``The National Safety Council also would like people to follow
our safety rules: Don't drink and drive, and if you do drink, use
the designated driver program.
   ``Plan plenty of travel time. It's better being late than not
arriving at all. Remember to use safety belts and put small
children in approved child car-seats,'' said Ms. Grady.
   The council estimates that more than 12,000 lives could be save
each year if everyone used safety belts, she said.

<HEAD>Labor Party Wins Parliamentary Special Election, Unveils New
Platform</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOOTLE, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Britain's opposition Labor Party, riding
high in the polls against Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, easily
retained its seat in this Labor stronghold in a parliamentary
special election, results showed today.
   The vote Thursday came as the party unveiled a moderate platform
that marked the climax of a major policy shift.
   In the balloting Labor's Mike Carr polled 75 percent of the vote
in Bootle, a town 155 miles northwest of London that encompasses
Liverpool's docks.
   James Clappison, the candidate for the governing Conservative
Party, polled 9 percent, or 3,220 votes, compared to Carr's 26,737.
The Liberal Democrats took third place with 3,179 votes going to
their candidate John Cunningham.
   The special election was held to fill the seat held by Allan
Roberts, who died in March.
   The Labor Party, led by Neil Kinnock, has led opinion polls for
more than a year, sometimes by as much as 20 points, and the party
hammered the Conservatives at local government elections earlier
this month achieving a huge 11 percent swing against the government.
   The popularity of Mrs. Thatcher and her Conservative Party has
been weakened by high interest rates, rising inflation, which hit
an eight-year high of 9.4 percent in April, and an unpopular new
local government tax paid by all adults, which replaces property
taxes paid only by homeowners.
   The next election does not have to be held until mid-1992. There
is speculation, however, Mrs. Thatcher may call one in March 1991
if her policy of using high interest rates to squeeze inflation is
working by then.
   Labor's new 20,000-word platform unveiled Thursday incorporated
most of Mrs. Thatcher's stringent curbs on labor unions, envisaged
private investment in state enterprises, and imposed an income tax
ceiling of 50 percent. Under the last Labor Party government in
1979, the top income tax was 83 percent.
   On defense, the socialist party promised large, but unspecified,
cuts in spending, and said money saved would be diverted to social
programs. The party had already ditched its vote-losing policy of
unilateral nuclear disarmament.
   Among other issues, the new document dropped Labor pledges to
reverse with minimum compensation Mrs. Thatcher's sales of state
enterprises, ranging from British Airways to the national telephone
network.
   The policy document pledged only to return to state ownership
the latest sold utility, the water supply network.

   Deer have become such frequent visitors
to this city that they inspire jokes. A broadcaster was making fun
of the creatures on a morning talk show when one came crashing
through the studio window.
   The bleeding doe thrashed around the office and destroyed some
computer equipment at station WXLP before collapsing Thursday. It
was carried out on a stretcher for veterinary care.
   News Director Katy Cole said announcers Ian Case and Jeff
Roberts were discussing the antics of deer on their daily humor
program, ``Bulletins from the Boondocks,'' when the deer made its
unfortunate entry.
   ``When the announcer mentioned the word deer, I heard a big
crash,'' Ms. Cole said. ``The deer just came from nowhere. I
thought someone was breaking into the station.''
   Police and animal control officials heard the broadcast and
rushed to the studio.
   ``It saw its reflection in the window and jumped through the
window.'' said Phil Vroman of the Scott County Humane Society.
``Once it got in, it couldn't find its way out.''
   The deer should recover from its wounds, Vroman said.
   Deer have been venturing into the city of about 100,000 people
recently and some have been hit by cars. The radio's studios are on
one of the city's busiest downtown streets.

<HEAD>Audit Accuses Catholics Of Misusing Food For Poor In India</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Auditors say Roman Catholic Relief Services in
India misused food for underfed women and children, but church
officials say they are guilty of weak management but not theft, The
Washington Post reported today.
   The audit accused Indian Catholic Church officials of using
short-weighing measuring devices for distributing food, creating
false lists of food recipients, improperly using donations to
support commercial businesses and deliberately concocting
inaccurate records to hide abuses.
   India's Catholics receive about $25 million in food from the
United States each year. The U.S. Agency for International
Development asked the auditing firm of Price Waterhouse to
investigate the program.
   The audit report concludes that the food program was ``operated
in an atmosphere whereby the commodities could be misused with
little risk of detection,'' the newspaper said in a dispatch from
New Delhi.
   The audit report did not, however, charge the bishops, priests
and nuns involved with outright theft, and no individuals were
identified.
   Unidentified sources were quoted as saying the audit was not
broad enough to determine whether the church officials had
deliberately stolen large amounts of food.
   However, Catholic Relief Services, based in Baltimore, was
criticized for not closely monitoring the distribution of U.S.
government food and inadequately overseeing the activities of the
Indian church officials.
   The newspaper said U.S. officials were reviewing whether the
church group should be allowed to continue as a subcontractor in
the U.S. AID food program in India, the largest effort of its kind
in the world.
   Catholic Relief Services sharply disputed the audit findings,
claiming in a letter to AID that the conclusions were based on
``factual errors, speculation and, at times, misrepresentation,''
and that the auditors had unfairly extrapolated the violations of a

   ``We admit the management is weak, but I don't think there is
widespread abuse in the program,'' James deHarpporte, chairman of
the Catholic Relief Services program in India, was quoted as
saying. ``Do you think Mother Theresa is corrupt?''
   Unidentified U.S. officials were quoted as saying they believed
problems uncovered by Price Waterhouse were serious and widespread.

<HEAD>Senate Confirms Ambassador to Nicaragua</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Senate early today confirmed President
Bush's nomination of Harry W. Shlaudeman to be the U.S. ambassador
to Nicaragua.
   Shlaudeman, 64, will be the first ambassador to represent the
United States in that Central American country since the leftist
Nicaraguan government expelled Ambassador Richard Melton and seven
other diplomats in 1988. The ouster stemmed from a dispute over
whether the U.S. officials were encouraging anti-government
activists.
   The new ambassador was confirmed on a voice vote moments after
the Senate gave final approval to a supplemental money bill that
includes $300 million as the first installment in a new U.S. aid
program for Nicaragua.
   Shlaudeman, a career diplomat, is the State Department's top
expert on Latin America. He was called out of retirement last year
to act as the department's liaison to the anti-Sandinista Contra
rebels.
   In his new role, he will represent the United States before the
newly elected government of President Violeta Chamorro, who led an
opposition coalition that defeated Sandinista President Daniel
Ortega in elections in February.
   Previously, Shlaudeman has been an ambassador to Argentina,
Peru, Brazil and Venezuela.
   The Bush administration has been eager to establish closer ties
with Nicaragua since the change in governments.
   The country's new leaders face serious problems, including a
ruined economy, an entrenched Sandinista bureaucracy and reticence
on the part of the Contras to lay down their arms and demobilize.

<HEAD>Fans Line Up Early for `Back to Future' Trilogy Screening</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   ``Back to the Future'' fans lined up early
for a back-to-back-to-back film trilogy as the latest time-travel
adventure officially opened the summer film sweepstakes.
   To promote ``Back to the Future Part III,'' opening nationwide
in about 2,000 theaters today, Universal Pictures organized special
marathons in 19 cities Thursday night.
   Patrons could watch all three ``Back to the Future'' films for a
single admission.
   At the Pacific Cinerama Dome in Los Angeles, fans started lining
up at 2 a.m. Wednesday, and more than 100 devotees, wearing all
sorts of ``Back to the Future'' paraphernalia, were in place six
hours before the trilogy was set to begin.
   At the sold-out showing at the Cineplex Odeon National in New
York City, some customers bought 10 to 20 tickets at a time. The
line of customers, stretching along Broadway and down 43rd Street,
was entertained by a group of stilt-walkers outfitted like cowboys.
   ``Back to the Future Part III,'' starring Michael J. Fox as time
traveler Marty McFly, is set in the Old West.
   Universal reported early queues at theaters showing the trilogy
in Orange County, Santa Barbara, Sacramento, San Francisco, as well
as Portland, Ore., Denver, Chicago, Dallas, St. Louis and Toronto.
   ``I was first in line to see `Back to the Future' and I was
second in line to see `Back to the Future Part II,''' said Adam
Mast, 21, who was first in line at the Cinerama Dome.
   ``There are more inside jokes in the `Back to the Future' films
than most people realize,'' he said. ``I've seen the first two
dozens of times and I always find something new to laugh at.''
   Last year's ``Back to the Future Part II'' opened last November
and generated domestic box-office revenues of $110 million.
   ``Back to the Future Part III'' finds McFly and Doc Brown
(Christopher Lloyd) arriving in 1885 to stop Doc's murder. Early
reviews of the film have been mixed.
   In last summer's film season, which spans from Memorial Day
weekend to Labor Day, a record $2.04 billion worth of tickets were
sold.
   ``Back to the Future Part III'' is not considered to be this
season's most anticipated title. Hollywood odds makers say Arnold
Schwarzenegger's ``Total Recall,'' Eddie Murphy's ``Another 48
HRS.'' and Tom Cruise's ``Days of Thunder'' should lead the
box-office charts at summer's end.

<HEAD>Dollar Sharply Lower; Tokyo Stocks Up</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar declined sharply against the yen Friday,
while the key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange continued to rise.
   The dollar closed at 150.05 yen, down 1.38 yen from Thursday's
close of 151.43 yen. After opening at 150.45 yen, the currency
ranged between 149.90 yen and 150.85 yen.
   The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues rose 482.13
points, or 1.49 percent, closing the week at 32,793.88. The Nikkei
index gained 135.24 points on Thursday.
   In the bond market, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds edged higher to 88.30 points as of 3 p.m.
(2 a.m. EDT), up from Thursday's close of 87.76. The yield fell to
6.890 percent, down from the previous day's 7.010 percent.
   Currency dealers said the dollar's retreat followed its
overnight decline in New York, where it finished at 151.15 yen,
down from 151.45 yen on Wednesday.
   Masaki Shikada, a dealer with Fuji Bank, said the dollar moved
upward slightly during early trading on buying by institutional
investors, including life insurance firms.
   ``But the dollar then stayed at a 150.70-.80 yen range'' in the
absence of fresh news, Shikada said.
   Stocks moved up gradually in a favorable reaction to the yen's
appreciation against the dollar, traders said.
   ``Issues centering on large-capital stocks attracted buyers'
attention, encouraged by the high yen,'' a Nomura Securities
analyst said on condition of anonymity.

<TEXT>
   Government and business leaders said today
President Bush's decision to continue favorable trade status for
Beijing is welcome news for this British colony that relies heavily
on commerce with China.
   Trade and Industry Secretary John Chan called Bush's move
Thursday ``very good news from Hong Kong's point of view.''
   In a statement, he noted that the business community and
government had engaged in intensive lobbying during the past few
weeks to explain how termination of special trade status would harm
Hong Kong, which will return to Chinese sovereignty in 1997.
   Seto Fai, honorary president of the Chinese Manufacturers'
Association, said the U.S. decision will help prevent Hong Kong
from sliding into economic recession.
   ``Hong Kong is already experiencing a slowing of economic growth
and could not afford to stand a blow from the United States,'' he
said. ``Now, we have at least another year to breathe.''
   The news drew little response from the stock market, which had
rallied sharply earlier in the week on expectation that Bush would
renew China's most-favored-nation trade status.
   The blue-chip Hang Seng Index today rose 20 points in early
trading before finishing the morning session virtually unchanged at
3,049. The market had gained 130 points in the preceding five
sessions, largely on anticipation of the U.S. decision.
   Most-favored-nation status gives Chinese exports to the United
States the lowest possible tariffs. Denial would send tariffs
rising sharply on about $12 billion in annual imports from China of
textiles, toys and other products.
   Much of the Chinese exports to the United States are produced in
joint-venture factories set up by Hong Kong investors in southern
China. About 70 percent of Chinese products sent to the U.S. market
are shipped through Hong Kong, Seto said.
   ``Hong Kong nowadays shares an inseparable economic link with
China. Any threat to sanction China economically would inevitably
drag us into it,'' said Carson Chan, assistant director for the
Federation of Hong Kong Industries.
   He said termination of the special trade status for China would
have resulted in at least 20,000 Hong Kong people losing their jobs
in industries such as trade, transportation and banking.
   Hong Kong's economy already is experiencing high inflation and
sluggish growth, with the gross domestic product forecast to rise
only 3 percent this year.
   Industrialists expressed confidence that the U.S. Congress will
not reject Bush's decision, despite opposition by some lawmakers.

   A pair of sneakers covering the feet found
in a shark's belly helped the family of a police officer
tentatively identify him as the victim.
   Relatives of officer Thomas Caron, shown a picture of the
sneakers, said he was wearing similiar shoes when he and two
companions left April 27 to fish in the Atlantic, said Dr.
Margarita Arruza of the county Medical Examiner's office.
   The office is working on a positive identification, she said.
   The crew of the Patricia Anne, a fishing boat out of Daytona
Beach, reported Wednesday that while gutting a 8- to 10-foot-long
tiger shark they found the shoes containing the feet, Coast Guard
radioman Jon Morris said Thursday.
   Caron and a companion, Robert Duncan, have been missing since
their boat capsized April 27 about 12 miles southeast of Mayport,
on the coast off Jacksonville.
   The body of a third man, police officer Robert Jones, was
recovered off the Georgia coast. An autopsy showed he had drowned.

   A hit-and-run victim who crawled into
the brushy median of a freeway and spent four days and nights lying
there is making a remarkable recovery, doctors said.
   Juan Francisco Camacho, 20, was returning home to a northern San
Diego County migrant camp May 5 after looking for work when he was
hit while walking along the inside shoulder of Interstate 5. It was
shortly after dark.
   Camacho, an undocumented worker who has lived in the United
States since 1986, said he never heard the car coming.
   ``The only thing I heard was music _ American music,'' Camacho
said from his bed at Scripps Memorial Hospital, where he was in
fair condition Thursday.
   As the driver sped away, Camacho crawled into the median,
shrouded by thick oleander bushes, to avoid being hit again. ``I
crawled so I could get beneath a tree,'' he said. ``I was rolling
and dragging myself.''
   Doctors said the car apparently hit Camacho from behind,
shattering his midsection.
   ``When we got him, he was in shock from loss of blood and his
blood pressure was down to about 60, which is about half the normal
pressure,'' said Dr. Edgar Gamboa, a trauma surgeon at Scripps.
   ``He was dehydrated, he had a dislocated knee and his pelvis was
cracked open like a book. There was bacteria and infection from all
the dirt in his wounds.''
   As cars whizzed past Camacho the first night and day, he shouted
for help in Spanish and rattled a small tree branch overhead to try
to attract attention. He had nothing to eat, but soon noticed a
water sprinkler nearby, and crawled to it so he could sip water to
stay alive.
   As the days passed, Camacho said, he entered a daydream state.
He recalled talking to himself and imagining that the telephone
wires overhead were answering back.
   Eventually he lost the feeling in his legs, and on the fourth
day, decided to crawl back out by the road to become more visible.
   A northbound motorist spotted him during rush hour that
afternoon and called 911 from Camp Pendleton.
   ``I was shocked,'' Gamboa said. ``It's really incredible that
he's still here. Even if (trauma victims) get treatment within the
first hour, many people still die from these types of injuries.''
   ``Even after we got him in the hospital, we half expected him to
die for the first two days.''
   Doctors say Camacho survived probably because he was in good
physical condition and none of his vital organs were crushed _ that
and his determination to live.
   ``How long could he have survived? There's no way of telling,''
Gamboa said. ``I guess it was up to him.''
   Camacho's recovery is expected to take several months. He
wonders who hit him and why they didn't stop, but says he's not
angry about it.
   ``For me, it's not a problem. I just thank God I'm better,''
Camacho said.

<HEAD>Government Proposes Center Lights for Trucks, Vans</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of accidents and injuries could be
prevented by a proposed federal rule that would require new light
trucks and vans to be equipped with center high-mounted rear brake
lamps, says the government's top highway safety official.
   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration proposed the
regulation Thursday, four years after requiring the rear lamps on
new cars.
   ``The extra light is effective because it signals just one
thing: braking action,'' said Jerry R. Curry, administrator of the
agency. ``It can't be confused with rear lights or turn signals. It
is in the direct line of sight of the following driver, forming a
triangle with the other two brake lamps.''
   The regulation would require the lamps on all light trucks and
vans by the 1993 model year, giving manufacturers time for design
changes, Curry said.
   A similar requirement imposed on cars in 1986 has been
successful, he said, pointing out that cars with the center brake
lights experience 17 percent fewer rear-end collisions than those
without.
   The proposed regulation will be printed in the Federal Register,
opening a 60-day public comment period after which the agency will
decide what action to take.
   The law would apply to multipurpose passenger vehicles,
including mini-vans and sport-utility vehicles, pickups and other
trucks under 10,000 pounds, and small buses.

<HEAD>Congress May Soon Tell DC How to Spend its Federal Payment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   If Sen. Phil Gramm has his way, Congress will
soon take the unprecedented step of dictating how the District of
Columbia spends part of its annual payment from the federal
government.
   Gramm told Mayor Marion Barry during a hearing on the city's
budget Thursday that he wants to earmark part of the annual payment
for the police department.
   City police overtime patrols, particularly in the city's upscale
Georgetown section, were recently threatened by funding shortages.
   ``I'm not into trying to play mayor ... but something is wrong
when people are being notified to stay out of Georgetown at night
because we don't have police officers,'' the Texas Republican said.
   Congress, which has review power over all city law, has never
told the city how to spend any of the annual payment it receives
from the federal government.
   Under Gramm's plan, an unspecified portion of the proposed
$430.5 million payment would be spent on the police department.
   Sen. Brock Adams, who chairs the Senate Appropriations Committee
that oversees the district, also told Barry he was concerned about
the city's spending priorities.
   Congress has been increasingly critical of the city's crime
situation over the past two years, during which the district has
set two annual murder records and witnessed dramatic increases in
drug-related crime.
   Congress last year gave the city $31.7 million extra to help
fight the drug war.
   Barry assured the panel the district will use money from the
special payment to cover the unexpectedly high overtime costs.
   ``No one in this city is more concerned about public safety than
I am,'' said Barry, who is awaiting trial on drug possession and
perjury charges.

<HEAD>Marine Group Says Trash Still Major Problem on U.S. Beaches</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Plastic trash is still littering beaches and
choking wildlife because boaters ignore laws that forbid dumping
garbage overboard, says the Center for Marine Conservation.
   ``Some people are annoyed by the trash, some are surprised, and
most don't seem to care,'' spokeswoman Kathy O'Hara said at a news
conference Thursday, where the floor was littered with plastic
bottles, cups and bags similar to trash collected during the
group's second annual national beach cleanup.
   The center said the Gulf of Mexico, the Pacific Northwest and
the Chesapeake Bay suffered most from offshore-generated waste
because of the large volume of commercial and recreational boating
in those waters.
   Two-thirds of the trash picked up by the center's 65,000
volunteers was plastic _ eating utensils, lids, cups and tampon
applicators.
   ``Plastic trash not only lasts longer, it kills wildlife,''
O'Hara said.

<HEAD>Woman Granted Embryo Custody Now Wants to Donate Them</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A woman who won a bitter custody battle
for seven frozen embryos says she no longer wants them and will
donate them to her fertility clinic, with hopes someone else can
use them.
   Mary Sue Stowe described her decision in papers filed with the
Tennessee Court of Appeals. Her ex-husband, Junior Lewis Davis, has
appealed a ruling in the couple's divorce case last September that
granted her temporary custody over the embryos.
   Blount County Circuit Judge Dale Young had ruled that ``life
begins at conception'' and the embryos deserved the same legal
status as children would have in custody disputes between their
parents.
   Young's ruling prevented Mrs. Stowe from using the embryos until
the appeals were settled.
   ``She does not wish us to discuss her decision,'' Mrs. Stowe's
lawyer, Kurt Erlenbach, said Thursday. ``It's a very private matter
and a very hard decision. She made it within the last few weeks.''
   Mrs. Stowe, who remarried in December, had testified that the
embryos represented her best chance to have a child. Davis said he
did not want the embryos used without his consent.
   Mrs. Stowe, who moved from Maryville to Titusville, Fla., after
the ruling, needs the court's consent and the consent of her
ex-husband to donate the embryos, Erlenbach said, adding he
believed Davis opposed donation.
   Oral arguments on Davis' appeal were scheduled for June 6.
   Telephone calls to the home of Janet Mayfield, one of Davis'
attorneys, went unanswered late Thursday and his other lawyer,
Charles Clifford, has an unpublished home telephone number.
   The embryos were produced through in vitro fertilization in
December 1988 after the couple's continued efforts to have children
resulted in Mrs. Stowe having five tubal pregnancies.
   After two of nine fertilized eggs were unsuccessfully implanted,
the others were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at the
Knoxville clinic. They will have been frozen two years in December,
Erlenbach said.
   Doctors have told Mrs. Stowe she has a 52 percent of giving
birth from one of the seven embryos, Erlenbach said.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar dropped sharply against the yen today,
while the key index on the Tokyo Stock Exchange advanced for the
fourth consecutive day.
   The dollar closed at 150.05 yen, down 1.38 yen from Thursday's
finish of 151.43 yen. After opening at 150.45 yen, the currency
ranged between 149.90 yen and 150.85 yen.
   ``The dollar still remains under selling pressure from
overseas,'' said Tsuyoshi Yamamoto, a dealer with the Industrial
Bank of Japan.
   Yamamoto said the day's trading was focused rather on West
German mark cross trading with the yen, in which market players
bought the yen and sold the mark. But he said that affected
yen-dollar trading.
   Yamamoto and other dealers said the dollar's retreat followed
Thursday's remark by Sidney Jones, U.S. assistant treasury
secretary, that the dollar was undervalued against all currencies
but the yen.
   On the stock market, the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected
issues rose 482.13 points, or 1.49 percent, closing the week at
32,793.88.
   A total of 1 billion shares changed hands in the market's first
section, up from Thursday's 600 million shares.
   The index's advance followed an 855.58-point gain from Tuesday
through Thursday.
   Declining long-term interest rates, rising bond prices and the
high yen all combined to contribute to pushing up the Nikkei index,
said a dealer with Nippon Kangyo Kakumaru Securities who spoke
anonymously.
   ``A low rate of return in bonds would bring funds into the stock
market,'' the dealer said.
   In bond dealings, the price of the benchmark No. 119 10-year
Japanese government bonds moved higher to 88.46 points as of 4 p.m.
(3 a.m. EDT), up from Thursday's close of 87.76. The yield fell to
6.875 percent, down from the previous day's 7.010 percent.

<TEXT>
   A company whose truck plowed into a
school bus in an accident that killed 21 students has agreed to pay
$72 million to 16 of the victims' families.
   Settlements completed Thursday call for Valley Coca-Cola
Bottling Co. Inc. to pay $4.5 million per death, lawyers for the
families and the company said.
   Parents will receive the bulk of the money, but some of it will
go to trust funds valued from $50,000 to $250,000 established for
30 surviving brothers and sisters, lawyers said. Some of the
siblings won't receive trust money until they reach the age of 25.
   In February, a family that lost a child in the wreck settled its
wrongful death lawsuit with the company for $1.5 million.
   That leaves four wrongful death cases unresolved. Mike Mills, an
attorney for Valley Coca-Cola, said two of them ``will be closed
out shortly.''
   Attorneys packed the small courtroom where District Court Judge
Juan Partida approved the settlements Thursday. The settlements
were taken before the judge because siblings receiving trust funds
are minors.
   ``They (the families) are not going to want for many things,''
said attorney Abel Orendain, who was appointed to represent
8-year-old Omar Garcia, brother of deceased Abdon Garcia Jr., 14.
``At least all of these kids will get educated.''
   Mills declined to say how many of the soft drink concern's
insurance companies would share in paying the damages.
   A truck owned by Valley Coca-Cola ran through a stop sign and
knocked the school bus into a water-filled pit in the Hidalgo
County city of Alton on Sept. 21, 1989. Twenty-one students
drowned; 60 escaped the submerged bus and survived.
   Also pending are injury cases filed against Valley Coca-Cola by
some of the survivors, rescue workers and other bystanders.

<HEAD>Keating Files New Claim in Thrift Takeover</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHOENIX (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Charles Keating Jr. has filed a new $300 million
lawsuit claiming that federal banking regulators waged a vendetta
against him, destroying American Continental Corp. and his personal
fortunes.
   In the claim filed Thursday in U.S. Claims Court in Washington,
Keating blamed his financial collapse on Resolution Trust Corp.'s
takeover of his troubled Lincoln Savings and Loan Association.
   It is the second suit Keating has filed in the claims court.
   ``They have caused my family and I to lose everything we own,''
Keating said. ``I think we're entitled to get it back.''
   The claim also names as plaintiffs Keating's wife, Mary Elaine,
their children and grandchildren, and two top American Continental
executives.
   The Phoenix financier and lawyer plans to handle the case
himself, keeping the cost of the lawsuit down. Keating said he had
not argued a case since the early 1960s.
   The corporation also has a $575 million action against the
government in the claims court. A hearing on that lawsuit is set
for June 5.
   Keating said the $300 million action represents 50 percent of
the plaintiffs' stock in American Continental, which he contends
was ruined by the government's April 14, 1989, takeover of Lincoln.
   The day before federal regulators seized the Irvine,
Calif.-based thrift, Keating and his management team at American
Continental filed a petition in U.S. Bankruptcy Court for Chapter
11 protection from the company's creditors.
   Keating maintains the government violated a constitutional
protection against taking private property without due process.
   David Barr, a spokesman for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.,
said the agency had not seen the claim and could not comment.
   Keating also has filed a third civil lawsuit, asking U.S.
District Judge Stanley Sporkin of Washington to return Lincoln to
his management. Final arguments in that case have been set for June
19.
   He said his new lawsuit likely could not be resolved until
Sporkin rules in the civil action against the government to reclaim
Lincoln.
   A Senate Ethics Committee is investigating five senators who met
with savings and loan regulators on Keating's behalf in March 1987,

<HEAD>Massive Survey Reveals Sex Life Changing in China</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   A new sex survey conducted in China says
attitudes have liberalized in the past decade of openness to the
outside world, but that there is a great need for sex education.
   ``I believe that Chinese concepts of sex are in a process of
change,'' said Liu Daling, whose Shanghai Sex Sociological Research
Center conducted the survey. ``We've broken through some of the old
concepts, but not completely.''
   The June 4 military crackdown on dissent last year almost killed
the survey before it got under way, as foreign investors withdrew
funding and some leaders said the project's timing was
inappropriate.
   But Liu solved the funding crisis by dipping into his own
savings. By August, hundreds of volunteers were interviewing
married couples, students and sex criminals in 15 provinces of the
world's most populous nation of 1.2 billion.
   Interviewers often faced resistance from a population not used
to discussing details of their private lives.
   ``They didn't understand why someone would want to ask that kind
of question: How many times do you have sex with your husband each
month,'' Liu explained. ``They'd say, 'Why do you want to ask this?
Are you kidding?``'
   While most of the respondents were given a written form to fill
out and deposit in a sealed box to maintain secrecy, illiterate
peasants were questioned verbally.
   By October, about 23,000 usable questionnaires were completed,
and what the respondents had to say indicated a change of attitudes
for what long has been a prudish society.
   As an example, more than half of the married respondents said
they do not limit sexual intercourse to only the missionary
position, which Liu described as a departure from past practice.
   The survey also found 54 percent of city dwellers and 44 percent
of peasants do not object to extramarital affairs, attitudes that
Liu said would have been espoused by only a small minority just 10
years ago. Nearly 15 percent of married city women who were
questioned acknowledged having one or more affair.
   Liu, who was in Hong Kong this week to attend a seminar on
sexology, said in an interview that 90 percent of the married
respondents expressed some degree of satisfaction with their sex
lives.
   About one-fourth of village women and one-third of city women
said they often experienced ``pleasant feelings' during
intercourse, and many others said they had such feelings
occassionally.
   Up to one-third of the surveyed women said they did not miss
their spouses when they left home for an extended period of time.
About one-third of respondents also said they thought their lives
would be better had they married someone else.
   The survey also found that while Chinese couples typically have
sex four to seven times a month, it can be a painful and
perfunctory experience.
   About 45 percent of city women and 37 percent of peasant women
said they experienced pain during intercourse often or sometimes,
says Liu. One-third of respondents in villages and 17 percent in
cities said they usually spend less than one minute on foreplay.
   ``It's a little like animals,'' said Liu. ``They start as soon
as they hit the bed.''
   Communist China's state-controlled media has yet to report
details of the survey, although a brief Xinhua News Agency report
noted that the findings show sex education should be strengthened
and the spread of pornography has ``seriously affected the healthy
growth of young people.''
   Among the many campaigns launched in the past year by China's
conservative leadership has been a crackdown on pornography and
prostitution, which have become particularly widespread in the
country's relatively open coastal regions.
   Liu applauds the anti-pornography sweep but says sex education
is even more important for society to develop properly.
   Besides learning the basics such as contraception, he believes
Chinese should be exposed to a ``moral education'' on how to
maintain healthy and fulfilling relations between the sexes.
   ``I think we should adopt a normal and natural attitude to a
normal and natural thing,'' he said.
   Precisely how much support government authorities are willing to
provide sex education and sexology is not clear, particularly in
the current conservative climate.

<HEAD>Government Claims It Recaptured Strategic City</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Liberia claims its forces have
recaptured a strategic port seized by rebels earlier in the week, a
Liberian radio station said.
   Rebels fighting since December to topple President Samuel Doe
had taken Buchanan, the country's main port for iron ore exports,
after attacking it Sunday.
   ELWA radio, a missionary station monitored in Abidjan, said the
government on Thursday announced it drove the rebels from the city.
   `When contacted, President Doe ... confirmed reports of the
successes made by the government troops in Grand Bassa county,''
the radio said.
   It added, ``The president said that the victory of the Liberian
soldiers is a clear indication that the armed forces are on their
way to wiping out the remaining rebels in Liberia.''
   No independent confirmation of the government claim was
immediately available. The government said nothing about casualties
in the latest fighting.
   Rebels of the National Patriotic Front, led by former Doe aide
Charles Taylor, invaded Liberia from its northeastern border with
Ivory Coast on Dec. 24. Taylor's National Patriotic Front forces
has vowed to take Monrovia, the capital and largest city, and
topple Doe's government.
   Government troops had been unable to halt the advance of the
rebels, who attacked the southern Atlantic Ocean port of Buchanan,
its third-largest city with about 30,000 residents, on Sunday.
   The capture of Buchanan, 88 miles from Monrovia, was a major
victory for the rebels.
   It is the country's main exit point for iron ore, which earns
more than 70 percent of the country's foreign currency. The mine
itself, in northern Nimba County, was captured by rebels last week.
   The government only confirmed Buchanan had been captured
Wednesday, saying it would retake the town but wanted to minimize
casualities.
   In another development, some wives of 10 men in Monrovia who
were beheaded by unidentified attackers were quoted Thursday as
linking the killings to the guerrilla war.
   The Daily Observer newspaper quoted the wives as saying their
husbands, many of them soldiers, were all Gio and Mano, the two
dominant tribes in Nimba County. Many rebels are also Gio and Mano.
   International human rights groups and survivors have accused
government troops of massacring hundreds of Gio and Mano civilians
in the battle against the rebels. The insurgents are accused of
slaying Mandingos and Krahns, the tribe of Doe and most of his
officers.
   The United States, Liberia's main foreign aid donor, condemned
the violence Thursday.
   ``We call on officials entrusted with the law to vigorously
pursue the perpetrators of these heinous crimes and to bring them
to justice under the rule of law,'' said State Department
spokeswoman Margaret Tutwiler in Washington.
   U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they
were especially disturbed of reports that some rebels had been
executed.
   The fighting has prompted an estimated 250,000 Liberians to flee
their homes. Many have taken refuge in neighboring Guinea and the
Ivory Coast.
   Many Americans have left the country, though there has been no
official evacuation. The U.S. Embassy presence has been reduced by
80 percent, the U.S. officials said.

   Nine tornadoes hurtled across central
Kansas, derailing a freight train, destroying homes and injuring at
least four people, authorities said.
   The National Weather Service also reported six tornadoes in
Wyoming, two in Montana and one in South Dakota on Thursday.No
deaths were reported in any of the twisters.
   Four oil field workers spotted a tornado near Bushton from atop
an oil rig and tried to outrun it in a car, but the twister won,
throwing them into a farm field and rolling their automobile
several times, Barton County Sheriff Jim Daily said.
   ``As the tornado was coming it just about beat us to death with
dirt,'' said one of the injured workers, Leland Hamby. He said he
shut the rig down and got in the car ``and the next thing I know I
was in the field.''
   Rescue workers cut the four men out of the car. They were taken
to the Central Kansas Medical Center in Great Bend where they were
listed in good condition early today with cuts and bruises, said
Teddy Williamson, nursing supervisor.
   A tornado derailed 88 of 107 cars on a Missouri Pacific Railroad
freight train just west of Bushton, which is about 160 miles west
of Topeka. None of the train crew members were injured.
   ``I was doing 45 when I started putting on the brakes. We never
did see a tornado,'' said the train's engineer, C.H. Copke. ``It
hit us out of the blue.''
   Ida Gassoway said she was working in her yard near Bushton when
she heard a twister coming, ran into her wood-frame house and laid
down in a closet, covering herself with some blankets.
   ``And then the first thing I knew I was moving,'' said Mrs.
Gassoway, who suffered a broken foot and scratches. ``When I
finally realized where I was at, I was out of the house and out
past the porch.''
   The tornado ripped her garage off its foundation and leveled her
small house.
   Downed power lines closed an eight-mile section of Kansas 4
between Claflin and Bushton for three hours. Great Bend resident
Nolan Howell said he counted at least a dozen heavily damaged or
demolished farms between those two towns.
   ``We've got a very large amount of damage,'' said Travis
Kershner, a dispatcher for the Barton County Sheriff's Department.
   Tornadoes also destroyed a farm near Lorraine, about eight miles
northeast of Bushton, and a mobile home near Lindsborg, about 30
miles east of Bushton, authorities said. No injuries were reported
in either incident.
   Harold Winnie, district manager for KPL Gas Service in
Hutchinson, said at least 900 customers were temporarily without
electrical and gas service in the area.

<HEAD>Gallery Asks For Dismissal in Mapplethorpe Case</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Defense lawyers asked a judge to dismiss an
indictment against an art gallery showing photographs by the late
Robert Mapplethorpe, saying the gallery is immune from Ohio
obscenity laws.
   The lawyers on Thursday also asked Hamilton County Judge David
J. Albanese to dismiss the charges on grounds that prosecutors
unfairly singled out the Contemporary Arts Center gallery and its
director, Dennis Barrie.
   Marc Mezibov, who represents Barrie, said that even if seven
photographs cited in the indictment are found obscene, Ohio law
exempts material exhibited for a ``proper purpose'' by artistic and
educational institutions.
   ``Do you think the U.S. Supreme Court would buy that?'' Albanese
asked during a three-hour hearing.
   ``Oh, absolutely,'' Mezibov said. ``What these laws are all
about is an attempt to eliminate commercial, hard-core pornography.
The CAC is not in the profit-making business. They are an
educational institution.''
   Senior assistant city Prosecutor Frank Prouty disagreed.
   ``The issue here is not their status. The issue is whether what
they displayed is obscene,'' he said.
   Albanese did not say when he would rule on the defense request
or the contention that prosecutors singled out the gallery.
   At least some of the pictures in the indictment are available in
books at the University of Cincinnati and on display at the
Cincinnati Art Museum, said H. Louis Sirkin, who represents the
Arts Center.
   ``I'm not here to get these institutions in trouble. I'm here to
point out that law enforcement officers were well aware that the
material was available,'' he said.
   The arguments by Mezibov and Sirkin came after Albanese let the
city amend the indictment to add references to U.S. Supreme Court
obscenity and child pornography standards.
   The judge granted Prouty's request that the indictment allege
that the two pictures featuring children in the 175-photograph
exhibit include a ``lewd exhibition or graphic focus on genitals.''
   Albanese also agreed to have the indictment allege that five
other pictures depicting sex acts meet Supreme Court requirements
that obscene material violate community standards, depict clearly
offensive sexual conduct and lack artistic value.
   ``It's clear that the state can amend that charge so long as ...
the defendants have a chance to prepare for a trial,'' the judge
said.
   Barrie and the gallery are charged with pandering obscenity and
using children in material involving nudity. If convicted, they
face $6,000 in fines and Barrie faces six months in jail.
   Their lawyers had argued that the indictment accused them of no
crime, referring only to depictions of sex acts and nude children,
which are not automatically obscene.
   Albanese also rejected a defense request to see a transcript
from the county grand jury that returned the charges April 7.
   Defense lawyers said the indictment doesn't indicate whether
grand jurors were told of Supreme Court standards that pictures
found to have artistic value can't be ruled obscene.
   Albanese refused to violate the traditional confidentiality of
the grand jury, noting that a county Common Pleas Court judge had
reviewed the transcript before refusing a similar request last
month.

   Subway gunman Bernhard Goetz says one of the men
he shot more than five years ago is faking the extent of his brain
damage.
   Goetz, who is being sued by the injured man, Darrell Cabey, for
$50 million, held a news conference Thursday on the steps of City
Hall and passed out videotapes that he said prove Cabey can
function normally.
   He said he would provide evidence today at a hearing in state
Supreme Court, New York's trial-level court, that Cabey, though
paralyzed from the waist down by a bullet that shattered his spine,
is fully aware of the world around him.
   ``He is not a mental vegetable,'' Goetz said.
   One of Cabey's lawyers, Ronald Kuby, said he had seen Goetz'
videotape. ``The tape proves nothing but that Darrell knew what he
had for lunch and knew who the mayor of New York was on Dec. 27,''
Kuby said.
   ``The tape also shows that there is no depth too low for
Bernhard Goetz to sink,'' he continued. ``He harbors a murderous
and sadistic hatred for Darrell Cabey. He shot him at point-blank
range _ in the back _ after saying, `You don't look so bad; here's
another one.' He's crippled the young man for life, caused him
permanent brain damage.''
   Harry Katz, Goetz' paralegal, said he shot the eight-minute
videotape at the United Cerebral Palsy building, on East 23rd
Street and Lexington Avenue, by ``subterfuge, trickery or whatever
you want to call it.''
   Goetz, 42, shot Cabey, now 22, and three other youths with an
unlicensed gun on Dec. 22, 1984. Goetz said the teens surrounded
him on a subway train and were trying to rob him. The youths
claimed they were panhandling money for video games.
   Goetz was acquitted of attempted murder and assault charges but
was convicted of illegal possession of a gun and served 8{ months
of a one-year sentence. He is acting as his own lawyer in Cabey's
civil lawsuit.

<HEAD>Government Bans Three Neo-Nazi Publications</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   France says it is banning three neo-Nazi magazines
from West Germany that it says are racist and could cause violence
following two weeks of anti-Semitic incidents.
   In Thursday's order, Interior Secretary Pierre Joxe prohibited
distribution and sale of the small-circulation magazines, which are
translated into French for distribution to extreme-right groups.
   However, Joxe said the works ``threaten the public order because
of their apologies for Nazism, racism and anti-Semitism.''
   His authority to ban them comes under a 1939 law controlling
foreign publications.
   France has been ungoing a wave of protests and recriminations
since a Jewish cemetery in Carpentras was desecrated two weeks ago.
A corpse was mutilated and 34 tombs desecrated, and the case
remains unsolved.
   Since then, similar incidents have been carried out in France,
Israel, Canada and elsewhere.
   In the latest French legal action, a court in Poissy, west of
Paris, charged a 26-year-old man with painting anti-Semitic
graffiti on the doors of a vocational school.
   The messages, discovered Tuesday, were aimed at the school's
Jewish director.
   On Wednesday, a judge in Saint Herblain freed under court
supervision three skinheads charged with profaning 90 graves at a
Catholic cemetery in the eastern French village.
   Mayor Charles Gautier denounced the decision by Judge Gilles
Dubigeon. In a letter Thursday to Prime Minister Michel Rocard, the
mayor said the three suspects should have been held in jail while
awaiting trial.
   In another development, extreme-right leader Jean-Marie Le Pen
on Thursday criticized a court decision to fine him for referring
to the Nazi gas chambers as ``a detail of World War II history.''
   In a statement by his National Front party, Le Pen criticized
Wednesday's ruling as political persecution and an infringement on
his free speech rights.
   The court in Nanterre, outside Paris, ordered Le Pen to pay 18
cents to each of 11 organizations that filed suit against him after
the remark in 1987.
   Judge Lefoyer de Costil said ``freedom of expression ... has a
limit.'' He also ordered Le Pen to pay $720 to each of the groups
to cover legal fees.
   ``This decision only takes into account the interpretations of
my political enemies and not at all the explanations I provided,''
Le Pen said. ``This irreversible judgment is proof of political
persecution against me.''
   The 61-year-old politician has been increasingly ostracized
since the desecration of the cemetery at Carpentras.
   Le Pen, a deputy in the European Parliament, wants to expel
immigrants from France and enact laws to keep them out. He denies
repeated accusations of being racist or anti-Semitic.

<TEXT>
   The dollar continued to fall against the Japanese
yen in European trading this morning but held steady against the
West German mark. Gold was little changed.
   In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 150.05 yen, down 1.38 yen from
Thursday's finish. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 149.60
yen.
   ``The dollar still remains under selling pressure from
overseas,'' said Tsuyoshi Yamamoto, a dealer in Tokyo with the
Industrial Bank of Japan.
   Yamamoto said the day's trading was focused on sales of West
German marks to buy yen, and the dollar was caught in the cross
fire.
   Yamamoto and other dealers said the dollar's retreat followed
Thursday's remark by Sidney Jones, U.S. assistant treasury
secretary, that the dollar was undervalued against all currencies
but the yen.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Thursday:
   _ 1.6781 West German marks, up from 1.6780
   _ 1.4190 Swiss francs, unchanged
   _ 5.6460 French francs, up from 5.6445
   _ 1,231.00 Italian lire, up from 1,230.75
   _ 1.1835 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1853.
   The dollar was quoted today at 1.8872 Dutch guilders, up from
1.8740 guilders late Wednesday.
   In London, the British pound rose to $1.6920 from $1.6890 late
Thursday.
   Gold dealers in London fixed a recommended price of $366.35 per
ounce this morning, up from $366.25 bid late Thursday.
   In Zurich, where the market was closed Thursday, gold opened
this morning at $366.25 per ounce.
   Gold in Hong Kong dropped 51 cents an ounce to close at $367.83
an ounce.
   Silver bullion opened in London at a bid price of $5.21 an
ounce, down from $5.26 bid late Thursday.

<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Thousands of demonstrators chanting
``Down with Communism'' demanded the ouster of President-elect Ion
Iliescu in the largest anti-government protest since the first free
election in 53 years.
   The demonstration Thursday came four days after the election in
which Iliescu scored a landslide victory despite opposition claims
that he and other members of the National Salvation Front are
neo-Communist.
   The estimated 8,000 protesters demonstrated peacefully for about
seven hours in University Square in downtown Bucharest. About 600
people led by three black-robed Orthodox priests staged a
candlelight march to the television station late in the evening.
   The marchers were demanding that the government-run television
show a tape, which they claimed showed members of the National
Salvation Front dividing up top posts on Dec. 22, the same day
Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu fell from power.
   The Front, dominated by former Communists, has insisted it did
not form until after the revolution began. The demonstrators said
the tape showed that the Front actually existed some time before
Ceausescu's ouster and that its members took advantage of the
revolutionary chaos to grab power.
   The demonstrators said they planned to march to the television
again this evening because they arrived too late Thursday to
present their demands.
   Two dozen soldiers, supported by half a dozen armored personnel
carriers, were deployed around the TV Center in northern Bucharest,
the scene of some of the heaviest fighting in December's
revolution. About 200 soldiers in riot gear replaced the usual
police guard around the government's headquarters.
   With almost all the ballots counted from Sunday's election,
Iliescu had 85.2 percent of the vote in the three-way presidential
race. Radu Campeanu of the National Liberal Party received 10.6
percent, while Ion Ratiu of the National Peasant Party trailed with
4.2 percent.
   In another development, the General Prosecutor's office
announced Thursday that the final death toll among civilians and
soldiers in December's revolution was 1,038. It added that 2,000
people were injured in the clashes between revolutionaries and
Ceausescu loyalists.
   It was not clear whether the casualty figures included the
Securitate secret police and pro-Ceausescu loyalists.
   The death toll is way below estimates in the tens of thousands
offered by Romanian and foreign observers during the revolt.
Opposition activists suggest the Front deliberately exaggerated the
death toll at first in order to strengthen its position in the
revolution's early days.

<TEXT>
   A man prosecutors describe as a major
international heroin trafficker has been sentenced to more than 24
years in prison on federal drug charges.
   Mushtaq Malik, 41, whose defense included a claim that he was
double-crossed in a plot to kill Pakistan's former leader, told a
judge at his sentencing Thursday that he did not believe justice
had been done.
   ``It seems to me that being a poor man from a Third World nation
nobody's looking at my side,'' Malik told U.S. District Judge Frank
H. Freedman.
   Malik was convicted by a jury last November on charges of
importing heroin and conspiracy to import. Prosecutors alleged that
Malik arranged for a Jordanian man to bring $10 million worth of
heroin to the United States.
   An appeal was expected on Malik's behalf.
   At his trial, Malik testified that his involvement with an
accused drug dealer was merely an effort to track down a man he
said had double-crossed him in a plot to kill former Pakistani
President Gen. Mohammed Zia ul-Haq.
   A Pakistani official denied the assassination plot at the time
of the testimony.
   Malik did not say he was involved in a mysterious plane crash
that killed Zia on Aug. 17, 1988, several months after Malik had
been arrested.
   The judge sentenced Malik to two concurrent prison terms of 24
years and five months, with five years supervised release.
   At the sentencing, Assistant U.S. Attorney Kevin O'Regan asked
that Malik be sentenced to 30 years.
   ``Mr. Malik is an international narcotics trafficker of the
highest level. Only the most serious punishment is appropriate in
this case,'' O'Regan said.
   But Malik's attorney, Michael O. Jennings, asked the judge to
consider a lower sentence, saying that people who commit more
serious crimes do not get as long as 20 years to serve.

   Rain fell in the Midwest early today and tornado watches were
sprinkled with thunderstorms in parts of the Great Plains.
   Rain also fell in southern Florida and high winds buffeted the
northern Rockies again today.
   The first tropical depression of the year formed in the
northwest Caribbean and was expected to spread heavy rain across
parts of Cuba today.
   There was fair but cooler-than-normal weather again in the
Northeast.
   The Pacific Northwest also had fair weather early today, but
evening showers were forecast along the coast.
   Clear skies were over the Southwest and southern Rockies.
   A tornado watch was posted for early today in parts of Kansas,
Montana, Wyoming, South Dakota and Nebraska.
   A hot and humid Gulf current was to push northward into
Missouri. Thunderstorms were ahead of a cold front across the

<HEAD>Five More Boeing 737s Missing Pins on Steering Wheels</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Emergency inspections have turned up five more
Boeing 737 jets missing pins that help keep steering wheels in
place, a Boeing Co. spokesman says.
   That brings to seven the number of missing cotter pins spotted
on Boeing-made 737s within the last two weeks, said the spokesman,
Jack Gamble.
   The five jets reported Tuesday belonged to foreign carriers that
neither Boeing nor the Federal Aviation Administration would name.
   The FAA last week ordered U.S.-owned airlines to inspect
steering assemblies on 737 models 300, 400 and 500 that were built
over the past two years.
   The order came after a steering wheel came off in a co-pilot's
hands during a test flight of a 737-400 delivered to a West German
air carrier. The pilot immediately took control. The plane landed
safely, Boeing said.
   The plane's steering mechanism was later found to be missing
cotter pins. The second missing cotter pin involved a 737 parked on
Boeing's flight test line at Boeing Field in Seattle.
   The FAA said last week it has launched an investigation to
determine whether the problem is due to a breakdown in Boeing's
quality control.
   The cotter pin is fastened behind the nut in the nut-and-bolt
assembly that holds the steering wheel to the steering assembly in
the airplane cockpit. It is designed to prevent the bolt from
working loose, which could allow the bolt to drop out and the wheel
to come free.
   The nuts and bolts were tight on six of the seven planes found
to have missing cotter pins, Gamble said.
   A total of 378 airplanes qualified for inspection under the FAA
order. While the order applied only to U.S.-based airlines, Gamble
said foreign-owned airlines routinely act on such orders.
   The U.S. airlines were required to report by last Monday any
problems with steering assemblies and there were no reports, Gamble
said.
   Airlines were trying to determine why cotter pins were missing,
the Boeing spokesman said. It was possible that maintenance work
had been done and the pins had not been replaced, Gamble said.
   The 737 is the smallest jetliner made by Boeing, a twin-engine,
short-to-medium range plane produced at its plant in the Seattle
suburb of Renton.
   The model 300 can carry as many as 141 passengers, the 400 as
many as 159 passengers and the 500, the newest model, up to 122
passengers.

<HEAD>Ragtag Flotilla Commemorates 50th Anniversary of Allied Evacuation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUNKIRK, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Vessels large and small, many of them the
same ones that rescued hundreds of thousands of Allied troops from
the Nazi onslaught, made their way across the English Channel to
mark the 50th anniversary of the evacuation.
   Thursday's 10-hour crossing by the so-called ``Little Ships''
began a weekend of celebrations reuniting about 5,000 French and
British veterans _ some in their 90s _ who fled to England just
ahead of the advancing German army in 1940.
   The dozens of vessels in the flotilla hoisted the British naval
ensign and entered Dunkirk waters in formation Thursday afternoon
behind the frigate HMS Alacrity to be greeted by a throng of local
officials and well-wishers.
   ``It's a once-in-a-lifetime thing, I suppose,'' Hon. British
Consul to Dunkirk Sandy Baker said. ``They won't be able to do this
again 50 years from now.''
   Britain's Prince Philip, husband of Queen Elizabeth II, stood on
the Dover docks to give a royal send-off to 76 vessels reenacting
the World War II mission that rescued 338,000 troops off beaches in
northern France and Belgium before onrushing German troops.
   At the end of May 1940, tank-led German forces drove Allied
troops onto the beaches of Dunkirk and De Panne, Belgium, 20 miles
away, where they were trapped with their backs to the channel.
   On May 29 of that year, the British government appealed to
owners of all types of vessels to volunteer to help make up for the
shortage of troop transports, and amateur and professional sailors
raced across the channel in their boats to aid the Allies.
   Over the next seven days an armada of about 860 naval ships,
fishing boats and pleasure craft rescued almost 400,000 British,
French and Belgian troops under enemy fire.
   British coast guard boats on Thursday stood by to shepherd the
elderly fleet, which could only travel as fast as the slowest boat,
about 7 mph. In addition to winds and high seas, the boats had to
sail through the wakes of the ferries that frequently crisscross
the channel.
   About eight miles out, a boat that once carried Katharine
Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart in the Hollywood film ``The African
Queen'' began taking on water off Ramsgate.
   A rescue helicopter from a neary Royal Air Force base and a
lifeboat were sent to escort and tow the 30-foot steam-driven
vessel back to harbor.
   A Dover coastguard spokesman said four people were on board,
including the American owner of the boat, Jim Hendricks. Hendricks,
55, a hotel owner from Key Largo, Fla., said the system that pumps
water into the boiler quit working.
   ``It was much rougher than I expected, the waves were getting
pretty high,'' Hendricks said, adding, ``It was just too much for
her.''
   The three-man crew of the boat, which Hendricks purchased in
1982, said they were afraid the boat was going to overturn in the
rough channel.
   The flotilla, which will spend three days in the marine basin at
Dunkirk, included motor launches, cabin cruisers, Thames barges,
yachts, old lifeboats and a former torpedo boat. Many are the
original preserved craft that returned from the beaches in 1940
with thousands of expeditionary forces aboard.
   Events commemorating the rescue will include a parade, wreath
layings, lunches, parties and a prayer service in Dunkirk and in
nearby De Pannes.

   Catherine McCants believed her son was
gunned down in a grocery store parking lot because he was black and
dating a white woman.
   She was half right, investigators say. On Thursday, they charged
a prison parolee who ``just hated blacks'' with fatally shooting
21-year-old Darren Jessie on March 31.
   Mobile County Sheriff Tom Purvis said the man arrested, Daniel
Amos Pilot, did not know Jessie, Jessie's injured 17-year-old
friend, Joseph O'Cain, or Jessie's white girlfriend, Amanda Hicks.
   Pilot, 34, was charged with murder and attempted murder and
ordered held without bond.
   O'Cain was shot in the back and is partially paralyzed.
   Pilot was paroled March 12 from a state prison after serving
four years of a 12-year sentence for receiving stolen property,
said prison spokeswoman Debbie Herbert.
   ``In my opinion, it was a spontaneous, unprovoked, senseless act
of violence,'' Purvis said. ``If there was any provocation it was
merely the hatred in Pilot toward blacks.''
   It wasn't the interracial dating, the sheriff said, because
Pilot didn't know the victims or anyone in the store. ``They were
customers in the store,'' he said.
   Purvis said investigators determined that Pilot and a friend had
gone into a Winn Dixie grocery store in the mostly white surburb of
Theodore to buy beer. Pilot passed a car where Jessie and O'Cain
were waiting to pick up Ms. Hicks from work. They were listening to
the radio when the shots were fired.
   ``When they said he was killed in Theodore by a white man, I
knew it was race,'' Mrs. McCants said. ``He should get the chair.
They don't need to send him back to prison to live.''

   An explosion at a plastics factory forced
hundreds of people to evacuate their homes temporarily and sent up
to 14 people to the hospital with eye and skin irritation,
authorities said.
   Between 500 and 1,000 people were routed for several hours
Thursday by the accident at Sil-Tech Corp., which makes
silicone-based fluids, said police Sgt. James Knierm.
   Among those evacuated were people gathered for a golf tournament
near the plant, which employs about 10 people in this southeastern
Michigan town.
   Between 10 and 14 people were treated and released from Herrick
Memorial Health Care Center for eye and skin irritation,
firefighter David Ousterhout said.
   The fire was extinguished in about two hours, Ousterhout said.
   The cause of the explosion was under investigation.
   Bruce Van Wieren, a conservation officer for the Michigan
Department of Natural Resources, said no hazardous substances
leaked and smoke quickly dissipated.

<HEAD>Witness Tells of Meetings To Plan Drug Agent's Kidnapping</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   All four men on trial in the 1985 kidnapping
and torture-murder of a U.S. drug agent in Mexico attended one or
more meetings where the crime was planned, a witness testified.
   Hector Cervantes Santos, former security chief for a Guadalajara
drug cartel, testified that at one meeting, Mexican drug lord
Rafael Caro Quintero also suggested kidnapping John Gavin, then the
U.S. ambassador to Mexico.
   Cervantes, testifying Thursday through an interpreter, said that
at the time he was a bodyguard for Javier Barba Hernandez, a
Guadalajara lawyer and confidante of numerous drug traffickers.
   Ruben Zuno Arce, the brother-in-law of former Mexican President
Luis Echeverria, attended the meetings and supported the idea of
kidnapping Gavin, Cervantes said.
   Gavin was not kidnapped, but U.S. Drug Enforcement
Administration agent Enrique ``Kiki'' Camarena was abducted on Feb.
7, 1985, along with his pilot, Alfredo Zavala Avelar.
   Their bodies were discovered about a month later at a ranch 65
miles outside Guadalajara, Mexico's second-largest city.
   On trial in U.S. District Court for alleged involvement in the
slayings are Zuno; convicted Honduran drug kingpin Juan Ramon Matta
Ballesteros; Javier Vasquez Velasco, a Mexican citizen who also has
lived in the United States; and Juan Jose Bernabe Ramirez, a former
Mexican police officer.
   Cervantes testified that at the last of the four meetings, held
just days before Camarena's abduction, ``Don Ruben said he agreed
that the person should be picked up and (it should be) found out
how much he knew and who he was cooperating with.''
   The drug lords reportedly were incensed because Camarena's
undercover work had led U.S. and Mexican authorities to a desert
marijuana plantation, where they seized 10,000 tons of the drug
worth billions of dollars.
   In his testimony, Cervantes also implicated several former
Mexican police officials and Mexico City's current police chief,
Javier Garcia Paniagua.
   Matta's lawyer, Martin Stolar, challenged Cervantes' testimony.
``He's basically the butler who wandered in and out of meetings and
claimed to hear what was going on,'' Stolar said.
   Zuno's lawyer, Edward Medvene, has said Cervantes' testimony
should be viewed with skepticism because he didn't come forward
when the slayings occurred. He did not comment on Thursday's
testimony.
   DEA records show Cervantes has been a U.S. government-paid
informant since Nov. 24, 1989. He and his family were relocated to
the United States and have received more than $36,000 in DEA
payments since November, the records show.

<HEAD>Wildcat Rail Strike Widens; Cuts Off Baltic Coast</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DRUSILLA MENAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A wildcat rail strike spread today to
Gdansk and cut off all train traffic to the country's Baltic ports,
posing the most serious challenge yet to the Solidarity-led
government and its economic reform program.
   The Ministry of Transport said talks to resolve the walkout are
at a ``total impasse.''
   The strike began Sunday as a wildcat protest by workers
demanding higher pay. It has now received the support of the
one-time Communist-backed labor federation, which is challenging
Solidarity for support among workers.
   Solidarity chairman Lech Walesa canceled a trip to Scandinavia
today due to the labor crisis. In a reference to the rival
federation, Walesa said in a nationwide radio broadcast that
``demagogical forces'' were trying to exploit workers' legitimate
grievances in a game that could lead to ``civil war.''
   ``I hope that reason will win,'' he said in a midday radio
interview. ``The strikers should be given a way out of it with
honor because they are right.''
   But he said the route of strikes ``leads nowhere,'' even though
``I am unhappy and almost the entire society is unhappy.''
   Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki, a former Solidarity adviser
who became head of the East bloc's first non-Communist government
last summer, has said the strike could seriously damage Poland's
reform program.
   Railway workers at stations in the port city of Gdansk joined
the strike today, crippling the harbor where the Solidarity labor
movement was born during a 1980 shipyard strike.
   ``There is no access to the entire coast by train now,'' said
Transport Ministry spokesman Stefan Pozniak. ``So it's getting
really serious.''
   The ports handle most of Poland's coal exports, the country's
leading hard currency earner. In addition to Gdansk, the labor
dispute has paralyzed Szczecin, the country's busiest port, where
12 ships awaited unloading.
   A rail route linking Berlin with Gdansk through Szczecin was
blocked, as was freight from Czechoslovakia and Hungary en route to
the Polish ports, Pozniak said.
   Officials say ``thousands'' of the 400,000 workers employed by
the state-run railway are on strike, but have not given any
specific numbers for the strikers. About 50 railway workers are on
a hunger strike.
   Rail traffic to two dozen key junctions across northwest Poland
has been cut off, and the army was called in to move perishable and
essential goods.
   Mazowiecki appealed for an end to the strike at a local election
rally Thursday, warning it could ``destabilize'' the government and
discourage Western investors. The prime minister said there are
``other means of claiming one's rights in a state that is
democratic and no longer totalitarian.''
   Negotiations broke off Thursday when three of the four unions
which represent the railway workers demanded that the talks be
moved to Slupsk, the northwest city were the wildcat strike
committee is based.
   The government had refused to negotiate with the strikers
directly because they were not protesting within legal union
structures.
   But two branches of the OPZZ labor federation, the union created
by the Communists after they banned Solidarity in 1982, and a small
independent union stepped in to represent the strikers.
   The Solidarity union was the only one to agree to remain in
Warsaw for the talks. It has called the strike a ``strong warning''
for the government it helped create, but is urging the workers to
end the protest.
   In his radio interview, Walesa accused the OPZZ of manipulating
the strikers in a ``game that will solve nothing but may lead even
to a civil war.''
   The government has made no announcement about whether it would
send its negotiators to Slupsk.
   However, the government has firmly resisted granting the railway
workers the pay raise they are requesting, saying that making an
exception for one group of workers would unleash a torrent of
similar demands.
   The government says this could scuttle the ``shock therapy''
economic reform program it instituted on Jan. 1.
   The drive to create a market economy from the shattered
socialist system is built on cutting government subsidies to ailing
state-run enterprises, including the railroad. Pay raises have to
come from an industry's own resources.
   The strict wage controls, coupled with the raising of prices to
market levels, have reduced Poles' real incomes by an estimated 40
percent.
   The railway workers are demanding that their basic monthly
salary be raised to $8 above the average monthly salary of $79. The
strikers are also seeking the dismissal of railroad directors
installed by the former Communist regime who they say are
incompetent and hampering reforms.
   The government fired the Communist-appointed director of the
strike-bound Pomerania rail district in northwest Poland on
Thursday. Officials say interviews are under way for a new general
railway director and a restructuring plan for the railroad is being
drafted, including a new pay scale.

<HEAD>Serbian Authorities Order Expulsion of 17 Albanian Refugees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Serbian authorities have ordered the
expulsion of 17 Albanian refugees accused of provoking ethnic
unrest in the troubled province of Kosovo, official news reports
said.
   The Albanians, mostly the offspring of defectors who escaped
Albania's harsh Stalinist regime after 1945, were given 30 days to
leave Yugoslavia and find a new country in which to resettle, the
official reports said Thursday.
   The U.N. High Commission for Refugees in Belgrade, meanwhile,
denied reports that it had been formally notified of the expulsion
orders and would help the refugees find a country willing to take
them.
   ``The crux of the matter is whether these people formally have
the right to refugee status,'' Judith Kumin, an official of the
U.N. commission, said.
   She said that according to the 1951 U.N. Convention on Refugee
Status, which Yugoslavia has ratified, children of refugees are
automatically granted the same rights and cannot be expelled
``unless convicted of serious crimes.''
   ``There are many more safeguards involved in expelling a refugee
than (expelling) an ordinary alien. We don't know whether these
people have been afforded the same level of (legal) protection,''
Kumin said in an interview.
   Serbia's Communist-controlled newspapers reported that the 17
Albanians, who live in Kosovo, ``were denied hospitality because
they broke Yugoslav laws.'' The reports did not specify what laws
the Albanians had violated.
   Serbia, the largest Yugoslav republic, has launched a campaign
to expel some 730 Albanian refugees in Kosovo who allegedly do not
possess valid residence permits.
   Serbia's Communist authorities claim the Albanians worked for
their native country's Sigurimi secret police and were instructed
to provoke tensions between the ethnic Albanian majority and
Serbian minority in Kosovo, an autonomous province in Serbia which
borders Albania.
   Several of the refugees, interviewed by the liberal press in the
republics of Slovenia and Croatia, denied they were Sigurimi
agents. They said their families escaped from Albania because of
political or religious persecution.
   In another development, Kosovo's Premier Jusuf Zeinulahu and
three other ethnic Albanian ministers withdrew the resignations
they had submitted during a two-day session of the province's
legislature.
   The four wanted to resign to protest moves by Serbian
authorities to tighten their police and administrative control over
Kosovo, where 60 ethnic Albanians have died since February 1989 in
anti-Serbian riots. They withdrew their resignations at the request
of ethnic Albanian lawmakers.
   Ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of Kosovo's 1.6 million
population and are fighting for more autonomy from Serbia, which
says it must control the province to protect the Serbian minority
from alleged Albanian harassment.

<HEAD>Rabbi Says Political Leaders Eat Non-Kosher Foods</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The diet of Israeli leaders became a political
issue today after a powerful rabbi privately accused several
politicians of eating non-kosher foods such as pork and shellfish.
   The accusations against Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir and others
were secretly recorded as Rabbi Ovadia Yosef spoke to other
religious leaders at a Jewish seminary on Thursday night.
   Yosef's comments were the lead item on both Israel and armed
forces radio stations this morning and were quoted on the front
page of the daily Yediot Ahronot newspaper. Israel radio said it
obtained the tape recording from an unidentified person who made
the recording without the rabbi's knowledge.
   Yosef, the spiritual mentor of the ultra-Orthodox Shas party,
said of Shamir: ``He eats only impure fish. That's what he likes,
he's dying for it.''
   He also said of Ariel Sharon, a leading right-wing figure: ``He
doesn't eat shellfish, but he really loves pork.''
   Israel radio reported that Shamir refused to comment when asked
in an interview about Yosef's charges. Neither Sharon nor his
spokesman could be reached for comment.
   Yossef Azran, head of the Shas faction in parliament, told army
radio that Yosef's remarks on the politicians' dining habits were
taken out of context.
   Many religious Jews adhere to strict dietary laws that prohibit
them from eating foods they consider unclean, such as pork and
shellfish. Shamir and other top politicians lead a secular
lifestyle, but publicly they observe Jewish holidays and some of
the customs.
   The accusations were broadcast as Shamir, the interim prime
minister, tries to persuade ultra-Orthodox religious parties to
join a coalition Cabinet that would be led by his right-wing Likud
bloc.
   Yosef played a key role two months ago in toppling Shamir's
coalition government with the left-leaning Labor Party. The
coalition lost a vote of confidence in Parliament after Yosef
ordered the six Shas lawmakers to abstain.
   Shas traditionally has supported Likud.

<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Strong earthquakes shook southern Sudan
for the second time in a week, causing damage in the town of Juba,
a relief official said today.
   ``It went on and off all night. A building at the airport
collapsed and there appears to be damage in the town,'' said Bob
Koepp of the Lutheran World Federation.
   Koepp runs a relief air shuttle from Nairobi. He was relaying a
report from one of his pilots, who made a round trip to Juba this
morning.
   The pilot did not go into the town and had no information about
possible casualties, Koepp said. He said the airport runway
sustained no damage.
   Koepp reported the pilot said the quake began Thursday morning
and that tremors continuing throughout the day.
   The U.S. Geological Survey in Boulder, Colo., reported a quake
measuring 7.1 on the Richter scale about 50 miles east of Juba
shortly after a 6.8 tremor rocked the same area. The Hong Kong
Observatory also reported a 6.8 tremor in the same region but made
no mention of the 7.1 quake.
   The quakes were strong enough to be felt in neighboring Uganda
and western Kenya and shook buildings near Lake Victoria, 375 miles
south of the epicenter, the Daily Nation newspaper of Nairobi
reported today.
   They were in the same area where an earthquake measuring 7.4
struck Saturday. The area is sparsely populated, with the few
residences consisting of grass-thatched mud huts.
   In Cairo, Egypt, Rashad Kebeasy, a geologist, said the latest
quakes were aftershocks of last weekend's earthquake.
   The Richter scale is a gauge of the energy released by an
earthquake, as measured by ground motion recorded on a seismograph.
   Every increase of one number means that the ground motion is 10
times greater. A quake of magnitude 6 can cause severe damage on
land while a tremor of magnitude 7 is capable of causing heavy and
widespread damage.

   The governor of Jammu-Kashmir state,
whose harsh tactics fanned the flames of a Moslem separatist
revolt, resigned today, a senior official and news reports said.
   The resignation, reportedly at the request of the New Delhi
government, came four days after paramilitary police in Srinagar
opened fire on a procession bearing the body of a slain Moslem
religious leader.
   At least 58 people were killed and 300 wounded in what survivors
claimed was an unprovoked attack. The government said the troops
fired after they were shot at by militants in the procession.
   A senior government official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, reported the resignation of the governor, Jagmohan, who
uses only one name.
   ``Perhaps he now feels that he has become an object of
oontroversy and his presence is not likely to help the people of
Kashmir to join the mainstream,'' said the official, speaking on
condition of anonymity.
   In mostly Hindu Jammu, the winter capital of predominantly
Moslem Jammu-Kashmir state, shops closed in protest as word of
Jagmohan's resignation spread.
   Jagmohan, 61, was appointed governor of Jammu-Kashmir on Jan. 19
to try to halt the increasingly violent Moslem campaign for
independence from predominantly Hindu India.
   The next day his government launched the harshest crackdown ever
against the four-decade-old secessionist movement. At least 460
people, mostly Moslem militants and supporters shot by security
troops, have been killed in Kashmir since then, according to daily
tallies verified by reporters and sources.
   The government said the toll was less than 300, while some
sources claimed it was as high as 1,200.
   In Srinagar, Jammu-Kashmir's summer capital, Moslem
demonstrators used Jagmohan's name as a synonym for repression. He
said he used ``fairness and firmness,'' but Kashmiris claimed he
allowed troops to rob and torture them.
   Srinagar, a once-thriving tourist town of 1 million people, has
been under curfew every night for the past four months and often
during the daytime.
   Jagmohan, a career civil servant, will be succeeded by Girish
Saxena, security adviser to Prime Minister V.P. Singh, Press Trust
of India said. Like Jagmohan, the new governor is a Hindu.
   United News of India quoted L.K. Advani, head of a conservative
Hindu party, as saying Jagmohan submitted his resignation at the
request of Singh's government.
   Advani, whose party supports but does not formally participate
in Singh's minority coalition, criticized the dismissal but said it
would not cause his party to withdraw its support of Singh. Such a
move could have brought down the government.
   Calls for Jagmohan's dismissal had been raised in Parliament
this week by Moslem and leftist legislators and ex-Prime Minister
Rajiv Gandhi, leader of the opposition Congress Party.
   The demands followed Monday's killings of mourners carrying the
body of the assassinated Islamic clergyman, Maulvi Mohammad Farooq,
whose killers have not been caught.
   The clergyman had long advocated political discussions to
resolve Kashmir's future, but recently he started calling for
independence.
   Kashmir, a former princely state, was divided along a
still-disputed frontier between India and Pakistan after the two
nations became independent from Britain in 1947 and were
partitioned along religious lines.
   About 64 percent of the 6 million people in Indian-governed
Jammu-Kashmir state are Moslems, making it the only state in India
with a Moslem majority. Nationwide, Moslems account for 12 percent
of India's 880 million people while Hindus comprise 82 percent.

   China has made clear that President Bush's
decision on trade relations would have bearing on political and
cultural ties.
   China today welcomed Bush's announcement on Thursday that he
favored extending China's most-favored-nation trade status for one
year, allowing Beijing to continue enjoying low tariffs.
   ``This is not only in the interests of China but in the
interests of the United States, too,'' the official Xinhua News
Agency today quoted Premier Li Peng as telling visiting Japanese
businessmen.
   Xinhua had said earlier that only a ``small number of Americans,
under the pretext of so-called human rights, opposed the renewal of
China's MFN status.
   ``Their arguments have been strongly rejected by the majority of
American people, who cherish the long-term interests of relations
between the two countries,'' the news agency wrote.
   Some U.S. congressmen say they will fight Bush's decision,
citing China's brutal crushing of a pro-democracy movement a year
ago.
   Trade between China and the United States has flourished since
1979, when diplomatic ties were renewed.
   In recent days, China indicated that raising tariffs on its
goods would lead not just to higher duties on U.S. products and a
sharp drop in trade, but diminished political and cultural contacts
as well.
   China fought hard on the issue, mixing veiled warnings with
calls for Washington to be sensible and ``consider the matter from
a long-term perspective,'' as Communist Party General Secretary
Jiang Zemin said recently.
   China also made concessions to critics of its human rights
record by lifting martial law in the Tibetan capital and releasing
211 people jailed for taking part in last year's democracy movement
in Beijing.
   Bush's decision can thus be seen as a Chinese diplomatic
victory, but a limited one.
   China's leaders still have failed to convince the White House or
the U.S. Congress that how they treat political dissidents is an
internal matter on which the United States has no right to comment.
   In making his announcement, Bush said he was not condoning
China's suppression of dissent and urged Chinese leaders to improve
their human rights record.
   Many Americans still believe China's leaders should be punished
in some way for having ordered the army to fire on unarmed
pro-democracy protesters last June, when hundreds and perhaps
thousands were killed.
   Given such deep differences in outlook, continued friction
between Beijing and Washington is inevitable. There will be no lack
of new occasion for conflict.
   For example, the World Bank is scheduled to consider several new
loans to China next week. Although China insists such loans should
not be linked to politics, the United States has blocked past
loans, making exceptions only for those considered for humanitarian
purposes.
   Fang Lizhi, China's most famous dissident, and his wife, Li
Shuxian, remain in the U.S. Embassy in Beijing, a constant irritant
in relations. There appears no progress toward winning them safe
passage from China. Jiang reiterated recently the couple must admit
their guilt and promise not to fight the government again.
   The more than 30,000 Chinese students in the United States will
become a growing point of friction if, as their studies finish,
significant numbers fail to return home. Bush has said those who
were in the United States last June can stay at least until Jan. 1,
1994, if they fear persecution at home.

   President Bush's summit next week with Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev may mark the end of one era in
U.S.-Soviet relations and the beginning of another.
   The main business the two will conduct symbolizes the old era.
They will sign a declaration to reduce U.S. and Soviet strategic
nuclear weapons _ by much less than the 50 percent initially
advertised _ and probably commit themselves to pursue further
cutbacks.
   The declaration will make the May 31-June 3 summit, like the
majority of its predecessors, an arms control summit.
   At the same time, Bush and Gorbachev will begin the transition
to a new superpower relationship forced on them by a rapidly
changing world.
   The Germans, taking charge of their future, are moving speedily
toward unification. This is creating a new Europe, and Bush and
Gorbachev will have to put their heads together and decide how to
adjust.
   Michael Mandelbaum, director of the East-West project of the
private Council on Foreign Relations, has suggested the two leaders
use the summit to begin plotting ``a new European security order.''
He calls the task far more important than arms control.
   Bush is not about to jettison the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization. But he has to look into a future Europe anchored by
an immensely powerful Germany and lacking the stabilizing standoff
of two military alliances.
   What is going on in Germany is upsetting the old balance of
power between NATO and the Warsaw Pact. It is forcing Bush and
Gorbachev to come up with a new formula.
   NATO's days may be numbered, the Warsaw Pact's surely are.
   Officials of the two superpowers have had some preliminary
discussions about fitting Germany into a new structure. The talks
were held ithout the fireworks that marked deliberations in the
fast-fading Cold War era.
   Gorbachev is not trying to hold on to East Germany, once the
Soviets' most reliable ally.
   The future of the 360,000 Soviet troops there is uncertain,
while the Soviet leader is likely to comply with requests by
Hungary and Czechoslovakia to remove all traces of the Red Army by
next year. Poland is making noises along the same line.
   So there is no reason for Bush to play the heavy, to poke a
finger in Gorbachev's eye.
   The president insists that the new Germany be in NATO. And yet,
he also is aware of the anxieties that causes the Soviets, who are
losing their East European buffer and have stark memories of World
War II, to oppose such an affiliation.
   Within the Soviet Union, meanwhile, the diverse nationalities
are threatening to go their separate ways. That weakens Moscow but
also raises a danger of ethnic strife and instability.
   Like German unification, these events are outpacing the ability
of the two superpowers to take charge of history. Bush and
Gorbachev, working together, would have a better chance of keeping
up.
   The pressure on Gorbachev, of course, is far more severe than
the strains on Bush, although the president must keep a wary eye on
the drive toward unification in Western Europe and the economic
colossus challenging the United States that could result.
   The West Germans, seeking Soviet blessing for unification, may
be ready to buy that approval with economic assistance. Bush so far
has promised Moscow almost nothing. Feeling the heat of
congressional conservatives, who are worked up over Gorbachev's
treatment of the Baltics, Bush is reluctant to assist perestroika.
   He has ruled out lowering tariff barriers until final passage of
a new Soviet law establishing the right to emigrate. The Soviet
parliament was supposed to finish work on the law next Thursday, as
the summit opened.
   Now the calendar is slipping, and Bush will not recommend lower
tariffs to Congress unless the law is on the books.
   Bush also may delay signing a new trade deal with the Soviets
even though negotiators reached broad agreement late last month in
Paris. Again, conservatives are pressuring the White House to
retaliate against Gorbachev's moves to blunt independence drives in
Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia.
   Hard-liners like former Pentagon official Richard Perle are
urging Bush to take advantage of Gorbachev's troubles to force
completion of a treaty to withdraw tens of thousands of Soviet
troops and tanks from Eastern and Central Europe.
   Bush apparently will not heed the advice. The president and
Secretary of State James A. Baker III want to improve the
U.S.-Soviet relationship even with the slowdown in the arms talks
and the squeeze on Lithuania.
   Bush will observe the tradition of past arms control summits by
joining Gorbachev in the declaration to cut U.S. and Soviet nuclear
bombers, missiles and submarines.
   But the president also will take a look down the uncertain road
of Europe with the Soviet leader and may begin the transition to a
new and more peaceful relationship.

<HEAD>Pope Visiting Malta for First Time</HEAD>
<HEAD>By VICTOR L. SIMPSON</HEAD>
<HEAD>Associated Press Writer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II left today for a three-day visit
to Malta, the first papal visit to the Mediterranean island.
   Although Malta has a long Christian tradition, a papal visit
would have been unthinkable under the previous socialist government.
   John Paul's 48th foreign tour as pope takes him to a republic of
350,000 people, nearly 99 percent Catholic, where abortion is
banned and divorce is not allowed.
   Malta, the site of the U.S.-Soviet summit in December, planned
joyous celebrations. Hundreds of Maltese working outside the
country have returned this week to join the festivities.
   John Paul will tour both Malta and Gozo, the second largest
island in the archipelago and deliver about a dozen speeches.
   The first Christian community on Malta is said to date to the
year 60, when St. Paul was shipwrecked on the island.
   The island was home to the Knights of Malta, mobilized in the
16th century to defend Christian Europe from the Ottoman Turks.
   Church-state relations soured during the long period of
socialist rule from 1971 to 1987. Some of the bitterness stemmed
from the church's treatment of socialist officials and supporters
in the 1960s.
   The church-state crisis reached a head in 1984 when then-Prime
Minister Dom Mintoff's government decreed private schools,
including Catholic ones, could no longer charge tuition.
   But relations between the Nationalist government of Prime
Minster Eddie Fenech Adami, a regular churchgoer, and the Cathoic
hierarchy, are described as excellent. Maltese President Vincent
Tabone paid a state visit to the Vatican in December.
   John Paul's visit will be a fitting start to the annual series
of village parties in honor of patron saints. Malta boasts 313
churches, and its main monument, the 16th century St. John's
Cathedral, was restored for the occasion.

   An audit of U.S. aid to Roman Catholic
charities in India says bishops, priests and nuns misused millions
of dollars, and the U.S. Embassy said today that an investigation
is under way.
   The audit by the U.S. accounting firm Price Waterhouse said
officials in India's Roman Catholic Church, which receives $25
million in U.S. food annually, drew up bogus lists of food
recipients and used donations to run businesses. Clergy also
purposely exaggerated the amount of aid they distributed and filed
false reports to hide the abuses, the audit said.
   The audit was ordered by the Inspector General's office of the
U.S. Agency for International Development and focused on Catholic
Relief Services, a Baltimore-based charity, which gives food to
4,600 groups that distribute the food to the needy, mostly children
and pregnant women.
   Most of the organizations are Roman Catholic, although Hindu,
Moslem and non-religious groups participate. They include the
Missionaries of Charity run by Nobel Peace Prize winner Mother
Teresa.
   James DeHarpporte, head of Catholic Relief Services' operations
in India, said the audit was ``unfair and highly exaggerated the
extent of our problems.'' But he acknowledged the organization was
undergoing a management shake-up.
   The U.S. Embassy said today that the Central Bureau of
Investigation, India's version of the FBI, and the investigative
wing of the U.S. Agency for International Development are looking
into the reported abuses.
   News of the audit came first in today's Washington Post. Details
subsequently were provided by auditors and a U.S. official in New
Delhi.
   Tridibes Basu, a partner at Price Waterhouse in the Indian
capital, said the audit does not accuse Roman Catholic clergy with
theft but the report says the relief program ``was operated in an
atmosphere whereby the commodities could be misused with little
risk of detection.''
   But some officials said they believed the report showed
substantial evidence of widespread corruption and theft of the free
American food.
   ``Quantities of food stored in warehouses did not tally with
written records of food delivered to and distributed from these
warehouses,'' a U.S. official said, speaking on condition of
anonymity. ``Proper quantities of food were not distributed to
beneficiaries and distribution of food was done irregularly or not
at all at some sites.''
   The audit estimated that records for food distribution and
actual food distribution differed by about $4 million.
   The U.S. official said record-keeping was shoddy, food storage
was poor and Catholic Relief Services' role in monitoring the aid
had generally been ``deficient.''
   He said that due to the audit, Catholic Relief Services had cut
its operations in India, and that the U.S. Agency for International
Development was reconsidering its aid to the organization.
   ``Future operations will depend on improvements in Catholic
Relief Services management ability,'' the official said.
   DeHarpporte said his organization had slowed operations but he
denied there were widespread abuses.
   He acknowledged that the charity had terminated its relationship
with some organizations and was seeking repayment for lost or
stolen food. In one case, 2,000 bags of food worth $20,000
disappeared from one warehouse.
   ``Not everybody's an angel, not everybody's a saint, but when we
do find abuses we terminate our agreement,'' he said.
   The United States gives India about $100 million worth of food
annually. Wheat, corn, soy beans, vegetable oil and milk comprise
the bulk of the aid. The CARE charity gets most of the aid.
   The audit was completed in December 1989 and filed with the
Inspector General's Office of the U.S. Agency for International
Development in March, said Vali Nijhawan, senior manager of Price
Waterhouse in New Delhi.

<HEAD>Trinity Floodwaters Crest, Killer Gnats on the Rise</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MICHAEL GRACZYK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LIBERTY, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An end to the worst flooding in decades
was in sight today after the Trinity River crested at a record
mark, but gnats spawned in floodwaters gathered in swarms lethal to
animals, and some Arkansas farmers blamed water managers for
crippling crop damage.
   The Trinity River reached 29.98 feet Thursday at Liberty, up
slightly from 29.96 feet the day before. Flood stage on the river
is 24 feet and the old record high-water mark was 29 feet in 1942.
   ``The water will be with us for a while, but we hope we've
turned the tide,'' said Jim Mitchum, Liberty County emergency
management coordinator.
   Barring another onslaught of heavy rains, officials said the
river was unlikely to rise further. Upstream waters were receding
and were expected to begin dropping at Liberty as early as today.
   About 100 miles to the north, clouds of blood-sucking turkey
gnats rose from floodwaters to menace people, poultry and other
animals.
   ``This is probably the worst infestation of the turkey gnat in
East Texas since the 1930s or 1940s,'' said Dr. James Robinson, an
entomologist for the Texas Agricultural Extension Service at
Overton. ``We have confirmed reports of infestations in at least 14
counties, all joining or near major rivers or streams.''
   Turkey gnats are members of the black fly family and are
slightly larger than fruit flies. Robinson said the infestations
could persist for six weeks.
   ``We have reports of more than 1,000 head of fowl dying as a
result of turkey gnat infestations,'' said Gayle Finch, extension
agent in Henderson County. ``Numerous people have called within the
past two weeks reporting losses of chickens, ducks, geese, guineas
and birds.''
   The gnats also can inflict painful bites that raise itchy red
welts on humans.
   ``Some people have gone to the doctor for treatment of bites. We
are finding the bites to be worse than mosquito bites,'' said
Denise Easterling, a veterinarian in Leon County.
   Flooding, an early killing freeze and high winds caused an
estimated $235.67 million in losses to the state's farmers and
ranchers, the Arkansas Farm Bureau said Thursday. The losses amount
to 28 percent of their usual net income.
   Flood damage far outweighed other weather-caused problems,
officials said.
   ``We had one farmer with about 2,000 acres, and he hadn't seen
it since the first of May,'' said Frank Plafcan, staff director for
the Jefferson County Extension Service.
   Farmers from Oklahoma and Arkansas who gathered for a meeting in
Fort Smith, Ark., on Thursday with Army Corps of Engineers
officials complained about perceived flood control shortcomings.
   The hearing was the third of five the Army engineers are holding
to explain how they operate reservoirs.
   Some farmers said they received too little warning about
impending floods and accused Army engineers of failing to lower
reservoir levels in anticipation of possible floods.
   ``We're getting floods from controlled waters,'' Hartman farmer
Richard Plugge said. Applause erupted when he said Army engineers
focused on maintaining recreation water levels rather than flood
control.
   James Proctor, Little Rock district reservoir control chief,
said flooding would have occurred regardless of any action taken by
water managers.
   ``We don't have infinite wisdom,'' said Col. Lee Smith of the
corps' Tulsa District.
   Train service across the Trinity River and a nearly 100-year-old
bridge was remained detoured as crews worked to stabilize a
300-foot trestle knocked askew by floodwaters.
   The bridge was built in 1904, with later construction in 1919.
The river has come within 7 inches of railroad ties.
   Texas officials estimate that about 10,000 people statewide have
been forced from their homes by storms and flooding that began late
last month in northern Texas.
   Nearly $1 million for temporary housing has been given to
families forced from their homes by the high water. Federal
agencies have received requests for help from some 4,123 Texas
families.
   No deaths or injuries have been blamed on the floods along the
lower Trinity River. Thirteen deaths were blamed on storms and
flooding in northern Texas.
   Elsewhere, Louisiana and Oklahoma officials said flooding there
caused more than $20 million damage to farms. Parts of Indiana also
suffered severe damage.

<HEAD>Chinese Premier Welcomes Renewal of Favored Trade Status</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: New throughout with Chinese reaction. No pickup.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Premier Li Peng today welcomed President Bush's
decision to renew China's most-favored-nation trade status, saying
it would help U.S-Chinese ties.
   At least two other Asian governments _ Hong Kong and Japan _
also praised the move, saying friendly ties were important despite
Beijing's crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators a year ago.
   Bush announced Thursday that he favors renewing the trade status
for one year, entitling China to the lowest available tariffs on
its exports.
   ``This is not only in the interests of China but in the
interests of the United States, too,'' the official Xinhua News
Agency quoted Li as telling visiting Japanese businessmen.
   Xinhua said Li ``noted that his government will, as always, make
due efforts to restore and promote Sino-U.S. relations.''
   U.S. congressional critics said they would try to overturn the
decision in order to protest China's killing of pro-democracy
demonstrators last year. China maintains that its treatment of
dissidents is an internal matter.
   China had made it clear that downgrading its trade status would
have hurt political and cultural ties with the United States as
well as cause a sharp drop in trade. U.S.-Chinese relations were
already badly strained by conflict over last year's killings.
   Xinhua, in its report on Bush's decision, claimed that only a
small number of Americans supported ending the favored trade status
``under the pretext of so-called human rights.''
   Other official Chinese media argued before Bush's announcement
that American consumers, rather than Chinese manufacturers, would
be hurt most by canceling the favored status.
   China Daily said without cheap Chinese canvas shoes, ``some
Americans would be unable to afford similar shoes manufactured in
the United States.''
   Last year, China exported about $12 billion worth of goods to
the United States, mostly garments and toys. The United States sold
China about $5.7 billion worth of goods, led by wheat, fertilizer
and aviation equipment.
   Hong Kong's trade and industry secretary, John Chan, today said
Bush's move was ``very good news from Hong Kong's point of view.''
   In a statement, Chan noted the British colony's business
community and government had engaged in intensive lobbying during
the past few weeks to explain how termination of special trade
status would harm Hong Kong, which will return to Chinese
sovereignty in 1997.
   Much of the Chinese exports to the United States are produced in
joint-venture factories set up by Hong Kong investors in southern
China.
   The Japanese government today welcomed the Bush decision and
said stable ties between Washington and Beijing are ``an
indispensable factor for maintaining the peace and stability of
Asia and the Pacific.''
   Japan had urged Bush to resist pressure to punish China for last
year's crackdown in which hundreds and perhaps thousands of
students were killed.

<HEAD>91-Year-Old Woman Hurt in Scuffle over Met Game</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An 91-year-old nursing home resident balked when
she was told she could not stay up to watch the end of a baseball
game on TV that went into extra innings.
   As a result, she was injured and a nurse's aide who wanted her
to turn off the Mets game was fired and charged with assault.
   The alleged assault took place April 17 when Elizabeth Gusette
was watching a Mets-Cubs game on television at the A. Holly
Peterson Geriatric Center in Uniondale on New York's Long Island,
according to today's New York Post and New York Daily News.
   The 13-inning game started at 7:30 p.m. and lasted more than 4{
hours before Chicago downed New York, 8-6.
   Gusette claims that aide Jacqueline St. Jean, 46, told her it
was time to go to sleep.
   But Gusette cried foul. She wanted to continue watching the Mets
_ ``I just love the game,'' she said _ and the two got into a
scuffle.
   St. Jean allegedly grabbed the elderly woman by the hands and
arms. When the fight was over, the TV was off and Gusette's wrist
was bloodied.
   St. Jean was fired because of the incident, and Thursday she was
charged with assault.
   As for the Mets, one game under .500 and in fourth place in the
National League East, all Gusette would say is she's ``not
impressed.''

   The candidate backed by Mikhail S. Gorbachev for
president of the Russian republic withdrew from the race today,
strengthening the campaign of Boris N. Yeltsin, the populist who
has repeatedly clashed with Gorbachev.
   The state news agency Tass reported the withrawal of Russian
Premier Aleksandr V. Vlasov but did not give a reason. It said
Vlasov's pullout had been announced at the Congress of the Russian
Federation, which will elect the president, a newly created post in
the largest of the 15 Soviet republics.
   On Wednesday, Gorbachev attacked Yeltsin's platform, accusing
him of calling for the ``breakup of the Soviet Union.''
   The Russian republic contains Moscow and encompasses 11 time
zones, from the Baltic to the Pacific. The Russian language
predominates in the Soviet Union, and much of the nation's wealth,
including vast natural resources, is concentrated in the republic.
   In addition to Yeltsin, two other men remained in the race _
Ivan Polozkov and Vladimir Morokin _ but from the start the
campaign had appeared to be a contest between Yeltsin and Vlasov. A
vote was possible later in the day.
   Prior to Vlasov's announcement, Yeltsin delivered a
well-received speech pledging that if elected, he would defend the
republic from meddling by the national Soviet government, but
refrain from clashing with Gorbachev.
   Gorbachev holds the posts of president of the Soviet Union and
general secretary of the Soviet Communist Party, the two most
powerful jobs in the Soviet Union.
   ``I am for businesslike relations, dialogue and negotiations
with the president and the government, but on the principle that
Russia's sovereignty is not damaged,'' Yeltsin told the Russian
Congress.
   His bass voice booming through the hall of the Great Kremlin
Palace, Yeltsin pressed a radical platform for bringing the Russian
republic ``out of crisis.''
   He presented a point-by-point program on how he would fight for
Russian's sovereignty, unleash market forces, increase housing and
flood stores with consumer goods.
   He blasted the government program for a transition to a market
economy presented by Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov on Thursday, saying it
had ``already created panic in the stores today.''
   Instead, he backed an alternative program involving sale of
government property, more liberal laws on ownership and foreign
loans to make the transition without ``everything falling on the
shoulders of the people.''
   Yeltsin already is a member of the Congress of People's
Deputies, which is the national parliament; the Russian Congress of
People's Deputies, the Russian republic's parliament; and the
Communist Party Central Committee.
   During a question-and-answer session, he was asked several times
about his relations with Gorbachev, who entered the hall halfway
through the speech. Yeltsin, formerly Gorbachev's protege, has
become an opponent in the last two years, blaming the Soviet
president for ``halfway reforms.''
   But Yeltsin said their personal relationship would not influence
their interaction as presidents. ``If there was or is something
personal, I'll set it aside,'' he said.
   Yeltsin left the podium to prolonged applause, and was followed
by Ivan Polozkov, a Communist Party chief from Krasnodar who is now
considered Yeltsin's main rival.
   Russia is the largest of the 15 Soviet republics, with just more
than half the country's population and two-thirds of its territory.

   United Nations scientists today warned that global
warming has begun, temperatures will rise in the next century
faster than in the last 10,000 years and that urgent measures are
needed to curb ``greenhouse'' gases.
   In addition, a separate report warns that warming poses serious
threats to the planet, including rising sea levels, the spread of
disease and mass starvation in poor countries.
   The world temperature is likely to increase about 1.8 degrees in
the next 35 years and 5.4 degrees before the end of the next
century, said a report released by a working group of the U.N.'s
Intergovernment Panel on Climate Change.
   Sea levels were predicted to rise by 2.3 inches each decade, or
8 inches by 2030, and 25.5 inches by the end of the next century.
   These conclusions represent something of an international
consensus on the scientific certainty of global warming.
   ``It's the biggest international research drive into global
warming ever conducted. It's authoritative and objective, it was
set up by the United Nations General Assembly and staffed by
first-rank scientists from around the world,'' said Greenpeace
spokesman Steve Elsworth.
   Dan Lashoff, an observer at the meeting from the Natural
Resources Defense Council in Washington, said the report will bring
increased pressure on the United States to take action.
   ``The White House must take this report seriously. ... The White
House will no longer be able to pick its favorite scientific
skeptics as an excuse for not reducing U.S. emissions,'' Lashoff
said.
   President Bush has called for more study on global warming.
   The United Nations established three working groups which
together called on the expertise of about 1,000 scientists around
the world.
   Global warming is the process by which greenhouse gases, such as
carbon dioxide and chlorofluorocarbons, collect on the outer edges
of the Earth's atmosphere and trap heat within.
   The release of the report by the respected U.N. panel of
scientists could move the international agenda from discussions of
whether global warming exists to plans for how to deal with it.
   Shortly after the report's release, Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher urged a ``giant international effort'' to deal with the
threat and committed Britain to a 30 percent reduction in carbon
dioxide emissions by the year 2005.
   ``If the panel's predictions are broadly right then the world
could become hotter than at any time in the last 100,000 years,''
she said in a speech at the opening of the Hadley Center for
Climate Prediction and Research at the Meteorological Office in
Bracknell.
   She said the problem cannot be dealt with by individual
countries. ``We shall only be able to deal with the problem by a
giant international effort in which we all cooperate,'' she said.
   In fixing the country's carbon dioxide target, the British
government took a position between what environmentalists and
scientists are asking and what the government feels is politically
and practically possible.
   Many scientists want to reduce carbon dioxide emissions 20
percent worldwide by 2005, instead of simply stabilizing them.
   ``If the world followed the target Mrs. Thatcher has announced
... we will fail to control global warming. It is totally
inadequate,'' said Andrew Dilworth, spokesman for Friends of the
Earth.
   A preliminary report by a Soviet-led panel on the impact of
climate change warned that global warming poses a serious threat to
the planet. Parts of the report were published in Britain this week.
   Melting at the poles will cause seas to rise, coastlines to
flood and vast migrations from coastal and drought-hit agricultural
regions, the report predicted. Tropical diseases, such as malaria,
would spread to higher latitudes, the report said.
   Agricultural regions, such as the corn belt in North America,
could shift toward the poles by 125 to 185 miles for every degree
of warming. Forests might move hundreds of miles toward the poles.
   Food production overall could be sustained, but agricultural
costs worldwide would increase by 10 percent and poor countries
with burgeoning populations would face mass starvation, the report
said.

   The U.S. trade deficit fell to $26.4 billion
from January through March, the lowest quarterly imbalance in more
than six years, the government reported today.
   The Commerce Department said the 8.2 percent improvement from a
$28.7 billion fourth-quarter deficit resulted from a record level
of U.S. sales abroad offsetting the highest volume of oil imports
in more than 12 years.
   For the first quarter, U.S. exports rose 4.7 percent to an
all-time high of $96.04 billion. Imports were also at a record
level, based on a surge in oil demand, climbing 1.6 percent to
$122.4 billion. The trade deficit is the difference between imports
and exports.
   Today's report on merchandise trade as calculated on a
balance-of-payments basis confirmed trends already noted in the
department's monthly merchandise trade reports. They showed a first
quarter deficit of $23.9 billion.
   The disparity in the two figures comes from the fact that
today's report excludes military sales by the U.S. government and
makes other minor adjustments to the monthly figures.
   Analysts were generally heartened by the new figures despite the
surge in oil imports. They noted that U.S. export sales remain at
strong levels. Since growth in exports has fueled a large portion
of U.S. economic growth over the past three years, the continuation
of this trend is seen as a promising sign for the future.
   The first-quarter deficit was the smallest since a $21.7 billion
shortfall in the fourth quarter of 1983.
   Exports of machine tools, industrial supplies and consumer goods
climbed 4 percent to a record $85.1 billion in the first quarter.
More than one-half of this increase came from a boom in exports of
civilian aircraft following the end of the Boeing strike.
   Farm exports were up 7 percent to $11 billion with increases
recorded in overseas sales of wheat, vegetables, fruits and nuts.
Corn exports were down, reflecting sharply lower shipments to the
Soviet Union.
   Average prices of corn and cotton increased 2 percent while
prices of other commodities changed little, the government said.
   Imports of petroleum were up 17 percent in the first quarter to
$15.6 billion, with the average number of barrels imported daily
climbing to 8.9 million, the highest level since the third quarter
of 1977.
   The average price per barrel increased to $19.47, the highest
since the first quarter of 1986, when the price per barrel was
$17.65.
   America's deficits declined with several countries, including
Japan, down $1.9 billion to $10.4 billion for the first quarter.
The United States even posted a $400 million trading surplus with
the countries of Western Europe.

<HEAD>Unrest Prompts Evacuation of Foreign Women, Children from Oil
Center</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LIBREVILLE, Gabon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A military plane began evacuating
foreign women and children from the oil-production center of Port
Gentil today after two days of riots and hostage-taking over the
death of an opposition leader.
   The government created a panel to investigate the death of the
opposition leader, Joseph Rendjambe, secretary-general of the Gabon
Progress Party. Opponents accuse President Omar Bongo's government
of being behind the killing.
   A government newspaper, L'Union, reported two deaths in the
rioting, and hospital sources said 17 people were hurt.
   French troops today patrolled the streets of Port Gentil, which
appeared calm this morning as soldiers escorted women and children,
mostly French, to the airport to be flown to Libreville, the
capital.
   Libreville also was quiet today. People returned to work, and
there was no extraordinary police or military presence.
   Sources said two large aircraft were on the way to this West
African nation from France to fly the evacuees on to Paris. The
evacuation was voluntary.
   There are several thousand French citizens in Port Gentil, as
well as a smaller number of Americans, Britons and others who work
for oil companies based in the city, 100 miles south of Libreville.
   Port Gentil is ringed by a lagoon and is only accessible by air
and boat. French diplomats in Libreville said up to 700 people were
to be brought out today by air, women and children going first.
   Rioting in the port city last month led to a similar evacuation
of foreign staff and dependents of the French Elf oil company,
Royal Dutch Shell and British Gas.
   The French government sent reinforcements to its garrison in its
former colony in central Africa after opposition supporters took a
French diplomat hostage for several hours.
   Opposition party members then took 10 oil executives hostage in
Port Gentil. They were released after French troops were sent to
the scene and held talks with the dissidents.
   The government said in a statement it remained committed to
replacing Bongo's one-party rule with democracy. On Monday, the
constitution was amended to allow opposition parties to contest
elections in September.

   Two brothers charged with the
shotgun slayings of their affluent parents wailed hysterically in
an emergency telephone call reporting the murders.
   The recording was made after the Aug. 20 slayings of
multimillionaire entertainment executive Jose Menendez and wife,
Kitty. It was released Thursday after news media attorneys obtained
a court order requiring that it be made public.
   The emotional two-minute call appears to have been made by the
slain couple's elder son, Lyle, 22, who has been charged with his
brother, Erik, 19, in the murders. Prosecutors say greed was the
motive.
   Superior Court Judge James Albracht ordered the audio tape
release, along with a videotape documenting a police search of the
home of the Menendez brothers' psychologist.
   But psychologist Jerome Oziel on Thursday won an emergency
appellate court stay blocking release of the videotape.
   ``I believe that release of the search warrant videotape ...
would be a complete violation of my family's constitutional right
to privacy,'' Oziel said. ``It would serve no purpose whatsoever in
clarifying any relevant issues in this case.''
   The Court of Appeal asked for written argument on the matter by
May 29.
   The brothers' defense counsel opposed the release of the audio
tape but did not appeal it. It recorded dispatchers trying to calm
down a sobbing, screaming man and determine what happened:
   ``Somebody killed my parents,'' were the first words choked out
by the caller after a dispatcher asked repeatedly, ``What's the
problem?''
   When asked to repeat who the victims were, the caller said, ``My
mom and dad.''
   At least twice the caller yelled to Erik by name and a
dispatcher, hearing the name, asked to speak with Erik. The second
brother never took the phone but his cries could be heard in the
background throughout the tape.
   At one point the caller sobbed, ``I came home and found them.''
   The first call ended with a dispatcher saying that an ambulance
was on the way. The tape also contained a brief call from the 911
dispatchers back to the house. A man answered ``Hello'' quickly,
and then began sobbing.
   ``OK, I want you to come outside,'' the male dispatcher said.
   ``I've got to get my brother,'' came the reply.
   ``You tell your brother come out the front door. Everybody come
outside,'' the dispatcher said.
   The brothers claim they discovered their parents' bodies when
they returned home after a night out at a restaurant and the movies.
   Prosecutors contend the boys committed the murders to collect a
$14 million inheritance. Jose Menendez was an executive with Live
Entertainment Inc., a video distribution company.
   An autopsy report said the couple was killed in an upstairs den
of their mansion by shotgun blasts at close range. Both large
pellet and birdshot ammunition were used. Menendez was hit by five
blasts. His wife was hit 10 times.

   Federal prosecutors say Mayor Marion Barry is
making unfounded claims of government misconduct and is not
entitled to have the 14-count drug case against him dismissed.
   Barry was indicted on eight drug-related charges on Feb. 15. Six
new charges, including one count of conspiracy and five counts of
cocaine possession, were brought May 10.
   He is scheduled to go to trial June 4, and his lawyers have
moved to dismiss the indictment on grounds the prosecution
retaliated against him by bringing six new drug charges against him
less than a month before his trial.
   A hearing on the dismissal motion and other requests by Barry
was scheduled today before U.S. District Court Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson.
   Meanwhile, the Washington Post said today today a poll showed
Barry has suffered no significant erosion in his political base
since his arrest. He and Councilman John Ray were tied with 23
percent each of the 760 self-described Democrats polled by the
newspaper about their preference for the Democratic mayoral
nomination. The rest were split among four additional challengers.
   Barry has not officially announced whether he will seek a fourth
term.
   The government is making a ``diligent effort'' to investigate
criminal wrongdoing and is not retaliating against Barry's refusal
to plead guilty to the original indictment, prosecutors said in
court papers filed Thursday.
   No plea offers were extended by the government, they added.
   ``The charges set out in the original indictment did not reflect
the full extent of the defendant's criminal conduct,'' said U.S.
Attorney Jay Stephens.
   ``Nothing that has happened in this case even remotely supports
the defendant's suggestion that the government acted with a
retaliatory motive in seeking additional charges,'' Stephens added.
   Barry lawyer R. Kenneth Mundy said the government has refused to
provide the names of the alleged co-conspirators in the new
indictment.
   Mundy said there is a ``presumption of vindictiveness'' and that
the government should be required to justify charging a conspiracy
spanning five years less than a month before trial.
   Stephens said the timing of the new indictment was ``not
unreasonable'' and that the government is not required to disclose
the identity of unindicted co-conspirators or its witnesses.
   The U.S. attorney said he has filed the co-conspirators' names
with the court, requesting that they be turned over to Barry
without being publicly disclosed.
   The original indictment accuses Barry of three felony counts of
lying to a federal grand jury about his alleged involvement with
drugs and five counts of cocaine possession. One possession count
stems from his Jan. 18 arrest in an FBI sting operation at the
Vista Hotel, where officials said he was videotaped smoking crack
cocaine.

<HEAD>Summer Fun Can Be Dangerous, CDC Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Horseback riding, swimming and sunbathing add up
to summer fun for millions, but government health researchers are
warning that it's also the season for broken necks, drownings and
skin cancer.
   The national Centers for Disease Control, in three reports
Thursday, urged caution for people participating in those popular,
but hazardous, outdoor activities.
   The CDC said horseback riders should wear helmets, sunbathers
should protect their skin and swimmers should limit their alcohol
intake, though researchers said they still are not certain about
the relationship between drinking and drowning.
   ``The main issue here is people can be seriously injured riding
a horse, and there is a safety mechanism and it is a helmet,'' said
Dr. David Nelson, the CDC epidemiologist who wrote the report on
horseback riding.
   About 30 million Americans ride horses each year, and the rate
of serious injury per riding hours is higher than that for
motorcyclists and car racers, the CDC report said.
   In 1987 and 1988, according to the CDC, horseback riding
accounted for 92,763 injuries, of which 9.9 percent required
hospitalization. Of those hospitalized, 42.2 percent had head or
neck injuries.
   One study quoted by the CDC said fewer than 20 percent of those
falling off a horse were wearing a helmet.
   ``Even when riders wear headgear, the headgear may be decorative
or improperly secured, thereby providing limited or no
protection,'' the CDC said.
   Nelson said several medical and trade organizations have
endorsed the use of helmets by horseback riders, though it has not
been as well publicized as efforts to get motorcyclists to wear
headgear.
   A separate report released Thursday by the CDC was based on a
study in Massachusetts that showed almost one-quarter of 221 people
responding to a survey drank alcohol while participating in aquatic
activities, including swimming and boating.
   Among the alcohol users, 29 percent reported having more than
four drinks from two hours before the activity until the end of the
outing, the CDC said.
   Though 25 percent to 50 percent of the annual 8,000 adolescent
and adult drownings in the United States involve alcohol
consumption, a researcher said the link between drinking and
drowning is unclear.
   ``The prevalence of drinking when you're out in the water is
really quite high. It's much higher than drinking and driving,''
said Dr. Jonathan Howland of Boston University's School of Public
Health.
   ``We can determine with some accuracy how many people who drown
are drinking. But we need to know more about the behavior of people
who drink and didn't drown,'' said Howland, who helped compile the
report.
   With current information, however, Howland said there is no
doubt that drinking contributes in general to injuries.
   Another CDC report said the New Jersey State Department of
Health, in response to a study showing a high death rate for a type
of skin cancer, is preparing a publicity campaign emphasizing the
danger of excessive exposure to the sun.
   The CDC suggested that people avoid heavy exposure to the sun
from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., wear hats and use a waterproof sunscreen.
   According to the New Jersey study, from 1979 to 1985 an average
of 381 males and 324 females were diagnosed annually in the state
with malignant melanoma. An average of 111 males and 79 females
died each year from the cancer.

   Noted sculptor Nina Winkel, who was in
a coma for more than three months following a car accident, has
died from her injuries. She was 85.
   Winkel lapsed into a coma on Jan 22, after the car her husband
was driving skidded off a snow-covered highway near Plattsburgh in
northern New York state and struck a guardrail. She died Thursday
at Elizabethtown Community Hospital.
   Born in 1905 in Germany, she studied art there, but fled the
Nazi regime in 1942 and settled in New York City.
   She received many accolades for her sculptures in the United
States, including the National Sculpture Society's Medal of Honor
and the Samuel F.B. Morse Medal.
   She moved to the Essex County town of Keene Valley about 30
years ago.
   Winkel held an honorary degree from the State University of New
York. She is survived by her husband, George, a retired importer.

   A military jet crashed into a residential
area in southern Georgia today, setting fire to at least two homes,
authorities said.
   There were conflicting reports on casualties. Kathleen Guthrie,
executive secretary at the Atkinson County Sheriff's Department,
reported at least three deaths, but she later said she could not
confirm any deaths.
   ``We heard the explosion; it was a helluva explosion. It knocked
our power off,'' said Martha White, owner of the Country Kitchen
Restaurant about 1{ miles from the crash site.
   ``It was very loud _ almost like a sonic boom,'' said David
McDonald, assistant principal at Atkinson County High School, about
half a mile from the site. ``It shook real hard.''
   The plane from Moody Air Force Base near Valdosta crashed about
9:38 a.m. off U.S. 441, about two miles outside Pearson, said Angel
Riggins, a dispatcher at the Atkinson County Sheriff's Department.
   ``There were about six houses involved. We know one completely
burned, and a mobile home,'' but it was unknown whether anyone was
inside the homes, she said. Authorities said four other houses were
damaged.
   She added that she had no word on the fate of the pilot, the
type of plane or whether other crew members were aboard.
   Moody officials declined to confirm that a plane from the base
had crashed but said they were preparing an announcement.
   The Pearson Volunteer Fire Department sent both of its units to
fight the fires, and departments from neighboring towns also were
called in, said a Pearson police spokeswoman who asked not to be
identified.
   Pearson, a town of about 2,000, is the county seat of rural
Atkinson County. Moody Air Force Base is located about 40 miles
away.

   The remains were to be handed over to a U.S. congressional
delegation in the truce village of Panmnujon. Ho said North Korea
was prepared to follow up with discussions ``in the same spirit''
to return other remains.
   The North Korean envoy said one of the men whose remains were
being handed over was believed to have been a pilot, but he said
the U.S. side had asked that there be no public identification made
for the time being.
   The move is an ``eloquent illustration'' of North Korea's
willingness to ``settle pending issues with the U.S. government in
a good way,'' Ho said.
   He said efforts to turn over the remains began in 1986, but were
sidelined by the 1988 U.S. characterization of the North Korean
government as a state sponsor of terrorism. North Korea denied the
accusation.
   The agreement on the return of the remains was worked out late
last year and this year by U.S.-North Korean contacts in New York
and Washington.

<HEAD>First Transplant Using Umbilical Cord Blood in U.S. Called Success</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The nation's first bone marrow transplant
using umbilical cord blood from one sibling to start blood
production in another was a success, hospital officials said.
   Officials at Children's Hospital Medical Center said Thursday
that 6-year-old Eric Miller of McFarland, Wis., is making good
progress since the April 17 transplant.
   In that operation, similar to an ordinary blood transfusion,
Eric was given umbilical cord blood that had been frozen since the
birth of his 6-month-old brother, Ethan.
   Doctors had waited until Ethan was 6 months old in case more
blood was needed. If another transfusion had been necessary, they
did not want to subject a newborn to the procedure.
   Matching blood characteristics is vital to a bone marrow
transplant's success. Not all family members have compatible bone
marrow, but siblings often are a good source, and umbilical cord
blood is particularly rich in stem cells, from which the body forms
marrow.
   Eric suffers from Fanconi's anemia, a rare inherited disorder
that causes severe bone marrow failure.
   Hospital officials said Eric's operation was the first of its
kind in North America, although two other operations of this type
have been performed in France.
   At the time of the transplant, doctors said it would take
several weeks to determine its success.
   Hospital spokeswoman Margaret Devereux said Thursday that the
bone marrow has grown and reproduced in Eric. He was listed in good
condition and was expected to be released from the hospital within
two weeks, she said.

   The air transport chief ordered
Philippine Airlines on Friday to ground all its Boeing 737-300
jetliners, two weeks after an explosion and fire on a Boeing jet
killed eight people.
   Oscar Alejandro, director of the Air Transport Office, said the
seven 737-300 jets were being grounded so they can be inspected.
   On May 11, a Boeing 737 was preparing for takeoff from Manila
when an explosion and fire ripped through the passenger section.
Eight of the 119 people on board were killed, and 30 were injured.
The cause of the blast has not been determined.
   Alejandro said U.S. experts will ship 26 electrical components
of the damaged aircraft's fuel system to the United States to see
whether a fault in the system could have caused the explosion.

casualties or damage, the meteorology office said.
   Siswoyo, a meteorology official, said the quake measured 6.3 on
the Richter scale and was centered in the sea about 1,060 miles
east of Jakarta.
   About the same time that earthquake hit, another was recorded in
the western part of the country. The second quake measured 2.5 on
the Richter scale and occurred in West Sumatra, Siswoyo said.
   He said the quake was centered in the Indian Ocean, about 625
miles northwest of Jakarta.
   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on

   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slight
damage in the local area, 4 moderate damage, 5 considerable damage,
6 severe damage.

prison, one of several conditions included in his sentence. He also
was sentenced to nine years on probation.
   Mowat, 47, is prohibited from entering the United States during
his probation, cannot be alone with or reside with children, must
enter a treatment program within 30 days of his release from prison
and must report his progress to DeKalb probation officials within
90 days after entering a program.
   His status as a priest is up to the Roman Catholic bishop in
Great Britain, a spokesman for the Atlanta Archdiocese said.

   An Iranian Kurdish group said Friday its
guerrillas killed 15 Iranian Revolutionary Guards in an ambush and
attacked a university campus in northern Iran.
   Ghafour Hamzai, a spokesman for the Iraqi-backed Kurdish
Democratic Party in Iran, said the guerrillas ambushed the guards
May 16 in the village of Geli Douland in northern Iran, near the
Iraqi border.
   He said two of the revolutionary guards killed were identified
as commanders of the guards in the area. One Kurdish guerrilla was
also killed in the attack, Hamzai said.
   He said the guerrillas attacked the College of Agriculture
building at the University of Oroumieh on May 17 and set fire to
its stores, destroying equipment.
   There was no Iranian comment on the guerrillas' claim.
   Kurdish guerrillas resumed fighting last month after the snows
melted in the mainly mountainous area bordering Iraq, where they
are taking refuge.

<DATELINE>BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Gonzalo Pereira plans to get to his
polling station early for Sunday's presidential election _ the less
time spent standing in line, the less chance of being killed by a
bomb, he says.
   A lot of Colombians are saying the same thing as car bombs
explode in major cities. Most are believed set by drug lords trying
to sabotage the vote.
   At least eight bombs have exploded across the country in the
past two weeks alone, killing 34 people. More than 200 people have
died in attacks since the government declared war on drug
traffickers in August.
   The latest fatal bombing was Thursday in Medellin, where five
people died when a car bomb exploded. Another blast in the city
Friday injured three people.
   ``I get nervous every time I walk by a parked car, thinking this
could be the next one to blow up,'' said Pereira, an oil industry
executive.
   Pereira said he figures that by showing up when polls open at 8
a.m., the line will be short and he can vote in perhaps 15 minutes.
   Most voting will take place at wooden sheds placed side by side
along sidewalks and streets.
   It is difficult to have a conversation with a Colombian these
days without the subject getting around to bombs and other
terrorist acts.
   ``The violence is keeping people away from public areas and
overwhelmingly reducing their activities. It might also keep people
at home for the elections,'' Camilo Castellanos, a social
scientist, told The Associated Press.
   A low voter turnout could wrest legitimacy from the winner. That
may be exactly what the perpetrators of the violence are seeking in
their campaigns to destabilize politics, officials say.
   The terrorism is overshadowing major election issues such as
constitutional reform and negotiations with leftist rebels.
Instead, staying clear of an indiscriminate terrorist attack is on
the minds of most people.
   Restaurant business at night is off sharply, said an American
who owns one of Bogota's biggest restaurants. People are scared of
bombs, he said, refusing to be identified.
   Soldiers forced their way into dozens of houses a week ago in
search of bombs. The army says it had learned of a drug
traffickers' plan to pack a house with tons of dynamite and set it
off.
   Cars entering parking lots at shopping centers and supermarkets
are inspected for bombs.
   Schoolchildren are being taught to take cover under desks in
case of a bomb. Army officers are giving speeches to neighborhood
housing organizations on evacuation and disaster control.
   The army and police said they were mobilizing about 230,000
troops to ensure peaceful elections.
   Bogota is an armed camp. Military checkpoints line major streets
and highways, and armored personnel carriers mounted with machine
guns patrol the cities. Soldiers are everywhere.
   Security concerns have prevented many candidates from appearing
in public, forcing them to conduct their campaigns through
television and radio. Three of the main presidential candidates
have been murdered during the campaign.
   ``These are the most tense and difficult elections in Colombian
history,'' Antonio Navarro, the presidential candidate for the
left-wing M-19 party, told reporters Wednesday.
   Navarro took over as M-19 candidate after his predecessor,
Carlos Pizarro, was murdered in April by an assailant who shot him
to death on a commercial jetliner over Bogota.
   The candidate who is expected to win the race, Cesar Gaviria,
has sunk into a bunker mentality in the campaign. Gaviria,
candidate for the ruling Liberal Party, has a security force of
about 200 men. The current president, Virgilio Barco, is barred by
the constitution from seeking a second consecutive term.
   According to the Bogota daily newspaper El Tiempo, Gaviria's
office is a ``super-protected bunker'' with steel enforced doors
and iron-clad windows designed to absorb dynamite blasts.
   He leaves the room only when absolutely necessary, the paper
said.
   ``Being a presidential candidate is obviously a very risky
business in Colombia,'' said Castellanos.
   The life-and-death issue dominates much of the campaigning.
   Alvaro Gomez, center-right candidate for the National Salvation
Movement, woos voters with the slogan, ``To Live Again.''

<TEXT>
   A freight train jumped the tracks and a
tanker car carrying grain alcohol exploded, sending a fireball
skyward and prompting the evacuation of 750 people because of fears
toxic cargo might ignite.
   Fifteen of the train's 90 cars derailed late Thursday. Eight of
those contained flammable ethyl alcohol, authorities said.
   Hazardous chemicals were being shipped in cars that did not
derail, and fears they might catch fire forced the evacuation of
all those living within three miles of the crash, said Cecil
Whaley, of the state Emergency Management Agency in Nashville.
   ``We were very fortunate there were no injuries,'' Whaley said.
``We had good luck.''
   Evacuees who spent the night at Red Cross shelters established
at nearby schools began returning home by mid-morning.
   Train crew members were tested for drug or alcohol use, but
results were not immediately available, said Illinois Central
spokesman Tom Utroska.
   There were no reports from the scene that the crew was impaired,
he said. Such freighters normally carry a crew of three, an
engineer, brakeman and conductor.
   ``The cars that piled up were almost on top of each other,''
Whaley said. ``There was tremendous damage to the train bed
itself.''
   The Memphis-bound train originated in Fulton, Ky., Illinois
Central officials said. It crashed south of Covington, about 40
miles northeast of Memphis.
   ``The sky was lit up with fire. It was awesome,'' said resident
Denise Edmundson.
   State and federal railway authorities were examining the
wreckage, seeking clues about what triggered the crash. The
National Transportation Safety Board in Washington said an
investigator was traveling from Chicago to join the investigation.
   Among those evacuated were 80 residents of a nearby nursing
home. They were returned there this morning.
   Three train cars caught fire and were allowed to burn through
the night. Beside its medical uses, ethyl alcohol can be used as a
fuel and a chemical solvent.
   Whaley said there were 17 other cars carrying hazardous
materials. The fire did not reach them, he said.
   ``It was touch and go at first because we were afraid vinyl
chloride or the poisons could have been part of the fire,'' he
said, referring to the other cars. ``It had us worried. It was
scary.''

<TEXT>
   PLO leader Yasser Arafat today accused Israel of
waging a ``war of extermination'' and called on the United Nations
to set up an international force to protect the Arab population in
Israeli-occupied lands.
   In a 50-minute speech that opened the special session of the
15-member U.N. Security Council, the Palestine Liberation
Organization chief also urged the creation of a separate United
Nations observer team charged with helping end the 23-year-old
Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
   Israel, which has rejected the presence of United Nations
observers in the territories, accused Arafat of using ``lies and
distortions'' in his speech.
   Arafat, addressing the council for the first time, also urged a
ban on all Israeli settlements in the occupied territories and the
appointment of a permanent U.N. representative to deal with the
Arab-Israeli strife.
   Clad in his customary uniform and headscarf and speaking in
Arabic, Arafat did not give any details about either of the two
U.N. teams he was requesting for deployment in the occupied
territories.
   It was the first time the Security Council had met in Geneva.
The gathering was moved from New York to avoid a showdown with the
United States, which in the past has refused to give Arafat an
entry visa.
   The PLO demand for safeguards for the 1.7 million Palestinians
in the occupied territories followed a renewed outbreak of violence
triggered by the slaying on Sunday of seven Palestinian laborers by
an apparently deranged former Israeli soldier. Subsequent rioting
left at least 15 Arabs dead, most by gunfire from Israeli troops,
and more than 800 injured or wounded.
   Arafat denied that the killing of the Palestinian laborers was
an isolated attack by a disturbed man. He said it was instead an
outgrowth of Israel's ``illusions of defunct racial superiority''
and the ``stupid arrogance of military superiority.''
   He demanded sanctions against Israel for refusing to comply with
U.N. resolutions and what he said was a violation of the Geneva
convention protecting civilians in time of war.
   ``The situation now requires urgent action in order to enforce
reverence for international legitimacy, '' he said.
   During the Palestinian uprising, he said, ``the Israeli
occupation forces have been waging a war of extermination on all
fronts.''
   He denounced ``terrorist and barbaric'' treatment of
Palestinians and vowed the uprising would continue until the
occupation ended.
   The PLO chief also urged immediate moves by the United Nations
toward an international Middle East peace conference and said the
PLO was prepared to deal ``flexibly'' with all international peace
initiatives.
   Arafat's comments drew 45 seconds of applause from the Security
Council members and 20 observers present.
   Before the session began, Israel's Deputy Foreign Minister
Benyamin Netanyahu told reporters that Israel regards the gathering
as ``an attempt to cynically exploit the solitary act of a crazed
madman.''
   A U.S. official, also speaking before the opening of today's
session, said the American delegation would not speak at the
meeting.
   ``There seems to be a consensus here that the recent outbreak of
violence in the occupied territories in particular should cease as
rapidly as one could bring it about,'' said the U.S. official, who
briefed reporters on condition of anonymity.
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III said Wednesday the United
States was ready to discuss the idea of setting up a U.N. force in
the occupied lands.
   But on Thursday, the State Department softened that somewhat. It
said in a statement that Baker had in mind temporary visits by U.N.
observers to ``check out'' the situation in the occupied
territories, rather than a permanant force.
   No decision was likely to be made in Geneva, according to the
chief U.N. spokesman, Francois Giuliani. He told reporters the
Security Council would vote on the issue when delegates reconvene
in New York, probably on Tuesday.
   Giuliani said the United Nations sent the United States a
request on Arafat's behalf to allow him entry, but did not make a
formal application.
   The Geneva session is open to all U.N. members who wish to speak
on the issue. Giuliani said the session could continue until late
tonight and possibly reconvene on Saturday.
   Arafat, who was also to meet with U.N. Secretary-General Javier
Perez de Cuellar, planned to leave Geneva on Friday afternoon.
   In December 1988, at a special U.N. General Assembly session in
Geneva, Arafat renounced terrorism and recognized Israel's right to
exist. That paved the way for a dialogue with the United States
after a 13-year American refusal to deal with his Palestine
Liberation Organization.
   To date, 720 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiers
or civilians since the Arab uprising began in December 1987 in the
occupied territories.
   An additional 216 Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs,
most on suspicion of collaborating with Israel. Forty-three
Israelis have died.

   Dozens of rockets bombarded
residential areas of the Afghan capital Friday, killing three
people and wounding five others, state-run radio reported.
   Kabul Radio, monitored in Islamabad, said ``Pakistan-based
extremists'' fired 26 surface-to-surface missiles into the
shell-shocked capital of Kabul, causing extensive damage. The radio
uses the term ``extremists'' when referring to the Moslem
guerrillas who have been trying for 12 years to overthrow the
Soviet-backed government of Afghanistan.
   Hundreds of people have been killed in rocket attacks on the
capital in recent years.
   The guerrillas, bankrolled by the United States, Saudi Arabia
and other sympathetic Arab states, insist they target only military
installations but admit they sometimes misfire and hit residential
areas.
   Western diplomats in Pakistan said the guerrillas apparently
stepped up their attacks on the capital to coincide with
preparations for a Loya Jirga, or traditional grand council, which
is expected to approve major changes in the constitution.

   Customs agents went on strike Friday
and blocked one of the city's main roads to demand better pay, and
witnesses said some police fired into the air in apparent support
of the strikers.
   This West African nation, once considered the economic miracle
of black Africa, has been jolted by a wave of strikes and protests
for more than two months.
   Soldiers, police, bus drivers, shipyard workers and others have
struck. Each time, President Felix Houphouet-Boigny has met a
delegation of the strikers and promised to improve their salaries
and working conditions.
   The government has been unable to pay its foreign debt for two
years and has had difficulty meeting government payrolls. It
attributes the problem to sharply reduced earnings for exports,
particularly cocoa. But critics say Houphouet-Boigny has wasted
hundreds of millions of dollars on personal projects and indulged
his top advisers with fancy homes and cars.
   The protests were triggered by an attempt to impose pay cuts and
other austerity measures in March. The measures were withdrawn, but
government employees, whose salaries have been frozen eight years,
have kept up their pressure on the government.
   The protests forced the closure of the country's schools for the
rest of this school year. Houphouet-Boigny also gave into demands
to permit opposition parties.
   His Ivory Coast Democratic Party has ruled the nation as a de
facto one-party state since independence from France in 1960.

<TEXT>
   A judge today convicted Winnie
Mandela's former bodyguard of killing a black teen-age activist and
said Mrs. Mandela was at home the day the kidnapped boy was brought
there and beaten.
   Supreme Court Justice Brian O'Donovan convicted Jerry Richardson
of murdering 14-year-old James Stompie Seipei Moeketsi on Jan. 1,
1989.
   He also was convicted of kidnapping and assault in cases
involving Stompie and three other men who were abducted and beaten
at Mrs. Mandela's home in Soweto township, according to testimony.
In addition, Richardson was convicted of attempted murder in a case
unrelated to the abductions.
   Mrs. Mandela, the wife of black nationalist leader Nelson
Mandela and a prominent anti-apartheid activist herself, was not
charged in the case, even though witnesses testified that she
participated in the beatings. Mrs. Mandela has said she was not at
her house when any assaults took place.
   Richardson once was Mrs. Mandela's chief bodyguard and the coach
of the Mandela United soccer team, whose members also served as
guards.
   His sentencing was postponed until Aug. 6 while he undergoes
psychiatric examinations. If no extenuating circumstances are
found, the death penalty is mandatory.
   However, President F.W. de Klerk suspended executions in
February as part of his efforts to encourage negotiations between
the white minority government and black organizations such as the
African National Congress. Nelson Mandela is deputy president of
the ANC.
   Three men testified during the 23-day trial that Richardson and
other bodyguards kidnapped them and Stompie from a Methodist Church
house in Soweto on Dec. 29, 1988.
   They said they were taken to Mrs. Mandela's home, and that she
beat them and Stompie with her fists and a whip, then allowed her
bodyguards to continue assaulting them.
   Eight other former bodyguards face trial on lesser charges. Mrs.
Mandela did not testify at Richardson's trial, although his
attorney asked her to do so.
   Mandela said Wednesday that the government was trying to ruin
his wife's reputation by deliberately not charging her in a ``case
which centers on her.'' However, he said he was not calling on the
government to prosecute his wife.
   Mrs. Mandela has made no public statement on the case since last
year, when leaders of major anti-apartheid organizations accused
her of complicity in the abductions and assaults and called on the
Soweto community to ostracize her.
   A few months later she reappeared on the stage at anti-apartheid
rallies, however, and she has accompanied her husband at most
public engagements since he was freed Feb. 11 after serving 27
years in prison.
   Mrs. Mandela has denied committing any crime but said the
abductions were justified. She claimed that a Methodist priest was
engaging in homosexual activity with men at the church house. The
church investigated and cleared the priest of the allegations.
   Justice O' Donovan ruled that most of the assaults occurred on
Dec. 29, 1989. ``I find that Mrs. Mandela was present on the 29th
... for at least part of the time,'' he said.
   He made no further comment on Mrs. Mandela's involvement.

   Consumer spending posted a moderate 0.6
percent gain in April, the government said Friday in a report that
analysts said was another sign the sluggish economy will avoid a
recession.
   The Commerce Department said consumer spending totaled a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of $3.68 trillion. That followed
0.5 percent increases in both February and March and was the
largest gain since it jumped 1.2 percent in January.
   ``Consumers are willing to spend on goods and services if given
a bargain,'' said David Jones, an economist with Aubrey G. Lanston
&amp; Co., a New York government securities dealer.
   ``Even though spending is selective and moderate, it is holding
up well and is likely to keep the economy out of a recession this
year,'' Jones said.
   Consumer spending is considered a barometer of economic health
since it accounts for about two-thirds of the nation's economic
activity.
   But the department said personal income increased only half as
fast as spending, for a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $4.69
trillion. That was the lowest increase since last September's 0.2
percent and it followed 8 percent annual rate gains during each of
the three previous months.
   As a result, Americans' savings rate _ savings as a percent of
disposable income _ slipped from 5.8 percent in March to 5.5
percent in April. The rate had been 5.5 percent in February, up
from 5.3 percent in January.
   Cynthia Latta, an economist with DRI@McGraw-Hill, a Lexington,
Mass., forecasting organization, said recent spending levels are
not sustainable without matching levels of income growth.
   ``I don't think consumers on their own will push the economy
into a recession,'' she said. ``So while spending will slow, it is
not likely to turn negative.''
   Personal consumption, which includes everything except interest
payments on debt, rose $21.9 billion, up from March's $19.4 billion
increase.
   Purchases of durable goods _ products expected to last at least
three years _ rebounded $3.8 billion from a $3.2 billion drop in
March. Ms. Latta said much of the gain was in automobile sales.
   Purchases of non-durable goods also bounced back, gaining $1.3
billion after falling $400 million the previous month. Services
gained $16.8 billion on top of a $23 billion rise in March.
   The department said both the April and March increases in
personal income were affected by farm subsidy payments. Excluding
subsidies, personal incomes rose 0.5 percent in both months.
   The report said Americans' income after taxes slowed to a 0.2
percent increase from a 0.8 percent gain in March and a 0.7 percent
jump in February. It had risen 0.9 percent in both December and
January.
   The key component of the income category _ wages and salaries _
rose $19.1 billion at an annual rate after a $15.4 billion gain in
March.

   Countdown preparations continued
without incident Friday for space shuttle Columbia, which is
scheduled to lift off next week on an astronomy mission with seven
astronauts.
   Launch is scheduled for 12:38 a.m. EDT Wednesday. The countdown
begins early Sunday morning.
   ``Everything's moving right along, no problems,'' said Lisa
Malone, spokeswoman for the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration.
   Technicians on Friday were making the final connections to
explosive devices on the shuttle's external tank, solid rocket
boosters and ground support equipment.
   Columbia's payload is a $150 million observatory called Astro,
which is composed of four telescopes that will probe ultraviolet
light and X-rays during the nine- to 10-day mission.
   Film was loaded into Astro's Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope on
Thursday, said NASA program scientist Ed Weiler. The film will be
developed after the mission and provide wide-angle views of the sky.
   Columbia's payload bay doors will be closed after Astro's Broad
Band X-Ray Telescope is restocked with argon, a coolant, late
Saturday.
   Columbia's crew is scheduled to arrive at Kennedy Space Center
on Sunday. Four are astronomers who will operate the observatory.

<HEAD>Liberian Leader Says He Would Resign, Hold Elections to End Unrest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Samuel Doe said Friday he is
ready to step down or hold early elections under international
supervision to help end a northern-based rebellion in which
hundreds of Liberians have been killed.
   Doe made the offer at a pro-government rally the day after his
forces announced their first victory against rebels: the recapture
of the strategic Atlantic port of Buchanan in southeastern Liberia.
   The rebel National Patriotic Front of Charles Taylor did not
respond immediately to Doe's offer. The two men have refused to
hold direct negotiations, as the United States has suggested.
   It was not possible to confirm the government's claim its forces
had recaptured Buchanan. Diplomats said they were receiving
conflicting reports on who held Buchanan, Liberia's main port,
which rebels took Sunday. Telephone lines to the city were down.
   Doe told the rally he did not want to remain president if it
meant Liberians had to suffer and die.
   ``I can go into private life while continuing my education at
the university here,'' he said. ``No! No! We want Doe!'' supporters
shouted in response.
   The rally began with a march through the streets of Monrovia.
Demonstrators carried placards denouncing Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast
and Libya for allegedly supporting the rebels.
   ``Gadhafi Kills Peace,'' said one of the banners. ``Ivory Coast,
unfriendly neighbor. Burkina Faso, unfriendly country.''
   Doe also said that, if Liberians wished it, he would invite
international observers and an independent electoral commission to
supervise early elections.
   But the rallying group shouted that it would be interference in
the West African nation's internal affairs.
   Internal and exiled opposition parties have said their
experience at previous polls _ which observers said were rigged _
left them with no confidence in elections due to be held next year.
   Doe did not say when he might hold earlier elections.
   At a news conference Friday, Deputy Information Minister Moses
Washington said 350 rebels were killed in a government ambush as
they tried to infiltrate past Gbarnga, a garrisoned town 107 miles
northeast of Monrovia.
   Washington said government forces retook Buchanan after moving
in slowly to minimize civilian casualities. He gave no figures on
deaths in the Buchanan fighting, saying only that troops were
pursuing rebel commander Moses Duopu, a former Liberian Cabinet
minister, who led forces in the port.
   This appeared to contradict reports that Duopu had broken with
Taylor, another former Doe aide, and was commanding a separate
rebel force in northern Liberia.
   Forces loyal to Doe had mostly avoided contact with the rebels
who invaded from Ivory Coast on Dec. 24. Many soldiers fled to
neighboring Guinea when the insurgents attacked. The rebels
controlled Nimba County, where the invasion began, and most of two
other counties.
   Doe took power in a bloody 1980 coup that ended domination by
freed American slaves who founded Liberia in 1847.

   You've heard of Air Jordan? What about Air
Abdul? Paula Abdul, following in the footsteps of Michael Jordan,
Michael Jackson and others, will have her own line of athletic
shoes.
   L.A. Gear, which also has Jackson and Joe Montana under
contract, announced Thursday the signing of its latest celebrity
shoe salesman. Miss Abdul, a Laker cheerleader-turned-video
choreographer-turned pop star, used to pitch Reeboks, which is now
negotiating with Madonna.
   The endorsement continues a trend by manufacturers who are
increasingly betting on star power to sell athletic shoes. Nike
started the shoe wars with Michael Jordan and Air Jordan.
   Like Jackson and Montana, Miss Abdul, 27, will get a whole line
of shoes bearing her name. A line of sportswear under her name also
is planned, with shoes and garments to appear in stores next
spring. She'll get a commission based on sales as well as cash, a
person familiar with the deal said.
   The deal will yield less than $10 million, in the second tier as
such fees go, the source said on condition of anonymity.

   Oops! Dan did it again.
   Vice President Dan Quayle told 3,000 high school students
Thursday that he was proud to be the first vice president to visit
Wausau since Vice President Calvin Coolidge did so in 1928.
   Wrong, Dan. Coolidge was president in 1928.
   Tom Fischer, principal at Wausau West High School, where Quayle
spoke, said he expected few students even noticed the mistake.
   ``What the teachers and kids realize is here is a guy who is on
the road constantly, giving speech after speech and under public
scrutiny, so those things happen,'' Fischer said. ``He probably
misread a card.''
   Mostlhy, Fischer said, the visit went well.
   ``He was very personable to everybody,'' he said. ``He went out
of his way to shake hands and talk to the kids and he was just very
warm to everyone.''

   Surprise: Sportscaster Brent Musburger agrees
with the critics who wish he'd shut up once in a while.
   ``When I'm watching tapes of a game I did, there are many times
when I get tired of the sound of my own voice,'' Musburger says in
an interview in the June 1 issue of Entertainment Weekly.
   ``I turn the sound off or just shut the damn thing off and walk
away.''
   Musburger, for years the sports anchor at CBS, was fired by the
network the day before he announced the NCAA college basketball
final, his final event at CBS. He signed a month later with ABC,
for whom his first assignment will be the Little League World
Series.
   ``I don't care what you put me on,'' he says in the interview.
``I've done more schlock sports than anybody. I've done the Human
Fly, a guy walking on airplanes.''
   Musburger also acknowledges that he may over-hype events that he
covers.
   ``If I'm not going to be enthusiastic about it, who's going to
be?'' he asks. ``It would be virtually impossible for someone who
shares the responsibility for making an event a success to be a
pure journalist.''

choose their heroes carefully _ and set an example for their
younger peers.
   ``Be careful who your role models are. Pick the good ones,'' the
county singer told the 1990 graduting class of Eakin Elementary
School on Wednesday.
   ``It doesn't hurt to start thinking or dreaming now. Not only
will you learn things in the classroom, but you learn things from
people from other states and other countries,'' she told the
72-member class.
   McEntire said that when she was a youngster her idols were just
a few years older.
   ``Kids in the first grade will be looking up to you, so watch
what you say or do,'' said McEntire, who had her first child in
February.
   McEntire is best known for her hits ``Whoever's in New England''
and ``Cathy's Clown.''

   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev today
branded the leaders of secessionist Lithuania ``adventurists'' and
called on them to rescind their March 11 declaration of
independence.
   ``We have great reserves of willpower, but we are looking for
ways'' to end the impasse, Gorbachev said at a news conference with
visiting French President Francois Mitterrand.
   He repeated an earlier appeal to the Lithuanians to back away
from their independence declaration and follow a new Soviet law
that requires a referendum for any of the 15 republics to secede.
   ``Let's return to March 10 and start the constitutional
process,'' he said at the news conference, which was broadcast live
on Soviet television.
   Gorbachev, half-joking, said the Lithuanians had decided ``not
to make a gift to President Gorbachev on the eve of his visit to
the United States,'' where he is to meet with President Bush next
week.
   He also justified the use of army troops to occupy Communist
Party buildings in Lithuania in March and economic sanctions that
included cutting off oil and natural gas shipments.
   ``What happened in Lithuania was that a group of adventurists is
speculating on such issues as independence,'' he said.
   ``I can say that in a similar situation, the American president
would put the situation under control in 24 hours.''
   Gorbachev also has decreed that the other two Baltic states,
Latvia and Estonia, violated Soviet law by taking more moderate
steps toward independence.
   Leaders of the three republics, all forcibly annexed in 1940,
say they are willing to compromise but will not surrender their
goal of seceding from the Soviet Union.
   Gorbachev has refused to negotiate with Lithuania unless it
suspends the independence declaration. He told four Lithuanian
legislators on Thursday that if they agreed to suspend the
declaration and follow Moscow's procedures for secession, Lithuania
could gain independence in as little as two years, said one of the
legislators, Vaidotas Antanaitis.
   As a result of Kremlin sanctions against Lithuania, numerous
factories across the republic have been forced to shut down,
throwing an estimated 19,000 people out of work. Lithuanian
officials said that central hot water supplies were shut off
throughout the republic today because regional distribution
stations had run out of oil.
   In the Latvian capital of Riga, legislative today leaders
rejected Gorbachev's May 14 order voiding their declaration of
independence, a spokesman said.
   Ivars Embrekts, a spokeseman for the presidium _ or executive
council _ of Latvia's Supreme Council, said the body sent Gorbachev
a telegram that said: ``The constitution of the U.S.S.R. does not
give the president of the U.S.S.R. the right to repeal laws or
decisions which have been taken by the Supreme Council of the
Republic of Latvia.''
   It said the dispute should be resolved in negotiations.
   In Tallinn, centrist and radical deputies clashed today over
what role the new Estonian Congress, elected by ethnic Estonians,
should have in relation to the republic's traditional Supreme
Soviet.
   In Vilnius, the Lithuanian capital, a spokesman for Lithuania's
Supreme Council said that legislature's executive council met
behind closed doors to hear a report on Thursday's talks in Moscow
between Gorbachev and the four Lithuanian lawmakers.
   But another spokesman, Aidas Palubinskas, said later the issue
did not come up today.
   Antanaitis, speaking in a telephone interview, said that at
Thursday's meeting Gorbachev also threatened to impose presidential
rule on Lithuania unless it suspends its declaration of
independence.
   ``On the one hand, there were concessions, but also threats that
if you continue taking action on your own, we'll take such
measures,'' Antanaitis said of Gorbachev's statements.
   The New York Times today quoted other participants in the
meeting as saying that Gorbachev acknowledged there was pressure on
him to impose presidential rule, but he said he did not see that as
a reasonable act in this case.
   Presidential rule would be a major escalation in the test of
wills between the Kremlin and the republic of 3.8 million people.
   Under such rule, Lithuania's parliament and government could be
replaced with officials appointed by Moscow.
   Ethnic Russian residents of Lithuania who oppose independence,
as well as some Soviet politicians, have pressed Gorbachev for
weeks to impose presidential rule. But he said on April 10 that
such a step would be extreme and used only in a civil conflict.

<TEXT>
   President Bush called the presidents
of Nicaragua and Panama today to tell them $720 million in U.S.
help will soon be on its way after Congress finally approved his
emergency aid package for the hemisphere's two newest democracies.
   Bush ``will sign the aid bill as soon as he receives it,''
deputy White House press secretary Stephen Hart said. That could
come later today or Saturday, he added.
   The White House announced as Bush arrived here for a Memorial
Day weekend vacation that he had telephoned both Nicaraguan
President Violeta Chamorro and Panamanian President Guillermo
Endara to inform them that Congress had finally passed the
emergency aid early today.
   The two Latin leaders ``expressed their gratitude for the
congressional action and thanked (Bush) for his efforts on behalf
of their countries,'' Hart said in a statement.
   ``They stated that this is a major step forward in solidifying
and supporting the growth of democracy in Panama and Nicaragua,''
said Hart.
   Congress gave final approval to the $420 million for Panama and
$300 million for Nicaragua as the lawmakers rushed to adjourn for
their own holiday weekend recess. Bush had asked for $800 million
in early March.
   The lawmakers whittled that down, and padded the bill with $4 in
hometown spending for every dollar of Latin aid.
   When finally sent to Bush on a 308-108 House vote, the measure
had swelled to more than $4 billion. It included programs that
ranged from filling in a collapsed utility tunnel on a street in
Salisbury, N.C., to giving the Samoan islands a $750,000 ferry boat.
   Chamorro is seeking to revive Nicaragua's government after 11
years of Sandinista rule, while Panama is still recovering from
U.S. trade sanctions and last December's invasion.
   It also included other foreign assistance: $75 million to meet
refugee needs around the world, $45 million in anti-narcotics aid
to Bolivia and Peru, $30 million for aid to Caribbean countries and
$30 million for Africa.
   But overshadowing those amounts was several billion dollars in
domestic programs, such as the $1.2 billion needed to make up a
shortfall in food stamp funds for the current fiscal year, which
ends Sept. 30; $545 million for veterans benefits; $166 million for
Head Start; and $432 million for fighting forest fires.
   In what amounts to the first application of a ``peace dividend''
from reduced East-West tensions, roughly half of the new spending
is being financed by cuts in this year's proposed Pentagon budget _
cuts agreed to by the administration.
   The measure includes $110 million to help the Census Bureau
finish its lagging 1990 head count and $216 million for disaster
aid, primarily for southern states affected by flooding and
hurricanes. Most of that was wanted both by lawmakers and by the
White House.
   But there were many other items that could make Bush hold his
nose when he signs the measure, most pet projects of individual
members of Congress.
   Among the items approved were nearly 40 individual grants
through the Department of Housing and Urban Development totaling
$28 million, most of them for communities whose members of Congress
are on the House and Senate Appropriations committees.
   On the list was $400,000 to fill in a collapsed utility tunnel
in Salisbury, N.C., sought by Rep. Bill Hefner, D-N.C., and
$990,000 to fix up a waterfront park in Bay City, Mich., in the
district of Democratic Rep. Bob Traxler.
   Rep. Robert Walker, R-Pa., complained that the pork-barrel
allocation process was no different than the political favoritism
that led to the HUD scandal Congress is now investigating. ``If
it's corrupt at HUD, it's corrupt here,'' Walker said.
   A $6 million provision sought by Rep. Neal Smith, D-Iowa, would
buy land near Des Moines, Iowa, from a power company and turn it
into a wildlife refuge. Smith argued on the House floor that the
purchase was ``an unusual and unexpected opportunity.''
   Republicans complained the provision was a special-interest item
and noted that it was opposed by the Fish and Wildlife Service. But
the Democratic-controlled House voted 246-160 to leave the
provision in.
   Among other additions were:
   _Transfer of a $750,000 ship from the Defense Department to
American Samoa to provide transportation among the islands. The
provision was written into the bill by Sen. Daniel Inouye,
D-Hawaii, a senior member of the Senate Appropriations panel, who
found it difficult to get around during visits to the islands.
   _An order for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration to build an experimental fish farming laboratory at
Stuttgart, Ark., the state of Democratic Appropriations Committee
member Sen. Dale Bumpers, a Democrat.
   _$12 million to modify the Mormon Island auxiliary dam in
California, added by House Appropriations Committee member Vic
Fazio, D-Calif.
   _A discount of more than 80 percent for Israel on the fees that
normally would be paid for U.S. guarantees for $400 million in
housing loans, along with a waiver of many of the usual
requirements of the housing program. The provision was added by
Sens. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., and Robert Kasten, R-Wis.
   _A reminder to the Postal Service not to move the post office
out of Holly Springs, Miss., in the district of Democratic Rep.
Jamie Whitten, chairman of the House Appropriations Committee.
   _A $185 million FBI automated fingerprint lab planned for
Clarksburg, W.Va., attached by Senate Appropriations Committee
Chairman Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va.

   A woman who could swim, play the drums
and even change a baby's diaper despite being born without arms
died after she was dragged by a horse that spooked while tied to
her waist.
   Stacey McInroe Conner of Stephenville suffered severe head
injuries and died Wednesday at Harris Methodist Fort Worth
Hospital, family members said.
   The 22-year-old college student, who learned to ride at an early
age, was feeding her 2-year-old filly, with the horse's lead rope
tied around her waist, before the accident.
   ``Something spooked the little horse and she just took off,
dragging Stacey,'' said Ms. Conner's mother, Lometa Reed. ``She was
out there by herself and a neighbor saw her, cut the lead rope and
called the ambulance.''
   Friends and family said Ms. Conner never let her disability
prevent her from pursuing a variety of interests.
   She parachuted from 13,000 feet in November, strapped to a
friend, and skiied for the first time in December. She could swim,
ride horses, fish, play drums, and used her feet to change the
diapers of a friend's squirming baby.
   ``Even though she was handicapped by having no arms, she just
couldn't accept that she couldn't do anything like anybody else,''
said Leon Manley, principal of Stephenville High School.
   ``She actually wrote with her feet,'' Manley said.
   Ms. Conner's disability was blamed on a virus her mother
contracted while pregnant.
   The child learned to swim while still a toddler and later
excelled at soccer. She played the drums with her feet in the high
school band and learned to ride on a Shetland pony.
   ``About the gutsiest lady I ever saw,'' said Darrell Allison of
Fort Worth, a family friend who knew Ms. Conner since she was a
child. He arranged the skydiving venture in November.
   Ms. Conner, would have graduated next year from Tarleton State
University, where she was majoring in accounting.
   Stephenville is about 50 miles southwest of Fort Worth.

<TEXT>
   One deadlocked school board race was broken
when candidates played a winner-take-all game of high card draw. A
second tie in the same county was decided by picking a name from a
hat.
   Bloomfield School Board contender Milton Johnson moved into the
November general election on Thursday after he drew an ace and
opponent Richard Ketelson drew a jack, Knox County Clerk Virginia
Buerman said.
   Both men had 105 votes after a recount of the May 15 primary
vote.
   In another tie-breaker, Jerry Kitto's name was drawn out of a
hat to give him a four-year term on the Santee School Board. Kitto
had tied with his brother, Richard. A recount showed each had 30
votes.
   Richard didn't appear at the county courthouse for a high card
showdown, so after waiting an hour both names were thrown into a
hat and Jerry's name was drawn, Ms. Buerman said.
   The Nebraska secretary of state's office was consulted to be
sure the drawings were the correct way to break the ties, she said.
   The ties were broken in Center because that's the Knox County
seat. And despite it's name, Center is in extreme northeastern
Nebraska.

   The congressional report, which came a day after the Navy
reopened its investigation into the disaster, said the explosion
could have resulted from gunpowder bags in the ship's guns being
rammed at ``higher than normal speeds.''
   The report was presented to the Senate Armed Services Committee
by the General Accounting Office, which investigated the Navy's
controversial finding that gunner's mate Clayton Hartwig probably
sabotaged the battleship in the April 19, 1989, explosion.
   Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn, D-Ga., said today's
testimony by the GAO report ``cast grave doubts on the Navy's
findings'' that foreign material had been found in the gun barrel.
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, responding to the GAO report,
said he would ``reserve judgement'' until further investigation.
   ``They did the best job they could. Now there's new evidence,
new information that warrants reopening the investigation,'' Cheney
said. ``But I think at this point I'd want to keep my powder dry,
so to speak, until we have a better sense of exactly what this new
information may contribute.''
   Hartwig's sister, Kathy Kubicina, who attended the hearing, told
reporters, ``My brother was only a victim. ... I hope after today
this will get rid of any doubt in anyone's mind.''
   Retired Capt. Fred Moosally, the USS Iowa's skipper at the time
of the explosion and an outspoken critic of the investigation, sat
in the front row during the hearing. But he declined to comment,
saying, ``I'm only here to listen.''
   The Navy issued a statement saying it ``will continue to test
additional theories dealing with the possible causes of the
explosion.''
   ``Technical tests continue and results of that testing will be
made public as soon as the analysis and report is completed and
reviewed by the secretary of the Navy,'' the statement said. ``Any
further discussion on aspects of the additional testing would be
premature at this present time.''
   On Thursday, the Navy ordered a halt to any firing of 16-inch
guns aboard the service's four battleships after an ``unexplained''
ignition of some gunpowder bags during testing.
   Nunn said the GAO finding ``will essentially eviscerate the
Navy's conclusion'' that the explosion aboard the USS Iowa was the
result of a wrongful, intentional act.
   The GAO said tests at the Sandia National Laboratories ``could
not corroborate the Navy's technical finding that an improvised
chemical device initiated the explosion.''
   Last fall, the Navy said Hartwig, who was killed in the
explosion, ``most probably'' had placed ``some type of detonation
device'' between gunpowder bags when he supervised the loading of
the warship's guns.
   The GAO analysis made no mention specifically of Hartwig in its
report.
   The report said the Sandia Laboratory was ``confident in its
findings, which conclude that the foreign materials that the Navy
found were not inconsistent with the nominal levels found
throughout gun turrets and were consistent with the maritime
environment.''
   Elements of calcium and chlorine, which the Navy contended came
from a detonator placed between the gunpowder bags, were readily
found in turret No.1 aboard the Iowa and in turrets on the
battleships New Jersey and Wisconsin, the report said.
   ``Therefore, Sandia could not corroborate the Navy's finding
that such foreign material was evidence of a detonator,'' the
report said.
   The Sandia Laboratory testing also questioned the Navy's finding
that impact and compression of the gunpowder bags did not
contribute to the Iowa explosion.
   ``Sandia believes that a possible alternate scenario to the
Navy's finding of a deliberate act is that an unintentional
high-speed over-ram of the powder bags combined with the impact
sensitivity of the powder led to the explosion,'' the report said.
   ``Sandia does not consider its study complete, in the sense that
a clear and definite cause of the explosion has been identified,
and it recommends areas of further investigation by the Navy.''
   The GAO also recommended in its report that because of problems
with manning and training for the World War II-era battleships and
their complex gun systems, the battleships that remain in the
Navy's fleet ``seem to be top candidates for decommissioning as we
look for ways to scale back U.S. forces.''
   All four of the Navy's battleships are now in port _ the USS
Iowa and the USS Wisconsin at Norfolk, Va., and the USS New Jersey
and the USS Missouri at Long Beach, Calif. The Iowa and New Jersey
are slated for retirement this year to save money and the
investigators' suggestion that the Missouri and Wisconsin be
mothballed would remove all battleships from the nation's arsenal.
   Sen. John Warner, R-Va., the committee's ranking Republican,
disagreed with statements asserting that the Navy had been involved
in a coverup and should apologize. ``It's far too early ... to make
such conclusions,'' Warner said.
   Earlier in the day, Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, said ``I
think some of those who headed up the investigation ought to be
called on the carpet. ... I think it is posible some heads will
roll.''
   The Navy's report last fall said the fireball aboard the Iowa
``most probably'' was an intentional act by Hartwig, who it said
was upset about the breakup of his friendship with another crew
member, Kendall Truitt.
   ``It's long overdue,'' Truitt said today of the Navy's decision
to reopen the investigation.
   Hartwig's father, Earl Hartwig, himself a Navy gunner's mate in
World War II, said in Cleveland: ``This is what we've been saying
all along. My son is not guilty. The Navy was barking up the wrong
tree.''
   The ignition of several gunpowder bags came Thursday during
``follow-up testing which the Navy has been doing periodically as
new theories were brought forward'' since the Iowa blast and the
Navy's review of it, the service said.
   After conducting a four-month examination of the Iowa explosion
_ and about 20,000 technical tests of gunpowder blasts _ the Navy
contended in September that it had found no technical reason for
the explosion.
   The service admitted it only had circumstantial evidence for its
finding because all witnesses died in the fire.
   Members of Congress and others attacked that conclusion as
unsupported by evidence and faulted the investigation as inadequate.
   Ten days ago Nunn wrote Adm. Carlisle A.H. Trost, the chief of
naval operations, to complain the service was not moving fast
enough to act on evidence that the Iowa blast might have been
caused by a friction problem, Pentagon sources said.
   The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the Navy
was informed several weeks ago about the results of tests conducted
by the Sandia Laboratory in Albuquerque, N.M.
   In the new experiment, five 96-pound bags filled with gunpowder
pellets were dropped in a vertical column with weights on top of
them, in an attempt to recreate the force that rams the bags
through a 16-inch gun barrel on a warship.
   ``On the 18th try they got a detonation,'' said the source, who
asked not to be quoted by name.

<TEXT>
   The revolution that toppled one-party rule
in Poland last year remains a work-in-progress, and the next stage
of demolition occurs Sunday in democratic elections for 52,000
local council members nationwide.
   They are the first fully free elections since World War II and
are expected to root out thousands of Communist holdovers _ many of
whom ran their towns and villages as virtual dictators _ from their
last bastion of authority.
   The aim is to restore, after a four-decade absence, the concept
of freely chosen local governments empowered to raise and spend
local revenues and free from direct control of the central
government.
   ``Regardless who wins the elections ... it will be the end of
totalitarian authority in Poland,'' Election Commissioner Jerzy
Stepien said at a news conference.
   ``This is the most important event in Poland in the last 40
years,'' said 23-year-old medical student Jerzy Kryszton, studying
a list of Solidarity Civic Committee candidates posted at a Warsaw
campaign office.
   ``First of all, these are the first really democratic and free
elections in Poland. Secondly, this will be the only chance and the
only way to get rid of the local mafias, to get rid of the local
Communist activist who still controls everything in the
countryside.''
   Although the electoral battles are being fought locally, the
results are being watched nationally in the country of 38 million
as an important test for the Solidarity movement, whose unity is
strained between its trade union and political wings.
   Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki took to the hustings in the
campaign's closing days to build support for the ballot and for the
candidates being put forth by the Solidarity-linked Citizens
Committees, still Poland's most potent political force.
   Scores of new independent political parties have arisen since
last year's parliamentary elections. The voting will show if any of
them is developed enough to grab a significant chunk of
Solidarity's following.
   Among those vying are the Confederation for an Independent
Poland and the Christian National Union on the right wing; the
environmentally minded Green Party; the libertarian Union of Real
Politics; the center-right Christian Democratic Party of Labor;
several similarly named Peasant parties and at least four Socialist
parties.
   The main successor to the now-dissolved Communist Party, the
Social Democracy of the Polish Republic, is struggling to remain on
the political stage.
   In addition to those endorsed by political groups, about 40
percent of the approximately 146,000 people seeking seats are
independents or are backed only by local resident or neighborhood
associations.
   Government officials hope for a high turnout but fear many Poles
alienated by the painful economic policies will stay away in a
passive protest.
   Polls so far indicate a 60 percent turnout, slightly lower than
the 62 percent that took part in the partially free parliamentary
voting last June that gave Solidarity a landslide and paved the way
to the East bloc's first non-Communist-led government in September.
   ``I'm not going to vote,'' said Stalislawa Czajkowska, a
40-year-old secretary. ``I have lost all hope that things might
change for the better here. Solidarity has achieved nothing but an
even bigger mess,'' she said, citing rising crime and higher prices.
   ``I doubt it is possible to achieve anything in this country
with this society,'' said photographer Antoni Gontarki, 42, who
said he probably would stay home election day. If he did vote, it
would be for one of the extreme anti-Communist parties like the
Confederation for an Independent Poland.
   Poland had independent local councils and mayors during its 21
years of independence between World War I and World War II. But by
1950, the Communists who seized control had done away with the
local governments that reappeared after the war.
   After the adoption of a Soviet-modeled constitution in 1952,
local People's Councils were established. But candidates could only
run with Communist Party approval and the councils were essentially
local agents of the central government in Warsaw _ which provided
all their operating money and could dismiss council members and
reverse decisions.
   A large part of the government's role in the elections has been
simply to explain to people what local governments are and how they
function in the West.
   The elections will also mark a huge divestiture of wealth from
the central government, which owns more than 90 percent of Polish
property. About one-fifth of these assets _ including land,
buildings and factories _ will be turned over to the newly
established local governments overnight.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said today that the
Soviet Union would review its policies on European arms control and
security negotiations if a reunited Germany joined NATO.
   The Soviet leader told a news conference that Western leaders
seem to be assuming a unified Germany would join the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization, and said Moscow was very wary of that prospect.
   ``What should we do then about all the negotiating processes,
including the European process, the CSCE process, the Vienna
disarmament processs? Then we must take a fresh look at whether we
should pursue the same policy, whether we should base it on the
same approaches,'' Gorbachev told reporters in the Soviet Foreign
Ministry press center.
   The superpowers are involved in negotiations on reducing their
nuclear and conventional forces and hope to reach some agreements
during the summit between President Bush and Gorbachev in
Washington from May 31 to June 3. CSCE refers to the 35-nation
Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, which deals with
military security, economic cooperation and human rights.
   Gorbachev's remarks contained the Kremlin's most dire warning
yet about what steps it would take if a reunited Germany joins the
Western military alliance. The Soviet preference, repeated by
Gorbachev today, was that a reunited Germany belong to both NATO
and the Warsaw Pact.
   Gorbachev said discussion of German reunification took up 70
percent of his talks earlier in the day with French President
Francois Mitterrand, who also appeared at the news conference.
   The Bush administration favors NATO membership for a reunited
Germany.
   The Soviet leader did not say his country would withdraw from
the European negotiating processes, which cover reductions of
troops and tanks on the continent and other security issues, and
did not specify how the Kremlin's positions in those talks might
change.
   He justified the policy review by saying NATO would take similar
action if the shoe were on the other foot.
   ``If a unified Germany should find itself part of the Warsaw
Treaty, then I'm sure the Western countries would immediately get
together to discuss how they should proceed further,'' Gorbachev
said.
   Skewing a reunited Germany in either direction, he said, would
upset the strategic balance in European negotiations.
   ``There is a question whether these processes would not become
hostages to that kind of imbalance,'' he said.
   The Kremlin chief told reporters he issued the warning ``not to
try to scare any of you so that you would begin to reflect right
away what kind of trump card is being prepared by the Soviet
Union,'' but to appeal for a joint search for ``the right
solutions, (so) that we not weaken the positive processes in
international relations.

   Two members of a radical environmentalist
group have been arrested in connection with a pipe bomb that blew
their car apart and injured both of them, police said today.
   Judi Bari, 40, and Darryl Cherney, 33, were booked for
investigation of possession and transportation of explosives, said
Oakland Police Lt. Mike Sims.
   Bari was in serious but stable condition today under police
guard at a hospital after undergoing surgery for a fractured
pelvis. Cherney was treated for a minor injury above his eye and
jailed, Sims said.
   Members of Earth First! said Bari and Cherney were targets of
the bomb after receiving several death threats in recent weeks. But
Sims said there was strong evidence from searches of various
locations that the two were knowingly transporting the bomb.
   ``Based on our determination of the placement of the device in
the car, we believe they should have known it was there. We believe
it went off accidently,'' Sims said.
   He said officers found no more explosives in their searches, but
turned up other evidence he would not discuss.
   ``I don't believe it,'' said Mark Huntington, a friend of the
pair and an Earth First! supporter. ``If the police produced
evidence and put it on TV, I still wouldn't believe it. I think
they planted it ... The FBI has a lot of reasons to get rid of
Darryl and Judi and shut down Redwood Summer.''
   ``For them to say they could possibly be involved in what was
obviously a threat on their lives is really outrageous,'' said Mike
Roselle, an Earth First! founder.
   ``They would never have anything to do with bombs or guns. They
are completely non-violent. ... No way,'' said Earth First!
spokeswoman Kelpie Wilson.
   As many as 50 members of Earth First! and their supporters
crowded the Police Department lobby in what they called a vigil,
vowing not to leave until Cherney was released. The crowd sang,
played guitars and made signs reading ``Free Cherney,'' ``Trees Not
Bombs'' and ``Smash FBI Frame-Ups.''
   Police also refused to say why officers, on Thursday night,
blocked the headquarters of the group Seeds of Peace, which has
worked with Earth First!. Officers searched a van parked near the
peace group's headquarters on the Oakland-Berkeley border and
removed several items from the van.
   Cherney, of Piercy, and Bari, of Ukiah, in Northern California,
were in the San Francisco Bay area to drum up support for a summer
campaign to slow timber cutting in the old-growth forests of
Northern California.
   Cherney was driving Bari's station wagon near Oakland High
School when the bomb went off inside the car shortly before noon.
The car continued on about a block before hitting two parked cars.
   Both injured activists were organizing the ``Redwood Summer''
campaign of continual demonstrations to block what some
environmentalists call excessive logging, Earth First! spokeswoman
Wilson said.
   Pacific Lumber Co., which has been a target of Earth First!
protests, issued a statement late Thursday saying the company does
not condone or promote violence _ ``be it spiking trees, blowing up
power lines or bombing cars'' _ and hopes Bari and Cherney fully
recover from ``this appalling incident.''
   Wilson said Bari is a well-known ``eco warrior'' who advocated
``tree spiking,'' the driving of long metal spikes into trees to
damage lumbering equipment.

<HEAD>Trade Deficit Shrinks</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Economics Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The U.S. trade deficit shrank to $26.4 billion
from January through March, the smallest quarterly imbalance in
more than six years, the government reported Friday.
   The Commerce Department said the 8.2 percent improvement in the
trade balance was a result of record-high export sales that offset
the highest volume of foreign oil shipments in more than 12 years.
   The improving trade performance, if it continues, would be good
news for the U.S. economy. Over the past three years, rising
exports have accounted for more than one-third of total domestic
growth as American manufacturers enjoyed a boom in foreign sales.
   In other economic news Friday, the Commerce Department reported
that consumer spending shot up by 0.6 percent in April. However,
the National Association of Realtors reported that sales of
existing homes fell 2.1 percent in April.
   The better-than-expected performance sent many economists
scurrying to revise their trade forecasts for the year. Many had
been expecting that weaker foreign demand and a rising oil bill
would translate into a worsening trade deficit.
   ``We have continued strong export growth and that is leading to
better trade numbers than a lot of people were predicting,
including us,'' said Howard Lewis, vice president for international
economic affairs at the National Association of Manufacturers.
   David Jones, an economist with Aubrey G. Lanston &amp; Co., said
export growth should continue to be an important source of strength
for the U.S. economy for some time to come.
   ``Europe and Germany in particular and to a lesser degree Asia
will be the locomotive for U.S. growth,'' he said.
   However, some analysts cautioned that it was too soon to tell
whether the first quarter performance would continue for the rest
of the year. They noted that oil imports are surging because U.S.
production has dropped to 25-year lows and that the strength of the
U.S. dollar in comparison to the Japanese yen could start showing
up in rising imports of Japanese products.
   Cynthia Latta, an economist at DRI-McGraw Hill, said her
forecasting company was still expecting only a small improvement in
the overall trade deficit when compared with 1989.
   For the first quarter, U.S. exports rose 4.7 percent, to an
all-time high of $96.04 billion. Imports were also at a record
level, reflecting the surge in oil demand. They climbed 1.6
percent, to $122.4 billion.
   The report Friday on merchandise trade as calculated on a
balance-of-payments basis confirmed trends already noted in the
department's monthly merchandise trade reports. They showed a first
quarter deficit of $23.9 billion.
   The disparity in the two figures comes from the fact that
Friday's report excludes military sales by the U.S. government and
makes other minor adjustments to the monthly figures.
   The increase in consumer spending was the biggest gain since
January and was double the 0.3 percent rise in personal incomes
last month.
   Analysts said the strength in consumer spending coupled with the
strong gains in export sales were good indications for future
economic growth.
   The decrease in sales of existing home was the third decline in
the past four months, with high mortgage rates blamed for the
weakness.
   The first-quarter trade performance marked the second
consecutive quarterly improvement in the deficit. In the fourth
quarter, the gap between exports and imports had fallen 3.5
percent, to $28.7 billion.
   Exports of machine tools, industrial supplies and consumer goods
climbed 4 percent to a record $85.1 billion in the first quarter.
More than one-half of this increase was attributed to a rise in
civilian aircraft shipments after the end of the Boeing strike.
   Exports of farm products were up 7 percent to $11 billion with
increases recorded in overseas sales of wheat, vegetables, fruits
and nuts. Corn exports were down, reflecting sharply lower
shipments to the Soviet Union.
   Average prices of corn and cotton increased 2 percent while
prices of other commodities changed little, the government said.
   Imports of petroleum surged 17 percent in the first quarter to
$15.6 billion, with the average number of barrels imported daily
climbing to 8.9 million, the highest level since the third quarter
of 1977.
   The average price per barrel increased to $19.47, the highest
since the first quarter of 1986, when the price per barrel was
$17.65.
   America's deficits declined with several countries, including
Japan, down $1.9 billion to $10.4 billion for the first quarter.

<HEAD>Swiss Lawyer Testifies Regarding Marcos Swiss Bank Accounts</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Imelda Marcos reportedly met recently with a
lawyer hired to fight the Philippine government's effort to seize
billions of dollars she and her late husband allegedly stashed in
Swiss banks, a witness testified today.
   Sergio Salvioni, an attorney representing the government in
Manila, told a U.S. District Court jury he was told of the New York
meeting by Bruno DePreux, who he said had identified himself as
representing Mrs. Marcos, the former Philippine first lady.
   ``He said he met Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos in Honolulu two
times and he met Imelda Marcos one time here in the continental
United States,'' Salvioni said. ``The last time was more or less
two to three weeks ago, here in New York.''
   Under questioning by Assistant U.S. Attorney Charles LaBella,
Salvioni quoted DePreux as saying he originally was hired to
represent both Mrs. Marcos and her husband after Marcos' ouster as
president of the Philippines in early 1986. Marcos died last year
in Hawaiian exile.
   ``And now he represents Mrs. Marcos and her heirs,'' Salvioni
said.
   Mrs. Marcos is accused of having helped her husband steal more
than $220 million from their country's treasury, using the money to
support a luxury lifestyle and investments including four secretly
purchased New York office buildings.
   Salvioni, a member of the Swiss parliament, flew to New York
from Geneva to testify. Prosecutors hoped he would help prove the
Marcoses used secret accounts in at least eight Swiss banks to hold
some of the embezzled funds during Marcos' 20-year reign.
   Judge John F. Keenan allowed Salvioni to testify before jurors
on certain details after rejecting defense protests that his
information would be ``explosive and prejudicial'' to Mrs. Marcos.
   Keenan turned aside defense arguments that Salvioni's remarks
quoting DePreux were ``hearsay'' and therefore inadmissible, but
barred any references to actual details of the bank accounts.
   Mrs. Marcos, wearing her customary black, showed no visible
emotion as the Swiss lawyer explained the efforts by President
Corazon Aquino's government to gain access to the Swiss accounts.

Organization chairman Yasser Arafat's 50-minute speech Friday to
the United Nations Security Council. He spoke in Arabic. An English

   ``When the Palestine Liberation Organization supported by the

   ``It was not the insanity of an individual or his derangement,

massacre of Black Sunday (in which seven Arab workers were killed
by an Israeli gunman on May 20). The primary responsibility falls
on the insanity and derangement of the whole system, a system which
is haunted by mythical ghosts, by illusions of defunct racial
superiority, and by the obsession with expansion and invasion which
stems from the stupid arrogance of military superiority in order to
create `Greater Israel' ...

live ammunition, to the use of internationally prohibited poison
gases which have caused more than 6,000 miscarriages and permanent

committed by Israel against the Palestinian people in the occupied
territories and as a consequence of its breach of the Fourth Geneva
Convention relative to the treatment of civilians in time of war
and also for its refusal to implement the relevant international
international resolutions, and for its deliberate defiance and for
impeding the peace process in the Middle East...
   ``Obligations and commitment to the human heritage and to the
concepts of justice and righteousness to which that heritage have
been dedicated, require that your esteemed council decides upon the
formation of an international investigation committee from members
of the council to investigate all the crimes against humanity which
have been perpetrated by the Israeli government against the
Palestinian people...
   ``In reaffirming that our choice of the path of peace is a
genuine strategic alternative we also affirm our right to continue
our resistance and our self-defense until an end is put to the
Israeli occupation. That is a sacred right guaranteed to us by the
law of human rights, the United Nations Charter, international
decisions, and by the will of the Palestinian people. The heroic
peoples' intefadeh will continue against the Israeli occupation
until we wrest our right to freedom and national independence on
our national soil.''

   The United States will make the first
invitation for foreign participation in the superconducting super
collider to Japan and South Korea, Deputy Secretary of Energy
Henson Moore said Friday.
   Moore and a team of administration officials are scheduled to
visit Japan and South Korea next week to discuss the project with
government officials.
   ``The point is to begin the process, to officially ask them to
join us, to answer their questions and to discuss with them what we
think is appropriate participation ... and get their feedback,''
Moore said.
   Moore said foreign participation was typical in all large
science labs and Congress has insisted on it for the collider, to
be built south of Dallas.
   The collider will be a 54-mile tunnel, where protons will crash
into each other at high speeds at the direction of superconducting
magnets. Scientists hope the particles will break apart, yielding
clues to the fundamental nature of matter.
   A similar trip to Europe is likely in October, Moore said,
although India is the only country that has formally expressed
interest in the collider. It sent a letter of intent to pledge $50
million.
   Japan and South Korea have been waiting ``for this visit to
officially begin their considerations within their governments,''
Moore said.
   But Moore said both countries had indicated interest in the
giant atom smasher. He refused to elaborate.
   ``It may well be a year before we have any kind of solid feeling
from the Japanese government and Korean government,'' Moore said.
``We hope to have some indication of interest on this trip.''
   The House earlier this month authorized spending $5 billion on
the approximately $8 billion project. The rest is to be made up
from outside sources, such as foreign investors. Texas has pledged
$1 billion.

<HEAD>Beleaguered Soviet Premier Tries to Calm Panicked Consumers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CAREY GOLDBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A beleaguered Soviet premier appealed to consumers
Friday to stop their panic buying of food, triggered by his
announcement of plans for sharp price increases, and urged
lawmakers to quickly approve economic reforms.
   Opposition deputies in parliament demanded a no-confidence vote
aimed at bringing down Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov's government, but
he got one important voice of support for his program: from
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   ``I'm hoping in the end, after all the debates _ and they won't
be simple _ we'll agree that we have to move toward a market. I'm
sure of this,'' Gorbachev said at a news conference.
   Ryzhkov's plan, broadcast on national television Thursday,
proposes tripling the price of bread and other flour-based products
on July 1 and increasing the prices of most other consumer goods in
January.
   It envisions a five-year gradual shift to a government-regulated
market economy by freeing most prices, raising taxes, selling off
state property, and reducing central control of industry.
   Announcement of the plan triggered immediate rushes to stores
for macaroni and bread, Ryzhkov told reporters at the Kremlin.
``Now this wave for bread and bread products has already rolled
through half the country, and it's gotten to Moscow,'' he said.
   ``I am appealing for restraint and calm,'' said Ryzhkov, looking
haggard and with his voice ragged from fatigue.
   ``Tension is growing. We're getting a lot of telegrams
expressing concern: `How are we going to live?''' Ryzhkov told the
Supreme Soviet parliament that must approve his economic plan.
   The premier, who bears responsibility for the economic program,
indicated that if it led to a vote of no-confidence against his
government, he would abide by the outcome. ``If there is no
confidence in the government, then what?'' he asked. ``A new
government will work.''
   Opposition deputies in the Supreme Soviet have already demanded
a no-confidence vote after the legislature votes on the economic
plan. They have said they expect it to fail, but believe they have
to make the political gesture.
   Deputy after deputy, both conservatives and radicals, took the
podium Friday to attack the government plan.
   Ryzhkov said the criticism had helped the government see ``the
weak sides'' of the program and should continue into next week, but
urged a quick decision on whether bread prices should rise as
planned. ``You have to decide, because this question is so
difficult for us and for the people,'' he said.
   Bread is the staple of the Soviet diet, virtually the only
product that's always readily available and remains cheap at about
32 cents a loaf.
   In the Ukraine, long known as the Soviet Union's breadbasket,
the republic's prime minister said his government would fight
Ryzhkov's plan, Ukrainian activists reported.
   Miners in the Ukraine's Donetsk coal region will consider
calling for a countrywide coal strike to protest the plan when they
meet June 11, according to the Rukh Press, an arm of the Ukrainian
popular front.
   Supreme Soviet deputy Mikhail Bronstein warned that the entire
country would need a ration card system to make it through the
transition period.
   Ryzhkov indicated after his report Thursday that increased
rationing might be needed. Most regions of the country already have
some form of rationing.
   Radical economist Pavel Bunich told the Supreme Soviet the
government had rejected more severe ``shock therapy'' reforms only
to offer ``shock therapy without the therapy'' _ reforms that will
hurt without leading to a real market system. Bunich proposed
putting the whole plan back on the government drawing board.
   Ryzhkov acknowledged that the country will ``have to live
through a pretty hard period,'' as the market reforms take effect.
But he pledged government support for low-income families and other
measures to cushion the bumpy economic ride ahead, in which
economists have predicted millions of unemployed.
   Announcement of the economic program has already prompted
Muscovites to stock up.
   At Food Shop Number One on Gorky Street, a shop assistant, who
asked not to be identified, said panic-stricken buyers ``are
literally clearing full shelves for hoarding.''
   At another food shop near the center, an unusually long line of
25 to 30 people were packed into the grocery department. ``This is
the first time I saw people lining up like this for some cheap
cereals,'' a regular customer said.
   At the Novoarbatsky supermarket, however, manager Valentina
Aramasova said the situation was normal, the same as the days
before the economic program was announced.

<HEAD>De Klerk Says He'll Consider Lifting State of Emergency</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEPHEN R. WILSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President F.W. de Klerk of South Africa said Friday
his government will consider lifting the nationwide state of
emergency that has been in force for four years.
   Winding up his nine-nation European tour, de Klerk also said he
senses that there is an emerging consensus that economic sanctions
imposed on South Africa because of its apartheid policy should be
lifted.
   ``My impression is that it is becoming more and more clear to
everybody concerned that sanctions are becoming irrelevant,'' he
told reporters after meetings with Italian government and business
leaders.
   De Klerk left for South Africa on Friday evening.
   The state of emergency in South Africa was imposed June 12,
1986, by de Klerk's predecessor, P.W. Botha, to quell political and
racial violence.
   The decree gives police wide powers to detain people without
charge, ban political rallies, restrict the movement of journalists
and prohibit ``any act'' deemed a threat to public order.
   The proclamation comes up for reconsideration in June, as it
does each year.
   ``We will consider all alternatives'' at that time, de Klerk
said. ``We sincerely believe that the state of emergency must go as
soon as possible. ... There are various alternatives at which we
will look. I don't want to raise any expectations apart from saying
we will be looking at this fundamentally.''
   ``We can only afford to lift it should the level of violence go
down,'' de Klerk said. ``In some areas it is extremely high.''
   Fighting between rival black factions has wracked many urban
areas in recent months.
   De Klerk said his European tour had confirmed international
support for his reform policies. He visited France, Greece,
Portugal, Belgium, Britain, West Germany, Switzerland, Spain and
Italy.
   Since assuming power in August, he has released black leader
Nelson Mandela after 27 years in prison, legalized black opposition
groups and pledged to share power with the black majority. South
Africa's white minority now controls the government, and de Klerk
has stopped short of supporting black majority rule.
   De Klerk visited European nations last year as leader of the
National Party, and he said Friday that there was much less
skepticism now over whether South Africa was committed to change.
   ``They wanted to believe us but they wanted to see,'' he said.
``Now I found credibility. South Africa is being believed.''
   He described the international sanctions imposed on South Africa
as ``a dismal failure'' that contributed to unemployment and the
volatile atmosphere. In 1986, the European Community banned imports
of South African iron, steel and gold coins, and prohibited new
investments in the country.
   Italian Premier Giulio Andreotti and President Francesco Cossiga
expressed support for de Klerk's policies.
   ``The road taken is the right one,'' Andreotti said.
``Continuing on this path, de Klerk can count on the help of Italy
and Europe.''
   Giovanni Agnelli, chairman of Fiat, said Italian industrialists
will be interested in doing business in South Africa.

<BYLINE>Mired In Impasse, Rail Strike Widens, Cuts Off Baltic Coast
^By DRUSILLA MENAKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A wildcat rail strike spread to the port
city of Gdansk on Friday and cut off all rail traffic to Poland's
Baltic coast, and a government spokesman said workers and officials
were at an impasse.
   The strikes for higher pay and railroad reforms began Sunday and
represented a growing challenge to Poland's first post-Communist
government and its program to establish a market economy.
   The government ``cannot meet the pay proposals being put forward
and will not agree to discuss them in the conditions of a strike
paralyzing everything,'' Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki told a
crowd at a local election rally Friday in the southwestern city of
Wroclaw.
   Solidarity leader Lech Walesa said on nationwide radio that
``demagogical forces'' were trying to exploit workers' legitimate
grievances.
   The government has refused to negotiate with workers because the
strike was not organized through legal unions.
   The OPZZ union, the onetime Communist-backed labor federation,
endorsed the strike Thursday. The union is challenging Solidarity
for the support of workers, and Walesa accused its leadership of
manipulating the strikers in a ``game that will solve nothing but
may lead even to a civil war.''
   There were some signs of easing tensions late Friday. A hunger
strike by 42 rail workers, six of them hospitalized, was suspended.
Three rail stations in northern Poland reopened, officials said.
   But Transport Ministry spokesman Stefan Pozniak said the labor
dispute remained at ``a total impasse.''
   ``The entire coast is affected by the strike now, and there is
not a single port working normally. ... It's getting really
serious,'' Pozniak said.
   Freight stations in Gdansk joined the strike Friday. At the
nation's busiest port, in Szczecin, 12 ships awaited unloading.
Pozniak said freight headed to those ports from southern Poland,
Czechoslovakia and Hungary was blocked.
   Two dozen rail junctions in northwestern Poland were idled, and
the army was moving perishable and essential goods.
   Officials said thousands of the 400,000 railroad workers
nationwide were on strike but could give no specific number. ``It
takes only a few people to block traffic,'' Pozniak said.
   Walesa canceled a trip to Scandinavia and presided over a
meeting of Solidarity's National Commission on the dispute.
   ``I hope that reason will win,'' he said in an afternoon radio
interview. ``The strikers should be given a way of out it with
honor because they are right.''
   He also said the route of strikes ``leads nowhere,'' even though
``I am unhappy and almost the entire society is unhappy.''
   The railway workers are demanding that their basic monthly
salary be raised to $8 above the average monthly salary of $79.
   The government says granting the pay increases would unleash a
torrent of demands from other sectors of society and ruin its
economic reform program, begun Jan. 1.
   Mazowiecki, a top adviser to the Solidarity union before taking
charge of the East bloc's first non-Communist government, said the
strikes show ``society's fatigue and impatience.''
   They also are ``evidence a lack of understanding of the essence
of our economic changes,'' he said.
   In addition to strictly controlling wages, the government has
raised prices to market levels and ended government subsidies to
industry. As a result, Pole's real incomes have been reduced by an
estimated 40 percent.
   There have been signs of slackening public support for the
economic reforms, but a poll by the pro-Solidarity Gazeta Wyborcza
newspaper Friday showed overwhelming opposition to the rail strike.
   The survey found 61.9 percent opposed it, 16.6 percent supported
it and 21.5 percent had no opinion. No details on the poll methods
were given.

<HEAD>Soviet President Warms Up With Canada Before Hitting Washington</HEAD>

<DATELINE>OTTAWA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev will travel
to Canada Tuesday for talks with Prime Minister Brian Mulroney,
giving both men a brief respite from domestic troubles stirred up
in restive provinces.
   Gorbachev's 36-hour visit also will allow him to recover from
jet lag before heading to Washington for his summit with President
Bush.
   Officials here bristle at suggestions the short stopover is just
an afterthought to the U.S.-Soviet summit. But they acknowledge it
is unlikely Gorbachev would have come to Ottawa at this time
otherwise.
   That is particularly so because Mulroney was just in Moscow in
November, the first official visit by a Canadian prime minister
since Pierre Trudeau went in 1971. Mulroney and Gorbachev discussed
a wide range of issues and signed 14 agreements on issues ranging
from the environment to Arctic cooperation.
   ``We're pleased with the visit and don't like to think of it as
a mere rest stop en route to Washington,'' said a Canadian official
who spoke on condition of anonymity. ``We realize it is a difficult
time for him, especially with the trouble in the Baltic countries.''
   Emerging nationalism in the Soviet Union is one of the biggest
headaches facing Gorbachev, who has been locked in a war of nerves
with Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia over their moves toward
independence.
   In Canada, the desire of French-speaking Quebec for recognition
as a ``distinct society'' has led to the biggest political crisis
of Mulroney's career. The subject of Quebec independence once again
is the topic of the day.
   Quebec did not sign Canada's 1982 constitution. A proposed
amendment containing five major points sought by the Quebecois was
agreed to and signed by Mulroney and all 10 provincial premiers in
1987. But governments changed in three provinces and the new
premiers balked, creating the present crisis.
   Because they covered most of the bilateral issues in November,
Mulroney and Gorbachev are expected to focus on more global matters.
   The Canadians pride themselves on being the only country that
participates in NATO summits, G-7 economic summits, Commonwealth
summits and francophone summits, giving them a special role in
East-West matters.
   Gorbachev is concerned about German reunification. The question
of NATO membership for the new Germany certainly will be a point of
Soviet-Canadian divergence, the official said, adding that the
emergence of a new, stronger Germany ``raises concerns everywhere.''
   ``Both sides are also concerned about the new architecture of
Europe,'' he said. ``Everybody would like to see a stronger Eastern
Europe, economically and culturally.''
   Ottawa wants to learn Gorbachev's vision of a new Soviet Union
and a new Europe.
   ``Our view is that Mr. Gorbachev is the best man to have around
at this time,'' the official said.
   Canada is most eager to talk about the Conference on Security
and Cooperation in Europe, the mechanism created by the 35-nation
conference at Helsinki, Finland, in 1975. The Canadians believe the
CSCE is the best framework for Soviet participation in the new
Europe.
   ``We want to reaffirm in Soviet eyes that we are North American,
but still an important part of the European process,'' the official
said, stressing that ``Canada is not a superpower and doesn't
threaten anybody.''
   In Moscow on Friday, Gorbachev said the Soviet Union would
review its policies on European arms control and security
negotiations _ including CSCE _ if a reunited Germany joined NATO.
   Gorbachev arrives in Ottawa at midday Tuesday and goes for a
private lunch with Mulroney at his official residence. Later in the
afternoon he plans to meet Governor General Ray Hnatyshn.
   On Wednesday, there is a wreath-laying ceremony at the national
War Memorial followed by another meeting with Mulroney. A late
afternoon luncheon at the National Gallery of art will precede
Gorbachev's departure for Washington.

<TEXT>
   Poet Mark Strand, an English professor at the
University of Utah, was named Friday as the new poet laureate
consultant in poetry at the Library of Congress.
   Strand, who also is a short-story writer, editor, translator and
author of children's books, will start his one-year assignment in
September.
   He will receive $35,000 to give a poetry reading and a lecture
during the year, to work with students and to advise Librarian of
Congress James H. Billington on new library acquisitions.
   He will succeed poet Howard Nemerov, who served for two years.
   The position of consultant in poetry was created 54 years ago,
but Congress voted in 1985 to expand the title to designate its
holder as the equivalent of poet laureate of the United States.
   Since then, four poets have been named as poet laureate
consultant in poetry at the libary. Besides Strand and Nemerov,
they were the late Robert Penn Warren and Richard Wilbur.
   Strand has published seven collections of poetry. His eighth,
``The Continuous Life,'' is to be released in October. He also has
translated works by other poets, written three children's books and
two books on art, and has published three anthologies.
   A former Fulbright Scholar, Strand taught at 14 colleges and
universities, including Harvard, Yale and Princeton, before he
joined the University of Utah faculty in Salt Lake City in 1981.
Among his awards are the Edgar Allan Poe prize in 1974 and the
National Institute of Arts and Letters award in 1975.

<HEAD>Oil Slick Stretches Almost 60 Miles After Collision on Mississippi
River</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An oil slick stretched almost 60 miles
downstream from the French Quarter on Friday after a freighter
collided with some barges, dumping up to 60,000 gallons of fuel oil
into the Mississippi River, officials said.
   ``It's diesel fuel. I'm told it's not as heavy as the motor oil
you put in your car. It's somewhere between that and gasoline,''
said Senior Chief Petty Officer Joe Gibson of the U.S. Coast Guard.
   The spill occurred at 8:25 p.m. Thursday at Algiers Point in New
Orleans when the 800-foot Stonewall Jackson ran into empty barges,
the Coast Guard said. The ship and the barges belong to Waterman
Industries.
   The accident ripped three holes in the freighter, rupturing
several tanks of No. 6 fuel oil and allowing 50,000 to 60,000
gallons of the 300,000 gallons aboard the ship to spill.
   Workers on Friday were transferring the ship's remaining fuel to
other tanks and shifting cargo and ballast to keep the damage above
the water line, Gibson said.
   The collision was under investigation, Gibson said.
   The leading edge of the slick was at Port Sulfur, 58 miles
downriver from New Orleans by noon Friday, Gibson said.
   ``It's possible it could reach the Gulf,'' Gibson said of the
slick. ``As fast as the river is moving, it could get down there.
It depends on a lot of conditions and how much it pools up along
the banks of the river.''
   A number of communities including New Orleans draw their
drinking water from the Mississippi River. But the accident
happened below the New Orleans intakes and only threatened one
intake for the town of Pointe a La Hache, Gibson said.
   Rubark Co. of New Orleans was contracted by Waterman to clean up
the spill and the company planned to put booms at the Pointe a La
Hache water intake to prevent contamination, the Coast Guard said.
Rubark also planned to place booms at two other places in the
river, Gibson said.
   ``Our pollution response team is studying aerial video tapes of
the spill to determine how to clean it up. They'll look to see
where the concentration is the heaviest and clean it up there
first,'' Gibson said.

   Here are some comments concerning Friday's
hearing involving the explosion aboard the USS Iowa:
   In its report to Congress, the General Accounting Office said
the tests conducted from January to May 1990 at the Sandia National
Laboratory ``could not corroborate the Navy's technical finding
that an improvised chemical device initiated the explosion.''
   ``Furthermore, Sandia has identified a potential hazard _ the
impact sensitivity of the gunpowder in combination with an overram
at higher than normal speeds which could have caused the explosion.
Sandia believes further testing on this is needed to confirm its
finding.''
   
   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, on the Navy investigators: ``They
did the best job they could. Now there's new evidence, new
information that warrants reopening the investigation. ... But I
think at this point I'd want to keep my powder dry, so to speak,
until we have a better sense of exactly what this new information
may contribute.''
   
   The Navy issued a statement saying it ``will continue to test
additional theories dealing with the possible causes of the
explosion. ... Any further discussion on aspects of the additional
testing would be premature at this present time.''
   
   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee:
   ``At the outset of this hearing, I stated that I anticipated
that the testimony we would receive this morning would expose
significant shortcomings in the Navy's investigation and would cast
grave doubt on the conclusions the Navy drew as a result of their
investigation. I believe that the testimony we have heard has done
that and more. Moreover, this morning's testimony has identified a
very plausible, if not probable, explanation for the explosion.''
   
   Sen. John Warner, R-Va., ranking Republican on Senate Armed
Services Committee: ``It's far too early to jump to any
conclusion.''
   
   Kendall Truitt, Navy friend of Clayton Hartwig: ``I think we
should all be thankful that nobody else had to die before they
started looking at this. I knew from the beginning my friend didn't
do it.''
   
   Hartwig's sister, Kathy Kubicina, who attended the hearing: ``My
brother was only a victim. ... I hope after today this will get rid
of any doubt in anyone's mind.''
   
   Retired Capt. Fred Moosally, the USS Iowa's skipper at the time
of the explosion, from his front-row seat at Friday's hearing:
``I'm only here to listen.''

<HEAD>Ultra-Orthodox Rabbi Accuses Shamir of Eating Non-Kosher Food</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A powerful rabbi who two months ago helped
bring down the government of Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir is now
accusing Shamir of frequently eating non-kosher food.
   Rabbi Ovadia Yosef made similar accusations Thursday night about
former Defense Minister Ariel Sharon, saying the two politicians
routinely ate foods considered impure, such as pork and shellfish.
   The accusations came at a politically sensitive time. Shamir is
having trouble persuading ultra-Orthodox religious parties to join
a coalition Cabinet to be led by his right-wing Likud bloc.
   The allegations about Shamir and Sharon, both leading members of
the right-wing Likud bloc, were secretly recorded as the rabbi
addressed activists of his ultra-Orthodox Shas Party.
   Portions of the tape were broadcast on both Israel radio and
Armed Forces radio. Israel radio said it obtained the tape from an
unidentified person who made the recording without the rabbi's
knowledge.
   Shamir refused to respond to questions about the matter during
an interview with Israel radio, to be broadcast Saturday.
   Sharon aides could not be reached for comment.
   Yosef said of Shamir: ``He eats only impure fish. That's what he
likes.'' About Sharon he said: ``He doesn't eat shellfish, but he
really loves pork.''
   Yossef Azran, head of the Shas faction in Parliament, told army
radio that the remarks on the politicians' dining habits were taken
out of context.
   The rabbi's speech was about the special budget allocations made
to religious institutions. Shas rabbis and activists have
threatened to split from the party because they felt their
institutions weren't getting their fair share of the funds.
   In March, Shamir's coalition government with the left-leaning
Labor Party lost a crucial vote of confidence in Parliament after
Yosef ordered his six Shas lawmakers to abstain in the vote.

<TEXT>
   A fortuneteller and her daughter preyed
on troubled people's fears in a supernatural fraud scheme that
bilked victims out of $275,000, a judge said before levying stiff
prison terms.
   Gardenia Ephraim, 44, received a 20-year sentence Thursday and
her daughter Mary Ann, 23, was ordered to serve a 15-year term by
Judge David M. Barry.
   They were convicted April 17 of larceny, conspiracy and
racketeering.
   The women, members of a Gypsy community in West Hartford, were
found guilty of cheating victims who paid large sums for rituals to
rid homes of evil spirits. Their lawyer had argued unsuccessfully
that fortunetelling was a valid part of traditional Gypsy beliefs.
   ``You not only diminished these people and bankrupted some of
them economically, but also bankrupted them emotionally,'' Barry
said.
   They women used the proceeds to buy sports cars and expensive
watches, prosecutors said.
   One victim, Harris Sanders, said the sentences ``couldn't happen
to a nicer pair of ladies. Their remorse is nonexistent.'' Sanders
said he paid the women $80,000 in property and cash.
   Defense attorney William T. Gerace called the sentences ``severe
and cruel,'' and said he will appeal.
   He argued that the women were raised according to traditional
Gypsy beliefs, including faith in fortunetelling and spiritualistic
rituals.
   The younger Ms. Ephraim tearfully asked the judge for mercy.
   ``If you give me a chance, I will show you I can be an
upstanding citizen,'' she said. ``I will work two jobs to do
whatever needs to be done.''
   The two women, imprisoned for the past 16 months, were returned
to prison immediately after sentencing.

<HEAD>Jewish Graves and Ceausescu Burial Place Vandalized</HEAD>

   Vandals have desecrated about 70
graves in three cities, nearly half of them belonging to Jews,
officials said Friday. They also struck the presumed graves of
executed dictator Nicolae Ceausescu and his wife.
   The Ceausescus were secretly buried on opposite sides of a path
in a public cemetery under different names, shortly after the
December revolution that ended nearly half a century of communism.
They were executed Dec. 25.
   Ceausescu's presumed grave was topped by a common oak cross with
the inscription Col. Popa Dan, 1920-1989.
   Elena Ceausescu's assumed grave, which last week looked as
freshly dug as her husband's, had an identical wooden cross
carrying the name of Col. Enescu Vasile, 1921-1989.
   The authorities, fearing the couple's graves could be desecrated
by revengeful Romanians, never disclosed the actual burial site.
   But after a high-ranking official last Saturday confirmed rumors
the Ceausescus were buried at the Ghencea civilian cemetery in
Bucharest, the crosses vanished.
   The chief administrator of the cemetery, Virginia Cismarescu,
said at least 30 graves were desecrated in the past two days.
   ``It is a disaster. ... I do not know who can actually be
against crosses,'' she said.
   ``I think it is the police who want to take away the myth of
Ceausescu and leave the grave unmarked,'' said a grave digger who
refused to be identified.
   The state-run news agency Rompres, quoting the Jewish Community
office, reported that within the past two weeks, 28 Jewish graves
were vandalized in the Jewish cemetery in the Transylvanian town of
Tirgu Mures. Eight more were desecrated in the eastern city of
Galati at ``Eternity'' cemetery.
   The incidents may have been inspired by the desecration of a
Jewish cemetery in Carpentras, France, two weeks ago, said Bernard
Zauber, president of the Jewish Community in Tirgu Mures.
   ``This was done on purpose, because people who survived the
horrors of Auschwitz were buried there,'' Zauber told The
Associated Press.
   The Jewish Community numbers only 300 people, aged 63 or older,
in Tirgu Mures.
   Of the 28 graves vandalized there, five were destroyed, Zauber
said.
   The desecrations outraged the dwindling Jewish community of
Romania, where latent anti-Semitism continues. There are some
20,000 Jews left in Romania and many have applied to emigrate to
Israel.

   Raisa Gorbachev will visit the Library of
Congress next Thursday during the superpower summit to formally
open an exhibit of historic Russian manuscripts, the library said
Friday.
   A reception in the ornate Southwest Hall will be hosted by
Armand Hammer, the Occidental Petroleum Corp. chairman and longtime
Soviet business partner, who is underwriting the exhibit of 25
books and manuscripts from the Soviet Union.
   Some of the materials have never been exhibited in the Soviet
Union and none has been seen outside that country, the library said.
   Among the 200 others expected to attend the reception are Vice
President Dan Quayle's wife, Marilyn; Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I.
First lady Barbara Bush may also attend.
   Mrs. Gorbachev will be shown some American artifacts, including
letters written by George Washington, and will get a demonstration
of the library's computer data collection system and a look at the
library's main reading room.
   The Library of Congress was established in 1800 and is the
world's largest library. It has the largest Slavic manuscript
collection outside the Soviet Union.

<HEAD>Soviets Say Housing Shortage Blocking Troop Pullout from East
Germany</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Gorbachev-Germany, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEVIN COSTELLOE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>EAST BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Soviet Union said Friday that a massive
housing shortage back home has forced it to suspend indefinitely
the withdrawal of nearly one-tenth of its troops from East Germany.
   In December 1988, Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev promised
the unilateral withdrawal of one-tenth of the Red Army soldiers in
East Germany. Officials in Bonn say it was to include about 36,000
troops.
   West German authorities say the Soviets have pulled out about
12,000 military personnel. Soviet officials say the number is
higher.
   The suspension comes as Moscow apparently is balking at signing
an overall troop reduction agreement for central Europe.
   In recent days, the Soviets have been hesitating about signing a
treaty that would reduce Soviet forces and U.S. forces to 195,000
for each side in central Europe. That area includes East Germany.
   Soviet diplomats, at a news conference in East Berlin on Friday,
insisted that housing rather than politics was behind the
suspension.
   Mikhail Logvinov, a counselor with the Soviet Embasssy, said
``the housing shortage is a problem that will take years to solve.''
   Western experts have said that some of the troops being pulled
out of Eastern Europe have been kept in tents back home while they
wait for permanent homes.
   ``The army barracks are still filled with refugees from the
earthquake area of Armenia and Azerbaijan, where there has been
unrest,'' Logvinov said.
   ``The army has been put into action building apartments for
these people,'' he said. ``Now, sufficient numbers of apartments
must be built for the officers, junior officers and their families
returning from abroad.''
   He estimated that number at 100,000. The Soviet Union also has
agreed to pull tens of thousands of troops from Hungary and
Czechoslovakia.
   The superpowers are involved in negotiations on reducing their
nuclear and conventional forces in Europe and hope to reach some
agreements during the summit between President Bush and Mikhail S.
Gorbachev that begins May 31.
   Gorbachev said in Moscow on Friday that the Soviet Union would
review its policies on European arms control and security
negotiations if a united Germany joined NATO.
   The Soviet Union wants Germany to belong to NATO and the Warsaw
Pact. The Bush administration favors NATO membership only.
   Gorbachev justified the policy review by saying NATO would take
similar action if the Soviet Union insisted on Warsaw Pact
membership for a united Germany.

<HEAD>Shamir Aide Denounces Arafat Speech to Security Council</HEAD>

   A top aide to Prime Minster Yitzhak Shamir said
Friday that PLO leader Yasser Arafat's speech to the U.N. Security
Council was ``full of lies and distortions.''
   In his speech, Arafat accused Israel of waging a ``war of
extermination'' against Palestinians and urged the United Nations
to set up an international force to protect Palestinians in the
Israeli-occupied territories.
   ``Here again, Arafat has used the United Nations as a platform
for a vicious attack on Israel, making accusations that are full of
lies and distortion,'' Shamir aide Avi Pazner told The Associated
Press.
   He said Arafat raised ``proposals which he knows have no chance
whatsoever to be accepted by Israel.''
   Danny Naveh, a top aide to Foreign Minister Moshe Arens, charged
that Arafat was ``personally responsible for the murder of many
innocent victims'' and that ``the PLO is still engaged in
terrorism.''
   Israel refuses contact with the PLO, arguing that it is a terror
organization. The Jewish state also has rejected Arafat's December
1988 declaration in which he renounced terrorism.
   Earlier Friday, Shamir said he opposed any U.N. observer force
in Israeli-controlled territory.
   In Arab east Jerusalem, Arafat's speech was broadcast over
loudspeakers set up in a tent at the Red Cross, where dozens of
Palestinian activists have been on a hunger strike since Sunday to
press for a U.N. observer force.
   When the speech ended, applause erupted among the scores of
listeners who jumped up from mattresses in the tent and began
chanting ``Long live Abu Ammar!'' Abu Ammar is Arafat's nom de
guerre.
   Faisal Husseini, the most prominent PLO supporter in the
occupied lands and a potential peace negotiator with Israel, said
Arafat was ``not only fighting for the liberation of his own
people, but for peace in the whole area.''
   Husseini also said the demands by Arafat, especially the call
for an observer force, originated among activists in the occupied
lands who daily confront Israeli troops.
   Representatives of the four main PLO factions, including those
usually critical of Arafat, were also in the tent.
   ``We are united against our common enemy and we are united
behind the demands of Arafat,'' said Riyad Malki, a West Bank
university lecturer whose views have been identified with those of
the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. The PFLP is a
radical Marxist faction backed by Syria.
   Israeli media played down the Arafat speech.
   The first item on Israel radio's hourly newscast after the
speech was the drowning death of a 4-year-old girl. In its report
on the speech, the radio carried a brief summary, but not Arafat's
voice. Israel telvision continued with its scheduled program, a
U.S.-made adventure film.
   The PLO demand for U.N. observers gained momentum after an
outbreak of violence in the occupied lands to protest the slaying
of seven Palestinian laborers by an Israeli gunman on Sunday.
Israeli officials say the gunman was deranged.
   At least 15 Arabs were killed, most by gunfire from Israeli
troops, and more than 800 hurt in subsequent clashes.
   Since the start of the Palestinian uprising more than 29 months
ago, 710 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli soldiers or
civilians and 43 Israelis have been slain by Palestinians. At least
216 other Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs, most as
suspected collaborators with Israel.
   An Israeli army spokesman said four Palestinian laborers armed
with knives stabbed a Jewish settler in the chest Friday while
working in his orchard in the occupied West Bank. The victim was in
fair condition.
   The army spokesman said the motive for the stabbing apparently
was Palestinian nationalism.
   The attack came as the army continued to enforce widespread
curfews in the occupied territories, confining more than a million
Palestinians to their homes to prevent further violence.
   During this week's upsurge in violence, the army placed most of
the occupied lands under curfew. Journalists were only allowed to
enter with a military escort and could not roam freely.

<HEAD>Mandela Bodyguard Convicted of Murder</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURINDA KEYS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A judge on Friday convicted
Winnie Mandela's former chief bodyguard of murdering a black
teen-ager after beating him at Mrs. Mandela's home while she was
present.
   Jerry Richardson, 41, was found guilty of murdering 14-year-old
black activist James Stompie Seipei Moeketsi on Jan. 1, 1989.
   He was also convicted of assaulting and kidnapping the teen-ager
and three black men, who testified that Mrs. Mandela had beaten all
of them with a whip and her fists on Dec. 29, 1988, and then
allowed her bodyguards to continue the assaults. Mrs. Mandela is
the wife of black leader Nelson Mandela.
   Richardson was also convicted of attempted murder in a case
unrelated to Stompie's death. Supreme Court Justice Brian O'Donovan
delayed sentencing Richardson until he receives a psychiatric
report on Aug. 6.
   O'Donovan, commenting on the evidence, said whips with traces of
human blood were found in the house, and blood matching one of the
surviving victims was found on walls and curtains of a room in Mrs.
Mandela's Soweto township home.
   Stompie's decomposed body, with three stab wounds in the neck,
was found in a Soweto field on Jan. 6, 1989. It was not identified
until after community leaders got the surviving victims out of the
house and the case became public.
   O'Donovan ruled that most of the assaults occurred on Dec. 29,
1989. He added, ``I find that Mrs. Mandela was present on the 29th
... for at least part of the time.'' He said nothing else of her
involvement.
   Mrs. Mandela has made no public statement on the case since last
year, when she denied committing any crime or being home when any
assaults took place.
   The court also heard evidence that Nelson Mandela had sent his
attorney to Mrs. Mandela's home to try to get the three men
released but had failed.
   Mandela was freed Feb. 11 after serving 27 years of a life term
for sabotage and plotting the overthrow of the white minority
government. He is now deputy president of the African National
Congress, the leading group fighting South Africa's apartheid
system of racial separation.
   Last year, leading black anti-apartheid activists accused Mrs.
Mandela of complicity in the abductions and assaults, and they
urged Soweto to shun her. A few months later, however, she
reappeared on stage at anti-government rallies and has accompanied
her husband in public since his release.
   Mandela accused the government Wednesday of deliberately
defaming his wife by not charging her in a case that centers on
her. However, Mandela said he was not saying the government should
prosecute her.
   Eight former associates of Mrs. Mandela, including her driver
and other bodyguards, are scheduled to face trial beginning next
week on charges of abduction and assault with intent to do serious
bodily harm in connection with the same case.
   If no extenuating circumstances are found for Richardson's
actions, the death penalty is mandatory. However, President F.W. de
Klerk suspended all death sentences in February as part of his
program to encourage negotiations between the government and black
groups. He is trying to bring blacks into the nation's political
system.
   Though denying involvement, Mrs. Mandela has said the abductions
were justified, claiming Stompie was staying at a church-run house
where a Methodist priest was engaging in homosexual activity.
   However, O'Donovan said there was no evidence of homosexuality
at the church-run house. He said Richardson had given no
explanation for the assaults on Stompie.
   The witnesses testified Mrs. Mandela had accused the teen-ager
of having been a police spy when he led an organization of youth
activists in the Orange Free State.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Lashes Out at Lithuanian Leaders</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANDREW KATELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Friday branded
the leaders of secessionist Lithuania ``adventurists'' and repeated
his demand that they back down from their March 11 declaration of
independence.
   ``We have great reserves of will power, but we are looking for
ways'' to end the impasse, Gorbachev said at a news conference
after meeting with visiting French President Francois Mitterrand.
   As a result of an economic embargo by the Kremlin, Lithuanian
factories have been forced to close, throwing an estimated 19,000
people out of work. Lithuanian officials said hot water supplies
throughout the Baltic republic were shut off Friday because
regional distribution stations had run out of oil.
   Gorbachev repeated an appeal for the Lithuanians to follow a new
Soviet law that requires a referendum for any of the 15 republics
to secede. Lithuanian leaders say the law does not apply to them,
as it was passed after they declared the republic independent.
   ``Let's return to March 10 and start the constitutional
process,'' Gorbachev said at the news conference, broadcast live on
Soviet television.
   Half-joking, the Soviet leader said the Lithuanians had decided
``not to make a gift to President Gorbachev on the eve of his visit
to the United States.'' Gorbachev meets with President Bush next
week in Washington.
   Gorbachev defended the use of army troops to occupy Communist
Party buildings in Lithuania in March. He also defended the
economic sanctions he has brought against the republic, which
include shutting off oil and natural gas shipments.
   ``What happened in Lithuania was that a group of adventurists is
speculating on such issues as independence,'' he said.
   ``I can say that in a similar situation, the American president
would put the situation under control in 24 hours,'' he added.
   Gorbachev also has decreed that the other two Baltic states,
Latvia and Estonia, violated Soviet law by making gradual moves
toward independence without Moscow's approval. But Gorbachev has
imposed economic sanctions only against Lithuania.
   He told Lithuanian legislators on Thursday that if the republic
agreed to suspend its declaration of independence and follow
Moscow's procedures for secession, Lithuania could gain
independence in as little as two years, said one of the
legislators, Vaidotas Antanaitis.
   Meanwhile, in the Latvian capital of Riga, legislative leaders
rejected Gorbachev's recent order voiding their declaration of
independence, a spokesman said.
   The presidium, or executive council, of Latvia's Supreme Council
sent a telegram to Gorbachev saying he exceeded his authority May
14, when he issued a decree that Latvia's declaration was illegal,
said legislative spokesman Ivars Embrekts.
   ``The constitution of the U.S.S.R. does not give the president
of the U.S.S.R. the right to repeal laws or decisions which have
been taken by the Supreme Council of the Republic of Latvia,'' the
telegram said. ``The decree does not have the force of law in the
republic.''
   The three Baltic republics, forcibly annexed in 1940, are taking
varied approaches toward secession. While Lithuania has proclaimed
immediate independence, Estonia and Latvia are following a more
cautious path by declaring a transition period.
   In the Estonian capital of Tallinn, centrist and radical
deputies clashed Friday over what role the new Estonian Congress,
elected by ethnic Estonians, should have in relation to the
republic's traditional Supreme Soviet.
   The chairman of the new congress, Tunne Kelam, opened its
session with a complaint that it was being ignored by the
republic's Supreme Soviet legislature and given only an observer's
role during the transition to independence, the Estonian news
agency ETA reported.
   The Congress, with 499 representatives, has no formal political
power, but considers itself the highest representative of ethnic
Estonians living in the republic and abroad.
   ``We are not being allowed into the family room, where everyone
else is,'' Kelam was quoted as saying. ``We are not an illegitimate
son. We have the right to join our half-sister.''
   Prime Minister Edgar Savisaar responded that giving the Congress
the right to legislative power alongside the elected Supreme Soviet
would result in a dual power structure.
   ``This can only work against us,'' Savisaar said.
   He also said Estonia should learn from Lithuania's experience.
   ``The events in Lithuania have sobered us up to the fact that
the West is not about to help us to any great degree,'' the
Estonian leader told the Congress.
   Despite a recent tour of Western capitals by Lithuanian Prime
Minister Kazimiera Prunskiene, Lithuania has not been granted
diplomatic recognition by the United States or European powers.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A group of art supporters urged Congress on
Friday to reauthorize the embattled National Endowment for the Arts
without any provisions restricting federal support for works some
may consider obscene.
   The panel, representing major organizations supporting the arts,
issued a statement that also recommended no change in the method of
distributing money to state arts councils for use in subsidizing
artists.
   The panel was gathered by a key congressional supporter of the
NEA, Rep. Pat Williams, D-Mont., in an effort to head off
increasing criticism of the endowment in light of controversial
grants for art many considered to be offensive.
   The arts groups said the NEA would not support obscene art. But
at the same time it said the NEA should consider only artistic
merit, and that obscenity was a matter to be left to the courts.
   ``The endowment can and should only determine artistic
excellence. In our system of government only the courts can and
should determine constitutional issues of obscenity,'' the art
leaders said in their statement. ``Obscenity is without artistic
merit, is unprotected by the First Amendment of the Constitution,
and we do not support it.''
   Williams, chairman of a House subcommittee considering
legislation to continue the endowment, said he would support the
proposals in hearings early next month.
   Williams invited the arts leaders to come up with suggestions,
and the group met privately for four days.
   Williams told the group he believed it would be difficult to win
congressional approval of a reauthorization that had no limits on
the NEA's ability to fund obscene works.
   The Bush administration has backed legislation to renew the NEA
in its present form for five years. An alternative proposal offered
by Reps. Thomas Coleman, R-Mo., and Steve Gunderson, R-Wis., would
distribute a majority of federal arts money directly to state arts
agencies.
   The group's statement called for other changes in the NEA that
include creating a new program of arts education and accessibility,
to be paid for with a new appropriation of up to $40 million, and
require policy meetings of the NEA's council on the arts be open to
the public.
   Joining in the statement were 16 arts groups, including the
American Council for the Arts, the National Assembly of State Arts
Agencies and four independent citizens and artists.
   Recent debate over the NEA was triggered by several
controversial artistic exhibits, including photographs by the late
Robert Mapplethorpe of homosexual acts and nude children. The NEA
had given $30,000 to a Philadelphia museum to show Mapplethorpe's
work.
   Since then, an exhibit of his work by the Corcoran Gallery of
Art in Washington was canceled, and a Cincinnati museum and its
director were indicted on obscenity charges for displaying
Mapplethorpe's pictures.
   A group of 61 House members wrote Bush urging him to support
restrictions against federal funding of obscene, indecent or
sacrilegious works.

   Militants fired on soldiers in the disputed
territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, killing one and injuring four
others, Tass said Friday.
   The attackers first fired at a checkpoint in the
Nagorno-Karabakh center of Stepanakert, gravely wounding private A.
Gataulin, the official news agency said. An hour later that same
day, Thursday, another checkpoint was attacked, but there were no
casualties, Tass said.
   In a third incident, gunmen shot at a military patrol near a bus
terminal, killing private V. Kirrilov and seriously injuring two
other soldiers and a lieutenant, the report said. In an ensuing
shootout, one of the gunmen, G. Khachaturyan, was killed and six
others wounded.
   The report did not specify whether the attackers were Armenians
or Azerbaijani but the name of the fatality was Armenian. It also
did not say whether the same gunmen were involved in all the
incidents.
   The predominantly Armenian enclave of Nagorno-Kharabakh has been
at the center of a territorial dispute between Armenia and
Azerbaijan for 2{ years.
   Four civilians were reported killed earlier this month in armed
clashes in the border regions between Azerbaijan and Armenia. Among
the victims were a 9-year-old boy and an elderly woman.

<TEXT>
   Franz Schoenhuber, the ex-Nazi Waffen
SS soldier whose ultrarightist Republicans became the shooting star
of West German politics, quit as party leader Friday, complaining
extremists had taken over.
   Mainstream politicians in Bonn said his decision marks the
near-certain demise of one of Europe's most controversial political
parties, which went from a mushrooming political force to a fringe
group in disarray.
   Otto Lambsdorff, head of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's junior
coalition partners, the Free Democrats, said Friday, ``The remains
... of this party will soon scatter themselves into the wind.''
   The Republicans' main office in Munich said Schoenhuber's former
deputy, Johanna Grund, 56, would replace him until a new
chairperson is elected.
   Schoenhuber, 66, said ``small clique of extremist
functionaries'' existed at top party levels and he was quitting
because he felt unable to oppose them.
   His resignation further splintered a party already reeling from
ideological bickering and from major election setbacks that
reversed the party's meteroic rise.
   Schoenhuber led the Republicans to head-spinning fame last year,
championing xenophobic and right-wing platforms to appeal to West
Germans tired of competing with foreigners for scarce jobs and
housing.
   Beginning with West Berlin in January 1989, the Republicans
scored large gains in state and local elections and also won 7.2
percent in last June's elections for the European Parliament,
landing Schoenhuber a seat there.
   But the wind went out of Schoenhuber's sails after the East
German revolution last fall and the sudden realization that German
reunification was no longer just a dream.
   With every mainstream party embracing unification, the
Republicans lost much of their nationalist appeal.
   The party says its membership climbed from 18,000 to 26,000 the
past year.
   Whatever their actual membership, it's clear their voter support
has taken a beating.
   In recent state elections, the Republicans mustered less than 2
percent of the vote. They slipped badly in national polls _ far
below the 5 percent needed to gain seats in the federal parliament
in scheduled Dec. 2 elections.
   Schoenhuber told reporters in Munich he would try to create a
new leadership to challenge his successor, but Republican officials
said efforts were already under way among the leadership to oust
Schoenhuber from the party.
   In recent days, Schoenhuber repeatedly cautioned that the party
was heading too far right and was becoming an extremist right-wing
group. His charges drew fire from other party leaders.
   Schoenhuber said Friday he could not take further responsibility
for the party following clashes between police and party members
during recent rallies for Oct. 14 Bavarian state parliamentary
elections. He said he himself was withdrawing as a candidate for
parliament in those elections.
   One Republican candidate, Franz Glasauer, was recently fined
5,000 marks ($2,975) for telling a rally a ``work camp'' should be
created for ``riffraff and scum.'' He was charged under a law
banning ``incitement of the public.''
   Far-right political parties in West Germany have a history of
fizzling out, unable to sustain strong membership in a nation where
the Nazi past makes the electorate especially sensitive.

   A man who lost his college scholarship and his job
when he was convicted of assaulting a police officer during an
anti-war demonstration has cleared his name with a 20-year-old
photograph.
   The photo, taken by a newspaper photographer but not published
until this week, shows Malcolm Emory with an armload of books at
about the time police said that he had thrown a rock. He had said
he had just left the library.
   Emory, now 39, maintained he was wrongly convicted of the
assault, which allegedly occurred during a protest at Northeastern
University in 1970. He never served time for the offense, but the
conviction cost him his college scholarship, his job doing research
for the Navy and a promising future as a physicist.
   But this year, using a newspaper photograph taken at the
protest, Emory got his conviction set aside and won a new trial. On
Wednesday, the Suffolk County district attorney's office said it
would drop the case rather than retry it. And on Thursday,
Northeastern University awarded Emory, who has spent most of the
last 20 years as a welder, a full scholarship to complete the
physics studies he began there in 1969.
   ``It's a great relief. I'm very happy to have this solved,''
Emory said.
   A police officer, Vincent Logan, maintained that Emory threw a
rock at police during the anti-war protest of Jan. 29, 1970. Emory
said was attacked by the officer after he left the library and
decided to take a look at the protest.
   Emory was arrested on a charge of assault and battery on a
police officer. He was convicted on the testimony of Logan. He was
given a six-month suspended sentence and put on probation for three
years.
   He also lost his college scholarship and his Navy security
clearance; he had been working his way through college as a
government researcher.
   ``For the first few years, I was very angry about what had
happened,'' Emory said. ``I really expected some sort of apology
from Logan. But after four or five years and nothing was
forthcoming, I realized I had to get on with my life.''
   So after his probation ended, Emory became a welder and worked
in machine shops and shipyards.
   While at the library five years ago, Emory found in the Boston
Globe a front-page photograph that showed him surrounded by police
in the midst of the 1970 demonstration. His books could not be seen
in the photograph, but he hoped there might be others that would
support his claim.
   He found that the Globe will release photographs only only if
there is a subpoena.
   ``It was a legal catch-22,'' said his lawyer, John Legasey.
``You can only get a subpoena if there is a motion for a new trial.
You can only move for a new trial if you have new evidence. And we
only had new evidence if there was (another) photo. We needed a
subpoena to find out.''
   Last year, the Globe relented, and Emory found one picture of
him holding his books as he was being dragged away by police.
   Superior Court Judge Sandra Hamlin ruled this year that the
photograph provided sufficient grounds for a new trial.
   Logan, the arresting officer, continues to dispute Emory's
story, saying he was careful to keep his eye on the person who
threw the rock, which injured another officer standing near him.
   ``All I saw was blood splatter, and I keep my eye on the guy who
throws the rock,'' he said.
   He said the photograph of Emory holding books was taken after
his arrest, but he doesn't know where the books came from.
   Although he can never regain the life he lost, Emory says he
hopes to finally finish his physics degree. He enrolled at
Northeastern again last fall, and now with his full scholarship he
hopes to complete his bachelor's degree next year.
   ``If this hadn't happened, I would have continued on in the same
direction _ I would have been a physicist,'' Emory said.
   ``When I when to the library, that night, I expected to come
back,'' he added. ``I'd never been involved in students protests, I
wasn't politically active. I just wanted to study and come back.
But I came back completely different.''

<TEXT>
   West German Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich
Genscher and Secretary of State James Baker said Friday they had
signs Soviet leaders were willing to make progress in talks to cut
conventional forces in Europe.
   Genscher said Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze told
him earlier this week the Soviets are ``keen on concluding these
negotiations soon.''
   Baker called the meeting between Genscher and Shevardnadze
significant.
   ``Now, time will tell,'' said Baker, who met last week with
Shevardnadze and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   However, Gorbachev warned Friday that the Soviet Union would
review its policies on European arms control and security
negotiations if a reunited Germany joined NATO.
   Gorbachev's remarks contained the Kremlin's most dire warning
about what steps it would take if a reunited Germany joins the
Western military alliance.
   Baker, who made his comments before Gorbachev spoke in Moscow,
said he didn't want to predict that U.S. and Soviet negotiators
would make progress toward an arms cut as early as next week, when
Gorbachev meets with President Bush in Washington.
   ``We have not seen a lot of progress over the course of the past
few weeks, as you know. And we took note of that fact when I was in
Moscow last week,'' Baker said. ``We need to see some concrete
action, but I'm hopeful that we will begin to see that.''
   Baker and Genscher said their discussions, coming barely eight
days after the foreign minister was last in Washington with
Chancellor Helmut Kohl for talks with Bush, also included plans for
German unification and a summit conference of NATO leaders.
   ``We find ourselves in practically total agreement on all of
these issues,'' Baker said. ``It's a rather amazing of degree of
convergence of views, and represents the fact that we have spent
quite a bit of time in very close consultation and cooperation in
this period of rapid change in Europe.''

   Russian lawmakers cast ballots Friday night in a
vote to determine whether populist Boris N. Yeltsin would become
president of the Soviet Union's largest republic.
   Yeltsin, a onetime Gorbachev ally ousted two years ago as Moscow
Communist Party chief after calling for faster reform, gained a
double boost Friday. Russian deputies and Soviet media praised a
key campaign speech he made, and the candidate backed by President
Mikhail S. Gorbachev withdrew.
   But Yeltsin, 59, needs backing from 531 of the 1,059 members of
the Russian Congress, more than he himself has estimated he could
count on. Official results from voting late Friday are expected by
Saturday morning.
   The candidate backed by Gorbachev, Russian premier Alexander
Vlasov, withdrew from the race after it became clear he lacked
Yeltsin's popularity.
   Vlasov's departure left Ivan Polozkov, a Communist Party chief
from the southern Russia city of Krasnodar, as Yeltsin's main
rival. The third remaining candidate, aviation instructor Vladimir
Morokin, did not appear to have any chance of winning.
   Russia, by far the largest of the Soviet Union's 15 republics,
comprises more than two-thirds of the country's territory. It is
home to half the Soviet populace.
   A Yeltsin victory would mean an important setback for Gorbachev,
who has clashed repeatedly with his former protege. Gorbachev spoke
out Wednesday against Yeltsin's plan for increased Russian
autonomy, claiming it would mean ``the breakup of the Soviet
Union.''
   Yeltsin, however, pledged Friday that if elected, he would
defend the republic from Moscow interference while not letting
personal conflicts interfere with his Kremlin dealings.
   ``I am for business-like relations, dialogue and negotiations
with the president and the government, but on the principle that
Russia's sovereignty is not damaged,'' Yeltsin told the Russian
Congress. The Russians use the term ``sovereignty'' to mean
increased autonomy _ not secession.
   With his bass voice booming through the hall of the Great
Kremlin Palace, Yeltsin pressed a point-by-point program on
promoting for Russian sovereignty, unleashing market forces,
increasing housing and flooding stores with consumer goods.
   ``Vremya,'' the nightly news program on state-run Soviet
television, gave Yeltsin high marks for his platform. ``Having
heard all the contenders, I can say his program for the rebirth of
Russia came off the best-argued and thought-through,'' the Vremya
report said.
   ``The people believe in Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin,'' deputy
Nina Sivova told the Congress. ``His great force of will is needed
today.''
   In an early indication of Yeltsin's plans if he wins, his speech
blasted the government program announced Thursday for a transition
to a free market economy. He said it had ``already created panic in
the stores today.''
   Instead, he backed an alternative program involving sale of
government property, full independence for enterprises, more
liberal laws on ownership and foreign loans.
   Yeltsin is already a member of the national Congress of People's
Deputies and a member of the Communist Party Central Committee.
   He has made a remarkable political comeback from disgrace two
years ago, when he was ousted from his post as Moscow party chief
and ostracized by the Kremlin elite, including Gorbachev. Yeltsin
has continued to level public blasts of criticism at Gorbachev for
his ``halfway reforms.''
   If no one wins more than 50 percent of the vote in the first
round, the election goes into a runoff between the top two
vote-getters.

<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The death of a ``Doonesbury'' character
who suffered from AIDS didn't prompt any angry phone calls, the
strip's syndicator said Friday.
   Universal Press Syndicate has received complaints about
``Doonesbury'' in the past and once did not distribute strips that
dealt with abortion. The strip was created by Garry Trudeau.
   ``It wasn't a big shock at all,'' said Lee Salem, editorial
director for Universal Press. ``I think Garry is always known for
dealing with major issues of social concern, and I think the way
our society copes with AIDS is certainly within that.''
   The character Andy Lippincott, who has appeared in the strip
since 1976, died in the panels that appeared in Thursday's
newspapers. The character, who was gay, began as a law school
student and evolved into an attorney and a political aide to
another character.
   ``It's not the first time in Doonesbury that a character died,''
Salem said. ``Dick Davenport, another character, died a few years
ago of a heart attack.''
   But Andy's death was apparently the first time AIDS killed a
comic strip figure. Andy was diagnosed with AIDS in the strip in
early 1989.

   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat urged the U.N.
Security Council on Friday to send an emergency force to protect
Arabs in the Israeli-occupied territories from a ``war of
extermination.''
   Opening an emergency council session, Arafat called for an end
to Israel's 23-year-old occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip,
a ban on Jewish settlements in the territories, and international
sanctions against Israel.
   The violence ``has reached an extremely dangerous and explosive
point,'' the Palestine Liberation Organization chief said.
   ``The situation now requires urgent action in order to enforce
reverence for international legitimacy,'' he said. ``Over 30
months, the Israeli occupation forces have been waging a war of
extermination on all fronts.''
   Arafat said the Palestinian uprising, which began in December
1987, would continue until Israel is ousted from the occupied areas
_ home to 1.7 million Palestinians.
   He urged appointment of a permanent U.N. envoy to monitor the
situation, a Security Council investigation into ``all crimes''
allegedly committed by Israel against Palestinians, and immediate
preparations for an international Middle East peace conference.
   Initial responses from other delegates were largely
non-committal. France and the Soviet Union said the council should
consider a U.N. observer force.
   In Israel, a top aide to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said
Arafat's speech was ``full of lies and distortions.''
   Secretary of State James A. Baker III reiterated in Washington
the United States' opposition tostationing a U.N. observer force in
the territories but said the ``idea of the secretary-general
sending one of his top aides to take a look at the situation and
return is something quite different.''
   Baker also said he believed some people misinterpreted a
statement he made Wednesday, when he said the Bush administration
was willing to discuss sending observers into the West Bank and
Gaza Strip. The comment had touched off speculation the United
States would support permanent observers.
   Asked to appraise Arafat's speech, Baker said he had not read it.
   Arab delegations called the emergency meeting of the 15-nation
Security Council to consider ways to quell a surge of Arab-Israeli
clashes in the territories and Israel.
   The violence followed the killing of seven unarmed Arab workers
by an Israeli on Sunday.
   Arafat challenged Israel's claim that Sunday's killings were the
act of an isolated madman, saying ``the primary responsibility
falls on the insanity and derangement of the whole system.''
   Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Benyamin Netanyahu rejected
sending observers, which he called a bid to end Israel's role ``as
the responsible governing power in the territories.''
   ``What we are now facing is a further attempt to delegitimize
Israel and Jewish immigration to it,'' he told the council.
   The council's session was shifted from New York to Geneva to
allow Arafat to speak. Arab delegations wanted to avoid a showdown
with the United States, which has barred the PLO chief from entry
in the past.
   It was the second time in 18 months a U.N. session was moved to
Geneva from the world body's New York headquarters so Arafat could
address it.
   In December 1988, Arafat addressed the U.N. General Assembly to
renounce terrorism and acknowledge Israel's right to exist _
meeting two U.S. demands that led to the opening of a dialogue
between the PLO and the United States.
   After a six-hour debate, the council session was adjourned until
Saturday with no decisions made.
   The session is likely to resume Tuesday in New York, U.N.
spokesman Francois Giuliani said.
   For his first speech to the Security Council, Arafat wore his
traditional kaffiyeh Arab headdress and military uniform.
   French ambassador Pierre-Louis Blanc said the council should
consider sending a U.N. fact-finding mission to the occupied
territories.
   He urged Israel to accept such a mission, which could come up
with concrete proposals on the ``establishment of U.N. observers''
in the area.
   Soviet Ambassador Yuli Vorontsov also backed sending
international observers, who would later become a permanent body in
the occupied territories.
   Britain said it was ready ``to look at proposals for further
U.N. involvement to ease the tense situation'' and appealed for
restraint by both Israel and Palestinians.
   Clovis Maksoud, the Arab League ambassador, told a news
conference he supports international monitoring ``broadly along the
lines put forward'' by Arafat.
   In his five-point proposal, Arafat urged the Security Council to
adopt a resolution ``to provide international protection to the
Palestinian people, to safeguard their lives, properties and holy
places in the occupied territories under the flag of the United
Nations and by means of international emergency forces.''
   Arafat did not elaborate on what kind of forces he meant.
   He also urged the deployment of a U.N. observer force ``with the
purpose of ending completely the Israeli occupation.''
   The permanent members of the Security Council, which have veto
power, are the United States, Soviet Union, Britain, Franc and
China. Current temporary members are Canada, Colombia, Ivory Coast,
Yemen, Cuba, Ethiopia, Finland, Malaysia, Romania and Zaire.

<HEAD>Lawyer Who Ditched Plane Over Atlantic Faces FCC Disbarment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Washington attorney who ditched his plane
in the Atlantic Ocean last summer was ordered Friday to show why he
shouldn't be disbarred from practicing before the Federal
Communications Commission.
   In the interim, Thomas L. Root has been suspended from
practicing law before the commission, the FCC said.
   The commission said it had acted because the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia entered an order April 12
disbarring Root by consent. FCC rules require that attorneys
practicing before it not be under any disbarment order.
   Telephone calls to Root's office Friday went unanswered.
   In March, Root was indicted on 33 counts of fraud and other
crimes involving radio stations he was representing before the FCC.
   The federal indictment accused Root of defrauding the government
and five clients in FCC proceedings on permits to construct FM
radio stations throughout the United States.
   Root gained notoriety last July when his single-engine plane ran
out of fuel and plunged into the Atlantic off the Bahamas following
a six-hour, 800-mile flight that began near Washington.
   He told authorities that he had been unconscious for most of the
odyssey, but Navy fighter pilots flying alongside the plane
reported seeing him move in the cockpit.
   When he was taken to a Florida hospital, Root was found to have
suffered a gunshot wound to the abdomen.
   Less than a week after the crash, Sonrise Management Services of
Columbus, Ga., sued Root for $584,000, claiming he failed to
perform work and double-billed a client.
   Root filed for bankruptcy court protection from creditors in
October 1989, claiming he had $1.64 million in liabilities.
   The federal indictment charged Root with 20 counts of wire and
mail fraud, seven counts of filing false legal documents with the
FCC, four counts of using counterfeit and altered federal
documents, and one count each of forgery and obstruction of the
grand jury's investigation.

   Imelda Marcos was almost certainly the owner of
four Manhattan commercial buildings, a real estate developer
testified Friday.
   Victor Politis, recalling a meeting where Mrs. Marcos was
briefed on the status of the buildings, said he would ``have to
consider myself a fool'' not to believe she was the owner.
   Defense attorneys expressed private dismay, conceding the
testimony may have been a sharp setback to Mrs. Marcos' claim that
she was never involved in the dealings.
   Under an increasingly hostile cross-examination by her attorney,
Gerry Spence, the prosecution witness said Mrs. Marcos never spoke
to him but that her closest friend had confided that she was the
``principal,'' or owner, of the buildings.
   ``You don't have the slightest idea whether what Mrs. (Gliceria)
Tantoco told you was true or not, do you?'' Spence demanded in the
hushed courtroom.
   ``If I had not met Mrs. Marcos and she had not acted like the
owner, you would be right,'' Politis replied. ``But I would have to
consider myself a fool not to put two and two together.''
   Mrs. Marcos is charged with fraud and embezzlement. She is
alleged to have helped her late husband, former Philippine
President Ferdinand Marcos, steal more than $220 million from their
country's treasury.
   The money was allegedly used to support a luxury lifestyle and
investments, including the four secretly purchased New York
properties.
   Earlier, a Geneva attorney testified that Mrs. Marcos reportedly
met as recently as two weeks ago with a Swiss lawyer hired to fight
the Philippine government's effort to seize billions of dollars
allegedly stashed in Swiss banks by her and her late husband.
   Sergio Salvioni, a Swiss lawyer representing the Manila
government, said he was told of the New York meeting by Bruno
DePreux, who he said had identified himself as representing the
former Philippine first lady.
   Under questioning by assistant U.S. attorney Charles LaBella,
Salvioni quoted DePreux as saying he originally was hired to
represent both Mrs. Marcos and her husband, following Marcos'
ouster in early 1986. Marcos died last year in Hawaiian exile.
   ``And now he represents Mrs. Marcos and her heirs,'' Salvioni
said.

   A federal judge Friday refused to dismiss
criminal charges or suppress videotapes in the drug case against
Mayor Marion Barry.
   U.S. District Court Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson rejected
defense arguments that the government engaged in prosecutorial
vindictiveness in bringing two indictments against the Washington,
D.C., mayor since February.
   Barry is scheduled to go to trial June 4 on cocaine possession,
conspiracy and perjury charges.
   There was no evidence of ``actual vindictiveness'' by the
government, the judge said in ruling on a series of pre-trial
motions.
   Defense attorney R. Kenneth Mundy alleged the government
jeopardized Barry's life by with the FBI sting operation Jan. 18 at
the Vista Hotel designed to coerce him into smoking crack cocaine.
   But ``no violence occurred, and no coercion was employed'' in
the Vista incident, the judge said in refusing to throw out the
charges.
   The judge said the FBI videotapes from the Vista were taken with
the permission of the room's occupant, ex-model Rasheeda Moore, who
cooperated with the government to persuade Barry to come there.
Jackson refused to bar the government from using the videotapes at
the trial.
   Jackson's decisions came at the end of a day of courtroom
arguments on aspects of the 14-count indictment.
   ``I feel very good about today,'' Barry said afterwards. ``We're
ready to go to trial.''
   A Feb. 15 indictment accused Barry of cocaine possession in the
sting operation, and with four other misdemeanor counts of
possessing cocaine and three felony counts of lying to a federal
grand jury. A superseding indictment adding five new possession
charges and a conspiracy charge was returned May 10.
   The government on Friday provided Barry with a list of the
alleged co-conspirators and agreed to provide the times and places
of the alleged cocaine possessions.
   Mundy will decide by Tuesday whether he wants to ask for the six
new charges to be separated from the earlier counts, which would
mean having a second trial at a later date.
   On the political front, Barry campaign officials said they
intend to pick up petitions for the upcoming mayoral race. Such a
move would be the first formal step Barry can take to enter the
Sept. 11 Democratic primary.
   The Washington Post said Friday a poll showed Barry has suffered
no significant erosion in his political base since his arrest. He
and Councilman John Ray were tied with 23 percent each of the 760
Democrats polled by the newspaper about their preference for the
Democratic mayoral nomination. The rest were split among four other
challengers.
   Barry has not publicly disclosed his political plans but has
made a series of campaign-style appearances across the District of
Columbia in recent weeks.
   Top Barry political aides, speaking on condition of anonymity,
say the mayor intends to seek a fourth, four-year term.
   Mundy said a cardiologist had concluded ``there was a high
risk'' to the ``life of Mr. Barry when the government offered him
89 percent pure crack cocaine.''
   Mundy said ``three very heavy drinks'' of cognac were poured
``just before the crack cocaine was smoked'' during Barry's
videotaped hotel room visit.
   FBI agents who burst into the room to arrest the mayor told
Barry to stay calm, that a doctor was present and that ``we are
aware of your prior cardiac problems,'' said Mundy.
   Barry has no history of heart trouble, according to medical
records the mayor released last year.
   Mundy wanted the cardiologist to testify, but the judge said his
testimony would be ``legally irrelevant'' and denied the request.

   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney has asked the
heads of the three national defense laboratories to explain their
new concerns about the safety of a short-range nuclear missile
carried aboard strategic bombers, the Pentagon said Friday.
   The directors, in congressional testimony Wednesday that
apparently caught some administration officials by surprise, called
for the withdrawal of the weapons, suggesting they could leak
plutonium in an accident.
   The weapons are known as the Short-Range Attack Missile-A, or
SRAM-A, and are carried on the B-1B, B-52 and FB-111A bombers and
is armed with a warhead known as the W-79.
   ``I have asked the Secretary of Energy and the directors of the
three national laboratories to brief me on their latest views of
the safety of the weapon, which the laboratory directors apparently
discussed with Congress earlier this week. If there is new
information about the SRAM-A, I want to hear it,'' Cheney said in a
statement released by the Pentagon.
   On Thursday, Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said the SRAM-A
meets all safety standards, but said a study was under way that
included looking into whether the weapons might be removed from the
bombers.
   The weapons will remain on the bombers pending the outcome of
the study, Williams said.
   Cheney's statement said that the safety of the warhead had been
reviewed in the summer of 1989, and that based on that review, some
handling procedures were modified.
   ``After that review, Secretary Cheney was assured that the
weapon was safe,'' the statement said.

   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev was named
Friday as the 1991 recipient of the Martin Luther King Jr.
Nonviolent Peace Prize.
   The award will be presented to Gorbachev on June 1 at the Soviet
Embassy in Washington, said Coretta Scott King, chief executive
officer of The King Center and widow of the slain civil rights
leader for whom the prize is named.
   ``No world leader has done more than President Gorbachev to
de-escalate the arms race and pave the way for greater democracy
and economic freedom around the world,'' Mrs. King said.
   The annual award includes a medal bearing the likeness of King,
a citation and a $1,000 stipend.
   The '91 award is being presented early so that it can be given
to Gorbachev during his U.S. visit, said King Center spokesman
Steve Klein.
   The 1990 recipient was the Rev. Joseph Lowery, president of the
Southern Christian Leadership Conference, the civil rights group
founded by King.

   A freight train derailment and explosion
that forced the evacuation of 750 people could have posed a greater
danger if it had occurred just two miles farther down the line,
authorities said Friday.
   Fifteen cars of a 90-car Illinois Central train derailed in a
rural area on the southern edge of this western Tennessee city of
6,100 at 10:30 p.m. Thursday, authorities said.
   One tanker filled with ethyl alcohol exploded, and three other
cars caught fire, but no one was hurt.
   ``We were lucky it occurred there and not two miles away in
downtown Covington,'' said Cecil Whaley, operation officer for the
Tennessee Emergency Management Agency in Nashville.
   Whaley said the biggest concentration of people that had to be
evacuated was 193 from a nursing home on U.S. Highway 51, which
runs parallel to the train tracks.
   ``We were very fortunate there were no injuries,'' he said.
``The cars that piled up were almost on top of each other. ...
There was tremendous damage to the train bed itself.''
   The cause of the accident was under investigation Friday by a
field representative from the Chicago office of the National
Transportation Safety Board and officers from the Tennessee Public
Service Commission.
   The NTSB in Washington said it was unlikely the cause would be
determined quickly.
   ``We can't say a lot until we develop information at the
scene,'' said Dave Watson of the NTSB's railroad division.
   People within a three-mile radius of the accident site were
evacuated, but were returning to their homes Friday.
   The exploded tanker and the two other cars that caught fire were
left to burn themselves out overnight. One was still burning Friday
afternoon.
   Of the derailed cars, eight contained denatured alcohol, and the
rest contained rock, soybeans and corn, said Covington Police Chief
Jerry Craig.
   Routine tests on the train's crew for drug or alcohol use would
be sent to a laboratory chosen by the Federal Railway
Administration, said Tom Utroska, transportation superintendent at
Illinois Central's Chicago office.
   There were no reports from the scene that the crew was impaired,
he said.
   Roy Davis, assistant superintendent of transportation for
Illinois Central, said the train originated in Champaign, Ill. It
was headed to Memphis, 40 miles southwest of Covington.
   Lt. Mike Craig of the Covington Fire Department said railroad
traffic would have to be rerouted.
   ``There's no way they can get through here,'' he said. ``It just
completely mangled the rails. They're backed up from here to I
don't know where.''
   Nellie Wilson, business manager of the Covington Manor Nursing
Home, said local people helped evacuate the residents by school
buses and ambulances.
   ``Local authorities and the community came together and were
just wonderful,'' she said.
   Denise Edmundson, a floral designer, said she returned to her
floral shop Thursday night to check on damage from the explosion.
   ``The sky was lit up with fire,'' she said. ``It was awesome.''

<HEAD>Abortion Rights Groups Makes Iowa Endorsement</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE GLOVER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An abortion rights group Friday endorsed
Democrat Don Avenson for governor, saying pro-choice forces should
unite behind a single candidate in the Democratic primary even
though two of three candidates support abortion rights.
   ``The stakes are too high for pro-choice leaders to remain on
the sidelines,'' said Shelley Bain, head of the Iowa affiliate of
the National Abortion Rights Action League.
   The group picked Avenson over former banker John Chrystal,
another pro- choice Democrat. Avenson, speaker of the Iowa House;
Chrystal; and Attorney General Tom Miller, an opponent of abortion,
are all running in the June 5 Democratic primary.
   After the Avenson endorsement, an angry Chrystal called NARAL
``tin-horn, would-be kingmakers from Washington.''
   ``Iowa Democrats won't let these would-be kingmakers tell them
how to vote,'' Chrystal said in a statement. He said NARAL ``does
not in any sense represent the views of Iowa voters concerned about
freedom of choice.''
   Miller echoed that sentiment, labeling the group an ``outside,
narrow, negative, single-interest group with their own agenda.''
   Avenson called the reaction of the other Democrats ``sour
grapes'' and said ``every one of them would love to have it. But
once we got it, there's something wrong with it.''
   The primary is the first major election in Iowa since the U.S.
Supreme Court last summer handed states new freedom to restrict
abortions. The exchange illustrates why many pro-choice activists
worry that Avenson and Chrystal will split the pro-choice vote and
give Miller the nomination.
   Ms. Bain said that political analysis brought the NARAL
endorsement.
   ``We were looking for a candidate we believed could win the
election on June 5 and also win against Terry Branstad in
November,'' she said.
   Branstad, the Republican incumbent, is unopposed in the GOP
primary. Like Miller, he is an opponent of abortion.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Rejects Final Appeal of Ceausescu's Top Henchmen</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Supreme Court on Friday rejected
the final appeal by four of Nicolae Ceausescu's top henchmen
against life sentences for backing the Communist dictator's order
to shoot in the December revolution, the state news agency Rompres
reported.
   The four were convicted of genocide on Feb. 2 at the first major
trial of top officials of the Ceausescu regime and sentenced to
life imprisonment.
   Emil Bobu, 62, former secretary of the Communist Party and
third-ranking member of Ceausescu's leadership; former state
council vice-president Manea Manescu, 74; politburo member Ion
Dinca, 64; and former Interior Minister Tudor Postelnicu, 59,
admitted they backed Ceausescu's orders to put down the uprising.
   The prosecution said they could have ended Ceausescu's 24-year
hold on power and prevented bloodshed.
   Rompres said the maximum life sentences on the four defendants
would remain.
   The military court at their trial ordered the seizure of all
property including gold, jewels and large sums of money, and
stripped them of their civil rights.
   In March, the four ex-officials won a postponement of their
appeal after lawyers argued the need for international research for
the first such case in Romania's history. The prosecution agreed on
grounds the defense should have all necessary information.
   During the appeal, heard in April, Postelnicu's lawyer argued
that the interior minister was guilty of a lesser charge and
Manescu's lawyer asked that all charges against him be dismissed.
   Postelnicu burst into tears asking for a 15-20 year prison term.
He told the court he did not try to absolve himself of guilt and of
the responsibility his position implied.
   ``I am a bloody sinner and handicapped. Please do not think that
I try to play the hero now but I ordered them not to shoot at
workers,'' he said.

   A woman's decision to donate seven
frozen embryos she won in a custody fight, rather than use them to
become pregnant, does not end the battle, her ex-husband said
Friday.
   ``I am totally against it,'' Junior Lewis Davis, who produced
the sperm for the embryos, said of his ex-wife's decision to donate
them to another childless couple.
   ``There is just no way I am going to donate them,'' Davis said.
   ``I feel that's my right. If there was a child from them, then I
would be a parent to it. And I don't want a child out there to be
mine if I can't be a parent to it.''
   Davis, 31, and his ex-wife, Mary Sue Davis Stowe, 29, have been
locked in a legal battle over the four-to-eight-cell embryos
conceived through in vitro fertilization in 1988 while they were
still married.
   In the only contested issue in their divorce, Blount County
Circuit Judge W. Dale Young ruled in September that temporary
custody of the embryos should go to Mrs. Stowe, who at the time
said she wanted to try to bring a child to term.
   The judge, taking the unprecedented step of ruling that ``life
begins at conception,'' accorded the embryos the same rights as
children. He said it would be in the embryos' best interests to be
with Mrs. Stowe.
   Davis has appealed the decision, which touched off a nationwide
debate on its impact on reproductive rights. The Tennessee Court of
Appeals scheduled oral arguments for June 6.
   Mrs. Stowe, who agreed she would not try to become pregnant with
the embryos until the case is settled, filed a response Thursday to
Davis' appeal.
   In it, her attorney, Kurt Erlenbach, wrote that if the court
rules in her favor ``her intention ... is not to implant the
embryos. She wants authority to donate the embryos so another
childless couple may use them.
   Erlenbach's wife and law partner, Susan Erlenbach, said that
Mrs. Stowe did not wish to disclose her reasons for deciding not to
have the frozen embryos implanted.
   ``All I can say is it's been a long and painful process in
making the decision,'' Mrs. Erlenbach said Friday from her office
in Titusville, Fla., where Mrs. Stowe now lives.
   ``If faced with the options of implantation or destruction
through non-use, (Mrs. Stowe) would strongly argue for the right to
implant the embryos,'' Erlenbach's brief said.
   ``The former Mrs. Davis seeks in this case only to preserve what
she has created while Mr. Davis seeks to destroy the potential for
life he very willingly and intentionally created.''
   But Davis said, ``That was very willingly and intentionally only
on the grounds of marriage in trying to produce a child.
   ``They need to be disposed of. In my view, they are not life. I
realize they are the potential for life, no matter how small the
percentage (of successful pregnancy) is. But they are not life.''
   Davis said his position has nothing to do with concern over any
potential legal obligations to children born from the embryos.
``It's really that it is my right to decide if I want to become a
parent,'' he said.
   Davis' appeal and a friend-of-the-court brief by the American
Civil Liberties Union argues that Young overstepped the bounds of
Tennessee law and the U.S. Constitution in his ruling.
   ``Because Judge Young's decision is inconsistent with the
existing laws, if not reversed, it will give rise to future
anomalous and absurd legal quagmires,'' Davis' appeal said.
   ``Forty-eight-hour-(old), fertilized embryos kept frozen will
enjoy enhanced protection, while first trimester fetuses will
continue to be aborted,'' the appeal said.
   Mrs. Stowe's response contends that the case has nothing to do
with abortion rights or parental privacy rights, and has no impact
beyond the fight between herself and her ex-husband.

<TEXT>
   Police on Friday called off an intense air
and ground hunt for two men suspected of shooting and wounding a
state trooper, briefly kidnapping a mother of three, and robbing a
savings and loan in Nebraska.
   About 100 officers cordoned off a square mile of rural country
west of here within 90 minutes of the shooting Thursday afternoon,
but didn't find the suspects.
   ``We were about 30 minutes behind them, though,'' Sedgwick
County Sheriff Mike Hill said Friday morning. ``We now believe they
probably are no longer in that area.''
   Highway Patrol Trooper Jeff Hersh was in good condition Friday
in a Wichita hospital. He was shot at least six times, in the
abdomen, arm and neck. Other bullets were stopped by his
bulletproof vest.
   The kidnap victim escaped unharmed.
   Hersh was shot after stopping a speeding car at 3:45 p.m.
Thursday on Interstate 135 about eight miles north of downtown
Wichita _ without knowing its occupants were suspected of having
robbed a savings and loan in Omaha that morning.
   As he approached the car to write a ticket, one of two men
inside opened fire with a 9mm pistol.
   Hersh returned fire, apparently wounding one suspect,
authorities said.
   The trooper was able to talk to officers who came to his aid.
   ``He was conscious. He was able to give us good information,''
said patrol Sgt. George Westphal.
   The suspects drove off and headed south for about a mile, then
left the highway and pulled into the driveway of a house near the
suburb of Valley Center at about 4 p.m.
   One man went into the house and confronted a baby sitter and
three children.
   A few minutes later, the children's mother, Kathy George, 35,
arrived home.
   The suspect pushed Mrs. George around and ordered her into the
family van, which the two men then drove off. The suspects left
their car in the George driveway, where it was later found by
police.
   After heading southwest for about an hour, the van hit a bump on
a rural road that jarred open the back door, said Mrs. George's
husband, Mike.
   When one suspect got out to close the door, Mrs. George jumped
out and ran, her husband said. She ran about a quarter-mile to a
home and called for help.
   The van was found abandoned near where she escaped, about three
miles west of Wichita. Officers swarmed the area to search wheat
fields and hedgerows with two airplanes, helicopters, dogs and
horses.
   ``We really feel like we've done the best we can at this point
both on the ground and in the air, so we're going to call it off,''
Wichita Police Chief Rick Stone said Friday morning.

<TEXT>
   In a child abuse case that has sparked an
outcry from advocates for battered women, a woman and her former
husband have been indicted in the beating death of the woman's
2-year-old son.
   A Travis County grand jury on Thursday returned indictments
against Robbi Zuliani and Gerald Christopher Zuliani, both 23.
   Zuliani is accused of beating Christopher Wohlers, Ms. Zuliani's
son from a previous marriage, and slamming him into a bathroom wall
on Jan. 2. The toddler died the next day.
   The boy had been hospitalized Dec. 22 after apparently being
abused, but was returned to the Zulianis, according to a Department
of Human Services investigation and a probe by the Texas attorney
general's office.
   Ms. Zuliani is accused of murder for failing to protect the
child or remove him. She and her ex-husband both face up to 99
years in prison if convicted.
   It wasn't the first time criminal charges had been brought in
connection with abuse of the the boy. Last summer, Ms. Zuliani's
then-boyfriend, Wayne Michael Hoffman, pleaded guilty to charges
that he forced the boy to sit in scalding water. He was sentenced
to 10 years in prison.
   Ms. Zuliani married Gerald Zuliani in December and divorced him
last month.
   She has said she was the victim of repeated abuse from Zuliani
and did not intervene for her child because she was afraid for
herself and her 4-year-old daughter. A psychologist has testified
that Ms. Zuliani has a dependent personality disorder and suffers
from post-traumatic stress syndrome.
   The charges against her triggered a courthouse protest by people
carrying signs that said: ``Stop Blaming the Victim'' and ``Arrest
Criminals, Not Battered Women.''
   The fact that the child was abused by a previous mate does not
make Ms. Zuliani any more to blame, said Kimberly Bryant, vice
chairman of a group called the Formerly Battered Women's Task Force.
   ``That just indicates how serious of a cycle of victimization
that any battered woman can be in,'' she said.
   But District Attorney Ronnie Earle said ``the law provides for
the same kind of punishment whether the crime is done by act or by
omission.''
   He added, however, that ``it doesn't mean we will seek the same
punishment'' for the two defendants. She could be placed on
probation, he said.
   Zuliani remains in the Travis County Jail in lieu of $50,000
bond. Ms. Zuliani is free on bond.

<TEXT>
   Chancellor Helmut Kohl urged Moscow on
Friday to stop fighting NATO membership for a united Germany,
saying history shows European stability is best assured when
Germany is firmly anchored to an alliance.
   ``There must be no second Versailles,'' said Kohl, referring to
the 1919 treaty that resulted in German isolation and paved the way
for the rise of Nazism.
   Speaking at the end of a 113-nation disarmament conference in
Bonn, Kohl also said he favors reducing nuclear weapons in Europe
to a minimum but not their complete removal.
   He was addressing the International Parliamentary Union, which
is made up of federal lawmakers from around the world who meet
periodically to discuss disarmament and other matters.
   The organization has no actual powers.
   The Soviet Union rejects NATO's demand that a united Germany
belong to the Western alliance.
   But Kohl said such membership was actually in the best interests
of the Soviet Union and all Europe.
   ``The first and most important lesson which history has taught
us is that peace, stability and security were guaranteed in Europe
whenever Germany ... maintained firm bonds with its neighbors .. .
in a relationship marked by mutually beneficial exchanges,'' said
Kohl.
   Alluding to two world wars waged by the Germans, Kohl added,
``Whenever Germany chose _ out of overbearing blindness or criminal
hubris _ to pursue a separate path or when former enemies forced it
into isolation following its defeat, the immediate consequence for
Europe was conflict, instability and uncertainty.
   ``For this reason, there can be no thought of united Germany
being neutral, demilitarized or non-aligned.
   ``We Germans therefore want to exercise our sovereign right: we
want to belong to an alliance, namely to the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization.''
   Kohl said only NATO ``can create true equilibrium in Europe.''
   In East Berlin, East German Prime Minister Lothar de Maiziere
said he would like to see a new ``collective European security
system'' with a united Germany as member.
   It was not clear if de Maiziere was saying he opposed at least
temporary NATO membership for a united Germany until such a
security system is created. De Maiziere has been vague on the issue.
   Kohl sought to soothe Soviet worries about a shift in the
European balance of power after unification, saying NATO does not
``wish to gain any unilateral advantage.''
   But he also indirectly criticized the Soviets for slower
progress at conventional forces negotiations in Vienna.
   ``I appeal to all participants: do not squander the historic
opportunity to make headway now in Europe toward a more secure and
stable balance of conventional forces at lower levels,'' Kohl said.
   He said Germans will continue to ``renounce the possession,
manufacture and control of nuclear, biological and chemical
weapons.''
   The chancellor said he favors not only keeping U.S. troops in
Europe, but keeping nuclear weapons on the Continent. He said
NATO's nuclear capability has ``guaranteed the longest period of
peace in modern history in Europe.''
   Kohl proposed a summit every two years of leaders of the
35-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe and
creation of ``pan-European institutions'' such as a ``conflict
prevention center'' and one for the ``verification of arms control
agreements.''
   Earlier Friday, Kohl's government renewed its warning that
delays in the planned July 2 economic merger with East Germany
could trigger discontent among the East German populace.

<HEAD>Romania's New Leader Calls for Freer Markets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDITH M. LEDERER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ion Iliescu, the first ex-Communist to
win a popular presidential election in Eastern Europe, pledged
Friday to begin dismantling centralized planning in favor of freer
markets.
   Also Friday, final official results from Sunday's election gave
Iliescu a landslide 85 percent of the vote in Romania's first free
election in 53 years. Iliescu, 60, a former Communist Party
Politburo member, said Parliament's main task will be to write a
new constitution the next two years. Iliescu's National Salvation
Front, which won two-thirds of the seats in the two-chamber
Parliament, has enough votes to draft the document singlehandedly.
   Now that he is president-elect, Iliescu announced he would
resign as the Front's president. He said it was up to the members
of the Front to choose a new president.
   In the final tally announced Friday, Iliescu's strongest rival,
Radu Campeanu of the National Liberal Party, won only 10 percent of
the vote. Ion Ratiu of the National Peasant Party came in third
with 4 percent.
   In the Chamber of Deputies, the Front received 66 percent of the
vote. The Hungarian Democratic Union, with just over 7 percent of
the vote, emerged as the biggest opposition party, reflecting the
unity of Romania's 2 million ethnic Hungarians.
   In the Senate, the Front gained 67 percent, and the Hungarian
Democratic Union took 7 percent.
   Iliescu was vague Friday on his plans for his new government to
be announced in 20 days.
   ``The coming period will ... be complicated for the country's
economy, social life and political climate,'' he added. ``Measures
should be elaborated ...to move from a rigid centralized economy to
a market economy.''
   Iliescu said the Front would spearhead the fight against
corruption, which he said had worsened since the December
revolution that toppled Communist dictator Nicolae Ceausescu.
   However, Iliescu's earlier call for a broad coalition government
appeared to be drawing little support.
   ``I believe that we are going to make a constructive
opposition,'' said Hungarian Democratic Union leader Geza Domokos.
   The Liberals said Friday they plan to take their seats in
Parliament, despite charges of election fraud. They said they favor
a united opposition.
   ``We will firmly contribute to the establishment of genuine
democracy in Romania,'' their statement said. ``We will collaborate
with all forces joining in the struggle against totalitarian
structures. We think a realistic parliamentary opposition must be
formed.''
   In another development, six anti-government groups occupying
University Square for more than a month said in a statement Friday
they didn't want hunger strikers supporting them to die and
therefore wanted to change the nature of their protest.
   However, one protest leader, Marian Andrusca, said, ``We will
not leave the square, and we do not agree with the communique.''

<HEAD>Shooting Death of Former Devotee Was Key in Indictment, U.S.
Attorney Says</HEAD>

   The shooting death of a disillusioned
devotee played a key role in the indictment of a Hare Krishna swami
and two followers on murder and racketeering charges, a federal
prosecutor said Friday.
   The indictment Thursday by a special federal grand jury in
Elkins charged that Kirtanananda Swami Bhaktipada, 54, previously
known as Keith Ham, was part of a conspiracy to kill Stephen Bryant
of suburban Detroit.
   Bhaktipada was named in five racketeering counts, including
conspiracy to commit murder-for-hire, and six counts of mail fraud.
   Bryant, who'd launched a one-man campaign against Bhaktipada's
New Vrindaban community about 80 miles southwest of Pittsburgh, was
gunned down on a Los Angeles street in May 1986. He had accused
Bhaktipada and others at the commune of drug trafficking,
prostitution, and child abuse, the indictment said.
   ``There was never one particular break in the case,'' U.S.
Attorney William Kolibash said Friday. ``The FBI has been involved
in this investigation back about five or six years ago based upon
some of Bryant's allegations.
   ``But what really got us all involved in the case was the Bryant
murder,'' Kolibash said. ``That's when it appeared there was some
federal jurisdiction.''
   The 46-page document alleged that Bhaktipada authorized Bryant's
killing and the 1983 murder of Charles St. Denis, a fringe member
of New Vrindaban.
   Thomas A. Drescher, who once lived at New Vrindaban, was
convicted of St. Denis' murder. He also has been charged with
Bryant's slaying and is awaiting trial on a murder charge in Los
Angeles.
   In addition to the alleged murder conspiracies and racketeering
operations, the indictment said Bhaktipada was involved in a
child's abduction in 1979 and used the mails in a fraudulent
charity scam and to defraud an insurance company.
   Also named in the indictment were Terry Sheldon, 31, also known
as Mr. Scam and Tapahpunja; Steven Fitzpatrick, 36, also known as
Sundarakara; New Vrindaban Community Inc.; Govardhan Inc.; and the
Cathedral of Healing Inc.
   Kolibash said Bhaktipada's representatives have assured the
government that the swami would appear for his arraignment, which
is to be held within the next two weeks.
   Bhaktipada was expected to return to New Vrindaban, late Friday
night or early Saturday, said Gadadhar Das, a spokesman for the
community.
   Sheldon and Fitzpatrick are not in custody and remain fugitives,
according to Bob Reutter, head agent in the FBI's Pittsburgh office.
   Leaders of the community on Friday called the charges ``spurious
and entirely without merit.''
   ``Millions of taxpayer dollars were spent on the investigation
yielding those trumped-up charges against Swami Bhaktipada,'' the
community said in a statement. ``But we welcome the opportunity
because it will establish our innocence.''
   The three racketeering counts against Bhaktipada each carry a
maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and a fine of $250,000,
Kolibash said.
   Interstate travel to commit murder for hire carries a maximum
penalty of life in prison and a $250,000 fine; conspiracy to travel
in interstate commerce to commit murder for hire, conspiracy to
commit mail fraud and mail fraud each carry a maximum penalty of
five years in prison and a fine of $250,000.
   The corporations named in the indictment face only fines and no
corporate officers were charged, Kolibash said.
   Federal prosecutors are seeking the forfeiture of any holdings
that Bhaktipada, Sheldon or the corporations have in New Vrindaban
that were gained as a result of the alleged racketeering.
   The government also is seeking a temporary restraining order to
prevent the destruction or alteration of buildings on the
compound's 4,000 acres.

   Here is a look at some major events in the Soviet
Union and Soviet-related events elsewhere on Friday:
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   MOSCOW _ President Mikhail S. Gorbachev made the Kremlin's most
dire warning yet about what steps the Soviet Union would take if a
reunited Germany joins the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, as
both President Bush and West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl desire.
   He told a news conference after meeting visiting French
President Francois Mitterrand that Moscow would keep its troops in
eastern Germany and would review its policies on European arms
control and security negotiations if Germany joined NATO.
   He repeated the Soviet preference that a reunited Germany belong
to both NATO and the Warsaw Pact, or _ as an alternative _ follow
France's lead and take part only in NATO political activities.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   EAST BERLIN _ The Soviet Union said a massive housing shortage
back home has forced it to suspend indefinitely withdrawal of
nearly one-tenth of its troops from East Germany, as it promised in
December 1988.
   Officials in Bonn say the pullout was to include about 36,000
troops and that Moscow had pulled out about 12,000. Soviet
officials put the number higher.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
   MOSCOW _ The leaders of secessionist Lithuania are
``adventurists,'' President Mikhail S. Gorbachev said, and he
demanded again that they back down from their March 11 declaration
of independence.
   ``We have great reserves of will power, but we are looking for
ways'' to end the impasse, Gorbachev said.
   Lithuanian officials said hot water supplies throughout the
Baltic republic were shut off because regional distribution
stations ran out of oil as a result of Soviet economic sanctions.

   OTTAWA _ Prime Minister Brian Mulroney will hold talks next week
with Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, giving both men a brief
respite from domestic troubles stirred up in restive provinces.
   Gorbachev will arrive Tuesday for a 36-hour visit before heading
to Washington for his summit with President Bush.
   Emerging nationalism in the Soviet Union is a major headache
facing Gorbachev.
   In Canada, the desire of French-speaking Quebec for recognition
as a ``distinct society'' has led to Mulroney's biggest political
crisis.

   MOSCOW _ Beleaguered Soviet Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov asked
consumers to stop panic buying of food, triggered by his
announcement of plans for steep price increases, and urged
parliament to quickly approve economic reforms.
   Opposition deputies demanded a no-confidence vote to bring down
Ryzhkov's government, but President Mikhail S. Gorbachev expressed
support for Ryzhkov.
   Ryzhkov's plan proposes tripling the price of bread and other
flour-based products on July 1 and increasing the prices of most
other consumer goods in January. It envisions a five-year gradual
shift to a government-regulated market economy by freeing most
prices, raising taxes, selling off state property, and reducing
central control of industry.

<TEXT>
   MOSCOW _ Russian lawmakers voted on whether populist Boris N.
Yeltsin, a onetime Gorbachev ally, would become president of the
Soviet Union's largest republic.
   Yeltsin, ousted two years ago as Moscow Communist Party chief
after calling for faster reform, got a double boost when Russian
deputies and Soviet news media praised a key campaign speech he
made, and when Russian Premier Alexander Vlasov, the candidate
backed by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, withdrew.
   But Yeltsin needs backing from 531 of the 1,059 members of the
Russian Congress, more than he himself has estimated he could count
on. Official results are expected Saturday.
   Ivan Polozkov, a Communist Party chief from the southern Russia
city of Krasnodar, is Yeltsin's main rival.

   Tornadoes battered central Kansas and swept through several
other states in the Midwest and the Rockies before stormy weather
eased Friday.
   In central Kansas, residents began cleaning up from nine
twisters Thursday that derailed a freight train, destroyed homes
and injured at least four people. Authorities estimated damage at
more than $3 million.
   Six tornadoes were reported in Wyoming, two hit Montana and one
touched down in South Dakota, the National Weather Service said. No
deaths were reported in any of the twisters.
   Four oil workers leapt from an oil rig near Bushton, Kan., and
tried to outrun an approaching tornado in a car. But the car was
tossed into a field and the four men had to be cut free, said
Barton County Sheriff Jim Daily.
   They were hospitalized in good condition Friday with cuts and
buises, he said.
   A twister derailed 88 of 107 cars on a Missouri Pacific Railroad
freight train just west of Bushton, about 160 miles west of Topeka.
None of the crew members was injured.
   Downed power lines forced officials to close an eight-mile
stretch of state Highway 4 between Claflin and Bushton for three
hours. Nolan Howell of Great Bend said he counted at least a dozen
demolished or seriously damaged farms between those two towns.
   Weekend forecasts for the tornado-stricken area called for
milder weather, with thunderstorms possible, the weather service
said.
   In Nebraska, more than an inch of rain and hail as big as golf
balls fell overnight on northern and eastern sections of the state.
   Rain runoff washed out some county roads and caused minor
flooding, said officials in Valentine.
   The break in the weather was welcomed in flooded areas of Texas,
Oklahoma and Arkansas.
   In Arkansas on Friday, six counties were added to the federal
disaster list, increasing to 31 the number of counties in which
residents are eligible for emergency assistance.
   Arkansas recorded its first flood-related death on Thursday.
Larry Johnson, 35, of Hot Springs, who had been in a coma since
Saturday night, died of injuries suffered when he was swept through
a drainage ditch while trying to rescue occupants of a car trapped
in high water.
   Flooding that began late last month has been blamed for 13
deaths in Texas and one in Oklahoma and hundreds of millions of
dollars in crop and property damage.
   On Friday, Trinity River Authority officials slowed the release
of water through the floodgates of the Lake Livingston Dam to
71,500 cubic feet per second, and expected to lower it further
during the weekend. Last week, releases hit a record 100,800 cfs,
causing flooding along the Trinity River downstream. One cubic foot
of water equals 7.5 gallons.
   In Louisiana, also hard-hit by recent floods, officials said
they expected rainwater flowing down the Black and Mississippi
rivers to spill over during the first week of June.
   Farmers in the Brouillette area of Avoyelles Parish hastily
brought in wheat harvests to beat the anticipated flooding.
   The overflow was expected to begin south of Alexandria in
central Louisiana on June 4, said John Barnhart of the Army Corps
of Engineers.

<HEAD>Officials Say Church-run Food Program Will Continue</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   U.S. and Roman Catholic charities officials
said Friday a church-administered program to feed poor people in
India will continue under tighter control because of irregularities
discovered in an audit.
   ``The food supply may be reduced temporarily until Catholic
Relief Services improves the management of the program,'' said John
Metelsky, a spokesman for the U.S. Agency for International
Development. ``CRS has already reduced the (number of) feeding
centers in India.''
   Catholic Relief Services had been receiving $25 million a year
in U.S. grain for distribution by 4,600 groups in India.
   The organization's headquarters in Baltimore described as
``misleading and distorted'' reports from India about the audit.
   First word of the audit appeared in a dispatch from New Delhi in
Friday editions of The Washington Post. Officials in New Delhi
later provided additional information.
   A reorganization two years ago strengthened management and
record-keeping ``and the recent audit acknowledged the improvements
being undertaken,'' said Robert Chatten, the charity's director of
public and governmental affairs.
   Chatten said the audit ``did not find, nor do we believe there
exists, any pattern of widespread misuse of food in the India
program. The audit did conclude that, whatever problems may exist,
food is reaching the poor'' and ``that is the point of the
program,'' he added.
   The audit by the U.S. accounting firm of Price Waterhouse was
ordered by AID officials and concluded last December.
   It said officials of India's Roman Catholic Church drew up bogus
lists of food recipients and used donations to run businesses.
Clergy also purposely exaggerated the amount of aid they
distributed and filed false reports to hide the abuses, the audit
said.
   The audit estimated that records for food distribution and
actual food distribution differed by about $4 million.
   The U.S. Embassy in New Delhi said the Central Bureau of
Investigation, India's version of the FBI, and the investigative
wing of the U.S. Agency for International Development are looking
into the reported abuses.

<HEAD>Reported Massacre Prompts France to Cancel Trip to Zaire</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The French government on Friday postponed an
official's visit to Zaire because of reports that country's troops
massacred university students opposed to President Mobutu Sese Seko.
   The Foreign Ministry statement did not say if the postponement
was made to protest the reported killings. It said only that the
visit of Francophone Minister Alain Decaux to the central African
nation will be delayed indefinitely.
   Foreign Minister Mark Eyskens of Belgium confirmed Thursday that
a number of Lubumbashi University students in that southeastern
city had been killed by Zairean soldiers two weeks ago.
   Belgian press reports say 50 to 150 students opposing Mobutu's
regime had been murdered by special commandos of his personal guard
on the night of May 11.
   Amnesty International, the human rights group, said Thursday the
unarmed students died in a ``premeditated and extensive'' attack.
Many more students were believed to have been injured, the
London-based organization said.
   Zaire authorities have acknowledged one dead and 13 injured.
   Mobutu, who has ruled for 25 years, recently announced he would
allow two opposition political parties. But student opponents want
quicker and broader democratic changes.
   Decaux was to meet with Mobutu on Tuesday to discuss an October
1991 summit in Zaire of French-speaking nations. Decaux is charged
by the French government with fostering the French language.

<TEXT>
   Rival Shiite Moslem militias fought in
west Beirut with machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades on
Friday, killing four people, wounding 42 and trapping scores of
children in schools, police said.
   At sundown, the combat spread to south Beirut's shantytowns of
Hajjaj and Hay Madi, where many of the 16 Western hostages in
Lebanon are believed held by pro-Iranian Shiite extremists.
   Police said they could not tell if the hostages were in
immediate danger.
   Radio stations interrupted programs to broadcast appeals for a
cease-fire so parents could evacuate the children. ``Please,
please, let them stop fighting. Let them have mercy on these
innocent children,'' an unidentified woman pleaded on the Moslem
Voice of the Nation radio.
   Fighters of pro-Iranian Hezbollah and Syrian-backed Amal battled
around the city's sports stadium for three hours. The fighting
stopped shortly after noon when Syrian soldiers intervened, police
said _ only to re-ignite three hours later in the densely
populated, mostly Shiite slums south of the capital.
   Both factions fought heavy street battles in the dusty alleyways
of Shiyah and Ghobeiri, police said. They also reported fighting
around the airport highway on the outskirts of the southern suburbs.
   The west Beirut contingent of an estimated 40,000 Syrian troops
deployed in Lebanon under a 1976 Arab League peacekeeping mandate
intervened again to try to end the slums' fighting and withdraw
militiamen from the streets.
   By police count, at least 1,048 people have been killed and
3,136 wounded in a 2{-year-old power struggle between the rival
militias for supremacy of Lebanon's 1.2 million Shiites, the
country's largest sect.
   Fighting broke out after Hezbollah accused Amal militiamen of
kidnapping four of its members.
   It came as Christian spiritual leaders met in Bkirki, north of
the capital, and called for consolidation of a cease-fire to end
three months of savage fighting between rebel Gen. Michel Aoun and
the Lebanese Forces militia under Samir Geagea.
   The two forces have fought for control of the Christian enclave
north of the capital since Jan.30 in the fiercest fighting between
rival Christians since Lebanon's civil war began in 1975.
   The leaders received a videotaped message from Pope John Paul II
urging the Lebanese ``in the name of the love I feel for you ... to
seek dialogue, overcome your fears and always love your Lebanon.''
   At least 1,031 people have died in the Christian battles.
   Excerpts of the pope's message were broadcast in Arabic by
Beirut radio stations.

<HEAD>International Monetary Fund Renews Aid to Argentina</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Argentina will be allowed to draw $240 million
of a $1.7 billion International Monetary Fund loan from which
payments were suspended last February, a source said Friday.
   The disbursements were suspended after IMF said President Carlos
Menem's government had failed to meet conditions.
   The source, speaking only on condition of anonymity, said
Argentina could use part of the $240 million to buy back some of
its $60 billion debt at a discount. It owes about $40 billion to
banks, most of them in the United States. Last week, that part of
the debt could be bought on the New York market for 14 cents on the
dollar.
   A portion of the new disbursement also could be used to reduce
the South American nation's $4 billion annual loan payments, the
source said. One official said the amount available for that
purpose would be more than 25 percent of the $240 million.
   Argentina is $6 billion behind on payments.
   The spokesman said future drawings also could be used for
reduction of Argentine debt and payments. But whether they would be
permitted depends on whether the fund decides that Menem's
government is meeting new requirements.
   Menem's government has been following the kind of austerity
program the fund usually requires as a condition for aid. Budget
cuts have been made, price controls have been lifted and plans have
been announced for privatization of government-owned companies.
   The fund's decision was made behind closed doors by the 22
members of the IMF's board of executive directors, who represent
the 152 countries that own the fund. It rarely gives details of its
decisions, saying it's up to the borrowers to disclose them.

   An Air Force fighter jet crashed into a
residential area in rural south Georgia on Friday, killing the
pilot and a housekeeper as it ignited two homes and hurled fiery
debris across a highway.
   It was the second time since November that a military jet
crashed in Georgia and killed civilians on the ground.
   Kathleen Guthrie, executive secretary at the Atkinson County
sheriff's department, confirmed the deaths, but identities were
unavailable. Ms. Guthrie said no one else was killed, although she
earlier had reported three deaths.
   The F-16A ``Fighting Falcon'' was on a training flight from
Moody Air Force Base near Valdosta _ about 40 miles away _ to Lake
George Weapons Range in Florida when it crashed. The pilot was the
only occupant, said base spokeswoman Dee Tait.
   One house and a mobile home were destroyed when the jet slammed
into a row of homes on U.S. 441 north of Pearson shortly after 9:30
a.m., authorities said.
   At least seven other homes, including that of Mary Alice and
Curtiss Corbitt across the highway, were damaged by debris that
flew in all directions.
   ``I'm going to praise the Lord for protecting me and my wife,''
said Corbitt, 65, who suffered scrapes and bruises. ``When it
happened, I said `This is the end.'''
   Firefighters continued spraying water Friday afternoon onto the
smoldering remains of a brick house leveled by the crash, in which
the housekeeper was killed.
   The plane apparently hit the house and the mobile home behind
it, then traveled diagonally across the highway to the Corbitt
house, where all the windows were blown out and large sections of
the roof ripped away.
   Corbitt family members said flying debris touched off a fire
inside the house and cut two tall pine trees in front of the house
in half.
   Parts of pine trees and twisted metal pieces of the aircraft,
the largest about the size of a briefcase, littered the highway,
which was reopened to traffic late Friday afternoon.
   Atkinson County Sheriff Earl Haskins said the largest piece of
debris he has seen from the wreckage was part of a wing, which was
about the size of a car roof.
   A search team from the Moody base combed the woods near the
Corbitt house, putting remains of the plane into black plastic bags.
   Air Force Col. Stu Mosbey, interim president of Moody's board of
inquiry, refused to say whether the pilot's body had been recovered.
   The plane was carrying 20mm practice bullets, some of which
apparently caught fire after the crash; six practice bombs, and a
practice, unarmed, Sidewinder missile, Mosbey said. All the items
were recovered, he said.
   The plane cost about $9 million, said manufacturer General
Dynamics Corp. Another plane participating in the training flight
returned to Moody after the crash, Mosbey said.
   Mosbey estimated it would take 30 days to determine the cause of
the crash.
   ``We heard the explosion. ... It knocked our power off,'' said
Martha White, owner of the Country Kitchen Restaurant, about 1{
miles from the crash site.
   ``It was very loud _ almost like a sonic boom,'' said David
McDonald, assistant principal at Atkinson County High School, less
than a mile from the site. ``It shook real hard.''
   The crash site is about two miles north of Pearson, a town of
about 2,000 and the county seat of rural Atkinson County.
   The Pearson Volunteer Fire Department sent both of its units to
fight the fires, and departments from neighboring towns also were
called in.
   In November, a Navy jet crashed into an apartment complex north
of Atlanta and burst into flames, killing two residents of the
complex and seriously wounding the pilot. The fighter was trying to
land at Dobbins Air Force Base when it crashed in suburban Smyrna.
   A year ago, a jet from Moody accidentally dropped a live,
500-pound bomb onto a rural area of Marion County in western
Georgia. Air Force officials said a worn-out, malfunctioning bomb
rack caused the F-16 to drop it. The bomb exploded, but no one was
injured and no major damage was reported.

<DATELINE>VALLETTA, Malta (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Pope John Paul II on Friday said the
Roman Catholic Church must be allowed to play its historic leading
role on Malta, despite recent church-state tensions on this
Mediterranean island nation.
   John Paul flew in from Rome for a three-day visit, the first by
a pope to Malta. The Vatican says Malta, south of Italy, is 99
percent Catholic.
   During his visit, the pontiff stressed ``the unique and lasting
contribution that the Christian faith has made to Malta.'' He also
made thinly veiled references to the problems the church has faced.
   The Maltese say their Christian tradition dates to the year 60,
when Saint Paul was shipwrecked on the island. However, a visit by
the pope was considered unthinkable under the previous socialist
government.
   Ruling from 1971 until an electoral defeat in 1987, the Labor
Party carried out a campaign the church said was aimed at
undermining its dominant role in Maltese life.
   The government barred private schools, including Catholic ones,
from charging tuition. It also ordered the church to hand over
property it could not prove the it owned.
   Some of the bitterness stemmed from the 1960s, when the church
was at odds with socialist officials and supporters.
   John Paul praised the new climate is this country of 350,000
residents under the Nationalist administration of Eddie Fenech
Adami, a regular churchgoer.
   In remarks to Prime Minister Adami and President Vincent Tabone,
the pope sketched his vision of the role of the church in Malta.
   ``It is important that the church should enjoy freedom in the
institutional and administrative spheres, and that she should be
free from all undue pressures, obstacles and manipulation,'' John
Paul said.
   ``In a word, it is essential that the church should be enabled
to act effectively in fulfilling her mission to all people.''
   Scores of Maltese in a holiday mood lined the pope's motorcade
route as he drove in from the airport Friday and passed the
fortresses built by the Knights of Malta, mobilized in the 16th
century to defend Christian Europe against the Ottoman Turks.
   On Saturday, John Paul will cross in a catamaran to Gozo, the
second largest island in the archipelago, and address workers in a
Labor Party stronghold.
   The Maltese pilgrimage is John Paul's 48th foreign tour as pope.
   President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev met at
Malta for a summit in December.

a spokesman said Friday.
   ``He has no intention of withdrawing them,'' said Peter
Riddleberger, a spokesman for President Barber Conable.
   Of the total, $400 million would be lent at less than 1 percent
annual interest.
   Opponents say the loans should not be granted because of China's
suppression of human rights. The Bush administration has said that
loans should be only granted for basic human needs.
   Conable has said the bank lends only on economic considerations,
and the delay of $780 million worth of loans after the brutal
suppression of pro-Democracy demonstrations last June was to gain
time to look into the economic effects of the action.
   Pastor Sison, a bank Asia specialist, said a projected $300
million for planting trees in 15 Chinese provinces would be the
biggest loan ever granted for forestry.
   That loan and another for $150 million, to improve roads and
waterways in the Nanjing area, are due to be considered behind
closed doors on Tuesday.
   The decision will be made by a 22-member board of executive
directors, who represent the 152 countries that own the bank. The
United States holds about 20 percent of the voting power on the
board.
   One official, who spoke on condition he not be named, said the
Bush administration was opposing the transport loan and was still
considering its stand on the forestry loan Friday.
   Robert Levine, a spokesman for the Treasury, said he would have
nothing to disclose on the U.S. position until after the vote.
   On Thursday the office of Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas,
chairman of the House Banking Committee, distributed copies of a
letter he sent to Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, arguing
against the loans. Gonzalez said approval would make it hard to get
approval of more money for the World Bank and would raise
opposition to the new Bank for European Reconstruction and
Development being established to help the new democracies of
Eastern Europe.
   Last year the bank lent $1.35 billion to China, but in 11 months
of the current fiscal year loans to China have totaled on $140
million.

   The Navy should pay millions in damages after a congressional
report rejected the service's finding that a sailor's sabatoge
caused last year's fatal USS Iowa explosion, an attorney for the
sailor's family said Friday.
   ``I am more convinced than ever that we have a legitimate claim
for intentional and negligent infliction of emotion distress
against the Navy,'' Kreig Brusnahan said from his Cleveland office.
   Brusnahan represents the family of Gunner's Mate Clayton
Hartwig, one of 47 sailors killed when an explosion and fireball
ripped through the battleship's No. 2 turret April 19, 1989.
   A four-month, $4 million investigation by the Navy concluded
Hartwig most likely caused the explosion by inserting a detonating
device between bags of powder in the 16-inch guns.
   But Thursday, the Navy announced it was reopening its
investigation and was suspending the use of the 16-inch guns after
an explosion at a test site.
   And on Friday, a General Accounting Office report to the Senate
Armed Services committee said it could not support the Navy's
original findings. The GAO report suggested that gunpowder bags may
have been unintentionally rammed too hard and too far into the
barrel.
   ``It is my belief that the Navy spent in excess of $4 million to
frame Clayton Hartwig,'' Brusnahan said. ``They ought to give the
family at least that much to compensate for the hell they have put
them through.''
   The Navy's original report triggered protests from some of the
families of the 47 sailors. Other families said they were satisfied
with the report.
   The protests prompted the Senate and House Armed Services
committees to hold hearings on the Navy's investigation. Earlier
this year, the House committee issued a report highly critical of
the Navy's probe.
   With the investigation reopened, many of the families are hoping
the questions they had about the explosion will be answered.
   The GAO report said the Navy's battleships were troubled by lack
of qualified sailors in the turrets.
   ``That's what my husband always complained about,'' said Sharon
Ziegler. Her husband, Reginald, was the senior enlisted man in the
turret.
   ``He had to spend a lot of extra overtime in training the kids.
They pushed a lot of people into the turret, but most of them
didn't know what to do,'' she said from her home in Rushville, N.Y.
   Kathy Kubicina, Hartwig's sister, raised questions about the
powder used in the 16-inch guns. The GAO report pointed to the
arrangement of gunpowder pellets in the bags as a possible cause of
excess friction that may have caused detonation.
   ``What we're driving for is for them to get rid of all that
powder,'' Nancy Lewis said. The Northville, Mich., woman was in
Washington with Ms. Kubicina for the Senate hearing. Mrs. Lewis'
son, Richard, died in the explosion.
   Brusnahan expects to submit a claim to the Navy within 90 days.
The Navy will have six months to respond. If the claim is rejected,
Brusnahan said he will file with the federal courts.
   Several of the families said the best result of the reopening of
the investigation was the clearing of Hartwig's name.
   ``I'm glad that that family has finally gotten some relief out
of this,'' Mrs. Ziegler said.
   ``Not only have they lost their son, they have had to suffer
with the accusation that their son killed 46 other people. I can't
conceive the pain and heartache they must feel,'' said Darleen
Schelin of El Toro, Calif. Mrs. Schelin's son, Geoffrey, was among
the 47 killed.
   ``At a minimum, the Navy should be ashamed of itself for
allowing the other families to believe that Clayton Hartwig killed
their sons,'' Brusnahan said.
   The Navy issued a statement saying it ``will continue to test
additional theories dealing with the possible causes of the
explosion.''

   The government banned 40 percent of all
motor vehicles from downtown Friday in an effort to reduce a
health-threatening cloud of smog covering the city and its 4.5
million residents.
   Declaring a state of environmental emergency in Santiago, the
government also ordered 18 industries across the city to reduce
production by 20 percent. In addition, it banned weekday use of
fireplaces in private homes.
   Half the city's public buses were ordered to remain off the
streets on Saturday and Sunday.
   Eduardo Arriagada, head of a federal anti-pollution commission
for Santiago, said the measures will be examined daily to determine
whether they should be lifted, maintained or intensified.
   For several years, authorities have kept 20 percent of the city
vehicles off the streets on weekdays. The new measure, expected to
continue until pollution conditions improve, doubled the
restriction. The banned vehicles are determined according to the
final digit in their license plates. The numbers change each day.
   Arriagada said the emergency was declared after the number of
contaminating particles in the air surpassed 300, a level
internationally considered dangerous to the human health.
   Santiago is considered one of the world's smoggiest cities,
along with Mexico City and Los Angeles.

   Two of three women who tried to kill and
dismember a man with an ax in an attempt to resurrect Jack the
Ripper were sentenced Friday to five years each in prison.
   Catherine Lipsham, 23, and Ramona Barry, 27, pleaded guilty last
month to attempted first-degree intentional homicide in the May
1989 attack on Jeffery Meka, 27, who suffered a severe gash above
the eye.
   Deborah Kazuck, 27, who a jury ruled wielded the ax, was found
insane by a judge in the second phase of her trial and sent to a
mental hospital.
   Attorneys for Ms. Lipsham and Ms. Barry asked the court for
leniency Friday, saying the women suffered from mental illness and
past abuses and had not actually committed the assault.
   But Milwaukee County Circuit Judge William D. Gardner called
them members of ``an immoral cult of three'' and sentenced them to
prison.
   Although the two women cooperated with prosecutors during Ms.
Kazuck's trial, the victim could have been killed if he was ``less
strong or if the blow had been more appropriately placed,'' the
judge noted.
   Meka testified he was lured to an apartment and attacked by the
three women, who sprang from behind a shower curtain chanting
``redrum'' _ ``murder'' backwards _ and struck him with the ax.
   Ms. Lipsham and Ms. Barry could each have received a maximum
prison term of 20 years. Assistant District Attorney Mark Williams,
citing their cooperation, asked that they be sentenced to six to
eight years.
   At her trial, Ms. Kazuck testified she struck Meka with an ax
because he tried to sexually assault her. Ms. Lipsham and Ms. Barry
said that was untrue.
   All three women told police they had participated in satanism.
   Ms. Barry admitted luring Meka to an apartment she shared with
Ms. Lipsham so they could kill and dismember him and drain his
blood in a ceremony they called ``kacking.''
   Prosecutors said Ms. Kazuck believed she was Jack the Ripper's
mother and that the trio hoped to resurrect the 19th century
British serial killer.
   At least five prostitutes fell prey to the Ripper's knife in
London's seamy East End in 1888. Most were mutilated. The crimes
were never solved.
   Ms. Barry and Ms. Lipsham originally pleaded innocent by reason
of insanity. Psychiatrists found both competent to stand trial.

   French military aircraft evacuated 500
European women and children Friday from an oil center in Gabon
after two days of riots and the abduction of 11 foreigners.
   The evacuees, mostly French but including some Belgian, Dutch
and British, were escorted to the Port Gentil airport by French
soldiers. Some planned to stay in Libreville, the capital of this
African nation, and others flew to France on a special Air France
charter.
   The director of Shell Gabon, Andre-Dieudonne Berre, the
principal operator at Port Gentil, said, ``The rioters
systematically destroyed the infrastructure that we have invested
many years to create.''
   Asked about a threat by rioters to burn installations at the
oil-refining center, he said workers had reduced production to its
lowest possible level. It couldn't be shut completely without
risking damage to pipelines and other equipment.
   The violence broke out after the death of opposition leader
Joseph Rendjambe, secretary-general of the Gabon Progress Party.
   Opponents accuse President Omar Bongo's government of murdering
Rendjambe, whose body was found in a hotel room Wednesday. The
government Friday created a special commission to investigate the
death.
   Rendjambe's death triggered riots that resulted in the burning
of the French consulate in Port Gentil, and a hotel and theater in
Libreville on Wednesday. Many private businesses also were burned
or pillaged in rioting that continued into Thursday.
   The government newspaper reported two deaths. Hospital sources
said at least 17 people were injured.
   In addition, a French diplomat was taken hostage for several
hours. Later, opposition party members took 10 oil executives
hostage in Port Gentil _ eight Frenchmen, one Briton and a Gabon.
They were released after French troops arrived and held talks with
the dissidents.
   Friday morning, French troops patrolled the streets of Port
Gentil, 100 miles south of Libreville. The country gained
independence from France in 1960.
   In addition to the Europeans, there are a smaller number of
Americans who work for oil companies based in Port Gentil, on the
Atlantic coast.
   The government has been carrying out democratic reforms to
replace one-party rule. On Monday, the constitution was amended to
allow opposition parties to contest elections in September.

   Vic Tayback, known to millions of
television viewers as Mel the crusty diner owner on ``Alice,'' died
Friday of a heart attack, his agent said. The actor was 60.
   Tayback, who had a history of heart trouble, including triple
bypass surgery in 1983, died at home in his sleep at 1 a.m., said
his agent and friend of 20 years, Fred Amsel.
   Paramedics rushed Tayback to Glendale Adventist Hospital but
there was no chance of reviving him, he said.
   ``He just died in his sleep of a heart attack,'' Amsel said.
``He was just fine yesterday. He hadn't had any trouble since the
heart surgeries. But he was a smoker. In fact, he just told me he
quit smoking, again.''
   Tayback, who played loudmouth Mel Sharples for nine years,
appeared on several other TV series, including ``Star Trek,''
``Bonanza,'' ``The Rookies,'' ``Emergency'' and ``Barney Miller.''
He was also a regular on the 1973 series ``Griff'' and the 1975
series ``Khan.''
   On ``Alice,'' Tayback took a lot of kidding about his cooking
and it became a running gag on the CBS comedy series.
   ``If I walked into a restaurant the other diners would look
around and say, `I hope you're not cooking,''' Tayback joked in a
1985 interview.
   The actor had supporting roles in several motion pictures,
including ``Papillon,'' ``Bullitt'' and ``The Choirboys.'' His TV
movie credits included ``They Call it Murder,'' ``The Night the
City Screamed,'' ``The Jesse Owens Story'' and ``The Three Kings.''
   When the ``Alice'' series ended in 1985, Tayback returned to the
stage, starring in such plays as ``12 Angry Men'' and ``Death of a
Salesman.''
   His parents were born in Aleppo, Syria, but Tayback was born and
raised in the New York City borough of Brooklyn.
   ``I learned to speak the Syrian language but I left home when I
was 16. I'll never deny my heritage. I'm proud of it,'' Tayback
said in an interview.
   Tayback is survived by his wife Sheila; son Christopher; mother
Helen; sister Emily; and brother Joe. Funeral arrangements were
incomplete.
   ``I'm just devastated. I loved Vic very dearly and my heart goes
out to Sheila and Chris,'' actress Polly Holliday, who played the
waitress Flo on ``Alice,'' said from New York.
   Mass is to be said Tuesday evening at Incarnation Catholic
Church. Burial was set for Wednesday at Forest Lawn Memorial Park
in Glendale.

   Greenpeace protesters in inflatable boats Friday
tried to place an anti-nuclear warning on two British warships
visiting this Canadian city. As a result of their efforts, five
members of the international environmental group were arrested,
authorities said.
   Each was charged with operating a boat without a license, the
authorities said.
   The protesters tried to place their warning on the hulls of the
HMS Cumberland and HMS Glasgow before police boats surrounded them.
   The British warships are in Toronto on a 10-day visit that ends
Wednesday.
   Greenpeace spokesman Trudie Richards said the ships ``are
capable of carrying nuclear weapons, but we can't prove that they
are carrying them now.'' British naval officials refused comment.

   Colombian journalists under siege for
covering drug trade in their nation have won the 1990 Louis M.
Lyons Award for Conscience and Integrity in Journalism, Harvard
University's Nieman Foundation said Friday.
   The award cites Colombian reporters, living and dead, for their
work on the drug industry and its effect on that country.
   Luis Gabriel Cano, 67-year-old president of the newspaper El
Espectador of Bogota, will accepted the award. The paper has lost
staffers to death or exile and had its newsroom bombed in September.
   The Committee to Protect Journalists, a New York-based human
rights group, has documented the killing of 20 reporters and
editors in Colombia by agents of drug lords in the last five years.
   But Cano and other Colombian journalists estimate that 50 news
organization employees, including business employees, have been
killed.
   Among those murdered was Cano's brother, Guillermo Cano, El
Espectador editor in chief and a columnist.
   ``Mr. Cano has lost his brother and several of his associates to
the narco-mafia assassins, and recently suffered a major bombing to
the paper's installations which caused $2.5 million in damages,
seriously jeopardizing the paper,'' T. Roberto Eisenmann Jr.,
editor of La Prensa in Panama and a former Nieman fellow, wrote in
nominating Cano for the award.
   ``Yet Cano struggled on, realizing that if his newspaper fails
in its efforts, his country's institutions might crumble ... His
courage is especially inspiring for our profession.''
   A committee of the 21 members of the Nieman Fellow Class of 1990
chose the Colombians for the award, named in honor of former Nieman
curator Louis M. Lyons.
   The award carried an honorarium of $1,000. Cano will travel to
Cambridge come fall to accept the award on his Colombian
colleagues' behalf.

<HEAD>Hamburger Giant Says No To Irradiated Foods</HEAD>
<DATELINE>OAK BROOK, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   McDonald's Corp. on Friday declared that
it has not and will not buy or serve irradiated food products, to
applause from a food purity group and an order of Roman Catholic
nuns.
   McDonald's announced its ban on radiation-exposed foods at its
annual shareholders' meeting in this Chicago suburb.
   The fast-food giant also reaffirmed its policy of using only
locally produced and processed beef.
   ``We do not, have not and will not purchase beef from rain
forest or recently deforested rain forest land,'' McDonald's said
in a statement. ``This policy is strictly enforced and closely
monitored.''
   The statement on irradiated foods came in reponse to a
resolution filed last fall by a coalition of the company's
shareholders requesting a clarification of corporate policy on the
issue, said Christina Roessler of Food &amp; Water Inc., a New
York-based food purity group.
   The resolution was written by the Dominican Sisters of Adrian,
Mich., and the Dominican Sisters of the Sick Poor in Ossining, N.Y.
Both orders have holdings in McDonald's.
   ``This move reflects an important commitment to food safety and
to our consumers. McDonald's is the first restaurant to establish
this far-sighted policy,'' Sister Pat Day of the Dominican Sisters
said at the meeting.
   A number of food companies, including H.J. Heinz, Quaker Oats,
Ralston Purina and Borden Foods, announced this year they would not
use irradiation in making their products or buy irradiated foods or
ingredients, Roessler said.
   Irradiation, exposing foodstuffs _ especially meats _ to
radioisotopes such as cobalt 60 and cesium 137, has been proposed
as a food preservation method since at least the early 1960s.
   Proponents say the technique reduces the need for potentially
dangerous chemical preservatives, lowers refrigeration costs and
leaves no harmful radiation in the food.
   Opponents say it can leave trace radioactivity or harmful
residues in food.
   The Food and Drug Administration approved irradiation May 1 for
the treatment of commercially sold poultry.
   Last July, New York State passed legislation banning irradiated
foods there for two years. New Jersey passed similar legislation in
December, and Maine has enacted an indefinite ban on such products.

   With a rallying cry of ``Let the music
begin,'' the city celebrated its recovery from Hurricane Hugo with
the opening Friday of Spoleto Festival U.S.A.
   ``Let the music begin, the dancers dance, the choirs sing and
the children play,'' Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. proclaimed as
brightly colored balloons fell from the roof of City Hall and were
chased along a nearby street by young children.
   The opening also featured a brass fanfare and the singing of a
choir.
   ``I'm happy to see you here today. I never thought I would be,''
composer and festival founder Gian Carlo Menotti told about 1,500
people gathered under a warm sun outside City Hall for the midday
ceremonies.
   Menotti said when he saw the devastation from the Sept. 21
hurricane, he thought it would be two or three years before the
festival could be staged again.
   ``I was shocked,'' he said, adding the city looked like ``a
shipwreck'' in the aftermath of the storm.
   The roof of City Hall was ripped off during the hurricane but
has been repaired. The roof of St. Michaels Episcopal Church across
the street, though, still shows scars of the storm's fury.
   Hugo's 135 mph winds killed 29 people and left $5.9 billion
damage in South Caris wife and daughter receive bachelor's
degrees.
   Actress Joanne Woodward, who squeezed more than a decade of
study into her busy professional life to receive her degree, drew
applause from 285 graduates and more than 3,000 spectators when she
kissed her blue-eyed husband before them.
   Newman peppered his 20-minute speech with anecdotes about his
life and the creation of his salad dressing. He urged the crowd to
pay attention to the spirit of community.
   ``Community happens the instant two like-minded individuals
build something for someone else, address a grievance, take a
risk,'' he said.
   The actor said last year's pro-democracy demonstrations in China
and the tumbling of the Berlin Wall were examples of what can come
of belief in community.
   ``The best thing you can give yourself is the gift of
possibility and believing in the possibility of others,'' Newman
said.
   He urged the graduates to be ``the response, not the silence''
for the future.
   After daughter Clea Olivia Newman received her degree, Newman
stood from his chair on the stage and gave her a hug and a kiss.
   Two years ago, Lissy Newman, another daughter of the Newmans,
received her degree from the small liberal arts college in
Westchester County just north of New York.

   A woman accused of invading the home
of ``Cagney and Lacey'' star Sharon Gless and barricading herself
inside a bathroom for seven hours pleaded innocent to a felony
burglary charge.
   Joni Leigh Penn, 30, of Garden Grove entered her plea Thursday
before a Municipal Court judge who set trial for July 12. If
convicted, she could be sentenced to five years in prison.
   Penn, armed with a .22-caliber semiautomatic rifle and 500
rounds of ammunition, allegedly broke into the actress' Studio City
home on March 30. The actress wasn't home at the time.
   Authorities said Penn had been obsessed with the actress for
years. She had mailed hundreds of letters to Miss Gless, who
obtained a restraining order barring the woman from coming near her.
   Penn allegedly planned to commit suicide after sexually
assaulting Miss Gless, investigators said.
   During Penn's preliminary hearing, police Officer John P.
Anderson testified that she said, ``If I can't have her, nobody
can.''

<HEAD>Perpich Invites Gorbachev To Attend Ecumenical Service During

   Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has been
invited to attend an ecumenical service when he visits Minnesota,
Gov. Rudy Perpich said Thursday.
   The service will be on Sunday, June 3, at the Roman Catholic
Cathedral of St. Paul near the Capitol, Perpich said.
   ``We would like to see like an ecumenical service for peace and
friendship,'' Perpich told radio station WCCO-AM. ``We'll see if he
accepts ... It'll be very, very interesting.''
   The invitation was extended jointly by the governor and
Archbishop John Roach of the Minneapolis-St. Paul Archdiocese, said
Perpich spokesman Ray Bohn.
   State officials said they did not know when they would receive
an itinerary from Soviet officials.
   Gorbachev plans to make a six-hour stop in Minnesota after
concluding his Washington summit conference with President Bush. He
is scheduled to arrive at 1 p.m. and leave for California at 7 p.m.
   The tentative schedule includes a welcome luncheon at the
governor's mansion and a 5 p.m. meeting at a Minneapolis hotel with
a group of Midwest business and agricultural leaders. But Gorbachev
and his wife apparently plan considerable sightseeing while in the
Twin Cities.
   Perpich said Gorbachev's wife, Raisa, has asked to meet with a
typical American family, and that the Steven Watson family of
Minneapolis has been chosen.
   ``She really wanted to visit with a middle-class family in
Minnesota. ... The family that's selected has four children, and
for some reason, they (the Soviets) wanted a family that also has a
dog. I guess they ... wanted what they consider a typical American
family.''
   The Watsons' daughter, Lisa, 13, was part of a cultural exchange
program and visited the Soviet Union last year.

   A white parolee with a history of racial
hatred was charged Thursday with murder and attempted murder in a
shooting that left a young black man dead and his companion
paralyzed, authorities said.
   Daniel Amos Pilot, 21, of Theodore was arrested Wednesday while
driving to a construction job, said Mobile County Sheriff Tom
Purvis.
   District Judge Mike McMaken ordered Pilot held without bond on
murder and attempted murder charges in the killing of Darren
Jessie, 21, and the wounding of Joseph O'Cain, 17.
   McMaken said Pilot was in violation of his parole and that a
hearing on revoking his parole would be held later.
   The heavily tatooed suspect, his hands cuffed and his head
lowered, walked by reporters without making any comment.
   Jessie was shot to death March 31 while sitting in a car outside
a grocery in Theodore, a predominantly white suburb of Mobile.
O'Cain was shot in the back as he fled the car.
   Jessie's mother, Catherine McCants, had concluded the shooting
was racially motivated because her son was dating a white clerk at
the store.
   ``I'm glad they got him,'' she said Thursday. ``I feel more
comfortable now that they got somebody, but I'm still worried and
upset.''
   Purvis told a news conference that the investigation of the
shooting determined Pilot didn't know Jessie or his girlfriend and
that the interracial romance was not the motive. The sheriff said
Pilot's ``hatred for blacks'' appeared to be the motive, but
declined to elaborate.
   Pilot was paroled from a state prison March 12 after serving
four years of a 12-year sentence for receiving stolen property,
said state prisons spokeswoman Debbie Herbert.
   The sheriff would not say what words were spoken between the
gunman and the two victims, but said Jessie and O'Cain were
``innocent of any provocation or wrongdoing.''
   Another racially motivated killing rocked Mobile in 1981, when a
black 19-year-old, Michael Donald, was picked at random from a city
street and beaten to death. His body was hanged from a tree.
   Three Ku Klan Klan members are serving prison sentences for the
killing, which was recently made into a television movie by NBC.

<HEAD>Greyhound Bus Driven By Replacement Crashes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WAMSUTTER, Wyo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A Greyhound bus driven by a replacement
driver crashed Thursday, injuring eight passengers, authorities
said.
   The driver told investigators a tractor-trailer forced him off
the road, but at least three witnesses indicated he may have fallen
asleep at the wheel, said patrolman Steve Kelso of the highway
patrol.
   Investigators from the National Transportation and Safety Board
went to the scene.
   Greyhound has reported at least 30 incidents of violence against
the company, including shootings of buses, since its drivers began
a nationwide strike March 2.
   Kelso said the Greyhound bus carrying 46 passengers went off
Interstate 80 just east of Wamsutter early Thursday when it failed
to make a curve. The bus crossed the median and went into a
drainage ditch.
   All 46 passengers were taken to Carbon County Memorial Hospital
in Rawlins, and eight were being held for overnight observation and
treatment, Hospital Administrator Dick Mills said. All eight were
in stable condition, said Mills, who did not know the extent of
their injuries.
   The driver, 50-year-old Bobby Williamson of Chicago, was not
hurt.
   Kelso said Williamson told him a large truck had played
``highway tag,'' repeatedly passing the bus, then slowing to make
the bus pass until the bus was finally forced off the road.
   However, the patrolman said, there were reports from at least
three witnesses who were awake either during or immediately before
the accident that Williamson had been drowsy and was crossing lanes.
   Greyhound spokesman Bill Kula said the driver had fulfilled the
rest quota prescribed by the Department of Transportation before
getting behind the wheel in Cheyenne.
   ``The driver had had a 13-hour rest and break period which more
than met DOT requirements,'' Kula said. ``He had all the rest he
needed. It would not have impaired his driving ability in the
least.''
   George Gravely, another Greyhound spokesman, said the company
was investigating whether the bus was forced off the road.
   ``I don't want this to sound like we've lost confidence in the
driver or support everything he said. But typically, we will review
everything he says.''
   Williamson is a replacement driver who began driving for
Greyhound when members of the Amalgamated Transit Union went on
strike, Gravely said.

<TEXT>
   The French government on Thursday banned three
neo-Nazi magazines from West Germany, calling the publications
racist and anti-Semitic.
   The order follows the desecration of a Jewish cemetery two weeks
ago in southern France that prompted further desecrations, protests
from Jews and others and nationwide soul-searching about
anti-Semitism.
   In Thursday's order, Interior Secretary Pierre Joxe banned
distribution and sales of the three magazines, which are translated
into French for distribution to extreme-right groups. None of the
magazines have large circulations.
   However, Joxe said the works ``threaten the public order because
of their apologies for Nazism, racism and anti-Semitism.''
   His authority to ban them comes under a 1939 law controlling
foreign publications.
   France has been ungoing a wave of protests and recriminations
since a Jewish cemetery in Carpentras was desecrated two weeks ago.
A corpse was mutilated and 34 tombs desecrated, and the case
remains unsolved.
   Since then, similar incidents have been carried out in France,
Israel, Canada and elsewhere.
   In the latest French legal action, a court in Poissy, west of
Paris, charged a 26-year-old man with painting anti-Semitic
graffiti on the doors of a vocational school.
   The messages, discovered Tuesday, were aimed at the school's
Jewish director.
   On Wednesday, a judge in Saint Herblain freed under court
supervision three skinheads charged with profaning 90 graves at a
Catholic cemetery in the eastern French village.
   Mayor Charles Gautier denounced the decision by Judge Gilles
Dubigeon. In a letter Thursday to Prime Minister Michel Rocard, the
mayor said the three suspects should have been held in jail while
awaiting trial.
   In another development, extreme-right leader Jean-Marie Le Pen
on Thursday criticized a court decision to fine him for referring
to the Nazi gas chambers as ``a detail of World War II history.''
   In a statement by his National Front party, Le Pen criticized
Wednesday's ruling as political persecution and an infringement on
his free speech rights.
   The court in Nanterre, outside Paris, ordered Le Pen to pay 18
cents to each of 11 organizations that filed suit against him after
the remark in 1987.
   Judge Lefoyer de Costil said ``freedom of expression ... has a
limit.'' He also ordered Le Pen to pay $720 to each of the groups
to cover legal fees.
   ``This decision only takes into account the interpretations of
my political enemies and not at all the explanations I provided,''
Le Pen said. ``This irreversible judgment is proof of political
persecution against me.''
   The 61-year-old politician has been increasingly ostracized
since the desecration of the cemetery at Carpentras.
   Le Pen, a deputy in the European Parliament, wants to expel
immigrants from France and enact laws to keep them out. He denies
repeated accusations of being racist or anti-Semitic.

   After months of delay, $720 million in
emergency U.S. aid to the new democratic governments in Panama and
Nicaragua is finally ready to flow southward following final
approval by Congress.
   But the engine behind the bill was not the altruism of members
of Congress. Rather, it was nearly $4 in hometown spending for
every dollar in foreign aid contained in the money bill.
   When finally sent to President Bush early today, the measure had
swelled to more than $4 billion. It included programs that ranged
from filling in a collapsed utility tunnel on a street in
Salisbury, N.C., to giving the Samoan islands a $750,000 ferry boat.
   The measure did include $300 million to boost the struggling
government of Nicaraguan President Violeta Chamorro, and $420
million to help the new Panamanian democracy recover from U.S.
trade sanctions and last December's invasion.

   Members of Congress are trying to stop
President Bush from giving another year of trade benefits to China,
whose leaders they called butchers and pirates.
   Bush announced on Thursday he would extend most favored nation
trade status to China for an additional year, despite the
administration's unhappiness with Beijing's human rights policies
following the June 1989 massacre of pro-democracy demonstrators at
Tiananmen Square.
   This is the second time in a year the president has fought with
Congress over China. The last time, when the issue was how to
protect Chinese students studying in this country, Bush won a
narrow victory.
   The announcement touched off a firestorm on Capitol Hill, in
part because many lawmakers thought Bush might impose some
conditions on Beijing at the same time he approved trade benefits.

   President Bush's summit next week with Soviet
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev may mark the end of one era in
U.S.-Soviet relations and the beginning of another.
   The main business the two will conduct symbolizes the old era.
They will sign a declaration to reduce U.S. and Soviet strategic
nuclear weapons _ by much less than the 50 percent initially
advertised _ and probably commit themselves to pursue further
cutbacks.
   The declaration will make the May 31-June 3 summit, like the
majority of its predecessors, an arms control summit.
   At the same time, Bush and Gorbachev will begin the transition
to a new superpower relationship forced on them by a rapidly
changing world.

   A waning Soviet threat has prompted NATO to
slash war games nearly in half, replacing them with computer
simulations, and to slacken the response time of some forces, the
alliance's chief military commander says.
   ``People don't want big exercises because the looming threat of
an immediate war has lessened,'' U.S. Gen. John R. Galvin, the
supreme allied commander in Europe, said Thursday.
   ``We have cut down significantly on the amount of noise,
maneuver damage (and) general bother, and yet we have accomplished
our exercises to train to the standards that are required,'' he
said in an interview at his official residence in Mons, about 40
miles southwest of Brussels.
   That should come as good news to West Germans, who have
increasingly called for a cutback in NATO maneuvers on the ground
and in the air that have been prone to sometimes deadly mishaps.
Most of the exercises are held in West Germany.

   Manuel Noriega's defense lawyers, saying they were
betrayed by the U.S. attorney's office in a botched deal to pay
their fees, have threatened to reveal the details of the CIA's
secret payments to their client.
   A prosecution-sponsored proposal to have the government pay the
lawyers as much as $350 an hour fell apart Thursday when a federal
judge said he could find no legal basis for the arrangment.
Opponents had called it a ``legal slush fund'' for Noriega.
   As their part of the deal, Noriega's defense had agreed to
postpone a showdown over $11 million they say their client received
from the CIA and other intelligence agencies. That agreement is now
void, lead defense attorney Frank Rubino said after a hearing on
the issue.
   ``They couldn't take the heat that came out over this
agreement,'' Rubino said of the U.S. attorney's office. ``Now we
shall litigate every dime Gen. Noriega's been paid by this
government, and we shall litigate it as publicly as possible.''

   The two Democrats locked in a runoff for
the U.S. Senate nomination are going easy on each other and aiming
their fire instead at potential Republican opponent Sen. Jesse
Helms.
   Democrats Mike Easley and Harvey Gantt have carefully avoided
attacking each other during the first two weeks of the runoff
campaign. But they frequently jabbed at Helms.
   ``They have a lot of common supporters and it's hard to insult
people who are fairly close to you,'' said Thad Beyle, a political
science professor at the University of North Carolina at Chapel
Hill.
   Beyle characterized it as a ``gentlemanly'' runoff designed in
part to avoid alienating voters who could choose to sit out the
November general election.

   President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Friday warned
that the Soviet Union would review its policies on European arms
control and security negotiations if a reunited Germany joined NATO.
   Gorbachev's remarks contained the Kremlin's most dire warning
yet about what steps it would take if a reunited Germany joins the
Western military alliance.
   The Soviet Union wants Germany to belong to both NATO and the
Warsaw Pact. The Bush administration favors NATO membership for a
united Germany.
   Gorbachev said at a news conference that Western leaders seem to
assume a unified Germany would join the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization, and said Moscow was very wary of that prospect.

   A beleaguered Soviet premier appealed to consumers
Friday to stop their panic buying of food, triggered by his
announcement of plans for sharp price increases, and urged
lawmakers to quickly approve economic reforms.
   Opposition deputies in parliament demanded a no-confidence vote
aimed at bringing down Premier Nikolai I. Ryzhkov's government, but
he got one important voice of support for his program: from
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
   ``I'm hoping in the end, after all the debates _ and they won't
be simple _ we'll agree that we have to move toward a market. I'm
sure of this,'' Gorbachev said at a news conference.
   Ryzhkov's plan, broadcast on national television Thursday,
proposes tripling the price of bread and other flour-based products
on July 1 and increasing the prices of most other consumer goods in
January.

   President Bush began a pre-summit
vacation Friday pledging to sign as soon as possible a Panama and
Nicaragua aid package swollen by tens of millions of dollars worth
of pet projects for members of Congress.
   The measure provides $420 million for Panama, which is
rebuilding after U.S. economic sanctions and an invasion of
American forces last December to topple Manuel Antonio Noriega from
power.
   Nicaragua's new government, led by U.S.-backed President Violeta
Chamorro, will receive $300 million.
   Overall, the spending measure provides $4.4 billion in domestic
spending and foreign assistance. The administration's high priority
on winning aid for Panama and Nicaragua led Bush to swallow
pork-barrel spending added by Congress.

   The U.S. trade deficit shrank to $26.4 billion
from January through March, the smallest quarterly imbalance in
more than six years, the government reported Friday.
   The Commerce Department said the 8.2 percent improvement in the
trade balance was a result of record-high export sales that offset
the highest volume of foreign oil shipments in more than 12 years.
   The improving trade performance, if it continues, would be good
news for the U.S. economy. Over the past three years, rising
exports have accounted for more than one-third of total domestic
growth as American manufacturers enjoyed a boom in foreign sales.
   In other economic news Friday, the Commerce Department reported
that consumer spending shot up by 0.6 percent in April. However,
the National Association of Realtors reported that sales of
existing homes fell 2.1 percent in April.

   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat urged the U.N.
Security Council on Friday to send an emergency force to protect
Arabs in the Israeli-occupied territories from a ``war of
extermination.''
   Opening an emergency council session, Arafat called for an end
to Israel's 23-year-old occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip,
a ban on Jewish settlements in the territories, and international
sanctions against Israel.
   The violence ``has reached an extremely dangerous and explosive
point,'' the Palestine Liberation Organization chief said. He urged
appointment of a permanent U.N. envoy to monitor the situation; a
Security Council investigation into ``all crimes'' allegedly
committed by Israel against Palestinians; and immediate
preparations for an international Middle East peace conference.
   Initial responses from other delegates were largely
non-committal. France and the Soviet Union said the council should
consider a U.N. observer force. In Israel, a top aide to Prime
Minister Yitzhak Shamir said Arafat's speech was ``full of lies and
distortions.''

   Congressional findings ``cast grave doubt'' on
the Navy's official conclusion that a troubled sailor probably
caused the blast that killed 47 servicemen aboard the battleship
USS Iowa, lawmakers said Friday.
   The new investigation, by the General Accounting Office,
suggests the explosion may well have been an accident.
   Congress' report came one day after the Navy reopened its own
investigation, citing unexplained ignition of gunpowder in a test.
   The Navy, in a report last September, concluded that gunner's
mate Clayton Hartwig probably set off the April 19, 1989, explosion
by inserting a chemical detonator between bags of powder in one of
the warship's 16-inch guns.
   The service resumed testing after Congress sought advice from
scientists at the Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque,
N.M., who then conducted an independent analysis of the Navy's
initial findings.
   Sandia analysts said at a Senate hearing Friday they believed a
possible cause of the Iowa explosion was the unintentional
high-speed overramming of gunpowder bags in the barrel. The GAO
said forms of some of the chemical constituents of what the Navy
had theorized was an ignitor were ``either commonly used in the
turrets or are part of the maritime environment.''

   An Air Force fighter jet crashed into a
residential area in rural south Georgia on Friday, killing the
pilot and a housekeeper as it ignited two homes and hurled fiery
debris across a highway.
   It was the second time since November that a military jet
crashed in Georgia and killed civilians on the ground.
   Kathleen Guthrie, executive secretary at the Atkinson County
sheriff's department, confirmed the deaths, but identities were
unavailable. Ms. Guthrie said no one else was killed, although she
earlier had reported three deaths.
   The F-16A ``Fighting Falcon'' was on a training flight from
Moody Air Force Base near Valdosta _ about 40 miles away _ to Lake
George Weapons Range in Florida when it crashed. The pilot was the
only occupant, said base spokeswoman Dee Tait.
   One house and a mobile home were destroyed when the jet slammed

a.m., authorities said.
   At least four other homes, including the home of Curtis and Mary

Cherney was booked into city jail, and Bari was under guard at the

<TEXT>
   A magnificent chronicle of Josef Stalin, the
great and evil Soviet leader who built the 20th century's most
powerful communist state on the bodies of 20 million people, opens
tonight on PBS.
   His life and the totalitarian nation he devised from a backward,
19th century peasant kingdom are chillingly evoked in ``Stalin,'' a
three-part series co-produced by Boston's WGBH-TV and Britain's
Thames Television.
   Its executive producer is Phillip Whitehead, who won an Emmy in
1974 for ``The World at War,'' the BBC's landmark World War II
chronicle. He brings the same thoughtful research and production
values to Stalin's life..
   Rare, archival footage, some released by the Soviets for the
first time, is combined with interviews of gulag survivors,
bodyguards and living relatives of Stalin _ including his rarely
interviewed daughter, Svetlana Alliluyeva _ and his rivals Lenin,
Trotsky, Bukharin and Kirov.
   Even the series' graphics are powerful and effective, from the
compelling main title sequence to maps and ``mug shot'' layouts
that trace the rise of Stalin and the fall of his Politburo rivals.
   The first episode, ``Revolutionary,'' chronicles the obscure
origins of Iosif Vissarionovich Dzhugashvili, a poor boy from the
provinces who fled the seminary to become a revolutionary and took
the name Stalin, or steel.
   Young Stalin impressed Vladimir Lenin with his revolutionary
zeal and is inducted into the Central Committee of Lenin's
Bolshevik Party. There he eliminated his rivals until he becomes
the sole Soviet ruler in 1929.
   The second episode, ``Despot,'' relates how Stalin used state
terror to force central control of industry and collectivization of
agriculture, inducing a famine that killed 7 million people in 1932
and 1933.
   No footage of that famine survives, only still photos of
emaciated children and corpses, and newsreel film of the increased
grain exports Stalin ordered to obtain industrial machinery while
his own people starved.
   ``Despot'' for the first time implicates Stalin and his secret
police in the assassination of popular Leningrad party leader
Sergei Kirov, a rival whose death triggered the so-called Great
Purge of 1934-38, in which 20 million people were killed and 8
million imprisoned in labor camps.
   The episode also shows how Stalin used the propaganda machinery
to create his own cult of personality, which enshrined him as a
beloved uncle and teacher at the same time he was ordering mass
arrests and executions.
   The final episode, ``Generalissmo,'' covers Stalin's career as a
military leader who took the Baltic states in the ill-famed 1939
non-aggression pact with Nazi Germany and was utterly surprised
when Germany invaded in 1941.
   By the war's end, he had imposed communist regimes throughout
Eastern Europe, and relations with the West were rapidly
deteriorating. In 1953, he had just begun another purge when he was
stricken by a fatal cerebral hemorrhage.
   ``When he took Russia on, it only had wooden plows,'' says one
Soviet, ``and, when he left it, it was equipped with nuclear
weapons. At his death, Stalin left Russia one of the two most
powerful states of the modern world.''
   They say even in the gulag he was mourned.
   ``Stalin'' is the second excellent PBS documentary to emerge
from glasnost, Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's policy of openness
in Soviet society.
   The first was former New York Times correspondent Hedrick
Smith's superb look at contemporary Soviet society, ``Inside
Gorbachev's USSR.''
   Both documentaries complement each other and both, in their way,
are tributes to the indomitable character of the Soviet people, who
survived a monster like Stalin and are beginning to dismantle the
nightmare he created.

<HEAD>Ruben Blades Says Critics Won't Silence Him</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN WRIGHT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ruben Blades, a gadfly of Latin American
entertainment and politics, is speaking out again in a new cable
movie, and says his critics won't keep him quiet.
   ``If you criticize Fidel Castro, then the left won't buy your
records,'' he said. ``If you criticize Ronald Reagan, then the
right won't buy your records.''
   Blades wrote politically charged songs before beginning his
acting career. ``Tiburon,'' Spanish for ``shark,'' likens U.S.
policy in Latin America to a shark stalking the weak in the
Caribbean. In ``Muevete,'' or ``Change Yourself,'' he criticizes
social ills in Latin America, especially racism.
   Blades was interviewed on the Mexico City set of the HBO
production ``One Man's War,'' the story of dissident Dr. Joel
Filartiga's struggle for justice against the regime of former
Paraguayan President Alfredo Stroessner.
   The film, in which Blades plays the Filartiga family's lawyer,
is to be shown on Home Box Office next fall, but no air dates have
been set.
   Filartiga, who is portrayed by British actor Anthony Hopkins,
said the film ``shows that the criminal dictatorships in Latin
America must be confronted.''
   Filartiga's outspoken criticism of the Stroessner regime cost
him the life of his 17-year-old son Joelito, who was abducted,
beaten and tortured to death, allegedly at the hands of a police
death squad, on March 29, 1976.
   ``One Man's War'' depicts the physician's struggle to bring his
son's killer to justice.
   Filartiga, who continued to criticize the Stroessner
dictatorship even after he had been threatened, was asked on the
set why he didn't tone down his rhetoric.
   ``It would have been suicide,'' he replied. ``If I had quieted
myself, Stroessner would have killed me and nothing would have
happened. My only security was in denouncing him.''
   The presumed leader of the death squad, Asuncion police
Inspector-General Americo N. Pena-Irala, fled to the United States,
where he lived as an illegal alien.
   Filartiga filed a lawsuit in 1979 in U.S. federal court and won
a $375,000 award four years later, when Pena-Irala was deported to
Paraguay. Eventually, an appeals court boosted damages to $10.4
million.
   It was, as Filartiga's lawyer said at the time, ``the first time
judgment has been made in one country for torture in another.''
   Despite the award, Pena-Irala is free in Paraguay, and Filartiga
doesn't expect to collect a cent.
   Stroessner, driven from power last year, lives in exile in
neighboring Brazil.
   It is one of the sadder ironies of Latin America that Blades, a
Panamanian, Argentine actress Norma Aleandro and Brazilian director
Sergio Toledo each have felt the brunt of dictatorships in their
own homelands.
   Aleandro, best known for her role in ``The Official Story,''
about an adoptive mother's discovery of abuses by Argentina's
military dictatorship, had to flee that country with her family
after receiving death threats.
   Blades has close friends who were in danger from dictator Manuel
Antonio Noriega until his ouster by U.S. forces, and Toledo's
father was jailed for political differences with Brazil's military
rulers.
   Aleandro and Blades said they don't seek roles in politically
oriented films, but would not act in a film that justified
repression. ``I would never consciously align myself with what I
consider wrong,'' Aleandro said.
   ``I am not interested in working as an actor in propaganda
films. That I won't do,'' said Blades.
   Toledo said that viewers of the HBO movie will be able to
identify with the tragedy of the Filartiga family whether they have
lived under a repressive regime or not.
   ``Every time you go deep into the heart of the characters, I
think you can achieve a kind of universalization. What I hope is
that we can create an empathy between audience and characters,''
Toledo said.

<HEAD>Is The ``Credit Crunch'' Real or Imagined?</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Well, is there or is there not a credit crunch?
   The Federal Reserve, which should know, says more than half the
banks it surveyed recently said they have tightened lending
standards for small- and medium-size businesses.
   But the National Federation of Independent Business, which
insists it should know becs members more than
500,000 independent businesses, finds no evidence of credit
tightening nationally.
   In contrast, Sindlinger &amp; Co., which claims to have firsthand
information on the ause it claims abasis of about 1,000 telephone interviews
each
week throughout the year, says a ``credit crunch recession'' is
under way.
   Gail Fosler, chief economist of the Conference Board, which
keeps tabs on business and economic matters, disagrees. ``There is
no evidence of a credit crisis, managed or otherwise, brewing in
the financial system,'' she says.
   In that case, what should you make of an informal survey of 60
business people at a meeting of SBANE, the Small Business
Association of New England? Asked if a crunch existed, eight
replied no, four were unsure, 48 said yes.
   Or this statement by Martin Perlman, president of the National
Association of Home Builders:
   ``The results of the survey (1,142 buildert
experiencing more difficulties than others...''
   Neither, they say, does it means that ``credit conditions are
not somewhat more troublesome today than two or three months ago.''
   But for now, they conclude, what is called a credit crunch ``is
more smoke than fire, though the smoke is thick enough to warrant a
watchful eye.''

   Skyscrapers will provide the backdrop instead
of cornstalks when Mikhail S. Gorbachev follows the footsteps of an
earlier Soviet leader into America's heartland.
   Gorbachev's six-hour stop in Minneapolis on Sunday to meet with
captains of industry and agriculture promises to bear little
resemblance to Nikita Khrushchev's 1959 visit to an Iowa farm.
   ``If you want to go to a place in the Midwest that is different
than New York, and you want to go to a place that is not a Rust
Belt center but a place on the cutting edge, it could be that
Minnesota is the place,'' said Thomas Noonan, a Russian studies
professor at the University of Minnesota.
   Fourteen Fortune 500 companies are headquartered in the Twin
Cities area, more than in all but three other U.S. cities.
   One of those companies, Control Data Corp., has been such a
loyal trading partner with the Soviets that it once accepted
shotguns and rare books as payment for mainframe computers, said
Control Data spokesman Rick Berglund.
   Minnesota also is the base of one of the Soviet Union's biggest
trading partners in grain, giant Cargill Inc.
   As the home of many world-famous artists, composers,
playwrights, authors and musicians, plus two orchestras, two
museums and two theaters with international reputations, Minnesota
also has long cultivated its cultural image. The Twin Cities area
alone has more than 200 theater companies.
   ``Minnesota does represent an ideal American condition in so
many ways _ a hard-working and civic conscious population, high
standards of excellence in all endeavors, an openness to new ideas,
a sense of leadership,'' said Martin Friedman, director of the
Walker Art Center in Minneapolis.
   ``Minnesota is a national leader in the arts, a public
accustomed to quality _ open-minded, tolerant _ a public that
encourages invention,'' he said.
   Envelope magnate and best-selling author Harvey Mackay said
Gorbachev should find in Minnesota ``a sense of our good ol' work
ethic, strong individualism, that this is not just a visit to do
business with the Soviet Union to feather our nests.''
   ``You can't X-ray a person's bankbook here by looking at the cut
of their suit or the grille on their car,'' Mackay said.
   Much of what Minnesota is may not come as a surprise to Soviet
visitors because the state has been a leader in U.S.-Soviet
exchanges, said Liza Malott, program officer for the President's
U.S.-Soviet Exchange Initiative with the U.S. Information Agency.
   Exchange visits have involved Minnesota and Soviet artists,
actors, students, bicyclists, scuba divers and mushers.
   Minnesota and Soviet chemical dependency counselors discussed
cooperation on alcoholism rehabilitation research; the
International Diabetes Center in suburban Minneapolis is involved
in a cooperative venture to build a diabetes center in Moscow;
children's theater companies from Moscow and Minneapolis traded
performances; and a Minnesota-Soviet bicycle team is in the midst
of a Twin Cities-Soviet Union trek.
   Minneapolis-St. Paul has a sister-city relationship with
Novosibirsk, and Duluth is a sister city to Petrozavodsk.
   To stimulate more trade, Minnesota will open trade offices in
Moscow and Budapest this summer, said Richard Bohr, executive
director of the Minnesota Trade Office.
   William C. Norris, founder and chairman emeritus of Control
Data, said several Minnesota companies enjoy favored status in the
Soviet Union because they have demonstrated loyalty during rocky
political times.
   When the Soviet Union intervened in Afghanistan in 1979, for
example, Norris lobbied against the trade embargo imposed by former
President Carter.
   ``It was a mistake,'' Norris said of the embargo. ``We have so
much to gain by tapping into their economy.''
   Karin Berkholtz, a Latvian member of the Governor's Commission
on Eastern Europe, said there are up to 12,350 Ukrainians,
Latvians, Estonians and Lithuanians living in Minnesota, some of
whom plan to demonstrate while Gorbachev is in town.
   Others in the state, however, may be oblivious to the Soviet
leader's visit. In southwestern Minnesota, for example, farmers may
be preoccupied with the grasshopper plague. The insects devoured
whole fields last year and are expected to be worse this year.
   But dairy farmer Tom Hirsch of rural Sleepy Eye is enthusiastic
about the upcoming visit.
   ``It's a great idea,'' Hirsch said. ``We've got the wholesome
rural life, and I think he's interested in that. I think he's
really a headsy person to come to Minnesota.''
   Hirsch said Gorbachev's visit should help Minnesota farmers sell
their crops to the Soviets. ``I think it will have some positive
(effects) on the trade negotiations,'' he said.
   One of the few similarities in the Soviet visits to Iowa and
Minnesota will be the hype.
   In Iowa, armed guards and an unruly press corps of 300 shadowed
Khrushchev. In Minnesota, Gov. Rudy Perpich has proclaimed the
Gorbachev visit ``bigger than the Super Bowl,'' which the Twin
Cities will host in 1992.
   ``No one really knows yet how this will develop,'' said Peter
Zidek, a supercomputer consultant from Apple Valley. ``But it's big
and it will open a lot of eyes to the Twin Cities.''

<HEAD>German Interest High in Bush-Gorbachev Summit</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TERRENCE PETTY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Perhaps nowhere in Europe will there
be as much interest in this week's summit meeting between George
Bush and Mikhail Gorbachev as in the two Germanys _ East and West.
   With 380,000 Soviet troops stationed in East Germany and 250,000
U.S. troops in West Germany, the two nations that are about to
become one have the keenest interest in superpower negotiations to
drastically reduce foreign forces stationed on their soil.
   Along with the troops, some of the world's deadliest weapons are
kept on German soil: high-tech jet fighters; nuclear-tipped,
short-range rockets; and thousands of atomic artillery shells.
   U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III said earlier this
month that it was up to Germans to decide ``the internal aspects''
of unification. On troop levels, Baker said outsiders could become
involved in the discussions, but here, too, the Germans were in
charge of their future.
   The troop negotiations, being conducted in Vienna, Austria, by
NATO and the Warsaw Pact, have been flagging and will be one of the
prime topics when Bush and Gorbachev meet for four days in
Washington, beginning Thursday.
   Bush himself said last week that ``the talks haven't gone as far
or as fast as I would like to see. ... Maybe we can find some way
at the summit, or before the summit, to move CFE (the talks)
forward.''
   U.S. officials have said they feel Moscow is reluctant to
conclude a Conventional Forces in Europe treaty unless there are
assurances that the large West Germany army will not pose a threat
after unification.
   One U.S. official, who requested anonymity, said recently that
it would be difficult to complete a treaty this year because of the
German issue and also because of Soviet concerns about the
steadfastness of the East European allies.
   The day before Bush spoke, however, Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard A. Shevardnadze said after meeting with his West German
counterpart, Hans Dietrich Genscher, that Moscow ``advocates an
acceleration in the Vienna negotiations.''
   West German officials were quoted in Geneva, where the two men
met, as saying the U.S. perception of Soviet hesitancy on the
treaty might be a misunderstanding.
   Shevardnadze himself, asked if could confirm the purported
Soviet position on the German military, replied, ``No.''
   In December, the two superpowers agreed to slash their central
European forces to 195,000 each, with the United States allowed to
keep an additional 30,000 troops in Britain and southern Europe.
There are now 305,000 U.S. troops and an estimated 565,000 Soviet
troops in Europe.
   Looking toward the summit, Capt. Stefan Lang, a spokesman for
the West German Defense Ministry, commented recently, ``We hope
important signals in the direction of arms controls come out of the
summit, but what exactly they will be we don't know.''
   No one is more eager for major superpower cutbacks than the
Germans.
   West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government says it wants
the eventual complete removal of Soviet and U.S. short-range
nuclear weapons from German soil.
   ``We believe that the Lance (missile) and nuclear artillery have
lost most of their significance, and therefore there should be
thoughts about how these rockets can be negotiated away,'' Lang
told The Associated Press.
   He stressed, however, that the Lance missiles should be removed
only in negotiations, because ``the Soviets still have a huge
superiority in this area. This should occur in a balanced way.''
   An agreement to reduce conventional forces would open the way to
negotiations on the superpowers' nuclear arsenals in Europe.
   Washington and the other NATO allies have said they are ready
for talks with the Soviets on the short-range nuclear weapons, most
of which are based in Germany.
   But NATO has not taken a clear stand on negotiating the numbers
of these weapons down to zero.
   A feud could break out within NATO if attempts are made to
replace short-range nuclear weapons in West Germany with
air-launched rockets.
   ``I am warning against a new atomic arms race. New weapons are
not needed,'' Genscher said recently.
   The future of NATO, and of American troops in Europe, could
become a bone of contention as well.
   Some West German politicians, including Genscher, have warmed up
to the Soviets' idea of creating new ``European security
structures'' to take the place of NATO and the Warsaw Pact.
   But Washington and other NATO partners say they are vehemently
against replacing NATO.
   The Social Democrats, Kohl's main political rivals, have also
said NATO and the Warsaw Pact should be transformed into a new,
Europe-wide security arrangement.
   The Social Democrats are pressing NATO to make major changes
that would better reflect the rapid waning of the once-mighty,
Soviet-led Warsaw Pact.
   ``It would be very good if the Americans prepared the way for
this with constructive proposals (during the summit),'' Horst
Ehmke, disarmament expert for the Social Democrats, said.

   The recent downswing in interest rates isn't the
only development that has encouraged analysts as they follow
changes in the cost of borrowed money.
   A good many observers also have been heartened to see the
``yield curve,'' which tracks the differences between short- and
long-term interest rates, bending into a positive shape.
   Now that long-term interest-bearing investments carry yields
higher than their short-term competition, these analysts see
potential benefits for investors of many kinds.
   ``The historical record suggests that this is a reason to be
optimistic about the prospects for common stocks,'' says Mark
Stumpp, research director at PDI Strategies, a part of the
investment management affiliate of Prudential Insurance Company of
America.
   A ``normal'' yield curve is supposed to have a positive slope _
that is, show a gradual increase in yields as maturities increase
on debt securities of the same or comparable issuers.
   In theory at least, a long-term Treasury bond should yield more
than a short-term Treasury bill, because its owners expose
themselves to greater risks _ in particular, regarding inflation.
   Changes in the inflation rate don't have much time to affect the
purchasing power of the money an investor ties up in a Treasury
bill that has a life of only three or six months.
   In the case of a bond that won't come due for as long as 30
years, by contrast, inflation can have a devastating impact.
   A 30-year commitment involves a lot of other unknowns as well,
including such seemingly remote possibilities as the chance that
the credit standing of even a blue-chip borrower like the federal
government might diminish over time.
   When the yield curve flattens or inverts, as it did for much of
the past couple of years, it often is regarded as a symptom of
economic imbalance or uncertainty.
   As recently as six months ago, the yield curve for Treasury
securities was practically a level line, with yields hovering just
under 8 percent whether you were looking at a 90-day bill or a
30-year bond.
   Then, through the first four months of 1990, long-term interest
rates rose while short-term rates barely budged. That helped tilt
the yield curve to a positive slope that has persisted as rates
turned downward this month.
   Toward the end of last week, yields in the Treasury market
ranged upward from 7.92 percent for three-month bills to 8.11
percent for six-month bills and 8.15 percent for one-year bills.
   The longest-term bonds, meanwhile, were yielding 8.60 percent,
though between about seven-year and 30-year maturities the curve
was still flat.
   According to Stumpp, this offers considerable food for thought
for anyone with a stake in the future direction of the stock market.
   Over the last 30 years, he says, stocks have fared far better in
six-month periods after the yield curve in December or June had a
positive slope than they did in the relatively few comparable
periods when it was flat or inverted.
   Prices rose in more than three-quarters of the periods ushered
in by a curve with a positive slope, and fell almost two-thirds of
the time when they started out with a flat or inverted curve.
   As those calculations show, Stumpp acknowledges, the ``yield
curve indicator'' for stocks cannot be taken as infallible.
   ``Nevertheless,'' he concludes, ``judging by the historical
record of this indicator, stocks look better than they did late
last year.''

<HEAD>Bill Bradley: From Dollar Bill to Capitol Hill</HEAD>
<NOTE>With LaserPhoto</NOTE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   For a long time, he feared he'd be known as
``Sen. Bill Bradley, former New York Knick'' for the rest of his
life.
   The image of a man ``wearing short pants in drafty arenas''
didn't seem to enhance the credibility sought by New Jersey's young
senator when he arrived here in 1978.
   So the Rhodes scholar with a great baseline jumpshot
deliberately shunned the key.
   ``Dollar Bill'' _ a nickname he earned from his pro teammates
because of his frugal handling of his affairs _ set out to apply
his sense of discipline to mastery of parliamentary procedure. He
built support for tax reform, forging alliances until Congress
overhauled the tax system in 1986.
   He fought for the Superfund cleanup bill, child nutrition
programs, more Medicaid money for poor mothers and children, all
the while plunging himself into details of foreign policy, Third
World debt and international trade.
   ``The important thing is to get things done,'' he says.
   Twelve years after what he calls his divorce from basketball,
Bradley returns alone in the summers to a court near his mountain
home in Denville, N.J., to relax with his famous five-spot warmups
_ ``but not the jumpers, you understand,'' he says good-humoredly.
   ``The heart is willing, but the knees aren't,'' the former
Knicks forward laments.
   About all he puts them through in Washington these days are
sessions shooting hoops with his 13-year-old daughter, Theresa
Anne. Aides say the daughter he devotedly drops at school each
morning and cares for four days a week shows signs of catching up
with her father's legendary technique.
   Playing with her has helped him put basketball back into
perspective after several years in which he believed he could only
be taken seriously on Capitol Hill by pushing his NBA career firmly
into the past.
   ``Now I look back and I can think more easily about it; the fact
of the matter is that I like the game,'' says Bradley.
   The senator picks his 6-foot-5 frame up from his office chair
during an interview over coffee to point out reminders of what he's
mastered in his 46 years: a golden gavel for presiding 100 hours in
his first Senate session and photographs from his 1970 and 1973 NBA
championship victories with the New York Knicks.
   He takes equal pride in the gavel and the shot of him wrapped in
a bearhug around Willis Reed, triumphant after the Knicks' 1973
championship.
   Sports metaphors occasionally punctuate his conversation.
   ``In basketball and in politics, the only score that counts is
the one at the final buzzer,'' he says when asked about Republican
predictions that his opponent will do well to capture 38 percent of
the November vote.
   Bradley also says he'll serve out another six-year Senate term
to the buzzer, despite recurring speculation that he will seek the
presidency.
   His supporters take his word at face value.
   ``I believe that in his heart and his head, he believes he is
going to serve out his full term,'' says Harold Hodes, once chief
of staff to former New Jersey Gov. Brendan T. Byrne. But, he adds,
``between 1991 and 1992 a lot of things can happen.''
   Would waiting until 1996 hurt him? Are supporters pressuring him
to run?
   ``It's a very funny thing,'' Bradley responds. ``I assume that's
what people talk about sometimes, but that's not what they talk
about with me. I think people respect my sense of service. They
know that if they mention anything to me about that, that I will
say, `Look, my interest is New Jersey.'''
   Still, Bradley-watching has become a pastime within both parties.
   Roger Stone, a Republican consultant who helped elect Ronald
Reagan, says Bradley is conservative enough and independent enough
to appeal to GOP voters.
   ``Our party could nominate a Bill Bradley,'' Stone says. ``If
you look at his votes on Contra aid, defense issues, the MX
missile, the B-1 bomber, he looks at issues one-by-one.''
   And, looking at Bradley's command of 64 percent of the vote in
his last re-election bid, Stone adds: ``A lot of Republicans
obviously voted for him in 1984.''
   Bradley's fair-tax policies have appealed to even some of the
most conservative voices.
   ``He's not one of those Democrats who has never met a tax hike
he doesn't like,'' says Howard Phillips, chairman of the
Conservative Caucus.
   The most common negative that people on both sides say about
Bradley is he lacks charisma. The word comes up again and again,
along with references to improvements in his once-sleep-inducing
speeches.
   ``I think there isn't any Bradley charisma. But it's obvious
that he cares about people. It's obvious he listens,'' Stone says.
``On a one-on-one basis, he's easy to like.''
   Christine Todd Whitman, the GOP candidate who hopes to unseat
him in November, has criticized Bradley for endorsing proposed
campaign spending reform legislation when his own campaign kitty is
way above the $5.5 million limit that would apply in New Jersey.
   For his part, Bradley bemoans being forced to spend so much to
buy television time in the expensive New York and Philadelphia
media markets because New Jersey has none of its own.
   ``You end up being collectors for television,'' he says.
   But he says he needs to raise the money to fend off any possible
negative GOP campaign. The cautious nature is part of Bradley's
style.
   For the past two years he also has been playing in national
political circles, Hodes notes. He has spent countless hours
jetting to podiums around the country on behalf of campaigning
colleagues.
   ``Remember the early endorsement of Michael Dukakis, at a very
critical time for Dukakis; the decision to back Ron Brown for
Democratic National Committee chairman. New Jersey was a swing seat
for Brown and Bradley endorsed him,'' Hodes says.
   And at the same time, Bradley has quietly been learning about
issues outside New Jersey. For example, although New Jersey has a
strong agriculture industry, the senator made several visits to a
South Dakota wheat farm to study another region's farm problems.
   ``I went back over time,'' Bradley says. ``I have to physically
experience things; it's not enough for me to read the book.''

<HEAD>Civic Forum Led Revolution, But Has Many Election Challengers</HEAD>

   It won the ``velvet revolution,''
runs the government and smiles on every village from its happy-face
symbol, but Civic Forum has tough competition in the nation's first
free elections since 1946.
   Polls show it leading, but with less than a quarter of the total
vote. Civic Forum appears likely to lose to the Christian Democrats
in Slovakia, the more rural and Roman Catholic of the two
constituent republics.
   Campaigning began officially April 29, with rallies, posters on
practically every available surface and endless spots on radio and
television. Each of 23 parties fighting for seats in the federal
parliament and the Czech and Slovak legislatures gets four hours of
time.
   Czechoslovaks will vote Friday and Saturday.
   Few differences are evident among the parties. All reject the
communist past, including the Communists. All favor a market
economy and parliamentary democracy.
   Civic Forum's membership cuts across the political spectrum. It
claims to be neither left nor right and emphasizes its well-known
personalities, including President Vaclav Havel, experience, aninciples.
   Civic Forum's competition comes from a flock of new or remodeled
parties, chief among them the Christian Democrats, buoyed by recent
center-right victories in East Germany and Hungary.
   ``We shall win ... but I don`t know how big it will be,'' said
Jana Ryslinkova, a mathematician who speaks for Civic Forum. ``I
think it won't be less than 30 percent.''
   Havel, Civic Forum's biggest asset with voters, is officially
setting himself apart from organization he helped found, on grounds
his office requires impartiality.
   The immensely popular president does help indirectly by
participating in events organized by Civic Forum. He opened its
indoor-outdoor exhibit on recent Czechoslovak history, which draws
large crowds.
   Under a new proportional system, a party whose candidate list
gets 5 percent of the vote nationally is guaranteed representation
in Parliament. Up to six parties could qualify, forcing Civic Forum
to make a power-sharing arrangement.
   Parties variously describe themselves as right, center or
center-left, but the main distinctions involve economic control and
social benefits.
   Leftist parties such as the Communists, Socialists and Social
Democrats favor slower conversion to capitalism and some retention
of benefits. The Christian Democrats reject any degree of
socialism, empasizing their identification with ``Christian values
and tradition.''
   Some Civic Forum leaders want to retain elements of socialism.
   A survey last month by the state polling organization said Civic
Forum picked up strength in April, to 22 percent from 19 percent
the previous month. The Christian Democrats had 15 percent overall,
but led Civic Forum's partners in Slovakia 22 percent to 12 percent.
   In November, Civic Forum seemed to be the country's only
authentic political force. Its rallies attracted hundreds of
thousands of people and persuaded Communist leaders to step aside
peacefully.
   Since then, the government it dominates has improved
Czechoslovakia's image abroad, negotiated a deal for withdrawal of
Soviet military forces by June 1991 and erased myriad symbols of
the old order.
   Radical overhaul of the economy must wait until after the
election, however, in part because of divisions in the government
over how fast to go.
   Ms. Ryslinkova, the Civic Forum spokeswoman, said the edge goes
to Civic Forum over parties offering similar programs because
``what we have more than the other parties is the ... people able
to lead.''
   Hoping to overcome it is the Christian Democratic Alliance of
the People's Party, formerly allied with the Communists, the
Christian Democratic Party in in the Czech republic, and the
Christian Democratic Movement in Slovakia.
   The alliance has joined forces with associations of would-be
entrepreneurs and farmers and appeals to those with Christian
values, said Miroslav Bartos, a People's Party candidate and one of
the parliamentarians appointed in December to replace resigning
Communist deputies.
   Communist spokesman Josef Hora said his party, which ruled from
1948 until last year, might get 10 percent to 12 percent of the
vote. The party claims a membership of 900,000 in the population of
15.5 million.
   Hora complained that critics don't take the party's ``renewal''
seriously and still blame it for the repressions of the past.

<HEAD>Chocolate Company Survived Communism, Regained Old Name</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DRUSILLA MENAKER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The label on a chocolate box makes a
metaphor for the troubled tale of postwar Poland.
   ``Formerly E. Wedel,'' it says in large letters. In tiny print,
a footnote adds: ``22nd of July Confectionery Industry Works.''
   Three generations of Wedel family labor were erased by Communist
fiat in the postwar zeal to nationalize private industries. It took
four decades to figure out it was all a big mistake.
   Now that Poland is embracing capitalism once again, the 22nd of
July Confectionery Industry Works also will be ``formerly.'' The
new label is not expected to commemorate it.
   The chocolate company is to be one of the first five state
enterprises offered for sale to private investors as post-Communist
Poland tries to revitalize a crumbling economy.
   From the state-owned industries, private companies are to be
formed to flourish or fail without government subsidies.
   First for the auction block are those deemed to have the
greatest chance of success, and Wedel occupies a special place in
Poland as a prewar company that still means quality to consumers
otherwise awash in shoddy goods.
   When the means of production were liberated from the
capitalists, it is said the workers at Wedel ``spontaneously''
called for it to be renamed in honor of July 22, 1944, when a
Soviet-backed committee proclaimed itself the government of Poland.
   The candy-loving class and Wedel's foreign customers were not
impressed.
   As the Communist economy staggered through its last years,
apparatchicks in the confection section finally admitted the
blunder.
   The Wedel name went back on the packages, with the delicate
addition of ``formerly,'' and the official name became a postscript.
   This year, the national holiday was changed from July 22 to May
3, the date of a Polish constitution in 1791.
   Andrzej Karbowniczek, who runs the factory, said: ``Regardless
of political changes, we have never been ashamed of the example of
a man who achieved very good results'' in the chocolate business.
   That man was Jan Wedel, third-generation capitalist. His
grandfather, Karol Wedel, opened a Warsaw candy shop in 1851 and
the family's fortunes were sweetened by the second generation,
Emil, who sent his own son, Jan, to Paris and London for
instruction in chemistry and management.
   When Jan returned, the business expanded further. The Wedels
opened a Paris shop in 1937 and flew the candy to it in their own
airplane.
   Jan Wedel is remembered with reverence in Warsaw.
   ``The company was Wedel's `family','' the weekly Tygodnik
Solidarnosc said. ``He attended name days, birthdays, weddings;
granted loans, helped solve life's problems.''
   Wedel's factory was occupied by the Germans during World War II
and partially destroyed. Then, says a promotional booklet from the
mid-1980s, ``The liberation of Warsaw began ... the socialist
expansion of the factory.''
   One day in 1949, the company was nationalized by People's Poland
and no longer belonged to the Wedel family.
   ``People close to Mr. Wedel said he was most happy that the old
machinery was replaced by modern machines,'' said Karbowniczek, the
factory director.
   Happy to lose his family's legacy?
   Well, Karbowniczek said, Wedel ``was a clever man. He did not
intend to fight ... because he knew it was ... useless.''
   Tygodnik Solidarnosc said that Wedel was allowed to return as a
technical manager's assistant, but that the factory register shows
him leaving after less than a year due to ``poor health.''
   The newspaper suggested the real reason for his departure was
harassment by Communist Party operatives at the factory.
   Witnesses often saw Wedel sit for hours on a bench in the park
across the street, staring at the factory, the paper reported.
   In 1950, one Boleslaw W., identified as a candy wrapper, wrote
to the Communist Party daily Trybuna Ludu: ``It has been five years
since the factory has been reopened by the Polish Communist Party .
.. years of comrades' efforts to ... improve production and improve
working conditions. Production and the existence of the factory
itself have now nothing to do with the capitalist Wedel and owe
everything to the working class.
   ``Up to this moment, against logic, the factory has been working
under the old name Wedel. How can it be? How is it possible to
export under the capitalist's name? Our export production must be
our tool of propaganda ... of production of working people, without
capitalists.''
   The name 22nd of July _ 22 Lipca in Polish _ was adopted,
whether by ``spontaneous'' demand of workers or by the apparatus.
   Karbowniczek said the decision ``was not too fortunate. I had a
lot of problems with foreign trading partners who were asking who
that Mr. Lipca was.''
   There are said to be Wedel heirs, two nephews and the children
of Jan's last wife, but the management said none had inquired about
reclaiming the factory.
   Parliament is still drafting laws on selling state companies and
returning nationalized properties to former owners.
   With agreement in principle, first steps have been taken at such
major enterprises as the Gdansk shipyard where Solidarity was born
and the Universal foreign trade company, but complex mechanics have
yet to be resolved.
   What, for example, should be the balance between ownership by
Poles and foreigners and by investors and workers?
   How is the value of a company to be established when standard
Western accounting principles have never been applied?
   ``Bid low,'' was the advice of a Western businessman helping
organize the sales.
   The Wedel factory, which has about 3,000 employees, made sweets
last year valued at 126 billion zlotys, or $13.2 million. Roughly
20 percent of its production was exported, including the trademark
Wedel chocolate wafers in round blue-and-white boxes.
   ``Wedel is one of the first enterprises to be privatized because
we are one of the best,'' said Jozef Rutkowski, the factory's
financial manager. ``We belong to the group of enterprises that can
guarantee to their shareholders that their capital will be quickly
multiplied.''
   The company suffered with the decline of Poland's economy. In
1983, under martial law, there was not enough foreign currency to
buy raw materials and chocolate production ceased for the first
time in Wedel's history.
   Managers say the company has enjoyed relative financial health,
however, in part because of the loyalty of customers and employees.
   Karbowniczek, the manager, did not appear to grasp the irony of
a company outliving four decades of communism, because of quality
stemming from its capitalist founders, to become one of the best
candidates for return to private hands.
   He did see a parallel with Poland:
   ``It is like the history of our nation, because ... regardless
of whether it was private, a stock company or a state-owned
enterprise, it survived.''

   The man who captured the spirit of the 1989
pro-democracy movement by stopping a column of tanks has vanished.
   An Associated Press photograph and television pictures showed
the man, in a white shirt, standing defiantly before the tanks near
Tiananmen Square on June 5. The pictures appeared around the world
and became a symbol of the pro-democracy protests.
   Some Chinese sources believe it is almost certain the young man
was arrested and executed soon afterward. A London newspaper, the
Sunday Express, identified him last June as Wang Weilin, a
19-year-old student, and quoted Wang's friends as expressing fears
he was put to death.
   No other foreign news or human rights organization has been able
to identify the man or obtain hard evidence of what happened to
him. Some expressed doubts about the name Wang Weilin.
   After stopping the column, the man climbed onto the turret of
the lead tank and pleaded with the soldiers to turn back and stop
killing people. Ultimately, bystanders led him away and he
disappeared into the crowd.
   Communist Party chief Jiang Zemin said in an interview with ABC
television May 2 that the dramatic pictures illustrated the army's
forbearance.
   He said the pictures showed tank drivers would not run down a
citizen and proved the allegations of tanks crushing demonstrators
were lies.
   Jiang said he could not confirm whether the man was arrested.
When asked whether the young man had been executed, Jiang replied
in English: ``I think never, never killed.''

<HEAD>Moynihan Crusades To Build a Better Social Security Card</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Daniel Patrick Moynihan was 15 when he got his
Social Security card in 1943. He promptly lost it.
   ``It didn't look like anything worth keeping,'' the New York
senator recalled. ``It did not suggest its importance.''
   Moynihan, who chairs the Senate subcommittee on Social Security,
for more than a decade has been crusading to replace the paper card
with something more impressive and tamper-resistant.
   ``I think it a rather simple proposition that a plastic,
counterfeit-proof Social Security card would reduce fraud and
enhance public confidence in our Social Security system,'' he said
at a recent subcommittee hearing.
   ``We should have a durable, plastic card that people can carry
around in their wallets and feel that they have something, a card
that gives them a sense of membership in the Social Security
system.''
   That ``simple proposition,'' however, keeps bumping up against
longstanding fears that the Social Security card would become a
national ID card the government could use to keep track of people.
   Those concerns were born with the Social Security system itself
in the 1930s, when there were worries that the giant retirement
system would become a bureaucracy that had everyone's number and
knew all about them.
   As a result, the government designed Social Security cards ``to
be pulpy and wear out in six weeks or whatever and not give any
sense that the Third Reich was appearing in the United States,''
Moynihan said.
   A more enduring card would help instill confidence in Social
Security and reduce crimes based on false identities perpetuated
with counterfeit cards, according to Moynihan.
   But even now, when the use of Social Security numbers is widely
accepted for a variety of purposes, the government is wary of
making any changes that would suggest a national identification
system.
   ``The administration has always had fundamental concerns about
the possibility of the Social Security card and number becoming a
universal identifier in this country,'' Louis D. Enoff, the
agency's deputy commissioner of programs, said at a hearing of
Moynihan's subcommittee last month.
   The General Accounting Office, in a March report to Congress,
suggested that debate already may be largely moot.
   ``Many would argue that we already have an almost universal
identifier in the country _ the Social Security number,'' the GAO
said. It noted that a Social Security number is needed to report
income earned from work, to claim children 2 and older as
dependents for tax purposes, and to obtain driver's licenses in
many states.
   Moynihan thought he had succeeded in improving Social Security
cards in 1983, when Congress enacted legislation requiring the
government to come up with a new counterfeit-resistant card. But
the new cards, although more difficult to tamper with, look much
like the old ones and still are made of paper.
   His crusade is receiving renewed attention this year because it
has been linked with the issue of employment discrimination by
employers afraid of being punished for hiring illegal aliens.
   Under the nation's 4-year-old immigration law, workers can
establish their legal eligibility to work by presenting any one of
17 documents, including Social Security cards.
   The GAO's report said discrimination might be reduced by
simplifying the process for checking work eligibility, perhaps by
relying on a revised Social Security card or a driver's license
with a verified Social Security number.
   ``Using a single card would reduce employer confusion and make
it easier for employers to comply with the law's verification
requirements without discriminating,'' the agency said.
   But Enoff told the subcommittee that Social Security does not
need a better card and that there are less expensive ways to
address employment discrimination.
   Gene McNary, commissioner of the Immigration and Naturalization
Service, said immigration law prohibits the establishment of a
national identity card, but does allow the creation of an
``employment authorization document.''
   ``We have to work to find a way to produce the latter without
violating the restriction of the former,'' he told the subcommittee
last month.
   ``We don't want a card that is going to have to be carried, that
is going to cause people to feel they live under Big Brother.''
   The Justice Department's Andrew Strojny warned the panel that
designating any one card as a universal work authorization document
could create ``a major change in the relationship between the
government and its citizenry.''
   ``Had I been required to produce my Social Security card for
inspection when I was hired by the Department of Justice, I would
be unemployed today,'' he said. ``I lost my Social Security card
over 20 years ago.''

<BYLINE>By GENEVA COLLINS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Elizabeth Rose von Hohen kneaded and cut
thousands of Hungarian noodles over the decades following a recipe
that existed in her mind's eye and in her practiced hands.
   Her family, like families everywhere, nagged her for years to
write down the recipes before they were lost forever. She finally
did, and the result is ``Grandmother's Cookbook'' _ a folksy
compilation by Mrs. von Hohen and a granddaughter, Carrie J. Gamble.
   Mrs. von Hohen, 81, provides the recipes for Austrian-Hungarian
dishes she learned from her mother, while Ms. Gamble illustrates
the beginning of each chapter with watercolors of wildflowers her
grandmother treasured while growing up in rural Pennsylvania.
   Each wildflower elicits a remembrance. The wisteria that covered
an arbor over the driveway, for example: ``The big clusters of
purple flowers looked like bunches of grapes and were so fragrant.
They were always full of bees too. In fact we had a beehive in our
attic because of the wisteria. I remember our neighbor helped us
take it down one day and we got a washtub full of fragrant honey
from it.''
   Mrs. von Hohen, in a recent telephone interview from her home in
Hatboro, Pa., said she's mystified in the renewed interest in such
traditional favorites as cabbage noodles, liver dumplings,
``potatoe balls'' and jelly buns.
   ``Nowadays they put so many flavors together, and these are so
plain,'' she said.
   Ms. Gamble, in a phone interview from her home in Doylestown,
Pa., is not so modest in assessing her grandmother's cooking:
``Twenty years later people will remember a cake my grandmother
made.''
   Mrs. von Hohen grew up on a 42-acre farm in Bucks County that
she refers to as the Homestead in her book. She remembers that all
the cookies she made as a child were either round or half-moon
shapes, cut out using a glass because they had no cookie-cutters.
   ``We raised everything _ homemade butter, chickens. We didn't
have to skimp on what we cooked with. Things really tasted good
then. I don't think butter today has any taste,'' she said.
   When she was 16 she went to Philadelphia to cook for a wealthy
family and expanded her repertoire.
   ``When I first came to the city I couldn't eat the chicken
because I didn't think it had any taste, because I was used to
fresh-killed chicken. Or eggs either, I couldn't eat them because I
was used to fresh. On the farm we had an apple orchard and peach
orchard and you made your own jellies and preserves.''
   She quit her job three years later to get married, and began
cooking for her husband and his family. ``There were always a lot
of people to cook for,'' she said with a laugh.
   Mrs. von Hohen has three children, 11 grandchildren and two
great-grandchildren. Her husband died in 1985, and since then she
has lived alone in an apartment. Her cooking these days is confined
to meals for herself and Wednesday night suppers she prepares for
her one of her daughters and Ms. Gamble. She also cooks special
treats for holiday gatherings, like the poundcake and saffron bread
she made for Easter.
   Asked if any of her children or grandchildren are good cooks,
Mrs. von Hohen said all of her granddaughters were given copies of
the book and are trying out the recipes. ``They've had good luck
with them. Most of my granddaughters just got married,'' she said.
   Although she never used the term, Mrs. von Hohen's kind of
cooking is called comfort food these days. She doesn't own a
microwave or food processor _ ``those things are a pain'' _ and her
only concession to modernity is a hand mixer she uses when her
shoulder bothers her.
   Her recipes are written in a language that is usually clear if
somewhat untraditional. Instructions for one dish tell the reader
to cut bread into 1-inch squares and ``fluff the squares'' with
melted margarine.
   Mrs. von Hohen said her favorite recipe in the book is the
goulash. Here it is, verbatim:
   HUNGARIAN GOULASH&equals;
   Put 1 tablespoon oil in a pan. Finely slice 1 large onion and
fry in oil until golden brown. Add 1 teaspoon paprika. Stir it
around and add the meat. You can use chicken, beef or veal. Add a
piece of green pepper, a stalk of celery, a tomato (fresh or
canned), 1 bay leaf, and 2 cloves. Salt and pepper to taste. Steam
the meat until it draws juice. Then sprinkle 1 tablespoon of flour
on the meat. Add 1 or 2 cups of water and simmer until tender. This
usually takes about 2 hours. Add 1 or 2 diced potatoes for the last
{ hour. I like to serve this with rice, noodles, or bread dumplings.

<HEAD>States Urged to Set Better Standards for Board and Care Homes</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   States should set tougher standards for board
and care homes to ensure that elderly and disabled residents
receive proper care, a federal report recommends.
   Almost all states set board and care standards on personal care,
fire safety, sanitation and licensure, according to the report from
the inspector general's office at the Department of Health and
Human Services.
   However, only ``limited attention'' is given to the level of
care needed by residents, training and dealing with unlicensed
facilities, the report said.
   Board and care facilities offer residents room, meals, help with
activities of daily living and some degree of supervision. More
than 1 million elderly and disabled individuals live in such
facilities, the report said.
   Use of board and care homes has grown with the
deinstitutionalization of the mentally ill, the availability of
Supplemental Security Income benefits for the aged and disabled,
and a shortage of nursing home beds and other long-term care
services, the report said.
   It recommended that states improve their ability to identify
unlicensed facilities and to encourage board and care homes to
become licensed.
   It also recommended that states enforce their requirements with
sanctions such as fines, restrictions on new admissions and closing
homes. Procedures for handling complaints should be publicized so
that complaints reach the proper authorities, it said.
   As an outgrowth of abuses in board and care homes, Congress in
1976 enacted legislation requiring states to set standards assuring
that SSI recipients do not live in substandard facilities.
   The HHS study was based on interviews with federal and state
officials, board and care operators and advocates for residents,
visits to board and care homes, and an analysis of current
standards.
   Nearly half the state officials interviewed felt their states
assigned a low priority to board and care regulation, and a
majority felt the 1976 legislation could not be enforced.
   Nearly three-fourths of state officials and 80 percent of care
providers and advocates recommended a common set of national
minimum standards. These would include basic safety and service
requirements, ways to deal with unlicensed facilities, staff
training and requirements for different levels of care.

   Older people who speak loudly may not
be hard of hearing _ they may be responding to negative stereotypes
about them, a speech communication researcher says.
   ``Stereotypes sometimes include cranky, weak and ill,'' said
linguistics Professor Harry Hollien, founding director of the
University of Florida's Institute for Advanced Study of
Communication Processes.
   Older people who have trembling, breathy or jittery voices may
be negatively stereotyped as grouchy or frail, he said.
   Hollien published a study called ``Old Voices: What Do We Really
Know About Them?,'' and has categorized distinct voice
characteristics of different age groups.
   Aging reduces the number of sensory nerve endings, often causing
impairment of vision, hearing and reflexes, Hollien said.
   Hollien also found that voices of aging men and women become
similar after menopause.
   ``In pre-adolescent ages, boys' and girls' voices can hardly be
told apart,'' he said. ``After puberty, the characteristics go in
opposite directions and after menopause, they start to become alike
again.''
   Other vocal characteristics of the elderly include change in
vocal fry _ the lowest voice register in human frequency. As a
person ages, the vocal fry becomes lower, adding a ``rough,
jittering'' quality to the voice.
   Breathiness _ or air loss during talking _ also correlates with
aging, Hollien said.

<HEAD>Passing Wealth to Minors Takes Planning</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KEITH R. FEVURLY</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   In today's consumer-oriented society, most people
have possessions and, in some form or another, many people have
plans to pass their wealth to their children or other young
relatives.
   Whether at the prompting of a financial adviser to get some tax
savings by shifting income to another person or solely out of
generosity, many people begin transferring their property during
their lifetimes.
   However, when the recipient is legally a minor, a problem
arises: State property laws restrict minors from possessing,
owning, managing, selling or transferring property. In addition,
third parties often assume a greater risk dealing with minors
because children may disaffirm or renounce any contract they have
entered.
   The solution to these complications can take many forms: trust
arrangements, court-appointed guardianships or custodianships, and
even state-authorized means of transfer.
   All states have special laws that make it easier and legally
safer to make a gift to a minor. These laws primarily take two
forms: the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act, which has been adopted in
almost all states, or the Uniform Transfers to Minors Act, which at
last count was in place in 34 states.
   UGMA, which has been in effect since 1956, provides that an
adult donor may make a gift of securities, money or a life
insurance product to a minor by having it registered in the name
of, and delivering it to, an adult (either the donor or another
adult) or institution to hold as custodian for the minor.
   UTMA, a creation of the Uniform Law commissioners in 1983, is
much broader in its scope; it allows any kind of property _ real or
personal, tangible or intangible _ to be given as a custodial gift
and, unlike UGMA, also applies to such property transactions as
repayments of loans borrowed from minors and tranfers of property
from trusts, guardianships or estates.
   Under both forms, the minor acquires legal title to the property
gifted; the adult relinquishes all title.
   Under either act, after a gift is made, custodians generally
maintain the same powers over the transferred property that
unmarried adult owners already have. The custodian may invest,
manage or dispose of the gifted property on the minor's behalf, for
any purpose whatsoever, short of using the income from one property
to fulfill a legal obligation of support toward the child.
   When income produced by a custodial gift relieves an individual,
such as a parent, of a legal obligation to feed and clothe a child,
the law taxes that income to such an individual.
   Of course, grandparents or other family member donors, unless
they also have been appointed the child's legal guardian, need not
be concerned with this problem.
   Both acts provide for turning over the custodial property after
the child reaches a specified age. The UGMA legislation originally
established the time of the distribution as age 21; however, in
many states, this has been reduced, typically to 18. In some
states, the age at which the child is entitled to receive the
property can be extended by the donor, but in no event beyond age
21.
   UTMA sets the age for distribution of gifted property at age 21,
and at 18 or other state-specified age for property other than a
gift. One should consult individual state law regarding what age
applies.
   Overall, UGMA and UTMA transfers provide a simple, inexpensive
means to a desirable end. Both allow an adult to make a substantial
gift of property to a child without the child having to assume
control of the property while still a minor. In addition, the
parent or other relative may continue to monitor or manage the
growth of the transferred property while achieving his or own
personal financial planning goals.

<HEAD>Adventure Trips Alluring for Older Travelers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VOIT GILMORE</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Are you an older American looking for an
unparalleled travel experience to an unusual or exotic destination?
You're not alone. Adventure travel is increasingly popular with
everyone over 35.
   Those seeking a rigorous challenge are going trekking,
white-water rafting and cross-country skiing. Others want the
stimulation of an unusual setting but an itinerary that's not too
physically taxing, so they are choosing soft adventure, which might
include bicycling, hiking or nature walks.
   Several factors contribute to the surge in popularity of
adventure trips.
   Americans age 35 and older are in better shape today than ever
before. Increased emphasis on the desirability of a low-fat,
high-fiber diet, along with greater awareness of the benefits of
regular exercise, have produced more vigorous people living longer.
   More than that, being active and fit has become fashionable.
This has some wonderful side benefits: more healthy people with a
greater store of energy and vitality.
   It seems this rediscovered vitality has spawned a new sense of
adventure among middle-age to older Americans. People today are
looking for more unusual things to do in more and more
out-of-the-way places. In a way, it seems we have,000, is the county seat
of rural
Atkinson County. Moody Air Force Base is located about 40 miles
away.
   In November, a Navy jet crashed into an apartment complex north
of Atlanta and burst into flames, killing two residents of the
complex and seriously wounding the pilot. The fighter was trying to
land at Dobbins Air Force Base when it crashed in suburban Smyrna.
   Last May, a jet from Moody accidentally dropped a live,
500-pound bomb onto a rural area of Marion County in west Georgia.
Air Force officials said a worn-out, malfunctioning bomb rack
caused the F-16 to drop the projectile during an exercise.
   The bomb exploded in some trees, but no one was injured and no
major damage was reported.

<HEAD>Lawmakers Seek to Quadruple Alzheimer's Research Funding</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Legislation has been introduced in the House
and Senate to quadruple federal spending for research on
Alzheimer's disease and related disorders to more than $560 million
by 1993.
   ``Four million victims of Alzheimer's disease and related
disorders ... is a frightening figure for policymakers and the
American public to contemplate,'' said Rep. Edward Roybal,
D-Calif., chief House sponsor of the bill. ``Their numbers and
their plight must prompt Congress to reassess and greatly expand
its commitment to funding Alzheimer's assistance and research.''
   Roybal, chairman of the House Select Committee on Aging, said
the nation spends less than $1 on research for every $600 in
Alzheimer's-related costs to society. The nation spends four to 11
times as much for research on other major diseases such as cancer,
heart disease and AIDS, Roybal said.
   In addition to increasing research funding, the legislation
would provide $125 million to help states establish Alzheimer's
programs to help victims and their families.

<HEAD>Center for Black Aged Cites Six `Living Legacy' Honorees</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Six black Americans are being honored as
``living legacies'' by the National Caucus and Center on Black Aged.
   Their portraits were being hung in the ``living legacy gallery''
at the center's housing development for senior citizens in
Washington.
   The six are:
   _ Gorham L. BLack Jr., 67, of Harrisburg, Pa., cited for his
work as first secretary of the Pennsylvania Department of Aging and
regional director of the Department of Health, Education and
Welfare. He promoted legislation to reduce prescription and medical
service prices, strengthen fire and safety provisions for the
elderly and establish equal employment opportunities for minority
senior citizens.
   _ Eugene S. Callender, 63, of New York City, who promoted
significant changes in housing, education and employment for
minorities through his leadership as a Presbyterian minister, New
York City director of the ``New Cities in Schools'' program, New
York Urban League executive director and former director of the New
York State Office for the Aging.
   _ Clara McBride Hale, 90, of New York City, a foster parent
``surrogate mother,'' recognized by former President Reagan in his
1987 State of the Union address as a ``true American hero'' for her
work with drug-addicted infants. She takes in and cares for
children of unwed, working and drug-addicted mothers. Since 1969,
more than 600 infants have been cared for by Mother Hale and her
staff at Hale House Center for the Promotion of Human Potential.
   _ Dorothy Irene Height, 77, Washington, D.C., president of the
National Council of Negro Women Inc., who mobilized black women as
leaders in the struggle against chronic hunger, malnutrition, poor
housing, illiteracy, inferior eduation, health and other problems,
while providing 40,000 units of low-income housing and other career
education programs. She initiated annual Black Family Reunion
celebrations in major cities in 1987.
   _ Josephine Harreld Love, 75, of Detroit, cited as a gifted
concert pianist from age 11, who performed for audiences in the
United States and abroad while promoting cultural enrichment
programs for urban and inner-city areas through museums, libraries,
schools and colleges in Detroit and elsewhere. She founded a
non-profit fine arts museum for young people and organized
traveling exhibits of black artists, authors and designers.
   _ Mae Brown Phillips, 95, of New Carrollton, Md., credited with
starting the campaign for the District of Columbia Commission on
Aging, reduction of metro bus fares for senior citizens, and the
development of the first ``model cities'' senior center.
   The center was founded in 1970 and is a 3,000-member non-profit
organization that provides housing, employment training and
advocacy services for black senior citizens. Since 1979, 60 senior
citizens have received the ``living legacy'' awards. This year's
honorees were chosen from among 100 candidates.

<TEXT>
   More than 12 million Americans plan to
take a trip with a tour group in the next two years, and more than
80 percent of them are likely to be within North America, a study
found.
   The study found that group travel appeals to people who are
older, widowed and retired. Those who preferred group travel cited
value, convenience and safety as important factors.
   ``Gone are the stereotypes and the misconceptions of group tours
characterized by the old phrase, `If this is Tuesday, it must be
Belgium,''' said George C. Guenther, president of the National Tour
Association.
   The findings are based on a study of 18,400 households in the
United States administered by Longwoods International Inc., a
travel research firm.
   The National Tour Association has 3,700 members, and the
organization's non-profit arm, the National Tour Foundaton,
commissioned the study.
   Among the results:
   _ Eighty-three percent of escorted travelers stay in the United
States, Canada or Mexico.
   _ The top destinations are those of scenic beauty or cultural or
historic interest.

   You'll probably win the argument if you contend
that an out-of-control budget deficit is the reason why higher
taxes are being considered.
   Repeat it often enough and it sounds right, sort of like that
old sales trick of asking the customer to answer a series of simple
questions with an obvious ``yes'' answer, and then springing the
big one on him:
   ``And of course you do want this new life insurance policy,
don't you?''
   Same with the deficit: Many people accept the notion that it is
now more oppressive than it has been in years, and they'll even
give you the reasons, such as tax cuts in the Reagan administration
and slow revenue growth now.
   But the facts have little kinship with the belief. In relation
to the gross national product, a measure of the economy's size, the
deficit is now at a rate less than half what it was in 1983, when
it reached 6.3 percent.
   In that decade of the 1980s, during which so much attention was
paid to tax cutting, a series of undistinguished increases,
followed by a so-called major tax reform, doubled tax receipts to
more than $1 trillion a year.
   It is one of several prevalent beliefs that Rory Costello, for
one, would like to see put to bed. Costello, economic analyst at
Dean Witter, has a long list. It includes these:
   Inflation is continuing to rise; we're already in a recession;
housing is collapsing; and the United States must raise interest
rates in order to compete for capital. All exaggerations, he
suggests.
   Of these, the one most discussed of late seems to be the budget
deficit, in part because of President Bush softening his anti-tax
stand and stating his willingness to discuss the possibility of
raising revenues.
   Advocates of higher taxes often suggest the government is
revenue-starved, says political economist Daniel Mitchell, who
responds: ``In both nominal and inflation-adjusted dollars, taxes
are at the highest level in U.S. history.''
   Mitchell is a senior fellow at the Heritage Foundation, which
tends to make his opinion significant, since the foundation, a
conservative think tank, has enjoyed considerable influence in both
the Reagan and Bush administrations.
   The foundation maintains that member opinions do not necessarily
reflect its views, but that might be likened to the laundry saying
it isn't responsible for returning your clothes. The foundation
loudly promotes its members' views.
   Mitchell's view is this:
   The cause of the deficit is not a lack of revenue but runaway
government spending. To raise taxes now would mean a recession, and
consequently even lower revenues. To raise taxes would merely fuel
more spending.
   Moreover, he suggests there is a matter of political integrity,
stated thusly:
   ``President Bush repeatedly promised the American people that he
would not raise taxes. Candidate Bush correctly promised to veto
any tax increase. President Bush should follow through on that
commitment.''
   Mitchell states that even though annual tax revenues have
climbed $540 billion since 1980, the deficit is higher because of
the approximately $610 billion-plus increase in federal spending in
that period.
   His conclusion:
   ``George Bush has distinguished himself first and foremost by
his anti-tax hike policy. Now his credibility, integrity,
commitment to principles, and political and economic wisdom are put
to the test...
   ``If Bush expects to keep the support of the people who put him
in office, he must read their lips. They are saying: `Mr.
President, keep your promise. No new taxes.' ''

   President Bush's one-year extension of
preferential trading status to China assures it will remain a
leading buyer of key U.S. exports ranging from grain to lumber to
heavy machinery, business people say.
   They said the Bush decision announced Thursday also assures no
supply disruption or price jumps in important consumer imports from
China, including a wide array of clothes and shoes, toys and small
appliances.
   Bush rejected Congressional pressure to suspend China's
most-favored-nation status, which it has held for a decade and
entitles the country to low tariffs in selling goods to the United
States.
   Critics wanted Bush to scrap the status to punish China's
government for its crackdown on dissent, which began nearly a year
ago when troops attacked student protesters in Beijing. U.S.
businesses that rely on China trade said such punishment would hurt
the wrong people and invite certain retaliation.
   ``We felt that in the interest of keeping trade lines open and
allowing U.S. farm products to flow into China, it was critical
that this be extended,'' said Jack King, spokesman for the American
Farm Bureau Federation in Park Ridge, Ill. ``I think history has
shown that when we turn our back on foreign customers, there's
always another country willing to fill the need.''
   Steve Halloran, director of the grain department of the National
Farmers Organization in Corning, Iowa, said a Chinese withdrawal
from the U.S. wheat market likely would have depressed prices much
like the Soviet grain embargo did a decade ago, hurting farmers for
a problem they didn't cause.
   ``Anytime you interfere in trade relationships with political
mandates such as this, you're going to see a negative impact on the
prices,'' he said. ``Unfortunately, it's always a long climb back
up the price ladder.''
   One of the most ardent lobby groups that pressed for the
most-favored nation extension was the United States-China Business
Council, a coalition of companies with longstanding investment
commitments and operations in China.
   The council had argued MFN status was not a concession to China,
but rather the standard treatment the United States extends to
almost all its trading partners, including such countries as South
Africa, Iraq and Syria. The Soviet Union does not have MFN status.
   China has emerged as one of the most important U.S trading
partners since commercial relations first were established nearly
two decades ago. In that time, two-way trade has gone from near
zero to about $18 billion a year.
   The trade also has moved sharply in Beijing's favor, with
exports to the United States about double the level of U.S. sales
to China.
   Experts in U.S.-Chinese trade estimate that China now provides
one-third of the toys sold in this country, 10 percent of the
footwear and 15 percent of all imported clothing.
   It also is a leading buyer of U.S. wheat, purchasing more than
$1 billion worth last year or about 20 percent of total U.S.
exports to the country. American aircraft, machinery, lumber, and
high-quality cotton are other important products purchased by the
Chinese.
   ``We're very pleased that the president has decided to renew
MFN,'' said Jodi Levin, spokeswoman for the Toy Manufacturers of
America in New York, which had expressed strong concern about a
possible suspension. ``For industry and American consumers, and for
that matter, Chinese working in the factories overseas, this seems
to be a resolution that will make the most people happy.''
   Without MFN status, toys from China would be subject to a 70
percent tariff, vs. 6.8 percent now, U.S. Customs regulations show.
Tariffs on sweaters would have gone from 6 percent to 60 percent;
electric hair dryers from 3.9 percent to 35 percent; women's
trousers from 17.7 percent to 90 percent.

<HEAD>Scientists Say Blue Laser Process May Quadruple Optical Disk
Storage</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By E. SCOTT RECKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Researchers at IBM say they have found a new
way to produce blue laser light that could squeeze four times as
much information on computer optical disks.
   Moving the process from the lab to an end product is years away,
Michael Ross, a spokesman for International Business Machines
Corp., said Thursday.
   Nevertheless, analysts and manufacturers said IBM could reap big
profits if the process helps the optical storage industry, still in
its infancy, take its place beside magnetic disks and tape.
   Current optical disks use infrared diode lasers to make marks as
small in diameter as 0.8 microns. A micron is a millionth of a
meter.
   Scientists from IBM's Almaden Research Center in San Jose used a
quarter-inch-long potassium niobate crystal to convert infrared
light to blue laser light, which has half the wavelength.
   The blue laser can focus on a spot 0.4 microns in diameter, half
the diameter of a conventional laser. That potentially could permit
an optical disk to hold four times more information _ the
equivalent of perhaps 800 Bibles on a 5\-inch disk.
   William J. Kozlovsky, an IBM research staff member, and Wilfried
Lenth, manager of advanced lasers, told the Conference on Lasers
and Electro-Optics in Anaheim Thursday that the process was at
least five times more efficient than others at converting
electricity into blue light.
   ``It's almost the Holy Grail of the optical data storage
industry,'' said Bob Abraham of Freeman Associates Inc., Santa
Barbara-based consultants to data storage companies. ``It's been
long recognized that the wave length of the laser beam has been the
big limiting factor.''
   He said IBM had been researching optical disk technology for
years, although the company today produces only magnetic disks.
   ``It may be a few years yet before we see products,'' Abraham
said. ``But whether they choose to manufacture or license it
they're likely to be making a great deal of money.''
   Optical disks, which look much like CDs or the small storage
disks used in many PCs, can store enough data to replace whole tape
libraries of computer information. Optical storage is a more secure
way to store data than magnetic disks because it is much harder to
erase accidentally.
   One U.S. company that already makes optical disks, and would be
interested in licensing the rights if IBM's process becomes
practical, is Maxoptics, a division of San Jose-base Maxtor Corp.
   ``At this point it's a little early to tell how useful it's
going to be but it certainly appears the potential is there to
quadruple the information stored,'' said Joe Davis, Maxtor's vice
president of advanced product planning.
   ``We eagerly await more information so we can begin studying
it,'' Davis said.
   The storage capacity of both optical and magnetic disks has
reached stunning levels.
   Maxtor recently began shipping a 5\-inch optical disk that can
store the equivalent of 200 Bibles, Davis said. It also markets
what he said was the highest-capacity storage disk in the world, a
magnetic disk that can handle the equivalent of 400 Bibles.
   Davis said that even if the improved optical disk pans out, it's
far too early to write off magnetic disks, particularly when
information needs to be erased or written over. The storage
capacity of magnetic disks, also known as Winchester disks, is now
about 100 times greater than 10 years ago, he noted.
   ``Let's suppose it does work out as they say,'' Davis said.
``This breakthrough took several years. Contrast that with
Winchester technology, where every two years you seem to double the
capacity.''

<HEAD>Credibility the Key Question as Boesky Leaves the Witness Stand</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL ARABAS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Ivan Boesky survived two days of hostile
questioning on the witness stand, but it remains to be seen if the
same can be said for his credibility.
   In a third day of testimony Thursday, the former speculator said
he was able to write off on his income taxes half of the $100
million penalty he paid to settle the biggest insider trading case
in Wall Street history.
   He also said his wrongdoing didn't end with his guilty plea. He
admitted violating prison rules by paying other inmates to do his
laundry.
   Boesky gave his first public testimony about his crimes at the
securities fraud trial of his former friend and associate, John A.
Mulheren Jr. He is the prime witness for the government, which
alleges Mulheren broke the law to help Boesky cheat on his taxes
and evade federal securities laws.
   In two days of heated cross examination, defense attorney Thomas
P. Puccio tried to destroy Boesky's credibility by portraying him
as a greedy liar who had turned on a former friend to save his own
skin.
   ``I think we accomplished what we wanted to accomplish with Mr.
Boesky,'' Puccio said at the end of the day.
   Mulheren and Boesky were once close friends when Mulheren was an
arbitrager at Jamie Securities. But the relationship soured when
Boesky fingered Mulheren and other alleged co-conspirators as part
of his plea bargain, under which Boesky pleaded guilty to one
conspiracy charge, spent two years in prison and paid $100 million
to the government.
   On Thursday, Boesky revealed that he had deducted $50 million of
the penalty from his 1986 income taxes. That amount had been a
repayment of the illegal profits he reaped from insider trading in
1985. The other half of the penalty was a fine.
   Boesky lawyer Charles Davidow said he did not know whether the
deduction _ taken as a capital expense _ was legal, but he assumed
Boesky's tax attorneys or accountants had reviewed it at the time.
   U.S. District Judge Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum allowed defense
attorneys to discuss the deduction to attempt to show that the
penalty was not as painful or expensive as it appeared.
   Although confirming the deduction, Boesky said he could not
remember exactly how much he made in illegal profits in 1985.
Puccio claimed illegal profits based on insider information from
investment bankers Dennis Levine and Martin Siegel actually totaled
$187 million.
   Boesky again was temperamental under cross examination, refusing
to answer numerous questions unless he saw documentation to refresh
his memory.
   Puccio asked him a dozen times whether he has revealed to the
government all of the crimes he ever committed. Boesky said he
revealed all the crimes he was required to tell under the plea
bargain.
   He said his net worth fell from at least $100 million in 1986 to
nearly nothing when he was sentenced in late 1987, but he would not
say whether he transferred his funds to his wife, as Puccio
suggested.
   ``I do not recally any financial activities of 1986,'' he said
repeatedly.
   He deflected Puccio's accusations that he was greedy, saying
that in 1986, in the midst of his downfall, his holdings weighed on
his mind ``less than you might think.''
   He also denied committing any wrongdoing with his money to avoid
having to pay $1 billion in damages to parties that have sued him.
Boesky said none of those lawsuits has been settled.
   Boesky did admit one violation in response to Puccio's question
about whether he broke the law while in prison. Boesky said he
violated a rule by paying someone else to do his laundry.
   ``There were a couple of chaps who did laundry there and I gave
them a few quarters to do my laundry,'' he said.
   Boesky's testimony under cross examination only grazed over the
charges against Mulheren.
   The government alleges Mulheren manipulated the price of Gulf &amp;
Western Inc. stock for Boesky's benefit and held stock in Unocal
Corp. for Boesky so the arbitrager could cheat on his taxes.
   Boesky implicated Mulheren on those charges earlier in the week
under direct examination by Assistant U.S. Attorney E. Scott
Gilbert.
   Mulheren faces 41 charges of conspiracy, securities fraud, mail
fraud and record-keeping violations.
   The trial resumes Tuesday with Boesky's chief trader, Michael
Davidoff, on the stand. He testified briefly Thursday afternoon,
saying he had met Mulheren 10 or 15 years ago and had both a
business and social relationship with him.

<HEAD>Experts: Credit Crunch Easing, But N.E. Economy Will Remain
Sluggish</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN DIAMOND</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   New England's economy is in for another 18
months of sluggish growth even though the region's credit crunch
may be easing, a panel of experts said.
   Legislators, economists and bankers gathered at a symposium on
the tightened credit market in the Northeast agreed the worst may
be over.
   Federal regulators have largely completed their intensive review
of real estate lending in the region and the slowdown in lending
caused by that review appears to be diminishing, the participants
said.
   But Wayne Ayers, chief economist of the Bank of Boston, said
Thursday the end of the crunch does not mean that credit will
automatically begin to flow freely again.
   ``The economy in New England has been, and I think will continue
to be pretty soft for the next 18 months,'' Ayers said.
   High wages and housing prices are discouraging businesses from
moving into New England, Ayers said. And commercial and residential
construction, fed by the boom years of the 1980s, has far outpaced
demand leading to a severe contraction of that industry.
   ``The New England economy has yet to bottom,'' Ayers said.
``There are no `sleeping beauty' industries out there that can
realistically be expected to rejuvenate the region's economy.''
   The symposium was called to address the extent to which
stepped-up federal regulation in New England may be accelerating
the region's economic slide.
   That question remained unsettled, but participants agreed that
recent moves by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the
Federal Reserve and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. have eased
the concerns of bankers.
   Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., a member of the House Banking
Committee, said a meeting two weeks ago between the heads of those
three federal regulatory agencies and the American Bankers
Association was a key step in easing fears of a regulatory clamp on
lending.
   In that meeting, the Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan
Greenspan along with the comptroller and the head of the FDIC urged
bankers to continue making loans to credit-worthy customers.
   ``I can't remember the last time the three top regulators
thought it important to tell bankers to lend money. That was at
least implicit acknowledgement that things were too tight,'' Frank
said. ``The Secretary of Commerce does not meet with Iacocca, Smith
and whoever runs Ford and say `Gee, I think you guys should sell
cars.'''
   Frank Maguire, Deputy Comptroller of the Currency, said the
major purpose of that meeting was to thwart what the OCC viewed as
an overreaction by bankers to regulators.
   Frank disagreed, saying there was strong evidence indicating
that the OCC was being overly strict in ordering New England banks
to reclassify loans as ``non-performing.'' That step forces banks
to add more money to their loan loss reserves, money that might
otherwise be loaned.
   Regardless of who was at fault for the credit crunch, there was
little doubt among the panelists that it had some downward impact
on the economy.
   In Connecticut, more than 80 percent of the 2,000 businesses
that responded to a survey sensed a shortage of available credit,
according to John Rathgeber, vice president of the Connecticut
Business &amp; Industry Association.
   More than 60 percent of those responding, Rathgeber said,
reported that they were unable to get credit on the same terms they
had always enjoyed. The problem was concentrated in the working
capital area, money loaned to help businesses maintain day-to-day
operations.
   ``The unavailability of working capital has tremendous spinoff
effects on the economy,'' Rathgeber said. ``For Connecticut's
economy and for New England's economy, we need access to credit
markets.''

<HEAD>Nation's Executives Can't Get to the Point on Paper, Consultant
Says</HEAD>

   Top corporate executives spend nearly three
months a year writing letters, memos and reports but waste much of
the time because they can't get to the point, according to a recent
survey.
   Motivational Systems of West Orange, which provides business
writing and management training programs to corporations and
government agencies, said a survey of 200 corporate vice presidents
found few knew how to write effectively.
   ``It's incredible how much time people spend on the rewriting of
communication,'' said Roger Flax, president of Motivational
Systems. ``It's costing America billions of dollars.''
   Flax said much of the writing he's seen in 20 years as an
instructor is too wordy, poorly organized or confusing.
   ``We have found that people have what we call `blue book'
disease,'' he said, referring to the blue-cover examination
booklets that high schools and colleges use to administer tests.
   ``What managers and executives do is they write to fill up a
report and they're not concise,'' he said.
   Business writers should try to limit sentences to 15 words and
paragraphs to four lines, and avoid cliches, Flax said.
   ``The problem is in the schools. Schools are not teaching
conciseness,'' he said. ``The kids are getting so hung up on
grammar that they can't put their thoughts on paper.''
   Howard Carroll, a spokesman for the National Education
Association in Washington, said blaming teachers for bad executive
writing was ``ludicrous.''
   ``Writing is not easy for anyone. I think depending on what
standards we're talking about, you'll find most professional people
do not write well,'' he said.
   Christine Kelly, a professor of management communications at New
York University's Graduate School of Business Administration, said
writing difficulties usually reflect more basic problems.
   ``The problem the survey seems to be responding to is more
fundamental than that. It's the ability to express yourself,'' said
Ms. Kelly, who also is director of the management communications
department.
   Most of the students who apply to the business school have had
at least five years of professional experience, she said, but their
admissions essays reveal a lack of confidence in their writing.
   ``They've been told at work that they're too verbose,'' she
said. ``What I see in the writing is not well developed ideas,
which tells me they have problems expressing what they're
thinking.''
   Ms. Kelly said writers should worry about getting their thoughts
on paper _ the nipping and tucking can be saved for later.
   ``Writing is a craft and a skill and it can be developed,'' she
said. ``The underlying problem is that you first have to get your
ideas down. You have to be able to write freely and comfortably.''
   Flax, who earned a bachelor's degree in psychology from the
University of Maryland, said poor writing in the workplace leads to
lost productivity and sales, low morale and job insecurity.
   He suggests one way to write better is to write as you would
speak.
   ``Conversational writing leads to more credibility and more
conciseness,'' he said.
   ``Another point is they should really proofread aloud. If they
proofread aloud they'll hear their mistakes,'' he said.
   If the thought of reading aloud is unsettling, Flax suggests a
ruse. ``Pick up the phone and proofread to yourself.''

<HEAD>Essential Oils Exports Reach Record High</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: also on general news wires.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By BECKY GOMEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>

   Exports of essential oils _ the kind that
smell and taste good _ rose to an all-time high last year, says the
Agriculture Department.
   Last year's exports of essential oils reached nearly $144
million _ a 17 percent increase over a year earlier and well above
1987 exports of $114 million, according to an annual report.
   Essential oils are obtained from natural raw materials by
distillation or through a mechanical pressing process. The oils are
widely used in perfumes, cosmetics and pharmaceutical products, and
to flavor food and soft drinks.
   ``As income levels in foreign countries increase, certainly the
markets there will have an increase of these export items,'' says
Rex Dull of the deparment's Horticultural and Tropical Products
Division. ``Countries are utilizing more of them in their
confectionary products, and markets for them are growing rapidly in
these countries.''
   In fact, exports of peppermint oils increased by 22 percent to
1,510 tons, with Japan replacing the United Kingdom as this
countries largest export market for these oils. U.S. exports of
orange oil were up 61 percent, nearly doubling in value to $10.2
million. Lemon exports also doubled year-earlier levels, largely
reflecting increased sales to Japan and the United Kingdom.
   While exports of most essential oils increased, U.S. imports of
the same products fell 12 percent from 1988 to $132 million. The
decline largely reflecting smaller imports of sandalwood, vetiver,
nutmeg, geranium and cassia oils, and good crop yields by U.S.
farmers.
   Peppermint yields in Midwest producing areas were well above the
drought-damaged levels in 1988 and prices have fallen accordingly.
But demand for peppermint oil continues strong, which has kept
prices from falling further, despite the large 1989 harvest and
prospects of another good outturn this year.
   Reversing a trend dating back to the 1960's, consumers now favor
natural flavorings over synthetic ingredients. Dull, in a telephone
interview Thursday, attributed this trend to the changing health
habits of consumers.
   ``In recent years, people have become more health conscious and
want to move toward consuming more natural flavored products,'' he
said. ``People are afraid of what artificial flavoring will do to
their bodies.''
   Industry studies estimate that natural flavors now comprise
three-fourths of the U.S. market and artificial flavors the
balance, whereas the reverse was true in the 1960's.

   Gather up the chickens, cows and corns for the
Agriculture Department's first livestock and crop census next month.
   The department's National Agricultural Statistics Service will
conduct the survey June 1-15 to assess 1990 crop and livestock
production and inventories.
   Information provided by a sample of about 130,000 farmers and
ranchers nationwide will be used in making state, regional and
national estimates.
   ``Gathering this type of information from producers is the only
way to develop reliable crop and livestock estimates for an orderly
marketing system,'' says Rich Allen, Agricultural Statistics Board
chairman.
   ``The estimates are a working tool to help farmers and ranchers
in their decisions about production, marketing and investments in
their operations,'' he said.

   Mushroom growers have new hope in fighting
their worst enemy _ flies.
   A new natural organism might be the weapon to eliminate mushroom
flies that threaten the $500 million-a-year mushroom industry,
according to two Agriculture Department scientists. They say the
organism would allow growers to avoid using insecticides to
eliminate the pests.
   Mushroom flies breed so quickly in mushroom beds that their
increasing population usually requires growers to use insecticides
to save the crops. If not, the flies lay their eggs in the compost
that growers feed to mushrooms. Then, the hatched fly larvae eat
the mushrooms.
   But the scientists say the organism Steinernematid nematodes,
added to the mushroom bedding, burrow down into the compost. There,
these microscopic, whip-like organisms devour fly larvae.
   ``Right now, we can achieve 85 percent control of the flies by
adding 600 Steinernematids per square centimeter of compost (about
4,000 per square inch),'' says William Nickle, of the department's
Agricultural Research Service.

<HEAD>House To Consider Soybean Subsidies And Sugar Prices In 1990 Farm
Bill</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: also on general news wires.</NOTE>

   A boost for soybeans and revisions in the
government's sugar price protection program will be among the
provisions in the 1990 farm bill going before the House.
   The House Agriculture Committee approved a section of its bill
Thursday that put soybeans in a government subsidy program designed
to cost taxpayers nothing.
   The panel also voted for some changes in the sugar program that
drew praise from producers and criticism from the manufacturers of
candy and other sweets.
   ``The House bill addresses the complex U.S. sugar program in a
manner that will benefit consumers, producers and foreign quota
holders,'' said Luther Markwart, chairman of the American Sugar
Alliance.
   Thomas Hammer, president of the Sweetener Users Association,
called the committee's plan ``more outrageous than the current
domestic sugar subsidy program'' that he said hurts consumers.
   The government regulates prices by limiting the amount of
imported sugar that can be sold in the United States. The
manufacturers of sweets say that drives prices up. Sugar cane,
sugar beet and corn sweetener producers say it stabilizes prices.
   The House bill would:
   _Maintain the current 18 cent loan rate, with discretionary
authority to increase it based on cost of production or other
factors;
   _Extend the term of the loan from six to nine months;
   _Guarantee a minimum import level of 1.25 million tons;
   _Provide for triggered mandatory domestic marketing allocations
for cane and beet sugar to guarantee minimum imports if it looks
like they're falling below 1.25 million tons;
   _Limit marketing of crystalline fructose to 200,000 tons when
marketing allocations are in effect;
   _Create a re-export program that would allow poor
sugar-producing countries like those in the Caribbean and Central
America to sell U.S. refiners raw cane at 7 cents over the world
market level, thus enabling refiners to sell the sugar on the world
market;
   _Make disaster payments to Louisiana sugar producers whose 1990
crop is severely damaged by the 1989 freeze.
   The committee's plan for soybeans is an effort to boost
production without costing the government any money.
   ``It gets the soybean producer into the program in a way that
provides him with an insurance policy on his price,'' said Rep. Dan
Glickman, D-Kan., chairman of the subcommittee on wheat, soybeans
and feed grains.
   ``It's not all the oilseed community may have wanted, but it's
more than they could have expected,'' said Rep. Fred Grandy, R-Iowa.
   Congressional economists say the plan won't cost the government
because the loan rate of $5.25 to $5.51 a bushel is below the
predicted market price in every year of the five years covered by
the bill.
   The government only bears a financial loss if it loans more
money or guarantees higher prices than farmers get on the open
market.
   ``It's a modest beginning,'' said Rep. Bill Emerson, R-Mo. ``It
brings to the commodity the recognition it deserves.''
   The House committee also voted to freeze target prices for wheat
and feed grains at current levels but allow farmers a slight
increase in that price if they cut back on the number of acres they
plant.
   That plan also was designed to comply with the tight budget
constraints placed on the committee by House budget writers.
   The target price would be $4 a bushel for wheat and $2.75 a
bushel for feed grains.
   The committee has been wrestling with efforts to improve soybean
production since it began writing its farm bill earlier in the year.
   The United States, which used to lead the world in soybean
production, has fallen behind because government programs have made
it more profitable for farmers who could grow soybeans to plant
wheat or corn instead.

   The Coast Guard says it would rather not push
for a greater U.S. role in the safety of luxury cruise ships that
carry 7 million passengers a year out of U.S. ports.
   Coast Guard Commandant Paul Yost, in a letter released Thursday,
rejected National Transportation Safety Board proposals that would
give the U.S. government more authority over ships that are
U.S.-owned and carry mostly American passengers but are registered
abroad.
   ``While unilateral actions are tempting as an easy fix,'' Yost
said, ``I continue to believe that efforts through international
channels must be the principal route to achieve improvements.''
   When a cruise ship is registered under a foreign flag it is not
subject to U.S. labor laws or safety regulations.
   The letter to the NTSB agreed with some of the board's
recommendations for improving cruise ship safety.
   But Yost said he favors pursuing most safety improvements
through the International Maritime Organization, since the rules
then would apply to vessels worldwide and protect more Americans.
   ``To pursue a two-tiered approach to passenger safety would not
be in the interests of all our citizens,'' he said. The board had
asked the Coast Guard to sponsor legislation to gain more authority
over foreign-registered ships while also pursuing international
agreements.
   The board recommendations came in a report in October that
proposed a stronger U.S. role in ensuring the safety of cruise
ships that operate out of U.S. coastal cities. It cited crews who
speak no English, a lack of life vests, inadequate safety
equipment, unsafe ship designs and other problems.
   The safety board said 264 people have died in cruise ship
incidents or accidents over the past 25 years, and more deaths
could occur in the future.
   Yost acknowledged that foreign-flagged vessels operating out of
U.S. ports require close monitoring and said some ships lack
sufficient maintenance and crew training.
   He said there are communication problems, but rejected a board
proposal for legislation requiring that 75 percent of crew members
speak English if a ship operates in U.S. waters.
   This ``would be detrimental to our efforts at the international
level,'' Yost said, noting that the Coast Guard is pushing for
international rules to improve crew-passenger communication.
   Yost also rejected an NTSB proposal that U.S. safety
investigators be given greater access and authority over incidents
in international waters when they involve a foreign ship operating
out of a U.S. port.
   ``Accidents which occur aboard foreign vessels outside U.S.
territorial waters are, as a matter of national sovereignty,
properly beyond our normal jurisdiction,'' he said.
   Yost said, however, ``While I may disagree with some of the
statements in your report, I fully support the general notion that
close attention needs to be paid to the safety of passengers
traveling on cruise vessels.''
   Legislative hearings on some of the NTSB proposals are scheduled
next month.

   Advocates battling for a cigarette-free society
have begun a divestment campaign they compare to the one apartheid
opponents used against South Africa.
   Officials at the Boston-based Tobacco Divestment Project said
Thursday they have begun pressuring hospitals, universities and
state retirement funds to sell their holdings in tobacco companies.
   ``We're hoping that much like the anti-apartheid movement
brought about a shift in the way South Africa was viewed ... this
will bring about a shift in the way tobacco companies are viewed,''
said Patrick Reynolds, whose grandfather founded R.J. Reynolds
Tobacco Co. and died of smoking-related emphysema.
   The anti-smoking campaign recently appears to have gained
momentum. Health Secretary Louis Sullivan's called Thursday for a
ban on cigarette vending machines. Harvard University and City
University of New York said recently they would sell all stock in
companies that manufacture tobacco products.
   Sullivan, testifying before the Senate Finance Committee, also
proposed creating a licensing system for tobacco retailers and
establishing penalties for those who sell cigarettes to minors.
   The World Conference on Lung Health, at a meeting here, issued
resolutions that included a call for the international community to
``sever all forms of support to the tobacco industry.''
   ``We believe all this will really tighten the vice around
tobacco firms,'' said Brad Krevor, the divestment project's
executive director.
   Krevor said the project's 12-member board and grassroots
activists around the country are asking institutions to reexamine
their investment portfolios and, where necessary, sell
``inappropriate'' holdings.
   ``We will no longer allow the predatory marketing practices of
these (tobacco) companies to continue,'' he said.
   George Knox, a spokesman for Philip Morris Cos., said the
tobacco maker was aware of the divestment effort but far from
panicked.
   ``We are not sitting here biting our fingernails,'' he said in a
telephone interview from New York. ``But clearly we are not
unconcerned with the issue.''
   He said investors buy and sell stock based on a variety of
criteria but that so far ``we've still had a healthy market in our
stock and expect that to continue.''
   Krevor health and life insurers would be a particular project
target because they offer breaks for non-smokers while
simultaneously investing funds from policies in tobacco stocks.
   ``We certainly are holding tobacco company stocks, but I haven't
found anyone interested in talking about the divestment project at
this time,'' said Charles McGillicuddy, a spokesman for John
Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co. in Boston.
   Krevor said he was optimistic that targeted stockholders would
be receptive to the divestment campaign because ``in many cases
people don't even know they have tobacco holdings.''
   In his May 18 announcement, Harvard President Derek Bok wrote
that the school's board ``was motivated by a desire not to be
associated ... with companies engaged in significant sales of
products that create a substantial and unjustified risk of harm to
other human beings.''
   Divestment project officials, who launched their campaign here
May 10, said beyond applying financial pressure they hoped to sway
legislators toward higher tobacco taxes and a ban on cigarette
advertising.
   Cigarettes, health officials say, cause about 390,000 premature
deaths annually from lung cancer, heart disease and other
cardiovascular disorders.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Amtrak trains are unaffected by President
Bush's veto of a bill authorizing $2 billion in spending for the
passenger rail service. The president's objection deals with a
provision on who can buy railroads.
   It was Bush's first veto of 1990. He returned 10 bills to
Congress in his first year in office last year. Congress has yet to
override a Bush veto.
   Amtrak spokesman Clifford Black said the veto would not affect
daily train operations because the railroad is working with money
that Congress already had appropriated for 1989-1992.
   Bush took issue with a provision that would require the
Interstate Commerce Commission to approve the acquisition of
railroads by non-railroad companies.
   ``This requirement is an unwarranted regulatory roadblock to the
financial restructuring of the railroad industry,'' Bush told
Congress in a veto message Thursday.
   The veto will indefinitely postpone plans for a commuter line
between Washington, D.C., and its northern Virginia suburbs, Black
said. The bill contained technical provisions necessary for the
project to open.
   The legislation, sent to Bush May 10, would authorize a new,
three-year government subsidy of $2 billion to Amtrak, the national
rail passenger service. Actual spending levels are set by separate
appropriations bills.
   Black said Amtrak supports the provision that prompted Bush's
veto, although it applies only to private freight railroads.
   The spokesman said Amtrak relies on private freight lines for
its tracks outside the Northeast corridor and ``does support ICC
oversight of takeovers of railroads by non-railroad companies.''
   Bush attributed the ``rejuvenation of the rail industry since
1980'' largely to an easing of burdensome federal regulations. He
said the Amtrak bill would reverse that trend.
   The bill ``contains an unprecedented new regulatory review
requirement and represents a step backward for the entire rail
industry,'' Bush said.
   He said the additional regulation ``would interfere with the
ability of the nation's largest freight railroads to obtain needed
capital or to change existing capital structure.''
   The provision also would impose a new barrier to any attempted
takeover of a rail line by the carrier's own management or
employees, Bush said.
   The president said existing law provides adequate protection of
the public interest in rail acquisitions.
   Bush administration officials had complained earlier that the
bill amounted to a government subsidy of about $29 a passenger.
However, Bush did not refer to the measure's cost in his veto
message.
   A presidential veto can be overridden only by two-thirds
majorities of both the House and Senate. Rather than try to
override the Amtrak veto, Congress more likely will remove the
provision that Bush finds objectionable and return the modified
bill to the White House for his signature.

   If these Winstons didn't taste good like a
cigarette should, it could be because they were counterfeited in
Cuba.
   Three men, including a former R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.
engineer, were convicted Wednesday of violating export laws and the
U.S. trade embargo against Cuba by shipping equipment to the island
to make imitation Winstons.
   They exported a carton-stuffing machine, cigarette-wrapping
equipment, red and gold ink and other items through Panama to Cuba,
where the fake Winstons were manufactured for export, according to
prosecutors.
   ``It should be a big embarassment for Cuba,'' said Keith Prager,
who supervises the investigating U.S. Customs unit. ``This case ...
shows how desperate the Cuban government is, that they are down to
counterfeiting cigarettes.''
   Customs officials heard about the scheme after a tip on some
equipment shipments in March 1989 and the discovery of 1,800 cases
of Cuban-made Winstons in the Netherlands in August.
   Prosecutors claimed that sales of the American cigarettes could
have made $2 million for Cuba's foreign exchange-starved economy.
It wasn't clear whether any of the cigarettes were eventually sold.
   Convicted after a nine day trial were former R.J. Reynolds
engineering foreman Michael Macko; Emilio Ortiz De Zevallos, the
Peruvian director of a Panamanian export company, and Frank Van
Ameringen, who ran several small tobacco companies from his home in
Miami.
   They face prison terms of 15 to 21 months. U.S. District Judge
Lenore Nesbitt set sentencing for July 23.
   De Zevallos' attorney Michael Tarkoff said the federal
government was in effect making a civil matter into a criminal
prosecution.
   ``These are regulatory-type crimes, civil actions,'' he said.
The lawyer said the government never proved the men intended to
violate the laws they were charged under.

   The airline industry is ``screaming
like pigs to slaughter'' over a bill that would create the nation's
first state-owned airline to ferry passengers on cheap California
flights, the sponsor says.
   The measure proposing Golden State Air will be considered by the
state Senate next month, but Democratic Sen. Art Torres isn't
optimistic.
   ``The chances are tough,'' he said Thursday. ``Going up against
the airline industry has not been an easy task.''
   The Air Transport Association of America, an industry group,
opposes the 1-cent per gallon jet fuel tax Torres has proposed to
pay for the $13 million to $28 million start-up cost of the
government-run airline.
   The group had taken a neutral stance on the bill until it was
amended last Monday to include the fuel tax, which could cost the
industry $24 million to $30 million a year. Commercial air carriers
currently are exempt from jet fuel taxes in California.
   ``Now they're screaming like pigs to slaughter,'' Torres said of
the airlines. ``They're afraid we're going to be competitive.''
   Torres said he has received overwhelming support from businesses
upset over seemingly irrational fares for commercial flights within
California.
   He said people who regularly fly on business have been mailing
him advertisements for $160 fares to Florida and complaining about
$400 to $500 costs for a round-trip between Los Angeles and
Sacramento.
   ``They just can't believe that it costs more for a one-hour
business trip that it does to fly to Washington, D.C.,'' Torres
said.
   He blamed federal deregulation of the industry for allowing
large airlines to swallow smaller companies that operated in-state
commuter flights.
   The state Public Utilities Commission said in December that
rates for flights within California increased an average of more
than 40 percent between 1979 and 1989, after adjustments for
inflation.
   The Air Transport Association disputes those figures. The
industry group claims that most Californians are satisfied with
airline service and that average California air fares dropped
between 1980 and 1988, when adjusted for inflation.

<TEXT>
   Motorola Inc. stock surged to a 52-week
high on news that Japan's major phone company chose its digital
voice-transmission technology for that nation's cellular service.
   Motorola spokesman Tim Kellogg said Thursday that Japan Mobile
Communications, known as IDO, has selected the Chicago-area
company's cellular system for the geographic corridor between Tokyo
and Nagoya, potentially one of the nation's busiest cellular-use
areas.
   ``We don't have all the details, but the value to Motorola for
Tokyo alone is $35 million for the next year,'' Kellogg said.
   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Motorola surged $3.75
to close at $83.75 a share.
   Motorola's cellular speech coder was selected as the technical
standard by both Nippon Telephone and Telegraph and the Ministry of
Post and Telecommunications, said Kellogg.
   ``The speech coder is part of the cellular system that digitizes
the voice and sends it to a receiving unit and then it's decoded,''
he said.
   ``The license for the technology is royalty free,'' Kellogg
said, adding that the selection of the Motolora speech coder
enhances the company's ability to sell the Japanese the equipment
for the coder.
   Motorola reported first-quarter profits of $127 million on sales
of $2.5 billion due mainly to its quickly growing telephone
operation. Total sales were up 16 percent.

   The stock market showed a broad loss today in
selling that hit technology issues hardest.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 14.47 to
2,841.08 in the first half hour of trading.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 7 to 3 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 295 up, 697 down and
474 unchanged.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 20.45 million shares as of 10
a.m. on Wall Street.
   Analysts said the tone for the session was set overnight by word
from Adobe Systems, a computer software company, that its earnings
for the second quarter and full year were likely to fall short of
analysts' estimates.
   Adobe shares, the most active stock in the over-the-counter
market, tumbled 16 to 34{. Other computer and technology issues
registered smaller declines on the news.
   Apple Computer, a primary Adobe customer, slumped 1} to 40\ in
OTC trading. Among NYSE-listed technology stocks, International
Business Machines dropped ~ to 117~ and Motorola 1 to 82}.
   After struggling through an extended rocky spell in the past few
years, technology stocks have enjoyed a revival in the recent rally
that has carried the market to new highs.
   Brokers said the latest word from Adobe came as a fresh setback
to fans of a market group that often is particularly vulnerable to
earnings disappointments.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks
dropped .79 to 194.68. At the American Stock Exchange, the market
value index was down .97 at 359.79.
   On Thursday the Dow Jones industrial average slipped .71 to
2,855.55.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 8 to 7 on the
NYSE, with 712 up, 801 down and 507 unchanged.
   Big Board volume totaled 155.14 million shares, against 172.33
million in the previous session.

<TEXT>
   Truck traffic resumed across the
Canadian-U.S. border after Canada's transport minister persuaded
drivers to end their blockade, and automakers began reopening
plants shut by parts shortages.
   Chrysler Corp. recalled 3,200 workers to its Windsor minivan
plant today after independent Canadian truckers lifted a blockade
of the Ambassador Bridge, a major supply route for U.S.-made auto
parts.
   ``The situation is looking better by the hour,'' said Chrysler
Canada spokesman Walter McCall. ``The flow of materials has been
restored and the likelihood is good that workers will be on their
full shifts (today).''
   But truckers at some other southern Ontario border points,
including Fort Erie across the Niagara River from Buffalo, N.Y.,
and Niagara Falls, remained snarled late Thursday.
   Trucks still were blocking a lane of the Lewiston-Queenston
Bridge at Niagara Falls, allowing only cars to pass, state police
said.
   Trucks were not being allowed across the Peace Bridge linking
Buffalo and Fort Erie, and about 100 to 200 trucks were parked on
each side of the span, bridge officials said.
   In Windsor, the blockade of 300 trucks strangled traffic
Wednesday and part of Thursday on the span between Windsor and
Detroit but gave way to a steady stream of trucks moving in a
single lane by Thursday evening.
   The work stoppage was lifted after Canadian Transport Minister
Doug Lewis said he would take up with the Cabinet the truckers'
complaints about taxes and the free-trade agreement with the United
States.
   ``I am pleased to have had the opportunity to learn directly
from them their concerns about what they consider to be an unlevel
playing field,'' he said.
   Lewis met Thursday morning in Windsor with a delegation led by
Wayne Whitney, a protest organizer, and Bill Wrye, Ontario minister
of transportation.
   About 5 p.m. Thursday, the crowd of protesters dispersed,
apparently pleased with the agreement, said Windsor police Staff
Sgt. R. Nichols.
   ``There were about 200 people and another 100 to 150 trucks
there. But the truckers were happy, got into their trucks and drove
away,'' Nichols said.
   A sign thanking U.S. truckers for their support during the
blockade hung at an intersection where truckers had congregated
during the strike.
   The protest was sparked by proposed increases in Canada's Goods
and Services Tax that will affect the goods that truckers haul as
well as the tires, insurance and diesel fuel they buy.
   The U.S.-Canadian trade agreement, which will remove almost all
tariffs by 1999, will further handicap Canadian truckers,
protesters said.
   The truckers said taxes and the free-trade agreement are
crippling their ability to compete with U.S. drivers.
   The blockade also forced the shutdown of three General Motors of
Canada Ltd. plants in Ontario and production cutbacks at one in
Quebec. Some 13,000 auto workers were affected. Production also was
disrupted at Ford of Canada.
   Ford plants closed early Thursday in Dearborn and Wayne, Mich.;
Lorain and Avon, Ohio; Louisville; and Minneapolis, said company
spokesman Peter Olsen.
   At Mazda Motor Corp.'s plant in Flat Rock, Mich., 20 miles south
of Detroit, workers went home early Wednesday and Thursday, said
spokesman Tom McDonald.
   Protesters also had blocked the truck lanes at the Canadian end
of the Blue Water Bridge between Sarnia and Port Huron, Mich.,
while in Sault Ste. Marie, supervisor Jim Blain at the
International Bridge said he received conflicting reports about the
work stoppage.
   At Fort Erie, about 200 trucks jammed the approaches to the
international Peace Bridge to Buffalo, N.Y. At Blackpool, Quebec,
just across the border from Champlain, N.Y., a heavily armed squad
of police persuaded Quebec truckers to dismantle their blockade
Thursday morning.
   No violence was reported at any of the blockaded border points.

   First they shed their shoes and socks. Next
came the shirts. Then the street vendors, more than 200 of them,
removed their trousers.
   They stood in their underwear outside the municipal assembly
building to protest police harassment, their flabby bellies and
calluses testifying to lifetimes of hard work and bad food. One
woman was in the group.
   ``We wanted the authorities to reflect on what those naked
bodies represented in terms of unemployment, health problems _ of
vulnerability,'' one of the leaders, Luciano Jimeno Huanosta, said
after the strip-in.
   It was a startling tactic in this conservative society, but the
vendors were desperate. Before the protest in April, police
responding to shopkeeper complaints had blocked their turf for days
and the vendors couldn't work.
   More than five hours after the disrobing, city officials agreed
to withdraw the police. The unconventional tactic worked, but was
only one maneuver in an increasingly bitter conflict between
Mexico's formal and informal economies.
   The war between shopkeepers and vendors is a symptom of a sick
economy.
   An estimated 40 percent of Mexican workers are unemployed or
underemployed. A million new jobs a year are needed just to keep up
with population growth.
   For many, especially the very young and very old, there is no
choice but making a living on the streets.
   ``If they want to get vendors off the streets, they have to
create jobs,'' said Federico Garcia Hernandez, 29, a
second-generation street salesman.
   Street vendors always have been part of Mexico, but their
numbers have risen steadily since serious economic problems began
in 1982.
   The National Chamber of Commerce in Mexico City, which has done
studies on the informal economy for three years, estimates the
capital has 200,000 street vendors. If they keep increasing, it
says, vendors will outnumber regular merchants in a few years.
   The main field of battle is the heart of Mexico City, a
440-square-block labyrinth of commerce, colonial churches, Aztec
ruins, cantinas and cafes known simply as El Centro.
   You can buy anything in El Centro from a stuffed, two-headed
calf to the dried, powdered, encapsulated skin of rattlesnakes to
the latest VCR.
   It has streets of shops that sell lingerie and lace, other
streets that sell lights, spare parts, sporting goods, housewares.
   You can buy from shops behind walls encrusted with layers of
handbills or on curbsides so old they are worn down to street level.
   It's cheaper on the street.
   ``On foreign goods, they can undercut us by almost 50 percent,''
said shopkeeper Alberto Gaona. ``They don't pay the 20 percent
import tax and they don't pay the 15 percent value added tax. And
I'd estimate that 70 to 85 percent of their goods are foreign.''
   The shopkeepers, who must pay utility bills, rent, salaries and
taxes, say the vendors are driving them out of business.
   ``We have dead zones now, areas where all the merchants have
shut down,'' said Guillermo Gazal Jafif, founder of Procentrico, a
group of downtown merchants. ``It's a direct attack on the formal
economy.''
   Procentrico estimates 30,000 street salesmen are competing in El
Centro with 12,000 established merchants. Merchants have pestered
city hall for more than a year to evict the vendors who clog the
area's narrow streets.
   The vendors have resisted with demonstrations, sit-ins,
petitions and the now-famous disrobing.
   There have been vague promises that the dispute would be
resolved, but no action other than sporadic police sweeps against
vendors.
   Both vendors and merchants agree on the reasons for inaction:
Street vendors are a lucrative source of bribes and payoffs, and
part of the political machinery of the governing Institutional
Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI.
   An elaborate system of payoffs is run by leaders of vendor
unions.
   More than 50 such unions are said to operate in El Centro alone.
All but a few are formally affiliated with the PRI, the Chamber of
Commerce says, and the occasional crackdowns are almost always on
independents.
   Vendors and merchants say the minimum payment by a vendor is
10,000 pesos a day, about $3, which buys a piece of turf free of
harassment by policemen or competitors. The union leader keeps part
of the money and uses the rest for bribes.
   The acknowledged queenpin of the PRI-affiliated vendors is a
hefty woman named Guillermina Rico, who can muster as many as
18,000 vendors for party rallies and is said to have a Swiss bank
account.
   Mrs. Rico, 54, operates from a warehouse crammed with video
recorders and other electronics behind an anonymous iron door at
the teeming La Merced market. The walls are hung with photos of her
with presidents and mayors and other party luminaries.
   The Chamber of Commerce says union leaders collected an
estimated 2.2 billion pesos in payoffs in 1988, about $1 million at
the prevailing exchange rate.
   It has proposed dismantling the system and using the money to
build markets where the vendors could set up shop. Procentrico also
favors building markets.
   ``The vendors exist because of a deteriorating economy, official
corruption and politics,'' said Sergio Rios Lara, one of
Procentrico's directors.
   ``Things can't continue like this. Mexico is in a era of change.
Things can't keep working like they used to.''

<HEAD>Campbell To Sell Some European Food Units</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: INSERTS two grafs after the 6th graf with background.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Campbell Soup Co. said today it plans to
sell several of its European food units in an effort to focus on
its more profitable businesses.
   On the auction block are D. Lazzaroni &amp; C. SpA of Italy;
Campbell Seafoods Division, which operates in the United Kingdom
and Belgium; the vegetable division of Campbell Foods PLC in
England; and Campbell Irish Foods Ltd. and Mallow Foods Ltd., both
of Ireland.
   The latter three companies were acquired when Campbell took over
Freshbake Foods Group PLC of Britain in 1988. Total sales of all
the businesses to be sold exceed $200 million, the company said.
   Campbell, whose board of directors approved the divestiture on
Thursday, said it expected the sale to result in a $55 million
charge against fourth quarter earnings.
   ``The result will be a more focused European enterprise
delivering stronger operating profits along with superior returns
and cash generation,'' Campbell Chief Executive David W. Johnson
said in a statement.
   He noted that Campbell is committed to ``rebuild the frozen
convenience food operation, which promises international synergy
and long-term potential.''
   Campbell has faced increasing problems over the past year and
has been frequently rumored as a takeover target because of its
sluggish performance and depressed stock price. Some members of the
founding family have urged a sale of the entire company.
   The firm has sought to remain independent by divesting
underperforming businesses and closing plants, cutting costs and
laying off hundreds of workers.
   The companies to be divested have excellent positions in their
respective markets that should make them attractive to a number of
prospective buyers, officials said.
   Lazzaroni, based on Saronno, makes premium biscuits and seasonal
cakes under the Lazzaroni and Borsari trademarks, but the unit has
suffered from operating losses.
   The U.K. vegetable division has a 20 percent share of the frozen
green vegetable market in Britain, while Irish Foods holds a 42
percent market share in Ireland. Its sister company, Mallow Foods,
is a leading supplier of dehydrated vegetables, with a 25 percent
share of the European market in dried peas.

   Sales of existing homes fell 2.1 percent in
April, their third drop in four months as they continued to lose
momentum due to high mortgage rates, a real estate trade group
reported today.
   The National Association of Realtors said resales of
single-family homes totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
3.33 million units, down from the March rate of 3.40 million.
   Existing home sales hit their 1989 peak of 3.56 million units in
November and December and then fell in January, February and April.
Sales were unchanged in March.
   According to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Crop., rates ranged
from 10.25 percent to 10.56 percent during April. They had dipped
to 10.33 percent by today.
   John A. Tuccillo, Realtors chief economist, said the high rates
are keeping many prospective buyers out of the market in hopes of
future rate declines.
   But despite the cost of mortgages, the sluggish Northeast market
posted the only gain in April. Sales rose 4.0 percent to 520,000
units in what the Realtors president Norman D. Flynn called a
``buyer's market'' caused by supply exceeding demand.
   Sales slipped 1.1 percent to 900,000 units in the Midwest and
dropped 3.7 percent to 1.31 million units in the South. But they
plummeted 7.9 percent to 580,000 homes in the West.
   The Realtors said the national median price for an existing home
in April was $95,300, down 1.0 percent from March but up 2.6
percent from April 1989. The median price means half of the homes
cost more, half less.
   The median price fell in all regions. It was down 5.4 percent to
$140,700 in the Northeast, down 4.9 percent to $134,900 in the
West, down 2.4 percent to $75,300 in the Midwest and off 0.3
percent to $85,700 in the South.

<TEXT>
   A discount retailer laden with takeover-related
debt taps the junk bond market to raise $300 million.
   That may sound like just another tale from the easy-money days
of the 1980s. But the deal took place last week, notwithstanding
the current talk of a credit crunch and the death of the junk
market.
   The fact that the Caldor discount chain was able to raise a
hefty sum to refinance existing debt showed that some investors
still have appetites for non-investment grade credits, bankers say.
   Caldor and most other recent junk issuers have had to raise
their funds via private placements rather than in the public bond
market, however. They've also had to structure their financing
deals more conservatively, with tighter covenants to lure buyers.
   ``The buyers are really in the driver's seat,'' said John
Crotty, a high-yield bond specialist at First Boston Corp. For
insurance companies and other big institutions willing to buy junk,
``they can really tailor the bonds that they are buying.''
   So far this year only four borrowers have made public offerings
of junk bonds to raise a total of just $382 million, said David
Unger, who tracks the high-yield market for First Boston.
   In the same period last year, before the bankruptcy filing of
Campeau Corp.'s retailing arms and the collapse of Drexel Burnham
Lambert Inc. virtually shut down the market, the total exceeded $11
billion.
   ``For all intents and purposes, the public market is dead,''
said Anthony Napolitano, who tracks private placements at McCarthy,
Crisanti &amp; Maffei.
   So Caldor looked for financing in the private junk market, which
at an estimated $170 billion is nearly as large as the public
market.
   Caldor was taken private last October when a group of investors
that included management and the investment bank Donaldson, Lufkin
&amp; Jenrette Securities Corp. bought the discount chain from May
Department Stores Co. in a $552 million debt-financed deal known as
a leveraged buyout.
   Garrett Moran, a managing director of DLJ, said the bank sat
down with insurance companies, pension funds, mutual funds and
Japanese institutions to hammer out long-term financing to replace
the buyout group's temporary bridge loan.
   The result was a three-part deal: $160 million of senior
floating rate 7-year notes paying interest of 2} percentage points
over the London interbank rate; $40 million of 7-year 12~ percent
senior notes, and $100 million of 10-year subordinated notes paying
interest of 15 percent and carrying 7-year warrants to buy 12
percent of Caldor's equity.
   It took a month to hammer out the deal and sell it to about 50
institutions, Moran said, compared to the two to three weeks it
used to take to launch a public bond issue. Caldor also had to
include stricter covenants and include equity warrants, unlike the
heydays of the junk market, he said. Still, it got the money.
   ``It shows that reasonable deals can get done in good size,''
Moran said.
   In recent weeks, bankers say more than $1 billion in deals have
been done for borrowers such as the furniture company Ethan Allen
Inc., drug chain operator Jack Eckerd Corp. and Multimedia Corp.,
the publishing and broadcasting company.
   Hal Guenther, senior vice president who handles private
placements at Kemper Financial Services, said the private market
could be capable of absorbing a couple hundred million worth of
bonds a week. What's more, borrowers can save money because they
don't have to pay the hefty underwriting fees of a public issue, he
says.
   Guenther says his company hasn't found any of the recent deals
attractive enough to buy. But he welcomed the trend toward giving
bondholders better protection against default and away from
notorious features like pay-in-kind bonds and coupon resets.
   Homer Rees, president of Prudential Capital Corp., agrees. Terms
are becoming more realistic than a few years ago, especially when
equity options are included as in Caldor's deal, he said.
   ``People are being paid more commensurately with the risks that
are being taken,'' he says.

   General Motors Corp. will begin making cars in
East Germany later this year, company Chairman Roger Smith said
today as he addressed shareholders at his last GM annual meeting.
   If GM starts production as planned in October, the world's
largest corporation will become the first U.S. automaker to make
vehicles in the region undergoing rapid political and economic
reform.
   Smith, who retires July 31 after 9{ years as head of GM, said
the company will make Opel Vectra cars for sale in Europe under a
joint venture with East Germany's Automobilewerke Eisenach.
   The company will assemble about 10,000 of the cars this year.
Production of the four-door sedans, about the same size as the
Chevrolet Cavalier, is expected to increase to about 150,000
annually by the mid-1990s, GM spokesman Jack Harned said.
   Chysler Corp. has planned a joint venture to make minivans in
Austria. Ford Motor Co. is studying vehicle assembly plans in East
Germany but has yet to announce any specific plans.
   Automobilewerke's factory in Eisenach currently makes the
Wartburg automobile. Harned said production of the Vectra will be a
separate operation.
   ``It's not GM taking over Wartburg,'' he noted. GM currently
makes the Vector in Russelsheim, West Germany.
   Smith said the joint venture with Automobilewerke is the first
step of GM's ``New Europe'' strategy. In addition to making cars,
GM will begin building engines and assembling a small number of
cars in Hungary by early 1992.
   During Smith's tenure, GM's share of the U.S. car and truck
market fell to about 36 percent from about 44 percent.
   Also at the meeting, GM shareholders voted to double the
pensions of 3,350 top executives by changing the formula for
calculating them from one that considers salary alone to one that
bases pension on both salary and bonuses. Of 503 million
shareholder votes, 83.3 percent favored the proposal.
   Smith weathered some personal attacks during debate, including
opposition from corporate gadfly Evelyn Davis of Washington.
   ``Roger, in due respect to you, you don't need this type of a
pension,'' she said.
   The proposal also had been opposed by Michigan state Treasurer
Robert Bowman, who administers 8.8 million shares, about 1 percent
of outstanding stock, through five pension funds.
   The proposal would cost about $42 million annually. Bowman has
said there are better uses for the money, including product
development, further plant modernization and beefing up an
underfunded pension plan for other employees.
   Bowman said before the meeting he would ask incoming Chairman
Robert Stempel to reject any such approved increase.

<HEAD>Meredith Agrees to Sell SAIL Magazine to Cahners Publishing</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Meredith Corp. said Friday it has agreed
to sell SAIL magazine to Cahners Publishing, which already produces
Power &amp; Motoryacht, MotorBoat and Motoryacht International
magazines.
   The price was not disclosed.
   The magazine has a monthly circulation of 170,000, making it the
largest circulation sailing magazine in the world, Meredith said.
   Meredith, based in Des Moines, is a diversified media and real
estate business best known for its Better Homes and Gardens and
Ladies' Home Journal magazines.
   Cahners, of Newton, Mass., is part of Reed Publishing (USA) Inc.
   ``SAIL is the `bible' _ it has a tremendous franchise in the
boating industry _ and it's always been a Cahners `acquisition
tradition' to seek out publications like SAIL that are leaders in
their fields,'' said Terry McDermott, the president of Cahners.
   Jack Rehm, president of Meredith, said SAIL has performed well
for the company over the years but is being sold as part of a
strategic plan.
   ``Meredith publications are targeted to a home and family
readership. In the 10 years since we acquired SAIL, our magazines
have become even more focused on that audience,'' Rehm said.

<HEAD>Regulators Say Program Trading Helped Cause Share-Value Loss</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Computer-triggered selling on the Chicago
futures markets helped cause the sharp loss in the value of shares
on the New York Stock Exchange last Oct. 13, federal regulators say.
   ``Index arbitrage and other program selling significantly
accelerated and exacerbated the market decline,'' the Securities
and Exchange Commission's division of market regulation said in a
report. The report was presented to the House Commerce finance
subcommittee on Thursday.
   The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 190.58 points, or 6.91
percent of its value, on Oct. 13. Overall, the nation's securities
markets lost $190 billion in value, including $160 billion in the
last 90 minutes of trading. On the next business day, Monday, Oct.
16, another sell-off was followed by a sharp upswing in heavy
trading before the markets stabilized.
   The investigators found a large number of futures sales by
speculators on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange during critical
times on Oct. 13. ``CME floor traders did not provide net liquidity
to the market,'' the report said.
   ``Given current market and regulatory structures, there can be
no assurance that the extraordinary volatility of Oct. 13 and 16
will not be repeated or surpassed in the future,'' the
investigators concluded.
   The report said a ``circuit breaker'' mechanism that was
developed after the 1987 stock market crash may have slowed the
market decline last year. The mechanism, which temporarily limits
price swings, was imposed after a 12-point drop in the price of a
Standard &amp; Poor's basket of futures.
   Imposition of the circuit breaker coincided with a steep decline
in the level of program selling on the New York Stock Exchange and
a reduction in the rate of the price decline in NYSE stocks, the
report said.
   ``While a direct causal relationship is difficult to establish,
at a minimum, the division's findings do not indicate any harm to
the markets attributable to the imposition of the circuit-breaker
mechanisms,'' the report said.
   The SEC and the Bush administration have been pressing Congress
to give the SEC authority to regulate stock-index futures. The
Commodity Futures Trading Commission now regulates such trading.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Gain On Strong Exports, Rain Forecasts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Grain and soybean futures prices were moderately
higher in early trading today on the Chicago Board of Trade,
boosted by surprisingly strong export sales and the arrival of a
new round of showers in the Midwest.
   In a report released late Thursday, the Agriculture Department
said export sales of corn, wheat and soybeans rose last week,
contrary to normal seasonal patterns.
   The corn and soybean markets also were supported by reports of
rain falling across Illinois and forecasts for scattered showers in
the Midwest through the weekend.
   The rain threatens to further delay planting progress in areas
already well soaked by recent rains, analysts said.
   ``It looks like a real soggy run for the eastern Corn Belt,''
said Richard Feltes, director of commodity research with the
futures brokerage Refco Inc.
   In early trading, wheat futures prices were 1 cent to 3 cents
higher with the contract for delivery in July at $3.31{ a bushel;
corn futures were 2 cents to 3{ cents higher with July at $2.82{ a
bushel; oats were 1 cent to 2{ cents higher with July at $1.54 a
bushel; soybeans were 4 cents to 5{ cents higher with July at
$6.19{ a bushel.
   Cattle futures were narrowly mixed while pork futures were
mostly higher in early trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.
   Live cattle were .05 cent lower to .05 cent higher with June at
73.50 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .13 cent lower to .03 cent
higher with August at 83.60 cents a pound; live hogs were .08 cent
lower to .25 cent higher with June at 65.90 cents a pound; frozen
pork bellies were .03 cent to .13 cent higher with July at 65.60
cents a pound.
   Cattle futures fell on Thursday while hogs advanced and pork
bellies dropped sharply.

   Shares finished mostly lower Friday on London's
Stock Exchange after mostly sluggish trading before a long holiday
weekend.
   Monday is a bank holiday in Britain.
   The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index finished down
11.5 points, or 0.5 percent, at 2,265.6, slightly below its high
for the day of 2,276.3 and above its low of 2,258.4.
   The Financial Times 30-share index was down 5.2 points at
1,800.0 at the close. The Financial Times 500-share index fell 5.63
points to close at 1,228.69.
   Volume was a light 385.6 million shares, compared with 420.3
million shares Thursday.
   Profit-talking and an absence of buyers for the majority of the
session dragged prices lower, traders said.
   A lack of corporate or economic news further burdened the
market, they said.

   Stock prices lost ground today in selling that
hit technology issues hardest.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 13.52 to
2,842.03 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street.
   Losers outnumbered gainers by about 8 to 5 in nationwide trading
of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 559 up, 881 down and
497 unchanged.
   Analysts said the tone for the session was set overnight by word
from Adobe Systems, a computer software company, that its earnings
for the second quarter and full year were likely to fall short of
analysts' estimates.
   Adobe shares, the most active stock in the over-the-counter
market, tumbled 16\ to 34\. Other computer and technology issues
registered smaller declines on the news.
   Apple Computer, a primary Adobe customer, slumped 2 to 40 in OTC
trading. Among NYSE-listed technology stocks, International
Business Machines dropped 1&lsqb; to 117| and Motorola 2&rsqb; to 81&rsqb;.
   After struggling through an extended rocky spell in the past few
years, technology stocks have enjoyed a revival in the recent rally
that has carried the market to new highs.
   Brokers said the latest word from Adobe came as a fresh setback
to fans of a market group that often is particularly vulnerable to
earnings disappointments.
   Dennison Manufacturing jumped 8\ to 27\ and Avery International
fell 2{ to 26. Avery agreed to acquire Dennison through an exchange
of stock.
   The NYSE's composite index of all its listed common stocks fell
.78 to 194.69. At the American Stock Exchange, the market value
index was down .76 at 360.00.
   Volume on the Big Board came to 86.53 million shares with two
hours to go.

<HEAD>High Mortgage Rates Affect Sales of Existing Homes</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   High mortgage rates continued to dampen sales
of existing homes through much of the nation in April, although the
Northeast posted its first gain since last fall, a real estate
trade group said Friday.
   The National Association of Realtors said overall resales of
single-family homes slipped 2.1 percent, to a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of 3.33 million units. It was the third drop in four
months as mortgage rates remained in double digits. Sales were
unchanged in March.
   The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Crop. said rates ranged from
10.25 percent to 10.56 percent in April. They had dipped back to
10.33 percent by Friday.
   Rates also have affected sales of new homes, which fell for four
consecutive months through March. The Commerce Department will
release the April sales figures Wednesday.
   Although mortgage costs remained high, sales of existing homes
in the Northeast increased for the first time since October.
Purchasers bought at an annual rate of 520,000 units in April, up 4
percent from the 500,000 units sold the previous month.
   Norman D. Flynn, Realtors president, said inventories have risen
while prices have fallen, and the buyers' market caused by supply
exceeding demand attracted buyers despite the high rates.
   The median price of an existing home in the Northeast was down
5.4 percent to $140,700, compared to the national median of
$95,300. The median price means half of the homes cost more, half
less.
   Elsewhere, sales fell.
   In the high-cost Western market, sales plummeted 7.9 percent to
580,000 units, despite a 4.9 percent drop in its median price to
$134,900. The median price had been $147,100 as recently as
November.
   The resale rate in the South fell 3.7 percent to 1.31 million
units. The median price was $85,700, down 0.3 percent from March.
   Sales also slipped 1.1 percent to 900,000 units in the Midwest,
where the median price fell 2.4 percent to $75,300.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Says Airline Employees Entitled to Damages</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Continental Airlines employees who lost wages
and benefits in 1983 when the company was allowed to reject its
labor contracts are entitled to damages, a federal appeals court
said Friday.
   But the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the employee
unions' contention that the bankruptcy court judge who originally
ruled in the matter should have removed himself from the case.
Shortly after his ruling, Judge T. Glover Roberts accepted a
partnership in the law firm that represented Continental.
   Roberts risked an appearance of impropriety when he accepted the
position, the appeals court said. But the judges said the job was
offered after Roberts had ruled in the case.
   Glover had ruled in favor of Continental in rejecting employees'
claims for future wages and benefits. The unions had claimed they
were entitled to wages and benefits they would have received if
their labor contracts hadn't been dumped when Continental filed
Chapter 11 bankruptcy papers in 1983.
   The employees kept working under emergency work rules approved
by the bankruptcy Court.
   ``Recognizing that the agreements here at issue do not guarantee
employment, we hold that the difference between the wages and
benefits set out in the agreements and the wages and benefits
actually paid under the emergency work rules are recoverable as
unsecured claims to the extent that work would have been available
had the agreements not been rejected,'' the appeals court said.
   The court sent the case to the bankruptcy court to determine
when Continental would have had to cease operations had it not
cancelled the contracts and to calculate appropriate damages.

<HEAD>Tag Team: Label Maker, Ticket Outfit To Merge</HEAD>

<TEXT>
   Stick-on label maker Avery International
Corp. has agreed to merge with Dennison Manufacturing Co. of
Framingham, Mass., which produces office supplies and systems to
tag and ticket clothes for retailers, the companies said Friday.
   The new company, Avery Dennison Corp., will be based at Avery's
Pasadena headquarters. The friendly deal, recommended by management
of both companies, still must be approved by stockholders and
regulators.
   Dennison shareholders will receive 1.12 shares of Avery common
stock for every share of Dennison common stock, a deal that values
Dennison at about $500 million, the companies said.
   Avery has annual revenue of about $1.7 billion and 11,700
workers. Dennison's annual revenue is about $770 million and the
company has about 7,000 employees.
   Representatives of both companies will have to study details of
how operations will be merged before any decision is made on
whether to lay off workers, Avery spokeswoman Diane Dixon said.
   Avery and Dennison have a range of complementary products sold
under such brands as Avery, Fasson, Dennison, National and
Carter's, Avery chief executive, Charles D. Miller, and his
counterpart at Dennison, Nelson S. Gifford, said in a joint
statement. They said that offered excellent opportunities for
expansion.
   ``The new company will have a strong, worldwide presence in
office supplies and industrial systems, enhancing our ability to
compete against other global companies.
   ``In addition, our complementary strengths in the tag and ticket
business provide us with the opportunity to develop new business
more cost-effectively,'' they said.

<HEAD>Corn Futures Climb On Rain Forecasts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Corn futures prices rose strongly Friday on the
Chicago Board of Trade, extending the gains of the two previous
sessions amid rain forecasts that threaten to further delay
planting progress in the Midwest.
   Other grain and soybean futures also advanced.
   Forecasts for scattered showers Corn Belt through the Memorial
Day weekend and well into next week ``overwhelmed everything else''
in the market Friday, said Victor Lespinasse, an assistant vice
president in the grain trading division of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   About 20 percent of the nation's corn crop remains to be
planted, Lespinasse said, and if farmers don't get the seed in the
ground within the next 10 days, yield losses are likely.
   That propect was reflected in steeper losses in the contracts
for delivery of corn from the upcoming crop than in the July
contract, which represents the last of the old-crop corn.
   The pattern was reversed in the soybean market, reflecting the
possibility that farmers will plant soybeans on acres they had
planned to sow with corn.
   Indications of strong export sales of U.S. grains supported all
the markets, analysts said.
   At the close, wheat futures were unchanged to 3 cents higher
with the contract for delivery in July at $3.30{ a bushel; corn was
unchanged to 5{ cents higher with July at $2.84 a bushel; oats were
1{ cents to 2{ cents higher with July at $1.54{ a bushel; soybeans
were 1\ cents to 4{ cents higher with July at $6.20 a bushel.

<HEAD>Rebirth of Ad-Free Ms. Magazine Now Set for Late July</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SKIP WOLLENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The owners of Ms. magazine say reader response
to their plans to resurrect the publication without advertising was
strong enough to proceed, but they have delayed its reappearance
until late July.
   The 17-year-old feminist magazine suspended publication last
December because of heavy losses and a sharp decline in advertising.
   In March, plans were announced to resume publication without ads
starting in June. But Andrea Kaplan, a spokeswoman for the
magazine, said Thursday that the relaunch date now has been set for
July 31.
   She blamed the delay on ``a lot of launch details'' that must be
addressed.
   Lang Communications Inc., a New York-based company that acquired
Ms. last fall, previously said that barring ads from the magazine
would free writers to pursue topics without worrying about how
advertisers might react.
   But magazine executives indicated earlier this year that
resumption of publishing would depend on getting enough people sign
up for subscriptions, which were set at $40 a year _ more than
double the previous $16 rate.
   The magazine will appear six times a year, down from 10
previously.
   Ms. Kaplan declined to say how many people have signed up for
subscriptions.
   She said Chairman Dale Lang and other magazine executives met
two weeks ago and decided to proceed. She said the subscription
response was ``close to their projections'' and that it was
particularly strong from young women just out of college.
   Industry analysts warned that it would be difficult to generate
enough revenue from circulation alone to be profitable,
particularly because many other magazines have taken up some of the
topics on which Ms. built its franchise with feminists.
   But Lang hired noted feminist author Robin Morgan as its new
editor in chief and she has said the magazine will address topics
that have not been explored fully enough in women's magazines.
   She has cited as examples stories on the role of women in the
upheavals in Eastern Europe, homeless women and violence against
women. The magazine also will feature fiction and poetry from women
and investigative reporting.
   Ms. founder Gloria Steinem helped drum up support for the
relaunch, writing a pitch for the magazine that was included in a
March mailing to about 600,000 potential subscribers people,
including those who had been subscribing to Ms. when publication
was suspended.
   Ms. Kaplan said the magazine is continuing to solicit
subscriptions, and expects a total circulation of ``less than
100,000.''
   She said Lang expects to break even on the publication for the
first year without advertising.

<HEAD>Macy's Cash Flow Rises 4 Percent in Latest Quarter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   R.H. Macy &amp; Co. Inc.'s cash flow, crucial to the
company's ability to reduce its heavy debt, rose 4 percent during
the retailer's third quarter, a spokesman said Friday.
   Based on preliminary results, Macy's cash flow _ its earnings
before interest, taxes and depreciation _ rose to $160.2 million
from $154 million a year earlier, spokesman Jim Fingeroth said.
   The company suffered a net loss in the quarter, which ended
April 28, of $63.1 million, down from $64.1 million a year earlier.
   Final figures for the quarter were expected to be released in
mid-June.
   The news followed months of concern about the company's
financial health and was welcomed by investors, who bid up the
price of Macy's junk bonds Friday.
   The company, which remains saddled with debt after a $3.6
billion leveraged buyout in 1986, is dependent on its cash flow to
pay its bills.
   Investors have been concerned about Macy's results since the
company suffered a $39 million loss in its second quarter.
   The second quarter included the critical Christmas shopping
season, a time when retailers expect to earn as much as half their
annual profit. But this past Christmas, Macy was forced to take
heavy markdowns on its merchandise to compete with Campeau Corp.'s
department stores, and its profits vanished.
   The Campeau units, also struggling after billion-dollar buyouts,
had slashed their prices to bring in sales in an unsuccessful
attempt to avoid a bankruptcy court filing.
   Macy's creditors also have been concerned about the retailer's
financial state. On Thursday, Heller Financial Corp., a company
that lends money to Macy suppliers, said it was reconsidering its
standards for financing shipments to the retailer.
   Macy's junk bonds fell sharply Thursday in response to Heller's
announcement, but the issues recovered some ground Friday.

   Anheuser-Busch Inc. said Friday it was ending
production of LA, the brewer's poor-selling, reduced-alcohol beer
that apparently lost its niche and could not find a new one.
   The beer, with about half the alcohol of regular beer, was
introduced six years ago as the first response from a major brewer
to the trend toward more responsible drinking. LA's slogan was
``for the way you live your life today...LA.''
   But the trend LA tried to ride ended up spelling its demise,
analysts said.
   On Friday, Anheuser-Busch executives said they were getting rid
of the LA brand because they didn't want the beer to take sales
away from its new no-alcohol beer, O'Doul's.
   ``It was clear to us that the two brands came to compete for
essentially the same consumer segment,'' said Jim Hunter, vice
president of sales for the St. Louis-based brewer. ``And it became
clear that O'Doul's was emerging as the consumer's choice.''
   Hunter said O'Doul's, which was introduced nationally earlier
this year, has exceeded sales projections by more than 30 percent.
He said the company plans to increase production of the beer once
LA production ends June 30.
   Other non-alcoholic beers, including Miller Brewing Co.'s
Sharp's and Pabst's NA brand, also are starting to get more room on
store shelves around the country.
   Some analysts said Friday that the demise of LA would not
necessarily mean the new no-alcohol brews were doomed.
   O'Doul's and other no-alcohol brews are considered a clear
alternative to regular beer, not a half-step like LA.
   ``The beer drinker either wants the regular beer, or the lower
calorie beer or no alcohol at all,'' said Julie Niemann of Stifel
Nicolaus &amp; Co. Inc. in St. Louis. ``This was a
neither-fish-nor-fowl kind of thing.''
   Robert Weinberg, professor of marketing management at Washington
University and a beer industry consultant, said, ``It was not
enough of an alternative. It seemed like a hybrid product, sort of
a compromise.''
   Weinberg said he drank LA occasionally at a restaurant near his
office _ until the restaurant stopped stocking the beer because he
was the only customer requesting it.
   ``The demand was indeed small, even though it was marketed
aggressively,'' Weinberg said. ``So, I think it was a matter of
time.''
   LA beer never was a highly popular product for Anheuser-Busch.
   In 1984, LA sales totaled about 300,000 barrels, a fraction of
the 80 million barrels of beer Anheuser-Busch company makes
annually, according to industry estimates. Sales steadily fell and
were about 20,000 barrels for all of 1989, analysts said.
   Anheuser-Busch did not expect either LA or O'Doul's to be big
sellers, one analyst said.
   ``Both LA and O'Doul's are meant not only to be profit makers,
but in my opinion, they have been introduced to fill a social
need,'' said George Thompson, of Prudential-Bache in New York.
   ``I think that in that context, the company really isn't
terribly concerned that they make a lot of money _ the point is to
provide an alternative.''
   Thompson said LA's failure indicated consumers were not that
interested in having an alternative to regular beer.
   ``The fault lies here not with Anheuser-Busch, but with the
consumers,'' Thompson said. ``Anheuser-Busch knows how to sell
beer, if there's a willing consumer base. If there isn't a willing
consumer base, then even the good Lord couldn't sell it.''

<TEXT>
   Treasury security prices closed lower Friday
after a series of reports that spelled bad news for the bond
market, including consumer spending figures that were rosier than
analysts had expected.
   The government's bellwether 30-year bond, which lost 7-16 point
Thursday, fell another | point, or about $6.25 per $1,000 face
amount. Its yield, which rises when prices fall, rose to 8.66
percent from 8.61 percent late Thursday.
   Trading was extremely light due to the long Memorial Day weekend.
   Analysts said the market was affected by the government's report
that consumer spending increased by 0.6 percent in April, the
largest increase since it rose 1.2 percent in January. The increase
was seen as a good indication of future economic growth.
   Traders had been expecting an increase of about 0.4 percent,
said Mike Casey, international economist at Maria Ramirez Capital
Consultants Inc. Bond prices usually decline on signs of economic
improvement because it decreases the likelihood that the Federal
Reserve Board will ease interest rates.
   Casey said the market also soured as the Treasury announced
plans to sell $12 billion in cash management bills Wednesday to
raise new cash, $2 billion more than expected. An increase in the
supply of a security often causes prices to fall.
   In addition, analysts said the market was affected by weak
bidding in Thursday's auction of $8.5 billion in five-year Treasury
notes, as well as the dollar's sharp drop against the Japanese yen
in European trading early Friday.
   ``There wasn't any tremendous blow, but just a series of small,
unfortunate things that happened over the course of the day,''
Casey said.
   In the secondary market for Treasury bonds, prices of short-term
governments fell from 3-32 point to &lsqb; point, intermediate
maturities fell from &lsqb; point to 17-32 point, and long-term issues
dropped | point, according to Telerate Inc., a financial
information service.
   The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $10 in the
price of a bond with a $1,000 face value.
   The Shearson Lehman Hutton Daily Treasury Bond Index, which
measures price movements on all outstanding Treasury issues with
maturities of a year or longer, fell 3.14 to 1,147.99.
   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively
traded municipal bonds fell &lsqb; point to 91 9-32. The average yield
to maturity rose to 7.54 percent from 7.53 percent late Thursday.
   Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to 7.99 percent as the
discount rose 7 basis points to 7.74 percent. Yields on six-month
bills rose to 8.16 percent as the discount rose 4 basis points to
7.74 percent. Yields on one-year bills increased to 8.22 percent as
the discount rose 8 basis points to 7.66 percent.
   A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield
is the annualized return on an investment in a Treasury bill. The
discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face
value, which is paid at maturity.
   The federal funds rate, the interest rate banks charge each
other on overnight loans, was quoted at 8 5-16 percent, unchanged
from late Thursday.

<TEXT>
   Crude oil and heating oil futures prices fell
while gasoline futures were mixed Friday as traders squared their
accounts in advance of the three-day Memorial Day weekend.
   The July contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark
grade of U.S. crude oil, slipped 3 cents to $17.80 a 42-gallon
barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange following a 31-cent
decline Thursday. Later contract months also showed small losses.
   Among refined products traded on the Merc, the June contract for
home heating oil dropped 0.15 cent a gallon to 49.66 cents, after
falling 0.40 cent on Thursday. Later months showed bigger declines.
   Warm weather is usually a slack period for heating oil, analysts
say.
   Gasoline futures were mixed. The June contract for wholesale
unleaded gasoline rose 0.18 cent to 63.41 cents a gallon on top of
Thursday's 0.72 cent advance.
   But later contract months for gasoline futures fell. The July
contract, for instance, dropped 0.37 cent to 61.00 cents a gallon
after rising 1.05 cents Thursday.
   Peter Beutel, assistant director of the energy group at Elders
Futures Inc., said the rise in the near-month gasoline contract may
have reflected the surge in demand that usually accompanies the
summer driving season, which unofficially begins with Memorial Day.
   Natural gas prices declined. The July contract fell to $1.592
per 1,000 cubic feet from $1.600 Thursday.
   Beutel said trading in each of the energy futures categories was
volatile and active at times during the session, but he said prices
were driven mostly by technical factors, including the reluctance
of traders to hold vulnerable positions in the market over a
three-day weekend.

   Beech-Nut Nutrition Corp. said Friday it was
voluntarily recalling two baby food products because small stones
were found in some of the jars during routine checks.
   The stones apparently were in a shipment of peas used in the
company's Table Time Vegetable Stew with Chicken and Stage 3
Chicken Noodle Dinner. The company said it was investigating why
the shipment was not thoroughly cleaned by the supplier.
   The products were produced at Beech-Nut's Canajoharie, N.Y.,
plant, said Patrick Farrell, a spokesman for Beech-Nut's parent
company, Ralston Purina Co.
   He said the pebbles were found during routine quality control
checks of more than 183,000 jars. He said the company found 52
small stones ranging in size from one-eighth inch to one-half inch.
   The company said it has received only one consumer complaint and
no reports of injury.
   The vegetable stew is marked with an expiration date Feb. 28,
1992, and the chicken noodle dinner has a March 9, 1992, expiration
date. The products are also included in a Stage 3 Dinner Variety
Pack marked for use by March 1992.
   The products were distributed to Alabama, Connecticut, Florida,
Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts,
Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio,
Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas, Vermont, Virginia
and West Virginia.
   Farrell said consumers can return the products to stores where
they were purchased for a refund or exchange.
   The company's consumer affairs hotline between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m.
EDT is 1-800-523-6633.

   Subaru said the rear suspension of the vehicles could be
corroded in areas of the country where large quantities of road
salt are used. The corrosion could make operation and control of
the vehicle difficult, the company said.
   Subaru said owners of the recalled vehicles are being notified
to return the car to a Subaru dealer, where the suspension will be
inspected and rust-proofed or replaced.

   National Semiconductor Corp. said
Friday it signed a pact with NEC Corp. to sell one of the Japanese
company's leading edge computer memory chips and explore deals in
marketing, manufacturing and technology.
   The initial agreement between the two electronic giants covers
Tokyo-based NEC's high-volume SRAM chips _ a static random access
memory device with 256,000 bytes of memory.
   ``This agreement broadens our memory products portfolio to
include SRAM products required by manufacturers of a variety of
communications products,'' said John Hekking, vice president of
National Semiconductor's memory division.
   Hajime Sasaki, vice president of NEC's semiconductor group, said
the agreement will contribute to the company's memory products
business, ``but more importantly, it will promote NEC's policy of
international cooperation.''
   National Semiconductor said it would begin offering the NEC
memory devices in July.
   ``It's just one more step in the partnering in the semiconductor
industry,'' said analyst Daniel L. Kleskin of Prudential Bache
Research in San Francisco. ``Texas Instruments and Intel also are
selling Japanese chips. It's a recognition by them, and others,
that a semiconductor company can't be all things to all people. But
they need to provide a full line to their customers, so it makes
sense to work with other companies to provide products they don't
have.''
   Kleskin said the National Semiconductor-NEC pact ``can be a
win-win deal.''
   ``There's not a high margin of profits for National because NEC
has to make a profit, but the risk is minimal because they don't
have to build a plant to make the chips,'' he said. ``For NEC,
which is about a $5 billion company, it's a very small deal ... But
it shows a willingness to work with American companies.''

   Stock prices took a spill Friday, giving up some
of the gains that carried the market to record highs earlier in the
week.
   Technology issues bore the brunt of the selling in a session
marked by sharply reduced activity on the eve of the long Memorial
Day weekend.
   The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials dropped 34.63 to
2,820.92, cutting its gain for the week to 1.01 points.
   Declining issues outnumbered advances by about 7 to 4 in
nationwide trading of New York Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with
543 up, 947 down and 507 unchanged.
   Volume on the floor of the Big Board came to 120.25 million
shares, down from 155.14 million in the previous session, as a good
many traders got an early start on the three-day holiday weekend.
The markets will be closed on Monday for Memorial Day.
   Analysts said the tone for the session was set overnight by word
from Adobe Systems, a computer software company, that its earnings
for the second quarter and full fiscal year were likely to fall
short of analysts' estimates.
   Adobe shares, the most active stock in the over-the-counter
market, tumbled 15\ to 35\. Other computer and technology issues
registered smaller declines on the news.
   Apple Computer, a primary Adobe customer, slumped 2 to 40 in OTC
trading. Among NYSE-listed technology stocks, International
Business Machines dropped 2{ to 116\; Motorola 3 to 80}, and
Hewlett-Packard | to 47\.
   After struggling through an extended rocky spell in the past few
years, technology stocks have enjoyed a revival in the recent rally
that has carried the market to new highs.
   Brokers said the latest word from Adobe came as a fresh setback
to fans of a market group that often is particularly vulnerable to
earnings disappointments.
   Elsewhere, Dennison Manufacturing jumped 8&rsqb; to 27&rsqb; and Avery
International fell 2\ to 26\. Avery agreed to acquire Dennison
through an exchange of stock valued at about $500 million.
   Philip Morris dropped 1| to 42{, weighed down for the second
straight session by news of a federal regulator's call for new
state constraints on cigarette sales.
   Other losers among the blue-chip industrials included American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph, down 1\ at 41|; General Electric, down 1 at
68&rsqb;; DuPont, down 1&lsqb; at 39&lsqb;, and Texaco, down 1&rsqb; at 57\.
   Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including
trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the
over-the-counter market, totaled 147.19 million shares.
   As measured by Wilshire Associates' index of more than 5,000
actively traded stocks, the market lost $28.25 billion, or 0.82
percent, in value.

<HEAD>Dollar Falls Against Yen, Little Changed Against Others</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The dollar fell sharply against the yen but
otherwise was little changed in foreign exchange Friday as
investors regained confidence in the Japanese currency.
   Gold prices generally were higher.
   The recovery of stock prices in Tokyo helped boost confidence in
the yen. The Nikkei Stock Average, the Japanese market's best-known
indicator, rose more than 1,300 points this week.
   The dollar skidded to 149.40 yen in New York from 151.15 late
Thursday. In Tokyo, the dollar fell to a closing 150.05 yen from
151.55 yen, and was quoted at 149.70 yen in London.
   Traders said currency trading generally focused on the West
German mark amid growing uncertainty about German unification.
   Market sentiment ``turned very bearish against the mark,'' said
Earl I. Johnson, an assistant vice president with Harris Trust &amp;
Co. in Chicago.
   The mark had soared in the days after the Berlin Wall began to
come down last winter, symbolically signaling the move to
unification between East and West Germany. But uncertainty about
the union of the two Germanys and their currencies has been
increasing recently and has taken a toll on the mark, traders said.
   Concern over political problems in Eastern Europe and the Soviet
Union also influenced trading in the mark.
   The dollar rose to 1.68235 marks in New York from 1.6815 late
Thursday. In earlier European trading, the dollar rose to 1.6810
marks from Thursday's 1.6780.
   Dealers said U.S. trading was light in advance of the long
Memorial Day holiday weekend.
   Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Thursday's rates, included: 1.4235 Swiss francs, unchanged; 5.6615
French francs, up from 5.6555; 1,235.50 Italian lire, up from
1,233.50; and 1.1830 Canadian dollars, down from 1.18435.
   The dollar was narrowly mixed against the British pound.
Sterling fell to $1.6905 in New York from late Thursday's $1.6910.
In London earlier, the pound rose to $1.6895, from $1.6890 late
Thursday.
   Other late dollar rates in Europe, compared with Thursday's late
rates included: 1.4245 Swiss francs, up from 1.4190; 5.6585 French
francs, up from 5.6445; 1.8820 Dutch guilders, up from 1.8740 on
Wednesday; 1,234.15 Italian lire, up from 1,230.75, and 1.1837
Canadian dollars, down from 1.1853.
   Gold prices rose in New York. On the Commodity Exchange, a troy
ounce of gold for current delivery picked up $1.70 to close at
$368.20, and Republic National Bank later quoted a spot bid of
$367.50, up 90 cents.
   Earlier, gold rose in London to a late bid of $367.34 a troy
ounce from $366.25 late Thursday. In Zurich, gold rose to a closing
bid of $367 from $364 late Wednesday. The market was closed
Thursday.
   Gold fell overnight in Hong Kong, slipping 51 cents to close at
a bid of $367.83.
   Silver for current delivery fell 1.3 cents to $5.215 a troy
ounce on the Commodity Exchange in New York. Silver slipped in
London to a late bid of $5.23 a troy ounce from $5.26 late Thursday.

<HEAD>Shearson Lehman Omits 2nd-Qtr Dividend, Cites American Express
Merger Pact</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Shearson Lehman Hutton Holdings Inc., which is
in a merger pact with its majority owner American Express Co., said
Friday it would omit its common stock dividend for the second
quarter.
   Its regular dividend has been 18.75 cents per share of common
stock.
   The move will save the nation's second largest brokerage company
about $16.5 million in dividend payments on its 88 million shares
of common stock.
   Only about 29 million of those shares are owned by holders other
than American Express, which owns the remaining two-thirds of
Shearson common.
   American Express agreed in March to acquire the Shearson shares
it does not already own. Under terms of the merger agreement, each
publicly-held Shearson share will be converted into 0.48 of a share
of American Express common stock.
   No date has been announced for completion of the merger.
   Shearson said the merger agreement gave it the option of paying
or omitting its second-quarter dividend.
   Last month, Shearson reported it lost $915 million in the first
three months of the year, the securities industry's largest
quarterly loss.
   The loss reflected moves Shearson made to right itself after
expanding too rapidly in the 1980s. Shearson took a $630 million
charge against its earnings to pay for a restructuring that
included 2,000 layoffs and the elimination or reduction of several
businesses.
   In addition to omitting the common share dividend, American
Express will not receive a quarterly dividend on the $750 million
in convertible exchangeable preferred stock of Shearson that it
owns.
   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Shearson fell 37.5
cents a share to $13.75.

<DATELINE>IUKA, Miss. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Lockheed Missiles and Space Co. on Friday won
a $550 million contract to design and build a solid-rocket booster
plant in northeast Mississippi.
   Jerry Berg, a NASA spokesman at the Marshall Space Flight Center
in Huntsville, Ala., said the contract to Lockheed's Sunnyvale,
Calif., division includes $314 million to design and construct new
buildings or modify existing ones, and about $236 million to buy
equipment.
   The facilities will be constructed mainly at Yellow Creek near
Iuka, a government-owned site of an abandoned nuclear power plant.
Construction is expected to take 3{ years.
   NASA will also build a static motor test-firing stand at its
Stennis Space Center near Bay St. Louis, add nozzle production at
its Michoud Assembly Facility near New Orleans, and modify test
installations at the Marshall space center to accomodate the
advanced solid rocket motor, or ASRM.
   Lockheed Missile and Space Co. was awarded a $44 million
contract to build the test-firing stand at Stennis, NASA also
announced Friday.
   The ASRM is designed to replace the space shuttle's current
booster rockets in the mid-1990s.
   The contracts awarded Friday were companions to one awarded to
Lockheed May 11 covering design, development, test and evaluation
of the new rocket motor. Lon Miller, a spokesman at Stennis, said
construction would begin later this year or next, after necessary
permits are obtained.
   Rocket motor testing is scheduled to begin in 1993.

<HEAD>Five Principals of Failed Insurance Co. Plead Guilty to Mail Fraud</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY COATES</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Five of the six family members
controlling the Champion Insurance Co. empire pleaded guilty to
mail fraud charges Friday in a deal with the federal government.
   U.S. District Judge Frank Polozola accepted the pleas but
delayed a decision on Justice Department recommendations for light
sentences until after an investigation.
   The indictment had charged that officials of the company
concealed over $2 million that was provided to Louisiana Insurance
Commissioner Doug Green for use in his 1987 election campaign.
Green was not indicted and has denied any involvement with Champion.
   Under the plea agreement, Champion owner John Eicher and his
son, Naaman, would receive no less than 37 months or no more than
46 months each. Indicted on 19 counts of mail fraud, they pleaded
guilty to four. Each count carries a normal maximum sentence of
five years.
   Patricia Eicher, wife of the owner; Tina Eicher, wife of the
son, and Meredith Eicher, the owner's daughter, pleaded guilty to
two counts each.
   As part of the arrangement with U.S. Attorney Ray Lamonica, the
women would be sentenced to no more than six months each with the
possibility of no jail time.
   The women, along with Ashley Eicher, another daughter of the
owner, were indicted on 11 counts each of mail fraud.
   Ashley Eicher is scheduled to go on trial in July unless an
agreement is reached in her case as well.
   ``There may be some action next week that would eliminate the
need for a trial,'' said Lamonica.
   The Eichers also must agree to cooperate with the government in
the ongoing investigation of Champion and to testify at any trials.
   Defense attroney John Di Giulio was asked later if that part of
the agreement was aimed at an investigation of Commissioner Green.
   ``Possibly,'' he said. ``The government didn't tell me.''
   Prosecutors alleged Green's 1987 campaign was bankrolled by a
Champion subsidiary. Green, a personal friend of Naaman Eicher,
also had business dealings with Eicher prior to his election.
   In addition to the federal charges, a state grand jury in Baton
Rouge, a federal grand jury in New Orleans, and a grand jury in
Montgomery, Ala., have also named the Eichers on dozens of counts
ranging from forgery to mail fraud in connection with Champion.
   The company was Louisiana's third-largest insurer of autos, with
100,000 policyholders, when it collapsed in June 1989.
   Champion got a clean bill of health in February 1989 from an
audit ordered by Green. The audit said the company had $19.5
million in surplus assets.
   The failure left $150 million in unpaid claims in Louisiana and
an undetermined amount in the states of Alabama and Tennessee where
it also operated.
   Nine subsidiaries fell shortly after Champion's collapse.

<HEAD>Government Concludes 21-Month Probe of Utility With No Charges</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARC RICE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   A 21-month investigation into alleged tax fraud
by Southern Co. and its utility subsidiary in Georgia has ended
with no criminal charges filed, the federal government said Friday.
   U.S. Attorney Ray Rukstele said he notified Southern and Georgia
Power Co. that he would not seek indictments against the companies
or any individuals in the tax probe.
   However, Rukstele said he has suggested that the Internal
Revenue Service consider pursuing civil action against Southern. He
declined to comment on whether a related investigation into
possibly illegal campaign contributions by another subsidiary was
continuing.
   An IRS spokeswoman in Atlanta refused to comment on the case.
   The Atlanta Journal, quoting unidentified sources, reported that
federal investigators also were continuing to look into alleged
improprieties in the steering of Southern pension funds to a
brokerage firm that employs the son of company President Edward L.
Addison.
   Rukstele said his decision against pursuing criminal charges
pertained only to tax accounting practices involving Southern and
Georgia Power Co.
   Georgia Power President A.W. Dahlberg said at a news conference
Friday that Rukstele's announcement ``validates'' the company's
position that its methods of accounting for spare parts, the focus
of the federal probe, were proper.
   Dahlberg said he could not comment on whether other aspects of
the investigation were continuing.
   The investigation began in August 1988 when a Georgia Power
accountant told the IRS that the company may have failed to account
properly for spare parts. At issue was at what point the company
was required to deduct the cost of emergency spare parts: when they
are purchased or when they are used.
   The probe shortly afterward was widened to include political
campaign contributions and took a bizarre turn with a
still-unexplained plane crash in April 1989 that killed an
executive and two Southern pilots.
   Southern's Florida subsidiary, Gulf Power Co., pleaded guilty
last November to conspiracy to make illegal campaign contributions
and was fined $500,000. The plea agreement placed most of the blame
for the scheme on Jake Horton, the Gulf Power vice president who
was killed in the crash.
   Authorities said at the time that the plea did not preclude
further action in other areas of the case.
   During the tax investigation, federal agents raided the offices
of Southern and Georgia Power to confiscate tax records. An
internal investigation by Georgia Power found that no wrongdoing
had been committed.
   In addition to Gulf and Georgia Power, Southern is the corporate
parent of Mississippi Power, Alabama Power and Savannah Electric
and Power.

   Chrysler Corp. Treasurer Frederick
Zuckerman is likely to retire this summer to become involved in
other business matters, a company spokesman said Friday.
   ``Our management reluctantly agreed to let Fred pursue the many
other opportunities open to someone with his knowledge and
expertise,'' said company spokesman Tom Houston.
   He said officials of the nation's No. 3 auto maker acted after
Zuckermen told them several months ago of his desire ``to involve
himself in corporate restructuring.''
   An exact date for Zuckerman's departure has not been set,
Houston said, but likely would be this summer.
   Zuckerman, 55, became Chrysler's vice president and treasurer in
December 1981, when the company was in the throes of beating back
bankruptcy on the strength of federal loan guarantees.
   Recently Chrysler has fallen on hard times again and is in the
midst of a cost-cutting program designed to carve $1.5 billion out
of its $26 million annual budget by the end of the year.
   Zuckerman joined Chrysler in October 1979 as an assistant
controller. Before becoming vice president and treasurer, he was a
general assistant controller.

<HEAD>Too Much Rain Keeps Corn Futures Prices Growing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Too much rain kept corn futures prices growing Friday and new
forecasts called for no change in the soggy conditions that have
stalled spring planting in the Midwest.
   Other grain and soybean futures also advanced on the Chicago
Board of Trade.
   On other commodity markets, cocoa futures retreated; livestock
and meat futures rose; precious metals were mixed; and oil futures
were mixed.
   Corn futures settled 1 cent to 5 cents higher in Chicago with
the contract for delivery in July at $2.84 a bushel. The July
contract's gains totaled 9\ cents in the three days ending Friday.
   Wheat futures settled { cent lower to 3 cents higher with July
at $3.30 a bushel; oats were 1\ cents to 2 cents higher with July
at $1.54{ a bushel; soybeans were 1 cent to 3} cents higher with
July at $6.19 a bushel.
   Forecasts for scattered showers in the Corn Belt well into next
week ``overwhelmed everything else'' in the corn market Friday,
said Victor Lespinasse, an assistant vice president in the grain
trading division of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
   ``It's wet, it's been wet and it looks like it's going to
continue to be wet,'' he said.
   After the close, the National Weather Service released a
six-to-10-day forecast predicting wetter-than-normal conditions in
the Midwest from May 31 through June 4.
   ``It looks like a real soggy run for the eastern Corn Belt,''
said Richard Feltes, director of commodity research with the
futures brokerage Refco Inc.
   About 20 percent of the nation's corn crop remains to be
planted, Lespinasse said. If farmers don't get the seed into the
ground within the next 10 days, yield losses are likely, he said.
   That propect was reflected in steeper losses in the new-crop
corn contracts than in the July contract, which represents the last
of the old-crop corn.
   The pattern was reversed in the soybean market, reflecting the
possibility that farmers will plant soybeans on acres they had
planned to sow with corn.
   Cocoa futures fell sharply on New York's Coffee, Sugar &amp; Cocoa
Exchange, erasing Thursday's gains as traders took profits ahead of
the long holiday weekend.
   Prices climbed to new 14-month highs on Thursday and surged
again in early trading Friday on news of a customs workers strike
in the Ivory Coast, the world's biggest cocoa producer. Traders
quickly discounted the importance of the strike, though, since most
of the available Ivory Coast cocoa already has been shipped.
   Cocoa settled $25 to $30 lower with July at $1,464 per ton.
   Most livestock and meat futures rose moderately on the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange in pre-weekend position-evening after several
days of weakness, especially in pork futures.
   After the close, the Agriculture Department released a monthly
report that showed 102.2 million pounds of pork bellies in the
nation's commercial freezers. The number was near market
expectations.
   Live cattle futures settled .02 cent to .25 cent higher with
June at 73.52 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .07 cent lower to
.13 cent higher with August at 83.77 cents a pound; live hogs were
.10 cent to .37 cent higher with June at 65.95 cents a pound;
frozen pork bellies were .12 cent to .38 cent higher with July at
65.85 cents a pound.
   Gold futures rose modestly on New York's Commodity Exchange on
light volume, supported in part by slight weakness in the dollar.
   The advance extended the market's recovery from Wednesday's
plunge of more than $11 an ounce.
   Gold futures settled $1.50 to $1.90 higher with June at $368.40
a troy ounce; silver was 1.3 cents to 1.5 cents higher with May at
$5.215 a troy ounce.
   Energy futures ended mixed on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Near-term crude oil deliveries finished slightly lower after a
burst of buying early in the session that analysts linked to
bullish chart signals.
   West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 5 cents lower to 12
cents higher with July at $17.80 a barrel; heating oil was .15 cent
to .38 cent lower with June at 49.66 cents a gallon; unleaded
gasoline was .40 cent lower to .18 cent higher with June at 63.41
cents a gallon.

<HEAD>Iran Secures $5 Billion Credit Backing for Oil Industry</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANWAR FARUQI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Iran will direct an unprecedented $5
billion in hard currency credits to its oil industry this year, Oil
Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh said Friday.
   Tehran radio, monitored in Nicosia, quoted Aqazadeh as saying
the economic backing was made possible ``with cooperation between
the Ministry of Economy and Finance, and Iran's Central Bank.''
   The massive investments underline Iran's commitment to rebuild
and update its oil industry, which was badly battered in its
eight-year war with Iraq.
   Oil and gas related industries, which earn more than 90 percent
of Iran's foreign exchange, were deprived of funds for maintainance
and development as funds were channeled to the war effort.
   But Tehran began rebuilding immediately after the United
Nations-sponsored cease-fire halted the conflict in August 1988.
   The credits announced Friday comprise about 6 percent of the
country's $80 billion budget for the current year, which began
March 21.
   While inaugurating a methanol plant in southern Iran on Friday,
Aqazadeh said Iran's current sustainable production capacity will
be boosted from 3.3 million barrels a day to 3.7 million barrels a
day in four months and 4 million barrels a day next year.
   He said products from the new plant would help produce glue,
paint pharmaceuticals, petrochemical products, as well as car and
jet fuel, according to Tehran Radio.
   Because domestic demand for methanol would be low until other
industries develop, he said the excess methanol would be exported,
earning Iran $12 million a year.
   Iran's deputy oil minister, Ahmad Rahgozar, said last month that
an additional $5 billion will also be invested in the petrochemical
industry over the next five years.
   After more than a decade of isolation and xenophobia, Iran is
encouraging foreign investment in its projects. Aqazadeh said last
March that the country was talking to numerous companies about gas
and oil development.
   At present Iran is cooperating with Soviet, Japanese and South
Korean firms to develop its oil fields.

<HEAD>Two Trump Operations Announce Job Cutbacks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
   Two of developer Donald Trump's operations, the Taj Mahal Casino
Resort and the Trump Shuttle airline, announced Friday they are
eliminating a total of about 370 jobs as part of streamlining
efforts.
   The cutbacks come amid speculation that Trump has overextended
himself with rapid expansion into the airline and Atlantic City,
N.J., casino industries.
   The Taj Mahal Casino Resort said it is cutting 300 jobs, mostly
in its culinary section, less than two months after it opened.
   In a separate announcement, a spokesman said the Trump Shuttle,
which serves air passengers on the busy Boston-New York-Washington,
D.C. route, had furloughed about 70 of its roughly 1,000 employees.
   Ed Tracy, who oversees Donald Trump's Atlantic City properties
including the Taj Mahal, said the cuts reduce the total
casino-hotel staff to about 6,700.
   He said the lost jobs are part of an overall streamlining effort
at Trump's three casinos, which include Trump Plaza Hotel and
Casino and Trump Castle Casino Resort By The Bay.
   ``Some of these positions will be taken up by other
properties,'' Tracy said.
   ``It's tough to understand why the massive readjustment other
than if they decided to go outside for supplies,'' said Roy
Silbert, president of Local 54 of the Hotel Employees and
Restaurant Employees Restaurant Union.
   Tracy said the casino found it had overstaffed for the
property's April 2 opening. The gaming hall set a city record in
its first month with $34.2 million of gross gambling revenues, but
underwent a management shakeup in its first week amid problems with
its slot machines.
   Trump spokesman Howard Rubenstein said in announcing the shuttle
layoffs that they were part of a continuing streamlining effort.
   The layoffs involve clerical and other support workers but no
pilots, he said.
   Rubenstein said the shuttle is now operating in the black. It
reportedly had been losing money since Trump acquired it from
Eastern Airlines last year for $365 million.
   In April, Trump disclosed that he had hired Merrill Lynch &amp; Co.
to negotiate the possible sale of the shuttle.
   A week ago, Pan Am Corp. said it hoped to sell the Pan Am
Shuttle, which is the main competitor to the Trump Shuttle on the
East coast corridor.

<TEXT>
   General Motors Corp. shareholders approved a plan
Friday to boost executive pensions, nearly doubling the annual
retirement pay of outgoing Chairman Roger Smith to about $1.1
million.
   Pensions for executives vs. those for hourly workers doubtlessly
will be a hot topic when negotiations between GM and the United
Auto Workers union open in July, just a few weeks before Smith
retires July 31.
   Also at the four-hour annual meeting, Smith said the automaker
would begin building cars in an East German joint venture in
October, becoming the first U.S. automaker to make vehicles in
Eastern Europe.
   The company said 83.3 percent of the 503 million voting shares
supported the proposal to boost the pensions of 3,350 top
executives, including Smith, who received $2.5 million in
compensation from GM in 1989.
   Technically, the GM board didn't need shareholder approval to
increase the pensions, and Smith expressed dissatisfaction over the
process.
   ``We don't expect to do it again,'' Smith said. ``It,
apparently, was an experiment gone astray.''
   Under the revised plan, the base used in figuring pensions was
changed from salary alone to salary plus bonuses. Putting the
proposal to a vote may have been sparked by a desire to limit bad
feelings if word of such a boost arose for the first time during
contract negotiations.
   ``I would certainly much rather go to bargaining with the UAW
knowing where we are as opposed, (instead of) going through
bargaining and all of a sudden having a surprise,'' incoming GM
chairman Robert Stempel said at a news conference after the annual
meeting.
   UAW Vice President Stephen Yokich, head of the union's GM
Department, called the pension increases unjustifiable.
   He praised the stance of Michigan Treasurer Robert Bowman, who
voted the 8.8 million shares of GM stock he controls through five
pension funds against the retirement benefit proposal.
   Bowman said the $42 million annual cost of the pensions should
go toward product development, plant modernization and an
underfunded pension plan for hourly employees.
   ``I think Mr. Smith can eke out a retirement'' without the
increase, Bowman said.
   Said Yokich, ``It's encouraging to see Michigan's top officials
... provide leadership for an emerging consensus that today's world
requires that big corporations make consumers, communities and
workers a bigger priority than satisfying the voracious economic
appetites of their executives.''
   The GM pension proposal snared attention earlier this week at
the union's bargaining convention in Kansas City. One of the items
high on the union's agenda this summer will be pension improvements
for its 446,000 retired members, who make up almost half its
membership.
   Opposition to the executive pension plan at GM's annual meeting
got personal at times Friday.
   ``You, sir, with all due respect, will do extremely well,'' said
shareholder Louis Gilbert of New York.
   Stockholder Evelyn Y. Davis of Washington, a fixture at
corporate annual meetings, said, ``Roger, in due respect to you ...
you don't need this type of pension.''
   GM said it studied dozens of large companies and found that GM's
executive pension plan ranked in the bottom fifth. Smith said GM
recently lost 60 of its executives, partly because of the pension
plan.
   Smith declined to say who they were or to list their specific
objections to the previous plan.
   During Smith's 9{-year tenure as GM chairman, the corporation
lost market share, closed plants, laid off tens of thousands of
hourly workers and slashed its executive payroll. The company also
underwent an aggressive plant-modernization program and cut more
than $12 billion in costs since 1987.
   GM plans to increase its presence in Europe, especially in
Eastern Europe, where rapid political and economic reforms are
opening new markets.
   GM said it will make four-door Opel Vectra cars in a joint
venture with Automobilwerke in Eisenach, East Germany. The company
plans to assemble about 10,000 of the cars this year, a volume
expected to grow to about 150,000 annually by the mid-1990s.
   Chrysler Corp. has planned a joint venture to make minivans in
Austria beginning in mid-1991. Ford Motor Co. is studying vehicle
assembly plans in Eastern Europe, but has announced no specific
plans.
   Automobilwerke's factory in Eisenach makes the Wartburg
automobile. GM spokesman Jack Harned said Vectra production will be
separate from Wartburg manufacturing.
   ``It's not GM taking over Wartburg,'' Harned said. GM currently
makes the Vectra in Russelsheim, West Germany.
   Smith said the joint venture with Automobilwerke is the initial
stage of GM's ``New Europe'' strategy. Besides making cars, GM will
begin building engines and assembling a small number of cars in
Hungary by early 1992.

<HEAD>Former Head of Chicago Merc Barred From Futures Trading</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   An administrative law judge found Brian P.
Monieson, former head of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, guilty
Friday of failing to adequately supervise two employees accused of
defrauding customers.
   Monieson, chairman of GNP Commodities Inc., was barred from
futures trading and ordered to pay a $500,000 fine.
   GNP Commodities was found guilty of similar charges and ordered
to close all customer accounts within 30 days and pay a $500,000
fine.
   Monieson's attorney, Jerrold E. Salzman, said the penalties
against his client and the trading firm are on hold while the
ruling is appealed to the full Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
   The two traders, Ira P. Greenspon and Norman K. Furlett, also
were found guilty by Judge George Painter of the CFTC. A lawyer
said they were considering an appeal.
   ``The fraud in this case was committed against the retail
customers, a euphemism for relatively small public customers who
are virtually defenseless,'' Painter said.
   ``The shame of this case is that GNP and Monieson were so
callously indifferent to the wrongs done to their most vulnerable
customers,'' he added.
   CFTC attorneys said Greenspon and Furlett engaged in
``allocated'' trades that bilked customers of thousands of dollars.
   The term refers to initiating futures contracts without the
required customer account numbers, then keeping profitable trades
for themselves while socking customers with the losses.
   ``The facts set forth in this matter constitute a pernicious,
widespread and institutionalized scheme of cheating and defrauding
customers,'' Painter said.
   He banned Greenspon and Furlett, both of Malibu, Calif., from
the futures industry and fined them $75,000 each.
   Monieson's attorneys argued that as chairman of Chicago-based
GNP Commodities, he was not involved in daily oversight of his
employees and should not be liable for failing to stop any
wrongdoing.
   Painter dismissed those claims, referring to testimony from
others who said Monieson was clearly a hands-on manager.
   ``It appears that Monieson's misplaced allegiance to Furlett and
Greenspon overshadowed his greater duty to the customers they were
defrauding,'' the judge said.
   Monieson, of Northbrook, Ill., and GNP Commodities were found
guilty of failing to adequately supervise the two traders from
September 1984 through May 1986. Monieson was Merc chairman from
1983 to 1985.
   Futures are contracts to buy or sell commodities, ranging from
agricultural products to stocks and bonds, at a specified price on
a future date. People trade futures contracts either to lock in
commodity prices in advance, thereby reducing their financial risk,
or to speculate on price changes.
   In Chicago, GNP Commodities issued a statement calling Painter's
decision ``unprecedented and unwarranted.''
   If executives are responsible for their traders' misdeeds, even
when the executives did not personally benefit, ``no firm could
continue to do business,'' the statement said.
   Mark S. Boyle, one of two attorneys representing Greenspon and
Furlett, said he had not seen the entire 135-page ruling but was
considering an appeal.
   ``We still maintain they did nothing wrong,'' Boyle said.
   Neither of the men currently works for GNP Commodities, he said.
   Meanwhile, in Chicago, the Merc on Friday fined GNP Commodities
$100,000 and told the firm to continue its voluntary effort to pay
$300,000 to customers who may have been harmed.
   Under a proposed settlement with the Merc, GNP Commodities
neither admits nor denies violating exchange rules.

<HEAD>Procter &amp; Gamble Negotiating for MTV Contract</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The Procter &amp; Gamble Co., one of the nation's
largest television advertisers, is negotiating a
multimillion-dollar, multiyear contract to advertise on the MTV
cable network.
   P&amp;G spokesman Terry Loftus acknowledged Friday that negotiations
are in progress, but declined to elaborate on terms being discussed
with the music and entertainment network. Advertising Age, a trade
publication, said the potential deal includes a six-year contract
that could exceed $50 million.
   Loftus said he did not know how long the negotiations would take.
   Advertising on MTV would fall in line with P&amp;G's shift since the
mid-1980s to reduce the amount it spends to advertise on the NBC,
ABC and CBS television networks while spending more on ads designed
to reach specific markets. MTV targets viewers in their teens to
mid-30s.
   P&amp;G, a Cincinnati-based maker and seller of consumer goods,
health, beauty care and food products, was for years the nation's
largest advertiser. But in 1988, its U.S. advertising budget of
$1.507 billion was topped by Philip Morris Co.'s $2.058 billion,
Advertising Age said. When spending outside the U.S. is included,
P&amp;G is the world's largest advertiser with a combined budget of
$2.4 billion.
   In October 1987, Procter &amp; Gamble signed a multimillion-dollar
contract for commercials on WTBS in Atlanta, an independent
television station whose programs are shown nationwide, and six
independent TV stations owned by Tribune Broadcasting Co.,
including WGN-TV in Chicago. P&amp;G also advertises on News Corp.'s
Fox network.
   Analysts said P&amp;G began spending less on network TV advertising
because viewer loyalty to the networks was declining and the
company wanted to tap regional niche markets.
   P&amp;G has sponsored racing cars and a racing boat, auto and gem
giveaways, 21 Barry Manilow concerts and a two-year national tour
of the Ringling Bros., Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus. It has also
advertised in informational brochures in doctors' and dentists'
offices through Whittle Communications of Knoxville, Tenn., and on
Whittle's Channel One news program shown in secondary schools.
``Our advertising strategy hasn't really changed over the years,''
Loftus said. ``Our goal is still to communicate with the consumer.
The difference today is that we are finding our consumers in
different places than they were some years ago.''

<HEAD>Judge Says Pension Insurance Fund Claim Against LTV Takes No
Precedence</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN A. BOLT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   The federal pension insurance fund's $2.2 billion
claim against LTV Corp. should be reduced, according to a ruling by
a judge who also rejected an effort by the fund, the Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corp., to push its claim ahead of others in the
company's bankruptcy case.
   The size and status of PBGC's claim against Dallas-based LTV has
been a key issue in the 2-year-old bankruptcy case, one of the
largest in corporate history.
   The decision, released by the company Friday, could cost the
PBGC more than $1 billion if the agency also loses a related case
pending before the U.S. Supreme Court.
   ``If allowed to stand, the bankruptcy court's ill-founded ruling
will severely undercut our ability to reduce or prevent losses to
the pension insurance program,'' said PBGC Executive Director James
B. Lockhart.
   ``PBGC intends to challenge the ruling in federal district
court,'' Lockhart said.
   The 67-page ruling by U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Burton R. Lifland in
New York turned aside PBGC's effort to set the size of its own
claim. It also set aside the agency's assertion that the claim took
precedence over other creditors, including banks, bondholders and
tradesmen.
   ``The PBGC is basically advocating that it is entitled to
promulgate and enforce, even in a bankruptcy case, regulations
which violate fundamental bankruptcy provisions and principles,''
Lifland wrote.
   The PBGC claimed that its expertise in pension funding gave it
the authority to determine the size of future pension payments, but
Lifland said, ``Bankruptcy courts are often and routinely called
upon to determine the present value of projected future payments,
the value of a claim over time, and the value of a recovery which
is in the form of payments over time.''
   As for the claim's standing, ``the PBGC has no legal basis for
arguing that its claims should have a priority status,'' he said.
   Lifland's ruling answers the question of ``where does this claim
stand and how much is it,'' said analyst Gary Heinz at Delaware Bay
Co. in New York.
   ``This is almost as, if not more significant, than the basic
issue before the Supreme Court,'' Heinz said.
   The government has asked the Supreme Court to decide whether the
PBGC, which insures pension funds, has the right to force LTV to
reassume responsibility for three pensions funds terminated when
subsidiary LTV Steel Co. filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1986.
   The high court heard arguments in the case in February, and a
ruling is expected before the court adjourns for the summer in late
June or early July.
   ``If the Supreme Court decided to leave LTV pension plans with
PBGC, the bankruptcy court could reduce PBGC recoveries, and
increase losses to the insurance fund by as much as an additional
$1 billion,'' said a spokeswoman for the fund.
   ``Lifland has chosen his timing to make this statement to
emphasize his opinion of the case law,'' said bankruptcy expert
Chriss Street at Seidler Amdec Securities Inc. in Chicago.
   ``Given his highly respected position on the national bankruptcy
bench as the jurist who has handled the most complex and difficult
cases,'' Street said the decision could have far-reaching impact on
bankruptcy cases. In addition to the complicated LTV case, Lifland
is the judge in Eastern Airlines' bankruptcy case and handled the
petition by Manville Corp.
   ``Judge Lifland has sent a pretty strong message to federal
agencies that they don't possess the confiscatory powers that some
of the bureaucrats in the agencies would have us believe,'' Heinz
said.
   In 1986, LTV Corp. filed for protection for the parent company
and its 65 subsidiaries, including LTV Steel, LTV Aerospace and
Defense and LTV Energy Products. It listed assets totaling $2.06
billion and liabilities of $1.5 billion.
   Primarily because of disputes over the PBGC claim, the company
has yet to file a reorganization plan.

<TEXT>
   Meridian Oil Inc. will buy all producing
properties of Unicon Producing Co. for $399 million, a move that
increases its natural gas reserves by about 500 billion cubic feet,
the company announced Friday.
   A statement issued by Meridian, a subsidiary of Burlington
Resources Inc., said the deal should be concluded within a month.
The agreement is subject to approval by the Federal Trade
Commission.
   Burlington spokesman Don L. Pope said the acquisition would
strengthen Meridian's position as the largest independent natural
gas reserve owner in the U.S.
   As of Dec. 31, its reserves amounted to the equivalent of 4.6
trillion cubic feet and ranked ninth among reserve holders, Pope
said, behind No. 8 Unocal Corp. and No. 7 Texaco Inc.
   Unicon is a Texas partnership of subsidiaries of Union Texas
Petroleum Holdings Inc. and Kiewit Continental Inc.
   Its proven reserves, 94 percent in the San Juan Basin of
northwestern New Mexico, contain about 500 billion cubic feet of
natural gas with ``excellent potential for significant future
reserve additions,'' said a statement from Meridian.
   California utilities provide the biggest market for Meridian
gas, buying around 35 percent to 40 percent of the company's
production, while about half of Unicon's production goes to Gas Co.
of New Mexico, Pope said.

   The National Association of Realtors said Friday overall resales

<HEAD>Bondholder Committees Endorse Resorts Restructuring Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
   Resorts International Inc. said
Thursday that committees representing the company's bondholders
have agreed to swap their $927 million in bonds for reduced debt
and a majority of Resorts' equity.
   The restructuring plan still must win approval of two-thirds of
the bondholders in a formal vote, the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in
Camden, the New Jersey Casino Control Commission and the government
of the Bahamas.
   In addition to Merv Griffin's Resorts Casino Hotel in Atlantic
City, Resorts owns casino property in the Bahamas.
   Thursday's endorsement of the recapitalization plan comes one
week before a May 31 hearing in bankruptcy court on the plan.
   ``I am pleased that the bondholder committees have endorsed our
plan,'' said Resorts chairman Merv Griffin. ``Now we will focus our
attention on making Resorts the world-class resort it can be.''
   The plan filed under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code
would give bondholders 78 percent of the company, dropping
Griffin's stake from 100 percent to 22 percent. Resorts, in turn,
would exchange the $927 million in debt held by those bondholders
for a reduced debt service.
   The plan filed with the court gives senior secured bondholders
$292.8 million in new notes and 2.5 percent of Griffin's shares.
   Holders of Resorts' highest paying bonds, 16| percent, would
receive 32.4 percent of the shares and $58.9 million in new bonds.
The remaining bondholders would get 43.1 percent of the company's
stock and $78.6 million in new notes.
   The plan also sets aside a legal kitty of $5 million to pursue a
possible legal action against Donald Trump, who swapped Resorts to
Griffin for the newly opened Taj Mahal Casino Resort next door on
the Boardwalk.

<TEXT>
   Independent Canadian truckers ended
their three-day strike Thursday afternoon after transportation
officials in Canada promised to address their complaints about
taxes, authorities said.
   ``The blockade ended about a half hour ago,'' said Staff Sgt. R.
Nichols of the police department in Windsor, adjacent to Detroit.
It was one of a number of border cities where blockades had choked
off U.S.-Canadian commerce.
   ``There were about 200 people and another 100 to 150 trucks
there. But the truckers were happy, got into their trucks and drove
away,'' Nichols said.
   But truckers at some other southern Ontario border points,
including Fort Erie across the Niagara River from Buffalo, N.Y.,
and Niagara Falls, remained snarled.
   Trucks were still blocking a lane of the Lewiston-Queenston
Bridge at Niagara Falls late Thursday night, allowing only cars to
pass, state police said. Trucks were not being allowed across the
Peace Bridge linking Buffalo and Fort Erie, and about 100 to 200
trucks were parked on each side of the span, bridge officials said.
   Transport Minister Doug Lewis said after meeting with truckers
that he would take up with the Cabinet their complaints about taxes
and the free-trade agreement with the United States.
   ``I am pleased to have had the opportunity to learn directly
from them their concerns about what they consider to be an unlevel
playing field,'' he said in a statement.
   The protest was sparked by proposed increases in Canada's goods
and services tax that will affect everything from the goods that
truckers haul to the tires, insurance and diesel fuel they buy.
   The U.S.-Canadian trade agreement, which will remove almost all
tariffs by 1999, will further handicap Canadian truckers,
protesters said. The truckers contended that taxes and the
free-trade agreement are crippling their ability to compete with
U.S. drivers.
   The blockade dried up the flow of U.S.-made auto parts to
Canada, forcing the shutdown of three General Motors of Canada Ltd.
plants in Ontario and production cutbacks at one in Quebec. Some
13,000 auto workers were affected. Production also was disrupted at
Chrysler Canada and Ford of Canada.
   Ford plants also closed in Dearborn, Mich.; Wayne, Mich.;
Lorain, Ohio; Avon, Ohio; Louisville, Ky. and Minneapolis, said
company spokesman Peter Olsen.
   ``How and when things will be back to normal really depends on
the flow of auto parts,'' he said. Spokesman for the other
automakers didn't return calls to their homes Thursday evening.
   At Mazda Motor Corp.'s plant in Flat Rock, Mich., 20 miles south
of Detroit, afternoon-shift workers were sent home four hours early
Wednesday afternoon.
   Day-shift employees were sent home two hours early Thursday, and
the entire plant was expected to close Friday, spokesman Tom
McDonald said. The plant gets windshields, brakes and other
components from Canadian suppliers.
   Lewis met Thursday morning in Windsor with a delegation led by
protest organizer Wayne Whitney and Bill Wrye, Ontario minister of
transportation.
   Whitney, Wrye and Tom Baldwin, president of Teamsters Local 880
in Windsor, spoke later in the morning to about 200 truckers
milling near the foot of the bridge. The negotiators drew shouts,
catcalls and curses after saying Lewis could promise only to relay
their concerns to Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and his Cabinet.
   ``We want answers right now!'' bellowed a voice from the crowd.
``We haven't been here two days for nothing. We'll be here another
week if we have to.''
   ``You can't get laws changed in two hours,'' Baldwin pleaded.
``You can't consider them false promises.''
   Protesters earlier blocked the truck lanes at the Canadian end
of the Blue Water Bridge between Sarnia and Port Huron, Mich., said
Morris Hall of the Michigan Department of Transportation.
   Automobile traffic in Port Huron and on the Ambassador Bridge
was moving freely all day Thursday. Authorities at both bridges
refused to let trucks enter Canada because of the likelihood they
would be blockaded and hinder other traffic, Hall said.
   No violence was reported at any of the blockaded border points.
